Abstract: (1) Background: BPD is characterized by affect dysregulation, interpersonal problems, and
disturbances in attachment, but neuroimaging studies investigating attachment representations in
BPD are rare. No study has examined longitudinal neural changes associated with interventions
targeting these impairments. (2) Methods: We aimed to address this gap by performing a longitudinal
neuroimaging study on n = 26 patients with BPD treated with Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT)
and n = 26 matched healthy controls (HCs; post intervention point: n = 18 BPD and n = 23 HCs).
For functional imaging, we applied an attachment paradigm presenting attachment related scenes
represented in drawings paired with related neutral or personalized sentences from one’s own
attachment narratives. In a prior cross-sectional investigation, we identiﬁed increased fMRI-activation
in the human attachment network, in areas related to fear response and the conﬂict monitoring
network in BPD patients. These were especially evident for scenes from the context of loneliness
(monadic pictures paired with individual narrative sentences). Here, we tested whether these
correlates of attachment representation show a near-to-normal development over one year of DBT
intervention. In addition, we were interested in possible associations between fMRI-activation in
these regions-of-interest (ROI) and clinical scores. (3) Results: Patients improved clinically, showing
decreased symptoms of borderline personality organization (BPI) and increased self-directedness
(Temperament and Character Inventory, TCI) over treatment. fMRI-activation was increased in the
anterior medial cingulate cortex (aMCC) and left amygdala in BPD patients at baseline which was
absent after intervention. When investigating associations between scores (BPI, TCI) and functional
activation, we found signiﬁcant effects in the bilateral amygdala. In contrast, aMCC activation
at baseline was negatively associated with treatment outcome, indicating less effective treatment
effects for those with higher aMCC activation at baseline. (4) Conclusions: Monadic attachment
scenes with personalized sentences presented in an fMRI setup are capable of identifying increased
activation magnitude in BPD. After successful DBT treatment, these increased activations tend to
normalize which could be interpreted as signs of a better capability to regulate intensive emotions in
the context of “social pain” towards a more organized/secure attachment representation. Amygdala
activation, however, indicates high correlations with pre-treatment scores; activation in the aMCC is
predictive for treatment gain. Functional activation of the amygdala and the aMCC as a response
to attachment scenes representing loneness at baseline might be relevant inﬂuencing factors for
DBT-intervention outcomes.

1. Introduction
1.1. Characterization of BPD

Borderline personality disorder is the most common personality disorder in psychi-
atric context [1,2], occurring equally in women and men with typical initial manifestation
in adolescence [3,4]. The disorder is associated with considerable functional impairment,
intensive treatment utilization, and high societal costs. Psychotherapy is the treatment
of choice for BPD. The risk of self-mutilation and suicide is high. In the general adult
population, the lifetime prevalence of BPD has been reported to be from 0.7 to 2.7%, while
its prevalence is about 10% in outpatient and 20% in inpatient psychiatric services. Patients
diagnosed with BPD are characterized by instability of self-image, interpersonal relation-
ships, and affects. In detail, they show unstable interpersonal relationships, interpersonal
hypersensitivity, avoidance of abandonment, cognitive self-disturbance, affective instability,
and behavioral dysregulation evident in self-harming behavior or suicidal ideation [2,5,6].
Further symptoms include impulsivity, intense anger, feelings of emptiness, strong aban-
donment fears, suicidal or self-mutilation behavior, and transient stress-related paranoid
ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. There is convincing evidence to suggest that
the interaction between genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences plays a central
role in the etiology of BPD. Prospective longitudinal studies observed impaired caregiving
in combination with parental depression or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
physical abuse and neglect as risk factors for BPD development [7,8].

1.2. Studies on Attachment

Attachment researchers have convergently found a strong association between bor-
derline pathology, adverse childhood experiences, and insecure, disorganized/unresolved
internal working models of attachment. Dysregulated attachment as well as intolerance
of being alone are considered to have their roots in insecure relationships with the care-
giver, characterized by abuse, neglect, or abandonment [9]. In attachment research, adult
attachment can be assessed with reliable and valid measures. One of them is the Adult
Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) validated on the Adult Attachment Interview
(AAI) [10]. The AAP classiﬁes the well-established secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and
unresolved attachment categories on the basis of verbatim narratives to seven attachment
related AAP scenes [11,12]. Various studies found the predominance of preoccupied and
especially unresolved attachment in BPD [13–19]. In addition, studies reported a high
number of “traumatic fear indicators” (e.g., words such as “helplessness”, “emptiness” or
“suicide”) in the participants’ AAP narratives, particularly in stories to pictures represent-
ing aloneness, called “monadic AAP scenes” [20,21]. Unresolved attachment is deﬁned as a
breakdown of organized forms of affective regulation that is conceived as the dysregulation
of the attachment system [22,23]. When confronted with an attachment-relevant stimulus
such as being abandoned or left alone, the internal attachment system is activated on
neurobiological, behavioral, and representational levels [21,24,25].

1.3. fMRI: Paradigms and Findings

Abnormalities in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampus in
the neurobiology of BPD have been consistently implicated in comprehensive reviews [26].
More speciﬁcally, neural processes linked to human attachment and social exclusion have
been repeatedly studied in fMRI studies. The anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) neural
network associated with processing attachment relevant stimuli as social exclusion has
repeatedly been the subject of functional imaging studies on HCs, mostly by using “Cyber-

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

Ball” as a common fMRI-paradigm causing “social pain” [22,27,28]. Using attachment
style questionnaires in fMRI studies, two study groups reported a relationship between
attachment anxiety and heightened neural activity in aMCC [29,30].

The ﬁrst investigation, using an fMRI-adjusted AAP paradigm in healthy controls with
unresolved attachment, found increased activity in the right inferior frontal cortex, the left
superior temporal sulcus (STS), the left head of the caudate nucleus, the bilateral temporal
lobe, the left amygdala-hippocampus area, as well as the right amygdala [31]. In a following
study, BPD patients were compared with HCs using the same paradigm. The results showed
that only the patients with unresolved (vs. organized) attachment representation showed
increased neural activity in the aMCC related to the monadic pictures. The ﬁndings also
showed increased neural activity in the right STS as well as decreased neural activity in
the right parahippocampal gyrus related to dyadic pictures that showed activations in the
aMCC when confronted with “monadic” AAP scenes representing aloneness compared to
healthy controls [21]. In both studies, the participants were instructed to tell stories to the
AAP pictures while being scanned.

In a further study on BPD patients, Bernheim et al. [32] used an AAP attachment
paradigm (see Buchheim et al., 2012 [33]) by presenting core sentences from their own AAP
attachment narratives in the fMRI scanner. BPD patients showed increased fMRI-activation
in brain areas associated with fear, pain, and hyperarousal than HC when presented
with personalized attachment-relevant stimuli alone. Pictures with monadic attachment
situations induced greater anterior medial cingulate cortex, anterior insula, amygdala,
thalamus, and superior temporal gyrus activation in the patient group. The results point to
increased fMRI-activation in areas processing emotional distress and painful experiences
in BPD patients. In particular, the emotional cascade reﬂecting attachment distress was
evoked by combining monadic pictures, representing abandonment and aloneness, with
the patients’ personalized narrative material.

In a “Cyber-Ball” paradigm study focusing on social exclusion, BPD patients displayed
an increased activity in dACC ( ˆ=aMCC), dorsolateral, as well as dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC), precuneus, and anterior insula [34]. Another study showed hyper-
activation in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala during social pain experience [35].
Other previous imaging studies in BPD showed emotional hyperactivity represented
by an increase of activation in the amygdala while watching emotional pictures as well as
emotional faces [36,37]. Related to these ﬁndings, the presented pattern of results has been
interpreted as BPDs being more likely to ascribe higher meaning to people’s intentions in
ways of “hyper mentalization” [32,38].

Summarizing the ﬁndings so far, the following brain areas seem to build up an “attach-
ment neural network” and play a role in speciﬁc attachment-relevant
tasks:
(1) mentalization-related processes and self-awareness: posterior superior temporal sul-
cus (pSTS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and temporal poles, (2) processes of per-
ception/empathy of pain and fear: aMCC, amygdala, anterior insula, and (3) processes
relevant for conﬂict monitoring, cognitive control, and reaction inhibition: aMCC, vPFC,
and dlPFC [39].

The ﬁrst fMRI study presenting longitudinal results during dialectical behavior ther-
apy (DBT) in BPD patients reported on results of a small sample (n = 6). The authors
used the international affective picture set (IAPS) to investigate response to differentially
valanced and arousing pictures showing intervention results in a decreased fMRI-activation
in aMCC and posterior cingulate cortex and left anterior insula. Further, for responders
of treatment (n = 4), there was decreased activation in the amygdala and both sides of the
hippocampi. Further, they reported a near-to-normal development in activation differences
between HC and BPD group from baseline to post interventional imaging [40]. A meta-
analysis additionally identiﬁed six fMRI-activation studies, investigating interventional
effects of DBT linked to changes in emotional regulation capacity in BPD patients. Different
paradigms for stimulating an emotional response by means of negative, positive, or neutral

images including IAPS or a reappraisal task were associated with amygdala and anterior
cingulate deactivation in BPD patients after DBT treatment [26].

1.4. Intervention Strategies

While BPD was considered difﬁcult to treat for a long time, several studies have
proven the opposite [6,41]. Evidence-based treatments for BPD [42,43] are well established
today. Of which, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) has published the most studies
to demonstrate effectiveness [44]. DBT is a structured program of psychotherapy with a
strong educational component designed to provide skills for managing intense emotions
and negotiating social relationships. Originally developed to curb the self-destructive
impulses of chronic suicidal patients, it is also the treatment of choice for borderline
personality disorder, emotion dysregulation, and a growing array of psychiatric conditions.
It consists of group instruction and individual therapy sessions, both conducted weekly, for
six months to a year. The “dialectic” in DBT is an acknowledgment that real life is complex
and health is not static, but an ongoing process hammered out through a continuous
Socratic dialogue with the self and others. It is continually aimed at balancing opposing
forces and investigating the truth of powerful negative emotions.

Metaanalyses have demonstrated therapy success among DBT in terms of primary
outcomes of BPD symptom severity, psychosocial functioning, self-harm behavior, and
suicidality as well as secondary outcomes of speciﬁc BPD diagnostic criteria and depres-
sion [6,45]. However, studies with focus on neural changes of attachment representation
are rare [33].

1.5. Study Aim and Hypotheses

Since a large body of research has reported a strong association between borderline
pathology, adverse childhood experiences, and unresolved attachment, the present study
examines neural changes of attachment in BPD patients during DBT treatment when
confronted with their core issues of own attachment narratives for the ﬁrst time [33,39].
Given the role of emotion regulation and impulsiveness in social cognitive impairment,
interventions designed to improve emotion control, such as DBT, are assumed to be effective
in improving social cognition and affecting regulation on a neural level.

Our aim was to investigate the impact of one-year outpatient dialectical behavior ther-
apy (DBT) on neuronal correlates of attachment representation in patients with BPD using
a personalized fMRI task. For that, we used a standardized experimental setting, applying
a fMRI-adapted AAP version including personalized core sentences from the participants’
own attachment stories, which is described in-depth in previous publications [18,33].

Along previous results (see Section 1.4), we expected an alignment of activation differ-
ences (near-to-normal development) between BPD and HC in attachment-associated brain
areas e.g., amygdala and aMCC, particularly for monadic pictures paired with individual
narrative sentences [39]. In addition, we tested associations between (1) fMRI-activation in
regions-of-interest (ROI) and scores for global clinical staging of BPD (Borderline Personal-
ity Inventory-total score; BPI [46]) and the capacity for self-directedness (Temperament-
and Character Inventory–self directedness scale; TCI_SD; [47]) at baseline and (2) the main
treatment outcome parameters (changes in BPI, TCI_SD) and fMRI-activation in ROIs
at baseline.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Procedure and Study Design

The present study is part of a major functional magnetic resonance imaging study
in borderline patients treated with outpatient DBT investigating changes in neuronal cor-
relates of attachment representation in BPD by using a personalized functional magnet
resonance imaging task. A much more detailed description of study participant charac-
teristics, treatment concept, diagnostic assessments, as well as inclusion and exclusion
criteria is given in a previous publication focusing exclusively on behavioral data [48]. The

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

study was approved by the Ethical Commission of the University Medicine of Greifswald
(BB 136/10). All participants gave informed consent to scientiﬁc procedures such as func-
tional and structural MRI and data scoring before enrollment in the study.

BPD patients were tested before and after intervention with the clinical assessment
battery as well as with structural and functional imaging (see below). HCs were only tested
at baseline for clinical scores to compare with the BPD group. Imaging was performed
twice for both subject groups in order to compare for changes between measurements
without any interventions. Figure 1 depicts the overall study design.

2.2. Sample

The participants in the patient group before intervention were 26 exclusively right-
handed female patients diagnosed with BPD aged 18 to 50 years, recruited from the Depart-
ment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Greifswald and surrounding
psychiatric hospitals. After the intervention period, we had 22 patients for clinical data as-
sessment. For a second post intervention imaging, we had 18 BPD group participants. The
study included patients with clinically relevant Borderline Personality Disorder symptoms
using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, axis II (SKID-II; cut-off ≥ 5 points) [49],
the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI) [46], and the Borderline Symptom List in its
short version (BSL-23) [50]. Participants gave consent to a DBT-speciﬁc contract and, with
that, participated in a 12-month outpatient DBT intervention. When consent was refused,
participants were excluded from study participation. Further DBT exclusion criteria were
being under legal guardianship, mental retardation (IQ < 70), ﬂorid psychotic symptoms,
and powerful disorganization in cognition. Persons in whom contraindications for the
fMRI examination were noted or who were pregnant during survey period were excluded
from study participation. Due to comorbidity with other mental illnesses, medication
with antidepressants seems to be unavoidable in BPD samples. Within our initial sample,
9 of 26 patients (34.6%) took selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Because of
the strong altering effect on brain activity by antipsychotics, there were no participants
on these drugs included in this study. Patients with medications received minimum and
steady dosages over the whole study period.

A total of 26 healthy participants (HCs) were recruited via advertisements on uni-
versity platforms and matched with patient groups in terms of age, sex, and educa-
tion. Detailed baseline comparisons regarding the initial complete sample have been
described before [39].

Inclusion criteria of the HCs were the willingness to participate in psychiatric as-
sessments, attachment interviews, and an fMRI examination. Exclusion criteria were
psychotherapeutic treatment and suffering from any current or former psychiatric disorder
in HCs history. Furthermore, as in the BPD group, persons in whom contraindications
for the fMRI examination were noted or who were pregnant during survey period were
excluded from study participation. After the intervention period, there were 23 HCs for
clinical data as well as imaging data assessment. A ﬂow chart provides more details on

2.3. Measurements
2.3.1. Clinical Instruments

For the investigation of axis I and axis II diagnoses (DSM-IV), trauma history, level
of crystallized intelligence, borderline- and global symptom severity in the intervention
group as well as the control group, and well-established questionnaire- and interview
methods have already been described in Bernheim et al., 2019 [48] and in a cross-sectional
paper [39]. In addition, comorbidity and medication can be found in [48]. Clinical scores
used for longitudinal analyses here were the BPI and the TCI_SD. The Borderline Per-
sonality Inventory (BPI; Leichsenring, 1997) is a 53-item self-report instrument designed
to measure the borderline personality organization according to Kernberg (1967) and in-
cludes an overall value and 4 scales: “experience of alienation and identity diffusion”,
“fear of closeness”, “primitive defense mechanisms and object relations”, and “defective
reality testing”. Sufﬁcient reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.68–0.91, rtt = 0.73–0.88) and con-
struct validity have been conﬁrmed (vgl. Bernheim et al., 2019). The Temperament and
Character Inventory (TCI; [47,51] sub score of self-directedness (TCI_SD; 44 items) is used
to assess personality based on the biosocial model, which divides personality into inde-
pendent dimensions of temperament and character, with the sub-score of the character
dimension we consider at the individual level to be self-direction. This includes aspects
such as sense of responsibility, hopeful purpose, self-acceptance, self-actualization, and
resourcefulness [47,52]. The standardization of the TCI was based on a sample of 509 adult
persons. Sufficient reliability (α = 0.67–0.83), especially high for the subscale “self-directedness”
(α = 0.82), have been conﬁrmed. Content validity inter alia is demonstrated by the correla-
tion between the TCI scores and scales of the “Gießen-Test”. Due to a high reliability as
well as high predictive quality and change sensitivity in the context of psychotherapy [53],
we decided to use the subscale self-directedness in the original true–false version in the
current study in an exposed way.

2.3.2. DBT-Intervention

All participants in the BPD group of 12 months of out-patient DBT experienced
individual psychotherapy (1 h per week), group psychotherapy (e.g., skills training;
2 h weekly), and telephone coaching as needed according to [41,54]. Further, patients
on medications had regular consultations with a psychiatrist. The skills training included
the proven modules of DBT, i.e., skills to improve mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion
regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and self-esteem [55]. The team was composed
of one psychodynamic-orientated consultant psychiatrist and three qualiﬁed behavioral
therapists (total percentage of 75% women). In addition, of all the individuals involved in
therapy, three had DBT basic training prior to the intervention and further and one was
an accredited DBT therapist and trainer according to the guidelines of the German DBT
umbrella organization (DDBT e.V.). Professional supervision for individual and group
psychotherapy was offered regularly every 4 weeks by a DBT-accredited master super-

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

visor. Supplemental supervision was also provided as needed during high conﬂict and
critical situations [53].

2.3.3. Functional and Structural Imaging

Scanning procedures have been described previously in our cross-sectional article [39].
A 3T Siemens Magnetom Verio (Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil was used
to obtain a T1 whole-head volume for structural mapping, T2*-weighted echoplanar images
(EPIs) for functional mapping, and gradient echoes for unwarping the EPIs. The EPIs were
typiﬁed by a repetition time (TR) of 2000 ms, an echo time (TE) of 23 ms, a ﬂip angle (fa)
of 90◦, and a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 208 mm. Each of the volumes consisted of 33 slices
(axial; AC-PC oriented with an additional rotation of 20◦ to reduce susceptibility artifacts
in the frontobasal region) with a voxel size of 2 mm × 2 mm × 3 mm and spacing between
slices of 1 mm. For every participant, 756 EPI volumes of the whole head were obtained. A
total of 34 phase and magnitude images were taken in the identical FOV using a gradient
echo sequence (GRE) of TR = 488 ms, TE(1) = 4.92 ms, TE(2) = 7.38 ms, and fa= 60◦ to
compute a ﬁeld map to correct for geometric distortions in EPI images. The T1-weighted
three-dimensional image (MPRAGE) was applied as a high-resolution spatial structural
image. The total number of sagittal anatomical images/slices was 176 (R = 1900 ms,
TE = 2.52 ms, fa= 90◦, voxel size 1 mm isotropic, matrix size = 256 mm × 256 mm).

2.3.4. Functional Imaging Paradigm and Personalized Core Sentences

Subjects were presented with an fMRI-adjusted version of the AAP [33]. The AAP has
been proven to measure consistent psychometric characteristics and shows a high test-retest
reliability, a high reliability between judges and discriminant, as well as convergent validity
for the assessment of attachment representation in adults [11,12,18,39] The AAP assesses at-
tachment representations by analyzing individual responses to eight attachment-activating
drawings. These illustrate adults or children being alone in a scenario of loneliness, disease,
disconnection, death, and potential abuse, or in such scenery including a second person.
The set of drawings contains one neutral picture (e.g., two children playing ball), three
monadic pictures that show a child or an adult alone (representing abandonment), and
four dyadic pictures portraying child–child/child–adult/adult–adult interaction scenarios
(representing state of interpersonal distress). The images are accompanied by a neutral
description of what can be seen in the drawing (e.g., “Child at Window—a child looks
out a window” or “Bed—a child and woman sit facing each other at opposite ends of the
child’s bed”). According to these drawings, participants are asked to tell a story about the
drawings corresponding standardized interview questions.

All participants (HCs and BPD-group) were presented with personalized AAP core
sentences from their own narratives in the fMRI procedure and asked to rate them after
scanning. For each picture according to each subject, three personalized sentences were
taken from individual narratives following the procedure outlined by [33]. The selected
phrases represent three core aspects of the individual narratives: First, a description of the
event (e.g., “This is a lonely child, cut off from the world”); second, thoughts and feelings
induced by the drawing (e.g., “Nobody plays with her, she feels desperate”); and third,
the outcome of the story (e.g., “She is helpless without any hope.”) [39]. Each trial went
as follows: Presentation: sentence–picture–ﬁxation cross (see Figure 2). Trials have been
individualized for each participant by matching the corresponding AAP picture to the
core statements made in the personal narratives. In addition to these personalized trials,
the same pictures were applied for the creation of both neutral and non-individualized
trials which exclusively used phrases that contained only descriptive components about
the environmental elements portrayed in the scene to match them with corresponding
AAP images. Non-personalized trials were the same for all participants in total. Stimuli
presentation of given visuals within fMRI adjusted AAP paradigm took place in a prede-
ﬁned order [56]. True to this approach for each of the two conditions, personalized and
non-personalized, 6 trials were run, each consisting of a set comprising 7 continuous trials

which followed the standardized sequence of “sentence-picture-10s ﬁxation period”. Three
sets included seven personalized phrase-drawing-combinations and three sets contained
seven neutral phrase-drawing-combinations, identical for all subjects. Overall, we pre-
sented 84 trials, including 42 personalized and 42 non-personalized trials in an alternating
manner, with a total running time of 25 min. There were no intermissions between the
trials, as they were presented in one pass. Using a questionnaire, the personal meaning
in terms of emotionality and autobiography of each personalized sentence per image was
assessed by the participants immediately after imaging [33,48]. For the temporal order of
the fMRI-paradigm, see Figure 3.

2.3.5. Preprocessing of Imaging Data

Data were analyzed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience)
implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Unwarping of geometri-
cally distorted EPIs was performed in the phase encoding direction using the FieldMap
Toolbox. Each time-series was realigned to the ﬁrst image of each session and resliced. EPIs
were co-registered to the T1-weighted anatomical image, and T1-weighted images were
segmented to localize grey and white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid. This segmentation
was the basis for spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) tem-
plate using the DARTEL approach of SPM. Here, a group template was calculated, reﬁned
iteratively by diffeomorphic registration steps, co-registered to the SPM MNI template,
and used to spatially normalize the functional images while applying a Gaussian kernel
smoothing ﬁlter (9 × 9 × 9 mm full-width at half maximum) to improve spatial alignment
and increase the signal-to-noise-ratio. Six movement parameters estimated during the
realignment procedure were introduced into the model as covariates to control for variance
due to head displacements. A temporal high-pass ﬁlter (128 s) was applied to remove
slow signal drifts. Individual statistical maps for main effects (personalized monadic pic-
tures/personalized dyadic pictures) and contrasts (personalized monadic pictures minus
personalized dyadic pictures; monadic pictures + personalized minus neutral sentences)
were calculated using the general linear model. First-level contrast images of each subject
were used for group statistics calculated as a random-effect analysis at the second level.

For the deﬁnition of ROIs, we focused on BPD-associated brain areas mentioned in
previous research according to processes of perception and empathy of pain and fear: the
aMCC [29,30] and the amygdala [39].

Anatomical classiﬁcation of fMRI-activation (MNI-space) was performed using op-
timized masks as ROIs for each hypothesis. For the mid-cingulate, we used the Neuro-
morphometrics brain atlas and for the amygdala the Anatomy Toolbox Version 1.7 [57].
Highest fMRI-activation within these masks were evaluated for each participant using in
house scripting as described before [58]. These betas were then further evaluated using
SPSS in a secondary statistical evaluation (see below).

2.3.6. Statistical Comparisons

Statistical analysis of assessment data was executed with SPSS (IBM coop.) version 21.
Sample size calculation was performed for the clinical outcome with a clinical effect size of

Non-personalized trials were the same for all participants in total. Stimuli presen-tation of given visuals within fMRI adjusted AAP paradigm took place in a predefined order [56]. True to this approach for each of the two conditions, personalized and non-personalized, 6 trials were run, each consisting of a set comprising 7 continuous trials which followed the standardized sequence of “sentence-picture-10s fixation period”. Three sets included seven personalized phrase-drawing-combinations and three sets con-tained seven neutral phrase-drawing-combinations, identical for all subjects. Overall, we presented 84 trials, including 42 personalized and 42 non-personalized trials in an alter-nating manner, with a total running time of 25 min. There were no intermissions between the trials, as they were presented in one pass. Using a questionnaire, the personal meaning in terms of emotionality and autobiography of each personalized sentence per image was assessed by the participants immediately after imaging [33,48]. For the temporal order of the fMRI-paradigm, see Figure 3.   Figure 3. fMRI experimental procedure for a presentation of prior instructions, an emotional or neu-tral sentence for the monadic picture and a monadic picture.

This segmentation was the basis for spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Insti-tute (MNI) template using the DARTEL approach of SPM. Here, a group template was calculated, refined iteratively by diffeomorphic registration steps, co-registered to the SPM MNI template, and used to spatially normalize the functional images while applying a Gaussian kernel smoothing filter (9 × 9 × 9 mm full-width at half maximum) to improve spatial alignment and increase the signal-to-noise-ratio. Six movement parameters esti-mated during the realignment procedure were introduced into the model as covariates to control for variance due to head displacements. A temporal high-pass filter (128 s) was applied to remove slow signal drifts. Individual statistical maps for main effects (person-alized monadic pictures/personalized dyadic pictures) and contrasts (personalized mo-nadic pictures minus personalized dyadic pictures; monadic pictures + personalized mi-nus neutral sentences) were calculated using the general linear model.

For the mid-cingulate, we used the Neuromor-phometrics brain atlas and for the amygdala the Anatomy Toolbox Version 1.7 [57]. Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

0.6 and α = 0.05 based on meta-analyses investigating the global effectiveness of DBT [59]
and, furthermore, based on a study investigating effects of DBT on the neural correlates of
affective hyperarousal in BPD [40].

For between-group comparison of ratings, chi-square tests were applied; it should be
noted at this point that non-parametric tests are required, since a normal distribution of the
data cannot be assumed.

First-level SPMs were calculated using SPM12 (version 7219). When testing differ-
ences between groups (assuming higher fMRI-activation in BPD-patients at baseline), we
used one-sided t-tests corrected for three comparisons (ROIs; corresponds to a two-sided
p of <0.032). When testing changes over time, we compared differences between groups for
the post-intervention time point (assuming that baseline differences are no more relevant af-
ter intervention). Pearson correlations were used to evaluate associations of fMRI-activation
with the main outcome scores (BPI and TCI_SL) during baseline and for changes in score
over intervention.

3. Results
3.1. Sample Characteristics

As described in detail [39], the complete sample of n = 26 BPD patients scored sig-
niﬁcantly higher than HCs regarding borderline- and global symptom severity as well as
number of trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and exhibited a comorbidity of ﬁve
additional axis I diagnoses and one additional axis II diagnoses (DSM-IV). The participants
of the BPD group (n = 18) and the HC group (n = 23) considered here who were included
in the pre–post imaging data analyses were comparable for age and intellectual perfor-
mance/IQ. BPD patients scored signiﬁcant higher borderline symptom severity (BPI, BSL-
23), lower self-directedness (TCI_SD), and, measured by the AAP, revealed different attach-
ment classiﬁcation compared to the HCs (HCs: predominant insecure-dismissing attach-
ment classiﬁcation vs. BPD: predominant insecure-preoccupied attachment classiﬁcation)
(see Table 1).

3.2. Clinical Changes during Intervention

Figure 4 plots the BPI and TCI_SD scores of the participants. Throughout intervention,
there was a decrease of BPI total score from 27.23 ± 5.9 to 18.74 ± 10.43 (t(22) = 3.52;
p = 0.002; Figure 4A). TCI_SD improved over intervention from 20.19 ± 9.40 to 30.04 ± 7.81
(t(22) = −5.18; p = 0.001; Figure 4B).

3.3. fMRI Data Results
3.3.1. Between Group Comparisons (Monadic Pictures with Personalized Sentences)

Before intervention, BPD patents showed increased amygdala activation left
t(50) = 2.83; p = 0.014; beta average/SD: HCs: 0.36 ± 0.19; BPD: 0.58 ± 0.33) and aMCC
activation (t(50) = 2.28; p = 0.028; beta average/SD: HCs: 0.96 ± 0.56; BPD: 1.33 ± 0.60).
fMRI-differences between groups were absent after intervention (amygdala left: t(39) = 0.11;
n.s.; aMCC: t(39) = 1.69; n.s.).

3.3.2. Association between BPD Group fMRI Images and Clinical BPD Scores

When testing associations between clinical scores (BPI; TCI_SD and fMRI-activation in
preselected ROIs (aMCC, amygdala, STS) during baseline, we found a positive correlation
for BPI with left amygdala activation (r(52) = 0.44; pc = 0.01) and a negative correlation for
TCI_SD with left amygdala activation (r(52) = −0.42; pc = 0.02; Figure 5A). When testing
which fMRI-activation at baseline was predictive for improvements in clinical scores (BPI,
TCI_SD), we found a negative correlation for changes in BPI: for the aMCC: r(23) = −0.56;
p = 0.006; higher fMRI-activation in aMCC initially led to fewer changes in clinical BPD
total score (Figure 5B).

Significance of the Study and Main Findings There has been no study to date that has addressed the change in neuronal correlates of attachment representation during DBT. Therefore, this study is currently the first to investigate the functional representation of attachment-relevant stimuli using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP; [11]) in an interventional design. This study specifically investigated changes in functional representation of attachment relevant stim-uli of BPD patients in the course of DBT. After DBT, we found a near-to-normal represen-tation in selected ROIs when confronting BPD patients with monadic pictures paired with personalized sentences from their own AAP interviews. That was relevant for the left amygdala and the aMCC, which showed differences between groups before intervention. When testing associations of clinical scores (BPI, TCI_SD) over all participants (BPD, HCs) with fMRI-activation in ROIs, we observed a positive association of BPI and a negative association of TCI_SD with amygdala activation at baseline. When testing associations of fMRI-activation at baseline with clinical improvement (BPI), we found a negative associ-ation of aMCC activation. Therefore, those who showed high aMCC activation and were confronted with monadic scenes paired with personalized sentences initially showed poorer BPI decline over DBT. In the following, we discuss these findings and emphasize the special importance of amygdala and aMCC activation for attachment representation in BPD.  4.2. Intervention Effects and fMRI Findings Over the last years, several studies reported intervention effects of DBT in BPD [45]. We have also previously published most of our treatment effects from the current study. We observed a reduction of BPI total score [48] and an increase of TCI_SD [53].

4. Discussion
4.1. Signiﬁcance of the Study and Main Findings

There has been no study to date that has addressed the change in neuronal correlates
of attachment representation during DBT. Therefore, this study is currently the ﬁrst to
investigate the functional representation of attachment-relevant stimuli using the Adult
Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP; [11]) in an interventional design. This study
speciﬁcally investigated changes in functional representation of attachment relevant stimuli
of BPD patients in the course of DBT. After DBT, we found a near-to-normal representation in
selected ROIs when confronting BPD patients with monadic pictures paired with personal-
ized sentences from their own AAP interviews. That was relevant for the left amygdala and
the aMCC, which showed differences between groups before intervention. When testing
associations of clinical scores (BPI, TCI_SD) over all participants (BPD, HCs) with fMRI-
activation in ROIs, we observed a positive association of BPI and a negative association of
TCI_SD with amygdala activation at baseline. When testing associations of fMRI-activation
at baseline with clinical improvement (BPI), we found a negative association of aMCC
activation. Therefore, those who showed high aMCC activation and were confronted with
monadic scenes paired with personalized sentences initially showed poorer BPI decline
over DBT. In the following, we discuss these ﬁndings and emphasize the special importance
of amygdala and aMCC activation for attachment representation in BPD.

4.2. Intervention Effects and fMRI Findings

Over the last years, several studies reported intervention effects of DBT in BPD [45].
We have also previously published most of our treatment effects from the current study.
We observed a reduction of BPI total score [48] and an increase of TCI_SD [53]. We selected
BPI as it is frequently used in assessment of borderline personality disorder in adults. It
is based on Kernberg’s concept of borderline personality organization [60] and contains
four scales of alienation experiences and identity diffusion, primitive defense mechanisms
and object relations, deﬁcient reality testing, and fear of closeness [46]. In contrast, TCI_SD
describes personality assessment based on the biosocial model, dividing personality into
independent dimensions of temperament and character, where the subscore of the character
dimension considered by us at the level of the individual is self-directedness and has been
selected to be especially sensitive for monitoring the therapeutic intervention here [53].
This includes aspects such as sense of responsibility, hopeful purpose, self-acceptance,
self-actualization, and resourcefulness [52,61].

4.3. fMRI-Effects in the aMCC

At baseline, we observed an increase of aMCC activation in response to presented
monadic pictures accompanied by personalized sentences in BPD patients. In studies
with healthy participants, aMCC was related to processing attachment relevant stimuli
such as social exclusion and increased attachment anxiety [27,29,30,62]. Further, aMCC
has been suggested to be part of the neural network that processes physical as well as
social pain [28,63]. Previous studies in BPD patients revealed higher aMCC activation than
controls for attachment-relevant stimuli related to social pain [34] Moreover, longitudinal
fMRI-activation studies on interventional effects of DBT related to emotional regulation
during IAPS presentation in BPD patients described decreased activation in the aMCC after
intervention [26]. With the present longitudinal fMRI analysis, we observed a convergence
of activation differences between the HC and BPD group after one year of outpatient DBT
according to attachment relevant stimuli presented in the AAP. According to this, our results
go along with reported fMRI results in a current meta-analysis [26]. In addition, those areas
with highest reduction over intervention were those showing relevant association with
clinical scores. When investigating predictive value of fMRI-activation for clinical outcome
under DBT-intervention, we found that aMCC activation in response to the personalized
monadic pictures of the AAP at baseline showed negative associations with gain in BPI.
Therefore, BPD patients who initially showed high activation in the aMCC beneﬁted less

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

13 of 17

from intervention with regard to speciﬁc borderline symptomatology, as represented by
the BPI total score. In line with Iskric and Barkley-Levenson [26], imaging prior to therapy
initiation could make a signiﬁcant contribution to an individualized therapy approach
and the resulting higher individual beneﬁt from DBT treatment. Although higher aMCC
activation at study enrollment predicted less improvement for BPD patients, DBT led
to improved clinical functioning and reduced aMCC activation regardless of severity at
enrollment.

4.4. fMRI-Effects in the Amygdala

At baseline, we observed higher activation in BPD patients in the left amygdala.
This goes along with reports from a previous study in BPD patients, which also reported
increased activity of the amygdala compared to HC when confronted with attachment
relevant stimuli related to social pain [35]. Several other studies also found evidence
of a higher activation level of the amygdala in BPD-patients while (1) watching a set of
standardized emotionally stimuli [64] and (2) watching emotional faces [37]. As a result, the
increased amygdala activation in BPD is associated with an intensiﬁed emotional response,
which is of a longer duration and occurs even in the presence of low-grade stress-associated
stimuli. Increased amygdala activation was therefore linked to ascribing higher meaning to
people’s intentions in ways of “hypermentalization” [36].

Longitudinal studies on interventional effects of DBT in BPD patients showed de-
creased activation in the amygdala after intervention when observing the IAPS [26]. With
the present longitudinal data analysis on functional imaging results, we observed a conver-
gence of activation differences between the HC and BPD group after one year of outpatient
DBT according to attachment-relevant stimuli presented in AAP. This “near-to-normal”
development was found for the left amygdala when comparing both groups in terms of
monadic picture stimuli paired with personalized sentences from one’s own narrative.

Schmitgen et al. [65] found that amygdala and parahippocampus activation during
a cognitive reappraisal task after viewing negative pictures, severity measures of BPD
psychopathology, and grey matter volume of the amygdala provided the best predictive
power for identifying DBT treatment non-responders. In this regard, we found associations
over all participants for the BPI and the TCI_SD with fMRI-activation in the left amyg-
dala at baseline. An increased activity in the left amygdala was therefore associated with
an increased level of borderline personality organization according to Kernberg [60]. In
addition, an increased activity in the left amygdala was associated with a lower degree
of self-directedness, which manifests itself in decreased self-acceptance, low capacity for
constructive reﬂection and self-mastery, goal-setting, and achievement [52,61]. Once again,
our results highlight the “supportive role” of a well-developed capacity for “self-direction”
to manage intense emotions—in the context, it focuses on presenting personalized attach-
ment stimuli in an fMRI environment. This led to the conclusion that the development of
self-directedness should be an explicit goal in the context of DBT [53].

4.5. Limitations

Attachment related pictures used in our study [56] were grouped with individualized
sentences, which might hamper group comparisons (less emotional relevant sentences
for HCs). However, it was well suited for the longitudinal analyses and quite speciﬁcally
addressed social experiences such as feeling lonely and being left alone. In contrast, other
studies who applied the IAPS [40] had been associated with circumscribed modulation of
fMRI-activation [66]. We argue that the target variable to be addressed by the AAP drawings
is at a much higher level of organization: an attachment representation. These drawings
elicit internal working models derived from early childhood attachment experiences with
the closest attachment ﬁgures, which Bowlby [23] suggests elicits speciﬁc patterns in
cognition, feelings, and behavior. Mehlum interpreted a “mechanism of change” due
to DBT intervention in BPD [67] which was based on a deﬁnition from Kazdin [68]: the
“ . . . mechanism explains how the intervention translates into events that lead to the

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1001

14 of 17

outcome”. Overall, the neural network associated with attachment can be modulated by
DBT in association with the clinical outcome.

Moreover, we used an ROI-based method for data analysis, selecting activation
maxima in predeﬁned anatomical masks. This approach has the advantage of selecting the
strongest effect in areas probably affected by susceptibility artifacts accompanied by spatial
distortions, which could hamper voxel-based approaches e.g., due to registration issues.
However, it does not allow such a precise spatial localization of effects in comparison to
voxel-based analysis approaches. Again, using activation maximum in ROIs is beneﬁcial
for small study sizes to observe even small effects but might lead to an overestimation
of results.

Moreover, we did not repeat the AAP interview after one year. Therefore, we could not
support our results on functional representation changes of the attachment representation
network in the BPD group on a narrative behavioral level. However, our previous results of
the same cohort showed a signiﬁcant reduction of the emotional valence when confronted
with the personalized sentences of the own AAP interview in the AAP questionnaire, as
well as a more secure attachment style, measured by the ASQ questionnaire, after one year
of DBT intervention in the BPD group [48].

Additionally, in Bernheim et al. [39], we described two relevant limitations: At
ﬁrst, we had a wide range of patients with comorbidity of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD: 39%); however, no differences in the fMRI activation patterns could be found be-
tween our BPD patients with or without PTSD. Secondly, nine of n = 26 BPD patients (34,6%)
took Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), which might have an additional effect
on fMRI activation. The medication dosage was kept at minimum throughout the study
and subgroup analyses revealed no differences in the fMRI activation patterns between
BPD patients with or without SSRIs.

Furthermore, we have to state that a larger sample size might have been able to detect
smaller effects. Finally, for some scores, we did not repeat clinical scoring after one year in
the HC group. There might have been some changes in scoring over time in that group too,
although they did not undergo DBT.

5. Conclusions

In accordance with previous studies [33,39], the present study again conﬁrmed that
monadic attachment stimuli from the AAP interview combined with personalized attach-
ment material seem to be suitable to activate the attachment system on a neuronal level.
Monadic pictures from the AAP represent the experience of abandonment and loss, which
is strongly associated with the trauma history of patients with BPD.

We may conclude that neuronal changes in the amygdala—as well as in the aMCC—
towards a “near to normal” activation when confronted with monadic, personalized at-
tachment material after one year of DBT might be interpreted as a sign of the patients’
increased capability to regulate intensive emotions in the context of abandonment and
loss—and therefore, “social pain”. In this regard, one year of outpatient DBT including
weekly individual therapy and skills training could help to stabilize the internal working
model of attachment towards a more modulated attachment activation.

Future studies with greater sample sizes should aim to replicate these results in the
course of DBT. Moreover, with respect to the predictive value of imaging before treatment
and its prediction for improvement in clinical scores, future research should address the
question of how to adapt the current DBT approach for the treatment of BPD patients with
elevated aMCC prior to therapy initiation to achieve an even better response to DBT. In
addition, imaging prior to therapy initiation could contribute to an individualized therapy
approach and result in even higher individual beneﬁt from DBT treatment for BPD patients.
