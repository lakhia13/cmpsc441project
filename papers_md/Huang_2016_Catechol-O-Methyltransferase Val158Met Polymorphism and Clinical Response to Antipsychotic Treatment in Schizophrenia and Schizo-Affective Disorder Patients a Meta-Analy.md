Abstract

Background: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme plays a crucial role in dopamine degradation, and the COMT 
Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) is associated with significant differences in enzymatic activity and consequently dopamine 
concentrations in the prefrontal cortex. Multiple studies have analyzed the COMT Val158Met variant in relation to antipsychotic 
response. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis examining the relationship between COMT Val158Met and antipsychotic response.
Methods: Searches using PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases (03/01/2015) yielded 23 studies investigating COMT 
Val158Met variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder. Responders/nonresponders 
were  defined  using  each  study’s  original  criteria.  If  no  binary  response  definition  was  used,  authors  were  asked  to  define 
response  according  to  at  least  30%  Positive  and  Negative  Syndrome  Scale  score  reduction  (or  equivalent  in  other  scales). 
Analysis was conducted under a fixed-effects model.
Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Five additional antipsychotic-treated samples were analyzed for 
Val158Met and response and included in the meta-analysis (ntotal = 1416). Met/Met individuals were significantly more likely to respond 
than Val-carriers (P = .039, ORMet/Met = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.02–1.85). Met/Met patients also experienced significantly greater improvement in 
positive symptoms relative to Val-carriers (P = .030, SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.024–0.46). Posthoc analyses on patients treated with atypical 
antipsychotics (n = 1207) showed that Met/Met patients were significantly more likely to respond relative to Val-carriers (P = .0098, 
ORMet/Met = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11–2.14), while no difference was observed for typical-antipsychotic-treated patients (n = 155) (P = .65).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism is associated with response to antipsychotics in 
schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder patients. This effect may be more pronounced for atypical antipsychotics.

Introduction

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder 
with high heritability (~0.8) (McGuffin et al., 1995). While antipsy-
chotic  drugs  are  currently  the  most  effective  treatment,  clinical 
response  varies  significantly  between  patients,  with  an  overall 
response rate of only 50% (Lieberman et al., 2005). The field of phar-
macogenetics  aims  to  optimize  treatment  at  the  individual  level 
by  leveraging  our  knowledge  of  how  genetic  variants  influence 
clinical response. Since all antipsychotics target the dopamine (DA) 
system  to  various  extents  by  binding  to  dopamine  D2  receptors, 
pharmacogenetics  studies  have  largely  focused  on  DA  system-
related genes, including those encoding the dopamine D2 receptor 
(DRD2)  and  catechol-O-methyltransferase  (COMT).  Previous  stud-
ies have identified associations for genes such as DRD2 and DRD3 
(dopamine D3 receptor) in relation to response to antipsychotics 
(Hwang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). Other genes implicated in 
response include 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C (Pouget and Müller, 2014).

The  COMT  gene  is  located  within  the  22q11  chromosomal 
locus,  a  region  highly  implicated  in  SCZ  risk  (Badner  and 
Gershon, 2002; Lewis et al., 2003). The COMT enzyme plays a sig-
nificant role in cortical DA degradation (Lachman et al., 1996). The 
majority of pharmacogenetics studies examining COMT in rela-
tion  to  antipsychotic  response  have  focused  on  the  functional 
variant Val158Met (rs4680). Other putatively functional variants 
have also been examined, though relatively infrequently (Chen 
et al., 2004; Molero et al., 2007). The Val158Met variant is located 
within exon 4 of the COMT gene and involves a G-to-A nucleo-
tide switch, leading to a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitu-
tion at codon 158. The Met-allele form of the enzyme has lower 
thermostability and has been observed to exhibit reduced enzy-
matic activity, contributing to increased levels of cortical dopa-
mine (Chen et al., 2004); the Met/Met homozygote has 3- to 4-fold 
lower enzymatic activity than the Val/Val homozygote, while the 
heterozygote has intermediate activity (Chen et al., 2004).

Studies  of  COMT  Val158Met  and  antipsychotic  response  in 
SCZ  and  schizo-affective  disorder  have  yielded  mixed  results. 
A number of studies have observed that the Met-allele is asso-
ciated  with  better  overall  clinical  response  as  well  as  greater 
improvement in negative symptoms and cognitive abilities such 

as  working  memory  (Bertolino  et  al.,  2004,  2007;  Molero  et  al., 
2007; Woodward et al., 2007; Pelayo-Terán et al., 2011). However, 
other  studies  have  either  been  unable  to  replicate  these  find-
ings (Yamanouchi et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2012; Tybura et al., 2012; 
Bishop  et  al.,  2015)  or  observed  the  opposite  effect,  with  the 
Met-allele  predicting  nonresponse  to  antipsychotic  therapy  (Illi 
et al., 2003; Porcelli et al., 2009). In an effort to clarify the COMT 
Val158Met variant’s role in antipsychotic response, we conducted 
a meta-analysis of the existing literature plus additional data. In 
our primary analysis, we examined the association between this 
variant  and  both  binary  and  continuous  measures  of  response 
to  antipsychotics. The  meta-analysis  focused  solely  on  clinical 
response to antipsychotics, since the overwhelming majority of 
Val158Met pharmacogenetics studies examined this phenotype.

Methods and Materials

Literature Search

A literature search was conducted for articles written in English 
published  up  to  March  1,  2015,  examining  the  COMT Val158Met 
variant  and  antipsychotic  response  in  SCZ  and  schizo-affective 
disorder patients. We performed searches on PubMed, PsychInfo, 
and  Web  of  Science  using  all  combinations  of  the  key  terms 
‘COMT,’ ‘Catechol O-methyltransferase,’ and ‘Val158Met,’ with the 
phrases  ‘antipsychotic  response’  and  ‘SCZ  treatment  response.’ 
Criteria  for  inclusion  in  the  current  study  consisted  of:  (1)  the 
association  between  the  COMT  Val158Met  polymorphism  and 
antipsychotic  response  was  assessed;  (2)  the  patients  were 
diagnosed  with  SCZ  or  schizoaffective  disorder  based  on  DSM-
III,  DSM-IV,  DSM-V,  or  ICD-10  criteria  and  their  diagnoses  were 
verified through a standardized structured clinical interview; (3) 
antipsychotic  response  was  evaluated  according  to  a  standard-
ized clinical rating scale, such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); (4) 
drug response (symptom severity) was evaluated at a minimum 
of 2 time points, one of which was directly prior to starting antip-
sychotic therapy; and (5) patients were evaluated for a minimum

of 2 weeks for response to treatment. Studies investigating non-
clinical  aspects  of  response,  such  as  cognitive  response,  were 
excluded. We also searched through the reference sections of arti-
cles meeting these criteria to find other articles fit for inclusion. 
Authors  were  contacted  for  data  when  the  data  necessary  for 
analysis was not reported in articles that met inclusion criteria.

In total, the literature search yielded 23 peer-reviewed articles 
published before March 1, 2015. Two of these articles were identified 
through  searching  the  reference  sections  of  the  other  21  articles 
(Porcelli et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2010). The literature search process 
is outlined in Figure 1. In total, 15 articles met inclusion criteria for 
the current study. However, 11 of the 15 studies did not have group-
level  data  (ie,  number  of  responders/nonresponders)  available 
online (Molero et al., 2007; Ikeda et al., 2008; Fijal et al., 2009; Need 
et al., 2009; Porcelli et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2012; 
Tybura et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Bishop et al., 2015; Bosia et al., 
2015).  Another  2  studies  focused  on  first-episode  psychosis  and 
did  not  provide  the  response/nonresponse  data  for  its  subset  of 
SCZ or schizo-affective disorder patients (Pelayo-Terán et al., 2011; 
Prata et al., 2012). We attempted to contact each of these groups 
and obtained data from 7 of these studies (Molero et al., 2007; Ikeda 
et al., 2008; Porcelli et al., 2009; Pelayo-Terán et al., 2011; Gao et al., 
2012; Tybura et al., 2012; Bishop et al., 2015). The studies for which 
we were unable to retrieve the required data were excluded (Fijal 
et  al.,  2009;  Need  et  al.,  2009;  Kang  et  al.,  2010;  Prata  et  al.,  2012; 
Zhao et al., 2012; Bosia et al., 2015). We added data from 5 additional 
samples that our group has published on previously (Hwang et al., 
2012; Zai et al., 2012; Tiwari et al., 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2014) to 
these 10 studies’ samples to give a total of 15 samples (ntotal = 1416). 
Two of these samples had previously been analyzed for Val158Met 
and  antipsychotic  response  (Nolan  et  al.,  2006),  while  the  other 
3  had  not  been.  Figure  1  illustrates  the  literature  search  process. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 15 samples are 
described in Table 1. All 15 samples included data for the number 
of responders and nonresponders. Ten of these samples also had 
data for change in total score (%). Of these 10 samples, 6 further 
included  positive  and  negative  symptom  subscale  score  change 

data. We later contacted the authors for studies with a mix of atyp-
ical and typical-antipsychotic-treated patients to obtain response 
data for each antipsychotic type separately.

Subjects from Toronto Samples

The  5  samples  from Toronto  in  this  analysis  included Toronto 
samples (TS)1–5. TS1 (Lieberman, N = 58) was collected at 4 psy-
chiatric state hospitals in New York and North Carolina. These 
patients  met  DSM-IV  criteria  for  chronic  SCZ  and  or  schizo-
affective disorder. They exhibited suboptimal response to prior 
treatment,  defined  primarily  by  persistent  positive  symptoms 
and  poor  functioning  for  the  past  2  years.  The  patients  were 
recruited  as  part  of  a  14-week,  randomized,  double-blinded 
study and response was evaluated using the PANSS scale. This 
sample  is  also  described  in  greater  detail  elsewhere  (Volavka 
et  al.,  2004).  TS2  (Müller,  N = 89)  was  collected  at  Charité 
University  Medicine,  Berlin,  Germany.  Patients  were  diagnosed 
with  SCZ  or  schizo-affective  disorder  according  to  DSM-IV  or 
ICD-10 criteria and treated with several different antipsychotics. 
This sample is described in more detail elsewhere (Müller et al., 
2012). TS3  (Meltzer,  N = 90),  4  (Lieberman,  N = 90),  and  5  (Potkin, 
N = 32)  were  collected  from  Case  Western  Reserve  University 
in Cleveland, Ohio, Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, New 
York, and University of California at Irvine, respectively. Subjects 
from TS3-5 had DSM-III-R or DSM-IV diagnoses of SCZ and met 
criteria for treatment refractoriness or intolerance to traditional 
antipsychotic  therapy.  After  a  2-  to  4-week  washout  period, 
patients  were  treated  with  clozapine  and  evaluated  prospec-
tively for 6 months, during which blood levels of clozapine were 
monitored to confirm treatment adherence. Treatment response 
was  evaluated  using  the  18-item  BPRS  (Overall  and  Gorham, 
1962)  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  treatment.  These  samples 
are  described  in  greater  detail  elsewhere  (Hwang  et  al.,  2005). 
Analysis of response in each of these samples is discussed in the 
section “Definition of Response.” The ethnicities of patients from 
all 5 samples are described in Table 1.

Ethical Considerations

The  scientific  work  described  in  this  article  is  in  compliance 
with  the  ethical  standards  stated  in  the  1964  Declaration  of 
Helsinki.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  prior  to  patient  par-
ticipation, and this work was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

Definition of Clinical Response

Clinical responders and nonresponders were defined based on 
the  criteria  applied  within  each  original  study  separately.  If  a 
study did not report the antipsychotic response data in binary 
responder/nonresponder  form,  study  investigators  were  con-
tacted  and  requested  to  apply  a  response  threshold  of  30% 
change  in  PANSS  score  or  the  equivalent  in  the  clinical  rating 
scale used in their study. The 30% cutoff was adopted for the cur-
rent study, as it was the most commonly applied criteria in the 
studies included in the meta-analysis. We used the conversion 
scale of Leucht et al. (2013) to calculate corresponding response 
thresholds  for  other  rating  scales.  For  instance,  according  to 
this scale, the equivalent score change in the BPRS scale is 35%. 
For TS4,  only  responder/nonresponder  data  were  available,  for 
which response was defined as >20% reduction in overall BPRS 
score  after  6  months  of  treatment  based  on  criteria  proposed 
by Kane et al. (1988). Thus, we had no option but to utilize this 
response definition for this sample. Overall, 14 of the 15 samples 
used the 30% PANSS score change (or equivalent) response cri-
teria. Nonclinical dimensions of response, such as improvement 
in cognition, were not analyzed.

Genotyping

For the Toronto samples, genomic data were extracted using the 
high-salt  method  from  venous  blood  (Lahiri  and  Nurnberger, 
1991).  The  COMT  Val158Met  (rs4680)  variant  was  genotyped 
using  Taqman  5’  nuclease  assay  (Applied  Biosystems;  Foster 
City,  CA).  All  ambiguous  genotypes  were  retyped.  Genotypes 
that remained ambiguous were excluded from further analyses. 

Genotyping accuracy was assessed by repeating genotyping for 
10% of the sample, and results showed 100% concordance.

Statistical Analysis

All  data  were  analyzed  using  R  statistical  software  (v3.1.1). 
Meta-analysis was performed using the ‘meta’ package, version 
4.1-0  (Guido  Schwarzer,  University  of  Freiburg).  Fixed  effects 
models were used for each analysis, consistent with approaches 
commonly  used  in  pharmacogenetic  meta-analyses  (Serretti 
et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010). In our primary analysis, separate 
meta-analyses  were  conducted  assuming  three  genetic  mod-
els:  recessive  (Met/Met  vs  Val-allele  carriers),  dominant  (Val/
Val  vs  Met-allele  carriers),  and  allelic  (Val  vs  Met  allele).  All  3 
models  were  used  to  test  the  association  of  COMT  Val158Met 
with  numbers  of  treatment  responders  vs  nonresponders. 
Odds ratios and 95% CIs were computed and pooled using the 
Mantel-Haenszel  method  to  determine  overall  effect  sizes. We 
also  examined  each  genetic  model  in  relation  to  total  symp-
tom  score  change  (%),  positive  subscale  score  change  (%),  and 
negative  subscale  score  change  (%)  in  a  subset  of  study  sam-
ples  for  which  data  were  available  (total:  studies = 10,  n = 1085; 
subscales:  studies = 6,  n = 616).  Effect  sizes  were  analyzed  by 
computing SMD. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q 
test. Meta-regression was used to check for confounding effects 
due to the following variables: self-reported ethnicity, SCZ type 
(first-episode vs non-first episode), antipsychotic type (atypical-
only vs mixed; specific drugs), age of onset, sex, study design (eg, 
prospective, naturalistic), duration of study, drug naïve vs prior 
exposure, and criteria for response. Publication bias was evalu-
ated using the Harbord test (Harbord et al., 2006) and the funnel 
plot method (“metabias” and “funnel” commands, respectively). 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted on any significant findings 
(P < .05)  by  removing  the  studies  with  the  largest  and  smallest 
effect  sizes,  as  in  other  antipsychotic  pharmacogenetic  meta-
analyses (Zhang et al., 2010).

To  dissect  the  factors  (eg,  ancestry,  antipsychotic  type) 
contributing  to  the  observed  genetic  effect,  we  examined  the 
association  between  genotype  and  number  of  responders/

Huang et al. 

|  5

nonresponders  in  samples  of  European  ancestry  (studies = 10, 
ntotal = 929). We focused on this ancestry group, as it constituted 
the majority of the samples. Ancestry may be important due to 
significant  differences  in  Val158Met  allele  frequency  between 
ethnicities. Moreover, since antipsychotic type showed a trend-
level  association  with  response,  we  examined  the  association 
between Val158Met and number of responders vs nonresponders 
in atypical and typical antipsychotic-treated patients separately.
With regards to correction for multiple testing, our approach 
is in line with that of prior pharmacogenetic meta-analyses in 
that  we  did  not  correct  for  the  multiple  genetic  models  tested 
when analyzing single genetic variants due to high correlations 
between the models (Bakker et al., 2006, 2008; Zhang et al., 2010).

Results

Primary Analyses

We observed a significant association with number of respond-
ers/non-responders  under  the  recessive  model  (Met/Met  vs 
Val-allele  carriers)  (P = .039,  ORMet/Met = 1.37,  95%  CI:  1.02–1.85) 
(Figure  2; Table  2).  We  also  observed  a  trend-level  association 
for  total  score  change  (P = .087,  SMD = 0.14,  95%  CI:  -0.020–0.30) 
under  a  recessive  model.  Upon  examination  of  the  subscales, 
we observed a significant effect of Val158Met on positive symp-
tom response also under a recessive model (P = .030, SMD = 0.24, 
95%  CI:  0.024–0.46).  No  significant  associations  of  Val158Met 
genotype were observed for any other response measures under 
any genetic model (all P > .05). The Cochran chi-squared test did 
not reveal any significant heterogeneity for the recessive model 
in  relation  to  number  of  responders/non-responders  (P = .37, 
Q = 15.07, df = 14,  I2 = 7.1%) or for the  other genetic models and 
response measures (all Cochran test P > .05). Funnel plot analysis 

and the Harbord test revealed no evidence of publication bias for 
the recessive model in relation to number of responders/nonre-
sponders (P = .35) (Figure 3) or for the other genetic models.

To  screen  for  potentially  undetected  heterogeneity,  we 
employed  the  sensitivity  analysis  conducted  by  Zhang  et  al. 
(2010)  in  their  pharmacogenetic  meta-analysis  (Zhang  et  al., 
2010), excluding the 2 studies with the largest (Bertolino et al., 
2004) and smallest effect sizes (Ikeda et al., 2008). Sensitivity anal-
ysis was conducted for the association between the Val158Met 
variant  and  number  of  responders/nonresponders  under  the 
recessive model. This revealed no undetected heterogeneity and 
no significant influence on overall effect. After exclusion of the 
2 studies, the significance of the association increased slightly 
(P = .012), while the effect size remained the same (OR = 1.54, 95% 
CI: 1.10–2.15) and the heterogeneity decreased (I2 = 0%, P = .65).

Meta-regressions 

including  potential  confounding  vari-
ables  revealed  a  trend  for  antipsychotic  type  (atypical-only  vs 
mixed)  as  a  predictor  of  response  rate  across  studies  (P = .055).

We could not include the variable of atypical vs typical antipsy-
chotic-treated samples, as there were no studies with patients 
exclusively  treated  with  typical  antipsychotics.  None  of  the 
remaining  potential  confounders  tested  were  associated  with 
response  rate:  gender,  ethnicity,  first  episode  vs  non-first  epi-
sode, treatment duration, study design, age at onset, drug-naïve 
vs prior exposure, and criteria for response.

Posthoc Analyses

Since the meta-regression revealed antipsychotic type (atypical 
vs mixed) to be a potential predictor of response (P = .055), analy-
ses were conducted separately on patients treated with atypical 
antipsychotics  (studies = 15;  ntotal = 1207)  and  typical  antipsy-
chotics (studies = 7; ntotal = 155). The 7 studies with typical antip-
sychotic-treated  patients  also  included  patients  treated  with 
atypical antipsychotics, but these were  excluded  for this  anal-
ysis.  In  the  subsample  of  patients  treated  with  atypical  antip-
sychotics, significant differences in the number of responders/
nonresponders were observed under a recessive genetic model 
(Met/Met vs Val-allele carriers), whereby patients with Met/Met 
genotype experienced improved clinical response relative to Val 
carriers (P = .0098, OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11–2.14) (Figure 4; Table 2). 
Additionally,  allelic  analyses  revealed  that  the  Met-allele  was 
associated  with  greater  likelihood  of  response  compared  to 
the Val-allele (P = .043, OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01–1.44) (supplemen-
tary  Figure  1;  Table  2).  No  association  was  observed  between 
Val158Met  and  response/nonresponse  in  the  subsample  of 
patients treated with typical antipsychotics (Table 3).

In the subsample of atypical antipsychotic-treated patients, 
Cochran’s  chi-square  test  revealed  that  heterogeneity  was  not 
significant under the recessive (I2 = 0%, P = .52) or allelic models 
(I2  =  0%,  P = .50). After  excluding  the  2  studies  with  the  largest 
(Bertolino  et  al.,  2004)  and  smallest  effect  sizes  (Molero  et  al., 
2007), sensitivity analyses revealed no undetected heterogeneity 
and  no  significant  influence  on  overall  effect  under  the  reces-
sive  or  allelic  models.  Further  analyses  revealed  no  significant 
publication  bias  (supplementary  Material;  Figure  5). The  effect 
remained  significant  when  analyzing  only  samples  for  which 
response  was  defined  as  30%  PANSS  score  reduction  (stud-
ies = 14, n = 1317) (I2 = 13.8%, P = .046).

Due to significant differences in Val158Met allele frequency 
between  ethnicities  (ASN:  0.29,  EUR:  0.52,  AFR:  0.31),  we  con-
ducted  an  analysis  on  studies  with  samples  of  European-
ancestry  (studies = 10,  ntotal = 929).  No  significant  effects  were 
observed for binary response/nonresponse under the recessive 
model  (P = .29,  OR=1.21,  95%  CI=0.85–1.72);  however,  consistent 
with  whole  group  analyses,  a  trend  was  observed  for  atypical 
antipsychotic-treated  patients  of  European  ancestry  (stud-
ies = 10,  ntotal = 745)  (P = .061,  OR = 1.45,  95%  CI = 0.98–2.15),  with 
Met/Met  patients  experiencing  better  response  than Val-allele 
carriers. The Cochran test showed no significant heterogeneity 
under any of the genetic models (all tests P > .05). Furthermore, 
funnel plot analysis and the Harbord test did not reveal any sig-
nificant publication bias (supplementary Figure 2).

Discussion

To  our  knowledge,  this  study  is  the  most  comprehensive 
meta-analysis  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  COMT 
Val158Met and antipsychotic clinical response. Our meta-anal-
ysis  includes  data  from  8  studies  not  reported  in  the  original 
manuscripts and kindly provided to us by the authors (Molero 
et  al.,  2007;  Ikeda  et  al.,  2008;  Gupta  et  al.,  2009;  Porcelli  et  al., 
2009; Pelayo-Terán et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2012; Tybura et al., 2012; 
Bishop et al., 2015), as well as 3 samples previously not investi-
gated for Val158Met and antipsychotic response (TS2, TS3, TS5). 
Thus,  our  study  provides  a  much-expanded  sample  compared 
with  a  previous  meta-analysis  (Chen  et  al.,  2015).  More  impor-
tantly, all samples included in our meta-analysis were analyzed 
for response/nonresponse according to uniform criteria (PANSS 
30%  reduction  or  equivalent),  with  the  exception  of  one  (TS4), 
minimizing inter-study heterogeneity.

Overall,  significant  effects  of  Val158Met  on  response  vs 
nonresponse, as well as positive symptom improvement, were 
observed.  The  association  was  stronger  when  restricting  the 
analysis  to  studies  with  atypical  antipsychotic-treated  sam-
ples (eg, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone). Overall, Met-allele 
homozygotes  experienced  improved  response  compared  with 
Val-allele carriers.

These results are consistent with previous studies finding that 
the  Met-allele  is  associated  with  improved  cognitive  response

to atypical antipsychotics (Bertolino et al., 2004; Weickert et al., 
2004;  Woodward  et  al.,  2007).  These  studies  evaluated  cogni-
tive  response  using  tests  such  as  the  Wisconsin  Card  Sorting 
Test  that  evaluate  cognitive  abilities  including  working  mem-
ory,  executive  function,  and  attention  (Weickert  et  al.,  2004). 
Conceivably,  improvements  in  clinical  symptoms,  particularly 
positive  symptoms,  may  contribute  to  cognitive  improvement. 
Alternatively,  improvements  in  clinical  symptoms  may  be 
mediated by improvement in cognitive function (Censits et al., 
1997; Velligan et al., 1997; Gold et al., 1999; Hoff et al., 1999); in 
particular,  improved  working  memory  and  executive  function 
could  lead  to  improved  treatment  compliance  and  adherence 
to  psychiatrist  recommendations,  resulting  in  improved  clini-
cal outcome. Cognitive response data were available in 3 of the 
studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis.  Consistent  with  previ-
ous findings, Bertolino et al. (2004) observed that the Met-allele 
predicted  better  working  memory  response  to  olanzapine  as 
measured by the N-back task (Bertolino et al., 2004). The 2 other 

studies did not observe an association between Val158Met and 
improvement  in  memory  function  or  cognitive  flexibility  (Gao 
et al., 2012) and spatial working memory (Bishop et al., 2015) in 
response  to  antipsychotic  treatment,  respectively. The  reasons 
for this are not clear but may relate to antipsychotic drug-type 
(both these samples were treated either largely or entirely with 
risperidone) and cognitive assessment methods (ie, Bishop et al. 
assessed spatial working memory). However, it should be noted 
that Gao et al. (2012) observed the same direction effect as previ-
ous studies, with the Met-allele appearing to experience greater 
improvement  in  orientation,  comprehension,  and  experiential 
and number memory (Gao et al., 2012).

The  findings  are  also  consistent  with  the  tonic-phasic  DA 
hypothesis  as  applied  to  antipsychotic  response.  According  to 
this hypothesis, DA regulation in limbic striatal regions occurs 
through  transient,  high-amplitude,  phasic  DA  release  and  per-
sistent  low-level  tonic  DA  release  modulated  by  corticostriatal 
glutamatergic afferents. In these regions, tonic DA release also

drug response: funnel plot and regression plot.

decreases  phasic  release  through  the  stimulation  of  D2  auto-
receptors at the synapse (Bilder et al., 2004). Importantly, COMT 
is involved in modulating the tonic, extracellular pool of DA sub-
cortically, as it breaks down DA that is not reabsorbed by dopa-
mine  transporters.  Thus,  the  Met-allele  leads  to  lower  COMT 
activity,  higher  tonic  DA,  and  lower  phasic  DA  release  (more 
negative symptoms), while the Val-allele gives rise to lower tonic 
and higher phasic DA release (more positive symptoms) (Bilder 
et al., 2004). Bilder et al. (2004) have also suggested that D1 recep-
tors  are  more  important  for  modulating  tonic  release,  while 
D2 receptors are more critical for regulating phasic DA release 
(Bilder et al., 2004). Therefore, the COMT Val158Met variant may 
have different effects on response to different classes of antipsy-
chotics. Specifically, they suggest that the Met-allele may predict 
better response to agents enhancing D1-transmission (5-HT2A-
antagonists  and/or  5-HT1A-agonists  or  partial  agonists),  since 
they are thought to increase tonic DA transmission (Bilder et al., 
2004). These agents include the majority of atypical antipsychot-
ics. The Val-allele, in contrast, is hypothesized to predict better 
response to conventional D2-blocking agents (ie, typical antip-
sychotics), as they decrease phasic DA transmission.

Our  findings  for  positive  symptoms  may  also  be  consist-
ent with the tonic-phasic DA hypothesis. Based on the predic-
tions  of  Bilder  et  al.,  the  Met-allele  may  also  predict  improved 
response  in  positive  symptoms  due  to  lower  phasic  DA  trans-
mission  subcortically,  which  could  potentiate  the  effects  of 
antipsychotic-induced  D2  receptor  blockade.  This  prediction 
is supported by previous findings that the Met-allele is associ-
ated with greater dopamine synthesis in the midbrain and thus 
lower  striatal  dopaminergic  stimulation  (Meyer-Lindenberg 
et  al.,  2005).  Moreover,  consistent  with  this  theory,  reduced 
COMT  activity  has  been  observed  to  potentiate  clozapine-
induced  DA  release  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  (PFC)  (Tunbridge 
et  al.,  2004).  By  the  tonic-phasic  DA  hypothesis,  increased  DA 
release in the PFC leads to greater D1 receptor activation, stimu-
lating  greater  glutamate  release  from  pyramidal  neurons  onto 
the nucleus accumbens. This, in turn, increases tonic DA release, 
subsequently  decreasing  phasic  DA  release  and  thus  reducing 
positive symptom severity (Bilder et al., 2004). Specific atypical 
antipsychotics  such  as  risperidone  and  olanzapine  have  also 
been observed to upregulate COMT mRNA expression in the rat 

PFC  (Chen  and  Chen,  2007),  suggesting  a  direct  effect  of  these 
drugs on COMT activity.

The  observed  null  genetic  effect  in  typical-antipsychotic-
treated patients may be a product of lack of statistical power, as 
the majority of patients were treated with atypical antipsychot-
ics  (typical:  n = 155,  atypical:  n = 1207).  Ultimately,  it  is  possible 
that analyses conducted in larger samples could reveal associa-
tions of Val158Met with response in subjects treated with typical 
antipsychotics. Further, we acknowledge that differences among 
specific  drugs  within  each  class  of  antipsychotics,  rather  than 
broader class differences between atypical and typical antipsy-
chotics, may be driving the results. However, due to limited data, 
this could not be tested.

The  direction  of  genetic  effect  was  consistent  across  11  of 
the  15  samples  in  both  the  analysis  of  total  sample  as  well  as 
of atypical-antipsychotic-treated patients alone. The four sam-
ples observing a genetic effect in the opposite direction included 
TS1, Molero et al. (2007), Gao et al. (2007), and Ikeda et al. (2008). 
Notably,  these  4  samples’  effects  were  all  nonsignificant  (95% 
CI  of  OR  encompasses  1),  leaving  open  the  possibility  that  the 
opposite directions of effect may be due to random chance. It is 
possible that ancestry-related differences in the frequencies of 
COMT genetic variants other than Val158Met may explain these 
results.  For  instance,  the  functional  variant  Ala72Ser  (rs6267), 
which  is  not  in  LD  with  Val158Met,  also  alters  COMT  activ-
ity  and  exists  only  in  East-Asian  populations  (MAF:  0.07–0.11) 
(Gupta  et  al.,  2011).  Functional  investigations  suggest  that  this 
variant may exert its effect additively together with Val158Met, 
whereby  presence  of  both  low-activity  alleles  results  in  lower 
COMT activity than possession of either allele alone (Lee et al., 
2005).  Thus,  while  ancestry-related  differences  in  MAF  and 
COMT  genetic  variation  may  provide  insight  into  the  opposite 
direction  of  effect  observed,  we  did  not  have  sufficient  sam-
ples of Asian ancestry to test for ancestry-specific associations. 
Another  sample  showing  an  opposite  direction  of  effect,  TS1, 
was  highly  treatment-resistant  and  included  only  4  respond-
ers  compared  with  54  nonresponders;  this  lack  of  statistical 
power  likely  contributed  to  the  null  genetic  effect  observed  in 
this sample. Finally, none of the 4 samples deviated from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P < .05), ruling this out as a possible 
explanation.

In  addition,  Molero  et  al.  (2007)  may  have  observed  a  non-
significant  effect  for Val158Met  in  their  sample  due  to  several 
reasons. First, their sample differed from the majority of other 
samples in that the study specifically included patients who had 
recently  experienced  an  acute  worsening  of  psychotic  symp-
toms,  leading  to  uniquely  high  initial  scores  (average  PANSS 
score:  ~90).  Second,  the  Val-allele  carriers  had  significantly 
higher PANSS scores compared with Met-allele homozygotes at 
the study’s beginning. Since baseline score has been observed to 
predict  overall  response,  this  score  differential  may  have  con-
tributed to greater score change for Val-allele carriers and thus a 
higher number of responders. Importantly, Met-allele homozy-
gotes had significantly lower PANSS scores than Val-allele carri-
ers at the end of the 6 months of treatment, which is consistent 
with findings from other studies in the meta-analysis.

The  present  meta-analysis  had  several  limitations.  First, 
while we attempted to test and control for possible confounding 
factors,  several  factors  could  not  be  accounted  for  due  to  lack 
of  data  availability.  These  include  pharmacological  aspects  of 
treatment response, such as drug dose or concentrations, as well 
as  environmental  factors,  such  as  significant  stress  or  lifetime 
exposure  to  psychosis-inducing  drugs.  Nevertheless,  it  should 
be  noted  that  no  confounding  effects  were  observed  for  the 
variables tested, except for antipsychotic type (trend observed). 
Moreover,  heterogeneity  across  studies  was  not  significant  for 
any of the genetic models or response measures evaluated, sug-
gesting  minimal  confounding  by  unidentified  factors.  Second, 
although  we  did  not  observe  a  significant  influence  of  ethnic-
ity  in  our  samples,  it  should  be  noted  non-European  ethnici-
ties were underrepresented. This imbalance may be important, 
since, as mentioned previously, Val158Met allele frequencies dif-
fer considerably among ethnic groups. Nevertheless, the fact that 
the  sample  consisted  of  mostly  patients  of  European  ancestry 
helps  reduce heterogeneity in the sample. Third, it should  also 
be  noted  that  the  genotypes  in  the  sample  from  Pelayo-Teran 
et al. (2011) were not in HWE (P < .05). However, the skewing effect 
due  to  non-HWE  should  be  minimal,  as  removing  this  sample 
did  not  impact  the  overall  genetic  effect  observed  or  the  level 
of heterogeneity. Lastly, if we were to apply a Bonferroni correc-
tion threshold, the association observed between Val158Met and 
number of responders/nonresponders in the total sample would 
be nonsignificant. However, given the high correlation between 
the genetic models applied and phenotype measures of response, 
this method for correction would be overly conservative.

Overall,  our  meta-analysis  provides  evidence  that  COMT 
Val158Met is associated with response to antipsychotics, with a 
stronger effect observed for atypical antipsychotics. Prospective 
studies  with  complete  categorical  and  continuous  response 
measure  data  that  differentiate  between  atypical  and  typi-
cal  antipsychotics  would  help  in  strengthening  the  evidence 
of  this  functional  variant’s  relationship  with  antipsychotic 
response.  Future  studies  of  COMT  should  also  include  other 
putatively  functional  variants  such  as  rs6267,  rs737865,  and 
rs4818  (SZGene  Data  Base,  Nature  Genetics,  2008)  (Bray  et  al., 
2003;  Chen  et  al.,  2004)  in  order  to  obtain  a  more  comprehen-
sive  understanding  of  how  genetically  predicted  COMT  func-
tion may influence antipsychotic response. Moreover, given the 
complexity of the antipsychotic response phenotype, it is likely 
that  other  genetic,  environmental,  and  potentially  epigenetic 
factors are involved, which were beyond the scope of this study. 
Notably,  several  findings  provide  evidence  for  multiple  gene-
gene  interaction  and  gene-environment  interactions  involving 
COMT  (Nicodemus  et  al.,  2007).  Moving  forward,  investigations 
of epistatic and gene-environment interactions involving COMT 

Huang et al.

should further improve our understanding of this gene’s effect 
on  antipsychotic  response.  Nevertheless,  our  findings  suggest 
that COMT Val158Met may warrant closer consideration in ran-
domized  clinical  trials.  Since  this  variant  appears  to  associate 
with  response,  balancing  each  arm  of  a  RCT  so  that  the  same 
percentage of Met/Met are represented in each arm may prevent 
COMT genetic imbalance from confounding the efficacy results.
