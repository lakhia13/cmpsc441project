Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a major health concern with high lifetime prevalence. The current medication is rather unspecific and,
despite considerable efforts, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory. However, there are no appropriate and specific animal models available to
study the underlying etiology of the disorder. Therefore, we aimed to establish a model of specific social fear in mice and use this social
fear conditioning (SFC) model to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the benzodiazepine diazepam and of the antidepressant paroxetine;
treatments currently used for SAD patients. We show that by administering electric foot shocks (2–5, 1 s, 0.7 mA) during the
investigation of a con-specific, the investigation of unfamiliar con-specifics was reduced for both the short- and long-term,
indicating
lasting social fear. The induced fear was specific to social stimuli and did not lead to other behavioral alterations, such as fear of novelty,
general anxiety, depression, and impaired locomotion. We show that social fear was dose-dependently reversed by acute diazepam, at
doses that were not anxiolytic in a non-social context, such as the elevated plus maze. Finally, we show that chronic paroxetine treatment
reversed social fear. All in all, we demonstrated robust social fear after exposure to SFC in mice, which was reversed with both acute
benzodiazepine and chronic antidepressant treatment. We propose the SFC model as an appropriate animal model to identify the
underlying etiology of SAD and possible novel treatment approaches.

INTRODUCTION

Social anxiety disorder (SAD), often referred to as social
phobia, is characterized by persistent fear and avoidance of
social situations. Epidemiologically, SAD is the third most
common psychiatric disorder, with a 12-month and lifetime
prevalence of 6.8% and 12.1%, respectively (Kessler et al,
2005a, b). For diagnostic purposes, SAD has been divided in
two subtypes: specific and generalized SAD. The specific
form refers to the fear and avoidance of a particular social
situation and includes performance anxiety (eg, fear of
giving a public speech), interaction anxiety (fear of social
interaction and observation situations), and fear of showing
anxiety symptoms (Bo¨gels et al, 2010). Patients with
generalized SAD are more impaired as they fear and avoid
a wide range of social situations (den Boer, 1997; Kessler
et al, 1998; Ruipe´rez et al, 2002). This avoidant behavior has
an important role in the maintenance of SAD and prevents

the reversal of fear in social situations (American Psychia-
tric Association, 1994; Stangier et al, 2006).

At present, SAD treatment consists of cognitive-behavi-
oral therapy (CBT) (Gould et al, 1997; Fedoroff and Taylor,
2001), which leads to gradual fear extinction, ie, a decline in
the fear response as a result of repeated exposure to the
feared situation, and is often combined with medication
originally designed for depression or generalized anxiety,
such as antidepressants, b-blockers, and benzodiazepines.
However, a high percentage of SAD patients fail to respond
to the available treatment options, or achieve only partial
remission of symptoms, with antidepressants providing the
best response rates (Liebowitz et al, 1992; Baldwin et al,
1999; Van Ameringen et al, 2001). Given the high prevalence
and unsatisfactory treatment options for SAD, a better
understanding of the etiology and underlying neurobio-
logical mechanisms of social fear, particularly extinction
of social fear,
in turn, might
is urgently needed. This,
provide important information for the development of more
specific medication and an improved treatment outcome
for SAD patients.

However,

there are currently no appropriate animal
models available to study the disorder. Social anxiety/avoid-
ance is presently induced using a number of paradigms,
including the social defeat paradigm- used both acutely and
chronically (for reviews see Huhman, 2006; Yan et al, 2010),

and foot-shock exposure (Haller and Bakos, 2002; Louvart
et al, 2005; Mikics et al, 2008a). However, these paradigms
to the behavioral
are rather unspecific with respect
alterations they induce, as increased general anxiety,
depression, and impaired locomotion were found to
accompany the social avoidance (Denmark et al, 2010;
Hollis et al, 2010).

Therefore, we aimed to establish a novel and specific animal
model of SAD using the social
fear conditioning (SFC)
paradigm, and use this model to assess the therapeutic
efficacy of diazepam and paroxetine, currently used for SAD
patients. The SAD-like phenotype was induced in naı¨ve mice
by punishing them when investigating an unfamiliar con-
specific. Mice were conditioned to associate a shock-induced
pain with the investigation of a social stimulus and, therefore,
avoid social stimuli. The conditioned social fear is specific to
several social stimuli, long-lasting and not accompanied by
changes in general anxiety, depressive-related behavior, and
locomotion. The social fearful phenotype was dose-depen-
dently reversed by acute diazepam, at a dose that was not
anxiolytic in a non-social context, ie, the elevated plus maze
(EPM). Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment also
reversed social fear, validating the SFC model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

Male CD1 mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) weighing
30–35 g were individually housed in polycarbonate cages
(16 (cid:2) 22 (cid:2) 14 cm) for 1 week before experiments started,
and remained isolated throughout. Isolation was shown to
increase social motivation (Niesink and Van Ree, 1982) and
prevent the attenuation of behavioral effects of stressors
observed in group-housed mice (Ruis et al, 1999; Cherng
et al, 2010). Mice were transferred to observation cages
(30 (cid:2) 23 (cid:2) 36 cm) 3 days before experiments started. Age-
and weight-matched male CD1 mice were used as social
stimuli.

Mice were maintained under standard laboratory condi-
tions (12:12 light/dark cycle, lights on at 0600 hours, 221C,
60% humidity, food and water ad libitum). Experiments
were performed during the light phase, between 0800 and
1200 hours, in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the Government of Oberpfalz
and the guidelines of the NIH.

SFC Paradigm

On day 1, mice were conditioned for social fear, whereas on
days 2 and 3 or 15 and 16, social investigation was assessed
as readout of short- and long-term social fear and fear
extinction.

a

SFC was

computerized

performed with

fear
conditioning system (TSE System GmbH, Bad Homburg,
Germany). The conditioning chamber consisted of a
transparent Perspex box (45 (cid:2) 22 (cid:2) 40 cm) enclosed in a
wooden chamber to reduce external noise and visual stimu-
lation. The floor consisted of a removable stainless steel
grid connected to a shock delivery unit used for manual
application of foot shocks. A video camera at the top of the
chamber enabled video recording.

Neuropsychopharmacology

SFC (day 1). Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber
and, after a 30-s adaptation period, an empty wire mesh
cage (7 (cid:2) 7 (cid:2) 6 cm) was placed as a non-social stimulus near
one of the short walls. Mice were allowed to investigate the
non-social stimulus for 3 min, before it was replaced by an
identical cage containing an unfamiliar male mouse.
Unconditioned mice were allowed to investigate the social
stimulus for 3 min. Conditioned mice were given a 1-s
electric foot shock (0.7 mA, pulsed current) each time they
investigated the social stimulus, defined by direct contact
with the mouse. Mice received between 2 and 5 foot shocks,
with a variable inter-shock interval, depending on when
direct social contact was made. The first social contact and
foot shock occurred within 15–30 s. Mice were returned to
their home cage when no further social contact was made
for 2 min, meaning that conditioned mice spent between 3
and 6 min in the conditioning chamber while the social
stimulus was present. The time mice spent investigating the
non-social stimulus, as a pre-conditioning measure of non-
social anxiety, was analyzed using the JWatcher program
(V 1.0, Macquarie University and UCLA).

Extinction (day 2 or 15). To investigate whether condi-
tioned mice displayed social fear and whether this fear
could be extinguished, social investigation was assessed
in the home cage 1 or 15 days after SFC for short-term
and long-term social fear, respectively. In detail, extinction
consisted of exposing the mice to three empty cages
identical to the cage used during day 1 (non-social stimuli)
to assess non-social investigation. Mice were then exposed
to six unfamiliar male mice enclosed in wire mesh cages
(social stimuli) to assess social investigation. Each stimulus
was placed near a short wall of the home cage and presented
for 3 min, with a 3-min inter-exposure interval. Reduced
social
investigation and aversive responses toward the
social stimuli, such as freezing, stretched approaches, and
defensive burying indicated social
fear and successful
conditioning of social fear. As the empty cage elicited a
fear response in conditioned mice, an empty cage was
placed over night in the home cage to extinguish the fear of
the cage.

Extinction recall (day 3 or 16). To investigate whether
repeated exposure to social stimuli during extinction
leads to a complete reversal of social fear, social investi-
gation was assessed in the home cage 1 day after extinction.
Extinction recall consisted of exposing the mice to six
unfamiliar social stimuli for 3 min, with a 3-min inter-
exposure interval.

Specificity of the Induced Social Fear

One day after SFC, we performed the EPM and the forced
swim test (FST) to assess general anxiety-related and
depressive-like behavior, respectively (Lister, 1987; Pellow
et al, 1985; Slattery et al, 2005). Further, we assessed home
cage locomotor activity as described previously (Reber et al,
2007; Slattery et al, 2011;
for experimental details see
Supplementary Methods). Moreover, we assessed the effects
of SFC on novel object investigation, and the effects of foot
shocks on social fear.

Novel object investigation. Novel object and social investi-
gation were assessed in the home cage 1 day after SFC to
differentiate between fear of novelty and social fear. Mice
were exposed to three non-social stimuli,
three cages
containing a white ball (novel object stimuli, size and color
matched to the social stimuli), and three unfamiliar social
stimuli. Each stimulus was presented for 3 min, with a
3-min inter-exposure interval.

Electric foot-shock exposure. To assess the effects of foot-
shock exposure in the absence of a social stimulus on social
fear, mice were placed in the empty conditioning chamber
and, after a 30-s adaptation period, received five electric
foot shocks (1 s, 0.7 mA, pulsed current, ie, the maximum
number received during SFC), with a 2-min inter-shock
interval. Mice were returned to their home cage 2 min after
the last foot shock. An empty cage was placed in their home
cage over night to allow for comparable behavioral effects
with SFC. One day later, social investigation was assessed
during extinction.

Drugs. Diazepam (Ratiopharm GmbH, Germany) was
freshly dissolved in saline and administered intraperitone-
ally (i.p.) at a volume of 5 ml/kg and doses between 0.5 and
1.25 mg/kg. The highest doses were chosen based on
previous studies (Corbett et al, 1993; Dalvi and Rodgers,
1996; Stachowicz et al. 2008).

Paroxetine (Bayer Schering, Germany) was administered
over 14 days via the drinking water at a dose of 10 mg/kg/
day. The paroxetine dose was chosen based on previous
studies (Da-Rocha et al, 1997; Hascoe¨t et al, 2000a, b; Masse´
et al, 2005; Elizalde et al, 2008; Thoeringer et al, 2010).

Experimental design

Effects of SFC on Short- and Long-Term Social Fear. Initial
experiments were designed to characterize the effects of SFC
on short- and long-term social fear. Therefore, separate
groups of mice were subjected to SFC and social investigation
was assessed 1 or 15 days later during extinction (n ¼ 13 per
group for short- and n ¼ 9 per group for long-term effects).
Extinction recall was measured 1 day later.

Specificity of
the Induced Social Fear. To verify the
specificity of the induced social fear, separate groups of
mice were subjected to general anxiety (EPM; n ¼ 8 per
group), depressive-like behavior (FST; n ¼ 8 per group),
home cage locomotion (n ¼ 7 per group), or novel object
investigation (n ¼ 8 per group) testing 1 day after SFC.
Another group of mice was exposed to electric foot shocks
in the absence of the social stimulus, and social investiga-
tion was assessed 1 day later during extinction (n ¼ 8 per
group).

Reversal of Short- and Long-Term Social Fear by
Acute Diazepam and Chronic Paroxetine Treatment,
Respectively. To determine whether the effects of SFC on
short- and long-term social
fear could be reversed by
medication used for SAD patients, we assessed the effects of
diazepam and paroxetine, respectively. Mice (n ¼ 10 per
group) were subjected to SFC. The following day, 30 min

before extinction, mice were injected i.p. either with vehicle
(5 ml/kg saline) or with diazepam (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and
1.25 mg/kg). Extinction recall was measured 1 day later. To
determine whether diazepam has anxiolytic effects in a non-
social context at doses used to reverse social fear, naı¨ve
mice were injected i.p. either with vehicle (5 ml/kg saline) or
with diazepam (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg/kg) 30 min before
EPM testing. In a separate group of mice (n ¼ 8 per group),
social
investigation was assessed 15 days after SFC.
Paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day) was administered chronically
via the drinking water over 14 days, starting 1 day after
SFC to prevent possible confounding effects on fear
memory consolidation. Extinction recall was measured
1 day later.

Statistical Analysis. For statistical analysis PASW/SPSS
(Version 17) was used. Data were analyzed by Student’s
t-tests, one-way or two-way ANOVA for repeated measures,
followed by a Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis whenever
appropriate. Statistical significance was set at po0.05.
Overall statistics are shown in Table 1.

RESULTS

Effects of SFC on Short- and Long-Term Social Fear

Short-term social fear. Mice showed similar pre-condition-
ing non-social anxiety (Figure 1a, Table 1). One day after
SFC, conditioned mice showed similar non-social investi-
gation, but reduced social investigation (po0.05, Figure 1b)
compared with unconditioned mice. No difference
between the mice was found during extinction recall
(Figure 1c).

Long-term social fear. Mice showed similar pre-condition-
ing non-social anxiety (Figure 2a, Table 1). Fifteen days
after SFC, conditioned mice showed similar non-social
investigation, but reduced social
investigation (po0.05;.
Figure 2b) compared with unconditioned mice. In contrast
to short-term social fear, conditioned mice still showed
reduced social
investigation during extinction recall
(po0.05, Figure 2c).

Specificity of the Induced Social Fear

No effect of SFC on general anxiety, depressive-like
behavior, and home cage locomotion. Conditioned mice
showed no changes in general anxiety (percentage of
time on open arms; Figure 3a, Table 1) or locomotion on
the EPM (number of closed arm entries; Figure 3c), in
depressive-like behavior in the FST (percentage immobility;
Figure 3b), or in home cage locomotion (distance moved;
Figure 3d) compared with unconditioned mice 1 day
after SFC.

No effect of SFC on fear of novelty. Mice showed similar
pre-conditioning non-social anxiety (Figure 4a, Table 1).
One day after SFC, conditioned mice showed similar non-
social and novel object investigation, but reduced social
investigation (po0.01; Figure 4b) compared with uncondi-
tioned mice.

reversing social fear because of their sedative properties
(see Table 2 for details). However, these higher doses were
not sedative on the EPM and caused a dose-dependent
anxiolysis (see Table 2). Mice showed similar pre-con-
ditioning non-social anxiety before treatment (Figure 6a,

both short- and long-term specific fear of social stimuli, and
that this fear sensitizes over time. Furthermore, SFC does
not induce other behavioral changes that might account for
the observed social fear, such as fear of novelty, increased
general anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and impaired
fear is dose-
locomotion. We further show that social
dependently reversed by acute diazepam; at a dose that is
not anxiolytic in a non-social context. Finally, we show that
chronic paroxetine treatment reverses social fear, similar
to the best outcomes in SAD patients, validating the SFC
model. Therefore, the SFC model represents a unique and
novel model to gain a better understanding of the under-
lying etiology of SAD and to test compounds with novel
mechanisms of action that could provide better treatment
outcome for patients.

Neuropsychopharmacology

Despite its prevalence and symptom severity, the etiology
of SAD remains poorly understood, due in part to a lack of
appropriate animal models. Currently, lasting social anxi-
ety/avoidance in both rats and mice is induced by two main
traumatic stress procedures, namely social defeat and foot-
shock exposure. Social defeat is used both acutely- one
defeat by a dominant male and chronically- repeated defeat
by several dominant males (for reviews see Huhman, 2006;
Yan et al, 2010). Foot-shock exposure is used as exposure to
a single (Short and Maier, 1993; Siegmund and Wotjak,
2007) or to repeated foot shocks (Haller and Bakos, 2002;
Louvart et al, 2005; Mikics et al, 2008a). Although social
defeat and foot-shock exposure decrease social investiga-
tion, they also lead to behavioral alterations including
increased general anxiety, depression, and impaired loco-
motion that might account for the observed social deficit
(Denmark et al, 2010; Hollis et al, 2010). Furthermore, in
the case of acute social defeat, the induced social avoidance
is generally directed toward the con-specific that performed
the defeat (Lai et al, 2005; Lukas et al, 2011). Although such
models are useful and have improved our understanding of
SAD, there is a need for animal models that lead to specific
social fear, without any confounding behavioral alterations,
to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SAD.

frequently (Thorndike, 1933; White, 1989). SFC implies
punishing naı¨ve mice when investigating a con-specific and
results in fear and avoidance of social stimuli. The social
fearful phenotype is expressed in reduced investigation of
social stimuli and intense aversive responses toward them,
such as freezing (absence of movement except that required
for respiration, Fanselow, 1980), stretched approaches, and
defensive burying (Table 3). Although all these behaviors
have been linked with increased anxiety and fear,
the
reduced social investigation was the most robust indicator
of social fear in our paradigm and, therefore, the one we
focused on. Furthermore, as none of the unconditioned
mice showed freezing, stretched approaches, or defensive
burying, by using social investigation as the main readout of
social fear direct comparison with unconditioned mice is
possible.

To evaluate the effects of SFC on social fear, we used a
modified version of the social approach/avoidance para-
digm (Berton et al, 2006), where we first exposed mice to
non-social stimuli,
ie, empty cages to exclude possible
confounding effects due to fear of the cage itself. As the
stimulus mouse used during SFC was enclosed in a cage
that was identical to the cages used as non-social stimuli
during extinction, the cage additionally served as a cue and,
therefore, elicited a fear response in conditioned mice
(Table 4). However, this fear was extinguished by placing
the empty cage in the home cage of the mice over night. As
non-social
investigation was not decreased in condi-
tioned mice after extinguishing the fear of the cage, it is
unlikely that fear renewal to the cage occurred and thereby
decreased social
investigation (Table 4). Furthermore,
exposure to non-social stimuli during extinction did not
affect the level of social investigation in either conditioned

Decreased social investigation (SI) represents the percentage of conditioned mice in each experiment that showed a decrease of at least 50% in investigation of the
first social stimulus compared with the mean of their respective unconditioned mice during extinction. Freezing, stretched approaches, and defensive burying represent
the percentage of conditioned mice that showed those behaviors when the social stimuli were in their home cage during extinction. None of the unconditioned mice
showed these behaviors. Data from Figures 6 and 7 include only conditioned vehicle-treated mice.

or unconditioned mice (Table 4). Therefore, to allow for a
within-individual assessment of non-social and social fear,
mice were exposed to both non-social and social stimuli

throughout the experiments. For assessing social investiga-
tion, mice were repeatedly exposed to different unfamiliar
individuals were used for two
con-specifics. Different

reasons. First, we aimed to obtain a reversal of social fear
in general and not a reversal of fear toward a specific
individual. Second, we aimed to maintain high interest in
the social stimuli as repeated exposure to the same con-
specific has been shown to decrease social interest in both
mice (Ferguson et al, 2002; Choleris et al, 2009) and rats
(Thor et al, 1982; Popik and van Ree, 1998). This exposure-
like paradigm is similar to exposure therapy during CBT in
humans, where patients are repeatedly exposed to the feared
situation.

SFC induced both short- and long-term specific fear of
investigation increased with each
social stimuli. Social
exposure to the social stimuli, indicating gradual social fear
extinction, which is similar to the outcome during CBT
in SAD patients (Clark et al, 2003), and extinction after cued
and context fear conditioning in mice and rats (Myers and
Davis, 2002). When the extinction procedure was performed
1 day after SFC, social fear was completely reversed by
the next day, during extinction recall. However, when the
extinction was performed 15 days after SFC, conditioned
fear during extinction recall,
mice still showed social
indicating that the social fear sensitized over time. Previous
studies also showed sensitization of fear responses over time
after single or repeated foot-shock exposure (Siegmund and
Wotjak, 2007; Mikics et al, 2008a), suggesting that the
circuitry underlying the conditioned social fear not only
remains stable, but may even strengthen over time. More-
over, the maintenance of social fear over both the short- and
long-term not only offers the possibility to test medication
with fast onset of action, such as benzodiazepines, but also
with a delayed onset of action, such as antidepressants (Katz
et al, 2006; Mitchell, 2006; Priest, 2006).

Unlike acute social defeat, SFC induced a general fear
of social stimuli, which was not limited to the stimulus
to which the mouse has been conditioned, but extended to
unfamiliar social stimuli as well. This general social fear is
similar to the general social avoidance induced by chronic
social defeat (Avgustinovich et al, 2005; Berton et al, 2006),
where several dominant males are consecutively used to
defeat a subordinate animal (Miczek, 1979; Rodgers and
Randall 1986; Kabbaj et al, 2001). However, chronic social
defeat also increased general anxiety (Keeney and Hogg,
1999; Avgustinovich et al, 2005; Berton et al, 2006; Denmark
et al, 2010), decreased locomotor activity (Koolhaas et al,
1997; Rygula et al, 2005), and induced a depressive-like
phenotype (Avgustinovich et al, 2005; Rygula et al, 2005;
Berton et al, 2006; Hollis et al, 2010). Correspondingly,
these behavioral changes might account for the decreased
social investigation observed. Unlike chronic social defeat,
SFC induced a specific fear of social stimuli without induc-
ing changes in general anxiety on the EPM, depressive-like
behavior in the FST, or in home cage and novel environ-
ment (EPM) locomotion. We could also show that the
induced social fear was specific to a social stimulus, as novel
objects that were similar in size and color to the social
stimuli did not induce fear responses in conditioned mice.
Thus, in future studies it would be interesting to compare
treatments that are effective in the SFC paradigm in such
social defeat models to determine their specificity.

The SFC model involves the use of aversive stimuli, in this
case electric foot shocks. Previous studies have shown that
foot-shock exposure alone decreased social investigation for

1441

both short- and long-term, however, only when assessed in
a novel environment (Short and Maier, 1993; Haller and
Bakos, 2002; Haller et al, 2003; Louvart et al, 2005; Leveleki
et al, 2006; Siegmund and Wotjak, 2007; Mikics et al,
2008a, b). When social investigation was assessed in the
home cage, no differences were found, suggesting that the
former result is due to novelty-induced anxiety (Mikics
et al, 2008a). Shock exposure also increased general anxiety
and decreased locomotion and exploratory behavior in the
open field and EPM (Van Dijken et al, 1992; Bruijnzeel et al,
2001; Pijlman and van Ree, 2002; Kavushansky et al, 2009),
indicating that the decreased social investigation observed
after foot-shock exposure may rather be due to an increase
in general anxiety. Our paradigm assessed the experimental
mice in their home cage, which reduces the possibility of
novelty-induced anxiety. Moreover, we did not observe
changes in home cage social investigation when mice were
exposed to foot shocks in the absence of the stimulus
mouse, indicating that the fear induced during SFC is a
result of the association between the experienced pain and
investigation of a con-specific rather than a direct result of
foot-shock exposure.

(diazepam) and antidepressants

Having shown the specificity of the fear induced during
SFC, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of benzodiaze-
pines
in
reversing social fear in our model. Although b-blockers
can be beneficial in humans, their efficacy is limited to
performance anxiety (Faigel, 1991; Liebowitz et al, 1992),
therefore we did not assess them in the SFC paradigm.

(paroxetine)

Acute diazepam treatment dose-dependently reversed
short-term social fear, without further increasing social
investigation in unconditioned mice. Doses 40.5 mg/kg
(0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg/kg) had sedative effects in the home
cage and even reduced investigation in unconditioned mice,
counter indicating, therefore, their use in the SFC paradigm
(Table 2). Diazepam reversed social
fear at a dose
(0.5 mg/kg) that did not alter general anxiety on the EPM
(Table 2). We could only demonstrate anxiolytic effects of
diazepam on the EPM at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, confirming
recent findings (Hascoe¨t et al, 2000a). The sedative effect of
doses 40.5 mg/kg diazepam might not have been observed
in previous studies, as the increased arousal level in novel
environments, such as the EPM, open field, and light-dark
box, may have masked the sedative effect of diazepam.

Chronic paroxetine treatment, started 1 day after SFC
to prevent possible confounding effects on fear memory
consolidation, was also successful in reversing long-term
social fear, without further increasing social investigation in
unconditioned mice. However, acute SSRI
treatment
increased social fear in conditioned mice (data not shown).
This is in line with data showing that SSRI treatment
reduces cued fear after chronic treatment, but increases
cued fear after acute treatment (Burghardt et al, 2004, 2007).
All in all, the reversal of social fear by medication used for
SAD patients provides predictive validity to the SFC model.
Finally, it is of interest to note that the use of the SFC
model is not restricted to male CD1 mice, as shown in this
study. Preliminary data have shown that the paradigm can
also be used successfully in inbred lines such as C57/Bl6,
and in a different species, namely Wistar rats (data not
shown). This further demonstrates the utility of the novel
paradigm for gaining a better understanding of the etiology

of SAD. Moreover, SFC has not been used to induce social
fear in female mice or rats yet, which, however, would be
promising given the higher prevalence of SAD in women
(Schneier et al, 1992; Talepasand and Nokani 2010).

In summary, we have established a novel SFC paradigm
that induces specific and long-lasting fear of social stimuli
in naı¨ve mice, and shows both face and predictive validity to
SAD. The induced social fear is specific to several social
increased
stimuli and not the result of fear of novelty,
general anxiety, depressive-like behavior, or
impaired
locomotion. Our model might, therefore, be used to gain a
better understanding of the underlying causes and mechan-
isms of SAD in humans and also to test compounds with
novel mechanisms of action that could provide better
treatment outcome for these patients.
