Abstract

Premarital (and general relationship) education programs, as a prevention method, have been 
shown to have a positive effect on marital quality and can prevent divorce. However, it is unclear 
whether these positive effects are consistent across leaders who conduct premarital education 
programs. Examining the variability in relationship outcomes attributed to the leaders of 
premarital education programs, and the role of general therapeutic factors such as working alliance 
in explaining relationship outcomes, may help increase the effectiveness of these programs. 
Accordingly, this study examined 31 leaders who trained 118 couples (236 attendees) in a 
randomized clinical trial of PREP, a research-based and empirically supported premarital 
education program being compared to a treatment as usual track. The results demonstrated that 
couples’ relationship outcomes from pre to post training varied based on the leader who provided 
the premarital education training. Both training in PREP and aggregated leader working alliance 
quality (as rated by attendees) explained variability between leaders in change in attendees’ 
observed negative and positive communication. Leaders’ aggregated working alliance quality also 
explained change in relationship satisfaction. Additionally, attendees’ ratings of their leaders’ 
working alliance predicted change in their relationship satisfaction and confidence, and attendees 
had higher positive communication when they reported better working alliance with their leader.

Premarital education programs, which generally include communication and problem-
solving skills training and education about risk and protective factors related to healthy 
relationships, have been shown to produce small to medium-sized effects for improving 
relationship quality and communication skills (Hawkins, Blanchard, Baldwin, & Fawcett, 
2008). Additionally, survey research indicates that having some form of premarital

education is associated with a lower divorce rate (Stanley, Amato, Johnson, & Markman, 
2006). Over the past 30 years, premarital relationship education (and more broadly, 
relationship education with non-married and married couples) research has moved from 
clinical trials to dissemination trials with services being provided in the community (e.g., 
Markman et al., 2004). For instance, the effectiveness of variants of the Prevention and 
Relationship Education Program (PREP; Markman, Stanley, & Blumberg, 2010) has been 
supported in experimental and quasi-experimental studies (e.g., Halford et al., 2001; 
Markman, Renick, Floyd, Stanley, & Clements, 1993; Stanley, Allen, Markman, Rhoades, 
& Prentice, 2010). Research suggests that PREP delivered by lay and clergy leaders in 
religious organizations can be as effective as university-trained PREP leaders (Laurenceau, 
Stanley, Olmos-Gallo, Baucom, & Markman, 2004; Markman et al., 2004, Stanley et al., 
2001). As research on PREP and other relationship education programs continue to grow, 
the field will need a greater understanding of the degree to which community leaders differ 
in their ability to assist couples using relationship education.

In the psychotherapy research, it is well known that therapists vary in their ability to provide 
services (e.g., Crits-Christoph et al., 1991; Lutz et al., 2007; Wampold & Brown, 2005). For 
instance, research from various clinical settings (e.g., outpatient, inpatient) and research 
designs (e.g., naturally occurring treatment, randomized clinical trials) has demonstrated 
that, on average, 3% to 10% of the variance in client outcomes are due to therapists (Crits-
Christoph et al.; Dinger et al., 2008; Lutz et al.; Wampold & Brown). To place these 
estimates in perspective, other predictors of client outcomes, such as specific techniques and 
working alliance—or the agreement between the client and therapist on the goals for 
treatment and the methods or procedures used to reach those goals, as well as the emotional 
or relational bond between client and therapist—are of similar magnitude (i.e., 5-8%; 
Horvath & Bedi, 2002; Wampold, 2001). Thus, the empirical focus on specific interventions 
and common factors, such as working alliance, should be balanced with a direct examination 
of those who are providing the treatments.

Despite the growing focus on therapist effects in psychotherapy, it is unclear if the 
psychotherapy model for exploring therapist effects generalizes to relationship education. 
Research should begin to elucidate what leader factors are associated with the highest 
competency and the best couple outcomes. This information could then be used in improve 
the delivery of relationship education. As such, the current study utilized data from a 
randomized clinical trial on PREP vs. treatment as usual (TAU) (see Wilmoth et al., 2010 
for discussion of TAU in premarital education) to explore leader effects in premarital 
relationship education. These data are ideal for tests of leader variability in many ways. 
First, randomization was at the leader level (as compared to the couple level). Second, the 
study included a large number of leaders, enhancing the power to detect effects at the leader 
level (Maas & Hox, 2005). Third, this study assessed a variety of relationship outcomes, 
which will allow us to examine whether leaders play a larger role in some outcomes, such as 
behavioral change versus attitudinal change. Specifically, we will examine how much 
variance in both participant-report and observational coding of couple functioning is 
attributable to premarital education leaders and to leader-specific characteristics, 
specifically, being trained in PREP and aggregate working alliance.

Psychotherapy research has identified various factors that can account for the differences in 
client outcomes observed between therapists. Crits-Christoph et al. (1991) meta-analyzed 15 
studies and found that use of treatment manuals accounted for a sizeable proportion of the 
variance in therapist effects. Researchers have also examined whether being trained in a 
specific type of treatment (e.g., cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic) accounts for therapist 
effects. Multiple studies now show that therapist effects are not accounted for by the type of 
treatment (e.g., Crits-Christoph et al., 1991; Kim et al., 2006), but none of these compared 
training in a manualized treatment to no training or TAU. Related to the current study, being 
trained in PREP could account for a sizable proportion of the variance in leaders’ 
competency, which would support the importance of training leaders in empirically-
supported prevention methods.

Alternatively, variability among leaders in their couples’ outcomes could be due to other 
factors, such as their general ability to form strong working alliances with their clients. 
Developing strong working alliances have been related to positive therapy outcomes in 
individual, couple, and family therapy (e.g., Friedlander, Escudero, Horvath, Heatherington, 
Cabero, & Martens, 2006; Johnson & Talitman, 1997; Pinsof et al., 2008). Moreover, client 
ratings of working alliance are generally a better predictor of therapy outcomes than 
therapist reports of working alliance (Horvath & Bedi, 2002). Yet, some therapists are 
consistently better at forming high quality working alliances with their clients than others. 
Between 6% (Marcus, Kasky, & Baldwin, 2009) and 30% (Dinger et al., 2008) of variance 
in clients’ ratings of working alliance can be attributed to the therapist. Therapists who form 
stronger alliances with their clients generally demonstrate better psychotherapy outcomes 
(Baldwin, Wampold, & Imel, 2007). In fact, therapists’ aggregate working alliance accounts 
for approximately 97% of the variability in outcomes between therapists (Baldwin et al., 
2007). Consequently, leaders’competency may relate to a general ability to develop 
collaborative relationships and engage in meaningful, goal-directed work with couples, 
regardless of the specific techniques employed.

Oftentimes, the contribution of therapists’ aggregate working alliance quality and the 
interventions they are trained to employ cannot fully be disentangled (see Elliott, Greenberg, 
& Lietaer, 2004). Thus, being trained in PREP could increase leaders’ ability to use specific 
techniques to assist couples improve their relationship functioning and may enhance leaders’ 
ability to foster collaboration and engagement in the educational process. For instance, one 
of the first activities in PREP is to discuss couples goals for their relationship and the 
program. Additionally, PREP encourages leaders to discuss the rationale for using specific 
techniques (i.e., communication skills training), which may enhance alignment between the 
leader and couple. Both of these elements are fundamental to fostering a sound working 
alliance (Horvath & Bedi, 2002). Given recent efforts to increase therapists’ attention to the 
working alliance (see Barber, 2009; Anker et al., 2009), it is worth considering that 
empirically-supported treatments may also positively influence leaders’ general working 
alliance ability.

Relationship education delivered to couples includes an extra, complicating factor because 
two linked individuals receive an intervention at once. To our knowledge, no studies have 
examined cross-partner effects of working alliance on relationship outcomes. In the only

known study examining working alliance in relationship education, Bourgeois, Sabourin, 
and Wright (1990) found that clients’ ratings of working alliance related to better marital 
outcomes, but they conducted separate analyses for men and women, making inferences 
about the relative influence of partners’ ratings of working alliance on marital outcomes 
difficult to interpret. Researchers often address the dependency between partners’ scores by 
conducting separate analyses for men and women (e.g., Bourgeois et al., 1990; Horvath & 
Symonds, 2004). This approach fails to capture the ways in which partners may influence 
one another and it does not provide a direct test of gender differences in the association 
between alliance and outcomes. It could be the case that working alliance is more important 
for men or women, but we cannot know this information unless gender is included in our 
models.

Currently, there is limited information on gender differences in the association between 
alliance and outcomes. Some couple therapy studies have found that men’s ratings of 
alliance are a more reliable predictor of therapy outcomes than their wives’ (e.g., Horvath & 
Symonds, 2004), but others suggest the opposite pattern (e.g., Pinsof et al., 2008; Quinn, 
Dotson, & Jordan, 1997). Beyond these studies, we know that women are more likely to 
initiate therapy services and discussions about relationship issues, suggesting that they may 
be more engaged or committed to the enhancement of the relationship as compared to men 
(Anker, Duncan, & Sparks, 2009; Gottman, Carrere, Swanson, & Coan, 2000). Thus, as men 
become more engaged in the relationship education program, their female partners may react 
positively and benefit more from the interventions. Given the mixed findings from the 
couple therapy literature on partner and gender effects, the current study tested for gender 
differences and examined the influence of partners’ ratings of working alliance on 
relationship outcomes.

Hypotheses

Based on previous research (Dinger et al., 2008; Wampold & Brown, 2005) we expected 
that leaders would account for a small to medium (e.g., 3% to 9%) proportion of the 
variance in relationship outcomes (measured by observational coding of positive and 
negative communication and participant-reported relationship adjustment and confidence) 
and leaders would account for a medium to large proportion of the variance in participant-
reports of working alliance (hypothesis 1). We also predicted that both the leaders’ 
aggregate working alliance and being in trained in PREP would account for significant 
portions of the variance across leaders in relationship outcomes (hypothesis 2). Next, we 
predicted that leaders who were trained in PREP would have higher working alliance scores 
than leaders in the TAU condition (hypothesis 3). Lastly, we predicted that participants own 
perceptions of working alliance, as well as their partners’, would be positively related to 
their own relationship outcomes, after controlling for intervention status (i.e., PREP vs. 
TAU; hypothesis 4).

We used data collected as part of randomized controlled trial of PREP (see Markman et al., 
2004; Stanley et al., 2001). In this effectiveness trial, participants received either the

premarital training services that were naturally occurring (TAU) at the religious organization 
that would perform their wedding, PREP delivered by a leader at their religious organization 
(RO-PREP), or PREP at a university (U-PREP).

Participants

Premarital training participants—Though the larger project originally included 306 
couples (612 participants), our sample was smaller because of several necessary exclusions. 
First, we excluded leaders and associated participants from the U-PREP track (n = 121 
couples) because the combination of leaders who conducted the U-PREP sessions changed 
across the sessions in a way that made it impossible to match participants and leaders. 
Additionally, we excluded leaders (and subsequently the participants trained by them) who 
only educated one couple (n = 20 couples). We made this choice because it is necessary to 
have multiple participants per leader to determine if participants who were treated by the 
same leader had similar outcomes. Thus, of the original 306 couples, 131 met the initial 
criteria for the current study. Of these, we only included couples who completed both the pre 
and post-intervention assessments (90.1%), resulting in a final sample of 118 couples (n = 
236 participants). Seventy-four couples (n = 148 participants) were in the RO-PREP track, 
and 44 couples (n = 88 participants) were in the TAU track. All couples were engaged or 
planning marriage at the pre-intervention assessment. Participants had a median age of 26, a 
median level of education of 16 years, and a median annual individual income of 
$20,000-29,999 (median income would be $26,300-39,500 in 2010 U.S. dollars). 
Participants identified themselves as 79.2% White, 15.7% Hispanic, 2.1% Black or African 
American, 2.1% Asian American, and 0.4% Native American; 0.4% did not specify their 
race or ethnicity. At the couple level, 75.4% of couples included two White partners; 24.6% 
included at least one partner who was an ethnic or racial minority.

Leaders—Thirty-one premarital education leaders or leader pairs provided services for the 
118 couples in this study. At some locations there were two leaders who provided the 
services, thus there was a total of 47 leaders. The average number of couples per leader/
leader pair was 3.81 (SD = 2.46). The leaders did not consistently report their demographic 
information, but basic information about the leaders is known for 78.7% (n = 37). They were 
64.9% clergy (e.g., priest, pastor, or minister), with the others being church staff, lay leaders, 
or affiliated counselors. On average they were 49.32 years old (SD = 11.78). All had some 
prior experience with premarital training and/or counseling couples (M = 16.55 years, SD = 
11.10). More than half of the leaders were male (62.5%) and they were predominately White 
(94.7%).

Religious organizations in a large Western city that served 400 members or more and 
conducted four or more weddings per year were recruited between 1997 and 2002 to take 
part in the larger study. After learning about the project and agreeing to send at least four 
premarital couples for participation, each religious organization was randomly assigned to 
U-PREP, RO-PREP, or TAU. Those in the RO-PREP condition sent their premarital training 
providers (leaders) to training in PREP and agreed to provide PREP to couples participating 
in this research. U-PREP and TAU leaders were offered free training in PREP as

compensation for their participation after four couples from their organization completed 
pre-intervention assessments.

The interventions received in the TAU and PREP conditions are described in detail in 
elsewheres (Markman, et. al, 2004; Stanley et al. ,2001) so they are only briefly described 
here. PREP (Markman et al., 2010) is a research-based and empirically-supported 
psychoeducational curriculum for couples designed to teach communication and conflict 
management skills as well as skills and principles to increase positive connections (e.g., fun 
& friendship) and deepen transformative aspects of relationship (e.g., commitment, 
forgiveness). Teaching PREP involves using lectures, discussions, activities and videotaped 
examples of real couples showing negative and positive patterns of interactions. All 
participants receive workbooks to follow along and for homework. Participants who were 
included in the current study received PREP from a leader at the religious organization that 
would perform their wedding and typically completed two weeknight sessions and one 
weekend day-long session. Training typically lasted 12 hours in the PREP condition.

Participants in the TAU condition received the premarital services that were naturally 
occurring at the religious organization that would perform their wedding. These services 
varied across religious organizations. Stanley et al. (2001) classified TAU services as: (a) 
discussing the wedding, (b) completing standardized personality tests such as the PREPARE 
(Olson, Fournier, & Druckman, 1989) or FOCCUS instruments (Markey, Micheletto & 
Becker, 1985), (c) participating in lectures or discussion of various topics related to marriage 
(e.g., communication, family planning, finances, etc.), (d) completing both standardized 
assessment and attending lectures, or (e) completing both standardized assessment and 
attending lectures that also integrated some communication skills training. Premarital 
training typically lasted from less than 1 hour up to 7 hours in the TAU condition.

Couples in all conditions visited a university for a pre-intervention assessment (pre) and for 
a post-intervention assessment (post) approximately eight weeks later. At each 1.5 hr visit, 
they completed questionnaires and a videotaped interaction. They were paid $40 for each 
assessment. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and all procedures were 
approved by a university-based Institutional Review Board. For the larger project, 
participants returned for annual follow-ups after post, but we only used pre and post data in 
the current study.

Relationship adjustment—We used the 16-item Marital Adjustment Test (MAT; Locke 
& Wallace, 1959) to assess relationship adjustment. The scale asks clients to rate the 
frequency of disagreement in several areas, general happiness, similarity in the desire to 
spend time together, and thoughts of leaving the relationship. Internal consistency was 
somewhat low in the current sample (for women, α = .60; for men, α = .59), but it has been 
shown to be reliable and valid in other samples (e.g., Crane, Allgood, Larson, & Griffin, 
1990). The low internal consistency for our sample may have been due to a restriction of 
range in the items, as most couples reported high levels of relationship satisfaction, as might 
be expected for premarital couples.

Observed positive and negative communication—The Interactional Dimensions 
Coding System, a global coding system for couples’ discussions of relationship problems 
(Kline et al., 2004), was used to code couples’ videotaped interactions. Intercoder reliability 
was high, with intraclass correlations ranging from .66 to .95 (Mdn = .87; Kline et al., 2004). 
For this study, we used a positive subscale (made up of communication skills, support/
validation, problem solving, and positive affect; α = .88 for women; .90 for men) and a 
negative subscale (made up of withdrawal, denial, conflict, dominance, and negative affect; 
α = .86 for women; .88 for men).

Relationship confidence—We used the 10-item Confidence Scale (Stanley, Hoyer, & 
Trathen, 1994) to measure couples’ confidence that they can effectively manage their 
relationship and stay together. A sample item is “I believe we can handle whatever conflicts 
will arise in the future.” Items were rated on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly 
Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree) with higher scores indicating more confidence in the 
relationship, α = .83 for women and .79 for men. Confidence Scale scores have been shown 
to be related to other relationship and individual characteristics and outcomes in meaningful 
ways (see Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009; Whitton et al., 2007).

Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form—(WAI-S, Tracey & Kokotovic, 1989). The 
WAI-S is a client rated measure of working alliance that consists of 12 items that assess 
goals and tasks for therapy as well as the relational bond between the client and therapist. 
These items were rated on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 
(Strongly Agree) with higher scores indicating a better working alliance. The WAI-S is a 
commonly used measure of working alliance and the reliability and validity has been 
demonstrated in numerous studies comparing the WAI-S to other working alliance scales 
and therapy outcome (see Horvath & Bedi, 2002 for a review). The language was adjusted to 
reflect the premarital education context (Wilkens, 1998). Example items are: “[leader name] 
did not understand what I wanted to accomplish in premarital training (reverse-coded)” and 
“I felt that [Leader] appreciated me.” Some couples took premarital education with two 
leaders; working alliance scores for the two leaders were highly correlated (r = .86) so we 
used an average of the scores in our analyses. This measure was given at post, α = .84 for 
men and .82 for women.

Because of the interdependencies in the data structure (individuals nested within couples and 
couples nested within leaders), we chose to use three-level multilevel regression models for 
the central analyses. These analyses were conducted using Hierarchical Linear Modeling 
6.04 (HLM6; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2005). Preliminary analyses 
indicated that outcomes for couples who had two leaders did not differ from those with one 
leader.

To test our first hypothesis, that leaders would account for a small to medium proportion of 
the variance in relationship outcomes and a medium to large proportion of the variance in 
working alliance, we conducted a baseline model for each relationship outcome measure 
(observed positive and negative communication, relationship satisfaction, and relationship

confidence) and working alliance. For the baseline models examining relationship outcomes, 
the post relationship outcome measure was entered as the dependent variable, controlling for 
pre-education relationship functioning at level 1 (grand mean centered). Based on the 
variance estimates in these models, we calculated the variability between leaders. To 
calculate the ICC-leader for working alliance, we conducted similar models wherein and 
working alliance was the dependent variable with no predictor variables. There was no pre-
education variable included in this model because this measure reflects experiences related 
to the relationship education program. The results from the baseline models showed that 
leaders accounted for 1.3% to 10.5% of the variance in relationship outcome variables and 
29% of the variance in working alliance scores (see Table 1). These results partially support 
our first hypothesis and generally suggest that leaders accounted for a proportion of variance 
in their participants’ relationship outcomes.

We tested our second hypothesis, that both the leaders’ aggregate working alliance and 
being in trained in PREP would account for a portion of the variance across leaders in 
relationship outcomes, by adding PREP-trained or aggregate working alliance to level 3 of 
the baseline models described above. We first tested PREP-trained and working alliance in 
separate models. Next, we included both variables in a model simultaneously. The first row 
in Table 2 shows the results from the baseline model for the leader effects. The second row 
shows the variance in relationship outcomes explained by the leader after accounting for the 
variance explained by being trained in PREP and the third row shows leader variance 
remaining after accounting for leaders’ aggregate working alliance ability. Finally, the last 
row demonstrates the variance remaining when both training in PREP and alliance were 
entered in the model.

The results demonstrated that both leaders’ aggregate working alliance and PREP-training 
status accounted for the majority of the variance in leaders’ contribution to the reduction in 
negative communication and increase in positive communication. The variability between 
leaders for relationship satisfaction was low (1.3%) and leaders’ aggregate working alliance 
explained the majority of this variability. In contrast, neither working alliance nor being 
trained in PREP explained a significant amount of the variance in the leader effects for 
change in confidence. These results partially support our second hypothesis.

Next, we tested our prediction that leaders who were trained in PREP would have higher 
working alliance scores than leaders in the TAU condition (hypothesis 3) in a model in 
which working alliance was the dependent variable and PREP-training status (TAU or 
PREP) was the predictor at level 3. We controlled for participants’ gender at level 1. 
Although there was not a significant difference in working alliance scores between leaders 
in the RO-PREP and TAU conditions (γ = 0.43, SE = .26, p = .10), the effect size for the 
difference between the two groups was of medium size (d = 0.56). Leaders trained in PREP 
had an average working alliance score of 5.78 (SD = 0.60) compared to 5.40 (SD = 0.82) for 
leaders in the TAU condition. Thus, the significance test did not support our hypothesis but 
the means follow the predicted direction. A post-hoc power analysis revealed low power 
based on the leader sample size and this effect-size (power = .32, two-tailed), which may 
have hampered our ability to detect a significant effect.

Finally, with regard to our fourth hypothesis, we tested if participants’ and their partners’ 
perceptions of working alliance predicted relationship outcomes after controlling for PREP-
training status. We used both partial correlations and multilevel models to test this 
hypothesis. Table 3 shows the partial correlations between participants’ and their partners’ 
working alliance and relationship outcomes (at post) after controlling for pre relationship 
functioning. (Note that these correlations do not account for the variance at the leader level 
or intervention status.) These partial correlations suggest that men’s alliance scores were 
significantly related to their own positive and negative communication and confidence at 
post; whereas women’s alliance scores were only related to their own negative 
communication at post. Women’s alliance scores were significantly related to their partners’ 
negative communication and relationship satisfaction scores at post (controlling for pre) and 
men’s alliance scores were related to their partners’ positive and negative communication at 
post. Participants’ working alliance scores were moderately correlated with their partners’ 
working alliance scores (r = .67). To directly test for gender differences as well as control 
for intervention status, we needed a more sophisticated test.

For the multilevel models of cross-partner effects, we used Actor-Partner Interdependence 
Models (APIMs; Kashy & Kenny, 2000). APIMs examine the mutual relationship between 
partners, accounting for the dependence between partner’s scores, and can directly test for 
gender differences. That is, the commonalities between partners in their scores on any 
variable are accounted for and subsequently separate analyses for men and women are not 
needed. Thus, we used relationship outcomes as dependent variables and participants’ own 
gender, pre relationship functioning, and working alliance, as well as partners’ working 
alliance scores and the interactions between participants’ own gender and their own and 
their partners’ working alliance scores as predictor variables. All of these variables were 
entered at level 1 and were grand-mean centered. We included PREP training status at level 
3 (grand-mean centered) and we allowed the level 1 variables to be vary across leaders.

As summarized in Table 4, the results for positive communication demonstrated that 
participants’ own working alliance scores (i.e., actor effects) were not significantly related to 
change in positive communication, but their partner’s working alliance scores were, 
controlling for all other variables in the models. These relationships were consistent for men 
and women (i.e., there were no significant gender interactions). In the model for negative 
communication, neither actors’ working alliance nor their partners’ working alliance were 
related to negative communication at post, after controlling for the variance in the other 
predictors. Additionally, those in the RO-PREP condition demonstrated less negative and 
more positive communication at post than those in the TAU condition, controlling for all 
other variables in the model.

The next model examined relationship satisfaction as the dependent variable (Table 4). 
Actors’ working alliance was significantly related to relationship satisfaction at post and this 
relationship was consistent for men and women. There was no significant relationship 
between partners’ working alliance scores and relationship satisfaction at post, nor was 
intervention a significant predictor of satisfaction, controlling for other variables in the 
model.

Lastly, the APIM examining confidence indicated that actors’ working alliance scores 
significantly predicted their own confidence post, but there were no significant effects of 
partner’s scores, nor any significant interactions between gender and working alliance 
scores. Similar to the relationship adjustment model, intervention status was not a significant 
predictor of confidence at post, controlling for all other variables in the model. Collectively, 
these results on cross-partner effects of working alliance partially support our fourth 
hypothesis.

Discussion

As we expected, leaders accounted for a meaningful proportion of the variability in most 
relationship outcomes. Specifically, leaders accounted for a significant percentage of the 
variability in change in observed positive and negative communication (5.2% and 4.5%, 
respectively) and in self-reported confidence in the future of the relationship (10.5%). For 
relationship adjustment, leaders accounted for less variability (1.3%). These magnitudes are 
similar to those found in studies examining the proportion of variability in outcomes 
attributable to therapists in individual therapy (e.g., Crits-Christoph et al., 1991; Wampold & 
Brown, 2005). Leaders also accounted for a large proportion of the variance in working 
alliance (29%), which is similar to Dinger et al.’s (2008) finding that therapists accounted 
for nearly 30% of the variance in working alliance in an inpatient treatment setting and 
higher than the 6% found in Marcus et al.’s (2009) study with therapists at university 
counseling centers The fact that leaders are associated with working alliance scores (as rated 
by couples) supports the assumption that couples are not merely reflecting their own 
relationship tendencies in their ratings, but that they are meaningfully coding characteristics 
of their relationship education leaders.

Taken together, our results suggest that the leaders providing premarital education services 
seem to make a meaningful difference in not only the way the attendees rate them, but also 
in couples’ relationship outcomes. Although the proportion of variance attributed to leaders 
was modest in absolute terms, the amount of change in couples’ outcomes attributed to 
receiving empirically-supported premarital education services (vs. control) are of similar 
magnitude (i.e., approximately 2.2% to 5.9% of the variance; Hawkins et al., 2008). Our 
findings about the variance accounted for by leaders suggests there may be ways to increase 
the impact that the intervention has on couples, through helping leaders to be more effective 
by attending more closely to alliance with their couples. For instance, leaders should be 
aware of couples’ goals for their relationship and work actively to match the content for any 
specific session with these goals. Additionally, leaders’ interpersonal warmth may be 
exhibited by showing interest in couples before and after classes and by inviting of 
responses from them during classes.

Given that we examined two leader factors (i.e., being trained in PREP or aggregate working 
alliance) that may account for the variability between leaders in relationship outcomes, it is 
important to understand the relationship between these two constructs. Barber (2009) 
espoused that through training in an intervention, therapists (or leaders in this case) may 
learn effective strategies to assist clients reach their goals as well as improving their 
emotional bond with them. Although we found that leaders who were trained in PREP did

not have statistically significantly higher working alliance scores than TAU leaders, the 
medium effect size for the difference between these groups suggests that with a larger 
sample of leaders, those trained in PREP might show higher levels of working alliance. 
Further research is needed before drawing firm conclusions about whether PREP can 
increase working alliance quality.

Because leaders accounted for part of the variance in their couples’ relationship outcomes, 
we tested whether being trained in PREP and leaders’ aggregate working alliance would 
explain the differences between leaders. The variability between leaders for negative and 
positive communication was about equally explained (and nearly all of the variance was 
explained) by knowing whether leaders were trained in PREP and by leaders’ aggregate 
working alliance ability. This finding highlights the dual importance of common process 
factors and specific factors. These results parallel previous studies of individual therapy 
outcomes (e.g., Crits-Christoph et al., 1991) by showing that the utilization of a standardized 
treatment (i.e., PREP) explains some of the variability between leaders. Part of the PREP 
curriculum emphasizes structured communication skills to manage negative emotions 
constructively and foster positive communication (Markman, Rhoades, Stanley, Ragan, & 
Whitton, 2010), which may be why having been trained in PREP explained differences 
between leaders in couples’ communication outcomes, but not in couples’ relationship 
adjustment or confidence. However, many relationship education programs do not find pre-
post effects on relationship satisfaction or adjustment because most couples are highly 
satisfied during this premarital stage (Halford, Markman, & Stanley, 2008). Most 
importantly, these findings suggest that training leaders in specific intervention strategies 
(e.g., communication skills) is important, but so may be training them to be effective 
instructors, as leaders’ aggregate working alliance also explained variability in 
communication outcomes attributed to leaders. Thus, leaders’ ability to foster collaborative 
and purposeful alliances with couples was as important as the specific method employed. 
Leaders may want to monitor their working alliances (e.g., using verbal check-ins or 
working alliance measures) to ensure that they are sufficiently working collaboratively with 
the couples they serve (Anker et al., 2009).

We also found that the variability between leaders for attendees relationship confidence was 
not explained by their aggregate working alliance ability or by whether a leader had been 
trained in PREP. These findings raise questions about the ways in which leaders contribute 
to their couples’ confidence in maintaining a healthy relationship and using the skills they 
have learned. It could be that leaders somehow convey a sense of confidence in a couple’s 
relationship, independent of working alliance, and that this confidence is associated with the 
couple’s own confidence. Other unmeasured characteristics of leaders may also influence 
couple confidence. Future research is needed to better understand this finding.

Lastly, we examined whether participants’ own and their partners’ ratings of working 
alliance uniquely predicted relationship outcomes, over and above having received PREP 
versus TAU. Similar to what Stanley et al. (2001) found using the same data set, but without 
examining working alliance or controlling for leader effects, we found that receiving PREP 
(versus TAU) predicted both positive and negative communication change from pre to post, 
even after accounting for participants’ working alliance scores. These findings suggest an

additive benefit for couples who received PREP, beyond their working alliance with their 
leaders, which also assisted their communication quality. However, working alliance also 
benefited participants’ positive communication indirectly through their partners’ view of the 
alliance. That is, partners’ working alliance scores were related to positive communication at 
post. It could be that as participants became more engaged with their leaders, their partners 
developed more positive sentiments and were more likely to react positively to the 
information they were learning. Participants’ ratings of working alliance were also related to 
increased confidence in their relationships and higher relationship adjustment. The 
collaborative process with the leader during the program may have enhanced participants’ 
attitudes that they will be able to continue the progress after the program. Additionally, prior 
work has shown that working alliance is related to a capacity to develop attachments to other 
people (see Horvath & Bedi, 2002), thus, the association between working alliance and 
relationship adjustment may reflect a general ability to form and attend to relationships.

The current findings should be interpreted with recognition of the study’s limitations. First, 
our sample included fairly well-adjusted couples seeking wedding services at religious 
organizations. While most couples marry through religious organizations (Stanley et al., 
2006) and premarital services are intended to assist couples who may not need intensive 
services, the degree to which our results will replicate in other settings is unknown. Second, 
we had sparse data about the leaders’ demographic characteristics, allowing us to only test 
two leader-level variables to explain variability between leaders. Future research should 
continue to explore other leader characteristics that may account for leader effects, such as 
leaders’ teaching ability. Third, we only had participants’ ratings of working alliance. 
Leaders’ perceptions of working alliance could provide additional information about the 
relational aspects of the alliance-outcome effects. We also adapted the WAI for this context, 
thus further validation of this instrument is warranted. Future research should consider 
testing whether specific training in fostering working alliance in premarital education could 
affect outcomes. Fourth, because alliance was assessed at post, we were unable to 
disentangle the directionality of the alliance-outcome association. Finally, we did not have 
information about the length of time couples knew the leader prior to the training and the 
TAU group did not have a set protocol or a matching length of time for premarital 
education, which may have influenced working alliance ratings. Yet, in practical terms the 
use of TAU group provides a useful comparison to the services that are naturally occurring.

As relationship education programs become disseminated to leaders in the community, the 
training of leaders in systematic empirically-supported interventions could have many 
benefits (Markman et al., 2004). Yet, these programs should balance the focus of specific 
techniques with a focus on the quality of the relationship between leaders and couples. As 
this is one of the first studies to examine working alliance in relationship education, future 
research should continue to consider how alliances are formed with couples in these 
programs.

The random slopes for positive and negative communication and for relationship adjustment were all non-significant (ps > .05). For confidence, the 
Gender × Actor and Gender × Partner Working Alliance interaction significantly varied across leaders, (variances = 0.03, and .04, ps < .01, 
respectively)
