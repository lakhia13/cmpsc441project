Background

There is no clear evidence about how to support people with
borderline personality disorder (BPD) during the perinatal period.
Perinatal emotional skills groups (ESGs) may be helpful, but their
efficacy has not been tested.

Aims
To test the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial
(RCT) of perinatal ESGs for women and birthing people with BPD.

Method

Two-arm parallel-group feasibility RCT. We recruited people from
two centres, aged over 18 years, meeting DSM-5 diagnostic cri-
teria for BPD, who were pregnant or within 12 months of a live
birth. Eligible individuals were randomly allocated on a 1:1 ratio
to ESGs + treatment as usual (TAU), or to TAU. Outcomes were
assessed at 4 months post randomisation.

Results
A total of 100% of the pre-specified sample (n = 48) was recruited
over 6 months, and we obtained 4-month outcome data on 92%
of randomised participants. In all, 54% of participants allocated to
perinatal ESGs attended 75% of the full group treatment (median
number of sessions: 9 (interquartile range 6–11). At 4 months,
levels of BPD symptoms (adjusted coefficient −2.0, 95% CI −6.2
to 2.1) and emotional distress (−2.4, 95% CI −6.2 to 1.5) were

lower among those allocated to perinatal ESGs. The directionality
of effect on well-being and social functioning also favoured the
intervention. The cost of delivering perinatal ESGs was estimated
to be £918 per person.

Conclusions

Perinatal ESGs may represent an effective intervention for peri-
natal women and birthing people with BPD. Their efficacy should
be tested in a fully powered RCT, and this is a feasible
undertaking.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common mental disorder
associated with enduring psychosocial impairment and a suicide
rate that is 45 times higher than in the general population.1 The
perinatal period poses particularly difficult challenges for women
and birthing people diagnosed with BPD. They are more likely to
experience adverse pregnancy outcomes, including higher rates of
gestational diabetes, preterm birth and delivering babies with
lower Apgar scores.2 Following childbirth, they may experience
high levels of distress precipitated by the increased demands asso-
ciated with having a baby.3 Furthermore, their children are at
increased risk of psychological problems and of being taken into
care.4–6 Yet, currently there is no clear evidence about how to
help them during the perinatal period.7

Supporting people with BPD during the perinatal period

Currently in the UK, people with BPD receive standard perinatal
mental healthcare, consisting of an assessment, care plan and
regular reviews.8 However, this fails to account for the complexity
of needs associated with BPD and may be associated with iatrogenic
harm, including off-licence prescribing of medication.9 BPD is
treatable using structured psychological treatment, such as dialect-
ical behaviour therapy (DBT).10 However, the current trial evidence
is derived exclusively from non-perinatal populations. In addition,

treatments such as DBT are lengthy and expensive to deliver and
geographically, access to such interventions is extremely variable.11
DBT includes both individual and group work; the group work con-
sists of facilitated skills-training groups. These groups teach indivi-
duals how to deal more effectively with emotions and relationships,
and when delivered as a stand-alone intervention, they may help
people with BPD,12 although definitive evidence of efficacy is
lacking. A recent systematic review12 identified three small rando-
mised controlled trials of DBT-informed skills groups for non-
perinatal populations which showed evidence of moderate effect,
considered clinically important, for BPD severity (standardised
mean difference, SMD −0.66, 95% CI −1.08 to −0.25, n = 3
studies, n = 184 participants) and psychosocial functioning (SMD
−0.45, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.16, n = 3 studies, n = 184 participants).
Yet none of the studies included perinatal populations, and the
overall quality of the evidence derived from these three trials was
graded as low.

DBT skills groups have been adapted for a variety of clinical
populations, including ‘high-risk’ mothers,13 as well as for people
with BPD during the perinatal phase.14 Emotion regulation skills
groups (ESGs) can be delivered online (thereby increasing access
to treatment for those in remote locations) and are popular with
patients and clinicians working in perinatal mental health teams.
However, there is no robust evidence to support the efficacy of

perinatal ESGs. Testing this would require conducting a fully
powered clinical trial, yet it is unclear whether such a trial is feasible.
Recruitment and retention of participants into clinical trials is
always challenging,15 and these challenges are likely to be com-
pounded during the perinatal period, when there are additional
physiological and psychological demands on potential participants.
In this paper, we report findings from a study investigating the feasi-
bility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of perinatal
ESGs, as an adjunct to treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU alone
for people with BPD.

Method

Study design

We conducted a two-arm parallel group feasibility RCT with a 16-
week follow-up (trial registration: ISRCTN 80470632). A nested
qualitative evaluation was embedded within the trial, to enhance
insight into participants’ experiences of the study and the interven-
tion. A more detailed description of the protocol has been published
previously.16

Setting and participants

Study participants were recruited from one perinatal mental health
service in South East London and one service in South West
England. Both services included areas of high deprivation, ethnic
diversity and high rates of psychiatric morbidity. Within each
service, the principal investigator was asked to seek the consent of
potentially eligible people to be contacted for screening into the
study. To take part, potential participants had to be aged 18 years
or over; either pregnant (from week 15 of gestation onwards) or
within 12 months of having a live birth; and likely to have a diagno-
sis of BPD.

We excluded people not meeting screening criteria for BPD (see
the screening assessment list in the next section) as well as the fol-
lowing groups:

a. Those with a diagnosis of a coexisting organic, psychotic mental

disorder or substance use dependence syndrome.

b. Those with cognitive or language difficulties that would pre-
clude them from providing informed consent or compromise
participation in study procedures. Participants also had to
have good command of English to participate in the study.
This was because, for those randomised to perinatal ESGs, it
was not possible to run synchronous multilingual online
groups. In addition, we were limited to carrying out assessments
in English, as the outcome scales had not all been translated or
validated in other languages.

c. Those posing an acute risk to their baby, as assessed by

clinicians.

d. Those requiring admission to a mother and baby unit.
e. Those who did not have internet access, as this was a require-

ment to access the intervention.

If the principal investigator believed that an individual was
likely to meet the eligibility criteria, they provided verbal and
written information about the study and determined whether the
person agreed to being contacted by a member of the research
team. Individuals were offered a copy of a patient information
sheet which explained that if they agreed to share their details
with the research team, the initial step would involve participating
in a telephone or online screening interview. The contact details
and preferred method of contact were then passed on to the trial
manager, who arranged a time to conduct a screening interview
with individuals who consented to be contacted.

Screening assessment of potential participants

The screening assessment consisted of three elements:

a. The

self-report Standardised Assessment of Personality
Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS)17 to assess for the presence of prob-
able personality disorder. We excluded people who scored less
than 3 on the SAPAS.

b. The researcher also completed a 15-item BPD checklist with the
person,18 confirming the presence or absence of DSM symptoms
of BPD. In keeping with diagnostic guidelines,19 participants
needed to positively endorse at least 5/9 of the symptom
domains covered by the 15 items to be eligible for the trial.
c. The researcher checked whether the individual was willing and
able to receive perinatal ESGs if they were randomised to this.

Following the eligibility check and prior to commencing the
baseline assessment, the researcher obtained the written consent
of all eligible people relating to their participation in the trial.
Consent was obtained via an online e-consent method, and partici-
pants were emailed an electronic copy of their e-consent form.

Interventions

Those in the intervention arm of the trial were offered perinatal
in addition to standard perinatal mental healthcare.
ESGs
Participants receiving ESGs continued to be cared for as usual by
their perinatal mental health team. Perinatal ESGs were delivered
online as
specified in the Maternal Emotional Wellbeing
manual.20 The intervention comprises two 1-h individual prepara-
tory sessions, followed by twelve 2-h group sessions. The individual
preparatory sessions involved establishing specific, individually tai-
lored, behavioural-specific goals for the group intervention, and
increasing motivation to attend and apply the skills to daily life,
as well as an opportunity to meet the facilitators and ask questions.
Groups were organised into three modules consisting of emotion
regulation, distress tolerance and interpersonal effectiveness, with
mindfulness components throughout. Each session was supplemen-
ted with ‘keeping baby in mind’ which focused on utilising the skills
as a parent of a new child, with reflections on child development.
Mindfulness is a foundation skill that supports the individual to
become aware of thoughts, feelings, urges and body sensations in
a non-judgemental way as they are occurring. Emotional regulation
depends on the ability to name emotions and assess if they ‘fit the
facts’ of a particular situation to then prepare for appropriate emo-
tional expression and problem-solving. Emotional regulation skills
also include skills to increase emotional resilience, such as sleep
hygiene, regular exercise and a healthy diet. Many of these lifestyle
domains change significantly during the transition into parenting,
making this a particularly important topic to cover at this time.
Distress tolerance skills are designed to support skilful survival of
challenging times when immediate problem-solving is not possible.
The final set of skills explore interpersonal effectiveness, making
new friends, and expressing and making requests in skilful ways
that keep relationships and self respect. The transition into early
years parenting typically involves significant changes in friendship
groups and handling new social scenarios. Each group session
included time to reflect and review the application of the skills in
daily life to support the strengthening and generalisation of the
skills.

Participants were constantly encouraged to consider how their
application of skills would impact on their interactions with their
babies (born and not yet born). Each DBT skill session dedicated
a minimum of 15 min at the end of each class where application
of the skill to infants and the parent–infant relationship was dis-
cussed and rehearsed. In the general teaching component of the
class (45 min), skills trainers utilised examples relevant to the

2

perinatal period to teach the essential elements of the skills. In the
homework review component (1 h), participants were encouraged
to discuss issues in relation to their infants, their parental role and
their support structures (partner and familial relationships).

The aim of the intervention was to assist participants to learn
and implement skills to address challenges in their everyday life,
and so the focus was on the acquisition and strengthening of emo-
tional skills in the context of the typical day-to-day experience of
looking after an infant. Although there was a teaching component,
participants were actively encouraged to speak, and react to and val-
idate other participants’ efforts. In addition, multiple strategies were
utilised to optimise engagement in the online group work. In the
individual preparatory meetings, each participant was asked to
reflect on strategies they might need to use to stay engaged with
group discussion, particularly if their baby needed soothing or
there were other distractions. In the first session, rules and expecta-
tions were clearly laid out, including the need to always keep video
cameras on and work hard with active listening. In the spirit of dia-
lectics, facilitators also validated the challenge of juggling child care
alongside participating in the groups. Finally, homework and skills
practice tasks were assigned each week, and this (along with group
feedback from other participants) provided facilitators with an
opportunity to monitor individuals’ engagement with skills devel-
opment each week.

The groups were run by a clinical psychologist working with
another qualified perinatal clinician. All therapists were employed
by the local NHS Trusts for the duration of the study. Staff were
trained to deliver perinatal ESGs through a 2-day online workshop
led by co-author M.S. who is a recognised trainer in DBT. Once a
week, an online Microsoft Teams consultation meeting was held
between recruiting centres, to promote sharing of good clinical
practice through peer monitoring and encouragement. The group
facilitators monitored and recorded the participants’ ESG attend-
ance using Excel spreadsheets which were shared with the trial
manager at the end of treatment. Participants who missed three
consecutive ESG sessions were considered to have dropped out of
treatment.

TAU was standard perinatal mental healthcare, delivered on an
individual basis by staff working in the specialist perinatal commu-
nity mental health team. It was delivered in accordance with current
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Royal
College of Psychiatry guidelines,21 and consisted of assessment, a
written care plan and regular reviews with a care coordinator. In
addition to assessment and regular reviews with a care coordinator,
standard care could include individual
therapy, occupational
therapy, nursery nurse interventions and video interaction guid-
ance. We did not restrict access to these therapies. However, parti-
cipants randomised to TAU were not able to access other group-
based interventions providing related emotional skills training.

Randomisation

After consenting to participation and completing assessments, eli-
gible individuals were randomly allocated on a 1:1 ratio to either
perinatal ESGs + TAU or to TAU alone. The randomisation
sequence was generated by the Research Electronic Data Capture
Service (REDCap) at the University of Bristol (https://brtcclinical.
bris.ac.uk/redcap/). Randomisation was
stratified by centre.
Throughout the study, the randomisation list was encrypted and
held with the trial coordinating office. The trial manager informed
participants and clinical teams of the participants’ allocation status.
It was not possible to blind participants or treating clinicians to the
participants’ treatment allocation because of the nature of the inter-
vention; however, the statistician and health economist were blind
to the trial condition throughout the study.

Measures

At baseline, we collected the following sociodemographic informa-
tion on all participants: relationship status, age, ethnicity, highest
education level attained, living arrangements and current employ-
ment status. They were also asked about whether they were in the
antenatal or postnatal period.

Study participants completed the following outcome measures

at baseline and again at 2 and 4 months post randomisation:

a. Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder Self-
Report Scale (ZAN-BPD)22 – a validated measure of symptoms
experienced by people diagnosed with BPD over the past week.
b. Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE-10)23 – a brief

measure of psychological distress.

c. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol-5
Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) – a descriptive system and a
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for health-related quality of life
states in adults.24

d. Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing

Scale
(SWEMWBS) – a reliable25 7-item scale of mental well-being
covering subjective well-being and psychological functioning.
e. Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)26 – a simple, reliable
and valid measure of impaired functioning that is sensitive to
change.

f. Parenting Stress Scale (PSS)27 – a self-report measure of an indi-
feelings about positive and negative aspects of

vidual’s
parenthood..

g. Self-harming behaviour was assessed using a single question:
‘Have you [in the past week] deliberately taken an overdose
(e.g. of pills or other medication) or tried to harm yourself in
some other way (such as cut yourself)?’28

h. A resource questionaire to examine patterns of health and social

care service use.

Qualitative evaluation

After completing treatment and all quantitative follow-up assess-
ments, a purposive sample of participants was invited to participate
in individual semi-structured interviews. Sixteen trial participants
and five therapists completed these interviews at the end of the
intervention. The sample included participants from both arms of
the trial (intervention arm: n = 10; TAU: n = 6), as well as indivi-
duals who were pregnant (n = 5) and those who were postnatal
(n = 11) at recruitment. The interviews were audi-recorded and
facilitated using a topic guide. Trial participant interviews focused
on their views about the acceptability of study procedures and
experiences of treatment. Staff interviews focused on the research
process, the value of training and supervision, and the potential
effects of perinatal ESGs. Consenting trial participants were
offered a £20 voucher to reimburse their time and effort for
completing the qualitative interviews.

Adverse events

All adverse events were assessed for seriousness, causality and
investigator, and recorded and
expectedness by the principal
reported from the point of consent (baseline assessment) until the
4-month follow-up assessment or the point of withdrawal from
the study. Hospitalisations for elective treatment of a pre-existing
condition were not reported as serious adverse events.

Data management

Web-based electronic case report forms were used to collect baseline
and outcome data. No data analysis was undertaken until the data-
the participants’
bases were locked. Trial staff ensured that

3

Moran et al

anonymity was maintained through protective, secure handling and
storage of participant information at the trial centres. All data and
study documents were stored on a secure database at the university
coordinating centre.

Data analysis
In keeping with recommendations for feasibility studies,29 we did
not base plans for sample size on a power calculation. We judged
that a sample size of 48 would allow us to estimate, with a desirable
degree of precision, the rate of recruitment and retention in a future
definitive trial. Our criteria for determining the success of the feasi-
bility study were recruitment of at least 36 participants (75% of the
target sample), uptake of treatment (predefined as 75% of sessions)
by at least 75% of participants in the intervention arm, and comple-
tion of 4-month follow-up assessments by 75% of the target sample.
Since this was a feasibility trial, the study was not designed to
detect statistically significant differences between the two groups.
Therefore, the primary analyses were descriptive, concentrating
on participant characteristics, completeness of follow-up data and
adherence to treatment. Data were analysed and reported following
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guid-
ance extension to feasibility studies,30 including a CONSORT flow
diagram. Despite the lack of formal powering, exploratory tests
were performed to compare the study groups. Between-arm com-
parisons were made under the intention-to-treat
framework.
Given the clustered nature of data derived from the group partici-
pants, a partially clustered model (modelling the clustering in the
intervention arm) using a linear mixed effects model was estimated.
This was undertaken using restricted maximum likelihood with a
Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom correction (recommended for
small sample size and/or small number of clusters) on treatment
allocation. The estimate was adjusted for baseline value of the
outcome and site, with a random intercept for each group in the
intervention arm and one intercept for the control arm (i.e.
partial clustering); this also allowed for heteroskedastic errors
between treatments arms. Results are presented as adjusted differ-
ence in means alongside associated 95% CI; the treatment effect esti-
mate is also presented as a standardised effect size for completeness.
A reflexive thematic approach was used to analyse the qualita-
tive data because of its flexibility and pragmatism in helping us to
derive an understanding of the range of experiences and responses
to the interventions and study procedures. A preliminary deductive
coding framework was developed based on concepts discussed in
the interview topic guide. Sub-codes were then derived inductively
through an open coding of the content of each area. Themes and
subthemes were regularly presented to the senior qualitative
researcher (L.B.) and chief investigator (P.M.) to ensure the emer-
ging analysis was trustworthy and credible. The framework was
refined, with coded material regrouped, as new data from subse-
quent interviews was gathered and a deeper level of understanding
achieved.

The cost of delivering perinatal ESGs was calculated as the
product of applicable healthcare unit cost(s)31 and staff time
involved. To determine the feasibility of data collection of the
resource use components, we explored the availability of data
from perinatal mental health team records, as well as the complete-
ness of resource use questionnaire data.

Results

Between 15 September 2022 and 29 March 2023, 64 people were
referred into the study, of whom 48 people were deemed eligible
and consented to participate, equating to a consent rate of 75%.
Of the 48 who met eligibility criteria and were randomised, 24
were allocated to perinatal ESGs + TAU, and 24 to TAU alone.
Four months post randomisation, 92% of participants in both
arms completed the 4-month follow-up assessment. A CONSORT
diagram displaying participant flow is displayed in Fig. 1.

Baseline characteristics of the recruited sample are displayed in
Table 1. The trial’s arms were well balanced on participant charac-
teristics. The majority of participants (71%) were White; 17% were
from mixed/multiple ethnic groups, 10% were Black, and 2%
reported being from another ethnic group. The median number
of BPD symptoms was 9 (where the maximum score is 9) and
median CORE-10 score was 25, corresponding to moderately
severe levels of emotional distress.

For those randomised to the intervention arm, the median
number of perinatal ESG sessions attended was nine (interquartile
range 6–11). In all, 3/24 (13%) participants allocated to the interven-
tion attended all 12 sessions (i.e. 100% of the course). A total of 13/
24 (54%) participants allocated to the intervention attended at least
nine sessions (i.e. 75% of the course) and 19/24 (79%) participants
allocated to the intervention attended at least six sessions (i.e. 50% of
the course). Two participants attended no sessions, and of these one
withdrew from the study after randomisation; one was withdrawn
from the intervention after non-attendance of the first three ses-
sions. Three participants were withdrawn from the intervention
because they did not attend three consecutive sessions (as per treat-
ment protocol). Where recorded, a range of practical reasons were
given for missed sessions, including giving birth, baby being ill
and having to attend a general practitioner (GP) or hospital
appointment. The reasons provided did not indicate that non-
attendance was related to the unacceptability of the trial or interven-
tion, nor because of perceived ineffectiveness (or effectiveness) of
the intervention.

Table 2 presents 2- and 4-month follow-up scores. At both
2- and 4-month follow-up, levels of BPD symptoms and emotional
distress were lower among those allocated to perinatal ESGs.

Table 3 displays the results from regression analyses of the

4-month follow-up data.

The coefficients represent the average effect of the intervention
on outcome domains at end of treatment. In the case of the ZAN-
BPD-SR, the coefficient of −2.0 indicates that on average, at 4
months post randomisation, the ZAN-BPD scores of those allocated
to perinatal ESGs were 2 points less than those in the control arm.
Putting this into a clinical context, the minimum clinically import-
ant difference (MCID) for the ZAN-BPD-SR is a 3.5-point reduc-
tion in score.32 The direction of
the
proposed primary outcome (ZAN-BPD-SR) favoured the interven-
tion; the upper bound of the 95% CI included the MCID for treat-
ment effectiveness, while the lower bound excluded an MCID

favouring control. This was consistent across other clinical out-
comes, whereby the direction (CORE-10, WEMWBS and WSAS)
favoured the intervention. The health-related quality of life mea-
sures were equivocal with the direction of the EQ-5D-5L favouring
the intervention, whereas the EQ-5D VAS favoured the control. The
confidence intervals of all the estimates crossed the null value,

indicating that none of the findings were statistically significant at
the 5% level.

Three serious adverse events were recorded during the trial – two
in the intervention arm and one in the control arm. All the events were
hospital admissions for physical or mental health conditions, and
none of these were thought to be related to the trial.

a. Restricted to those with baseline data.

The estimated average cost of delivering perinatal ESGs was
£918 per participant; this is in addition to any costs associated
with providing TAU. Completeness of resource data collection
was high: from 100% of participants at baseline and 91% of partici-
pants at 4 months. The data sources indicated that as well as peri-
natal mental health contacts, community health (GP, health
visitor, midwifery) and mental health prescribing all contributed
to costs and should be collected in any future economic evaluation.
The qualitative data provided further support for the positive
impact of perinatal ESGs on improving the mental health and
social functioning of perinatal people with BPD. All the interviewed
participants allocated to the intervention arm reported that the peri-
natal ESGs had made a positive impact on their mental health. In
particular, they expressed feeling better equipped with skills to navi-
gate relationships and regulate their emotions:

‘A massive impact. I mean, I am completely different I think to
how I was before. I have said to so many different people, like
the whole perinatal team has helped me loads, but this group
has given me so many tools to deal with different … so
many different things. It’s not like it’s sort of just touched
the surface with one thing I was struggling with – it has
made a huge difference to me and I am just so much
happier.’ (SW-029)

Some reported that the skills learned during the groups had

helped them to better express their needs:

‘It’s definitely helping my family life. So, in terms of commu-
nicating with my husband as to how I am feeling, if I need
help with my daughter or if I am struggling with particular
thoughts, it’s helped me kind of one, articulate that better
and two, helping me manage those feelings. So, by communi-
cating with him I can then give myself time properly to do what
I need to do to get myself back and stable.’ (SW-031)

Many of the participants also reported deriving benefit from
being part of a group that helped them to ‘realise I’m not alone
out there’ (LO-009) and identify with others experiencing similar
problems who made them ‘feel like I wasn’t crazy’ (SW-023).

Most of the participants also reported that being in a mixed
perinatal group (i.e. with both pregnant and postpartum people)
was a positive experience because those who had already delivered
their baby could support their pregnant peers by sharing advice
and experiences. All participants reported that the online delivery
of the group was acceptable and appropriate and without major
technical issues. Although one participant expressed a preference
they also mentioned that
for

face-to-face group delivery,

maintaining regular attendance might have been more challenging
in that format.

Staff delivering the groups gave positive feedback about the
supervision and training they had received and reported finding
the consultation meetings with other staff particularly helpful.
Although the online delivery of treatment was convenient for every-
one and helped to optimise attendance, some staff felt that it could
sometimes give sessions a ‘podcast feel’ which needed active man-
agement to prevent people from not fully participating. Regarding
the session duration, all interviewees agreed 2 h was about right
and that 12 sessions fitted conveniently into school terms (which
was a concern for participants with school-age children).

All staff spoke of the positive impact of perinatal ESGs on par-

ticipants’ mental health:

‘We had one person who said that ‘check the facts’ [a modular
component of ESGs] has been, like, lifechanging for her, and,
you know, that she does that all the time now. She questions
whether she’s interpreting a situation with judgements or eva-
luations that get in the way for her. And, like, she just looked
brighter. She’d started going to mum and baby groups. Yeah,
I think she made a lot of progress.’ (SW-Staff-2)

Participants and staff all reported that the study procedures had
been acceptable. Although some TAU participants expressed feeling
initially disappointed with their assigned group and another felt
relief for not being allocated to the ESG (which she would have with-
drawn from), most of the participants reported finding the random-
isation process and communication acceptable and clear:

‘I think I like that it’s random. Because it kind of feels a bit
more equal, if it’s just completely random. I think that’s a
good thing.’ (LO-003)

Discussion

Main findings

Our overarching aim was to investigate whether it is feasible to
undertake a randomised controlled trial of perinatal ESGs for
people with BPD. Our results demonstrate that such a trial is
entirely feasible. We recruited 100% of our pre-specified target
and followed-up 92% of all participants at 4 months. In the inter-
vention group, 54% of participants attended 75% of the 12 sessions,
which was below our 75% target. Notwithstanding, this was a high
bar for determining adherence, and nearly 80% of participants
attended at least half of the group treatment, with high median
attendance of nine sessions (equating to 75% of the 12-session
group course). The trial steering committee overseeing this study
reported that although performance on this criterion fell within
the ‘review’ category, for a perinatal sample of people with severe
symptoms of BPD this represented a very positive achievement
indeed.

There were no statistically significant changes in any of the
patient-reported outcome measures at 4 months post randomisa-
tion. However, the study was a feasibility trial that was not
powered to detect statistically significant differences. Furthermore,
the direction of point estimate for the proposed primary outcome
(ZAN-BPD-SR total score) favoured the intervention and import-
antly, the 95% CI included the clinically important difference for
this measure. This finding was consistent across other patient-
rated clinical outcome measures, which also favoured the interven-
tion. We were also able to demonstrate that a future economic
evaluation appears feasible. From a qualitative perspective, many
of the trial participants spoke favourably about benefits gained in
their mental health and family life that they had achieved through
the perinatal ESGs. The online delivery was acceptable to

7

Moran et al

participants and optimised attendance during a very busy period
in their lives. In addition, the heterogenous make-up of groups
(consisting of both pregnant and non-pregnant people) allowed
those in the antenatal phase to learn from those in the postnatal
phase. We purposefully ran the groups with both antenatal and
postnatal people for several reasons. First, the inclusion of ante-
natal and postnatal participants within the same group reflects
the reality of NHS service delivery where both pregnant and post-
natal people are treated within the same perinatal mental health
team. Second, prior observational work20 shows that it is accept-
able to run groups with both pregnant and postnatal people, and
that most people do not view pregnancy and the postnatal
period as
experience.
Notwithstanding, it is possible that the perinatal stage affects the
benefits and learning experiences derived from ESGs, and future
research should address this through, for example, subgroup ana-
lyses of trial populations.

‘separate’ parts of

their perinatal

Methodological considerations

In terms of strengths, we recruited a sample with high external val-
idity to populations of people with BPD seen by specialist perinatal
community mental health teams. We adopted broad inclusion cri-
teria and a limited number of exclusion criteria. The median
CORE-10 score was 25, corresponding to moderately severe levels
of emotional distress, and the mean mental well-being score
(17; s.d. 8.5) was below the UK general population mean of 23.5
(s.d. 3.9).25 The sample also had functional impairment linked to
moderately severe psychopathology.26 We recruited 100% of our
pre-specified target and obtained post-treatment outcome data on
92% of participants. Taking into account the small sample size,
the participant characteristics were well balanced between trial
arms.

In terms of limitations, to meet the feasibility study objectives,
the length of follow-up was limited to 4 months. However, BPD is
a long-term mental health condition, and it is important to investi-
gate the long-term effect of
interventions on the condition.
Moreover, a definitive trial should investigate the longer-term
impacts of perinatal ESGs on birthing parents and the relationship
with their babies. In keeping with the approach adopted by other
recent trials in the personality disorder field,33,34 we did not
include a detailed assessment of personality disorders. Such assess-
ments are time-consuming to complete and not in keeping with the
needs of a pragmatic study conducted in a busy clinical setting.
Finally, the apparent benefits of perinatal ESGs may have been
because of non-specific factors related to belonging to a group
which we did not measure or adjust for. Any future study should
investigate the moderating effects of group dynamics and thera-
peutic alliance, as well as the mechanism of action of perinatal ESGs.

Implications

Our study has shown that it is feasible and acceptable to conduct a
clinical trial of perinatal ESGs for women and birthing people with
BPD. Furthermore the quantitative and qualitative findings suggest
that perinatal ESGs may have promising effects on mental health
and social functioning, and that the efficacy of perinatal ESGs
should be tested in a fully powered trial.

Ensuring that all birthing parents and their babies receive
timely, more effective and accessible perinatal mental health inter-
ventions is critical because untreated perinatal mental health
issues have serious long-term adverse consequences for both the
parent and the child.35 Although ESGs constitute a brief interven-
tion for people with complex needs associated with BPD, observa-
tional data indicate that brief
for BPD may be
effective.36 Furthermore, trials of brief interventions for people

treatment

with BPD are scarce, and there is a pressing need to enhance the evi-
dence base in this field.33 Ultimately, if people with BPD could be
effectively helped during the perinatal period, they might be able
to practise more effective ways of managing their emotions and rela-
tionships before their babies are exposed to the full range of envir-
onmental risks. In light of this, the NHS is now committed to
‘increasing access to evidence-based care for women with moderate
to severe perinatal mental health difficulties and a personality dis-
order diagnosis, to benefit an additional 24 000 women per year
by 2023/24’.37 Yet, there is a conspicuous lack evidence to inform
the roll-out of plans such as those proposed for the NHS. In this
respect, determining the efficacy of perinatal ESGs for women
and birthing people with BPD should be a research priority, as it
could provide crucial insights for improving mental health services
across the world for this previously neglected population.
