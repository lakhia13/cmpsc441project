It also helps determine how we handlestress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, fromchildhoodandadolescencethrough adulthood andaging.

### What are mental disorders?

Mental disordersare serious conditions that can affect your thinking, mood, and behavior. They may be occasional or long-lasting. They can affect your ability to relate to others and function each day. Mental disorders are common; many Americans will be diagnosed with one at some time in their life. But there are treatments. People with mental disorders can get better, and many of them recover completely.

### Why is mental health important?

- Be physically healthy

- Have good relationships

- Work productively

- Realize your full potential

Your mental health is also important because it can affect your physical health. For example, mental disorders can raise your risk for physical health problems such asstroke,type 2 diabetes, andheart disease.

### What can affect my mental health?

There are many different factors that can affect your mental health, including:

- Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse

- Family history of mental health problems

- Your lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and substance use

You can also affect your mental health bytaking steps to improve it, such as doing meditation, using relaxation techniques, and practicing gratitude.

### Can my mental health change over time?

Over time, your mental health can change. For example, you may be dealing with a difficult situation, such as trying to manage a chronic illness, taking care of an ill relative, or facing money problems. The situation may wear you out and overwhelm your ability to cope with it. This can worsen your mental health. On the other hand, getting therapy may improve your mental health.
