Abstract: Mental health conditions in childhood and adolescence are increasing in the U.S. population
and require early intervention, as highlighted by a recent Surgeon General’s Advisory on Protecting
Youth Mental Health. These health issues, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,
impair functioning, and may lead to longer term reductions in quality of life. Young adolescents
are likely to experience stressors including academic pressure, feelings of loneliness and isolation,
and excessive exposure to social media, all of which have been made worse by the pandemic and
associated disruptions. Universal preventive programs at school serve as an important strategy for
equipping youth with coping skills to address current and future social and emotional challenges.
Yoga and mindfulness programs have emerged as a promising preventive approach for schools and
have proven feasible and acceptable. The current study evaluated a universal, school-based mindful-
ness and yoga program among youth aged 11–14 in a racially diverse, urban setting in the United
States. Outcomes of interest included symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression
symptoms decreased in the intervention group, although these differences were not statistically
signiﬁcant. In the control group, anxiety symptoms decreased but depression symptoms increased.
The resulting time effect indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in anxiety symptoms, while the time by
group effect revealed a strong trend in depression symptoms. Future research should investigate the
utility of yoga and mindfulness interventions for early adolescents in a larger population, and the
differences in intervention effect among subgroups, with attention to longer term outcomes.

Anxiety and depression have become increasingly common among youth in the United
States over the last decade. Estimates from a pre-pandemic national survey indicated that
among children aged 3–17 years, 7.1% had current anxiety problems, 7.4% had a current
behavioral/conduct problem, and 3.2% had current depression, with prevalence of each
disorder being higher at older ages [1]. The lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in U.S.
adolescents is high—with approximately one in every 4–5 youth in the U.S. meeting criteria
for a mental disorder with the potential for severe impairment throughout life, including

poor academic performance, school absenteeism, and other negative health outcomes over
the life course [2]. These ﬁgures, from prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, represented a
steep increase over previous comparable years, and highlight the preexisting severe gap in
addressing problems among youth [3].

Following widespread school closures and the extreme disruption caused by the pan-
demic, mental health issues have markedly increased among youth and their families [4,5].
In addition, higher levels of screen use have been associated with worse mental health
of children and youth during the pandemic [6]. Social media use, economic instability,
mortality, and morbidity due to COVID-19, anti-black racism, climate change, and political
strife also contribute to mental health concerns in this age group [7]. However, despite
increased stressors in recent years, more than 40% of children with anxiety in the United
States reportedly receive no treatment [1]. This gap in access to mental health care [8]
represents a considerable public health problem given the chronic, relapsing nature of
anxiety and depressive disorders, and their debilitating personal, social, and economic
burdens over the life course [9,10].

Early intervention in addressing youth mental health issues has been emphasized as
an important strategy by policymakers and researchers alike. Merikangas and colleagues
highlighted the importance of transitioning the common emphasis on treatment of mental
health disorders in youth to focus on prevention and early intervention [2]. Unaddressed
behavioral health problems may lead to self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Suicide is
one of the leading causes of death for adolescents and is often but not always associated with
pre-existing anxiety and depression [11–13]. Parents and caregivers may not be aware of the
mental health concerns of children in the course of their normal daily routines, including
thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation [14,15]. More than two thirds of suicide deaths
in adolescence and young adulthood have occurred with no previous suicidal behavior,
highlighting the urgent need for early interventions among the general population of young
people to address social and emotional health [16].

Yoga and mindfulness provided through school-based programming may provide
an important opportunity to address social emotional needs of children, and to provide
coping skills, for those who do not receive attention to their behavioral or mental health
through other channels. These programs have become more widespread over the last
decade in the United States [17]. An emerging evidence base justiﬁes interventions uti-
lizing yoga and mindfulness programs (YMP) in the youth population to improve social
and emotional outcomes from early childhood [18] through adolescence [19], including
evidence from randomized controlled trials [20–22]. A systematic review of utilizing yoga
to improve anxiety and depression in youth found that, among studies assessing both
anxiety and depression, 58% of reviewed studies identiﬁed reductions in both conditions,
while 70% of studies assessing anxiety alone showed improvements, and 40% of studies
assessing only depression showed improvements [23]. Yoga has also been found to improve
youth resilience [24], and may enhance coping skills that could bolster young people’s
mental quality of life. Lazarus’ and Folkman’s stress and coping theory provides insight
into the potential for coping as an explanatory mechanism, where they describe it as a
process by which people utilize cognitive and behavioral efforts in managing stressful
situations [25]. In this way, coping is seen as a psychological process focused on persons’
own interpretations of their situation [26].

Children from low-income families are also less likely to be diagnosed and treated for
mental disorders [27], putting them at a further disadvantage given evidence demonstrating
the impact of poverty on health development and outcomes [28]. Disparities in access
to psychotherapeutic and psychiatric interventions in youth are also documented among
children from African American and Latinx families, as well as immigrant families, where
youth are signiﬁcantly less likely to receive needed health interventions [29]. Given the
potential for school-based interventions to address social and emotional health of young
adolescents, and particularly symptoms of anxiety and depression, further evidence on the
potential of feasible interventions to improve these is needed.

The current study, conducted in partnership with a middle school in a racially diverse,
urban population, located in the southern United States, with high poverty rates among
children, sought to evaluate the utility of YMP through a brief, school-based intervention
for symptoms of anxiety and depression among youth 11–14 years of age.

2. Methods

The study was a pragmatic, single-site, cluster randomized controlled design to eval-
uate YMP programming for the school setting on symptoms of anxiety and depression
among students. CONSORT [30] guidance was used during the design and reporting of the
study. The study took place between September 2018 and March 2019, in a middle school lo-
cated in New Orleans, LA, USA. The research team partnered with school administrators to
support the study which assessed a school-based yoga and mindfulness program delivered
by a non-proﬁt community partner organization specialized in providing yoga to schools
and educators. A waitlist control design was used wherein all students could receive the
intervention at the end of the trial period. The school partner provided deidentiﬁed data
collected by the school to be analyzed in this study in order to evaluate the effect of yoga
and mindfulness intervention for symptoms of anxiety and depression among middle
school students. The non-proﬁt organization provided all yoga programming using the
Yoga Ed curriculum™ through an established relationship with the school prior to the
study. The curriculum included both yoga (movement) and mindfulness (awareness) strate-
gies in an integrated offering. Student assent and parental consent were obtained by the
school for study participation. The study proposal was reviewed and approved by Tulane
University Human Subjects Protection Ofﬁce Internal Review Board (Reference#2019549).
Trial Registration: The study is registered through ISRCTN16686557.

Figure 1 below illustrates the study ﬂow chart. Eight groups, or clusters, of students
consisting of the entire middle school student population (which included 7th and 8th
grades) comprised the participant pool; inclusion criteria were attending the middle school
and being willing to participate. The only exclusion criteria were lack of assent and
consent to participate for any reason whatsoever (including physical reasons or simple
preference). Students aged 11–14 years old were assigned by school administrators into
8 groups of 10–12 students each, based on their homeroom and weekly course schedules.
Four groups received the intervention and four groups acted as controls, receiving the yoga
programming only after the study concluded. Randomization was used to determine the
order of the group start to intervention condition. Eighty-six of 88 students assented and
were consented to participate. At the termination of the intervention study, all 88 students
of the middle school participated in programming which was organized by the existing
community partner organization and took place in homeroom class.

Students assigned to the intervention group participated in an 8-week curriculum
of yoga programming, with sessions once during a school week, each lasting 45 min.
Yoga and mindfulness intervention was provided to each student in the intervention
group using the Yoga Ed curriculum, which has been previously studied [20,31,32]. The
curriculum (with which the study authors have no afﬁliation) is described as an evidence-
based educational program aiming to promote children’s and teens’ health and wellness
through the practice of yoga in a school-based environment. During the program, basic
skills including breathing exercises, yoga postures, games, and relaxation were practiced in
the classroom. A standard intervention session included the following segments: focusing
and breathing exercises (about 5 min), warm-up (about 10 min), yoga postures (about
20 min), games and instructional content (about 5 min), and ﬁnal relaxation (about 5 min).
Warrior poses, triangle pose, sun salutations, twists, and child poses were among the
positions that were often done. As the curriculum developed, each session added to what
came before and introduced new postures. Examples of breathing exercises were deep
breathing with a focus on the exhale, and gentle breathing. Activities encouraging the
use of yoga poses or breathing in order to mitigate relating stressful life events and social
engagement were frequently encouraged through the classes, for example with peer-to-peer

listening and discussions. Two yoga teachers led the intervention groups, both of whom
were experienced children’s yoga teachers and had undergone the same training on the
curriculum. The waitlist control groups received an attention control, consisting of their
course schedule as usual, with classes as usual (e.g., art, French, or study hall). School
staff randomized the order of eight groups to receive intervention through an open-source
website randomizer.org [33]. Blinding by school staff was not possible in the current study
due to real world conditions in the school.

Figure 2 below.

Figure 2. Study data collection.

2.1. Study Population

The study included the entire student population at a middle school consisting of
88 students. A total of 86 students aged 11–14 years old were assigned, based on their
weekly course schedules, into 8 groups of 10–12 students each group; two students declined
to participate in the intervention. No adverse events were reported during the course of
the study, and the two students who declined to participate did not state their reasons.

De-identiﬁed demographic data from school records including gender, race, status of
free/reduced price lunch, Individualized Education Program (IEP), and the 504 plan were
linked with participant codes allowing for analysis. The IEP is a plan or program developed
to ensure that a child who has a disability or is identiﬁed as gifted and is attending
an elementary or secondary educational institution receives specialized instruction and
related services. The 504 Plan is a plan developed to ensure that a child who has a
disability identiﬁed under the law and is attending an elementary or secondary educational
institution receives accommodations that will ensure their academic success and full access
to the learning environment. For students with disabilities who do require specialized
instruction, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) controls the procedural
requirements, and an IEP is developed. The IDEA process is more involved than that of
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (for more information on 504 plans and IEP, please see
the United States Department of Education [34].

2.2. Instruments

The two main outcome measures for the study included scores from the Patient Health
Questionnaire revised for adolescents (PHQA) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related
Disorders (SCARED). PHQA is a 9-item screening measure modiﬁed for children ages
11–17 to assess episodes and severity of depressive disorder [35]. Children’s depression
symptoms in the past 7 days were self-rated. Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point
scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = Several days; 2 = More than half the days; and 3 = Nearly every
day). The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of
depression. The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.882 in the current study. The Screen for Child
Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) is a series of 41 sentences describing how young

As the curriculum developed, each session added to what came before and introduced new postures. Examples of breathing exercises were deep breathing with a focus on the exhale, and gentle breathing.

people feel during the past 3 months, each of which is ranked from 0 (“not true or hardly
ever true”) to 2 (“very true or often true”). The total sum score of the 41 items showed a
satisfactory internal consistency and discrimination validity in a children sample [36]. The
total score of the 20 items on the SCARED screen ranged from 0–40. The Cronbach’s alpha
for the 20-item SCARED was 0.899.

2.3. Statistical Analyses

SPSS software (version 23.0, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. Analyses
were conducted based on an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach, meaning that participants
were analyzed in accordance with their initial group assignment. Where PHQA and
SCARED items were missed by chance, these were imputed with the mean. All data were
summarized with descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviations or frequency and
percent). Student’s t-test and the chi-square test were performed to examine differences at
baseline across groups. Mean differences at Baseline and Endpoint were also calculated
and tested in post-hoc analysis. To compare the difference between intervention and
control over time, generalized estimated equations (GEE) with an unstructured working
correlation matrix and full maximum likelihood estimation were conducted using Baseline
and Endline assessments, which showed the main effects of group and time, and also
the group by the time interaction effect. GEE was developed for repeated measures data
because it could ﬁt data with missing values and considered the within-group correlation.
Covariates at baseline included sex (as self-reported in school records), race (as self-reported
in school records), free or reduced-price lunch status (as self-reported in school records),
IEP status (yes/no), and 504 plan status (yes/no); these were included in adjusted GEE
models. Post-hoc statistical power calculated using G*Power on the basis of repeated
measures with interaction reached 90% with a total sample size of 76 and effect size f = 0.19
(Cohen’s d = 0.38). This suggests that the sample size of the current study was sufﬁcient to
identify any intervention effect. The study is registered through the clinical trial registry
ISRCTN under ISRCTN16686557.

3. Results

Four groups with a total of 42 students received the intervention (intervention group)
and four groups with 44 students received an attention control (control group). Of the
82 students for whom all demographic data were available from school records (some
records were not allowed to be linked to protect privacy), 44 (53.7%) identiﬁed as male
and 38 (46.3%) as female. The racial composition consisted of 55 (67.1%) African American,
19 (23.2%) white, 6 (7.3%) Asian and 2 (2.4%) multi-racial. Most students were non-
Hispanic American (80, 97.6%). Nearly half of the sample received free or reduced lunch
(40, 48.8%). Regarding the IEP, ﬁve students (6.1%) were identiﬁed as having a disability,
followed by 22 students (26.8%) identiﬁed as gifted or talented. The majority of students,
69 (84.1%), reported no 504 plan. As shown in Table 1, Student’s t-test and chi-square test
suggested no signiﬁcant differences between intervention and control group at baseline
on any demographic characteristics or scores of PHQA and SCARED. The absence of the
signiﬁcance at baseline suggested a successful randomization.

To assess the intervention effect compared to control group, a GEE model was utilized
for PHQA and SCARED including Baseline and Endpoint. The model allows the assump-
tion of data missing at random. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness
of our conclusions and departures from the assumption. The GEE-adjusted model for the
intervention effect on PHQA showed no significant main effects by group (Wald χ2 = 1.852,
p = 0.174) and time (Wald χ2 = 0.011, p = 0.918), but a trend for the group by time interaction
effect (Wald χ2 = 3.695, p = 0.055). The results for SCARED in a GEE-adjusted model indicated
a significant main time effect (Wald χ2 = 8.77, p = 0.003), and details are shown in Table 3.

The effect sizes were 0.38 and 0.07 for PHQA and SCARED, respectively. Post-hoc sta-
tistical power calculated using G*Power on the basis of repeated measures with interaction
reached 90% with a sample size of 76.

4. Discussion

This pragmatic trial evaluated a school-based yoga and mindfulness program in
a real-world context. Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in the intervention
group, although these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. In the control group,
anxiety symptoms decreased but depression symptoms increased. The resulting time
effect indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in anxiety symptoms, while the time by group effect
revealed a strong trend in depression symptoms.

School based approaches to addressing stress and social emotional needs of youth
have been increasingly studied [37,38]; however, few have focused speciﬁcally on middle
school aged children (11–14 years of age) who may have distinct needs from older adoles-
cents [39] and younger children. The current study provides new evidence for utilizing
YMP with middle school students, where previous studies have focused on elementary
school children [17,40,41] or high school students [31].

YMP may be particularly well suited to addressing the social emotional needs of
young people in school-based settings. Among systematic reviews of yoga for health
outcomes in youth, ﬁndings have been positive [17,23,40,42,43] notwithstanding challenges
in heterogeneity among studies and low to moderate quality of evidence. This study also
represents an important addition to the sparse literature from urban settings on school-
based yoga for youth indicating the potential for feasibility and effectiveness [41,44].

School-based universal programming for mental health [45], such as YMP employed in
the current study, has a number of advantages as an approach to prevention and mitigation
of behavioral health morbidity among young people. Providing programming at school

(A) PHQA score in total sample; (B) SCARED score in total sample. To assess the intervention effect compared to control group, a GEE model was uti-lized for PHQA and SCARED including Baseline and Endpoint. The model allows the assumption of data missing at random. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our conclusions and departures from the assumption. The GEE-adjusted model for the intervention effect on PHQA showed no significant main effects by group (Wald χ2 = 1.852, p = 0.174) and time (Wald χ2 = 0.011, p = 0.918), but a trend for the group by time interaction effect (Wald χ2 = 3.695, p = 0.055). The results for SCARED in a GEE-adjusted model indicated a significant main time effect (Wald χ2 = 8.77, p = 0.003), and details are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Overall test and mean difference between intervention and control groups for the outcomes in GEE analysis.

The effect sizes were 0.38 and 0.07 for PHQA and SCARED, respectively. Post-hoc statistical power calculated using G*Power on the basis of repeated measures with inter-action reached 90% with a sample size of 76. 4. Discussion This pragmatic trial evaluated a school-based yoga and mindfulness program in a real-world context. Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in the intervention group, although these differences were not statistically significant. In the control group, anxiety symptoms decreased but depression symptoms increased. The resulting time ef-fect indicated a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, while the time by group effect revealed a strong trend in depression symptoms. School based approaches to addressing stress and social emotional needs of youth have been increasingly studied [37,38]; however, few have focused specifically on middle school aged children (11–14 years of age) who may have distinct needs from older adoles-cents [39] and younger children. The current study provides new evidence for utilizing YMP with middle school students, where previous studies have focused on elementary school children [17,40,41] or high school students [31]. Int.

partly relieves the burden of accessing care for parents/guardians, many of whom have
day to day stressors of their own, and makes programming widely available to a range
of students [46]. In addition, such universal programs provided to all students within a
school are likely to be less stigmatizing compared with targeted programs, as students need
not be selected on the basis of existing problems for inclusion [47]. In populations such as
the deep South, where poverty and social determinants of health create grave disparities in
access to care, general population programs aimed at preventing or improving behavioral
health problems may surmount many of the challenges to access rooted in such disparities
(long wait times to see providers, expenses associated with treatment, transportation to
providers, and time commitment by caregivers who may be working multiple jobs) [48].

Middle-to-late adolescence is characterized by problems of emotional control, and
biological changes taking place during puberty may undermine the ability to cope with
stress and give rise to unhealthy risk-taking behavior [49]. By intervening earlier in adoles-
cence, through universal social and emotional care programs such as school based YMP,
youth may become better equipped with coping skills and techniques to combat stress and
mitigate negative emotional states to protect future health and developmental trajectory.

Strengths of the study include real-world rigor in a community-based setting (includ-
ing randomization and counterfactual) and developmentally appropriate, validated, and
reliable outcome measures for symptoms of anxiety and depression. The study clearly
described evidence-informed intervention modalities including physical yoga postures,
breathing, meditation, and relaxation. As the programming was tailored speciﬁcally for
the school’s needs, the delivery method, timing, and setting can be seen to be optimally
appropriate to the needs of students. No adverse events were reported during the course
of the study and only two students declined to participate for unstated reasons.

The study had several limitations, which require that results be interpreted with
caution. Sample size was limited, and small between-group mean differences were reported,
suggesting the need to be cautious in extrapolating the intervention effect. As in any
study, missing data had to be accounted for in statistical analysis. The time sequence
(treatment groups, control groups) design may lead to unbalanced maturation effects
and history. Access to yoga trainers could limit future reproducibility of results and
application of the speciﬁc method. Finally, though no reports of excessive absences were
received, limited information related to attendance in the intervention was available to
allow evaluation of ﬁdelity.

Future studies could investigate which factors may be responsible for time-related
decrease of anxiety symptoms among middle school children in such programs. These
could be related to the timing of assessments or other school related events. Another
worthy topic of investigation may be why YMP did not help in reducing internalization
symptomatology. The inability of the study results to establish a signiﬁcant impact of
YMP on symptoms may be attributable to constraints of real-world application of the
intervention. Future research on effects of yoga and mindfulness programs in youth are
warranted, particularly in light of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;
however, larger scale studies would be required to robustly assess the long-term effect of
school-based yoga and mindfulness programs.

5. Conclusions

While this study was unable to provide deﬁnitive results regarding reduction of
symptoms of anxiety and depression among youth aged 11–14 years old in a diverse, urban
setting, further studies are warranted. Future studies may be better able to determine the
conditions for effective use of YMP, including which subgroups of youth may beneﬁt from
mind-body therapies, and whether improvements are lasting over time.
