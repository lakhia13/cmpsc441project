Although there are no medications that have been specifically designed to treat PTSD, there are a variety of well-established medications currently used to treat other psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders that have been found to be helpful in managing PTSD symptoms.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, commonly referred to as SSRIs, are a type of medication usually prescribed to help with symptoms of depression and anxiety.﻿﻿ Examples of common SSRIs that may be used in the treatment of PTSD include:

- Sertraline (Zoloft)

- Paroxetine (Paxil)

- Fluoxetine (Prozac)

The two currently approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PTSD are Zoloft and Paxil. The other medications have been shown effective as well but are considered to be used off-label if used for the treatment of PTSD.

It is noted that SSRIs are usually the common category of medications to turn to in the treatment of PTSD. However, an SNRI can be used as well.SNRI stands for serotonin-noripinephrine reuptake inhibitorand they are often used for the treatment of depression.﻿﻿

Up to 50% of thosediagnosed with PTSDalso meet criteria for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

One SNRI, venlafaxine (Effexor), has been found to be particularly effective in the treatment of PTSD.

Not uncommonly, other categories of medications such as the atypical antipsychotics and the anti-hypertensive alpha-blocker prazosin may be used to decrease PTSD symptoms.

Remember that each person will respond differently in their tolerance and the perceived effectiveness of the medications used. It can take some time to find the best fit for you or your loved one. The medication part of your treatment will need to be monitored closely and managed by a trained medical professional.

If you find that you or your loved one experience the following while using your prescribed medication, please notify your medical provider, as some of the side effects to the above medications can include:

- Changes in sexual function

There are a variety of psychotherapy techniques that can be used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. However, there are a few that are growing in researched-based evidence to show their effectiveness in the treatment of PTSD.

Once you find a mental health professional, think of what you'd like to discuss with him/her including your thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and more. These things all provide valuable information to your therapist in order to help you understand and manage your symptoms.

### Cognitive Processing Therapy


Cognitive processing therapyis a specific type of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on how your traumatic event is perceived and how you tend to cope with the emotional and mental part of your experience.﻿﻿ This process includes educating you on the elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and emphasizes that you and your therapist work together as a team.

Together you collaborate in processing the traumatic event and work through "stuck points." Stuck points are certain thoughts related to the trauma that are preventing recovery. This method of counseling can be conducted in an individual or group format.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessingis more commonly referred to as EMDR. This is a type of psychotherapy often used with survivors of trauma, particularly those experiencing symptoms of PTSD. This technique utilizes bilateral sensory input such as side-to-side eye movements to help you process difficult memories, thoughts, and emotions related to your trauma.﻿﻿

As described by the EMDR Institute, "Unlike talk therapy, the insights clients gain in EMDR therapy result not so much from clinician interpretation but from the client's own accelerated intellectual and emotional processes." In EMDR therapy, the past, present, and future are all addressed using an established eight-phase treatment approach.


### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy


Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) is a style of talk-therapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. CBT targets current symptoms and problems, usually lasting 12 to 16 sessions and can be done in an individual or group format.﻿﻿

Together with your therapist, you will work to identify distortions or unhelpful patterns in your thoughts and feelings related to the trauma. The goal of CBT is to help you return to a place where you regain hope, feel a greater sense of control in your thoughts and behaviors, as well as help you to reduce escape or avoidance behaviors.


## Complementary and Alternative Therapies



### Trauma-Sensitive Yoga


Yoga has been shown to offer wonderful healing benefit to a variety of populations, including those with mental health conditions, and is widely known for the benefit of stress relief. For people with PTSD, trauma-sensitive yoga can be of great benefit.﻿﻿

David Emerson, the practitioner who first coined the term trauma-sensitive yoga, worked closely on a funded research project with trauma expertBessel van der Kolk. Their research showed that this particular style of yoga helped to significantly reduce PTSD symptoms in their participants. As compared to other styles of yoga, trauma-sensitive yoga focuses on more gentle movements and less hands-on adjustment.

This method of healing is a Chinese medicine energy practice that involves inserting thin needles into certain areas of the body to help prevent or relieve health issues. Approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs as an approved complementary and alternative medicine treatment for PTSD, studies have shown acupuncture to be safe and cost-effective.﻿﻿ Common reports by patients include a significant reduction in feelings of stress and anxiety.


## Innovative Treatments


A variety of additional treatments show promise in treating PTSD.﻿﻿


### Virtual Reality Exposure


Exposure therapy has been shown effective in the treatment of many anxiety-related disorders, as it helps you approach aspects of your trauma with less fear, working to become desensitized to the impact of your experience.Virtual reality exposure therapy(VRET) offers the technology for you to be gradually exposed to your traumatic situation while working closely with a trained clinician.

The visual situations are manipulated by the clinician and talked through together, continuing to expose you to the traumatic event and, over time, helping the event to have less and less emotional impact. As one combat veteran participant stated, "You go over the story over and over again. I got so bored with my own story that it no longer elicited a reaction."


### Ketamine Infusion


Originally approved by the FDA for anesthesia,ketamine infusionis emerging as an option for treatment-resistant mental health conditions, including PTSD. Ketamine therapy is administered intravenously at a very low dose, a dose that makes it safe for in-office treatment without producing major side effects. Research has shown that just one infusion treatment for approximately 40 minutes can lead to rapid reduction of PTSD symptoms.

Ketamine infusion therapy is often conducted in a series of treatments over a few weeks. Infusions are given only by trained medical professionals approved to administer this form of treatment. Research is ongoing on how to best apply this treatment over time.


### MDMA-Assisted Therapy


MDMA is commonly known as the recreational drug ecstasy. However, more and more research is working to explore the use of MDMA in the treatment of mental health conditions, including PTSD. During MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, traumatic memories are reportedly experienced as less threatening as you process the impact of your traumatic experience with your therapist.

In MDMA-assisted therapy, the style is non-directive as the therapist offers you a calm space to process your experiences without fear of judgment or pressure. With the help of the MDMA, it is thought that you can access your traumatic memories without feeling imminent threat or fear, making it easier to process your thoughts and emotions related to the event. Research examining the risks and benefits of this alternative treatment is ongoing.


## Where to Find Treatment


There are a variety of treatment options available, with new and innovative techniques emerging and being researched for their effectiveness. The key to accessing treatment is to acknowledge that these resources could be helpful to you or your loved one. People who struggle with PTSD often experience feelings ofshameand fear, finding it difficult to initiate seeking help. Many struggle in isolation with hope that the symptoms they are experiencing will go away on their own.

If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat988for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.

The internet can be a valuable resource in connecting you to local resources. Online sites, such as thePTSD Alliance, can offer help and guidance to finding treatment programs in your area.

Connecting with your primary care physician can be a good place to start as well, if you prefer talking with someone in person for local treatment options. Many doctors and other health providers network and become familiar with people who specialize in the treatment of certain conditions, like PTSD.
