Exploring relationship satisfaction

Background: Parenting responsibilities, while a source of happiness, often lead 
to considerable stress for parents of children with disabilities. While most parents 
try to cope with these challenges together, some level of interparental conflict 
is almost inevitable. Frequently assuming primary responsibility for children with 
disabilities, mothers can be substantially impacted by interparental conflict with 
their  partners  and  the  resulting  stress.  However,  implementing  dyadic  coping 
strategies  in  managing  stressful  situations  serves  as  a  buffer  against  adverse 
effects, while also enhancing relationship satisfaction.

Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between interparental 
conflicts,  dyadic  coping,  and  relationship  satisfaction  among  232  mothers  of 
children  with  disabilities  in  Croatia  who  were  in  an  intimate  relationship  and 
shared a household with their partners, regardless of marital status.

Methods:  We  analysed  a  non-probabilistic  sample  of  women  in  Croatia  who 
reported being in an intimate relationship, sharing a household with a partner 
(whether  married  or  simply  cohabitating)  and  being  a  mother  to  a  child  with 
a  diagnosed  developmental  disability.  Participants  completed  questionnaires 
online  in  March  of  2021  (sociodemographic  variables,  the  Parent  Problem 
Checklist, the Dyadic Coping Inventory and the Marriage Quality Index).

Results:  Results  of  hierarchical  multiple  regression  show  that  mothers’ 
perceptions of how they help their partner cope with stress do not predict how 
satisfied they are in a relationship; instead, relationship satisfaction depends on 
their perceptions of how their partner helps them and how they cope with stress 
as a team. Furthermore, moderation analysis revealed the effect of interparental 
conflicts  were  entirely  mitigated  by  high  supportive  and  low  negative  dyadic 
coping of the partner. When mothers felt adequately supported by their partner, 
the negative impact of stress caused by interparental conflicts did not spill over 
into their relationship.

Conclusion:  Our  results  suggest  that  by  recognizing  the  importance  of 
psychological  support  and  couples  therapy  in  strengthening  dyadic  coping, 
government  and  non-profit  initiatives  can  effectively  empower  parents  of 
children with disabilities, fostering healthier and more resilient family dynamics 
that promotes the well-being of parents and their children.

1 Introduction

Even though children are a source of happiness for their parents, 
parenting responsibilities are among the greatest sources of stress for 
couples (1). The stresses associated with parenting can be analysed 
through the prism of family systems theory (2), which conceptualizes 
the  family  as  a  system  of  intimate  relationships:  between  parents, 
between children, and between parents and children. Misalignment 
and tension in these intimate relationships increase parenting burden 
and  reduce  parenting  effectiveness  (3),  while  also  harming  the 
intimate relationships between parents (4, 5), reducing the frequency 
or quality of their interactions and behaviors to care for each other, 
accept each other, maintain the sexual dimension of their relationship, 
pursue joint activities and share responsibilities (6). Parenting stresses 
can also combine with external factors, such as financial problems or 
unemployment, to reduce intimate relationship satisfaction (7).

Parental stresses are often even stronger among parents raising 
children with disabilities (8–10), such as autism spectrum disorder or 
attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (11,  12)  which  is  not 
unexpected since these children, in addition to core symptoms of 
disabilities, sometimes also have behavioral problems (13). Several 
studies indicate that child behavior difficulties predict greater parental 
stress, e.g., increasing risk of emotional and psychological distress (14, 
15), which can reduce parenting effectiveness (16). Co-parenting can 
prove particularly challenging for mothers because, despite a tendency 
since  the  1950s  toward  equal  role-sharing  between  fathers  and 
mothers (17), mothers of children with disabilities often perform the 
lion’s share of childrearing (18), which leads to reports of lower life 
satisfaction  compared  to  fathers  of  the  same  children  (19). 
Furthermore,  interparental  conflict  is  reciprocally  related  to  child 
adjustment (e.g., internalizing and externalizing problems) (20), so in 
families  with  children  facing  disabilities,  frequent  interparental 
conflict may coincide with more challenging behaviors in the children, 
thereby intensifying stress for the parents.

Parental stress can lead to internal stress between parents, which 
increases interparental conflicts and decreases marital satisfaction (21). 
This process of external stress affecting the couple’s relationship is known 
as the spillover effect (22), which may have an even greater impact on 
parents  of  children  with  disabilities  (21).  One  study  (23)  compared 
families of children with disabilities and families of typically developing 
children in terms of emotional regulation, parental stress and family 
functioning and they found greater parental stress, more interparental 
conflicts and lower relationship satisfaction in parents of children with 
different types of disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, autism spectrum 
disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, learning disabilities).

For  such  parents,  a  satisfactory  intimate  relationship  can 
be  critical  for  buffering  the  challenges  of  caring  for  children  with 
disabilities (24). Co-parenting can preserve the relationship between 
parents and render it more resilient to stresses by strengthening dyadic 
coping between them, as described by the systematic transactional 
model  (25).  Dyadic  coping  (DC)  has  been  associated  with  better 
relationship quality (26), higher relationship satisfaction (27), and 
greater relationship stability (28). It can buffer the negative effects of 
chronic stress (29), including stresses related to children (30). Stronger 
dyadic coping can decrease partnership conflict (31) and improve 
relationship satisfaction (32–34) and martial adjustment (35, 36).

face stress and parenting challenges throughout their child’s life. It may 
be  the  most  important  process  in  adapting  to  life  in  chronic  stress 
context. For example, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder 
face major parenting challenges due to the complex nature of autism. 
One study (38) researched parents of children with different types of 
disabilities (e.g., motor, intellectual, sensory and multiple disabilities) 
found that in addition to DC, the partner’s responses to relationship-
focused coping are decisive. In other words, relationship-focused coping 
in the context of a perceived negative response from the spouse was 
associated  with  greater  psychological  distress,  whereas  in  contrast, 
relationship-focused coping and distress in the context of a positive 
perception of the spouse’s responses to coping were not associated.

Parents  raising  children  with  disabilities  are  particularly 
vulnerable to the stresses and strains of parenting, and so is their 
marital  relationship;  yet  we  are  unaware  of  studies  exploring 
interparental conflicts, dyadic coping, and relationship satisfaction 
among  mothers  of  children  with  developmental  disabilities. 
We  speculated  that  mothers  of  children  with  disabilities  would 
experience  parenting  conflicts  with  their  partners  and  that  their 
relationship satisfaction would depend on conflict frequency, intensity, 
and dyadic coping quality. Older age and longer relationship duration 
might reduce relationship satisfaction; however, conflict frequency, 
intensity,  and  dyadic  coping  might  be  stronger  predictors  of 
satisfaction than sociodemographic variables. We aimed to investigate 
the following research hypotheses:

H1: Mothers’ age and duration of intimate relationship, as well as 
interparental conflicts and dyadic coping will predict relationship 
satisfaction of mothers of children with disabilities.

H1.1:  Mothers’  age,  duration  of  intimate  relationship  and 
interparental  conflicts  will  negatively  predict  relationship 
satisfaction,  with 
the 
strongest predictor.

being 

H1.2: Subscales of dyadic coping (supportive and delegated coping 
of  oneself  and  of  the  partner)  will  positively  predict 
relationship satisfaction.

H1.3: Negative dyadic coping of oneself and of the partner will 
negatively predict relationship satisfaction.

H2:  Dyadic  coping  will  moderate  the  association  between 
interpersonal conflicts and relationship satisfaction.

H2.1:  Supportive  dyadic  coping  will  mitigate  the  association 
between interparental conflicts and relationship satisfaction.

H2.2:  Negative  dyadic  coping  will  intensify  the  association 
between interparental conflicts and relationship satisfaction.

household with the partner (whether married or simply cohabitating), 
and being mother to a child with a diagnosed developmental disability.
Participants were recruited through educational centres, private 
rehabilitation  practices,  as  well  as  formal  and  informal  parent 
associations and support groups. Initial contact with participants was 
made through school principals, superintendents, or representatives 
who  had  been  informed  about  the  study  and  were  asked  to  send 
potential participants a link to participate in the surveys (see below). 
We aimed to engage as many parent’s associations and institutions as 
possible, specifically those providing care for children with disabilities 
or their families, across the country. This strategy was designed to 
involve  a  broad  spectrum  of  mothers  who  raise  children  with 
disabilities  in  our  research.  As  most  of  these  institutions  are 
concentrated in Zagreb, the capital city, it’s presumed that the majority 
of participating mothers reside there. These mothers likely have better 
access to support services. Furthermore, it’s essential to note another 
potential bias due to the fact that research only included mothers who 
responded to the experts’ invitations and accessed the provided links.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty 
of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Zagreb, on 1st 
of February 2021 (Classification: 602-25/23-01/42; Registry number: 
251-74/23-02-7/2).

2.2 Survey procedure

Between March and April 2021, potential participants were sent 
an online link to complete the surveys below via the SurveyMonkey 
tool. They could complete the questionnaires either on a smartphone 
or  a  computer.  Participants  were  prevented  from  completing  the 
questionnaire more than once with SurveyMonkey default feature. 
Before being allowed to complete them, potential participants were 
given basic information about the purpose of the study, objectives and 
procedures of the research and how the data would be used, as well as 
assurances that their responses would be analysed anonymously and 
kept confidential. They were informed that their participation was 
voluntary and that they could withdraw consent even after completing 
the questionnaires. Participants were given information about time 
required to complete the survey (15–20 min). Upon reviewing the 
fundamental  details  of  the  research  and  carefully  reading  the 
instructions, the participants expressed their consent to engage in the 
study. This affirmation was indicated by their action of clicking on the 
questionnaire,  following  which  they  proceeded  to  respond  to  the 
posed questions. Only after providing this consent, were they allowed 
to access the questionnaires and submit responses. Since participants 
completed questionnaires online, information on how many potential 
participants were reached was not collected and it is not possible to 
provide details on the response rate.

The link to the surveys was available to participants from March 
1, 2021 to April 1, 2021. Given that no new participant responses were 
observed after approximately 2 weeks, the researchers agreed that the 
invitation  to  participate  in  the  research  and  the  link  to  the 
questionnaire would be available for another 2 weeks, for a total of 
1 month. Participants in our research were not provided with any 
incentives  and  participating  was  on  an  entirely  voluntary  basis. 
However,  there  was  an  exclusion  criteria:  the  participants  in  the 
research  had  to  be  women  who  have  been  in  a  current  intimate 
relationship for at least 6 months.

2.3 Surveys

Participants first were asked to provide sociodemographic data 
about themselves and their child with disabilities, including their age 
and the child’s age, duration of their relationship with their partner, 
their education level, their employment status, monthly household 
income (i.e., joint income contributed by all employed persons in the 
household), the child’s gender and the child’s disability according to 
the following six categories defined by the Croatian government (39): 
intellectual  disability;  autism  spectrum  disorder;  sensorimotor 
disability;  genetic  syndrome  or  chronic  disease;  attention  deficit 
hyperactivity  disorder,  specific  learning  disability,  or  sensory 
integration  disorder;  or  disorder  of  speech,  language,  and  voice. 
Parents could check more than one category. In case the participants 
had more than one child with developmental difficulties, they had the 
opportunity to answer the questions for each child separately.

includes  16  conflict 

Then participants were asked to fill out Croatian versions of the 
following questionnaires. The Parent Problem Checklist (40), which 
we  translated  into  Croatian  ourselves  using  a  back-translation 
procedure involving two translators working independently, was used 
to  measure  the  extent  of  parental  conflict  related  to  childrearing. 
Given that our study focused on interparental conflicts in general, and 
that we were interested in exploring number of disagreements and the 
intensity of the conflicts all parents have, regardless of whether they 
have  a  typically  developing  child  or  child  with  disabilities  aged 
0–18 years, we assessed this instrument as suitable for our research. 
The  checklist 
including 
disagreements about discipline or rules, the extent of overt conflict 
related  to  childrearing,  and  mutual  undermining  of  a  parent’s 
relationship  with  the  child.  Participants  indicated  on  a  scale  of  1 
(“never”)  to  5  (“very  often”)  how  often  a  given  interaction  had 
occurred between them and their partner during the previous 4 weeks. 
Examples of items include “Disagreements about how to discipline” 
or “One soft, one hard parent.” The scores on individual items were 
summed to obtain a total score, with higher score indicating a higher 
level of conflict between parents. The internal consistency of the scale 
in the present study was α = 0.91, which indicated that items in this 
instrument measure the same construct and that we could interpret 
the results indeed as a level of interparental conflicts.

interactions, 

The  Dyadic  Coping  Inventory  (41),  which  we  translated  into 
Croatian ourselves using a back-translation procedure involving two 
translators  working  independently,  was  used  to  measure  dyadic 
coping  between  the  respondent  and  her  partner.  The  inventory 
consists  of  35  items  and  includes  ratings  of  the  respondent’s  own 
coping, her partner’s coping, and joint coping, referring to when the 
respondent and her partner faced a stressor jointly (41). The first two 
types of coping were assessed in terms of supportive coping behaviors 
(e.g., “My partner listens to me and gives me the opportunity to share 
what is really bothering me”), delegated coping behaviors (e.g., “When 
I am too busy, my partner helps me”), and negative coping behaviors 
(e.g.,  “When  I  am  stressed,  my  partner  tends  to  withdraw”). 
Participants were asked to respond on a scale from 1 (“very rarely”) to 
5 (“very often”) about the frequency of these behaviors in general. The 
scores on individual items were summed to obtain a total score, with 
greater scores indicating stronger dyadic coping behavior. Subscores 
were  also  calculated  for  each  of  the  three  types  of  coping  (own, 
partner’s and joint). In the present study, internal consistency was 
α = 0.94 for the total scale, while it ranged from 0.64 to 0.91 for the

subscales, which is satisfactory. In our study, principal component 
analysis yielded the three-factor solution for both own and partner’s 
coping and the predicted one-factor solution for joint/common dyadic 
coping,  which  accounted  for  55.5,  66.7  and  72.5%  of  variance, 
respectively.  The  potential  bias  in  adapting  and  validating  this 
instrument in Croatian language could stem from sampling method 
(non-probabilistic  sample 
included  only  women)  and 
characteristics of the sample (mothers of children with disabilities, in 
monogamous  heterosexual  relationship).  No  other  potential  bias 
regarding 
language,  culture  or  other  sources  of  bias  was 
deemed relevant.

that 

The Marriage Quality Index (42) was used to measure relationship 
satisfaction, as it was already validated in Croatian translation (43). 
The index includes five items (e.g., “My relationship with my partner 
makes me happy”), to which participants responded on a scale from 
1 (“strongly disagree”) to 7 (“strongly agree”); and one item (“All things 
considered,  how  happy  are  you  in  your  relationship  with  your 
partner?”), to which participants responded on a scale from 1 (“very 
unhappy”) to 10 (“very happy”). Responses to all items were averaged 
to obtain an overall score. The internal consistency of the scale in the 
present study was 0.97, which is satisfactory.

3 Results

3.1 Descriptive statistics

This  study  analysed  232  women  between  24  and  57 years  old 
(M = 39.13,  SD = 6.19),  who  reported  having  been  in  an  intimate 
relationship  with  their  current  partner  for  an  average  of  14 years 
(range, 1–34 years). Just over half of participants (56.9%) had a high 
school diploma, while 40.9% had a university degree (college degree, 
master’s  degree,  or  PhD)  (Table  1).  While  29.3%  of  mothers  were 
employed full time, 20.7% were working with reduced working hours 
or part time and majority of them (37.5%) reported having received 
“parent  caregiver”  status  from  the  local  government  or  being  on 
maternity leave, which implied that they were not working in order to 
spend  more  time  with  their  child  with  disability.  Over  half  the 
respondents (62%) reported a monthly household income of 1,000–
2000 EUR, while nearly a quarter (22.8%) reported an income below 
1,000 EUR.

Among the respondents’ children with disabilities, their average 
age was 8 years (SD = 4.05; range 1–17 years) and 66.8% were male 
(Table 2). One third (33.2%) of mothers had a child with multiple

disabilities and 20.3% had a child with autism spectrum disorder. Of 
the other developmental disabilities, the most prevalent were speech, 
language,  and  voice  disorders  (13.4%)  and  genetic  syndromes  or 
chronic  diseases  (11.2%).  Further,  9.9%  mothers  had  a  child  with 
attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  specific  learning 
difficulties, or sensory integration disorders, while 7.3% had a child 
with various sensorimotor disabilities. Lastly, only 4.7% mothers in 
our  study  had  a  child  with  intellectual  disability.  The  majority  of 
children with disabilities in Croatia are integrated into the regular 
education system, if they do not have multiple or complex disabilities 
that would prevent them from completing regular curriculum with an 
individualized  approach  or  curriculum  adaptation.  Regardless  of 
whether the child is placed in a regular or special educational system,

parents of children with disabilities in Croatia lack systematic support 
in fulfilling their rights and the rights of their children, which is why 
parents of children with various disabilities often face the same or 
similar challenges in everyday life and during child’s growing up.

The scores of the respondents on the Parent Problem Checklist, 
Dyadic Coping Inventory and Marriage Quality Index are presented 
in Table 3. The scores showed a normal distribution based on the fact 
that the z-scores for skewness and kurtosis fell between −3.29 and 3.29 
(44), so parametric statistical tests were used. Since results on the 
subscales “Supportive dyadic coping by oneself,” “Delegated dyadic 
coping by oneself,” “Negative dyadic coping by oneself ” of the Dyadic 
Coping  Inventory  and  on  the  Marriage  Quality  Index  deviated 
significantly from normal, non-parametric indicators were used (i.e., 
median  and 
interquartile  range).  Nonetheless,  research  has 
demonstrated that the Pearson correlation coefficient remains reliable 
even when applied to skewed distributions, indicating its validity in 
such cases (45). The mean score on interparental conflict was 37.39 
(SD = 12.13)  indicating  moderate  frequency  and  intensity  of 
disagreements with the partner, such as when discussing parenting 
decisions.  The  total  mean  score  for  dyadic  coping  was  123.72 
(SD = 21.55), which falls within the normal range of 111–145 (46). 
When it comes to mothers’ perception of their own coping with stress 
(“Supportive dyadic coping by oneself,” “Delegated dyadic coping by 
oneself ”), they perceive themselves as highly supportive toward their 
partner when he deals with stressful situations (C = 20, Q1 = 18, Q3 = 22 
for supportive and C = 8, Q1 = 6, Q3 = 8 for delegated coping). On the 
other hand, mothers’ perceptions of their own negative dyadic coping 
are lower (C = 8, Q1 = 6, Q3 = 10) which indicates they rarely perceive 
themselves as being unsupportive, e.g., displaying hostile or superficial 
behavior  toward  their  partner  when  he  is  going  through  stressful 

situations. Mean scores on the subscales “Supportive dyadic coping of 
the  partner”  and  “Delegated  dyadic  coping  of  the  partner”  were, 
respectively, 16.72 (SD = 6.26) and 6.59 (SD = 2.33), indicating that 
most  mothers  in  our  study  generally  perceived  their  partners  to 
be supportive in times of stress. Mean score on the subscale “Common 
dyadic  coping”  was  16.14  (SD = 4.90),  implying  that  mothers’ 
perception of how she and her partner cope together with shared 
stressful situations is successful and symmetrical. Median score on the 
Marriage Quality Index was 6.50 (Q1 = 5.33, Q3 = 7.33), representing 
that respondents were very satisfied with their intimate relationship.

3.2 Correlations

Pearson correlation analysis revealed several associations between 
scores on the three questionnaires (Table 4). Interparental conflict, as 
expected, correlated negatively with “Supportive dyadic coping by 
oneself ”  (r = −0.22,  p < 0.01),  “Supportive  dyadic  coping  of  the 
partner”  (r = −0.54,  p < 0.01),  “Delegated  coping  of  the  partner” 
(r = −0.44, p < 0.01) and “Common dyadic coping” (r = −0.53, p < 0.01). 
Results showed interparental conflict did not correlate with “Delegated 
dyadic coping by oneself.” These results suggest that respondents who 
had more frequent conflicts with their partner about parenting also 
perceived their communication with the partner to be worse and their 
ability  to  cope  with  stress  as  a  couple  to  be  weaker.  Parents 
experiencing  frequent  disagreements  in  raising  children  with 
disabilities  may  encounter  heightened  stress  levels,  limiting  their 
capacity to support their partner during stressful events. Moreover, 
when one parent perceives the other’s parenting views as insignificant, 
they  might  struggle  to  empathize  during  their  partner’s  stress.  In

conflictual situations, partners might overlook each other’s attempts 
to  help  them  cope  with  stress,  reducing  the  likelihood  of  future 
supportive dyadic coping. Additionally, couples not accustomed to 
employ supportive dyadic coping, or employing negative coping, may 
face  more  overall  negative  interactions  in  a  relationship.  This  can 
manifest  in  arguments  in  the  presence  of  children,  unresolved 
conflicts, or divergent disciplinary approaches. Finally, interparental 
conflict correlated negatively with relationship satisfaction (r = −0.60, 
p < 0.01).  In  other  words,  mothers  who  reported  more  frequent 
conflicts with their partner over their child disability perceived their 
dyadic stress management as worse and their intimate relationship 
with their partner as less satisfying.

Conversely, relationship satisfaction correlated positively with 
common dyadic coping (r = 0.72, p < 0.01) and all subscales of coping 
by oneself and coping of the partner. The highest correlation was 
found  between  relationship  satisfaction  and  “Supportive  dyadic 
coping  of  the  partner”  (r = 0.78,  p < 0.01)  and  the  lowest  between 
relationship satisfaction and “Delegated dyadic coping by oneself ” 
(r = 0.17, p < 0.01). These results suggest that mothers of children with 
disabilities who are more satisfied with their relationship with their 
partner  also  are  more  likely  to  perceive  their  partner  as  caring, 
helpful, and supportive in stressful times. Also, how couples cope 
with stress together as a team appears to be crucial for maintaining a 
happy, fulfilling intimate relationship.

3.3 Hierarchical multiple regression 
analysis

Hierarchical  multiple  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to 
identify which variables contributed to relationship satisfaction of 
mothers of children with disabilities (Table 5). In the first step, the 

predictors were sociodemographic variables (respondent age, duration 
of  intimate  relationship);  in  the  second  step,  the  predictor  was 
interparental  conflict;  and  in  the  third  step,  the  predictors  were 
subscales of Dyadic Coping Inventory. The entire set of predictors 
explained 71.7% of the observed variance in relationship satisfaction, 
which was statistically significant [F (10, 221) = 55.988, p < 0.01]. Each 
of the three steps explained a significant proportion of the variance: 
first step 3.3% (p < 0.05), second step 37.2% (p < 0.01) and the third 
step 71.7% (p < 0.01). In the first step, both predictors, respondent age 
(β = −0.24, p < 0.01) and duration of intimate relationship (β = 0.23, 
p < 0.05) were significant. These results indicate that older mothers in 
our study were less satisfied with their relationship, as often happens 
when partners enter middle age and use resources to cope with the 
challenges of everyday life related to careers and childcare (47). On the 
other hand, those mothers who were in their relationship for a longer 
period were also more satisfied with the relationship, which means 
that partners over time invest in their relationship, grow closer to each 
other, and develop closeness (48) which is related to their levels of 
satisfaction and commitment (49).

In the second step, interparental conflicts (β = −0.59, p < 0.01) 
were introduced, which resulted in respondent age being no longer 
statistically significant predictor of relationship satisfaction, while 
duration  of  intimate  relationship  was  still  significant  predictor 
(β = 0.16,  p < 0.05).  Higher  satisfaction  with  the 
intimate 
relationship  was  associated  with  less  frequent  conflict  between 
parents. This means that interactions between partners, such as 
interparental  conflicts,  explain  some  of  the  variance  of  age  in 
predicting relationship satisfaction. Also, it means that for mothers 
of children with disabilities, when it comes to their satisfaction 
with  intimate  relationship,  it  is  more  important  how  mothers 
cooperate  and  communicate  with  their  partner  while  raising 
children together.

Finally,  in  the  third  step,  subscales  of  dyadic  coping  were 
introduced,  which  resulted  in  duration  of  intimate  relationship 
becoming  insignificant  as  a  predictor.  Interestingly,  none  of  the 
subscales  of  dyadic  coping  by  oneself  (supportive,  delegated,  or 
negative) predicted relationship satisfaction of mothers of children 
with disabilities in our study. However, all of the subscales of dyadic 
coping  of  the  partner,  as  well  as  common  dyadic  coping,  were 
predictors of relationship satisfaction. The strongest predictors were 
“Supportive  dyadic  coping  of  the  partner”  (β = 0.31,  p < 0.01)  and 
“Common  dyadic  coping”  (β = 0.24,  p < 0.01).  “Delegated  dyadic 
coping of the partner” was somewhat weaker, but still statistically 
significant predictor of the relationship satisfaction (β = 0.16, p < 0.01). 
As expected, “Negative dyadic coping of the partner” was negative 
predictor of the relationship satisfaction (β = −0.19, p < 0.01). These 
results  indicate  that  mothers’  perceptions  of  how  they  help  their 
partner cope with stress do not predict how satisfied are they in a 
relationship;  instead,  relationship  satisfaction  depends  on  their 
perceptions of how their partner helps them and how they cope with 
stress as a team. Also, hostile, and ambivalent interactions with the 
partner,  e.g.,  partner  withdrawing  in  stressful  situations,  partner 
providing support, but doing it unwillingly etc. have a deleterious 
effect and predict lower levels of relationship satisfaction in mothers. 
Two  studies  (26,  50)  found  that  the  perceived  marital  quality  of 
women from the general population depended on both their own and 
their partner’s dyadic coping, whereas the same parameter among 
men depended only on their own dyadic coping. These two previous 
studies and the present work strengthen the idea that mothers raising 
a child with disabilities place a premium on the quality of support they 
receive from their partners.

In order to examine whether the correlation between interparental 
conflict  and  relationship  satisfaction  in  mothers  of  children  with 
disabilities  depends  on  dyadic  coping,  regression  analyses  were 
conducted on centered variables of interparental conflict and subscales 
of dyadic coping (including the interaction of these variables), where 
the confidence intervals were determined by the bootstrap method on 
1,000 samples. As can be seen from Table 6, none of the dyadic coping 
of oneself subscales moderated the correlation between interparental 
conflict and relationship satisfaction of mothers in our study, while 
only “Supportive dyadic coping of the partner” and “Negative dyadic 
coping  of  the  partner”  moderated  the  correlation  between 
interparental conflict and relationship satisfaction of mothers in our 
study (Table 7).

When  it  comes  to  “Supportive  dyadic  coping  of  the  partner” 
(binteraction = 0.003, 95%CI [0.0001, 0.005]), interparental conflict was a 
significant predictor of the lower relationship satisfaction for mothers 
of children with disabilities, but only when moderator, in this case 
supportive dyadic coping, was average or lower (–1SD), as can be seen 
from Table 7. In those mothers who perceive their partner as highly 
supportive,  i.e.,  showing  empathy,  helping  analyze  the  stressful 
situation,  giving  opportunity  to  communicate  etc.,  interparental 
conflicts were not predicting decrease in relationship satisfaction. In 
other words, the effect of interparental conflicts was entirely mitigated 
by having a supportive partner with whom mothers could share stress 
(Figure 1).

“Negative dyadic coping of the partner” (binteraction = −0.004, 95%CI 
[−0.007,  −0.0007]),  interparental  conflict  negatively  predicted 
relationship satisfaction for mothers of children with disabilities, but 
only when moderator, in this case negative dyadic coping, was average 
or  high  (+1SD).  In  those  mothers  who  perceive  more  negative 
interactions  with  their  partner  during  stressful  situations  (i.e., 
blaming, withdrawing, not taking stress seriously etc.), interparental 
conflicts will decrease relationship satisfaction. However, if partner 
does not cope with stress negatively, interparental conflicts will not 
have a negative effect on relationship satisfaction (Figure 2).

Thus,  in  the  case  of  mothers  of  children  with  developmental 
disabilities, the satisfaction with the partner relationship contributes 
the most to her satisfaction with the support her partner provides her 
in stressful situations. When these mothers feel adequately supported 
by  their  partner,  the  negative  impact  of  stress  caused  by  conflicts 
related to their children does not spill over into their relationship 
(Table 8).

4 Discussion

Parents of children with disabilities often experience higher levels 
of parenting stress than parents of children without disabilities (8, 10), 
which can negatively impact parenting effectiveness (16). Mothers of 
children with disabilities often function as primary caregivers, so they 
also face additional, specific sources of stress related to caring for a 
child with disabilities (19). This study examined the associations of 
interparental conflict, dyadic coping and certain sociodemographic 
factors with relationship satisfaction among mothers raising children 
with  developmental  disabilities.  Our  first  hypothesis  (H1)  that 
mothers’  age  and  duration  of  intimate  relationship,  interparental

conflicts and dyadic coping will predict relationship satisfaction of 
mothers of children with disabilities was partially confirmed. Our 
expectation was that relationship duration would negatively predict 
relationship  satisfaction  (H1.1);  however,  our  results  show  that  is 
positively predicts it. Also, results show that relationship satisfaction 
decreased  with  respondents’  age,  but  longer  relationship  duration 
predicted higher levels of relationship satisfaction, which is consistent 
with a study (i.e., systematic review and meta-analysis) conducted in 
2021 (51), showing that relationship satisfaction in people generally 
decreases between ages 20 and 40 and then increases up to age of 65; 
also, satisfaction decreases in the first 10 years and increases up to 
20 years of relationship.

Our results could be better understood when we look at surveys 
of the general population (e.g., 52–54) that show how with increasing 
age, the satisfaction of women (especially after the birth of children) 
decreases  more  than  that  of  men.  On  the  other  hand,  the  more 
partners  invest  in  relationship,  the  more  likely  are  they  to  stay 
committed, which is consistent with Rusbult’s investment model (55). 
It is assumed that investment will also increase over time. Our results 
could indicate that mothers of children with disabilities do not differ 
from the general population in this respect.

Furthermore,  we  hypothesized  that  mothers’  age,  duration  of 
intimate  relationship  and  interparental  conflict  would  negatively 
predict relationship satisfaction, with interparental conflict being the

strongest predictor. After we included interparental conflict in second 
step  in  hierarchical  multiple  regression,  the  effect  of  mothers’  age 
becomes  insignificant  and  interparental  conflict  proved  to  be  a 
stronger predictor than duration of intimate relationship. This could

mean that, over time, interactions between partners become more 
important for overcoming specific child-rearing challenges and for 
mothers’  satisfaction  with  relationship.  However,  since  even  after 
accounting for interparental conflict, the duration of the relationship 
was still a predictor of greater relationship satisfaction, it appears that 
mothers who have been in the relationship longer are more likely to 
invest in it and are also more satisfied with it.

Additionally, mothers in our study who perceived more frequent 
conflict with their partner regarding children also perceived poorer 
dyadic coping and were less satisfied with their intimate relationship. 
Our results are consistent with the idea that stresses around parenting 
can “spill over” into the intimate relationship between the parents (e.g., 
27, 21), reducing relationship satisfaction over time (e.g., 31). This 
spillover likely reflects multiple processes: first, the parents spend less 
time together as partners, limiting opportunities for positive couple 
behaviors such as affection or intimacy (56); and second, the capacity 
for self-regulation decreases, facilitating the expression of negative 
individual traits such as aggressiveness and increasing the frequency 
of  conflict  and  negative  couple  behaviors.  In  other  words,  when 
partners feel stressed, they engage in fewer positive and more negative 
interactions  with  each  other,  which  affects  relationship  quality, 
satisfaction,  and  stability  over  time.  Indeed,  lower  levels  of  dyadic 
coping have been associated with lower relationship stability (57).

Moreover,  we  hypothesized  that  subscales  of  dyadic  coping 
(supportive and delegated coping of oneself and of the partner) will 
positively  predict  relationship  satisfaction  (H1.2),  while  negative 
dyadic coping will negatively predict it (H.1.3). This hypothesis was 
partially confirmed since we found that relationship satisfaction was 
positively predicted only by supportive and delegated dyadic coping 
of the partner, but not of oneself; also, it was negatively predicted only 
by negative dyadic coping of the partner, but not of oneself. Support 
received from the partner is also deemed important for the perceived 
marital quality of women in the general population (26). In fact, one 
study (50) concluded that dyadic coping is more important to women 
than  men  for  relationship  satisfaction.  These  findings  may  reflect 
cultural expectations that mothers and fathers have internalized. In 
many Western countries, traditional gender roles are still present, and 
mothers continually take the most care of the children (31). Croatia is 
not  an  exception  in  this  regard,  since  it  is  traditionally  Catholic 
country, confirmed by the data of 2021 census; out of a little bit over

3.8 million inhabitant living in Croatia, 78.9% identify themselves as 
Catholics  (58).  One  longitudinal  study  (59)  conducted  in  Croatia 
looked at the roles of women and men in the period of 1999–2016 and 
found that women achieved a positive shift in the level of equality 
outside  the  home  (i.e.,  in  profession  and  at  workplace),  but 
deteriorated at home, especially in connection with raising children 
and caring for elderly family members, as well as fulfilling household 
duties.  While  men  are  participating  more  in  the  housework,  they 
participate somewhat less in activities related to children. This could 
mean  that  women  still  have  to  devote  most  of  their  free  time  to 
the family.

The cultural context in Croatia is somewhat in line with the results 
of  our  research,  in  which  out  of  232  mothers,  88  were  currently 
unemployed or not actively participating in the workforce (e.g., due 
to maternity leave or “parent caregiver” status) and 116 were working, 
of which only 68 full-time and 48 part-time. As our results showed, 
mothers  that  were  employed  full-time  had  significantly  more 
interparental conflict with their partners, as opposed to mothers that 
were on maternity leave or had “parent caregiver” status. Considering 
the  extensive  involvement  of  mothers  in  household  and  childcare 
responsibilities, it’s reasonable to anticipate that the support from their 
partners holds significant importance, whether it’s practical assistance 
or  emotional  support.  For  this  reason,  relationship  satisfaction  of 
mothers  in  our  study  was  predicted  only  by  partner’s  supportive, 
delegated and negative dyadic coping, while supportive, delegated and 
negative  coping  of  mothers  themselves  was  not  significant  in 
predicting changes in relationship satisfaction.

In concordance with our second hypothesis (H2), dyadic coping 
indeed moderates the association between interparental conflict and 
relationship satisfaction. More precisely, supportive dyadic coping of 
the  partner  mitigated  the  association  between  above  mentioned 
variables  (H2.1),  while  negative  dyadic  coping  of  the  partner 
intensifies  it  (H2.2).  Again,  common  dyadic  coping  as  well  as 
supportive, delegated and negative coping of oneself did not moderate 
the  association  between  interparental  conflict  and  relationship 
satisfaction. When mothers rate dyadic coping of the partner as high, 
the unfavorable effect of interparental conflict do not spill over into 
relationship  with  their  partner.  Conversely,  when  mothers  do  not 
perceive  support  from  their  partners  (or  perceive  negative  dyadic 
coping  of  the  partner),  interparental  conflict  results  in  lower 
relationship satisfaction.

On  the  one  hand,  when  mothers  are  aware  of  their  partner’s 
support  in  stressful  situations,  they  may  rely  more  on  the  father’s 
parenting skills, which can reduce interparental conflict (31). On the 
other hand, if mothers perceive their partners’ practical and emotional 
support,  in  situations  of  interparental  conflict,  the  effect  of  stress 
spillover into the intimate relationship will not occur and mothers will 
continue to be satisfied in the relationship. It could be that mothers’ 
perception  of  understanding  and  support  from  their  partner  will 
foster a sense that their partner takes them seriously and cares about 
them, which provides a sense of belonging and connectedness with 
partner, strengthens the partner subsystem, and protects it from the 
external sources of stress.

However, when mothers have the impression that their partner 
often does not support them while experiencing stressful situations, 
i.e., if dyadic coping of the partner is negative, then the unfavorable 
influence of interparental conflict spills over time into the partner 
relationship. On the contrary, when mothers do not perceive negative 

dyadic  coping  of  their  partners,  interparental  conflict  will  not 
influence relationship satisfaction.

When it comes to long-term implications for the well-being of the 
whole family, it can be assumed that interparental conflict, dyadic 
coping and relationship satisfaction play a big role in shaping family 
dynamics.  Benefits  for  mothers  in  terms  of  increased  relationship 
satisfaction, supportive dyadic coping presented by the partner, and 
less frequent interparental conflict could lead to more understanding 
between partners. Consequently, this would mean, e.g., equal sharing 
of household and child-related tasks between partners, as well as more 
free time for mothers to engage in other activities, such as professional 
development.  Fathers  of  children  with  disabilities  are  often  more 
focused on work, i.e., career and providing for family financially (60), 
which  could  lead  to  them  feeling  excluded  and  less  competent  in 
parenting role (45). The more involved fathers are in child upbringing, 
the more opportunities they have for an active and quality parenting 
and intimate relationship. Greater satisfaction in intimate relationship 
can influence family dynamics by promoting greater cohesion between 
family members and focusing on a common goal, which are important 
protective factors that foster family’s resilience to stress (46).

When  it  comes  to  children,  studies  show  they  have  fewer 
psychological problems and greater social competence if they grow up 
in families that support each other and cope with problems together. 
They  also  have  a  sense  of  emotional  security  and  learn  prosocial 
behaviors in stressful situations as well as strategies of joint problem 
solving (61). Dyadic coping between partners is related to children’s 
prosocial  behavior  (62);  positive  interactions  between  parents 
contribute to child’s well-being (63). On the other hand, poorer dyadic 
coping leads to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children 
(61).  Although  these  findings  stem  from  research  in  general 
population, we can assume it is a good place to start to from guidelines 
for families of children with disabilities as well.

that 

In Croatia, families of children with disabilities are faced with 
complex challenges and are in need of systematic and continuous 
external  support.  Longitudinal  study  (31) 
looked  at 
interrelationship between dyadic coping and interparental conflict in 
couples comprised 150 couples divided into three groups; one group 
participated in a couple-oriented program (CCET), the second in a 
parenting training program (Triple P) and the third was control group. 
Mothers  in  first  two  groups  reported  greater  pre-post  increase  in 
dyadic  coping  when  compared  to  mothers  in  control  group.  In 
addition,  mothers  that  participated  in  couple-oriented  program 
showed  the  greatest  pre-post  decrease  in  interparental  conflict 
compared to mothers in the other two groups. Results of this study 
highlight  the 
importance  of  evidence-based  couple-oriented 
programs, which unfortunately do not exist in Croatia. The majority 
of formal support for families of children with disabilities is offered by 
institutions  and  non-government  organizations  in  the  form  of 
parenting  programs  designed  to  teach  parenting  skills;  to  a  lesser 
extent they provide parents with individual psychological support. 
Again, mostly mothers take part in such programs.

Parents  of  children  with  disabilities  are  often  unaware  of  the 
importance of the relationship quality because a child with disability 
is  often  their  primary  focus.  In  Croatia,  parents  of  adults  with 
disabilities  reported  that  they  lack  professional  support  for 
maintaining partner relationships (64). The most important support 
for  parents  of  children  with  disabilities  is  one  obtained  by  family 
members, especially from the partner/spouse (65). It is followed by

informal support from other family members, friends and relatives, 
and only then comes the formal support which is insufficient and with 
which parents are dissatisfied. Moreover, support from other parents 
who raise children with disabilities is also of great importance for 
parents, which is in line with other studies (66).

The aim of external support network is to help parents deal with 
children’s  challenging  behaviors,  while  also  promoting  children’s 
learning and developmental progress, in order to reduce stress for 
parents and thus decrease frequency and intensity of interparental 
conflict. To achieve this, it would be important to include parents in 
support groups and/or programs that directly affect the quality of 
intimate  relationship,  such  as  communication  between  partners, 
personal  and  mutual  coping  with  stress  and  coping  with  conflict. 
Through training, education, counseling, partner psychotherapy and 
support groups, partners can increase positive interactions, reduce 
conflicts and develop greater satisfaction in their relationship. Since 
practical  experience  shows  that  it  is  challenging  to  include  both 
parents in those kinds of programs, implementing support programs 
should be followed by providing childcare, so chances of involving 
both parents are increased.

5 Limitations of the study

Our study has some limitations that could potentially affect the 
generalizability of the results. First, our study only examined mothers, 
their  perception  of  interparental  conflict  and  dyadic  coping  and 
relationship satisfaction. We did not examine the relationship dyad 
from  the  fathers’  perspective.  Since  fathers  are  an  understudied 
population group in both intimate relationships and parenting (this is 
even more true for parents of children with disabilities), future studies 
should fill this gap. In some families, fathers have almost as much 
responsibility for parenting as the mother and may even be the child’s 
primary caregiver. In addition, parents often disagree on child-related 
issues and perceive stress and conflict with their partners differently. 
Therefore,  studies  should  use  dyadic  designs  that  include  the 
perspective of both partners simultaneously. In this way, relationship 
phenomena,  such  as  relationship  satisfaction  and  common/joint 
coping, would be addressed at the interpersonal level – as it should 
be – and not at the intrapersonal level. There is evidence that the 
response of partners to a parent’s “relationship-oriented coping” in 
raising children with disabilities can strongly influence the parent’s 
psychological distress (38). For example, if one parent makes an effort 
to compromise and empathize in stressful caregiving situations, but 
the  partner  does  not  reciprocate,  the  first  parent  may  suffer 
more stress.

Second, we did not examine perceived parenting stress in our 
study. Future studies should include such measures and differentiate 
between acute and chronic stress. Furthermore, the DCI was used 
non-specifically and was not specifically associated with child-related 
stress.  Therefore,  conclusions  about  mothers’  dyadic  coping  (and 
perceived coping of their partners) in relation to child-related stress 
should be interpreted with caution. We did not measure the presence 
of other stressors that might also cluster with child-related stressors. 
Future studies should therefore be strengthened with more detailed 
stress measures.

Third, our study did not examine the potential moderator effect 
of  the  diverse  diagnosis  of  the  child,  the  age  of  the  child  with 

disabilities, or perceived support from other family members. This 
should be considered when planning further research. For example, 
we  would  expect  the  two  variables  mentioned  to  have  a  potential 
impact on relationship satisfaction for both mothers and fathers. In 
addition to examining the potential moderators, studies should also 
perform assessments longitudinally rather than only once, as in the 
present work, as relationship satisfaction may fluctuate considerably 
overtime,  especially  in  higher  stress  situations  such  as  parenting 
children with disabilities (23).

With regard to generalizability of the study, we  should also 
mention that the mothers in our study were generally very satisfied 
with their relationship and also rated their dyadic coping as good 
(or average). Therefore, we cannot generalize the results to those 
mothers/parents who are less satisfied or do not cope as well with 
stress.  Furthermore,  the  mothers  in  our  sample  do  not  have 
particularly high interparental conflicts with their partners – the 
conflicts are moderately frequent, so this also limits the conclusions 
on our specific population. Quite a number of mothers are not 
actively employed (e.g., on maternity leave), and quite a number of 
them also work part-time, which also means that they can provide 
most of the childcare, but also limits the generalizability of results 
in our study.
