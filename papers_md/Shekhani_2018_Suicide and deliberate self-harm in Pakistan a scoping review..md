Abstract

Background: Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually.
Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where
information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk
factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan.
Method: This study was based on Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework of scoping review, combining
peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts
(ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of
Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO,
Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet.com were searched from the beginning
of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of
various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language.

Results: Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent
reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of
which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two
student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only
three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants
rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing
suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most
common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides
was mentioned in only three studies.

Conclusions: This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The
evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors.

Background
In 2012, an estimated 804, 000 deaths by suicide occurred
worldwide,
age-
standardized suicide rates of 11.4 per 100,000 population
(15.0 for males and 8.0 for females)
[1]. Suicide is
considered the second leading cause of death in people
between the ages of 15 and 29 years worldwide [2]. Al-
though the numbers and rates differ significantly between

countries, 75% of all global suicides occur in low and
middle-income countries (LMICs) [1].

Research into suicidal behavior (which includes completed
suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and suicidal ideation)
shows variations with respect to determinants, risk factors
and motivations for such acts. Much of the research has
been conducted in Western, industrialized countries where
mental disorders appear to play a crucial role in suicidal be-
haviors, whereas in non- Western settings (particularly in
South Asian cultures), interpersonal relationship problems
appear to play a more critical role [3, 4].

Reported rates of suicide in several Asian countries ap-
pear to be higher than the average global rates with only
two countries (India and China) contributing more than
45% of the global suicides [5]. Although there has been a
percentage decrease in the rates of both countries, the
numbers still remain high at 258,075 and 120,730
respectively [1, 5]. Pakistan is a low and middle income
country with an estimated population of 200 million,
making it the 6th most populous country in the world
[6]. Ninety-seven percent of its population is Muslim
and the Islamic religion plays an important role in peo-
ples’ daily lives [7]. Approximately 50% of its population
is under the age of 25 years [6]. The country has four
provinces
(Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber
Pakhtunkhawa), several languages, cultures, sub-cultures,
ethnicities and religious sects. Since its independence, the
country has faced major challenges of an unstable political
system and poor governance and the country’s social and
health indicators remain consistently poor [8]. Prevalence
rates of common mental disorders (CMDs) put the figure
as high as 34% [9].

Suicidal behavior remains an under-researched and
under-studied subject in Pakistan [10]. Official mortality
statistics on suicide are not available since they are not
part of the national vital registration system nor reported
to the WHO. Over the last couple of decades, there have
been a growing number of studies on suicide and DSH
that draw attention to the fact that suicidal behavior
is being recognized as a serious public health problem
[11, 12]. However, these are individual level studies that
make it difficult to get a national picture of suicidal
behavior. The recently published WHO report on suicide
estimated that in 2012, there were 13,377 suicides (females
7085; males 6021) in Pakistan, with rates of 7.5 per
100,000 [1]. This is an increase of 2.6% in rates from the
year 2000 [1]. WHO also estimates that for every suicide
there are at least 10–20 acts of DSH. By this estimate,
there may be between 130,000 to 270,000 acts of DSH in
Pakistan annually [1].

Under-reporting and lack of research may occur due
to criminalization of suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The
Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) 325 states “Whoever attempts
to commit suicide and does any act towards the commis-
sion of such offence, shall be punished with simple
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year,
(or with fine, or with both)”. The law itself derives from
the tenants of Islam, which strongly condemns suicidal
behavior [13]. Under this law every case of suicide or
DSH must be taken to one of the city/town’s govern-
ment hospitals that is officially designated as a ‘medico-
legal center’ (MLC). Only the MLCs are authorized to
receive cases of suicide and DSH [13]. In reality how-
ever, people with DSH avoid going to the MLCs, for fear
of legal complications and many seek treatment from

private hospitals. Similarly, the latter, in order to protect
the individual (and themselves) do not report DSH cases
to the police, mislabeling them as either ‘accidental’ or
give them a medical diagnosis. Also, as private medical
care in Pakistan is quite expensive, many people leave
against medical advice after emergency medical treat-
ment [14]. Therefore, due to both financial reasons as
well as legal, socio-cultural and religious stigma sur-
rounding suicidal behavior in Pakistan, the underlying
psychosocial
issues remain largely unaddressed. The
social consequences of suicidal behavior in Pakistan can
be quite significant, with families often stigmatized and
ostracized [14]. Stigmatization of suicidal behavior in
Pakistani society may also be contributing to lack of re-
search on the subject.

Considering the limited evidence available on suicidal
behavior in Pakistan, we conducted a scoping review on
the subject. The study aims to map the available
literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan, to provide a
collective synthesis on the subject, allowing for future
research and to inform policy for suicide prevention
programs in the country. To the best of our knowledge,
no previous study has employed this methodology for
mapping suicidal behavior in Pakistan.

Methods
We conducted a scoping review of suicidal behavior in
Pakistan. Scoping review is recommended in settings
where there is limited evidence on a subject, as it allows
wider coverage of the topic [15].

The following operational definitions were utilized: i)
Suicide is defined as an act of self-harm with a fatal out-
come [16], ii) Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is defined as a
non-fatal act of self-harm carried out with variable moti-
vations [16], iii) Suicidal ideation is defined as thoughts,
ideas and desire to commit suicide [17], iv) Determinants
are a range of behavioral, biological, socio-economic
factors influencing the health of the populations [18] v)
Risk factors are characteristics or attributes within an indi-
vidual that increases the likelihood of a disease [19].

For the review, we followed Arksey and O’Malley’s
(2005) methodological framework, which includes the
following six stages: (i) identification of the research
question (ii) identification of relevant studies (iii) study
selection (iv) data charting (v) data analysis and report-
ing the results (vi) consultation exercise [15].

The methods of this scoping review are described in

light of the above mentioned six stages.

Stage 1: “What are the risk factors and determinants
of suicidal behavior and methods employed in Pakistan?”
Stage 2: We developed a robust search strategy to
identify relevant studies on the topic under review. We
used a combination of key terms, including “Pakistan”
and (“suicide” OR “attempted suicide” OR “parasuicide”

Shekhani et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:44

OR “deliberate self-harm” OR “drug overdose” OR “self-
poisoning” OR “acute poisoning” OR “organophosphate
poisoning” OR “suicidal behavior”).

We searched ten different electronic databases, from
the beginning of their timeframes,
including Applied
Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane
Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine
Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National
Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSY-
CHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science
Citation Index (SCI). Pakmedinet.com, a Pakistani
medical publication website, was also searched for rele-
vant literature. We also searched ‘grey literature’ which
included unpublished theses and other reports. Data-
bases were searched until December 2016.

The literature search was conducted by the head
librarian (KM) who had access to the above databases
via Aga Khan University and University of Alberta li-
brary resources.

Eligibility criteria
The inclusion criteria:

(cid:1) Any study design (primary research, case series or

reports)

(cid:1) Different types of suicidal behavior (including
completed suicides, DSH and suicidal ideation)
(cid:1) Suicidal behavior in both genders and across all ages
(cid:1) Studies focusing on any of the three aspects:

determinants, risk factors or methods employed

The exclusion criteria:

(cid:1) Studies on Pakistanis residing outside the country
(not included because of varied social context)

Variables of

interest in each study included socio-
demographic details, risk factors and methods employed
in the suicidal act.

Stage 3: For study selection, screening was undertaken
in two steps. Two reviewers (SS and DH) first screened
the abstracts. After application of eligibility criteria, full
text of the remaining articles were retrieved, which were
also screened by the two reviewers.

Stage 4: The retained articles were entered in a data
charting form, developed on Microsoft Excel, based on
the literature review and research question. Key attri-
butes of the data charting form included the site of the
study, study design, number of subjects and outcome
measures, along with specific information on risk
factors, determinants and in cases of suicide and DSH,
the methods employed. The form was pilot tested and
modifications were made accordingly.

Stage 5: Information on distribution and nature of
studies was extracted from data charting forms and
reported after manual synthesis. The research question
consisted of risk factors, determinants and methods
employed that formed the basis for analysis. Main char-
acteristics of studies on completed suicides and DSH
were also reported in a tabular form. In cases where
there was an overlap between risk factors and determi-
nants, it was resolved via mutual consultation within the
research team and reported separately.

Stage 6: We also undertook a consultation exercise
with the subject expert (MMK) in order to add strength
to our study. He also provided additional articles, which
were included in the scoping review.

The subject expert also read the results and provided
feedback, adding extra value to the review. Badger et al.
(2000) recommend utilization of existing knowledge and
networks generation of information on primary research
[20].

Results
Through the ten search engines we initially retrieved
623 articles, of which 265 were duplicates and were
excluded (Fig. 1). Two reviewers (SS and DS) reviewed
the abstracts of the remaining 358 articles individually.
In addition, 12 articles were also retrieved from the sub-
ject expert. Eighty-two studies not conducted in Pakistan
or covering Pakistani population, one poster presenta-
four conference proceedings, three articles that

excluded. One hundred and eighteen articles were read
in full, out of which 11 were further excluded (nine were
not relevant to our research question, one was a confer-
ence abstract and in one, information was difficult to
extract), leaving us with 107 articles. To this number,
one report and two PhD dissertations were added, giving
a final total of 110 articles included for the final review.

that did not cover

Forty-eight studies were conducted in Sindh (39 from
Karachi), 31 in Punjab (16 from Lahore and 11 from
Rawalpindi/Islamabad), 9 from KPK (7 from Peshawar)
and 2 in Baluchistan. The remaining 20 were describing
trends from all over Pakistan.

The reviewed articles consisted of 25 cross-sectional
surveys, fourteen prospective case-series and 45 retro-
spective case series. There were only five case-control
studies and only one randomized control trial. 19 articles
were literature reviews, commentaries or editorials. One
paper was a population-based cohort study.

Rates of suicide or DSH were mentioned in only six
studies. Two studies determined rates through descrip-
tive study designs, whereas two from literature review

to 2.86/100,000 (in 2006)

and archival researches. Two studies determined rates of
suicides for individual cities [21, 22]. Suicide rates varied
from 0.43/100,000/year (for the years 1991–2000) in
Peshawar
in Rawalpindi.
Gender-specific rates showed lowest and highest rates
for men were 0.61/100,000 in Peshawar and 5.2/100,000
in Rawalpindi, respectively and for women 0.23/100,000
in Peshawar and 1.77/100,000 in Larkana, respectively
[10, 23]. Average suicide rates for the years 1985–1999
in the province of Sindh was calculated to be 1.15/
100,000 population v[10].

Determinants
Gender differences were reported in almost all studies of
both completed suicides and DSH. Collectively, more
males than females committed suicide. However, 18
studies on DSH reported more females than males, while
the trend was reversed in 10 studies. Suicidal ideation
was more common in females than males. Data on
gender and marital status was not disaggregated in all
studies but in studies where disaggregation was done,
they showed there are more married than single females
in both suicides and DSH [24–26].

A number of studies focused on suicidal behavior in
Pakistani women exclusively: six studies on suicidal
ideation, three on completed suicides and two on DSH.
A study on suicide in women in the Ghizer district in
the remote Northern areas of Pakistan showed average
annual rates of 14.89/100,000 for the years 2000–2004,
with rates in those of over 15 years of age as 33.22/
100,000. Important correlates were domestic violence
and high levels of psychiatric morbidity [27].

More than half of the studies reported the age of their
study sample but used different age ranges. Both suicide
and DSH appears to be more common among the
young, with majority being less than 30 years of age.

‘Unemployment’ or ‘financial hardship’ as a cause of
suicidal behavior was also mentioned in a few studies (8
studies on suicide, 8 on DSH and one on suicidal
ideation). Unemployment rates varied from 4% to 39%
in suicides and from 4% to 86% for DSH. A case-control
study of 100 suicides and matched living controls in
Karachi showed that 39% of cases were unemployed as
compared to 17% of controls [28].

Two studies (one for DSH and one for suicidal
ideation) reported on the association between level of
income and suicidal behavior. 46%–67% of those who

engaged in suicidal behavior had an income of
less
than Rs. 6000 per month (US $60) [23, 29]. In four
DSH studies, 67% to 91% belonged to lower socio-
economic class, whereas only 1% to 4% belonged to
upper class [30–33].

Level of education was reported in 14 studies: 3 for
suicidal
ideation, 2 for completed suicides and 9 for
DSH and showed that suicidal behavior was more com-
mon among those who had little or no education, with
rates varying from 30% to 60%. In the case-control study
on suicide, 21% of cases were uneducated as compared
to 4% of controls [28].

Other determinants that were reported in some
studies included occupation. Housewives were 20% to
60% while students were 4% to 17.5% of the study
sample [28, 34, 35].

Risk factors
While determinants for suicidal behavior were men-
tioned in several studies (above), only two studies (both
were case-control design) investigated risk factors for
suicide and DSH specifically. In the DSH study, ‘mental
illnesses, low socio-economic status and loneliness’ were
found to the risk factors for patients presenting to three
emergency departments of Karachi, while the case-
control psychological autopsy study of suicide identified
six factors: life-events, disrupted social network, level of
academic qualification, marital
status, ethnicity and
depression, that were linked to very high Population
Attributable Risk Fractions (PARFs) ranging from 37%
for education to 97% for life events [28].

There has been only one intervention trial for suicidal
behavior in Pakistan, that compared the efficacy of a
brief psychological intervention (delivered following an
episode of self-harm) with treatment as usual (TAU)
[36]. Patients in the intervention group showed statisti-
cally significant improvement on the Beck Scale for
Suicide Ideation and Beck Hopelessness
Inventory,
which was sustained at 3 months [36].

Methods for suicidal behavior
Methods of suicide and DSH were reported in more
than 50% of
the studies. The three most common
methods for suicide in Pakistan appear to be hanging,
firearms [21, 36–38].
ingesting poisons and use of
Amongst ‘poisons’, the majority of victims used insecti-
cides and pesticides,
(that contain organophosphate
(OP) compounds), that are available in most homes in
the urban areas and used in agriculture in the rural areas
of Pakistan respectively. Despite being freely available
over-the-counter, medications (including analgesics and
psychotropics) are not used widely as means to commit
suicide.
In contrast, self-poisoning with medications
(particularly benzodiazepines) was the most common

method in DSH in the urban areas [39]. On the other
hand, self-poisoning was more common in both suicide
and DSH in semi-urban or rural areas [40].

Discussion
This scoping review is the first attempt to synthesize the
available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The
results reveal that there are significant gaps in evidence.
the studies are from the main urban
centers of the country, and there is dearth of data from
rural areas, despite the fact that almost two-thirds of the
population in Pakistan lives in rural areas.

Majority of

Most of

the studies reviewed were descriptive in
nature (majority were case series and cross-sectional
surveys that do not allow for the establishment of rela-
tionships), with only five case-control studies.

A number of studies were on “unnatural deaths”, in
which the manner of death (for example, whether acci-
dental, homicidal or suicidal) was not disaggregated,
making it difficult to study the characteristics (such as
age, gender or marital status) of the suicidal group
separately.

Lack of official statistics for suicide prevents the prob-
lem being recognized. Since suicide and DSH remain
criminal acts in Pakistan, this further poses a challenge
in accurate data collection [41]. Studies have reported a
discrepancy in reported rates between newspaper reports
and police data [42]. In Pakistan, given the strong reli-
gious views against suicide, decriminalization may be
perceived as endorsing suicidal behavior as a way out of
one’s problems [43]. However, as the WHO estimates
show (an increase of 2.6% in suicide rates between 2000
and 2012) religion may not be as strong a deterrent as
previously perceived [1]. Decriminalization would have
the effect of partly decreasing the stigma surrounding
the act, thus allowing people to seek help without fear of
prosecution or harassment by the law enforcement au-
thorities. Although the Mental Health Act of 2001 has
made some provisions for the protection of those who
attempt suicide by including that “a person who attempts
suicide shall be assessed by an approved psychiatrist and
if found to be suffering from a mental disorder shall be
treated appropriately under
this
Ordinance”, this has yet to translate into practice. More
recently, there is some indication that suicidal behavior
may be decriminalized in Pakistan [44]. Indeed if this
was to happen, it would be a major step in eliminating
the stigma and addressing the psychological needs of
suicidal persons in the country.

the provisions of

Despite the poor quality of many studies one consistent
finding that emerges in our review is that gender is an im-
portant determinant for suicide and DSH in Pakistan, es-
pecially when considered in the context of marital status.
There was a larger representation of married women

Shekhani et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:44 

Page 12 of 15

compared to single women or married or single men. It
appears that unlike the West, where it is protective, mar-
riage is a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity and suicidal
behavior for Pakistani women [45]. Associated factors in-
clude early age of marriage, lack of autonomy in choice of
male partner (‘arranged marriage’), pressure to have
children early in the marriage, desire for a male offspring,
curtailment of education, economic dependence on
husband, joint or extended family system and domes-
tic violence [46]. These factors put many young mar-
ried women in Pakistan in a highly disadvantaged
position and many resort to suicidal behavior as a
way to express their distress. Other studies report
that being a female in Pakistan is in itself a risk
factor for suicide and DSH, with lack of employment
being a significant determinant, and its association
with issues of control and empowerment [47].

This scoping review shows that majority of individuals
who engaged in suicidal behavior are below the age of
30 years, underscoring the need to address mental health
and other issues faced by young people in Pakistan. Con-
versely, suicide and DSH was uncommon among the
elderly, a finding that is in sharp contrast to studies from
the West [48]. Part of the explanation may lie in the fact
that in Pakistan, few elderly people are socially isolated
or live on their own where they have to fend for them-
selves. The majority are looked after by their families,
who provide both physical as well as financial support.

Unemployment and financial hardships appear to be
strongly correlated with both suicide and DSH, particu-
larly among males in Pakistan [49]. Unemployment,
poor economic conditions and rising poverty are macro
factors in suicidal behaviors that need to be
level
addressed at policy levels [50].

Low educational attainment strongly correlated with
both suicide and DSH in the studies we reviewed. This
is likely mediated through poor stress coping abilities,
inability to compete for jobs or acquire greater social
standing [51].

Our scoping review showed that poisoning is the
second most common method (after hanging) in suicides
in Pakistan. Amongst poisons, organophosphorous
compounds feature highly in both DSH and suicide.
These substances are highly toxic due to their anticho-
linesterase effects, leading to a high case-fatality index
(even in cases with low suicidal intent). The free avail-
ability of pesticides in rural areas pose particular risk to
those working in the agriculture sector in Pakistan,
shown by their increased use in cases of self-poisoning.
This is compounded by the absence of quality medical
care in cases of poisonings in Pakistan.

As part of its suicide prevention strategy, the WHO
lists restricting access to toxic agents as one of
its
recommendations. Trials of ‘locked boxes’ (that restrict

access to toxic pesticides in crisis situations) undertaken
in India and Sri Lanka have given encouraging results
[52]. WHO also recommends use of less toxic pesticides
for agricultural purposes, i.e. Class I OP pesticides and
Class II endosulfan [52]. Both these measures could be
applied for suicide prevention in Pakistan.

The increased use of firearms in suicides in Pakistan
reflects their growing availability in the country, esti-
mated at more than 20 million (of which only 7 million
are registered), with almost 13,000 annual homicides
[53]. There is urgent need for firearm control
in the
country.

This paper highlights the lack of studies on risk factors
for suicide and DSH in Pakistan. Mental illness as a risk
factor
is addressed in a small minority of studies
reviewed. This may be due to the fact that most studies
in our review were conducted by non-mental health pro-
fessionals [33, 54, 55], who are not sensitized to study
mental illness in suicidal behaviors. Data is also biased
away from mental illness as a risk factor due to stigma
illness and suicidal behavior in
surrounding mental
itself.

There are serious lacunae and weaknesses in the
current system of registration and diagnosing of suicidal
behavior in Pakistan. There is lack of standardized
system of certifying suicidal deaths across the country.
Processes to investigate suicides are weak and influenced
by socio-political and cultural factors. For example due
to stigma it is not uncommon for families to have the
suicidal death registered as an accident or a medical
condition [2]. Conversely, many cases of homicide (par-
ticularly where the woman is set on fire by the husband
and/or in-laws) are labeled as self- immolation suicides.
Therefore, there is underreporting of suicidal behaviors
in the country, the true extent of which is difficult to
determine.

Currently, data on suicide and DSH is neither included
in the National Health Morbidity Statistics nor reported
to the WHO. As a consequence national rates of suicide
are not known [1]. On the other hand, as several health-
facility based studies in our review show, cases of DSH
do report to health facilities across the country. With
decriminalization and a proper system for recording and
collating data, it is possible to get a better picture of the
problem in the country.

Recommendations
There is an urgent need for DSH and suicide mortality
statistics to be collected through a standard system of
registration, recording and diagnosis, at all town/city,
district and provincial levels throughout the country. The
information obtained can be used for epidemiological-
analytical,
intra-country and cross-national studies. A
mandatory reporting of suicide mortality statistics to the

Shekhani et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:44 

Page 13 of 15

WHO would help improve data collection and surveil-
lance of suicides and DSH in Pakistan.

Based on this review’s findings, there emerges a need
for improving the system of investigating and diagnosing
suicides in the country. Training and education of key
personnel involved in the process is vital, including the
police, medico-legal officers, forensic medical specialists
as well as general/family physicians.

Prohibiting use of the more toxic pesticides and re-
placing them with less toxic ones can help prevent many
suicidal deaths, especially those with a low suicidal in-
tent. There is need for improved emergency medical
treatment for DSH victims, particularly those of self-
poisoning with toxic agents.

This scoping review signifies that the existing evidence
on suicidal behavior is limited in the context of Pakistan.
Therefore, more robust analytical research designs such
as case control and psychological autopsy methods are
needed with a focus on risk factors, particularly mental
illness. There is also need for intervention studies for
prevention of suicidal behaviors in Pakistan.

All of the above recommendations demonstrate the
need to have suicide prevention programs with an inte-
grated research agenda in the existing health systems of
Pakistan.
