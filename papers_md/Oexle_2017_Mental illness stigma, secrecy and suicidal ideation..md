Aims. Whether the public stigma associated with mental illness negatively affects an individual, largely depends on
whether the person has been labelled ‘mentally ill’. For labelled individuals concealing mental illness is a common strat-
egy to cope with mental illness stigma, despite secrecy’s potential negative consequences. In addition, initial evidence
points to a link between stigma and suicidality, but quantitative data from community samples are lacking.

Methods. Based on previous literature about mental illness stigma and suicidality, as well as about the potential influ-
ence of labelling processes and secrecy, a theory-driven model linking perceived mental illness stigma and suicidal idea-
tion by a mediation of secrecy and hopelessness was established. This model was tested separately among labelled and
unlabelled persons using data derived from a Swiss cross-sectional population-based study. A large community sample
of people with elevated psychiatric symptoms was examined by interviews and self-report, collecting information on
perceived stigma, secrecy, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. Participants who had ever used mental health services
were considered as labelled ‘mentally ill’. A descriptive analysis, stratified logistic regression models and a path analysis
testing a three-path mediation effect were conducted.

Results. While no significant differences between labelled and unlabelled participants were observed regarding per-
ceived stigma and secrecy, labelled individuals reported significantly higher frequencies of suicidal ideation and feel-
ings of hopelessness. More perceived stigma was associated with suicidal ideation among labelled, but not among
unlabelled individuals. In the path analysis, this link was mediated by increased secrecy and hopelessness.

Conclusions. Results from this study indicate that among persons labelled ‘mentally ill’, mental illness stigma is a con-
tributor to suicidal ideation. One explanation for this association is the relation perceived stigma has with secrecy, which
introduces negative emotional consequences. If our findings are replicated, they would suggest that programmes
empowering people in treatment for mental illness to cope with anticipated and experienced discrimination as well
as interventions to reduce public stigma within society could improve suicide prevention.

Introduction

People with mental disorders commonly face stigma-
tising stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination. The
anticipation and experience of being stigmatised in
one’s everyday life introduce a variety of negative con-
sequences, including low rates of help-seeking behav-
iour, unemployment, social isolation, impaired quality
of life, low self-esteem, and feelings of shame and hope-
lessness (Rüsch et al. 2005; Link & Phelan, 2013).

Whether or not individuals have been labelled as
‘mentally ill’, they tend to perceive similar levels of
negative attitudes or public
stigma in society.
stigma’s
impact varies greatly across

different persons with mental health problems
(Corrigan & Watson, 2002; Rüsch et al. 2006). A poten-
tial explanation for this variability is provided by the
Modified Labelling Theory, developed by Link et al.
(1989). The theory implies that stigmatising miscon-
ceptions present in society are only relevant for per-
sons labelled as ‘mentally ill’. One of
the most
important reasons for being labelled is the use of men-
tal health services (Link et al. 1989). While the percep-
tion of mental illness stigma is largely irrelevant for
unlabelled persons, labelled individuals are likely to
develop fear of social rejection and adapt coping strat-
egies. A key strategy is to conceal one’s mental illness
in order to avoid the label and the resulting stigma.
Even though secrecy reduces discrimination, it can be
harmful, leading to increased cognitive and emotional
distress in terms of self-consciousness, hypervigilance,
feelings of shame, guilt, helplessness, sadness, hope-
lessness, fear of discovery and the decisional conflict

Many of the negative emotional consequences intro-
duced by mental illness stigma (e.g., low self-esteem,
feelings of loneliness, shame, hopelessness) are also
predictors of suicidality (Rüsch et al. 2014). With glo-
bally around 1 000 000 completed suicides per year
and many more attempted suicides, the topic is a
major
(World Health
Organization, 2014). Even though suicide is a very
complex phenomenon with a variety of social and
individual risk factors, previous research has consist-
ently identified psychiatric disorders to be a key deter-
minant for suicidality (Selby et al. 2014; World Health
Organization, 2014). Psychological autopsy studies
showed that in around 90% of suicide victims evidence
for the presence of a psychiatric disorder can be found
(Cavanagh et al. 2003). However, even though mental
illness is strongly associated with suicide, not everyone
with a mental illness experiences suicidality (Harris &
Barraclough, 1997; Bostwick & Pankratz, 2000; Miret
et al. 2013). Thus, the anticipation or experience of
mental illness stigma has been hypothesised as provid-
ing at least a partial explanation for the observed vari-
ability in suicide risk among persons with psychiatric
disorders (Rüsch et al. 2014).

Recent research testing this hypothesis has found
initial evidence for
its validity. For example, a
population-based study using data from several
European countries reported that national mental ill-
ness stigma levels were positively associated with
national suicide rates (Schomerus et al. 2015), and
two other studies found positive associations between
suicidality and self-stigma, stigma stress and shame
(Sharaf et al. 2012; Bryan et al. 2013). Additionally, in
qualitative research, patients reported that experienced
discrimination due to their mental illness contributed
to their suicidal behaviour (Farrelly et al. 2015).

Even though previous studies provided interesting
findings, the association and the underlying paths
between mental illness stigma and suicidality remain
unclear. In addition, so far research examined partici-
pants within clinical settings or data derived from rep-
resentative population polls. To date, no study
examined the association between perceived mental ill-
ness stigma and suicidal ideation in a community sam-
ple of persons with elevated psychiatric symptoms,
investigating the influence of labelling due to mental
health service use.

model linking perceived mental illness stigma and sui-
cidal ideation by a mediation of secrecy and hopeless-
ness, using data from a large community sample of
people with elevated psychiatric symptoms. Based on
Modified Labelling Theory, perceived mental illness
stigma was expected to be positively associated with
suicidal ideation among persons labelled as ‘mentally
ill’ by previous mental health service use, but not
among unlabelled individuals. In addition, a three-path
mediation of secrecy and hopelessness was expected to
at least partially explain the association between per-
ceived mental illness stigma and suicidal ideation.

Methods

Design and participants

All data were derived from the Epidemiology survey of
the ZInEP-study (Zurich Program for Sustainable
Development of Mental Health Services, www.zinep.
ch), a cross-sectional population-based study conducted
between August 2010 and September 2012 that aimed
to assess the prevalence of common mental disorders
and the use of mental health care services among peo-
ple living in the Canton of Zurich in Switzerland (for
details see Ajdacic-Gross et al. 2014). Telephone screen-
ing interviews among a random sample of people aged
20–years drawn from the Zurich population registry
were conducted (N = 9829). During the telephone inter-
views, Global Severity Index (GSI) scores of participants
were obtained using the Symptom Checklist-27
(SCL-27) (Hardt et al. 2004). On 27 items participants
indicated their level of distress due to symptoms of
mental illness during the last 7 days on a five-point
Likert scale. The GSI was defined as the mean score
across all items, and a 75th percentile cut-off point
was used to stratify the total sample into low and
high scorers. Then, one random sample within each of
the two groups was drawn to participate in subsequent
face-to-face interviews and complete questionnaires
(600 low scorers and 900 high scorers).

The present study analysed participants screened
with a GSI equal or above the 75th percentile (high
scorers, N = 900). Due to missing values in the question-
naire data, 681 individuals remained for the statistical
analysis. For the purpose of this project, the study sam-
ple was stratified based on lifetime mental health ser-
vice use to compare results among unlabelled persons
(N = 252) and those labelled as ‘mentally ill’ (N = 429).

past 12 months did you have the feeling you would
not mind being dead, or did you have plans to hurt
yourself?’ followed by the question: ‘During the past
12 months, did you experience vague or serious sui-
cidal thoughts, death wishes, suicide attempts?’ Since
sufficient severity was reflected in both questions,
everyone who answered with ‘yes’ on either of the
two questions was classified as having experienced
suicidal ideation during the past 12 months.

Perceived mental illness stigma, or the perception of
how negatively most people view individuals with a
mental
illness, was assessed using the 12-item
Perceived Devaluation Discrimination Questionnaire
(PDDQ) (Link et al. 1989). Participants rated statements
reflecting typical public stereotypes from 1 (not true at
all) to 6 (very true), e.g., ‘Most people believe that
entering a mental hospital is a sign of personal failure’.
Higher mean values indicated more perceived mental
illness stigma (Cronbach’s α in this study is 0.87).
Secrecy was measured using the nine-item secrecy sub-
scale of the Stigma Coping Orientation Scales (SCOS)
(Link et al. 2002). Participants indicated their opinion
on whether mental illness should be concealed, e.g.,
‘If you have ever been in treatment for a serious mental
illness, the best thing to do is to keep it a secret.’
Answers were made from 1 (not true at all) to 6
indicating
(very true) with higher mean scores
increased secrecy (Cronbach’s α in this study is 0.89).
Feelings of hopelessness were assessed during the
face-to-face interviews as part of a questionnaire focus-
ing on symptoms of major depressive disorder.
Participants were asked whether they had experienced
feelings of hopelessness during the past 12 months and
responded on a binary scale (no v. yes). Depressive
symptoms were assessed by the respective four-item
subscale of the SCL-27 (Hardt et al. 2004).

As mentioned earlier, persons who had ever used
mental health services were considered as labelled

‘mentally ill’. People were asked about their previous
and current mental health service use and classified
as either ‘never used services’ (unlabelled) or ‘ever
used services’ (labelled). Mental health service use
was assessed via self-report and defined as having
sought professional help for a mental health problem,
including seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist or general
practitioner.

Statistical analyses

The distributions of continuous variables in the total
sample and among the two subgroups (labelled v.
unlabelled) were examined visually and no violation
of the normal distribution assumption was found. In
addition, a correlation matrix of independent variables
and the outcome was examined to rule out potential
multicollinearity. Characteristics of the sample were
described and t-tests (continuous variables) or chi-
square (χ2) tests (categorical variables) were calculated
to test for significant differences between the groups
(Table 1). Bivariate associations with suicidality using
point-biserial correlation for continuous independent
variables and χ2 tests and phi (ϕ)-coefficients for categor-
ical independent variables were estimated (Table 2).
Subsequently, multiple binary logistic regression models
of perceived mental illness stigma on suicidal ideation
were performed (Table 3). The first model did not include
any potential mediating or confounding variables; there-
after, mediators and confounders were consecutively
added to the analysis.

Finally, a path analysis based on the hypothesised
multiple mediation model was conducted (Fig. 1). All
paths were controlled for depressive symptoms, age
and sex. Since a dichotomous outcome was modelled,
diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) were used
as a robust alternative for the maximum likelihood esti-
mation (Steinmetz, 2014). Thus, effects are reported as

Results

Descriptive analysis

Comparing participants with complete data to those
with missing values, we found no significant differ-
ences with regard to suicidal ideation (16.5% among
non-completers and 20.2% among completers, p =
0.12), hopelessness (40.0% among non-completers
and 37.6% among completers, p = 0.38), GSI-scores
(mean 2.11 among non-completers and mean 2.10
among completers, p = 0.91) and depressive symptoms
(mean 2.37 among completers and mean 2.35 among
non-completers, p = 0.76). Non-completers were of
younger age than completers (28.9 v. 30 years, respect-
ively, p = 0.04) and showed a different gender-
distribution, with 40% of non-completers being female,
compared with 58.3% female participants with com-
plete data ( p < 0.001).

After the exclusion of persons with missing data, the
final study sample was almost equally split in terms of
gender (53.7% female) and on average about 30 years
old (range 21–42). Most participants were single

and 21.6% were married. Although 18% reported to

Bivariate analysis

Table 2 presents the results of the bivariate analysis
testing the association between independent variables
and suicidal ideation. Among participants labelled by
mental health service use, a significant positive associ-
ation was found between perceived mental
illness
stigma and suicidal ideation. In both groups, hopeless-
ness and depressive symptoms were positively asso-
ciated with suicidal ideation.

In addition, among unlabelled persons, perceived
stigma was positively associated with secrecy (r = 0.32,

p < 0.001), and no relationship was found between
secrecy and hopelessness (r = −0.01, p = 0.88). Among
labelled individuals a significant positive association
was found between perceived stigma and secrecy
(r = 0.37, p < 0.001) and between secrecy and hopeless-
ness (r = 0.12, p < 0.05). Among both groups, perceived
stigma was not associated with feelings of hopelessness
(labelled group: r = 0.06, p = 0.19; unlabelled group:
r = −0.03, p = 0.63).

Logistic regression analysis

In accordance with our hypothesis, in block 1, per-
ceived mental illness stigma was associated with sui-
cidal
ideation among people who had ever used
mental health services, but not among those who
had never used such services (Table 3). When secrecy
was included in the model (block 2), the previously
observed positive association between perceived men-
tal illness stigma and suicidal ideation among those
labelled by service use was no longer significant.
Replacing secrecy with feelings of hopelessness
(block 3), a similar phenomenon was observed with
a decreased but marginally significant effect of per-
ceived stigma on suicidal
ideation. Including both,
secrecy and feelings of hopelessness in the same
model further diminished the effects (block 4). In a
last step, depressive symptoms, sex and age were
included (block 5). Among both groups, a strong posi-
tive association with suicidal ideation was found for
hopelessness and depressive symptoms.

of secrecy and hopelessness in the association between
two-path

analyses were performed (Fig. 1). Analyses were done
separately for the two previously established groups,
comparing labelled persons who had ever used mental
health services to unlabelled individuals who had
never used services. Saturated models (estimated para-
meters = data points) were estimated for both groups,
and therefore model fit could not be evaluated. Even
though two degrees of freedom were present in both
models, low correlations between the variables could
have led to little restriction within the models, result-
ing in model saturation. This is clearly indicated by
inflated TLI and CFI values and RMSEA equal to
zero (Table 4) (Hancock & Mueller, 2013).

Path estimates obtained from the path analysis are
shown in Fig. 1. Strong positive significant associations
between perceived mental illness stigma and secrecy
as well as between hopelessness and suicidal ideation
were observed in both models. While secrecy was posi-
tively associated with hopelessness among people
with a history of mental health service use, no signifi-
cant association was found among persons who had
never used services. To test indirect effects of mental
illness stigma on suicidal ideation the bootstrapping
approach was used and a significant three-path medi-
ation effect of secrecy and hopelessness was found
among people labelled as ‘mentally ill’ ( p < 0.01), but
not among the unlabelled persons ( p = 0.98). Among
the labelled participants, a pseudo R2 of 0.26 was
found for suicidal ideation, compared with a pseudo
R2 of 0.19 among the unlabelled persons.

Discussion

ideation,

Testing a theory-driven model to explain the associ-
ation between perceived mental illness stigma and sui-
increased perceived stigma was
cidal
associated with suicidal
ideation only among the
labelled individuals. This was explained by a three-
path mediation effect of secrecy and hopelessness.

Our findings add to previous research on mental ill-
ness stigma contributing to suicidality (Sharaf et al.
2012; Bryan et al. 2013; Niederkrotenthaler et al. 2014;
Reynders et al. 2014; Farrelly et al. 2015; Schomerus
et al. 2015). Previous studies could not clarify whether
the labelling status might alter the relationship between

mental illness stigma and suicidality. Consistent with
Modified Labelling Theory,
in the labelled and the
unlabelled groups we found similar, moderately posi-
tive associations between the level of perceived stigma
and the attitude that psychiatric disorders should be
concealed. However, only among those labelled by pre-
vious mental health service use more perceived stigma
was significantly associated with suicidal
ideation.
While unlabelled persons appeared to be unaffected
by perceived stigma, secrecy was linked to hopelessness
in the labelled group. A likely explanation is that only in
the labelled group secrecy shapes individuals’ actual
social behaviour and thus becomes harmful in terms
of hopelessness and social isolation. This is consistent
with previous findings on harmful consequences of
secrecy among minority group members (Pachankis,
2007). In line with Modified Labelling Theory, our find-
ings indicate that being labelled as ‘mentally ill’ might
be a crucial factor in explaining the observed variation
in the impact perceived mental illness stigma has on
people with psychiatric disorders.

This study has several strengths. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first to use a large community sam-
ple with elevated psychiatric symptoms to examine a
potential pathway between perceived mental
illness
ideation. While all participants
stigma and suicidal
reported elevated psychiatric symptoms, only around
two-thirds had ever used mental health services and
we therefore could examine the role of labelling status.
However, limitations of the study should be consid-
ered. Logistic regression modelling requires a suffi-
cient number of cases to obtain reliable estimates
(Hosmer et al. 2013). However, while earlier work
recommended the 10 : 1 rule (ten events per parameter;
Peduzzi et al. 1996), as illustrated by Vittinghoff &
McCulloch (2007) a 5 : 1 rule is legitimate. Further,
our labelling variable (lifetime mental health service
use) does not identify all persons labelled as ‘mentally
ill’ and thus introduces misclassification bias. Even
though having never utilised mental health services,
a person might still perceive herself as a member of
the stigmatised group (i.e., as labelled) if other classify-
ing attributes are present (e.g., recognising symptoms
as a mental disorder). Even though the definition of
the mediating variables was based on pertinent litera-
ture, other potential mediators could have been

omitted and other effects of the chosen variables are
possible (e.g., confounding effects). Regarding the
used measures, the limited information of a binary
scale must be acknowledged. In addition, underreport-
ing of suicidal ideation is likely since suicide is a large-
ly stigmatised topic (Sudak et al. 2008). Thus a
systematic misclassification of cases is possible with
people who are more aware of mental illness stigma
not disclosing their suicidal ideation. As a consequence
the obtained results might underestimate the true asso-
ciation between perceived mental illness stigma and
ideation. In the path analysis, pseudo R2
suicidal
values indicated small explanatory power; however,
the obtained path estimates provide support for the
hypothesised mediation effect. Finally, even though
the analysis of mediating effects in cross-sectional
data is common, the interpretation of obtained results
in terms of causality demands caution as reverse caus-
ality is possible (Gu et al. 2014).

Conclusion

In summary, our results indicate that among persons
labelled as ‘mentally ill’ the perception of mental ill-
ness stigma contributes to suicidal
ideation, which
was explained by increased secrecy and hopelessness.
If replicated, our findings suggest that programmes
empowering people in treatment for mental illness to
cope with anticipated and experienced discrimination
as well as interventions to reduce mental illness stigma
within the society could improve suicide prevention.
