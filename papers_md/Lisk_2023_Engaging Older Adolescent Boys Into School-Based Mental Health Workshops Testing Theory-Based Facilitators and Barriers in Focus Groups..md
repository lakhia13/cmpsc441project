Abstract
Untreated mental health problems continue from childhood and adolescence into adulthood, meaning accessible early
intervention is essential to reduce long-term negative outcomes. However, there is often a reluctance to engage in men-
tal health treatment, with considerable evidence that young men are less likely to seek help than young women. This
original research study aimed to explore four areas of interest around facilitating engagement of adolescent boys to a
stress workshop intervention for adolescents in U.K. schools. The areas explored were male role models, destigmatiz-
ing language, trust building, and using a transparent and collaborative approach. We also sought to understand the main
barriers to engagement. To explore these areas of interest, two focus groups were run, with a total of 12 young men,
over two regional sites (London and Bath). Content analysis was used to analyze the data. Participants particularly val-
ued transparency and collaboration as strong facilitators to engagement. Building of trust was the next most popular.
Use of role models and destigmatizing language were the joint third most popular methods. The main barrier to help-
seeking identified was perceived threat to masculine identity (self and social stigma). Given these novel findings, the fac-
tors of transparency and collaboration and building trust as facilitators merit further research, among both adults and
adolescents.

Introduction

For a significant portion of men, mental health prob-
lems in childhood and adolescence continue into
adulthood if left untreated (Odgers et al., 2007).
However, there is consistent evidence that men are
reluctant
to seek help from health professionals
(Sierra Hernandez et al., 2014; Slade et al., 2009). In
particular, seeking help for mental health problems is
significantly less common in men than women
(Andrews et al., 2001; McManus et al., 2016; Yousaf
et al., 2015). A 2020 government review in the United
Kingdom found that one in six individuals aged 16
and above reported experiencing symptoms of a com-
mon mental disorder (CMD) within the past week.
CMDs were more commonly reported by women than

men across all age categories, with the highest preva-
lence among those aged 16 to 24. Women were also
more likely than men to enter treatment after referral

and to finish a course of treatment (Baker, 2020). Of
note, there is also evidence suggesting boys start to
disengage from health services around the time of ado-
lescence (Marcell et al., 2002; Mason-Jones et al.,
2012), which is also a significant period of onset for
some mental health disorders (Beesdo et al., 2009).
Therefore, there is a clear need to improve upon our
current success in encouraging young men to seek and
sustain help for their mental health.

Although there is a significant body of literature on
help-seeking behavior in adult men with mental health
problems, there is limited research on this topic in
adolescents (Rice et al., 2018; Sagar-Ouriaghli et al.,
2019; Seidler et al., 2016, 2019). However, it is crucial
to understand the patterns of help-seeking behavior in
adolescents, considering 50% of mental health prob-
lems occur by age 14, and 75% by age 24 (Kessler
et al., 2007). In light of this, it is pertinent to begin by
presenting the existing literature on key theoretical
accounts of barriers and facilitators to help-seeking in
adult and younger men, as this knowledge will serve
as a foundation for formulating effective strategies to
engage adolescent young men in seeking help for their
mental health concerns.

Conformity to masculine norms has been heavily
implicated in reducing help-seeking behaviors of men.
Particularly within Western cultures, boys are socia-
lized to embody ‘‘traditional’’ masculine roles that
actively discourage vulnerability and weakness (Evans
et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014). In a recent review of the
literature, Seidler and colleagues (2016) reported that
conformity to masculine norms had a negative effect
on men’s expression and management of symptoms,
as well as their attitudes to, intention toward, and
actual help-seeking behavior. Self and social stigma
have also been identified as barriers to help-seeking:
Feelings of shame can be seen as intertwined with self-
stigma and the threat posed to one’s masculine iden-
tity when confronted with the prospect of seeking help
for mental ill-health. Social stigma has identified as
having greater prevalence in men compared with
women (Corrigan & Watson, 2007; Latalova et al.,
2014). Thus, self-stigma, and associated feelings of
shame, can often result in avoidance of help-seeking
and (consequently) negative long-term health out-
comes (Rice et al., 2016; Sorsoli et al., 2008). Research
with adolescent boys has identified shame (and a need
to protect their reputation) as a significant barrier to
seeking help-seeking (Rice et al., 2016). Research indi-
cates that adolescent boys and young men may experi-
ence feelings of shame more intensely than girls or
young women when their masculine identity is threat-
ened (Vandello et al., 2008). Vandello and Bosson

(2013) propose that manhood is viewed as a precar-
ious social status that is challenging to attain and
maintain, leading to maladaptive behaviors to uphold
their gender status and avoidance of beneficial beha-
viors like help-seeking.

Young men struggle with mental health symptom
recognition and literacy compared with young
women (Rice et al., 2018). Cotton et al (2006)
reported that when interviewing 1,207 young people
between 12 and 25 years of age, female respondents
(60.7%) were significantly more likely to correctly
identify depression in a vignette compared with male
respondents (34.5%). In addition, mental health lit-
eracy can also be considered as the understanding
and awareness of mental health services (Jorm,
2000). There is significant evidence to suggest that
the ability to identify mental health symptoms does
not always
to help-seeking behavior
(Bonabi et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2004). The
ability to connect one’s experience to an appropriate
service is equally as important (Bonabi et al., 2016;
Thompson et al., 2004). Research has reported this
knowledge of relevant services to be lower in both
men (Lynch et al., 2018; Rafal et al., 2018) and ado-
lescents (Attygalle et al., 2017).

translate

Several approaches have now been proposed within
the research literature to address these challenges.
These can be identified as:

Normalizing Help-Seeking With Positive Masculinity
and Utilization of Role Models

Conforming to masculine norms may hinder help-
seeking, but some ‘‘masculine’’ traits can be useful in
mental health treatment. Kiselica and Englar-Carlson
(2010) propose a positive psychology/positive masculi-
nity framework that emphasizes male strengths and
traditional male approaches like problem-solving,
rather than ‘‘deficit models’’ of masculinity (which
emphasize what is ‘‘wrong’’ with men). This view is
also supported by prior research: O’Brien et al. (2005)
reported that help-seeking was more readily embraced
when it aligned with healthy masculine ideals.
Emphasizing positive outcomes and aligning with
healthy masculine ideals could improve engagement in
men’s mental health treatment.

Using positive male role models or aspirational fig-
ures can help normalize and destigmatize help-seeking.
A review by Sagar-Ouriaghli et al. (2019) highlighted
the use of role models as a behavior change technique
within male-specific interventions for promoting psy-
chological help-seeking. Role models can normalize
problems, model positive outcomes, and offer

evidence that difficulties experienced are often simply
the result of everyday stressors. Celebrities used as
narratives in teaching about mental illness can also
reduce stigma and increase help-seeking (Ferrari,
2016). Parents also play a crucial role, with young peo-
ple’s attitudes toward mental health often influenced
by those of their parents (Jorm & Wright, 2008).
Adolescents are also more likely to seek help for men-
tal health when they have an engaged and supportive
father figure (Reeb & Conger, 2011).

Tailoring Language to Destigmatize and Normalize
Help-Seeking

Language has been demonstrated as central when
relating with and engaging male clients in mental
health treatment, with suggestions that more purpose-
ful self-disclosure and use of colloquial and de-stigma-
tizing language may help improve male engagement
and retention (Brown et al., 2004; Mahalik et al.,
2012). Furthermore, utilizing colloquial and de-
stigmatizing language may improve recognition of
symptoms among boys who have previously failed to
understand the applicability of these types of interven-
tions to their own emotional experiences. Indeed, this
may help to engage young boys who have lower men-
tal health literacy as colloquial terms are more readily
understood.

Trust Building

While apprehension and caution are common in
young men when discussing mental health (O’Brien
et al., 2005; Vogel et al., 2011), building trust is cru-
cial for engaging young men in mental health discus-
sions and can be achieved through strategies such as
emphasizing confidentiality (Kapphahn et al., 1999)
or adopting a collaborative approach (Seidler, Rice,
Oliffe, et al., 2018). Another novel approach to trust
building, particularly in a school-based group ther-
apy format, is the use of non-specific spaces inspired
by the ‘‘men’s sheds’’ model (Milligan et al., 2013),
as investigated by Sagar-Ouriaghli et al. (2023). This
informal drop-in space allows students to receive
mental health information without expectation and
has been identified as being effective in engaging
male students with higher conformity to maladaptive
masculine traits, higher self-stigma, and less positive
attitudes toward help-seeking. This suggests that
informal spaces can improve engagement among
groups that may typically avoid formal information
sessions.

Transparency and Collaboration

Seidler, Rice, Ogrodniczuk, et al., (2018) have high-
lighted the impact of the transparency and collaborative
nature of the approach being taken. In their recent
review of the literature, the authors emphasized that a
key approach to engaging men is by providing a ‘‘colla-
borative, transparent, and strength-based framework
for treatment that promotes empowerment or auton-
omy over dependence.’’ This raises questions regarding
how much collaboration and transparency there is in
mental health interventions for young people.

Effectively adapting these theories to adolescent
boys and young men is particularly important, with
early intervention seen as a key approach to improv-
ing long-term outcomes. Adolescent help-seeking is an
important theme in current research on a school-based
mental health intervention for 16- to 18-year-olds.
Day-long stress workshops, originally developed by
Brown et al. (2000), and adapted for adolescents by
Sclare et al (2015), are being investigated in U.K.
schools between 2021 and 2024. These workshops aim
to be accessible to all groups (including male students)
and destigmatizing, using non-stigmatizing terms like
‘‘stress,’’ rather than diagnostic terms such as ‘‘anxi-
ety’’ and ‘‘depression.’’ They also use a self-referral
system to increase access for ‘‘under-served’’ groups,
as reported in previous research (Brown et al., 2004).
Despite their effectiveness in reaching under-served
groups, such as ethnic minority communities, there is
still a gender disparity in workshop participants, with
81.3% being female. Further identification of success-
ful engagement approaches is needed to reach more
adolescent boys and young men.

Drawing upon the theories from the adult litera-
ture, potential approaches to engage adolescents into
the day-long workshops were first discussed with
young men from a local Patient and Public
Involvement (PPI) group. Four facilitating factors
emerged as the most pertinent: positive masculinity
and role model; tailoring (and destigmatizing) lan-
guage; trust building; transparency and collaboration.
Therefore, this study aimed to explore these four
engagement methods as well as gain views of groups
in two regions about these factors in relation to
attending the day-long workshops.

Therefore, the aims of this research were:

1. To test if the theories and methods about facilita-
tors and barriers developed for older adult men
would be applicable to adolescent young men.
2. To explore the attitudes of adolescent boys
toward engagement in day-long workshops
that were about to be run in London and Bath.

Participants

Two focus group meetings were run: one in London
and the other in Bath. The participants came from
two organizations: male members of a youth panel at
a young person’s organization in London, and mem-
bers of a rugby foundation in Bath. Across these two
organizations, 12 male adolescents aged between 16
and 23 were recruited. Purposive sampling was utilized
to ensure we recruited male participants within this
age range: information sheets were provided to suit-
able participants via their organization staff and inter-
ested individuals were asked to come forward. Ethical
approval was obtained from King’s College London
Research Ethics Committee
(MRA-19/20-20581).
Written, informed consent to participate was obtained
from all participants. It was explained to each partici-
pant that any information that indicated they were a
significant risk to themselves or others would need to
be passed on to the safeguarding staff at
their
organization.

Method

Focus groups were chosen as the method to explore
the attitudes of adolescent boys toward engagement in
the workshop for two reasons. The approach of using
an informal and supportive group environment can
enhance the discussion of personal issues, resulting in
a richer pool of information that may not be captured
using individual
et al., 2008;
McLafferty, 2004). Furthermore, group discussions
not only provide the views of the individual but can
also capture group attitudes and norms, which are
essential to understand when considering how to
engage adolescent boys in a workshop, where infor-
mation and recruitment sessions (as well as the inter-
vention itself) are often held in group situations.

interviews

(Gill

A semi-structured topic guide was used for each
focus group. The four topics were put forward to the
participants for discussion in relation to day-long
stress workshops that were about to be run.

These were:

1. Can male role models, and other positive mas-
culine figures, be utilized to normalize help-
seeking and reduce self-stigma to increase
engagement?

2. Can destigmatizing information be framed to
emphasize positive masculine traits, such as
problem-solving and building skills for life, to
increase engagement?

3. Can trust building initiatives encourage help-

seeking behavior?

American Journal of Men’s Health

4. Can the feeling of transparency and collabora-

tion increase engagement?

Participants were encouraged to discuss how accepta-
ble and effective these different approaches could be
in relation to attending a day-long stress workshop as
well as barriers they perceived. As all focus groups
were conducted online, a tool called ‘‘mentimeter’’
(www.mentimeter.com) was used, allowing partici-
pants to submit answers which then showed up as an
anonymous ‘‘note.’’ Once participants had finished
submitting their answers, group discussion was facili-
tated to encourage richer detail to be shared regarding
each ‘‘note.’’

Procedure

Focus groups were conducted online using Zoom.
They were facilitated by the lead researcher (male), a
male university student from an existing PPI partner-
ship organization, and a local youth worker (male).
The project was led by the lead researcher and the PPI
member. The PPI member provided relatability to the
participants and helped plan the consultations.
During the consultation, the lead researcher and PPI
member took detailed notes on what was discussed, as
well as the names of participants who had spoken.
Note-taking was chosen as the preferred data collec-
tion method, as we wanted to encourage maximum
trust and openness in these discussions. As discussed
by Nordstrom (2015) and Rutakumwa et al (2020),
the recording device can have an influence on the
interview itself, particularly with groups that may be
reluctant to share information due to fear of stigma
and shame. Furthermore, at the time of conducting
this research the only recording method available via
Zoom appeared to be recording the video of the meet-
ing, rather than audio only. Given the potential reluc-
tance of the participants to openly share their views
(due to perceived stigma), it was decided that rigorous
note-taking was a better option. All recorded notes
were stored digitally in password-protected folders on
the university storage network.

Each focus group opened by broadly asking the
individuals to discuss (a) what issues stopped them
taking part in interventions such as day-long stress
workshops (‘‘What do you think might put you off, or
make you feel unsure, about taking part in a work-
shop like this?’’), and (b) what could be done to help
facilitate their participation (‘‘Is there anything you
think could be done to overcome these issues and
make you want to take part?’’). Following this, partici-
pants were encouraged to share their views on the spe-
cific questions identified regarding engagement.

Data Analysis

Content analysis (Mayring, 2000) was used to analyze
the data. Data were initially collated according to each
factor. For each factor, a written record of each point
raised was recorded during the session using the men-
timeter tool. Further notes were recorded by the
researchers present at the consultation during group
discussion of each mentimeter answer. These notes
were then compared and combined, along with the
mentimeter responses and analyzed using content
analysis (Mayring, 2000). Concepts were initially
defined deductively using the research aims and pro-
posed theoretical approaches. The data were then
manually coded into themes. The themes were refined
into categories and subcategories. Each subcategory
was then analyzed for frequency to give an indication
of the prevalence/popularity of these categories and
subcategories.

Findings

The sample consisted of 12 young men who volun-
teered to take part in the focus groups. The average
age of the sample was 18.3 years (SD = 1.65, range =
4.91), with 5 (42%) participants from London and 7
(58%) participants from Bath. The themes, categories,

and subcategories arising from these consultations are
summarized in Table 1.

Facilitators

The most common themes (in order of frequency in
the discussions) were transparency and collaboration
(n = 16) and trust building (n = 14). Positive male
role models were mentioned 13 times, and destigmatiz-
ing language was also mentioned 13 times.

Transparency and Collaboration (n = 16). The respondents
strongly asserted how important transparency and
honesty was to them regarding the reasons for the
workshop taking place, what will be involved, and
what the outcome might be.

Transparency of Participation and Outcomes (n = 12).
Being transparent regarding the aims of the workshop
and the need for boys to attend was considered very
important. Several participants expressed the view
that when teachers or other leaders are trying too hard
to ‘‘convince’’ or ‘‘trick’’ students into attending some-
thing like a workshop, it is picked up very easily by
young people and can look desperate/off-putting. One
participant noted that ‘‘Trying too hard to ‘convince’
or ‘trick’ us into attending is picked up very easily and

6

American Journal of Men’s Health

can look desperate and be off-putting’’ (Participant 1,
Group 1). Another suggested ‘‘Just be upfront with us,
it’s easy to tell when its fake. Speak to us on a level’’
(Participant 3, Group 2).

It was suggested that clear and honest presenta-
tion of the information, that does not make young
men feel patronized, is much more likely to maintain
their attention and gain their trust. ‘‘Be honest about
why you are doing it’’ (Participant 4, Group 2);
‘‘Don’t make it what
(Participant 2,
Group 1).

it’s not’’

Participants also expressed that if they had a clear
and realistic idea of what it would be like to take part,
what they could expect the outcome of taking part to
be, and why they were being offered it, they may be
more likely to take part. One participant suggested it
was important to ‘‘tell us what people have gotten out
of it’’ (Participant 1, Group 2). Another noted ‘‘it
would be good to hear practical examples, e.g., ‘I
joined the workshop, and this is what I got from it’’’
(Participant 5, Group 2).

Finally, it was suggested that often when young
men are offered to take part in extra activities
such as this at school, they are not given all the
information.

Can’t you just be super honest in the information? Can
you just say, ‘‘we want more boys to take part?’’ This
may be more appealing otherwise it can feel patronising
if you are dishonest and seem like they are trying to trick
us. (Participant 4, Group 2)

Collaboration (n = 4). When asked whether they
would value a collaborative approach with the work-
shop leaders and what this would look like, most par-
ticipants were focused on what type of individual they
would feel comfortable interacting with during the
workshop. The most popular suggestions centered
around the relatability of the individuals presenting
the workshop. ‘‘A person I can relate to, who is similar
age and has been in this position. Would be better to
hear from someone who is actually real and not faking
it’’ (Participant 2, Group 1).

Respondents suggested that they would feel most
trusting of a workshop led by an expert with experi-
ence but would also feel more inclined to contribute
and be involved if they were working in collaboration
with an individual closer to their age who they could
relate to and who may understand their experiences
well.

I would like to see a younger relatable person working
alongside a psychology expert, so I could have someone
that understands me but also someone who knows

everything. Could be co-run by a psychologist as well
as somebody else the same age as us. (Participant 6,
Group 2)

Another participant noted ‘‘I agree, that would be
good, someone that understands our situation more
and the scientist—someone who you can chat to on
the same wavelength, but also someone with more wis-
dom’’ (Participant 4, Group 2).

With regard to transparency around the mental
health of the workshop leaders, researchers, or teach-
ers at school, the participants were not enthusiastic
that hearing this information would particularly help
engage them in the workshop. ‘‘Not necessarily the
expert or whatever but could be good to hear about
another student’s first-hand experience’’ (Participant
4, Group 2).

Trust Building (n = 14)

Confidentiality and Non-Victimization (n = 5). One point
raised consistently was confidentiality and the fear of
being victimized by peers due to participation.
Participants felt that they (and other students) would
be concerned about (a) the information they had
shared in any group session being used against them
by peers, and (b) their attendance being obvious to
other students who weren’t attending. Respondents
felt that assurances this would not happen would be
an important factor in building trust and convincing
them to potentially attend. One participant suggested,
‘‘I might go if you could make sure no-one shares what
I say’’ (Participant 5, Group 1). Another noted, ‘‘I’d
also be put off by leaving lessons and having to
explain myself. Might be better if it was mandatory’’
(Participant 3, Group 1).

It was also felt that they would be more encouraged
to attend if they got to choose which students to
attend with. ‘‘Talk to people about who they would
like in their session. Smaller groups with friendly faces
would be better’’ (Participant 4, Group 2). However,
some felt it would be impossible to achieve enough
confidentiality in a group setting, and therefore boys
may struggle to feel trusting of a group workshop. ‘‘I
think I’d just rather it was one-on-one and more pri-
vate’’ (Participant 1, Group 2).

Informality (n = 5). When asked what type of envi-
ronment would encourage them to come and find out
more about the workshops, they emphasized some
level of informality. It was suggested that being able to
get information without pressure to attend could con-
vince them to find out more. Suggestions such as

Lisk et al.

7

‘‘non-classroom spaces,’’ and even ‘‘places outside of
school’’ were made. ‘‘Informal but not too informal
would be good—Some people might not like the class-
room vibe. Or having a day out to tell you about it
and get away from school’’ (Participant 4, Group 1).

When asked what type of space they would con-
sider attending to find out more about the study, par-
ticipants re-emphasized the need for an excuse to
attend the space, such as a relaxing and comfortable
environment, or refreshments. It was also suggested
that if a group of friends were there together, they
may feel less self-conscious about volunteering to take
part because they would feel it was more acceptable to
each other. ‘‘A place with comfy furniture would be
good to relax and talk in’’ (Participant 4, Group 1);
‘‘Games and snacks could be a good reason to go with
friends and be less self-conscious about going alone’’
(Participant 2, Group 2). Another suggested a sort of
‘‘pop-up’’ stand that could be discreetly visited in pass-
ing.
‘‘A relaxed space at school could be good—
somewhere where you have to walk past maybe, pop
up stand with stuff to do’’ (Participant 3, Group 2).

Ongoing Increased Presence (n = 4). Some participants
suggested that providing availability of information
about the workshop in a more continuous manner
would potentially normalize it and give the students a
greater feeling of trust in taking part. ‘‘If it feels more
part of everyday school stuff then people won’t care
so much who attends’’ (Participant 1, Group 2). It was
suggested that this familiarity and the ability to find
out more about the workshop easily, through ongoing
access to information via various sources, would make
them feel more comfortable in engaging with the
workshop.

Have social media maybe or having website or stuff on
the school social media channel or posters in school
(because most
school
online)—it would be better to be able to find stuff out
first without having to ask people. (Participant 2, Group
1)

follow their

persuasive, the most common response was that they
would like to hear from an expert in the topic. ‘‘I’d
rather someone who knows the topic; someone I look
up to who can tell me what will happen’’ (Participant
7, Group 2).

The respondents explained that they would feel
more assured by hearing information from someone
who is considered an expert and suggested that this
would make the topic feel more serious and potentially
more acceptable to be interested in, as well as giving
them confidence that the information provided was
important. ‘‘I’d be more interested if I got to hear from
a scientist or whoever who knows about this stuff
properly’’ (Participant 1, Group 2). ‘‘It would feel
more like we’re going to learn something important if
it was an expert that was advertising it’’ (Participant 4,
Group 1).

Some respondents suggested that hearing from
other individuals that have experienced the workshop
could be helpful, with an emphasis on understanding
the experience of attending and what effect it had on
them. ‘‘Hearing from a person I can relate to, who is
similar age and has been in this position’’ (Participant
1, Group 1).

Strong individuals were suggested by some, who
explained that a figure associated with strength would
reduce the idea that a workshop such as this is for
weak students. Some pointed back to their suggestions
of the workshop psychologist/scientist as this figure,
suggested a sport-based individual
while others
(potentially a sports teacher) as an example of this.
‘‘Sports person—stops ideas of weakness, it’s some-
body that you don’t see as weak’’ (Participant 4,
Group 2). However, this was also caveated with sug-
gestions that any role model needed to be believable
and genuine. ‘‘A teacher could go both ways, depends
on the teacher. PE teacher could appeal to some, for
the ‘lad’ type. But careful not to manufacture them,
they should occur naturally’’ (Participant 3, Group 1).
‘‘Role models occur naturally with time’’ (Participant
4, Group 2).

Interestingly, the participants did not express any
strong opinions on whether the informal spaces, or
any other type of recruitment initiative, were male-
only spaces or mixed-gender.

Focus on Skills Obtained / Skills for Life (n = 8).
Throughout our consultations, participants clearly
communicated that focusing on what skills they could
gain from attending the workshop was likely to be a
significant factor in whether they considered attending
or not. One respondent noted, ‘‘I’d like to know what
can I get out of it?’’ (Participant 2, Group 1). Others
suggested they would like to know, ‘‘If it can give me
skills for the rest of my life’’ (Participant 1, Group 2),

around fear of judgment from peers and the embar-
rassment of feeling like they need help.

When questioned whether they would be more
attracted to skills that emphasized approaches such as
problem-solving and resilience over more obvious
‘‘mental health’’ type approaches, such as discussion
of emotions, the majority of respondents emphasized
their concern was receiving an honest account of
exactly what they could expect to gain from the work-
shop and how it might help them in the future. ‘‘Just
tell us what people have gotten out of it and how it will
help us’’ (Participant 2, Group 1). However, several
participants did suggest that an emphasis on positive
skills they could gain from the workshops as would
likely be more encouraging to their engagement:
‘‘Focusing on aspirations in life etc. may draw in me
and other students that would be less up for going to a
mental health workshop’’ (Participant 7, Group 2).
Conversely, it was also suggested that while focusing
the message on problem-solving may draw in some
students that would be less inclined to attend a mental
health workshop, they also felt it may alienate those
who require this type of support.
‘‘A ‘life skills’
approach may only appeal to studious types and alie-
nate those who the workshop was originally meant
for’’ (Participant 5, Group 1).

Excuse to attend (n = 5). When asked what other
type of information could engage them in the work-
shop and encourage attendance, it was suggested that
if they were given an excuse to attend, it could allow
them to justify their attendance to their peers. One
respondent noted,

Refreshments—gives you something to do and a distrac-
tion making it less awkward. But may attract people who
don’t want or need to be there, but also can attract more
people. Could also be another excuse of why you went.
(Participant 1, Group 1)

Similarly, it was suggested that if there was a clear
message that more boys are needed in the workshops,
this could also be used as an excuse of helping out—
‘‘If you are honest that more boys are needed it might
give boys and excuse to say they are helping’’
(Participant 3, Group 2).

Barriers to Engagement. The most common barriers
were self-stigma/shame and social stigma (n = 12).
When asked what would prevent the participants from
attending a workshop, almost all responses centered

Toxic masculinity is a big thing and some people don’t
want to be seen as weak or lesser than other men because
there is a stigma around being a strong figure. This would
probably be the main reason I would avoid it and my
friends would (Participant 1, Group 2).

Participants reported that they would likely be embar-
rassed about feeling weak, suggesting self-stigma and
shame as a barrier to engagement. One participant
noted, ‘‘Some of us are scared of being judged for
opening up’’ (Participant 4, Group 1). Others sug-
gested,

Discussion

Summary of Findings

The current findings provide some support for existing
findings for adult men as well as some novel results for
adolescent boys and young men. Some surprising find-
ings occurred regarding facilitators to engagement.
The most commonly cited facilitator related to ‘‘trans-
parency and collaboration.’’ The second most com-
mon related to building trust. The joint third related
to promoting positive masculine role models and using
de-stigmatizing language. In terms of barriers, the
results support existing research linking maladaptive
masculinity ideals to increased feelings of self/social-
stigma and shame when seeking help for mental health
problems in adult men and suggest this is likely the
greatest barrier to engagement of adolescent and
young adult men.

Interpretation of Findings

Transparency and Collaboration. This was the most com-
mon theme and was very strongly advocated in the
focus groups. Participants reported how rarely they
feel they are spoken to with transparency about extra-
curricular events but strongly felt honesty was incred-
ibly important to them in all areas of engagement.
This supports the recommendation that engagement
efforts should focus on a fully transparent treatment
process (Seidler et al., 2020). Respondents felt more
positive about working in collaboration with a
younger, more relatable individual as well as an older
‘‘expert’’ who could provide the required knowledge

Lisk et al.

for both engaging into activities, and for the interven-
tion delivery. Participants expressed a preference for
working with younger and more relatable individuals
who could understand them easily, which could be an
effective strategy for engaging adolescent young men,
as they may feel more comfortable and understood by
someone who is closer in age and can relate to their
experiences. Having a younger person as a link
between themselves and the intervention leader was
seen as potentially beneficial. This suggests that a
combination of youth and experience in intervention
delivery could be seen as valuable by adolescent young
men; older practitioners could provide the necessary
expertise and guidance, while younger individuals
could help establish rapport and understanding.
Research in adult men has also demonstrated that
supportive rapport with the practitioner is seen as a
facilitator to engagement (Yousaf et al., 2015).

The theme of transparency and collaboration was
noted to transcend all the other themes identified in
the focus groups. This suggests that transparency and
collaboration could be important factors that need to
be integrated into various aspects of mental health
interventions for young men, such as communication
strategies,
intervention delivery, and practitioner–
patient relationship building.

Trust Building. Building trust has been demonstrated as
an extremely important factor to engaging men in
mental health treatment across ages (Gulliver et al.,
2012; Rickwood et
2005; Seidler, Rice,
al.,
Ogrodniczuk, et al., 2018). Fears around confidential-
ity were a major theme in our focus groups, with many
participants reporting that fears of non-confidentiality
and subsequent victimization from peers would pre-
vent them from engaging with the workshop. Fears
around confidentiality have been identified to present
a major obstacle to achieving high-level trust in young
men (Lynch et al., 2018). A clear link between trust
and confidentiality in young people has been reported
(Gonzalez et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2017; Lindsey, &
Kalafat, 1998; Wilson & Deane, 2001), with trusting
relationships built upon confidentiality.

Another approach suggested increasing trust could
be gained by ensuring the individual knows what to
expect, through prolonged presence of the workshop
at school. They also liked this being informal to poten-
tially reduce fears around victimization. The idea of
normalizing such an intervention through low-
pressure engagement could prove successful as it has
in early studies with university students (Sagar-
Ouriaghli et al., 2020). Furthermore, these findings
around building trust also tie in with the use of

colloquial language; several participants felt it would
be very difficult to achieve enough confidentiality in a
group setting. Reframing interventions with less stig-
matizing and more relatable language, such as refer-
ring to a workshop as a ‘‘skills for life’’ workshop
instead of a ‘‘depression’’ workshop, may reduce fears
of confidentiality breaches and disclosure.

Positive Role Models. An interesting finding from these
focus groups was that the young men did not suggest that
‘‘celebs’’ would be helpful as role models. Instead, they
preferred ‘‘experts’’ whose respected knowledge was diffi-
cult to argue with, representing an action-oriented,
problem-solving approach which has been reported to
engender feelings of strength and empowerment in adult
men (Seidler, Rice, Oliffe, et al., 2018). They indicated
they were less keen on a perceived ‘‘unstructured’’
approach in which emotions and feelings are readily dis-
cussed, which has been reported to put adult men off
seeking help (Addis, & Mahalik, 2003). Another role
model was a strong and respected figure (such as a sports
teacher), who could be effective in encouraging involve-
ment and acceptability, supporting the existing literature
around protecting masculine ideals (Seidler et al., 2020).
Having a sportsperson, who is seen as fitting the mascu-
line ideal, honestly discuss how they would approve of
attendance to this type of workshop could reduce the fear
that seeking help reduces one’s ability to fulfill masculine
ideals. However, as illustrated in the findings, any role
model must be genuine and believable.

Finally, a relatable (younger) role model is also con-
sistent with literature around youth mental health. It
has been reported that young people prefer receiving
help from those who have lived reality of a young per-
son’s experiences (Cniro et al., 2005; de Anstiss &
Ziaian, 2010; Persson et al., 2017). Thus, young men
will respond with greater engagement to information
from an individual they can associate with, who they
feel has been in their position, and may talk confi-
dently about their own help-seeking. It is interesting to
note the wording of participants’ responses around this
type of role model, often referring to ‘‘someone who
has done it’’ or ‘‘been in this position.’’ It could be sug-
gested that young men typically like to see some
inspiration; that these problems can be overcome, and
that seeking and engaging in help actually works. Peers
can have a significant influence on adolescents, and
having respected peers who have sought help for men-
tal health issues and can openly discuss their experi-
for
role models
ences may serve as powerful
encouraging help-seeking behaviors. However,
the
findings also suggest that these young men preferred
role models who represent an action-oriented,

it may be
problem-solving approach. Therefore,
important to utilize role models who (to some extent)
can portray a proactive and solution-focused approach
to mental health, which aligns with traditional mascu-
line ideals of strength, independence, and self-reliance.

Destigmatizing Language. Destigmatizing language can
be used to highlight practical aspects of the interven-
tion. Consistent with the PLACES model (Brown
et al., 2022), which emphasizes the gains from attend-
ing rather than the deficiencies, most participants
wanted to hear about the positive effects the work-
shops could have, rather than their deficiencies that
need to be treated, which would likely lead to greater
engagement. This resonates with the current literature
around how men approach mental health services; the
uncertainty of expectations and outcomes hinders
active participation. This could be viewed as a ‘‘cost–
benefit analysis’’ that takes place, whereby the cons of
factors such as stigma, loss of masculine ideals, and
time are weighed up in relation to the pros, such as
benefits, improving well-being, free food, a day off
school. Overall, if an intervention has fewer cons and
more pros, it would be more likely to have good
engagement. In this case, it is likely that emphasizing
learning skills to help them succeed could improve
engagement due to its ability to ‘‘protect’’ the threat
value of stigma about accessing help (Pedersen &
Paves, 2014; Topkaya, 2014).

Another possibly less expected finding was the rela-
tively popular suggestion that providing an excuse to
attend might help reduce feelings of negative judgment
from peers. This again could be perceived as a ‘‘pro’’ to
workshop attendance and be seen to reduce the threat
value. There is limited specific literature around pro-
viding young men with an ‘‘excuse’’ to seek help; how-
ever, this finding does support results showing fear of
judgment to be a major barrier to help-seeking (Rice
et al., 2016). In fact, in a focus group study, Sagar-
Ouriaghli et al. (2020) reported that when discussing
strategies to ‘‘sensitively engage male students’’ a sub-
theme of ‘‘providing an incentive to attend’’ emerged,
which appeared to act as a mechanism to protect male
vulnerability. Therefore, particularly in an open for-
mat such as group workshops, providing reasons to
attend that may protect the sensitive masculine ideals
of adolescent boys and young men could provide a
novel method to boosting engagement.

Testing the ideas empirically will also allow them to be

the impact of transparency and collaboration in men-
tal health interventions for adolescent young men may
involve conducting experimental studies comparing

Approaches such as prolonged presence of interven-
tions in school settings, use of informal and low-
pressure engagement approaches, and reframing inter-
ventions all warrant further examination. Another
approach that may be successful in gaining further
feedback from this under-served population is the use
of anonymous surveys via social media. Research has
demonstrated that survey collection using Facebook is
effective in reaching those respondents who would
otherwise be resistant
to sharing their views in
approaches like the focus groups conducted in this
study (Ellis et al., 2014). As we complete our current
clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of the stress
workshops in secondary schools, we are using several
of these engagement methods and collecting data on
take-up among boys.

Limitations and Considerations

There were several limitations to this research. First,
all the young men who participated in our focus
groups had volunteered to take part in this study.
Second, as these focus groups were centered around
hypothetical attendance of a group workshop inter-
vention, the participants were given a description of
this group intervention prior
to the discussion.
Therefore, the responses collected were specific to
engagement in this group workshop-based interven-
tion and may be less generalizable to other individual
treatments. Finally, although note-taking was con-
ducted thoroughly by two researchers during each
consultation, audio recordings of the sessions may
have provided a more robust and reliable account of
the information shared by the participants.

tion and of building trust in engaging both adult and

research. On the positive side, the fact that the lead
researcher and the youth worker are men may have
facilitated rapport and trust with the participants.
Shared gender identity could have helped establish a
sense of commonality, allowing for open and candid
discussions about sensitive topics related to masculine
identity and mental health. It may have also encour-
aged young men to feel more comfortable in sharing
their perspectives and experiences, leading to richer
and more nuanced insights. However, the gender iden-
tity of the lead researcher and the youth worker may
have also introduced potential biases to the research.
For instance, their gender identity could have influ-
enced the framing of questions or the interpretation of
responses, potentially shaping the findings in a partic-
ular direction. Moreover, the gender identity of the
researchers may have influenced the willingness of
some participants to disclose sensitive or stigmatized
experiences related to mental health, due to concerns
about conforming to societal expectations of masculi-
nity. Steps were taken to ensure a reflexive approach
during this research process: The lead researcher and
the youth worker engaged in regular discussions and
critical reflection to minimize these biases and ensure
a balanced approach in data
collection and
interpretation.

Conclusion

This study sought to identify facilitators and barriers
to help-seeking in adolescent boys and young men.
When comparing different engagement approaches,
transparency and collaboration is the most common
theme, followed by building trust. Role models and
destigmatizing language were the third most common
themes. Unsurprisingly, perceived threat to masculine
identity (in the form of self and social stigma) is the
main barrier to psychological help-seeking in this pop-
ulation. These results now require testing in experi-
mental studies.
