Post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, 
and depression in college students during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study

Lijuan Quan1, Wei Lu1, Rui Zhen2* and Xiao Zhou3

Abstract
Objectives  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in psychiatric disorders in college students, particularly 
posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. While existing studies assess the prevalence of these 
disorders and their predictors, they overlook potential complications caused by comorbidity between these disorders. 
To fill this gap, this study examined the prevalence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and their comorbidity to inform 
targeted intervention for college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design  Self-report questionnaires were used to assess 6,898 college students about six months after the COVID-19 
outbreak.

Results  The results found that the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety were 15.5%, 32.2%, and 32.1% 
respectively, and the prevalence of comorbid PTSD and depression, comorbid PTSD and anxiety, comorbid 
depression and anxiety, and comorbid PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms were 11.5%, 11.6%, 20.4%, and 9.4% 
respectively. Moreover, left-behind status, lower economic status, previous trauma experiences, exposure to the 
pandemic, and rumination were risk factors of psychological distress, but self-disclosure was a protective factor for 
these disorders.

Conclusion  These results indicate that distinct psychiatric disorders may be comorbid in individuals, and are further 
influenced by pre-, within-, and post-disaster factors. Furthermore, psychological service targeted at college students 
should pay attention to comorbid symptoms rather than only symptoms of single disorders.

Introduction
The  COVID-19  pandemic  posed  an  existential  threat  to 
peoples’ lives and many individuals throughout the world 
have  felt  threatened  and  afraid  [1,  2].  In  light  of  these 
facts,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  considered  a  major 
traumatic  event  [3],  and  thus  may  lead  to  various  nega-
tive  psychological  outcomes  [4–6].  Studies  found  that 
posttraumatic  stress  symptoms,  depression,  and  anxiety 
were relatively common in people during the COVID-19 
pandemic [7–11]. For example, a study of 2,205 Chinese 
college  students  found  that  the  prevalence  of  COVID-
19-related  PTSD  was  34.2%  [12].  Yu  investigated  23,863 
Chinese  college  students  and  found  that  31.9%  of  them 
showed  mild  to  severe  depression  during  this  pandemic 
[13]. In Abubakar et al.’s study, 50.5% of Indonesian col-
lege  students  showed  anxiety  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic [14]. A study conducted among university stu-
dents  from  Germany,  Poland,  Russia,  Slovenia,  Turkey, 
and  Ukraine  revealed  coronavirus-related  PTSD  risk  at 
three  cutoff  scores  (25,  44,  and  50)  was  78.20%,  32.70%, 
and  23.10%  [15].  Further  research  conducted  in  France, 
Ethiopia  and  Malaysia  also  shown  a  significant  negative 
impact  on  the  mental  health  of  college  students  during 
the  COVID-19  pandemic  [16–19]. Thus,  most  research-
ers concluded that the pandemic led to a 27.6% increase 
in cases of major depressive disorders and 25.6% increase 
in cases of anxiety disorders globally [20].

The high prevalence of these disorders raises the ques-
tion of what factors cause these disorders. Freedy et al.’s 
theoretical model provided a potential explanation; post-
traumatic reactions may be affected by pre-, within-, and 
post-disaster  factors  [21].  Here,  gender,  age,  family  eco-
nomic  status,  previous  trauma  experiences  and  other 
demographic  information  were  considered  pre-disaster 
factors,  and  suggested  that  females,  young  people,  and 
people  of  low  economic  status  were  at  higher  risk  of 
developing  disorders  including  PTSD,  depression,  and 
anxiety [6, 22–24]. Within-disaster factors mainly refer to 
the exposure to disasters [21], which always have a dose-
effect relationship to posttraumatic distress [25]. In light 
of  this,  studies  found  that  higher  severity  of  exposure 
to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  related  to  more  PTSD, 
anxiety, and depression [26–29].

A  meta-analysis  found  that  compared  with  the  pre-
and  within-disaster  factors,  post-disaster  factors  play 
a  more  important  role  in  psychiatric  outcomes  [30]. 
Rumination  as  a  type  of  perseverative  cognition  which 
involves  repeated  and  unproductive  dwelling  on  a  par-
ticular  theme  [31],  is  an  important  post-disaster  fac-
tor  in  predicting  negative  outcomes  [32].  It  is  theorized 
that  individuals  with  rumination  over-focus  on  the 
negative  aspects  of  traumatic  events,  limiting  their  abil-
ity  to  notice  trauma-related  cues  in  their  behavior  [33]. 
This,  in  turn,  causes  an  increase  in  negative  feelings  or 

a depressive state [31, 32], and finally leading to psychi-
atric  disorders  such  as  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety. 
Another  post-disaster  factor  is  self-disclosure,  which 
may relieve psychological distress [34, 35]. On one hand, 
by  talking  with  others,  people  may  clarify  their  psycho-
logical  states  and  come  to  term  with  events,  which  in 
turn could lead them to reframe the meaning of trauma 
[36]. On the other hand, disclosure may cause people to 
habituate  gradually  to  stressful  events  and  thus  relieve 
their negative reactions following these events [37]. This 
reframing  and  habituation  may  mitigate  the  severity  of 
PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety.  Given  these  findings,  it 
was  proposed  that  rumination  may  have  exacerbated, 
and self-disclosure may have relieved, individuals’ PTSD, 
depression, and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
While  pre-,  within-,  and  post-disaster  factors  may 
play  a  role  in  psychological  distress  following  trauma,  it 
remains  unclear  which  aspect  plays  the  most  important 
role [32]. Furthermore, existing studies found that during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, people exhibited many types of 
negative  outcomes,  and  these  symptoms  may  have  been 
comorbid  in  these  individuals  [24].  Therefore,  Under-
standing  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on 
people’s  mental  health  and  timely  screening  for  related 
symptoms  such  as  anxiety,  depression,  PTSD  and  their 
comorbidities  can  help  alleviate  negative  outcomes  and 
psychological  treatment  responses.  Moreover,  although 
the  comorbidities  between  PTSD  and  depression,  and 
anxiety  and  depression  are  well  known  [38],  their  triple 
comorbidity among Chinese college students during pan-
demic,  has  not  been  clarified,  limiting  the  comprehen-
sive  understanding  of  posttraumatic  symptoms  during 
this  pandemic  and  thereby  reducing  the  effectiveness  of 
psychological services. To fill these gaps, the aim of this 
study  is  to  assess  the  prevalence  of  PTSD,  depression, 
anxiety,  and  their  comorbidity,  followed  by  examining 
the predictors for them from the pre-, within-, and post-
disaster  perspective  according  to  Freedy  ’s  theoretical 
model [21].

Methods
Participants and procedures

This  study  began  on  June  1,  2020,  after  the  COVID-19 
outbreak. In the current study, we focused on university 
undergraduates. Because many universities are still closed 
in order to reduce the likelihood of teachers and students 
becoming  infected  with  COVID-19,  we  conducted  an 
Internet-based  survey  to  assess  psychological  responses 
among  college  students.  Using  the  WeChat  platform  (a 
free messaging and calling app used commonly in China), 
we sent the internet-based questionnaire to college coun-
selors and asked them to send the questionnaires to their 
students to answer. Using this method, we gathered 6,898 
participants  in  several  provinces  in  China.  This  project 

Quan et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:228 Page 3 of 9

was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Psy-
chology  and  Behavioral  Sciences,  Zhejiang  University. 
Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  each  participant. 
No compensation was provided to students, and graduate 
students were excluded from this study.

Measures

All  instruments  used  in  this  study  were  self-report 
questionnaires.  We  first  collected  participants’  demo-
graphic  information  (e.g.,  gender,  grade,  single  child  or 
not,  family  monthly income,  and previous  trauma expe-
riences).  Next,  we  assessed  students’  levels  of  PTSD, 
depression, anxiety, pandemic exposure, rumination, and 
self-disclosure.

A  Chinese  version  of  the  PTSD  Checklist  for  DSM-5 
(Weathers, 2013) was used to assess college students’ lev-
els  of  PTSD  [39].  This  measure  is  a  20-item  self-report 
scale designed to assess the occurrence and frequency of 
PTSD symptoms in relation to the traumatic experienced 
by  an  individual.  In  the  present  study,  all  respondents 
rated the frequency of COVID-19 related symptoms dur-
ing  the  previous  2  weeks  on  a  5-point  scale  that  ranged 
from 0 (not at all/only once) to 4 (almost every day). The 
scale  has  four  subscales:  intrusions,  negative  cognition 
and  emotion  alteration,  avoidance,  and  hyperarousal.  In 
this sample, the scale demonstrated good internal consis-
tency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96) and good structural valid-
ity (CFI = 0.89). According to Weathers ’s suggestion, the 
cutoff score for PTSD is 34 [40].

Depression  was  assessed  by  the  depression  subscale 
of  the  Symptom  Checklist-90  (SCL-90)  [41].  SCL-90 
was  developed  by  Dr.  Leonard  Derogatis  [42].  The  Chi-
nese  version  of  SCL-90  was  introduced  and  developed 
by  Wang  Zhengyu  in  1984  and  was  confirmed  to  have 
good  reliability  and  validity  by  some  Chinese  scholars 
[41,  43,  44].  Confirmatory  factor  analysis  indicated  a 
good  fit  (CFI = 0.90).  This  subscale  has  13  items,  which 
are  rated  by  a  5-point  scale  ranged  0  (completely  dis-
agree)  to  4  (completely  agree).  In  this  sample,  the  scale 
demonstrated  good  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.90). The cutoff score for depression in this sub-
scale is 13.

Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7)  was  used 
to  assess  the  college  students’  anxiety  levels  [45].  The 
GAD-7 consists of a self-report questionnaire that allows 
for  the  rapid  detection  of  GAD.  College  students  were 
asked if they were bothered by anxiety-related problems 
over  the  past  two  weeks  by  answering  seven  items  on  a 
4-point scale that ranged from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly 
every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 21. The inter-
nal  consistency  of  the  Chinese  version  of  the  GAD-7 
has  been  found  to  be  high.  In  this  sample,  the  scale 
demonstrated  good  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s 

alpha = 0.96) and good structural validity (CFI = 0.96). The 
cutoff score for GAD-7 is 9.

Exposure  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  assessed 
by  Zhen  and  Zhou’s  Pandemic  Experiences  Scale  [46]. 
This  scale  has  ten  items  (e.g.,  I  was  infected  during  the 
COVID-19  outbreak,  I  was  quarantined  during  the 
COVID-19 outbreak), each item was rated based on “No” 
and “Yes”, wherein 0 represented “No” and 1 represented 
“Yes”.

Rumination  was  assessed  by  the  rumination  subscale 
of  the  Cognitive  Emotion  Regulation  Questionnaire 
[47],  and  confirmatory  factor  analysis  shows  a  good  fit 
(CFI = 0.99). This subscale has 4 items. All of these items 
were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, which ranged from 
1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). The cur-
rent study revealed good internal reliability for this sub-
scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88).

Self-disclosure  was  assessed  by  Zhen’s  Chinese  ver-
sion  of  Distress  Disclosure  Index  and  confirmatory 
factor  analysis  shows  a  good  fit  (CFI = 0.90)  [36].  The 
original  scale  was  developed  by  Kahn  and  Hessling  and 
then  revised  by  Zhen  for  Chinese  samples.  The  scale 
comprises  12  items  rated  on  a  5-point  Likert-type  scale 
from  1  to  5  (1 = completely  disagree  and  5 = completely 
agree). For this study, the internal reliability of the ques-
tionnaire was good (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78).

Data analysis procedures

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  version 
20.0.  Chi-square  tests  were  used  to  assess  differences  in 
the  prevalence  of  PTSD,  depression,  anxiety,  and  their 
comorbid  symptoms  among  undergraduates  by  demo-
graphic  characteristics.  Multivariate  logistic  regression 
analyses  were  then  performed  to  examine  the  role  of 
demographic  characteristics,  pandemic  exposure,  rumi-
nation, and self-disclosure in PTSD, depression, anxiety, 
and  their  comorbid  symptoms.  Odds  ratios  (ORs)  and 
95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  used  to  show  the 
predictive utility of these factors.

Results
Sample characteristics

The sample characteristics were in Table 1. Of the 6,898 
college  students,  1,856  (26.9%)  were  male  students  and 
5,042 (73.1%) were female students. 3,152 (45.7%), 1,663 
(24.1%),  1,688  (24.5%),  and  395  (5.7%)  college  students 
were  in  their  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  and  4th  year  of  University, 
respectively.  There  were  2,563  (37.2%)  left-behind  stu-
dents,  and  4,335(61.5%)  were  non-left-behind  students. 
2,535  (36.7%)  students  lived  in  urban  areas,  and  4,363 
(63.3%)  students  lived  in  rural  areas.  2,657  (38.5%)  stu-
dents were only children, and 4,241 (61.5%) students have 
siblings. 2,454 (35.6%) students’ family monthly income is 
lower than 5,000 RMB, and 4,444 (64.4%) students’ family

monthly  income  is  more  than  5,000  RMB.  There  were 
2,539 (36.8%) exposed to at least one traumatic event in 
their previous experiences, and 4,359 (63.2%) responded 
that they had not experienced previous trauma.

Prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety

The  mean  values  of  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety  are 
19.48  (SD = 13.17,  range:0 ~ 60),  9.85  (SD = 10.88,  range: 
0 ~ 52),  and  3.34  (SD = 4.38,  range:  0 ~ 21).  Based  on  the 
cutoff scores of 34, 13, and 5 for PTSD, depression, and 
anxiety  respectively,  there  were  1,067  (15.5%),  2,223 
(32.2%),  and  2,215  (32.1%)  probable  PTSD,  depression, 
and anxiety cases, respectively.

Next,  we  carried  out  correlation  analysis  of  PTSD, 
depression,  and  anxiety.  We  found  that  PTSD  was 
(r = 0.45, 
associated 
(r = 0.50, 
p < 0.001;95%CI:0.42 ~ 0.47) 
p < 0.001;  95%CI:  0.48 ~ 0.52),  and  depression  showed  a 
positive relationship to anxiety (r = 0.56, p < 0.001; 95%CI: 
0.54 ~ 0.59). We then assessed for comorbidity and found 
that  795  (11.5%)  students  had  comorbid  PTSD  and 
depression,  802  (11.6%)  students  had  comorbid  PTSD 
and anxiety, 1,418 (20.4%) had comorbid depression and 
anxiety, and 651 (9.4%) had comorbid PTSD, depression, 
and anxiety.

Table  1  shows  the  results  of  chi-square  tests  for  the 
univariate  associations  between  participants’  demo-
graphic  characteristics  and  PTSD,  depression,  anxiety, 
and their comorbid symptoms. Male students had higher 
instances of PTSD, depression, and comorbid PTSD and 
depression symptoms than that of female students. Grade 
4 students had lower instances of PTSD, depression, anx-
iety, and their comorbid symptoms than that of students 
in  other  grades.  Students  who  were  left-behind,  whose 
family monthly income is lower than 5,000 RMB, and had 
experienced previous traumatic events, had more preva-
lence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid symp-
toms.  Students  from  rural  areas  reported  more  anxiety 
than  the  students  from  urban  areas,  and  students  with 
siblings  had  higher  instances  of  anxiety  and  comorbid 
depression and anxiety than that of the only children.

Predictors of PTSD, depression, and anxiety

Multivariate 
logistic  regression  analyses  were  per-
formed  to  examine  associations  between  demographic 
characteristics,  pandemic  exposure,  rumination,  and 
self-disclosure  and  PTSD,  depression,  anxiety,  and  their 
comorbid  symptoms.  We  found  that  except  for  gender, 
all  variables  were  correlated  with  these  symptoms  (see 
Table 2). The results suggested that the 4th year students 
were less likely to report PTSD, depression, anxiety, and 
their  comorbid  symptoms.  Compared  with  non-left-
behind  students  and  students  who  had  not  experienced 
previou  trauma,  left-behind  students  and  students  who 

Page 5 of 9

had  previous  traumatic  experiences  were  more  likely  to 
have depression, anxiety, and their comorbid symptoms. 
Compared  with  the  students  with  siblings,  the  students 
who  are  only  children  were  less  likely  to  have  anxiety, 
comorbid  depression  and  anxiety,  comorbid  PTSD, 
depression,  and  anxiety.  Family  monthly  income  had  a 
non-significant  relationship  to  anxiety  symptoms,  but 
had  a  significant  association  with  other  symptoms.  The 
students  whose  family  monthly  income  was  lower  than 
5,000  RMB  were  more  likely  to  have  PTSD,  depression, 
comorbid  PTSD  and  depression,  comorbid  PTSD  and 
anxiety,  comorbid  anxiety  and  depression,  comorbid 
PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety.  Furthermore,  we  also 
found  that  rumination  was  positively  correlated  corre-
lated with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and their comorbid 
symptoms,  but  self-disclosure  was  negatively  correlated. 
Pandemic exposure was positively correlated with PTSD, 
anxiety, and their comorbid symptoms.

Discussion
This  is  a  large  cross-sectional  investigation  of  college 
students’  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety  levels  during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the prevalence 
of PTSD, depression, and anxiety was 15.5%, 32.2%, and 
32.1%, respectively, which were lower than the findings of 
previous studies in college students [12, 13, 48]. One pos-
sible explanation is that previous studies carried out their 
investigations  during  the  three  months  after  the  pan-
demic’s outbreak, whereas this study investigated college 
students  about  seven  months  following  the  pandemic’s 
outbreak. Therefore, the students in this study may have 
had more time to adapt to the pandemic than the college 
students in previous studies.

Moreover,  we  found  that  the  prevalence  of  comor-
bid  PTSD  and  depression,  comorbid  PTSD  and  anxiety, 
comorbid  depression  and  anxiety,  and  comorbid  PTSD, 
depression,  and  anxiety  symptoms  were  11.5%,  11.6%, 
20.4%,  and  9.4%,  respectively.  These  findings  indicated 
that  there  is  higher  prevalence  of  comorbidity  between 
distinct psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pan-
demic,  which  is  consistent  with  Karatzias  ’s  finding  that 
many  outcomes  were  comorbid  in  individuals  [24].  Fur-
thermore,  this  finding  suggested  that  individuals  who 
are  experiencing  traumatic  stress  due  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic are likely to also be suffering from anxiety and 
depression [24].

Regarding  for  the  predictors  of  these  symptoms  and 
their  comorbidity,  we  did  not  find  a  significant  gender 
effect,  which  is  consistent  with  Qiu  ’s  study  [48].  Simi-
lar results were also found in the analysis of the effect of 
rural  or  urban  home  environment  on  these  symptoms. 
These results suggested that the psychological distresses 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not vary with gender 
or urban vs. rural areas, informing a large scope effect of

this pandemic. Of course, further rationale for this find-
ing needs to be discussed in future studies. We found that 
age may be correlated with these psychiatric disorders, as 
the college students who were in grade 4 were less likely 
to report PTSD, depression, anxiety, and their comorbid 
symptoms.  These  findings  suggested  that  the  oldest  age 
categories  were  less  likely  to  show  COVID-19  related 
psychological distress, which is consistent with previous 
studies  [24,  49].  This  may  be  attributed  to  the  possibil-
ity that older individuals have a relatively mature cogni-
tive  and  emotional  regulation  capability  and  abundant 
life experiences. Thus, they are more likely to effectively 
handle the stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover,  we  also  found  that  the  students  who  were 
left  behind  and  whose  families  had  lower  monthly 
incomes (e.g., lower than 5,000 RMB) were more likely to 
report more PTSD, anxiety, depression, and their comor-
bid  symptoms.  The  left-behind  status  and  lower  fam-
ily  monthly  incomes  naturally  indicated  fewer  available 
resources, but these resources may also have been further 
depleted by this pandemic. As a meta-analysis has high-
lighted,  individuals  with  a  higher  socio-economic  status 
may use better coping strategies due to greater social and 

economic  resources,  resulting  in  less  impact  from  envi-
ronmental  disasters  and  ultimately  reducing  the  preva-
lence of PTSD [50].

According  to  conservation  of  resources  theory  [51], 
this depletion and scarcity would add to the psychologi-
cal  distress  experienced  by  these  students,  and  getting 
more  resources  may  relieve  some  of  the  negative  effects 
of  trauma  on  these  individuals.  The  only  children  in 
this  study  fared  a  bit  better  psychologically,  most  likely 
because  their  parents  were  able  to  provide  them  with 
more  resources.  We  found  that  students  with  previ-
ous  traumatic  experiences  exhibited  more  symptoms 
of  psychiatric  disorders,  which  is  consistent  with  previ-
ous studies related to trauma stress [52, 53]. This may be 
because  previous  trauma  can  be  re-experienced  at  the 
physical and emotion levels, creating a sensitizing effect 
to new traumas which leads to higher rates of psychologi-
cal distress [32].

In  addition  to  these  pre-disaster  factors,  we  also 
assessed  the  role  of  within-disaster  factors  (e.g.,  pan-
demic  exposure)  and  post-disaster  factors  (e.g.,  rumina-
tion  and  self-disclosure)  in  these  three  disorders  as  well 
as  their  comorbid  symptoms.  The  results  indicated  that

protective  factor  of  these  psychological  distresses,  help-
ing  students  to  learn  to  communicate  their  feelings  to 
others  may  be  an  effective  method  of  relieving  psycho-
logical distress.

Conclusion
This study sheds light on PTSD, depression, anxiety and 
their  comorbidities  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. 
Our  results  showed  that  the  pandemic  has  already  had 
a great psychological impact on the Chinese college stu-
dents.  Crucially,  psychological  distresses  may  be  exac-
erbated  by  comorbidity  in  individuals.  Moreover,  it  has 
been highlighted that left-behind status, lower economic 
status,  previous  trauma  experiences,  exposure  to  the 
pandemic,  and  rumination  were  risk  factors  of  psycho-
logical  distress.  But  self-disclosure  was  a  protective  fac-
tor for these disorders. Thus, mental health professionals 
need to recognize individuals who are at a higher risk of 
comorbid symptoms rather than single symptom of sin-
gle disorders, so as to prevent a possible rise of high post-
traumatic stress for future infectious disease outbreaks.

pandemic  exposure  was  related  to  more  PTSD,  anxiety, 
and  the  comorbid  symptoms  of  both.  The  COVID-19 
pandemic  has  caused  significant  disruptions  to  people’s 
daily  lives,  including  increased  stress  and  anxiety  levels 
due  to  concerns  about  the  virus,  social  isolation,  eco-
nomic  uncertainty,  and  the  loss  of  loved  ones  [54];  Col-
lege students who are exposed to the pandemic, whether 
through  being  infected  with  COVID-19,  losing  a  loved 
one to the virus, or experiencing other pandemic-related 
stressors,  may  be  at  increased  risk  for  developing  PTSD 
and  anxiety  disorders  [55].  The  fear  of  contracting  the 
virus,  uncertainty  about  the  future,  and  social  isolation 
can  also  exacerbate  existing  symptoms  of  anxiety  and 
PTSD  and  their  comorbitity  [56–59].  Additionally,  we 
also found that rumination was positively correlated with 
these  symptoms,  but  self-disclosure  was  negatively  cor-
related. Rumination enhances negative thinking, impairs 
problem solving, and interferes with instrumental behav-
iors,  and  thus  maintains  and  exacerbates  psychological 
distress.  symptomatology  [48,  60].  In  contrast,  self-dis-
closure allows individuals to share their experiences with 
others,  which  strengthens  social  bonds  and  feelings  of 
intimacy  with  others  [61],  increases  the  social  cohesion 
of  communities  [61],  and  activates  communal  coping 
[62], all of which are mitigating factors for posttraumatic 
psychological distress [36].

Several limitations should be noted in this study. First, 
this  study  only  assesses  college  students’  symptoms  of 
psychiatric  disorders  including  PTSD,  depression,  and 
anxiety  about  seven  months  following  the  COVID-19 
outbreak. Thus, caution should be taken with the gener-
alization of results to other samples in other time-points 
following this pandemic. Second, although the effects of 
pre-  and  post-disaster  factors  were  examined,  these  are 
limited and more factors in pre- or post-disaster factors 
should  be  considered.  Third,  the  cross-sectional  design 
limits  our  understanding  of  the  trajectory  of  college 
students’  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety  as  well  as  their 
comorbid symptoms.

Despite  these  limitations,  this  study  found  a  higher 
prevalence  of  comorbid  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety 
in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, sug-
gesting  distinct  psychological  distresses  may  be  exacer-
bated by comorbidity in individuals. Moreover, this study 
found that left-behind status, lower economic status, pre-
vious trauma experiences, exposure to the pandemic, and 
rumination  were  risk  factors  of  psychological  distress. 
Therefore, psychological services should give attention to 
comorbid  symptoms  as  well  as  single  symptoms  follow-
ing  traumatic  events,  and  targeted  intervention  should 
be  directed  toward  left-behind  students,  students  with 
lower economic status, previous trauma experiences, stu-
dents  with  more  exposure  to  pandemic,  and  those  with 
higher rates of rumination. Because self-disclosure was a
