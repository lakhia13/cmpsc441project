Background

A B S T R A C T

Antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication is used extensively to treat people with chronic mental illnesses. Its use, however, is associated with
adverse effects, including movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a problem often seen as repetitive involuntary movements
around the mouth and face. Vitamin E has been proposed as a treatment to prevent or decrease TD.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the clinical effects of vitamin E in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness who
had developed antipsychotic-induced TD.

The secondary objectives were:
1. to examine whether the effect of vitamin E was maintained as duration of follow-up increased;
2. to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective for those with early onset TD (less than five years)

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2015 and April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for
further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection criteria

We included reports if they were controlled trials dealing with people with antipsychotic-induced TD and schizophrenia who remained
on their antipsychotic medication and had been randomly allocated to either vitamin E or to a placebo, no intervention, or any other
intervention.

Data collection and analysis

We  independently  extracted  data  from  these  trials  and  we  estimated  risk  ratios  (RR)  or  mean  differences  (MD),  with  95%  confidence
intervals (CI). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings'
table using GRADE.

Main results

The review now includes 13 poorly reported randomised trials (total 478 people), all participants were adults with chronic psychiatric
disorders,  mostly  schizophrenia,  and  antipsychotic-induced  TD.  There  was  no  clear  difference  between  vitamin  E  and  placebo  for  the
outcome of TD: not improved to a clinically important extent (6 RCTs, N = 264, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01, low-quality evidence). However,
people allocated to placebo may show more deterioration of their symptoms compared with those given vitamin E (5 RCTs, N = 85, RR

0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of any adverse effects (9 RCTs, N
= 205, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.15, very low-quality evidence), extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, N = 104, MD 1.10, 95% CI -1.02 to
3.22, very low-quality evidence), or acceptability of treatment (measured by participants leaving the study early) (medium term, 8 RCTs, N
= 232, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.80, very low-quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or
personalised quality of life, outcomes designated important to patients. There is no trial-based information regarding the effect of vitamin
E for those with early onset of TD.

Authors' conclusions

Small trials of limited quality suggest that vitamin E may protect against deterioration of TD. There is no evidence that vitamin E improves
symptoms of this problematic and disfiguring condition once established. New and better trials are indicated in this under-researched
area, and, of the many adjunctive treatments that have been given for TD, vitamin E would be a good choice for further evaluation.

Vitamin E for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia

Review question

Is vitamin E useful for treating an unpleasant side effect of taking antipsychotics - tardive dyskinesia - in people with schizophrenia or other
similar mental illnesses?

Background

People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These symptoms are
usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs can have debilitating side effects. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary
movement that causes the face, mouth, tongue and jaw to convulse, spasm and grimace. It is caused by long-term or high-dose use of
antipsychotic drugs, is difficult to treat and can be incurable. Vitamin E has been suggested as a treatment, but so far the benefit of using
Vitamin E for this purpose seems small.

Study characteristics

We searched for trials, July 2015 and April 2017, using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials. The review includes 13 poorly
reported randomised trials investigating the effects of vitamin E for people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who also
developed TD as a result of taking antipsychotics. The trials randomised a total of 478 participants who had been ill for a long time.

Key results

Vitamin  E  may  protect  against  tardive  dyskinesia.  However,  there  is  no  clear  evidence  that  vitamin  E  improves  this  problematic  and
disfiguring condition.

Quality of the evidence

Available evidence is weak, limited and poor and we are unable to make any conclusions regarding the use of Vitamin E for antipsychotic-
induced tardive dyskinesia. Well-designed trials involving a large number of participants investigating the effects of vitamin E over long
periods of time are needed to determine whether this vitamin provides an effective treatment option for tardive dyskinesia.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Downgraded one step for risk of bias: most studies did not adequately describe randomisation procedure, allocation concealment or blinding, and some studies were at high
risk of attrition bias.
2 Downgraded one step for imprecision: few events (< 300) were reported.
3 Downgraded two steps for imprecision: small sample size, and effect estimate includes both appreciable benefit and appreciable harm for vitamin E.
4 Downgraded one step for reporting bias: only one study reported on this common, typically monitored adverse effect.
5 Downgraded one step for indirectness: leaving the study early can give an indication, but is not a direct measurement, of treatment acceptability.

Description of the condition

Since  the  1950s  antipsychotic  (neuroleptic)  medication  has
been  used  extensively  to  treat  people  with  chronic  mental
illnesses  such  as  schizophrenia.  These  drugs  can  effectively
control symptoms such as abnormal perceptions (hallucinations),
disordered thinking and fixed false beliefs (delusions). In addition,
maintenance  therapy  with  antipsychotics  is  associated  with  a
reduced  risk  of  relapse  (Schooler  1993).  However,  antipsychotic
medication has been also associated with a wide range of adverse
effects,  including  movement  disorders.  The  appearance  of  these
movement  disorders  can  contribute  to  poor  compliance  with
antipsychotic treatment (Barnes 1993).

Tardive  dyskinesia  (TD)  is  one  such  movement  disorder  and  is
characterised by abnormal, repetitive and involuntary movements.
TD  is  a  chronic  condition  of  insidious  onset,  the  severity  of
which spontaneously fluctuates (APA 1992). Studies on the natural
history  of  TD  have  reported  widely  variable  remission  rates  (1%
to  62%)  depending  on  patient  age,  psychiatric  diagnosis,  course
of the psychiatric disorder, and duration of therapy (Bergen 1989;
Fernandez 2001; Glazer 1990). It occurs in more than 20% of those
using  antipsychotic  medication  continually  for  longer  than  three
months. Every year 4% to 5% of adults and 25% to 30% of elderly
persons who continually use these drugs begin to show signs of TD
(APA  1992;  Correll  2004).  This  disorder  can  result  in  considerable
social and physical disability (Barnes 1993).

The prevalence of TD is often thought to be decreasing based on
the use of atypical antipsychotics in place of typical antipsychotics

Figure 1.   Vitamin E

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

(Cloud 2014). A systematic review found that the incidence of TD
associated with atypical drugs (2% to 4%) was significantly lower
than  that  for  typicals  (5%  to  8%)  (Correll  2008).  Despite  this,  the
widespread use of atypical drugs in clinical settings may still result
in an overall increase in the number of cases of TD (Glazer 2000).

Although the most frequent cause of TD is the use of antipsychotic
medication,  it  is  striking  that  dose  reduction  can  lead  to  a
temporary  exacerbation  in  symptoms.  Conversely,  increasing  the
dose is often associated with a temporary remission. Antipsychotic
drugs  block  certain  chemical  receptor  sites  in  the  brain  -  one
of  these  is  specific  for  dopamine  (Casey  1994).  One  hypothesis
explaining  the  cause  of  antipsychotic-induced  TD  is  that  chronic
blockade  of  dopamine  receptors  in  specific  cells  of  the  brain
(neurones from the nigrostriatum) causes an overgrowth of these
receptors  (Casey  1994).  However,  there  is  some  suggestion  that
the  chronic  use  of  antipsychotics  may  also  cause  an  abnormal
production of highly active atoms and chemical groups (cytotoxic
free radicals), which may damage specific cells in the brain. This, in
turn, could be responsible for the appearance of TD (Cadet 1989).

This  work  updates  one  in  a  series  of  reviews  relevant  to  the
management of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia (Table 1).

Description of the intervention

Vitamin  E  (tocopherol)  is  a  lipid-soluble  antioxidant,  illustrated
in  Figure  1,  that  acts  as  a  free  radical  scavenger  and  has  been
proposed  as  a  treatment  for  antipsychotic-induced  TD  (Rotrosen
1996).

How the intervention might work

Vitamin E may assist in minimising damage caused by cytotoxic free
radical overproduction, and may prevent or decrease the severity of
TD, particularly for people who have had the onset of the problem
in the preceding five years (Feltner 1993; Jeste 1993).

Why it is important to do this review

not  associated  with  any  more  problems  of  TD  than  with  newer
treatments  (Chouinard  2008).  However,  in  a  global  context,  it  is
likely  that  the  less  expensive  and  more  familiar  drugs  -  such  as
chlorpromazine or haloperidol - will continue to be the mainstay of
treatment of people with schizophrenia (WHO Essential List 2010).
Use of drugs such as these is associated with emergence of TD and,
therefore, this condition will remain a problem for years to come.

Several  atypical  antipsychotic  drugs  have  been  produced  in  the
last decades that claim to cause less or no TD (Lieberman 1996).
These claims may or may not be true, and certainly evidence does
point  to  the  fact  that  thoughtful  use  of  older  generation  drugs  is

Cessation or reduction of the dose of antipsychotic medication is
the ideal management for TD. In clinical practice this is not always
possible,  not  least  because  in  many  individuals  such  a  reduction
would lead to relapse. This review focuses on whether the addition

The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  clinical  effects  of
vitamin  E  in  people  with  schizophrenia  or  other  chronic  mental
illness who had developed antipsychotic-induced TD.

The secondary objectives were:
1. to examine whether the effect of vitamin E was maintained as
duration of follow-up increased;
2. to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective
for those with early onset TD (less than five years) (see Subgroup
analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).

Types of studies

All  relevant  randomised  controlled  trials.  Where  a  trial  was
described as 'double-blind' but it was implied that the study was
randomised  and  the  demographic  details  of  each  group  were
similar, we have included it. We have excluded quasi-randomised
studies, such as those allocated by using alternate days of the week.

1. required the use of antipsychotics for more than three months;
2. developed tardive dyskinesia (TD) (diagnosed by any criteria at
baseline and at least one other occasion) during antipsychotic
treatment; and

3. for whom the dose of antipsychotic medication had been stable
for  one  month  or  more  (the  same  applies  for  those  free  of

'Summary of findings' table

We  used  the  GRADE  (Grading  of  Recommendations  Assessment,
Development  and  Evaluation)  approach  to  interpret  findings
(Schünemann 2011) and used GRADEpro to export data from this
review  to  create  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison.
This  table  provides  outcome-specific  information  concerning  the
overall  quality  of  evidence  from  each  included  study  in  the
comparison,  the  magnitude  of  effects  of  interventions  examined
and the sum of available data on all outcomes rated as important to
patient care and decision making. We selected the following main
outcomes  for  inclusion  in  the  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main
comparison. (Review author NM was not biased by being familiar
with the data).

1. Tardive dyskinesia

1.1 Improved to a clinically important extent
1.2 Deteriorated

2. Adverse effect

This  summary  table  was  used  to  guide  our  conclusions  and
recommendations.

*  Outcome  designated  important  to  patients.  We  wished  to  add
perspectives  from  people’s  personal  experience  with  TD  to  the
research  agenda.  A  consultation  with  service  users  was  planned
where  the  previously  published  version  of  this  review  and  a  lay
overview  of  the  review  gave  the  foundation  for  the  discussions.
The  session  was  planned  to  provide  time  to  reflect  on  current
research  on  TD  and  consider  gaps  in  knowledge.  The  report  is
published  in  the  Health  Technology  Assessment  (HTA)  report  for
the UK National Institute of Health Research (Bergman 2017). We
have  added  one  figure  showing  one  service  user's  expression  of
frustration  concerning  this  neglected  area  of  research  (Figure  2).
Informed  by  the  results  of  the  consultation,  for  this  review,  we
updated outcomes for the 'Summary of findings' table.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

This review update was carried out in parallel with updating eight
other TD reviews, see Table 1 for details. The searches covered all
nine  TD  reviews.  For  details  of  previous  electronic  searches  see
Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.

1. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Register

We  searched  Cochrane  Schizophrenia  Group’s  Study-Based
Register  of  Trials  on  July  16,  2015  and  April  26,  2017  using  the
following  string:*Tardive  Dyskinesia*  in  Healthcare  Condition  Field
of  Study.  In  such  a  study-based  register,  searching  the  major
concept retrieves all the synonym keywords and relevant studies
because  all  the  studies  have  already  been  organised  based  on
their interventions and linked to the relevant topics.The Cochrane
Schizophrenia Group’s Register of Trials is compiled by systematic
searches  of  major  resources  (including  AMED,  BIOSIS,  CINAHL,
Embase,  MEDLINE,  PsycINFO,  PubMed,  and  registries  of  clinical
trials)  and  their  monthly  updates,  handsearches,  grey  literature,
and  conference  proceedings  (see  Group’s  Module).  There  is  no
language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for
inclusion of records into the register.

Searching other resources

1. Reference searching

We inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant
studies.

2. Personal contact

We contacted the first author of each included study for information
regarding unpublished trials.

Data collection and analysis

Methods  used  for  the  2017  update  are  presented  below.  For
methods  used  in  previous  versions,  please  see  Appendix  3  and
Appendix 4.

Selection of studies

Review  authors  NM  and  HB  inspected  all  abstracts  of  studies
identified  as  above  and  identified  potentially  relevant  reports.
We  resolved  disagreement  by  discussion,  or  where  there  was
still  doubt,  we  acquired  the  full  article  for  further  inspection.  We
acquired  the  full  articles  of  relevant  reports/abstracts  meeting
initial criteria for reassessment and carefully inspected for a final
decision on inclusion (see Criteria for considering studies for this
review). NM and HB were not blinded to the names of the authors,
institutions or journal of publication. Where difficulties or disputes
arose, we asked author KSW for help and where it was impossible
to decide or if adequate information was not available to make a
decision, we added these studies to those awaiting assessment and
the authors of the papers contacted for clarification.

Data extraction and management

1. Extraction

Review  authors  NM  and  HB  independently  extracted  data  from
all  included  studies.  Again,  we  discussed  any  disagreement  and
documented decisions. We extracted data presented only in graphs
and  figures  whenever  possible,  but  included  only  if  both  review

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

authors  independently  had  the  same  result.  We  attempted  to
contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain
missing  information  or  for  clarification  whenever  necessary.  If
studies  were  multi-centre,  where  possible,  we  extracted  data
relevant to each component centre separately.

2. Management

2.1 Forms

We extracted data online in Covidence.

2.2 Scale-derived data

We included continuous data from rating scales only if:

a) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have
been described in a peer-reviewed journal (Marshall 2000); and
b) the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by
one of the trialists for that particular trial.

Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or
ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).
We  realise  that  this  is  not  often  reported  clearly,  we  noted  in
Description of studies if this was the case or not.

2.3 Endpoint versus change data

There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change
data can remove a component of between-person variability from
the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two
assessments  (baseline  and  endpoint),  which  can  be  difficult  in
unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia.
We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change
data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and
change data in the analysis as we preferred to use mean differences
(MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout
(Higgins 2011).

2.4 Skewed data

Continuous  data  on  clinical  and  social  outcomes  are  often  not
normally  distributed.  To  avoid  the  pitfall  of  applying  parametric
tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to
relevant data before inclusion.

Please note, we entered skewed data from studies of at least 200
participants  in  the  analysis,  because  skewed  data  pose  less  of  a
problem in large studies. We also entered all relevant change data
as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a
possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to
tell whether data are skewed or not.

For endpoint data from studies < 200 participants:

(a) when a scale starts from the ﬁnite number zero, we subtracted
the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the
standard deviation (SD). If this value was lower than 1, it strongly
suggests a skew and we excluded these data. If this ratio was higher
than  one  but  below  2,  there  is  suggestion  of  skew.  We  entered
these data and tested whether its inclusion or exclusion changed
the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio was larger than 2 we
included  these  data,  because  skew  is  less  likely  (Altman  1996;
Higgins 2011).

(b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and
Negative  Syndrome  Scale  (PANSS),  (Kay  1986)),  which  can  have
values  from  30  to  210),  we  modified  the  calculation  described
above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases
skew is present if 2 SD > (S-S min), where S is the mean score and
'S min' is the minimum score.

2.5 Common measure

Where  relevant,  to  facilitate  comparison  between  trials,  we
converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such
as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to
a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).

2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary

Where  possible,  we  converted  continuous  outcome  measures  to
dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points
on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically
improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that
if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief
Psychiatric  Rating  Scale  (BPRS,  Overall  1962)  or  the  Positive  and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986), this can be considered
as  a  clinically  significant  response  (Leucht  2005;  Leucht  2005).  If
data  based  on  these  thresholds  were  not  available,  we  used  the
primary cut-off presented by the original authors.

2.7 Direction of graphs

Where  possible,  we  entered  data  in  such  a  way  that  the  area  to
the  left  of  the  line  of  no  effect  indicated  a  favourable  outcome

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

for  Vitamin  E.  Where  keeping  to  this  made  it  impossible  to
avoid  outcome  titles  with  clumsy  double-negatives  (e.g.  'Not  un-
improved'), we presented data where the left of the line indicates
an unfavourable outcome and noted this in the relevant graphs.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Review  authors  NM  and  HB  independently  assessed  risk  of  bias
within  the  included  studies  by  using  criteria  described  in  the
Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  to
assess trial quality (Higgins 2011a). This set of criteria is based on
evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high
risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation
concealment,  blinding,  incomplete  outcome  data  and  selective
reporting.

If the raters disagreed, we made the final rating by consensus, with
the  involvement  of  another  member  of  the  review  group.  Where
inadequate  details  of  randomisation  and  other  characteristics  of
trials were provided, we contacted authors of the studies contacted
in order to obtain further information. If non-concurrence occurred,
we reported this.

We  noted  the  level  of  risk  of  bias  in  the  text  of  the  review  and
in  Figure  3  and  Figure  4  and  incorporated  these  judgements  in
assessing  limitations  in  study  design  for  critical  and  important
outcomes in the Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Measures of treatment effect

1. Binary data

For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the
risk  ratio  (RR)  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI).  It  has  been
shown that RR is more intuitive (Boissel 1999) than odds ratios as
odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (Deeks 2000).

2. Continuous data

For  continuous  outcomes  we  estimated  mean  difference  (MD)
between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures
(standardised  mean  difference  (SMD)).  However,  if  scales  of  very
considerable  similarity  were  used,  we  presumed  there  was  a
small  difference  in  measurement,  and  calculated  effect  size  and
transformed  the  effect  back  to  the  units  of  one  or  more  of  the
specific instruments.

Unit of analysis issues

1. Cluster trials

Studies  increasingly  employ  'cluster  randomisation'  (such  as
randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of
clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account
for  intra-class  correlation  in  clustered  studies,  leading  to  a  'unit
of  analysis'  error  (Divine  1992)  whereby  P  values  are  spuriously
low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance
overestimated.  This  causes  type  I  errors  (Bland  1997;  Gulliford
1999).

If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters,
and  where  clustering  was  not  accounted  for  in  primary  studies,
we would have presented such data in a table, with a (*) symbol
to  indicate  the  presence  of  a  probable  unit  of  analysis  error.  In
subsequent  versions  of  this  review  we  will  seek  to  contact  first
authors  of  studies  to  obtain  intra-class  correlation  coefficients
(ICCs)  for  their  clustered  data  and  to  adjust  for  this  by  using
accepted  methods  (Gulliford  1999).  Where  clustering  has  been
incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present
these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjust for
the clustering effect.

We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the
binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design
effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per
cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (Donner 2002).
If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (Ukoumunne
1999).

If  cluster  studies  have  been  appropriately  analysed  taking  into
account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis
with  other  studies  would  be  possible  using  the  generic  inverse
variance technique.

2. Cross-over trials

A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs
if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of
the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase.
As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants
can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out
phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if
the condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne 2002). As both effects
are very likely in severe mental illness, we only used data of the first
phase of cross-over studies.

3. Studies with multiple treatment groups

Had a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant,
we  would  have  presented  the  additional  treatment  arms  in
comparisons. If data were binary we simply would have added and
combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we
would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8
  (Combining  groups)  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic
Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011).  We  would  not  use  data
where the additional treatment arms were not relevant.

Dealing with missing data

1. Overall loss of credibility

At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (Xia
2009). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than
50%  of  data  be  unaccounted  for,  we  would  not  reproduce  these
data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of

those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than
50%, we would address this within the 'Summary of Findings' table
by  down-rating  quality.  We  also  planned  to  downgrade  quality
within the 'Summary of Findings' table should loss be 25% to 50%
in total.

2. Binary

In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0% and
50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented
data  on  a  'once-randomised-always-analyse'  basis  (an  intention-
to-treat (ITT) analysis). We assumed all those leaving the study early
had no improvement in TD symptoms. We undertook a sensitivity
analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change by
comparing data only from people who completed the study to that
point to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.

3. Continuous

3.1 Attrition

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

ITT data were not available at all. Moreover, we addressed this issue
in the item "incomplete outcome data" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.

Assessment of heterogeneity

1. Clinical heterogeneity

We  considered  all  included  studies  initially,  without  seeing
comparison  data,  to  judge  clinical  heterogeneity.  We  simply
inspected all studies for clearly outlying people or situations which
we had not predicted would arise and discussed in the text if they
arose.

2. Methodological heterogeneity

We  considered  all  included  studies  initially,  without  seeing
comparison  data,  to  judge  methodological  heterogeneity.  We
simply inspected all studies for clearly outlying methods which we
had  not  predicted  would  arise  and  discussed  in  the  text  if  they
arose.

We  reported  and  used  data  where  attrition  for  a  continuous
outcome was between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who
completed the study to that point were reported.

3. Statistical heterogeneity

3.1 Visual inspection

3.2 Standard deviations

If standard deviations were not reported, we first tried to obtain the
missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were
missing  measures  of  variance  for  continuous  data,  but  an  exact
standard  error  (SE)  and  confidence  intervals  available  for  group
means,  and  either  P  value  or  t  value  available  for  differences  in
mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Interventions (Deeks
2011):  When  only  the  SE  is  reported,  standard  deviations  (SDs)
are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters
7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of
Interventions (Deeks 2011) present detailed formulae for estimating
SDs  from  P  values,  t  or  F  values,  confidence  intervals,  ranges  or
other  statistics.  If  these  formulae  did  not  apply,  we  calculated
the  SDs  according  to  a  validated  imputation  method  which  is
based on the SDs of the other included studies (Furukawa 2006).
Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error,
the alternative would be to exclude a given study’s outcome and
thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of
the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.

3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were
lost to follow-up

Various  methods  are  available  to  account  for  participants  who
left trials early or were lost to follow-up. Some trials just present
the  results  of  study  completers,  others  use  the  method  of  last
observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently, methods
such as multiple imputation or mixed effects models for repeated
measurements  (MMRM)  have  become  more  of  a  standard.  While
the latter methods seem to be somewhat better than LOCF (Leon
2006), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the
studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies
early  between  groups  is  often  the  core  problem  in  randomised
schizophrenia  trials.  We  therefore  did  not  exclude  studies  based
on  the  statistical  approach  used.  However,  we  preferred  to  use
the  more  sophisticated  approaches.  (e.g.  MMRM  or  multiple-
imputation) and only presented completer analyses if some kind of

We  visually  inspected  graphs  to  investigate  the  possibility  of
statistical heterogeneity.

3.2 Employing the I2 statistic

We  investigated  heterogeneity  between  studies  by  considering
the  I2  method  alongside  the  Chi2  P  value.  The  I2  provides  an
estimate  of  the  percentage  of  inconsistency  thought  to  be  due
to  chance  (Higgins  2003).  The  importance  of  the  observed  value
of  I2  depends  on  i.  magnitude  and  direction  of  effects  and  ii.
strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi2  test,
or  a  confidence  interval  for  I2).  An  I2  estimate  greater  than  or
equal  to  around  50%  accompanied  by  a  statistically  significant
Chi2 statistic, can be interpreted as evidence of substantial levels
of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions  Deeks  2011).  We  explored  and  discussed
in the text potential reasons for substantial levels of heterogeneity
(Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings
is  influenced  by  the  nature  and  direction  of  results  (Egger  1997).
These  are  described  in  Section  10  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for
Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Sterne  2011).  We  are  aware
that  funnel  plots  may  be  useful  in  investigating  reporting  biases
but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not
use funnel plots for outcomes where there are 10 or fewer studies,
or where all studies were of similar sizes. In future versions of this
review, if funnel plots are possible, we will seek statistical advice in
their interpretation.

Data synthesis

We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for
use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects
method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are
estimating  different,  yet  related,  intervention  effects.  This  often
seems  to  be  true  to  us  and  the  random-effects  model  takes  into
account differences between studies even if there is no statistically
significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the

random-effects  model.  It  puts  added  weight  onto  small  studies,
which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction
of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.
We chose the fixed0effect model for all analyses.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

1. Subgroup analyses

1.1 Primary outcomes

We anticipated one subgroup analysis to test the hypothesis that
the  use  of  vitamin  E  is  most  effective  for  those  with  early  onset
TD  (less  than  five  years).  We  had  hoped  to  present  data  for  this
subgroup for the primary outcomes.

1.2 Clinical state, stage or problem

We proposed to undertake this review and provide an overview of
the effects of vitamin E for people with schizophrenia in general. In
addition, however, we tried to report data on subgroups of people
in the same clinical state, stage and with similar problems.

2. Investigation of heterogeneity

We  reported  when  inconsistency  was  high.  First,  we  investigated
whether data were entered correctly. Second, if data were correct,
we visually inspected the graph and successively removed outlying
studies  to  see  if  homogeneity  was  restored.  For  this  review,
we  decided  that  should  this  occur  with  data  contributing  to
the  summary  finding  of  no  more  than  around  10%  of  the  total
weighting, we would present data. If not, we would not pool such
data but would discuss issues. We know of no supporting research
for this 10% cut-off but are investigating use of prediction intervals
as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.

When unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity were
obvious,  we  simply  discussed.  We  did  not  undertake  sensitivity
analyses relating to these.

Sensitivity analysis

1. Implication of randomisation

If  trials  were  described  in  some  way  as  to  imply  randomisation,
we  planned  to  undertake  a  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary
outcomes. We would have included these studies in the analyses
and  if  there  was  no  substantive  difference  when  the  implied
randomised studies were added to those with better description of
randomisation, then we would have used relevant data from these
studies.

2. Assumptions for lost binary data

Where assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-
up  (see  Dealing  with  missing  data),  we  compared  the  findings  of
the  primary  outcomes  when  we  used  our  assumption  compared
with completer data only. If there was a substantial difference, we

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

reported and discussed these results but continued to employ our
assumption.

Where assumptions have to be made regarding missing SDs data
(see  Dealing  with  missing  data),  we  compared  the  findings  on
primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with
completer  data  only.  We  undertook  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  test
how prone results were to change when 'completer' data only were
compared  to  the  imputed  data  using  the  above  assumption.  If
there was a substantial difference, we reported and discussed these
results but continued to employ our assumption.

3. Risk of bias

We  analysed  the  effects  of  excluding  trials  that  we  judged  to
be  at  high  risk  of  bias  across  one  or  more  of  the  domains  of
randomisation  (implied  as  randomised  with  no  further  details
available) allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting
for  the  meta-analysis  of  the  primary  outcome.  If  the  exclusion  of
trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of
effect or the precision of the effect estimates, we included data from
these trials in the analysis.

4. Imputed values

Had  we 
included  cluster-randomised  trials,  we  planned  to
undertake  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  the  effects  of  including
data from trials where we used imputed values for ICC in calculating
the design effect in cluster-randomised trials.

If we found substantial differences in the direction or precision of
effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we
did  not  pool  data  from  the  excluded  trials  with  the  other  trials
contributing to the outcome, but presented them separately.

5. Fixed and random effects

We synthesised data using a fixed-effect model, however, we also
synthesised data for the primary outcome using a random-effects
model  to  evaluate  whether  this  altered  the  significance  of  the
results.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

From  the  2015  search  we  identified  five  new  potentially  relevant
studies to add to the review and screened the full texts. Agreement
about which reports may have been randomised was 100%. Two of
these studies could be included. One is a new study for this review
(Zhang 2004). Another study was previously excluded because all
data were unusable (Dorevitch 1997a), however we could include
in  the  update  as  we  found  some  data  from  the  first  phase  of
this  cross-over  trial  to  extract.  One  of  the  references  was  a  new
companion  paper  in  German  to  an  already  included  study  (Adler
1999)  with  no  additional  data,  we  also  added  one  ongoing  study
(ISRCTN14688109  2015)  and  one  excluded  study  (Dorfman-Etrog
1999).

The  2017  search  found  8  records  (5  studies).  Editorial  base  of
Cochrane  Schizophrenia  screened  these  records  and  no  new
studies  were  relevant  to  this  review.  They  could  be  relevant  to
another reviews in this series of TD reviews (see Table 1), and have
been put into awaiting assessment of Soares-Weiser 2003.

two in Israel (Dorevitch 1997a; Dorevitch 1997b), and one each in
China  (Zhang  2004),  Hong  Kong  (Lam  1994),  India  (Akhtar  1993),
Switzerland (Schmidt 1991) and the UK (Sajjad 1998).

6. Interventions

6.1 Vitamin E

The vitamin E dose ranged from 1200 IU/day to 1600 IU/day, with
the exception of Sajjad 1998, in which the dose was 600 IU/day.

6.2 Comparison group

In most of the studies a placebo was used as a comparison, with
no further details given. In one study, the comparison group was
given nothing (Sajjad 1998), and in another trial the placebo was a
sesame oil placebo gelcap (Lohr 1996). None of the included studies
compared vitamin E with another active intervention.

Participants  remained  on  schizophrenia  treatment  antipsychotic
medication during the trials.

Thirteen  studies  are  now  included  in  this  review  (Adler  1993;
Adler  1999;  Akhtar  1993;  Dabiri  1994;  Dorevitch  1997a;  Dorevitch
1997b; Egan 1992; Elkashef 1990; Lam 1994; Lohr 1996; Sajjad 1998;
Schmidt 1991; and Zhang 2004).

7. Outcomes

7.1 General

Included studies

Overall  the  review  now  includes  13  studies  with  478  participants
published between 1990 and 2004.

1. Methods

All  studies  were  stated  to  be  randomised  and  double-blind.
For  further  details  please  see  sections  below  on  allocation  and
blinding.

2. Design

All included studies presented a parallel longitudinal design. Six of
the 11 studies used a cross-over design with two periods (Dorevitch
1997a;  Dorevitch  1997b;  Egan  1992;  Elkashef  1990;  Lam  1994;
Schmidt 1991). We had considered this as likely when embarking on
the review and have used only the data from before the first cross-
over period for the reasons outlined above (Unit of analysis issues).

3. Duration

Most studies were of short duration (less than 13 weeks) but four
had a follow-up period longer than five months (Adler 1993; Adler
1999; Dorevitch 1997b; Sajjad 1998). All the other included studies
were randomised, double-blind, controlled trials of short duration.
Four trials employed washout periods of two weeks.

4. Participants

Participants,  now  totaling  478  people,  were  mostly  men  in  their
50s,  with  diagnoses  of  various  chronic  psychiatric  disorders,
but  mainly  schizophrenia.  All  had  antipsychotic-induced  tardive
dyskinesia  (TD)  diagnosed  using  Schooler  and  Kanes  research
diagnostic  criteria,  except  Schmidt  1991,  who  did  not  report  any
criteria for the diagnosis of TD. The number of participants ranged
from 10 to 158 (median 23).

5. Setting

Most  trials  were  conducted  in  hospital.  The  studies  themselves
were  from  around  the  world,  with  six  conducted  in  the  USA  ,

Some  outcomes  were  presented  in  graphs,  inexact  P  values
of  differences,  or  a  statement  of  significant  or  non-significant
difference.  This  made  it  impossible  to  acquire  raw  data  for
synthesis. Some continuous outcomes could not be extracted due
to  missing  number  of  participants  or  missing  means,  standard
deviations,  or  standard  errors.  All  included  studies  used  the  last
observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  strategy  for  the  intention-to-
treat (ITT) analysis of dichotomous data.

7.2 Scales used to measure the TD symptoms

We  have  shown  details  of  the  scales  that  provided  usable  data
below.  We  have  provided  reasons  for  exclusions  of  data  under
'Outcomes' in the Characteristics of included studies table.

7.2.1 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale

The AIMS (Guy 1976) is a 12-item scale consisting of a standardised
examination followed by questions rating the orofacial, extremity
and trunk movements, as well as three global measurements. Each
of these 10 items can be scored from zero (none) to four (severe).
Two  additional  items  assess  the  dental  status.  The  AIMS  ranges
from zero to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity.

7.2.2 Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale (TDRS)

The  TDRS  (Simpson  1970)  is  a  34-item  scale  consisting  of
measurement of the movements around the orofacial region, neck,
trunk and extremities. Each of these items can be scored from zero
(absent)  to  five  (severe).  This  scale  ranges  from  10  to  102,  with
higher scores indicating greater severity.

7.3 Scales used to measure adverse events related to antipsychotic
medication

7.3.1 Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS)

The SAS (Simpson 1970) is a 10-item scale, with a scoring system of
zero to four for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a
short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates
low levels of parkinsonism.

7.3.2 Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS)

Incomplete outcome data

The  BAS  (Barnes  1989)  is  a  12-item  scale  consisting  of  a
standardised  examination  followed  by  questions  rating  the
orofacial, extremity and trunk movements, as well as three global
measurements.  Each  of  these  10  items  can  be  scored  from  zero
(none)  to  four  (severe).  Two  additional  items  assess  the  dental
status. The BAS ranges from zero to 40, with higher scores indicating
greater severity.

Excluded studies

There  are  eight  excluded  studies.  Peet  1993  and  Spivak  1992
were  not  randomised  and  we  have  therefore  excluded  them.
We  excluded  Dorfman-Etrog  1999  and  Salmasi  2009  because
participants had schizophrenia but not TD. Although participants in
Ricketts 1995 had TD, we excluded this study because participants
did not have schizophrenia but had mental retardation due to brain
damage. After two years of unfruitful attempts to contact authors
for  further  details,  we  have  also  had  to  exclude  a  further  three
randomised studies which reported no usable data (Junker 1992;
Lohr 1988; Shriqui 1992).

Awaiting assessment

We have not, as yet, obtained the report of Kar-Ahmadi 2002; it may
also  be  in  Farsi.  We  hope  to  include  it  in  the  next  update  of  this
review.

Ongoing studies

identified  one  ongoing  study  conducted 

We 
in  Nigeria
(ISRCTN14688109  2015)  investigating  vitamin  E  compared  with
cannabidiol extract in participants with TD. Results of the trial are
expected to be published in early 2018.

Risk of bias in included studies

Please refer to Figure 3 and Figure 4 for graphical overviews of the
risk of bias in the included studies.

Allocation

Only  two  studies  were  rated  at  low  risk  of  selection  bias.
Adler  1999  was  randomised  centrally  and  Sajjad  1998  used
a  computer-generated  sequence  although  did  not  describe
allocation  concealment.  Most  other  studies  were  not  explicit
about  how  allocation  was  achieved  other  than  using  the  word
"randomized".  Adler  1993  allocated  people  into  vitamin  E  and
placebo groups in a ratio of 3:2.

Blinding

Although  all  studies  were  conducted  on  a  double-blind  basis,
none  explicitly  described  how  this  was  undertaken  and  tested
the blindness of raters, clinicians and trial participants. We have,
however,  rated  Adler  1993,  Akhtar  1993,  Dabiri  1994,  Dorevitch
1997b, Lam 1994 and Zhang 2004 as being of higher quality because
they stated that the trial was double-blinded and specifically that
either the raters or the raters and the participants were blinded. All
the other studies gave no further details other than stating that they
were double-blinded. In Sajjad 1998 the blind was broken after one
month.

The trialists excluded three people from Adler 1993 and four from
Lam 1994 because of lack of post-baseline data. Three studies had
a greater than 30% loss to follow-up (Adler 1993; Lohr 1996; Sajjad
1998). In all cases, however, we tried to ensure that every person
randomised was analysed.

Selective reporting

The  majority  of  data  in  this  review  originates  from  published
reports.  Expected  outcomes  (impact  on  TD  symptoms)  were
reported  for  most  of  the  trials.  Six  studies  reported  results  of  all
outcomes  listed  in  the  methods  section  fully  (Adler  1993;  Adler
1999;  Akhtar  1993;  Dabiri  1994;  Sajjad  1998;  Schmidt  1991).  We
rated  risk  of  reporting  bias  for  these  studies  as  unclear  because
we  have  had  no  opportunity  to  see  protocols  of  these  trials  to
compare the outcomes reported in the full publications with what
was  measured  during  the  conduct  of  the  trial.  As  a  result,  we
feel  that  there  may  be  an  element  of  selective  reporting  that  we
could  perpetuate  in  this  review  and  that  this  bias  would  favour
vitamin E. Seven studies did not fully report outcomes that were
measured during the study and were rated at high risk of reporting
bias. Attempts to contact authors of trials for additional data were
unsuccessful.

Other potential sources of bias

All studies had small or very small sample sizes. Six of the studies
used a cross-over design (Dorevitch 1997a; Dorevitch 1997b; Egan
1992; Elkashef 1990; Lam 1994; Schmidt 1991). Five of the studies
had  the  drugs  used  in  the  trials  provided  by  pharmaceutical
companies (Dorevitch 1997a; Dorevitch 1997b; Elkashef 1990; Lohr
1996; Schmidt 1991), and in five studies no details of funding were
given (Akhtar 1993; Dabiri 1994; Egan 1992; Lam 1994; Sajjad 1998).

Effects of interventions

See:  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  VITAMIN
E  compared  with  PLACEBO  for  antipsychotic-induced  tardive
dyskinesia

1. Comparison 1. Vitamin E versus placebo

1.1 TD symptoms

We had chosen 'any improvement in TD symptoms of more than
50%  on  any  TD  scale  -  any  time  period'  as  a  primary  outcome.
Although data we found in trials did not fit this exactly, we feel that
the outcome 'not improved to a clinically important extent' fits best
with what we had hoped to find.

1.1.1 Not improved to a clinically important extent

The overall results for 'clinically relevant improvement' found no
benefit of vitamin E against placebo (low-quality evidence, 6 trials,
264 people, risk ratio (RR) 0.95. 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01, Analysis 1.1).

1.1.2 Not any improvement

For  the  outcome  of  'any  improvement  in  TD  symptoms',  again
added  across  all  time  periods,  we  found  no  difference  between
vitamin E and placebo (low-quality evidence, 7 trials, 319 people,
RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00, Analysis 1.2).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1.1.3 Average endpoint scores

TD  symptoms  were  also  measured  on  the  continuous  Abnormal
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Tardive Dyskinesia Rating
Scale (TDRS) scales. A beneficial effect of vitamin E was found when
measured on the AIMS (medium term, 6 studies, 157 people, mean
difference (MD) -1.77, 95% CI -2.59 to -0.95, Analysis 1.3), but one
study found no difference as measured on the TDRS (short term, 32
people, MD -2.10 95% CI -6.35 to 2.15, Analysis 1.4).

1.1.4 Deterioration of symptoms

People  allocated  to  placebo  showed  more  deterioration  of
their  symptoms  compared  with  those  on  vitamin  E  (low-quality
evidence, 5 trials, 85 people, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76, Analysis
1.5).

1.2 Adverse effects

1.2.1 Extrapyramidal adverse effects

One  study  measured  extrapyramidal  symptoms  (Simpson-Angus
Scale)  and  found  no  difference  between  Vitamin  E  and  placebo
(very  low-quality  evidence,  104  people,  MD  1.10,  95%  CI  -1.02  to
3.22, Analysis 1.6). We had pre-specified the dichotomous outcome
'No clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse effects - any time
period' as a primary outcome. No study reported this as a finding.

1.5 Subgroup analysis

1.5.1 Clinical stage: Recent onset TD

It  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  whether  those  with  recent  onset
TD responded differently to those with more established problems,
since no trial reported data for groups with different durations of
TD that could be extracted for separate analyses.

1.5.2 Duration of follow-up

Any  effects  that  vitamin  E  may  have  did  not  clearly  change  in
relation to duration of follow-up.

1.6 Heterogeneity

Data  were  homogeneous.  We  did  not  detect  clinical,
methodological  or  statistical  heterogeneity  as  described 
in
Assessment of heterogeneity.

1.7 Sensitivity analyses

1.7.1 Implication of randomisation

We  aimed  to  include  trials  in  a  sensitivity  analysis  if  they  were
described  in  some  way  as  to  imply  randomisation.  As  all  studies
were stated to be randomised, we did not undertake this sensitivity
analysis.

1.2.2 Specific adverse effects

1.7.2 Assumptions for lost binary data

The  same  study  measured  akathisia  and  found  no  difference
between Vitamin E and placebo (Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), 104
people, MD 0.30, 95% CI -1.03 to 1.63, Analysis 1.7).

1.2.3 Any adverse effects

There was no difference in the incidence of ‘any adverse effect’ (very
low-quality evidence, 9 trials, 205 people, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to
4.15, Analysis 1.8).

1.2.4 Discontinuation due to adverse events

Five  trials  reported  on  this  outcome  with  only  one  person  in  the
vitamin E arm who discontinued due to adverse events (123 people,
RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.11 to 54.87, Analysis 1.9).

1.3 Mental state

Two  trials  reported  endpoint  data  and  one  trial  reported  change
from  baseline  data.  These  were  combined  as  described  in  Data
extraction and management - '2.3 Endpoint versus change data'. We
found no difference between vitamin E and placebo for a measure
of psychiatric symptoms (British Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), 3
trials, 165 people, MD -0.20, 95% CI -3.21 to 2.82, Analysis 1.10).

1.4 Leaving the study early

Using  vitamin  E  did  not  significantly  increase  the  chances  of  a
person leaving the study early (very low-quality evidence, medium
term overall ˜20% loss to follow-up, 8 trials, 232 people, RR 1.07,
95% CI 0.64 to 1.80, Analysis 1.11).

Where assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-
up (see Dealing with missing data) we compared the findings when
we used our assumption compared with completer data only. Using
completer only data for no improvement in TD symptoms, we found
that more people improved with vitamin E than with placebo due
to a minor shift in the effect estimate and the precision of the effect
estimate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.96; participants = 219; studies =
7, analysis not shown) .Although there was a change in direction of
effect, we continued to employ our assumption in the main results.

1.7.3 Risk of bias

When  excluding  three  trials  that  we  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of
bias across one or more of the domains, there was no substantial
alteration  to  the  direction  of  effect  or  the  precision  of  the  effect
estimates (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; participants = 218; studies
= 6; analysis not shown).

1.7.4 Imputed values

We  would  have  undertaken  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  assess  the
effects of including data from cluster-randomised trials where we
used  imputed  values  for  ICC  in  calculating  the  design  effect.  No
cluster-randomised trials were included.

1.7.5 Fixed and random effects

We also synthesised data for the primary outcome using a random-
effects model This did not alter the significance of the results (RR
0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02; participants = 264; studies = 6).

We  did  not  identify  any  studies  that  reported  on  hospital  and
service  utilisation  outcomes,  economic  outcomes,  quality  of  life,
satisfaction with care, behaviour, or cognitive state.

Summary of main results

1. The search

This  area  of  research  does  not  seem  to  be  active.  this  2017
update has identified additional data, but most trials predate the
year  2000,  only  one  was  carried  out  after  that  time  (published
2004).  This  could  be  because  of  reasons  such  as  less  concern
with  tardive  dyskinesia  (TD),  or  less  emergence  of  the  problem
in  research-active  communities  because  of  more  thoughtful  use
of  antipsychotic  drugs  or  loss  of  faith  in  vitamin  E  as  a  potential
treatment.

2. Few data

Only  a  little  under  500  people  have  been  involved  in  placebo-
controlled  trials  of  vitamin  E  for  TD.  It  is  possible  that  real,
and  important,  effects  have  not  been  highlighted  because  of
the  necessarily  wide  confidence  intervals  of  the  findings.  Many
outcomes were not measured at all (see Overall completeness and
applicability of evidence), including one of our pre-stated outcome
measures. We may have been overambitious in hoping for some of
these outcomes in TD trials but simple reporting of satisfaction with
care or quality of life still does not seem too demanding and does
remain of interest.

3. Comparison 1. Vitamin E versus placebo

3.1 TD symptoms

Results  of  this  review  do  not  suggest  that  vitamin  E  improves
symptoms  of  TD.  However,  the  quality  of  the  evidence  for
improvement  of  TD  symptoms  is  low;  further  research  is  very
likely  to  have  an  important  impact  on  our  confidence  in  the
estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. The recent
addition of Zhang 2004 did not impact on the binary outcomes for
improvement in TD symptoms, but changed the continuous scale
results  in  favour  of  vitamin  E.  The  finding  that  people  allocated
to  placebo  may  show  more  deterioration  of  their  symptoms
compared  with  those  allocated  to  vitamin  E  is  interesting  (low-
quality evidence, 5 trials, 85 people, RR 0.23 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76) and
generates some hope that the experimental treatment may have a
preventative role. This is worthy of further investigation.

3.2 Adverse effects

There  is  no  evidence  that  vitamin  E  has  any  significant  adverse
effects.

3.3 Mental state

Three  trials  reported  on  mental  state.  All  used  the  BPRS  scale,
but this involved only asking 165 people regarding this important
outcome. There was no suggestion that vitamin E had any different
effect on mental state than placebo.

3.4 Leaving the study early

It is always unclear what leaving the study early means. It could be
to do with the participant not accepting treatment for a series of
reasons, or of participants finding the trial intolerable. It also could
be a function of a trial design in which willing participants are still
asked to leave because of some degree of protocol violation. In any
event, between 20% and 30% of people left the study early, but this
was not different for those allocated to either group.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

3.5 Social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or
personalised quality of life

This  group  of  outcomes  was  selected  as  being  of  importance
to  patients  for  the  2017  review  update  following  a  service  user
consultation.  No  studies  were  identified  that  reported  on  any  of
these outcomes.

4. Comparison 2. Vitamin E versus any other intervention

We found no included study that compared the efficacy of vitamin
E compared to another active intervention. There is currently one
ongoing  study  (ISRCTN14688109  2015)  comparing  vitamin  E  to
cannabidiol that is due to be published in 2018.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

1. Completeness

No outcomes in this review involved large numbers of people. Some
are general measures and more subtle findings are not recorded.
For  example,  we  identified  few  data  on  the  outcome  of  ‘any
adverse effect’ but none on the binary outcomes ‘use of any anti-
parkinsonism  drugs’  or  ‘no  clinically  significant  extrapyramidal
adverse  effects  -  any  time  period’-  the  latter  being  one  of  our
pre-stated primary outcomes. There were no data on the patient-
designated important outcomes quality of life and satisfaction with
care for either recipients of care or caregivers, nor were there data
on hospital and service utilisation outcomes, economic outcomes,
behaviour or cognitive response.

2. Applicability

All  trials  were  hospital-based  but  were  nevertheless  on  people
who would be recognisable in everyday care. The intervention in
question  -  vitamin  E  -  is  readily  accessible  and  most  outcomes
understandable in terms of clinical practice. Should vitamin E have
had important effects the findings may well have been applicable.

Quality of the evidence

The  largest  trial  in  this  area  randomised  only  158  people  (Adler
1999). A trial of this size is unable to detect subtle, yet important
differences  due  to  vitamin  E  with  any  confidence.  In  order  to
detect  a  20%  difference  between  groups,  probably  about  150
people  are  need  in  each  arm  of  the  study  (alpha  0.05,  beta  0.8).
Overall, the quality of reporting of these trials was poor (see Figure
3).  Allocation  concealment  was  not  described,  generation  of  the
sequence  was  not  explicit,  studies  were  not  clearly  blinded,  we
are  unsure  if  data  are  incomplete  or  selectively  reported  or  if
other  biases  were  operating.  The  small  trial  size,  along  with  the
poor reporting of trials, would be associated with an exaggeration
of  effect  of  the  experimental  treatment  (Jűni  2001)  if  an  effect
had  been  detected.  This  is  only  evident  for  the  outcome  of
‘deterioration’ where there is indeed an effect favouring the vitamin
E group. This interesting finding may be real – but could equally be
a function of biases or of chance.

Potential biases in the review process

1. Missing studies

Every  effort  is  made  to  identify  relevant  trials.  However,  these
studies are all small and it is likely that we have failed to identify
other studies of limited power. It is likely that such studies would
also not be in favour of the vitamin E group. If they had been so,

it is more likely that they would have been published in accessible
literature. We do not, however, think it likely that we have failed to
identify large relevant studies.

Implications for research

1. General

2. Introducing bias

This review group has now updated this review several times. We
have  tried  to  be  balanced  in  our  appraisal  of  the  evidence  but
could have inadvertently introduced bias. We welcome comments
or criticisms. New methods and innovations now make it possible
to report data where, in the past, we could not report data at all
or had to report data in a different way. We think the Summary of
findings for the main comparison to be a valuable innovation – but
problematic to those not ‘blind’ to the outcome data. It is possible
to ‘cherry pick’ significant findings for presentation in this table. We
have  tried  to  decrease  the  chance  of  doing  this  by  asking  a  new
review author (NM) to select outcomes relevant for this table before
becoming familiar with the data.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

The  only  other  relevant  quantitative  review  we  know  of  is  the
previous  version  of  this  Cochrane  review  (Soares-Weiser  2011).
This  update  expands  and  improves  this  review  but  does  not
substantially change the findings or the conclusions.

Implications for practice

1. For people with TD

There  is  some  suggestion  that  vitamin  E  supplementation  may
alter  the  course  of  tardive  dyskinesia  (TD)  for  those  with
schizophrenia  and  these  findings  are  in  keeping  with  other
types  of  studies  (Hawkins  1989).  These  data  are  very  weak
and  should  be  interpreted  with  considerable  caution.  If  offered
vitamin  E  supplementation  to  offset  symptoms  of  TD  a  person
taking  antipsychotic  medication  would  be  justified  in  asking  for
evidence, and encouraging generation of new better evidence by
volunteering to help with a well-designed evaluative study.

2. For clinicians

TD is such a disfiguring condition. This review generates a theory
that  vitamin  E  could  be  a  preventative  measure  for  TD.  The  data
in  this  review  do  not  justify  routine  use  of  vitamin  E.  It  would
be  reasonable,  however,  to  ask  people  with  schizophrenia  to
complicate  their  treatment  plan  if  the  use  of  vitamin  E  was  to
generate data better than seen in this review. There is a real place
for clinician-driven research, with prescription within the context
of a randomised trial and routine data collection on outcomes of
relevance to people with TD and their clinicians.

The  power  of  this  review  would  have  been  greatly  enhanced  by
better reporting of data. For example, only one study made explicit
how randomisation was undertaken (Adler 1999). We realise that
much of the work for these trials predates CONSORT, which was first
published in 1996 (Begg 1996), and that it is only too easy to judge
studies of the past by standards of today. Future studies, however,
should report to a much higher standard.

2. Specific

Well-designed  randomised  controlled  trials,  involving  a  large
number of participants over protracted periods of time, are needed
if  we  are  to  see  if  vitamin  E  could  have  a  role  in  prevention  and
treatment of TD. Such studies are of importance to people with the
problem (Figure 2) and have long been ignored.

2.1 Use of cross-over design

Trialists  find  it  difficult  to  identify  people  with  both  TD  and
schizophrenia to participate in trials (Schmidt 1991). Randomised
cross-over  design  is  used  in  the  hope  of  improving  the  power
of  the  study  to  find  outcomes  of  interest.  This  design  initially
asks  participants  to  be  randomised  to  one  of  the  experimental
interventions, and then, at a pre-specified time, to be crossed over
to the treatment that they did not at first receive. Conditions with
a more stable time course than TD are better suited for cross-over
studies (Fleiss 1984). Further difficulties are the carry-over effect. At
the very least, vitamin E is dissolved in fat and probably high levels
from the doses given in trials may well persist in the body for long
periods after discontinuation. Unless cross-over studies include a
mid-study washout period (where the person is free of treatment
before starting the next arm of the study), any effect of vitamin E
may  continue  into  the  second  half  placebo  arm  of  the  trial  –  the
'carry-over  effect'.  Also,  carry-over  may  involve  the  re-growth  or
retreat of neuroreceptors. This slow re-balancing, if started, could
continue  long  after  all  traces  of  intervention  drugs  are  gone,  so
physiological half life of the experimental treatment may not be the
only variable to consider when thinking though the issues of carry-
over. Tardive dyskinesia is also an unstable condition and people
with  TD  may  not  remain  compliant  with  medication.  All  these
factors make the arguments for not using cross-over methodology
strong,  despite  the  initial  attraction  (Armitage  1991;  Fleiss  1984;
Pocock 1983).

2.2 Sample size calculation

Only  one  of  the  studies  included  in  this  review  mentioned  how
they calculated the sample size (Adler 1999). However, the results
suggest  that  larger  sample  size  should  be  used  to  provide  more
precise estimates of effect.

3. Policy makers or managers

2.3 Length of study

This is one of the largest in the series of Cochrane reviews on TD. No
evidence is convincing that addition of another drug helps with the
symptoms of TD. There are, however, many unanswered questions
in this area. This unattractive adverse effect is caused, to a greater
or lesser extent, by antipsychotic drugs. Clinicians and researchers
should feel responsible enough to continue to try to help it. Those
compiling guidance could encourage supportive activity and more
research into this neglected area.

Three  studies  included  in  this  review  (Adler  1993;  Adler  1999;
Sajjad 1998) used the intervention for more than five months. TD,
however, is a chronic condition of insidious onset, the severity of
which fluctuates spontaneously (APA 1992). Even if vitamin E has a
swift effect, which is unlikely, it is the long-term outcomes that must
be considered of most clinical value.

2.4 Outcomes

A C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S

Scale-derived data do have their place. Trials most commonly used
the  Abnormal  Involuntary  Movement  Scale  (AIMS)  scale.  This  is
a  very  widely  used  tool  to  measure  the  severity  of  symptoms  of
those  who  have  TD.  The  use  of  this  scale  to  measure  change  as
a result of treatment is, however, problematic (Bergen 1984). It is
therefore important that a scale is validated for measuring changes
secondary  to  treatment  in  those  with  TD.  In  addition,  many  of
the  outcomes  we  initially  desired  when  we  started  this  review
have  not  been  investigated.  Finally,  a  service  user  consultation
also  informed  the  addition  of  outcomes  of  special  importance
to  patients.  We  have  reconsidered  all  these  outcomes  in  case
they  were  too  ambitious  and  tried  to  tailor  them  to  a  real-world
pragmatic trial design (see Table 2).

As an active group was compared to treatment as usual, the study could not be
double-blinded.

Methods

Randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study

Participants

Target number of participants: 28 per group

Interventions

Outcomes

Adults 18 years and older that currently meets the ICD-10 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, veri-
fied with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-PLUS) questionnaire and that cur-
rently meets the clinical diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia confirmed with the Abnormal Involuntary
Movement Scale (AIMS). Patients should currently be receiving treatment for a psychotic disorder
and should be on either the atypical or conventional antipsychotics

1. Group 1 has high cannabidiol extract Nabidiolex® (CBD) (300 mg) administered twice a day for six
weeks as an adjunctive treatment alongside their usual antipsychotic medication. CBD will be ad-
ministered orally in capsules.

2. Group 2 has vitamin E (400 IU) administered daily for six weeks as an adjunctive treatment along-
side their usual antipsychotic medication

Improvement in symptoms of tardive dyskinesia measured using the Abnormal Involuntary Move-
ment Scale (AIMS). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks (post-
treatment) and at 12 weeks follow-up.

Side effects of CBD will be periodically assessed with the Glasgow check list and reported at each
assessment

1.7 SCISEARCH - Science Citation Index (1997)
Each of the included studies was sought as a citation on the SCISEARCH database. Reports of articles that had cited these studies were
inspected in order to identify further trials.

2. Reference searching
The references of all identified studies were also inspected for more studies.

3. Personal contact
The first author of each included study was contacted for information regarding unpublished trials.

Data collection and analysis
[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary.]

1. Selection of reports and studies
KSW and JM inspected every report identified by the search, independently, to see if the study was likely to be relevant. Where resolving
disagreement by discussion was not possible, the full article was obtained. The reviewers then inspected these articles, independently,
to  assess  their  relevance  to  this  review.  Again,  where  disagreements  could  not  be  resolved  by  discussion  the  article  was  added  to
those awaiting assessment and the authors of the study were contacted for clarification for ambiguous or missing descriptions of the
methodology.

2. Assessment of methodological quality
The reviewers also evaluated the quality of all included trials independently of one another. A rating was given for each trial based on
the three quality categories as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (Clarke 2000). Only trials that stated to be randomised
(category A or B of the Handbook) were included in this review.

3. Data extraction
Data were independently extracted by KSW and JM. When disputes arose resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not
possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and this outcome of the trial was added to
the list of those awaiting assessment. Outcomes are assessed using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical
(for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such a 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous
measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a persons behaviour). Currently RevMan does not support
categorical data so they were presented only in the text of the review.

4. Data synthesis
4.1 Intention to treat analysis
Data were excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up. For all events, in studies with
less than 50% attrition rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death.

4.2 Binary data
For  binary  outcomes  a  standard  estimation  of  the  relative  risk  (RR)  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  calculated.  The
weighted  number  needed  to  treat  or  harm  statistic  (NNT,  NNH),  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI),  was  also  calculated  (http://
www.mango3d.cwc.net/vsx.htm). If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.

4.3 Continuous data
4.3.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying
parametric  tests  to  non-parametric  data,  the  following  standards  are  applied  to  all  data  before  inclusion:  (i)  standard  deviations  and
means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (ii) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard
deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre
of the distribution, (Altman 1996); (iii) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the
calculation described above in (ii) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness is present if 2SD>(S-
Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and
these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such
as change on a scale), there is no way of telling whether data is non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use scale

end point data, which typically cannot have negative values. If end point data were not available, the reviewers used change data, but they
were not subject to a meta-analysis, and were reported in the 'Additional data' tables, as were non-normally distributed end point data.

4.3.2  Summary  statistic:  for  continuous  outcomes  a  weighted  mean  difference  (WMD)  between  groups  was  estimated.  Again,  if
heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.

4.3.3  Valid  scales:  continuous  data  from  rating  scales  were  included  only  if  the  measuring  instrument  had  been  described  in  a  peer-
reviewed journal (Marshall 2000) and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the
therapist).

4.3.4 Endpoint versus change data
Where possible endpoint data were presented and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then only the
former were reported in this review.

5. Test for heterogeneity
A  Mantel-Haenszel  chi-square  test  was  used,  as  well  as  visual  inspection  of  graphs,  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  heterogeneity.  A
significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found the data were re-analysed using
a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did, the studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to
the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated.

6. Addressing publication bias
Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood
of overt publication bias (Egger 1997).

7. Sensitivity analyses
The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis.

8. General
Where possible, reviewers entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for
vitamin E.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

All relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised
and the demographic details of each group were similar, we have included it. We have excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those
allocated by using alternate days of the week.

Types of participants

People with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness, diagnosed by any criteria, irrespective of gender, age or nationality who:

• required the use of antipsychotics for more than three months;
• developed TD (diagnosed by any criteria at baseline and at least one other occasion) during antipsychotic treatment; and
• for  whom  the  dose  of  antipsychotic  medication  had  been  stable  for  one  month  or  more  (the  same  applies  for  those  free  of

antipsychotics).

Types of interventions

1. Vitamin E: any dose or means of administration

2. Placebo or no intervention

Types of outcome measures

We have defined clinical efficacy as an improvement in the symptoms of TD of more than 50%, on any scale. We grouped outcomes into
short term (less than six weeks), medium term (between six weeks and six months) and long term (more than six months).

Primary outcomes

1. Tardive dyskinesia

Any improvement in the symptoms of individuals of more than 50% on any tardive dyskinesia scale - any time period.

Searching other resources

1. Reference searching

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant studies.

2. Personal contact

We contacted the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Reviewer  NM  inspected  all  abstracts  of  studies  identified  as  above  and  identified  potentially  relevant  reports.  In  addition,  to  ensure
reliability, KSW inspected a random sample of these abstracts, comprising 10% of the total. Where disagreement occurred, we resolved
this by discussion, or where there was still doubt, acquired the full article for further inspection. We acquired the full articles of relevant
reports for reassessment and carefully inspected for a final decision on inclusion (see Criteria for considering studies for this review). Once
we obtained the full articles, in turn NM and KSW inspected all full reports and independently decided whether they met inclusion criteria.
NM and KSW were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Where difficulties or disputes arose, we
asked author JM for help and if it was impossible to decide, added these studies to those awaiting assessment and contacted the authors
of the papers for clarification.

Data extraction and management

1. Extraction

Reviewer NM extracted data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, KSW independently extracted data from a random
sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. Again, we discussed any disagreement, documented decisions and, if necessary,
contacted authors of studies for clarification. With remaining problems JM helped clarify issues and we documented those final decisions.
We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included these only if two reviewers independently had the
same result. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification
whenever necessary. Where possible, we extracted data relevant to each component centre of multi-centre studies separately.

2. Management

2.1 Forms

We extracted data onto standard, simple forms.

2.2 Scale-derived data

We included continuous data from rating scales only if:

a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (Marshall 2000); and
b. the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.

2.3 Endpoint versus change data

There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the
analysis. On the other hand calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint); normally both sets of data would be
available to trialists but if change scores are presented, the SD of the change is often not provided. We decided to primarily use endpoint
data and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean
differences rather than standardised mean differences throughout (Deeks 2011, Chapter 9.4.5.2).

2.4 Skewed data

Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-
parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in
the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by
two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (Altman 1996); c)
if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified
to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD>(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the
minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data
are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed
or not. We have entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed
data of means pose less of a problem if the sample size is large; if this condition was met, then we entered skewed data into syntheses.

2.5 Conversion to common measures

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital
(mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).

2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary outcome measures

Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on
rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if
there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall 1962) or the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (Leucht 2005a; Leucht 2005b). If
data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.

2.7 Direction of graphs

We entered data for unfavourable outcomes in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome
for vitamin E. Where the outcomes were favourable, the area to the right of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for vitamin
E. In either instance we labelled the direction of effect for the interventions at the bottom of the relevant graph.

2.8 Summary of findings table

We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings (Schünemann 2008) and used GRADE Profiler (GRADE 2004) to import data from Review
Manager 5 (RevMan 2008) to create the 'Summary of findings for the main comparison' for the following primary and secondary outcomes
considered to be critically important or important to the management of tardive dyskinesia with vitamin E (Reviewer NM was not biased
by being familiar with the data).

1. Tardive dyskinesia
1.1 Improved to an important extent (ideally this be stated as in the primary outcome for the review)
1.2 Deteriorated

2. Adverse effect
2.1 Any adverse event (ideally this should be the stated primary outcome: Adverse effects: no clinically significant extrapyramidal adverse
effects)
2.2 Specific adverse event

3. Quality of life
3.1 No significant change in quality of life/satisfaction

This table provides information concerning the overall quality of the evidence from the trial, the magnitude of effect of the interventions
examined, and the sum of available data on all primary outcomes and the selected secondary outcomes. This summary was used to guide
our conclusions and recommendations.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

KSW and NM independently assessed included studies for the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' assessment tool
(Deeks 2011) on the following six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding or masking, incomplete outcome data,
selective outcome reporting and other biases.

For each of these six domains, we assigned a judgement regarding the risk of bias as 'yes' for free of the risk of bias, 'no' for at high risk of
bias, or 'unclear' when judgements could not be reliably made due to lack of information in the report or after contacting the trial authors.
We used the criteria summarised in Table 8.5.c of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2011) to make
judgements, and recorded these assessments in the standard 'risk of bias' tables in RevMan 5 (RevMan 2008). For the domains of blinding
or masking and for incomplete outcome reporting, we assessed the risk of bias separately for subjectively reported and for objectively
ascertained outcomes. We presented these evaluations in the 'risk of bias' summary figure (Figure 3), and risk of bias summary graph
(Figure 4) and discussed them further in the results section under Risk of bias in included studies. We incorporated these judgements in
assessing limitations in study design for critical and important outcomes in the Summary of findings for the main comparison

Measures of treatment effect

1. Binary data

For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown
that RR is more intuitive (Boissel 1999) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (Deeks 2000). For
statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/
H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) taking account of the event rate in the control group.
This, however, was superseded by the Summary of findings for the main comparison and the estimates therein.

2. Continuous data

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

For  continuous  outcomes  we  estimated  mean  difference  (MD)  between  groups.  We  preferred  not  to  calculate  effect  size  measures
(standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, had different scales with similar characteristics been used to measure the same outcome
for comparisons, we would have calculated the SMD and transformed the weighted, pooled effect back to the units of one (or more) of
the specific and familiar instruments.

Unit of analysis issues

1. Cluster trials

Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered
data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error
(Divine 1992) whereby P values are spuriously low, CIs unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors
(Bland 1997; Gulliford 1999).

If any of the included trials had randomised participants by clusters, and if the results were adjusted for clustering, we combined the
adjusted measures of effects of these cluster-randomised trials with parallel group RCTs using the generic inverse variance technique. If
results had not adjusted for clustering, we would have attempted to adjust the results by multiplying the standard errors of the estimates
by the square root of the design effect (where the design effect is calculated as DEff = 1 + (M - 1) ICC, where M is the average cluster size
and ICC is the intra-cluster coefficient) (Donner 2002). If the ICC was not reported nor available from the authors, we assumed it to be 0.1
(Ukoumunne 1999).

2. Cross-over trials

A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological)
of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants
can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the
condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne 2002). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we only use data of the first phase
of cross-over studies.

3. Studies with multiple treatment groups

Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we have presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If
data were binary we have simply added these added and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined
data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the Cochrane Handbook. Where the additional treatment arms were
not relevant, we have not reproduced these data.

Dealing with missing data

1. Overall loss of credibility

At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (Xia 2007). For any particular outcome should more than 20% of data be
unaccounted for, we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 20% of those in one arm of a study
were lost, but the total loss was less than 20%, we marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.

2. Binary outcomes

We extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis in which all randomised participants were analysed in the groups to which they
were originally assigned. If there was a discrepancy in the number randomised and the numbers analysed in each treatment group, we
calculated the percentage loss to follow-up in each group and reported this information. We sought supplementary information from trial
authors such as intention to treat and per-protocol analyses data-set, or a participant flow diagram in a sufficiently detailed manner as
to facilitate data retrieval. If unexplained dropouts exceeded 20% in either group, we would have assigned the same proportion of those
with the worst outcome to those lost to follow-up for dichotomous outcomes (except for mortality and adverse effects) as for those who
completed the study, and assessed the impact of this in sensitivity analyses with the results of completers.

3. Continuous outcomes

For continuous outcomes, if provided and where possible, we calculated missing standard deviations from other available data such as
standard errors, P, T or F values as detailed in Deeks 2011. If this was not possible, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation
method that is based on the SDs of the other included studies (Furukawa 2006). We examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity
analysis excluding imputed values.

3.1 Last observation carried forward

We preferred not to make any assumptions about loss to follow-up for continuous data and analysed results for those who completed
the trial, since the use of methods such as the last observation carried forward (LOCF) introduce uncertainty about the reliability of the

result (Leucht 2007). If LOCF data had been used in included trials, we reproduced these data and indicated that they were the result of
LOCF assumptions.

Assessment of heterogeneity

1. Clinical heterogeneity

We considered all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge clinical heterogeneity. We simply inspected all studies
for clearly outlying situations or people which we had not predicted would arise. When such situations or participant groups arose, we
have discussed these fully.

2. Methodological heterogeneity

We considered all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge methodological heterogeneity. We simply inspected
all  studies  for  clearly  outlying  methods  which  we  had  not  predicted  would  arise.  When  such  methodological  outliers  arose  we  have
discussed these fully.

3. Statistical heterogeneity

3.1 Visual inspection

We  visually  inspected  the  forest  plots  to  evaluate  the  possibility  of  heterogeneity  of  intervention  effects  across  trials  as  evidenced  by
outlying trials with non-overlapping confidence intervals. We also noted differences in the direction of effect estimates across trials.

3.2 Employing the I2 statistic

We attempted to assess if significant heterogeneity was present using the Chi2 test for homogeneity at a 10% level of significance. We
used the I2 statistic to quantify inconsistency (the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than
sampling error) (Higgins 2003). The importance of the observed value of I2 depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength
of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi2 test, or a CI for I2). In general we interpreted I2 estimates greater than or equal to
50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi2 statistic, as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity, although we acknowledge
that  values  of  I2  ranging  from  30%  to  60%  may  also  indicate  substantial  heterogeneity  (Section  9.5.2  -  Deeks  2011).  When  we  found
substantial levels of heterogeneity in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (Subgroup analysis and investigation
of heterogeneity). If severe heterogeneity was present (I2 > = 75%) and could not be explained by differences across the trials in terms of
clinical or methodological features or by subgroup analyses (see below), we would not have combined the trials in a meta-analysis, but
presented the results in a forest plot.

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (Egger 1997). These
are described in Section 10 of the Cochrane Handbook (Deeks 2011). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting
biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer
studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their
interpretation.

Data synthesis

We  understand  that  there  is  no  closed  argument  for  preference  for  use  of  fixed-effect  or  random-effects  models.  The  random-effects
method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems
to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant
heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the
most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. Therefore, we chose the
fixed-effect model for all analyses. If the I2 statistic indicated substantial heterogeneity (values 50% or greater), we presented the results
using fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis and assessed the impact of both models on the direction and precision of the effect
estimate.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

1. Subgroup analyses

We anticipated one sub-group analysis to test the hypothesis that the use of vitamin E is most effective for those with early onset TD (less
than five years). We had hoped to present data for this subgroup for the primary outcomes.

2. Investigation of heterogeneity

In the presence of substantial heterogeneity, we had hoped to undertake one pre-stated subgroup analysis for the primary outcomes in
this review to test the hypothesis that vitamin E is more effective for those with an onset of TD within five years.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We  also  explored  the  possibility  that  unanticipated  clinical  or  methodological  differences  contributed  to  significant  statistical
heterogeneity by removing trials with these characteristics from the meta-analysis, to assess if this reduced the I2 estimate to below 50%.
If substantial heterogeneity was reduced, we reported this but presented the forest plot with the data from these trials as well. We stated
hypothesis regarding these in the discussion and hoped to evaluate them more fully in future versions of the review.

When  unanticipated  clinical  or  methodological  heterogeneity  were  obvious,  we  simply  stated  hypotheses  regarding  these  for  future
reviews or versions of this review. We did not anticipate undertaking analyses relating to these.

Sensitivity analysis

1. Implication of randomisation

We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they were described in some way as to imply randomisation. For the primary outcomes
we included these studies and if there was no substantive difference when the implied randomised studies were added to those with better
description of randomisation, then we employed all data from these studies.

2. Assumptions for lost binary data

Where  assumptions  had  to  be  made  regarding  people  lost  to  follow-up  (see  Dealing  with  missing  data),  we  compared  the  findings  of
the primary outcomes when we used our assumption compared with completer data only. If there was a substantial difference, we have
reported results and discussed them, but continue to employ our assumption.

Where assumptions had to be made regarding missing SDs data (see Dealing with missing data), we compared the findings on primary
outcomes when we used our assumption compared with complete data only. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone results
were to change when 'complete' data only were compared to the imputed data using the above assumption. If there was a substantial
difference, we have reported results and discussed them, but continue to employ our assumption.

The protocol as published with this review has evolved over time. The revisions of protocol are in line with the development of RevMan and
in keeping with Cochrane guidance. We think the revisions have greatly improved and enhanced this review. We do not think, however,
that it has materially affected our conduct of the review or interpretation of the results.

There was a substantial update to the protocol in the 2010 review update that the 2017 update also follows, but with two additions.

1. The comparison: 'Vitamin E: any dose or means of administration compared to any other intervention'
2. The outcomes 'Acceptability of treatment' and 'Social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life' were

added to the 'Summary of findings' table. These outcomes were designated to be of importance to patients.

The previous methods are reproduced in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4.
