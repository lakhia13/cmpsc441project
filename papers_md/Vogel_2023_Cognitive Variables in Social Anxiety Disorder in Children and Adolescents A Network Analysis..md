Abstract
Clark and Wells’ prominent model of social anxiety disorder (SAD) assumes that cognitive variables such as negative expecta-
tions or dysfunctional cognitions play a central role in the symptomatology of SAD. In contrast to adults, it is less clear how 
well the cognitive model can be applied to children and adolescents. A network analysis with seven nodes was conducted to 
explore the importance of cognitive variables and their interaction with symptoms of SAD based on N = 205 children and ado-
lescents (8–18 years, M = 11.54 years). Cognitive variables had a high but differential impact within the positively connected 
network of SAD. Dysfunctional cognitions were most strongly connected within the network. Dysfunctional cognitions, as 
predicted by Clark and Wells’ model, seem to act as a hub affecting several symptoms. The association between negative 
expectations and avoidance indicates that negative expectations may particularly contribute to the maintenance of SAD.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an intense 
and persistent fear of social situations and fear of being 
evaluated by others [1]. SAD is one of the most common 
mental disorders of childhood and adolescence, with life-
time prevalence rates ranging from 7 to 9% [2, 3]. Affected 
individuals show impairments in academic and social func-
tioning [4, 5] and are at a higher risk of developing comor-
bidities [3, 5]. Notably, the most common onset of SAD 
is during childhood and adolescence, with a high risk of 
being persistent into adulthood [6–8]. This emphasizes the 
importance of identifying factors that contribute to the main-
tenance of the disorder and thus represent promising targets

for treatment early on. The DSM-5 [1, 9] conceptualizes 
SAD as a set of symptoms including fear of social interac-
tions, fear of being observed, fear of performing in front of 
others, and avoidance of social situations. Attending social 
situations is associated with the occurrence and endurance 
of the fears mentioned here. In addition, fear of acting in an 
embarrassing way or fear of showing bodily anxiety symp-
toms (physiological symptoms) such as blushing, trembling 
or sweating, are part of SAD [1]. In a factor analysis of 
social fear in children and adolescents, it was shown that 
fears are best represented by three domains, namely interac-
tion, observation, and performance [10]. Research further 
indicates that all three domains of fear are associated with 
avoidance behavior and thus are likely to contribute to the 
maintenance of SAD [10, 11].

Cognitions in Children and Adolescents with SAD

Beyond the symptoms described in the DSM-5 [1], mod-
els of SAD suggest additional variables immanent to SAD 
[12–15]. One of the most prominent models of SAD, is the 
model by Clark and Wells (1995) [12]. The model assumes 
that  individuals  with  SAD  hold  negative  expectations 
regarding social situations. When attending a social situ-
ation, these negative expectations are activated and lead to 
dysfunctional cognitions during the social situation, which,

in turn, activate physiological and other cognitive symptoms. 
As an example, imagine a child who has the negative expec-
tation (pre-event processing) “When I talk in front of others 
they will laugh at me,” which then leads to the dysfunctional 
cognition “If I have to talk in front of others, I must always 
speak eloquently (so that nobody laughs at me).” During 
the situation, physiological symptoms (e.g., trembling of 
voice) and an increased perception of these bodily reactions 
(self-focused attention) occurs, which, in turn, amplifies the 
fear that others might laugh. In the aftermath of the social 
situation, the child ruminates about the past social situation 
negatively (post-event processing), which in turn strengthens 
the negative expectations regarding similar situations. Con-
sequently, social situations are more likely to be avoided due 
to such negative expectations [16]. In this chain of cognitive 
and physiological processes, dysfunctional cognitions play 
a central role as they affect several other SAD symptoms. 
Thus, dysfunctional cognitions are viewed as a hub.

Research on Cognitions in Children and Adolescents 
with SAD

While negative expectations and dysfunctional cognitions 
are already well researched in adults with SAD and are 
central targets of interventions [14], few and inconsistent 
findings exist in this regard in children and adolescents 
[17]. However, the sparse research consistently indicates 
that socially anxious children are more likely to expect that 
future social situations will have a negative outcome com-
pared to non-anxious children [17–20]. Research regarding 
the occurrence of dysfunctional cognitions during a social 
situation in socially anxious children and adolescents is, sur-
prisingly, much more inconsistent than findings regarding 
negative expectations [17]: some studies indicate a more 
frequent occurrence of dysfunctional cognitions in social 
situations in children with SAD compared to healthy chil-
dren [18, 19], whereas others do not show any differences 
[20–22]. Although it is still unclear whether dysfunctional 
cognitions are more frequent in children with SAD, stud-
ies that have looked at dysfunctional cognitions concerning 
social anxiety using path-analytical or regression-analytical 
approaches in larger community samples show first evidence 
for the relevance of dysfunctional cognitions in children and 
adolescents. These studies demonstrate that dysfunctional 
cognitions are the second strongest predictor of social anxi-
ety in children and adolescents [23, 24] and, within a set of 
other variables of cognitive SAD-models, are able to explain 
almost half of the variance in social anxiety [23, 24]. In line 
with the cognitive model of Clark and Wells (1995) [12], 
dysfunctional cognitions are also predicted by pre-event 
processing, confirming that negative expectations may lead 
to dysfunctional cognitions during a social situation. Clark 
and Wells’ (1995) [12] cognitive model further mentions 

factors such as post-event processing and self-focused atten-
tion which are also identified as relevant for children and 
adolescents in this context [25–28]. Thus, cognitive vari-
ables might be contributing factors to the maintenance of 
SAD in children. Despite the assumed importance of cogni-
tive variables included in models of SAD, there are almost 
no studies examining the association of cognitive variables 
and circumscribed symptoms of SAD such as social fears, 
physiological symptoms, and avoidance behaviors in chil-
dren and adolescents. One study found a correlation between 
expectations of one's performance and avoidance behavior 
in a community sample of adolescents [29]. Another study 
indicates that experimental induction of negative expecta-
tions in children results in higher state anxiety levels during 
the task [30], suggesting a direct relation between expecta-
tions and social fears. Although the influence of cognitive 
variables on symptoms of SAD in children and adolescents 
is largely unexplored, the aforementioned cognitive vari-
ables of Clark and Wells’ (1995) [12] model are already 
considered in children and adolescents in the context of cog-
nitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [14, 31], for which research 
indicates a promising effectiveness in the treatment of SAD 
[32]. However, we only know little about the effect of target-
ing individual cognitive variables in CBT [14]. Since first 
evidence shows that targeting specific cognitive variables 
may actually increase efficacy [33, 34], it seems important to 
gain a better understanding of the contribution of individual 
cognitive variables to SAD in children. To date, no study has 
examined the cognitive variables described here in in rela-
tion to physiological symptoms, social fears, and avoidance 
behavior. Therefore, (i) it is largely unclear whether cogni-
tive variables are connected to all these above-mentioned 
symptoms of SAD in children and adolescents. Additionally, 
(ii) the overall importance of specific cognitive variables in 
children and adolescents in the context of SAD and (iii) the 
influence of these cognitive variables on individual symp-
toms of SAD are largely unknown. Knowledge of the differ-
ential influence of cognitive variables on symptoms of SAD, 
for example whether dysfunctional cognitions actually act as 
a central hub with global influence on many SAD symptoms, 
could contribute to the question whether Clark and Wells' 
(1995) cognitive model can also be applied to children and 
adolescents. Furthermore, a nuanced understanding about 
cognitive variables in children and adolescents with SAD 
could help develop meaningful treatment strategies.

Network Theory

In order to gain a fine-grained understanding of the impor-
tance  of  cognitive  variables  and  their  interaction  with 
symptoms of SAD, the network theory of psychopathology 
[35–37] represents a promising approach. In the network 
theory of psychopathology, a network consists of nodes 

1 3Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:625–638 

627

(which represent symptoms or variables) and edges (con-
nections  between  symptoms  or  variables).  The  network 
theory of psychopathology represents a new way of con-
ceptualizing psychopathology, in which it is assumed that 
there is no single underlying pathomechanism or common 
cause of the disorder and all its symptoms [35]. Instead, 
a mental disorder emerges through influences and interac-
tions between symptoms and related variables that activate 
each other. Through mutual activation and reinforcement of 
symptoms and variables among themselves, a stable state 
of mental disorder arises, so that the network itself consti-
tutes the mental illness (for a theoretical overview see [35, 
37]). Based on network theory, various aspects can be inves-
tigated to provide information about the properties of the 
analyzed network and thus about the mental disorder itself 
(for a methodological overview see [38, 39]). Related to the 
present study, network analysis can contribute as follows: 
First (i), to gain insight whether above-mentioned cognitive 
variables and individual symptoms of SAD are connected 
at all and form a network, one can examine the network 
structure or architecture, that is, whether the connections 
between the symptoms of SAD and cognitive variables tend 
to be strong or weak, positive or negative [40]. Strong and 
positive connections between the symptoms of SAD and 
cognitive variables would indicate that the included nodes 
are meaningful symptoms and cognitive variables of SAD, 
and that these, in combination, represent a stable state and 
thus a persisting mental disorder [35]. Second (ii), regarding 
the question of how strong the influence of individual cog-
nitive variables or symptoms of SAD is within the network 
overall, one can consider centrality measures and predict-
ability [38, 41]. As the most prominent centrality measure, 
strength would indicate how strongly a cognitive variable or 
symptom is directly linked to all other symptoms and cog-
nitive variables in the network. It indicates this symptom’s 
or variable’s relative importance within the network [38]. 
This would provide a quantification of the importance of the 
cognitive variables and symptoms of SAD relative to each 
other, so that the analysis is not solely dependent on visual 
exploration [38]. Predictability, which is equivalent to the 
explained variance of the nodes among themselves, repre-
sents an absolute measure of the symptoms’ and variables’ 
importance [41, 42]. High predictability of a certain symp-
tom (e.g. avoidance behavior) would indicate that avoidance 
behavior can be well predicted by all other symptoms and 
cognitive variables that are connected to it. According to 
network theory, nodes with a high predictability are consid-
ered to make an important contribution to the maintenance 
of the disorder [41]. Deactivation of this cognitive variable 
or symptom (e.g. by treatment) is considered to be associ-
ated with destabilizing the network itself and thus probably 
results in the remission of the disorder [42]. Third (iii), the 
question of whether and to what extent cognitive variables or 

symptoms of SAD are specifically associated with individual 
other symptoms or cognitive variables can be addressed by 
analyzing individual edges between nodes. Individual edges 
within a network represent significant connections between 
two symptoms and indicate that symptoms influence each 
other [35]. By comparing individual edges, it is possible to 
examine whether a link between two nodes (e.g., between 
a cognitive variable and a symptom) is particularly strong 
or weak. If there is a strong positive association between 
two nodes, network theory assumes that the activation of 
one node likely activates all associated nodes [36]. Vice 
versa, the deactivation of one symptom is accompanied by 
the deactivation of the other symptom [36]. For example, if 
the two nodes dysfunctional cognition and avoiding social 
situation were strongly linked, dysfunctional cognition is 
likely to activate, avoiding social situations or vice versa. 
The advantages of network analysis include modelling rel-
evant connections between components (e.g., symptoms and 
cognitive variables) without having to use sum scores. It also 
allows the influence of individual components within the 
network to be quantified using objective estimators.

Network Analyses on SAD

To date, few studies have explored a network only based on 
SAD symptoms for adult individuals [43–48]. In this con-
text, Heeren et al. [45] found a quantitatively stronger link 
between symptoms in a sample of adult patients with SAD 
compared to a healthy control group, but the networks did 
not differ regarding their structure and centrality. This is 
consistent with the idea that a certain level of SAD-related 
symptoms is normative, that each individual can be located 
on a continuum of severity of social anxiety, avoidance 
behaviors,  or  physiological  symptoms,  and  that  SAD  is 
present if a certain level of symptomatology is exceeded 
[49]. Thus, in complement to the categorical classifica-
tion of the DSM-5, a dimensional approach with healthy 
or mixed samples can also be applied to analyze symptoms 
of SAD [49–51]. So far, publications on networks for SAD 
in adults have neglected cognitive factors or physiological 
symptoms but focused on anxiety-inducing social situations 
[43, 45–48] and attentional mechanisms [44].

To date, only one study has reported an SAD network rely-
ing on data from adolescents of a community sample [52]. In 
contrast to networks in adult samples, the authors included 
different components such as cognitive variables, nervousness 
in social situations, and avoidance behavior and analyzed the 
network’s stability over time. As cognitive variables, they 
included different negative thoughts (e.g., “I worry about 
doing something stupid or embarrassing”), which formed a 
symptom cluster (also called community) and were only indi-
rectly related to avoidance behavior through emotional varia-
bles (e.g., “I get nervous if I have to perform in public”), which 

1 3628

are conceptually close to social fears. At all three measurement 
points, a negative thought was the component with the highest 
strength within the network. However, the authors neither dif-
ferentiated between negative expectations and dysfunctional 
cognitions nor considered physiological symptoms or different 
types of social fears. Overall, the results of this study empha-
size the importance of cognitive variables for SAD in children 
and adolescents but do not allow to draw detailed conclusions 
for the interaction of different cognitive variables as well as 
their interaction with other important symptoms of SAD.

Current Study

In the present study, we conduct an SAD network analysis for 
children and adolescents. We consider a broad spectrum of 
SAD symptoms, including main fear domains of social anxiety 
(observational, interactional, performance), avoidance behav-
ior, and physiological symptoms, as well as SAD-immanent 
cognitive variables. Since a network analysis requires a bal-
ance between the number of included nodes and sample size 
[39], and our analysis is based on an existing set of data, 
we focus on the three key fear domains [10], the cognitive 
variables negative expectation and dysfunctional cognition, 
physiological symptoms, and avoidance behavior. With our 
network analysis, we want to examine if cognitive variables 
that are empirically proven to be part of SAD models in adults 
and were only non-specifically analyzed within a symptom 
network in adolescents are a hallmark of social anxiety in 
children and adolescents as well. Because cognitive variables 
are not commonly considered symptoms of SAD, but in the 
present study symptoms and cognitive variables will be con-
sidered together in a network, both are jointly referred to as 
components in line with Miers et al. (2020). Due to the lack 
of network studies regarding SAD in children and adolescents 
and the exploratory nature of the network approach, we do 
not form specific hypotheses. Instead, we assume (1) that all 
included components (symptoms and cognitive variables) are 
positively connected and thus build a symptom network of 
SAD, as has previously been the case for adults and adoles-
cents [45, 52] and (2) that, based on the initial evidence of the 
importance of cognitive variables [17, 23, 24, 29, 52], they dis-
play a central role within the network, and that dysfunctional 
cognitions, in particular, are highly interconnected due to their 
assumed role as a hub. Since Miers et al. (2020) [52] did not 
differentiate between different cognitive variables, we (3) aim 
to explore if different cognitive variables (negative expectation 
and dysfunctional cognitions) are differentially connected to 
symptoms of SAD.

Methods

Sample

We conducted our network analysis based on two data sets 
from previous studies. For more information on the recruit-
ment  and  procedure  of  the  first  study,  one  may  refer  to 
descriptions in other publications [53][53]. Both children 
and parents who participated in these studies were informed 
about the content of the respective study in advance and gave 
their informed consent prior to their participation. In the 
first study, n = 109 children and adolescents aged 8–18 years 
completed the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Chil-
dren (SPAI-C) [55] as part of a nationwide online study in 
Germany focusing on anxiety-related cognitions [54] and 
anxiety levels in social situations [53]. In this study, families 
were recruited through therapeutic outpatient clinics, inter-
net forums, and newspaper articles. Parents had the oppor-
tunity to participate in a draw for 10 vouchers worth €25 
each. The study took place from January 2016 to December 
2017. In the second study, which has not been published so 
far, children aged 8 to 12 years completed the SPAI-C as 
part of a study on social stress and gaze behavior in social 
situations. The sample was recruited through newspaper arti-
cles, schools, therapeutic outpatient clinics, and mailings in 
the state of Hesse (Germany). Families were compensated 
with 20€ for their participation. The study took place from 
January 2018 to March 2020. In this study, n = 95 children 
completed the SPAI-C. Thus, the current analysis includes a 
complete data set of a mixed study sample of N = 204 (67% 
female) children and adolescents between 8 and 18 years 
of age (M = 11.54,  SD = 3.15) with a mean sum score of 
all  SPAI-C  items  of  M = 20.00  (clinical  cut-off = 20), 
SD = 13.53. In addition to trait social anxiety assessed with 
the SPAI-C, symptomatology of selective mutism (SM) was 
assessed in the two aforementioned studies using the Frank-
furt Scale for Selective Mutism (FSSM) [56]. Therefore, trait 
social anxiety and SM symptomatology will be reported for 
the present sample, although the present network analysis is 
based only on the items of the SPAI-C. An overview of our 
sample composition is provided in Table 1. The subdivision 
into children with high social anxiety (HSA) and low social 
anxiety (LSA) provides a better overview of individuals with 
clinically relevant scores on the social anxiety continuum. 
Subsequent network analyses were conducted for the com-
plete sample. It can be seen that our sample includes a sub-
stantial number of individuals with clinically relevant lev-
els of social anxiety (Table 1). Additionally, some of these 
individuals also exceed the cut-off for SM, which is in line 
with studies indicating that most children with SM also have 
a comorbid SAD [57], report elevated trait social anxiety 
[58] and do not differ on fear-related cognitions compared to

children with SAD [54]. Thus, we were able to cover a broad

Item Selection

Measures

Social anxiety symptoms (performance fear, interactional 
fear, observational fear, physiological symptoms, and avoid-
ance behavior) and cognitive variables (negative expecta-
tions and dysfunctional cognitions) were assessed using the 
German version of the SPAI-C [55]. The SPAI-C consists of 
26 items rated on a 3 point Likert scale ((0) “never or rarely,” 
(1) “sometimes,” (2) “most of the time or always”) concern-
ing symptoms of SAD as well as related fears and cognitions 
in children and adolescents. The SPAI-C has a sum score 
range of 0–52 with a clinical cut-off at 20 [55]. Although 
the SPAI-C is designed for children and adolescents between 
8 and 16; 11 years, the questionnaire can also be used up 
to age 18, as long as the adolescents are still students [55]. 
Both reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.92) and validity of 
the SPAI-C are considered as high [27, 59]. In the literature, 
there are different findings regarding the dimensions of the 
SPAI-C. Here, studies indicate a 1-factor [55], 3-factor [60], 
5-factor [61], or a hierarchical 5-factor solution with social 
anxiety as the upper factor [62]. All factor solutions were 
found in community samples [55, 62] or mixed samples of 
children with and without high social anxiety [60, 61].

Data Analysis

The  data  sets  were  merged  using  IBM  SPSS  26.0,  and 
all further analyses were performed with RStudio (RStu-
dio Team, 2020) using the lavaan [63], networktools [64], 
qgraph [65], and bootnet [66] packages.

A central problem of network analysis of psychopathology 
is that either all items of a questionnaire or a selection of 
items only based on the items’ content is included in the 
network analysis. While the former approach can lead to a 
strong overlap between included components [36], in the 
latter approach it is often not clear how the selection of 
items was achieved. Therefore, to prevent too much overlap 
between components and to base the item selection not only 
on theoretical but also on empirical criteria, we adopted an 
approach in which we empirically tested for the components 
and corresponding items of the SPAI-C we aimed to include 
in the current network. For this purpose, we conducted a 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in which we assigned 
items of the SPAI-C to the seven components (symptoms 
and cognitive variables described in theory section—see 
also Table A in Supplements). In this context, the CFA 
functioned as an empirical tool. The various CFA fit indices 
indicate whether the seven components included in the net-
work are empirically justifiable compared to factor solutions 
reported in the literature and the factor loadings show, which 
item is most representative of each component. For each of 
the seven components, we chose the item with the highest 
loading as representative to further reduce redundancy (see 
Table 2). Items that could not be assigned to a particular 
component (item 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, and 23) were 
excluded from the analysis. We then compared the fit indices 
of the CFA to test whether these seven resulting components 
prevailed over the factor solutions described in research (1-, 
3-, 5-, and hierarchical 5-factor solution). For this purpose, 
various fit indices [67] were used as measures of compari-
son (CFI, RMSEA, SRMR). Due to the ordinal scaling of 
the SPAI-C, we used the maximization likelihood method, 
which is robust to possible violations of the multivariate 
normal distribution. Accordingly, to calculate the factors 
already described in the literature, we used those items that

were assigned to each of the described factors in previous 
studies [55, 60–62]. According to all fit indices, our solu-
tion based on the seven components (χ2 (116) = 222.722, 
p < 0.001; CFI = 0.965, RMSEA = 0.067, SRMR = 0.035) 
showed a descriptively better fit than the other factor solu-
tions (5H factor solution (χ2 (203) = 452.915, p < 0.001, 
CFI =  0.916,  RMSEA = 0.078,  SRMR = 0.048);  5-fac-
tor  solution  (χ2  (198) = 434.193,  p < 0.001,  CFI = 921,

(227) = 458.784, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.926, RMSEA = 0.071,

p < 0.001, CFI = 0.878, RMSEA = 0.084, SRMR = 0.049)). 
In addition, we compared the chi-square model fit between 
the model based on the seven components and the mod-
els reported in literature using a chi-square difference test. 
Our model showed significantly better fit compared to all 
others (p < 0.001). Since the SPAI-C differentiates between 
physiological symptoms before (item 25) and in a social 
situation (item 26), we also checked whether an 8-factor 
solution with differentiated physiological symptoms adds 
value. Although fit indices were as good as for the solution 
based on the seven components, the goldbricker procedure 
[68] showed that item 25 and item 26 were redundant. The 
goldbricker procedure checks whether two components show 
similar correlations with other variables [47, 68]. Based on 
a minimum correlation of r = 0.80 and a threshold of 0.25, 
it was indicated that item 25 and item 26 correlate higher 
than r = 0.80 and have less than 25% different correlations, 
suggesting a huge thematic overlap. Therefore, we decided 
to include item 26 (physiological symptoms during a social 
situation) as Clark and Wells’ (1995) model refers to physi-
ological symptoms during a social situation. Concerning the 
resulting seven items, the goldbricker procedure did not indi-
cate any redundancy. Descriptive statistics of all items and 
an overview of items assigned to components (symptoms 
and cognitive variables) derived from theory are reported 
in the supplements.

Network Analysis

In order to assess our first assumption of a positively con-
nected symptom network, an undirected symptom network 
using a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) was estimated 
[69], based on the seven items of the SPAI-C. The sample 
size is sufficiently large enough to include seven nodes as it 
is within the recommendation of 3 subjects per calculated 
parameter (with n = 204, a maximum of 11 symptoms could 
be included) [36]. A least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (Lasso) regularization was applied, which removes 
weak links from the network and thus improves the power 
and interpretability of the network since fewer parameters 
need to be estimated. The used graph package automatically 
calculates 100 different networks to check which network 
performs best [39]. To obtain the network model with the 
best data fit, the extended Bayesian information criterion 
(EBIC) was applied, where the hyperparameter γ was set to 
0.5 according to the recommendations in the literature [38, 
70]. Since some of the SPAI-C items are ordinally scaled, 
the cor_auto function was used to calculate polychoric or 
polyserial correlations for ordinal variables [39]. Visualiza-
tion was based on qgraph [65] package using the Fruchter-
man–Rheingold algorithm by default [39]. To assess our 
second assumption that cognitive variables take a central 
role within the SAD network and that dysfunctional cog-
nitions act as a hub, we investigated connections between 
nodes (edge-weights) as well as at strength of nodes. Each 
node of the network represents one of the seven included 
components (symptoms or cognitive variables). Strength is 
defined as the sum of all absolute edge-weights of a single 
node and thus a measure for how well a node directly con-
nects to other nodes. Additionally, we calculated node pre-
dictability, which indicates how much variance of a single 
node is explained by all other nodes [41, 42]. While central-
ity is a relative measure that indicates how important one 
component is compared to the other components of the net-
work, predictability can absolutely indicate how adequately 
a component can be predicted by all other components [41,

42]. As the visualization of networks can be misleading 
regarding the edge-weights and the centrality of individual 
nodes, it is important to assess the accuracy of the network 
[39]. This was done by calculating bootstrapped difference 
tests between edge-weights and the three different centrality 
measures using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure with 
1000 bootstrap samples. As centrality measures should only 
be interpreted if they can be considered stable, the network’s 
stability was assessed using a case-dropping bootstrap pro-
cedure with 1000 bootstrap samples and subsequently cal-
culating the correlation stability coefficient (cs-coefficient) 
[39]. In this procedure, multiple networks with a decreasing 
number of included cases are estimated, and their correlation 
with the original network is calculated. The cs-coefficient 
indicates the proportion of people that can be dropped from 
the sample while remaining a set correlation (here 0.7) with 
the original network with a 95% probability. It has been 
recommended that ideally, the cs-coefficient should reach a 
value of > 0.5. However, centrality measures can still be con-
sidered stable and thus interpretable if they are > 0.25 [39].

Results

The  SAD  network  is  displayed  in  Fig.  1.  Edges  (links 
between nodes) represent partial correlations. In line with 
our first assumption, all edges of the network are positive. 
The confidence intervals (Fig. 2b) and difference tests (Sup-
plementary Material) regarding the edge weights confirm 
the strength of the association between nodes S21 (negative 
expectations) and S24 (dysfunctional cognitions in social 
situations) and S3 (observational anxiety) and S5 (perfor-
mance anxiety) shown in Fig. 1, as their associations are 
significantly stronger than the associations between almost 
all other nodes (Fig. 2). The only other edge showing a sig-
nificantly stronger relationship than at least one other edge 
was that between nodes S21 (negative expectations) and S19 
(avoidance behavior) (Supplementary Material).

Stability  analysis  showed  that  strength  (cs-coeffi-
cient = 0.256) was stable enough to be interpreted, albeit 
with caution, as the cs-coefficient barely exceeds the mini-
mum threshold of 0.25. Strength for the individual nodes is 
shown in Fig. 2a. In line with our second assumption, espe-
cially S24 (dysfunctional cognitions) proves to play a central 
role in the symptom network, as it has the highest strength 
of all nodes. Additionally, S21 (negative expectations) and 
S5 (performance fears) seem to have a descriptively higher 
strength concerning the other nodes of the network, indicat-
ing that they also play an important role within the symptom 
network.

The significance tests regarding the strength of each node 
(supplement material) indicate that only S24 (dysfunctional

cognitions) has a higher strength than S19 (avoidance) and 
S26 (physiological symptoms).

The analysis regarding the predictability of the nodes 
showed that, on average, 57% of the variance of individual 
components can be explained by the components of the net-
work connected with it. The variance resolution per node 
is displayed in the supplements. Remarkably, dysfunctional 
cognitions  (R2 = 71%) and negative expectations  (R2 = 69%) 
showed the highest amount of explained variance.

Discussion

In the study at hand, we aimed to model a symptom network 
of SAD in children and adolescents and to investigate the 
role of cognitive variables within this network. We were able 
to provide additional evidence that SAD can be conceptual-
ized as a positively interconnected network of symptoms in 
children and adolescents, as shown before by Miers et al. 
(2020) [52], based on a community sample of children and

adolescents. In this respect, SAD symptoms and cognitive 
variables in children do not seem to occur in isolation, but 
could, according to the assumption of network theory [35] 
and according to the assumption of Clark and Wells’ (1995) 
model, influence and activate each other and constitute a 
stable symptom network. Although it is important to empha-
size that the present network is based on cross-sectional data 
and thus no causal directionality can be inferred between the 
individual components, the parameters such as predictability 
and strength may be indicative of the importance of indi-
vidual components of the network. Consistent with previous 
research showing that internalizing disorders in particular 
exhibit high predictability and thus high variance resolution 
by variables within the network (on average: 42%) [42], the 
SAD network at hand also shows a high average predictabil-
ity (average variance resolution: 57%). This means that the 
occurrence of symptoms and cognitive variables is strongly 
predicted by other symptoms and cognitive variables of the 
network, which implies the assumption that neighboring 
components can be used in therapy to influence other com-
ponents [42]. In contrast, other disorders with low predict-
ability (e.g., psychosis: 28%) are more likely to be influenced 
by variables outside the symptom network (e.g., genes) [42].

Importance of Cognitive Variables

We were also able to show that cognitive variables have 
a  high  impact  within  the  SAD  network  in  children  and 
adolescents, which is indicated by the finding that the two 

cognitive variables showed the highest predictability and a 
high strength. This is consistent with findings of the study 
by Miers et al. (2020) [52], who were able to show that 
dysfunctional cognitions play a central role in the symptom 
network of SAD. In contrast to Miers et al. (2020) [52], 
we  differentiated  between  different  cognitive  variables 
and found that especially dysfunctional cognitions during 
a social situation were associated with most other investi-
gated symptoms. In line with the study by Miers et al. (2020) 
[52], our symptom network also shows no direct connection 
between dysfunctional cognitions and avoidance behavior, 
which was the only symptom to which the variable dysfunc-
tional cognitions was not connected. In contrast, negative 
expectations about social situations were more specifically 
and strongly associated with fewer components, particularly 
dysfunctional  cognitions,  physiological  symptoms,  and 
avoidance behavior. This indicates a strong mutual connec-
tion between different cognitive processes and an association 
between cognitions occurring before a social situation and 
an actual avoidance of a social situation. Our results sug-
gest that important variables of cognitive models of SAD, 
which have been formulated and already empirically tested 
for adulthood, also play a central role within the symptom 
network in children and adolescents. Similar to previous 
empirical studies [14, 17], this suggests that these models 
are at least partially valid for children and adolescents as 
well. Thus, SAD seems to be strongly shaped by cognitive 
mechanisms already in childhood and adolescence. In con-
trast to previous findings [14, 17, 24], our network further 

1 3Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:625–638

provides an opportunity to take a more nuanced look at the 
interplay between SAD symptoms and selected cognitive 
variables, such as negative expectations of social situations 
and dysfunctional cognitions in social situations. Unfortu-
nately, we could also not include other variables of cognitive 
models such as post-event processing or self-focused atten-
tion in the network analysis because the analysis was based 
on an existing data set, and no data were available in this 
regard. Regarding the included cognitive variables, we found 
one of the strongest connections of our network between 
negative expectations about and dysfunctional cognitions in 
a social situation (see Fig. 2). Since these two cognitive vari-
ables both loaded on different factors in our CFA and were 
recognized as sufficiently different by the goldbricker pro-
cedure, it can be assumed that they are two distinct variables 
with different connections to SAD symptoms, as postulated 
by the SAD models [12]. As initial studies using regression 
analyses have already shown that these two cognitive vari-
ables are strongly related [23, 24], we confirmed this con-
nection using the network approach.

Dysfunctional Cognitions

Most strikingly, dysfunctional cognitions seem to be central 
to the network as they are linked to all other components 
of the network (except avoidance behavior). It is impor-
tant to mention that although this variable has numerous 
connections to other components, which also results in the 
high strength value and high predictability of dysfunctional 
cognitions, only the connection to negative expectation is 
particularly strong. This may suggest that dysfunctional cog-
nitions have more of a nonspecific and global connection 
on symptoms of SAD. Overall, these findings are consistent 
with the assumptions of Clark and Wells’ (1995) cognitive 
model, in which expectations of social situations activate 
dysfunctional cognitions and these, in turn, act as a hub 
affecting several other components (e.g., physical symp-
toms). In line with Leigh and Clarks’ (2016) [31] idea of 
implementing concrete variables of cognitive models in 
therapy to improve their effectiveness in children and adoles-
cents, addressing dysfunctional cognitions in the treatment 
of SAD seems essential. The high centrality of dysfunctional 
cognitions in our study is also consistent with findings from 
studies in larger community samples showing that dysfunc-
tional cognitions were one of the strongest predictors of 
social anxiety [23], however inconsistent with the mixed 
findings regarding the frequency of dysfunctional cognitions 
in children and adolescents with SAD [17]. The conceptual-
ization of psychopathology in terms of the network approach 
could contribute to explain these findings. In this context, it 
is not necessarily the frequency but the influence of a symp-
tom on other symptoms within the network and thus the 

connectivity between symptoms that is of importance [35]. 
Thus, one could hypothesize that dysfunctional cognitions 
are not necessarily more frequent in children and adoles-
cents with SAD compared to healthy individuals, although 
they  may  be  stronger  associated  with  other  symptoms. 
Consistently, Heeren et al. [45] found no qualitative differ-
ence between the network of SAD symptoms in healthy and 
affected adults. However, the connections between nodes 
were stronger in individuals with SAD. In this regard, future 
research should focus on a comparison of a symptom net-
work between individuals with and without SAD.

Negative Expectations

In contrast to the global connection of dysfunctional cogni-
tions to components of the network, negative expectations 
are relatively specific but strongly linked to dysfunctional 
cognitions, avoidance behavior, and physiological symp-
toms. The link between negative expectations of social situ-
ations and avoidance behaviors, despite its lesser strength 
within the network compared to dysfunctional cognitions, 
may indicate a prominent role in the maintenance of SAD. 
Since negative expectations but not dysfunctional cogni-
tions in the social situation show an association with avoid-
ance behavior, negative thoughts prior to a social situation 
seem to be relevant for the behavioral symptomatology of 
SAD. For example, Clark and Wells’ (1995) model actu-
ally predicts that negative expectations of social situations 
are associated with avoidance of these situations [16] and 
thus contribute to the disorder’s maintenance since nega-
tive assumptions cannot be disconfirmed. Given that we 
cannot infer causal direction from our network, an influ-
ence from avoidance to negative expectation could also be 
possible. Here, a long-term avoidance of social situations 
could lead to the formation of negative expectations about 
these, as few (positive) social experiences are obtained. To 
our knowledge, no research has examined this relationship 
from which causal assumptions could be derived. In this 
context, longitudinal network analyses including compo-
nents of SAD, such as avoidance and cognitive variables, 
would be essential to examine the development of the symp-
tom network over time. Regardless of the causal direction 
between the two nodes, our network indicates that there is a 
close relationship between negative expectations and avoid-
ance behaviors, which might be important to emphasize in 
the therapy of SAD because avoidance behavior is consid-
ered as important for the maintenance of anxiety disorders 
[71]. In particular, the use of in vivo behavioral experiments 
that aim at challenging negative expectations by attending 
real social situations seems promising in this context. This 
technique, already used by some CBT programs for SAD 
[14, 31], involves formulating specific predictions for social 
situations (e.g., “if I say something, the other children will 

1 3634 

Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:625–638

laugh”) and recording how likely the event is to occur (e.g., 
90%). In systematic behavioral experiments (e.g., saying 
something in the presence of other children), it is checked 
whether this prediction was correct and whether the proba-
bility of the event was realistic. While CBT has already been 
proved to be effective for children and adolescents with SAD 
[32], future research should focus on individual components, 
such as behavioral experiments, in order to find out which 
components are most effective. Although we cannot assume 
causal direction from our results, these findings may provide 
preliminary evidence that behavioral experiments promise 
to reduce avoidance behavior by targeting negative expec-
tations. Consistently, the high predictability  (R2 = 0.69) of 
negative expectation in the current network suggests that it 
could be a cognitive variable well suited to influence neigh-
boring symptoms.

Social Fears

At the level of concrete social fear, all three fears (perfor-
mance, interaction, observation) were mutually connected, 
which indicates that they might influence each other. This is 
consistent with findings that individual social fears tend to 
occur in combination [11]. Further, performance and obser-
vational fears formed a strong link, whereas interactional 
fears were less strongly connected to the other two fears. 
While there are findings that interactional and performance 
fears lie at the heart of different subtypes of SAD [11], the 
role of observational fears in this context is less clear. For 
example, in the study of Knappe et al. (2009) [11], this fear 
was not explicitly compared to the other two fears regarding 
clinical features. Our study might suggest that observational 
fear is closely related to performance fear and thus might 
share similar clinical features. Since the importance of indi-
vidual social fears for SAD depends on the developmental 
stage [11, 72], it would be important for future research to 
examine networks of SAD in different age groups. In our 
sample, we had a broad age range of 8–18 years but a limited 
amount of individuals, so that the influence of concrete fears 
in our network could not be investigated.

Physiological Symptoms

Regarding the role of physiological symptoms within the 
SAD network, we neither found significantly stronger links 
to other symptoms nor a major influence on the network in 
general. While this may suggest that physiological symptoms 
play a comparatively minor role in SAD in children and ado-
lescents, experimental research also indicates that children 
with SAD do not necessarily show a stronger physiological 
reactivity towards social stress [73]. However, it is impor-
tant to note that the physiological symptoms included in 
our network analysis are based on subjective data. Research 

suggests that socially anxious children systematically over-
estimate their physiological symptoms [74]. Accordingly, 
future networks of SAD should differentially incorporate 
both an objective physiological measure and perceptions 
of physiological symptoms to account for the differential 
effects of these components.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths and limitations. First, the 
model of Clark and Wells (1995) [12] and previous research 
on cognitive variables of SAD in children and adolescents 
indicate that, in addition to the variables examined here, 
other mechanisms are central. Here, self-focused attention, 
post-event processing, and safety behavior are important 
variables that are known to be involved in SAD symptoma-
tology and which we were not able to include, because they 
were not assessed. Of the centrality measures for the SAD 
network, only strength was stable and thus interpretable, 
although even this did not reach the ideal threshold of 0.5. 
Second, it is important to emphasize that there is an ongoing 
controversy in the literature regarding the utility of network 
analysis and how its results can be interpreted, with some 
researchers arguing that associations between symptoms do 
not represent meaningful associations or are due to artifacts 
[75], and others arguing that networks are highly replicable 
and thus found associations cannot be mere artifacts [76]. 
One criticism, for example, is that in networks based on 
cross-sectional data, it is not possible to disentangle clearly 
whether associations between symptoms actually represent 
a meaningful association or are due to artifacts of, for exam-
ple, shared item content or method variance [75]. Network 
analysis represents a new approach that is constantly evolv-
ing, and we have taken advantage of current methodological 
possibilities to counteract possible error artifacts (for exam-
ple, empirical item selection and goldbricker procedure to 
eliminate overlapping items). Nevertheless, it is important 
to emphasize that the present network does not allow for 
conclusions to be drawn about directional connections and 
possible developments of symptoms over time and should 
rather be considered as a source for forming hypotheses 
about connections of symptoms and variables [77]. Third, 
we included children of a wide age range of 8–18 years in 
the current study. Therefore, the network at hand does not 
provide any information regarding the variation of symp-
toms and cognitive variables across developmental stages. It 
is important to emphasize that far-reaching cognitive devel-
opments take place during late childhood and adolescence, 
which appear to be due to an interaction between changes in 
neural circuitry and changes in the social environment [78]. 
Future studies should particularly focus on developmental 
changes and consider different age groups of children and 
adolescents when examining cognitive variables. Fourth, we 

1 3Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:625–638 

635

used a mixed sample of individuals with low and high social 
anxiety and did not analyze the network in a homogenous 
group of SAD patients, which might limit generalizability 
to clinical populations. While studies in adults suggest that 
the network structure does not differ between patients and 
healthy individuals, there is no empirical evidence for this 
in children and adolescents. However, since anxiety occurs 
normatively in childhood and adolescence and only becomes 
clinically relevant once it reaches a certain level or duration 
[3], it seems likely that there are no differences between 
patients and healthy individuals here either. In addition, the 
numerous high-socially anxious individuals, the relatively 
high variability (SD = 13.53), high amount of explained vari-
ance of symptoms, as well as relatively high mean SPAI-C 
sum score (M = 20.00) of our sample, which on average even 
exceeds the clinical cut-off of the SPAI-C, suggest a suffi-
cient variance regarding the SAD components of our sample. 
Also, the circumstance that some of the children additionally 
score higher on an SM screening is probably not problematic 
due to findings that children with SM do not differ from chil-
dren with SAD with respect to fear-related cognitions [54] 
and due to high comorbidity rates between both disorders 
[58]. Nevertheless, future studies should compare network 
structures of SAD between a clinical and healthy group in 
children and adolescents to prove the assumption of dimen-
sionality of social anxiety also for network analysis.

The study’s strengths are, first, that we were able to show 
that cognitive variables from Clark and Wells’ (1995) cogni-
tive model of SAD also represent central elements of SAD 
in children and adolescents in a sample with a substantial 
amount of highly socially anxious individuals. This sug-
gests that this model of SAD, created initially based on adult 
patients with SAD, is at least partially valid in children and 
adolescents. The advantages of network analysis compared 
to correlational studies are the quantification of the centrality 
of individual variables compared to other symptoms within 
the network and the identification of specific links between 
symptoms. Thus, we gained a fine-grained insight into the 
importance of cognitive variables and specific links between 
cognitive variables and other symptoms of the SAD network, 
which allowed us to derive possible therapeutic implications. 
Second, we conducted a combination of theory- and data-
driven item selection in advance to address methodological 
concerns about unregulated networks. Here, the resulting 
factor  solution  proved  superior  to  previous  factor  solu-
tions, and there was no evidence of conceptually overlap-
ping symptoms. This suggests that the calculated network 
includes central symptoms of SAD in childhood and adoles-
cence and that centrality measures are not distorted symp-
toms, which are too similar.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the study at hand provides evidence that 
SAD can be conceptualized as a positively interconnected 
network of symptoms in children and adolescents. The 
high amount of explained variance among symptoms could 
suggest that targeting central symptoms in the treatment of 
SAD might be associated with a significant impact on the 
other symptoms of the disorder. We further showed that 
the cognitive variables negative expectation and dysfunc-
tional cognitions have a differential effect on the symptom 
network of SAD. While dysfunctional cognitions seem to 
have a global influence on many different symptoms of 
SAD, negative expectations are strongly and more specifi-
cally connected to few symptoms, including avoidance of 
social situations. The results could implicate that targeting 
cognitive variables differentially in therapy might have dif-
ferent effects on symptoms of SAD.

Summary

In the present study, we investigated which role cognitive 
variables of Clark and Wells’ (1995) cognitive model of 
social anxiety disorder (SAD) play in children and ado-
lescents and how they relate to other symptoms of SAD. 
For this, we used the innovative network approach, which 
views mental disorders as networks of mutually activat-
ing symptoms. The analysis allows to gain a fine-grained 
insight into the interrelationships of individual symptoms 
and variables and to quantify their importance within the 
network. The present study, which was based on a mixed 
sample of high- and low-socially anxious children and 
adolescents, provides the second symptom network that 
exists with children and adolescents in the context of SAD. 
In contrast to the first network study by Miers et al. (2020), 
we differentiated on the two cognitive variables of SAD 
negative expectations and dysfunctional cognitions. The 
fine-grained examination of cognitive variables in chil-
dren and adolescents in the context of SAD is of central 
importance as specific targets of therapy can be derived 
from this. Although cognitive variables, in general, are 
already addressed in cognitive behavioral therapy, little is 
known about the relationship between specific cognitive 
variables components and symptoms of SAD in children 
and adolescents. We were able to show that SAD can also 
be presented in children and adolescents using a symptom 
network. While dysfunctional cognitions had the strong-
est influence within the network and were associated with 
almost all symptoms, negative expectations about social 
situations were more specifically associated with fewer 

1 3636

symptoms, including avoidance behavior. On the one hand, 
our results might suggest that dysfunctional cognitions act 
as a central hub during a social situation and activate other 
SAD symptoms, as postulated in cognitive models of SAD. 
On the other hand, negative expectations of social situa-
tions might play a special role in the maintenance of SAD 
because of the link to avoidance of social situations. Over-
all, the study suggests that a differentiated consideration of 
specific cognitive variables appears important in therapy 
for children and adolescents.
