Abstract

Purpose of review:  The incidence of mental health conditions within hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) patients is high and has profound impacts on quality of life after transplant. 
Mental health is an underexplored and underutilized outcome in this patient population.

Recent findings:  Standard mental health interventions in this patient population have shown 
limited results. Multiple factors including acuity of systemic illness, proinflammatory states, 
heterogeneous patient populations, and use of specific therapeutics could impact results. This 
presents the opportunity to identify new areas of improvement, such as focusing on leukocyte 
recovery, exogenous steroid use, and cytokine response to inform new bedside interventions.

Summary:  Overall, interventions incorporating the biological mechanisms of mental health are 
underutilized in the HSCT patient population and offer a novel approach to improving morbidity, 
mortality and quality of life.

INTRODUCTION

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used to treat a variety of hematologic 
conditions, both malignant and non-malignant. The term HSCT broadly categorizes different 
treatments involving different donor sources, chemotherapy and/or radiation agents, and 
protocols. The process often requires an individual to be isolated for several weeks while 
they undergo physically demanding conditioning regimens that ablate or partially ablate the 
diseased hematopoietic system and has the potential of significantly impacting other systems 
as well. As a result, patients face the possibility of damage to mucosal surfaces, compromise 
of barrier defenses, pancytopenia, and impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity 
leaving patients profoundly immunosuppressed (1). Even seemingly benign pathogens 
previously tolerated can become a source of infection resulting in patients requiring, at

times, specialized isolation units and minimal contact with outside support systems such as 
family, friends, and pets. This time that the patient spends in isolation is occurring all while 
experiencing the physical distress of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mouth 
sores, and bleeding. Patients also risk dangerous complications such as graft versus host 
disease (GVHD) with treatment often extending long after hospital discharge and/or acute 
treatment requiring frequent monitoring and lifelong immune suppression.

While the physical toll is one factor often addressed in treatment modalities, the 
psychological aspects of HSCT have been overshadowed despite growing evidence that 
mental health outcomes impact morbidity and mortality. Patients who undergo HSCT 
develop mental health conditions at alarming rates (Figure 1); 15–40% develop depression 
(compared to 6.7% in the general population), 20–52% develop anxiety (compared to 2.7% 
in the general population), and 19–28% develop post-traumatic stress disorder (compared to 
3.6% in the general population) (2–5). The nature of these conditions and their influence 
on patient function affect all aspects of treatment and quality of life. Common symptoms 
that patients face include fatigue, sleep disorders/insomnia, lack of motivation, changes 
in cognition, confusion, worry, sadness, helplessness, guilt, and suicidal thoughts. These 
symptoms present additional barriers for patient engagement in treatment and functionality. 
Depression has been associated with a one-to-three-fold higher mortality risk at three years 
following transplant (7). This is further supported by a 2023 meta-analysis looking at the 
effects of pre-existing depression for HSCT patients on overall survival which found a 
hazard ratio of 0.07 (95% confidence interval 1.03–1.11) supporting worsening survival 
outcomes for these patients (5). Clearly, mental health and physical health are irrevocably 
interconnected and should be considered together.

Advances in clinical medicine have improved treatment modalities and responses for HSCT 
patients. However, clinical research targeting mental health outcomes and quality of life 
remains underexplored. The standard treatments for mental health conditions face numerous 
challenges within this patient population due to the nature of their disease course and 
treatment. Patients are often isolated from support networks, face financial burdens, and 
are typically too sick to participate in classical therapy techniques (8). Physical side effects 
such as nausea limit application, likely causing medication interventions to fail (9). It is 
also difficult to determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral medications with the mucosal 
damage these patients can experience (10). There is currently no gold standard for mental 
health treatment for HSCT patients. Holistic approaches that involve multiple clinical teams 
present a unique opportunity to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In this paper, 
we will delve into research currently being conducted to improve mental health for HSCT 
patients and propose improved therapies targeting mental health outcomes.

The struggle to find meaningful interventions for mental health outcomes for HSCT 
patients

When we discuss HSCT patients, it is important to note that this title encompasses complex 
and heterogenous patient populations with several different treatment modalities and disease 
processes. These can include different variables such as autologous versus allogeneic 
transplantation (which can be further subdivided by donor source including bone marrow,

mobilized peripheral blood, and cord blood), degree of HLA mismatch, severity of GVHD, 
intensity of the conditioning regimen (i.e., resulting in different lengths of hospital stays or 
isolation protocols), and different pharmacologic agents given pre and post HSCT (i.e., rates 
of steroid use, etc.). A major pitfall is that many studies looking at mental health do not 
subdivide the patient populations by HSCT treatment modality or are underpowered for that 
type of analysis and thus are incapable of division into specific HSCT categories. Overall, 
the high complexity of this patient group presents a challenge for robust, meaningful mental 
health conclusions from the data.

Recent approaches to mental health in the HSCT patient population vary greatly with limited 
success. Many pharmacologic interventions have been reduced to case studies. However, a 
prospective randomized clinical trial tested whether prophylactic antidepressant treatment 
with sertraline, an oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can be used to treat depression 
in this patient population (11). Unfortunately, treatment did not impact risk of depression, 
quality of life metrics, or survival outcomes. Reasons for this remain open to speculation. 
However, this highlights the difficulty of using standard pharmacologic intervention with 
this group. Nonpharmacologic treatment modalities have also faced limited success. Another 
recent clinical trial attempted to use group psychotherapy (sometimes referred to as talk 
therapy), but it proved to be non-feasible due to problems with engagement and attendance 
caused by illness severity and condensed timeline before transplantation (8). From an 
individual psychotherapy approach, a pilot study utilized individual telephone psychotherapy 
designed specifically for HSCT patients (12). Researchers focused on fostering positive 
psychological well-being using targeted simple interventions (e.g., mindfulness, gratitude, 
and positivity) to help buffer against psychological distress. While this pilot study did not 
reach statistical significance, again highlighting problems with cohort sizes, it did show 
positive trends in secondary outcomes including gratitude, positive affect, life satisfaction 
and optimism. Based on these results, a multicenter study is ongoing. Other approaches 
included music therapy intervention and robot dog pet therapy intervention. These showed 
improvements in acute symptom burden and biomarkers of stress respectively but did not 
affect rates of depression, anxiety, or quality of life (13–14). There is currently no effective 
evidence-based practice or standard of care for mental health in these patients.

A biological underpinning of psychiatric disease: Neuroendocrine dysfunction

The neurobiological aspects of mental health are an active area of research, and there 
are several pathways that are particularly relevant to HSCT research. The neuroendocrine 
system plays a vital role in the regulation of behavioral health. Steroid treatment has been 
a mainstay of HSCT protocols for treatment of GVHD through reduction of inflammation. 
Exogenous steroid treatment, such as dexamethasone or prednisone, has been associated 
with delirium-like symptoms, elevated anxiety, insomnia, and depression in numerous 
clinical settings from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to autoimmune diseases 
(15). The exact mechanism remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. Disruption of 
glucocorticoid rhythms, which are key components to cyclical processes within the brain, 
has been shown to impair dendritic spine plasticity (16). The ability to form and edit 
neuronal connections through dendritic spine plasticity is a hallmark of healthy brain 
function and its dysregulation is established in multiple psychiatric conditions (16–17).

Corticosteroids also induce downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a 
prominent neurotrophin important for synaptic plasticity whose upregulation is believed to 
play a key role in the effectiveness of antidepressants (18).

Additional neuroendocrine factors affected in HSCT patients could include the dysregulation 
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. An intact HPA is important for numerous 
functions, including stress response, immunity, and sympathetic tone (19). HSCT patients 
experience elevated levels of cortisol, a major contributor to signaling within the HPA axis 
which is commonly elevated during times of stress (14). In fact, there is a validated rodent 
model for depression which involves repeated chronic situational stress, which leads to 
anhedonia symptoms (20). Important feedback loops within the HPA are disrupted with 
exogenous steroid use. Cortisol is often elevated in depression and 40% of patients with 
depression are resistant to the cortisol-suppressing effects of dexamethasone (21). This 
phenomenon is not isolated to the medically ill. In a placebo-controlled study where healthy 
individuals with no prior psychiatric history were given dexamethasone, 75% of individuals 
developed mood disturbances in just four days of treatment (22). Furthermore, there is a 
rodent model of depression that uses repeated corticosterone injections to induce depressive 
symptoms (23). A detailed review of the role of the HPA access in depression can be found 
here (24).

In summary, these observations suggest that the use of steroids could contribute to increased 
rates of depression in HSCT patients and the overreliance on exogenous steroid use is likely 
predisposing patients to worsening mental health outcomes. In our opinion, more research 
focusing on other treatments for acute GVHD would likely benefit mental and physical 
health outcomes. Reducing chronic stress exposure through shortening acute treatment 
timelines would also likely improve depressive symptoms for HSCT patients.

The complex role of inflammation within mental health and the HSCT population

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that inflammation within the immune system 
plays a role in mental health conditions. Emerging data suggests there is an important 
balance within the system, highlighting that both elevated and overly reduced inflammation 
is problematic (25). Of note, induced proinflammatory states in healthy individuals can 
induce both depression and anxiety symptoms (26). Additionally, clinical patients who 
are treated with cytokine therapy develop clinical depression at rates up to 40% (27). 
Within HSCT patients, elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10 have been 
correlated with worsening depression scores and increased risk of GVHD (28–29). To target 
these symptoms, researchers pre-emptively administered tocilizumab, an IL-6 antagonist, 
to HSCT patients in an attempt to improve mental health outcomes. Instead, they saw a 
worsening of depression and anxiety scores, even after multivariate analysis, highlighting 
that the proper balance of these cytokines is critical for mental health (30). Targeting or 
blocking these pathways from a hematologic perspective is perilous, as many of these 
cytokines play critical roles in hematopoietic stem cell recovery after transplantation. Both 
IL-6 and IL-10 are critical for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell function in the 
bone marrow. Therefore, blocking production of these cytokines using currently available 
methods is certain to have a negative impact on the hematopoietic stem cell niche and is

not considered to be a viable strategy for improving both mental and physical health. Given 
the ongoing difficulty of establishing the proper balance of these cytokines for best patient 
outcome, some have turned their focus upstream of cytokine production to the balance of the 
immune cell populations that produce the cytokines themselves.

Potential research strategies to improve outcomes using knowledge from the mental 
health field

Research has provided the groundwork for many breakthroughs to expand availability and 
improve outcome of HSCT in patients. Now we need to broaden the focus to include mental 
health as part of HSCT clinical trials. Overall, the research community is diving deeper into 
its understanding of the importance of improved immunological recovery post-transplant to 
reduce the possibility of infection, to shorten time under isolation (see review (31)), and to 
better understand allogeneic HSCT complications such as GVHD (see review (32)).

The role of immune cells in mental health is a topic of discussion but its role in 
HSCT patients has been minimally explored. Depression in general is associated with 
higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (33); whether this finding is causative or correlative 
to depression remains to be determined and there are varying conflicting opinions in the 
field on this matter (refer to review (34)). However, it is well established that neutrophil 
to lymphocyte ratios and/or rate of recovery are a commonly used metric to examine 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell engraftment following HSCT. More recent reports 
have demonstrated that recovery of the lymphocyte population strongly correlated to lower 
rates of GVHD and higher rates of overall and relapse free survival (35–39). Therefore, 
strategies to enhance recovery of lymphocytes without sacrificing neutrophil recovery may 
have the potential to increase a patienťs physical and mental health post HSCT. Enhanced 
recovery of these populations may also indirectly improve mental health through quickening 
the recovery time, as prolonged isolation has been associated with worsening mental health 
metrics (31). In our opinion, further experimentation and clinical trials are needed to verify 
these assumptions.

Depression is also associated with enhanced T helper 17 (Th17) to regulatory T cell (Treg) 
ratios (33). Understanding trends in T cell subset recovery following HSCT is also important 
as donor-derived T cells regulate GVHD. Th17, T helper 1 (Th1), and Treg cells have long 
been associated with both acute and chronic GVHD pathology, but how this links back to 
depression onset in these patients is not understood. In both patient studies and in preclinical 
mouse models, data suggests that the Th17/Treg and/or the Th17 and Th1/Treg ratio could 
be biomarkers for acute and chronic GVHD (40–42). A preclinical major MHC-mismatch 
model of HSCT study further demonstrated that inhibiting the differentiation of donor CD4+ 
T cells towards a Th17 and Th1 subset and thus skewing these cells towards a T helper 2 
and Treg phenotype reduces the severity of the acute GVHD response following allogeneic 
transplantation (43). The role of Th17 T cells and their related cytokines has also been 
linked to predicting acute GVHD. The presence of Th17 associated cytokines, IL-17 and 
IL-23, is connected with both the onset and resolution of acute GVHD (41). The findings of 
these studies taken together suggest that both Th17 and Tregs play a role in regulating the 
onset, severity, and resolution of GVHD. As we learn more about the balance of these cell

populations in GVHD progression in patients, more studies need to be performed on how 
these findings either correlate to or cause mental health pathology in our patient cohorts.

CONCLUSION

We have highlighted the importance of mental health for HSCT patients for both quality 
of life and physical health outcomes. There are biological mechanisms affecting mental 
health that are influenced by both disease processes and HSCT patient treatments that 
have the potential to offer novel therapeutic approaches where traditional interventions 
have failed. Broadly, these include neuroendocrine pathways, augmenting hematopoietic 
cell reconstitution, and modulating the inflammatory immune response. Incorporating 
mental health metrics with current ongoing clinical research creates well-rounded research 
strategies with the ability to have a positive impact on patient lives. It also needs to 
be recognized that there will not be a “one size fits all” solution, emphasizing need for 
researchers to work with clinicians and patients to obtain samples, exchange data, and have 
open discussion on what is best for the patient.

Overall, the role of mental health in HSCT patients should not be understated and remains 
underutilized as a means to improve outcomes for these patients. Profound advancements 
have been made in recent years enabling a wider variety of patients to receive treatment 
for an increasing number of diseases. Now that these accomplishments have enabled more 
patients to overcome their illness, we need to direct our focus to the quality of the life 
that follows. Patients face extraordinary stressors and obstacles on the road to recovery and 
ongoing maintenance. Traditional interventions for mental health have not proven effective. 
A new approach is needed.
