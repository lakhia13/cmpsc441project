- Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come.

- But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.

- Your anxiety symptoms might be different from someone else’s. That’s why it’s essential to know how anxiety can present itself.

It’s natural to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test.

This type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn’t interfere with your everyday life.

In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It’s intense and sometimes debilitating. This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy.

For example, it may prevent you from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home in extreme cases. If left untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.
