Perceived isolation (i.e., loneliness) has been linked to an immune response gene pro-

file known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), but little

is known about how positive social relations might affect human genome function.

We analyzed two studies of Korean adults to determine whether the positive qual-

ities of an individual’s general social relations with others (warmth, satisfaction, and

trust; as measured by the Positive Relations with Others [PRWO] subscale of the The

Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being) might be inversely associated with CTRA gene
expression. In Study 1 (53 participants, mean age = 72 years, 47% female), PRWO

were significantly associated with reduced CTRA profiles, even after controlling for
loneliness. Similarly, in Study 2 (152 participants, mean age = 45 years, 50% female),

PRWO were significantly associated with reduced CTRA profiles, particularly in the

context of higher collectivism. These findings suggest that gene regulatory correlates

of social flourishing extend beyond the absence of loneliness, and may contribute to

health advantages associated with social well-being. Loneliness and social flourishing

may not simply represent opposite ends of a single continuum but rather function as

related yet distinct processes affecting human molecular well-being.

IRF2, IRF7/8, MX1/2, OAS1-3, and OASL) and antibody synthesis (IGJ,

IGLL1, and IGLL3), which were sign-inverted to reflect their inverse

contribution to the CTRA. Using SAS PROC MIXED, we examined the

association between CTRA (log2-mRNA levels) and z-score standard-

ized measures of PRWO, loneliness, and social orientation. To control

for the correlation among multiple CTRA indicator transcripts within

individuals, the 53 CTRA indicator genes were analyzed as repeated

measures with a fully parameterized covariance matrix. Consistent
with previous studies,23,25,29,31 analyses controlled for a standard set

of covariates including age, sex, body mass index, health-related behav-

iors (e.g., smoking status: current smoker coded as 1 and nonsmoker as

0; alcohol consumption: more than once a week coded as 1 and less as

0), and illness symptoms (e.g., headache, upset stomach) reported dur-

ing the past month. To further explore interaction effects, we included
continuous interaction terms (i.e., social orientation × PRWO) in the

mixed linear model. To help visualize the nature of these interac-

tions, we conducted follow-up simple slopes analyses quantifying the

effect of PRWO on CTRA gene expression at the mean level of social

orientation, as well as at one SD above and below the mean social orien-

tation. Parameter estimates with standard errors and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were reported, and p values <0.05 were considered
