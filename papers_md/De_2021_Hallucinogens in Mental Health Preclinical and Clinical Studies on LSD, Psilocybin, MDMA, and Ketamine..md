A revamped interest in the study of hallucinogens has recently emerged, especially with regard to their potential application
in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In the last decade, a plethora of preclinical and clinical studies have confirmed the
efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression. More recently, emerging evidence has pointed out the potential therapeu-
tic properties of psilocybin and LSD, as well as their ability to modulate functional brain connectivity. Moreover, MDMA, a
compound belonging to the family of entactogens, has been demonstrated to be useful to treat post-traumatic stress disor-
ders. In this review, the pharmacology of hallucinogenic compounds is summarized by underscoring the differences between
psychedelic and nonpsychedelic hallucinogens as well as entactogens, and their behavioral effects in both animals and humans
are described. Together, these data substantiate the potentials of these compounds in treating mental diseases.

Introduction
Psychiatric disorders are a major public health concern affecting
;350 million people and imposing social and economic burdens
worldwide (Wittchen et al., 2011; Whiteford et al., 2013; Vigo et
al., 2019). Despite tremendous efforts to uncover pathophysiologi-
cal determinants, our understanding of psychiatric diseases and
their treatment remains limited. After a long hiatus stemming
from regulations that placed psychedelics in a restrictive regulated
drug schedule (Belouin and Henningfield, 2018), investigation of
these compounds is experiencing a renaissance in the research and
clinical communities, especially with regard to their therapeutic
application in mental disorders. Generally speaking, since the
1960s, hallucinogenic drugs have been classified into two groups:
the “serotonergic classic hallucinogens” or “psychedelics,” and the
“dissociative anesthetics.” Classic hallucinogens exert their pharma-
cological effects primarily through the 5-HT system, acting as ago-
nists of the 5-HT2A receptor (Vollenweider et al., 2007; Passie et al.,
2008; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). In contrast, “dissociative
anesthetics,” including ketamine, are considered to act on the

glutamatergic system and not on the 5-HT system, and they do not
produce the same so-called “trip” as psychedelics, but are still con-
sidered hallucinogens (Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). In the
last decade, numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans
have confirmed the usefulness of ketamine for the treatment of re-
sistant depression. Research has also suggested potential antide-
pressant and mood-modulating properties of psilocybin and LSD,
respectively, as well as the ability of these compounds to modulate
functional brain connectivity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a, 2017).
Other compounds,
including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphet-
amine (MDMA), are called entactogens. They produce psycho-
tropic effects, but they do not share the same mechanism of action
as hallucinogens (Kyzar et al., 2017). MDMA has been demon-
strated to increase sociability in animals (Morley et al., 2005; Pitts
et al., 2017; Curry et al., 2018; Heifets et al., 2019) and humans
(Mithoefer et al., 2016) and to be useful in treating post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (Mithoefer et al., 2011).

This review summarizes the pharmacological mechanism of
psychedelics, nonpsychedelic hallucinogens, and entactogens as
well as their impact on psychiatric research. In particular, we

clinical data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine; and (3)

cations in both animals and humans.

Psychedelics: the 5HT2A receptor
Psychedelics, also defined as “classic serotonergic hallucinogens”
because they interact with the 5-HT system, are strongly involved

Schematic overview of the main pharmacological targets of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, MDMA, and ketamine, the signaling cascades involved, hormonal modulation, as well as main

in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including depression
(Meltzer, 1990), anxiety (Charney et al., 1990), and cognitive def-
icits (Meltzer et al., 2011). Psychedelics primarily act as 5-HT2A
receptor agonists, but their mechanism of action is more com-
plex than originally thought. Indeed, psychedelics, including
LSD, psilocin, psilocybin (a prodrug of psilocin), and N,N-dime-
thyltryptamine (DMT), have been demonstrated to also interact
with 5HT1A, 5HT2B, 5HT2C, 5HT6, and 5HT7 receptors (Passie
et al., 2002, 2008; Nichols, 2004; Rickli et al., 2015; Wacker et al.,
2017). Furthermore, a growing body of evidence demonstrates
that both nonhallucinogenic (e.g., lisuride) and hallucinogenic
5-HT2A agonists can activate intracellular signaling cascades in
cortical pyramidal neurons, thus modulating downstream signal-
ing proteins, including b-arrestin, early growth response protein
1 (EGR1), and EGR2 (González-Maeso et al., 2007; Schmid et al.,
2008). Moreover, the activation of 5HT2A and 5HT1A receptors by
LSD in the mPFC activates both the serotonergic and dopaminer-
gic activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus and VTA, respectively. In
particular, low doses of LSD (up to 30 mg/kg) decrease the firing of
5-HT neurons without affecting the dopaminergic firing rate of
VTA neurons, whereas higher doses (40-60 mg/kg) decrease the
firing of dopaminergic VTA neurons (De Gregorio et al., 2016b).
While the 5-HT system is implicated in mood and anxiety regula-
tion, the dopaminergic system plays an important role in the
mechanism of action of psychedelics (De Gregorio et al., 2016a,
2016b, 2018). Drug discrimination tasks in rodents revealed that
the behavioral effects of LSD involve 5-HT2A receptors in an initial
phase, followed by a second phase that requires the dopamine D2
receptor (Marona-Lewicka et al., 2005). Furthermore, in vitro
studies showed that LSD binds to the recombinant human D2 re-
ceptor in HEK 293 cells (Rickli et al., 2015, 2016). A similar experi-
mental approach demonstrated that LSD also shows affinity for

dopamine D1 (Rickli et al., 2015) and D4 (Passie et al., 2008) recep-
tors. Finally, in vivo and in vitro evidence indicates a potential
interaction of psychedelics, particularly LSD, with the trace amino
associate receptor 1 (TAAR1) (Bunzow et al., 2001; De Gregorio
et al., 2016b; Rickli et al., 2016), although more research is needed
to understand the role of TAAR1 in the mechanism of action of
psychedelics. A schematic representation of LSD, psilocybin, and
DMT mechanism of action is shown in Figure 1.

Overall, psychedelic compounds display a pharmacological
activity that goes beyond their action as 5HT2A agonist, and fur-
ther investigations are needed to better elucidate their pleiotropic
mechanisms of action (for a detailed discussion of the mecha-
nism of action of psychedelics, see Passie et al., 2002, 2008;
Nichols, 2016).

Antidepressant effects of psychedelics: what can we learn
from animal studies?
There is evidence from studies in rodents that classic psyche-
delics, LSD (Buchborn et al., 2014; Hibicke et al., 2020), psilocin
(Horsley et al., 2018), psilocybin (Hibicke et al., 2020), and DMT
(Cameron et al., 2018, 2019), create long-term behavioral out-
comes comparable to those of traditional antidepressant treat-
ment in measures of coping strategy and cognitive function.
Additionally, animal studies pointed out that psychedelics can
enhance associative learning (Harvey, 2003; Buchborn et al.,
2014), a cognitive function commonly impaired by neuropsychi-
atric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD)
(Castaneda et al., 2008). However, a gold-standard protocol for
assessing the behavioral effects of psychedelics has yet to be
established, and a number of factors may confound the results,
including which animal model and behavioral measures are
used, as well as the kind of psychedelic drug tested. The literature

De Gregorio et al. · Hallucinogens in Mental Health

addressing the effects of psychedelics on rodent behaviors rele-
vant to psychiatric and cognitive function is sparse, and results of
different studies may appear to align or to conflict with each other
without being truly comparable. Dosing strategies must be taken
into account. Whereas some studies have reported cognitive and/
or behavioral enhancements using chronic (0.13 mg/kg/day LSD
to male Wistar rats) (Buchborn et al., 2014) or intermittent dos-
ing (1 mg/kg DMT every third day to mixed sex Sprague Dawley
rats) (Cameron et al., 2019), intermittent dosing (0.16 mg/kg LSD
every other day) has been shown to dramatically decrease soci-
ability and increase aggression in male SD rats (Marona-Lewicka
et al., 2011). Further investigation found that a single dose of psi-
locybin (1 mg/kg) or LSD (0.15 mg/kg) profoundly affected long-
term behavioral measures of male Wistar-Kyoto rats in a time-
and context-dependent way (Hibicke et al., 2020). Time intervals
between dosing and behavioral testing is another factor influenc-
ing the results of studies with psychedelics. While there is some
evidence that acute DMT increases active coping strategies in the
forced swim test (Cameron et al., 2018), psychedelics are not reli-
ably rapid antidepressants (Hibicke et al., 2020), and antidepres-
sant-like behavioral changes may not be measurable until 4 or
more weeks after the psychedelic experience (Hibicke et al.,
2020). As in humans, “set and setting” seems to play a role in the
long-term behavioral outcome of rodents given psychedelics.
Wistar-Kyoto rats given a single dose of psilocybin (1 mg/kg)
then tested in the forced swim test at various time points
between 1 and 5 weeks after administration, and in the ele-
vated plus maze 6 weeks after administration, develop distinct
behavioral responses depending on when they first encounter
the forced swim test (Hibicke et al., 2020). Rats tested only
once in the forced swim test (one swim, 5 weeks after psilocy-
bin) were significantly and profoundly more likely to use
active coping strategies (swimming/climbing) than a passive
coping strategy (immobility) in that assay, but were not differ-
ent from control rats in their elevated plus maze behavior a
week later. However, rats tested in the forced swim test weekly
for 5 weeks (five total swims), or 1 and 5 weeks (two swims)
were only slightly (but significantly) more active in the forced
swim test than control animals, and displayed significantly
less anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze 6 weeks af-
ter psilocybin (Hibicke et al., 2020).

One explanation for these differences is that psychedelic
administration produces a period of behavioral flexibility in
which new coping strategies can be learned. These animal studies
suggest that psychedelic-assisted therapy may become a powerful
tool for treating psychiatric and cognitive disorders, as the timing
and the environmental context of administration are relevant for
psychedelic therapeutics.

What do psychedelics do to the human brain?
The development of functional neuroimaging techniques has
allowed researchers to better understand the impact of psyche-
delic drugs on brain connectivity patterns and on the activity of
specific brain regions in humans. Alteration of information proc-
essing within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical feedback loops is
one mechanism suggested to underlie the psychedelic state
(Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001; Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008).
In healthy human participants, two neuroimaging studies con-
firmed that LSD induces increases in functional connectivity
between the thalamus and sensory-somatomotor cortical regions
(Muller et al., 2017; Preller et al., 2018). Additionally, LSD
increased connectivity from the thalamus to the posterior cingu-
late cortex and concurrently decreased connectivity to the

temporal cortex (Preller et al., 2019). These empirical results are
in line with the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical model; how-
ever, they do not support the hypothesis that LSD generates
an undifferentiated increase in thalamocortical connectivity
and information flow, but rather suggest a strengthening of
specific connections between the thalamus and specific cortical
areas. Data-driven approaches investigating the connectivity
between each voxel of the brain have furthermore revealed that
LSD and psilocybin increase interaction between sensory and
somatomotor brain networks, and decrease communication
among associative bran regions, including large scale brain-net-
work, such as the Default Mode Network (Preller et al., 2018,
2020).

Together, these results suggest that increased processing of
sensory information, potentially as a result of decreased thalamic
gating, and concurrently reduced integration capacity because of
diminished associative network integrity may underlie psyche-
delic experiences. It is possible that the altered integration of sen-
sory perceptions facilitates a novel experience of the self and its
environment and may help to reduce rigid or ruminative think-
ing patterns as observed in psychiatric disorders. However, this
hypothesis still needs to be tested in clinical populations.

Additional studies investigating a priori hypotheses using seed-
based imaging approaches have shown that subjective effects
induced by psilocybin are associated with changes in the ampli-
tude of low-frequency fluctuations and the variance of BOLD sig-
nal in the claustrum (Barrett et al., 2020a). Furthermore, this study
showed that psilocybin decreased connectivity between the right
claustrum and the auditory network and the Default Mode
Network and concurrently increased connectivity with the fronto-
parietal control network (Barrett et al., 2020a). Additionally,
changes in positive mood after a low dose of LSD were associated
with increases in amygdala, frontal cortex connectivity (Bershad et
al., 2019). Various other studies showed decreased connectivity
between structures of the Default Mode Network after the admin-
istration of LSD, DMT, and psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2012, 2016b; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Palhano-Fontes et
al., 2015; Muller et al., 2018; Preller et al., 2018). Finally, a promi-
nent feature of psychedelics is alterations in visual perception.
Those have repeatedly been associated with decreases in aoscilla-
tions, in particular over posterior parieto-occipital brain areas,
suggesting that psychedelics increase the excitability of the visual
pathway (Kometer et al., 2013; Schenberg et al., 2015; Valle et al.,
2016; Pallavicini et al., 2019; Timmermann et al., 2019).

Neuroimaging studies investigating the effects of psychedelics
in clinical populations with mental health conditions are still
scarce. So far, it has been shown that treatment response meas-
ured 5 weeks after psilocybin treatment in patients with MDD
was predicted by decreased connectivity between the PFC and
the parahippocampus increased connectivity between the PFC
and the inferior parietal cortex, 1 d after psilocybin administra-
tion. Furthermore, decreased amygdala cerebral blood flow corre-
lated with reduced symptoms in the same study (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2017). The same patients showed increased amygdala reac-
tivity the morning after psilocybin and a reduction in amygdala,
PFC connectivity in response to fearful faces (Roseman et al.,
2018; Mertens et al., 2020). These results are surprising given that
decreased amygdala reactivity and increased amygdala-PFC con-
nectivity under the acute influence of psychedelics have been
shown to correlate with positive mood in healthy participants
(Kraehenmann et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2017; Bershad et al.,
2019). Furthermore, reduced amygdala reactivity in response to
emotional stimuli was still present in healthy people 1 week after

894 (cid:129) J. Neurosci., February 3, 2021 (cid:129) 41(5):891–900

De Gregorio et al. · Hallucinogens in Mental Health

psilocybin administration (Barrett et al., 2020b), and this reduc-
tion has been hypothesized to be an important therapeutic mech-
anism because it may indicate that psychedelics normalize the
negative cognitive bias observed in patients suffering from
depression (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). It has to be noted, how-
ever, that increased amygdala reactivity in depressed patients was
measured before any psychological or psychotherapeutic inter-
ventions aiming at
integrating the psychedelic experience
(Roseman et al., 2018). It is therefore conceivable that psilocybin
facilitated the processing of negative life events, leading to mark-
edly increased emotional processing and amygdala reactivity the
morning after the session. Additional studies in clinical popula-
tions assessing long-term changes in brain activity and connectiv-
ity are necessary to clarify the mechanisms underlying the
therapeutic effects of psychedelics.

Ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant acting through
NMDA and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1)
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that marked a new era for
the treatment of resistant MDD patients. Ketamine indeed pro-
duces fast antidepressant effects in both animal and humans at
subanesthetic doses. Although ketamine does not appear to pri-
marily target the serotonergic system, it is nonetheless capable of
inducing psychedelic states (Dore et al., 2019). The antidepressant
mechanism of action of ketamine remains the subject of intensive
research. Ketamine is both a noncompetitive NMDAR, a gluta-
mate receptor subtype broadly expressed in the CNS (Duman,
2018) antagonist, and an activator of the mTORC1 pathway
(Workman et al., 2018; Zanos and Gould, 2018). Early studies in
mice indicated that the NMDAR blocker, MK-801, and the com-
petitive NMDAR inhibitor AP-7 decreased immobility time in
the forced swim test, prompting the idea that NMDAR antago-
nism had antidepressant potential (Workman et al., 2018; Zanos
and Gould, 2018). Despite the initial evidence in mice, NMDAR
antagonism appears nonessential for ketamine’s antidepressant
action (Zanos and Gould, 2018). For example, other noncompeti-
tive NMDAR antagonists, including memantine and MK-801, ei-
ther lack antidepressant effects (e.g., memantine) or only have
short-lasting effects, which are often inconsistent between studies
(e.g., MK-801) (Zanos and Gould, 2018). This suggests that addi-
tional, non-NMDAR-mediated effects of ketamine mediate its
striking antidepressant action, although the role of subtype spe-
cific binding to NMDRs of the different antagonists cannot be
ruled out.

Consistent with this notion, chemical alteration of ketamine
(via deuteration at the C6 position), which does not change its
binding affinity for the NMDAR, but dramatically decreases its
metabolism to a major metabolite (2S,6S;2R,6R)-hydroxynorket-
amine (HNK) in vivo, nullifies ketamine’s antidepressant actions
in mice (Zanos et al., 2016). Furthermore, both HNK enantiom-
ers [(2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-HNK] exerted dose-dependent antide-
pressant actions in several rodent tests (Zanos et al., 2016; Yang
et al., 2017; Pham et al., 2018). Interestingly, (2R,6R)-HNK, the
enantiomer with the stronger antidepressant-like effects, is a less
potent antagonist of NMDAR than ketamine itself (Moaddel et
al., 2013; Zanos et al., 2016, 2017; Morris et al., 2017; Suzuki et
al., 2017). Because of its reduced effects at the NMDAR, (2R,6R)-
HNK did not induce NMDAR inhibition-mediated side effects,
such as sensorimotor dissociation (Zanos et al., 2016). However,
(2R,6R)-HNK does not appear to be as potent as ketamine in
relieving the behavioral changes induced by chronic social defeat
in mice (Yang et al., 2017), suggesting the involvement of both

NMDAR-dependent and -independent pathways. Ketamine
induces both synaptic and structural plasticity in the hippocam-
pus, mPFC, and lateral habenula (Li et al., 2010, 2011; Yang et
al., 2018b; Moda-Sava et al., 2019), involving signaling pathways
that control protein synthesis (Li et al., 2010; Autry et al., 2011),
such as the mTORC1 pathway. Indeed, increasing evidence sug-
gests that activation of mTORC1 is a critical mechanism under-
lying the antidepressant action of ketamine and its metabolite
(2R,6R)-HNK (Workman et al., 2018; Zanos and Gould, 2018).
Numerous studies demonstrated that a single dose of ketamine
and HNK induce a transient increase in phospho-mTOR and its
targets, phospho-p70S6 kinase and phospho-4E-BP1, in the PFC
and hippocampus of mice and rats (Li et al., 2010; Carrier and
Kabbaj, 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2014; Paul et al.,
2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017). More importantly, in-
tracerebroventricular pretreatment with the allosteric mTORC1
inhibitor, rapamycin, blocked ketamine-induced synaptic molec-
ular and behavioral effects relevant for antidepressant actions,
including increased synaptic densities in the PFC, and decreased
immobility in the forced swim test and latency to feed in the nov-
elty suppressed feeding test (Li et al., 2010; Holubova et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2018a). mTORC1 controls numerous neuronal func-
tions, including nucleotide and lipid synthesis, glucose metabo-
lism, autophagy, lysosome biogenesis, proteasome assembly, and
59 cap-dependent mRNA translation (also known as protein syn-
thesis) (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009; Saxton and Sabatini,
2017). Local dendritic translation of mRNA into protein is essen-
tial both for the homeostasis of synaptic function and for synaptic
plasticity (Jung et al., 2014; Aguilar-Valles et al., 2018), which is
thought to allow the brain to store information and display
adaptive responses to subsequent related stimuli (Holtmaat
and Svoboda, 2009; Duman et al., 2016). Key targets of the
local activation of mRNA translation by ketamine are the
AMPAR subunits, GluA1 and GluA2 (Workman et al., 2018).
AMPARs mediate ketamine-induced synaptic facilitation in
the mPFC and hippocampus (Li et al., 2010; Zanos et al., 2016;
for review, see also Aleksandrova et al., 2017).

Clinical perspectives of ketamine
Ketamine’s antidepressant properties have now been appreciated
for almost two decades (Duman, 2018). Several placebo-con-
trolled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of suba-
nesthetic doses of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, infused over 40 min) for
depression and suicidal ideation in MDD patients resistant to
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Berman et al., 2000;
Zarate et al., 2006a; Price et al., 2009, 2014; DiazGranados et al.,
2010; Ballard et al., 2014). In depressed patients, ketamine’s
defining features are its rapid therapeutic onset, measurable at 4
h, and its week-plus-long efficacy after a single infusion. Single
infusions of ketamine are associated with a therapeutic response
rate of 50%-70% at 1 d after treatment (Murrough et al.,
2013b). Repeated treatments have the potential to sustain an
antidepressant effect, although the overall response rate
appears comparable to single-dose infusions (Murrough et
al., 2013a; Singh et al., 2016), confirmed by recent results
(Shiroma et al., 2020). In an open-label study, repeated injec-
tion of ketamine showed a decrease of 69% in suicidal idea-
tion (Phillips et al., 2020). However, ketamine has significant
abuse liability, and its long-term use is associated with nota-
ble bladder and neurologic toxicity (Schatzberg, 2014).

The physiological mechanisms for inducing and maintaining
ketamine’s lasting effects in humans are not yet understood well
enough to design similar therapeutics with improved durability

De Gregorio et al. · Hallucinogens in Mental Health

and safety. As previously explained, ketamine’s antidepres-
sant mechanism has long been attributed to antagonism of
the NMDAR and to the activation of mTORC1. However,
other NMDAR antagonists have failed to show clinical effi-
cacy comparable to ketamine for MDD (Heresco-Levy et al.,
2006; Zarate et al., 2006b; Sanacora et al., 2017; Wilkinson
and Sanacora, 2019), suggesting that
the mechanism of
action of ketamine as an antidepressant is more complex
than its action on NMDARs. More recently, clinical trials
testing some of the predictions derived from NMDAR-based
models have yielded unexpected results (Costi et al., 2019;
Abdallah et al., 2020). Concerning the mTORC1 pathway,
for example, a recent clinical study demonstrated that pe-
ripheral coadministration of rapamycin to treatment-resist-
the
ant MDD patients enhanced, rather than blocked,
antidepressant effect of ketamine (Abdallah et al., 2020), sug-
gesting a more complex interaction between these drugs in
humans.

Nevertheless, the mTORC1 signaling pathway is downregu-
lated in the hippocampus and PFC of MDD in postmortem tis-
sue (Jernigan et al., 2011), consistent with this signaling pathway
being relevant for the treatment of MDD. Other signaling sys-
tems, for example, opioid receptors (Williams et al., 2018), may
also play a role, which is perhaps unsurprising in light of the di-
versity of ketamine’s pharmacological targets. Shifting our per-
spective from receptor-based mechanisms to a neural-systems
level analysis may provide new directions for optimizing keta-
mine therapy and developing novel treatments based on ket-
amine’s mechanism.

Clinical studies are just beginning to map the similarities
between ketamine and other psychedelic-assisted therapies.
There is still significant debate regarding the role of the con-
scious subjective experience (typically described as “dissocia-
tion”) that patients report during the subanesthetic ketamine
infusion regimen. Some studies have linked ketamine’s antide-
pressant potency to its dissociative effect (Zarate et al., 2006a;
Monteggia and Kavalali, 2013; Niciu et al., 2018) and suggest
that conscious awareness and sensory processing are crucial for
ketamine’s antidepressant effect (Dore et al., 2019). On the other
hand, some clinical data suggest that dissociation is neither nec-
essary (Leal et al., 2020) nor sufficient (Williams et al., 2018) to
account for ketamine’s efficacy. It is entirely possible that keta-
mine antidepressant therapy in a medicalized setting is function-
ally and mechanistically distinct from the emerging practice of
ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (Dore et al., 2019).

MDMA, a psychotropic drug with unique prosocial effects
MDMA has emerged as a powerful adjunct to psychotherapy,
with growing evidence for efficacy in the treatment of PTSD.
This prototypical entactogen is an amphetamine derivative
(Nichols, 1986), which primarily releases supraphysiological
levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine via their
respective reuptake transporters (SERT, DAT, and NET)
(Rothman and Baumann, 2002; Green et al., 2003; Gudelsky
and Yamamoto, 2008). MDMA also stimulates the release of
hormones, including oxytocin, vasopressin, and cortisol (Green et
al., 2003; Kamilar-Britt and Bedi, 2015). A schematic representa-
tion of the mechanism of MDMA is shown in Figure 1. For many
years, animal studies of MDMA focused on MDMA-associated
neurotoxicity, hyperthermia, psychostimulant effects, and abuse
potential, none of which are obviously related to its therapeutic
mechanism (Green et al., 2003). While MDMA’s therapeutic
mechanism is not fully understood, clinical experience indicates

that long-lasting benefits are more likely to occur when it is used
as an adjunct to psychotherapy rather than as a stand-alone ther-
apy (Greer and Tolbert, 1986; Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1986).
Widespread adoption of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be
limited by MDMA’s potential for abuse and an incompatibility
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Heifets and Malenka,
2019). Improving on MDMA as a psychotherapeutic adjunct
requires a deeper understanding of the pharmacology and neural
dynamics underlying MDMA’s therapeutic effect in humans.

Toward this end, recent work in rodents has modeled distinct
behavioral processes hypothesized to play a role in MDMA-
assisted psychotherapy. MDMA’s hallmark effect is an acutely
enhanced feeling of openness, trust, and social connection, all of
which may serve to enhance the therapeutic alliance (Mithoefer
et al., 2016). Similarly, in several species (Morley et al., 2005;
Pitts et al., 2017; Curry et al., 2018; Heifets et al., 2019), MDMA
can produce an array of affiliative and prosocial behaviors.
MDMA may also modify the sensitivity to social reward in mice,
an effect lasting weeks after a single dose (Nardou et al., 2019),
reminiscent of the “integration therapy” process after an MDMA
experience, wherein a patient is encouraged to consider how
emotional shifts in the aftermath of their MDMA session may be
integrated into daily life (Greer and Tolbert, 1986). Finally,
MDMA disrupts fear memories in a widely used model for
PTSD (Young et al., 2015, 2017; Hake et al., 2019), wherein a
conditioned fear memory is extinguished by re-cueing the mem-
ory in a safe context.

Investigators consistently find that SERT-mediated 5-HT
release is necessary (Young et al., 2017; Heifets et al., 2019;
Nardou et al., 2019), and potentially sufficient (Walsh et al.,
2018), to account for the putative therapeutic mechanisms of
MDMA. Notably, these models’ differences could inform human
mechanistic trials. Fear extinction does not involve any particular
social context, and mouse data suggest that 5-HT release in baso-
lateral amygdala fully accounts for MDMA’s effect on fear mem-
ory (Young et al., 2015). In contrast, social behavioral models
find that 5-HT release in the nucleus accumbens explains
MDMA’s effects (Walsh et al., 2018; Heifets et al., 2019; Nardou
et al., 2019). Various 5-HT receptor subtypes appear necessary
(Heifets et al., 2019; Nardou et al., 2019), although it is unclear
whether any one subtype’s activity can reproduce MDMA’s pro-
social effects. Finally, although MDMA and oxytocin actions
overlap (Dölen et al., 2013; Kamilar-Britt and Bedi, 2015;
Nardou et al., 2019), available data in rodents (Ramos et al.,
2016; Heifets et al., 2019) and humans (Kamilar-Britt and Bedi,
2015) suggest that oxytocin receptor signaling is not required for
MDMA’s acute prosocial effects, but may be involved in longer-
term processes initiated by MDMA effects (Nardou et al., 2019).
These studies make clear predictions that it can be tested in clini-
cal experiments, the results of which will both refine our under-
standing of how clinical MDMA therapy works and improve the
accuracy of preclinical models.

MDMA in clinical studies
MDMA was first administered clinically in the 1970s (Shulgin,
1978), at which time there was speculation that the drug acted to
“fortify the therapeutic alliance by inviting self-disclosure and
enhancing trust” (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1986). A series of small,
uncontrolled studies followed, which together suggested that
MDMA was an effective adjunct to psychotherapy, especially in
those suffering from anxiety (Greer and Tolbert, 1986; Grinspoon
and Bakalar, 1986). Research was halted when MDMA was placed
on the DEA Schedule 1 list in 1985, and scientific assessment of

the compound’s therapeutic efficacy did not resume until the
mid-1990s (Nutt et al., 2013). A Phase 1 dose-finding and
safety study in MDMA-experienced subjects was conducted
shortly thereafter (Grob et al., 1996) and suggested that a
range of doses (0.25-1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) could safely be adminis-
tered with minimal side effects. More recent data have shown
that MDMA commonly induces side effects that include
teeth grinding, jaw clenching, headache, lack of appetite, fa-
tigue, dizziness, and nausea but that these are most often
mild to moderate and resolve without assistance and shortly
after treatment (Mithoefer et al., 2011). Additional Phase 1
data are currently being collected (Psychological Effects of
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) When Administered
to Healthy Volunteers, 2020). While there had been previous con-
cern over the potentially toxic effects of MDMA (Ricaurte et al.,
2002), the paper reporting widespread dopaminergic and serotoner-
gic neurotoxicity in nonhuman primates turned out to be deeply
flawed and was eventually retracted (Ricaurte et al., 2003).

Early human data indicate that MDMA could be particu-
larly useful in assisting emotional processing and, therefore,
recovery in people suffering from PTSD (Sessa, 2011). The
first randomized and controlled pilot study found that either
two or three administrations of MDMA enabled a significant
and long-lasting reduction in PTSD symptoms (Mithoefer et
al., 2011). Perhaps most intriguing, not only were the effects
of MDMA on PTSD symptomology robust, but they also
appeared to be extremely durable, lasting for at least 1 year
after treatment (Mithoefer et al., 2013). Approximately one dozen
Phase 2 studies have now been conducted using MDMA in popu-
lations with severe, treatment-resistant PTSD, and the results have
been consistently encouraging. Pooled analysis from six of these
Phase 2 clinical trials (Mithoefer et al., 2019) enabled the FDA to
grant Breakthrough Therapy status for MDMA treatment of
PTSD and has facilitated the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial
(Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, 2018). A
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study of
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of severe PTSD
is currently in progress (Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-
Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD, 2020). The open-label lead-in
data from this Phase 3 trial have shown that MDMA significantly
and robustly attenuates several of the prototypical symptoms of
PTSD (J. Mitchell, unpublished data). While we must still await
final analyses and publication of Phase 3 data, the early trial data
suggest that MDMA, in conjunction with psychotherapy, may be
a fruitful therapeutic for several complex treatment populations,
which lends further credence to the theory that psychedelic medi-
cines could prove to be rapid, long-lasting, novel therapeutics for
mental health disorders.

Recent data suggest that MDMA may also be efficacious in
other clinical populations, including people with autism spectrum
disorder (Danforth et al., 2018) and with alcohol use disorder
(Sessa, 2018). With respect to alcohol use disorder, safety and tol-
erability data from a pilot population have already been published
(Sessa et al., 2019), and a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate
changes in alcohol use disorder is currently underway (Bristol
Imperial MDMA in Alcoholism Study, 2020). Although therapeu-
tic facilitation has been shown to clearly influence treatment out-
come (Mithoefer et al., 2016; Krediet et al., 2020), more research
must still be conducted to determine which therapeutic interac-
tion works best for different clinical populations. Furthermore,
although context is known to be an important variable in the
therapeutic impact of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018),
little work has been conducted to date to unravel the complicated

interaction between set and setting and MDMA treatment
outcome.

In conclusion, in this review, we offered an overview of how
different hallucinogens may produce distinct behavioral out-
comes with different molecular and neuronal mechanisms of
action. All these psychoactive drugs can cause subjective changes
in perception, thought, emotion, and consciousness, although
with a different mechanism. From preclinical studies, it is clear
that the mechanism of hallucinogens is more complex than
thought before since their effects on the 5-HT and glutamatergic
system as well as their capacity to modulate transcriptional
mechanisms seem to emerge very clearly (for review, see Inserra
et al., 2021). Importantly, clinical studies have demonstrated the
effects of ketamine in treatment-resistant MDD (Marcantoni et
al., 2020). Moreover, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial has shown the use of MDMA associated to psychotherapy
in PTSD (Mithoefer et al., 2019). In addition, open-label studies
and double-blind studies have demonstrated the effects of psyloci-
bin in depression and anxiety, even if a recent meta-analysis sug-
gests that more studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy
(Goldberg et al., 2020). Intriguingly, the potential use of psilocybin
in alcohol use disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder seems
also promising, and several clinical trials are ongoing (Clinical and
Mechanistic Effects of Psilocybin in Alcohol Addicted Patients,
2020; Efficacy of Psilocybin in OCD: a Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled Study, 2020).

Finally, LSD showed promising results in patients with
depression and anxiety (Gasser et al., 2014, 2015), and clinical
trials are ongoing for MDD (for review, see Inserra et al., 2020).
Along with the potential use of hallucinogenic compounds in the
clinic, it is undeniable that they also represent an important tool
to better understand the neuronal circuitries, brain connectivity,
pharmacological targets, and signaling cascades behind the pa-
thology of mental disorders.
