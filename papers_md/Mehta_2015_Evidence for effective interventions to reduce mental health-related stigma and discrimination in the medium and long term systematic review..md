Background
Most research on interventions to counter stigma and
discrimination has focused on short-term outcomes
and has been conducted in high-income settings.

Aims
To synthesise what is known globally about effective
interventions to reduce mental
discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium
and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to
interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

illness-based stigma and

Method
We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and
conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative
studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were
calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative
syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared
interventions with and without social contact.

Results
Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For
studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which
21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean
differences were 0.54 for knowledge and 70.26 for

stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct
or indirect) were not more effective than those without.
The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries.
Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes
or in LMIC studies.

Conclusions
There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma
interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of
increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes.
Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the
more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in
the medium to long term. Methodologically strong research
is needed on which to base decisions on investment in
stigma-reducing interventions.

Since Goffman’s seminal work on stigma,1 research in this field has
steadily grown,2 although most work consists of surveys among
the general public about attitudes towards people with mental
illness,3–6 and much less is known about effective interventions
to reduce stigma,6 or about stigma in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs).7–10 To better understand the evidence base
on interventions to reduce mental
illness-related stigma and
discrimination, we identified eight existing systematic reviews
on this topic.11–18 The reviews varied widely in their methods
and foci. There was considerable methodological and clinical
heterogeneity in the included studies, and consequently meta-
analysis was only undertaken in one review,11 and for small
subgroups in two others.12,13 Four reviews presented data or
commented on the overall pattern of effect sizes,11–14 and in each
of these the interventions had small to moderate effects, using
Cohen’s interpretation.19 There was clearest consensus that the
interventions containing social contact and first-person narratives
were more effective than others.11,13,15,16 Two of the reviews
explored moderators of effects to understand which types of
contact work best,11,13 but there is a need for more research in this
area. Two reviews indicated that some interventions have the
potential to worsen stigma.13,17 Most of the reviews were critical
of the methodological quality of the included studies,12–15,18
commenting in particular on the need for more randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) and robust methods generally; the use

of unvalidated measures; and the relative lack of follow-up beyond
the immediate post-intervention period. Other study limitations
noted were the use of convenience samples,13,15,17 small sample
sizes,14 or inappropriate outcome measures.14,15 Some reviews
highlighted the poor quality of the interventions, which were
sometimes delivered without training, manualisation or fidelity
checks,11 and interventions often lacked a theoretical under-
pinning and developmental research.13,14 In all except one review,
which was restricted to studies in Iran,12 interventions taking
place in LMICs were a small minority or did not feature. From this
scoping of existing systematic reviews we concluded that there was
a need for a further systematic review to synthesise the evidence
on two key issues: effectiveness in the longer term and in LMIC
contexts. Consequently this systematic review aimed to assess
the effectiveness of interventions (of any type with any target
population), compared with inactive or baseline comparators, in
reducing mental health-related stigma (knowledge, attitudes and
behaviour) using any quantitative study design, addressing
specifically the evidence for medium- and long-term effectiveness
(research question 1) and the effectiveness of interventions in
LMICs (research question 2).

Method

Studies were included if they described any type of intervention
with a stated aim of changing mental health-related stigma or with
an implied aim of changing stigma as indicated by the inclusion of

illnesses;

at least one of the following core stigma-related outcomes: stigma
(any), prejudice (attitudes and related outcomes), discrimination,
internalised/self-stigma or public mental health awareness/literacy.
Intervention studies were included if they related to functional
mental
interventions solely about, or delivered to,
populations with dementia, substance misuse, intellectal disabilities
or developmental disorders were excluded from this review. We
included all quantitative study designs, including RCTs, controlled
and uncontrolled pre–post studies, crossover studies, cohort studies
and longitudinal panel studies. Studies with more than one inter-
vention group were included. To be eligible, studies needed to
report a comparison with a control group (including treatment
as usual, best available current treatment or an active control, to
control for non-specific effects of the intervention) or a baseline
comparator. Studies needed to include at least one stigma outcome
which we categorised as related to knowledge, attitudes (prejudice,
self- stigma, self-esteem) or behaviour (discrimination, stigma-
coping). To be eligible studies also had to address one of our two
research questions: to have at least one follow-up point at least
4 weeks after the intervention was completed (to reflect the
importance of medium- and longer-term outcomes relevant to
stigma, as this is often described by people with mental illness as
a long-term challenge); or for the intervention to be carried out
in an LMIC setting. Eligibility criteria are shown in the Appendix.

Information sources and search strategy

We identified studies by searching electronic databases, hand-
checking reference lists of reviews and consulting with experts in
the working group with knowledge of papers in press. We searched
the following databases between 25 January 2013 and 8 February
2013: Medline, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the
Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Global Health. In
addition we conducted a Google advanced search focusing on
LMICs (see Fig. 1 for details). The Google search was warranted
in the light of the limited amount of stigma research in LMICs,
but was precluded for our first research question as research from
high-income countries is more likely to be found through a
standard systematic review search. A search strategy was developed
by consensus among authors (N.M., S.C., E.B. and M.D.) using
both MeSH and text word searching. We searched using the format
‘Stigma’ OR ‘Discrimination’ OR synonyms AND ‘mental health’
OR ‘mental disorders’ OR synonyms AND ‘Intervention Studies’
OR synonyms. The full Medline search strategy is shown in online
Table DS1. The search was restricted to results between 1980 and
2013 and studies on human beings, but was not limited by
language. The decision to start the search at 1980 was a pragmatic
one based on our examination of the existing reviews which
revealed that the vast majority of stigma intervention research
commenced after 1980. Relevant non-English language papers
were read by fluent native language speakers in French and
Spanish according to the linguistic skills available to members of
the review team. Potentially relevant papers in many important
languages, including Chinese, were therefore excluded from the
review. Systematic and non-systematic reviews were identified
during the search and the reference lists of these studies were
hand-checked.

Study selection and data collection

All identified titles and abstracts were screened by two researchers.
Because of the large number of search hits, two researchers
screened 5% of abstracts together. As good agreement (495%)
the remainder were divided between the two
was achieved,

researchers and study selection conducted by one researcher for
each half. Where the researcher was unclear as to whether a paper
should be included,
the paper was discussed in consensus
meetings. Two review authors extracted data from included
studies for all parts of the systematic review, with queries resolved
by discussion and consensus.

Statistical analysis

Outcomes for the studies included were reported using both scales
and individual items, although for the effect size calculations were
restricted to scale data for knowledge and attitudes. We classified
all reported stigma outcomes into the categories of ‘knowledge’,
‘attitudes’ or ‘behaviour’. Differences between intervention group
and control group at follow-up were our main focus for the
quantitative review. Effect sizes, standardised mean differences
(SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for studies
where there were sufficient data to calculate this using the
Campbell Collaboration effect size calculator.20 We had planned
to calculate odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes but found
no study for which this was calculable. Negative SMDs indicate
a reduction in stigma (benefit), i.e. an improvement in knowledge
outcomes or a reduction in either negative attitudes or
discriminatory behaviour in the intervention group. Where more
than one outcome was reported within a category, the median
effect size was presented.21 In the online tables we present data
on the number of outcomes with statistically significant changes
in outcome and the direction of effect to complement the effect
size data of outcomes.21 These also provide some information
about all
included studies and at least some information on
effectiveness for studies that reported insufficient data to calculate
effect sizes. Owing to the considerable heterogeneity of the inter-
ventions, measures and participants in the included studies, it was
not possible to conduct meta-analyses or to use conventional
analytical methods to control for heterogeneity. As some studies
had more than one intervention, this analysis was carried out at
the intervention level with the number of participants in the
control group split between the interventions, to control for unit
of analysis error.22

We conducted two subgroup analyses on type of intervention
by calculating, presenting and comparing median effect sizes
attitude outcomes for each subgroup. The first analysis compared
direct, indirect or no social contact, and the second compared
target groups. We undertook similar sensitivity analyses to explore
the possible effects of study design and risk of bias. First, we
compared RCT evidence with non-RCT evidence, and second,
within RCTs we compared the third of studies with the least risk
of bias (see below) with the remainder.

Assessment of study quality and risk of bias

A quality assessment and profile of risk of bias within studies were
carried out individually for all included studies. Level of RCT
evidence was rated by two authors using the Cochrane risk of bias
tool.23 The third of RCTs with the lowest risk of bias are identified
with an asterisk in the data extraction tables. To assess bias in
non-randomised studies
conducted quality
appraisals using risk of bias criteria for non-randomised studies,23
suitable to the wide range of study designs included. When a
decision about the risk of bias could not be made, it was resolved
through discussion with a third author. In addition, for each study
we indicated whether at least one outcome measure was validated,
whether it was previously published, developed by the author or if
items were used. Scales were marked as having evidence of psycho-
metric adequacy providing they met one or more of the following

criteria: the authors reported a Cronbach’s a of 0.7 or greater, the
authors referenced the measure as being reliable or valid, or there was
some evidence of validity or reliability as judged by the review team.

Results

A total of 80 quantitative studies (422 653 participants) were
identified for inclusion in the review, 72 addressing research
question 1 (long-term effectiveness) and 11 addressing research
question 2 (setting), of which 3 studies addressed both questions
(Fig. 1). The database search provided 27 876 citations. After a
review of the abstracts 26 563 papers were excluded as they were
clearly irrelevant or did not meet the inclusion criteria. The
reference lists of 17 reviews were hand-checked and 49 further
papers identified. Seven papers in press known to the authors were
included. After removal of 330 duplicates the full text of the
remaining 1061 potentially relevant papers was sought. Of these,
21 papers were unobtainable and 843 papers did not meet the
inclusion criteria. Of the remaining papers 17 did not contain
enough relevant data to extract. A full reference list is given in
online Table DS2 and study characteristics are listed in online
Tables DS3–5. Online Tables DS6 and DS7 give risk of bias and
quality ratings for RCTs and other studies respectively.

Medium- and long-term follow-up

Study characteristics

Most of the studies addressing medium- or long-term outcomes
took place in high-income countries (93%), were aimed at school
or university students (37%) and used interventions comprising
mental health education and literacy or mental health information
(43%). About a quarter (28%) of the studies included were RCTs,
52% consisted of pre–post studies with or without a control group
and 21% were longitudinal panel or cohort studies. Most studies
(69%) had a final follow-up assessment 1–6 months after the
intervention had ended, whereas 21% had a longer follow-up
(1–10 years post-intervention). Tables DS3 and DS4 show details
of study characteristics.

Evidence

There were 72 quantitative studies with at least 4 weeks of
follow-up, which included 81
interventions with 42 653
participants. It was possible to calculate effect sizes and confidence
intervals for 21 of these studies (23 interventions). These studies
and their effect sizes are shown in Table 1. Findings based on
statistical significance for all included studies are shown in Tables

DS3 (RCT, controlled and uncontrolled pre–post studies) and DS4
(longitudinal panel study or cohort design). For knowledge outcomes
the median effect size was 0.54 indicating a medium effect in
increasing knowledge.19 For attitude outcomes SMDs ranged from
0.05 to 71.22 with a median effect size of 70.26, indicating a small
reduction in stigmatising attitudes. For behavioural outcomes
SMDs were calculated in one intervention which showed a small
(SMD = 0.22) effect in reducing stigmatising behaviour. Inspection
of the pattern of significance findings for scales for all the included
studies with medium- or long-term follow-up indicated that there
were similar numbers of significant and non-significant findings
indicating an increase in knowledge (26 v. 22). Similar numbers
were also found for attitude scales (63 non-significant findings v.
52 significant in the direction of stigma reduction). Five scales had
significant findings indicating an increase in stigma. For behavioural
outcomes measured with scales, non-significant
findings out-
numbered significant ones indicating a reduction in discriminatory
behaviour (12 v. 2) and this was also the case for behavioural
outcomes measured at the item level (38 v. 19).

Our subgroup analysis of type of intervention found that
interventions containing direct social contact had a smaller
median effect size for stigmatising attitudes (70.17) than those
social contact (70.32) or no social contact
with indirect
(70.33). There were enough interventions with effect sizes to
make comparisons of median effect sizes by three types of target
group, and we found that
interventions targeted at health
professionals had a somewhat higher median effect size (70.41) than
those targeting school pupils (70.21) or university students (70.13).

Risk of bias

Across all RCTs there was a low risk of bias for 50% of the criteria
and an unclear or high risk of bias in the other 50%. Only five
trials met 70% or more of the criteria. Nine trials met between
40% and 60% of the criteria and five only met 15–30%. In light
of the nature of anti-stigma interventions it was not possible to
mask participants and personnel to allocation, with the exception
of one trial which was internet-based and thus easier to conceal.24
Of the 19 trials, 17 used at least one validated scale to measure
outcomes, whereas 2 used non-validated scales that had been used
in previously published papers. There were 53 non-randomised
studies, 30 of which did not have a control group. Among studies
with a control group, 6 were deemed to have a low risk of selection
bias with regard to the comparability between the intervention
and control groups. In 26 studies there was a high risk of attrition
bias, where more than 20% of the sample were lost to follow-up
and no intention to treat analysis was carried out. Possible
confounders were considered and controlled for in only 28% of
studies. As with the RCTs, masking of participants and personnel
was not possible owing to the type of
intervention. Among
non-randomised studies, 24 had at least one validated outcome
measure, 2 had at least one that was previously published, 4 had
one that was specifically developed for the study with no
psychometric testing reported, and 23 used items only. Details
of risk of bias in individual studies are given in Tables DS5 and
DS6. The median effect size for RCTs was lower than for non-
randomised controlled studies (70.17 v. 70.37). Within RCTs
the third with the least risk of bias had a higher effect size
(70.30) than the remainder (70.09).

Evidence from LMICs

There were 11 studies (1967 participants) from LMIC settings, 8
with less than a 4-week follow-up and 3 with longer follow-up.
Study characteristics and statistical significance findings for these

380

https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.114.151944 Published online by Cambridge University Press

are shown in Table DS5. Eight of these were from upper middle-
income countries and three were from lower middle-income
countries. There was no study meeting our criteria from a low-
income country. Six studies were aimed at school and university
students, two at caregivers of people with schizophrenia, and three
at healthcare professionals. Three studies used an RCT design, one
of which was a cluster randomised trial analysed within groups,
two were controlled studies and six were uncontrolled pre–post
studies. Within the 11 studies included there were 16 intervention
arms, with 5 measuring knowledge outcomes and 14 measuring
attitude outcomes. None of the studies had behavioural outcomes.
Sufficient data to calculate an effect size were reported in only one
of the studies;25 in this study – a psychoeducation programme for
caregivers of patients with schizophrenia in Chile – the SMD for
stigmatising attitudes was 72.11 (95% CI 72.87 to 71.34),
indicating a large effect. Inspection of the statistical significance
of the knowledge scale findings for all studies revealed that both
studies with such outcomes found no evidence of change;
however, there were findings indicating a significant reduction
in stigmatising attitudes for 11 of the 12 attitude scale outcomes
assessed in these studies (Table DS5).

These results should be interpreted with caution. In seven of
the studies, follow-up assessments were undertaken immediately
after the intervention (in one study this was done 1 week after
the intervention had ended). There were also issues regarding bias:
owing to a lack of information in the papers it was generally
difficult to gauge the extent of risk of bias. For the three RCTs,
in 52% of criteria the risk of bias was unclear. Where information
was provided, a high risk of bias was found in 19% of criteria
across the RCTs, whereas in 29% of criteria the risk was low. This
was most common for the incomplete outcome data and selective
outcome reporting criteria. For the non-randomised studies, risk
of bias varied across criteria, with 33% classified as high and
33% as low, and for 33% the degree of risk was unclear.

Behavioural outcomes

Among the 15 studies that did report behavioural outcomes, 7
assessed contact with someone with a mental health problem, 4
measured perceived discrimination and coping strategies
in
participants who had a mental health problem, 2 measured
changes in school and workplace policies regarding mental
health,26,27 2 measured experienced discrimination reported by
people with mental health problems,28,29 and only 1 measured
actual discriminatory behaviour by participants in the general
population.30

Discussion

Our synthesis of 72 studies with follow-up beyond 4 weeks
revealed that, at this follow-up, interventions aimed at reducing
mental health-related stigma typically had a medium-sized effect
on knowledge outcomes and a small effect on attitudinal
outcomes, although for both types of outcome statistically non-
significant findings were as common as significant ones. There
were insufficient data on behavioural outcomes to draw any
conclusions on the medium- or long-term effectiveness of inter-
ventions to reduce discrimination. This is the first systematic
review to synthesise evidence on medium- and long-term
stigma is often
effectiveness, which is
experienced by people with mental illness as a long-term difficulty.
Although a number of systematic reviews indicated that social
contact
the
majority of
in these reviews had only short-term
follow-up. Our review, restricted to studies with medium- and

interventions were particularly effective,11,13,15,16

longer-term outcomes, did not support the superiority of social
contact interventions as we had expected. As it is vital that stigma
reduction is sustained in the longer term, the effectiveness of such
social contact interventions clearly warrants further research.

Study quality was variable, and indeed study design and
quality did appear to affect median effect sizes, although these
subgroup and sensitivity analysis findings should be interpreted
with caution owing to the heterogeneity of the studies. Overall,
where we did identify positive changes from the interventions,
the magnitude of the effects was generally rather modest. It is
also clear that there is therefore a lack of research on actual
discriminatory behaviour within the stigma research field.

For our second research question regarding LMICs, we found
comparatively few studies from middle-income countries and
none from low-income countries. A large effect size was found
for the one LMIC study for which there were sufficient data to
calculate the effect size and the majority of attitude scale outcomes
indicated significant improvements in attitudes, although such
findings must be treated with considerable caution. There is a
clear need for more stigma reduction studies, particularly from
low-income countries.

Our results regarding service user social contact are consistent
with those of Griffiths et al,31 who recently published a meta-
analysis of RCTs of interventions intended to reduce stigma.
Analysing data from 26 trials they found that
interventions
targeting personal stigma or social distance yielded small but
significant reductions in stigma across all mental disorders.

effective in reducing personal stigma, as were interventions
incorporating service user contact. This study also considered
internet use and self-stigma and found that internet programmes
were at least as effective in reducing personal stigma as face-to-
face delivery (see also Clement et al).32 They found no evidence
that stigma interventions were effective in reducing self-stigma.
In our review, although social contact appears to be the most
strongly evidence-based type of intervention to reduce stigma
when measured by immediate post-intervention outcomes, there
is not at present evidence to show that such immediate benefits
persist in the longer term.

relevant

In conducting a
This review has a number of
comprehensive overview of all
literature we have
identified considerable heterogeneity among participant groups,
interventions and outcomes. For example, we identified 55
different scales used for the 136 outcomes measured. Study quality
also varied considerably. We were able to include studies in some
non-English languages, but it is possible that we missed important
projects published in other languages, for example potentially
important studies not available at all in English, or studies for
which only abstracts were available in English, and which we were
not able to assess fully (see, for example, Shi et al).33 The temporal
limitation of the search start date being 1980 will have resulted in
the review missing studies before that date. We also need to
acknowledge the possibility of publication bias, for example that
intervention studies showing no difference might be published less
often than those that do identify a clear benefit. Further, the risk
of bias results given above, with half of all studies having a high or
unknown risk of bias, mean that considerable caution needs to be
exercised in interpreting these findings. It is also notable that
relatively few of the interventions assessed following published,
manualised procedures or including any rating of treatment fidelity.
It should also be appreciated that although a narrative review may
be able to disaggregate the nature of the interventions, and the specific
target groups, into a greater number of specific subtypes, the numbers

382

of studies in each of these categories would be small, and that this
would give a greater descriptive richness at the expense of the wider
generalisability of the findings. The systematic review method used
here does not allow this narrower focus.

Challenges in the measurement of stigma

for

such as people

The assessment and validation of instruments to measure stigma
and discrimination against people with mental illness has been
under way since the 1960s. Although early measures such as the
Opinions About Mental Illness and the Community Attitudes to
Mental Illness scales are still used in some studies,34,35 there have
been many developments in the breadth and quantity of measures
to assess stigma in recent years. These include a trend to
incorporate multiple outcomes or domains,
example
knowledge and behaviour as well as attitudes; techniques to
control for social desirability bias such as implicit measures;
research on coping or ‘stigma resilience’; and assessments among
multiply stigmatised groups,
from ethnic
minorities with mental illness. Despite these developments there
are still substantial gaps in what can be assessed using available
measures,
including a lack of behavioural and structural
indicators. We have seen in this review that behaviour is under-
represented in stigma intervention outcomes, for example changes
in behaviour of others rated by patients or service users, or directly
observed discrimination-related outcomes. There is a further gap
in terms of important subgroups. For example, Link et al noted
that children and adolescents were represented in only 3.7% of
stigma studies.36 More specific and tailored measures might
facilitate inclusion of specific subpopulations in stigma research,
such as those already affected by discrimination on the grounds
of (for example) ethnicity. Additionally, studies that
include
measures validated in LMICs are rare, and only a few include
any intervention component developed specifically in such
countries. Future efforts should therefore address these gaps,
because measurement and evaluation are critical to understanding
the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of anti-stigma
interventions. A further challenge is to stop the use of unvalidated
measures and item level analyses, while retaining enough
flexibility to promote conceptual, contextual and theoretical
relevance.

Gaps in the evidence base

users

service

reporting

This review has highlighted clear gaps in the field of anti-stigma
interventions and research methods and a need for
the
harmonisation of outcomes in this field of research. These include
the paucity of evidence on discrimination outcomes, or on
reducing negative behaviours or increasing positive behaviours
towards people with mental illness,37 and the lack of studies of
specific target groups such as employers or family members,
despite
experiencing
commonly
discrimination from both of these groups.38 There is an important
need to assess whether benefits identified in the short term are
maintained in the longer term, and if any booster interventions
are needed to achieve sustainability. This review has also shown
a relatively narrow focus of work to date: either on the general
population (in attitude surveys) or on students within settings
accessible to researchers (e.g. universities and colleges).16 From a
global health viewpoint there is a distinct lack of interventional
research in LMICs, despite emerging evidence of the scale and
severity of the challenges posed by stigma and discrimination,
and despite the fact that 85% of the world’s population live in
such countries.39,40 Finally, there is a need for more studies using
high-quality research designs. Only a third of studies included in
this paper used an RCT or other robust study design, and many of
these had a high risk of bias.

Interventions for reducing stigma

Future research

Knowledge in this field is generally from small studies of poor
methodological quality, using inconsistent outcomes scales, and
in particular few strong RCTs or interrupted time series studies
have been carried out to test interventions intended to reduce
stigma and discrimination. Our summary of previous systematic
reviews does tend to support the view that social contact is the
more effective type of intervention known to reduce stigma, at
least in the short term.41 We do not yet have even weak consistent
evidence to support interventions for target groups identified as
priorities by service user groups, such as family members, and
only an embryonic evidence base concerning how to address
stigma in healthcare staff.42 Indeed, this degree of evidential
neglect could itself be seen as a manifestation of structural
discrimination. Given the magnitude of the challenges posed by
stigma and discrimination, it is clear that there needs to be a
commensurate concerted effort to fund methodologically strong
research to provide robust evidence to support policy decisions
on investment and interventions. Such a wider policy framework
is now emerging.43 The World Health Organization Mental Health
Action Plan, ratified by the World Health Assembly in May 2013,
states as its vision:

‘A world in which mental health is valued, promoted and protected, mental disorders
are prevented and persons affected by these disorders are able to exercise the full
range of human rights and to access high quality, culturally-appropriate health and
social care in a timely way to promote recovery, in order to attain the highest possible
level of health and participate fully in society and at work, free from stigmatization and
discrimination.’44

Specifically, paragraph 75 of the Action Plan indicates a need to
prioritise:

‘Mental health promotion and prevention: provide technical support to countries on
the selection, formulation and implementation of evidence-based and cost-effective
best practices for promoting mental health, preventing mental disorders, reducing
stigmatization and discrimination, and promoting human rights across the lifespan.’44

This review indicates that an early necessity is to conduct more
high-quality research to allow this policy priority to be firmly
evidence-based, especially within LMICs.
