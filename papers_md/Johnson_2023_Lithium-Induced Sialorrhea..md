Abstract
Lithium is a mood stabilizer frequently used in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder. Because lithium has a
narrow therapeutic index, it requires frequent monitoring for its toxicity. Lithium toxicity requires
monitoring of serum lithium and clinical assessment by clinicians. Sialorrhea, also known as excessive
drooling, hypersalivation, or ptyalism, is common among psychiatric patients. Sialorrhea, an infrequent and
embarrassing side effect of lithium, has been reported at varying serum levels, either at subtherapeutic or in
the normal range. Here, we present the case of a patient with sialorrhea associated with oral lithium therapy
at the subtherapeutic serum level.

Introduction
Lithium is a commonly used mood stabilizer for treating bipolar disorder  [1]. This psychotropic agent has
been studied extensively since its introduction in psychiatry for over 60 years. Lithium is effective in the
management of acute manic and depressive episodes, as well as in decreasing the recurrence of mood
episodes and reducing the risk of suicidal behaviors [1,2]. The mechanisms by which lithium exerts its
therapeutic effects are still not fully understood [3,4]. Lithium exerts its neuroprotective effects at the
cellular level by inhibiting two enzymatic pathways, namely, inositol mono-phosphatase (IMPase) within
the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway only when they are in excess, and, second, the G-coupled
receptor pathway via inhibition of protein kinase C-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PKC-GSK3) and its
downstream target, myristoylated alanine-rich C (MARCKS), thus deriving its antimanic effects [1,4,5]. It
also decreases excitatory neurotransmission at the cellular level by modulating neurotransmitter (dopamine
and glutamate) levels [2]. It increases inhibitory transmission by increasing GABA and serotonin levels [6].
Lithium also downregulates N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [7]. It is excreted almost entirely (95%)
by the kidney, with only a tiny amount lost with feces and sweat [8].

Common side effects of lithium treatment include dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Upon
initiation of treatment, patients have also complained of tremors, weight gain, increased thirst, polyuria,
and acne [3].

Sialorrhea, also known as excessive drooling, hypersalivation, or ptyalism, is common among psychiatric
patients [9]. It has been implicated as a side effect of many psychotropic agents, for example, clozapine and
olanzapine [9]. Other pathologies that can contribute to this phenomenon include postural dysfunction,
saliva hypersecretion, dental malocclusion, and salivary spill recognition, especially in patients with
neurologic illnesses [10]. Lithium-induced side effects may cause a range of physical and psychosocial
complications. Examples include social stigmatization, perioral chapping, aspiration, dehydration, skin
breakdown, bad odor, and infection, distressing patients and their families and negatively influencing their
quality of life [11]. For the patient with an intact sensory awareness of saliva, it can present with significant
embarrassment and isolation, leading to social stigma [12]. Regular evacuation or occult drooling into a
tissue or spit cup is socially embarrassing and debilitating, resulting in isolation, social stigma, and low self-
esteem [12]. Hypersalivation is a rare side effect of lithium. There is no widely reported literature on
sialorrhea related to lithium use.

Case Presentation
A 29-year-old female of South Korean descent, single, unemployed, supported by welfare, domiciled, had
past psychiatric histories of bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, but no significant past
medical history. The patient was brought to the psychiatry emergency department (ED) by the emergency
medical services (EMS) activated by her brother due to disorganized and aggressive behavior in the context
of medication non-compliance.

On assessment in the ED, the patient was floridly manic. She reported a euphoric mood, sleeping only two to
three hours per night over the past three days leading to her presentation.

She reported spending a lot of money recently on items she did not need. She endorsed an erotomanic
delusion of being in love with a South Korean male model on Instagram with whom she communicated
telepathically. Her speech was rapid and pressured. She was hyperactive and pacing the emergency room.
The patient had five previous hospitalizations for manic episodes since 2016, with the most recent
hospitalization a few months before the current presentation. Past medication trials included lithium,
aripiprazole, and lumateperone. She was not compliant with her prescribed medications and outpatient
follow-up appointments. The patient had poor insight, poor judgment, and poor impulse control. She was
judged a danger to herself and others at the time and was deemed not to be psychiatrically stable, requiring
acute inpatient hospitalization for stabilization.

During her medical workup, the patient complained of a mild cough and tested positive for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) but was otherwise asymptomatic. She was transferred to the medical floor for
monitoring of her symptoms and medical stabilization. Her vital signs were stable, and her oxygen
saturation was 98% on room air. Complete metabolic panel and other laboratory tests were within the
normal range. Chest X-ray was normal, electrocardiography showed no abnormalities, and her baseline
lithium level was in the subtherapeutic range at <0.3 mEq/L (normal serum level = 0.6-1.2 mEq/L).

The infectious disease team was consulted, and they started her on a five-day course of Paxlovid for COVID-
19 treatment. She was started on an oral dose of 300 mg lithium twice daily for mood stabilization and 3 mg
of oral melatonin for insomnia.

While on the medical floor, the patient was followed up by the consultation and liaison psychiatric team,
which recommended continuation of lithium at 300 mg twice daily oral dose for mood stabilization,
clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily oral dose for anxiety, and 50 mg of oral diphenhydramine at night as needed
for insomnia.

Her repeat COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was negative, but her serum sodium level on day five
was 132, which was repleted. The patient was deemed medically stable on day nine, and the consultation
and liaison team recommended up-titration from 300 mg oral lithium twice daily to 300 mg thrice daily. Her
lithium level measured after five days was still subtherapeutic at 0.3 mEq/L (normal serum level = 0.6-1.2
mEq/L).

The patient was transferred to the psychiatry unit on day 10. On arrival at the psychiatric unit, the patient
reported excessive drooling and tremors. The oral examination was unremarkable. The patient had no sores
on the side of the oral cavities indicative of angular cheilitis and no gastric reflux or ulcer symptoms. The
patient denied ever having sialorrhea, either from antipsychotics or lithium use. The patient was educated
on the possible cause of her sialorrhea and treatment options. The patient was given psycho-education
regarding possible treatment options for sialorrhea, including discontinuation of lithium. The patient
verbalized understanding and agreed to it.

The patient was treated with 0.1 mg glycopyrrolate intramuscular injection once. Excessive salivation
decreased following treatment, but an oral glycopyrrolate tablet of 1 mg daily was continued for eight days
to prevent repeat sialorrhea. The patient was started on benztropine 1 mg per oral twice daily for
extrapyramidal symptoms.

Lithium was discontinued on day 12 according to the preference of the psychiatrist, and the extrapyramidal
symptoms began to resolve a few days following the discontinuation of the lithium. There was an eventual
complete resolution of symptoms. The patient was then started on quetiapine 25 mg oral dose at bedtime
and oxcarbazepine 300 mg orally twice daily for mood stabilization. There was a good resolution of her
manic symptoms, but the erotomanic delusions continued. She was discharged after 14 days in patient
management with an aftercare appointment for outpatient follow-up.

Discussion
Sialorrhea can occur not only at toxic serum levels (1.5 mEq/L and above) but also below toxic serum levels
[5,13,14]. Our case report highlights sialorrhea occurring at a serum level of <0.3 mEq/L, below the
therapeutic range (therapeutic range = 0.6-1.2 mEq/L) and toxic serum level (1.5 mEq/L and above). Other
studies have highlighted sialorrhea occurring at serum levels of 0.85 mEq/L [14] and 0.9 mEq/L [5]. In both
cases, the levels were below the serum level of lithium toxicity [5,14]. Hence, clinicians should be clinically
vigilant of this side effect.

Sialorrhea, a rare side effect of lithium, has been reported at various time courses of lithium therapy. In the
case report by Halder et al. [10], sialorrhea began after one month of therapy initiation. In the case report by
Bou Khalil et al. [5], it occurred within three days of lithium therapy initiation. In the case report by
Donaldson [14], sialorrhea occurred 10 days after the therapy initiation. In our case report, sialorrhea
occurred after 10 days of lithium therapy initiation, which is similar to the case report by Donaldson [14].
These reports signify that the duration between initiating lithium therapy and sialorrhea initiation does not
follow a regular time interval pattern.

Reports suggest that lithium levels in the serum are directly related to the severity of hypersalivation, i.e.,
the quantity or volume of hypersalivation increases with serum levels [15]. Lithium levels affect the
catecholamine metabolism in the central nervous system but have no effects on the peripheral nervous
system [15,16]. Another postulation is the direct effect of lithium on salivary gland secretion  [15]. The
secretion of lithium ions into the saliva causes constant, localized irritation [15,16], triggers the central
chemoreceptors in the emetic zone, and produces a transient rise in urinary aldosterone [15].

Drooling can be caused by an increased salivary flow that is not compensated for by swallowing or impaired
swallowing that cannot handle the reduced or normal salivation. Our patient’s physical examination did not
reveal intractable, localized irritation, she never complained of nausea or dysgeusia, and she had no other
signs of lithium toxicity. Therefore, organic causes of hypersalivation and lithium toxicity were ruled out, as
our patient’s lithium level was below the toxic serum range.

In previous case reports, the addition of anticholinergic medications caused a reduction in sialorrhea  [10,15],
and a reduction in the lithium dose resulted in the remission of hypersalivation [13]. In another report,
stopping lithium therapy was necessary to achieve remission of excessive salivation [5]. In our case, similar
to that reported by Donaldson [14], adding an anticholinergic agent in 1 mg of glycopyrrolate provided
symptomatic relief and did not result in the return of symptoms. However, stopping lithium therapy was
clinically imperative to achieve remission.

Conclusions
Sialorrhea resulting from lithium therapy is rare. It is an embarrassing side effect that negatively affects
social, occupational, and personal functioning. This can negatively affect the patient’s self-esteem and lead
to social isolation and medication non-compliance. Clinicians should be vigilant to recognize this rare but
significant side effect of lithium therapy. At the presentation of a patient with sialorrhea, clinicians should
review the patient’s serum lithium levels and monitor for other signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity.
There are reported cases where the serum lithium was subtherapeutic, within normal range, and might or
might not be associated with clinical signs of lithium toxicity. However, clinicians should be aware that
while presenting with hypersalivation, the patient’s serum levels may be below, within normal, or in the
toxic range. Consequently, treatment should be planned accordingly. Both dose reduction and the addition
of anticholinergic agents can significantly improve sialorrhea induced by lithium therapy.
