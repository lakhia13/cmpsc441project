Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a therapy that involves tightening and relaxing muscle groups in a specific pattern, one at a time.

One way to relieve muscle tension is to do progressive muscle relaxation, also known asJacobson’s relaxation technique.

Let’s get into what PMR is, what the benefits are, and how to do this technique.


## What is progressive muscle relaxation?


American physician Edmund Jacobson created PMR in the 1920s. It was based on the theory that physical relaxation can promote mental relaxation.

Jacobson discovered that you can relax a muscle by tensing and then releasing it, and doing so can also relax the mind.

PMR provides a framework for achieving this state of relaxation. It requires you to work on one muscle group at a time, allowing you to notice the tension in that specific area.

It’s also essential to tense each muscle groupbeforerelaxing. This action emphasizes the area’s sense of relaxation.


## What are the benefits?


There is plenty of evidence behind PMR’s health benefits. Let’s take a closer look at what research has discovered about this technique.


### Reduces anxiety and tension


Anxietyrelief is one of themajor benefitsof PMR. This includes generalized anxiety disorder or anxiety due to a stressful situation.

Because PMR induces relaxation, it may also help you get better sleep.

In a2020 study, researchers tested PMR on 80 burn patients. These patients often experience high anxiety and poor sleep quality due to their physical and psychological conditions.

The patients were divided into two groups. One group did PMR for 20 to 30 minutes a day, 3 days in a row. The other group just received routine care and treatment.

After 3 days, the researchers determined that the patients who did PMR showed a significant decrease in anxiety and an improvement in sleep quality compared to the group who only received routine care.

PMR is an easy technique to do at home. You don’t need any special equipment or gear. All you need is focus, attention, and a quiet spot where you won’t be distracted.
