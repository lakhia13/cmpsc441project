Abstract
Workers’ compensation systems aim to ﬁnancially support injured workers. However, seeking compensation often leads to
poorer physical and mental health outcomes. This review examines previous studies to investigate the relationship between
workers’ compensation and mental health and self-harm outcomes. A three-tiered search strategy across ﬁve databases iden-
tiﬁed studies that examined workers’ compensation claims as an exposure or risk factor, with outcomes related to mental
health, self-harm and suicidality. Nine full-text studies were included; however, heterogeneity limited generalizability.
Most studies supported an association between pursuing compensation and poorer mental health and self-harm outcomes.
Some studies attributed this to speciﬁc aspects of the system such as justice perception and navigation of the claims system.
Findings suggest an association between workers’ compensation and mental health or self-harm outcomes. Inconclusive ﬁnd-
ings highlight the need for further research. Understanding the psychiatric impacts of pursuing compensation is crucial to help
formulate a more accessible compensation system.

Introduction

According to the International Labour Organisation, an occu-
pational injury is ‘any personal injury, disease or death result-
ing from an occupational accident’ and the accident must have
been ‘unexpected and unplanned’.1 In Australia, between
2012 and 2013, over 500,000 individuals were injured at
work, at a direct and indirect cost to the economy of over
$60 billion.2 In the United States, in 2019, the incidence rate
for recordable occupational injuries was 2.8 cases per 100 full-
time equivalent workers. In 2021, occupational injuries in the
United States resulted in a total cost of $167 billion.3,4 In 2020,
injuries across
a reported total of 253,397 occupational
Canadian provinces required injured workers to take time off
from work.5

For individual workers, occupational injuries are associ-
ated with substantial ﬁnancial burdens affecting many
domains of their lives. An injury acquired in the workplace
can impair one’s ability to work, subsequently limiting the
duties that can be completed or taking them out of occupa-
tion. Some workers also develop permanent disability, hin-
dering their return to work.6

Work-related injuries often have ramiﬁcations extending
far beyond the immediate injury to the affected worker.

experiencing delays in receiving of payments,10 often result-
ing in them needing to pay out of pocket for injury-related
medical expenses.11

NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy 34(2)

Many countries have injury compensation systems that
enable eligible individuals to claim monetary beneﬁts follow-
ing an occupational injury. Such compensation schemes have
been designed to help facilitate and optimise recovery and
rehabilitation of injured workers, assisting return to work;
this is partially achieved by covering medical costs and pro-
viding income replacement. In some countries, compensation
systems distinguish between injuries resulting in time off
work (i.e. ‘lost time’) and injuries that have not required
taking time off work thus not eligible for wage replacements
(also known as ‘medical only’ claims). There are also signif-
icant variations in payments, assessment processes, eligibil-
ity criteria, duration of claim and duration of injury before
there are some differences
one is eligible. In Australia,
across the various schemes for different states and territories;
however, under one of the major schemes, Work Cover in
Victoria, injured workers are able to make claims for time
off work as well as any treatment-associated costs.12

Despite the well-intended aims of compensation systems,
studies have demonstrated that pursuing injury compensation
can have detrimental impacts on workers’ physical health.13
These include poorer recovery outcomes and reduced pain
tolerance among compensation claimants, compared to
those not making claims.14,15 This may particularly be the
case for individuals who have a greater vulnerability to expe-
riencing stress.16 While no-fault compensation systems are
generally associated with better health outcomes,17 individu-
als may still ﬁnd the process stressful.

Despite indications that workers’ compensation systems
may be associated with worse outcomes among claimants,
signiﬁcant knowledge gaps persist. While the impacts of
compensation on physical health outcomes are well under-
stood, the effects on mental health outcomes are less clear.
For instance, it has been widely acknowledged that many
injured workers experience a deterioration in their mental
health after an occupational injury,18 with depression and
post-traumatic stress being commonly well-documented
long-term mental health sequelae.19 There is evidence of
increased levels of depression among workers who have
experienced an occupational injury, compared to those not
injured20 or injured outside of work.21 Some studies have
also found that individuals who have experienced an occupa-
tional injury feel more anxious,22 particularly those receiving
compensation.15 Some claimants have also reported ﬁnding
the compensation process to be quite stressful16 and associa-
tions between injured workers pursuing compensation and
suicide have also been posited.23,24 Despite these ﬁndings,
it is often difﬁcult to assess the extent to which the decline
in workers’ mental health is related to the injury itself, or
the compensation process.

Claimants’ psychological distress or poorer mental health
have been linked to various aspects of the compensation
system.25 These include stigmatisation, lack of social sup-
ports, the presence of a power imbalance between workers
and compensation schemes, procedural processes entailing

extensive use of jargon and legal terminology and poor
communication.26

It has been suggested that engagement with the compensa-
tion system is not conducive to injured workers’ recovery
process and may in fact be damaging to recovery.27
Impacts on the recovery process have been observed for
both physical and mental health injuries. Furthermore, it
has been documented that pursuing workers’ compensation
claims can inﬂuence an individual’s return to work and
their ability to effectively perform their work duties.28
There is also some evidence that workers’ compensation
claimants may be at greater risk of hospitalisation due to self-
harm than the general population.25

The speciﬁc populations under investigation have varied
considerably between studies, due to using different combi-
nations of comparison groups. This has created difﬁculty in
making overall assessments about
to which
workers’ compensation causes deleterious mental health out-
comes among claimants. Elucidating this relationship is vital;
such research is necessary to help make relevant adjustments
to the claims process, allowing for easier navigation and this
may help in alleviating claimants’ mental health problems.

This Study

No study has previously reviewed and synthesised associa-
tions between workers’ compensation schemes and mental
health outcomes. This narrative review aimed to review
and synthesise previous studies examining the association
between workers’ compensation and mental health and self-
harm outcomes.

Methods

This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA),29 as
seen in Figure 1.

The review was registered with Prospero (registration

number CRD42021274899).

Search Strategy

This narrative review incorporated a systematic search, utilis-
ing the following online databases: PubMed, MEDLINE,
PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus. The databases
were searched during August 2021. This search was
updated on 8 September 2022.

A tiered search strategy was used, covering three main
topics: workers’ compensation systems, employment and
mental health outcomes. For the ﬁrst tier, keywords related
to workers compensation were used (e.g. ‘injury compensa-
tion’,
the
second tier, common search terms related to employment
(e.g. ‘employ*’, ‘occupation’) were used. Keywords related
to mental health and self-harm were included for the third

‘workers compensation’,

‘work cover’). For

of studies for review. Two reviewers (SW and YT) indepen-
dently screened titles and abstracts; any disagreements were
resolved by a third reviewer (TK). After this, a full-text
screen was done independently by two reviewers (SW and
TK), identifying articles for inclusion.

to suicidality; these could be either primary or secondary out-
comes. Studies must have been conducted among individuals
employed at time of injury.

Articles were not restricted based on country of publica-
tion or language of study. Studies were included regardless
of whether claimants’ injuries resulted in time off work or
were medical only; studies were also included even if this
distinction had not been clearly mentioned.

Exclusion Criteria

Articles were excluded if they were not of quantitative study
design or lacked quantitative data; this included case reports,
descriptive works, reviews or study protocols. To ensure tem-
poral relevance of studies, inclusion was restricted to studies
conducted after 1990.

Given the focus on understanding associations between
the workers’ compensation process and mental health out-
comes, studies where the precipitating injury was work-
related stress or work-induced mental health were excluded.
We therefore excluded studies focusing on the following:

- Investigation of compensations related to injuries acquired
outside the workplace (e.g. medical negligence or malprac-
tice, trafﬁc accidents)
- Claims for malingering or feigning claims
- Predictors of whether one would later apply for injury
compensation
- How companies or courts decide whether an injury is claim-
able or not
- Solely looking at the impact of pursuing injury compensa-
tion on physical health outcomes (e.g. injury healing or
requiring procedures), without obvious consideration of
mental health outcomes

Data Extraction and Analysis

extracted included:
location and time period of study,
authors’ names, sample description, study design used, deﬁ-
nitions for exposure and outcome and the effect estimates.
Data extraction was checked for accuracy between reviewers.

Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale.16 This tool assesses the quality of non-randomised
studies (the focus of this review). Each study was evaluated
across eight Risk of Bias items in three broad domains per-
taining to: participant
the
groups, and ascertainment, measurement of the exposure
and outcome. Using a star system, a ﬁnal score was given
to each study (with a maximum possible score of 9 points).
A lower Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score indicates poorer
study assessment.

identiﬁed (see Table 2). After removing duplicates, 4910
remained for title and abstract screening. Excluding studies
not meeting inclusion criteria narrowed the studies to 74.
Full-text review of these studies resulted in seven studies
included for review. Reasons for excluding all but seven
papers were that the others were not quantitative studies or
otherwise did not meet the inclusion criteria as outlined in
the methods section. No further studies were included for
review from the updated search. There was great heterogene-
ity in the comparators across the included studies in this
review;
the comparators included injured workers who
solely received medical compensation, workers involved in
litigation, workers not receiving any ﬁnancial compensation
or not making a claim through the compensation system and
individuals without work-related injuries or sustaining inju-
ries external to the workplace.

Study Characteristics
Of the seven studies included, ﬁve were from the United
States and two from Australia, as shown in Table 2. Six
studies were cross-sectional and one was longitudinal.
Regarding outcomes, ﬁve studies were related to mental
health and two were related to suicidality.

Various sampling techniques were used to recruit study pop-
ulations, including the use of registries and convenience sam-
pling. All studies were conducted between 2001 and 2021.

Risk of Bias Assessment

Supplementary Material S2 presents the item-level and
study-level Risk of Bias assessment. Using Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale,30 the included studies varied in quality,
with ranked scores ranging from two to nine. Two studies
received a score of nine.21,23 For ascertainment of the expo-
sure, all studies were considered to be at low risk of bias.
Representativeness of the exposed cohort and the selection of
the non-exposed were considered acceptable for six studies.
Most studies were at higher risk of bias on items regarding
outcomes (determined by assessing adequacy of follow-up
and robustness of assessing outcomes). Eight studies were
judged to have acceptable comparability of cohorts.

Qualitative Synthesis

Two studies
reported outcomes related to suicidality;
this included suicidal ideation, having a suicide plan and
attempted suicide.

Applebaum23 investigated mortality from various causes
among workers incurring lost-time injuries and acquiring ben-
eﬁts alongside workers’ compensation, compared to workers
only receiving workers’ compensation. They reported that
experiencing a lost-time injury was associated with an
increased risk of suicide for both men (HR = 1.73; 95%CI
1.23–2.40) and women (HR = 1.92; 95%CI 1.21–3.06).

Fishbain31 compared suicidality in patients with workers’
compensation undergoing a period of rehabilitation in a facil-
ity or those undergoing litigation, in comparison to healthy
community non-patients (in this study, the healthy, pain-free
controls). Rehabilitation patients receiving workers’ compen-
sation had a greater risk of suicidal intent (RR = 2.64; 95%CI
1.60–4.34) were more likely to have a suicide plan (RR =
5.95; 95%CI 3.42–10.30) and more likely to have previously
attempted suicide (RR = 2.88; 95%CI 2.07–4.00) compared
to community non-patients.

For rehabilitation patients undergoing litigation, the risks
of suicidal intent (RR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.14–5.74), having a
suicide plan (RR = 6.37; 95%CI 3.56–11.34) and previous
suicide attempt (RR = 3.29; 95%CI 2.34–4.63) were all
higher than for healthy community non-patients.

Furthermore, among community patients risks for suicidal
intent (RR = 2.20; 95%CI 1.16–4.19), having a suicide plan

(RR = 4.21; 95%CI 2.07–8.48) and history of attempted
suicide (RR = 1.40; 95%CI 0.82–2.41) were greater than
for healthy, community non-patients.

Betters and Shaw32 considered whether clinical depres-
sion and or anxiety could be predicted by speciﬁc demo-
graphic and forensic variables. For this review, we focused
on variables relating to workers’ compensation. It was
noted that workers’ compensation carrier satisfaction was
not signiﬁcantly predictive of the presence of depression or
anxiety in any of the analyses.

Collie18 investigated whether workers’ compensation as
an income source or concern regarding claim submission
inﬂuenced the level of psychological distress experienced
among claimants. Workers reporting a high level of
concern or moderate level of concern about the response
of their workplace to a claim submission were found to
have higher levels of psychological distress (OR = 2.31,
95%CI 1.88–2.83, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.74, 95%CI
1.42–2.13, p < 0.001 respectively) than those with low
concerns. Workers whose main source of income was
workers’ compensation had signiﬁcantly higher levels of
psychological distress
receiving
wages (OR = 1.58, 95%CI 1.19–2.11, p = 0.002). This
study also found that workers requiring support to navigate
through the claims system had higher levels of psycholog-
ical distress than those not requiring support (OR = 1.29,
95%CI 1.11–1.51, p = 0.001).

compared to those

Hee33 assessed the difference in mental health assessment
scores (calculated using the Short Form Health Survey–
SF36) between spinal disorder patients receiving and not
receiving workers’ compensation. After adjusting for covar-
iates, patients not receiving compensation had signiﬁcantly
higher mental health scores (adjusted mean ± SE = 64.2 ±
0.2), suggesting better wellbeing, than those receiving com-
pensation (adjusted mean ± SE = 62.8 ± 0.6). The test for dif-
ference in adjusted means was signiﬁcant (p(F) = 0.05).

Kim21 considered differences in the incidence of depres-
sion among individuals receiving workers’ compensation
for an occupational injury compared to those with either a
non-occupational injury or no injury. Individuals receiving
workers’ compensation as a source of medical payment had
33% higher odds (95%CI 1.01–1.74) of developing depres-
sion in latter interviews, compared to individuals not receiv-
ing compensation.

Wall34 compared psychological symptoms of depression
(assessed by the GHQ-28 scale) between workers who
either currently were pursuing or had previously pursued a
claim through the compensation system, in comparison to
those not making claims for occupational injury. A signiﬁ-
cant difference in depression symptoms (p < 0.01) was
noted between non-claimants (mean = 1, SD = 2.5) and
current claimants (mean = 4.5, SD = 5.6). Depression scores
for previous claimants (mean = 3, SD = 4.1) were not signif-
icantly different from either current claimants or those not
making a claim.

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to systematically review and synthesise
associations between workers’ compensation schemes and
mental health outcomes. The ﬁndings suggest some evidence
of an association between being in receipt of workers’ com-
pensation for an occupational injury and subsequent poor
mental health and suicidal behaviours. This review highlights
a paucity of literature on workplace injuries and subsequent
mental health outcomes, including self-harm and suicidality
in persons seeking compensation, with only seven studies
included.

Adverse associations with workers’ compensation were
found for both studies examining suicidality (assessed by
suicide rates, suicidal intent and having a suicide plan). It
is possible that reduced capacity to participate in occupa-
tional duties and stressors associated with the compensation
process may underpin this association.23 The presence of
chronic pain associated with the injury may also contribute
to suicide outcomes, as identiﬁed by Fishbain.31 Speciﬁc
aspects of the compensation process, such as medical assess-
ments may also contribute to claimant distress and could be
an important factor in subsequent suicidality.24

Studies have found that individuals receiving compensa-
tion are more likely to suffer greater disability and subse-
quently be less likely to return to work compared to
non-compensated individuals.35,36 There is evidence that
long-term unemployment is associated with an increased
incidence of suicide37 so unemployment induced by a work-
place injury may be an important factor in this relationship.
This highlights the difﬁculty in determining precisely the
extent to which suicidality is attributable to the compensation
process itself, or injury-induced unemployment, or some-
thing else.

The association between pursuing workers’ compensation
and subsequent poor psychological health, as assessed by
diagnoses or symptoms of depression and or anxiety, was
noted in most studies. However, small sample sizes and the
recruitment of subjects through convenience sampling in
some studies created difﬁculty in establishing deﬁnitive con-
clusions regarding the relationship with other factors.

As noted above, we note that causality between workers’
compensation and mental health outcome cannot be estab-
lished from this review. A major challenge in research of
this kind is the difﬁculty in determining whether outcomes
of mental health and or self-harm are related to the injury
itself or the compensation system. A further possibility is
that of reverse causation. For example, poor work environ-
ments may have an impact on the mental health of workers
and heighten their risk of occupational injury and becoming
a workers’ compensation claimant. This highlights a key
need for further research.

While further research is necessary to elucidate the precise
impacts of pursuing workers’ compensation on subsequent
development of mental health conditions, the compensation

system itself has already been suggested to be the greatest
source of stress.38 Our ﬁndings support
the notion that
some of
the mental health impacts are attributable to
various elements of a complex and protracted compensation
process. The extent to which psychological conditions are
attributable to compensation is further complicated by the
concurrent presence of idiosyncrasies across individuals’
emotional responses and the recovery process following
workplace injury.39

The pursuit of compensation following occupational
injury however may have a noteworthy contribution
towards the development of psychological symptoms and
diagnoses. In 2013, Kim21 found that workers’ compensation
recipients had higher odds of developing depression com-
pared to workers not injured or who acquired their injury
outside of occupation. These ﬁndings are likely to be more
robust given the larger sample size that was also more repre-
sentative of the general workers’ compensation population.
Many claimants ﬁnd the compensation process extremely
stressful, with many aspects of the system being a potential
source of, or contributor
to stress levels. These could
include the adversarial nature of compensation in some juris-
dictions40 and encountering delays or disagreements with
case managers.41,42 Claimants have also reported ﬁnding
the system to be bureaucratic, causing them to feel invisible
and de-personalised.43,44 While some deterioration in mental
health may be pre-existing and not solely due to their
injury,45 the compensation process may exacerbate this.

Strengths and Limitations

This review followed a rigorous, systematic approach adher-
ing to PRISMA guidelines. A Risk of Bias assessment was
conducted, utilising the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale;
this
helped identify studies at higher risk of bias, assisting with
interpretation of ﬁndings. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst review to consider both mental health outcomes and sui-
cidality with the pursuing of workers’ compensation. This
allows for considering the broader picture and appreciating
the complex nature of the associations identiﬁed.

There are some limitations in this review. There was con-
siderable heterogeneity in study design, sampling, study pop-
ulation and types of injuries, making generalisation of
ﬁndings difﬁcult. Most studies were cross-sectional
in
design, limiting the inference of any causal relationships.
Variability in outcomes was noted between the two studies
examining suicidality, with one investigating cases of death
by suicide23 and the other considering previous attempts
and suicidal ideation.31 Multiple factors including demo-
graphics, nature of injury, recovery and degree of support
provided by the workplace are also inﬂuential, and this
review cannot isolate the effect of workers’ compensation
from these factors. Finally, given the variations in compensa-
tion systems across the world, there was little consistency of
comparators across the included studies in this systematic

review. Given the paucity of studies in this area, we were
unable to impose a tighter comparator; however, we note
that this heterogeneity limits conclusions drawn from this
review.

There was heterogeneity in studies examining mental
health outcomes, potentially leading to measurement error
and misclassiﬁcation of mental health outcomes. Different
measures (e.g. K-6, BHI-2, SF-36) or variations of such
were utilised, with some studies involving participants self-
reporting their data and others incorporated the scale in
their interviews.

Finally, for assessing Risk of Bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale was used. While included studies received ratings indi-
cating varying quality, all were included in the qualitative
synthesis because the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale does not
include any recommended cut-off scores for study quality.

Implications of Findings

Despite the limitations, this review highlighted some evi-
dence of an association between workers’ compensation
and subsequent mental health problems and suicidality that
warrants further investigation. While there should continue
to be a focus on prevention of occupational injuries, manage-
ment and assistance for the sizeable number of injured
workers is crucial. In Australia, for instance, more than
100,000 workers ﬁle compensation claims for serious cases
per year.45 In Canada, where each province operates its
own compensation system, there were 277, 217 accepted
claims for occupational injuries resulting in time off work
across all jurisdictions in 2021.46 It is crucial then that com-
pensation processes do not compound the stress experienced
by injured workers.

such as

To improve outcomes for claimants, efforts should focus
on enhancing not only the accessibility and efﬁciency of
compensation systems but also the quality of interactions
between claimants and their managers. Claimants who feel
their case managers lack transparency or treat them unfairly
often report poorer mental health outcomes and a higher like-
lihood of serious mental illness compared to those who per-
ceive just treatment.47,48 For example, reducing adversarial
experiences may be achieved through implementing mea-
the fostering of positive relationships
sures
between claimants and case managers through open, fair
and regular communication, while ensuring respectful treat-
ment and offering avenues for changing case managers if
necessary. Additional support for claimants navigating the
claims system could include mediation services to help
terms,49 or a third-party advocate with
understand legal
medical expertise to assist without bias, thus addressing
power imbalances.50 Limitation of legal jargon use where
possible may also be beneﬁcial. It has been proposed that
integrating access to mental health supports into the compen-
sation process may not only assist with recovery but could
also expedite the claims process and reduce long-term

costs.19 These beneﬁts need to be further explored, particu-
larly among individuals with pre-existing psychiatric condi-
tions.22 Identifying at-risk individuals earlier together with
ongoing efforts to reduce stigma and mitigate power imbal-
ances is essential for a more equitable and supportive com-
pensation system.51 This is imperative for ensuring that
individuals who are injured at work and pursue a workers’
compensation claim receive just and timely treatment
without being adversely affected by this process.

Further research is required to identify speciﬁc pathways by
which the pursuit of workers’ compensation can lead to poor
outcomes for claimants. Future studies should also investigate
the impact of administrative factors in more depth to better
ascertain their impact on claimants’ mental health. A clearer
understanding on the precise aspects of the compensation
process claimants ﬁnd most difﬁcult will contribute to more
streamlined and less
compensation
systems. As a ﬁnal note, researchers should consider claim-
ants’
the
lived experiences to inform understanding of
impacts of claim systems on individual experiences.

Conclusion
These ﬁndings suggest that pursuing a workers’ compensa-
tion claim may be associated with adverse mental health
and self-harm outcomes. However, there is insufﬁcient evi-
dence to conclude any causality. Further research is required
to clearly deﬁne the factors associated with pursuing
workers’ compensation and mental health and self-harm out-
comes. Additionally, further research can help elucidate the
extent to which psychological distress is directly attributable
to the compensation process, as safer access to a more efﬁ-
cient and supportive compensation system may provide sub-
stantial beneﬁts to claimants and society through a reduction
in the burden of mental health issues and suicidality.
