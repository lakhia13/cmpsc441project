This review focuses on current research developments in the study of gene by early life
stress (ELS) interactions and depression. ELS refers to aversive experiences during child-
hood and adolescence such as sexual, physical or emotional abuse, emotional or physical
neglect as well as parental loss. Previous research has focused on investigating and char-
acterizing the speciﬁc role of ELS within the pathogenesis of depression and linking these
ﬁndings to neurobiological changes of the brain, especially the stress response system.
The latest ﬁndings highlight the role of genetic factors that increase vulnerability or, like-
wise, promote resilience to depression after childhood trauma. Considering intermediate
phenotypes has further increased our understanding of the complex relationship between
early trauma and depression. Recent ﬁndings with regard to epigenetic changes resulting
from adverse environmental events during childhood promote current endeavors to iden-
tify speciﬁc target areas for prevention and treatment schemes regarding the long-term
impact of ELS. Taken together, the latest research ﬁndings have underscored the essential
role of genotypes and epigenetic processes within the development of depression after
childhood trauma, thereby building the basis for future research and clinical interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Mood disorders are among the most prevalent forms of men-
tal illness. The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder
(MDD) among US adults is 16.5%, with women being 70% more
likely than men to develop depression. Stress and trauma expo-
sure are major risk factors for the development of depression,
particularly when experienced early in life. However, up to 40%
of the risk to develop depression appears to be genetic. Additional
risk factors of depression include family history of depression,
past episodes of depression, and speciﬁc personality traits, such
as neuroticism among others. The combined impact of genetic
and environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis and
onset of depression is in line with the diathesis–stress model (1).
According to this psychological model, the interaction between
predispositional factors and stressors leads to disorders such as
depression.

A wealth of studies document the prominent role of early life
stress (ELS), such as sexual, physical or emotional abuse, emo-
tional or physical neglect, or parental loss, in the pathogenesis of
depression [see Ref. (2–5)]. During periods of heightened neural
plasticity throughout development, brain regions involved in the
regulation of emotion and the mediation of the stress response
appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of ELS. Such
experience-dependent plasticity may produce altered neural cir-
cuits, and hence maladaptive responsiveness to the environment,
that ultimately leads to elevated risk for depression. However, not
all individuals who experience ELS develop depression in adult-
hood, underscoring the importance of investigating the underpin-
nings of such variability in the link between ELS and depression.
Understanding the source of such outcome variability could aid in

identifying pre-disease vulnerability tests and in devising targeted
prevention strategies.

A major body of evidence has rapidly accumulated over the past
years concerning interactive effects of genetic factors and ELS in
determining depression risk (3). These studies have mostly focused
on studying the moderating effects of variations in candidate genes
acting in neurobiological systems that have been implicated in
the pathophysiology of major depression in large-scale epidemi-
ological samples. Outcome measures usually comprise lifetime or
current diagnoses of major depression or dimensional ratings of
depressive symptoms, respectively. More recently, however, this
focus has shifted to consider Gene × ELS interaction effects on
phenotypic features, such as neural structure or function, neu-
roendocrine function, or behavioral constructs, that may mediate
the link between stress and clinical manifestations of depression
and that may be affected by genetic variation [see Ref. (6)]. This
so-called intermediate phenotype approach is thought to provide
more potent and valid associations between genetic factors and a
given disease, such as depression, because genes are more proxi-
mate to the pathophysiological pathways that lead to depression
than to the diagnostic categorization as deﬁned by DSM-IV. In
the following, we provide an overview of studies identifying inter-
actions between candidate genes and ELS in the prediction of
the clinical manifestation of depression as well as corresponding
intermediate phenotypes.

GENE × ELS INTERACTIONS IN THE PREDICTION
OF DEPRESSION
A large body of research has focused on identifying candidate
genetic variations that interact with ELS in predicting current or

lifetime diagnoses, or symptom severity, of MDD. Core symptoms
of depression include sad mood, loss of pleasure, sleep disruption,
loss of appetite, decreased libido, impaired cognition, feelings of
worthlessness and guilt, and suicidal ideation. Diagnosis of an
episode of MDD requires the presence of ﬁve or more symptoms
over a 2-week period, with sad mood or loss of pleasure being one
of the symptoms. Candidate genes studied to date have consid-
ered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in neurobiological
systems relevant to stress and depression, i.e., the monoaminergic
neurotransmitter, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and GR-chaperone systems, as well
as neurotrophin, oxytocin, and endocannabinoid systems.

SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER
The serotonergic system is the most prominent target of antide-
pressant pharmacotherapy [see Ref. (1)]. The main mechanism of
action of serotonergic drugs is based on the inhibition of serotonin
reuptake. Serotonergic neurons originate in the nucleus raphé and
project to the forebrain. Serotonin is thought to be critical for
regulating emotional responses in cortical–limbic networks and
has regulatory effects on neuroendocrine stress responses. Stress
mediators, such as CRH, modulate serotonin release in the nucleus
raphé and regulate serotonin release in the medial prefrontal cor-
tex (PFC) (7). Based on this evidence, the serotonergic system is
of interest in the study of Gene × ELS interactions in predicting
MDD. At the synaptic level, serotonergic neurotransmission and
reuptake is regulated by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4).
A common functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the pro-
moter region of SLC6A4 involves either short (s) or long (l) alleles,
with the short allele variant being associated with lower transcrip-
tional efﬁciency. In a seminal report, Caspi et al. (8) demonstrated
in the prospective Dunedin Birth Cohort of New Zealand that
5-HTTLPR interacts with stressful life events, including child mal-
treatment, to predict current and lifetime diagnoses of MDD as
well as suicide attempts. Speciﬁcally, the s-allele was found to con-
fer risk for developing depression in the context of life stress in
this study. The report by Caspi et al. (8) served as an impetus for a
wealth of subsequent studies, providing both replications and fail-
ures to replicate the original ﬁnding [see Ref. (9)]. A meta-analysis
failed to conﬁrm the interaction effect (10). A critical debate over
this topic identiﬁed potential sources of this heterogeneity, mainly
stemming from methodological differences between studies (11).
The method of assessing ELS, as well as the type and timing of
ELS, appear to be important effect modiﬁers (12). In addition,
the deﬁnition of the outcome variable seems to be of partic-
ular importance. Speciﬁcally, the 5-HTTLPR × ELS interaction
appears to predict persistent depression (i.e., an episode of MDD
diagnosed at least twice), but is not predictive of a single-episode
of MDD (13). Furthermore, it has now been reported that the
interaction between 5-HTTLPR and ELS in predicting depression
is moderated by other polymorphisms (see below).

In the light of a female preponderance in the risk for MDD,
sex differences in Gene × ELS interactions have been studied. An
interaction of 5-HTTLPR and ELS in predicting depression was
found to be more pronounced in females than in males (14, 15).
Carli et al. (16) reported that the l-allele was associated with
increased risk for depression in male subjects exposed to ELS. It

remains unclear whether these Gene × ELS × Sex interactions are
attributable to sex differences at a neurobiological level or to sex
differences in exposure variables. In addition to sex differences, age
may moderate the 5-HTTLPR × ELS interaction effect in the pre-
diction of depression, e.g., the l-allele carrying genotype exhibits
higher vulnerability to develop depression in interaction with ELS
in elderly adults (17).

DOPAMINE RECEPTOR (DAT1)
Dopamine is assumed to play an important role in the pathogene-
sis of MDD through its function in regulating motivation, reward,
and the ability to experience pleasure (18). Stress contributes to
loss of pleasure or anhedonia, a cardinal symptom of depression,
by impacting on dopaminergic pathways that are implicated in
reward processing, such as the mesocorticolimbic pathways (19,
20). In a study of male adolescents, a polymorphism, rs40184,
in the dopamine receptor gene (DAT1) interacted with perceived
maternal rejection in predicting the presence of MDD and suicidal
ideation (21). This Gene × ELS interaction effect was speciﬁc to
the prediction of MDD and did not predict anxiety, perhaps in
accordance with the behavioral effects of dopaminergic pathway
dysfunction. Of note, polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR and other
genes appear to interact with stress in predicting reward learning,
which is an important intermediate phenotype in the link between
genes, stress, and depression (see below).

CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE RECEPTOR AND BINDING
GLOBULIN
The central CRH system plays a pivotal role in the relationship
between ELS and depression. CRH neurons in the paraventric-
ular nucleus of the hypothalamus form the central component
of the HPA axis, the major neuroendocrine stress response sys-
tem in mammals. Cortisol, the end product of the HPA axis
exerts stress-adaptive metabolic, immune-regulatory and behav-
ioral effects, and controls HPA axis responsiveness via negative
feedback inhibition. In addition, CRH acts in a widespread cir-
cuitry connecting cortical, limbic, and brainstem regions and
is thought to integrate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral
responses to stress. Behavioral effects of CRH resemble the core
signs and symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. These
effects are mediated though CRHR1 receptors (22). CRH hyper-
activity is a core biological feature of MDD (23). There is ample
evidence from animal and human studies that ELS contributes to
such hyperactivity (24). Hence, the CRHR1 gene has been stud-
ied as a candidate gene in moderating the relationship between
ELS and MDD. Bradley et al. (25) demonstrated an interac-
tion between self-reported childhood abuse and polymorphisms
in the CRHR1 gene in predicting adult depression. Two haplo-
types were identiﬁed that conferred protection against developing
depression in persons who reported moderate–severe child abuse
exposure, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
(CTQ) (26). When exposed to moderate–severe childhood abuse,
persons who were homozygous for the protective haplotypes
showed signiﬁcantly less symptoms of depression as compared
to individuals with other haplotype combinations. Within the
protective haplotypes, rs110402 was most potent in predicting
depression after ELS, with A allele carriers being protected. These

ﬁndings were replicated in two independent cohorts (25, 27). In
the Polanczyk et al. (27) study, the interaction was replicated in
the UK Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study using ret-
rospective self-reports of childhood maltreatment, assessed by
CTQ similar to the Bradley et al. (25) study. In contrast, these
authors could not replicate the interaction effect in the Dunedin
Birth Cohort that provides prospective multi-informant reports
of childhood maltreatment. The authors, therefore, speculate that
the CRHR1 gene moderates emotional memory, which in turn
may be linked to risk versus resilience against depression (27).
Other potential reasons for discordant results might be differences
in features of ELS. Heim et al. (22) reported that the interac-
tion between rs110402 and ELS in predicting depression was
speciﬁc to physical abuse. This produced a sex difference in the
interaction of rs110402 and ELS, because males were more fre-
quently exposed to physical abuse than females in this sample. Of
note, Grabe et al. (28) also report interactions between different
SNPs in CRHR1 and speciﬁcally physical neglect, as measured by
CTQ. CRHR1 polymorphisms also interact with physical assault
during childhood or adolescence in predicting suicide risk par-
ticularly in males (29), further stressing the importance of this
gene in interacting with physically abusive experiences. These
results suggest that the environmental exposure must be care-
fully assessed in Gene × ELS studies [see Ref. (3)]. In addition,
two recent studies have demonstrated that CRHR1 SNPs inter-
act with 5-HTTLPR in predicting depression after ELS (30, 31).
Such three-way Gene × Gene × ELS interaction effects may con-
tribute to inconsistent results between studies considering only
one gene. Beyond CRHR1 polymorphisms, an interaction of
a polymorphism in the CRH binding protein (CRHBP) gene,
which may modulate the availability of CRH at the synapse,
and childhood trauma in predicting suicide attempts has been
recently reported (32). Taken together, these studies support a
pivotal role of the central CRH system in mediating the link
between ELS and depression, and the genetic moderation of
this link.

GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR AND FKBP5
The regulating effects of cortisol on brain and behavior are medi-
ated by binding of the hormone to speciﬁc receptors. High-afﬁnity
mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are located in the hippocam-
pus and exert tonic inhibitory effects on basal HPA axis activity,
whereas high-afﬁnity GR are widely distributed throughout the
PFC, amygdala, hippocampus, and brainstem, and are critical to
regulating responses during conditions of elevated cortisol secre-
tion or stress. Upon binding of cortisol to the intracellular cytosolic
GR, the GR–hormone complex becomes activated and translo-
cates to the nucleus, where the complex binds to gene responsive
elements which impact on transcription of proteins. Relative GR
resistance is a core feature of MDD, perhaps leading to disinhi-
bition of central CRH secretion and HPA axis hyperactivity. The
GR gene has been studied as a candidate gene that may mod-
erate the link between ELS and MDD in one study. Bet et al.
(33) demonstrated in a longitudinal aging study conducted in the
Netherlands in individuals aged 55–85 years that the 22/23EK and
9beta polymorphisms in the GR gene interacted with life events
and adversities during youth, including war experiences, sexual

abuse, parental loss, or physical illness in the prediction of clinically
relevant depression.

The sensitivity of the GR is ﬁne-tuned by FK506 binding pro-
tein 51 (FKBP5), a co-chaperone of hsp90. When bound to the
GR-hsp90 complex, FKBP5 decreases GR afﬁnity for cortisol and
prevents translocation of the GR to the nucleus [see Ref. (34)].
Of note, glucocorticoids induce the expression of FKBP5, forming
an ultra-short negative feedback loop for GR activity (34). Given
the important role of GR in regulating stress responses and the
evidence for GR resistance in depression, variation of the FKBP5
gene likely is a critical modulator of the relationship between ELS
and depression (34). Variants in the FKBP5 gene have been shown
to modulate risk of developing PTSD in relation to childhood
trauma (35). In a recent population-representative sample of more
than 2000 German people, Appel et al. (36) report an interaction
between rs1360780 of the FKBP5 gene and ELS, assessed by CTQ,
in predicting both depressive symptoms and DSM-IV diagnoses
of MDD. Speciﬁcally, TT carriers who reported physical abuse
were at greater risk for depression than CC/CT carriers exposed to
physical abuse. This interaction effect was conﬁrmed for individ-
uals who experienced very severe forms of sexual and emotional
abuse (36). Another recent study in 884 adolescent and young adult
individuals conﬁrmed an interaction of different FKBP5 variants,
including rs1360780, and traumatic life events in predicting the
onset of MDD in a 10-year prospective study (37). These latter
ﬁndings were replicated in the UK Environmental Risk Longitudi-
nal Twin Study (37). FKBP5 polymorphisms were further reported
to interact with CTQ score in predicting suicide attempts in an
adult African American sample (38). The same group reported an
additive effect of FKBP5 polymorphism on the interaction of the
CRHBP gene and ELS in predicting suicide attempts (32). These
results, taken together, strongly implicate the FKBP5 gene in the
pathogenesis of stress-related depression, likely mediated through
determining individual level of GR resistance and, consequently,
glucocorticoid signaling.

BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed
neurotrophin in the brain that is implicated in neuronal growth,
synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival, and therefore is thought
to play an important role in structural brain abnormalities
observed in depressed individuals, such as reduced hippocampal
volume (1, 39). In animal models, prolonged stress exposure and
elevated glucocorticoid levels down-regulate BDNF expression,
whereas administration of antidepressant drugs induces BDNF
expression; antidepressant treatment normalizes hippocampal
volume in depressed patients (1). The BDNF gene contains a
functional polymorphism (rs6265), which is associated with a
valine to methionine substitution (Val66Met) and leads to reduced
BDNF expression. Aguilera et al. (40) report an interaction of this
polymorphism and childhood sexual abuse in the prediction of
adult depression. Speciﬁcally, carriers of the Met allele (Met/Met,
Met/Val) who reported childhood sexual abuse were at greater
risk for developing depressive symptoms compared to carriers
of the Val/Val genotype. Several studies have provided evidence
that the 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms inter-
act in predicting depression after ELS. In one study, maltreated

Genes, early trauma, and depression

children carrying the Met allele of BDNF Val66Met and two short
alleles of 5-HTTLPR exhibit highest depression scores (41). This
BDNF Val66Met × 5-HTTLPR × ELS interaction in the prediction
of depression was replicated in a study of adult female twins (42).
However, two other studies failed to replicate this three-way inter-
action in the prediction of depression (40, 43), perhaps suggesting
further moderating factors.

OXYTOCIN RECEPTOR
The central oxytocin system mediates social attachment, including
mother–infant bonding, and buffers emotional and physiological
responses to stress (44). For example, intranasal administration
of oxytocin reduces amygdala activation in response to fearful
visual stimuli in humans (45). In patients with MDD, plasma
oxytocin concentrations are inversely correlated with symptom
severity of depression and anxiety (46). Women reporting expo-
sure to childhood maltreatment exhibit deceases in cerebrospinal
ﬂuid oxytocin concentrations, which in turn were associated with
increased anxiety (22). In a mouse model, oxytocin exerted anxi-
olytic effects by regulating serotonin release though activation of
oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in serotonergic neurons (47). There-
fore, the OXTR receptor gene is a candidate gene that may mod-
erate the link between ELS and depression. One study reported an
interaction of OXTR rs2254298 and adverse parental environment
in predicting symptoms of depression in 9–14 years old girls (48).
Girls who were heterozygous (A/G) for the OXTR rs2254298 poly-
morphism and reported high levels of adversity exhibited the most
severe depression as well as physical symptoms and social anxiety.
Of note, the level of parental adversity in this study was opera-
tionalized as a history of recurrent MDD in the mother, hence
measured associations between adversity and depression in the
girls may also reﬂect genetic risk. Other studies report associations
of another OXTR polymorphism, rs53576, on several interme-
diate phenotypes that are relevant in the link between ELS and
depression, which are reviewed below.

ENDOCANNABINOID RECEPTOR
The endocannabinoid system, consisting of endocannabinoid
receptors and their endogenous ligands appear to play a role in the
adaptation to stress and emotional responses (49). Endocannabi-
noid receptor 1 receptor knockout in mice modulates the effects
of chronic unpredictable stress on the development of anhedonia
in mice (50). In a recent study Agrawal et al. (51) evaluated the
role of a polymorphism in the human endocannabinoid recep-
tor (CNR1), rs1049353, in moderating the association between
childhood physical abuse and anhedonia or MDD in young adult
US women. Those women who carried two copies of the minor
allele (G/G) exhibited less anhedonia when exposed to childhood
physical abuse compared to carriers of the A allele (A/A or A/G).
This protective effect was also seen for MDD, but was largely
attributable to anhedonic MDD. The effect was replicated in an
independent Australian sample (51). Of note, the interaction effect
was speciﬁc to physical abuse and was not observed in relation to
sexual abuse.

SUMMARY
In summary, a number of genes operating in neurobiological sys-
tems that mediate stress responses, social–emotional regulation,

and/or synaptic plasticity have been identiﬁed to date as signiﬁ-
cant moderators of the relationship between ELS and depression.
While several of these interaction effects have been replicated
across independent studies, there is heterogeneity in the ﬁeld. It
becomes evident that multiple factors, both on the genetic and on
the environmental side of the equation, must be considered in the
prediction of depression. First, it is unlikely that a single gene is
implicated in the relationship between ELS and depression and
it appears that multiple polymorphisms in different genes inter-
act with the environment in determining depression risk. Second,
early environmental exposures such as ELS are complex in nature
and there is increasing evidence for speciﬁcity of Gene × ELS inter-
action effects in depression, inasmuch as effects were reported for
one type of maltreatment but not another. In addition, the method
of assessment of ELS (i.e., retrospective self-report versus prospec-
tive informant reports) inﬂuences results. Additional sources of
variability concern gender, ethnic background, and resources such
as social support, among others. Future studies should scrutinize
these complex interactions. In addition, genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) of Gene × ELS interactions in depression have
the potential to conﬁrm candidate gene effects and/or to reveal
novel genes that might be critical in the link between ELS and
depression that were not selected as candidates based on theo-
retical reasoning [for detailed discussion, see Ref. (3)]. Finally,
the functional signiﬁcance of many of the identiﬁed polymor-
phisms remains unknown and, hence, the biological mechanisms
that mediate genetically determined risk or resilience to depres-
sion, in the context of ELS, are poorly understood. Toward that
end, there is an increasing body of studies adopting the so-called
intermediate phenotype approach to further our understanding
of the association between ELS and depression, as discussed in the
following.

GENE × ELS INTERACTIONS IN DEPRESSION: CONCEPT
OF INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES
Genetic disposition and environmental exposures are linked to
the manifestation of a psychiatric syndrome through a number of
intermediate steps that span from altered cells to altered neural cir-
cuits to altered behavioral domains, such as cognition or emotion
processing. The intermediate phenotype approach in psychiatry
seeks to identify genetic effects on each level of these intermediate
phenotypes, which are more proximal to the etiological process
than the diagnosis itself that is derived from disputable classiﬁca-
tion criteria. By mapping neurobiological effects of a risk gene on
known brain phenotypes of a disorder, this approach also allows
for deciding whether a risk gene indeed is relevant for a pathophys-
iological mechanism involved in the given disorder or whether a
found association between a gene and a disorder is a pure epiphe-
nomenon of another causal association. Hence, the intermediate
phenotype approach increases power and validity of detecting a
genetic effect on a psychiatric disorder (6, 52). While a number
of intermediate phenotype studies have been conducted to test for
genetic main effects on phenotypes linked to a given disorder, only
a few studies have applied this approach to elucidate Gene × ELS
interactions in depression. In order to study Gene × ELS effects
on intermediate phenotypes that might be located on the path-
way to the manifestation of depression, it must be decided which

Genes, early trauma, and depression

phenotypes are indeed relevant for mediating the link between ELS
and depression risk. In other words, some of the known biological
features of depression might be linked to ELS, whereas others are
not. Therefore, the selection of the appropriate intermediate phe-
notype for Gene × ELS studies needs to be informed by research
on the contribution of ELS to the neurobiology of MDD.

INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES LINKING ELS AND MDD
A number of clinical studies have now elucidated effects of ELS
on the neurobiology of MDD in humans [see Ref. (3, 53)]. Adult
women with histories of childhood sexual or physical abuse exhibit
markedly increased neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to
psychosocial laboratory stress, particularly those with depres-
sion (54). Other alterations in humans with ELS experiences
altered glucocorticoid feedback, increased levels of inﬂammation,
increased central CRH activity, and decreased activity of the proso-
cial neuropeptide, oxytocin (22, 55–59). A small hippocampus
has also been linked to ELS in humans (60–65). ELS also has
been linked to reduced volumes of the insula (61), orbitofrontal
cortex (61, 66), anterior cingulate (61, 67), caudate (61), and
medial PFC (62, 68). Moreover, increased amygdala volume and
reactivity (61, 69–71) as well as left basal ganglia dysfunction
in response to reward cues (72) have been reported as a func-
tion of ELS. Furthermore, ELS is associated with altered cortical
affective processing in patients with various psychiatric disor-
ders (73). It appears that ELS produces changes in a connected
neural network that fails to adapt or compensate in response to
additional challenge, thereby leading to the behavioral and phys-
iological changes that ultimately form the syndrome of clinical
depression (59). More recently, epigenetic marks that occur as a
function of ELS have been reported, such as hyper-methylation
of the GR gene, resulting in reduced GR expression (74, 75). In a
genome-wide post-mortem study of hippocampal tissue obtained
from suicides, ELS was associated with differential methylation
of 362 genes, particularly affecting genes involved in neuronal
plasticity (76). In several of the above studies, neurobiological
changes clearly distinguished between depressed persons or sui-
cide victims with and without ELS experiences, including HPA
axis reactivity (54, 59), hippocampal volume (65), PFC volume
(62), amygdala reactivity (69), and methylation pattern (74, 76),
suggesting that these phenotypes mediate the link between ELS
and MDD and, therefore, might be appropriate targets for study-
ing Gene × ELS interactions in depression. ELS further modulates
behavioral domains, including social–emotional processing (71,
77), conditioned fear (78), or reward anticipation (72), all of
which represent relevant intermediate phenotypes for Gene × ELS
studies in depression.

GENE × ELS INTERACTION EFFECTS ON INTERMEDIATE
PHENOTYPES RELATED TO DEPRESSION
Only a small, but rapidly increasing number of studies to date
have assessed the combined impact of genetic variation and ELS
exposure on intermediate phenotypes of interest for the devel-
opment of depression. In addition to studies in humans, several
studies in non-human primates provide additional insight into
Gene × ELS interactions in predicting intermediate phenotypes
relevant to depression.

GENE × ELS INTERACTION EFFECTS ON THE HPA AXIS
Due to the central role of the HPA axis activity in the pathogenesis
of depression, it is of interest to investigate Gene × ELS interaction
effects on HPA axis activity as intermediate phenotype of depres-
sion. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter
gene (SLC6A4) has been of prime interest in this context with
the s-allele being associated with an elevated risk for depression
following critical life stress compared to the l-allele (8). Several
studies indicate that there is an interaction between 5-HTTLPR
genotype and ELS on HPA axis activity.

In a laboratory setting with a standardized stress task (stress
induced by a subtraction task and semi-structured interview) girls
aged between 9 and 14 years showed higher and prolonged levels
of cortisol if they were s-allele carriers compared to l-allele carriers
(79). These ﬁndings support the idea that HPA axis activity is dif-
ferentially affected by an interaction between 5-HTTLPR genotype
and stress. Adding to these ﬁndings, s-allele carriers with a history
of stressful life events showed increased cortisol reactivity to labo-
ratory stress (public speaking) in a sample of healthy male adults
(80). Genotype and life stressor history, therefore, both seem to
modulate endocrine reactivity to acute stress. Young adults who
had taken part in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) showed dis-
tinct cortisol reactivity depending on the evaluative context of the
condition (critical, supportive, or none) (81). Only in the negative
audience condition an interaction with the 5-HTTLPR genotype
emerged indicating that the s-allele carriers are particularly sen-
sitive to social threat and therefore show heightened endocrine
stress responses.

An age-dependent pattern of results was found in a recent
study (82). HPA axis activity was investigated by measuring cor-
tisol responses and stressful life events in children, young and old
adults who were subjected to the TSST. An interaction between
5-HTTLPR genotype and life stress on endocrine stress responses
was found only in young adults and only if the life stressors had
occurred in the ﬁrst 5 years of life suggesting that the ﬁrst years
of life are particularly sensitive. An interactive effect between 5-
HTTLPR genotype and stress was also found in cortisol responses
of newborn babies exposed to painful stimulation (83). Height-
ened sensitivity of s-allele carriers toward stress exposure therefore
seems to be present at an early developmental stage.

There is evidence for a Gene × Gene × ELS effect; an inter-
action between 5-HTTLPR and acute stress (TSST) on cortisol
response emerged in a non-clinical sample only when at least one
copy of the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4) 7R allele was
present (84). Another study found that BDNF Val66Met polymor-
phisms moderate the interactive effects between 5-HTTLPR and
stress on HPA axis reactivity in a sample of preschool children (85).
Therefore, it seems necessary to include several genetic polymor-
phisms within crucial pathways of stress regulation and investigate
their interactive effects in more detail.

In a seminal study, Tyrka et al. (86) evaluated whether the func-
tional polymorphisms rs110402 and rs242924 in the CRHR1 gene,
which previously had been identiﬁed as an important moderator
of depression risk after ELS [see above; (25)], interacts with child
maltreatment to predict HPA axis reactivity. For each polymor-
phism, subjects who carried the GG genotype and who reported a
history of child maltreatment exhibited elevated cortisol responses

in the dexamethasone/CRH test. In accordance with the clinical
outcome study (25), A allele carriers (AA, AG) with child maltreat-
ment experience were protected and showed responses similar to
persons with no child maltreatment experience. In persons with
no child maltreatment experience, CRHR1 polymorphisms did
not modify HPA axis reactivity. These results suggest an interac-
tion effect, in which the CRHR1 gene and childhood maltreatment
impact on glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of the HPA axis
under challenge conditions, as tested by the speciﬁc test. Increased
responsiveness in the dexamethasone/CRH test has long been
known to be a potent risk marker for depression (87). Hence, this
study provides important insight into the potential mechanism for
a Gene × ELS interaction in depression.

A study published in the same year by Heim et al. (22) repli-
cated and extended this ﬁnding. In this study, it was shown that
the effect of CRHR1 rs110402 in moderating depression risk in
relation to ELS exposure was limited to men, but could not be
observed in women; this apparent sex difference was attributable
to differential exposure types between the sexes, with men expe-
riencing more physical abuse than women (see above). Of note,
in response to the same challenge test used in the study reported
in Ref. (86), there was a graded effect of the protective A allele
on HPA axis reactivity (GG > AG > AA) that was observed only in
male participants, whereas the polymorphism had no effect on cor-
tisol response in women. Accordingly, women with maltreatment
showed enhanced cortisol responses to the dexamethasone/CRH
test, whereas maltreated men did not. These results demonstrate
that the complex interplay of abuse type, sex, and genetic varia-
tion is reﬂected at the level of an intermediate phenotype that is
a relevant risk marker for depression. Cicchetti et al. (30) recently
extended to this line of evidence showing that the CRHR1 TAT
haplotype interacts with 5-HTTLPR to predict diurnal cortisol
levels in maltreated children.

The GR is critically implicated in regulating HPA axis reactivity
and, as noted above, a polymorphism in the GR gene moderates
the link between ELS and depression (33). In the same study, it
was shown that the 22/23EK polymorphism in the GR gene inter-
acts with ELS in predicting a free cortisol index, calculated as
ratio between total cortisol and cortisol binding globulin levels.
In the light of evidence that the FKBP5 gene moderates risk for
affective disorders in relation to ELS [see above; (35–37)], sev-
eral studies investigated interactions of FKBP5 gene variants and
stress in determining indices of HPA axis function. Ising et al. (88)
report that three FKBP5 polymorphisms are associated with pro-
longed cortisol elevations after standardized psychosocial stress
(rs4713916: GG > GT,TT; rs1360780: TT > CT,CC; rs3800737:
AA > AG,GG), although ELS was not assessed in this study. Effects
of FKBP5 polymorphisms on dexamethasone-induced suppres-
sion of cortisol have been reported in interaction with child
abuse-related PTSD, inasmuch as risk variants in various FKBP5
polymorphisms interacted with PTSD status in predicting hyper-
suppression of cortisol (75, 89). These ﬁndings show that risk
genes may interact with a clinical diagnosis that is in turn related
to ELS; however, similar results for depression are lacking. In a
recent seminal study (90), the same group provides strong evidence
for an FKBP5 × ELS interaction in determining de-methylation
of functional glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the

FKBP5 gene. This de-methylation was associated with an increased
transcription of the gene, leading to enhanced feedback between
FKBP5 and GR and, consequently to GR resistance. Effects of this
risk allele-speciﬁc and ELS-dependent de-methylation were shown
at the level of in vitro glucocorticoid sensitivity, glucocorticoid-
regulated metabolic and immune gene expression, as well as
brain structure (90). This remarkable study is the ﬁrst to map in
detail a molecular to neural pathway that underlies a Gene × ELS
interaction effect in the prediction of depression risk.

Other studies have investigated interactions of ELS and can-
didate genes implicated in stress or regulation, although these
candidate genes have not been considered in Gene × ELS studies
predicting clinical depression outcomes. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)
is a peptide that is known to exert anxiolytic and stress-buffering
effects in the central nervous system. A polymorphism in the NPY
gene promoter, rs16147, was found to interact with ELS in predict-
ing neuroendocrine response to psychosocial laboratory stress in a
prospective cohort study of children at risk conducted in Germany
(91). A study by Armbruster et al. (92) focused on the enzyme,
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catabolizes cate-
cholamines. Results revealed main effects for COMT and stressful
life events, but no interaction effect between the two factors, sug-
gesting that the COMT gene operates independently from stress
exposure and is likely not involved in mediating the link between
ELS and depression.

GENE × ELS INTERACTION EFFECTS ON REGIONAL BRAIN STRUCTURE
AND FUNCTION
The study of the impact of speciﬁc serotonin genotypes on struc-
tural and functional characteristics of the brain related to depres-
sion has become of great interest in recent years. In this context, the
prefrontal–amygdala interaction seems to be of particular impor-
tance in affective processing and was found to be differentially
affected by 5-HTTLPR genotype in depressive patients and healthy
controls (93). These ﬁndings were further speciﬁed in a study on
healthy adults (94). In this study, carriers of the risk s-allele dis-
played increased amygdala activation. Further statistical analysis
revealed that this genotype effect was based on the amygdala struc-
ture, which proved to be smaller in the s-allele carriers compared
to the LL genotype. These ﬁndings indicate that genetic effects
during neurodevelopment play a role in this context.

At a structural level, serotonin 3A receptor genotype and its
interaction with ELS were investigated with regard to fronto-
limbic gray matter in a non-clinical sample (95). Interestingly,
the HTR3A CC genotype group displayed gray matter loss in
hippocampal structures compared to the TT genotype group,
with CC carriers plus ELS showing additional gray matter loss
in frontal cortices. In line with this, another study found that
carriers of 5-HTTLPR risk s-allele displayed smaller hippocam-
pal volumes following a history of emotional neglect in depressive
patients compared to patients without ELS or genetic risk genotype
(62). Independent of genotype, hippocampal white matter alter-
ations were predicted by childhood stress in patients. Compared to
healthy controls, the PFC was smaller in patients. Of note, patients
with ELS and non-risk l-allele genotype displayed a larger PFC,
indicating compensatory or protective characteristics. A recent
study in children further highlights the potential mechanisms of

Gene × ELS interactions (96). Study participants who were carri-
ers of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele showed greater attentional bias to
subliminally presented fearful faces than carriers of the non-risk
l-allele. The former also showed increased neural activations to
fearful and angry faces in regions of the association cortex linked
to attention-control in adults. The s-allele genotype, therefore,
seems to be related to hypervigilant behavioral and neural acti-
vation in face of negative stimuli. In the same line, the effects of
acute stress were investigated in a group of healthy women (97).
Women with the SS genotype displayed increased neural activa-
tion during threat anticipation in a large corticolimbic network
compared with l-allele carriers, potentially reﬂecting increased
sensitivity to develop psychopathological symptoms when faced
with stressful events. In healthy men, similar Gene × ELS inter-
actions were found regarding neural response patterns and func-
tional amygdala–hypothalamus connectivity (98). S-allele carriers
with a history of ELS showed heightened sensitivity toward neg-
ative, fearful stimuli in this context. These ﬁndings were further
supported by a study, which focused on fear conditioning in a
similar experimental setting (99). Another recent study found an
interaction between recent stressful life events and SNPs within the
HTR1A and HTR1B genes regarding symptom scores of depres-
sion (100). More speciﬁcally, the interactive effect was observed
with regard to HTR1A rs878567 T alleles and rs6295 G alleles
as well as HTR1B rs6296 C and recent stressful life events. An
experimental face emotion processing task was presented to a
subgroup of the population sample to further investigate threat-
related information processing. Notably, healthy HTR1A rs6295
GG carriers did not display an affective bias to perceive more neg-
ative emotions but showed reduced reaction times when presented
with fearful faces. This modulation of threat-related informa-
tion processing by genotype may predispose certain individuals
to develop depression throughout the life course.

As mentioned earlier, the CRH system plays an important
role in neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress and
is regarded as a central component within the pathogenesis of
depression. Especially polymorphisms of the CRHR1 gene seem
to play an important role in moderating the effects of stress. A
recent study found that variations in the CRHR1 gene, more
speciﬁcally SNP rs110402, moderate neural responses to emotional
stimuli (101). A differential pattern of results emerged between A
allele carriers and GG homozygotes suggesting that vulnerability
to depression is associated with a speciﬁc CRHR1 genotype.

Reward learning was in the focus of a study regarding the
effects of the CRHR1 SNP rs12938031 and acute stress (102).
Reward learning is regarded as a crucial component of anhe-
donia, which is closely related to stress-related psychopathology.
The authors investigated response bias as a function of reward
in healthy female participants under no-stress and acute stress
conditions. The authors found that acute stress led to reduced
response bias, which indicates impaired reward learning under
stressful conditions. Notably, an interaction between rs12938031
and acute stress was also observed, with A homozygotes displaying
stress-related impairment in reward learning. Behavioral ﬁndings
were also supported by neural activation patterns. The modulation
of reward learning by genotype may lead to increased vulnerability
to depression in some individuals.

Another recent study investigating this issue used the personal-
ity trait neuroticism as proxy for depression given that it reﬂects a
tendency to experience negative affect and that it is a major risk fac-
tor for developing depression (103). As childhood maltreatment
is also regarded as major risk factor for depression, the authors
were interested in investigating the interaction of childhood mal-
treatment with a speciﬁc genotype regarding the personality trait
of neuroticism. Based on previous research ﬁndings, variation in
the three CRHR1 SNPs rs110402, rs2452924, and rs7209436 was
investigated in maltreated as well as in non-maltreated children
who participated in a day camp research program. Number and
types of stressors were also taken into account in the analysis. As
expected by the authors, a signiﬁcant interactive effect between
childhood maltreatment and CRHR1 genotype was found in the
prediction of neuroticism. Maltreated children with two copies
of the TAT haplotype of CRHR1 showed higher levels of neu-
roticism than non-maltreated children with the same genotype.
Notably, this effect was not displayed in children with multiple
types of maltreatment or sexual abuse, who seemed to be pro-
tected from increased neuroticism by the same genotype. This
remarkable ﬁnding needs to be explored in further detail and high-
lights the importance of distinguishing between different types
and numbers of stressors.

The BDNF gene polymorphism Val66Met has been found to
be related to anxiety and mood disorders (104). More speciﬁcally,
the interaction between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and ELS
was investigated with regard to brain and arousal pathways to
syndromal depression and anxiety in a non-clinical sample. Sig-
niﬁcant interactions between BDNF genotype and ELS emerged
with BDNF Met-carriers exposed to greater ELS showing smaller
hippocampal and amygdala volumes, heart rate elevations, and a
decline in working memory. The relationship between this poly-
morphism and speciﬁc, emotion-related brain circuitries has also
been studied in anxious and depressed adolescents compared to
healthy controls (105). In the patient group, a signiﬁcant interac-
tion between genotype and emotional stimulus presentation was
found. Met-carriers showed greater neural responses than Val/Val
homozygotes when presented with emotional faces.

The MR iso/val polymorphism (rs5522) has recently been
found to moderate the association between childhood emotional
neglect and amygdala reactivity in children and adolescents (106).
The interactive effects of childhood maltreatment and the OXTR
SNP rs53576 on adult emotional dysregulation and attachment
style were investigated in a sample of low-income, African Amer-
ican men and women (107). Signiﬁcant interactive effects were
found between childhood maltreatment and OXTR rs53576 in
predicting levels of adult emotional dysregulation and attachment
style. While G/G allele carriers appeared to be particularly vul-
nerable to severe childhood maltreatment, A/A and A/G allele
carriers displayed resilience. Distinguishing between numbers and
types of stressors was crucial in this study. Other ﬁndings indicate
that NPY genetic variation may predispose to low NPY expres-
sion, thereby increasing neural responsivity to negative stimuli in
emotion-related brain circuitries (108).

Gene × Gene × ELS effects also need to be considered in
this context as recent studies have found interactive effects for
5-HTTLPR and BDNF, CREB1, BDNF and NTRK2, as well as

www.frontiersin.org

Genes, early trauma, and depression

BDNF and HTR3A genotypes (109–111). CREB1 (cyclic adeno-
sine monophosphate response element-binding protein 1), BDNF
and NTRK2 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2) form a
neuroplastic pathway, which plays a crucial role in brain adaptation
to stress (110).

CONCLUSION
One of the most promising pathways of future research is the
investigation of epigenetic processes modulating the relationship
between Gene × ELS interactions and depression. In this context,
quality of maternal care was found to inﬂuence hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal function in rats through epigenetic programing
of GR expression (112). Low levels of maternal care were associ-
ated with increased methylation of the promoter region of the GR
gene as well as enhanced hormonal and behavioral responses to
stress. These ﬁndings could be translated to the brains of human
suicide victims who had experienced childhood abuse compared
to those victims who had not (74) and were further reﬂected in
a study on childhood adversity and epigenetic modulation of the
leukocyte GR (75). Adding to these ﬁndings, differential mater-
nal rearing conditions led to differential DNA methylation in PFC
and T cells of rhesus macaques (113). These ﬁndings could be
further translated and expanded by evidence suggesting that the
trajectory of male physical aggression is associated with differen-
tial DNA methylation in cytokines and their regulators in T cells
and monocytes (114). The seminal ﬁndings with regard to epi-
genetic processes and FKBP5 following childhood trauma have
substantially added to this knowledge and will encourage future
research endeavors (90).

It is important to note that past studies on Gene × ELS inter-
actions and depression have been subject to a large amount of
heterogeneity due to differences in experimental procedures. An
important difference concerns the measurement of ELS, with crit-
ical issues concerning timing of measurement, type, and context
of ELS studied as well as gender-speciﬁc considerations (115). In
addition, timing of onset of depression and chronicity of the dis-
order may be an important factor in this context and should be
considered in future research efforts.

Previous ﬁndings with regard to Gene × ELS interactions and
depression suggest that genes and environment have signiﬁ-
cant interactive effects in predicting depression, in the absence
of strong main genetic effects (3). While previous research has
been hypotheses-driven focusing on candidate gene approaches,
future studies will move beyond this conﬁnement to genome-wide
hypotheses-free studies, which require much larger study sam-
ples. By this means, new patterns of gene classes or transcription
factor binding sites, which are altered by ELS, may be detected,
thereby supporting the current strive for adequate prevention and
treatment schemes in sufferers from childhood trauma.

Future research will further investigate the differential role of
certain genotypes as a function of adverse and beneﬁcial envi-
ronments. Current models on childhood development outline
the concept of a differential susceptibility to environment, i.e.,
some individuals are more susceptible than others to both negative
(risk-promoting) and positive (development-enhancing) environ-
mental conditions (116). Recent ﬁndings on Gene × ELS interac-
tions seem to conﬁrm the concept of differential susceptibility

(107, 117), which questions the classic diathesis–stress framework
as conceptual basis of past research. In this context, the identiﬁ-
cation of developmentally sensitive periods of brain maturation
will be of particular importance when it comes to prevention and
early intervention (118).

The existence of biologically distinguishable subtypes of
depression as a function of ELS is of importance in the response
to differential treatment (59). When comparing the effective-
ness of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the treatment of
depressed patients with and without childhood trauma distinct
patterns of treatment success were observed (119). In absence
of early trauma, combination treatment proved to be the most
effective treatment option, whereas in case of early trauma, remis-
sion rates were higher for psychotherapy than for pharmacological
treatment and combination therapy did not lead to any advan-
tage over the effects of psychotherapy alone. These differential
effects may be based on differences in neurobiological pathways to
depression, which need to be further elucidated (120).

Taken together, the latest research ﬁndings have underscored
the essential role of genotypes and epigenetic processes within
the development of depression after childhood trauma, thereby
building the basis for future research and clinical interventions.
