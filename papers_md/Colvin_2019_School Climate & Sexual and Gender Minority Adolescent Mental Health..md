Abstract

Sexual/gender minority (Sexual/gender minority people are also referred to as Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) youth are more likely than cisgender heterosexual youth to exhibit 
depressive symptoms and be victimized. School climate research indicates that the presence of 
a Gay–Straight Alliance (a Gay–Straight Alliance or Gender-Sexuality Alliance is also referred 
to as a GSA and is a youth group to support sexual/gender minority youth), a supportive school 
climate, and seeking help from teachers are associated with more positive mental health outcomes; 
however, they are not typically measured together. This study uses a survey that measures all four 
measures of school environment with a national sample of 240 sexual/gender minority high school 
students ages 14–18 (mean age 15.77) where 53% of participants had a Gay–Straight Alliance 
in their school. The sample is 53% cisgender, 100% sexual minority and 62% white. Adjusting 
for demographics and presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance, fewer depressive symptoms were 
associated with lower help-seeking intentions for suicidal thoughts. The presence of Gay–Straight 
Alliance was not statistically associated with past-month help-seeking intentions or behaviors. 
Additionally, a more supportive school climate was associated with lower anxiety and depressive 
symptoms. However, the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance was not statistically associated with 
anxiety or depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that a supportive school climate and 
supportive school personnel may be important for supporting the mental health of sexual/gender 
minority students.

Introduction

Page 2

Sexual/gender minority1 youth are more likely than their non-sexual/gender minority peers 
to exhibit anxiety and depressive symptoms, to consider suicide, and to be victimized 
because of their identities (Denny et al. 2016; Greytak et al. 2016; Kosciw et al. 2016). 
Sexual/gender minority youth (both in the U.S. and internationally) are also more likely to 
report that school is unwelcoming or unsafe because of unsupportive people and policies 
(Day and Russell 2018; Poteat et al. 2017). The Institute of Medicine’s 2011 report 
suggests that the wellbeing of sexual/gender minority youth can be better understood using 
approaches including a social-ecological approach (Bronfenbrenner 1979) that considers the 
many people and organizations that affect the life of youth (Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies 2011). Schools are one location where youth spend ample amounts of 
time. Thus, investigating the effects of supportive teachers and school environment could 
help identify areas for intervention and improvement.

School climate research indicates that higher school connectedness and connections with 
supportive adults are associated with improved mental health outcomes, but marginalized 
students do not always have the benefit of these relationships (Marraccini and Brier 2017). 
Gay–Straight Alliances2, spaces where sexual/gender minority youth can find social support 
and advocacy, and sexual/gender minority-inclusive policies are among the ways that U.S. 
public schools have tried to improve their climates with mixed effects for sexual/gender 
minority youth (Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network 2007; Ioverno et al. 2016; 
Mayberry 2013; Poteat et al. 2016). While the presence of Gay–Straight Alliances and 
school policies are external measures of school climate, student perceptions are even more 
important because they reflect the perceived culture and supportiveness of the school 
and teachers. This study explores the extent to which sexual/gender minority adolescents 
are supported by a positive school environment; specifically, how perceptions of the 
supportiveness of their high school is associated with their mental health.

Mental Health Risk for Sexual/Gender Minority Youth

Sexual/gender minority students are more likely to report having anxiety and depressive 
symptoms and having suicidal thoughts than their heterosexual and cisgender peers (Russell 
and Fish 2016). In the 2015 Youth Behavior Risk Survey, 60% of sexual minority 
youth reported feeling sad or hopeless compared to 26% of straight peers and 43% of 
sexual minority youth seriously considered suicide compared to 15% of straight peers 
(Zaza et al. 2016). In school, sexual/gender minority youth are more likely to experience 
homophobic and transphobic victimization and bullying which are associated with poor 
mental health outcomes (Coulter et al. 2018; Day and Russell 2018; Zaza et al. 2016). A 
study with transgender youth found that one in three experienced victimization and that 
this victimization significantly correlated with poor mental health and feelings of school 
belonging (Hatchel et al. 2019). Transgender students are also more likely to be truant, have 
lower grades and experience their school climate as unsupportive; feeling unsafe at school 

1Sexual/gender minority people are also referred to as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer.
2A Gay–Straight Alliance or Gender-Sexuality Alliance is also referred to as a GSA and is a youth group to support sexual/gender 
minority youth.

and substance abuse were among the top reasons for truancy (Day and Russell 2018). In fact, 
Heck et al. (2014) found that victimization mediates the relationship between school climate 
and mental health for sexual/gender minority students. These experiences of victimization 
can have long lasting effects on the wellbeing of students (Toomey and Russell 2013). The 
Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) 2015 climate survey (89.6% public 
schools; 28.1% urban; 44.5% suburban) found that both discrimination and victimization 
were associated with decreased wellbeing and increased anxiety and depressive symptoms in 
sexual/gender minority youth (Kosciw et al. 2016). Health disparities among sexual/gender 
minority students have been well established and highlight the need to identify.

School Climate

Studies done in California and Virginia have found that positive school climate included 
safety, connectedness, relationships with adults, opportunities for participation (Voight et 
al. 2015) as well as defined disciplinary structure, supportive teacher–student relationships, 
and high academic expectations (Konold et al. 2017). The California Healthy Kids Survey, 
an anonymous statewide survey asks questions about respect, fairness and participation 
(California Department of Education 2015, 2018; Furlong et al. 2005). In addition, many 
studies chose to focus on school connectedness which is defined as school community 
including supportive and inclusive policies, staff and, at times, the presence of a Gay 
Straight Alliance (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009; Diaz et al. 2010; 
Marraccini and Brier 2017). Having a clear understanding of which factors matter most 
to sexual/gender minority students would not only improve measurements, but would 
better inform policy. The following sections will outline measures of school climate, the 
importance of Gay–Straight Alliances, and supportive adults. Consideration of all factors are 
important in understanding why the overall school environment may affect the mental health 
of sexual/gender minority youth.

There are a few specific school factors that have been studied with sexual/gender minority 
youth. Adult support is one important factor. Unsupportive policies and a lack of staff 
support has been found to be associated with increased suicide risk in New Zealand and the 
U.K. (Denny et al. 2016; Rimes et al. 2018). Consistency and clarity in rule enforcement has 
also been associated with positive mental health outcomes for Dutch sexual minority youth 
(Sandfort et al. 2010). Other U.S. public school policy changes such as access to bathrooms 
for transgender students and inclusive polices about public displays of affection and gender 
norms are associated with positive outcomes for sexual/gender minority youth (Snapp et al. 
2015; Wernick et al. 2017).

Caring adults and a safe school environment have also been found to be associated with 
lower levels of suicide ideation (Eisenberg and Resnick 2006). A 2018 literature review 
found that, for all students, a positive school climate is associated with positive behavioral, 
academic, interpersonal and health (physical and mental) outcomes and increased school 
engagement. In addition, this review found that school involvement promoted school 
connectedness and that this connectedness was associated with positive mental health 
outcomes (Aldridge and Mcchesney 2018). School connectedness has been found to be 
particularly beneficial for sexual/gender minority youth. School connectedness and social

support can be protective factors for sexual/gender minority students and are associated with 
reduced suicide risk (Marraccini and Brier 2017; Whitaker et al. 2016).

Gay–Straight Alliances

Many studies also use the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance as a proxy for school climate, 
but some studies have shown that having a Gay–Straight Alliance is not enough to improve 
the experience of sexual/gender minority students (Marx and Kettrey 2016; Mayberry 2013). 
Gay–Straight Alliances can provide a sense of community for sexual/gender minority 
students as well as positive adult support and empowerment, but the presence of a Gay–
Straight Alliance is often paired with other environmental factors that affect sexual/gender 
minority youth (Ioverno et al. 2016; Marx and Hensman 2016).

Gay–Straight Alliances in schools have been associated with increased emotional safety 
and identity support for sexual/gender minority youth (Fetner and Elafros 2015; Ioverno et 
al. 2016; Mayberry 2013; Poteat et al. 2016). Active and visible Gay–Straight Alliances 
are also associated with increased school engagement for sexual/gender minority youth, 
even if they are not members (Seelman et al. 2015). A qualitative study of sexual/gender 
minority youth found that Gay–Straight Alliances provided community benefits—emotional 
and social support, sense of membership and fulfils needs of the members. Gay–Straight 
Alliances can also provide adult support and connection to a larger community and is a safe 
space (Porta et al. 2017). It seems that the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance is related 
to school climate in specific ways such as increased acceptance and visibility and adult 
support.

A study of high schools in Minnesota looked at bullying and related school factors. 
Lower incidence of bullying were associated with having a sexual/gender minority point 
person, displaying sexual/gender minority content in a positive and inclusive way, having 
a Gay–Straight Alliance, professional development around sexual/gender minority issues 
and openly discussing bullying with students (Gower et al. 2018). Sexual/gender minority 
students in schools that used these supports were less likely to be bullied. Both straight 
and sexual/gender minority students were bullied less when schools used more than one 
supportive practices. The authors suggest that when stakeholders at all levels engage in 
improving school climate, the effects are stronger (Gower et al. 2018). A school-based 
media program in British Columbia was associated with less bullying and less suicide 
ideation and higher school connectedness (Burk et al. 2018). Again, this intervention was 
implemented at a systemic level. The open dialog and cultural shifts had a positive effect for 
sexual/gender minority youth.

Supportive Adults

In addition to school connection, research suggests that supportive adults are important for 
sexual/gender minority youth. Having supportive adults available to sexual/gender minority 
youth is associated with higher school engagement (Seelman et al. 2015) and with lower 
levels of substance use (De Pedro et al. 2017). In a review of the literature, researchers found 
that support from peers and trusted adults was protective for the wellbeing of transgender 
students (Johns et al. 2018). An extension of specific supportive adults is supportive and

inclusive policies across schools. A Canadian study found that anti-homophobia policies 
can reduce harassment and shift heteronormative discourse can improve school climate 
(Peter et al. 2016). Several studies have found policies that overtly targeted homophobia 
and transphobia are associated with positive effects on student mental health and suicidality 
(Kull et al. 2016; Peter et al. 2016). One study found that implementing sexual/gender 
minority support such as visible displays, trained staff and professional development for 
teachers improved safety and climate for all students in the school (Gower et al. 2018). 
These types of policies can support cultural shifts and can be reflective of supportive adults 
within the school. They also challenge a normative climate of silence around sexual/gender 
minority issues and identity (Mayberry et al. 2013).

Help-Seeking Behavior

Willingness to seek help has been shown to be a protective factor against negative mental 
health outcomes (Hatchel, Ingram et al. 2019). Asking for help can help alleviate depressive 
symptoms and suicidal ideation but trusted adults are not always available to sexual/gender 
minority youth (Hatchel, Ingram et al. 2019). Low help-seeking beliefs in sexual/gender 
minority youth have been associated with increased suicide ideation and suicide attempts 
(Hatchel, Ingram et al. 2019). In addition to being at risk for poor mental health outcomes, 
sexual/gender minority youth may experience increased shame about asking for help 
(Hatchel, Ingram et al. 2019). The compounded stigma of their identity and that of poor 
mental health has been shown to lead students to normalize their distress and only ask for 
help when they reach a crisis point (McDermott 2015; McDermott et al. 2018). Willingness 
to report depressive symptoms and suicide ideation may be a reflection of openness to 
help-seeking in general (Hughes et al. 2018; Hatchel, Ingram et al. 2019) which makes 
the study of help-seeking beliefs and perceptions extremely important in this vulnerable 
population.

Framework for Current Study

This study uses a social-ecological framework to understand the associations of perceived 
school support, teacher support, and Gay–Straight Alliances on depressive symptoms and 
anxiety symptoms in sexual/gender minority students. Understanding the ecology of gender/
sexual minority students and the people and organizations that affect them can help identify 
productive areas for intervention. A review of socio-ecological models of development as 
it relates to bullying points to the need for research on the impact of school personnel and 
school policies on students (Espelage 2014).

Previous research has shown that school climate, in its various measurements, has a positive 
effect on sexual/gender minority youth (Coulter et al. 2016; De Pedro et al. 2018; Kosciw 
et al. 2009). Evidence suggests that school policies and inclusiveness affect not only the 
wellbeing of sexual/gender minority youth, but also their connection to adults who could 
support them. Successful interventions seem to take an organizational view of the school 
inclusivity and school climate in order to improve the experience of sexual/gender minority 
(Black et al. 2012; Jonathan Cohen 2013). This broad view of school environment includes 
aspects of safety, connection and belonging. School climate measures vary greatly so this 
study will consider a broad perspective and include specific aspects of the overall school

environment that could be considered and surveyed in order to understand the wellbeing of 
sexual/gender minority students.

If supportive adults are key to creating a supportive school environment for sexual/gender 
minority students (Mulcahy et al. 2016), then it is important to measure their perception of 
this support. Student perception, in this case, will be measured using help-seeking behaviors 
and intentions. This is a concrete way to explore whether or not students feel comfortable 
seeking support from teachers in their school.

Having a Gay–Straight Alliance seems to be strongly associated with the adult support 
present in the school. This fits in with existing literature on adult youth relationships and 
their positive developmental effects (Liang et al. 2008). In order to investigate the impact of 
having a Gay–Straight Alliance, it is included as a possible measure of school environment. 
It is possible that the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance is a reflection of peer and/or 
institutional support.

Sexual/gender minority student mental health seems to be greatly affected by the culture of 
the school as well as the presence of a group just for sexual/gender minority students (Day 
et al. 2016; Marx and Kettrey 2016). In addition, having supportive teachers as both mentors 
and advisors for Gay–Straight Alliances affects mental health (Bird et al. 2012; Mulcahy et 
al. 2016; Poteat and Scheer 2016). This model includes all factors into a working definition 
of school environment that might affect mental health.

Current Study

Previous research indicates that school climate is a key predictor for mental health outcomes 
in sexual/gender minority youth. The supportiveness of school personnel as well as the 
presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance are key indicators of a positive school climate. This 
study seeks to investigate how these elements relate separately and in concert to effect the 
depressive and anxiety symptoms of sexual/gender minority youth.

The primary research question was: What are the associations between the supportiveness 
of school environment and sexual/gender minority youth mental health? Specifically, how 
do the facets of school environment (school climate, presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance, 
and perceived teacher support) affect help-seeking behavior and mental health? Based on 
previous research, it follows that a positive school environment including supportive adults 
and supportive policies, would be associated with reduced depressive symptoms and anxiety 
symptoms. A Gay–Straight Alliance may be a facet of this supportive environment, but is 
likely not enough to affect student wellbeing on its own. Previous research on school climate 
indicates that the overall school culture is key to the well-being of sexual/gender minority 
youth. It follows that the well-being of sexual/gender minority students would be related to 
both the supportiveness of the school climate and the perceived support of the teachers.

Method

Recruitment

Measures

Page 7

This study is an analysis of de-identified baseline data collected as part of a randomized 
controlled trial of a game-based intervention for sexual/gender minority youth (Coulter et al. 
2019).

Participants were recruited between April and July 2018 using social media platforms, 
allowing youth from across the U.S. to enroll into the study. Researchers posted 
advertisements on Facebook, Instagram and sexual/gender minority-related online gaming 
groups. Specific ads were created and used to target underrepresented groups (see Coulter 
et al. 2019 for more detail; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03501264). Depending on the prior 
enrollment numbers, researchers tailored which ads were used for the upcoming week. 
Incentives, in the form of $10 gift cards, were sent via email.

Eligibility—Respondents were eligible if they: were English literate; lived in the U.S.; were 
14–18 years-old; had experienced bullying or cyberbullying victimization in the past year; 
identified as a sexual or gender minority; had a PC or Mac laptop or desktop computer 
where they could download the game; and had an email address. Email addresses were 
used to detect duplication and fraud. IP addresses were not collected in order to protect the 
anonymity of the participants.

Sample—240 participants completed the baseline survey and were enrolled into the 
randomized control trial (RCT) between April 2018 and July 2018. The sample 
characteristics are in Table 1. Of the 240 participants, 62% were white, 37% were cisgender 
(sex assigned at birth is the same as reported gender identity) boys and 54% reported that 
their school has a Gay–Straight Alliance. All participants identified as a sexual minority 
with 45% identifying as gay or lesbian.

School environment—The school climate construct used in this analysis was adapted 
from the California School Climate Survey and include questions about safety, diversity 
and respect and overall supportiveness (California Department of Education 2015). These 
questions are more general than the school connectedness constructs used in previous 
research (Diaz et al. 2010). This measure of cultural supportiveness along with perceived 
teacher support and help-seeking behavior will allow us to see the different aspects of 
the school environment that may affect mental health outcomes. Perceived support will be 
measured both in intention and behavior to explore the ways that students feel supported 
both in theory and practice.

School climate—Participants completed three items from the California School 
Climate Survey (California Department of Education 2015) that measured overall school 
environment for students. (This school is a supportive and inviting place for students to 
learn; This school fosters an appreciation of student diversity and respect; This school is 
a safe place for students.) For each statement, participants responded from 1 (Strongly

Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) on a 5-point Likert Scale. A mean score was used for 
analysis. The scale was internally consistent (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.90).

Presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance—Participants self-reported whether or not their 
school had a Gay–Straight Alliance. “Unsure” responses were added to “no” responses to 
create a binary variable.

Help-seeking intentions for personal problems—Help-seeking intentions were 
assessed using adapted version of the General Help-seeking Questionnaire (Wilson et al. 
2005). A set of questions assessed how likely participants are to seek help from a variety of 
sources about emotional problems. Sources of help included people (e.g., doctor, counselor) 
and places (e.g., websites). This study used only used the single items focused on teachers, 
in order to focus on school environment. (If you were having a personal or emotional 
problem, how likely is it that you would seek help from a teacher?) For each question, 
participants could respond from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 7 (extremely likely) on a 7-point 
Likert Scale.

Help-seeking intentions for suicidal thoughts—Help-seeking intentions were 
assessed using adapted version of the General Help-seeking Questionnaire (Wilson et al. 
2005). A set of questions assess how likely participants are to seek help from a variety of 
sources about suicidal ideation. Sources of help included people (e.g., doctor, counselor) 
and places (e.g., websites). This study used only used the single items focused on teachers, 
in order to focus on school environment. (If you were experiencing suicidal thoughts, how 
likely is it that you would seek help from a teacher?) For each question, participants could 
respond from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 7 (extremely likely) on a 7-point Likert Scale.

Help-seeking behaviors—Help-seeking behaviors were assessed using items adapted 
from the Help-Seeking Behaviors Scale (Pham et al. 2014). This study used only the 
teacher-related questions. (In the past month, how often have you… Asked a teacher for 
help? Talked to a teacher about personal problems? Talked to a teacher about problems at 
school?) For each question, participants could respond from 1 (never) to 5 (a great deal) 
in a 5-point Likert Scale. Help-Seeking Behavior is defined as a mean value of the three 
questions measuring their teacher help-seeking behavior in the last month. (Alpha = 0.82).

Anxiety—Past-week anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Severity Measure for 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder—Child Age 11–17 (American Psychiatric Association 2013; 
Lebeau et al. 2012), which contains 10 items used to calculate a mean score (alpha = 0.89). 
Response options use a 5-point scale from “never” to “all of the time,” with a higher mean 
score indicating greater anxiety symptoms.

Depressive symptoms—Past-week depressive symptoms were assessed using the 
Patient Health Questionairre-9 for children ages 11–17 (Johnson et al. 2002), which contains 
9 items used to calculate a mean score (alpha = 0.89). Response options use a 4-point 
scale from “not at all” to “nearly every day,” with a higher mean score indicating greater 
depressive symptoms.

Gender—Gender is defined using the two-step process assessing current gender identity 
and sex assigned at birth (Gender Identity in U.S. Surveillance (GenIUSS) Group 2014). 
These measures combined to create six gender categories: Cisgender girls (participant 
identifies as female and was assigned female at birth), Cisgender boys (participant identifies 
as male and was assigned male at birth), Transgender girls (participant identifies as male 
but was not assigned male at birth), Transgender girls (participant identifies as female but 
was not assigned female at birth), Nonbinary AFAB (participant identifies as neither male 
nor female but was assigned female at birth) and Nonbinary AMAB (participant identifies as 
neither male nor female but was assigned male at birth).

Sexual orientation—Sexual orientation was defined by three questions assessing sexual 
attraction, behavior, and identity. These measures combined to create five sexual orientation 
categories: Gay/Lesbian, Bisexual, Queer, Another Identity (write-ins included “other” and 
identities that were not listed), Multiple Identities (those participants who selected more than 
one option to describe their identity).

Other demographics—Demographic variables included age, race/ethnicity, and 
eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch at school.

All data analysis was performed using Stata. The analyses included two sets of linear 
regressions to test the relationship between school environment and mental health. 
Prior research indicates that help-seeking behavior is important for youth who are in 
psychological distress (McDermott 2015). The first set of regression analyses focused 
on help-seeking intentions and behaviors and its predictors, including school climate and 
demographic covariates. The second set of regressions focused on depressive and anxiety 
symptoms and their predictors, including school climate and demographic covariates. All 
models controlled for demographics including gender identity, sexual orientation, race, age, 
and whether or not the participant was eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch. There is little 
missing data in this sample. One participant did not answer the question about intending to 
seek help from a teacher for a personal problem. All other data is complete.

Power—After adjusting for socio-demographics, with N = 240 subjects, α = 0.05, power of 
0.99, we are able to detect medium effect sizes; after adjusting for socio-demographics, with 
N = 240 subjects, α = 0.05, power of 0.48, we do not have enough power to detect small 
effect sizes (Jacob Cohen 1988).

The sample is described in Table 1. The participants were aged 14–18 (mean =15.77), 
majority white (62.1%), 100% sexual minority, and 53% cisgender. In order to explore the 
relationship between the measures of school environment and mental health symptoms, a 
correlation matrix (Table 2) was constructed. Anxiety symptoms are significantly negatively 
correlated with the school climate measure (supportiveness and safety) and help-seeking 
intentions for suicidal thoughts (p < 0.05). Depressive symptoms are significantly negatively 
correlated with the school climate measure (supportiveness and safety) and help-seeking

intentions for both personal problems and suicidal thoughts (p < 0.05). The presence of a 
Gay–Straight Alliance is only significantly correlated with school climate (supportiveness 
and safety) and not with the mental health outcomes.

Two linear regression analyses explore the relationship between the measures of school 
environment and mental health symptoms. The first analysis explores the predictors for 
help-seeking behavior and intentions. These measures are not typically included in measures 
of school environment so this analysis was intended to determine if it was a good predictor 
of mental health symptoms and other measures of school environment. Interaction effects 
between school climate (supportiveness and safety) and the presence of a GSA did not 
provide significant findings.

The results from the first series of regressions are in Table 3. Adjusting for demographics 
and presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance, lower depressive symptoms were associated with 
help-seeking intentions for suicidal thoughts (0.17, p < 0.05). However, school climate 
(supportiveness and safety) was not statistically associated with help-seeking intentions for 
personal problems or help-seeking behaviors. The presence of Gay–Straight Alliance was 
not statistically associated with help-seeking intentions or help-seeking behaviors in the last 
month. Compared with cisgender girls, cisgender boys (0.39, p < 0.05) and transgender girls 
(0.93, p < 0.01) were more likely to report intentions to seek help for suicidal thoughts.

The results from the second series of regressions are in Table 4. Controlling for 
demographics and presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance, a more positive school climate 
(supportiveness and safety) was associated with lower anxiety (0.13 points on a 4-point 
scale; β =−0.14, p < 0.05) and depressive symptoms (0.13 points on a 3-point scale; β 
=−0.13, p < 0.05). However, the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance was not significantly 
associated with anxiety or depressive symptoms. As shown in Table 4, greater intentions 
to seek help for suicidal thoughts was associated lower number of depressive symptoms 
(0.17 points of a 3-point scale; β =−0.17, p < 0.05), but not statistically associated with 
anxiety symptoms. Help-seeking behavior in the last month and intentions to seek help from 
teachers for personal problems were not statistically associated with anxiety or depressive 
symptoms.

Discussion

There are large mental health disparities for sexual/gender minority youth including 
increased anxiety and depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts (Kosciw et al. 2016). 
School environment is an important factor for the wellbeing sexual/gender minority 
high school students. Social-ecological theory places school personnel and policies in a 
fundamental place in the ecology of student life (Espelage 2014). There are many ways to 
measure school environment including safety, supportiveness and diversity (Furlong et al. 
2005). Previous studies have found that adult and organizational support are also important 
for the wellbeing of sexual/gender minority students (Black et al. 2012; Mulcahy et al. 
2016). In addition, many studies have identified the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance to 
be associated with more positive mental health of sexual/gender minority students (Marx 
and Kettrey 2016). This study brings all of these aspects together in one sample and provides

a way to explore the important aspects of school environment and the ways that they affect 
mental health symptoms.

The measure of school climate used in this analysis was made up of questions about 
supportiveness, safety and diversity. Students who reported a more positive school climate 
on this measure were less likely to report anxiety or depressive symptoms. While the school 
climate measure (supportiveness and safety) was associated with mental health outcomes, 
the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance was not. Intentions to seek help for suicidal 
thoughts was associated with a positive school climate which may reflect the supportiveness 
of the school personnel. School climate measures vary greatly and a closer examination of 
the facets of this concept are necessary in order to understand how to support the mental 
health of sexual/gender minority youth.

This sample is unique in that it captured youth with a diversity of sexual/gender identities 
and asked many questions related to wellbeing and school climate. With access to a sample 
of youth who all identify as sexual/gender minority, we were able to explore the important 
aspects of school climate. Many surveys ask about only one aspect of school climate such as 
school connectedness, safety or the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance (Gay Lesbian and 
Straight Education Network 2007; Marx and Kettrey 2016; Zaza et al. 2016). Depending on 
the scale, this may reflect perceived safety, diversity and acceptance, but it does not always 
reflect the organizational supports of the school, the effectiveness of the Gay–Straight 
Alliance and the supportiveness of the adults within the school. Previous research has 
shown that school climate is key to supporting sexual/gender minority youth (Aldridge and 
Mcchesney 2018; Denny et al. 2016; Heck et al. 2011; Riekie et al. 2017), but there are 
many aspects of school climate that could be further explored.

More than half of the participants in this sample reported that their high school had a Gay–
Straight Alliance (54%), but the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance was not correlated 
with mental health outcomes, nor was it a significant predictor of help-seeking behavior. 
The presence of Gay–Straight Alliances have been widely studied in the literature as a way 
to support sexual/gender minority (Fetner and Elafros 2015; Mayberry et al. 2013; Russell 
et al. 2009; Toomey et al. 2011) but these results point to the presence of a Gay–Straight 
Alliance as being associated with but not a proxy for school climate. It seems that having 
a Gay–Straight Alliance is not enough to indicate a supportive school environment for this 
sample.

On the other hand, positive school climate was associated with positive mental health. There 
seems to be an interesting logical system at play where schools with positive environments 
are likely to have a Gay–Straight Alliance, but that having a Gay–Straight Alliance alone 
does not predict mental health outcomes for youth. Qualitative inquiry could help untangle 
what youth thought of the effectiveness or supportiveness of their high school Gay–Straight 
Alliances. It is possible that some Gay–Straight Alliances do not make up for a negative 
overall school culture.

More positive school climate is associated with increased help-seeking behavior for suicidal 
thoughts among the youth in this sample. Interestingly, the same is not true for help-seeking

for emotional or personal problems. Research suggests that sexual/gender minority youth 
tend to turn to friends for support with mental health issues while relatively few sought 
support from school personnel (Lytle et al. 2018). These findings support the thought 
that help-seeking intentions may be generally higher when suicidal ideation is present 
(Michelmore and Hindley 2012). This could indicate that while students felt they could go to 
school personnel when in crisis, they did not intend to ask for help for less critical issues.

It is also possible that youth seek out teachers for help only when feeling desperate. This 
could reflect the stigma associated with mental health and sexual/gender minority identity 
(McDermott et al. 2018). It is also possible that youth are asking peers for help for less 
critical matters and only approach teachers when feeling desperate. Intentions for seeking 
help for suicidal thoughts is also associated with fewer depressive symptoms. This could 
have implications for schools because depressed students are at risk and could be at even 
more risk if they are reluctant to ask for help.

This study is not without limitations. First, the sample was relatively small and the power 
analysis found only enough power to detect medium effects. In order to detect smaller 
effects, additional research is needed with larger samples. Additionally, the measure of 
school climate used here was only three questions about supportiveness, respect and safety. 
These questions were very broad so it is unclear what aspects were most important to the 
participants. A more detailed scale could illuminate the key components of school climate. 
In addition, participants were recruited from social media and gaming sites and not from 
high schools. Little information was collected on the type of schools participants attended 
(for the sake of anonymity) so it is unclear whether this sample is representative of sexual/
gender minority youth. Key questions would include the urbanicity of the school’s location 
as well as its relative size, funding, affiliation and mission. All data was self-reported 
which could present bias. Youth perspectives are important to understanding how school 
climate affects mental health, but additional information from school personnel would help 
triangulate the perspectives and give a deeper understanding of the school climate.

Future research should focus on exploring the facets of school climate with a more 
comprehensive measure. While the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance is a convenient 
measure, it does not capture the overall culture of the school which seems to be important 
for the wellbeing of sexual/gender minority youth (Fetner and Elafros 2015; Mayberry 2013; 
Russell et al. 2009; Toomey and Russell 2011). In the interest of learning more about 
the schools, surveys should ask about supportiveness of the school as well as the specific 
people within the school. It would be interesting to know if the teachers referred to in this 
study are the faculty mentors for the Gay–Straight Alliance, school counselors or another 
person. It would also be beneficial to know if students feel that they could go to multiple 
people within the school, especially when experiencing suicidal ideation. In addition to 
improving measures, future research should explore the variation within the sexual/gender 
minority youth community. It is likely that transgender students and sexual/gender minority 
of color have unique needs (Mcguire et al. 2010; Poteat and Scheer 2016). In order to create 
beneficial interventions, these should must be identified and explored.

Survey studies are important for this vulnerable population because they protect anonymity 
and reach a wide population. However, due to the anonymous nature of the study, there is no 
way to know where the participants live or what type of school they attend. Qualitative 
interviews could illuminate the intricacies of school supportiveness and sexual/gender 
minority youth mental health. This type of data could inform future surveys as well as 
interventions.

The sample was also made up of youth who had experienced bullying in the last year. 
Therefore the results of this study are only generalizable to sexual/gender minority students 
who experienced bullying. On the one hand, this is a limitation, but 33% of sexual minority 
students report being bullied at school (compared with 17% of heterosexual students) so 
there is a high likelihood that sexual/gender minority students in any school experience some 
kind of bullying (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017). Future studies could 
focus on a broader sample.

Future research should look at the specifics of the school environments such as urbanicity, 
resources, teacher demographics and policies. This, accompanied by youth interviews could 
give a clear picture of the specific risk and protective factors for sexual/gender minority 
youth. Understanding youth perspective is of primary concern, but the school context is 
also extremely important. Once risk and protective factors are identified, they can inform 
recommendations for future policies and measurement tools.

Conclusion

Sexual/gender minority youth experience significant mental health disparities. School 
environment can support mental health outcomes such as anxiety and depressive symptoms. 
Many studies have looked at the presence of a Gay–Straight Alliance as a proxy for a 
positive school environment. This is an incomplete picture of school environment and the 
accompanying risk and protective factors for sexual/gender minority youth. The results 
of this study point to a complex relationships between the high school environment and 
the mental well-being of sexual/gender minority youth. It is clear that school climate is 
important for the mental health of sexual/gender minority youth, but it is unclear what 
specific mechanism is in play. For these reasons, schools should be cautious about making 
policy changes or creating groups like Gay–Straight Alliances without addressing the overall 
culture and supportiveness of the school and its personnel. There are many facets of a 
school’s environment that could play into sexual/gender minority youth mental health such 
as supportiveness of teachers and overall diversity and respect. It is especially important that 
youth feel they have support when in crisis, so having supportive adults will be an important 
consideration. Adolescents are actively developing their identities along with their cognitive 
and social skills. It will be important to learn more about the type of support that a school 
environment could provide its most vulnerable students.

Gender was defined based on two questions: gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Cisgender boys and girls were defined as those who 
identified as the same gender as their sex assigned at birth. Transboys were defined as those who identified as “transboy” as well as those who 
identified as boy but were assigned female at birth. Transgirls were defined as those who identified as “transgirl” as well as those who identified as 
girl but were assigned male at birth. Nonbinary was defined as those who chose genderqueer, nonbinary or another gender as their gender identity. 
AFAB indicates Assigned Female at Birth and AMAB indicates Assigned Male at Birth
