Abstract 
Background  Mindfulness and compassion training have individually shown significant effects on health care profes-
sionals’ (HCPs’) skills, reducing stress, anxiety, and burnout. This study evaluated the impact of a combined mindful-
ness and self-compassion intervention on HCPs’ wellness.

Methods  Seventeen nurses and doctors at a teaching university hospital in France volunteered for the Mindfulness-
Based Compassion and Resilience Enhancement (MBCARE) program, a four-week mindfulness and self-compassion 
training delivered in eight three-hour sessions over four days (one day per week), with 100% attendance. We collected 
primary data (mindfulness skills, burnout scores, self-compassion, and emotional coping via face-reader evaluations) 
before and after the intervention.

Results  MBCARE was associated with reduced burnout, with emotional exhaustion scores decreasing (MΔ = -4.27, 
t = 1.95, p = .04) and personal accomplishment scores increasing (MΔ = 2.73, z = 2.48, p = .007) among 12 health care 
professionals. Patient-perceived centeredness of care showed a ceiling effect, with no significant changes. In a socio-
affective video task (n = 7), positive affect increased post-training (p < .05), while negative affect remained stable. Time 
and availability constraints limited participation, but the program was feasible. Professional contextualization may 
support skill application, potentially improving emotional regulation and self-compassion, though further research 
is needed to confirm these effects.

Conclusions  Implementing mindfulness and compassion training for HCPs faces time and availability constraints 
but meets their needs. Contextualizing the training to professional settings enhances HCPs’ ability to apply new skills, 
yielding benefits in emotional stability and self-compassion.

Background
Physician  burnout,  a  work-related  syndrome  involving 
emotional  exhaustion,  depersonalization,  and  reduced 
personal  accomplishment,  has  reached  epidemic  levels 
worldwide.  Despite  definitional  debates,  burnout  per-
vades health care providers (HCPs), affecting physicians, 
nurses, pharmacists, and students through stress, detach-
ment,  and  poor  job  satisfaction. The  SARS-CoV-  2  pan-
demic  exacerbated  these  issues,  unlike  in  fields  like  the 
military, where stress resilience training is standard.

In France, burnout rates range from 38 to 52% among 
physicians  and  21%  among  nurses  with  five  years’  expe-
rience  [1,  2].  Burnout  correlates  with  sleep  deprivation, 
increased  medical  errors,  and  poorer  care  quality.  A 
meta-analysis  of  47  studies  on  42,473  physicians  found 
burnout doubles the odds of unsafe care, unprofessional 
behavior,  and  low  patient  satisfaction  [3],  a  trend  also 
observed in nurses.

Patient-centered  care,  emphasizing  patients’  values, 
needs,  and  desires,  relies  on  effective  communication, 
partnership, and health promotion, yielding benefits like 
improved satisfaction and fewer diagnostic tests. Its five 
components—biopsychosocial  perspective,  patient-as-
person,  shared  power,  therapeutic  alliance,  and  doctor-
as-person—require training and HCP wellness. However, 
delivering  such  care  demands  emotional  resilience  and 
empathy, qualities eroded by burnout, suggesting a need 
for  interventions  like  mindfulness  training  to  support 
both HCP well-being and patient care quality.

Mindfulness-Based  Compassion 

and  Resilience 
Enhancement  program  (MBCARE),  is  a  training  com-
bining  mindfulness  and  self-compassion  contextualized 
for professional settings, as has been proposed (as a tai-
lored  intervention  for  HCPs)  in  our  previous  article  [4]. 
This program characterizes by a combination of exercises 
and  approaches  based  on  the  Mindfulness  Based  Stress 
Reduction Program and the Self Compassion program.

Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR),  devel-
oped  by  Kabat-Zinn  in  the  1970  s,  enhances  well-being, 
reduces  stress,  and  boosts  empathy  among  HCPs  [9]. 
Self-compassion,  defined  as  treating  oneself  with  kind-
ness, recognizing shared human struggles, and maintain-
ing mindful awareness during distress [6], reduces anxiety 
and  increases  life  satisfaction.  Combining  mindfulness, 
which  enhances  present-moment  awareness  and  stress 
reduction, with self-compassion, which fosters emotional 
resilience and self-care, addresses both external pressures 
(e.g., patient suffering) and internal challenges (e.g., self-
criticism under stress). This dual approach aims to reduce 
burnout while enhancing patient-centered care, a synergy 
not  fully  captured  by  standalone  interventions.  Given 
the  high  burnout  rates  among  French  HCPs  (38%–52% 
for physicians, 21% for nurses), we selected MBCARE to 

address both burnout and patient-centered care in a sin-
gle intervention. While mindfulness-based programs like 
MBSR are widely studied, MBCARE’s unique integration 
of  self-compassion  and  professional  contextualization 
remains underexplored, particularly among HCPs in aca-
demic hospitals. This study is, to our knowledge, the first 
to evaluate MBCARE’s impact in this setting.

Methods
This  study  investigated  the  Mindfulness-Based  Com-
passion  and  Resilience  Enhancement  (MBCARE)  pro-
gram’s  impact  on  volunteering  HCPs.  Participants  were 
recruited  via  a  newsletter  from  Assistance  Publique-
Hôpitaux de Paris, advertising mental training to reduce 
stress  and  improve  care  quality.  All  provided  informed 
consent  for  the  associated  research,  unaware  of  specific 
content  until  pre-testing. The  program  was  free,  offered 
at  an  academic  teaching  hospital  in  Paris,  France,  with 
an  information  session  outlining  content  and  evaluation 
methods.

Participant selection

Participants  were  included  if  they  were  HCPs  (nurses, 
doctors,  or  other  staff )  at  Assistance  Publique-Hôpi-
taux  de  Paris,  volunteered  via  the  newsletter,  and  con-
firmed availability for all four sessions. Exclusion criteria 
included  prior  experience  with  mindfulness  or  compas-
sion training, current psychiatric conditions, addictions, 
or  use  of  psychiatric  medications,  assessed  during  pre-
training interviews.

Twenty-three applicants were enrolled (17 nurses/doc-
tors, 6 other HCPs), with no dropouts. For homogeneity, 
only nurses and doctors (n = 17) were analyzed; of these, 
12 completed all questionnaires due to time constraints, 
and  7  participated  in  the  Socio-Affective  Video  Task 
(SOVT) based on availability. See Fig. 1 for a recruitment 
flowchart.

Intervention

The  MBCARE  program  was  a  four-week  intervention 
consisting  of  eight  three-hour  sessions  delivered  over 
four days (one day per week, totaling 24 h), supplemented 
by  30  min  of  daily  guided  meditation.  Two  groups  were 
trained based on availability: Group 1 (May 22, 29, June 5, 
12, 2018) and Group 2 (June 8, 15, 22, 29, 2018). Built on 
MBSR,  MBCARE  incorporated  Mindfulness-Based  Self-
Compassion  and  Compassion-Focused  Therapy,  contex-
tualized for HCP stressors [4]. Three teachers, each with 
over  10  years  of  personal  mindfulness  practice  and  cer-
tified in MBSR or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT),  delivered  the  program  in  pairs,  uninvolved  in 
the research.

Results
Effects of the MBCARE program on burnout

Emotional  exhaustion  scores  decreased  post-MBCARE 
(M = 20.91, SD = 9.26 pre-training; M = 16.64, SD = 9.36 
post-training;  t(11)  = 1.95,  p =  0.04),  with  two  partici-
pants previously at high risk (> 30) no longer meeting this 
threshold. Personal accomplishment scores increased (M 
= 40.00,  SD  = 4.73  pre-training;  M =  42.73,  SD  = 4.73 
post-training;  z =  2.48,  p =  0.007),  with  two  participants 
previously  at  high  risk  (<  33)  no  longer  meeting  this 
threshold.  These  findings  are  based  on  12  participants 
who completed all questionnaires, and no control group 
was included (Table 1).

Effects on patient‑centered relationships

High mean scores across all Consultation Care Measure 
dimensions  showed  a  ceiling  effect,  with  no  significant 
changes (Table 2).

Effects on mindfulness skills

No significant change was observed in Five Facets Mind-
fulness Questionnaire scores (Table 3).

Measures
Participants  (n =  12)  completed  pre-  and  post-interven-
tion questionnaires:

•  Burnout:  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory–Human  Ser-
vice  Survey  (French  version;  within-subject  design), 
assessing emotional exhaustion and personal accom-
plishment  (depersonalization  omitted  due  to  poor 
internal consistency).

•  Mindfulness:  Five  Facets  Mindfulness  Questionnaire 

French version; [23]

•  Self-Compassion: Self-Compassion Scale (French ver-
sion) CC BY 4.0, 26 items across six subscales [24].
•  Patient-Centeredness:  Consultation  Care  Measure 
[21]  completed  by  patients  pre-  and  post-program 
(between-subjects  design),  translated  and  back-
translated from French.

•  Emotional  Coping:  SOVT  [8]  exposed  7  HCPs  to 
high-  and  low-emotion  videos  (10–18  s)  (Logitech 
Brio  Ultra  HD4  K,  30  cm  distance,  5–30  frames/s, 
1920  × 1080).  Facial  expressions  were  coded  using 
FaceReader  software  (Noldus),  which  automatically 
analyzes  video  frames  for  valence  (positive/negative 
affect) and arousal based on the ‘Western’ model with 
continuous  calibration.  To  mitigate  practice  effects

In the Socio-Affective Video Task (n = 7), positive affect 
scores  increased  post-training  (M  = 4.65,  SD  = 4.42 
pre-training;  M =  10.97,  SD  = 10.89  post-training;  p < 
0.05), while negative affect scores showed no change (M 
= 57.65,  SD  = 27.83  pre-training;  M =  60.21,  SD  = 15.22 
post-training; p = NS) (Table 5). A mixed-model ANOVA 
indicated  a  stimulus  × order  effect  on  valence  (F(1,3) 
= 41.78,  p =  0.007,  η2 =  0.93),  suggesting  more  positive 
emotional responses post-training. These results are pre-
liminary due to the small subsample and lack of a control 
condition (Fig. 2).

Discussion
This study suggests that the Mindfulness-Based Compas-
sion  and  Resilience  Enhancement  (MBCARE)  program 
is  feasible  and  may  contribute  to  reducing  burnout  and 
enhancing self-compassion and emotional coping among 
health  care  professionals  (HCPs)  in  a  hospital  setting. 
The  observed  reduction  in  emotional  exhaustion  (MΔ 
= − 4.27, p = 0.04) and increase in personal accomplish-
ment  (MΔ  = 2.73,  p =  0.007)  align  with  prior  mindful-
ness-based  interventions  [5],  though  the  small  sample 
(n = 12 for questionnaires, n = 7 for SOVT) and absence 
of  a  control  group  limit  causal  inferences.  The  increase 
in  positive  affect  during  the  Socio-Affective  Video  Task 
(p  <  0.05)  is  consistent  with  compassion  training  effects 
[8],  but  requires  validation  with  larger  samples.  The 
lack of improvement in mindfulness skills (p = NS) may 

reflect  the  program’s  brief  four-week  duration,  suggest-
ing  a  longer  intervention  could  yield  broader  effects. 
MBCARE’s  contextualization  to  professional  scenarios 
likely supported skill application, as participants reported 
using  techniques  in  workplace  challenges,  though  this 
anecdotal 
feedback  warrants  systematic  evaluation. 
Given  the  small  scale  and  preliminary  nature  of  these

and Post-training (M = 0.080, SD = 0.24), based on Socio-Affective 
Video Task (n = 7). Error bars reflect standard deviations, and results 
should be interpreted cautiously due to the small subsample

findings,  MBCARE  shows  potential  as  an  intervention 
for  HCPs,  but  its  efficacy  and  scalability  require  further 
investigation.

The  contextualization  of  MBCARE’s  meditation  exer-
cises  to  professional  scenarios  (e.g.,  patient-caregiver 
conflicts, inter-staff tensions) likely facilitated skill trans-
fer,  distinguishing  it  from  generic  MBSR  programs. 
This approach may enhance ecological validity, as HCPs 
reported applying techniques directly to workplace chal-
lenges, a finding consistent with Lamothe et al. [10], who 
noted  contextualized  mindfulness  training  improved 
nurses’ job satisfaction more than standard protocols (p < 
0.05). The absence of adverse events, likely due to expert 
instructors and pre-screening, aligns with Goodman and 
Schorling  [11],  who  found  no  significant  side  effects  in 
mindfulness  interventions  for  HCPs  when  delivered  by 
experienced  facilitators.  However,  time  constraints—
highlighted  by  participants’  limited  availability—suggest 
a  longer  format  could  deepen  mindfulness  benefits,  as 
seen  in  West  et  al.  [12],  where  a  10-week  intervention 

Charvin et al. BMC Psychology          (2025) 13:523 

Page 5 of 6

yielded  greater  stress  reduction  (ΔM  = −  6.8)  than 
shorter  programs.  MBCARE’s  significant  self-compas-
sion gains (ΔM = 19.98, p < 0.05) may reflect its empha-
sis on self-kindness, a mechanism [5, 12] links to reduced 
self-criticism  and  improved  resilience  under  stress. This 
could  explain  the  increased  positive  affect  in  SOVT,  as 
self-compassion  may  reframe  emotional  responses  to 
others’  suffering,  reducing  empathic  distress—a  com-
mon burnout precursor [14]. As holistic care gains trac-
tion globally, integrating such mind–body skills into HCP 
training  could  enhance  both  provider  well-being  and 
patient outcomes, a shift supported by Epstein and Street 
[15],  who  advocate  for  clinician  self-awareness  as  a  cor-
nerstone of patient-centered care.

Despite these strengths, MBCARE’s brief duration and 
small  sample  highlight  areas  for  refinement. The  lack  of 
mindfulness  skill  improvement  contrasts  with  longer 
interventions like Cohen-Katz et al. [16], where an eight-
week  MBSR  program  for  nurses  increased  mindfulness 
scores  by  12  points  (p  <  0.001),  suggesting  that  extend-
ing MBCARE to 8–10 weeks could yield broader benefits. 
The significant emotional coping findings, however, align 
with  Singer  and  Klimecki  [17],  who  propose  that  com-
passion  training  shifts  affective  responses  from  distress 
to prosocial motivation, a mechanism potentially ampli-
fied by MBCARE’s professional focus. This study’s ceiling 
effect  in  patient-centeredness  scores  (Table  2)  mirrors 
Stewart  et  al.  [18],  where  high  baseline  patient  satisfac-
tion  limited  detectable  change,  indicating  a  need  for 
more  sensitive  measures  in  future  trials. The  absence  of 
a  control  group  and  reliance  on  self-selected  volunteers 
further  temper  conclusions,  as  motivated  participants 
may  overestimate  benefits—a  bias  noted  in  mindfulness 
research  by  Baer  [22].  Nonetheless,  MBCARE’s  feasibil-
ity in a real-world hospital setting, coupled with its burn-
out  reduction,  supports  its  potential  scalability.  Future 
research could explore its mechanisms (e.g., via neuroim-
aging, as in Desbordes et al., 20) and test it across diverse 
HCP populations, such as rural practitioners or non-clin-
ical staff, to broaden its impact.

Limitations

This study has several limitations that constrain its find-
ings. The small sample (n = 17 nurses/doctors, with n = 
12  for  questionnaires  and  n =  7  for  the  Socio-Affective 
Video  Task)  limits  statistical  power  and  generalizabil-
ity  to  broader  HCP  populations.  The  absence  of  a  con-
trol  group  prevents  definitive  attribution  of  outcomes 
to  MBCARE,  as  observed  changes  could  reflect  placebo 
effects, regression to the mean, or external factors. Self-
selected volunteers, recruited via a newsletter, may have 
been  more  motivated  or  predisposed  to  mindfulness 
practices, potentially inflating perceived benefits—a bias 

common  in  mindfulness  research  [22].  The  four-week 
duration,  shorter  than  standard  eight-week  programs 
like  MBSR,  likely  limited  mindfulness  skill  develop-
ment, as evidenced by non-significant changes in mind-
fulness  scores.  The  one-month  follow-up  may  not 
capture sustained effects or detect delayed benefits, such 
as  improved  patient  outcomes.  Additionally,  the  ceiling 
effect  in  patient-centeredness  scores  suggests  the  meas-
ure  may  lack  sensitivity  to  detect  subtle  changes  in  this 
context,  and  the  reliance  on  self-reports  for  most  out-
comes  risks  response  bias.  These  constraints  highlight 
the  preliminary  nature  of  the  findings  and  the  need  for 
caution in interpreting MBCARE’s impact.

Future directions

Larger,  controlled  trials  should  confirm  MBCARE’s  effi-
cacy,  extend  follow-up  to  assess  long-term  impacts, 
and  test  its  applicability  across  diverse  HCP  roles  and 
settings.

Conclusion
Burnout among health care professionals (HCPs) under-
scores the need for effective interventions, and the Mind-
fulness-Based  Compassion  and  Resilience  Enhancement 
(MBCARE)  program  offers  a  potential  approach.  This 
study  suggests  that  a  brief,  contextualized  mindfulness 
and self-compassion training may help reduce emotional 
exhaustion (p = 0.04), increase personal accomplishment 
(p = 0.007), and support emotional resilience when con-
fronting others’ suffering (p < 0.05) among a small group 
of HCPs (n = 12–17). However, the small sample, lack of 
a  control  group,  and  short  duration  limit  the  ability  to 
draw definitive conclusions about its efficacy. MBCARE’s 
professional  focus  may  facilitate  skill  application,  but 
broader  validation  is  needed  to  confirm  its  impact.  By 
fostering  tools  to  navigate  workplace  stress,  MBCARE 
could  contribute  to  HCP  well-being  and  patient  care, 
pending  further  research  to  establish  its  scalability  and 
long-term effects.

While  further  refinement  and  broader  validation  are 
warranted, this work lays a foundation for a future where 
caregiver  well-being  is  as  sacrosanct  as  patient  care—
a  vision  where  resilience  and  compassion,  cultivated 
within, radiate outward to heal both healer and healed.
