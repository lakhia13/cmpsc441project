Abstract

Purpose:  Transgender adolescents (TGAs) have high risk for experiencing mental health 
problems, but little is known about how aspects of gender identity relate to their mental health 
symptoms. Evidence from child and adult samples of transgender individuals indicates making 
progress in gender transition milestones and higher levels of congruence between gender identity 
and gender expression are related to fewer mental health problems. We examined associations 
between perceived transition progress, gender congruence, and mental health symptoms in a 
diverse, nationwide sample of TGAs.

Methods:  TGAs (n = 1,943) participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Perceived gender 
transition progress, gender congruence, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed. 
Path analysis was conducted to examine whether transition progress was related to mental health 
symptoms via higher levels of gender congruence.

Results:  Most TGAs had undertaken at least one social transition step (98%), but only 11% 
had taken medical transition steps. Higher gender congruence was associated with lower mental 
health symptoms. Greater transition progress was associated with higher gender congruence, 
and perceived transition progress evidenced negative indirect associations with mental health 
symptoms. TGAs identifying with binary identities (transmasculine and transfeminine youth) 
reported lower levels of transition progress and gender congruence compared to other subgroups 
of TGAs.

Discussion:  Higher levels of perceived transition progress and gender congruence are related to 
lower mental health symptoms among TGAs. Mental health interventions tailored to the unique 
developmental needs of TGAs are needed given high risk for mental health problems within this 
population, and interventions addressing transition progress and gender congruence should be 
examined.

Transgender adolescents (TGAs; adolescents whose gender identity is different than their 
sex assigned at birth) experience higher rates of mental health problems as compared to 
their cisgender peers (adolescents whose gender identity is aligned with their sex assigned 
at birth) [1–6]. TGAs have elevated risk for experiencing depressive symptoms during 
adolescence [1,3,5], and researchers have estimated that 83% of TGAs experience depressed 
mood [5]. Furthermore, over half of TGAs meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder 
[1]. Similarly, TGAs are more likely than their peers to experience problematic levels of 
anxiety during adolescence [1,7], and 37%–48% of TGAs meet criteria for an anxiety 
disorder [1,8].

TGAs experience multiple stressors during childhood and adolescence which could increase 
their susceptibility to experiencing depressive and anxiety symptoms during adolescence. 
TGAs are more likely to experience peer victimization and low parental support than their 
cisgender peers, may have to endure school policies that exclude them from certain activities 
or gender-appropriate facilities at school, and often experience distress from incongruence 
between their gender expression and their gender identity, all of which could contribute to 
their risk for experiencing mental health problems during adolescence [3,8–11]. Importantly, 
many TGAs undergo gender transition during adolescence. Taking social transition steps is 
common among TGAs during adolescence, including disclosing gender identity to parents 
and peers, using pronouns and a name that align with their true gender identity, and 
changing their hairstyle or clothing [2]. A small proportion of TGAs also begin medical 
transition steps during adolescence, including beginning hormone replacement therapy 
and/or undergoing gender affirming surgeries (e.g., breast reduction) [12]. Making progress 
through gender transition milestones has the potential to reduce stress and subsequent 
mental health problems among TGAs. Transgender children 14 and younger who have 
already completed their social transition are not more likely to experience depression and 
anxiety than their cisgender peers [13–15].

Although there is compelling evidence from studies of transgender children age 14 and 
younger, studies of associations between gender transition and mental health are very limited 
among TGAs despite high risk for mental health problems during adolescence. One prior 
study found that TGAs who used a name that aligned with their gender identity across 
multiple social contexts experienced fewer depressive symptoms compared to TGAs who 
used their name in fewer contexts [16]. However, not all individuals seek to complete 
the same steps during their transition (e.g., some TGAs may not use a different name 
during their transition if their birth name is gender-neutral). Therefore, researchers have 
recommended measuring perceived transition progress to more precisely capture transgender 
individuals’ subjective sense of transition progress rather than examining specific transition 
milestones [17,18]. No extant research, however, has examined perceived transition progress 
among TGAs. Given that most transgender youth begin to identify as TGAs and share their

gender identity with others during adolescence [19], it is critical to accrue more evidence 
of how perceived gender transition progress is related to mental health problems during 
adolescence.

Perceived transition progress during adolescence has the potential to increase TGAs’ gender 
congruence, a key factor related to mental health among transgender individuals. Gender 
congruence is the extent to which an individual’s gender expression is similar to or 
different from their gender identity [20]. Within adult samples, transgender individuals 
who have completed a higher proportion of their desired gender transition milestones report 
higher gender congruence [21,22]. Furthermore, higher gender congruence is related to 
experiencing fewer mental health symptoms among adult transgender individuals [23,24]. 
Gender congruence has been examined less frequently among TGAs, with one study finding 
that TGAs assigned female at birth (AFAB) presenting for care at a gender clinic who 
experienced greater gender congruence had lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms 
[25]. In another small clinical sample of TGAs (n = 109), TGAs who reported low levels 
of gender congruence were more likely to meet criteria for a depressive disorder [8]. While 
initial findings indicate gender congruence is related to mental health symptoms among 
TGAs in clinical samples, no prior studies with large nationwide samples have examined 
this association. Furthermore, prior studies have not examined how perceived transition 
progress is related to gender congruence among TGAs.

While most prior studies have operationalized gender identity such that all TGAs are 
combined into one group, important subgroup differences in psychosocial experiences and 
risk for mental health problems are increasingly documented. Researchers have noted that 
experiences of TGAs can vary based on both their sex assigned at birth [3] and their gender 
identity, documenting differing reports from binary youth (identifying as transmasculine 
or transfeminine) and nonbinary youth (youth whose gender identity falls outside the 
male–female binary; e.g., who identify as nonbinary, genderqueer, genderfluid) [6]. While 
subgroup differences in perceived transition progress and gender congruence have not been 
previously examined among TGAs, limited evidence within adult samples has been mixed 
thus far; one study found higher gender congruence among nonbinary individuals [26] 
but another reported higher congruence among binary participants [27]. Researchers have 
reported that nonbinary adults seek to undergo fewer gender transition steps as compared to 
binary transgender adults [26]. Among adolescents, more evidence is needed to understand 
how gender transition might vary across subgroups of TGAs.

The current study sought to examine three aims within a large, nationwide sample of 
TGAs. First, we examined TGA subgroup differences in perceived transition progress, 
gender congruence, and mental health symptoms. Second, we examined associations 
between perceived transition progress and gender congruence among TGAs, and we 
investigated whether transition progress was indirectly related to mental health symptoms 
via level of gender congruence. Third, we examined whether subgroup differences in 
perceived transition progress and gender congruence were indirectly related to mental health 
symptoms among TGAs.

Data derived from the Gender Minority Youth (GMY) Study, a large, nationwide cross-
sectional online survey of mental and behavioral health among adolescents aged 14–18 
in the United States collected in 2018 (n = 3,318 total) [28]. Participants were recruited 
through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, social media platforms used by most 
adolescents at the time of recruitment. TGAs were oversampled by using interest labels 
including “Transgender,” “Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns,” “Genderqueer,” 
and “Passing (gender)” in some ads designed to specifically target TGAs. The current 
analysis included 1,943 TGAs who identified with a gender identity that differed from their 
sex assigned at birth or indicated they were currently questioning their gender identity.

Advertisements were served 377,469 times, and 8,747 clicks were recorded (2.48% click-
through rate). A total of 5,642 participants assented, entered the survey, and began 
responding to questions. Adolescents were screened out of the survey if they were outside 
the targeted age range; in light of underrepresentation of TGAs assigned male at birth 
(AMAB) in the early period of data collection, additional screening was used toward the 
end of recruitment to allow only TGAs AMAB to participate. In total, 1,997 participants 
were screened out of the survey. All participants provided assent (with a waiver of parental 
permission) prior to completing the GMY Study. Participants could enter a drawing for a 
$50 gift card and were provided with resources related to mental health, child abuse, and 
sexual assault. The University of Pittsburgh’s Human Research Protection Office approved 
this study.

We took multiple steps to ensure the quality of the dataset. First, we used Internet Protocol 
addresses to identify potential duplicate cases, and cases with the same Internet Protocol 
address were hand-checked. Duplicates with the same demographic characteristics and 
height/weight were removed (n = 320). Second, outlier analysis indicated no cases had 
evidence of values outside the expected range on variables reported as counts. Third, 
free-response text was reviewed, and seven cases were removed which had inappropriate 
responses to survey questions. Additional details about the GMY Study methods and dataset 
are available elsewhere [28].

Gender identity.—Participants reported their sex assigned at birth as either male or 
female. Participants selected all gender identities they identify with: (1) male, (2) female, 
(3) transgender, (4) female to male transgender, (5) male to female transgender, (6) trans 
male/transmasculine, (7) trans female/transfeminine, (8) genderqueer, (9) gender expansive, 
(10) intersex, (11) androgynous, (12) nonbinary, (13) two-spirited, (14) third gender, 
(15) agender, (16) not sure, and (17) other. A five-category gender identity variable was 
created, including transmasculine youth (including participants who reported female sex 
assigned at birth and male, female to male transgender, and/or trans male/transmasculine 
identities), transfeminine youth (including participants who reported male sex assigned at 
birth and female, male to female transgender, and/or trans female/transfeminine identities),

nonbinary AFAB, nonbinary AMAB, and questioning gender identity (including participants 
who selected “not sure” and no other gender identities). Adolescents were categorized 
as nonbinary if they reported a genderqueer, gender expansive, intersex, androgynous, 
nonbinary, two-spirited, third gender, or agender current gender identity and no binary 
gender identities. We found empirical support for this approach to categorization in prior 
analyses of this dataset [6]. As a team, we carefully weighed the risks and benefits 
of categorizing nonbinary youth with their sex assigned at birth (SAAB). Although we 
recognize the potentially invalidating nature of this categorization, we note that several 
studies have found significant group differences in important outcomes based on SAAB. 
Because our goal is to attend to heterogeneity to improve the treatment of transgender 
adolescents, we decided to utilize SAAB-based categorization. Questioning adolescents 
could not be divided by sex assigned at birth because of small cell sizes.

Perceived transition progress was assessed with the following item. “Thinking about your 
ideal gender expression, what percentage of transition milestones have you already met?” 
Response options included: 0%: “I have made no steps in my transition that I would like 
to make,” 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%: “I have made all steps in my transition that I would 
like to make.” This item was adapted to be appropriate for adolescents from a measure 
of transition status developed through qualitative interviews with transgender adults that 
has demonstrated validity in studies of anxiety and depressive symptoms [17,18]. TGAs 
also reported whether they had engaged in specific social and medical transition steps, and 
percentages engaging in each transition milestone within TGA subgroups are presented in 
Table 2.

Gender congruence—Gender congruence was assessed with the Appearance 
Congruence subscale of the Transgender Congruence Scale [20]. This 9-item scale assesses 
the extent to which an individual’s gender expression is congruent with their gender identity, 
including items such as “My outward appearance represents my gender identity.” Response 
options ranged from “strongly disagree” to “strong agree” on a 5-point Likert scale, and 
a composite mean score was calculated for each participant. This scale has demonstrated 
reliability and validity in adult samples [20,23] and demonstrated strong reliability within 
our adolescent sample (α = 0.88) [4].

Mental health symptoms.—Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder seven-item (GAD-7) scale, a well-validated measure of anxiety symptoms 
[29] which has demonstrated reliability and validity within adolescent samples [30]. 
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Centers for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression scale [31], an established 20-item measure of depressive symptoms that is valid 
within adolescent samples [32]. GAD-7 and Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
total scores were calculated by summing all items in each scale, and each scale evidenced 
sufficient reliability in the present sample (α = 0.91 and α = 0.78, respectively).

Participants

Participants lived in all 50 states as well as Washington, DC. Participants included 990 
transmasculine youth, 132 transfeminine youth, 640 nonbinary adolescents AFAB, 84

nonbinary adolescents AMAB, and 97 adolescents who were questioning their gender 
identity. Sixty-seven percent of participants identified as White, 7% as Black/African 
American, 9% as Latinx, 3% as Asian American or Pacific Islander, 2% as Native American 
or American Indian, 1% identified with another race/ethnicity, and 12% identified with more 
than one race/ethnicity.

Analytic plan

First, bivariate associations between all variables were examined. Path analysis was then 
conducted using Mplus Version 8 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles, CA) [33], with anxiety 
and depressive symptoms included as two separate dependent variables within the same 
multivariate model. Paths from perceived transition progress to gender congruence to mental 
health symptoms were included (Figure 1). Direct paths from perceived transition progress 
to mental health symptoms were also included, and indirect effects between transition 
progress and mental health symptoms via gender congruence were examined. Gender 
identity subgroup (with transmasculine youth as the reference group given this was the 
largest subgroup [6]) was included in each path, and indirect effects between subgroup and 
mental health symptoms via perceived transition progress and gender congruence were also 
examined. Age and race/ethnicity were also controlled for within each path.

Paths were estimated using full information maximum likelihood procedures [34], so all 
1,943 TGAs were included in analyses and their data contributed to the model regardless 
of missingness. The highest level of missing data was observed for the GAD-7, as this 
assessment was placed later in the GMY battery, and participants were more likely to 
complete the survey through the GAD-7 if they were older and identified as transfeminine. 
Age was included as a covariate to further control for potential biases related to missingness. 
To assess the significance of indirect effects, 95% confidence intervals were estimated 
using a bootstrapping procedure that was not bias-corrected. This approach has been 
recommended for assessing indirect effects in path analysis, as using bias-corrected 
bootstrapped estimates and corresponding confidence intervals can increase the likelihood 
of Type I error [35]. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for indirect effects were 
estimated using 20,000 iterations, and confidence intervals excluding zero were interpreted 
as significant.

The means, ranges, standard deviations, and subsample sizes for all continuous variables, 
as well as correlations between variables, for the full sample are reported in Table 1. 
Descriptive data for each TGA subgroup, including number of participants engaging in 
each gender transition milestone, are presented in Table 2. Most TGAs had engaged in at 
least one social transition step (98%) but had not yet begun any medical transition steps 
(only 11% reported any medical transition). Univariate associations between categorical 
(including gender identity subgroup and race/ethnicity) and continuous variables were 
examined using one-way ANOVA. Gender identity subgroups differed in reports of 
transition progress and gender congruence (F(4,1625) = 8.40; p < .001 and F(4,1628) 
= 28.12; p < .001 respectively). Tukey post hoc tests indicated nonbinary adolescents

AFAB reported more transition progress than transmasculine youth, transfeminine youth, 
and questioning participants. Transmasculine youth reported less gender congruence than 
nonbinary and questioning youth, and transfeminine youth reported less congruence than all 
other subgroups. There were also significant differences in transition progress across racial/
ethnic subgroups (F(6,1623) = 2.73; p = .012), with participants identifying as mixed race/
ethnicity reporting more transition progress than Latinx youth. No univariate differences in 
depressive or anxiety symptoms were observed across subgroups.

All paths were estimated while controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and gender identity 
subgroup. Controlling for covariates, transition progress was positively associated with 
gender congruence. Gender congruence was negatively associated with both anxiety and 
depressive symptoms, and transition progress was associated with anxiety but not depressive 
symptoms within the same equations. In addition, transfeminine youth evidenced lower 
transition progress than transmasculine youth, and nonbinary adolescents AFAB evidenced 
higher transition progress when compared to transmasculine youth, when adjusting for other 
demographic variables. In the equation predicting gender congruence, transfeminine youth 
evidenced lower congruence as compared to transmasculine youth, and transmasculine youth 
evidenced lower congruence compared to nonbinary and questioning youth, while also 
accounting for transition progress. Direct effects are represented in Figure 1 for variables 
of interest, and estimated coefficients and significance levels of direct paths are included 
in Table 3. Full model results, including direct effects of covariates, are presented in 
Tables A1 and A2. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine whether 
victimization experiences confounded associations between transition progress, gender 
congruence, and mental health symptoms. The overall pattern of results was unchanged 
when victimization was added to the model as a covariate, and full results of sensitivity 
analyses are presented in Supplementary Material.

Indirect effects were examined to determine whether perceived transition progress was 
related to anxiety and depressive symptoms via gender congruence. Transition progress was 
negatively associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms via higher levels of gender 
congruence. In addition, indirect effects between gender identity subgroup and mental health 
symptoms via transition progress and gender congruence were examined. Transfeminine 
youth exhibited higher depressive and anxiety symptoms as compared to transmasculine 
youth via lower levels of transition progress and gender congruence. Nonbinary adolescents 
AFAB exhibited lower depressive and anxiety symptoms as compared to transmasculine 
youth via higher levels of transition progress and gender congruence. Estimated indirect 
effects and 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals are reported in Table 4.

Finally, to more precisely examine the association between perceived social transition 
progress and gender congruence, we conducted post hoc sensitivity analyses while selecting 
only participants who had not taken medical transition steps. Adjusted regression results 
indicated perceived transition progress remained positively related to gender congruence 
among TGAs who had only engaged in social transition steps (B = 0.34; p < .001).

Discussion

Page 8

This is the first study to demonstrate that TGAs who perceive more progress in their 
gender transition and higher congruence between their gender expression and gender 
identity report lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings extend 
those of studies examining transition progress, gender congruence, and mental health 
conducted among transgender children and adults to adolescents. Perceived transition 
progress evidenced a direct association with anxiety symptoms but was unassociated with 
depressive symptoms when accounting for gender congruence. Additionally, perceived 
transition progress evidenced indirect associations with mental health symptoms via gender 
congruence.

Our results also indicate that certain subgroups of TGAs may experience particular 
challenges to achieving transition milestones during adolescence. TGAs who identify with 
binary identities reported the lowest levels of transition progress and gender congruence, 
with transfeminine youth reporting the most limited transition progress and lowest gender 
congruence, and these subgroup differences had indirect effects on mental health symptoms 
in our path analysis. TGAs with binary identities may have the least perceived transition 
progress because they hope to achieve comparatively more transition milestones than TGAs 
with nonbinary identities. Within adult samples, there is evidence that binary transgender 
adults are more likely to receive surgery and use hormone replacement therapy than 
nonbinary adults, but also that binary and nonbinary adults are equally likely to change their 
appearance in other ways [26]. However, gender transition is an individual journey; many 
nonbinary TGAs may desire medical affirmation of their gender during their transition, and 
some nonbinary TGAs may want to achieve more transition milestones than some TGAs 
with binary identities.

While many transgender individuals’ gender transitions include both social and medical 
transition steps, most TGAs in our sample had not taken medical transition steps. Only 
11% of our sample had engaged in medical interventions related to their gender transition 
at the time of the study. Many TGAs who desire medical gender transition care might not 
have access to it during adolescence because parental permission is required for medical 
interventions for youth under the age of 18, and since the time of our 2018 survey, legal 
restrictions have further limited youths’ access to gender-affirming care, as we discuss 
further below. To examine the potential influence of social transition progress in particular, 
we conducted post hoc analyses to examine the association between perceived transition 
progress and gender congruence while selecting only participants who reported they had 
not yet engaged in any medical transition steps. Results from this model indicated that 
TGAs who had made more progress in their social transition perceived higher levels of 
congruence between their gender expression and gender identity. Our results demonstrate 
that early perceived progress in gender transition is related to experiencing fewer mental 
health symptoms among TGAs during adolescence, and social transition progress alone was 
related to lower mental health symptoms.

TGAs have very high risk for experiencing mental health problems during adolescence [5,6], 
and our results identify perceived transition progress and gender congruence as two potential

targets of behavioral health interventions designed to reduce risk for adverse mental 
health outcomes among TGAs. Numerous multidisciplinary gender-affirming care programs 
exist in communities throughout the United States [36,37], and these settings might be 
particularly well-suited to providing TGAs with integrated mental health and medical 
transition support to provide them the opportunity to navigate their desired gender transition 
milestones effectively and efficiently and increase their gender congruence. Family-based 
approaches, including gender-affirming family therapy and support groups for parents and 
caregivers that are tailored to the unique developmental needs of TGAs, also hold promise 
and could reduce barriers to continued transition progress throughout adolescence [38,39], 
as parents must provide permission for TGAs to begin medical transition steps prior to age 
18. Other existing sources of community support, including gender-affirming youth groups 
such as gender–sexuality alliances, could serve as critical sources of support for TGAs 
throughout their gender transition [40]. At this time, no formal mental health interventions 
designed to support TGAs through their gender transition have been empirically tested 
within this population [39], and further clinical intervention research among TGAs is 
required. Overall, clinical interventions which incorporate collaborations between clinicians 
and TGAs to further transition progress and enhance gender congruence have potential to 
reduce internalizing symptoms among TGAs during adolescence.

The current study adds to a growing literature documenting more positive mental health 
among TGAs who have access to their desired social and medical gender transition 
milestones. Although our cross-sectional results cannot determine causality, they suggest 
the possibility that denial of gender-affirming care for TGAs could have a deleterious 
influence on their mental health symptoms. State legislatures across the United States 
have recently written and passed laws designed to deny gender-affirming care to TGAs 
by enacting criminal penalties against physicians and parents who provide and facilitate 
gender-affirming care for TGAs [41,42]. These efforts may exacerbate dire mental health 
disparities between TGAs and their peers [41], and it is imperative that legislators act swiftly 
to protect the rights of TGAs and their families to seek gender-affirming care.

The contributions of the current study must be understood within the context of 
methodological limitations. First, our study was cross-sectional, and caution must be taken 
when interpreting the directions of associations within the estimated path analysis. While the 
temporality of measures included in the analyses support the hypothesized directions (i.e., 
prior progress in gender transition predicting current gender congruence and mental health 
symptoms), cross-sectional analyses may be biased by reverse causation. For example, 
TGAs who are experiencing depressive and anxiety symptoms might have more difficulty 
making progress in their desired transition milestones (e.g., social anxiety could make 
disclosure to peers more difficult). Future prospective studies of TGAs’ experiences across 
adolescent development and into young adulthood are critical to understand how gender 
transition is related to well-being over time. Second, our sample of TGAs was large and 
diverse, but it consisted entirely of social media users. Although estimates have indicated 
the vast majority of adolescents in the United States use the social media platforms 
through which we recruited TGAs [43], future studies should assess whether findings 
differ in samples of TGAs recruited through other methods. Third, although we attend to 
heterogeneity in gender identity among TGAs, difficult choices had to be made to reduce

the dimensionality of the data. For example, some participants selected both binary and 
nonbinary identities. These participants were categorized as binary for analytic purposes, 
and while this categorization approach was based on empirical evidence, it may not 
accurately categorize all youth and could invalidate individual participants’ experiences and 
identities. We suggest that future studies ask participants to both “select all that apply” 
and also “choose the best fit” when assessing gender identity to categorize TGAs as 
accurately as possible. Finally, our sample is disproportionately White as compared to the 
US adolescent population. Future studies of large samples of TGAs of color are required to 
examine whether associations between transition progress, gender congruence, and mental 
health symptoms vary across racial and ethnic identities.

TGAs experience alarmingly high risk for mental health problems during adolescence, and 
this population must be prioritized in future adolescent mental health research. Results 
from the current study indicate that perceived progress within TGAs’ gender transition and 
higher levels of gender congruence are related to lower levels of depressive and anxiety 
symptoms within this population. Future interventions designed to reduce depressive and 
anxiety symptoms among TGAs might be enhanced by specific foci on perceived transition 
progress and gender congruence.

IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION

Transgender adolescents have high risk for experiencing depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, and little is known about psychosocial factors contributing to their risk. 
Findings indicate higher perceived gender transition progress and higher congruence 
between gender identity and gender expression could be related to experiencing fewer 
mental health symptoms among transgender adolescents.
