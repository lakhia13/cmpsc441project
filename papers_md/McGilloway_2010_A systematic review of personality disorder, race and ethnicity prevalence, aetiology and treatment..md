Abstract
Background: Although psychoses and ethnicity are well researched, the importance of culture, race and ethnicity has 
been overlooked in Personality Disorders (PD) research. This study aimed to review the published literature on ethnic 
variations of prevalence, aetiology and treatment of PD.

Method: A systematic review of studies of PD and race, culture and ethnicity including a narrative synthesis of 
observational data and meta-analyses of prevalence data with tests for heterogeneity.

Results: There were few studies with original data on personality disorder and ethnicity. Studies varied in their 
classification of ethnic group, and few studies defined a specific type of personality disorder. Overall, meta-analyses 
revealed significant differences in prevalence between black and white groups (OR 0.476, CIs 0.248 - 0.915, p = 0.026) 
but no differences between Asian or Hispanic groups compared with white groups. Meta-regression analyses found 
that heterogeneity was explained by some study characteristics: a lower prevalence of PD was reported among black 
compared with white patients in UK studies, studies using case-note diagnoses rather than structured diagnostic 
interviews, studies of borderline PD compared with the other PD, studies in secure and inpatient compared with 
community settings, and among subjects with co-morbid disorders compared to the rest. The evidence base on 
aetiology and treatment was small.

Conclusion: There is some evidence of ethnic variations in prevalence of personality disorder but methodological 
characteristics are likely to account for some of the variation. The findings may indicate neglect of PD diagnosis among 
ethnic groups, or a true lower prevalence amongst black patients. Further studies are required using more precise 
cultural and ethnic groups.

Background
Personality Disorder (PD) is defined by the World Health
Organisation  as  "a  severe  disturbance  in  the  charactero-
logical  condition  and  behavioural  tendencies  of  the  indi-
vidual, usually involving  several areas of the personality,
and  nearly  always  associated  with  considerable  personal
and social disruption"[1].

The  nature,  diagnosis  and  categorisation  of  PD  has
been widely deliberated among mental health profession-
als, yet has been subjected to little empirical research [2].
Nonetheless, a good deal of information is known regard-
ing PD [3]. One aspect that has been overlooked that may
reveal  a  better  understanding  about  the  aetiology  and
treatment of personality disorder is the impact of culture,

race  and  ethnicity  on  PD  [2].  Black  and  minority  ethnic
groups  are  known  to  be  over-represented  in  mental
health services, especially in forensic and secure settings
and inpatient care. Similar studies of PD are uncommon.
PD research is fraught with problems. The category of PD
has  been  criticised  as  culturally  biased  [4]  and  that  the
diagnosis is a reflection of North American and Western
European concepts of personality functioning [5]. Behav-
ioural norms in one culture may be considered deviant in
another,  however,  there  are  insufficient  studies  address-
ing  the  role  of  ethnicity  in  diagnostic  practice  [5].  This
study  aimed  to  systematically  review  all  available  pub-
lished  literature  that  addresses  PD  prevalence,  aetiology
and treatment in relation to race and ethnicity.

culture and ethnicity. Searches were undertaken between
the 26th February and the 7th of March 2008. Inclusion cri-
teria were set widely for studies with original data on race
and  ethnic  group,  with  personality  disorder  as  an  out-
come. The subjects of the studies were adults and the set-
tings 
included  community,  specialist  mental  health
services  and  prison  settings.  The  search  was  supple-
mented by forward and backward citation, manual explo-
ration of references and by contacting experts in the field
to refer us to any other relevant studies.

Of  the  391  publications  identified  by  the  search,  after
review of full text articles, fourteen studies met the inclu-
sion criteria for the review. Reference tracking identified
one further study resulting in a total of fifteen studies for
review (see Figure 1).

From  the  15  publications  (13  studies)  entering  the
review,  the  following  data  were  extracted  and  tabulated

(Tables 1 &2): outcome of interest (prevalence, aetiology,
and  treatment),  description  of  methods  used  (study
design,  procedure,  diagnostic  tool,  statistical  methods),
participants,  place  of  study  (country  and  setting),  main
effects and data points for our outcomes of interest, and
strengths  and  limitations  of  each  study.  In  addition  to
these,  a  scoring  system  for  the  methodological  quality
was designed by one reviewer (AM), and adapted with a
second  reviewer  (KB)  experienced  in  systematic  review
methods  in  order.  Six  domains  were  considered  (see
Table 3).

The studies differed in methods and objectives. There-
fore, the observational data were subjected to a narrative
synthesis  in  order  to  identify  common  and  recurring
themes  from  different  papers[6]  Of  the  fifteen  papers,
seven provided raw prevalence data by ethnic group that
could  be  used  in  a  meta-analysis  (additional  file  1).  The

software package Comprehensive Meta Analysis (version
2)  was  used  to  calculate  odds  ratios  for  PD in  an  ethnic
compared  to  white  group.  Heterogeneity  was  calculated
using I2 as this is more useful than Cochran's Q value in
showing the extent of heterogeneity in small samples [7].
A value of zero reflects true homogeneity amongst stud-
ies whilst values above this show the presence of hetero-
geneity.  Values  around  I2  =  25,  50  and  75  reflect  low,
moderate and high heterogeneity respectively[7]. Where
I2 exceeded 75, a random effects model was used, below
this level a fixed effects model was used.

In order to further explore possible causes of between-
study  heterogeneity,  meta-regression  analyses  were  per-
formed  (see  Table  4).  These  compared  black  with  white
groups by the following characteristics: US and UK stud-
ies; community, inpatient and prison settings; secure and
non-secure inpatient settings; use of an interview sched-
ule and no interview schedule; different diagnoses (anti-
social  personality  disorder,  borderline  personality
disorder  and  both  combined);  and  personality  disorder
diagnosis alone and with co-morbidity. Age and gender of
participants were not extracted as only three studies pro-
vided this data.

Results
Of  the  15  studies  reviewed,  9  were  of  moderate  quality
and 5 of high quality. Studies included surveys, cohorts,
cross-sectional  and  randomised  controlled  trials,  and
took place in a variety of environments including civilian
populations,  prisons,  forensic  units,  psychiatric  emer-
gency clinics, and both inpatient and outpatient settings;
studies were equally from the US and the UK.

Defining PD
Interview schedules were used to establish PD prevalence
in three studies; the schedules included the NIMH Diag-
nostic  Interview  Schedule  Version  III-R  [8],  the  Alcohol
Use  Disorder  and  Associated  Disabilities  Interview
Schedule-DSM  IV  version  [9],  the  Structured  Clinical
Interview  for  DSM-IV  Axis  II  [10],  and  the  Structured
Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-IV,  Patient  Version[10]  The

other  four  studies  relied  on  case-notes.  In  two  studies
[11,12] the researchers reviewed patient notes and made
the diagnostic decision according to DSM-IV Axis II cri-
teria.  One  study  used  the  primary  psychiatric  diagnosis
given in discharge summaries from an inpatient psychiat-
ric  unit  [13]  and  the  other  relied  on  diagnoses  in  case
notes  [14].  An  array  of  PD  diagnoses  were  included  by
authors including antisocial, borderline, paranoid, schiz-
oid, dependent, avoidant, anankastic, and histrionic.

Only four studies contained data for specific diagnoses
by  ethnic  group,  these  were  for  borderline  PD  [10,13],
antisocial PD [8.10], and the two combined [10,12]. Only
three  studies  contained  prevalence  data  for  PD  alone
without  co-morbidity  [9,10,13].  The  prevalence  data  of
the other studies included other psychiatric co-morbidity
and substance dependence disorders.

Prevalence
Most  studies  were  concerned  with  white  participants  in
comparison  with  black  participants.  Subgroups  of  the
white  ethnic  group  were  not  shown  in  any  paper.  Five
papers  failed  to  provide  an  ethnic  distinction  between
black  sub-groups  [7-11].  Five  studies  (2  of  which  were
scored as high quality) found black populations to have a
statistically significant lower prevalence of PD than white
populations  [11,12,14-16].  One  of  these  studies  also
determined  that  Asian  populations  (from  India,  Bangla-
desh and Pakistan) were also less likely to have a PD than
white populations [OR 0.1, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
0.03-0.41,  p  <  0.05]  [12].  However,  in  contrast  to  these
findings,  one  large  epidemiological  survey  of  a  civilian
non-institutionalised

weighted  prevalence of  PD  was  greater  in  black  popula-
tions (16.6%) than white (14.6%) [p < 0.05] [9].

Results suggest PD criteria were distributed systematically such 
that PD diagnosis were applied to certain ethnic grps. African 
American given Antisocial & paranoid PDs. Schizoid PD applied to 
Asian Americans. Schizotypal PD applied to Native Americans. All 
other PDs were applied to European Americans (BPD, Dependant, 
Narcissistic, & Obsessive-Compulsive). All p < 0.001.

Native Americans had the highest prevalence of PD, and Asians 
the lowest (see prevalence). Association between PD and Alcohol 
and Drug were positive & sig (except for Drugs & PD in Asians). 
This is true of unadjusted and adjusted (for age, income marital 
status, religion, sex, & urban city) ORs. Associations btwn alcohol

tained data for Asian participants (n = 1412); in one study
[12],  Asian  referred  to  those  of  Indian,  Bangladeshi  and
Pakistani  origin;  the  other  study  [9]  did  not  define  the
term.  Three  studies  included  data  for  Hispanic  partici-
pants [9,10,13] (n = 8815). Three studies were in the UK
[11.12.14], and four were in the US [8-10,13]. One study
was based in the community [9], one in a prison [10], and
five  in  hospital  settings  [8,11-14].  The  hospital  settings
included  medium  security,  high  security  and  drug  and
alcohol addiction units (additional file 1).

Meta-Analyses
The initial analyses compared Asians, Hispanic and black
groups  to  whites.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in
PD prevalence between Asians and whites (OR O.295 CIs
0.048  -  1.827),  or  Hispanics  and  whites  (OR  1.155  CIs
0.831 - 1.606). There was, as shown in Figure 2, a signifi-
cant difference between black and white populations (OR
0.476, CIs 0.248 - 0.915, p = 0.026).

There  was  also substantial  heterogeneity  (I2 = 96.527).
Subsequent analyses of potential sources of heterogeneity
examined only black and white population data (see Table
4, Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The country setting, whether
conducted in the US or the UK, proved to be an impor-
tant source of heterogeneity (see Figure 3). There was no
significant  difference  in  the  prevalence  of  PD  amongst
blacks compared to whites in the US (OR 0.872, CI 0.634-
1.199,  I2  =  74.925).  In  contrast,  there  was  a  significant
prevalence  difference  between  black  and  white  subjects
in the UK studies (OR 0.214, 95% CI 0.167 - 0.274). The
UK  studies  also  showed  true  homogeneity  (I2  =  0)  as
shown  in  Table  4.  There  were  important  differences
between  the  US  and  UK  studies;  firstly,  two  of  the  UK
studies were conducted on the same population in secure
settings [11,12] and the third UK study was conducted in
a similar secure hospital setting [14]. The UK studies also
used  only  case  notes  whilst  the  US  studies  used  both
interview schedules and case notes (discussed below).

Figure  4  shows  that,  in  a  comparison  of  three  service
settings  (community,  hospital  and  prison),  black  groups
compared to white groups were least likely to have a PD

Table 3: Scoring system for quality of included papers

in hospital settings (OR 0.357, CIs 0.188 - 0.677; 89.919)
and  most  likely  in  community  setting  (OR  1.164,  CIs
1.087  -  1.245).  Of  the  studies  in  hospital  settings,  black
patients  were  less  likely  to  have  PD  in  the  secure  com-
pared to non-secure settings (Figure 6); the three secure
setting studies were the three UK studies.

Further  meta-regression  analysis  of  the  hospital  sub-
group  compared  the  use  of  an  interview  schedule  and
case-notes diagnoses. Where only case notes were used,
the odds ratio was reduced from 0.357 to 0.281 (CI 0.169
- 0.467) (see Figure 5) and heterogeneity was reduced to
I2 = 77.274.
Use of interview schedule
The  use  of  an  interview  schedule  was  found  to  be  a
source  of  heterogeneity  (see  Table  4).  The  pooled  esti-
mate  for  studies  using  an  interview  schedule  showed,
with a fixed effects model (as I2 = 68.815), that the black
group was in fact more likely to have a PD than the white
group (OR 1.140, 95% CI 1.067 - 1.218; see Figure 7). In
contrast,  studies  not  using  an  interview  schedule  found
the black group to be significantly less likely to have a PD
than the white group (OR 0.281, 95% CI 0.169 - 0.467 I2 =
77.274;  see  Figure  5).  The  interview  schedule  subgroup
were all US studies, the non-interview subgroup included
one US study and three UK studies.
Diagnosis
Only borderline personality disorder showed a significant
prevalence  difference  between  black  and  white  groups
(OR 0.575, 95% CI 0.394 - 0.840; I2 = 0). These two studies
[10,13] were also similar as both were undertaken in the
US and used interview schedules. There was also homo-
geneity (I2 = 0) between the two antisocial PD studies but
no significant difference between black and white groups
in having this diagnosis; these studies were both in the US
but used different interview schedules [8,10]. See Figure
8.
Co-morbidity
Two  of  the  studies  refer  to  co-morbid  drug  misuse  and
dependence but did not specify other diagnoses [12,14].
Compton  included  co-morbidity  with  illicit  substance
misuse  and  dependence  (alcohol  and  drugs).  Trestman

included co-morbidity with psychotic, affective, and anx-
iety  disorders  and  PTSD  with  cluster  A,B,C  personality
disorders [10]. Coid listed many associations between dif-
ferent PD labels (ASPD + substance misuse, organic brain
syndromes; BPD + depression, mania, substance misuse;
paranoid PD + drug dependence and psychotic episodes)
[11]. In the presence of co-morbidity, black groups were
significantly less likely to have a PD diagnosis than white
groups (OR 0.381, 95% CI 0.190 - 0.764; I2 = 92.288;. See
Figure 9). As reflected by the high level of heterogeneity,
the  co-morbidity  sub-group  contained  mixed  studies  in
terms  of  setting  and  use  of  interview  schedule.  Where
there  was  no  co-morbidity,  there  was  no  significant  dif-

ference between black and white groups (OR 0.789, 95%
CI 0.432 - 1.441; I2 = 76.081).

Aetiology
The review found that the aetiology of PDs was the least
common subject of research. One study highlighted that
Hispanic  populations  have  higher  rates  of  intense  anger
and  affective  instability  compared  to  white  populations,
but these may be manifestations of PD rather than aetio-
logical  factors  [17].  Several  hypotheses  about  aetiology
were found in the publications. It was suggested that cer-
tain groups may possess characteristics of particular PDs,

migrating  ethnicities  may  find  it  difficult  to  adjust,  and
that higher social classes have lower incidences of PD.

Treatment
Three  of  the  five  high  quality  scored  studies  considered
race/ethnicity  with  regards  to  the  treatment  of  PD
[15,18,19].  They  determined  that  more  white  patients
with  PD  received  treatment  than  black  patients.  One  of
these  studies  comprehensively  evaluated  types  of  treat-
ment utilisation by patients with PD and concluded that
black  and  Hispanic  patients  received  a  significantly  nar-
rower  range  of  psychiatric  treatments  in  spite  of  having
higher  rates  of  severe  PD  [19].  This  was  true  for  outpa-
tient and inpatient psychosocial treatments and psycho-
tropic  medications  (p  <  0.0206  and  p  <  0.0001
respectively).

In the one RCT identified by the search strategy, which
compared  community  services  and  conventional  hospi-
tal-based  services  for  PD,  the  majority  of  patients  were
white  (63%)[16]  This  study  determined  that  those  with
PD  showed  greater  improvement  when  treated  in  the
hospital-based setting [16].

Discussion
PD diagnosis and ethnicity
The meta-analysis of seven studies determined that over-
all there was a small but significantly lower prevalence of
PD  amongst  black  as  compared  to  white  populations.
This  finding  concurred  with  that  of  two  of  the  fifteen
studies which could not be included in the meta-analysis
due to lack of raw data [15,16]. There was no significant
difference in prevalence between Asian and white popu-
lations, however, only two studies contained this data and
it  is  unlikely  that  the  term  'Asian'  connoted  comparable
populations.  The  meta-analysis  of  three  studies  of  His-
panic and white populations showed that Hispanics were
more likely to be diagnosed with a PD, however this was
not statistically significant.

Where  the  type  of  personality  disorder  was  specified,
the  majority  of  studies  investigated  borderline  or  anti-
social  personality  disorders.  Major  sources  of  heteroge-
neity  leading  to  lower  prevalence  estimates  were  the
country in which the study was undertaken (US or UK),
whether interview diagnoses were made rather than clini-

cal diagnoses, the specific diagnosis of borderline PD ver-
sus  others,  more  secure  settings  and  patients  with  co-
morbid disorders. These methodological differences may
account for the findings, however, if case note diagnoses
are  associated  with  a  lower  prevalence,  this  means  that
the routine care of black patients is likely to overlook PD
diagnoses, particularly if they have associated co-morbid-
ity.  A  recent  study  using  interview  diagnoses  in  the  UK
investigating prevalence and correlates of PD in provides
support  for  there  being  no  prevalence  differences
between non-white and white populations [20].

The meta-regression suggests a lower prevalence of PD
or  that  PD  is  overlooked  in  more  secure  settings  and  in
inpatient settings, where acute care is required to manage
high risks. If a real difference between settings were to be
found  using  the  same  methods,  then  questions  about
pathways into care and racial bias in diagnostic labelling
might  be  asked.  Similarly,  the  finding  of  a  lower  risk  of
borderline  disorder  is  likely  to  reflect  the  differential
effects  of  clinical  and  case-note  diagnoses  rather  than
interview schedules in these studies. However, these find-
ings need replication and the development of case regis-
ters from which sufficient numbers of subjects might be

gathered to test for these interactions in a more system-
atic and empirical manner.

Aetiology
Very little scientific knowledge on the aetiology of PD has
been collated [21]. One study highlighted that Hispanics
were  found  to  be  more  intense  and  angry  than  whites
[17],  and  another  determined  that  those  from  ethnic
minorities  (mostly  African  Caribbean)  and  those  in
higher  social  classes  had  a  lower  incidence  of  PD  [16].
Although  there  are  studies  of  higher  and  lower  risk  in
specific  demographic  and  ethnic  groups  [16,17,21,22],
few studies investigate aetiological theories. For example,
Chavira  et  al.  investigated  whether  some  ethnic  groups
had increased vulnerability [17]. Iwamasa et al. proposed
that specific ethnic groups were vulnerable to particular
PDs [22] rather than all PDs. Castaneda and Franco con-
tend that certain migrating groups may find it difficult to
adjust and this is a factor in the development of PD [13].
If prevalence differences are genuine, then identification
of different factors across ethnic groups may help in the
design  of  studies  to  better  understand  determinants  of
PD.

Figure 7 All studies: interview and no interview use (fixed effects).

Treatment
Difference  in  prevalence  rates  (inpatient  and  prisoner
samples)  may  be  attributed  to  the  differences  in  help-
seeking behaviour by ethnic group and differential effect
'gate  keeping'  processes  [8,12,15,16,18,19].  Ethnic
of 
minority  populations  may  not  receive  specialist  care  for
PD, in contrast to schizophrenia where black people are
over-represented in specialist care, including forensic set-
tings. In the two studies with the highest quality scores,
more  white  than  black  patients  were  treated  for  PD,  yet
the difference in prevalence did correspond to the lower
number  of  black  people  hospitalised  [15,18],  suggesting
again the operation of pathway filters that diminish entry
into  specialist  care  for  black  people  with  PD.  Further-
more,  in  the  only study  of treatment utilisation,  PD and
ethnicity, black patients received a significantly narrower
range  of  treatments  compared  to  white  patients  [19].
Alternatively, more access to treatment may not equate to
more  effective  treatment  of  PD.  For  example,  variations
in  compulsory  admission  to  hospital  may  reflect  treat-
ment needs or selection to treatments that appear likely
to benefit patients [12]. Bender et al. suggested that non-
white  patients  may  have  received  a  narrower  range  of

treatments  due  to  differences  in  ethnic  metabolisms,  or
the  prescribing  habits  of  different  mental  health  work-
ers[19] but few studies replicate these findings or propose
an  overall  theoretical  framework  within  which  research
studies  can  lead  to  improved  clinical  practice.  However,
the  one  RCT  concluded  that  regardless  of  ethnicity,
patients  with  PD  showed  greater  improvement  in  social
functioning  when  treated  in  hospital  as  opposed  to  the
community;  this  is  the  only  study  comparing  different
psychiatric venues for the treatments of PD [16].

Strengths and limitations
The  main  limitation  is  the  small  number  of  studies
included in the meta-analysis. There was also substantial
heterogeneity amongst these studies the main sources of
which appeared to be study methods, setting and design.
However,  we  stress  the  importance  of  this  research  as
innovative. To our knowledge, this is the only review that
considers  existing  research  on  PD  prevalence,  aetiology
and  treatment  in  relation  to  race  and  ethnicity.  This
research  forms  part  of  a  larger  project  of  continuing
research that will look at specific PDs in relation to race
and ethnicity as well as developing and reviewing PD pol-

icy  involving  further  research  and  a  panel  of  experts  in
the field. At present, we suggest that policy should high-
light the need for clinicians to be more culturally aware,
and that differences in race and ethnicity must be taken
into consideration when diagnosing PDs.

Conclusion
The  existing  data  are  sparse.  There  is  a  risk  that  PD  is
overlooked  and  not  treated  in  black  people  with  PD.
More specific research in different service settings is nec-
essary to investigate pathways to care. There is almost no
aetiological and treatment research on more refined cul-
tural and ethnic categories, leaving unexplained the rea-
sons for differences across broad racial groups.
