Abstract

Background: Transcranial	magnetic	stimulation	(TMS)	has	been	evaluated	as	an	ef‐

fective	treatment	option	for	patients	with	major	depressive	disorder.	However,	there	

are	limited	studies	that	have	evaluated	the	efficacy	of	TMS	for	other	neuropsychiat‐

ric disorders such as anxiety and trauma‐related disorders. We reviewed the litera‐

ture	 that	 has	 evaluated	 TMS	 as	 a	 treatment	 for	 anxiety	 and	 trauma‐related	

disorders.

Methods:  We	 searched	 for	 articles	 published	 up	 to	 December	 2017	 in	 Embase,	

Medline,	 and	 ISI	 Web	 of	 Science	 databases,	 following	 the	 Preferred	 Items	 for	

Reporting	of	Systematic	Reviews	and	Meta‐Analyses	(PRISMA)	statement.	Articles	

(n	=	520)	evaluating	TMS	in	anxiety	and	trauma‐related	disorders	were	screened	and	

a small subset of these that met the eligibility criteria (n	=	17)	were	included	in	the	

systematic	 review,	 of	 which	 nine	 evaluated	 TMS	 in	 posttraumatic	 stress	 disorder	

(PTSD),	four	in	generalized	anxiety	disorder	(GAD),	two	in	specific	phobia	(SP),	and	

two	in	panic	disorder	(PD).	The	meta‐analysis	was	performed	with	PTSD	and	GAD	

since	PD	and	SP	had	an	insufficient	number	of	studies	and	sample	sizes.

Results:  Among	 anxiety	 and	 trauma‐related	 disorders,	 TMS	 has	 been	 most	 widely	

studied	as	a	treatment	for	PTSD.	TMS	demonstrated	large	overall	treatment	effect	

for	 both	 PTSD	 (ES	=	−0.88,	 95%	 CI:	 −1.42,	 −0.34)	 and	 GAD	 (ES	=	−2.06,	 95%	 CI:	

−2.64,	−1.48),	including	applying	high	frequency	over	the	right	dorsolateral	prefrontal	

cortex.	Since	few	studies	have	evaluated	TMS	for	SP	and	PD,	few	conclusions	can	be	

drawn.

Conclusions: Our	meta‐analysis	suggests	that	TMS	may	be	an	effective	treatment	for	

GAD	and	PTSD.

Transcranial	magnetic	stimulation	(TMS)	is	a	safe,	effective,	noninva‐

sive,	and	nonconvulsive	neuromodulation	therapy	cleared	by	the	U.S.	

Food	and	Drug	Administration	(FDA)	for	the	treatment	of	the	major	

depressive	disorder	(MDD)	since	2008	(O'Reardon	et	al.,	2007)	and	for	

obsessive–compulsive	disorder	(OCD)	since	2018.	Other	neurological	

and  psychiatric  conditions  are  being  investigated  as  possible  indica‐

tions	for	TMS,	including	bipolar	disorder,	posttraumatic	stress	disorder	

(PTSD),	 chronic	 pain,	 and	 Alzheimer's	 disease,	 among	 others	 (Cotelli,	

Manenti,	 Cappa,	 Zanetti,	 &	 Miniussi,	 2018;	 Lefaucheur	 et	 al.,	 2014;	

Nahas,	Kozel,	Li,	Anderson,	&	George,	2003;	Watts,	Landon,	Groft,	&	

Young‐Xu,	2012).

TMS	 is	 a	 biomedical	 application	 of	 Faraday's	 principle	 of	 elec‐

tromagnetic	 induction,	 and	 it	 works	 by	 generating	 strong	 and	 rap‐

idly changing electric currents in a circular coil that is placed on the 

surface of the skull. This primary current generates a magnetic field 

that	travels	unimpeded	through	the	hair,	soft	tissue,	skull,	and	cere‐

brospinal	 fluid	 (i.e.,	 these	 structures	 are	 minimally	 affected	 by	 the	

magnetic	field)	until	it	reached	the	neurons	of	the	cortex.	At	this	level,	

the	magnetic	field	converts	back	into	a	(secondary)	electrical	current	

able	 to	 depolarize	 neurons	 and	 force	 an	 action	 potential,	 which	 will	

then  travel  from  synapse  to  synapse  across  an  entire  functional  cir‐

cuit	of	interest	(Camprodon	&	Pascual‐Leone,	2016).	In	a	parameter‐

dependent	manner,	TMS	can	induce	long‐lasting	plastic	changes	and	

can  cause  either  a  long‐term  potentiation‐like  effect  or  a  long‐term 

depression‐like	effect	on	cortical	neurons,	and	this	can	modulate	the	

physiological	dynamics	across	brain	regions	and	networks	(Huerta	&	

Volpe,	2009).	In	this	context,	TMS	has	the	potential	to	therapeutically	

modulate  aberrant  circuit  properties  across  neuropsychiatric  condi‐

tions  with  maladaptive  circuit  dynamics.  Recent  technical  develop‐

ment	has	introduced	variants	of	the	traditional	repetitive	TMS	(rTMS)	

protocols	such	as	deep	TMS	(dTMS)	or	theta	burst	stimulation	(TBS),	

both	with	current	FDA‐clearance	for	the	treatment	of	OCD	and	MDD,	

respectively.

Highlights

•	 We	reviewed	TMS	as	a	treatment	for	anxiety	disorders	

and PTSD.

•	 TMS	 presented	 large	 effect	 sizes	 as	 a	 treatment	 for	

PTSD	and	GAD.

•	 Follow‐up	studies	in	GAD	showed	improvement	of	pa‐

tients	after	TMS.

•  Future studies should evaluate maintenance treatment.

most	 prevalent	 anxiety	 disorders	 in	 adults	 are	 generalized	 anxiety	

disorder	(GAD),	panic	disorder	(PD)	and	agoraphobia,	specific	phobia	

(SP),	and	social	anxiety	disorder	(SAD)	(Bandelow	&	Michaelis,	2015).	

Before	 the	 Diagnostic	 and	 Statistical	 Manual	 of	 Mental	 Disorders,	

Fifth	Edition	(DSM‐5),	PTSD	was	also	considered	an	anxiety	disorder	

(Association,	2000).

The  lifetime  comorbidity  rates  of  PTSD  with  other  psychiat‐

ric	 disorders	 range	 from	 62%	 to	 92%	 (Perkonigg,	 Kessler,	 Storz,	 &	

Wittchen,	2000).	Furthermore,	there	is	evidence	that	PD,	GAD,	and	

PTSD may have a common genetic predisposition (Chantarujikapong 

et	al.,	2001).	There	is	a	significant	percentage	of	patients	who	suffer	

from these disorders and show no improvement after several trials 

with	pharmacotherapy	and	cognitive	behavior	therapy	(Ballenger	et	

al.,	 2004).	 This	 highlights	 the	 need	 to	 continue	 therapeutic	 devel‐

opment	research	for	anxiety	disorders,	and	to	consider	the	role	of	

device‐based	interventions	such	as	TMS.	The	objective	of	this	sys‐

tematic  review  is  to  review  and  evaluate  the  existing  literature  on 

TMS	for	treating	anxiety	disorders	and	PTSD.

F I G U R E   5  Forest plot for the meta‐analysis of the treatment of 
PTSD	with	TMS

group	could	receive	additional	treatment.	After	this	second	phase,	

patients	continued	to	improve	from	PD	and	improved	from	MDD.	

Subsequently,	at	a	6‐month	follow‐up,	patients	showed	sustained	

improvement	of	both	disorders	(Mantovani	et	al.,	2013).

The	other	study	evaluated	whether	iTBS	associated	with	psycho‐

education	 could	 ameliorate	 clinical	 symptoms,	 verbal	 fluency,	 and	

brain	activity	of	PD	patients	(Deppermann	et	al.,	2014).	This	study	

assessed 44 patients with PD and 23 healthy controls. PD patients 

were	equally	randomized	to	sham	or	standard	iTBS.	Both	PD	groups	

underwent	 15	 weekday	 iTBS	 sessions.	 All	 participants	 completed	

a  verbal  fluency  task  during  functional  near‐infrared  spectroscopy 

(NIRS)	 and	 three‐weekly	 group	 psychoeducation	 sessions.	 The	

healthy	 controls	 had	 not	 undergone	 rTMS.	 In	 the	 end,	 both	 active	

and	 sham	 rTMS	 groups	 showed	 substantial	 improvement	 of	 PD	

symptoms,	 without	 significant	 difference	 between	 groups.	 There	

were no improvements in prefrontal hypoactivity or verbal fluency 

following	iTBS	(Deppermann	et	al.,	2014).

3.4 | TMS and specific phobia

We  did  not  find  any  studies  for  SP  with  more  than  two  treatment 

sessions.	However,	due	to	the	peculiar	features	of	the	disorder	with	

acute	 exacerbations	 that	 can	 be	 predicted	 in	 some	 situations,	 pa‐

tients  could  benefit  from  short‐lasting  effects  of  stimulation.  Two 

studies  used  single‐session  paradigms  with  a  translational  (not 

therapeutic)	aim	that	are	informative	in	the	context	of	this	review.	

These	studies	evaluated	rTMS	or	excitatory	intermittent	theta	burst	

stimulation	(iTBS)	as	a	treatment	for	SP	(Herrmann	&	Ebmeier,	2006;	

Notzon	 et	 al.,	 2015).	 Notzon	 et	 al.	 (2015)	 evaluated	 the	 effects	 of	

one	iTBS	session	on	virtual	reality‐provoked	anxiety	in	41	patients	

with	 spider	 phobia	 and	 42	 healthy	 controls	 randomized	 to	 active	

or	 sham	 iTBS;	 however,	 they	 measured	 the	 fear	 of	 spiders	 (SPQ),	

anxiety	(ASI),	and	disgust	sensitivity	(DS)	using	questionnaires.	They	

stimulated	 the	 lDLPFC	 using	 600	 pulses	 and	 the	 traditional	 iTBS	

protocol	 (50	Hz	 triplets	 every	 200	ms	 for	 2	s	 on	 and	 an	 intertrain

interval	 of	 8	s)	 with	 a	 pulse	 intensity	 of	 80%	 of	 the	 resting	 motor	

threshold	(RMT).	One	session	of	iTBS	showed	no	improvement.

Previous  studies  showed  the  importance  of  the  ventromedial 

prefrontal	cortex	(vmPFC)	in	fear	extinction	(Herrmann	&	Ebmeier,	

2006).	Since	this	brain	area	is	too	deep	to	be	directly	modulated	by	

TMS,	a	research	group	used	the	strategy	to	indirectly	stimulate	this	

region	through	FPz,	according	to	the	electroencephalography	(EEG)	

10–20 system. This position had been identified as the center of the 

mPFC  activation  cluster  by  an  increase  of  oxygenated  hemoglobin 

during  extinction  of  conditioned  fear  measured  by  NIRS  in  a  prior 

study	 (Guhn	 et	 al.,	 2012).	 Herrmann	 and	 Ebmeier	 (2006)	 studied	

the  effect  of  active  (n	=	20)	 or	 sham	 (n	=	19)	 rTMS	 applied	 before	

a  virtual  reality  exposure  to  heights  in  two  groups  of  individuals 

diagnosed  with  acrophobia.  The  protocol  consisted  of  two  active 

sessions	 of	 20	min	 of	 rTMS	 with	 10	Hz,	 at	 100%	 RMT,	 4	s	 on	 and	

26	s	off,	with	1560	pulses	per	session,	and	the	sessions	were	1	week	

apart.	At	the	end,	anxiety	(t	=	37,	2.33,	p	<	0.05)	and	avoidance	rat‐

ings (t	=	37,	2.34,	p	<	0.05)	decreased	in	the	active	group	(Herrmann	

&	Ebmeier,	2006).

3.5 | Side effects of TMS

Ten	of	the	17	studies	(59%)	included	in	this	meta‐analysis	presented	

adverse	events	(Boggio	et	al.,	2011;	Cohen	et	al.,	2004;	Diefenbach	

et	al.,	2016;	Dilkov	et	al.,	2017;	Herrmann	&	Ebmeier,	2006;	Isserles	

et	al.,	2013;	Mantovani	et	al.,	2013;	Nam	et	al.,	2013;	Notzon	et	al.,	

2015;	Rosenberg	et	al.,	2002).	Most	of	the	side	effects	were	mild	to	

moderate.	However,	two	studies	reported	a	single	generalized	tonic‐

clonic	seizure	(Dilkov	et	al.,	2017;	Isserles	et	al.,	2013).	Both	of	these	

studies	applied	20	Hz.	One	study	used	rTMS	with	20	trains	of	9	s,	51	s	

intertrain	intervals,	110%	RMT,	3,600	pulses/session,	with	a	figure‐

of‐eight	 coil	 over	 the	 rDLPFC	 (Dilkov	 et	 al.,	 2017).	 A	 train	 of	 9	s	 is	

long	and	may	have	contributed	to	the	seizure.	The	other	study	used	

dTMS	with	42	trains	of	2	s,	20	s	intertrain	intervals,	120%	RMT,	1680	

pulses/session,	with	a	H‐coil	over	the	mPFC	(Isserles	et	al.,	2013).	This	

protocol parameters are in the upper limit of the parameters currently 

used	 for	 dTMS.	 Neither	 described	 clinical	 characteristics	 that	 could	

explain	a	higher	risk	of	seizure.

Adverse	 events	 in	 patients	 who	 underwent	 active	 TMS	

were	 headache,	 neck	 pain,	 scalp	 pain,	 tingling,	 sleepiness,	 fa‐

cial	 twitch,	 and	 impaired	 cognition	 during	 treatment.	 A	 PTSD	

study  reported  two  patients  with  manic  episodes:  one  patient 

in	the	1	Hz‐group	 and	another	in	the	10	Hz‐group	 (Cohen	et	al.,	

2004).	 Few	 studies	 reported	 the	 adverse	 events	 of	 the	 sham	

group	separately,	but	these	included	neck	and	scalp	pain,	head‐

ache,	 impaired	 cognition,	 dizziness,	 sleepiness,	 and	 discomfort	

with	 treatment	 and	 the	 study	 schedule	 (Boggio	 et	 al.,	 2010;	

Diefenbach	 et	 al.,	 2016;	 Isserles	 et	 al.,	 2013;	 Mantovani	 et	 al.,	

2013;	Nam	et	al.,	2013).	One	PD	study	reported	hearing	impair‐

ment,	mainly	in	the	sham	group	(Mantovani	et	al.,	2013).	Adverse	

events are described in Table 9.

Another	 critical	 issue	 is	 to	 evaluate	 the	 percentage	 of	 patients	

who	 dropped	 out	 due	 to	 adverse	 events.	 A	 quarter	 of	 the	 studies
