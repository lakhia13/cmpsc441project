Abstract
Objective: Self-harm among young autistic individuals is a clinical challenge,
and the risk of premature death by suicide is strongly increased in this group.
Using the advantage of total-population and family-based data, we investigated

whether autism per se is a risk factor for self-harm independently of psychiat-
ric comorbidities and how it differs from self-harm in non-autistic individuals.
Methods: We used The Stockholm Youth Cohort, a total-population register
study, including all residents in Stockholm County aged 0–17 years between
2001 and 2011.Study participants were followed from age 10 to 27 for hospital

admissions because of self-harm. We used modified Poisson regression to cal-
culate relative risks (RR) using robust standard error to derive 95% confidence

intervals (CI).
Results: In all, 410,732 individuals were included in the cohort (9,070 with a
diagnosis of autism). Autistic individuals had a fivefold increased adjusted rela-
tive risk of self-harm (RR 5.0 [95% CI 4.4–5.6]). The risk increase was more
pronounced for autism without intellectual disability and particularly high for
self-cutting 10.2 [7.1–14.7] and more violent methods 8.9 [5.2–15.4]. The asso-
ciation between autism and self-harm was independent of, but clearly exacer-

bated by comorbid psychiatric conditions. It was of similar magnitude as risks

linked to these conditions per se, and not explained by shared familial factors.
Conclusion: Self-harm severe enough to present to medical services is as com-
mon in autistic youth as in those with depression or ADHD. Potentially more
lethal methods are more likely to be used of autistic self-harmers.

non-suicidal self-injury to completed suicide.4 Self-harm is
a strong predictor of completed suicide,5–7 and if not fatal
associated to long-term problems including increased risk
of ill health,8,9 substance misuse,10 and a range of socio-
economic disadvantages.11–14

Autism is a broad diagnostic category encompassing
developmental conditions characterized by difficulties
with reciprocal social interaction and restricted and repeti-
tive patterns of interests and behaviors15 presenting either
with or without intellectual disability (ID). Autistic indi-
viduals are at high risk of mental-health problems and sui-
cidality.16,17 Although increasing numbers of individuals
are being diagnosed with autism,18,19 there is still limited
understanding of unique healthcare needs of these indi-
viduals.17,20 It has been hypothesized that autism itself
should be considered a risk factor for suicidal behav-
iors17,21 This is because autistic individuals are exposed to
risk factors for such behaviors, including social isolation,
low self-esteem, or feelings of social exclusion, and often
have comorbid psychiatric conditions known to be
strongly linked to self-harm in general population3,4,22,23
and increased risks of suicidal behaviors (including self-
harm) have been noted in autistic individuals.24,25 Yet,
more robust empirical evidence for this notion has been
called for and autism is yet not recognized in recent clini-
cal guidelines for suicide prevention.26

Findings

regarding the influence of psychiatric
comorbid conditions on self-harm in autism are few and
their results conflicting.22,23,27 In a study from Finland,
the increased risk of intentional self-harm in young autis-
tic individuals was explained by comorbid psychiatric
conditions.22 In contrast, a cohort study from Taiwan
showed that autism was an independent risk factor for
self-harm.23 ADHD, depression, and anxiety disorder are
common in autism16,28 and are well-established risk fac-
tors for self-harm in general population.28,29 With the
regard to clinical utility of risk-factors in assessment of
self-harming individuals, there is a need to determine
whether autism per se increases risk of self-harm inde-
pendently of these conditions. Moreover, more precise
estimates of the risk of self-harm in autism, and whether
it is comparable with those of ADHD, depression, and
anxiety disorders solely, may inform clinical decision
making.

Hirvikovski and colleagues have reported a marked
increased risk of suicide in autism25 particularly in autis-
tic individuals without ID,25 who may have greater cogni-
tive abilities to conceptualize, plan and engage in suicidal
behaviors.30,31 Self-harm is a possibly intervenable pre-
cursor of suicide, and knowledge on whether and how it
differs in autism according to comorbid ID is needed to
inform adjustments in preventive actions to meet unique
needs in these two subgroups.

Significant Outcomes

• Autism should be regarded as a risk-factor for
self-harm and addressed in clinical guidelines
for suicide prevention even if not presented
with depression, anxiety disorder, and ADHD
methods of self-harm in autistic individuals,
particularly those without intellectual disabil-
ity, may be more lethal and should be
addressed in future studies.

Limitations

• The limitation of this study is that we investi-
gated self-harm registered by medical services,
therefore results may not apply to self-harm
that occur without presentation to services.

Suicidal behavior is known to aggregate in families,4
because of shared genetic as well as environmental
factors. There is also evidence of a moderate genetic cor-
relation between autism and intentional self-harm.32
Family-based studies may shed light on familial risks and
help disentangle effects of shared environmental and
genetic factors. A Swedish study found a higher risk of
suicide attempts and death by suicide in full siblings than
in half-siblings of autistic individuals, thus indicating
that genetic rather than environmental factors explain
familial associations between autism and self-harm.27
However, this study needs confirmation, particularly in a
more recent cohorts where autism has been more broadly
diagnosed.

While self-harm is a risk factor for completed suicide
overall, the level of risk increase varies considerably
between methods of self-harm in general population.33
For example, more violent self-harm methods (e.g., hang-
ing, drowning, use of firearms or explosives,
jumping
from a height, or gassing) confer a much poorer progno-
sis than self-harm by poisoning or cutting.28 Yet, there is
some data that self-harm methods differ between autistic
and non-autistic individuals,24 and self-cutting has been
found to be relatively less common in the autistic popula-
tion17 than in the general community.34 Yet, large-scale
studies on this topic are missing.

| Study population and design

The Stockholm Youth Cohort (SYC) is a total population
record-linkage study which includes all children and
young people, up to 17 years old, who were ever resident
in Stockholm County, Sweden between 2001 through
2011 (total N = 735,096).35 The SYC comprises data on
cohort members and their first and second-degree rela-
tives, collected using a range of Swedish national and
regional registries. The cohort was followed-up until
December 31, 2011, when the oldest study participants
were 27 years of age. Our primary outcome was a record
of admission for self-harm, and the analytical sample was
restricted to individuals who were at least 10 years of age
(n = 410,732, Figure 1) in 2011 to exclude accidental self-
harm characteristic of small children.

We identified the full (those who had the same bio-
logical parents as the index person) and half siblings
(those with one common biological parent) of these indi-
viduals using the Swedish Multigenerational register.36

2.2

| Ascertainment of autism

Autism was identified using record linkage with registries
covering all known publicly funded pathways of assess-
ment, care, or special education for autism in Stockholm
County.35 Using this multisource ascertainment method,
12,259 (1.67%) individuals within the cohort were classi-
fied as having autism if been diagnosed according to the
World Health Organization's International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) by codes ICD-9-299, ICD-10 F84, and
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV) 299 and by the denotation of autism by habili-
tation services37 during the study period. We have previ-
ously carried out two validation studies including a case
note review by clinical experts, and a cross validation
study with a national study of
twins, which both
highlighted the validity of the cases recorded as having
autism in the SYC.35

Apart from studying autism as a combined group,
(including ICD-10 codes F84.0 autistic disorder, F84.1
atypical autism, F84.5 Asperger syndrome, and F84.9 per-
vasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified)
we also dichotomized autism based on the presence of
recorded ID in the registers.35 Diagnosis of ID was identi-
fied in accordance with codes: ICD-9: 319, ICD-10: F70–
F79, DSM-IV 317–319.

2.3

| Ascertainment of self-harm

We used the Swedish National Patient Register to identify
individuals within the SYC who had hospital admissions
(including emergency department visits) with a discharge
diagnosis of self-harm, as defined by the, ICD-10 codes
X60-X84 (purposely self-inflicted poisoning or injury) and
Y10-Y34 (events of undetermined intent). We used any

self-harm irrespective of a recorded intent for our main
analysis.

We also categorized self-harm according to method,
i.e. as poisoning (ICD-9: 950-952; 980-982;
ICD-10
X60-X69, Y10-Y19), cutting (ICD-9: 956, 986; ICD-10
forms of self-harm “violent
X78, Y28), and violent
methods” (hanging /strangulation, drowning,
firearm,
jumping from a high place, jumping or lying before mov-
ing object; ICD-9: 953-957, 983-987; ICD 10: X70-X75,
X80,X81,Y20-25, Y30, Y31), with or without known
intent, respectively.

2.4

| Ascertainment of covariates

We included the following variables as potential con-
founders: age and sex of the index person, birth order
(first, second, third, or greater), paternal and maternal
age at birth,38 highest educational qualification of either
(≤9 years, 10–12, ≥13 years) and disposable
parent
household income adjusted for year of ascertainment and
family size (in quintiles) closest to birth,39 migrant house-
hold, defined as a parent or the index person born outside
of Sweden,40 and any history of a psychiatric disorder in
the mother or the father.41

We used the National patient register, the Stockholm
Adult Psychiatry register and the Stockholm County
child and adolescent mental health services register (The
Pastill Register) to identify clinically recorded diagnoses
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) identi-
fied by ICD-10 codes (F90.0, Attention-deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder, predominantly inattentive type; F90.1,
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly
hyperactive type; F90.2, Attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder, combined type; F90.8, Attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder, other type; F90.9, Attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type).

We identified clinically recorded diagnoses of depres-
sive disorders (ICD-10 F32-39), anxiety and stress related
disorders (ICD-10 F40-48) in index persons. To minimize
any possibility of reverse causality leading to spurious
results
(e.g., depressive disorders being diagnosed
because of admission for self-harm), we required the
diagnosis or depression or anxiety disorders to occur
before the date of recorded self-harm.

95% confidence intervals (CIs), taking account of cluster-
individuals born to the same mother. Initial
ing of
models were adjusted for age and sex (Model 1) followed
by additional adjustment for birth order, maternal and
paternal age, highest educational attainment of mother
or father, disposable family income adjusted for family
size at birth in quintiles, birth of parents or child outside
of Sweden and a record of any psychiatric disorders in
the mother or father (Model 2). We repeated these ana-
lyses for three subcategories: poisoning (ICD-9: 950-952;
980-982 and ICD 10: X60-X69; Y19-Y19), cutting (ICD-9:
956, 986; ICD-10: X78; Y28) or violent forms of self-harm
(ICD-9: 953-957, 983-987; ICD-10: X70-X75, X80, X81,
Y20-25, Y30, Y31).

In our second analysis, we investigated how three
common psychiatric comorbidities- ADHD, depression,
and anxiety disorders, influence the risk of self-harm in
autism. For each of these, we created variables with four
categories: no autism or comorbidity, autism only, autism
with the comorbidity, the comorbid condition without
autism. We then estimated the associations of self-harm
with these variables using the approach described above.
In our third analysis, we assessed the risk of self-harm
in full and half siblings of individuals with autism as
compared with the general population. Because full sib-
lings share a greater proportion of their co-segregating
genes (50%), they are genetically more similar than half
siblings who share 25% of their co-segregating genes.
Therefore, if the association between autism and self-
harm was primarily related to shared genetics, we would
expect the relative risk of self-harm in autism to be high-
est followed by non-autistic full-siblings and half-siblings
of people with autism. In the subset of families with more
than one child, we matched each case of autism with up
to 2 full same-sex siblings who did not have a diagnosis
of autism. We then carried out fixed effects conditional
logistic regression analysis to directly compare the risk of
self-harm in individuals with autism with that of their
non-autistic full siblings by estimating odds ratios (ORs).
For these analyses, we adjusted for age and birth order
(model 1) and additionally for maternal and paternal age
at birth (model 2) as these are likely to be non-shared
characteristics between sibling pairs. All analyses were
conducted using Stata 14.43

with autism were slightly younger, more likely to be
male, come from families with lower education and
parental history of a recorded psychiatric disorder than
their peers. Individuals with autism and ID were more
likely to come from families in the lowest quintile of fam-
ily income and belong to migrant households than the
general population, while the reverse was true for indi-
viduals with autism without ID (Table 1).

Nearly 3% of autistic individuals had been hospital-
ized at least once for self-harm between the ages of
10 and 27 years, compared with 0.8% of their non-autistic
peers (Table 1). Hospitalizations for self-harm were more
common in autistic individuals without ID (3.6%) than in
those who had both diagnoses (1.3%). Although, poison-
ing was the most common self-harm method among
admitted individuals regardless of autism, over 15% of all
admissions in the autistic group were because of self-
cutting compared with 8% in the non-autistic group.

Table 2 shows the RRs for admission because of self-
harm in autistic individuals (autism without or with ID),
as compared with the non-autistic population. Individ-
uals with autism had an almost a fivefold adjusted rela-
tive risk for admissions (RR 5.0 [95% CI 4.4–5.6]) which

was greatest for autism without ID (5.9 [5.2–6.7]), but
also increased for autism with ID (RR 1.9 [1.3–2.7]). A
pattern of high RR was evident in analyses for all the
methods of self-harm we examined (poisoning, cutting
and violent forms of self-harm), however, RR related to
self-cutting and violent methods of self-harm were a par-
ticularly high in the autistic compared with the non-
autistic population (Table 2).

Risks of self-harm in autism (with and without ID)
cross-classified according to psychiatric comorbidities are
shown in Table 3. The risk of self-harm was increased in
autism, particularly in the subgroup without ID, also
when occurring without other comorbidities. Risks were
about fivefold and similar for single diagnoses of either
autism without ID (RR 5.9 [95% CI 4.9–7.0]), or ADHD
(6.1 [5.6–6.8]), or depression (4.6 [4.2–5.0]), and somewhat
lower in anxiety disorders (3.0 [2.8–3.3]). Individuals with
autism without ID and either ADHD, depression, or anxi-
ety disorder additionally, had about a tenfold increase in
risk for self-harm as compared with those without any
diagnoses in the fully adjusted model (Model 2).

Non-autistic full (1.6 [1.3–2.0]) and half siblings (1.4 [1.1–
1.9]) of individuals with autism had a higher risk of
self-harm as compared with population controls. These
associations were more apparent for siblings of children
with autism without intellectual disability (Table 4).

Finally, we directly compared the risk of self-harm in
autistic individuals (n = 2902) to that in matched same-
sexed full
siblings without a diagnosis of autism
(n = 3410). Autistic individuals had an over a twofold
risk of self-harm (adjusted OR 2.2 [1.5–3.3]) compared
with their non-autistic siblings (Table S1).

This large population-based study demonstrates a clear
overrepresentation of hospital admissions and emergency
department visits for self-harm in adolescents and young
adults with autism in comparison to their typically devel-
oping peers. This increased risk was evident in autistic
individuals without any recorded diagnosis of ADHD,
depression, or anxiety disorders, which are well estab-
lished as risk-factors for self-harm. The magnitude of sin-
gle risks of self-harm in autism were equipollent the risks
that were observed in ADHD, depression, and anxiety
disorders per se, indicating that autism might be an inde-
pendent risk factor for self-harm. The risk of self-harm
was particularly high in autistic individuals without ID
although, an increased risk was observed also in individ-
uals with autism with ID, compared with non-autistic

or

genetic

environmental

individuals. Furthermore, sibling-analyses indicated that
the increased risk of self-harm in autism largely reflects
factors specific to these conditions rather than shared
familial
factors. Lastly,
although the most common method of self-harm was
self-poisoning in autistic and non-autistic individuals
alike, relative risks of self-harm by especially cutting but
also by violent methods (gassing, hanging, strangulation/
suffocation, drowning, jumping and firearms) were par-
ticularly increased in the autistic group.

Our overall results, including a particularly marked
risk increase of self-harm among autistic individuals
without ID, confirm those of a previous case–control
study from Sweden.27 Yet, our study extends its findings
by focusing on a recent population diagnosed according
to today's more inclusive diagnostic practices. We further-
more base our analyses on a more detailed case ascertain-
ment, also including data from outpatient health services
(comprising child and adolescent as well as adult psychi-
atric care) as opposed to prior work that has mainly
relied on diagnoses retrieved solely from inpatient care.
Lastly, we adjusted estimates of associations for a fuller
set of sociodemographic factors such as parental educa-
tional attainment and disposable family income adjusted

We found that autistic individuals were more likely to
be admitted to hospitals/emergency departments for self-
harm regardless of common comorbid psychiatric disor-
ders, which is consistent with recent research from Tai-
wan.23 Our results, however, contrast those of a smaller

intentional self-harm was attenuated with adjustment for
psychiatric comorbidities.22 The Finnish study's approach
of adjusting for comorbidities that can be regarded as
mediators of the relationship between autism and self-
harm may have introduced collider bias that explain dis-
crepancies between their and our findings. In our study,
an attempt to introduce temporal alignment of recorded
events (the diagnosis of comorbid disorder such as
depression preceded the record of self-harm event), con-
trasting other register-based studies22,23,27 (adjusting for
life-time comorbidity). Our approach aimed to minimize
any possibility of reverse causality leading to spurious
results. However, we reported equally concerning risk
increase for self-harm.

Our comparisons of autistic individuals with their sib-
lings and half-siblings indicate that autism is associated
to self-harm independently of shared familial
factors
(i.e., the 50% of genes and the aspects of the family envi-
ronment, such as parenting style or living conditions,
that is shared by siblings).

Yet, we also show, in line with others,27 that such fac-
tors have some impact as siblings of autistic individuals
were somewhat more likely to have self-harmed than the
general population.27 As we did not observe any clear
gradient between full and half-siblings, shared environ-
mental factors, rather than genes, may be important for
self-harm in autism.

Self-harm methods used by autistic individuals have
not been well characterized up to date.44 Self-cutting and
poisoning are the most prevalent methods, in community
and hospital-based studies, respectively.4,45 In accor-
dance, poisoning was by far the most common self-harm
method in our study of hospital admissions. Yet, autistic
individuals in our study, and especially those without ID,
had a more notable increased risk for admissions because
of self-cutting than poising. This subgroup seemingly also
had a very high risk of admissions because of violent self-
harm, although this finding was based on small numbers.
The results are noteworthy since violent self-harm has a
poorer prognosis,28,46 and since self-cutting may be more
predictive of suicide in autism than among typically
developing people.44

and adjusted for a range of individual and family level
variables and could use siblings as a comparison group to
adjust
for familial confounding. Methodological con-
cerns, other than poor control for psychiatric comorbid-
ities and other confounding factors, such as small and
selected samples and cross-sectional design also hamper
interpretation of results from many prior studies.17,20,30

However, the results need to be interpreted in the
light of some limitations. Since we could only include
to emergency
incidents of self-harm which present
departments or otherwise result in in-patient care, the
prevalence of self-harm in our study is almost certainly
an under-estimate. This outcome misclassification may
be nondifferential, that is, if the rate of underreporting
may be similar in individuals with and without autism,
and, if so, result in an underestimation of any true associ-
ation between autism and self-harm. It may, however,
also be that autistic people are more or less likely than
their peers to seek emergency and/or receive in-patient
care for self-harm issues. If, for example, individuals with
autism are more likely than the general population to be
admitted for self-harm, for example, because of a more
extensive surveillance by health-care services, our results
may instead overestimate true associations.

Misclassification may

concern identification of
comorbidities in this register-based study, as also mental
disorders other than self-harm may be differentially
detected by services. Furthermore, stratification or adjust-
ment for a mediator may introduce collider stratification
bias in any study, this requires that also our findings as
those of other researchers, regarding the relative risks of
self-harm in presence or absence of comorbid conditions
should be interpreted with caution.

In conclusion, in this total population-based study of
young individuals we found that autism was associated to
increased risk of self-harm independently of comorbid
ADHD, depression and anxiety disorders and that
methods of self-harm used by autistic individuals, partic-
ularly those without intellectual disability, may be more
lethal that those used by non-autistic peers. Together,
these findings indicate that self-harm, an important pre-
dictor of suicide in the general population, if present in
young autistic individuals should be a matter of great
clinical concern as well as prompt and adequate safe-
planning actions.

A major strength of this study is the population-based
design and inclusion of a large contemporary sample
where autism was comprehensively ascertained. Self-
harm was prospectively recorded by clinicians and
retrieved from a nationwide health care register, mini-
mizing any recall or reporting bias. We were also able to
reduce bias from confounding, since we had access to
