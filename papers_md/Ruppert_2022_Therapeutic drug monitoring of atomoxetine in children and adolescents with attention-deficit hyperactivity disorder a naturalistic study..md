Abstract
The selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine is potentially among the first-line pharmacotherapy options for 
ADHD. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with the quantification and interpretation of atomoxetine serum concentra-
tions is used to determine an individual dose followed by an optimal effectiveness and minimal side effects. The aim of this 
retrospective pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analysis was to derive age-appropriate recommendations for the imple-
mentation of TDM to improve the efficacy and tolerability of atomoxetine in children and adolescents. Using the analytical 
method of high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, 94 serum concentrations of 74 patients between 6 
and 21 years of age were determined. Therapeutic effectiveness and side effects were evaluated according to the categories 
“low”, “moderate”, and “significant”. As part of TDM, a time interval with maximum concentrations of 1–3 h after the 
administration of atomoxetine was determined for blood sampling. In this time interval, a significant correlation between the 
weight-normalized dose and the serum concentrations was found. The efficacy as well as the tolerability proved to be mainly 
moderate or significant. A preliminary therapeutic reference range was between 100 and 400 ng/ml. Naturalistic studies have 
limitations. Therefore, and due to a limited study population, the results have to be regarded as preliminary observations 
that must be confirmed in further studies. The preliminary therapeutic reference range for children and adolescents proved 
to be narrower than the reference range for adult patients. However, due to good efficacy and tolerability an exact reference 
range remained difficult to determine.

Introduction

Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 
(NARI) and is potentially among the first-line pharmacother-
apy options in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), one of the most common psychiatric dis-
orders in children and adolescents (Wong et al. 1982; Sauer 
et al. 2005; Briars and Todd 2016; Arbeitsgemeinschaft 
der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften 
2017; Falkai et al. 2018). Compared to placebo, atomoxetine 
shows a significantly stronger effect in terms of symptom 
reduction and improvement of functional abilities in chil-
dren and adolescents with ADHD (Michelson et al. 2001, 
2002; Gayleard and Mychailyszyn 2017). If a therapy with 
psychostimulants is not sufficiently effective, if side effects 
occur, contraindications exist or if coexisting disorders are 
present, a guideline-based therapy considers atomoxetine to

be a second-best choice following methylphenidate (Lilly 
Deutschland Gmbh 2015; Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wis-
senschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften 2017; 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018). 
Almost one third of the children who initially received meth-
ylphenidate and later on atomoxetine, responded selectively 
better to one of the two drugs (Newcorn et al. 2008).

However, there are interindividual differences in the phar-
macokinetics of atomoxetine; fluctuations in serum concen-
trations and a different therapeutic response may be the con-
sequence (Hiemke et al. 2012, 2018). Not only parameters 
such as age, comorbidities, comedications, compliance and 
smoking, but also genetic polymorphisms can have an influ-
ence on pharmacokinetics (Paulzen et al. 2008; Hiemke et al. 
2012). With regard to genetic polymorphisms and their influ-
ence on the metabolism of atomoxetine, the main focus is on 
cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP enzymes), whose activity 
can be altered by such polymorphisms. The metabolism of 
atomoxetine to the main metabolite 4-hydroxyatomoxetine 
is primarily mediated by CYP2D6 (Ring et al. 2002). The 
side metabolite N-desmethylatomoxetine is mainly catalyzed 
by CYP2C19 (Ring et al. 2002). The influence of CYP2C19 
on the metabolism of atomoxetine is estimated to be small 
(Sauer et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2016).

Regarding the activity of CYP2D6, "extensive metabo-
lizers" (EM) and "poor metabolizers" (PM) can be distin-
guished. More than 90% of all individuals, the so-called EM, 
show a normal activity of CYP2D6 (Sauer et al. 2005; Lilly 
Deutschland Gmbh 2015). The two CYP polymorphisms 
lead to clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinet-
ics of atomoxetine. PM can have up to ten times higher mean 
serum concentrations than EM; the half-life can increase 
four to five times (Sauer et al. 2003, 2005; Witcher et al. 
2003). Pharmacokinetics can also be influenced by drug 
interactions. Besides atomoxetine, approximately 25% of all 
current drugs are metabolized by CYP2D6 and can, there-
fore, interact with atomoxetine when taken simultaneously 
(Kirchheiner et al. 2004; Ingelman-Sundberg 2004; Zhou 
2009).

To assess the influence of interindividual pharmacoki-
netic differences on the therapeutic effect and the tolerability 
of atomoxetine, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be 
useful (Walitza et al. 2016). TDM represents a cost-effective, 
personalized method to optimize psychopharmacotherapy 
(Jang et al. 2016; Hiemke et al. 2018). The aim is to assess 
an individual, effective drug dose with the best possible 
outcome and a minimal risk of side effects (Hiemke et al. 
2012; Jang et al. 2016). This can be achieved by quantifying 
and interpreting serum drug concentrations with regards to 
individual patients’ characteristics as well as pharmacoki-
netic aspects of a pharmacon (Hiemke et al. 2018). Serum 
concentrations which are accompanied by maximum effi-
cacy and minimum side effects lie within the therapeutic 

reference range (Hiemke et al. 2012, 2018). The therapeutic 
reference range for atomoxetine, which has so far only been 
defined for adults, is between 200 and 1000 ng/ml for serum 
concentrations measured 60–90 min after dosing of 1.2 mg/
(kg x day) atomoxetine (Hiemke et al. 2018). For children 
and adolescents, a therapeutic reference range has not been 
established yet. Sugimoto et al. showed a lower threshold 
of 64.6 ng/ml for pediatric patients (Sugimoto et al. 2021). 
Due to the short half-life of atomoxetine, blood samples for 
the determination of serum concentrations should be taken 
at the time of maximum serum concentration Cmax (Hiemke 
et al. 2018).

Especially in children and adolescents, pharmacokinetic 
aspects can vary and deviate from those of an adult (Gerlach 
et al. 2006; Mehler-Wex et al. 2009; Pichini et al. 2009). 
However,  studies  on  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of 
atomoxetine and other psychotropic drugs in children and 
adolescents are scarce. Approximately one third of psycho-
tropic drugs in children and adolescents are used off-label 
(Koelch et al. 2009). In an American study, children with 
ADHD aged 3–5 years have already shown a high use of 
off-label drug prescriptions, including atomoxetine (Panther 
et al. 2017). However, in children younger than 6 years, only 
non-pharmaceutical interventions are recommended (Taylor 
et al. 2004; Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactiv-
ity Disorder 2011; Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftli-
chen  Medizinischen  Fachgesellschaften  2017;  National 
Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence 2018).  A  non-
evidence-based prescription carries the risk of increased, 
unpredictable side effects or an ineffective therapy due to 
altered pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients (Egberts et al. 
2014). For these reasons, TDM is always indicated in chil-
dren and adolescents taking psychotropic drugs (Egberts 
et al. 2011; Gerlach et al. 2016; Hiemke et al. 2018).

The aim of this retrospective pharmacokinetic–pharma-
codynamic analysis was to derive age-appropriate recom-
mendations for the implementation of TDM to improve the 
efficacy and tolerability of atomoxetine in children and ado-
lescents. The focus is especially on the therapeutic efficacy 
and side effects to determine a possible therapeutic reference 
range.

Subjects and methods

Study design

Within this retrospective, naturalistic study, 94 atomox-
etine serum concentrations were analyzed in the neurop-
harmacological  research  laboratory  of  the  Department 
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and 
Psychosomatics in Freiburg. To determine these serum 
concentrations,  venous  blood  samples  were  collected 

1 3from 74 children and adolescents between June 2005 and 
July 2014. The children and adolescents were treated in 
the outpatient or inpatient Department of Child and Ado-
lescent Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics in 
Freiburg. In addition, some blood samples analyzed in the 
neuropharmacological research laboratory in Freiburg as 
part of clinical routine TDM request were also collected 
from  pediatric  patients  treated  in  outpatient  and  inpa-
tient settings of external university departments for child 
and adolescent psychiatry. All children and adolescents 
included in this study were diagnosed with ADHD. Since 
serum concentrations were determined as part of the clini-
cal routine, no written informed consent was required for 
collecting and analyzing blood samples as part of TDM.

Data collection

The collection of patient data for the interpretation of the 
atomoxetine serum concentrations was based on informa-
tion on request forms. In addition to the patient’s name 
and date of birth, the request forms contained information 
on the dose and dose-distribution, the body weight, the 
last administration of atomoxetine, the last readjustment 
of dose and the time and date of blood sample. The main 
diagnosis and further comorbidities after ICD-10, concom-
itant medications, the use of oral contraception and smok-
ing habits were further required information. The clinical 
response and the severity of side effects were described by 
the treating physician using the categories “low”, “mod-
erate”, and “strong/severe”; a standardized questionnaire 
for a more precise assessment did not exist. The request 
forms were sent to the laboratory together with the blood 
samples. However, some blood samples were handed in 
without  the  recommended  request  form.  Additionally, 
there was a lack of information on some request forms. 
For this reason, the number of serum concentrations with 
complete information on the request forms was limited.

Sample preparation

After the collection of the venous blood sample, the stand-
ardized  preparation  was  performed.  To  obtain  serum, 
blood  was  centrifuged  at  4000  rpm  for  10  min.  The 
supernatant was transferred into a new vial. Afterwards, 
the samples could either be analyzed immediately or be 
kept at − 80 °C until analysis. The serum of the external 
samples was obtained on site and then transported to the 
neuropharmacological research laboratory in Freiburg for 
further analysis. Serum concentrations were analyzed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet 
detection (UV-HPLC).

Quantification of atomoxetine

For the quantification of atomoxetine, the serum first had 
to be purified. For this purpose, 100 μl of the serum was 
enriched with 10 μl of the internal standard D-clomipramine 
(500 ng/ml), 10 μl water and 100 μl methanol. After pre-
texturing, the solution was centrifuged at 9000 U for 15 min 
and the supernatant was placed in a new vial. An autoinjec-
tor was used to inject a volume of 50 μl of the sample into 
the chromatographic system and to start the operation cycle. 
The control sample was analyzed in the same way as the 
patient sample and aimed to detect measurement variations. 
It contained 100 μl serum of a healthy patient without the 
intake of atomoxetine, 10 μl atomoxetine in a defined con-
centration, 10 μl of the internal standard D-clomipramine 
and 100 μl methanol. The internal standard D-clomipramine 
was added to each sample in a defined concentration as a rel-
ative reference size (Funk et al. 2005). The chromatographic 
system was comprised of an Agilent 1100 series RP-HPLC 
apparatus with UV detection (BioRad, Waldbronn, Ger-
many). In total, the operation cycle took 25 min. After the 
start of the operation cycle with the auto-injection, the sam-
ple passed the extraction column (LiChrospher CN 20 µm, 
MZ-Analysentechnik, Mainz, Germany) at a flow rate of 
1.5 ml/min for 7 min using a washing eluent containing 90% 
water and 10% acetonitrile. The aim was the purification and 
removal of interfering components. In the subsequent phase, 
which lasted 10 min, the sample was directed to a second 
pump. At a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, the sample passed the 
analytical column (LiChroCART 125–4 HPLC cartridge) 
with a stationary phase (LiChrospher 60 RP-select 5 µm, 
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and was separated substrate 
specific. The eluent in the analytical column consisted of 
640 ml 40 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 3.35) and 310 ml acetoni-
trile. After 17 min both pumps were re-equilibrated. UV 
light with a wavelength of 214 nm was used for the detec-
tion of atomoxetine. The retention time of atomoxetine was 
12.3 min, that of D-clomipramine 16.6 min.

For the UV-HPLC method, linearity (r > 0.9999) was 
confirmed in a range from 5 to 2000 ng/ml. The lower limit 
of determination was 5 ng/ml. The intraday variance was 
between  2  and  4.3%  depending  on  the  concentration  of 
atomoxetine.

Data analysis

For statistical analysis, calculations were performed with 
Microsoft   Excel ®  (Version  16,  Microsoft,  Microsoft 
Deutschland GmbH, Munich) and  SigmaPlot® (Version 14, 
Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath). Graphs were created with 
 Sigmaplot®.

Values were presented as mean value MW ± standard 
deviation SD. The range was defined by the minimum and

maximum value (min–max). For parametrically distributed 
data, correlations between two variables were calculated 
using the Pearson correlation coefficient rP. For non-par-
ametric distributions, the Spearman rank correlation coef-
ficient rS was calculated. Low correlations were defined 
as r < 0.5, moderate correlations as r = 0.5 to  r = 0.8 and 
strong correlations as r > 0.8. The presence of a normal 
distribution was tested by Shapiro–Wilk. Possible differ-
ences of two unrelated samples coming from a normally 
distributed collective were tested by the two-sided t test. 
The significance level was set at α = 0.05. For more than 
two independent samples, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used 
for analysis of variance. To compare serum concentrations 
present at a specific time after atomoxetine intake, serum 
concentrations  were  backcalculated  using  the  following 
formula to the time point of x (in hours) after atomoxetine 
intake: concentration at x = concentration at time of blood 
collection/e^(− 0.693 × (Δt between last dose and blood 
collection − x)/t1/2) with t1/2 = 3.6 h for a EM according to 
the product characteristics of Strattera® (Bauer 2014; Lilly 
Deutschland Gmbh 2015; Hiemke et al. 2018). Serum con-
centrations of 0 ng/ml could not be backcalculated and had 
to be excluded.

Results

Study population

94 atomoxetine serum concentrations of 74 children and 
adolescents (88 boys, 6 girls) aged between 6 and 21 years 
were available for the analysis of this study (Table 1). Due to 
incomplete information on the request forms, the following 
analysis could only be described for a limited population. 
The average body weight was 45.4 ± 18.8 kg (n = 78), the 
average daily dose was 42.9 ± 18.6 mg/day (n = 82). An ICD-
10 diagnosis was given for 44 of the 74 children and ado-
lescents. 16 children and adolescents additionally suffered 
from up to three comorbid disorders. A comedication was 
taken by 22 children. None of the pediatric patients used oral 
contraception. Three adolescents reported nicotine abuse.

For a population of n = 27 all parameters necessary to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine were avail-
able. As Witcher et al. (2003) showed in their pharmacoki-
netic  analyses  for  children  and  adolescents,  parameters 
including age, body weight, dose and especially the time 
interval between atomoxetine intake and blood collection 
were indispensable for this purpose. Only one serum concen-
tration per patient was included for the population of n = 27, 
therefore, the data did not need to be corrected for multiple 
inclusion. If multiple measurements were obtained from one 
patient, the concentration that was within the time window 
of 1–4 h with maximum serum concentrations according to 

Witcher et al. (2003) was selected. The characteristics of the 
population of n = 27 are outlined in Table 2. In this popula-
tion, children ≤ 12 years of age took a significantly lower 
absolute dose (37.4 ± 16.0 mg/day) than children > 12 years 
of age (60.0 ± 16.1 mg/day) (p = 0.001). The weight-normal-
ized dose in the age group ≤ 12 years was, however, higher 
than in the age group > 12 years (p = 0.076). A diagnosis 
was documented for 20 of the 27 children and adolescents. 
The most frequent diagnoses according to ICD-10 were pre-
dominantly inattentive attention-deficit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD) (F90.0) in combination with other comorbid 
diagnoses (n = 7), followed by predominantly hyperactive 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (F90.1) 
(n = 6). 12 patients suffered from further comorbid disor-
ders. Seven children and adolescents reported a comedica-
tion. Among the concomitant medications, methylphenidate 
and risperidone were the ones administered most frequently.

Relationship between serum concentration 
and time of collection

The  mean  value  of  all  94  serum  concentrations  was 
203.4 ± 293.0 ng/ml (0–1625 ng/ml). The 27 serum con-
centrations  with  complete  information  on  pharmacoki-
netic parameters ranged from 0 to 1334 ng/ml (mean value 
213.9 ± 277.8 ng/ml). The spectrum of the 27 serum concen-
trations normalized to 1 mg/kg ranged from 0 (ng/ml)/(mg/
kg) to 1037.6 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg) (mean value 207.0 ± 244.1 
(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)).

Time intervals between the intake of atomoxetine and 
the  time  of  blood  collection  were  distributed  from  1  to 
36 h for n = 27 (mean value 10.4 ± 9.8 h). The relationship 
between serum concentrations and time intervals showed a 
rapid absorption with peak concentrations in the first few 
hours after intake. As time proceeded, serum concentrations 
decreased. 37% of the serum concentrations were within 
the therapeutic reference range of 200–1000 ng/ml valid 
for adult patients (Hiemke et al. 2018). 59% of the serum 
concentrations were below the therapeutic reference range—
most of them were associated with advanced time intervals.
Witcher et al. (2003) presented pharmacokinetic analy-
ses of atomoxetine for 16 children and adolescents with 
the genotype of an EM and determined a time window of 
maximum serum concentrations between 1 and 4 h after 
the  intake.  In  this  study,  ten  measurements  were  taken 
within the time interval of 1–4 h. Low serum concentra-
tions beyond the 95% confidence interval were excluded due 
to a potential non-compliance (n = 2). Weight-normalized 
concentrations ranged from 146.9 to 467.9 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg) 
in this time interval (n = 10). A comparison of weight-nor-
malized serum concentrations in the time interval of 1–4 h 
(299.1 ± 116.3 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), n = 10) with the subsequent 
time interval of 5–9 h (155.6 ± 46.3 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg), n = 4)

SD standard deviation, min minimum, max maximum, ICD-10 International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems

showed a significant difference (p = 0.006) using t test. A 
normal distribution according to Shapiro–Wilk was present.
For a better comparison of serum concentrations within 
the time window of 1–4 h, concentrations with a given time 
interval were backcalculated to time points of 1 h, 1.5 h, 3 h 
and 4 h after atomoxetine intake. Serum concentrations of 
0 ng/ml could not be backcalculated. Three outliers with 
concentrations beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range on 
the  boxplot  were  excluded  as  potentially  resulting  from 
PM. Their concentrations at the time point of 1.5 h were 
14,797.1 ng/ml, 243,604.5 ng/ml and 1619.5 ng/ml. The 
mean values of the remaining serum concentrations were 
381.3 ± 238.3 ng/ml (n  = 20) at 1 h, 346.3 ± 216.4 ng/ml 
(n = 20) at 1.5 h, 259.5 ± 162.2 ng/ml (n  = 20) at 3 h and 
214.0 ± 133.8 ng/ml (n = 20) at 4 h after atomoxetine intake. 
A peak concentration 1 h after intake with a subsequently 
decreasing  concentration  curve  could  be  demonstrated. 
Serum concentrations at the time point of 4 h were already 
significantly lower than concentrations at the time point of 
1 h and 1.5 h (p = 0.010 or p = 0.027).

Relationship between serum concentration 
and daily dose

In the time interval between 1 and 4 h after the intake of ato-
moxetine, a moderate correlation according to Pearson was 
shown for the relationship between serum concentrations 
and the absolute daily dose (rP = 0.534, p = 0.112, n = 10). 
Between serum concentrations and the relative, weight-nor-
malized daily dose a stronger, significant correlation was 
observed (rP = 0.632,  p = 0.050,  n = 10). The parameters 
were normally distributed. After the additional exclusion 
of patients with comedication or nicotine abuse to rule out 
an interaction with these potentially interfering variables, a 
significant correlation of rP = 0.807 was found (rP = 0.807, 
p = 0.028, n = 7).

After backcalculating all serum concentrations to the 
time point of 90 min after atomoxetine intake, a significant, 

moderate correlation between serum concentrations at the 
time point of 90 min and the weight-normalized daily dose 
could be confirmed (rP = 0.482,  p = 0.030,  n = 20). After 
excluding patients with comedication or nicotine abuse and 
low serum concentrations with possible non-compliance a 
significant, moderate correlation was supported (rP = 0.718, 
p = 0.013, n = 11).

Relationship between serum concentration 
and therapeutic efficacy

Data on the efficacy of atomoxetine were available for 60 
serum concentrations. On the request form, categories of a 
“low”, “moderate” and “strong” efficacy were distinguished. 
27 children noted a marked, 28 a moderate improvement of 
their symptoms. Only five reported little or no effect.

With regard to serum concentrations and the weight-nor-
malized daily dose, potential differences between these three 
categories were investigated. The mean value for serum 
concentrations with little effect on symptom reduction was 
43 ± 56.4 ng/ml (n = 4), for concentrations with a moderate 
effect 176.5 ± 299.8 ng/ml (n = 27) and for concentrations 
with a strong effect 173.5 ± 176.9 ng/ml (n = 25). The corre-
sponding median values and interquartile ranges are listed in 
Table 3. Using Kruskal–Wallis test, no significant difference 
was found between the three categories (X2 = 2.4;  df = 2; 
p = 0.299). In contrast, the comparison of just two categories 
using t test showed significant differences not only between 
the serum concentrations with a low and moderate effect 
(p = 0.047) but also between the concentrations with a low 
and strong effect (p = 0.011) (Table 3). Comparatively lower 
serum concentrations thus seemed to be associated with a 
low efficacy, higher serum concentrations with a moderate 
and strong efficacy (Fig. 1).

Regarding the relationship between weight-normalized 
daily dose and efficacy, no significant difference could be 
observed (X2 = 2.2; df = 2; p = 0.332). The mean value of the 
weight-normalized daily dose with a moderate and strong

mean value and standard deviation for concentrations with 
moderate efficacy could be explained by an outlier with a 
concentration of 14797.1 ng/ml. Excluding the outlier, the 
mean value was 376.1 ± 257.2 ng/ml (n = 9). The median 
value with the interquartile range from the 25th to the 
75th percentile was 456.7 ng/ml with a range from 202.2 
to 653.3 ng/ml for concentrations with moderate efficacy 
and 257.2 ng/ml with a range from 192.0 to 306.8 ng/ml 
for concentrations with strong efficacy. Considering the 
time interval, no difference between the concentrations 
with a low, moderate or strong effect could be demon-
strated (X2 = 2.3;  df = 2;  p = 0.321). Therefore, a correla-
tion between the level of serum concentration and efficacy 
could not be verified, when taking the time interval into 
account.

After excluding the outlier, all mean values as well as all 
median values with the interquartile ranges were within the 
therapeutic reference range originally being valid for adult 
patients (Hiemke et al. 2018). Regarding the individual 

concentrations, few concentrations going along with a mod-
erate or strong efficacy were below the therapeutic range 
given by Hiemke et al. Only the outlier with a moderate 
efficacy was above the range.

The mean values for weight-normalized doses at the time 
point of 90 min with a low, moderate and strong effect were 
1.1 mg/(kg x day) (n = 1), 1.1 ± 0.3 mg/(kg x day) (n = 10) 
and 1.0 ± 0,3 mg/(kg x day) (n = 8); a difference could not be 
shown using Kruskal–Wallis (X2 = 2.56; df = 2; p = 0.880).
A therapeutic reference range with a defined upper and 
lower threshold for children and adolescents does not yet 
exist. According to the consensus guidelines, the arithme-
tic mean ± standard deviation of serum concentrations at 
which a psychotropic drug is well effective can serve as a 
preliminary reference range in the absence of a therapeu-
tic reference range (Hiemke et al. 2018). Therefore, serum 
concentrations  with  a  strong  effect  at  the  time  point  of 
90 min after atomoxetine intake were evaluated (n = 8) and 
a therapeutic reference range of 248 ng/ml ± 153 ng/ml, i.e.

approximately from 100 to 400 ng/ml, could be suggested. 
As concentrations with known efficacy were not normally 
distributed, the interquartile range of serum concentrations 
with a strong effect at the time point of 90 min was addition-
ally calculated to provide another possible therapeutic refer-
ence range (Bengtsson 2004). The 25th and the 75th percen-
tile of the interquartile range were 192.0 and 306.8 ng/ml 
(n = 8). Hence, using the interquartile range, the therapeutic 
reference range from approximately 200 to 300 ng/ml was 
narrower.

Relationship between serum concentration and side 
effects

Side effects were reported for 56 serum concentrations. 
Whereas severe side effects were described for eight meas-
urements, five measurements were accompanied by moder-
ate side effects. In most cases (n = 43), there were no or just 
minor side effects.

Irrespective of the degree of side effects, all serum con-
centrations were in a similar range. Using Kruskal–Wal-
lis, no significant difference was found between the serum 
concentrations  with  minor,  moderate  or  either  severe 
side  effects  (X2 = 0.59;  df = 2;  p = 0.743).  Children  with 
minor side effects had an average serum concentration of 
187.5 ± 274.9 ng/ml (n  = 40). The mean values of serum 

Therapeutic drug monitoring of atomoxetine in children and adolescents with attention‑deficit/…1 3954

concentrations with moderate and severe side effects were 
113.0 ± 112.9 ng/ml (n = 5) and 160.5 ± 131.4 ng/ml (n = 7) 
(Fig. 1). The corresponding median values and interquartile 
ranges are listed in Table 3.

Analysis of weight-normalized doses showed a signifi-
cant difference depending on the degree of side effects 
(X2 = 15.78; df = 2; p = 0.0004). The mean value of weight-
normalized doses accompanied by minor side effects was 
1.1 ± 0.3 mg/(kg x day) (n  = 40). For those with moderate 
side effects the mean value was 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/(kg x day) 
(n = 5) and for those with severe side effects 0.5 ± 0.1 mg/
(kg x day) (n = 7) (Table  3). Thus, despite significantly 
lower weight-normalized doses for children with severe 
side effects, their serum concentrations were comparable 
with those for patients with minor or moderate side effects. 
For children and adolescents with moderate and minor side 
effects, serum concentrations seemed to be associated with 
higher doses (Fig. 1).

To consider the time interval for the analysis of side 
effects, 20 serum concentrations could be backcalculated 
to the time point of 90 min after atomoxetine intake. The 
mean  value  for  serum  concentrations  with  minor  side 
effects was 1329.9 ± 3731.3 ng/ml (n = 15) including an 
outlier  with  a  serum  concentration  of  14,797.1  ng/ml. 
The corresponding median value was 368.8 ng/ml with 
an interquartile range from 239.2 to 565.9 ng/ml (n = 15). 
For concentrations with moderate side effects, the mean 
value was 282.8 ± 16.6 ng/ml (n = 2) and the median value 
was 282.8 ng/ml with an interquartile range from 277.0 to 
288.7 ng/ml (n = 2). For concentrations with severe side 
effects, the mean  value was 81233.4 ± 140617.5 ng/ml 
(n = 3) including an outlier with a serum concentration of 
243694.5 ng/ml. The median value was 69.9 ng/ml with 
an interquartile range from 47.9 to 121837.2 ng/ml (n = 3). 
A significant difference between these three groups could 
still not be demonstrated (X2 = 0.45; df = 2; p = 0.798).

The  mean  values  of  concentrations  with  minor  as 
well  as  with  severe  side  effects  were  above  the  thera-
peutic range between 200 and 1000 ng/ml valid for adult 
patients  (Hiemke  et  al.  2018).  The  high  mean  values 
resulted from two extreme high concentrations, of which 
only the higher one (243694.5 ng/ml) was associated with 
severe side effects. A comedication or nicotine abuse did 
not exist. Excluding both outliers, the mean values were 
367.9 ± 213.7 ng/ml for concentrations with minor side 
effects (n = 14) and 47.9 ± 31.2 ng/ml for concentrations 
with severe side effects (n = 2). The other two concentra-
tions with severe side effects were thus below the thera-
peutic reference range.

As  already  suspected,  analysis  of  weight-normalized 
doses at the time point of 90 min confirmed a significant 
difference depending on the degree of side effects (X2 = 8.09; 
df = 2;  p = 0.018). The mean value of weight-normalized 

doses going along with minor side effects was 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/
(kg  x  day)  (n = 15)  and  with  moderate  side  effects 
1.0 ± 0.2  mg/(kg  x  day)  (n  = 2).  Doses  with  severe  side 
effects had a mean value of only 0.5 ± 0.03 mg/(kg x day) 
(n = 3) (Table 3).

Discussion

This retrospective pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
analysis is one of the few studies examining the pharma-
cokinetics of atomoxetine in children and adolescents. 
Although the level of recommendation for TDM in chil-
dren and adolescents corresponds to a level one with a 
strong recommendation of an implementation, only few 
studies exist for this specific age group (Hiemke et al. 
2018). In the consensus guidelines, recommendations for 
therapeutic reference ranges have so far only applied to 
adult patients (Hiemke et al. 2018). The result is a dis-
crepancy between evidence and prescription frequency 
in children and adolescents. Since blood should be with-
drawn at the time of maximum drug concentration Cmax 
in the context of TDM, one focus of this study was the 
evaluation of a time interval for blood collection for chil-
dren and adolescents (Hiemke et al. 2018). Furthermore, 
the relationship between dose and serum concentrations 
and, in particular, efficacy and tolerability were evaluated 
to verify an age-appropriate therapeutic reference range.

In  one  of  the  few  available  studies  for  children  and 
adolescents, Witcher et al. (2003) examined the pharma-
cokinetic characteristics in a collective of 21 children and 
adolescents. According to Witcher et al. (2003), maximum 
serum concentrations were within a time interval of 1–4 h 
after the intake of atomoxetine. In this study, serum con-
centrations normalized to 1 mg/kg could be well classified 
into the pharmacokinetic profiles of Witcher et al. (2003). 
An extension of the time interval was not reasonable. In 
the time interval of 5–9 h, serum concentrations dropped 
to significantly lower levels. However, when correcting 
concentrations for defined time points of 1 h, 1.5 h, 3 h and 
4 h, significantly lower serum concentrations could already 
be verified at 4 h compared to 1 h and 1.5 h after atomox-
etine intake. In the consensus guidelines valid for adults, 
a narrower time interval of 60–90 min was described for 
blood collection (Hiemke et al. 2018). The time interval 
of 60–90 min was also used in several studies (Farid et al. 
1985; Michelson et al. 2007; Hazell et al. 2009). Sauer 
et al. supported a time interval of 1–3 h (Sauer et al. 2003). 
In this study, peak concentrations could be confirmed at 
60 min and 90 min after atomoxetine intake, concentra-
tions at 3 h were still high but already decreased. Yet, 
a significant difference between concentrations at 1 h or 
1.5 h and 3 h was not present. A narrow time interval of 

1 360–90 min is difficult to implement for children and ado-
lescents in daily life. The risk of non-compliance could be 
a consequence. An extension of the time window to per-
form blood collection would be easier to implement due 
to a greater flexibility in everyday clinical practice. There-
fore, a wider interval between 1–3 h could be considered 
for children and adolescents. Since concentrations were 
significantly lower 4 h after atomoxetine intake, an exten-
sion to a time window of 1–4 h cannot be recommended.
The range of time intervals from 1 to 36 h was wide and 
correlated with the large variability of serum concentrations 
from 0 to 1334 ng/ml. More than 50% of the 27 serum con-
centrations were based on time intervals of more than 4 h. 
The wide range suggests that a time interval for blood col-
lection has not yet been sufficiently established in clinical 
routine.

The moderate to strong correlation between serum con-
centrations and weight-normalized dose—as opposed to 
the lower correlation between serum concentrations and 
absolute dose—supports the recommendation of a weight-
normalized dosing of atomoxetine for children and adoles-
cents (Lilly Deutschland Gmbh 2015). Hereby, not only 
comparability between children and adolescents is achieved, 
but also a constant exposure to atomoxetine during child-
hood is ensured (Sauer et al. 2005). The observation that 
children ≥ 12 years of age received a higher absolute but 
lower weight-normalized dose compared to children and 
adolescents < 12 years of age shows that the absolute dose 
is underestimated for older children. Due to an older age, 
there is a risk of prescribing a higher absolute but not yet 
sufficiently high weight-normalized dose.

As already mentioned, our analysis showed a significantly 
moderate to strong correlation between serum concentra-
tions and weight-normalized dose. Comparable correlations 
have not yet been described for atomoxetine; so far, only a 
proportionality between the weight-normalized dose and the 
AUC of atomoxetine for children and adolescents (Witcher 
et al. 2003) and for adult patients (Farid et al. 1985) has 
been described in literature. In various studies, correlations 
between dose and serum concentrations in children and ado-
lescents were examined for other psychotropic drugs (Schulz 
et al. 1995; Gerlach et al. 2007; Koelch et al. 2012; Taurines 
et al. 2013; Wohkittel et al. 2016). A comparably strong cor-
relation (rP = 0.807, p = 0.0001) was observed for clozapine 
(Schulz et al. 1995).

However, a disadvantage of this analysis was the small 
number of serum concentrations due to the exclusion of 
measurements with incomplete information on the request 
forms  and  with  a  possible  CYP  polymorphism  or  pos-
sible  confounding  variables  such  as  a  comedication  or 
non-compliance.

In the time interval of maximum concentrations, for 
example, significantly lower serum concentrations outside 

955

the 95% confidence interval were excluded due to potential 
non-compliance. A comedication or nicotine abuse could 
be  excluded  for  these  concentrations.  Also,  an  altered 
CYP-metabolism was unlikely; the absorption of atom-
oxetine does not differ between EM and PM, both show 
maximum serum concentrations about 2 h after the intake 
of atomoxetine (Sauer et al. 2003). Therefore, non-com-
pliance was most likely to be assumed.

After backcalculating concentrations to the time point 
of 90 min, three outliers with extreme high serum concen-
trations above 1.5 times the interquartile range on the box-
plot also had to be excluded. Even without backcalculating 
these three outliers, their concentrations were high accord-
ing to their advanced time intervals between 13 and 36 h 
(1334 ng/ml after 14 h, 318 ng/ml after 36 h and 177 ng/ml 
after 13 h). For these patients, an altered CYP-metabolism 
as that of PM could be suspected. PM can have up to ten 
times higher mean atomoxetine concentrations as well as 
four to five times increased half-lives compared to EM 
(Farid et al. 1985; Sauer et al. 2003, 2005; Brown et al. 
2016; Lilly Deutschland Gmbh 2015). In the case of PM, 
however, the backcalculation formula, which used a half-
life of 3.5 h assuming an EM, is not transferable and the 
three concentrations at 90 min are likely overestimated. 
Whether the formula can be applied to all other concentra-
tions with the pharmacokinetics of children and adoles-
cents cannot be answered with certainty.

Besides, measurements with a comedication or a nico-
tine  abuse  were  excluded.  Potential  CYP-interactions 
due to a comedication can have an influence on atomox-
etine serum concentrations (Paulzen et al. 2008; Hiemke 
et al. 2018). Risperidone, for example, is metabolized via 
CYP2D6, as is atomoxetine. By inhibiting the catalytic 
activity of CYP2D6, risperidone could lead to a potential 
increase in the concentration of atomoxetine (Shin et al. 
1999; Belle et al. 2002; Ring et al. 2002). A relevant inhib-
itory effect of antipsychotics such as risperidone, however, 
was neither observed in this nor in other studies (Ring 
et al. 1996; Shin et al. 1999). Nicotine may exert a small 
inductive effect on CYP1A2 and CYP2E1. In small but 
not relevant parts, atomoxetine could also be metabolized 
by these CYP enzymes (Zevin and Benowitz 1999; Ring 
et al. 2002; Miksys and Tyndale 2006; Mann et al. 2008). 
Because of their potential interactions—albeit small and 
clinically irrelevant—measurements with a comedication 
and a nicotine abuse were excluded to guarantee valid 
results.

Overall, our study showed a good efficacy of atomoxetine. 
In literature, numerous studies or meta-analyses confirmed 
an equally effective response to atomoxetine in children and 
adolescents with ADHD (Kratochvil et al. 2001; Spencer 
et al. 2001; Michelson et al. 2001; Buitelaar et al. 2004; 
Bakken et al. 2008; Gayleard and Mychailyszyn 2017). The

detailed analyses of these studies were often based on the 
“CGI Severity Scale CGI-S” or the ADHD Rating Scale 
(Spencer et al. 2001; Michelson et al. 2001, 2007). In this 
study, however, the analysis was only based on the catego-
ries of a low, moderate or strong efficacy according to the 
less detailed information on the request form.

Initially, efficacy seemed to be independent of the weight-
normalized dose, but dependent on serum concentrations. 
After backcalculating concentrations to the time point of 
90 min, this thesis had to be refuted. Neither a concentration 
effect relationship nor a dose effect relationship could be 
recorded. Concentrations with a moderate and strong effect 
were mainly within but also below the therapeutic range 
valid for adults (Hiemke et al. 2018). Analyses in litera-
ture support this. Low weight-normalized doses of 0.5 mg/
(kg x day) were associated with a low efficacy (Michelson 
et al. 2001; Trzepacz et al. 2008). An increase of the weight-
normalized dose beyond the recommended maintenance 
dose  of  1.2  mg/(kg  x  day),  however,  showed  no  further 
improvement of efficacy (Michelson et al. 2001; Kratochvil 
et al. 2007; Hazell et al. 2009). Regarding the lack of a con-
centration effect relationship, Hazell et al. (2009) confirmed 
that clinical efficacy of atomoxetine could not be predicted 
by the level of serum concentrations. Also, Michelson et al. 
confirmed a nonlinear correlation between serum concen-
trations and efficacy (rP = 0.179) (Michelson et al. 2007). 
Regardless of serum concentrations, a sustained efficacy 
with a reduction of symptoms over the course of the day 
was claimed by Kelsey et al. (2004) and Michelson et al. 
(2002). Correspondingly, a correlation between serum con-
centrations and their efficacy could not be shown for other 
psychotropic drugs (Klampfl et al. 2010; Koelch et al. 2012; 
Taurines et al. 2013; Wohkittel et al. 2016).

Looking more closely at the concentration associated 
with a low efficacy, the original concentration with a weight-
normalized dose of 1.1 mg/kg was 126 ng/ml at the time 
point of 8 h after atomoxetine intake. After backcalculation 
to the time point of 90 min, the concentration was 440.3 ng/
ml and, therefore, within the therapeutic reference range 
valid for adults (Hiemke et al. 2018). Thus, the concentra-
tion corresponded to the regular pharmacokinetic profiles of 
atomoxetine. Due to the short half-life of atomoxetine, the 
concentration could be below the therapeutic reference range 
8 h after the intake (Witcher et al. 2003; Sauer et al. 2005). 
Michelson et al. confirmed that 25% of children and adoles-
cents did not achieve a sufficient efficacy despite a sufficient 
dose and the presence of an EM (Michelson et al. 2007).

Due to the overall good efficacy regardless of the level of 
serum concentrations, the definition of a therapeutic refer-
ence range for children and adolescents was difficult. Never-
theless, an attempt was made to calculate an age-appropriate 
therapeutic reference range on the basis of serum concentra-
tions with a strong efficacy in the time interval of maximum 

serum concentrations. Compared to the therapeutic reference 
range of 200 to 1000 ng/ml valid for adult patients (Hiemke 
et al. 2018), the calculated range of 100–400 ng/ml or even 
of 200–300 ng/ml for children and adolescents was narrower. 
To achieve a strong effect on symptom reduction in children 
and adolescents, an upper limit of 1000 ng/ml did not seem 
necessary. Using ROC analysis, Sugimoto et al. showed a 
low threshold of 64.6 ng/ml for a possible therapeutic ref-
erence range for pediatric patients. When exceeding this 
plasma concentration of 64.6 ng/ml, the treatment with ato-
moxetine was more likely to be effective (Sugimoto et al. 
2021). This analysis of Sugimoto et al., therefore, supports a 
lower threshold for children and adolescents than originally 
assumed for adult patients.

Not only good efficacy but also good tolerability of ato-
moxetine was demonstrated in this study and could be con-
firmed in literature (Spencer et al. 2002; Wernicke and Kra-
tochvil 2002; Biederman et al. 2002; Buitelaar et al. 2004). 
In contrast to the weight-normalized dose, serum concentra-
tions were in a comparable range regardless of the severity 
of side effects. Despite a significantly lower weight-normal-
ized dose, patients with severe side effects had serum con-
centrations comparable to those of patients with minor and 
moderate side effects. However, time intervals were again 
initially not considered and could, therefore, lead to bias.

After backcalculating concentrations to the time point of 
90 min, still no correlation seemed to exist between serum 
concentrations and side effects. However, two extreme high 
serum concentrations above the therapeutic reference range 
(Hiemke et al. 2018), one of them with minor and the other 
one with major side effects, led to misleading high mean 
values. As the two concentrations correlated with both minor 
and major side effects, high concentrations were not neces-
sarily associated with severe side effects. Furthermore, the 
other two concentrations with severe side effects and a low 
weight-normalized dose were even below the therapeutic 
reference range for adults (Hiemke et al. 2018). Michel-
son et al. (2007) and Trzepacz et al. (2008) also described 
a tolerability that was independent of the level of serum 
concentrations.

The outlier with severe side effects, that was backcal-
culated to a concentration of 243,694.5 ng/ml at the time 
point of 90 min, was originally measured with 318 ng/ml at 
the time point of 36 h after atomoxetine intake. The weight-
normalized dose was 0.5 mg/kg. According to the half-life 
of atomoxetine, serum concentrations should no longer be 
detectable after 36 h (Witcher et al. 2003; Sauer et al. 2005). 
Therefore, as assumed earlier, this patient may be defined as 
a PM. PM can have potentially increased atomoxetine con-
centrations and extended half-lives compared to EM (Farid 
et al. 1985; Sauer et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2016). However, 
genotyping was not performed in this naturalistic study to 
confirm this assumption. With the assumption of a PM, the 

1 3formula for backcalculation to the time point of 90 min can-
not be applied retrospectively for this patient. The half-life 
of EM was used in the formula.

Altogether, side effects often seem to occur independently 
of the level of serum concentrations. However, as described 
for the concentration of 318 ng/ml after 36 h, they can be 
associated with elevated serum concentrations in individual 
cases. Therefore, it is important to detect side effects in time 
and, despite a generally good tolerability, to always carry out 
a TDM in children and adolescents as it is requested in the 
consensus guidelines (Hiemke et al. 2018).

Serum  concentrations  with  minor  or  no  side  effects, 
which represented 80% of all serum concentrations, were 
both above, within and below the therapeutic reference range 
valid for adult patients (Hiemke et al. 2018). Due to a non-
linear correlation between serum concentrations and side 
effects, the suggested therapeutic reference range from 100 
to 400 ng/ml for children and adolescents could not be fur-
ther optimized. Serum concentrations above the upper limit 
of 400 ng/ml did not necessarily appear to be associated 
with severe side effects and were well tolerated. Thus, higher 
serum concentrations could be individually accepted. Not 
only for atomoxetine but also for other psychotropic drugs 
with a wide therapeutic window, it is difficult to determine 
an upper limit (Gründer et al. 2014).

Study limitations

Naturalistic studies such as this one have some typical limi-
tations (Taurines et al. 2013). Uncontrolled conditions of the 
clinical setting and potential confounding factors describe 
two of the limitations. Data were only evaluated retrospec-
tively. Non-compliance and a non-standardized time interval 
between the intake of atomoxetine and blood collection were 
only two confounding factors that could cause intraindivid-
ual fluctuations in serum concentrations. Serum concentra-
tions with a comedication or a nicotine abuse to name further 
confounding factors were excluded to assess more valid data. 
Precise questionnaires like the CGI Severity Scale CGI-S or 
the ADHD Rating Scale for a more valid assessment of the 
efficacy and side effects were not available.

Furthermore, due to an incomplete clinical documenta-
tion, serum concentrations with missing data for pharma-
cokinetic analysis had to be excluded and, therefore, sample 
sizes were very small.

In  addition,  a  quantification  of  the  main  metabolites 
4-hydroxyatomoxetine and N-desmethylatomoxetine could 
not be performed due to the lack of the pure substance and 
an internal standard. This would have been helpful to deter-
mine the genotype in case of deviating serum concentrations.

Conclusion

A  significant  correlation  between  weight-normalized 
dose and serum concentrations of atomoxetine, however, 
with a small sample size, was first described in this study. 
The therapeutic reference range proved to be narrower 
than the therapeutic reference range for adult patients. 
However,  due  to  good  efficacy  and  tolerability  which 
were both not related to serum concentrations, an exact 
therapeutic reference range remained difficult to estab-
lish  for  children  and  adolescents.  Individually,  higher 
serum concentrations with a good tolerability seemed to 
be acceptable. The time window of maximum concen-
trations during which blood samples should be collected 
seemed to be similar to the previously defined interval 
for adult patients. Due to a greater flexibility and better 
compliance, an extension to a time window of 1–3 h could 
be discussed. In this time window, no significant decrease 
of serum concentrations could be demonstrated. To verify 
and strengthen these preliminary results of this study, fur-
ther data need to be collected in controlled studies with a 
larger sample size.
