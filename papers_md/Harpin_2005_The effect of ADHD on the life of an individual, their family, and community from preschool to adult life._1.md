Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may affect
all aspects of a child’s life. Indeed, it impacts not only on
the child, but also on parents and siblings, causing
disturbances to family and marital functioning. The adverse
effects of ADHD upon children and their families changes
from the preschool years to primary school and
adolescence, with varying aspects of the disorder being
more prominent at different stages. ADHD may persist into
adulthood causing disruptions to both professional and
personal life. In addition, ADHD has been associated with
increased healthcare costs for patients and their family
members.

disorder
deficit/hyperactivity
(ADHD) is a chronic, debilitating disorder
which may impact upon many aspects of
an individual’s life, including academic difficul-
ties,1 social skills problems,2 and strained parent-
child relationships.3 Whereas it was previously
thought that children eventually outgrow ADHD,
recent studies suggest that 30–60% of affected
individuals continue to show significant symp-
toms of the disorder into adulthood.4 Children
with the disorder are at greater risk for longer
term negative outcomes, such as lower educa-
tional and employment attainment.5 A vital
consideration in the effective treatment of
ADHD is how the disorder affects the daily lives
of children, young people, and their families.
Indeed, it is not sufficient to merely consider
ADHD symptoms during school hours—a thor-
ough examination of the disorder should take
into account the functioning and wellbeing of
the entire family.

life, depending upon the
demands made on the individual by their
environment. This varies with family and school
resources, as well as with age, cognitive ability,
and insight of the child or young person. An
environment that is sensitive to the needs of an
individual with ADHD and aware of the implica-
tions of the disorder is vital. Optimal medical and
behavioural management is aimed at supporting
the individual with ADHD and allowing them to
achieve their full potential while minimising
adverse effects on themselves and society as a
whole.

In addition,
comorbidities and healthcare costs are examined.

THE PRESCHOOL CHILD
Poor concentration, high levels of activity, and
impulsiveness are frequent characteristics of
normal preschool children. Consequently, a high
level of supervision is the norm. Even so,
children with ADHD may still stand out. In this
age group there is often unusually poor intensity
of play and excessive motor
restlessness.8 9
Associated difficulties, such as delayed develop-
ment, oppositional behaviour, and poor social
skills, may also be present.
If ADHD is a
possibility, it is vital to offer targeted parenting
advice and support. Even at this early stage
parental stress may be huge when a child does
not respond to ordinary parental requests and
behavioural advice.9 Targeted work with pre-
school children and their carers has been shown
to be effective in improving parent child inter-
action and reducing parental stress.10 11 A useful
review of the available evidence and methods is
provided by Barkley.12

PRIMARY SCHOOL YEARS
The primary school child with ADHD frequently
begins to be seen as being different as classmates
start to develop the skills and maturity that
enable them to learn successfully in school.
Although a sensitive teacher may be able to
adapt the classroom to allow an able child with
ADHD to succeed, more frequently the child
experiences academic failure, rejection by peers,
and low self esteem (fig 2). Comorbid problems,
such as specific learning difficulties, may also
start to impact on the child, further complicating
diagnosis and management. Assessment by an
educational psychologist may help to unravel
learning strengths and difficulties, and advise on
necessary support in the classroom.

Frequently, difficulties at home or on outings
with carers (for example, when shopping, out in
the park, or visiting other family members) also
become more apparent at this age. Parents may
find that family members refuse to care for the
child, and that other children do not invite them
to parties or out to play. Many children with
ADHD have very poor
sleep patterns, and
although they appear not to need much sleep,
daytime behaviour is often worse when sleep is
badly affected. As a result, parents have little
time to themselves; whenever the child is awake
they have to be watching them. Not surprisingly,

family relationships may be severely strained, and in some
cases break down, bringing additional social and financial
difficulties.14 This may cause children to feel sad or even show
oppositional or aggressive behaviour.

Assessing the quality of life of the child suffering from
ADHD is difficult. Behavioural assessments are usually
carried out by parents, teachers, or healthcare professionals,
and it can usually only be inferred how the child must feel.
However, data from self evaluations indicate that children
with ADHD view their most problematic behaviour as less
than children
within their control and more prevalent
without ADHD.15 Participation in a school based, nurse led
support group was associated with an increase in self worth
in pre-adolescents with ADHD.16

Johnston and Mash reviewed the evidence of the effect of
having a child with ADHD on family functioning.14 They
concluded that the presence of a child with ADHD results in
increased likelihood of disturbances to family and marital
functioning, disrupted parent-child relationships, reduced
parenting efficacy, and increased levels of parent stress,
particularly when ADHD is comorbid with conduct problems.
In a survey of the mothers and fathers of 66 children,
parents of children with ADHD combined and inattentive
subtypes expressed more role dissatisfaction than parents of
control children.17 Furthermore, ADHD in children was
reported to predict depression in mothers.18 Pelham et al
reported that the deviant child behaviours that represent
major chronic interpersonal stressors for parents of ADHD
children are associated with increased parental alcohol
consumption.19

Limited attention has been given to sibling relationships in
families with ADHD children. While it has been reported that
siblings of children with ADHD are at increased risk for
conduct and emotional disorders,20 a more recent study

presenting sibling accounts of ADHD identified disruption
caused by symptoms and behavioural manifestations of
ADHD as the most significant problem.21 This disruption
was experienced by siblings in three primary ways: victimisa-
tion, caretaking, and sorrow and loss. Siblings reported
feeling victimised by aggressive acts from their ADHD
brothers through overt acts of physical violence, verbal
aggression, and manipulation and control.
In addition,
siblings reported that parents expected them to care for and
protect their ADHD brothers because of the social and
emotional immaturity associated with ADHD. Furthermore,
as a result of
the ADHD symptoms and consequent
disruption, many siblings described feeling anxious, worried,
and sad.21

Broader social and family functioning has been assessed
using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a parent rated
health outcome scale that measures physical and psycho-
social wellbeing.22–24 The studies demonstrated that treatment
of ADHD with atomoxetine, a new non-stimulant medication
for ADHD, resulted in improved perception of quality of life,
with improvements being apparent in social and family
functioning, and self esteem. Further research assessing the
ongoing quality of life for the child and their family following
multimodal input is urgently needed.

ADHD IN YOUNG PEOPLE
Adolescence may bring about a reduction in the overactivity
that is often so striking in younger children, but inattention,
impulsiveness, and inner restlessness remain major difficul-
ties. A distorted sense of self and a disruption of the normal
development of self has been reported by adolescents with
ADHD.25 Furthermore, excessively aggressive and antisocial
behaviour may develop, adding further problems (fig 3). A
study by Edwards et al27 examined teenagers with ADHD and

oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), which is defined by the
presence of markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative beha-
viour and by the absence of more severe dissocial or aggressive
acts that violate the law or the rights of others. These
teenagers rated themselves as having more parent-teen
conflict than did community controls. Increased parent-teen
conflict was also reported when parents of teenagers with
ADHD carried out the rating exercise. In addition, a survey of
11–15 year olds showed that those with hyperkinesis were
twice as likely as the overall population to have ‘‘a severe lack
of friendship’’.28

Young people with ADHD are at increased risk of academic
failure, dropping out of school or college, teenage pregnancy,
and criminal behaviour (fig 4A and B). Driving poses an
additional risk. Individuals with ADHD are easily distracted
from concentrating on driving when going slowly, but while
driving fast may also be dangerous. It has been shown that,
compared with age matched controls, drivers with ADHD are
at increased risk of traffic violations, especially speeding, and
are considered to be at fault in more traffic accidents,
including fatal ones (fig 5).30 The risk of such events was
increased further by the presence of concomitant ODD.29
However, it has been suggested that treatment may have a
positive effect on driving skills.31

ADULT LIFE
As many as 60% of individuals with ADHD symptoms in
childhood continue to have difficulties in adult life.32 33

Adults with ADHD are more likely to be dismissed from
employment and have often tried a number of jobs before
being able to find one at which they can succeed.5 They may
need to choose specific types of work and are frequently self
employed. In the workplace, adults with ADHD experience
more interpersonal difficulties with employers and collea-
gues. Further problems are caused by lateness, absenteeism,
excessive errors, and an inability to accomplish expected
workloads. At home, relationship difficulties and break-ups
are more common. The risk of drug and substance abuse is
significantly increased in adults with persisting ADHD
symptoms who have not been receiving medication.34 The
genetic aspects of ADHD mean that adults with ADHD are
more likely to have children with ADHD. This in turn causes
further problems, especially as the success of parenting
programmes for parents of children with ADHD is highly
influenced by the presence of parental ADHD.35 Thus, ADHD
in parents and children can lead to a cycle of difficulties.

COMORBIDITIES
Comorbid disorders may impact on individuals with ADHD
throughout their lives. It is estimated that at least 65% of
children with ADHD have one or more comorbid conditions.36
The reported incidence of some of
frequent
comorbidities is shown in figure 6, with neurodevelopmental
problems, such as dyslexia and developmental coordination
disorder, being particularly common. Many children with
ADHD also suffer from tic disorders (not related to stimulant

medication). In addition, around 60% of children with
Tourette’s Syndrome fulfil criteria for ADHD,38 39 and autistic
spectrum disorder is increasingly recognised with comorbid
ADHD.39 Initially, excessive hyperactivity may mask the
features of autistic spectrum disorder until the child receives
medication. Conduct disorder and ODD coexist with ADHD in
at least 30%, and in some reports up to 90%, of cases.36 These
most frequently occurring comorbidities can, however, be
considered more as complications of ADHD, with adversity in

PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT
Growth deficits in children receiving stimulant treatment for
ADHD have long been the subject of scientific discussion.
Conflicting results have been reported with some authors
indicating that stimulants do indeed affect growth in
children,41–43 but that this only occurs during active treatment
phase and does not compromise final height.44 Other studies,
however, have not found any evidence to suggest that
stimulants influence growth.45 46 Taken together, the results
suggest
the growth of
hyperactive children receiving stimulants, and consider dose
reduction in individual cases should evidence of growth
suppression occur.

that clinicians should monitor

Another frequently quoted concern about treatment of
ADHD with stimulant medications is that it could lead to
drug addiction in later life. Young people with ADHD are by
nature impulsive risk takers, and there is clear evidence that
untreated ADHD—especially with concomitant conduct dis-
order—is associated with a three- to fourfold increase in the
risk of substance misuse.47 48 In contrast, patients medicated
with stimulants have a similar risk of substance misuse to
controls.49 These data therefore provide strong evidence in
favour of careful treatment and support for young people
with ADHD.

HEALTHCARE COSTS
Healthcare costs for individuals with ADHD in the UK have
not been fully estimated, but evidence from the USA suggests
that they are increased compared with age matched controls.
A population based, historical cohort study followed 4880
individuals from 1987 to 1995 and compared the nine year
median medical cost per person: ADHD medical costs were
US$4306, whereas non-ADHD medical costs were US$1944

(p,0.01).50 These findings are likely to reflect increased
injury following accidents and a rise in use of substance
abuse services and other outpatient facilities, although poor
ability to comply with advice on medication (for example,
asthma management) may also be implicated. A study of the
injuries to children with ADHD established that children with
ADHD were more likely to be injured as pedestrians or
bicyclists than children not suffering from ADHD. They were
more likely to sustain injuries to multiple body regions, head
injuries, and to be severely injured.51 ADHD has been found
to represent a risk factor for substance abuse,47 52 and an
investigation of prevalence of ADHD among substance
abusers has established that ADHD was significantly over-
represented among inpatients with psychoactive substance
use disorder.53 Increased use of health services is also seen in
the relatives of individuals with ADHD. A study has shown
that direct and indirect medical costs were twice as high as
those of family members of a control group.54 The difference
in these costs was primarily due to a higher incidence of
mental health problems in the family members of ADHD
patients, which reflects the increased stresses and demands
of living with an adult or child with ADHD. Indeed, ADHD
related family stress has been linked to increased risk of
parental depression and alcohol related disorders.55–57

It is vital to consider the role of treatment of ADHD in
decreasing the individual’s risk of adverse outcomes. A
number of studies on the effect of treatment of ADHD on
the risk of substance abuse encouragingly demonstrate a fall
in risk to that of the normal population.58–60

CONCLUSION
Mannuzza’s review of the long term prognosis in ADHD
concludes that childhood ADHD does not preclude high
educational and vocational achievements (for example,
Master’s degree or medical qualification).61 However, ADHD
is a disorder that may affect all aspects of a child’s life.
Careful assessment is paramount, and if this demonstrates
significant impairment as a result of ADHD, there is clear
evidence that treatment of ADHD should be instituted.62 63
Current treatment focuses mainly on the short term relief of
core symptoms, mainly during the school day. This means
that important times of the day, such as early mornings
before school and evening to bedtime, are frequently
unaffected by current treatment regimes. This can negatively

impact on child and family functioning and fail to optimise
self esteem and long term mental health development.

In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics recom-
mended that clinicians should work with children and their
families to monitor the success (or failure) of treatment,
using certain criteria to assess specific areas of difficulty and
quality of life as a whole.64 There has been a reluctance in the
UK to treat ADHD with medication, fuelled by concerns
about possible over-prescription in the USA. In addition,
newspaper and media coverage of ADHD is often negative
and stigmatising. The evidence of potentially severe difficul-
ties for the child, the family, and, in some cases, for society as
a whole, means that coordinated multi-agency effort to
support the child and family is essential. Moreover, health-
care professionals have an important role in providing
balanced and supportive information about ADHD and
meeting the needs of affected individuals and their families.
