ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:  Among  women  who  have  suffered  loss  of  pregnancy,  the  level  of  grief  decreases 
gradually. Age, mental health status and childlessness are the factors known to mostly affect women’s 
levels of grief.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the levels of grief among women who experienced perinatal loss and the changes 
in their ruminative thought styles over the first year after their loss. 
DESIGN AND SETTING: One-year follow-up study carried out in a university hospital in Turkey. 
METHODS: The study population included 70 women who experienced loss of pregnancy in the hospital. 
The sample size was calculated using G*Power V3.1. Data were collected at 48 hours, at the third month, 
at the sixth month and at one year after pregnancy loss, between June 2018 and June 2019. A personal 
information form, the Perinatal Grief Scale and the Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire were used for 
data collection. 
RESULTS: The  women’s  highest  levels  of  grief  and  ruminative  thought  style  were  in  the  first  48  hours. 
Their tendency towards grief and ruminative thought styles decreased over the repeated measurements 
during  the  follow-up. Women  aged  20-29  years  had  the  highest  levels  of  grief  at  the  third  month  after 
perinatal loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Nursing assessments regarding grief and ruminative thought style over the first 48 hours 
after perinatal loss should be integrated into nursing care for these women. Grief follow-up programs for 
these women can be developed through nursing research.

INTRODUCTION

Perinatal loss is the loss of a baby prematurely or at a short time after birth. The most common 
forms of perinatal losses are miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death.1 Despite all the improve-
ments in medicine, perinatal losses still occur frequently and affect millions of families.1,2 It has 
been estimated that approximately 15%-20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage or spontane-
ous abortion within the first 12 weeks, worldwide.3 The miscarriage and stillbirth rate in Turkey 
was  18.6%  in  2018.4  The  perinatal  death  rate  was  reported  to  be  6  in  1000  live  births  in  the 
United States in 2016; it was 11 in 1000 live births in Turkey in 2018.5,6

Perinatal loss is one of the most painful and unbearable life experiences for parents, and 
it causes emotional responses such as grief and depression. Fear, disappointment, anger, 
self-pity, feelings of failure, etc., are experienced during the period of grief.2 Sex, age, per-
ception of loss, life changes, coping styles, support systems and rumination can affect the 
duration of grief.2,7 

Ruminative thought has effects on individuals’ negative responses.8 Rumination consists 
of repetitively thinking through a negative emotion or situation.9 Individuals with rumina-
tive thoughts isolate themselves, continually focusing on their problems, and feel the results 

of negative situations for longer times. They think that, through such behavior, they are try-
ing to find a solution.10 Studies have shown that rumination is associated with various psy-
chological problems such as depressive symptoms,11-14 anxiety, worry and symptoms of pro-
longed grief.7,13,15 In the literature, it has been noted that women have ruminative tendencies 
more than men do.10,11,13,14,16

Determining the gradual changes in women’s grief levels and their ruminative thought 

styles may be the starting point and first step in planning nursing care for individuals who 

have experienced perinatal loss. In this regard, there is one pre-

Grief,  Difficulty  Coping  and  Despair.  These  levels  represent 

vious study assessing the level of grief among women with preg-
nancy loss in Turkey.17 To the best of our best knowledge, no 
studies have evaluated the gradual changes in grief levels and 

ruminative thought styles among women who suffered perina-

tal loss in Turkey. 

OBJECTIVE

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in grief levels 

and ruminative thought styles among women who have experi-

progression  of  the  pathological  condition  on  the  overall  scale. 

An Overall Grief score of 91 or higher means that grief is pres-

ent.  An  Active  Grief  score  of  34,  a  Difficulty  Coping  score  of 

30  and  a  Despair  score  of  27  are  used  as  cutoff  points  on  the 
three  subscales.  The  Cronbach’s  α  values  lie  between  0.86  and 
0.92. A validity and reliability study was conducted in Turkey by 

Özgür Köneş et al. in 2017, and its Cronbach’s alpha was found 
to  be  0.95.22  In  the  present  study,  the  Cronbach’s  alpha  values 
were between 0.793 and 0.857 for the subscales of the PGS and 

enced  perinatal  loss,  by  means  of  repeated  measurements  over

the first year after the event.

METHODS

This  was  a  one-year  follow-up  study  carried  out  in  a  univer-

sity  hospital.  The  study  population  consisted  of  women  who 

had experienced pregnancy loss in the hospital. The number of 

women  who  used  the  hospital’s  delivery  service  between  April 

1 and May 1, 2018, was 49. The sample size was calculated using 

the  G*Power  software  (version  3.1.9.2;  Universität  Düsseldorf, 
Düsseldorf,  Germany),  in  terms  of  the  change  in  R2  in  multi-
ple linear regression approximation. The minimum sample size 

required for seven predictors with 80% power and medium effect 
size (f2 = 0.15) was calculated as 43 subjects.18,19 However, through 
considering abandonment over the course of the repeated mea-

surements of the study, we decided to include a total of 70 women 

Ruminative thought style questionnaire

The RTSQ was developed by Brinker and Dozois in 2009, and its 

adaptation  to Turkish culture was published by  Karatepe  et  al., 
in 2013.14,23 This scale has 20 items. Assessments are made based 
on the total score. The lowest score is 20 and the highest score is 
140. Its Cronbach’s alpha in the above studies was 0.907.14,23 In the 
present study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.886.

Data collection 

Data were collected in four steps from June 2018 to June 2019. 

In the first step, the questionnaires were completed for the first 

time just before the participants were discharged. These women 
had stayed in the hospital for 48 hours (T0) after their pregnancy 
loss. The women’s phone numbers and addresses were obtained 

in the study.

At T0, 70 participants were involved in the study, but 13 par-

to reach all of the T1 participants again, at both T2 and T3, and 
thus the study was completed with 57 participants. The research-

RESULTS 

The mean age of the participants was 30.34 ± 6.55 years, and the 
mean week in which pregnancy loss occurred was 15.42 ± 6.61. 
Among all the participants, 45.7% had miscarriages and 54.3% 

had  stillbirths.  The  perinatal  deaths  all  occurred  at  between 

4 and 32 weeks of gestation. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic 

and obstetric characteristics of the participants. 

The median values of the total scores on the PGS (P < 0.001) 

and the mean scores on the RTSQ (P < 0.001) differed over time

women who had PGS total scores ≥ 91 were 55.7% at T0, 21.1% at 
T1, 3.5% at T2 and 3.5% at T3. A score higher than this cutoff point 
means having grief. The changes in the RTSQ scores based on the 

PGS cutoff points over time are shown in Figure 3. 

The multiple linear regression-backward elimination tech-

nique was used for RTSQ score estimation. The regression model 
included family type, childlessness, working status and PGS T3. PGS

The grief levels of women who had experienced pregnancy 
loss have been reported in the literature.17,21,24-27 Özgür and Yıldız 
determined in their study conducted among women over the 

first three months after pregnancy loss that the average total 
PGS score did not change within three months.17 However, the 
majority of the studies showed that women experienced vari-

ous level of grief right after a perinatal loss, and that their grief 

have control over them. In Turkish culture, pregnancy or having 

a baby is blessed. When it comes to losing a most precious thing 

that people can ever have, society shares all the sad feelings of 

women and supports them. Accepting their own faith and the 

support receiving from society may help women to accept their 

loss and provide positive feelings.

The age variable had a significant effect on the median PGS total 
score at T1 after the loss. Women aged 20-29 years had higher PGS

is a major risk factor for perinatal grief.27 The results from our 
study were similar to those of all these studies. In Turkish soci-

ety, individuals believe that women who lost their pregnancy 

may heal through have another living child. Being childless 

may cause a higher level of grief than that of women who have 

living children.

We found that the mean RTSQ score of the women was high-
est at T0. The mean scores on the RTSQ showed decreases over 
the course of the one year of measurements. Thus, the rumi-

Rumination is considered a cognitive process, in that it has an 

important role in various psychiatric disorders such as anxiety 
and mood state disorders.23 Studies have reported that among 
women the risk of experiencing depression increases when their 
ruminative tendencies increase.11,14,32,33 There are no studies in the 
literature that have evaluated ruminative thought styles among 

women after perinatal loss. However, several studies have assessed 

the correlations between rumination levels and anxiety, depres-

sion and psychological parameters. Previous studies have shown

found to have positive correlations with depression, anxiety and 

negative automatic thoughts, and a negative correlation regard-
ing satisfaction with life.8,11,13-16,33-35 Additionally, some studies 

have found that grief may occur in various pathological forms, 

and that chronic grief may cause depression, anxiety, phobias, 
obsessions and psychotic reactions.36 Therefore, determining 

the level of rumination after pregnancy loss is quite important 

in terms of psychopathological conditions such as depression 

during the early days after the loss.

The results from this study showed that as rumination increases 

among women in the early period after their loss, grief also 

increases. This result was supported by the regression analysis in

the women had recovered by the sixth month after the perinatal 

loss. However, women who are not recovering from grief present 

more rumination over time than do women who improve. There 

are no studies evaluating the relationship between perinatal grief 

and ruminative thought styles in the literature. However, a positive 

correlation has been reported in the literature between perinatal 
grief and depression.24,29,37 

It has been observed that the majority of the women who 
experienced perinatal loss showed depressive symptoms.24,29 

Also, similar studies have shown that the risk of incidence of 
depression after perinatal loss is high.25,37 Determining the rela-

tionship between perinatal grief and ruminative thought styles 

might be a starting point for planning qualitative nursing care 

aimed at protecting and improving women’s mental health after 

perinatal loss.

Limitations

The sample size was limited because of the number of dropouts.
