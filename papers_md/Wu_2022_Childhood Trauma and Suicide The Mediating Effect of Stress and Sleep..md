Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between suicide risk, perceived stress,
and sleep quality through a structural equation modeling approach. This study used convenience
sampling to survey 780 undergraduate and graduate students aged 18–30 years. Students were
invited to participate in the online questionnaires, which included the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation,
the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The results showed that suicide
ideation and suicidal behavior were positively correlated with childhood trauma, stress, and sleep.
A well-ﬁtted structural equation model (χ2 = 1.52, df = 1, χ2/df = 1.52, RMSEA = 0.03, CFI = 1.00,
NFI = 1.00) was constructed in this study. The hierarchical regression test showed signiﬁcance in
all the path coefﬁcients of the model. The total effect of emotional abuse on suicide behaviors was
49.5%. The mediating effects accounted for 73.7% of the total effects of emotional abuse on suicidal
behaviors. The results demonstrate efforts targeting stress and poor sleep might mitigate the risk of
suicidal behaviors among individuals with early emotional abuse experiences.

1. Introduction

Globally, suicide has become a public health issue. In 2019, suicide caused more than
1 in every 100 deaths (1.3%) worldwide. Suicidal ideation and behaviors have a signiﬁcant
impact on individual physical and mental health, induced by the probability of suicide [1,2].
Consequently, the World Health Organization has prioritized the global reduction in suicide
mortality. Thus, exploring the risk factors and causes of suicide is instrumental for suicide
prevention and intervention.

The complexity and unpredictability associated with suicide risk factors have hindered
suicide prevention and intervention efforts. Turecki and Brent (2016) proposed a model for
evaluating suicide risk that includes both population and individual-level risk factors. In-
dividual risk factors were grouped into distal (or predisposing) factors (e.g., family history,
genetics, and early-life adversity), developmental (or mediating) factors (e.g., cognitive
deﬁcit, development of personality traits, and epigenetic factors), and proximal (or precipi-
tating) factors (e.g., stress, sleep disturbance, and acute substance misuse). Most of these
risk factors are difﬁcult to address through psychological intervention [3].

Stress, which includes early life adversity, acute stress, and chronic stress, can increase
the incidence of suicidal behavior and death by suicide [4,5]. A previous meta-analysis
conﬁrmed the association between childhood trauma and a higher risk of comorbidity

with post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and attempting suicide [6]. An association between
life stressors and suicide risk has also been found [7]. Furthermore, sleep disturbance
was found to increase suicide risk by 1.95–2.95 times [8]. A systematic literature review
showed that 70% of the reviewed studies found that at least one type of sleep problem
signiﬁcantly predicted suicidal ideation and behavioral outcomes among youths [9]. Stress
is the physiological activity and activation of an individual’s response to the external
environment. Moreover, stress can inhibit sleep and increase arousal, leading to sleep
disturbances such as insomnia, nightmares, and daytime dysfunction [10]. These ﬁndings
indicate that sleep may partially mediate the relationship between stress and suicide. Our
team has reviewed the mechanisms linking the three variables from a neurophysiological
perspective [11]. For example, the FK506-binding protein encoded by the FKBP5 gene 51
(FKBP51) not only plays an important role in regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal
axis, which regulates stress response, but also has a signiﬁcant impact on sleep [12,13].
In addition, the FKBP5 gene polymorphism (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780 variants)
may increase suicide risks with the experience of childhood trauma [14,15]. However, no
previous studies to our knowledge have examined the path from childhood trauma to
suicide risk via perceived stress and sleep disturbances directly.

The development of suicide risk is a complex process. Knowing the factors associated
with suicide alone is not sufﬁcient to understand the dynamics of suicide risk. Therefore,
this study aimed to enrich existing knowledge about the impact of childhood trauma on
suicide risk by exploring the path of suicide risk formation. Stress and sleep disturbance
were both impacted by the intervention [16]. Exploring mediators from childhood trauma
to suicide risk can help us to use a variety of interventions to systematically intervene from
different perspectives for cases with traumatic experiences to achieve better outcomes. In
summary, we aimed to explore how childhood trauma affects suicide risk through stress and
sleep to better understand the mechanisms underlying suicide. To accomplish this, we used
structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore relationships between childhood trauma
and suicide ideation/suicidal behaviors mediated by perceived stress and sleep quality.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants and Recruitment

This study was approved by the Committee on Ethics of Biomedicine Research, Second
Military Medical University (20170305). The study was conducted in April and May 2018,
during which 806 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students aged 18–30 were invited
through online advertisements to participate in the online questionnaires. These students
were recruited from three schools of different levels, including a key university, a general
university, and a vocational college, to make our sample cover students from different
schools. Of the participants, 24 did not complete all the items, and 2 participants did not
meet the age requirements (i.e., they were not over 18 years old). The participants provided
informed consent online before completing the questionnaire. They were also informed
that participation is voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw from the study at
any time. Moreover, psychological services were offered to ensure that participants felt safe
and received appropriate support when required.

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Childhood Trauma

The Short Form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF) [17] is made up of
28 items (25 clinical items and 3 validity items) that retrospectively screen for a history of
childhood abuse and neglect. The CTQ-SF is rated on a scale ranging from 1 (“never”) to
5 (“always”). All items are combined into ﬁve component scores: emotional abuse (EA),
physical abuse (PA), sexual abuse (SA), emotional neglect (EN), and physical neglect (PN).
Total scores range from 25 to 125 [18]. The cutoff scores for each of the subscales scored
into moderate or severe trauma were as follows: EA ≥ 13, PA ≥ 10, SA ≥ 8, EN ≥ 15,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8493

3 of 11

PN ≥ 10 [19,20]. The Chinese version of the CTQ-SF used in this study has good reliability
and validity among Chinese college students. The Cronbach’s alpha in this study was 0.77.

2.2.2. Stress

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measures perceived stress in daily life [21], and it
includes 10 self-report items regarding feelings and thoughts during the past month. The
PSS measures the frequency of feelings experienced by respondents that could be deemed
stressful. The PSS is rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (“never”) to 4 (“very
often”), and the total score ranges from 0 to 40. The Chinese version of the PSS has been
shown to have moderately high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.85) [22]. The Cronbach’s
alpha in this study was 0.70.

2.2.3. Sleep Quality

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire comprising 19 items that
evaluate subjective sleep quality during a one-month interval [23]. All items are combined
into seven component scores, with a total score ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate
worse sleep quality. The PSQI has been shown to have high internal consistency, reliability,
and construct validity [24]. Scores > 7 are generally used to indicate poor sleep for the
Chinese version [25], and we adopted this same threshold in our study. The Cronbach’s
alpha of the Chinese version of the PSQI is 0.84, and the intext has satisfactory psychometric
properties [25]. The Cronbach’s alpha in this study was 0.66.

2.2.4. Suicide Risk

The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) is a self-report questionnaire that is used to
assess current suicide ideation [26]. The questionnaire consists of 19 items, with rated items
ranging from 0 (“non-existent”) to 2 (“obviously existent”). Higher total scores represent
more serious suicidal ideation. The SSI has good reliability and validity [27]. The Chinese
version of the SSI was used in this study [28]. We set the SSI total score ≥ 6 as the cutoff for
high levels of suicidal ideation, which has been shown to provide the best classiﬁcation
accuracy for predicting future suicidal behavior [29]. The Cronbach’s alpha in this study
was 0.86.

The Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) is a measure of the frequency
and severity of past suicidal behaviors [30]. The SBQ-R includes four self-report items, each
of which investigates a different dimension of suicidality. Higher total scores represent
more severe suicidal behaviors. A cutoff score of SBQ-R ≥ 7 was used for identifying
individuals at risk of suicidal behaviors and attempts [30]. The Chinese version of the
SBQ-R was used in this study and had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79 [31]. The Cronbach’s
alpha in this study was 0.81.

Demographic characteristics such as sex, age, education level, major, and school were

also collected.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics (Mean [SD] and N [%]) were used to examine the characteristics of
the sample. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to examine the interrelations between
all key variables in the study using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23.0). p values < 0.05 were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

The SEM was used to explain the relationships and construct a structural equation
model among stress, sleep, and suicide. The SEM was conducted using Amos (version
24.0) to test the path analysis, and it was constructed using the following steps: construct-
ing theoretical models, testing for common method bias, performing conﬁrmatory factor
analysis, and testing for mediation effects on the model. The proposed mediating relation-
ship was estimated by employing the maximum likelihood approach. Three criteria were
used to evaluate the modeling ﬁtness: (1) For the χ2/df, 1 < χ2/df < 3 suggests that the
theoretical model is well ﬁtted to the sample data (if the sample size is large, χ2/df = 5 is

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8493

4 of 11

acceptable) [32]. (2) For the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) and the normed ﬁt index (NFI),
both values above 0.90 indicated a good model ﬁt [33]. (3) For the root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA), RMSEA < 0.05 is equal to a “close ﬁt” (0.05 ≤ RMSEA < 0.08 is
equal to an “acceptable ﬁt”) [34]. The 95% bias-corrected bootstrap conﬁdence interval (CI)
and 95% percentile CI based on 3000 bootstrap samples were used for testing the mediating
effects. All the indices and mediating effects were determined when zero was not included
in the respective CI [35].

3. Results
3.1. Sample Characteristics

A total of 806 Chinese students were approached for the survey, and 780 responses
were included in the analysis, corresponding to an effective response rate of 96.8%. The
average age of the 780 participants was 20.58 years (SD = 2.57). Sample characteristics are
summarized in Table 1.

3.3. Mediation Analysis

According to the results of the regression analysis, a theoretical model for the associa-
tion between childhood trauma, perceived stress, sleep, and suicidal ideation and behavior
was developed, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The theoretical model of mediation factors for suicidal ideation and behaviors (all assumed
paths are positive predictive associations).

3.3.1. Common Method Bias

A Harman’s Test showed that there was no common method bias (χ2 = 871.37, df =27,

χ2/df = 32.27, RMSEA = 0.20, CFI = 0.65, NFI = 0.64).

3.3.2. SEM

The fit indices in the theoretical equation model were not satisfactory (χ2= 1267.20, df = 18,
χ2/df = 70.40, RMSEA = 0.30, CFI = 0.48, NFI = 0.48). Despite removing unreasonable paths
in the model (e.g., that SA negatively predicts suicidal ideation) and modifying the model
according to the modiﬁcation indices, we attained a ﬁnal equation model (Figure 2) with
satisfactory ﬁt indices (χ2 = 1.52, df = 1, χ2/df = 1.52, RMSEA = 0.03, CFI = 1.00, NFI = 1.00),
which was acceptable (Figure 2).

The results of the hierarchical regression showed that all standardized path coefﬁcients
in this model were statistically signiﬁcant: EA ® perceived stress (β = 0.42, p < 0.001), EA ®
sleep quality (β = 0.16, p < 0.001), EA ® suicidal ideation (β = 0.78, p < 0.001), EA ®

(β = 0.04, p = 0.002), sleep quality ® suicidal ideation (β = 0.32, p < 0.001), sleep quality ®
suicide behaviors (β = 0.06, p = 0.014), and suicidal ideation ® suicide behaviors (β = 0.13,
p < 0.001).

3.3.3. Mediation Analysis

The mediating (indirect) effects between EA, perceived stress, sleep quality, suicidal
ideation, and suicidal behaviors were tested using PROCESS. This method generates
bootstrap CI for indirect effects of the predictors on the outcome variable through the
mediator variables.

The hypothetical model included the following:

Model 1: EA ® perceived stress ® sleep quality ® suicidal ideation ® suicide behaviors;
Model 2: EA ® perceived stress ® sleep quality ® suicide behaviors;
Model 3: EA ® perceived stress ® suicide behaviors;
Model 4: EA ® sleep quality ® suicidal ideation ® suicide behaviors;
Model 5: EA ® sleep quality ® suicide behaviors;
Model 6: EA ® suicidal ideation ® suicide behaviors.

Table 4 shows that all the model pathways were signiﬁcant. The total effect of EA on
suicide behaviors was 49.5%. The mediating effects accounted for 73.7% of the total effects
of EA on suicidal behaviors. Of all the mediating effects, effects through perceived stress
and sleep quality accounted for 17.8%.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to examine the relationship between childhood trauma as an essential
determinant of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Furthermore, this study investigated
the mediating role of perceived stress and sleep quality in the relationship. The results
showed that childhood trauma, perceived stress, and sleep quality were all positively
associated with suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. However, in all types of childhood
trauma, only EA could predict suicidal ideation and suicide behavior mediated by perceived
stress and sleep quality. In addition, the total effects of EA on suicide behaviors were 49.5%,
of which 17.8% was achieved through perceived stress and sleep quality.

The incidence of trauma in this study is similar to that of previous studies in China [20,36]
and showed a moderately low level in the multi-country meta-analysis data [37]. The
prevalence rates of all kinds of childhood trauma of the participants in this study were
lower than those reported in previous studies with patients with depression, bipolar
disorder, and schizophrenia [20,38]. Comparing data with a previous study conducted in
Chinese university students, our results showed a greater proportion of participants with
SSI or SBQ scores exceeding the cutoffs [39]. However, the proportion is far less than that
of ﬁreﬁghters and psychiatric inpatient population [29]. The prevalence rates of childhood
trauma in participants with SSI and/or SBQ scores exceeding the cutoffs were signiﬁcantly
higher than those of the overall participants

According to previous studies, childhood trauma experiences were strongly associated
with higher suicide risks [40,41], which is consistent with our ﬁndings. Numerous studies
have found an association between stress and sleep [7], between stress and suicide [8], and
between sleep and suicide [9]. This study examined the mediating role of perceived stress
and sleep quality between childhood trauma and suicide risk, which was an integration
of these associations. It veriﬁed that experiencing childhood EA can increase the risk of
suicide through perceived stress and poor sleep quality. At the same time, this study sheds
light on the complex process of how childhood trauma increases suicide risk. Although
this study only involved a small pathway, it is of interest for future research to uncover the
complex processes that lead to suicide.

Furthermore, this study found that only EA could predict suicide risks through
perceived stress and sleep quality. EA includes the restriction of movement; patterns
of belittling, blaming, threatening, frightening, discriminating against, or ridiculing; and
other non-physical forms of rejection or hostile treatment. It involves both isolated incidents
as well as a pattern of the caregivers’ failure to provide a developmentally appropriate
and supportive environment in a child’s growth [42]. The results indicate that different
types of childhood trauma may create different pathways for suicide risks. Numerous
studies veriﬁed that different types of childhood trauma may lead to varied outcomes. For
example, EA was associated with the highest incidence rates of revictimization and PTSD
symptom severity compared with other types of maltreatment [43]. EA, but not neglect, was
correlated with an increased risk of psychosis and injecting-drug use [44]. Schizophrenia
was related to higher EN and PN scores and a lower PA score [20]. It is worth noting
that several studies found that EA is more strongly related to depression than SA and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8493

PA [20,45–47]. A study tried to explain the results by indicating that emotion dysregulation
and interpersonal problems mediated the relationship between EA and depression [47].
Since emotional dysregulation, interpersonal problems, and depression are all risk factors
of suicide [3], they may also be the mediating factors between EA and suicide risk and may
explain why only EA could predict suicide risk in our model. However, further research is
needed to verify this hypothesis. In addition, more research is also needed to differentiate
between different categories of childhood trauma to reveal the complex process by which it
increases suicide risk. In addition, further research could examine the pathways of different
childhood traumatic experiences on suicide.

The results of this study provide recommendations for suicide prevention and in-
tervention, particularly among individuals with experiences of childhood EA. Several
psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical
behavior therapy (DBT), have been shown to not only have a positive effect on suicide
risk but also improve sleep or stress. This may be one of the reasons why these methods
work so well in preventing suicide. For example, a previous study found that CBT for
insomnia not only improved sleep but also reduced levels of suicidal ideation [48]. More-
over, DBT helped reduce self-harm and suicide attempts in highly suicidal self-harming
adolescents [49] while simultaneously lowering perceived stress [50]. However, few studies
have veriﬁed whether a certain intervention is effective for stress, sleep, and suicide risks at
the same time. A recent research study found that brief mindfulness meditation could help
reduce suicidal ideation, stress, and sleep disturbance for individuals with high suicidal
ideation [51]. Moreover, the study proposed that brief mindfulness meditation could reduce
suicidal ideation not only directly but also indirectly by mediating stress, sleep, or the path
of stress to sleep. However, the ﬁndings failed to verify this hypothesis. In addition to the
relatively limited sample size, the results may have been due to the limited experiences of
childhood EA among participants. In addition, the results of the current study suggest that
crisis intervention workers should pay attention to the perceived stress and sleep problems
of clients with childhood EA experiences. Psychotherapists may consider using the above-
mentioned psychotherapies or a combination of various psychotherapies simultaneously to
reduce stress, sleep, and suicide risk and achieve better outcomes. Further empirical studies
are needed to verify the impact of different psychotherapies on suicide risks and their risk
factors simultaneously. Furthermore, it is recommended that when exploring the effects
of suicide prevention and intervention, the impact of childhood traumatic experiences on
outcomes be examined.

The following limitations of this study should be considered while interpreting our
ﬁndings. First, the participants of this study were Chinese undergraduate and graduate
students aged 18–30, which makes the ﬁndings most applicable to young Chinese peo-
ple. Second, perceived stress and sleep quality data were collected through self-report
questionnaires that largely depend on subjective feelings, which may have affected the
objectivity and accuracy of the data. Third, the Cronbach’s alpha in this study was lower
than 0.7. After double-checking, no missing data or unreasonable answers were found. The
method of removing measures with more than three standard deviations of PSQI did not
improve Cronbach’s alpha. Owing to the results of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy
(KMO = 0.71, p < 0.001) and the experience of previous studies that acceptance reliability
less than 0.7 instead of modifying the questionnaire, we used the primary measure [52].
Fourth, since the participants were not recruited from patients with clinical mental disor-
ders, and the means of each variable were lower than the cut-offs, the results might be not
necessarily applicable to clinical patients. Finally, this study was based on cross-sectional
data. For future research, longitudinal and experimental research should be conducted to
determine any causal relationships between relevant variables.

5. Conclusions

In this study, by constructing a structural equation model, it is veriﬁed that only EA,
not PA, SA, EN, and PN, could predict suicide ideation and suicidal behavior mediated by

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8493

perceived stress and sleep quality. This study is an attempt to explore the complex process
of suicide formation, which hopefully could help to shed some light on how past traumas
inﬂuences suicidal risks both directly and indirectly. In addition, the results indicate that
different types of childhood trauma may create different pathways for suicide risks. It
would be reasonable to invite clinical and mental health professionals to take into account
how different types of traumatic experience clients had would inﬂuence their suicidal
risks differently when conducting suicide assessment and intervention for individuals with
childhood emotional abuse experiences. Furthermore, a proposal was made, based on the
ﬁnding of this study, to consider potentially including additional focus of intervention on
sleep and stress due to the mediation effects of stress and sleep.
