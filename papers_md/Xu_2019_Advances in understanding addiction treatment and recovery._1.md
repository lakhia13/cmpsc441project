Advances in understanding 
addiction treatment 
and recovery

T his Special Collection on Addiction focuses on sci-

entific advances in the treatment and recovery 
mechanisms of addiction related to four widely 
misused substances: alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, 
and opioids. Although the opioid crisis has tak-
en center stage across public policy and scien-
tific forums, all of these substances continue to 
have a profound global impact on health and well-being 
and on social and economic resources. This collection 
includes comprehensive review articles on these sub-
stances authored by leading researchers in the field of 
addiction, along with research studies that present re-
cent discoveries with clear translational impact on de-
veloping new treatment targets and effective intervention 
strategies.

Substance use disorder (SUD)—commonly referred 
to as addiction—is a medical illness with altered be-
havioral, cognitive, physical, neurobiological, and affective 
functions associated with compulsive and repeated use of 
addictive substance(s), whether legal or illegal. Regardless 
of the differences among the addictive substances, SUDs 
share common neurobehavioral characteristics, including 
the progression of the three addiction stages (intoxication → 
withdrawal → craving) and dysregulation of the neuro-
biological systems associated with reward, stress, emo-
tion, and executive functions (1). SUDs cause millions 
of years of life lost because of premature death and is 
also among the leading causes of life with disability world-
wide, including both developing and developed countries 
(2–4). Tobacco and alcohol, in particular, are among the 
four leading risk factors for deaths globally (5, 6). In the 
United States, it is estimated that each year, over 88,000 
people die from alcohol related causes, and more than 
480,000 deaths are linked to cigarette smoking (7, 8). 
Other drug-overdose deaths have increased by more 
than threefold in the United States since 1999, resulting 
in more than 70,000 deaths in 2017 (9). Based on the 
2018 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) (10), in the United 
States alone, there are more than 16 million heavy 
alcohol drinkers, 27 million daily smokers, and more 
than 50 million illicit drug users, including more than 
10 million people who misuse opioids. However, only 
about 10% of those who needed treatment for SUDs re-
ceived treatments in 2018 (10). Although there are ef-
fective medications—except for cocaine addiction—and 
other treatment options, the effectiveness of SUD treat-
ment remains inadequate, as extensively reviewed by 

the leading experts in this collection (Kampman, 2019; 
Kreek, Reed, and Butelman, 2019; Prochaska and Benowitz, 
2019; Witkiewitz, Litten, and Leggio, 2019). According 
to the 2016 United States Surgeon General’s Report (11), 
more than 60% of those who received addiction treat-
ments in the United States relapsed within a year, which 
highlights the challenges in sustaining recovery (i.e., 
maintaining long-term drug abstinence and well-being). 
Despite decades of scientific research and the high eco-
nomic cost (estimated at $740 billion a year in the United 
States alone), treatment outcomes and recovery from 
SUDs continue to be very limited.

Scientific studies on addiction have led to the develop-
ment of a number of medications for pharmacological 
interventions, along with other nonpharmacotherapies 
including behavioral, cognitive, and social interventions 
(see the comprehensive reviews in this collection). 
These intervention methods have been applied in treat-
ing SUDs such as alcohol, nicotine, and opioid use dis-
orders. Unfortunately, there are no targeted and effective 
medications for treating cocaine addiction at the present 
time, due to its complex effect on the central nervous 
system (CNS—the brain and spinal cord) and difficulty 
in identifying medication targets (see the review by 
Kampman in this collection). Even for SUDs with vali-
dated treatments, their effectiveness is complicated by 
many factors related to the nature of the illness, partic-
ularly for people with severe SUDs. For instance, regard-
less of etiology, SUDs affect not only the brain but also 
other systems and vital organs including the liver, lungs, 
and the cardiovascular and digestive systems. Misused 
substances can induce epigenetic changes with wide-
spread downstream biological consequences and alter 
the functioning of the immune and endocrine systems. 
Moreover, each substance may affect these systems dif-
ferently and interactively in polysubstance use.

Research findings over the past two decades have 
substantially enhanced our knowledge on the neurobio-
logical mechanisms and complexity of the illness caused 
by SUDs (1). As presented in the extensive reviews in 
this collection, we now understand that, unlike many 
other diseases, pharmacotherapy or behavioral/cognitive 
therapy alone is unlikely to be sufficient to either restore 
the damaged system(s) or to prevent relapse and sustain 
recovery from addiction. Pharmacotherapy alone may 
only help to reduce the severity of the disorder(s). Current 
evidence indicates that, to achieve effective treatments 
and long-term recovery from SUDs, a combination of

pharmacological treatments and evidence-based behavioral/cognitive 
therapies (newer therapies using brain stimulation and other non-
traditional approaches are also in development).

Despite our extensive understanding of the effects of addiction 
on behavior and the underlying neurobiology, knowledge remains 
limited on how the affected biological systems interact with external 
environmental factors and across the molecular, cellular, and system 
levels during the development of and recovery from SUDs. The chal-
lenge in identifying successful long-term treatments for SUDs is 
complex because of various factors. Individual differences in respond-
ing to treatments are among the known factors common to all SUDs. 
These differences are reflected in various ways, including genetic 
determinants (e.g., sex and other forms of genetic heterogeneity), 
differences in metabolic responses to medications, comorbidity with 
SUDs (e.g., addicted to alcohol and nicotine or cocaine and other 
drugs) and with other illness(s) (e.g., depression, HIV infection, and 
trauma), and the severity and behavioral manifestations of SUDs. 
Other issues are the motivation and degree of commitment to treat-
ment(s), social environment and support, and the availability and/or 
ability to afford the cost of treatments.

Currently, we lack sufficient knowledge of the following relation-
ships that challenge the development of successful treatment strategies: 
(i) mechanisms underlying the interactions among the affected 
neural circuits, molecular mechanisms, synaptic plasticity, and their 
relation to the functioning of the rest of the CNS and behavioral 
changes; (ii) causal relationships between neurobiological changes in 
the brain and their effects on the peripheral systems and vice versa (e.g., 
the interaction between the hormone ghrelin release in the gastro-
intestinal system and its effect on the CNS in alcohol craving and 
between the peripheral and central inflammatory systems in depres-
sion and addiction) (12–15); and (iii) the extent to which social 
connections and environmental factors alter neurobiological mech-
anisms in brain circuitries in patients with SUDs. These challenges 
are fundamental knowledge gaps that require continued funding for 
relevant interdisciplinary research that can foster innovative ap-
proaches and discoveries by the engaged scientific communities.

Recent advances in basic and translational research are beginning 
to transform scientific knowledge and lead to potentially new thera-
peutic targets for SUD treatment. In this collection, we present several 
recent research publications in Science Advances that aim to uncover 
the neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms that have direct 
translational potential for new treatment strategies. The study by 
Werner et al. (2019) identified a previously unknown molecular 
mechanism underlying a chromatin remodeler, INO80, its expression 
in the brain’s nucleus accumbens (NAc), and its interaction with E3 
ubiquitin ligase Trim3 protein in mediating cocaine craving in rats after 
prolonged abstinence from the drug. This finding is likely to advance 
the development of much needed pharmacological targets for the treat-
ment of cocaine use disorder. The study by Adeluyi et al. (2019) 
provided convincing evidence that nicotine and nicotine withdrawal 
induce changes in the morphology of microglia (a non-neuronal 
cell type) and their functional activation in the NAc. These changes sig-
nificantly alter proinflammatory signaling and increase epigenetic ex-
pression of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) mRNA, leading to neuronal 
oxidative stress and anxiety-like behavior in male mice. In a separate study 
with chronic nontreatment-seeking adult smokers, Flannery et al. 
(2019) found that acute nicotine abstinence significantly increased 
the activity of the habenula, a subcortical interface between the 
brain’s basal ganglia and limbic system, which was associated with 

altered hedonic processing and increased tobacco craving. Using 
functional magnetic resonance imaging, they showed that the ad-
ministration of nicotine or varenicline, a nicotine receptor partial 
agonist, significantly reduced habenula activity, demonstrating 
the underlying neurobiological efficacy of nicotine replacement 
therapy in alleviating nicotine craving. As smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable death but only about 5% of those seeking 
smoking cessation are successful in quitting, understanding the 
neurobiological mechanisms of nicotine addiction and craving 
remains a significant part of the scientific objective. As we know, 
nonpharmacological therapies are a crucial part of the successful 
treatment of SUDs. The study by Garland et al. (2019) provided 
neurophysiological evidence demonstrating the efficacy of an integrative 
behavioral and cognitive treatment for opioid use, the Mindfulness- 
Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) therapy. They showed 
that, with an 8-week regimen of training with MORE, chronic opioid 
users can remediate brain activity associated with hedonic dysregula-
tion and opioid-cue reactivity, increase responsiveness to natural 
rewards, and reduce opioid craving. Another exciting study by 
Chang et al. (2019) provided direct evidence that relatively non-
invasive peripheral stimulation with acupuncture at a specific point 
(Shenmen HT7) induces activation of brain pathways associated 
with ethanol withdrawal in rats. Acupuncture at HT7, homologous 
to the human acupoint, significantly attenuated ethanol withdrawal 
tremor and reduced alcohol self-administration by activating the 
endorphinergic input to the NAc, up-regulating the -endorphin 
levels in the NAc, and reducing neuronal activity in the arcuate 
nucleus of the hypothalamus. These scientific discoveries and other 
continuing efforts will, no doubt, open up new research targets and 
lead to the development of more effective evidence-based therapeutic 
strategies for SUD treatment and recovery.

Successful SUD treatment and recovery not only are dependent 
on the steadfast self-determination to change one’s behavior patterns 
in individuals with SUDs (i.e., in seeking treatment and quitting 
substance use) but also require a concerted effort and support from 
specialized medical professionals, social communities, industries, and 
governmental actions, in addition to scientific discoveries. It is vital 
to advocate for more medical professionals with specialized training 
in SUD treatment and to equip them with the most current scientific 
knowledge and clinical skills to tailor treatments based on individual 
differences and to apply evidence-based therapeutic tools. Continuing 
effort in social support and awareness that SUDs are medical illnesses 
is also critical in helping remove stigmas on patients seeking SUD 
treatments. Governmental policies and regulations are known to be 
a critical component in substance use prevention, treatment, and 
recovery (for details, see the comprehensive reviews in this collec-
tion). New and/or updated policies and regulations on substance 
use, substance dispensing products, and the availability of treatments 
will inevitably be necessary in light of new scientific discoveries and 
knowledge. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have rich 
scientific resources and most up-to-date information on SUDs and 
treatment-related information (see https://alcoholtreatment.niaaa.
nih.gov; www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/treatment; www.cdc.gov). 
NIH also has significant effort under way in highlighting and 
supporting translational research to accelerate and advance pre-
clinical trials and animal models to human studies. We hope that 
this Special Collection on Addiction will facilitate the effort in advancing 
the treatment and recovery process of SUDs.
