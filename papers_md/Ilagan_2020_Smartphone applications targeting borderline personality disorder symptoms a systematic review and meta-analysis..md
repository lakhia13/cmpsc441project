Abstract

Background: Smartphone applications could improve symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a
scalable and resource-efficient manner in the context limited access to specialized care.
Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of applications designed as
treatment interventions for adults with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in
BPD.
Data sources: Search terms for BPD symptoms, smartphone applications, and treatment interventions were
combined on PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2019.

Study selection: Controlled and uncontrolled studies of smartphone interventions for adult participants with
symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD were included.

Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3 was used to compute between-groups
effect sizes in controlled designs. The primary outcome was BPD-related symptoms such as anger, suicidality, and
impulsivity; and the secondary outcome was general psychopathology. An average dropout rate across
interventions was computed. Study quality, target audiences, therapeutic approach and targets, effectiveness,
intended use, usability metrics, availability on market, and downloads were assessed qualitatively from the papers
and through internet search.

Results: Twelve studies of 10 applications were included, reporting data from 408 participants. Between-groups
meta-analyses of RCTs revealed no significant effect of smartphone applications above and beyond in-person
treatments or a waitlist on BPD symptoms (Hedges’ g = − 0.066, 95% CI [−.257, .125]), nor on general
psychopathology (Hedges’ g = 0.305, 95% CI [− 0.14, 0.75]). Across the 12 trials, dropout rates ranged from 0 to
56.7% (M = 22.5, 95% CI [0.15, 0.46]). A majority of interventions studied targeted emotion dysregulation and
behavioral dyscontrol symptoms. Half of the applications are commercially available.

Conclusions: The effects of smartphone interventions on symptoms of BPD are unclear and there is currently a lack
of evidence for their effectiveness. More research is needed to build on these preliminary findings in BPD to
investigate both positive and adverse effects of smartphone applications and identify the role these technologies
may provide in expanding mental healthcare resources.

Introduction
Despite the proliferation of psychological treatment of
mental health disorders, about 70% of individuals in the
United States in need of mental health services do not
receive them [28], and the treatment gap for mental ill-
nesses remains large internationally, ranging from 32.2%
for schizophrenia to 50.2–56.3% for mood disorders to
78.1% for alcohol use and dependence (WHO [29];).
While evidence-based treatments are typically delivered
face-to-face by licensed professionals, the majority of
those in need for treatment both in the U.S. and inter-
nationally in countries of various income levels express
difficulty in accessing mental healthcare, for both attitu-
dinal (e.g. stigma,
low perceived need) and structural
(e.g. cost, availability) reasons [1, 44]. Technology-based
innovations (e.g., mental health applications) have been
proposed as a way to expand the reach of psychosocial
interventions and address the treatment gap [26, 27].

The treatment gap is wider still for the treatment of
borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the U.S., for
every mental healthcare provider trained in an evidence-
based treatment for BPD, there are 5933 treatment-
seeking individuals with the disorder, and this number
would only rise if non-treatment-seekers were included
[25]. This poses a significant public health problem since
BPD is a prevalent, disabling, and potentially fatal dis-
order with a suicide rate of 5.9% [66] and elevated rates
of physical and mental disability [20]. Individuals with
BPD account for 9–20% of psychiatric emergency hospi-
talizations [33, 48]. Society pays a high price for the as-
sociated mortality and morbidity of BPD, with estimated
costs of $12,696–19,231 per patient yearly, on the order
of schizophrenia [71].

While many empirically validated treatments exist for
BPD — such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT [35];),
mentalization-based treatment (MBT [3, 4];), schema-
focused therapy (SFT [19];), and transference-focused psy-
chotherapy (TFP; [8, 10]) — the intensity, specialization,
and cost of these effective treatments restricts their avail-
ability [25] and their appeal to patients [36]. The limited
role of medications as a definitive treatment for BPD im-
pedes the provision of care by generalist or primary care
providers based on prescribing algorithms. These inten-
sive psychotherapies are considered a “gold standard” for
BPD as they incorporate group therapy, individual ses-
and in DBT
sions,
intersession skills coaching [5]. They require highly inten-
sive training and support for practitioners, which are diffi-
cult to impossible to implement in most under-resourced
locales.
Data

from the National Comorbidity
Survey-
Replication (NCS-R [62];) demonstrate that, while indi-
viduals with BPD accessed treatments more frequently
than individuals with a DSM-IV Axis I disorder, only

consultation team meetings,

17% of individuals with BPD sought treatment from a
psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, while 29% sought
treatment from a traditional provider, i.e., a nonpsychiat-
ric physician (18%), a social worker (4%), psychiatrist
(14%), clinical psychologist (7%). Over 70% of those with
BPD symptoms seeking services did so through nontra-
ditional sources, including “spiritual advisors,” “nontradi-
tional healers,” mental health hotlines (12%), self-help
support groups (20%),
internet support groups (4%),
herbal medicine (8%), and consultation with “telephone
psychics” (3%). Follow-up data from the National Epide-
miologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Cognitions
(NESARC [68];) show that 25.1% of
individuals with
BPD will not seek mental health treatment from a phys-
ician, therapist, or counselor in their lifetime, and that
this number is higher in men (31.2%) than in women
(20.6%). These numbers underscore the fact that many
individuals who need BPD treatment will not access it.

increasing access to care.

Computerized interventions are one potential avenue
to increase availability of components of evidence-based
care to individuals with BPD who cannot access treat-
ment, and to bolster the efficacy of existing treatments.
Access to smartphones far exceeds access to mental
health professionals in the U.S., with 81% of U.S. Ameri-
cans now owning a smartphone [50] and 90% using the
internet [51], while only about 30% of the U.S. popula-
tion is able to access mental health care when they need
it [28]. The evidence base for the efficacy of internet-
delivered and smartphone application-mediated treat-
ments in addressing depression, anxiety, and stress is
growing [12, 34]. Smartphone applications have been
utilized in the prevention and treatment of substance
use disorders (for review, see [39]), schizophrenia [15],
anxiety [16], and depression ([17], e.g., IntelliCare, [43])
as a means of
Internet-
delivered interventions have similar advantages to smart-
phone applications, e.g. adaptability, accessibility, ano-
nymity, flexibility in time and frequency of use [6], and
have likewise been employed in treatments for a wide
range of disorders [2, 22, 30, 53]. Recent years have seen
an upsurge in studies of technology in the treatment of
BPD, with more studies on the topic indexed on
PubMed between 2013 and 2019 than in between 1984
and 2012. However, there has been no review and quan-
titative synthesis to date on smartphone applications tar-
geting symptoms of BPD more broadly rather than
suicidality (i.e., suicidal thoughts and behaviors) exclu-
sively [76]. The heterogeneity of studies of smartphone
interventions for symptoms of anger, suicidality, nonsui-
cidal self-injury (NSSI), and others that are closely asso-
ciated with BPD motivates a synthesis of the evidence.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is
therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone ap-
plications designed as interventions for symptoms that

Ilagan et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2020) 7:12

commonly occur in adults with BPD in reducing these
symptoms and general psychopathology, considering
both controlled and uncontrolled designs. This report
will summarize and analyze data on the population
served by these smartphone applications, especially in
comparison to in-person treatments; the smartphone ap-
plications’ effectiveness;
therapeutic approaches and
common elements; specific symptom targets; and their
availability and usability.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in
accordance with PRISMA guidelines [42]. The review was
not registered and no review protocol exists, since the re-
view was not originally conducted with publication in mind
and the authors wished to avoid post hoc registration.

Identification and selection of studies
Across all available articles on MEDLINE, PsycINFO,
and PubMed from database inception to December 4,
2019, we combined search terms borderline personality
disorder and its symptoms (such as interpersonal hyper-
sensitivity, emptiness, affective lability, or self-injurious
behavior)1 with keywords for applications (smartphone,
smartphone application, mobile application, or app) and
interventions (intervention, treatment, or therapy). From
this search, we identified 487 unique citations. Two au-
thors (GI, EI) screened titles and abstracts for full-text
review if they evaluated the effectiveness of treatment in-
terventions for symptoms that are also criteria for BPD
(e.g., anger, suicidality and NSSI) for adults delivered
through a smartphone application, regardless of length
of follow-up. Studies were included regardless of lan-
guage. Even uncontrolled studies were included for pre-
post comparison if they reported outcomes data on
BPD-related symptoms. These criteria led to the exclu-
sion of entries with (a) methods outside the scope of
smartphone applications,
(b) smartphone applications
not designed specifically as interventions, (c) the absence
of borderline-related symptoms as outcomes, and (d)
participants below the age of 18 to ensure homogeneity
of participants. To allow for a more comprehensive ap-
proach including individuals with subthreshold BPD or

BPD traits, participant BPD diagnostic status was not an
inclusion/exclusion criterion.

Assessment of Bias
Two raters (EI, GI) assessed risk of bias at the study level
in the RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of
Bias Assessment Tool [23], which assess bias in: ad-
equacy of the random sequence generation; allocation
concealment; blinding of participants, clinical personnel,
and outcome assessors;
incomplete data; and selective
outcome reporting.

Systematic review of studies
Review of the resulting smartphone applications was
conducted by two investigators (EI, GI) using piloted
forms and focused on identifying their (a) target audi-
ences, (b) therapeutic approaches and targets, (c) effect-
iveness, and (d) intended use as adjuncts or standalone
interventions. We obtained information on the availabil-
ity and price of the smartphone applications, as well as
the ratings (out of 5 stars) and estimated number of
downloads (only available on Google Play), through the
App Store and Google Play to gauge usability. We also
abstracted and included in usability analysis any smart-
phone application usage data reported by the study au-
thors. We computed dropout rates using data reported
in CONSORT diagrams and in text.

Meta-analysis
A between-groups meta-analysis of the RCT data was
conducted. We extracted data at baseline and immediately
posttreatment. Effect sizes were computed using the mean
change across intervention and control conditions, and
the pooled standard deviation of the differences computed
p
using the formula ( σ diff ¼
), where σ1
and σ2 are the pre- and post-standard deviations of a given
arm and ρ is the correlation between the two measure-
ments [59]. Positive values indicated an advantage of the
intervention condition. The primary outcome was
borderline-related symptoms (e.g., anger, suicidality, im-
pulsivity). The secondary outcome was general psycho-
pathology
stress, depression,
overall psychopathology).

Results
A comprehensive literature search yielded 15 full-text
articles. Of these, 3 did not measure BPD-related symp-
toms. A total of 12 articles describing 10 smartphone
applications was included for qualitative synthesis. Of
the 12 articles, 5 described 5 smartphone applications
reporting data in a manner that was amenable to
between-groups meta-analysis, and were included in
quantitative synthesis (Fig. 1 [24]). These articles in-
cluded a total of 596 participants (52.0% male; age: M =
32.3, 95% CI [25.5, 39.0]) from a range of recruitment
settings, who used the provided smartphone application
for a mean length of 6.5 weeks, 95% CI [4.8, 8.2].

Included articles studied U.S. (N = 6 [7, 38, 41, 45, 54,
55];), European (N = 3; O’Toole et al., 2019 [49, 52];),
Australian (N = 2 [40, 67];), and international (N = 1 [18];
) samples, although the last study had a majority of par-
ticipants across articles from North America (86%) or

Europe (11%). Special populations studied included vet-
erans (N = 3 [7, 38, 45];), acute psychiatric inpatients
(N = 1 [41];), and indigenous Australian individuals (N =
1 [67];). Only 3 studies had BPD diagnosis and DBT
treatment as inclusion criteria, with Prada et al. [52] and
Rizvi et al. [55] diagnosing participants using the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV Axis II Disorders
[14], and Rizvi et al. [54] relying on reports from DBT
clinicians in the absence of any diagnostic interviews or
measures. Remaining studies recruited for elevated sui-
cidality (N = 5 [7, 18, 40, 47, 49];), elevated anger (N = 2
[38, 45];), elevated psychological distress [67], and a his-
tory of aggression or violence [41]. None assessed BPD
as an outcome measure.

Notably, many of these studies had exclusion criteria
driven by safety concerns and to isolate effects on the
features of interest in each study. Studies excluded those
with active suicidal
ideation [38, 67], current primary
psychotic disorder, severe depression, bipolar disorder
[47], and those with alcohol or substance use disorders
as well as current need for inpatient treatment [38, 47].

Qualitative review
This investigation included review of studies of 10 differ-
ent smartphone applications studied in 12 reports. The
applications can be categorized in terms of symptomatic
targets: (1) suicide and self-harm, (2) emotion regulation,
and (3) more broad symptom targets which include both
self-destructive and emotion regulation problems.

Suicide and self-harm applications
TecTec [18] aimed to decrease levels of non-suicidal self-
injury by using principles of therapeutic evaluative con-
ditioning (TEC). The application prompted users to pair
positive
stimuli with self-related words, and self-
injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) stimuli with
aversive stimuli in a progressively difficult game-like for-
mat that awarded points for performance. It was tested
in 3 separate RCTs with similar methodologies, all of
which compared the results of active TEC to a that of a
control TEC in which pairings were related to neutral
stimuli only, rather than aversive stimuli.

BeyondNow [40] tasked users with creating, editing
and sharing a personalized safety plan, including con-
tacts and emergency services. It was delivered along with
Treatment as Usual (TAU) to decrease suicidality. There
was no comparison condition.

Life App’tite [47] provided psychoeducation on suicidal
thoughts, symptom and habit monitoring, a personalized
safety plan, a list of places to seek help, a digital hope kit
similar to the virtual hope box (VHB) of Bush et al. [7],
and a library of self-help exercises (e.g. self-soothing,
problem solving skills). It was compared to TAU in a
Danish clinic.

BackUp [49] included a library of coping skills, a safety
plan that included recognition of risk factors, a hope box
similar to the VHB of Bush et al. [7], and a means to
quickly reach out to one’s social network. It was tested on
adults in the Netherlands, with no comparison condition.

Emotion regulation applications
Remote Exercises for Learning Anger & Excitation Man-
agement (RELAX [38, 45];) tracks the frequency, inten-
sity, and cues of anger symptoms and prompts to
practice personalized behavioral management exercises
suggested by the smartphone application to improve
anger management skills in veterans with posttraumatic
stress disorder. Together with a heart rate monitor for
real-time biofeedback, RELAX was used in conjunction
with anger management treatment (AMT) to encourage
the use of adaptive coping skills learned in treatment,
and compared to AMT alone.

EMOTEO [52] tracked levels of aversive tension and
provided audio- and videotaped mindfulness and distress
tolerance exercises, chosen depending on the user’s re-
ported level of tension. It was tested in conjunction with

DBT for women with BPD, with no comparison
condition.

Headspace [41] provides brief mindfulness meditation
exercises intended to reduce anger and aggression. It
was tested on patients on an acute psychiatric unit, with
no comparison condition.

Multipurpose (suicide/self-harm, impulsivity, and emotion
regulation) applications
Three smartphone applications had multiple BPD symptom
targets, with 2 having suicidality or self-harm included and
2 having emotion regulation included as targets.

Virtual Hope Box (VHB [7];) aimed to restore emotional
equilibrium and reduce suicidal ideation, provide tools for
distraction, relaxation, and stress-coping; and serve as a re-
pository of fond memories and inspirational quotes as re-
minders of positive life experiences, reasons for living, and
people who care. Designed to be customizable, instructive
in coping with negative thoughts and feelings, and useful
for emotion regulation, VHB delivered in conjunction with
TAU was compared to TAU enhanced by printed materials
on coping with suicidal thoughts.

DBT Coach [54] monitored emotional

intensity and
urges to use substances, and encouraged labeling emo-
tions then using the opposite action skill if they were
willing to do so or evaluating the pros and cons of chan-
ging the emotion if not. With emotion-specific responses
and suggestions on how to cope instead of acting impul-
sively, DBT Coach was implemented with adults in a
DBT clinic with no comparison condition. The second
trial of DBT Coach was expanded to include most DBT
skills and tracked urges to self-harm [55].

ibobbly [67] was a suicide prevention application that
tasked participants with completing 3 modules in order:
first, identifying and distancing themselves from thoughts,
feelings and behaviors (particularly suicidal thoughts and
behaviors); next, using skills for emotion regulation; and
lastly, setting goals to help them live by their values. With
culturally responsive suggestions and personalized action
plans, ibobbly was tested specifically in a sample of indi-
genous Australians compared to a waitlisted group.

Overall, in terms of study design, 5 out of the 12 articles
described randomized controlled trials (RCTs [7, 18, 38,
47, 67];) while the rest were uncontrolled pre-test/post-
test studies [40, 41, 45, 49, 52, 54, 55]. Franklin et al. [18]
described 3 RCTs in 1 article. Three smartphone applica-
tions were designed as stand-alone interventions [18, 49,
67]. The others were delivered as adjuncts to other inter-
ventions: treatment as usual [7, 40, 47], DBT [52, 54, 55],
inpatient treatment [41], and anger management treat-
ment [38, 45]. (See Table 1 for overview.)

In terms of therapeutic approach, a significant majority
(N = 9) of smartphone applications were based at least in
part on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

[7, 18, 38, 40, 45, 47, 49, 52, 54, 55, 67] and one was
based on principles of mindfulness [41]. The CBT-based
applications suggested skills and strategies to use when
faced with intense emotions. One exception was TecTec,
which instead employed behavioral conditioning to
modify positive and negative associations with the self
and self-harm [18]. Other common features included
psychoeducation, delivered in Life App’Tite and ibobbly
[47, 67]; symptom monitoring, which was utilized by
RELAX, Life App’tite, EMOTEO, and DBT Coach [38,
45, 47, 52, 54, 55]; and safety plans, which were used in
BeyondNow, Life App’tite, and BackUp [40, 47, 49].

In terms of symptom clusters targeted, 6 of the 10
smartphone applications targeted behavioral dyscontrol
symptoms commonly occurring in BPD. DBT Coach
and ibobbly addressed impulsivity [54, 55, 67], while also
addressing nonsuicidal self-injury or suicide attempts
along with Virtual Hope Box, BeyondNow, Life App’tite,
and BackUp [7, 40, 47, 49]. Five applications targeted
emotional symptoms, specifically Virtual Hope Box,
EMOTEO, and DBT Coach for affective instability [7,
52, 54, 55], and RELAX and Headspace for anger specif-
ically [38, 41, 45]. None targeted symptoms related to
interpersonal sensitivity, distorted cognition, or identity
disturbance.

Of the 7 RCTs reported in these 5 articles, 5 reported
significant improvements: in depression and distress in
the ibobbly group over the six-week follow-up [67], in
self-harm in the TecTec group across the 3 trials [18], and
in stress coping in the VHB group [7] compared to their
control groups. In contrast, Mackintosh et al. [38] found
no differences between the RELAX group and the control
group over the six-month posttreatment follow-up, while
O'Toole et al. [47] actually found a smaller decrease in
suicide risk in the Life App’tite compared to the control
group, although this was only at the trend level at the
four-month follow-up. In addition, the positive effects of
TecTec were not maintained 1 month posttreatment [18].
Of the 7 pre-post trials, 6 reported generally favorable
results. There were significant improvements in emotional
intensity and urges to use substances [54] and self-harm
for DBT Coach users over the three-month follow-up
[55]; in suicide-related coping, severity and intensity of
suicidal ideation for BeyondNow users [40]; and in aver-
sive tension for EMOTEO users [52]. Another two studies
reported nonsignificant trends: BackUp resulted in de-
creases in suicidal ideation [49], and RELAX resulted in
reductions in anger, and posttraumatic stress disorder and
depression symptoms in the 4 users over the three-month
follow-up [45]. Mistler et al. [41] reported no significant
change in anger following use of Headspace. No posttreat-
ment follow-up data was available for BeyondNow, Head-
space, BackUp, EMOTEO, and the first version of DBT
Coach [40, 41, 49, 52, 54].

Most included studies did not report serious adverse
events. There was one attempted suicide during the trial
of BeyondNow, and multiple during the trials of TecTec
[18, 40]. Both the Life App’tite trial and one of the three
TecTec trials reported a slower reduction in suicidality
(i.e., suicide risk and suicidal ideation and plans, respect-
ively) in the group that used the application compared
to the control group post-treatment [18, 47].

Availability and usability
The studies reported promising data on smartphone ap-
plication usage, with available rates of usage ranging
from 70.2–100%, with “usage” defined as accessing the
application at least once. Dropout rates ranged from 0 to
56.7% (M = 22.5, 95% CI [12.4, 32.6]), with “dropout”
computed as the percentage of participants receiving the
intervention who did not complete the final follow-up,
or in the case of Rizvi et al. [55], dropped out of
treatment.

Commercially available applications
Six smartphone applications were available at no cost in
both the App Store and Google Play: VHB [7], TecTec
[18], Headspace [41], BackUp [49], EMOTEO [52], and
ibobbly [67]. The median rating was 5 out of 5 stars, al-
though in most cases the number of raters was low (N <
35). Headspace had the greatest number of downloads at
10,000,000+, and was rated 3.7–4.9/5 by users (N = 702,
229 ratings), followed by VHB with 100,000+ downloads
and a 4/5 rating by users (N = 962 ratings). BackUp and
EMOTEO both had over 5000 downloads, but BackUp
was rated higher at 3.7–5 out of 5 (N = 26 ratings) than
rated 3.3 (N = 31 ratings).
EMOTEO, which was
BackUp’s number of downloads is also notable consider-
ing it is only available in Flemish – and the only applica-
tion to use a language other than English. ibobbly had
the lowest number of downloads (50+), but was rated 5
out of 5 by 3 users. Rating and download data was un-
available for TecTec.

In general, the App Store and Google Play data show
variable engagement in these applications, which aligns
with the usability data reported in the articles. The mini-
mum reported percentage of participants that accessed
the smartphone application at least once during the
study period was 70% [18], with other studies citing
higher participation rates. The studies that provided data
on frequencies of use reported 76.1% (N = 16) of BackUp
users accessing it at least several times [49], 67% (N = 8)
of Headspace users using it “often” [41], 56.9% of VHB
users (N = 33) accessing it at least a few times a week
[7], and EMOTEO users accessing it an average of 1.71
(SD = 3.62) times per day over the course of the 6 month
trial [52].

Three studies asked participants about helpfulness and
likelihood of using the smartphone application in their
daily lives. Bush et al. [7] reported lower percentages,
with 70.1% of VHB users rating it as at least somewhat
helpful and 55.2% indicating they were likely to use it
again. Sixty-seven percent of Headspace users thought it
was helpful in managing their symptoms and endorsed
willingness to use it in the future [41], and 80% of
BackUp users rated the application as helpful and 70%
said they would use it in daily life [49].

All applications are available at no cost and most au-
thors do not declare competing interests, aside from
Franklin et al. [18]. The first author J. C. Franklin owns
Tec-Tec, LLC (limited liability company), and at the
time of publication had a pending patent application
with the third author, C. R. Franklin. VHB [7] was made
available by the National Center for Telehealth and
Technology, part of the U.S. Military Health System.
While Headspace, Inc. provided free use of their product
to Mistler et al. [41], they were not involved in the con-
duct, analysis or reporting of the research, and no study
authors had any type of financial relationship with them.
BackUp [49] was funded by the Flemish government,
ibobbly [67] was funded by the Australian Government
Department of Health and Aging, and EMOTEO [52]
was supported by funds from and is made available by
The University Hospitals of Geneva.

Commercially unavailable applications
The other four applications (BeyondNow, DBT Coach,
Life App’Tite, and RELAX) could not be found on the
App Store or Google Play. Nevertheless, the studies that
investigated their effectiveness reported somewhat favor-
able data on their usability. The minimum reported per-
centage of participants that accessed the smartphone
application at least once during the study was 77.3%
[40], and qualitatively reported strengths of these appli-
cations included portability, discreetness, and customiz-
ability [45], ease of use [38, 45], and the provision of
hope, connection and utility [40].

Three studies asked participants about helpfulness,
and 2 asked about the likelihood of using the smart-
phone application in their daily lives. Mackintosh et al.
[38] and Morland et al. [45] reported helpfulness rating
of 4.5–5 out of 6 for RELAX, while participants of Rizvi
et al. [54] rated DBT Coach’s opposite action coaching
helpful 96.8% of the time. Moreover, the 2 trials for
DBT Coach reported that 90–100% of participants
would use the application of their own initiative [54, 55].
That said, Rizvi et al. [55] found that DBT Coach users
gave low ratings on how enjoyable and interesting it
was, and Mackintosh et al. [38] reported that RELAX
users spent a significantly shorter time practicing skills
between sessions compared to the group that received

anger management treatment alone. The usability of
these applications may therefore be limited or have un-
intended
and
consolidation.

Risk of Bias
Risk of bias per study is presented in Fig. 2. Risk of bias
assessment revealed low risk of bias in the included
RCTs in areas of random sequence generation and
blinding of outcome assessment. Allocation concealment
was unclear in 2 studies but presented low risk of bias in
5. For most studies, it was impossible to conceal alloca-
tion due to the near impossibility of masking psycho-
logical interventions, except for the RCTs reported by
Franklin et al. [18], which presented participants in both
arms with automated therapeutic evaluative conditioning
(TEC) tasks with minor differences that were unlikely to
be apparent to participants. For 3 studies, it was unclear
whether attrition bias (incomplete data reporting) sig-
nificantly affected the results, whereas for 4, risk of this
form of bias was deemed low. Only 2 studies had a study
protocol available that made it possible to determine
they were at low risk of bias for selective reporting, while
the remaining 5 did not. Studies that reported more
positive effect sizes [18, 67] did not have different risk of
bias profiles from other studies in this analysis with
more unfavorable outcomes [18, 47]. Meta-regression
analysis found no significant moderation of effect sizes
by the number of risk of bias criteria rated low.

Quantitative review
Between-groups meta-analysis of RCTs
Five articles describing 7 RCTs reported between-groups
data on the primary outcome of BPD-related symptoms
using 7 measures of suicidality and NSSI, 2 measures of
anger, and 1 measure of impulsivity, as listed in Table 2.
A Hedges’ g of −.05 (95% CI [−.24, .14]) was not statisti-
cally significant, I2 = 27.40%, p = .62 (Fig. 3).

Data from the RCTs also suggested these smartphone
applications were not associated with a significant effect
on general psychopathology, as measured by 2 measures
of depression, a measure of stress, and a measure of dis-
tress across 4 trials. A Hedges g of .31 (95% CI [−.14,
.75]) was not significant and there was substantial het-
erogeneity, I2 = 76.16%, p = .18.

Publication Bias
Inspection of funnel plots and Duval and Tweedie’s trim
and fill procedure [11] revealed no publication bias for
BPD symptoms, nor for general psychopathology out-
comes. Egger’s intercept [13] failed to reach significance
across outcomes, again suggesting no publication bias.

Discussion
We systematically reviewed 10 smartphone applications
designed as interventions for BPD-related symptoms, and
performed a meta-analysis for the 7 RCTs. This meta-
analysis revealed no significant differences in effects of
conditions with and without smartphone applications on
BPD-related symptoms or general psychopathology.
Symptom targets included state dimensions of BPD, in-
suicidality, emotion dysregulation,
cluding self-harm,
anger, and impulsivity. The included studies were con-
ducted in North America, Europe, and Australia, with lim-
ited data from other parts of the world, and limited data
in general as the literature on smartphone applications for
BPD symptoms is scarce.

These findings, based on a small group of studies, sug-
gest that BPD-related interventions delivered via smart-
phone applications are still incipient and it is too early
to recommend them as standalone or even adjunctive
treatments. The qualitative synthesis revealed mixed re-
sults. While HeadSpace, Life App’tite, and BeyondNow
evidenced no significant clinical contributions, the un-
controlled studies generally reported hopeful findings,
with BeyondNow, RELAX, EMOTEO, and DBT Coach
resulting in some reductions in BPD-related symptom-
atology. However, when smartphone applications were
tested under more stringent conditions in controlled tri-
als, there were rarely between-group differences in clin-
ically relevant outcomes. The exceptions were the
applications tested against low-intensity comparators, i.e.
TecTec, which resulted in short-term improvements in
NSSI compared to a control app; and iBobbly, which re-
sulted in reduced depression and distress compared to a
waitlist. The meta-analysis pooled outcomes of con-
trolled studies, and found no evidence that smartphone
applications confer any additional benefit in reducing
BPD-related symptoms above and beyond a waitlist or
the in-person treatments they were delivered alongside.
While some of the study-level results are encouraging,
the effect sizes found in this preliminary meta-analysis
suggest that it is too early to make treatment recom-
mendations involving smartphone apps for BPD-related
symptoms or to use them in the place of existing
treatments.

And yet, the development of resource-efficient treat-
ment resources for BPD is critical to increase access to
care and technology is a promising avenue for doing so
in mental health care at large [12, 34]. Our review sug-
gests that the adaptation of a range of treatment ap-
proaches to smartphone applications is user-friendly
based on the ratings, number of downloads, frequency of
use and interest in using the application beyond the
study duration. The question, then, is how to capitalize

on these user-friendly smartphone applications to contrib-
ute to efforts to increase resources for BPD care.

Given that there is no evidence that smartphone appli-
cations are helpful in reducing BPD-related symptom-
atology, but only 1 in 5 individuals with BPD are likely
to seek live treatment from a psychiatrist or psycholo-
gist, the field needs more data on what specific roles
these smartphone applications might occupy in the
treatment landscape of BPD. One possible role is to pro-
vide psychoeducation or skills training to individuals
with BPD symptoms. In terms of purpose and content,
the majority of smartphone applications considered in
our analyses were (a) adjunctive and (b) were based on
CBT principles and DBT skills. Since the therapeutic ap-
proach most often represented in the design of the ap-
plications in this study, as well as other reviews [37], was
CBT and its variants, this suggests CBT- and DBT-based
interventions may prove better suited for technological
interface than other evidence-based approaches (i.e. psy-
chodynamic psychotherapies like MBT or TFP), possibly
because the level of psychoeducation and teaching in-
volved can be delivered without face-to-face interaction
with a healthcare professional [72, 74]. Psychoeducation
in and of itself has been shown to be helpful in reducing
BPD symptoms, even when internet-delivered, so smart-
phone applications can at least be a potential avenue for
equipping individuals with basic knowledge of the dis-
order [77].

A second potential role of smartphone applications
would be to minimize phone coaching, as clinicians can
find it difficult to implement this component of BPD
treatments due to personal time and resources unavail-
able for calls outside of business hours [32]. If so, this
may broaden implementation of evidence-based treat-
ments for BPD. Among the included studies, only Rizvi
et al. [54] investigated whether their smartphone appli-
find
cation reduced coaching calls. They did not

evidence that the frequency of coaching calls received by
the therapist decreased during the trial of DBT Coach,
but whether other smartphone applications could pro-
vide alternatives to intersession contact or even enhance
the focus of such contact deserves further study.

Another potential role of smartphone applications
could be to engage individuals who have not yet entered
treatment. The majority of the included studies investi-
gated the utility of adding a smartphone application to
in-person treatments, i.e., increasing intensity of treat-
ments that typically have already demonstrated efficacy.
In order to investigate the utility of smartphone apps in
targeting symptoms of BPD when no other options are
available, studies should ideally compare the efficacy of a
smartphone intervention alone to a waitlist control
group, as in Tighe et al. [67], or to a control app that
similarly has no accompanying in-person intervention,
as in Franklin et al. [18]. Tighe et al. [67], the only study
to have a waitlist comparison group, found no between-
group differences in suicidal ideation or impulsivity, but
did find lower depression and distress in the group that
used iBobbly. Instead of increasing intensity of in-person
treatments with patients who are already motivated to
be in treatment, it would be beneficial to study whether
these smartphone interventions can provide at least re-
duction in distress in the vast majority of people with
BPD who are unable or unmotivated to access in-person
treatment. Individuals who do not seek psychological or
psychiatric help may need a low-intensity starting point
to motivate access to further treatment. A study of two
single-session suicide-focused interventions with 93
non-treatment-engaged participants found that half of
the participants went on to seek mental health services
during a 3-month follow-up period [73]. Furthermore,
individuals with suicidal ideation have variable levels of
willingness to engage in face-to-face treatment. When
suicide risk increases, willingness to seek face-to-face

Ilagan et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2020) 7:12

help appears to decrease but for the subgroup of emer-
ging adults, willingness to seek help from informal on-
line sources appears to increase [63]. These suggestions
as to the potential of smartphone applications to reach
non-treatment-engaged individuals are tentative. More
focused avenues of research are needed to gain clarity
on how exactly smartphone applications can contribute
to closing the treatment gap, given their current inability
to replace or supplement in-person treatments.

These studies would need to be weighed with ethical
considerations and clearly report usability and safety. In
terms of usability, the utility of smartphone applications
is limited by user engagement [69]. That 70–100% of
participants in the included studies accessed the smart-
phone application at least once and that 67–100% would
use it beyond the study duration is promising, but dis-
continuing usage of applications is common, with about
25% of users abandoning applications after one use, and
68% abandoning them after only 10 uses [56]. For
health-related applications specifically, 45.7% of users re-
port discontinuing usage due to time required (44.5%),
loss of interest (40.5%), hidden costs (36.1%), confusion
(32.8%), and dislike of data being shared with friends
(29% [31];). While dropout rates in the present group of
studies averaged at 22.5, 95% CI [12.4, 32.6], on par with
dropout rates from DBT treatment (28, 95% CI [23.6,
32.9] [9];), they showed much higher variance (0–56.7%)
and ranges of engagement reported in this study were
wide. Given the general bias in research studies towards
interpreting user engagement ratings as positive [46], the
actual likelihood of application utilization is unclear at
this point in time and further study is needed. In terms
of safety, factors that may influence the perceived usability
and safety risk (e.g. privacy policies [57];) of smartphone
applications designed as interventions should be explored
as well. Some of the included studies reported suicide at-
tempts [18, 40] or slower reduction of suicide risk com-
pared to the control group [18, 47], and the dearth of
research on the potential adverse effects of mobile mental
health technologies must be addressed [60].

Other directions for future research include studies
with standard, reliable measures of BPD symptoms (see
[21] for list of potential measures); more follow-up data
to investigate whether application usage and improve-
ments are sustained; homogenous measures across stud-
to ease pooling and comparison of outcomes;
ies
exploration of effective applications’ mechanisms of
change; and study samples outside North America, Eur-
ope, and Australia. There are also opportunities to inte-
grate applications with passive data collection and
ambulatory/ecological momentary assessment/interven-
tion [61, 70], which may allow for more sophisticated
treatment development. Given the large variability in
dropout rates between applications (0–56.7%), predictors

of dropout should be analyzed to optimize user experi-
ence and maximize retention, e.g. technological barriers
have been shown to significantly predict dropout from
an Internet-delivered DBT intervention [75].

There are several limitations to this review and the
scope of generalization of its findings. First and fore-
most, the majority of the apps included in this review,
although designed to address symptoms of suicidality,
NSSI, anger, and impulsivity that frequently occur in
BPD, were not designed specifically with BPD in mind.
Few studies screened for BPD and only three out of 12
required a BPD diagnosis. A second limitation is the
narrow scope of this review. There are a number of
Internet-delivered interventions that can be accessed on
one’s smartphone that were not included because they
were not smartphone applications, even if they have
similar attributes of being portable and accessible (e.g.
[74]). Thirdly, it is debatable whether a sample of studies
this small merits a meta-analysis, especially given the
substantial heterogeneity of the included studies in the
the
general psychopathology analysis. The results of
meta-analysis should therefore be regarded as prelimin-
ary. Fourthly, the review was not registered, since it was
not originally conducted with publication in mind, and
the authors wished to avoid post hoc registration. How-
ever, lack of prospective registration introduces risk of
selective reporting bias [65]. Fifthly, we calculated effect
sizes based on baseline and immediate post-treatment
scores, although some studies had multiple time points.
There are also limitations on the study level. For ex-
ample, the risk profile of the included participants across
studies was relatively low. While the cautious method-
these studies understandably restricted the
ology of
levels of risk in their samples, patients with BPD present
with high comorbidity [20, 64], and many patients will
have active suicidal ideation, current severe psychopath-
ology, need for inpatient treatment, or substance use dis-
orders. Finally, psychosocial functioning is an important
outcome that many of these studies did not measure.

Conclusions
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study provides an
overview of available and studied smartphone interven-
tions, finding that these interventions are user-friendly,
but no more effective than their comparison conditions.
The research on these applications is scarce, develop-
ment of these applications is still in the early stages, and
for now, gold standard evidence-based specialist and
generalist treatments for BPD should remain the recom-
mendation of choice. While smartphone applications
and other computerized solutions have proven to be a
promising avenue for bridging the mental healthcare gap
in other diagnoses, evidence is lacking to recommend
them for this purpose to target BPD symptoms in the

Ilagan et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2020) 7:12

absence of further studies. Access to smartphones cur-
rently exceeds access to mental healthcare, and smart-
phone applications hold potential to provide some form
of help when other forms of care are simply unavailable.
More research is needed to investigate how to design
these smartphone applications to be effective in contrib-
uting to BPD-related care.
