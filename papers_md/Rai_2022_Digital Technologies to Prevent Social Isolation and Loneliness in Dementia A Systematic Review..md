Abstract.
Background: Dementia poses signiﬁcant and sustained challenges to global society. Diagnosis can lead to increased feelings
of loneliness and social isolation. People with dementia living alone are particularly at risk. Considering the growing number
of technologies proposed to aid people with dementia address social isolation and loneliness, we reviewed the existing
literature.
Objective: To collate and summarize current evidence for digital technologies to prevent social isolation and loneliness for
people with dementia.
Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched ﬁve databases to identify studies of digital tech-
nologies designed to support or prevent social isolation or loneliness for people with dementia. Pre-speciﬁed outcomes
included social isolation, loneliness, and quality of life. We used deductive thematic analysis to synthesize the major themes
emerging from the studies.
Results: Ten studies met our inclusion criteria where all studies reported improvements in quality of life and seven reported
beneﬁts regarding social inclusion or a reduction in loneliness. Technologies were varied across purpose, delivery format,
theoretical models, and levels of personalization. Two studies clearly described the involvement of people with dementia in
the study design and ﬁve technologies were available outside the research context.
Conclusion: There is limited—but increasing—evidence that technologies hold potential to improve quality of life and reduce
isolation/loneliness for people with dementia. Results presented are largely based in small-scale research studies. Involvement
of people with dementia was limited and few research concepts are reaching implementation. Closer collaboration with people
with dementia to provide affordable, inclusive, and person-centered solutions is urgently required.

Keywords: Dementia, digital technology, loneliness, quality of life, social isolation

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

INTRODUCTION

Over 55 million people live with dementia world-
wide and this ﬁgure is expected to increase to 78
million by 2030 [1]. The condition poses signif-
icant and sustained challenges to societies on a
global scale, limiting the functional ability of those
affected, with wide reaching impacts across fami-
lies and communities. Despite recent advances, we
remain without disease modifying therapy for demen-
tia [2, 3]. There is a continued global need to deliver
high quality care across the dementia care pathway
from diagnosis to end of life.

Much research has informed how to deliver high
quality care for people with dementia. For example,
the work of Kitwood highlights the importance of
person-centered care and personhood which requires
the person with dementia to be recognized as an indi-
vidual with unique needs and preferences and to be
treated with dignity and respect [4]. Personhood is
rooted in a social context given that it is provided
by the presence of others and therefore supported
by inter-personal relationships [4]. The emphasis is
placed on the person behind the diagnosis mean-
ing that individuals will differ in their care needs
and preferences for which tailored care is necessary.
Accordingly, offering the tailored support at the right
time and right place is documented in the current
national dementia plans and policies that have been
developed around the world [5].

Increasingly, there is a public health interest to
improve delivery models of healthy aging- includ-
ing to increase functional ability such as building
and maintaining relationships for people with a sig-
niﬁcant ongoing loss in capacities [6]. Throughout
life our social interactions help us to navigate the
world, express our thoughts and feelings, and stay
physically and mentally healthier [7]. The impact
of social connectedness goes beyond conversations:
it is about friendships, community, releasing stress
and tensions, developing “belonging” and enhancing
self-esteem and self-worth. While our personalities
may inﬂuence how much social interaction we funda-
mentally “need”, many individuals do not enjoy their
desired level of social connectedness. It is understood
that half a million people in the United Kingdom
(UK) do not see or speak to anyone for up to six
days a week [8]. A diagnosis of dementia brings an
increased risk of social isolation which can negatively
impact quality of life (QoL) [9]. Moreover, feelings of
loneliness are more likely for certain groups of people
including those who live alone, and those over the age

of 75 [10]. The UK Alzheimer’s Society data suggests
that 62% of people with dementia who live alone feel
lonely compared to 38% of all people with dementia
[11]. Such issues have been further exacerbated by the
recent COVID-19 pandemic, with disruption to in-
person events and accompanying social restrictions
[12].

Combatting social isolation in dementia is complex
given the progressive and variable nature of the condi-
tion. It can be difﬁcult for family and friends to know
what kind of support to provide and when. While
changes can occur quickly, people with dementia can
also become socially isolated very gradually: seeing
fewer people, leaving the house less frequently result-
ing in a loss of both independence and conﬁdence post
diagnosis [13]. Yet, it is understood that regular social
interaction (even 10 minutes a day) can make a dif-
ference to overall QoL [14] but at present, the route
to achieve equity in social connectedness remains
unclear. There are many plausible arguments that the
“digital age” could provide social beneﬁts [15], e.g.,
increasing social connectedness across geographi-
cal locations, but it is unclear whether people with
dementia are included as part of this narrative. For
instance, in a systematic review, Heins et al. [16]
showed that technology-based interventions may be
able to alleviate loneliness in older people without
cognitive decline, but few studies (n = 3) focused on
people with dementia. Further, there was no clear con-
clusion regarding the effectiveness of technological
interventions for people with dementia. Instead, this
study highlighted a knowledge gap around the acces-
sibility and implementation of these interventions for
people with dementia [16]. Another scoping review
identiﬁed a broad range of technological solutions
(n = 11) for people with Alzheimer’s disease [15].
However, the authors established that none of these
technologies were developed to support social con-
nection, rather, the majority (n = 8) were developed
for passively “monitoring” the person with dementia
without their direct involvement. Taken collectively,
a total absence of active input from people with
dementia is concerning when noting the principles of
Kitwood [4] (outlined above) around human rights,
which is further supported by the United Nations’
Decade of Healthy Ageing [6], and a right to be
respected as an individual beyond the disease itself.
Taken collectively, further work is required to
collate knowledge on digital technologies used for
social isolation and loneliness in dementia. There-
fore, we set out to undertake a systematic review to:
1) describe the current digital technologies to support

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

or prevent social isolation or loneliness in people
with dementia, 2) summate evidence surrounding the
effectiveness of these interventions, and 3) assess the
reported study quality alongside readiness for imple-
mentation.

all databases can be found in the supplementary
materials. The search was performed without date
or language restrictions. Duplicate articles were
excluded using EndNote x9.2 (Clarivatetm).

METHODS

Search strategy

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [17]. The protocol was registered in the
International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews under protocol number CRD42020191065
(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/191
065 STRATEGY 20201011.pdf). A comprehensive
search was performed in the bibliographic databases
CINAHL (via Ebsco), PubMed, Embase.com, APA
PsycInfo (via Ebsco), and Scopus from inception to
December 11, 2020 in collaboration with a medical
librarian. Search terms included controlled terms
(MeSH in PubMed, Emtree in Embase, CINAHL
Headings and Thesaurus terms in PsycInfo). The
following terms were used (including synonyms and
closely related words): “dementia” and “loneliness”
or “social
isolation” and “eHealth” or “technol-
ogy” (see Table 1). The full search strategies for

Screening

All study types were included in this system-
atic review to be inclusive of efforts that were
in an early stage of development. The title and
abstract of each study were screened using Rayyan
(https://www.rayyan.ai/): a specialist software tool
designed for performing systematic reviews. These
were reviewed by two independent reviewers accord-
ing to the pre-speciﬁed inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Systematic reviews of relevance were also inspected
for additional studies of interest, but studies were sub-
ject to the same inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies
were screened and categorized as one of the fol-
lowing: ‘included’, ‘excluded’, or ‘maybe’. Where
studies were classed as ‘maybe’, full texts were
obtained before a decision was made on inclusion
or exclusion. Disagreements were resolved through
further discussion on abstracts (DK and HR). Where
a decision could not be reached, the full text of the
article was reviewed in detail and/or consultation
with another team member took place to act as third
reviewer (AMP/KE). Therefore, the ﬁnal included list

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

was generated through at least two team members
independently conﬁrming inclusion.

Inclusion criteria

• Digital technologies deﬁned as an umbrella term
for computer-based products and solutions (e.g.,
mHealth, eHealth, apps, online interventions)
that are:

◦ developed for people with mild cognitive

impairment/dementia;

◦ designed for, or have a strong rationale
for hypothesized impact upon social isola-
tion/loneliness;

◦ stand-alone or integrated into other physical

materials (e.g., furniture, clothing);

◦ used by a person with dementia alone, or

with support from others;

• Any trial design providing that there is a measure

of social loneliness/isolation assessed;
• Studies published in English or Dutch.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded if they met any of the fol-

lowing criteria where digital technologies were:

◦ a non-critical component of a complex interven-
tion (e.g., the use of digital technology is not
essential in the overall design);

◦ developed for older populations only (e.g., not

dementia/cognitive impairment speciﬁc);

◦ used “around” the person with dementia (with-

out their direct involvement);

◦ telephone or face-to-face-based services.

Data extraction

Data were extracted into MS Excel to describe
studies in full (e.g., study design, population, inter-
vention). Study features (e.g., human and digital
elements) were thematically analyzed following
Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis [18] creat-
ing major themes across all identiﬁed studies. To
appraise individual study quality, we applied the
Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) in order to
assess the quality [19] instead of the Downs and Black
methodological quality checklist as stated in our orig-
inal systematic review protocol. MMAT allows for
the methodological appraisal of qualitative, quantita-
tive, and mixed method studies using a single tool
and provides a process to appraise using speciﬁc
checklist-based criteria for each study type. MMAT

was chosen as it allowed use of a single tool for all
of the included studies which followed a variety of
different study designs. Since it is discouraged to
calculate an overall score from the ratings of each
criterion [19], a description of the quality for each
study is described based on the number of criteria
met in each checklist. We also appraised the readiness
of implementation through collecting information on
the availability and accessibility of technologies. This
information was either provided as part of the study or
was searched for online via an online search engine.

RESULTS

Search results

Our search identiﬁed 7,167 individual studies
across ﬁve databases (see Fig. 1 for breakdown). After
removal of duplicates, 3,054 studies were eligible
for screening. Of these 2,976 were initially excluded,
leaving 78 studies assessed as full texts. Ultimately,
a total of ten studies were taken forward for analy-
sis. Analysis of related systematic reviews did not
yield any additional studies. Each study identiﬁed
described a single digital technology (see below).

Description of the digital technologies for social
isolation and loneliness

Of the ten digital technologies described: four
were categorized as humanoid and animal com-
panion robots (MARIO, NAO, Giraff, JustoCat)
[20–23], three were categorized as multi-sensory,
touch-screen technology (Active Cues Tovertafel,
Skype-on-Wheels, GeriJoy) [24–26], two were assis-
tive technology systems (Assistive Home Technology
(AHT) system, TV-AssistDem) [27, 28], and a single
technology was based on Virtual Reality (VR, Ocu-
lus Rift) [29]. These technologies differed in terms of
their purpose and delivery format, underlying theo-
retical models and psychological techniques, levels
of personalization, co-designing with people with
dementia, and accessibility and implementation as
described below.

Purpose and delivery format

Digital technologies were designed for a range
of different purposes, including: (i) providing com-
panionship and/or reminiscence using digital pets or
humanoid social robots (four studies) [20, 21, 23, 26];
(ii) improving communication and social connections

between family members or other residents (three
studies) [20, 22, 25]; (iii) improving engagement and
physical activity through multi-sensory stimulation
(two studies) [24, 29]; (iv) remote monitoring and
support to improve well-being (one study) [27]; (v)
providing support with assistive functions (one study)
[28]. In terms of delivery format interventions com-
prised of: (i) a combination of audio, video, and
pictures (ﬁve studies) [20, 22, 25–27]; (ii) immer-
sive audio-visual stimuli or projections (two studies)

[24, 29]; (iii) auditory feedback with physical move-
ments (two studies) [21, 23]; and one intervention
respectively for (iv) Live chat [27] and; (v) automated
delivery of assistive functions [28].

Theoretical underpinnings and psychological
techniques

Four out of ten studies described underpinning psy-
chological theories used. This included the Tovertafel

518

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

[24], JustoCat [23], NAO robot [21], and Skype-on-
Wheels [25]. Bruil et al. [24] combined elements
of multisensory stimulation and reminiscence ther-
apy within the Tovertafel, including the discussion
of memories and past experiences using prompts, in
its activities to improve QoL [24, 30]. Reminiscence
therapy also served as the framework for JustoCat:
Gustafsson et al. [23] stated that a robotic cat was
assumed to appeal to individuals’ memories of cats
[23]. The NAO robot is based on the participatory arts
model which requires the person with dementia to
actively engage in ‘creating’ art rather than ‘observ-
ing’ art which may lead to a positive impact on mood
and loneliness [21]. For Skype-on-Wheels, Zamir
et al. [25] refer to Porges’ social engagement and
attachment theory [31] which posits that face-to-face
interactions are crucial for good quality social inter-
actions and to sustain new and existing relationships
[25]. The researchers also emphasize the beneﬁts of
socialization in general on cognitive functioning, e.g.,
being able to remember conversations.

Personalization

All ten technologies included personalization at
least in part using human elements. This was achieved
through the involvement of: (i) professional staff (six
studies) [23–26, 28, 29], (ii) researchers (three stud-
ies) [20, 21, 27], and (iii) family carers (one study)
[22]. For instance, Bruil et al. [24] involved a pro-
fessional carer as part of the Tovertafel who guided
people with dementia through the activities and pro-
moted engagement with the content [24]. Similarly,
for Skype-on-Wheels, a professional carer facilitated
group quiz sessions by asking the questions and
moving the device towards participants [25] whereas
family members operated the Giraff robot remotely
[22].

In addition to personalization through human
involvement, six technologies included digital per-
sonalized approaches elements where all six tailored
content according to individual interests and needs
[23, 24, 26–29] although this was achieved in differ-
ent ways. Baker et al. [29] tailored the VR experiences
as part of the Oculus Rift based on individual feed-
back and interests and people using the technology
found these personalized experiences more interest-
ing than the existing selection. The range of activities
included in the Tovertafel were pitched to individ-
ual interests and abilities and thus, could be tailored
according to the stage of dementia as well [24].
Demiris et al. [26] incorporated personalized images

and videos as part of GeriJoy and the touch-screen app
[26]. TV-Assistdem was adapted to provide tailored
support during the COVID-19 pandemic depend-
ing on the individual’s country of residence [27].
People with dementia received a personalized intro-
duction to JustoCat from a professional carer which
also involved social interactions based on a common
memory (e.g., discussion on memories of having a
pet cat [23]). Lastly, the different features within the
AHT system could be personalized depending on the
individual’s need e.g. lighting in living areas or the
set-up of life circles designed to allow for residents to
access different areas in the home or across the care
center [28].

Co-designing with people with dementia

Two of the ten studies identiﬁed, stated that co-
design with people with dementia had taken place [22,
24], whereas eight studies did not state this [20, 21,
23, 25–29]. Where such information was available
(two studies) Bruil et al. [24] stated that Tovertafel
was developed in collaboration with people with
dementia. Similarly, Moyle et al. [22] highlighted
prototypes were iteratively improved through feed-
back from people with dementia as part of a separate
research project. However, neither of these studies
describe the speciﬁc impact or the point at which
people with dementia were able to make such con-
ideation, evaluation). Within the
tributions (e.g.,
studies, people with dementia were invited to engage
with the technology independently though staff were
available to provide assistance and support when
needed (six studies) [21, 23, 26–29]. The remaining
four studies involved group interactions as part of the
intervention either with other people with dementia
[24, 25] or with family and friends [20, 22].

Accessibility and implementation readiness

We appraised the accessibility of technologies ini-
tially across cost and whether they were readily
available. Five technologies are available for pur-
chase [21–25] with three having a product website
containing more information about the technology
[22–24]. Costs were described for two of these
(USD): the NAO robot is priced at $9,000 [21] and
the Giraff robot at $10,000 [22]. While the Oculus
Rift retails at $300 this does not include the neces-
sary hardware required (e.g., high-performance PC).
Additionally, it was unclear whether this could be
purchased with the relevant VR software preloaded

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

for people with dementia [29]. The Skype software
for Skype-on-Wheels is free to download but needed
additional materials at hand, e.g., a desk chair and
touch-screen tablet to create the Skype-on-Wheels
device [25]. As described previously, all digital tech-
nologies described within studies require human
supports at least to some extent and many have phys-
ical space requirements. While the MARIO robot
[20] and JustoCat [23] could be used independently
after an initial introduction, eight of ten technologies
(80%) required either a family member or profes-
sional carer to be trained in its use, provide assistance
with set up, and guide the intervention. Some tech-
nologies also required the involvement of engineers
for installation or trouble-shooting problems (e.g., the
AHT system) and adjustment to the environment can
also be required [20, 24, 25]. D’Onofrio et al. [20]
suggest that the MARIO robot should be used in a
quiet area to minimize distractions, Tovertafel [24]
requires a table big enough for at least six participants
and therefore a sizable room. Physical space was
also important for Skype-on-Wheels so that group
participants can navigate the device between them
[25]. Another consideration included a requirement
for access to the Internet which was explicitly stated
in three studies [22, 25, 26]. Lastly, the majority of
technologies (n = 8) identiﬁed [20–25, 28, 29] have
been evaluated in the care home or assisted living
environment.

Study characteristics

Population

Of the ten included studies, eight were single stud-
ies that took place in a single location with one group
of participants. The remainder [20, 28] involved
multiple study sites. All studies were conducted in
high-income country settings across a total of eight
countries including the UK (one study), the Nether-
lands (two studies), Australia (two studies), the USA
(two studies), Sweden (one study), Spain (one study),
and a single multinational study taking place across
the UK, Ireland, and Italy. All people with dementia
who took part in the studies were aged 65 or over,
where the most prevalent average age group were
individuals in their mid-80 s (ﬁve studies [21–24, 28])
and mid-70 s (three studies [20, 26, 27]). Baker, et al.
[29] reported an age range from 74 to 88 years, while
Zamir et al. [25] only report participants as being
older than 65 years. Eight out of ten studies also had
a majority of female participants (range 61–100%).

Five studies [21–24, 27] reported the stage of
dementia of participants where Goodman-Casanova
et al. [27] and Moyle et al. [22] focused on mild
dementia, Fields et al. [21] covered mild to moderate
dementia, Bruil et al [24] included moderate to severe
dementia, and Gustafsson et al. [23] included people
in the late stages of dementia. Two out of ten studies
reported the type of dementia where D’Onofrio et al.
[20] only included people with Alzheimer’s disease
and Lauriks et al. [28] reported over half of the partici-
pants being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The
study also included individuals with mixed dementia
or vascular dementia. Finally, three studies explored
the participant’s familiarity with technologies: where
Baker et al. [29] reported none of the participants
as being familiar with common technology such as
tablets or phones; Demiris et al. [26] reported 80% of
participants as being ‘somewhat or very comfortable’
using technology; and Fields et al. [21] reported a
majority of participants had no prior experience with
the technology used in the intervention.

Local settings

The majority of the studies took place at a resi-
dential care facility, nursing home or medical ward
[20–25, 28, 29] where two studies took place at the
home of a person with dementia [26, 27]. The only
study that required participants to travel away from
their home was the UK based participants of the study
by D’Onofrio et al. [20] where the workshop was con-
ducted at a testing venue as participants lived outside
the community. Participants based in Ireland and Italy
completed the intervention at home.

Quality of life and social connectedness
measures

All studies reported some improvement to partic-
ipant QoL and/or social connectedness as a result of
engaging with the technology. However, most studies
were small-scale in nature with eight out of ten stud-
ies having less than 40 participants (see Table 2 for
further details). QoL was recorded in all ten studies
with each of them reporting beneﬁts. Regarding the
measures, seven studies [20–24, 26, 28] implemented
existing tools to measure a range of metrics to deter-
mine a participant’s QoL. These include dementia
speciﬁc QoL measures (Discomfort scale-Dementia
of Alzheimer Type, quality of life in late-stage
dementia, Quality of Life for People with Demen-
tia, Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease, self-rated

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

Quality of Life domains) (four studies) as well as
measures of metrics including: depression (Cornell
Scale for Depression in Dementia, Geriatric Depres-
sion Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9) (three
studies); emotional responses (Comfort from Digital
Companion Animals Scale, the Face Scale, Observed
Emotion Rating Scale) (three studies); agitation
(Cohen-Mansﬁeld Agitation Inventory) (one study);
anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment)
(one study); loneliness (UCLA loneliness Scale) (one
study); sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep
Scale) (one study); and perception of social sup-
port (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
Support). Further details are available in Table 2.
The remaining three studies used their own meth-
ods of measuring QoL including: a custom ‘smiley
face emotion’ (emoji) chart to evaluate participants
intellectual,
responses [29]; measuring physical,
recreational, and social aspects [27]; during the
intervention or extracting the results using thematic
analysis [25]. Social connectedness measures were
also recorded in seven of the ten studies [21, 22,
24–26, 28, 29]. These studies reported improvements
to social inclusion and/or interaction (ﬁve studies)
[24–26, 28, 29] as well as the reduction of loneliness
and social isolation (four studies) [21–22, 25, 28].

Studies reported additional measures which may
have had an indirect effect on participants’ QoL or
social connectedness as a result of engaging with
the technology. These include potential improve-
ments to cognition and general stimulation [23, 26,
27, 29]; reductions in feelings of depression [21,
26]; improvements to behaviors were also reported
including improvements to participant’s resilience
[20] self-image [24], and positive emotions [22]; and,
reductions in problematic behaviors such as restless-
ness, agitation and tense behavior [23, 24]. One study
noted participants found relaxation, peace, and com-
fort as a result of the robot cat intervention [23], while
another study noted participants’ ‘appreciation’ and
enjoyment of the ‘aesthetics’ of assistive home tech-
nologies in addition to a signiﬁcant reduction of fall
incidents that could lead to injuries that would impact
QoL [28].

Study quality assessment

Following the MMAT procedures, studies were
assessed using the following checklists: mixed meth-
ods (four studies) [22, 23, 26, 27], non-randomized
studies checklist (three studies) [20, 21, 24], qualita-
tive studies (two studies) [25, 29] and the randomized

controlled trials checklist (one study) [28]. See the
Supplementary Material for further information. Two
of a possible ten studies (20%) met the full criteria and
were considered to have high methodological qual-
ity [25, 29]; four studies (40%) met the majority of
the criteria and had medium to high methodologi-
cal quality [20–23], and four studies (40%) met the
minority of the criteria suggesting medium to low
methodological quality [24, 26–28].

DISCUSSION

Here we set out to: 1) collate current knowledge on
digital technologies available to people with dementia
to support or prevent social isolation or loneliness, 2)
collate evidence surrounding their effectiveness, and
3) assess the reported study quality alongside readi-
ness for implementation. To our best knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst work of its kind and our results suggest
that there is a limited body of published work on
this topic—ten studies which varied in their study
characteristics such as the design and setting, and
in the types of technologies such as their purpose,
delivery format, and accessibility. All technologies
demonstrate some level of improvements on mea-
sures of QoL with a number of improvements across
outcomes regarding social inclusion, social isolation,
and loneliness. However, it remains challenging to
directly compare impacts because of the high level of
variation surrounding technology maturity, content,
and evaluation approaches. Moreover, there were
some concerns that limit the generalizability of posi-
tive ﬁndings presented. These include the general lack
of reported information on digital technologies in
terms of the theoretical underpinnings, the absence of
co-design with people with dementia, alongside bar-
riers to accessibility and implementation, e.g., many
studies require staff support. Technologies presented
here are clearly complex. Human elements form a
core part of delivery reﬂecting the work of Kitwood
and Bredin [4] who state that inter-personal relation-
ships and the presence of others are required to retain
personhood which is a human right. The technologies
used ranged from cutting edge/experimental (e.g.,
VR) to adaptation of well recognized solutions that
are already in reach of many (e.g., Skype). The most
common choice to support or prevent social isola-
tion or loneliness were different types of companion
robots including humanoid or animal robots and
robots that could connect people with dementia to
their own social networks. For instance, Demiris et

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

al. [26] developed a virtual pet companion accessi-
ble on a touch-screen tablet whereas, D’Onofrio et
al. [20] and Fields et al. [21] both developed phys-
ical robots which users could interact with directly
through speech, touch, and movement. While the
description of the technologies used were generally
clear, the majority of the studies did not state the
theory or established intervention underpinning the
developed technology however, four studies did high-
light different theories and models [21, 23–25]. For
example, there was reference to elements of reminis-
cence therapy [23, 24] that has a growing evidence
base around improving cognition, communication
and QoL of people with dementia [30]. Established
theories form a key part of the description and/or
rationale for complex interventions: ensuring these
are rooted within an existing evidence based remains
essential. Such a focus can help interventions to reach
higher levels of effectiveness, to improve utility for
user groups and to better understand under what opti-
mal circumstances these desired outcomes can be
achieved [32]. It is of note that technologies here
are often not focused on an individual component
of interaction design but instead focus on a range of
modalities such as voice, touch, time, and behavior
[33]. The variation and design choices emphasize a
need for detailed explanation of founding theories
as to not just “why” a complex intervention would
achieve desired beneﬁts, but also cements the “how”
technologies (and/or human elements) are supporting
optimal means to deliver it.

It is encouraging to see that the work of Kitwood
around personhood and personalization is repre-
sented in many studies; however, the reliance on in
person and face to face elements presents both chal-
lenges and opportunities for the ﬁeld. For example,
human based supports add personnel requirements
for implementation and upscaling. This may be par-
ticularly challenging where people with dementia
live alone/are in remote settings. All technologies
required another person to either make the introduc-
tion to the technology and/or guide the person with
dementia while using it which helped to offer tai-
lored information and care where needed but there
were also technologies that require technical support
or long-term involvement from professionals/carers
to deliver the use of the technologies. Some tech-
nologies went beyond this and offered personalized
elements within the developed technology itself [23,
24, 26–29]. Examples include content tailored to the
level of dementia or a wide range of activities to cater
to individual interests. However, a lack of reported

co-design activities is likely to limit accessibility.
An approach rooted in user-involvement is important
when considering the challenges of using digital tech-
nologies with dementia and cognitive impairment
[34].

In terms of effectiveness, one must be careful
to interpret ﬁndings with caution. The majority of
studies were small-scale where observational, quali-
tative, and quantitative methods were used to evaluate
the technology. Large-scale, evidence-based studies
to assess formal effectiveness were generally lack-
ing, with only one RCT included in this review
where there was no a priori power analysis [28].
Given that digital technologies are now widespread,
this is surprising, as there remains increasing scope
for large-scale observational studies; however, the
indication from published literature is that few
digital technology efforts are focusing on social
isolation or loneliness for people with dementia.
Despite such limitations, all studies demonstrated
some level of improvement on the QoL for peo-
ple with dementia following the use of a range of
technologies, e.g., companion robots, multi-sensory,
touch-screen technologies, and assistive technolo-
gies. More speciﬁcally, the majority also reported
beneﬁts in terms of social inclusion or social interac-
tion and the reduction of loneliness and isolation [21,
22, 24–26, 28, 29]. These ﬁndings were mostly linked
to technologies consisting of humanoid and animal
robots which facilitated social interactions with the
technology itself or with family members and friends.
Increased engagement in social interactions poten-
tially had an impact on reducing feelings of loneliness
and decreasing a sense of social isolation among peo-
ple with dementia. Although identifying such beneﬁts
is encouraging, it would be interesting to deﬁne the
impact on people with dementia in the longer term,
particularly outside of a formal study setting (i.e.,
demonstrate external validity). Other beneﬁts found
for the included technologies consisted of improve-
ments in cognitive functioning and mental stimula-
tion, [23, 26, 27, 29], resilience [20], self-image [24],
positive emotions [22], feelings of depression [21,
26], and agitation and restlessness [23, 24].

Previous related reviews in the ﬁeld have drawn
conclusions that align with the ﬁndings presented
here. For example, despite some positive ﬁndings,
researchers were unable to draw deﬁnite conclu-
sions in their systematic review investigating the
effectiveness of technological interventions for peo-
ple with dementia in terms of social participation due
to a lack of studies [16]. Another systematic review on

526

H.K. Rai et al. / Digital Technology for Loneliness in Dementia

information and communication (ICT) based appli-
cations designed to improve social health and social
participation in people with dementia, concluded
from their limited evidence that ICT-based interven-
tions have better potential than non-ICT interventions
to promote social behaviors [35].

There remain fundamental challenges around
accessibility and implementation surrounding digital
technologies for people with dementia. Existing tech-
nologies often have high costs and all technologies
included in this review have certain environmental
requirements—individually feasible but collectively
challenging—such as ﬁnding a quiet/peaceful space,
reliable internet connections, and human supports
(including technical skills). Thus, the digital divide
remains an ominous concern for living well with
dementia alongside a need to ensure that interventions
are safe for use [36]. There is a need to incorporate
more observational studies to understand how people
with dementia can thrive outside of long-term care
facilities—particularly those who live alone or who
are geographically isolated—a current knowledge
gap in academic literature. As societies worldwide
move to more data driven, and digital health and
social care approaches- we need to ensure that over-
looked groups such as people with dementia are
not left behind. Such systemic challenges are being
addressed in an increasing body of science focusing
on translational failure of concepts to implementa-
tion. An example is the non-adoption, abandonment,
scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework [37].
We need to ﬁnd ways to incentivize entrepreneurial
efforts that hold future value for sustainability and
implementation. Ideally, such work will include and
report on involvement of people with dementia at all
study stages and during the development of the tech-
nology [38]. In addition, observational work should
be undertaken to see how we may adapt existing tech-
nologies that are already in widespread use.

Strengths and limitations

While a main strength of this work is trans-
parency and rigor of our collaborative approach (e.g.,
PRISMA), there are also limitations to recognize.
For example, the deﬁnitions of technologies or living
alone can prove challenging. Throughout, our “lens”
was to take the viewpoint of a person with dementia
who spends time alone/lives alone and the practical-
ities of digital technologies around this, explaining
our heavy emphasis on co-design and implementa-

tion in wider settings. However, working with our
constructs of interest can be complex: for example,
there is no universally accepted deﬁnition of “social
isolation” and “loneliness”. Although we attempted
to be as inclusive as possible, a particularly promi-
nent example of a technology within our review was
PARO: a therapeutic robot seal. PARO has proven
to be a successful digital technology in many dif-
ferent settings offering a range of beneﬁts to people
with dementia (e.g., including increased conversa-
tion in facilitated sessions). However, we did not
ﬁnd studies meeting our inclusion criteria with out-
comes speciﬁcally on social isolation and loneliness
(e.g., we would have included such a study if there
were qualitative outcomes directly relating to a reduc-
tion in “social isolation”). Our emphasis a priori
remained primarily on the more subjective outcome
of social isolation/loneliness. This decision process
highlights a wider challenge in the ﬁeld of what is
the best/most suitable measure of reporting loneli-
ness in dementia, particularly over many weeks and
months as dementia progresses. Lastly, included stud-
ies were in English or Dutch only due to language
skills in the team. As with any systematic review it
is plausible that studies may have been missed in our
search or screening process. Nevertheless, our work
was designed to be as inclusive as possible and we
were able to describe technologies in detail, explore
the future readiness for implementation and appraise
the quality.

Study quality assessment using MMAT

We successfully appraised all included studies
using the MMAT but there were a number of lim-
itations. These included that the MMAT ‘screening
questions for all types’ are required for all studies
but are poorly deﬁned with little or no support doc-
umentation. Accordingly, ambiguity on deﬁnitions
of the MMAT criteria led to disagreement between
reviewers over how studies were classiﬁed and inter-
pretation remains difﬁcult given that the use of an
overall score is discouraged. It is for these reasons
that we would recommend that further research is
conducted into developing scales to appraise early
phase studies so that objective and clear guidance
can be used throughout.

to increase. Our review identiﬁes a limited body
of research with early indications of reductions in
isolation and loneliness for people with dementia.
However, data suggest that technology readiness
remains low, the costs are high, and many solutions
have a large dependency on human elements. Pro-
longed and widespread feelings of loneliness do not
ﬁt within a narrative of high-quality dementia care: it
is time to explore how to make people with dementia
the co-lead architects of digital technologies for
social interactions that are affordable, usable, and
inclusive for all.
