psychotic disorders

Background
Having a relapse of schizophrenia or recurrent psychosis is
feared by patients, can cause social and personal disruption and
has been suggested to cause long-term deterioration, possibly
because of a toxic biological process.

Aims

To assess whether relapse affected the social and clinical
outcomes of people enrolled in a 24-month randomised
controlled trial of antipsychotic medication dose reduction
versus maintenance treatment.

Methods
The trial involved participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
or recurrent, non-affective psychosis. Relapse was defined as
admission to hospital or significant deterioration (assessed by a
blinded end-point committee). We analysed the relationship
between relapse during the trial and social functioning, quality of
life, symptom scores (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale)
and rates of being in employment, education or training at 24-
month follow-up. We also analysed changes in these measures
during the trial among those who relapsed and those who did
not. Sensitivity analyses were conducted examining the effects
of ‘severe’ relapse (i.e. admission to hospital).

Results

During the course of the trial, 82 out of 253 participants relapsed.
There was no evidence for a difference between those who

relapsed and those who did not on changes in social functioning,
quality of life, symptom scores or overall employment rates
between baseline and 24-month follow-up. Those who relapsed
showed no change in their social functioning or quality of life,
and a slight improvement in symptoms compared to baseline.
They were more likely than those who did not relapse to have
had a change in their employment status (mostly moving out of
employment, education or training), although numbers changing
status were small. Sensitivity analyses showed the same results
for those who experienced a ‘severe’ relapse.

Conclusions
Our data provide little evidence that relapse has a detrimental
effect in the long term in people with schizophrenia and
recurrent psychosis.

Schizophrenia and related psychotic conditions affect 0.2–0.3% of
the global population1 and cause considerable disability.2 They have
a particularly detrimental
impact on social and occupational
functioning,3,4 which contributes to the high economic costs of the
conditions.5,6 There is significant heterogeneity in the trajectory of
the conditions, but for many it follows a relapsing–remitting course.
Relapses cause social and psychological disruption to patients’ lives
and are a substantial source of concern for patients.7 They place a
burden on caregivers8 and health services.9 It has also been
suggested that acute psychotic relapse may be associated with
biological harm10,11 that drives progression of the illness,12 and
reduces treatment responsiveness.13,14 For some commentators, the
relationship between relapse and prognosis is thought to occur
primarily during a ‘critical period’ early in the course of the
condition, during which there is a potentially reversible decline,
followed by a ‘plateau’.11,15 Others suggest the relationship between
relapse and prognosis is general and ongoing.12,14

Existing evidence

The evidence on whether relapse affects outcomes is mixed.
Clinically,
there is an association between relapse and poor
psychosocial outcomes and non-remission16,17 and some studies
have shown that people with a first episode of psychosis become less

responsive to antipsychotic treatment following relapse,18,19 but
these findings are potentially confounded by the underlying severity
of the illness. Most longitudinal studies find that symptoms revert
to pre-relapse levels20–22 and one study found few differences in
clinical and quality-of-life outcomes between individuals who
relapsed and those who did not over a 6-month period.23 However,
a 10-year follow-up of a placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotic
maintenance in people with a first episode of psychosis found that
relapse mediated a poorer long-term outcome in people originally
randomised to antipsychotic discontinuation.24 Whether relapse
impacts the outcomes of schizophrenia and related disorders, and if
so how, is highly relevant for patients and clinicians and is likely to
have an influence on decisions about
treatment, given that
maintenance antipsychotic treatment is associated with lower rates
of relapse.25,26 Further data are required, especially from robust
studies,
that address how relapse affects clinical and social
outcomes. The current study addresses the effects of relapse in a
cohort of people with long-term conditions.

antipsychotic treatment with supported antipsychotic reduction.
The present analysis treats participants recruited to the trial as a
single cohort. The aim was to compare the outcomes of participants
who relapsed and those who did not relapse during the course of the
trial. The outcomes we examined were social functioning, quality of
life, symptom scores and employment. We also assessed changes in
outcomes from baseline to final follow-up in participants who
relapsed and those who did not.

The trial, known as the RADAR (Research into Antipsychotic
Discontinuation and Reduction) trial was an open, parallel-group,
randomised trial that ran between 2017 and 2022. It compared the
outcomes of antipsychotic maintenance treatment with a gradual
and flexible reduction and discontinuation regimen. The primary
outcome was social functioning at the 24-month follow-up, while
secondary outcomes
included relapse, psychiatric symptoms,
quality of life, side effects and neuropsychological performance.

revised in 2013. All
procedures involving human participants/patients were approved
by Brent Research Ethics Committee (reference16/LO/1507). The
trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN90298520)
and with ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) (NCT0355
9426, http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03559426).

The trial methods have been described in detail elsewhere.27
Briefly, participants were aged 18 years and above and had a
diagnosis of recurrent non-affective psychotic disorder, for which
they were prescribed antipsychotic medication. The exclusion
criteria included an admission to a psychiatric hospital or a mental
health crisis within the preceding month, being mandated to take
their medication through the Mental Health Act and being
considered to pose a serious risk to themselves or others by their
treating clinicians. Written, informed consent was obtained from all
participants, who were then randomised to receive either
maintenance antipsychotic treatment or an individualised dose
reduction regimen, administered with the guidance of their treating
clinician.

Research assessments were conducted at 6, 12 and 24 months.
Relapse was defined either as admission to hospital or as a psychotic
episode involving significant functional deterioration as adjudi-
cated by a blinded, expert, end-point committee. The committee
applied pre-defined criteria on the basis of information from
clinical records, which was redacted for information that might
reveal a participant’s randomised group.

A statistical analysis plan for the current analysis was developed
before the analysis. We aimed to explore whether having a relapse
during follow-up affected 24-month measures of
the Social
Functioning Scale (SFS),28 the Manchester Short Assessment of
Quality of Life (MANSA),29 the total score on the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (sum of the subscales)30 and
employment
status, categorised as being or not being in
employment, education or training.

We combined severe and non-severe relapses for the purposes
of this analysis, since we were confident our assessment procedure
only identified significant relapse episodes and not minor symptom
fluctuations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the
effects of ‘severe’ relapse (defined as admission to hospital) versus
having a non-severe or no relapse to explore the consequences of
having a severe relapse compared to not having one. For all
analyses, we combined data from both randomised groups, and
adjusted for randomised group in the adjusted analysis.

674

Analyses were conducted using linear regression with robust
standard errors for the continuous outcomes and logistic regression
with robust standard errors for employment status. Robust
standard errors were used because of the potential clustering of
data by site. Initially, an analysis was conducted adjusting only for
baseline values. The analysis was repeated, adjusting for age and
gender in addition to these variables, and then again adjusting
additionally for demographic and clinical variables that varied
between people who relapsed and those who did not (using an a
priori threshold of P < 0.1) and might credibly have been associated
with relapse and outcomes. Since the literature suggests there are no
reliably consistent predictors of relapse,31,32 we did not adjust for
other variables. The distribution of PANSS scores was slightly
skewed, so a further sensitivity analysis was performed using the
log-transformed PANSS score. A sensitivity analysis using change
scores as the dependent variable was also performed.

To explore whether the participants who experienced a relapse
returned to baseline levels of
functioning, quality of life and
symptoms, we performed paired t-tests to compare 24-month
values of outcome measures to baseline values. We repeated this
analysis for those participants who did not relapse, for comparison
purposes. We also compared changes in employment, education
and training status between those who relapsed and those who
did not.

Results

Two hundred and fifty-three participants were recruited and
randomised into the RADAR trial and 190 participants completed
the research assessments at 24-month follow-up. The majority of
participants were male, White, single and unemployed. Most had
been in contact with mental health services for more than 10 years,
with about a third for over 20 years (Table 1).

The proportion of participants who completed the SFS at
follow-up was slightly lower among those who had relapsed (67.1%)
than those who had not relapsed (74.5%). For the MANSA, the
proportions were 64.6% for those who had relapsed versus 71.4%
for those who had not and, for the PANSS, the proportions were
42.7 and 44.4%, respectively. Employment, education and training
status was available for 70.7% of the participants who had relapsed
and 77.2% of those who had not. None of these differences were
statistically significant (see Supplementary Table S1, available at
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2024.304).

The results of

Altogether, 82 participants had at least one relapse of any severity
while 171 did not experience any relapse. There were few
differences between those who relapsed and those who did not
on demographic or clinical variables at baseline. The participants
who relapsed were more likely to have been randomised to the
antipsychotic dose reduction group (Table 1) and to be married or
in a long-term partnership. There was no evidence of any
differences in social functioning, quality of life or symptoms.

non-severe or no relapse (Supplementary Table S2). Using a log-
transformed PANSS variable (which reduced skewness) did not
alter the results (Supplementary Table S3). The sensitivity analysis
of change scores produced very similar results (Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5).

Among those who had relapsed, the paired analysis comparing
individuals’ 24-month outcome measures with their baseline scores
showed no change in the SFS or the MANSA (Table 3). Symptom
scores were slightly improved at follow-up in those who had
relapsed as well as those who had not. Participants who had not
relapsed showed a small decline in social functioning and a small
improvement in quality-of-life scores at 24 months, compared with
baseline (Table 3). The results were similar using the ‘severe’ relapse
definition, with no statistically significant deteriorations in any
measures among those who had relapsed and slight improvements
in symptom scores (Supplementary Table S6).

The proportion of participants who moved out of employment,
education or training during the 24 months of the trial was higher
among those who relapsed than in those who did not relapse, and
so was the proportion who moved into employment, education or
training. The overall difference in changes in employment status
between those who relapsed and those who did not was statistically
significant, although the numbers changing status were small
(Table 4). The results were similar for those participants who had a
severe relapse (Supplementary Table S7).

Discussion

The notion that a relapse of schizophrenia or other psychotic illness
may adversely affect the subsequent course of the condition has
been a prevalent one. It has contributed to the rationale for relapse
prevention through the use of maintenance antipsychotic medica-
tion,12,14,34 and may have been a disincentive to supporting patients
to discontinue antipsychotic medication.14 It
is an important
clinical issue that is likely to affect both patients’ and clinicians’

attitudes to long-term treatment. Although some research indicates
an association between frequent relapse and poorer outcomes,16
this cannot be assumed to be a causal connection as both may be
manifestations of a more severe condition with a worse prognosis.
Our findings provide little support for the view that relapse
results in adverse outcomes, at least among people with long-term
conditions, which comprised most of our sample. There was no
statistical evidence that social functioning, quality of life and
symptoms declined by 24-month follow-up in the participants who
relapsed compared with those who did not. Employment rates were
lower among those who relapsed at follow-up compared to those
who did not relapse, but they were also lower at baseline and there
was no evidence of a difference in the baseline-adjusted comparison
for rates of employment at follow-up. However, the analysis may
have lacked power. While relapse was more common in those people
randomised to antipsychotic dose reduction and those who were
married, adjusting for these factors did not affect the results. Also,
restricting the definition of relapse to those who had a severe relapse
only (i.e. were admitted to hospital) did not change the results.

Those participants who relapsed showed no decline in their
level of functioning, quality of life or symptoms at follow-up
compared with their baseline status. This compares with a slight
decline in social functioning scores in the participants who did not
relapse and a small improvement in quality of life, although the
changes were small, and their clinical significance is uncertain.
Symptom scores improved across both groups, but completion
rates were lower for the PANSS, and this likely reflects selective
completion of this long questionnaire by people who had milder
symptoms.
there was a statistically significant
difference in changes in employment status between those who
relapsed and those who did not. This principally reflected a larger
proportion of people who relapsed moving out of employment,
education or training during the course of the trial, although the
proportion who moved into employment was also higher and
numbers changing employment status in any direction were small.
However, this finding may indicate that our analysis of overall
employment rates was under-powered to detect a difference.

In contrast,

Our findings are in line with data derived from several other
clinical trials in this area. For example, one study found that
exacerbations of symptoms in people with established schizophre-
nia who had been randomised to placebo treatment during trials
returned to normal within a few weeks,22 while another reported
that patients who had relapsed rapidly responded to the
reinstatement of antipsychotic medication.21 A long-term follow-
up of patients from a small placebo-controlled trial of depot
fluphenazine found that patients who had been randomised to
placebo did not have worse outcomes after 7 years, despite having
been considerably more likely to relapse.20 An 8-month follow-up
of participants with schizophrenia who relapsed while assigned to
placebo during the course of a placebo-controlled trial of
paliperidone found that symptoms returned to baseline levels

676

and were not different from those who had received continuous
antipsychotic medication.35 This study also found that a small
group of people showed a poor response to treatment reinstate-
ment, which may indicate that relapse can lead to a poorer response
to medication in some people with schizophrenia. This is also
suggested by the results of a first-episode follow-up study19 and a
national register-based cohort study.18 However, these studies are
likely to be confounded by the severity of the underlying illness that
is manifested in both relapse and poor prognosis and associated
with non-adherence with medication, as shown across medicine.36
The findings of a 10-year follow-up of a randomised trial also
suggested that relapse could modify outcomes.24 This study has
been influential in supporting the view that relapse may worsen
prognosis34 but was subject to several limitations, including the use
of a post hoc composite outcome and inclusion of data from
participants who dropped out early who were not followed up long
term.37 Further, no differences were found in individual outcomes
at follow-up, such as measures of symptoms, functioning and
quality of life, between those randomised to placebo substitution
and those randomised to maintenance in the randomised trial,
despite a higher rate of relapse among the former.

It remains possible that relapse is detrimental to prognosis early
on in the course of the condition specifically, as suggested by the
‘critical periods’ hypothesis.15 Since our study mostly involved
people with long-term conditions, its results may not be consistent
with studies that have assessed the consequences of relapse in
people with a first episode. It should also be borne in mind that the
evidence for a lack of adverse consequences for an episode of
psychotic exacerbation largely derives from studies, such as ours,
where relapse was generally treated by continuation or reinstate-
ment of antipsychotic medication.

If relapse does have a lasting impact, it remains unclear what
the mechanism might consist of. Although a pathological biological
process has been proposed, our findings highlight
the
mechanism might also be social, such as through the disruption
caused by the loss of employment.

Strengths and limitations

Our data were derived from a relatively large, randomised trial
episodes of psychosis or
involving people with recurrent
schizophrenia. Since our analysis was planned and conducted after
the main trial was designed, we did not conduct formal power
calculations for it. However, confidence intervals for the SFS were
fairly narrow and excluded a difference of 4 points, which was the
clinically meaningful difference used in the power calculation of the
original trial.27 The confidence interval for the difference in PANSS
scores was well below the 10–15 points found to correspond to a
minimum level of change on the Clinical Global Impressions
scale.38 For employment, education and training, however, the

systematic manner. Although the present analysis was not a
randomised comparison, confounding by severity may be less
likely in a trial cohort compared with naturalistic follow-up
studies, for various reasons. These include the exclusion of people
with the most unstable trajectories and poor prognoses from trial
cohorts, and that stopping medication in a planned way in a trial is
different from non-adherence or unplanned discontinuation of
medication in a naturalistic setting. The latter is likely to be
associated with a poor underlying prognosis,36 and hence may be
more likely to be associated with relapse.33 It is possible that such

The association between relapse and the outcome of schizophrenia

factors can explain the discrepancy between the results derived
from trial cohorts, in which people mostly improve following
relapse, at least in the short term, and the findings of naturalistic
cohorts or database studies.

There was a loss to follow-up for several assessment measures.
For example, between a third and a quarter of the original sample
did not complete the primary outcome measure (the SFS) at
follow-up. Non-completion was higher for the PANSS since it is a
long questionnaire, and hence the improvement in PANSS scores
during follow-up that was observed across the participants who had
relapsed and those who had not may be partly explained by the
selective non-completion by those who were more symptomatic at
follow-up. However, there was little difference between the rates of
completion for those who had relapsed compared with those who
had not. Further, many of our follow-up data were collected during
the COVID-19 pandemic, and since social activities were restricted
by lockdown measures there may have been a ceiling effect on social
functioning scores for some participants.

Implications for research

Future studies should explore different outcomes to investigate
whether particular aspects of social and psychological functioning
might be affected by relapse. Adequately powered studies need to be
done to confirm whether relapse has a detrimental effect on
employment. The mechanisms by which any negative outcomes
occur also require further evaluation.

Implications for practice

Whether relapse leads to a worse prognosis is important information
for patients and clinicians. There are many reasons to try to avoid
relapse, such as the individual distress it can cause and the disruption
to personal and social lives, and our analysis indicates there may be
an impact on employment for some people.12,34 However, our results
suggest that maintenance antipsychotic treatment cannot be justified
by the notion that it averts a progressive deterioration in clinical
status or social functioning associated with relapse, at least in people
with long-term conditions. While avoiding relapse is, nevertheless, a
priority for many people,39,40 some may opt to accept an increased
risk of relapse to reduce the adverse effects and health consequences
of long-term antipsychotic treatment. Our data suggest that if people
make this choice and then relapse as a consequence, they will
subsequently return to their previous level of functioning, although
for most people this is likely to involve restarting antipsychotic
treatment. However, the psychosocial disruption associated with a
relapse, including possible interruption of employment, also needs to
inform any such decision.

Overall, our data do not support the notion that a relapse is
associated with persistent deterioration in people who have already
experienced psychosis or schizophrenia for several years, although
employment status may be affected. This information can help to
support informed decision-making about the use of long-term
antipsychotic treatment, given the risks of relapse associated with
reducing and discontinuing such medication.
