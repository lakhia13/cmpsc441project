Abstract

Multiple disorders once jointly conceived as ‘nervous diseases’ became segregated by the distinct 
institutional traditions forged in neurology and psychiatry. As a result, each field specialized 
in the study and treatment of a subset of such conditions. Here we propose new avenues for 
interdisciplinary interaction through a triangulation of both fields with social neuroscience. To this 
end, we review evidence from five relevant domains (facial emotion recognition, empathy, theory 
of mind, moral cognition, social context assessment), highlighting their common disturbances 
across neurological and psychiatric conditions and discussing their multiple pathophysiological 
mechanisms. Our proposal is anchored in multidimensional evidence, including behavioral, 
neurocognitive, and genetic findings. From a clinical perspective, this work paves the way for 
dimensional and transdiagnostic approaches, new pharmacological treatments, and educational

ON THE ORIGINS OF NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY

Currently, neurology and psychiatry represent two distinct disciplines with different clinical 
specializations, research methodologies, and institutional frameworks. Mr. Gambale loses 
his memory after a head blow, and he is swiftly taken to the neurologist. Instead, if 
Mr. Holdsworth believes he is dead, he is referred to a psychiatrist. However, had these 
patients lived 200 years ago, both their conditions would have been treated as nervous 
diseases (Price, Adams, & Coyle, 2000; Reynolds, 1990). Indeed, multiple cognitive 
and behavioral domains become similarly compromised in neurological and psychiatric 
disorders. Social cognition impairments are prime examples of these commonalities (Ibanez, 
Kuljis, Matallana, & Manes, 2014). Nevertheless, while both neurology and psychiatry have 
established fruitful dialogue with neuroscientific research, no systematic triangulation with 
social neuroscience has yet been formulated to address social cognition disturbances from 
a dimensional, transdiagnostic approach. In this paper, we delineate a triangulation among 
neurology, psychiatry, and social neuroscience. Specifically, we review massive evidence of 
shared social cognition impairments across neurologic and psychiatric diseases, and sketch a 
prospective framework to foster more synergistic research and education beyond disciplinary 
specializations.

To understand why this triangulation has not yet crystallized, we must trace the historical 
roots of neurology and psychiatry. In the early and mid-nineteenth century, Gall and 
Spurzheim, followed by Broca and Wernicke, pioneered the scientific study of complex 
pathological behaviors in connection to the brain (Price et al., 2000). Both before and after 
such contributions, leading scholars (e.g., Charcot, Freud, Kraepelin, Bleuler, Alzheimer, 
Parkinson) favored a joint approach to neurological and psychiatric disorders (Martin, 
2002). Admittedly, methodological differences already existed between neurologists and 
psychiatrists. While the former correlated brain syndromes with neuropathological changes 
via postmortem and microscopic techniques, the latter relied on analytical descriptions 
of behavior and symptoms. Yet, their analyses pursued the same goal: characterizing the 
structure and function of the nervous system (Cowan, Harter, & Kandel, 2000).

Throughout the twentieth century, however, neurologists and psychiatrists began to forge 
different approaches to disorders of the nervous system, with separate philosophical 
rationales, research principles, and treatment methods (Martin, 2002). In the post-war 
Anglo-Saxon and American contexts, the field was marked by a theoretical and practical 
divide: neurologists studied organic brain dysfunctions, searching for anatomic causes 
of ‘neurological diseases’; instead, psychiatrists, influenced by Freudian theories, were

interested in functional alterations of the mind and their ‘psychodynamic causes’. This 
was particularly reinforced since the 1930s. Relying on pioneering brain measurement 
techniques (such as electroencephalography) which offered objective, consistent, and 
reproducible findings, neurologists agreed on important definitions and criteria (Price et 
al., 2000). However, several disorders lacked visible pathological markers. These became 
the focus of psychiatrists, who favored symptom descriptions over laboratory tests. The 
opposition between both communities was reflected in their training requirements and 
geographical distributions. The prestigious Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, for 
instance, was quickly dissolved into two journals with separate agendas: JAMA Neurology 
and JAMA Psychiatry.

Such initial separation has had unfortunate consequences. In particular, the consolidation 
of different theories, research projects, training methods, and clinical assessment models 
has hindered the construal of synergistic neuropsychiatric knowledge (Northoff, 2008; Price 
et al., 2000). The complex field of neuropsychiatry partly bridged such a gap, framing 
structural and functional aspects as complementary across neurological and psychiatric 
diseases (Northoff, 2008). Similarly, neuroscientists largely agree on the conceptual futility 
of strict separations between both disciplines (Martin, 2002). However, integration efforts so 
far have been only partially successful, at best. We propose that this endeavor could witness 
major breakthroughs if specific knowledge from both fields is triangulated with multilevel 
insights from social neuroscience.

Despite general positive beliefs about the role of cognitive neuroscience as a bridge between 
neurology and psychiatry (Northoff, 2008; Price et al., 2000), such a threefold interaction 
has rarely taken place in the social neuroscience arena. To a large extent, this is due 
to the scarcity of dimensional and transnosological research and practice within social 
neuroscience. For instance, there are virtually no empirical reports of social cognition 
domains which directly compare neurological and psychiatric conditions. Even in some 
syndromes secondary to both types of diseases (e.g., Capgrass syndrome), direct contrasts 
of social cognition skills (e.g., facial expression recognition) remain unattempted, which 
precludes comparisons between different pathophysiological mechanisms for the same 
socio-cognitive domain. Similarly, explanatory models of social cognition impairments 
rooted in neurology (e.g., (Dickerson, 2015) or psychiatry (e.g., (Fett, Shergill, & 
Krabbendam, 2015))) have largely overlooked evidence from the other discipline. 
In addtion, virtually no academic programs and funding sources aim to apply the 
knowledge of social neuroscience to neurological and psychiatric disorders featuring similar 
impairments. Finally, given that neuroscience has traditionally ignored contributions from 
social neuroscience (Nature Neuroscience editorial, 2012), the latter’s interaction with 
neuropsychiatry has been delayed.

A neuropsychiatric approach, moving towards a systematic triangulation of social 
neuroscience with neurology and psychiatry, could provide a synergistic arena for clinical 
and research developments. Here we focus on the empirical, methodological, and conceptual 
contributions that could be derived directly from social neuroscience in the pursuit of 
such an aim. An emerging agenda is reframing psychiatric diseases as disorders of social 
cognition (Schilbach, 2016; Schilbach et al., 2013). Extending these claims, below we

sketch a social neuroscience approach to various dimensions of neurological and psychiatric 
disorders (Baez, Garcia, & Ibanez, 2016, Ibanez & Manes, 2012).

The paper is organized as follows. First, we characterize the tenets of social neuroscience. 
Second, we describe behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (Piguet, 
Hornberger, Mioshi, & Hodges, 2011) as a prototypical model to map the clinical 
and biological overlaps between several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Third, 
we selectively review key domains of social neuroscience, highlighting their common 
disturbances in bvFTD and other conditions. We focus on facial emotion recognition 
(FER), empathy, theory of mind (ToM), moral cognition, and ecological assessment 
of social context. Fourth, we discuss the prospects of this triangulation, showing how 
multilevel network-based approaches within social neuroscience can open new opportunities 
for development. Then, we sketch avenues of interaction between social neuroscience 
and neuropsychiatry, including theoretical, diagnostic, and pharmacological considerations. 
Finally, we identify novel challenges for this synergistic framework.

SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE: A TOOLKIT FOR TRIANGULATION

Experimental approaches within cognitive neuroscience –ranging from animal models 
to behavioral and imaging studies with humans– shed light on cognitive (dys)functions 
in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite the shortcomings mentioned above, 
this joint approach, in itself, reduces the discontinuity between constructs in each 
discipline (Cowan et al., 2000). More particularly, the subfield of social neuroscience 
studies the biological underpinnings of social processes, as shaped by contextual factors. 
Psychosocial mechanisms are conceived as multidimensional phenomena, including social 
behavior (observable interactions between people), social cognition (psychological processes 
underling social behavior), socially-driven neural activity (brain structures and networks 
subserving social processes), and social functioning (the ability to interact with others 
in time and space) (Daniel P Kennedy & Ralph Adolphs, 2012). More generally, 
social neuroscience addresses the normal and pathological interplay among environment, 
performance, cognition, neural substrates, and genetics (Ibanez, Kotz, Barrett, Moll, & Ruz, 
2014).

The social cognition network is so widespread (Kennedy & Adolphs, 2012) that it proves 
vulnerable to varied neurological and psychiatric diseases. Given the omnidirectional 
relationship among the above dimensions, a disturbance in any of them could compromise 
relevant neural circuits even in the absence of primary (neurocognitive) social deficits. Yet, 
that very feature suggests multiple alternatives to foster recovery, capitalizing on spared 
components of the network. Through its sensitive experimental methods, social neuroscience 
sheds light on the anatomy, function, and plasticity of such complex circuitry, regardless of 
the underlying diagnosis.

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia: A key model for disciplinary triangulation

The shortcomings of the neurology/psychiatry divide are evident in bvFTD (Ibanez, 
Kuljis, et al., 2014). This neurodegenerative condition is characterized by frontal, insular, 
and temporal atrophy, although such damage may not be evident on structural brain

imaging early on (Rahman, Sahakian, Hodges, Rogers, & Robbins, 1999; Rascovsky 
et al., 2011). Initial manifestations involve pervasive changes in personality and social 
behavior (e.g., disinhibition, compulsivity, depression, impulsivity, inappropriate conduct), 
even before cognitive alterations are observed (Piguet et al., 2011; Santamaria-Garcia et 
al., 2016). Clinical criteria for early bvFTD (Manes et al., 2010) are sometimes met 
by atypical presentations of bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder, attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia (SZ), and borderline personality 
disorder (BPD). Thus, it is often difficult to ascertain bvFTD as the underlying clinical 
entity (Barutta, Hodges, Ibanez, Gleichgerrcht, & Manes, 2011; Manes, 2012). Indeed, in 
approximately half of bvFTD patients, behavioral and attitudinal changes are ignored or 
attributed to a primary psychiatric disorder (Woolley, Khan, Murthy, Miller, & Rankin, 
2011). Specifically, social cognition deficits, typified by contextual inappropriateness 
(Baez, García, & Ibanez, 2016; Ibanez & Manes, 2012), may be overlooked before 
they become severe, especially because such variable is rarely quantified in structured 
clinical (Gleichgerrcht, Ibanez, Roca, Torralva, & Manes, 2010) and neuropsychological 
(Torralva, Roca, Gleichgerrcht, Bekinschtein, & Manes, 2009) examination. In sum, as 
further shown below, bvFTD is a multidimensional condition whose comprehensive study 
requires integrating socially relevant insights from neurology and psychiatry (Ibanez, Kuljis, 
et al., 2014).

A DIMENSIONAL AND TRANSNOSOLOGICAL COMPARISON OF SOCIAL 

COGNITION DOMAINS

A key step towards the triangulation we advocate consists in reviewing extant evidence 
from social neuroscience with a dimensional and transnosological perspective (Association, 
2000; Kendler, 1990). A dimensional approach frames psychopathological processes as 
continua between normal and pathological extremes. Similarly, social cognition deficits 
in a specific domain (e.g., social decision making) can be present not only as a 
dimensional disturbance across patients, but also across subdomains (e.g., regarding 
fairness, bargaining, risk, or other relevant variables). Besides, a transnosological conception 
acknowledges that specific mental and social faculties can be similarly compromised 
across disease types (Hyman, 2007; Insel & Quirion, 2005; Jablensky, 2005; McGorry 
& van Os, 2013). Although the transnosological approach has been mostly restricted to 
the psychiatric field, it can be extended across psychiatric and neurological disorders. 
These dimensional and transnosological viewpoints concern not only clinical, but also 
anatomical, neurophyisological, molecular, and genetic dimensions. The study of social 
cognition impairments profitably lends itself to both approaches, since such deficits can 
vary in frequency and intensity across a vast array of neurological and psychiatric diseases. 
Below we deploy this framework through a review of five distinguishable though interrelated 
domains.

Facial emotion recognition

FER is crucial for social interactions, as it allows people to infer what others are feeling 
and act accordingly (Adolphs, 2002; Atkinson & Adolphs, 2011; Rutishauser, Mamelak, 
& Adolphs, 2015). It involves multiple sub-processes and engages networks distributed

along the fusiform gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC), and the basal ganglia (Adolphs, 2002; Adolphs, Tranel, & Damasio, 2003; 
Allison, Puce, Spencer, & McCarthy, 1999). Facial, emotional and contextual integration of 
information occurs early in the brain (Ibáñez et al., 2010; 2011). FER deficits hamper social 
communication and induce changes in personality and behavior. They are more severe in 
bvFTD (Kumfor et al., 2011; Kumfor & Piguet, 2013; Lavenu & Pasquier, 2005; Werner et 
al., 2007) (and other subtypes of FTD) than in other dementias, even controlling for disease 
severity (Bertoux, de Souza, et al., 2014; Fernandez-Duque & Black, 2005; Kumfor & 
Piguet, 2013). Crucially, in this condition, they are not explained by other cognitive deficits 
(Kumfor et al., 2011; L. A. Miller et al., 2012) and seems to impact the implicit awareness 
of its dysfunction (Ibanez, Velasquez, Caro, & Manes, 2013).

FER impairments in bvFTD are associated with atrophy in the amygdala, the insula, 
the OFC, and the medial prefrontal cortices (Bertoux et al., 2012; Kipps, Nestor, Acosta-
Cabronero, Arnold, & Hodges, 2009; Omar, Rohrer, Hailstone, & Warren, 2011; Rosen et 
al., 2002). More particularly, impaired recognition of negative emotions, such as disgust and 
fear, has been associated with damage to the left insula and the right amygdala, respectively 
(Kumfor, Irish, Hodges, & Piguet, 2013). Thus, the regions supporting FER overlap with 
those compromised in bvFTD.

This skill is disturbed in other neurodegenerative conditions. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 
for example, FER decreases with the progression of dementia (Kumfor & Piguet, 2013; 
Lavenu & Pasquier, 2005), particularly in the domain of negative emotions (Phillips, 
Scott, Henry, Mowat, & Bell, 2010; Rosen et al., 2006). Such an impairment is only 
partially influenced by other cognitive deficits (Klein-Koerkamp, Beaudoin, Baciu, & Hot, 
2012). In fact, varied emotional domains are compromised in AD, suggesting a global 
emotional disturbance (Braak & Braak, 1991; Bruen, McGeown, Shanks, & Venneri, 2008; 
Horinek, Varjassyova, & Hort, 2007). FER deficits are also common in other neurological 
disorders, with varying degrees of intensity. These include corticobasal syndrome (Kumfor 
et al., 2014), prosopagnosia (De Renzi, 1986; T. T. Liu & Behrmann, 2014), progressive 
supranuclear palsy (Kumfor & Piguet, 2013), Huntington’s disease (HD)(Feuerriegel, 
Churches, Hofmann, & Keage, 2014; Kumfor & Piguet, 2013; Novak et al., 2012), multiple 
sclerosis (MS, Henry et al., 2011; Mike et al., 2013), neuromyelitis optica (Cardona et al., 
2014), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)(Crespi et al., 2014), mild cognitive impairment 
(Varjassyova et al., 2013), epilepsy (Gomez-Ibanez, Urrestarazu, & Viteri, 2014; Jiang et 
al., 2014), Cockayne syndrome (Baez, Couto, et al., 2013), stroke (Falquez et al., 2014; 
Yuvaraj, Murugappan, Norlinah, Sundaraj, & Khairiyah, 2013), Rett syndrome (Djukic, 
Rose, Jankowski, & Feldman, 2014), posterior cortical atrophy (M. L. Gonzalez-Gadea, A. 
Ibanez, et al., 2014), and genetic disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome (Key, Jones, & 
Dykens, 2013) and Klinefelter syndrome (van Rijn, Swaab, Aleman, & Kahn, 2006) (see 
Table 1).

FER impairments are also present in most psychiatric conditions, including BD (Ibanez, 
Urquina, et al., 2012), BPD (Baez, Marengo, et al., 2014), major depressive disorder 
(Schepman, Taylor, Collishaw, & Fombonne, 2012), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 
(Kang, Namkoong, Yoo, Jhung, & Kim, 2012), body dysmorphic disorder (Buhlmann,

adolescents under social deprivation (Escobar et al., 2013), ex-combatants (Tobón et al., 
2014), and anorexia (Fonville, Giampietro, Surguladze, Williams, & Tchanturia, 2014) (see 
Table 1). In particular, they are pervasive in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Aoki, Cortese, 
& Tansella, 2014; Dawson, Webb, & McPartland, 2005; Feuerriegel et al., 2014; Sachse et 
al., 2014). Electrophysiological evidence shows that early (decoding) and late (integration) 
face-processing disruptions in autistic individuals may occur since age three and persist into 
adulthood (Dawson et al., 2005). Similar deficits have been reported in SZ (Baez, Herrera, et 
al., 2013; Fujiwara, Yassin, & Murai, 2014; Kohler et al., 2008; Linden et al., 2010; Ventura, 
Wood, Jimenez, & Hellemann, 2013), with reduced modulation of face-specific ERPs being 
evident even in first-degree relatives (Feuerriegel et al., 2014; Ibanez, Riveros, et al., 2012; 
McCleery et al., 2014; Turetsky et al., 2007). Responses to facial emotional stimuli in SZ 
are also associated with decreased activation of the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala (Habel 
et al., 2010; Paradiso et al., 2003). The N170 to emotional faces is also impaired in ADHD 
(Ibanez et al., 2011). Notably, FER deficits are marked in Capgras syndrome (the delusion 
that a friend or relative has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor), which may be 
present in neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as Lewy body dementia (Fiacconi et 
al., 2014) and paranoid SZ (Ellis et al., 1993; Ellis, Young, Quayle, & De Pauw, 1997), 
respectively. Moreover, relatively similar affectation of early brain markers of FER are 
observed across psychiatric conditions (Ibanez, Aguado, et al., 2014).

FER dysfunctions are ubiquitously observed across neurological and psychiatric conditions 
(Table 1). Across individuals and patient groups, dimensional differences are observed 
in various stimulus-related (arousal, valence, types of emotions) and performance-related 
(accuracy, reaction times) variables. Similarly, imaging results show different degrees 
of damage in relevant neural hubs (fusiform, amygdala, insula), while electromagnetic 
techniques evidence alterations in either early or late brain dynamics (Ibanez, Melloni, et 
al., 2012). These dimensional differences are transnosologically observed within and across 
neurological and psychiatric diseases. Also, the deficits in question may involve similar 
(e.g., N170 amplitude/latency alterations) as well as differential (neurodegeneration, focal 
lesions, aberrant connectivity) mechanisms. No empirical comparisons of these dimensions 
are available across conditions and related neural mechanisms, reducing the chances of 
developing multilevel models addressing different outcomes. Moreover, little is known 
about how similar FER deficits impacts everyday behaviors across conditions. Thus, future 
research is required to integrate behavioral and cerebral measures of FER with clinical 
associations across diseases.

Empathy is the ability to understand and experience other people’s emotional states (Decety 
& Jackson, 2004). Some research programs distinguish between affective and cognitive 
empathy. The former (which usually includes empathic concern and personal distress) 
refers to the ability to adequately express or recognize emotions in response to others’ 
mental states. Cognitive empathy, sometimes identified with ToM (see below), refers more 
specifically to the capacity to imagine and understand others’ perspectives or mental states. 
Several cognitive and affective functions are involved in this process, which engages the

(ACC) (Decety & Jackson, 2004; Decety & Lamm, 2006; Jackson, Rainville, & Decety, 
2006; Melloni, Lopez, & Ibanez, 2013). The amygdala and related frontotemporal networks 
are critical for the detection of intentional harm in empathy-for-pain paradigms (Hesse 
et al., 2016). Empathy is one of the most widely compromised social cognition domains 
across a range of neurodegenerative (Rankin et al., 2006), cerebrovascular (Leigh et al., 
2013), psychiatric (Derntl, Seidel, Schneider, & Habel, 2012), and neurodevelopmental 
(Baron-Cohen, 2009) conditions (Table 2).

Empathy deficits are noteworthy and consistent in bvFTD (Baez, Manes, et al., 2014; 
Eslinger, Moore, Anderson, & Grossman, 2011; Lough et al., 2006; Rankin et al., 2006; 
Rankin, Kramer, & Miller, 2005), which involves atrophy in frontotemporal networks 
extending throughout the above structures (Cerami, Dodich, Canessa, Crespi, Marcone, et 
al., 2014; Eslinger et al., 2011; Rankin et al., 2005). Loss of empathy in this population has 
been related to early impairment in social functioning (Piguet et al., 2011). Suggestively, 
core (affective) deficits in empathic concern appear to be unrelated to executive dysfunction 
(Baez, Manes, et al., 2014) and triggered by regions of early atrophy, such as the 
orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala (Baez, Morales, et al., 2016).

Research on other neurological conditions (Table 2) largely supports a network-based 
conceptualization of empathy (Cerami, Dodich, Canessa, Crespi, Iannaccone, et al., 2014; 
Kraemer et al., 2013; Leigh et al., 2013; Narme et al., 2013; Rankin et al., 2006; 
S. G. Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, Goldsher, Berger, & Aharon-Peretz, 2004). For instance, 
cognitive and affective empathy are doubly dissociated following lesions to the ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the inferior frontal gyrus, respectively (S. G. Shamay-
Tsoory, Aharon-Peretz, & Perry, 2009). Similarly, a comparison among neurodegenerative 
conditions (Rankin et al., 2005) suggests that affective empathy is likely mediated by 
temporal structures, whereas cognitive empathy is partially mediated by frontal structures. 
These studies align with previous evidence in showing that several neuroanatomical loci 
play a role in this vast functional network (D. P. Kennedy & R. Adolphs, 2012).

Empathy impairments have also been reported innumerous psychiatric disorders (Table 2), 
such as SZ (Derntl et al., 2009; McCormick et al., 2012; Montag, Heinz, Kunz, & Gallinat, 
2007), BD (Cusi, Macqueen, & McKinnon, 2010; Seidel et al., 2012; S. Shamay-Tsoory, 
Harari, Szepsenwol, & Levkovitz, 2009), and ASD (Baez & Ibanez, 2014a; Baez et al., 
2012; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004; Dziobek et al., 2008). Despite the variability 
in associated neural abnormalities (Derntl, Finkelmeyer, et al., 2012; Di Martino et al., 
2009; Fakra, Salgado-Pineda, Delaveau, Hariri, & Blin, 2008; Gur et al., 2007; Habel et al., 
2010; Pugliese et al., 2009), they rely on a partially shared network. For example, studies 
on SZ point to abnormal fronto-insular-temporal systems as a key correlate of empathy 
deficits (Benedetti et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2010). Such impairments can be tapped through 
ecological methods involving implicit cues, which more closely replicate real-life settings 
(Baez, Herrera, et al., 2013; Torralva et al., 2012).

Investigations in both neurological and psychiatric disorders point to a complex network 
subserving empathy processing. Different dimensions (empathic concern, perspective taking,

distress, intentionality) are affected to varying degrees across disorders and related to 
different and distributed regions of the empathizing network. Moreover, other aspects of 
empathy, such as the distinctions between cognitive and affective or explicit and implicit 
dimensions, are not well characterized at transnosological level. Thus, despite the initial 
step showing pervasive impairment of this function across neurological and psychiatric 
conditions, further research is required to tackle the above constructs transnosologically.

Theory of mind

The ability to infer other people’s mental states is known as ToM (Premack D, 1978). 
It implicates several areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the bilateral 
temporo-parietal junction, and the medial parietal cortex. ToM tasks involve various levels 
of complexity and recruit several cognitive processes (Ahmed & Stephen Miller, 2011). 
For example, the Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test only requires identifying an emotional 
state associated to a gaze; instead, the faux pass test is considerably more demanding, as it 
engages the ability to implicitly integrate cognitive inferences about mental states together 
with emotion understanding (Stone, Baron-Cohen, & Knight, 1998).

ToM is especially relevant for the clinical characterization and prognosis of bvFTD, as 
it is more impaired in this disease (Gregory et al., 2002; J. D. Henry, Phillips, & von 
Hippel, 2014) than in other neurodegenerative conditions (J. D. Henry, Phillips, Crawford, 
Ietswaart, & Summers, 2006). BvFTD patients have difficulties inferring others’ intentions 
(cognitive ToM) and emotional states (affective ToM) (Gregory et al., 2002; Schroeter, 
Raczka, Neumann, & von Cramon, 2008). These deficits may reflect damage to the 
frontomedian network (including the anterior PFC, the ACC, the subcallosal/septal area, 
and the gyrus rectus) (Bruning, Konrad, & Herpertz-Dahlmann, 2005; Couto, Manes, et al., 
2013), alterations in the anterior medial frontal cortex –Brodmann areas (BAs) 9 and 32–, 
hypometabolism in the right lateral PFC (Le Bouc et al., 2012), and perfusion in the left 
rostral medial PFC (BA 10)(Bertoux, Volle, et al., 2014).

ToM impairments are also pervasive in other neurological conditions, such as semantic 
dementia, temporal lobe epilepsy (Hennion et al., 2014), MS (Roca et al., 2014), focal brain 
lesions, and Parkinson’s disease (Poletti, Vergallo, Ulivi, Sonnoli, & Bonuccelli, 2013). 
Notably, AD patients feature impairments in the most complex levels of ToM –correlated 
with hypometabolism in the left temporo-parietal junction (Le Bouc et al., 2012)–, with 
preservation of intermediate and simple levels (Castelli et al., 2011). Similar deficits are 
observed in stroke patients with temporal and medial frontal damage (Duval et al., 2012).

Psychiatric conditions also involve ToM deficits. This is true of non-remitted and remitted 
patients diagnosed with SZ (Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009; Brune, 2005; Harrington, 
Siegert, & McClure, 2005; Huepe et al., 2012; Sprong, Schothorst, Vos, Hox, & van 
Engeland, 2007) and BD (Samame, Martino, & Strejilevich, 2012; Van Rheenen & Rossell, 
2013). ASD individuals are not the exception (Yirmiya, Erel, Shaked, & Solomonica-Levi, 
1998), although their impairments may be limited to implicit aspects of the domain 
(Schneider, Slaughter, Bayliss, & Dux, 2013). Complex ToM abilities are compromised 
in other conditions, such as OCD (Sayin, Oral, Utku, Baysak, & Candansayar, 2010). Social 
anxiety disorder patients stand apart from the previous populations in that they attribute

greater emotional content and meaningfulness to others’ mental states than controls (Hezel 
& McNally, 2014). Finally, context-sensitive tasks have revealed subtle ToM impairments 
in psychopaths (Sharp & Vanwoerden, 2014) and BPD patients (Preissler, Dziobek, Ritter, 
Heekeren, & Roepke, 2010). In the latter population, such deficits are partially explained by 
an incapacity to integrate social cues (Baez, Marengo, et al., 2014).

ToM impairments figure prominently in various neurological and psychiatric diseases (Table 
4). At a dimensional level, complex or high-order ToM deficits are more extended than 
those affecting basic ToM abilities. Although the latter are usually affected in very severe 
conditions, they are sometimes preserved after focal stroke, early stage neurodegeneration or 
even diffuse alterations, including connectivity aberrations. Also, these basic levels tend to 
be more affected in conditions with strong and extended social cognition impairments (e.g., 
bvFTD, SZ) than in those conditions with more restrictive social impairments (e.g., PD, AD, 
OCD). Similarly, implicit ToM tasks which depend on more extended brain networks are 
often more sensitive than explicit paradigms across neuropsychiatric conditions. Besides, the 
review shows that different pathophysiological mechanisms can originate these deficits. Not 
only core (e.g., direct compromise following lesions or atrophy of prefrontal or temporal 
regions) but also distributed or unspecific brain disturbances can induce ToM impairments. 
Similarly, different affective (e.g., empathy) and cognitive (e.g., intelligence) domains 
impacts in ToM performance (Ibanez et al., 2013). Also, complex ToM skills are more 
sensitive to impairments in non-social mechanisms, such as language or executive functions. 
Regarding the multiple neural mechanisms of ToM subtypes (emotional, cognitive, high-
level mentalizing, irony, figurative language, perspective taking), more systematic research 
is needed. Dimensional and transnosological comparisons across ToM components and 
associated neural substrates are also missing.

Moral judgment

Morality can be defined as the code of values and customs conventionally accepted within 
a social group (Marazziti, Baroni, Landi, Ceresoli, & Dell’Osso, 2013). Moral cognition 
consists in using such codes to guide culturally adequate social behavior (Jorge Moll, 
Roland Zahn, Ricardo de Oliveira-Souza, Frank Krueger, & Jordan Grafman, 2005), by 
virtue of cognitive, emotion-related, and ToM processes (Decety & Howard, 2013; Decety, 
Michalska, & Kinzler, 2012). These domains converge, for example, in the passing of 
moral judgment (Anderson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1999), via both cortical 
(OFC, anterior PFC, dorsolateral PFC, vmPFC, anterior temporal lobes, superior temporal 
sulcus) and subcortical (amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus, septal area and nuclei, basal 
forebrain) structures (J. Moll, R. Zahn, R. de Oliveira-Souza, F. Krueger, & J. Grafman, 
2005).

Moral judgment is typically impaired in bvFTD patients (Lough et al., 2006), who lack 
moral emotional reactions, favor utilitarian decisions in personal dilemmas, and approve 
emotion-guided moral violations (Mendez, Anderson, & Shapira, 2005; Mendez & Shapira, 
2009). Moreover, these patients have difficulty inferring the intentionality of others’ actions 
(Baez, Couto, et al., 2014; Baez, Manes, et al., 2014), and tend to base their moral decisions 
exclusively on outcomes rather than on the integration of intentions and outcomes (Baez,

Couto, et al., 2014). This impairment is triggered by atrophy of extended networks (but not 
focalized regions) implicated in moral processing (Baez, Kanske, et al., 2015). In healthy 
participants, moral judgment tasks engage areas comprised by FTD atrophy, such as the 
lateral OFC and the medial PFC (during transgressions of social norms) (Berthoz, Armony, 
Blair, & Dolan, 2002) and the posterior cingulate gyrus, the amygdala, and the vmPFC 
(in moral dilemma solving) (J. D. Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, & Cohen, 2004; J. D. 
Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001).

Deficits in moral judgment are pervasive across neurological conditions. Subsequent 
to vmPFC damage, stroke patients fail to generate skin conductance responses before 
endorsing personal moral violations (Ciaramelli, Muccioli, Ladavas, & di Pellegrino, 2007; 
Moretto, Ladavas, Mattioli, & di Pellegrino, 2010). In addition, when judging harmful 
intent, these patients base their moral judgments preferentially on action outcomes (Baez, 
Couto, et al., 2014; Young et al., 2010). Although many studies have emphasized the 
role of the vmPFC in intuitive/affective moral judgment, similar impairments are observed 
following frontal stroke, with or without vmPFC involvement (Baez, Couto, et al., 2014; 
Njomboro, Humphreys, & Deb, 2014; Young et al., 2010) or partial callosotomy (M. B. 
Miller et al., 2010). In neurodegenerative diseases such as HD, impairments in recognizing 
facial expressions correlate with violations of socio-moral norms (Calder et al., 2010) and 
moral emotions (e.g., schadenfreude) are also affected (Baez, Santamaría-García, et al., 
2016). During normal brain ontogeny, early PFC lesions compromise the development of 
moral skills (Anderson et al., 1999); indeed, children with traumatic brain injury evince 
immature socio-moral reasoning (Beauchamp, Dooley, & Anderson, 2013).

Similar impairments in moral judgment have also been observed in psychiatric disorders. 
Psychopaths fail to make the moral/conventional distinction (Blair, 1995) and more 
frequently endorse utilitarian choices when facing personal dilemmas (Koenigs, Kruepke, 
Zeier, & Newman, 2012). The same occurs in individuals with addictions (Carmona-Perera, 
Clark, Young, Perez-Garcia, & Verdejo-Garcia, 2014; Khemiri, Guterstam, Franck, & 
Jayaram-Lindstrom, 2012). Such patterns are related to functional alterations in the PFC and 
other regions (Koob & Volkow, 2010; Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2014). Adults with ASD judge 
conventional and disgust transgressions as more serious than do controls, while failing to 
distinguish between disgust and moral transgressions (Moran et al., 2011; Zalla, Barlassina, 
Buon, & Leboyer, 2011). They also favor utilitarian judgments in moral dilemmas tasks 
(Gleichgerrcht et al., 2013) and show a dissociation between moral knowledge and 
moral judgment. The opposite pattern has been observed in OCD (Franklin, McNally, & 
Riemann, 2009). Furthermore, immature moral reasoning has been detected across age 
groups in social deprivation (Escobar et al., 2014), sociopathic conditions (Campagna & 
Harter, 1975), high-functioning pervasive developmental disorders (Takeda, Kasai, & Kato, 
2007), and SZ (Benson, 1980). In psychopaths, addicts, sociopathic children, and socially 
deprived adolescents, moral dilemma tasks yield reduced activation patterns in several areas, 
including the PFC, the cingulate gyrus, and the insula.

In sum, moral judgment is compromised across neurological and psychiatric conditions 
(Table 3), although current research is difficult to integrate given the diversity of tasks 
employed, the different moral domains being assessed, and the dearth of systematic

comparisons across conditions. As this function depends on an extended neural network 
(Moll & Schulkin, 2009; J. Moll et al., 2005), which is differentially affected at different 
levels, several conditions present both similar and dissimilar impairments. Also, subtle 
differences among moral sensitivity, emotions, reasoning, and dilemmas are not well 
understood. We do not yet know how these different dimensions interact and manifest 
each condition. Dimensionality in a single domain must also be considered within specific 
groups. For instance, in studies of moral dilemmas, different patient populations present 
non-absolute differential patterns of utilitarian and deontological responses. Not all patients 
with bvFTD develop aberrant moral judgments, and not all OCD patients present hyper-
moralistic judgments. Moral cognition impairments are very variable across individuals 
(within and between diseases). Thus, future neuroscience research should point at individual 
differences (Dubois & Adolphs, 2016) as a strategy to provide a better dimensional 
characterization across conditions. Also, some areas that have been rarely explored (e.g., 
moral emotions) should be assessed together with other moral processes. Thus, a challenge 
for future neuropsychiatric research into moral cognition is to assess individual and 
group variability across relevant processes and test multilevel models considering different 
pathophysiological mechanisms.

Ecological assessment of social context

Human interaction and social cognition are multifariously influenced by context, namely, the 
relevant circumstances surrounding a cognitive event (Adolphs, 2009; Barrett, Lindquist, & 
Gendron, 2007). Integrating contextual information with our appraisal of others’ intentions 
is critical to deploy adequate social behaviors and access social meaning (Adolph, Meister, 
& Pause, 2013; Adolphs, 2009; Baez, Herrera, et al., 2013; Ibanez & Manes, 2012). 
Context-dependent effects have been documented in low-level domains –such as visual 
perception (Bar, 2004)– and in high-level social cognition –including prediction and 
understanding of others’ intentions and meanings (Baez, Garcia, & Ibanez, 2016; Baez, 
Herrera, et al., 2013; Baez & Ibanez, 2014b; Baez et al., 2012; Ibanez & Manes, 2012).

BvFTD clearly illustrates that social cognition impairments result from a general inability 
to integrate contextual information (Ibanez & Manes, 2012). Such deficits are present 
since early stages of the disease and probably reflect abnormalities in a fronto-temporo-
insular network (Ibanez & Manes, 2012), although they are not easily captured in classical 
and routine neuropsychological assessment. An aberrant fronto-temporo-insular network 
predicts social cognition deficits in bvFTD (Sedeño et al., 2016) The same holds for 
frontal lobe lesion patients (Mesulam, 1986). Deficits in this population can be tapped via 
more ecological tasks with implicit contextual cues (Burgess, Alderman, Volle, Benoit, & 
Gilbert, 2009). By the same token, during short-term contextual processing tasks, patients 
with prefrontal compromise exhibit abnormal behavioral and electrophysiological responses 
(Fogelson, Shah, Scabini, & Knight, 2009). Both, bvFTD and frontal lesion patients present 
difficulties to develop context-sensitive strategies for successful social bargaining. These 
deficits are associated not only with atrophy and lesions of prefrontal regions, but also 
with frontotemporal aberrant oscillations during social offers as well as fronto-posterior 
functional connectivity abnormalities (Melloni et al., 2016). The crucial role of context for 
social cognition is further highlighted by studies on HD. Here, deficits in the appraisal of

disgust (Sprengelmeyer et al., 1996) and other negative emotions (Johnson et al., 2007) 
during FER are reduced when contextual clues are provided (Aviezer, 2009; Baez, Herrera, 
et al., 2015).

Similar difficulties have been observed in psychiatric disorders. In SZ, inefficient integration 
of situational information (Amoruso, Cardona, Melloni, Sedeno, & Ibanez, 2012; Guerra 
et al., 2009; Ibáñez et al., 2011) may influence emotion recognition (Green, Waldron, 
& Coltheart, 2007; Green, Waldron, Simpson, & Coltheart, 2008; Monkul et al., 2007), 
supporting the idea that social context processing is impaired (Cohen, Barch, Carter, & 
Servan-Schreiber, 1999; Riveros et al., 2010). Also frontal activity engaged in predictive 
coding of upcoming information is also affected in ADHD and ASD (Gonzalez-Gadea et al., 
2015). Similar to bvFTD, SZ features deficits to contextually update social decisions during 
bargaining (Billeke et al., 2015). Also, ADHD and ASD presents reduced and aberrant 
markers of social cooperation(Gonzalez-Gadea et al., 2016), respectively. Notably, such 
deficits, which affect both social and non-social domains (Chung & Barch, 2011), become 
more marked in ecological tasks (Baez, Herrera, et al., 2013), highlighting the need for 
novel context-sensitive approaches (Chung & Barch, 2011). Comparable deficits have been 
reported in BD research, although these are not so severe (Baez, Herrera, et al., 2013; 
Brambilla et al., 2007). Also, in ASD, aberrant implicit recognition of contextual clues 
(Senju, 2012) triggers impairments in social cognition (Baez & Ibanez, 2014a; Baez et al., 
2012; Schneider et al., 2013; Senju, Southgate, White, & Frith, 2009). Finally, attentional 
demands in complex scenarios increase emotion-related deficits in psychopaths (Newman, 
Curtin, Bertsch, & Baskin-Sommers, 2010; Sadeh et al., 2013) and young offenders (M. L. 
Gonzalez-Gadea, E. Herrera, et al., 2014).

Altogether, the above findings highlight disturbances of implicit contextual appraisal as 
one further commonality between neurological and psychiatric conditions (Table 5). As 
predicted by the social context network model (Baez et al., 2012; Ibanez & Manes, 2012), 
prefrontal areas would support focused predictions by dynamically updating associations in 
a specific context (Amoruso et al., 2016; Amoruso et al., 2014; Bar, 2004; Friston, 2012; 
Torralva, Gleichgerrcht, Ibanez, & Manes, 2016). Also, target-context links subserved by 
temporal regions would be integrated with feature-based information subserved by frontal 
regions (A. J. Greene, Gross, Elsinger, & Rao, 2006) (Bar, 2004). Finally, the insular cortex 
would be critical to merge emotional and highlevel signals related to the coordination 
between external and internal milieus (Canales-Johnson et al., 2015; Couto, Adolfi, Sedeno, 
et al., 2015; Couto, Adolfi, Velasquez, Mesow, Feinstein, Canales-Johnson, Mikulan, 
Martinez-Pernia, et al., 2015; Couto, Adolfi, Velasquez, Mesow, Feinstein, Canales-Johnson, 
Mikulan, Martínez-Pernía, et al., 2015; Couto et al., 2014; Couto, Sedeno, et al., 2013; 
García-Cordero et al., 2016; Garfinkel & Critchley, 2013; Melloni, Sedeno, et al., 2013; 
Sedeno et al., 2014; Uddin, Kinnison, Pessoa, & Anderson, 2014; Yoris et al., 2015). Thus, 
deficits in contextual social cognition will emerge upon compromise to any of these three 
main hubs. However, no dimensional study has revealed the specific contributions of these 
hubs (frontal, insular, and temporal) to each subprocess or their interactions during relevant 
tasks. Also, there is no information about how distinct pathophysiological mechanisms 
differentially impact this network across neuropsychiatric conditions. Finally, most current 
tasks fail to capture the influence of implicit contextual information on socio-cognitive

paradigms (A. M. García & Ibáñez, 2014) and situated cross-domain tasks (A. García & 
Ibáñez, 2016).

A TRIANGULATION WITH SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE

Nearly all neurological and psychiatric disorders involve some form of impairment in the 
above domains, all of which are systematically assessed by social neuroscience. Despite 
the relative youth and internal problems of this field, we argue that it is prime time to 
triangulate its efforts with those of neurology and psychiatry. Moreover, basic principles 
which guide current social neuroscience can provide fruitful advances if they are applied to 
neuropsychiatry, as described below.

Tracking the synergies between brain structures and functions

In both neurological and psychiatric disorders, social cognition deficits emerge from 
disturbances of networks spanning multiple neural locations. Modern imaging techniques 
reveal intimate and complementary connections between brain anatomy and function 
(Northoff, 2008). In the same vein, diseases and pharmacotherapy may alter not just 
brain functions, but also neural structures proper. Building upon these findings, cognitive 
neuroscience conceives mental processes as emerging from coordinated neural activity 
over multiple regions (see below). Across disorders, different substrates (from neuronal 
channels and genes to global ensembles) subserve specific cognitive functions through 
various interactions (Millan et al., 2012). Moreover, in neuropsychiatric conditions, 
social cognition impairments are not consistently associated with well-defined structural 
atypicalities (Dickinson & Harvey, 2009). At the same time, functional abnormalities in 
psychiatric patients have been associated with aberrant brain structure (Millan et al., 2012). 
Thus, the interplay among structures and functions in both neurological and psychiatric 
conditions should be thoroughly studied. This agenda would also help to understand how 
macroanatomical (e.g., focal lesions or specific neurotransmitter abnormalities affecting 
whole-brain dynamics) and microanatomical (e.g., channelopathies compromising in neural 
network dynamics) phenomena impact social cognition functions. Similarly, we can study 
how classically functional conditions are associated with enduring structural atrophy and 
how changes in aberrant connectivity induce structural changes. As shown by social 
neuroscience, in between and around such constructs lie multiple interacting dimensions that 
challenge one-to-one associations between structural damage and neurological disorders, 
one the one hand, and functional alterations and psychiatric conditions, on the other.

Multilevel brain mechanisms for social cognition impairments

Diseases are not monolithic entities; rather, they result from the interaction of social, 
neural, hormonal, cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying and surrounding 
cognitive processes (Caspi & Moffitt, 2006). Social and psychological phenomena have a 
profound impact on multiple neural levels, which in turn affect the former in various ways. 
For instance, stress can induce molecular and cellular brain changes leading to behavioral 
inadequacies (Cryan & Kaupmann, 2005; Krystal et al., 2002; Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, 
& Heim, 2009; Maguire & Mody, 2008) and illness (Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). Indeed,

soluble mediators released by immune cells can affect the central nervous system and alter 
behavior (Irwin & Cole, 2011; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). In addition, mood and anxiety 
disorders can be the early manifestation of broader diseases, or they can index a disruption 
of neural networks supporting interpersonal and emotional processes (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, 
Dulawa, & Palmer, 2014; Davidson, Pizzagalli, Nitschke, & Putnam, 2002). Accompanying 
social deficits might promote stressful interactions and contribute to a multilevel vicious 
circle (Bartolomucci et al., 2005; Cacioppo et al., 2014; Meyer-Lindenberg, 2014). Social 
stress may even have an impact on genetic regulation (Cacioppo et al., 2014; Cole, Hawkley, 
Arevalo, & Cacioppo, 2011). In particular, perceived social isolation (loneliness) modifies 
the expression of genes driving inflammation, one of the first responses of the immune 
system (Cole et al., 2011). Molecular changes induced by perceived or real social isolation 
may duplicate the chances of developing dementia (Wilson et al., 2007) and increases 
mortality (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Capitanio, & Cole, 2015).

In turn, pure pathophysiological conditions can directly affect social and emotional 
processes. This occurs in cases of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a disturbance of 
lifestyle including symptoms of irritability, tension, dysphoria, and mood lability)(Steiner, 
1997), toxic psychosis (a substance-related disorder), and MS (where the feelings of 
depression and fatigue are common and detrimental to life quality (Krupp, Alvarez, 
LaRocca, & Scheinberg, 1988; Marrie et al., 2015)). The same is true of a wide range of 
neurodegenerative diseases (Levenson, Sturm, & Haase, 2014; Neary et al., 1998). In FTD, 
pathology involves complex interrelations among genetic, neural, and behavioral levels, 
which challenges straightforward conceptualizations of the disease. Just as an example, the 
same mutation in gene C9orf72 can lead to either bvFTD (with its typical social cognition 
impairments) or a predominant motor disease (such as ALS) (Bruijn, Miller, & Cleveland, 
2004; Mahoney et al., 2012).

Over the years, scientists have garnered convergent information from different levels 
(genetics, neurobiology, behavior, social enviroment). Yet, this mosaic strategy has not yet 
provided an adequate picture of neuropsychiatric conditions, let alone their vast variability 
(Devor et al., 2013). Correlating mental disorders with brain activity patterns in critical 
regions is only a first step towards specifying the mechanisms behind nervous disorders 
(Cacioppo et al., 2014). An adequate picture of neuropsychiatric conditions requires 
connecting the dots from all these dimensions (Devor et al., 2013).

The multilevel view of social cognition poses additional challenges for triangulation. 
Although some of them are beyond current agenda of social neuroscience, a number of steps 
can be taken in that direction. The development of multimodal assesements of interaction 
across levels can be boosted by the direct comparison of pathophisiological mechanisms. 
To this end, it would be crucial to expand the visibility of triangulated approaches via 
special issues, specific funding opportunities, and explicit discussion fora. Finally, recent 
data-driven methods of social neuroscience (Adolphs, Nummenmaa, Todorov, & Haxby, 
2016) can capitalize on large datasets, find patterns across levels, and provide a better 
characterizacion of the transdimensional nature of social cogntion.

How to promote dimensional and transnosological research via a brain network approach

Social cognition impairments attributed to a specific substrate can be supported by spatio-
temporal integration of neural hubs. Today, we know that adequate cognitive states depend 
on the spatial and temporal organization of long-range networks (Sporns, 2014). This is 
especially true of the social brain (D. P. Kennedy & R. Adolphs, 2012). Some network 
attributes, such as small-world properties, are associated to similar impairments in both 
neurological and psychiatric disorders (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009). However, dissimilar 
pathophysiological processes impact differentially in network properties (García-Cordero 
et al., 2015; Sedeño et al., 2016).The default mode network (DMN), which is implicated 
in social cognition processes, actually constitutes a transdiagnostic marker across these 
diseases. The DMN is impaired in AD, SZ, ASD, and many other disorders. Further research 
characterizing the similarities and differences across conditions regarding the role of the 
DMN in social cognition will offer finer grained insights than those currently available. This 
will also allow answering whether damage to specific hubs lead to similar social cognition 
deficits across disorders. Also, the network dynamics can be used to investigate how specific 
social cognition mechanisms (e.g., the salience network) interact with other non-social 
mechanisms (e.g., fronto-parietal network). Finally, modifications in the connectivity of 
affected hubs (Silasi & Murphy, 2014) may afford future strategies for treatment.

NEUROPSYCHIATRY INFORMING SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE

In the review section we assessed available evidence for dimensional and transdiagnostic 
social cognition impairments in neurological and psychiatric conditions. This evidence 
provides a fruitful agenda for new questions, as listed at the end of each sub-section therein. 
Here, we detail how the triangulation can advance a deeper understanding of the social 
impairments.

Different models of the social brain

Parallel models of the social brain emerge from each level of impairment. For example, 
the study of moral cognition can thrive by considering patients with localized vmPFC 
damage (Koenigs et al., 2007; Young et al., 2010). Despite this straightforward association, 
a more extended anatomy may be postulated for moral sensitivity by considering diffuse 
frontotemporal damage in neurodegeneration (Baez, Couto, et al., 2014; Ibanez & Manes, 
2012). Moreover, white-matter connectivity models of moral cognition can be advanced by 
reference to complete and partial callosotomy (M. B. Miller et al., 2010).

Additional evidence may be garnered from disorders lacking precise neuroanatomical 
foundations. Psychopathy, ASD, and Williams syndrome present partially opposite social 
phenotypes which inform dissociations within the social cognition domain. Furthermore, 
models of moral cognition may stem from research on aberrant neurotransmission in 
relevant diseases, including mesolimbic dopaminergic dysfunction (Khemiri et al., 2012; 
Koob & Volkow, 2010) and serotonergic dysregulation (Koob & Volkow, 2010; Whitton, 
Henry, & Grisham, 2014). In sum, different pathogenetic processes across neuropsychiatric 
conditions can provide separate yet compatible avenues to build complex models of 
the social brain. One simple way to organize a research program consists in advancing

empirical comparisons of a social cognition domain (e.g., moral cognition) across different 
patient populations with different physiopathology, including focal damage of critical 
regions, diffuse alterations of functional networks, disruption of anatomical tracts, and 
neurotransmitter dysregulation, among others. In the future, this would help to clarify which 
mechanisms are more critical to the target domain, how they interact, and what alternative 
ways may be posed to ameliorate specific disorders.

Social dysfunction at the center or the periphery

Social cognition can be impaired by primary or secondary disturbances, such as executive 
or linguistic deficits. Empathy, as well as other abilities discussed in above sections, relies 
on working memory (Ze, Thoma, & Suchan, 2014) inhibitory control (Hansen, 2011; Ze 
et al., 2014), and other executive functions (Rankin et al., 2005). Inhibition of one’s own 
perspective is a prerrequisite for ToM (Samson, Apperly, Kathirgamanathan, & Humphreys, 
2005). Furthermore, working memory is required in complex social situations (Meyer, 
Spunt, Berkman, Taylor, & Lieberman, 2012; Rankin et al., 2006). Language disorders may 
also disrupt social functioning in an indirect way. Wernicke’s aphasics, being mostly unable 
to recognize the unintelligibility of their own speech, are prone to develop major paranoid 
syndrome and even manifest antisocial behavior (Damasio, 1998). Also, in high-functioning 
ASD, ToM deficits are correlated with deficits to comprehend figurative language, including 
metaphors and irony (Huang, Oi, & Taguchi, 2015). All in all, similar imapairments in social 
cognition can be triggered by either specifically social deficits or other types of cognitive 
dysfunction.

Thus, although we can identify some cases where social cognition is more primarily 
or secondarily affected, the systematic study of the differences among these conditions 
is scarce. Further research is needed to understand how underlying networks underlying 
primary or secondary functions overlap and interact.

Inter-cognition: Beyond instrumental parcellation

Classical assessments of cognitive processes are typically rooted in isolation paradigms 
(Becchio, Sartori, & Castiello, 2010), experimental set-ups in which a single participant 
views pre-programmed,decontextualized stimuli and repeatedly performs the same task 
on them. However, in neurological disorders, such as PD (Dirnberger & Jahanshahi, 
2013), NMO (Cardona et al., 2014), and ALS (Watermeyer et al., 2015), social cognition 
impairments are typically concomitant with deficits in other cognitive domains. The same is 
true of psychiatric conditions (Dere, Pause, & Pietrowsky, 2010). ASD involves impairments 
in central components of social cognition, including ToM and empathy (Geschwind, 2009), 
but these deficits also depend on executive dysfunction (Robinson, Goddard, Dritschel, 
Wisley, & Howlin, 2009) and even sensory deficiencies. Likewise, BD, SZ, MMD, OCD, 
ADHD, and post-traumatic stress disorder are characterized by both cognitive (e.g., working 
memory, memory systems, executive functions, processing speed) and social cognition 
impairments (Millan et al., 2012). Moreover, higher levels of cognitive variability are 
observed across disorders (e.g., (Gonzalez-Gadea et al., 2013; Maria Luz Gonzalez-Gadea et 
al., 2014)).

Unlike what experimental paradigms and ensuing theories imply, neuropsychiatric disorders 
do not involve deficits in a single domain. To incorporate intercognitive deficits in the 
agenda of neuroscientific research, less fragmentary methodologies must be developed. 
In the future, classical experimental approaches that de-naturalize participants’ cognitive 
processes by prioritizing fixed, oversimplified, and isolated tasks should be complemented 
by more naturalistic tasks engaging interconnected cognitive processes (J. D. Henry, 
Cowan, Lee, & Sachdev, 2015). Current advances of “second-person” (Schilbach et al., 
2013) or “two-person” (T. Liu & Pelowski, 2014) neuroscience assesing brain-to-brain 
coupling (Hasson, Ghazanfar, Galantucci, Garrod, & Keysers, 2012) and active forms 
of social interaction (Pfeiffer, Timmermans, Vogeley, Frith, & Schilbach, 2013), together 
with multisource recording technologies, cameras, and mobile devices (e.g., wearable eye 
trackers), will be key components of this prospective toolkit. In brief, we need to move 
from isolated, disembodied, and passive assessments of social processes to more ecological 
approximations (Barutta, Aravena, & Ibanez, 2010; Barutta, Cornejo, & Ibáñez, 2011; 
Cosmelli & Ibanez, 2008; Ibanez & Cosmelli, 2008).

SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE INFORMING NEUROPSYCHIATRY

Historically, several neurological and psychiatric disorders have been assessed with an 
emphasis on specific symptomatology (mostly based on behavioral and mood-related 
observations, respectively). Little attention has been paid to the patients’ social dysfunctions, 
which are equally prominent and affect real-world functioning (Cacioppo et al., 2014). 
Social cognition deficits can be detrimental to functional performance, particularly as 
regards instrumental activities of daily living. Indeed, several neuropsychiatric conditions 
involve a disproportion between global cognitive function and daily functioning. Social 
cognition domains have to be assessed taking into consideration the clinical characterization 
and questions about patients’ everyday difficulties. Hence, social cognition measures may be 
more appropriate surrogate markers of functional efficiency for many patients. Through 
a combination of behavioral measures, experimental manipulations, and physiological 
recordings, social neuroscience may sow the seeds for a new conception of neuropsychiatric 
disorders and a novel approach to clinical practice.

Dimensional and transdiagnostic crosstalk in psychiatry and neurology

Social cognition impairments in major clinical entities from neurology and psychiatry 
could be better understood by providing transnosological research. The need for new 
approaches to classify mental disorders has been addressed by the Research Domain Criteria 
(RDoC) project. The same dimensional and transdiagnostic principles are more difficult 
to implement in neurology, but some developments have begun (e.g., (Carter & Ffytche, 
2015)), specially under the guidance of social neuroscience (Brugger & Lenggenhager, 
2014). The RDoC begins with, but is not limited to, symptoms. A further advance may 
crystallize upon joint consideration of biobehavioral dimensions cutting across multiple 
levels of analysis. Neurocognitive states cannot be properly conceived if framed separately 
from concomitant socio-affective processes (Casey, Oliveri, & Insel, 2014; Insel, 2014).

Renewing clinical assessment and professional training

Social neuroscience implies a renewed approach to clinical assessment and professional 
training. Improvements in socio-cognitive performance and interaction are beneficial to 
patients’ life quality (S. Cacioppo, Capitanio, & Cacioppo, 2014; Millan et al., 2012). 
By including social cognition assessments, clinical practice would capitalize on an expert 
research area with major translational potential. To this end, clinical training should 
emphasize contributions from social neuroscience with a view to broadening current 
assessment standards. In other words, to ensure excellence in clinical practice, both 
neurologists and psychiatrists should be trained in a dimensional and transdiagnostic 
approach to social cognition. Currently, residency programs in neuropsychiatry (in the 
US and Europe) rarely include an in-depth study of social cognition in their curricula, 
specially during early stages of professional education. Training in different social cognitive 
domains, including behavioral assessment, knowledge of underlying neural dynamics, and 
current know-how from social neuroscience is crucial to increase the awareness of social 
cognition in neuropsychiatry and facilitate exchanges among neurologists and psychiatrists. 
A common approach to social neuroscience and neuropsychiatry may ameliorate the adverse 
effects of subspecialization and separation of clinical disciplines (Aminoff, 2008).

Pharmacological therapeutics

Stabilization of chemical alterations underlying social disturbances may have positive effects 
across disease types. The neuroprotective effect of oxytocin treatment may impact social 
interaction and social cognition performance not only in ASD (Bakermans-Kranenburg & 
van, 2013) but also in other disorders such as stroke (Karelina et al., 2011), genetic diseases 
(Francis et al., 2014), autism and seizures (Durand, Pampillo, Caruso, & Lasaga, 2008), 
Prader-Willi syndrome (Meziane et al., 2014), anxiety (Milrod et al., 2014), BPD (Stanley 
& Siever, 2010), depression and chronic stress (Durand et al., 2008), and notably bvFTD 
(Finger, 2011). While not yet approved, multiple pharmacological treatments could prove 
beneficial for social behavior in different conditions. The comparison of clinical outcomes, 
long-lasting and side effects, as well as other treatment-related variables could provide a 
better undertanding of the benefits and generalizabilit of specifis drugs for social cognition 
improvement.

THE CHALLENGES AHEAD: HOW TO BRING THE FRAMEWORK TO 

INSTITUTIONAL LIFE

In the above sections, we have updated how social neurosience have a active impact in 
traingulating neurology and psychiatry. Nevertheles, the greatest long-term challenge is 
how to formally implement this approach. Bringing this framework to life in academic 
and clinical settings calls for major institutional developments. A typical problem for 
clinical training programs and professional practice is to establish a particular assessment/
evaluation/treatment for a specific disorder. Clinical, funding, and academic programs 
typically target highly specialized training, focus on a particular condition, and support 
only specific research programs. This is inconsistent with current knowledge of social 
impairments, as it calls for expertise in many conditions through theoretically heterogeneous

training. A new institutional rationale must be forged for this to happen. First, potential 
funding sources, both in the public and private sectors, should open their options for 
field-specific financing to dimensional psychiatric and neurological projects. Funds made 
available for psychiatric research, for instance, should not be denied to viable projects on the 
grounds that they include both neurological and psychiatric conditions. Second, faculties and 
departments specialized in either discipline should be formally encouraged to incorporate 
literature and courses aimed to show the continuities among both types of dysfunction.

World experts must come together to produce groundbreaking journals and handbooks 
which foster developments within a dimensional and integrative social neuroscience 
approach to neuropsychiatry. Clinical institutions should mirror such synergistic actions 
in their training programs and ongoing practices. Thus, a sistematic triangulation can only 
become concrete if major educational and political changes are progressively made. Even 
if shared social cognition impairments in neurological and psychiatric disorders are already 
broadly acknowledged, implementing this conception at an institutional level will constitute 
a major challenge. The framework presently outlined seeks to inspire more integrative 
training, funding, and academic opportunities.

CONCLUSIONS

Since the first descriptions of neurocognitive diseases in ancient Egypt (Santoro et al., 
2009) and pre-Hippocratic Greece (York & Steinberg, 2001), the history of nervous diseases 
has been marked by exclusionary (sometimes indexed as biological or psychological) 
explanations (Barutta et al., 2011; Barutta, Gleichgerrcht, Cornejo, & Ibáñez, 2010; 
Mikulan, Reynaldo, & Ibanez, 2014). Current neuroscientific views partially circumvent this 
tradition but still face several difficulties to gain a deeper understanding of social cognition 
impairments. Social neuroscience offers a dimensional and transdiagnostic triangulation to 
advance towards a better grasp of the impaired social brain.
