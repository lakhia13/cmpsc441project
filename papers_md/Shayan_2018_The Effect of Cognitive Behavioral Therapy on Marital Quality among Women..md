Abstract 
Background: Marital quality reflects the individual’s overall evaluation of marital relationship. The aim of study was 
examine the effect of cognitive behavioral counseling on marital quality among women.

Materials and Methods: The experimental study was a randomized clinical trial with two groups, on 198 qualified 
women who referred to selected health care centers in Hamadan, Iran in 2016. The intervention participants attended 
four 90-minute sessions of cognitive behavioral counseling. Demographic information questionnaire and marital qual-
ity scale [Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS)] were completed by the two groups before and after the interven-
tion. To perform the comparisons, t test, Chi-square test and Fisher’s test, Logistic Regression and covariance analysis 
were used. Covariance analysis or change analysis were employed. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Software, 
version 21.0. The significance level was set at 5% (P<0.05).

Results: According to the results of the present study, the mean age in the control group and the intervention group 
was 23.58 ± 7.54 and 35.04 ± 7.91 years old, respectively. Covariance analysis was utilized to examine the marital 
quality scores. In this analysis, after modification of the variables of age, marital quality score of agreement and sat-
isfaction before the intervention, and income status, the total marital quality score experienced a significant change 
in all dimensions (P<0.05) and the mean scores increased remarkably. Moreover, according to the cut-off point of the 
dimensions, the scores of all dimensions increased remarkably and the proportion of individuals with high marital 
quality before and after the intervention changed significantly (P<0.05). 

Conclusion: Due to the role of sexual relations in stabilizing marriage, cognitive behavioral consultation was effective 
in improving marital quality especially after agreement and can be used in health care centers in order to improve the 
relationship between couples and reduce divorce rates (Registration number: IRCT201610209014N125).

Introduction 

Marital quality has been studied in positive psychology 
and  its  role  in  interpersonal  relationships,  especially  in 
marital relationships, is remarkable. According to Marx, 
“quality  of  marital  relations  is  the  result  of  methods 
through which married individuals systematically organ-
ize this triangle”. The quality of marital relations and the 
level of happiness depend on how wife and husband in-
teract with each other and cope with stressful situations 
of life (1). 

Marital quality reflects the individual’s total evaluation 
of the marital relation (2). The third approach is Marx’s 

theory which is a combined approach developed based on 
Lewis  and  Spanier  approach  and  Bowen  systematic  ap-
proach. Marx has a systematic attitude towards individual 
and the individual’s relationship with spouse and others. 
In his theoretical framework, he stated that a married per-
son has three angles including inner angel, spouse angle, 
and effective person. 

The first angel is the inner angel that includes the indi-
vidual’s personality with his efforts, motivations, and dif-
ferent energies which is formed based on his experience 
during life. The second angle is the relationship with the 
spouse. The third angle is any outside concentration point

except for the spouse. Generally, Marx believes that mari-
tal quality is the result of the methods by which married 
individuals  systematically  organize  themselves  within 
this triangle (2, 3).

Sex  education  is  one  of  the  factors  that  improves  the 
relationship between couples and enhances marital qual-
ity. Lack of enough information about sex and improper 
attitudes  towards  this  issue  in  families  and  couples  are 
among the major problems that today’s Iranian society is 
facing, and leads to collapse of the family. In this regard, 
marital counseling as a specialized consultation can con-
vey the information necessary to create a favorable sexual 
life to the couples, so that they can utilize this informa-
tion to evolve and complete their marriage. In this regard, 
as midwives are in constant contact with the community 
and due to their awareness about sexual issues , they play 
a significant role in making sure about the couples’ sat-
isfaction  with  their marital life, whereby  a  step towards 
creating a healthy society, will be taken (4, 5). Statistics 
indicates that 50% of couples experience sexual dysfunc-
tion in some stages of their lives; however, few undergo 
consultation or treatment (6). 

By  providing  sex  education  and  consultation,  sexual 
problems  could  be  diminished  gradually,  and  unaware-
ness  will  be  replaced  with  complete  awareness.  Marital 
counseling for prevention of marital difficulties is one of 
the most effective methods of development of individuals 
and couples health education. 

Sexual  counseling  plays  a  significant  role  in  family 
health,  as  it  can  decrease  sexual  violence  in  the  family, 
prevent sexually transmitted diseases, result in a positive 
attitude towards sexual relations and sexual pleasure, de-
crease  conflicts  within  the  family,  and  gain  pleasurable 
sexual experience and sexual satisfaction. Consultation is 
a  process  that  helps  to  improve  sexual  health,  interper-
sonal relationships, affection, intimacy, body image, and 
gender roles. Sexual counseling is related to a cognitive 
domain  (information  and  knowledge),  affection  domain 
(feelings,  values,  and  attitudes),  and  behavioral  domain 
(communication skills and decision making) (7).

Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  is  today’s  most  popular 
and  widely-used  model  of  psychotherapy,  and  clinical 
studies have proven its efficiency in different populations 
and for treatment of various problems. This approach is 
characterized by short-term and problem-focused cogni-
tive  behavioral  intervention  strategies  that  are  retrieved 
from  science  and  cognitive  and  learning  theories  (8,  9). 
In cognitive behavioral approach, an individual learns to 
fight against his/her negative attitudes toward sexual is-
sues  and  improve  his/her  interpersonal  relationships  by 
utilizing  his/her  problem-solving  ability.  Moreover,  this 
approach  helps  to  promote  and  maintain  good  physical 
and mental feelings between the couples (10). 

Cognitive  behavioral  consultation  approach  is  one  of 
the  most  common  methods  of  treating  sexual  dysfunc-
tions (11). The term “cognitive behavioral consultation” 

Int J Fertil Steril, Vol 12, No 2, Jul-Sep 2018              100

is used to refer to an approach in which it is necessary to 
cope  with  overt  and  cognitive  components  of  behavior. 
Although traditional behavior therapies are still uniquely 
important, it is believed that intervention affects cognitive 
aspects of behavior. Most programs that are designed to 
treat sexual dysfunctions also use behavioral approaches 
and are based on this premise that cognitive change cause 
behavioral changes as well (12). 

This approach was created by combining behavior ther-
apy approach and cognitive approach either in the form of 
cognitive therapy or the framework of cognitive psychol-
ogy and basic cognitive science. In cognitive behavioral 
therapy, strengths of behavior therapy and cognitive ther-
apy, i.e. objectivism, evaluation, and assessment on one 
hand and the role of memory in reconstructing and inter-
preting data, on the other hand, are collected and become 
one  entity.  Nowadays,  this  approach  involves  relatively 
different theories and attitudes. Unlike other forms of be-
havior  therapies,  cognitive  behavioral  methods  directly 
deal with thoughts and feelings that are obviously signifi-
cant in all psychological disorders. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy fills the gap felt by most merely-behavioral meth-
ods and dynamic psychotherapy (13).

One of the main components of this therapy is present-
ing  sexual  knowledge  and  information  related  to  sexual 
response cycle, anatomy, and sexual techniques (14).

Therefore, due to the importance of sexual relationships and 
their effect on family and society health, significance of pres-
entation of educational and counseling programs in healthcare 
centers, and limited studies conducted to confirm the effec-
tiveness of this consultation on marital quality of individuals, 
the present study was done to examine the effect of cognitive 
behavioral consultation on marital quality among women re-
ferring to healthcare centers in Hamadan, Iran.

Materials and Methods 

The experimental study was carried out as a randomized 
clinical trial including an intervention group (n=99) and a 
control group (n=99) with a pretest and a posttest on qual-
ified  women  referring  to  selected  health  care  centers  of 
Hamadan. The sample size was calculated using formula,

groups were both equal to 16.1 according to reference (15), d 
was equal to 10 and Z indicated percentile of normal distribu-
tion which was calculated for indices 0.975 and 0.80. Based 
on this information, the sample size was determined to be 82 
in each group, and the final sample size was calculated as 198 
considering a 20% loss.

This  research  plan  with  codes  of  ethics  was  ac-
cepted  by  the  Chronic  Diseases  Research  Cent-
er,  Hamadan  University  of  Medical  Sciences,

Study inclusion criteria

Married women of 15-45 years old (reproductive age), 
Literacy,  Having    >6  months  of  married  life,  Hamadan 
residency,  No  background  of  remarkable  physical  and 
psychological  diseases  such  as  psychotic  disorders  like 
schizophrenia  and  severe  depression  that  need  special 
medicine  or  diet  and  filling  out  the  questionnaires,  age 
difference of 10 years between the couples.

Study exclusion criteria

Becoming  pregnant  during  the  study,  Unwillingness  to 
continue the trial, addiction to drugs and/or alcoholic drinks.
Subjects in control and intervention groups were randomly 
assigned to six health centers. Therefore, the relationship be-
tween the two groups was completely omitted. For this pur-
pose, three pairs of health centers (each pair consisted of 2 
centers that were similar in terms of social, economic, cultur-
al, and geographical characteristics) were randomly selected 
(one pair of centers was located in a city region with higher 
socioeconomic class, one in the middle socioeconomic class, 
and one in the higher socioeconomic class).

In  each  pair  of  centers,  one  was  assigned  to  the  in-
tervention  group  and  one  to  the  control  group.  In  other 
words, 3 centers were selected for the control group and 3 
for the intervention group. The sample size in each center 
was chosen to be 28 individuals, and due to the probable 
loss of 20%, 33 individuals were selected in each center, 
and  the  total  sample  size  became  33×6=198.  It  should 
be noted that the participants of each center were invited 
through a public invitation of participating in the research 
(the  inclusion  criteria  were  included  in  the  invitation) 
which could be found on the clinics’ bulletin. 

The participants were selected using a table of random 
numbers from women who referred to the clinic. After ap-
proval  of  the  Ethics  Committee  and  obtaining  informed 
consent  from  the  participants,  all  participants  were  em-
phatically  informed  that  participation  in  the  study  was 
completely  voluntary  and  they  were  able  to  quit  at  any 
stage  without  any  restrictions.  At  the  beginning  of  the 
study, all of the participants took a pretest.

In the pretest, the participants of both groups filled out the 
informed consent form, the demographic information ques-
tionnaire, and the marital quality scale. The demographic 
information  questionnaire  included  age,  education  level, 
job, spouse age, spouse education level, spouse job, family 
income  level,  marriage  duration,  number  of  pregnancies, 
number of children, and addiction background of the cou-
ple. Marital quality was measured using the marital qual-
ity standard questionnaire. This questionnaire includes 14 
questions and aims to evaluate marital quality from differ-
ent aspects (agreement, satisfaction, and solidarity). It was 
devised by Busby, Crane, Larson, and Christensen (16). 

This 14-question scale is scored through a 6-point Lik-
ert  scale  ranging  from  0  to  5  in  a  way  that  score  5  rep-
resents completely agree and score 0 indicates completely 
disagree. The tool consists of three subscales of agreement,

satisfaction, and solidarity and a high score indicates higher 
marital quality indicator. The subscale of agreement con-
sists of 6 items as follows: v. I always agree, iv. I almost 
always  agree,  iii.  I  sometimes  agree,  ii.  I  often  disagree, 
i. I almost always disagree, and 0. I always disagree. The 
subscale of satisfaction includes items 7 to 11 as follows: 0. 
Always, i. Most of the time, ii. Most often, iii. Sometimes, 
iv.  Hardly  ever,  and  v.  Never.  The  subscale  of  solidarity 
consists of items 12 to 14. Item 12 was scored using the fol-
lowing scale: v. Every day, iv. Almost every day, iii. Some-
times, ii. Almost sometimes, i. Hardly ever, and 0. Never, 
and the items 13 and 14 were scored using scales 0. Never, 
i. Less than once a month, ii. Once or twice a month, iii. 
Once or twice a week, iv. Once a day, and v. More. 

In order to obtain the scores related to each dimension, 
the  total  scores  of  questions  relevant  to  that  dimension 
were added up, and to calculate the total score of the ques-
tionnaire, the total scores of all questions were added up. 
Higher  scores  indicated  higher  marital  quality  and  vice 
versa. The tool used in the present study was a standard 
questionnaire of which validity and reliability were evalu-
ated in previous studies (16). Cronbach’s alpha reliability 
study of Hollist, Cody and Miller for three subscales of the 
agreement, satisfaction, and integrity, respectively was re-
ported 79, 80, and 90%. Internal consistency coefficient 
reliability Cronbach’s alpha of the total questionnaire was 
92%. The validity coefficient of 39% was obtained (17).

After  the  primary  assessments,  the  intervention  group 
was  provided  with  consultation  while  the  control  group 
received no intervention. The target consultation was pro-
vided  in  the  form  of  8  cognitive  behavioral  counseling 
sessions of 90 minutes for 8 weeks (18). Each session in-
volved questions and answers, lecturing, group discussion 
(in groups of maximum 10 individuals), and presentation 
of  teaching  slides.  In  order  to  provide  the  consultation, 
cognitive therapeutic method was used, and each session 
included  cognitive-behavioral  group  therapy  based  on 
eclectic cognitive-behavioral model (19), and the use of 
valid sexual resources.

Session 1 and 2 was identifying inefficient beliefs and ex-
plaining negative thoughts regarding sexual satisfaction and 
marital  quality,  and  psychological  training  was  examining 
the  cognitive  behavioral  model  and  introducing  cognitive 
distortion  regarding  sexual  dissatisfaction  and  unfavorable 
marital quality, homework was revising cognitive distortion.

Session 3 and 4 was examining the homework, and psycho-
logical training was examining the methods to fight against 
cognitive  distortion,  Homework  was  practicing  identifica-
tion of cognitive distortion using thoughts recording sheets.

Session 5 and 6 was examining the homework, and psy-
chological training was introducing coping and prevent-
ing methods of behaviors and thoughts leading to sexual 
dissatisfaction, Homework was cognitive reconstructing, 
completing  the  sheets  of  recording  thoughts,  practic-
ing  coping  and  preventing  inappropriate  behaviors  and 
thoughts.

Session  7  and  8  was  examining  the  homework,  and 
psychological training was discussing and examining the 
factors, preventing approaches, returning from sexual dis-
satisfaction, increasing sexual satisfaction, and improving 
marital quality, Homework was practicing preventing ap-
proaches to deal with return.

The sessions were held in a training class, and the in-
tervention  group  participants  were  informed  about  the 
date of attending the sessions by phone calls. Moreover, 
one day before the sessions, the individuals were remind-
ed about the sessions in order to prevent sample loss as 
much as possible. Consultation was provided by a clinical 
psychologist. Moreover, the trainers agreed to perform a 
uniform teaching method.

After  the  8th  session,  both  groups  took  the  posttest  in 
which  marital  quality  was  evaluated  again.  It  should  be 
noted  that  after  the  study,  a  session  about  sexual  issues 
was  held  for  the  control  group,  and  they  were  provided 
with booklets. In order to analyze the collected data, inde-
pendent samples t test and covariance analysis or change 
analysis were utilized. All of the tests were carried out at 
a confidence level of 95%.

Results

According to the results of the present study, the average 
age in the control group was 32.58 ± 7.54 years old and in 
the intervention group 35.04 ± 7.91 years old; so, the two 
groups were not homogenous in this regard. However, the 
two groups were homogenous in terms of husbands’ age 
in  the  intervention  group  (37.23  ±  8.01  years  old),  and 

in  the  control  group  (39.13  ±  7.18  years  old),  marriage 
duration in the intervention group (8.95 ± 7.67 years) and 
control group (8.49 ± 6.99 years), and number of children 
in the intervention group (1.53 ± 0.96) and control group 
(1.74 ± 0.86). Moreover, other demographic characteris-
tics such as the level of education in wives and husbands, 
and drug addiction in wives and husbands, were homoge-
neous in the two groups (P<0.05) (Table 1).

Covariance analysis was used in order to examine mari-
tal quality scores. In this analysis, after modification of the 
variables  of  age,  marital  quality  score  of  agreement  and 
satisfaction before the intervention, as well as income sta-
tus, marital quality scores were compared between the two 
groups.  Variance  analysis  and  regression  coefficients  are 
presented in Table 2. The value of determination coefficient 
was  calculated  as  0.85. After  the  intervention,  significant 
difference was observed between the two groups in all di-
mensions and total marital quality (P<0.05) and the mean 
scores of the dimensions increased remarkably (Table 2).

Here, t test was used to compare the two groups before 
intervention in order to verify if the two groups are different 
before the intervention, the effect of this difference should 
be adjusted when comparing them after intervention.  

According  to  the  determined  cut-off  points  based  on 
marital  quality  scale,  all  dimensions  and  total  marital 
quality, a limited number of women had a suitable level of 
marital quality before the intervention. After the interven-
tion, however, marital quality scores increased, and a sig-
nificant difference was observed between the two groups 
regarding all dimensions (P<0.05, Table 3).

Discussion

The  present  study  was  conducted  in  order  to  examine 
the effect of cognitive behavioral consultation on marital 
quality among women. The results indicated that cogni-
tive  behavioral  consultation  led  to  an  increase  in  total 
marital quality and all its dimensions (solidarity, satisfac-
tion, and agreement). The individuals had a low marital 
quality before the intervention; however, after the inter-
vention, the scores rose remarkably showing the efficacy 
of consultation in improving marital relationships. 

This means that cognitive behavioral consultation con-
cerning sexual issues, led to an increase in the total score 
and  dimensions  of  marital  quality  in  the  intervention 
group.  Previously, Young  and  Carlson  (20)  showed  that 
cognitive  behavioral  marital  consultation  can  affect  the 

quality of the individuals’ marriage, which is in line with 
the present study.

In the present study, during the sessions, the wives were 
taught to solve their sexual and marital problems with the 
help of their husbands. When the problem is regarded as 
a joint issue, a single individual is not considered as the 
cause, and the couples become aware of their roles in the 
emergence of the problem, so, they stop blaming one an-
other, and there will be less argument between them.

Numerous  indices  are  used  to  show  marital  quality. 
Perry (21) proposed satisfaction with marriage, spending 
time together, management of conflicts, prediction of di-
vorce possibility, and frequency of conflicts between the 
couples as marital quality indices.

Satisfaction  with  sexual  relationships  is  an  important

factor in marital relationships. Individuals who are highly 
satisfied with the sexual relationship they have with their 
spouses,  have  a  remarkably  higher  quality  of  life,  ex-
press  higher  love  and  interest  to  their  spouse,  and  have 
higher levels of agreement, solidarity, and satisfaction in 
their marital relationships (22). In this regard, Khajeh et 
al. (23) and Mangeli (24) indicated the positive effect of 
sexual counseling on improving marital relationships and 
satisfaction.

Regarding  marital  satisfaction  and  improvement  of 
marital quality in dimensions of solidarity and agreement, 
the wife’s and husband’s understanding of one another’s 
behavior is significantly important. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy  tries  to  fix  the  incorrect  attitude  toward  spouse 
and  wrong  myths  about  marital  relationships  and  cre-
ate skills to establish more effective communication and 
problem solving (25). 

In a study, Akbarzadeh (26) indicated that cognitive be-
havioral education of the couples was effective in family 
performance and subscales of problem solving, commu-
nication,  emotional  companionship,  emotional  involve-
ment,  and  behavior  control  among  divorced  applicants. 
Cognitive foundations of cognitive behavioral therapy of 
couples  highlight  the  couples’  understanding  of  one  an-
other  and  consider  understanding  as  an  inseparable  part 
of change in couples.  Finally, the philosophical founda-
tion of this understanding is that change in behavior alone 
is not enough to correct inefficient interactions and there 
should  be  an  emphasis  on  how  individuals  think  about 
their relationships and their incompatible behavioral pat-
terns (27).

In the study of Khanjani Veshki et al. (28), carried out 
on  30  women  referring  to  counseling  centers  in  Qom, 
Iran,  researchers  utilized  a  researcher-designed  marital 
quality  questionnaire  and  6  sessions  of  sex  education. 
They showed that the intervention could improve marital 
quality and its dimensions. Due to the role of sexual rela-
tions in consolidating marital relationships and its quality, 
marital consultation leads to an increase in sexual satis-
faction,  and  the  women  participating  in  the  educational 
programs reach higher sexual pleasure and express more 
passion and affection in their marital relationships. 

Moreover,  Salimi  and  Fatehizadeh  (29)  showed  that 
sex education by cognitive behavioral method enhances 
the  married  women’s  knowledge,  self-expression,  and 
sexual intimacy, which is in line with the results of the 
present study.

With regard to the significance of our results, it can be 
stated that the cognitive behavioral sex consultation used 
in the present study could improve all dimensions of mar-
ital relationships by emphasizing on cognitive dimensions 
of  sex  consultation  such  as  pinpointing  and  challenging 
the common sexual wrong beliefs through group discus-
sion,  determination  and  improvement  of  individuals  at-
titude toward sexual activity, presentation of realities and 
importance of satisfying sexual desires, the role of sexual

relation in general relationships and quality dimensions of 
marital relationships.

In  the  cultural  context  of  Iranian  society,  women  and 
men  have  poor  and  inaccurate  sexual  knowledge,  and 
do  not  have  access  to  reliable  sources  in  this  regard. 
Moreover,  they  have  a  lot  of  incompatible  and  illogical 
thoughts,  beliefs,  attitudes,  and  understanding  of  sexual 
issues which affect the couples’ sexual relation. In cogni-
tive behavioral approach, attention is paid to sex educa-
tion as Iranian couples had not obtained this knowledge 
by a reliable method (30, 31). According to the mentioned 
issues,  it  is  determined  that  in  the  Iranian  culture,  pay-
ing  attention  to  cognitive  factors  is  highly  important  to 
resolve sexual problems, dysfunction, and dissatisfaction, 
and neglecting them leads to a decrease in treatment suc-
cess. 

Cognitive behavioral family therapy training equip the 
couples  with  skills  which  are  necessary  for  marital  life, 
and can be generalized to other levels of marital and social 
levels of life. According to the Iranian culture and since 
an extensive range of treatment techniques and methods is 
used, cognitive behavioral method can be effectively em-
ployed as an extensive method to treat behavioral prob-
lems and positively change couples. Using a large popula-
tion size from various clinics of the city was the strength 
of the present study, and failure to follow them after the 
study was one of its limitations.

Due to the effectiveness of the method used in the pre-
sent study, it is suggested that techniques of this approach 
could  be  utilized  by  family  and  marriage  counselors  to 
increase  sexual  satisfaction,  solve  marital  conflicts  and 
improve  marital  quality  of  the  couples’  life.  Moreover, 
the applicable drills and skills of this method in the form 
of educational sessions, workshop, videos, and pamphlets 
should be employed to prevent marital problems.

Conclusion

Due to the role of sexual relations in consolidating mar-
ital life, cognitive behavioral consultation as an effective 
method for improving marital quality, especially after an 
agreement, can be employed in health care centers to im-
prove the couples’ relationship and reduce divorce rates.
