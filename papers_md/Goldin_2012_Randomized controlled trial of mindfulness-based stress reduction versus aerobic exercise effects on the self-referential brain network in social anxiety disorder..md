Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by distorted self-views. The
goal of this study was to examine whether mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
alters behavioral and brain measures of negative and positive self-views. Methods: Fifty-
six adult patients with generalized SAD were randomly assigned to MBSR or a comparison
aerobic exercise (AE) program. A self-referential encoding task was administered at base-
line and post-intervention to examine changes in behavioral and neural responses in the
self-referential brain network during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were
cued to decide whether positive and negative social trait adjectives were self-descriptive
or in upper case font. Results: Behaviorally, compared to AE, MBSR produced greater
decreases in negative self-views, and equivalent increases in positive self-views. Neu-
rally, during negative self versus case, compared to AE, MBSR led to increased brain
responses in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). There were no differential changes for
positive self versus case. Secondary analyses showed that changes in endorsement of
negative and positive self-views were associated with decreased social anxiety symptom
severity for MBSR, but not AE. Additionally, MBSR-related increases in dorsomedial pre-
frontal cortex (DMPFC) activity during negative self-view versus case were associated with
decreased social anxiety related disability and increased mindfulness. Analysis of neural
temporal dynamics revealed MBSR-related changes in the timing of neural responses
in the DMPFC and PCC for negative self-view versus case. Conclusion: These ﬁndings
suggest that MBSR attenuates maladaptive habitual self-views by facilitating automatic
(i.e., uninstructed) recruitment of cognitive and attention regulation neural networks. This
highlights potentially important links between self-referential and cognitive-attention regu-
lation systems and suggests that MBSR may enhance more adaptive social self-referential
processes in patients with SAD.

INTRODUCTION
Self-views can powerfully inﬂuence how a person thinks, feels, and
behaves, particularly in social contexts. The relationship of self-
views to social functioning is especially salient in the clinical con-
text of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Cognitive models of social
anxiety (Clark and Wells, 1995) suggest that distorted self-views,
speciﬁcally, regarding the self as socially awkward, inadequate, or
ﬂawed are an essential feature of SAD. Recent conceptualizations
highlight distorted social self-views as the core problem in SAD
(Moscovitch, 2009). These models suggest that maladaptive social
self-reﬂective processes are implicated in cognitively biased evalu-
ations of self which generate negative emotions, disrupt emotion
regulation, and interfere with social self-efﬁcacy and performance
(Spurr and Stopa, 2002).

Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies of self-referential pro-
cessing in healthy adults have identiﬁed a set of three cortical
midline brain regions that comprise the self-referential network
(SRN), including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),

dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and posterior cingu-
late cortex/precuneus (hereafter abbreviated as PCC; Figure 1;
Northoff et al., 2006, 2011). To induce activation in the SRN,
studies have used judgments of visually presented trait adjectives
(Kelley et al., 2002), aurally presented statements (Johnson et al.,
2002), or mental reﬂection on self-traits (Kjaer et al., 2002). Most
studies have used tasks that require making a rapid judgment
of whether or not a speciﬁc trait applies to oneself. Speciﬁcally,
neural activity in the VMPFC has been shown to be related to rat-
ings of self-relatedness (Phan et al., 2004; de Greck et al., 2008).
Activation of the DMPFC and PCC has been observed during
self-endorsement of positive and negative traits in healthy adults
(Fossati et al., 2003).

Neuroimaging studies of self-referential processing have begun
to investigate abnormal patterns of SRN activity in a variety
of clinical samples, however, results are mixed. In patients with
major depressive disorder, fMRI investigations have reported ele-
vated VMPFC activation during event-related task designs which

modulation of attention regulation, body awareness, emotion
regulation, and self-views (Hölzel et al., 2011). Thus, MBSR is
expected to decrease grasping at conceptual self-views (instanti-
ated in the SRN and language brain networks) and to increase
present-moment experiential modes of self-processing (instanti-
ated in viscerosomatic networks). The impact of MBSR on the
SRN in clinical populations, however, is not yet understood.

In patients with SAD, MBSR has been shown to modulate
attention regulation, emotion regulation, and self-views (Goldin
et al., 2009a, 2012; Goldin and Gross, 2010). Neurally, during
self-referential processing in patients with SAD, MBSR has been
shown to decrease neural responses in brain regions related to
self-referential and language processing for positive self-views, and
increase responses in brain regions linked to attention engagement
and regulation for negative self-views (Goldin et al., 2009a). This
study also reported associations of pre-to-post-MBSR increases in
attention engagement related parietal brain regions and decreases
in anxiety symptoms. However, important caveats of these stud-
ies include a small sample size, participant self-selection, and no
active comparison intervention. Thus, the implementation of a
RCT with two active and dose matched stress reduction programs
should support stronger inferences about the effects of MBSR on
self-views.

In addition to modulation of brain response magnitude, there
is growing evidence of abnormal neural temporal dynamics dur-
ing social cognition and emotion regulation in patients with
SAD (Campbell et al., 2007; Goldin et al., 2009b). One study
has reported MBSR-related changes in neural temporal dynamics
of emotional reactivity to negative self-views in adults with SAD
(Goldin and Gross, 2010). Currently, nothing is known about how
MBSR impacts the neural temporal dynamics of brain responses
within the SRN. Analysis of neural temporal dynamics might elu-
cidate the effects of MBSR on other cognitive processes that come
online in patients with SAD when engaging to self-referential
processing, such as shifts in attention regulation and cognitive
regulation of emotional reactivity to self-views.

Considered together, these changes suggest that MBSR likely
modulates multiple cognitive processes. MBSR is hypothesized to
increase the ability to decenter from habitual patterns of reactivity.
However, in the case of adults with SAD, MBSR may have more
speciﬁc effects such as modifying some of the core cognitive biases
(e.g., distorted self-views, maladaptive attention, and emotional
processing, deﬁcient cognitive regulation) that are fundamental
features of social anxiety.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the differential
effects of MBSR versus an active control condition [aerobic exer-
cise (AE) stress reduction] on the neural bases of self-referential
processing in patients with generalized SAD in the context of a
RCT. MBSR cultivates a non-judgmental, pliable present-moment
awareness that decreases habitual patterns of evaluation and reac-
tivity, and increases psychological ﬂexibility. In patients with SAD,
MBSR is associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression
and self-deprecation, and increased quality of life and functionality
(Koszycki et al., 2007). A recent review suggests that the brain-
based mechanisms underlying MBSR include attention regulation,
body awareness, emotion regulation, and changes in the self-views
(Hölzel et al., 2011). Few studies, however, have investigated these

is thought to be associated with more automatic alerting to
self-relevant information, as well as elevated transient DMPFC
activation during block task designs which may represent more
strategic evaluation (Lemogne et al., 2012). In patients with SAD,
fMRI investigations have observed SRN activation during self-
referential processing of trait adjectives, as well as brain regions
implicated in language, memory, affective, and visual processing
during social trait self-endorsement (Goldin et al., 2009a), and
decreased VMPFC response for ﬁrst (versus second) person self-
referential statements which were associated with increased social
anxiety symptom severity (Blair et al., 2011). However, there are
no randomized controlled trials (RCT) that have compared the
impact of different psychosocial interventions on SRN activity in
patients with SAD. Conducting such RCTs may provide stronger
evidence for the function and modulation of the SRN in clinical
samples.

One especially intriguing psychosocial

intervention that
directly cultivates non-identiﬁcation with self-views is mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Meta-analyses
of MBSR training in healthy adults have shown reliable reduc-
tions in symptoms of anxiety, stress, and ruminative thinking
(Chiesa and Serretti, 2009). Among patients with anxiety dis-
orders, meta-analysis indicates robust reduction of anxiety, and
depression symptoms (Vollestad et al., 2012). An important fMRI
study of self-reference in a non-clinical sample of adults found
that for the contrast of experiential (versus narrative) self-focus
MBSR resulted in brain response decreases in anterior VMPFC
and DMPFC regions and increases in a right lateralized net-
work including dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC, insular cortex,
supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior parietal lobule sug-
gesting suppression of conceptual narrative self-processing, and
enhancement of viscerosomatic processing and present-moment
focused attention (Farb et al., 2007). Inferences from this study
are limited because brain responses were measured only at post-
MBSR. In the few studies of patients with SAD, there are pre-
liminary positive results for MBSR training, including reduction
of clinical symptoms and increased well-being (Koszycki et al.,
2007; Jazaieri et al., 2012). Proposed mechanisms of MBSR include

proposed brain-based mechanisms in the context of a RCT. To
do this, we choose AE as a control condition for several reasons.
Like MBSR, AE has been shown to improve both physical and
mental health (Penedo and Dahn, 2005), especially symptoms of
stress, depression, and anxiety (Petruzzello et al., 1991; Stich, 1998;
Ströhle, 2009) in clinical samples of mixed anxiety (e.g., Merom
et al., 2007), panic disorder (e.g., Broocks et al., 1998; Dratcu,
2001), and generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., Steptoe et al., 1989;
McEntee and Halgin, 1999). As implemented in this study, we
matched the amount of individual and group practice for MBSR
and AE. Presently, there are no studies describing the impact of AE
on self-views in patients with SAD.

We conducted a RCT in which we obtained behavioral and
neural measures of self-views during an fMRI assessment in
patients with generalized SAD before and after MBSR or AE. For
behavioral responses, we expected that, compared to AE, MBSR
would result in self-endorsement of more adaptive self-views,
namely, greater decreases in negative and greater increases in pos-
itive self-views. For neural responses, based on prior studies that
reported reduction in cortical midline brain region responses dur-
ing experiential (versus narrative) self-focus (Farb et al., 2007) and
during self-referential processing in patients with SAD (Goldin
et al., 2009a), we expected that, compared to AE, MBSR would
result in greater reductions during negative and positive self-
referential processing in the VMPFC and DMPFC. Based on pre-
vious reports of MBSR-related increased activity in parietal cortex
regions associated with attention engagement and regulation in
general (Farb et al., 2007; Hölzel et al., 2011) and speciﬁcally in
patients with SAD (Goldin et al., 2009a; Goldin and Gross, 2010),
we expected that, compared to AE, MBSR would result in greater
increases in PCC during negative and positive self-referential pro-
cessing. In secondary analyses, we examined whether MBSR and
AE-related changes in behavioral and brain responses related to
changes in clinical symptoms and mindfulness, and how MBSR
impacted the neural temporal dynamics in the three SRN brain
regions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
Participants were unmedicated patients seeking treatment for SAD
who met DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) crite-
ria for generalized SAD. Of 316 individuals assessed for eligibility,
260 were excluded (173 for not meeting study criteria, 66 for other
reasons, and 21 declined to participate). The remaining 56 par-
ticipants were randomly assigned to either MBSR (n = 31) or AE
(n = 25; Figure 2). Groups did not differ in gender, age, ethnic-
ity, or education (Table 1). fMRI assessments at both baseline
and post-intervention were available for 24 MBSR and 18 AE
participants.

Patients passed an MR safety screen and had to be medication
and psychotherapy-free for at least 6 months with no history of
medical disorders or head trauma. Patients had to have a primary
diagnosis of generalized SAD and no evidence of thought dis-
orders, bipolar depression, alcohol, or drug dependence. Patients
were not permitted to be currently in any form of pharmacologi-
cal or psychological treatment. Patients were excluded if they had
previously completed an MBSR course or if they had a regular

meditation practice or AE regime (deﬁned as three or more times
per week, for more than 2 months). Patients randomized to MBSR
and AE did not differ in current or past Axis-I comorbidity, current
Global Assessment of Functioning or Clinical Global Impression,
and past psychotherapy or past pharmacotherapy (Table 1).

PROCEDURE
Patients were recruited through web-based community listings
and referrals from mental health providers. After passing a tele-
phone screening, potential participants were administered the
ADIS-IV-L (Di Nardo et al., 1994) by a clinical psychologist. We
enrolled patients with a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD
operationalized as (a) moderate or higher severity (≥4 on a scale
of 0–8) on the ADIS-IV-L Clinician’s Severity Rating for SAD and
(b) social fear for ﬁve or more distinct social or performance sit-
uations in the SAD section. Patients were randomly assigned to
MBSR or AE using a biased coin randomization procedure (Efron,
1971) which entails higher probability of allocation to the group
with fewer participants. This method controls for potential con-
founds encountered when a greater number of participants are
assigned at speciﬁc time points during a trial to one of two inter-
ventions. Patients were administered self-report clinical and fMRI
scanning assessments before and after MBSR and AE. All partici-
pants provided informed consent in accordance with the Stanford
University Human Subjects Committee and federal guidelines.

MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION
Mindfulness-based stress reduction consisted of eight, weekly 2.5 h
group classes, a 1-day meditation retreat, and daily home practice.
Patients were trained in formal meditation, informal practice, and
Hatha yoga. Daily logs were collected each week to measure group
and individual meditation and yoga practice. Patients attended
MBSR courses offered by seven different teachers in eight health-
care settings throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Instructors
had an average of 15.7 years (SD = 4.1 years, range = 10–20 years)
of MBSR teaching experience.

AEROBIC EXERCISE
To match the individual and group components of MSBR, par-
ticipants in the 8-week AE intervention were provided a 2-month
gym membership and were required to complete weekly at least
two individual AE sessions and one group AE session (other than
meditation or yoga).

SELF-REFERENTIAL ENCODING TASK
The self-referential encoding task (SRET; Derry and Kuiper, 1981)
is considered an information processing measure of self-schema.
Stimuli consisted of 25 positive and 25 negative social trait
adjectives from the Affective Norms of Emotion Words data-
base (Bradley and Lang, 1999), balanced (all ps > 0.51) on word
frequency (positive adjectives = 40.5, negative adjectives = 33.6)
and number of letters (positive adjectives = 6.9, negative adjec-
tives = 7.2), as well as on arousal (positive adjectives = 5.54, nega-
tive adjectives = 5.43 on a scale of 1 = low to 9 = high using) and
valence (deviation from neutral: positive adjectives = 2.66, nega-
tive adjectives = 2.58 on a scale of 1 = most negative, 5 = neutral,
9 = most positive) based on the nine-point Self-Assessment
Manikin rating system (Lang, 1980).

The SRET was 5 min and 39 s in length. Each adjective was pre-
sented twice, once in each of two conditions. The self-referential
condition assessed self-focused social-evaluative processing. Case
identiﬁcation was used as a comparison condition to control
for reading negative and positive adjectives while determin-
ing whether the word consisted of upper or lower case letters.
Each of the four trial types (two conditions by two valences)
included ﬁve blocks. Each block consisted of ﬁxation, question
(either “Describes ME?” or “UPPER case?”), and ﬁve adjec-
tives of the same valence presented one at a time for 3 s each
(Figure 3).

Stimulus order included a pseudo-random block sequence with
no more than two blocks of the same condition in a row and a ran-
dom sequence of words and upper/lower case within each block.
Patients pressed buttons to indicate whether or not a word was
self-descriptive or in uppercase letters.

MEASURES OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND MINDFULNESS
To measure severity of social anxiety symptoms, we used the
24-item Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report (LSAS-SR;

Liebowitz, 1987; Fresco et al., 2001), which consists of questions
that assess social interaction situations (11 items) and perfor-
mance situations (13 items). A four-point Likert-type scale is used
for ratings of fear and of avoidance, with a range from 0 (none
and never, respectively) to 3 (severe and usually, respectively) for
situations during the past week. Ratings are summed for a total
LSAS-SR score (range = 0–144). The LSAS-SR has reliability and
construct validity (Rytwinski et al., 2009) and its internal consis-
tency (Cronbach’s alpha) for this study was 0.90 in MBSR and 0.90
in AE.

To measure social anxiety related disability, we administered
the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan, 1983) which mea-
sures work, social life, and family life impairment as a function
of SAD and comorbid conditions, and has demonstrated good
internal consistency and validity (Hambrick et al., 2004), and its
internal consistency in this study was 0.68 in MBSR and 0.68
in AE.

To measure mindfulness, we used the Kentucky Inventory of
Mindfulness Skills (FFMQ; Baer, 2003). It is a 39-item self-report
measure which measures mindfulness, and includes four compo-
nents: observing, describing, acting with awareness, and accepting
without judgment. Items are rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. The
instrument has good internal consistency and validity (Baer et al.,
2004), and its internal consistency in this study was 0.76 in MBSR
and 0.85 in AE.

To measure the potential confound of social desirability, we
administered the 10-item Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability
Scale (MCSDS; Crowne and Marlowe, 1960). The instrument con-
sists of true-false items with four reverse coded items, with higher
scores reﬂecting a greater tendency to give a socially desirable
response. It has shown adequate internal consistency and reliability
(Crino et al., 1983).

fMRI ACQUISITION
Imaging was performed on a General Electric 3 T Signa mag-
net using a custom-built quadrature “dome” elliptical bird
cage head coil and a T2∗-weighted gradient echo spiral-in/out
pulse sequence that used blood oxygenation level-dependent
(BOLD) contrast. Head movement was minimized using a
bite bar and padding. During a single run, 226 volumes
(each consisting of 22 sequential axial slices) were obtained
(TR = 1500 ms, TE = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 60, FOV = 22 cm, fre-
quency encoding = 64, voxel = 3.438 mm × 4.5 mm). A high-
resolution anatomical scan was acquired using a fast spin-
echo spoiled grass pulse sequence (voxel = 0.85942 mm × 1.2 mm;
FOV = 22 cm, frequency encoding = 256).

fMRI DATA PREPROCESSING
Analysis of functional neuroimages (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996)
was used for preprocessing and statistical analysis. Preprocessing
included an analysis of potential outliers, volume registration to
a base image, motion correction, 4 mm3 isotropic Gaussian spa-
tial smoothing, high-pass ﬁltering (0.011 Hz), linear detrending,
and conversion into percentage change in each voxel. No vol-
umes demonstrated motion in the x, y, or z directions in excess of
±0.8 mm. There was no stimulus-correlated motion, as assessed by

correlations between condition-speciﬁc reference functions and x,
y, z motion correction parameters (all ps > 0.48).

fMRI STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Multiple-regression was implemented with AFNI 3dDeconvolve
and included baseline parameters to remove mean, linear, and
quadratic trends, and motion-related variance in the BOLD sig-
nal. Regressors for the negative self, negative case, positive self,
and positive case were convolved with the gamma variate model
(Cohen, 1997) of the hemodynamic response function. Functional
MRI BOLD signal intensity was computed as percentage of signal
change [(MR signal per voxel per time point/mean MR signal in
that voxel for the entire functional run) × 100]. Brain maps were
converted to Talairach atlas space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988)
and second-level group statistical parametric maps were produced
according to a random-effects model.

Repeated-measures analysis of variance with planned follow-
up t -tests was conducted to examine average BOLD responses in
masks for each of the three cortical midline SRN regions (VMPFC,
DMPFC, and PCC). The a priori rectangular region-of-interest
masks were deﬁned by a meta-analysis of 27 neuroimaging studies
(Northoff et al., 2006). The Talairach coordinates of the bound-
aries of the three rectangular masks are: VMPFC x = −12 to 8,
y = 38–60, z = −7 to 21, DMPFC: x = −14 to 12, y = −11 to 31,
z = 37–61, and PCC: x = −14 to 8, y = −74 to −48, z = 10–52.

For the examination of pre-to-post-intervention changes in
the temporal dynamics in each region we used repeated-measures
ANOVA with the Greenhouse–Geisser correction for potential vio-
lations of sphericity in the time course of 10 time points (or 15 s
per trial).

We also conducted whole-brain t -tests to examine within-
group changes pre-to-post-MBSR and AE, separately, on negative
and positive self-views. We used AlphaSim, a Monte Carlo simula-
tion bootstrapping program in the AFNI library, to protect against
false positive cluster detection (Forman et al., 1995). The pro-
gram determined that a voxel-wise p < 0.001 threshold and cluster
volume threshold of ≤213 mm3 (4 voxels × 3.438 mm × 4.5 mm)
provided protection against false positive cluster detection at
p < 0.01.

RESULTS
CLINICAL RESPONSES
As shown in Table 2, both MBSR and AE yielded signiﬁcant
reductions in social anxiety symptom severity (LSAS-SR; t s > 4.05,
ps < 0.001), SAD-related disability (SDS; t s > 2.29, ps < 0.05), and
increases in mindfulness (KIMS; t s > 2.26, ps < 0.05). However,
there were no between-group differences in pre-to-post change (all
ps > 0.34). A full account of the treatment-related self-reported
changes in clinical and well-being measures has been published
elsewhere (Jazaieri et al., 2012).

To rule out the possibility of a social desirability response
bias on self-report measures, we examined the relation-
ship of

no main effect of group (p > 0.25), a main effect of

p = 0.63), and an interaction of group
by time (F = 4.50, p < 0.05, η2

(change = −15.5, t = 3.84, p < 0.002, η2

BRAIN RESPONSES
Manipulation check
To conﬁrm that the SRET task induced activation of the corti-
cal midline SRN, we examined BOLD responses for negative and
positive self-views, separately, across all patients at baseline. There
was evidence of robust activations in VMPFC, DMPFC, and PCC
regions for the contrasts of negative self versus case and positive
self versus case (Figure 5).

Treatment-related changes in the self-referential network
We conducted a 2 Group (MBSR, AE) × 2 Time (pre, post)
repeated-measures ANOVA of BOLD responses in each of the
three SRN a priori ROIs (DMPFC, VMPFC, PCC) for the con-
trasts of negative self (versus case) and positive self (versus case),
separately.

Negative self-view
For the DMPFC, there were no main effects of time (p > 0.14)
or group (p > 0.89), but there was a signiﬁcant interaction of
group by time (F = 8.87, p < 0.005, η2
p = 0.18). Follow-up
paired t -tests showed no signiﬁcant change in BOLD signal
from pre-to-post-MBSR (change = 0.03, p > 0.29, η2
p = 0.4)
and a decrease from pre-to-post-AE (change = −0.10, t = 3.62,
p = 0.002, η2
p = 0.45; Figure 6). For the VMPFC, there were
no main or interaction effects (all ps > 0.35). For the PCC, there
were no main effects of time (p > 0.82) or group (p > 0.17), and
a signiﬁcant interaction of group by time (F = 6.29, p < 0.05,
η2
p = 0.13). Follow-up t -tests showed an increase from pre-to-
post-MBSR (change = 0.09, t = 2.16, p < 0.05, η2
p = 0.16) and
no signiﬁcant change in AE (change = −0.07, p > 0.15, η2
p =
0.12).

Positive self-view
There were no main or interaction effects (all ps > 0.10) in the
VMPFC, DMPFC, and PCC.

SECONDARY ANALYSES
We examined whether MBSR and AE-related changes in behav-
ioral and brain responses were related to changes in clinical symp-
toms and mindfulness, and also tested how MBSR impacted the
neural temporal dynamics in the three SRN brain regions for the
contrast of negative self versus case. For completeness, we also
report the within-group effects of MBSR and AE, separately, on
whole-brain responses for negative and positive self-referential
processing.

Association of behavioral responses and clinical symptoms
For behavioral responses, decrease in self-endorsement of neg-
ative self-views was associated with decrease in social anxiety
symptom severity (LSAS-SR) from pre-to-post-MBSR (r = 0.85,
p < 0.001), but not AE (r = 0.00, p > 0.99; Z diff = 2.48, p = 0.013).
Increase in self-endorsement of positive self-views was associated
with decrease in social anxiety symptom severity from pre-to-
post-MBSR (r = −0.94, p < 0.001), but not from pre-to-post-
AE (r = −0.11, p > 0.73; Z diff = 3.25, p = 0.001). There was no
relationship with mindfulness (KIMS).

Association of brain responses and clinical symptoms/mindfulness
For the contrast of self-endorsement of negative self (versus
case), increases in DMPFC activity were associated with (a)
decreased social anxiety related disability (SDS) from pre-to-post-
MBSR (r = −0.58, p < 0.05; Figure A1 in Appendix) and AE
(r = −0.63, p < 0.05) and (b) increased mindfulness (KIMS) in
MBSR (r = 0.60, p < 0.05; Figure A2 in Appendix), but not in AE
(r = 0.35, p > 0.43; Z diff = 0.80, p > 0.42). For the contrast of self-
endorsement of positive self (versus case), decreases in DMPFC
activity were associated with increased mindfulness (KIMS) in
MBSR (r = −0.53, p < 0.05; Figure A3 in Appendix) but not in
AE (r = 0.21, p > 0.65; Z diff = 1.98, p < 0.05).

Neural temporal dynamics
For the contrast of negative self (versus case) in the MBSR
group, we conducted a 2 Group (MBSR, AE) × 2 Time (pre,
post) × 10 TRs (ten 1.5 s TRs or brain volume acquisitions)
repeated-measures ANOVA with Greenhouse–Geisser correction
on BOLD responses for each of the three SRN brain regions.

In the DMPFC,

there was not a three-way interaction
(p > 0.18). However, there was a group by time interaction
(F = 8.87, p < 0.005, η2
p = 0.18; Figure 7). Paired t -tests compar-
ing BOLD response at each time point in the 15-s blocks showed
signiﬁcant increases from pre-to-post-MBSR in the middle of the
15-s blocks and signiﬁcant decreases from pre-to-post-AE in the
early and later segments of blocks.

In the VMPFC, there were no three- or two-way interactions

(all ps > 0.35).

In the PCC, there was not a three-way interaction (p > 0.08).
However, there was an interaction of group by time (F = 6.29,
p < 0.05, η2
p = 0.13). Paired t -tests comparing BOLD response
at each time point in the 15-s blocks again showed signiﬁcant

and signiﬁcant decreases from pre-to-post-AE in the early segment
of blocks.

Treatment-related changes in whole-brain
For MBSR, a paired t -test yielded pre-to-post BOLD signal
increases for negative self (versus case) in ventromedial, left ven-
trolateral, and bilateral dorsolateral PFC, PCC/precuneus, left
inferior parietal lobule, and left posterior superior temporal gyrus
(Table A1 in Appendix). The contrast of positive self (versus case)
yielded BOLD signal increases in anterior and posterior ventrome-
dial, dorsomedial, right ventrolateral, and left anterior dorsolateral
PFC, as well as subcortical uncus. For AE, a paired t -test revealed
no signiﬁcant pre-to-post BOLD signal increases for negative self

(versus case), and increased responses in only the left mid-insula
for positive self (versus case Table A2 in Appendix).

DISCUSSION
The primary goal of this study was to investigate in the context of
a RCT how MBSR, compared to an active comparison program
(AE stress reduction), impacted behavioral and neural indicators
of self-views in unmedicated adult patients with generalized SAD.
Clinically, both MBSR and AE signiﬁcantly reduced social anx-
iety symptoms and disability, and enhanced mindfulness skills.
Previous studies have shown similar MBSR-related improvements
in patients with SAD (Goldin et al., 2009a; Goldin and Gross,
2010). While resistance and AE training have shown promise in
reducing worry symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety

disorders (Herring et al., 2012), this is the ﬁrst study to demon-
strate in an RCT that short-term (2 months) AE training reduces
social anxiety symptom severity and disability inpatients with gen-
eralized SAD. The increase in mindfulness skills may be related
to enhanced attention to and awareness of sensations related to

instantiating a regular physical exercise practice. Some portion of
the effect of AE in this study may also be related to social fear expo-
sure occurring when exercising in a public gym facility. Ostensibly,
patients with SAD may have experienced habituation or extinction
of their social fears over repeated incidental exposures in the gym.

Importantly, none of the self-report measures were associated with
a measure of social desirability response bias, which excludes the
potential confounds associated with self-report questionnaires and
treatment efﬁcacy expectations.

For the self-referential processing task (i.e., SRET), we exam-
ined self-endorsement and neural responses during positive and
negative self-views. Behaviorally, MBSR and AE yielded signiﬁcant
self-endorsement decreases in negative and increases in positive
self-views. However, compared to AE, MBSR resulted in (a) greater
reduction in self-endorsement of negative self-views, (b) which
was related to reduction in social anxiety symptom severity. Inter-
estingly, increased mindfulness was not associated with changes
in self-views. These ﬁndings suggest that chronically distorted
social self-views in patients with SAD are modiﬁed during MSBR
and that more adaptive self-views are related to clinical symp-
tom improvement. Prior studies have also observed MBSR-related
enhancement of more adaptive social self-views in patients with
SAD (Goldin et al., 2009a).

Several mindfulness skills are trained in MBSR. One speciﬁc
mindfulness skill that may modify self-views is decentering. This
refers to non-identiﬁcation with thoughts and beliefs, and active
disengagement from ruminative self-evaluations and judgments
(Fresco et al., 2007). Decentering can be understood as a cognitive
process that results in attenuating habitual grasping at thoughts
and beliefs as accurate reﬂections of the self. It has been pro-
posed as a core mechanism of mindfulness meditation training
(Segal et al., 2002; Ramel et al., 2004), that may account for the

MBSR-related modiﬁcation of self-views. However, the effects of
decentering may manifest in different ways in different popula-
tions. In non-anxious healthy controls, decentering may appear as
less identiﬁcation with any self-concept. In the clinical context of
SAD, however, MBSR-related increases in decentering may have a
different initial impact. Speciﬁcally, in patients with SAD who have
had life-long problems with inaccurate (i.e., exaggerated negative
self-beliefs) and maladaptive (i.e., viewing the self as unworthy
and incapable of change) self-views, MBSR might ﬁrst re-establish
more adaptive self-views (i.e., lesser negative, greater positive self-
views) as a foundation for later inducing more subtle changes
related to decentering and non-identiﬁcation with any and all con-
ceptual self-views (which is one of several more advanced result
of mindfulness meditation practice).

Neurally, the manipulation check of the SRET task at baseline
conﬁrmed robust BOLD signal for positive and negative self-views
in the expected cortical midline brain regions implicated in the
SRN. Examination of differential change as a function of treatment
modality revealed signiﬁcant interactions during negative self (ver-
sus case) characterized by MBSR-related increased responses in the
PCC and DMPFC. Examination of BOLD signal time series data
showed greater recruitment of DMPFC and PCC activity in the
middle portion of each 15 s block during negative self-processing
from pre-to-post-MBSR. There was no signiﬁcant effect of positive
self (versus case). Thus, in alignment with our predictions, we did
ﬁnd increased attention-related PCC/precuneus response follow-
ing MBSR, but did not ﬁnd decreased BOLD response in more

conceptual and cognitive control brain regions, as hypothesized,
in the VMPFC and DMPFC.

Interestingly, recent research in developmental cognitive neu-
roscience suggests that SRN activation during self-reﬂection is
considered a sign of healthy cognitive functioning and reﬂects
the ability to sustain internal self-focused attention – an impor-
tant component of self-regulation. In contrast, low levels of SRN
activation have been identiﬁed as a risk factor for the develop-
ment of psychological disorders and impaired social functioning
(Schneider et al., 2012). Furthermore, insufﬁcient activation of the
SRN and brain networks that support socioemotional processes
(speciﬁcally mentalizing, emotion, and emotion regulation) may
represent disorganization and/or lack of adequate development
of the self-concept (Pfeifer and Peake, 2012). Thus, activation
of the SRN appears to reﬂect adaptive self-referential process-
ing which may be an important component of self-development,
social functioning, and self-regulation.

Further evidence for the functional relevance of the Northoff
meta-analysis derived ROIs used in this study is reﬂected by
the double dissociation of DMPFC responses (decreased dur-
ing positive and increased during negative self-processing) and
increased mindfulness. Increased DMPFC during negative self-
processing was also related to decreases in SAD-related disability.
The MBSR-related increases in DMPFC activity during negative
self-processing may be related to greater ability to greater recruit-
ment of cognitive control mechanisms that regulate habitual pat-
terns of emotional reactivity and attention allocation. This pattern
of results highlights the importance of investigating both BOLD
signal magnitude and timing, as well as their relationship to indi-
vidual difference measures in order to elucidate how MBSR might
enhance adaptive self-focus, increase psychological ﬂexibility and
reduce clinical dysfunction.

The psychological functions instantiated in DMPFC and PCC
that are recruited during the SRET following MBSR training might
reveal the features of SAD that are speciﬁcally amenable to change
with mindfulness meditation training. In general, increased SRN
activation in this clinical context may reﬂect a greater engagement
in the external stimulus (i.e., enhanced ability to monitor the exter-
nal stimulus) without shifting to habitual automatic avoidance
which is a hallmark feature of anxiety disorder. This psychological
change may be a foundation for the adaptive changes in self-views
as well as clinical and social functioning observed in this study.

The DMPFC has been implicated in multiple executive cog-
nitive functions, including strategic evaluation (Lemogne et al.,
2012), introspection, evaluation and decision-making (Northoff
and Bermpohl, 2004; Schmitz and Johnson, 2007; van der Meer
et al., 2010), cognitive discernment and explicit appraisal of self-
relatedness, and cognitive reappraisal of emotional reactivity in
healthy adults (Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Northoff et al., 2009).
DMPFC responses have also been linked to greater ability to down-
regulate negative emotions in patients with SAD (Goldin et al.,
2009b). Here, increased DMPFC (along with PCC) activity during
negative self (versus case) following MBSR may reﬂect increased
ability to monitor present-moment experience and a concomitant
including attend to
reduction in prepotent cognitive biases,
followed by distract away attention biases, negative interpreta-
tions, and distorted self-evaluations. Additionally, phasic increases
in DMPFC may also reﬂect transient increases in spontaneous (i.e.,

uncued) cognitive reappraisal of emotional reactivity to negative
self-views. Recent models suggest that enhanced MBSR-related
psychological ﬂexibility, for example, mindful coping with per-
ceived stressors, involves the process of disengaging and withdraw-
ing from automatic negative appraisals into a transitory metacog-
nitive state that attenuates semantic evaluations and enhances
positive cognitive reappraisal (Garland et al., 2009).

Increases in PCC/precuneus activity during negative self (ver-
sus case) following MBSR in adults with SAD has been reported
previously (Goldin et al., 2009a). PCC/precuneus has been impli-
cated in multiple higher-order cognitive functions, including
visual-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, ﬁrst-person
perspective taking, experience of agency, self-relevance, and per-
sonal identity (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Hölzel et al., 2011).
Furthermore, subdivisions of the PCC/precuneus suggest differ-
ent patterns of functional connectivity. In particular, the PCC and
the central precuneus are known to be functionally connected with
PFC regions including the DMPFC in a circuit that is related to
higher-order executive processing (Margulies et al., 2009). A recent
review suggests that the MPFC and PCC are part of a brain network
with other brain regions implicated in mentalizing (i.e., theory of
mind), emotion awareness and emotion regulation, and that the
functioning of these psychological functions are fundamental in
the development of socioemotional skills and self-concept (Pfeifer
and Peake, 2012). Clinically, concomitant increases in DMPFC
and PCC have been linked to successful pharmacologic treat-
ment (Samson et al., 2011) and interpersonal therapy for major
depression (Martin et al., 2001). This is the ﬁrst demonstration of
increased DMPFC and PCC being linked to clinical improvement
in patients with SAD following MBSR.

The whole-brain analysis was not the primary focus of this
study. However, the whole-brain results provided further support
that MBSR training increased activity in brain regions involved
in cognitive regulation (medial PFC, bilateral dorsolateral PFC,
left ventrolateral PFC), and attention regulation (right DLPFC,
PCC/precuneus, inferior parietal lobule; Fan et al., 2005). Here,
even though there was no explicit instruction to implement top-
down regulation during the SRET task, these brain changes suggest
that MBSR enhanced the recruitment of cognitive and atten-
tion regulation brain networks that reduce habitual automatic
emotional (i.e., anxiety and fear) and behavioral (e.g., avoidance,
attention disengagement) patterns. This converges with proposed
mechanisms of MBSR, namely, enhanced attention regulation and
cognitive regulation of emotion, as well as modulation of self-
views (Hölzel et al., 2011). It further suggests that increases in
cognitive regulation-related PFC regions (as was seen in the Farb
et al., 2007 study during experiential versus narrative self-focus),
might facilitate modiﬁcation of habitual self-views.

With regard to the effect of AE, there was clear evidence of
enhanced positive and reduced negative self-views, albeit less than
MBSR, as well as similar AE and MBSR improvement in clini-
cal symptoms and mindfulness skills. What is less clear, however,
is what psychological and neural mechanisms are modulated by
AE that account for these changes. Given the completely different
pattern of pre-to-post-AE and MBSR SRN ROIs (Figures 6 and
7) and whole-brain (Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix) changes, dif-
ferent brain mechanisms must be at play. Clearly, MBSR-related
processes such as decentering or non-identiﬁcation with thought

and beliefs are not likely to be the skills actively cultivated with AE.
The increased left insula activity for positive self versus case could
suggest greater viscerosomatic awareness following AE. From our
previous published report (Jazaieri et al., 2012), we know that
AE (and MBSR) were associated with signiﬁcant increases in self-
esteem, and that increased self-esteem is associated with pre-to-
post-AE decreases in social anxiety symptoms (r = 0.58, p < 0.05)
increases in use of cognitive reappraisal (r = 0.57, p < 0.05) and
increases in cognitive reappraisal self-efﬁcacy (r = 0.68, p < 0.01).
As noted above, repeated social fear exposure during regular visits
to the gym facility may also be related to the changes in self-
esteem and associations with social anxiety symptoms, cognitive
reappraisal, and self-views.

The most important implications of this study are that MBSR
can modulate self-views in ways that are clearly detectable via
self-report and brain networks, especially for negative self-views,
and that the self-report and neural changes are related to impor-
tant indicators of social anxiety symptom severity and dis-
ability. Furthermore, this study highlights that MBSR-related
increases in the SRN may be an important ﬁrst step in re-
establishing adaptive self-views and social functioning in patients
with SAD.

The present study compared MBSR to AE, another active con-
trol stress reduction training intervention. One disparity is that
while MBSR involves learning new mindfulness skills, AE does not.
Also, in future studies, adding a no training waitlist control group

could be useful to examine habituation to the SRET task. Nonethe-
less, the signiﬁcant group by time interactions of self-endorsement
ratings and BOLD responses only for negative self-views indicate
meaningful differential changes from pre-to-post-MBSR versus
AE. The SRET task implemented here used experimenter-selected
positive and negative social trait adjectives selected for their rel-
evance to SAD. Use of participant-generated (i.e., idiographic)
stimuli may result in more robust brain-behavioral responses in
patients with SAD and perhaps larger differential effects of MBSR
versus AE. The duration of each word stimulus was only 3 s. Use
of longer stimulus durations will allow for examination of differ-
ences in self-focused attention, and rumination, as well as temporal
features of BOLD responses in the SRN. This study only used
single adjectives as stimuli. Future studies could explore adding
non-verbal cues associated with positive and negative (and per-
haps neutral) self-views. The present study used binary yes/no
responses for the target condition (self-descriptive) and control
condition (upper case letters). Future studies will beneﬁt from
using a continuous rating scale to obtain more reﬁned mea-
surement of how self-descriptive a target social trait is perceived
to be.
