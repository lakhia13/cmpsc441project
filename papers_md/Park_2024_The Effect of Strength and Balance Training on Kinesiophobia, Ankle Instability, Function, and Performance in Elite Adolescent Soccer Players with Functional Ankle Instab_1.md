Abstract 
We aimed to implement strength and balance training for elite ad-
olescent  male  soccer  players  with  functional  ankle  instability 
(FAI)  to  assess  kinesiophobia, ankle  instability, ankle function, 
and performance. This cluster randomized controlled trial com-
prised 51 elite adolescent male soccer players with FAI recruited 
from six different teams, divided into strength, balance, and con-
trol groups (SG, n = 17; BG, n = 17; and CG, n = 17, respectively). 
The SG and BG underwent strength and balance training sessions 
three  times  per  week  for  6  weeks.  Primary  outcomes  were  the 
Tampa scale for kinesiophobia-17 (TSK) and Cumberland ankle 
instability tool  (CAIT)  scores  to  assess  kinesiophobia and  FAI, 
respectively. Secondary outcomes were ankle strength (four di-
rections), dynamic balance, static balance (ellipse, displacement, 
velocity), and performance (figure 8 and side-hop tests). A signif-
icant  interaction  effect  was  observed  for  both  TSK  and  CAIT 
post-intervention (both, P < 0.01). In post hoc analyses, the BG 
had significantly better outcomes in reducing TSK. The SG and 
BG  showed  greater  improvements  in  CAIT  scores.  Regression 
analysis indicated that CAIT severity correlated significantly with 
TSK (P = 0.039, R = 0.289). For secondary outcomes, the SG and 
BG  were  superior  in  terms  of  ankle  dorsiflexion/inversion 
strength, static balance displacement, and figure-8 and side-hop 
tests  (all,  P  <  0.05).  The  BG  showed  significantly  better  static 
balance ellipse results (P < 0.05). The 6-week intervention signif-
icantly enhanced kinesiophobia management, ankle stability, and 
performance.  Balance  training  effectively  mitigated  kinesio-
phobia  and  improved  balance,  compared  with  strength  training 
alone. Even small variations in CAIT severity can influence kine-
siophobia, highlighting the potential benefits of balance training. 
Integrating  balance  training  into  training  programs  can  address 
both physical and psychological aspects of ankle instability. Re-
search is recommended to explore the longitudinal effects of these 
interventions and their potential to prevent injury recurrence.

Introduction 

Lateral  ankle  sprain  (LAS),  the  most  common  injury 
among athletes (Nelson et al., 2007; Gribble et al., 2016), 
is associated with high direct and indirect treatment costs 
(Shah  et  al.,  2016;  Feger  et  al.,  2017).  Among  different 
sports, soccer has the highest incidence of LAS-related in-
juries. LAS in young soccer players accounts for approxi-
mately 20% of all injuries, resulting in a loss of time during 
training and competition (Kucera et al., 2005; De Ridder et 
al., 2017; Donovan et al., 2020). While LAS is generally 

considered to be easily treatable, it can lead to chronic an-
kle  instability  (CAI)  (Konradsen  et  al.,  2002;  Anan-
dacoomarasamy and Barnsley, 2005). CAI results from re-
petitive LAS (Hiller et al., 2011), causing mechanical ankle 
instability, such as ligament laxity. Additionally, it causes 
functional ankle instability (FAI), marked by propriocep-
tive deficits, neuromuscular deficits, postural control defi-
cits, and muscle weakness (Hertel, 2002; Sekir et al., 2007; 
Mitchell  et  al.,  2008;  Kobayashi  and  Gamada,  2014). 
Moreover, pain and weakness owing to prolonged CAI can 
lead  to  decreased  joint  range  of  motion  (ROM),  muscle 
strength, balance, and performance. These conditions may 
also progress to articular cartilage defects or post-traumatic 
ankle  osteoarthritis  (Hertel,  2000;  Valderrabano  et  al., 
2006; 2009). 

Several  researchers  have  investigated  the  efficacy 
of  strength  and  balance  training  in  improving  symptoms 
associated with FAI (Kidgell et al., 2007; McKeon et al., 
2008;  Smith  et  al.,  2012; Hall  et  al.,  2015; Linens et  al., 
2016). While controversial, strength training using elastic 
bands significantly improved muscular deficits in partici-
pants with CAI, providing significant benefits in rehabili-
tation of this condition (Hall et al., 2015), as well as im-
proving  proprioception  and  balance  (Sekir  et  al.,  2007; 
Smith  et  al.,  2012).  Balance  training  is  known  to  reduce 
recurrent  ankle  sprains  through  improving  dynamic  bal-
ance  ability  in  anterior,  anteromedial,  and  posteromedial 
directions, the ankle inversion joint position sense, and mo-
tor  neuron  pool  excitability  (McKeon  and  Hertel,  2008; 
Sefton et al., 2011). These types of rehabilitation programs 
have demonstrated physical improvements in strength, bal-
ance, and functional performance (Hall et al., 2018); how-
ever, few studies have analyzed the psychological effects 
of FAI rehabilitation programs in elite adolescent male soc-
cer players. 

Psychological variables play a chronic role in phys-
ical function (Asiri et al., 2021), and the relationship be-
tween FAI and kinesiophobia (fear of movement or activ-
ity) has received increasing attention (Fukano et al., 2020; 
Walankar  et  al.,  2021).  Kinesiophobia  is  an  exaggerated 
fear  of  movement  and  the  anticipation  or  sensation  of  a 
painful injury (Luque-Suarez et al., 2019), which can affect 
an athlete's strength or postural control and consequently 
alter movement patterns, increasing the likelihood of re-in-
jury (Luque-Suarez et al., 2019; Marok and Soundy, 2022). 
Compared  with  healthy  people,  people  with  FAI  have 
higher  levels  of  kinesiophobia,  which  negatively  affects

their muscles and proprioceptors, as well as postural con-
trol (Alshahrani and Reddy, 2022; Watanabe et al., 2023). 
Investigating the effects of kinesiophobia in ankle 
rehabilitation could enhance understanding of how to im-
prove  this  psychological  condition  and  provide  valuable 
data for predicting the success of ankle rehabilitation; how-
ever, relevent research is limited. 

We  aimed  to  examine  the  effects  of  strength  and 
balance training on kinesiophobia, ankle instability, ankle 
function, and performance in elite adolescent male soccer 
players  with  FAI.  We  hypothesized  that  incorporating 
strength  and  balance  exercises  into  a  training  program 
would improve psychological factors, ankle function, and 
performance compared with those in a control group (CG). 

researchers (except JY) and participants remained unaware 
of  each  group  assignment  until  the  end  of  the  statistical 
analysis. JY was responsible for training each team on the 
exercise protocol. JY provided training for the intervention 
but did not participate in data collection. Statistical anal-
yses were conducted independently by a statistician not in-
volved in the study. The Public Institutional Review Board 
of the Ministry of Health and Welfare approved this study 
(P01-202308-01-048), which complied with the tenets of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was registered with 
the Clinical Research Information Service under the code 
(KCT0008854). The Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram for this study is shown 
in Figure 1. 

Methods 

Study design and blinding 
This  was  a  cluster  randomized  controlled  trial,  with  one 
elite adolescent male soccer team defined as one cluster to 
mitigate  bias  associated  with the intervention. Teams ex- 
pressing a voluntary intention to participate were recruited 
through phone calls to soccer team coaches. Each recruited 
team was assigned to either a strength group (SG), a bal-
ance group (BG), and a CG by a statistician not involved 
in  the  study,  using  the  Research  Randomizer  program 
(https://www.randomizer.org/)  to  conduct  randomization 
by independent lottery. 

In this study, double blinding was applied, and all  

Participants 
The  study  participants  were  adolescent  elite  male  soccer 
players, aged 13 - 18 years, who had experienced an ankle 
sprain,  accompanied  with  inflammation.  This  injury  had 
led to an interruption of training for >1 day within 6 months 
prior to study participation. The participants reported a sen-
sation of instability or ‘giving way’ in the ankle and had 
experienced at least two previous ankle sprains. Volunteers 
were required to have a Cumberland ankle instability tool 
(CAIT) score of ≤25 points. In cases of bilateral ankle FAI, 
the foot with the lower score was designated as the domi-
nant  leg.  Individuals  who  had  sustained  a  fracture  or  an 
acute  lower  extremity  injury  requiring  surgery  within  3 
months prior to study initiation were excluded.

Additionally,  participants  who  had  received  any  form  of 
treatment, including informal or formal ankle rehabilitation 
programs for previous sprains within 6 months before the 
study, were also excluded to minimize confounding varia-
bles (Hall et al., 2018). Mechanical instability was assessed 
using  anterior  drawer  and  talar  tilt  tests,  and  participants 
with grade III instability were excluded. The required num-
ber of participants was calculated using G*power 3.1 (Uni-
versity of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany), with a power 
set at 0.80, effect size at 0.25, and α at 0.05. Considering a 
dropout  rate  of  20%,  a  total  of  51  participants  were  re-
cruited, with 17 participants allocated to each group. 

Prior  to  study  participation,  the  study  purpose, 
methods, and risks were explained to the participants, and 
written  consent  was  obtained  from  the  participants  and 
their parents. 

Intervention protocol 
In  this  study,  an  intervention  program  was  implemented 
three times a week for 6 weeks in all groups. The partici-
pants in the SG and BG engaged in strength and balance 
training,  respectively,  and  only  the  affected  leg  was  in-
volved. Each week, the first intervention program was im-
plemented with education under the supervision of a phys-
ical trainer (JY) with 3 years of experience, and the subse-
quent sessions were supervised by each team coach. At the 
end of each week, the intervention program was checked 
by each team coach to ensure that the intervention program 
was being implemented appropriately. All participants per-
formed  the  exercises  without  the  use  of  ankle  braces  or 
bandages to ensure consistency of the intervention and to 

accurately  assess  the  effects  of  the  training  programs  on 
FAI. 

Strength training was performed on the basis of an 
ankle rehabilitation program, as verified in previous stud-
ies (Hall et al., 2015; 2018). While seated, the study partic-
ipants wrapped an elastic band (Theraband®, Akron, OH, 
USA) around the metatarsal heads of the involved foot, and 
performed  three-directional  isotonic  ankle  strength  exer-
cises: dorsiflexion (DF), eversion (EV), and inversion (IV) 
(Figure 2A). Each trial aimed to maintain a speed of ap-
proximately 3 - 5 s per repetition throughout the full ROM, 
with  approximately  60  s  of  rest  between  sets.  For  ankle 
plantarflexion (PF), the participants performed a single-leg 
heel raise over the full ROM (Figure 2B). PF strengthening 
was performed using single-leg heel raises rather than a re-
sistance band, on the basis of a recommendation by Hall et 
al. (2015), indicating that heel raises are necessary to pro-
vide adequate resistance for the larger muscle groups in-
volved  in  PF.  The  strength  training  protocol  is  shown  in 
Table 1. 

Balance training was performed through modifying 
the protocol described by McGuine and Keene (2006). The 
protocol involved performing each exercise twice for 30 s, 
with  a 30-s rest  between  each  exercise.  This  routine  was 
performed before the main exercise, lasting a total of 8 min. 
The protocol consisted of a single-leg stance, a single-leg 
stance while swinging the raised leg, a single-leg squat (30 
- 40°), and a single-leg stance while performing functional 
activity  (catching  or  kicking).  Progression  during  the  6- 
week period of balance training was managed as follows. 
In week 1, participants performed the exercises on the floor

with  their  eyes  open.  In  week  2,  the  exercises  were  per-
formed on the floor with the eyes closed. In week 3, the 
exercises were performed on a balance board with the eyes 
open. In weeks 4 - 6, all exercises were performed on the 
balance board, with single-leg stances conducted with the 
eyes closed and other movements performed with the eyes 
open (Figure 2C). 

The CG did not implement any additional programs 
related to ankle rehabilitation beyond the team's own pro-
gram and was instructed to avoid any additional strength 
training or rehabilitation of the ankle. 

Outcome measurements 
Outcome  measurements  were  performed  at  two  different 
time  points  (pre-  and post-intervention).  As  primary  out-
comes, psychological and clinical factors, such as kinesio-
phobia  and  ankle  instability,  were  assessed  using  the 
Tampa  scale  for  kinesiophobia-17  (TSK)  and  the  CAIT. 
The TSK, comprising 17 items, assigns a grade on a scale 
of 1 - 4 points, where 1 represents strong disagreement; 2, 
disagreement;  3,  agreement;  and  4,  strong  agreement 
(Luque-Suarez et al., 2019). The TSK score ranges from 17 
to 68 points, with a TSK score of ≥37 points indicating ki-
nesiophobia. The TSK questionnaire has high internal con-
sistency (Cronbach’s alpha, 0.79) and excellent test-retest 
reliability  (intraclass  correlation  coefficient  [ICC],  0.90) 
(Huang et al., 2019). The CAIT questionnaire measures the 
severity  of  FAI,  and  comprises  nine  items,  with  scores 
ranging from 0 to 30 points (Hiller et al., 2006). The CAIT 
cut-off score is ≤25 points, with scores closer to 0 indicat-
ing  a  greater  severity  of  instability  (Wright  et  al.,  2014). 
The test-retest reliability of the CAIT (ICC) is 0.96 (Hiller 
et al., 2006). 

The secondary outcomes were ankle functions such 
as  strength,  dynamic/static  balance,  and  performance. 
Strength  was  measured  in  isometric  plantar/dorsiflexion, 
inversion, and eversion of the ankle using a handheld dy-
namometer  (HHD)  (K-Push®,  KINVENT,  Montpellier, 
France). The reliability of the HDD used for strength meas-
urement has previously been established, with high intra-
rater and inter-rater reliability (Olds et al., 2023). Measure-
ments  were  taken  with  participants'  ankles  positioned  in 
subtalar neutral while seated on an examination table in full 
leg  extension,  which  was  secured  to  prevent  movement. 
The  HHD  was  placed  on  the  plantar  surface  of  the  foot 
from the first to the fifth metatarsal heads (PF), on the dor-
sal surface from the first to the fifth metatarsal heads (DF), 
on the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head (EV), and 
on  the  medial  aspect  of  the  first  metatarsal  head  (IV). 
Measurements were taken three times, with a 10-s rest be-
tween  trials.  The  measured  value  was  the  highest  peak 
torque  value  during  the  measurement.  Dynamic  balance 
was assessed using the star excursion balance test (SEBT) 
in the anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial directions 
after four practice trials. Three measurements were taken 
in each direction to ensure the accuracy and consistency of 
the assessment (Hubbard et al., 2007; Robinson and Grib-
ble, 2008). The participants positioned the hallux of the af-
fected leg at the center of the SEBT grid, placed their hands 
on the hips, and extended the opposite leg as far as possible 
in  each  direction.  Failure  was  defined  as  any  instance 

where the hand was lifted, the foot of the stance leg shifted, 
or the foot did not return to its original position. To derive 
a composite score for the statistical analysis, we calculated 
the sum of the maximum measured value in each direction, 
divided this sum by the limb length, and subsequently di-
vided this value by 3 and then multiplied it by 100. Limb 
length was measured from the anterior superior iliac spine 
to the medial malleolus using a standard tape, with the par-
ticipants lying down (Gribble and Hertel, 2003). 

Static balance was measured during a 10-s single-
leg stance, with the eyes closed, on a force plate (K-Force 
plate®,  KINVENT)  (Meras  Serrano,  et  al.,  2023).  The 
analysis included evaluating the ellipse, displacement, and 
velocity of the center of pressure, which are key indicators 
of balance stability. The measurement was performed with 
each participant standing on the force plate, hands folded 
across the chest, opposite leg held at 30° hip flexion and 
45° knee flexion, eyes closed, and remaining still for 10 s. 
When  a  participant’s  opposite  leg  touched  the  ground  or 
they were unable to maintain a standing position, the trial 
was terminated, and the measurement was repeated (Hertel 
and Olmsted-Kramer, 2007). 

Performance was measured using figure-8 and side-
hop tests. In the figure-8 test, a cone was placed at 5 m, and 
the  participant  quickly  completed  two  laps  in  a  figure-8 
pattern  using  the  involved  ankle,  with  the  fastest  of  two 
laps  recorded.  The  side-hop  test  involved  lateral  jumps 
over a 30-cm distance, with the average of three trials rec-
orded.  Incomplete  jumps,  considered  as  fouls, were reat-
tempted. 

Statistical analysis 
All data analysis was performed using SPSS software (ver-
sion 23.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All data were 
verified for normality using a Shapiro–Wilk test, homoge-
neity at baseline was confirmed through one-way analysis 
of  variance  (ANOVA)  for  continuous  data,  and  Fisher’s 
exact test was used for nominal data. Differences in all de-
pendent  variables  during  baseline  and  post-intervention 
were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA 
(group × time). Post hoc analysis results were assessed us-
ing the Bonferroni correction. In addition, simple linear re-
gression analysis was used to evaluate how kinesiophobia 
was  related  to  CAIT  and  other  parameters,  e.g.,  ankle 
strength (PF, DF, EV, and IV), dynamic balance (SEBT), 
static  balance  (ellipse,  displacement,  and  velocity),  and 
performance (figure-8 and side-hop tests). The regression 
analysis provided insights into the psychological effects of 
ankle  instability,  function,  and  performance.  Effect  size 
calculations for all statistically significant differences were 
performed  using  partial  eta  squared  (η2)  measurements. 
The  following  cut-off  scores  were  used  to  interpret  η2: 
small effects, 0.01 - <0.06; medium effects, 0.06 - <0.14; 
large effects, ≥0.14. The effect size for within-group dif-
ferences was calculated using Cohen's d formula and inter-
preted as follows: small, 0.02; medium, 0.5; and large, 0.08 
(Cohen, 1992). Statistical significance was set at α <0.05.

of the 6-week intervention. The analysis involved 51 par-
ticipants with FAI from six teams (assigning two teams for 
each  group),  with  17  participants  in  each  intervention 
group. There were no dropouts during the study. The allo-
cation of the six teams was as follows. In the SG, 22 of 88 
team members were evaluated for FAI and five were ex-
cluded, resulting in 17 participants (22.72%). In the BG, 29 
of 75 team members were evaluated for FAI and 12 were 
excluded, resulting in 17 participants (22.67%). In the CG, 
27  of  92  team  members  were  evaluated  for  FAI  and  10 
were excluded, resulting in 17 participants (18.48%). No 
significant differences in characteristics were observed be-
tween the groups pre-intervention (P > 0.05). Table 2 pre-
sents the study participants’ baseline characteristics.

(P < 0.001 for all). The within-group changes in primary 
outcomes are shown in Table 4. Additionally, a regression 
analysis  revealed  that  CAIT  significantly  correlated  with 
TSK scores (P = 0.039, R = -0.289), indicating a moderate 
negative correlation (Figure 3). However, no significant as-
sociations were found between TSK scores and other pa-
rameters, e.g., ankle strength, dynamic balance, static bal-
ance, and performance (all, P > 0.05). Detailed regression 
coefficients, standard errors, and P-values for all tested pa-
rameters are provided in Supplementary Data 1.

Primary outcomes 
Differences in primary and secondary outcomes among the 
groups  are  presented  in  Table  3.  There  was  a  significant 
interaction effect among the groups for the TSK post-inter-
vention (P = 0.006), indicating that changes in TSK scores 
over time differed between the groups. Post hoc analysis 
revealed that the BG showed superior improvements in the 
TSK compared with the SC and the CG. There was also a 
significant interaction effect among the groups in terms of 
CAIT  scores  (P  =  0.005),  suggesting  that  changes  in  the 
CAIT over time differed between the groups. Both the SG 
and BG demonstrated better outcomes compared with the 
CG  in  the  post  hoc  analysis.  Within-group  analysis  indi-
cated  significant  improvements  in  both  TSK  and  CAIT

bility tool (CAIT) and the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia 
(TSK-17). 

Secondary outcomes 
There was a significant interaction effect among the groups 
for  ankle  strength  in  DF  and  IV  post-intervention  (P  = 
0.025 and P < 0.001, respectively) (Table 3). Post hoc anal-
ysis indicated that the SG and the BG showed superior re-
sults compared with the CG. Significant within-group im-
provements were observed across all four directions of an-
kle strength (all, P < 0.001) (Table 4). There was a signifi-
cant interaction effect among the groups for dynamic bal-
ance following the intervention (P = 0.005), as well as sig-
nificant within-group changes (P < 0.001) (Table 3); how-
ever, the post hoc analysis did not indicate significant dif-
ferences between the groups.

Strength and balance training effect 

There was a significant interaction effect among the 
groups for static balance of ellipse and displacement fol-
lowing the intervention (P = 0.039 and P = 0.009, respec-
tively)  (Table  3).  Post  hoc  analysis  showed  that  the  BG 
demonstrated superior results for ellipse area, while both 
the SG and BG showed superiority for displacement. Sig-
nificant within-group improvements were noted for ellipse 
area, displacement, and velocity (P = 0.009, P < 0.001, and 

P < 0.001, respectively) (Table 4). There was a significant 
interaction  effect  among  the  groups  for  performance  in 
both  the  figure-8  and  side-hop  tests  post-intervention 
(both, P < 0.001) (Table 3), as well as significant within-
group changes (all, P < 0.001) (Table 4). Post hoc compar-
isons revealed that the SG and the BG exhibited superior 
results  compared  with  the  CG  in  terms  of  these  perfor-
mance measures.

Discussion 

FAI has emerged as a prevalent concern among elite ado-
lescent soccer players, potentially impeding both physical 
and psychological performance. Despite the acknowledged 
significance  of  FAI,  research  focusing  on  rehabilitative 
strategies for adolescent athletes primarily centers on phys-
ical and functional aspects and has often neglected psycho-
logical components such as kinesiophobia  (Hertel,  2000; 
Luque-Suarez  et  al.,  2019;  Walankar  et  al.,  2021).  We 
aimed to evaluate the effects of targeted ankle rehabilita-
tion  exercises,  specifically  strength  and  balance  training, 
on psychological, clinical, and functional outcomes in this 
population.  Through  systematically  comparing  improve-
ments in kinesiophobia, ankle instability, and various ankle 
functions, including strength, static and dynamic balance, 
and overall performance, we sought to assess the effective-
ness of these well-documented rehabilitation approaches in 
the context of elite adolescent soccer players. Our findings 
indicated that the SG and the BG exhibited significant en-
hancements in reducing kinesiophobia and improving an-
kle  stability  compared  with  the  CG,  with  notable  differ-
ences in specific ankle functions. These results emphasize 
the  importance  of  tailored  rehabilitation  exercises  in  the 
comprehensive  management  of  FAI  among  elite  adoles-
cent male soccer players. 

Kinesiophobia, characterized as a fear of movement 
and  re-injury,  has  a  profound  effect  on  individuals  with 
FAI. This condition hampers joint position sense and pos-
tural control and impairs ankle function, which are key fac-
tors in maintaining stability and preventing further injury. 
Studies focusing on CAI, which shares characteristics with 

FAI, have shown that individuals with ankle instability ex-
hibit significantly higher levels of kinesiophobia compared 
with their healthy counterparts, highlighting a critical bar-
rier  to  optimal  performance  and  movement  (Hertel  and 
Corbett, 2019; Alshahrani and Reddy, 2022; Watanabe et 
al., 2023). Kinesiophobia leads to decreased proprioceptive 
accuracy and impaired postural control in the ankle, which 
are essential for effective ankle function and stability (Al-
shahrani  and  Reddy,  2022;  Watanabe  et  al.,  2023).  This 
fear-driven avoidance of movement initiates a detrimental 
cycle:  it  contributes  to  muscle  atrophy  and  dysfunction, 
leading to altered ankle movement patterns that further ex-
acerbate the risk of injury and the persistence of FAI (Ad-
ams  et  al.,  2006;  Claeys,  2013;  Alshahrani  and  Reddy, 
2022). Our primary  outcome  was  to  assess  the  effects  of 
our interventions on kinesiophobia, to observe any changes 
post-intervention. The SG and the BG demonstrated signif-
icant  within-group  improvements  in  reducing  kinesio-
phobia  with  large  effect  sizes  post-intervention,  whereas 
the CG showed only slight improvements. Post hoc analy-
sis of between-group differences indicated that the BG was 
most effective in reducing kinesiophobia, while there was 
no significant difference between the SG and the CG. This 
suggests that balance training, in particular, plays an essen-
tial role in mitigating the fear of movement associated with 
FAI.  Our  analysis  suggested  that  enhanced  postural  con-
trol, particularly  through  improvements  in  static  balance, 
might  play  a  significant  role  in  reducing  kinesiophobia. 
The SG and the BG showed significant within-group im-
provements in static balance and muscle strength post-in-
tervention, but the BG exhibited the largest effect sizes for 
static balance improvements, particularly in the ellipse area

values, suggesting that targeted balance training could be 
particularly effective in mitigating kinesiophobia. In the el-
lipse area values, the BG group had the best performance, 
followed  by  the  SG,  while  the  CG  showed  the  least  im-
provement. In terms of displacement, the SG and the BG 
showed superior results compared with the CG, but no sig-
nificant  difference  between  the  SG  and  the  BG  was  ob-
served. These results emphasize the potential importance 
of balance training in effective rehabilitation. This finding 
suggests  that  strength  and  balance  training  contribute  to 
better control and efficiency in movement, further support-
ing  the  role  of  proprioceptive  enhancement  in  improving 
joint position sense. These outcomes support the findings 
of Han et al., who reported that individuals with FAI and 
higher levels of kinesiophobia relied more on visual cues 
for  maintaining  static  balance,  underscoring  the  im-
portance of proprioceptive training in reducing reliance on 
visual input for balance control (Han et al., 2024). 

Significant improvements in static balance were ob-
served in both the SG and the BG, with the BG showing a 
larger  effect  size.  This  finding  aligns  with  Hall  et  al. 
(2018), who reported greater improvements  in  static  bal-
ance in their balance training group compared with strength 
training. While strength training also enhances static bal-
ance (Coughlan et al., 2012; Fullam et al., 2014), our re-
sults emphasize the critical importance of balance training 
for improving static balance and ankle joint position sense. 
These findings are supported by Lazarou et al. (2018) and 
Ha et al. (2018), whose findings highlight significant im-
provements in joint position sense following balance train-
ing. Improvements in static balance are essential for reduc-
ing  kinesiophobia  (Alshahrani  and  Reddy,  2022).  There-
fore,  prioritizing  static  balance  in  management  strategies 
could  be  beneficial  for  effectively  addressing  kinesio-
phobia in athletes with FAI. 

FAI, assessed using the CAIT, showed significant 
improvements in the SG and the BG when compared with 
the  CG.  This  suggests  that  both  interventions  effectively 
addressed the underlying causes of FAI, such as proprio-
ception deficits and ankle muscle weakness (Willems et al., 
2002).  No  significant  between-group  difference  was  ob-
served in terms of eversion muscle strength, but significant 
within-group improvements were observed in all four di-
rections  of  ankle  strength,  including  eversion,  indicating 
that the interventions were effective in enhancing overall 
ankle  strength.  While  improvements  in  evertor  muscle 
strength are important for stabilizing the ankle (Wisthoff et 
al., 2019; Khalaj et al., 2020), our findings suggest that en-
hancements in balance and performance played a substan-
tial  role  in  improving  CAIT  scores.  Enhanced  static  and 
dynamic balance directly contribute to better postural con-
trol  and  proprioceptive  feedback,  which  are  essential  for 
ankle  stability.  Studies  have  shown  that  balance  training 
improves proprioception and reduces the risk of re-injury 
through enhancing neuromuscular control (McKeon et al., 
2008; Sefton et al., 2011). Our regression analysis revealed 
that  CAIT  severity  scores  significantly  correlated  with 
TSK  scores,  indicating  a  statistically  significant  but  low 
correlation.  This  suggests  that  while  the  correlation 
strength  was  moderate,  the  improvements  in  the  CAIT 
scores were meaningful and associated with reductions in 

kinesiophobia.  Furthermore,  performance  enhancements, 
as evidenced by better results in the figure-8 and side-hop 
tests, indicated improved functional capabilities and confi-
dence  in  movement,  contributing to the reduction in per- 
ceived instability and fear of movement. Therefore, while 
muscle strength is important, the improvements in balance 
and  performance  we  observed  were  likely  to  have  been 
more influential in enhancing the CAIT scores and overall 
ankle stability. 

Performance, as evaluated using figure-8 and side-
hop  tests,  significantly  increased  in both  the  SG  and  BG 
compared with the CG, with a notable large effect size ob-
served.  These improvements  emphasize  the  effectiveness 
of  integrating  strength  and  balance  training  in  rehabilita-
tion protocols. The interaction between increased strength 
and enhanced balance was a key driver of the observed per-
formance  gains.  This  finding  accords  with  prior  studies 
conducted by McKeon et al. (2008) and Hall et al. (2018), 
which also identified strength and balance training as piv-
otal in enhancing athletic performance, reinforcing the syn-
ergy  between  these  two  types  of  training.  A  holistic  ap-
proach  is  needed  when  designing  training  programs  for 
elite adolescent male soccer players with FAI. Specifically, 
incorporating  both  strength  and  balance  exercises  is  im-
portant  to  alleviate  clinical  and  psychological  symptoms 
associated  with  FAI  and  to  achieve  substantial  perfor-
mance  improvements.  This  integrated  training  approach 
presents a promising strategy for optimizing rehabilitation 
outcomes and enhancing overall athletic readiness. 

Strength and balance training programs effectively 
improved  kinesiophobia,  ankle  instability,  function,  and 
performance  in  the  study  participants.  Balance  training 
demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing kinesiophobia 
and  enhancing  static  balance.  This  finding  highlights  the 
important role of balance training in bolstering physical ca-
pabilities and addressing psychological barriers associated 
with FAI. Notably, while strength training contributed sig-
nificantly  to  rehabilitation  outcomes,  balance  training 
emerged as a key factor for optimal improvements in both 
kinesiophobia and static balance. 

FAI  significantly  influences  physical  performance 
and  psychological  factors,  making  comprehensive  treat-
ment  approaches  essential.  This  study  has  demonstrated 
the effect of strength and balance training in reducing ki-
nesiophobia, suggesting that physical training can also al-
leviate psychological barriers. However, the inherent chal-
lenges posed by kinesiophobia may limit some participants' 
ability to fully engage in rehabilitation exercises. It was ob-
served that despite improvements, a subset of participants 
continued to exhibit hesitation and fear, particularly with 
regard to exercises requiring dynamic balance and propri-
oception. This highlights the need for tailored approaches 
that  consider  the  psychological  readiness  of  the  athletes, 
ensuring  that  rehabilitation  programs  are  not  only  physi-
cally, but also psychologically accessible. 

Furthermore,  while  our  interventions  focused  on 
physical training components, the persisting levels of kine-
siophobia  in  some  participants  underscore  the  potential 
benefit  of  integrating  psychological  interventions.  Future 
studies  should  explore  targeted  psychological  strategies, 
e.g.,  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  or  mindfulness-based

stress  reduction,  alongside  physical  rehabilitation  to  ad-
dress the multifaceted nature of kinesiophobia. Such inte-
grative  approaches  could  enhance  rehabilitation  efficacy 
and athlete compliance, ultimately improving long-term  
outcomes in FAI management. 

This study had several limitations. Controlling for 
training other than intervention training for each team was 
not  possible.  Physical  and  tactical  training  varied  among 
teams, and the effect of these differences on the results re-
mains unknown. However, as all teams participated in the 
training,  we  assumed  that  the  difference  was  not  signifi-
cant.  The  CG  showed  improvements  in  several  variables 
despite  not  receiving  any  additional  training  other  than 
team  training;  however,  the  reasons  for  these  improve-
ments remain unknown. The most reasonable inference is 
familiarity with the tests. Given the intervention period was 
short (6 weeks), medium- and long-term follow-up results 
could not  be predicted.  Future  research  should  be  under-
taken involving teams with similar training levels, and the 
results need to be confirmed through long-term follow-up 
studies. 

Conclusion 

This  pioneering  study  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  inte-
grating  strength  and  balance  training  into  the  routines  of 
elite  adolescent  male  soccer  players  for  addressing  FAI-
related  physical  and  psychological  challenges.  Notably, 
our findings revealed that balance training was more bene-
ficial  than  strength  training  in  improving  kinesiophobia 
and enhancing balance, underlining its key role in compre-
hensive  rehabilitation  programs.  Given  the  association 
found between the CAIT scores and kinesiophobia, our re-
search highlights the need for targeted strategies to mitigate 
FAI in this demographic. Balance training needs to be in-
cluded as a fundamental component of training regimens 
to effectively address kinesiophobia, enhance ankle stabil-
ity,  and  improve  overall  athletic  performance.  Future  re-
search is recommended to determine the effects of kinesi-
ophobia  on  performance  during  actual  soccer  matches, 
thereby  broadening  understanding  of  FAI  in  competitive 
sports.

Key points 

 The results support the integration of balance training in re-
habilitation programs for athletes with FAI. Balance train-
ing not only aids in improving physical ankle stability but 
also contributes to reducing psychological barriers such as 
kinesiophobia. 

 The study suggests that consistent and targeted balance and 
strength training improves FAI and enhances overall athletic 
performance and readiness, potentially reducing the risk of 
future ankle injuries. 

 Through  providing  evidence-based  recommendations  for 
incorporating specific types of training to address both the 
physical  and  psychological  aspects  of  FAI  in  athletes,  the 
findings suggest that such interventions can be immediately 
applicable in clinical settings.
