Abstract: Emotional intelligence is an essential trait and skill for healthcare professionals. Mind-
fulness meditation has proved to be effective in increasing the wellbeing of those who practice it,
leading to better mental health, self-care and job satisfaction. This paper aims to identify the recent
evidence on the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence among healthcare
professionals and students. A systematic review was conducted including the databases PubMed,
Cinhal, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The main variables were emotional intelligence skills and
mindfulness practice. Data were extracted according to the following outcomes: authors, year of
publication, country, study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, tools used in data
collection and main results. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed articles;
published in English or Spanish; published between 2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a
study population of healthcare professionals or students; the relationship with the aim of the study.
The Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were followed for assessing the methodological quality of the
selected studies. Three researchers were involved in the review. After the selection process, 10 studies
were selected out of the 197 references initially identiﬁed. These studies revealed a positive relation-
ship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence, particularly the capacity to regulate emotions.
Furthermore, mindfulness is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Training interventions based
on mindfulness have proved to be useful in promoting emotional balance, emotional awareness,
emotional acceptance, emotion recognition, expressive suppression and a reduction in emotional
exhaustion. This study could serve as a basis for further research on the beneﬁts of emotional
intelligence and practicing mindfulness for the bio-psycho-social welfare of healthcare professionals.

Keywords: emotional intelligence; mindfulness; healthcare professionals; systematic review

1. Introduction

Emotional intelligence (EI) is a type of social intelligence that includes the capacity
for controlling one’s emotions as well as those of others, identifying them and using
this information to guide thoughts and actions, promoting a creative thought process,
redirecting attention towards priority problems, increasing motivation and allowing for
ﬂexible planning [1]. It is composed of four facets: the perception and expression of one’s
own emotions and those of others, emotional assimilation, understanding emotions and
the capacity to regulate emotions [2]. The World Health Organization considers EI to be
one of the ten life skills that support people to act in an adaptable and positive manner [3].

In the context of healthcare, EI is taking on an increasingly relevant role. EI has
been shown to positively inﬂuence healthcare professionals’ bio-psycho-social welfare,
increasing their individual resilience, their perception of social support, empathy, job
performance and satisfaction, and reducing stress [4]. The ability to manage emotions is
a fundamental skill that should be developed by healthcare professionals as their work
environment often entails a signiﬁcant emotional burden [5]. Speciﬁcally, there is evidence
linking EI with effective clinical decision-making [6], the occurrence or reduction of stress
and burnout in a work environment [7–9], work engagement [10] and, by extension,
with the institution’s general productivity, turnover rate, work absenteeism and patient
satisfaction [8,11,12]. Moreover, there is ample evidence showing the beneﬁts of health
professionals’ EI while undertaking daily tasks and on the physical and emotional care
patients receive [4,13,14]. EI has been identiﬁed as a predictor of professional success [15].
Similarly, patients also perceive that professionals with EI provide higher quality care,
recognizing empathy, active listening and compassion as aptitudes related to EI [16].

The nature of healthcare professionals’ work entails a marked emotional intensity that
can lead to emotional exhaustion. This is a feeling of prolonged physical and emotional
exhaustion, due to stress, overload and the challenging emotional job demands of care
itself [17]. Healthcare professionals with emotional exhaustion have lower energy levels,
struggle to face the tasks their job demands and have fewer opportunities for positive
experiences in their work [18]. The emotional exhaustion has negative consequences
on both the professionals’ mental health [19] and the quality of the care their patients
receive, as the exhaustion is reﬂected in worse job performance and efﬁciency of care they
provide [20]. Furthermore, emotional exhaustion has been linked to increased turnover
intentions [21] and conﬂicts both among healthcare professionals and towards patients [22].
Emotional exhaustion is in part due to the intense emotional demands of caring, therefore
professionals could become more resilient to such demands by developing skills such as
EI [18].

EI has been described as a trait and a skill; for the purpose of this review, the authors
consider EI as a skill that can be trained [8]. Many studies emphasize the importance
of offering education in EI both to students and professionals, highlighting that the best
moments for EI training are in childhood, higher education and adult life, as a part
of continuous professional development [18]. Training in EI increases the bio-psycho-
social welfare of healthcare professionals, as well as beneﬁtting their clinical practice, the
satisfaction of patients, and the institution for which they work [11–13].

Mindfulness meditation is an effective way of training EI. Mindfulness is a form
of meditation based on the ability to bring one’s attention to what they are currently
experiencing in the present moment, accepting it without judgement and identifying
the sensations, emotions and thoughts [23]. This meditation is used as a therapeutic
psychological treatment with positive results, reducing levels of anxiety, depression and
stress, and alleviating physical symptoms such as pain as well as vulnerability due to
psychiatric illnesses [24–28].

The relevance of the social context and emotional health for practicing healthy behav-
iors and improving ﬁtness and wellbeing among healthcare workers has been studied [29].
Pronk et al. found that employees’ adherence to an optimal lifestyle such as physical
activity, non-smoking, teetotalism and daily consumption of fruits or vegetables, was
associated with signiﬁcantly higher positive emotional health [30]. Hunter explains how
professionals can obtain beneﬁts from practicing this meditation [31] to gain greater control
of their thoughts. This translates to a mental state of tranquility and calm, which provides
them with perspective; these in turn are key elements for improving the care of patients
and interprofessional communication. There is evidence of the impact and effectiveness
of mindfulness for healthcare professionals, resulting in the reduction of stress and the
promotion of self-compassion and self-care [32–35], the reduction of emotional exhaustion
and the incidence of burnout [36,37], the improvement of wellbeing and mental health,
and decreased anxiety and depression [38], with the same results being obtained in stu-

dents [39,40]. All of this suggests that mindfulness could be a link between professionals’
clinical practice and their emotional management, helping them to maintain their own
psychological health [32,39], while also resulting in direct beneﬁts for patients and the
healthcare system [41].

Despite the above, the relationship between practice and training in EI skills and
mindfulness has been little studied among health professionals. As professionals who
show a combination of technical skills and high levels of EI can provide more humanized
health care [12], it would be convenient to offer interventions, programs or training based
on mindfulness to healthcare professionals, in order to promote and develop their EI [42–44].
This paper aims to identify the recent evidence on the relationship between mindfulness
and emotional intelligence among healthcare professionals and students.

2. Materials and Methods

To meet the objective of the study, a systematic review was conducted following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-
lines [45]. The research protocol was not previously registered. The research question
for this review was Is there a relationship between mindfulness practice and emotional
intelligence skills among healthcare professionals and students? To facilitate the electronic
search, it was structured according to the PICO model [46]. P (population) referred to
healthcare professionals, I (intervention) referred to mindfulness practice, C (comparison
intervention) refereed to no mindfulness practice and O (clinical outcome) referred to
EI skills.

The search was carried out including the following databases: PubMed, Cinhal,
PsycINFO and Web of Science. The search strategy was built up combining MeSH terms
(emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, mindfulness, meditation, nurses, and physi-
cians) and search words (emotional expression and healthcare professionals); in order
to obtain a wider scope of records. The ﬁnal search strategy was exactly as follows:
(“emotional intelligence” OR “emotional regulation” OR “emotional expression”) AND
(mindfulness OR meditation) AND (health professionals OR nurses OR physicians). The
same search strategy was used in all the databases.

The search was conducted in October 2020. The following inclusion criteria were
applied: peer-reviewed articles; published in English or Spanish; published between
2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a study population of healthcare professionals
or students; consideration of EI as a skill; the relationship with the aim of the study
(mindfulness and EI skills). The exclusion criteria included duplicate studies and those
without access to the full-text version. Qualitative studies were excluded to obtain results
that analyze the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence measured
with validated instruments. The search was limited to studies published from 2010 to
2020 as recent scientiﬁc publications render others previously published obsolete [47].
In addition, the obsolescence of older literature becomes evident due to the constant
developments within this ﬁeld. Relevancy was also measured through the citations of the
articles, and articles published in the past ten years were cited the most [48].

In order to control biases, the methodological quality of the included studies was
evaluated using the tool provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute for analytical cross-
sectional studies [49]. This tool consists of eight items that allow for the estimation of the
extent to which the reviewed studies have controlled for possible biases in their research,
and thus to assess their inclusion in the study. Two reviewers assessed the selected studies
independently following the assessment tool items. Each item checked on an element of
bias and could be scored as Yes, No, Unclear, or Not applicable. They then shared their
evaluations and resolved any differences through consensus. The research team agreed
that studies that only obtained a negative appraisal in two or fewer items were included in
the review.

The information from the selected studies was extracted using ad-hoc tables designed
by the authors, which included the following sections: authors, year of publication, country,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5491

study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, variables, tools used in
data collection and main results. This data organization allowed for a qualitative and
descriptive description of the results. Data synthesis was also performed independently
by the researchers. Both conducted a thematic analysis of the results of the reviewed
articles and categorized according to the objectives of the study: the relationship between
mindfulness and EI, or with each of the skills it entails.

Two researchers independently carried out the search process, selection, evaluation,
extraction, analysis and categorization of the results. They were PhD healthcare profession-
als and had strong experience in conducting systematic reviews previously. They were also
familiar with the Joanna Briggs Institute assessment tool. Their ﬁndings were compared
and contrasted, and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus, referring to a
third reviewer when necessary. Researchers agreed the outcome from the review, so the
third researcher’s intervention was not required.

3. Results

The initial electronic search yielded 197 references. After applying the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, and following the selection and screening process, 10 studies were ﬁnally
selected (Figure 1).

The included studies were mainly published in the last ﬁve years (90%, n = 9). As
to the design, they were predominantly cross-sectional studies (60%, n = 6), along with
pretest-posttest studies (40%, n = 4). With regard to the study samples, most focused on
nurses (60%, n = 6) compared to other healthcare professionals, and on professionals (60%,
n = 6) as opposed to university students. As for the tools used for measuring mindfulness
skills, the reviewed studies used the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (30%, n = 3),
the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (20%, n = 2) and the Kentucky Inventory of
Mindfulness Skills (10%, n = 1). The instruments used to assess emotional intelligence
competencies were more varied, with the most frequently used being the Trait Emotional
Intelligence Questionnaire (40%, n = 4). No consensus was found regarding the duration
of mindfulness needed to protect against stress and burnout among the reviewed studies,
ranging from 9 h to 14 min per day. Regarding methodological quality, all of the studies
that were evaluated were included in the review. As is shown in Table 1, the least addressed
aspect was the management of confounding factors.

Table 2 gathers the main ﬁndings of the reviewed studies related to this review’s

objective [50–59].

The reviewed studies showed a relationship between mindfulness and the ability to
regulate one’s emotions [52,58], emotional exhaustion [57] and EI [53,59]. The training in-
terventions based on mindfulness have been shown to promote positive emotional balance
among the participants [55], as well as emotional awareness [54], emotional acceptance,
emotion recognition, identifying one’s own emotions, expressive suppression [56] and
the reduction of emotional exhaustion [54]. With regard to EI, the reviewed studies have
described interventions based on mindfulness training that have increased participants’
EI [50,51]. Other studies have identiﬁed an increase in EI after the intervention, although
they did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance [54,55].

4. Discussion

The results of the reviewed studies showed a relationship between mindfulness and
EI skills, as well as an increase in EI after training interventions based on mindfulness.
These results are consistent with other training interventions that have obtained positive
results in their participants’ EI development [60]. The satisfactory experiences of EI training
for healthcare professionals have taken place in a wide range of contexts, ranging from
intensive care [61] to long-term care in nursing homes [62], including clinical areas [63–65].
Indeed, EI training has not only increased these skills in healthcare professionals but has
also been associated with the patients’ quality of life [63], professionals’ job performance
and job retention [64], their perceived state of health [61] and patient satisfaction [64].

Likewise, mindfulness training has been shown to provide healthcare professionals
with psychological wellbeing by reducing stress, anxiety and depression [40,66–68], and
by improving their mood [66]. There is evidence that healthcare professionals who have
undergone mindfulness training have improved their quality of life [35,67], wellbeing [40],
self-compassion [35] and perception of self-efﬁcacy [40,66]. Previous studies indicated that
learning mindfulness provides healthcare professionals with useful work skills such as
empathy [40,66], concentration [35] and awareness of the present moment [35,67]. Further-
more, in accordance with the results of the reviewed studies, mindfulness training reduces
burnout [40,67], which can manifest as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and a
reduced sense of personal accomplishment [68]. The reduction of burnout leads to a better
performance at work, which is reﬂected in better communication with colleagues and
patients, higher sensitivity to patients’ experiences, clearer analysis of complex situations
and emotional regulation in stressful contexts [38].

According to the studies included in this review, mindfulness has been identiﬁed as an
efﬁcient practice for improving the perception and expression of one’s emotions, emotional
assimilation or facilitation, and emotional understanding and regulation. Healthcare
professionals face highly intense emotional challenges on a daily basis, as they witness
human suffering and deal with patients’ anxiety and negative feelings; in addition to
their work overload and interpersonal conﬂicts within their team [69]. In the words of
Botha et al., the inherent duties of health professionals, such as managing pain, loss,
emotional discomfort, end-of-life care and supporting family members, contribute to their
emotional burden [35]. Because of this, they need to ﬁnd a balance between their emotional
investment in patients and detachment, which allows them to effectively respond to both
the demands of the organization as well as the patients’ needs [70]. According to Wu
et al., mindfulness promotes a positive attitude amongst healthcare professionals toward
the do-not-resuscitate signature, and results in better care for terminally ill patients as
it enhances their conﬁdence to discuss end-of-life care decisions with patients and their
families [71].

Emotional labor can be deﬁned as the effort to control one’s own emotions to give an
effective response to the needs of others, while still caring for oneself [72]. The emotional
demands of managing one’s own emotions as well as those of others can have a negative
inﬂuence on healthcare professionals’ health, wellbeing and job performance, leading to
high levels of stress and burnout [73,74]. Long-term care workers prefer coping strategies
such as mindfulness, meditation and solitary recreation, as well as drawing on social
support, as a sources of stress relief [75]. It has been shown that practicing mindfulness
reduces professionals’ emotional overload and burnout, while also enhancing positive
cognitive retraining [37]. Mindfulness strategies and nature therapy (immersing oneself in
nature using all ﬁve senses) have been suggested as useful techniques to promote resilience,
lessen burnout and to heal oneself, for healthcare providers in rural environments [76].
Furthermore, mindfulness has been positively linked to the capacity for withstanding
uncomfortable emotions and feelings, the reduction in the impact of harmful emotional
events and lower emotional reactivity [77]. In this regard, previous studies have identi-
ﬁed an association between mindfulness and self-compassion [78]. Self-compassion has
been described as a feeling of kindness and empathy towards one’s own suffering or

failure, which encourages understanding rather than self-criticism and punishment [79].
Some authors consider self-compassion to be a necessary attitude for allowing healthcare
professionals to provide humanized care. Having compassion for others entails having
self-compassion [80]. The awareness of one’s own suffering makes it easier to recognize the
suffering of others and to give a signiﬁcant response to alleviate it [81]. Therefore, as the
practice of mindfulness develops self-compassion in healthcare professionals, it promotes
attitudes of empathy and concern for patients’ feelings, which leads to a higher quality of
care [80].

Lastly, the articles included in this review highlighted an increase in personal resilience
among those healthcare professionals who have undergone mindfulness training. This
resilience has been described as the capacity to recover from or cope with adverse circum-
stances [82]. Previous experiences of mindfulness training interventions have proved to be
effective in producing a signiﬁcant improvement in healthcare professionals’ capacity for
resilience [83]. The practice of mindfulness has previously been associated with healthcare
professionals’ personal resilience and self-compassion [84]. It has been identiﬁed that an
increase in resilience can help them lessen the negative impact of their demanding jobs,
reducing emotional exhaustion, increasing their commitment to their work and improving
their performance when facing challenges in their workplace [85]. Mindfulness has also
been identiﬁed as a protective factor against the stress caused by emotional labor [69].

This review is subject to the limitations associated with its methodology, such as
publication and selection biases. In order to minimize the latter, the selection process was
carried out by independent researchers. The possible biases of the reviewed studies must
also be taken into account. To control for these, the studies’ methodological quality was
evaluated before they were included in the review. The establishment of a quantitative
methodology as one of the inclusion criteria has meant the exclusion of qualitative studies
that may have contributed additional information towards the review’s objectives. Despite
these limitations, the authors trust the association between EI and mindfulness that has
been conﬁrmed in this review.

5. Conclusions

This study has reviewed the relationship between the practice of mindfulness med-
itation and EI, as well as each of the skills that it comprises. EI in general was shown to
increase signiﬁcantly after practicing mindfulness, as did the perception and expression
of emotions, and emotional regulation. The results regarding emotional assimilation and
understanding have shown that both increase after practicing this type of meditation.

This review entails several important implications, as the development of EI in health-
care professionals can lead to an increase in their capacity to manage emotions, and this in
turn leads to an increase in the quality of care they provide, their resilience, empathy and
job satisfaction. Moreover, the practice of mindfulness provides useful tools that can be
used by professionals not only in developing their EI but also in managing stressful factors.
Mindfulness meditation, as a way to promote the development of EI, is an innova-
tive technique whose efﬁcacy and beneﬁts in different work contexts have already been
demonstrated. Due to the diversity of available interventions, further research is necessary
in order to determine which is most effective.

This study can be used as a foundation for future research on the beneﬁts of developing
EI, and also investigating the strategies to develop EI, with one of them being mindfulness,
as well as the beneﬁts that practicing mindfulness can have on the bio-psycho-social sphere
of professionals, regardless of their ﬁeld of work.
