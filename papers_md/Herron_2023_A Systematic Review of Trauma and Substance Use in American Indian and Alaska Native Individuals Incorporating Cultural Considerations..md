Abstract

Introduction:  Disproportionate rates of psychiatric disorders, like substance use and 
posttraumatic stress disorders, (SUD and PTSD) exist among American Indian and Alaska Native 
(AI/AN) individuals. This review examines substance use and trauma in existing AI/AN literature 
and utilizes an AI/AN specific model to culturally inform the relationship between these factors 
and provide recommendations for future research.

Methods:  We searched three databases through April 2021 for peer reviewed articles that 
examined substance use and trauma in AI/AN individuals.

Results:  The search identified 289 articles and of those, 42 were eligible for inclusion, including 
36 quantitative and 6 qualitative studies. Rates of lifetime trauma exposure varied from 21%–98% 
and were correlated with increased rates of SUDs. A dose response of traumatic events also 
increased the likelihood of a SUD among reservation-based AI populations. Factors from the 
Indigenist Stress Coping model included cultural buffers such as traditional healing and cultural 
identity, which aided in recovery from SUD and trauma, and social stressors like boarding school 
attendance, discrimination, and historical loss.

Conclusions:  SUD and trauma are highly correlated among AI/AN individuals though rates of 
PTSD are lower than might be expected suggesting resilience. However, this pattern may not be 
consistent across all AI/AN groups and further research is needed to better explain the existing 
relationship of SUD and PTSD and relevant historical and cultural factors. Further research is 
needed to culturally tailor, implement, and validate PTSD and SUD assessments and treatments to 
ameliorate these health inequities.

Introduction

Page 2

For American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people, a range of historical and political 
factors related to colonization have had a devastating intergenerational impact on AI/AN 
communities and have led to significant health disparities for Native people [1], [2]). 
Disproportionate rates of psychiatric disorders, like substance use disorders (SUD) and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exist among AI/AN individuals. In a national survey, 
Emerson and colleagues [3] found that 20.2% of AI/AN adults surveyed had past year 
alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared to 14.2% of Non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults, 
while 22.9% of AI/AN adults had lifetime PTSD compared to 11.7 % of NHW adults. In the 
same study, comorbid AUD and PTSD occurred in 6.5% of AIAN adults and 2.4% of NHW 
adults. However, while rates of PTSD are higher among AI/AN, an important consideration 
is the higher rate of trauma exposure experienced across the lifetime for AI/AN people when 
compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. population [4]–[6]. Approximately 80% 
of AI adults in one community had a traumatic exposure, but the prevalence of PTSD was 
only observed in 21%, a 4:1 ratio that was comparable to non-AI populations [7] Similarly, 
AI/AN individuals are more likely to experience an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) 
than NHWs [8], [9] and report the greatest number, average, and variety of ACEs than 
any other racial/group [10]. Addressing these health inequities requires a culturally relevant 
approach to understanding the context of PTSD and SUD and the relationship between these 
two disorders among AI/AN people.

Conceptualizations of mental health development are essential for understanding AI/AN 
culturally specific models of diagnosis and treatment for SUD and PTSD. Among the 
general population, existing theories in the literature attempt to explain the relationship 
between SUD and PTSD but may be problematic for AI/AN populations due to their 
reliance solely on individual factors, rather than contextual, sociocultural, and historical 
factors. These theories of shared vulnerability, susceptibility, high-risk, and self-medication 
hypotheses [11]–[15] have largely been developed and tested in NHW populations and 
therefore may have limited applicability to diverse groups of individuals with trauma and 
substance use histories.

The Indigenist Stress Coping Model [16] incorporates protective and risk factors specific 
for AI/AN communities and individuals and recognizes the unique stressors and coping 
skills applicable within AI/AN cultures. Stressors in the model may include discrimination, 
historical loss and trauma, and individual trauma factors. Cultural buffers such as 
community, cultural identity, spirituality, and enculturation are conceptualized as protective 
against the development of mental health disorders and directly aid in coping with stressors, 
whether at the individual or community level. The Indigenist Stress Coping Model can 
provide a framework for conceptualizing protective and risk factors for understanding the 
relationship between substance use and trauma for AI/AN individuals. The Indigenist Stress 
Coping Model provides a more holistic approach that may better illuminate culturally 
relevant treatment recommendations for AI/AN individuals.

1.3  Present Review

Page 3

This systematic review of quantitative and qualitative literature on trauma and substance 
use in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals utilized both Western and 
Indigenous science perspectives. We planned to examine the relationship between trauma 
exposure or trauma symptoms and substance use in AI/AN samples and assess clinical 
implications for treating substance misuse and trauma in AI/AN individuals. Additionally, 
we evaluated the Indigenist Stress Coping model as a model for incorporating AI/AN 
culturally specific risk and protective factors in the development, diagnosis, and treatment 
of trauma and substance use. Further, gaps in the current literature and future directions for 
research are provided.

2.  Methods

2.1  Search Strategy and Study Eligibility

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) [17] process, the literature search for articles examining substance use and 
trauma in AI/AN populations was completed between November 2020 to April 2021. 
Search terms included the following combinations: (‘American Indian’ OR ‘Alaska Native’ 
OR ‘Native American’ OR ‘Indigenous’) AND (‘alcohol’ OR ‘drug use’ OR ‘substance 
use’) AND (‘PTSD’ OR ‘trauma symptoms’ OR ‘trauma exposure’ OR “posttraumatic 
stress’). Electronic databases including PubMed, University of New Mexico Native Health 
Database, and PsychInfo were searched from earliest year available to April 2021. Manual 
searches of Google Scholar and ResearchGate were completed based on authors of articles 
identified in the systematic search. Google Scholar citation alerts were used to identify 
recently published manuscripts that had not yet been assigned search terms, using the 
key words “American Indian substance use trauma” and “Alaska Native substance use 
trauma.” Additionally, reference lists of relevant publications were reviewed to identify 
eligible articles not identified in our initial search.

Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles in English, that presented either qualitative 
or quantitative data assessing substance use and trauma in an AI/AN sample. Exclusion 
criteria included non-peer reviewed publications, editorials, commentaries, letters to the 
editor; book chapters; non-AI/AN sample; no report of substance use, SUD, trauma 
exposure, symptoms or diagnosis of PTSD. Given the immense diversity of Indigenous 
peoples across the globe, this review is focused specifically on AI/AN populations within the 
United States.

2.2.  Methodological Quality

The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal 
Tool (MMAT)[18].The MMAT includes five categories of study design: qualitative, 
quantitative randomized controlled trials, quantitative non-randomized trials, quantitative 
descriptive, and mixed methods resulting in an overall score for each study between 1 and 
5. The appraisal criteria include three options: ‘Yes’ (criterion is met), ‘No’ (criterion is not 
met), and ‘Can’t tell’ (not enough information to assess the criterion). While the original

authors discourage a calculation or cutoff score for quality, a score of 1 indicates only one 
criterion is met and a score of 5 indicates all five quality criteria are met by the study.

2.3  Data Extraction

In line with Indigenous research methodologies [19], [20] and previous reviews 
incorporating Indigenous ways of knowing [21]–[23], data extraction in this review included 
culturally specific factors framed by the Indigenist Stress Coping Model. This process 
included using qualitative literature to highlight Indigenous voices without critiquing 
Indigenous knowledge or cultural ways. This is important because it may be more in line 
with the AI/AN value of including community knowledge without discrediting differences 
between Western and Indigenous knowledge. For both article types, this included study 
details (authors, year, title), sample size, population demographics, clinical implications, 
and information to assess the methodological rigor. Quantitative study extraction categories 
were tracked in a spreadsheet and included: substance use assessment, trauma inciting 
events, trauma assessment, cultural assessment, use of traditional healing, fit to Indigenist 
Stress Coping model, and relationship between substance use and trauma. Qualitative study 
extraction categories included: thematic content explaining relationship between substance 
use and trauma, cultural themes, and use of community engaged research methods.

2.4  Definitions

For the purpose of this review the term trauma is conceptualized as exposure to traumatic 
experiences, trauma symptoms, or posttraumatic stress disorder. This review covered 
individually experienced trauma of AI/AN individuals, not necessarily collective or racial 
trauma such as historical trauma, as those were coded as part of the Indigenist Stress Coping 
Model. Measures for trauma exposure in this study included trauma experience checklists 
such as: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire [24], Life Events Checklist for DSM-V [25], 
and self-reported intimate partner violence. One measure was used for assessing trauma 
symptoms, the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) [26]. Additionally, studies were coded 
for PTSD using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition 
(DSM-V) [27], or earlier versions of the DSM. Substance use in this review included alcohol 
and other scheduled drugs including xx?. Studies that assessed nicotine or tobacco use were 
also included.

Risk and protective factors in the development of mental health diagnoses like substance 
use and PTSD were coded. As theorized by Walters and colleagues [16], cultural buffers or 
culturally specific protective factors include identity attitudes, enculturation, spirituality, and 
traditional healing. Social stressors may include experiencing racism and discrimination, a 
history of personal or parental attendance at boarding school, and historical or generational 
trauma. Thus, specific social stressors and cultural buffers were coded to highlight the 
importance of culturally specific factors in AI/AN presentations of substance use and 
trauma.

3.  Results

Page 5

Results presented cover the description of the types of articles reviewed, measurement 
of substance use and trauma, risk of bias of the studies reviewed, relationship between 
substance use and trauma, support for the Indigenist-Stress Coping model, and treatment 
factors.

3.1  Search Results

Results of the search and reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure 1. The search 
identified 289 articles from the three databases; after removing duplicates, 275 articles 
remained. The final 42 articles were separated into quantitative (n=36) and qualitative 
studies (n=6) for data extraction.

Demographics of quantitative studies are presented in Table 1 and were diverse in type 
including both reservation and urban based AI/ANs, veteran and civilian populations, 
as well as AI/AN youth and adults. Urban based AI/AN individuals were included in 
22% (n=8) of studies, while reservation or near reservation-based AI/ANs made up 47% 
(n=17) of included articles. While many studies use the terminology AI/AN, only two 
articles specifically included Alaska Native individuals. Populations included 9 clinical 
samples, 5 veteran samples, and 7 articles contained AI/AN youth in the study sample. 
Of note, one project, the American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, 
Risk and Protective Factors Project (AI-SUPERPFP), produced the datasets that made up 
approximately 20% (n=8) of quantitative articles. AI-SUPERPFP was a population-based 
study of two culturally distinct AI reservation communities (Northern Plains and Southwest 
tribal communities) [28]. Additionally, two studies came from the HONOR project, a multi-
site, cross-sectional study on health among two-spirit AI/AN people [29].

Among the six qualitative studies, all were adult samples, two studies recruited urban 
AI/ANs, one study recruited AN adults, and three studies recruited reservation-based AI 
individuals. Three studies used focus groups and three studies used individual interviews to 
gather data from participants. For five of these articles, substance use was the primary focus 
of inquiry.

3.2  Measurement of Substance Use

These articles varied in their focus on types of substances and measurement of substance 
use. Among quantitative articles, ten (27%) focused only on alcohol use and three only 
addressed tobacco use. Most articles examined any type of substance use, including alcohol, 
marijuana, sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, analgesics, inhalants, cocaine, hallucinogens 
(inclusive of peyote), and heroin (n=23, 63%). None examined drug use (besides tobacco) 
only. Over 60% of articles measured substance use by assessing for a substance use disorder 
(n=22) using various methods to diagnose individuals with either lifetime or past year SUD 
(see Table 1). Few articles looked at the quantity and frequency of alcohol use, though some 
included self-reported alcohol use related to heavy drinking (which varied across studies, 
but generally was 6 or more drinks on one occasion) or number of drinking days. None 
looked at the quantity or frequency of drug use. No studies commented on the validity or

appropriateness of these substance use measures for use among AI/AN populations. Among 
qualitative articles, alcohol use was the most discussed substance. However, Skewes & 
Blume [30], reported that methamphetamine use was the most pressing substance use in 
their collaborating communities over the last fifteen years, followed by alcohol use.

3.3  Measurement of Trauma

Among quantitative articles, various assessments were used to either diagnose PTSD or 
measure exposure to traumatic events and are reported in Table 1. Nearly 70% of studies 
(n=25) utilized PTSD diagnosis as a metric of trauma. Individuals from the AI-SUPERPFP 
data were diagnosed with PTSD using the University of Michigan version of the Composite 
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)[28]. However, the CIDI was modified for the 
AI-SUPERPRP project with guidance from community informants to increase the cultural 
acceptability of resulting diagnoses [28]. Cultural adaptations of assessments, like the CIDI, 
may more accurately diagnose PTSD among AI/AN compared to standard assessments that 
have not been validated or adapted to the population. Eight other studies used the CIDI to 
diagnose PTSD (see Table 1). Two studies utilized the Quick Diagnostic Interview Schedule 
(Q-DIS) to assess for PTSD in AI veteran samples, though the authors noted this measure 
has not been validated in the population and may be an underestimate of PTSD [31].

Overall, there was variability in PTSD screening tools and assessment measures utilized, 
and psychometric validation was limited to two studies reporting reliability in the specific 
samples utilized. Seven studies utilized seven different screening measures to assess for 
PTSD diagnosis or the presence of subthreshold PTSD symptomology (see Table 1). None 
of these measures have demonstrated validity in an AI/AN sample. However, the PTSD 
Symptoms Scale Self-Report Version showed strong reliability in a sample of rural AI/AN 
women [32] and Bresleau’s PTSD Short Screening Scale had good reliability among AI/AN 
adolescents [33].

To measure childhood experiences of trauma, five studies utilized the Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire (CTQ). Two studies utilized items pulled from the Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) survey. The CTQ has not been statistically validated in AI/AN samples, 
though Koss and colleagues [34] did report good reliability of the measure in the sample of 
seven different AI tribes across the United States. Brockie et al., [33] reported fair to good 
reliability of the CTQ among AI/AN adolescents.

3.4  Risk of Bias

Quantitative coding results from the MMAT are presented in Table 1 and qualitative coding 
results are in Table 2. Among the 36 quantitative studies, 31 were classified as descriptive 
studies, 2 were RCTs, and 3 were non-randomized studies. All studies scored at least 2 out 
of the 5 criteria for risk of bias, and all but one study scored a 3 or higher. A lower score is 
indicative of higher risk of bias using the MMAT. The most common items coded as missed 
criteria were the appropriate measures and risk of nonresponse bias among quantitative 
descriptive studies. With respect to qualitative studies, 5 of these six met criteria for 4 items. 
Overall, most studies included in the review were at low risk for bias.

3.5  Relationship Between Substance Use and Trauma

Across study types, for AI/AN individuals and their communities, an association between 
substance use and trauma was evidenced as outlined in the sections below. Overall, these 
constructs seem to be co-occurring at high rates across AI/AN individuals at the community 
level and a common co-occurrence for AI/AN people seeking mental health treatment.

3.5.1  Rates of Trauma & PTSD Across Settings.—High prevalence of trauma 
exposure was reported across clinical samples. Among those entering substance use 
treatment, there were high rates of lifetime trauma, but a smaller portion were diagnosed 
with PTSD. Rates of trauma exposure varied between 25.9% of men and 74% of women 
[35], 84% of women [36] in SUD treatment. Another clinical sample study reported 98% 
of AI youth experienced a criterion A event, yet only 10.3% met criteria for a diagnosis of 
PTSD and 13.8% met for subthreshold PTSD [37]. Among AN adults in residential SUD 
treatment, over 75% of those had a traumatic experience in their lifetime[38]. Additionally, 
trauma exposure occurred in wide ranges among community samples, 21% of AI youth 15 
to 24 from the AI-SUPERPFP sample [39], 44% of urban AI/AN women [40], 61% of AI 
youth in grades 8 to 11 living on a reservation [41], and 92% of men and 94% of women 
from a large reservation sample [42].

Across clinical samples, alcohol was the most reported substance used, but polysubstance 
use was also prevalent. Among youth in SUD treatment, the average number of substances 
used was 5 and over 80% of those had SUD along with an additional mental health 
diagnosis. Additionally, youth with a diagnosis of PTSD were more likely to have a 
stimulant use disorder than other types of SUD [37].

3.5.2  Dose Response.—Across multiple studies, the number of traumatic events 
reported by AI/AN individuals was linked to an increased likelihood of a SUD. Among 
reservation-based AI youth, an increasing number of traumatic events corresponded with 
an increased risk for having AUD [39]. Utilizing the same sample but only adults, Libby 
and colleagues [43] observed this dose response across the lifespan, where AI adults who 
reported childhood abuse and another traumatic event in adulthood were at increased odds of 
having an SUD compared to other community members who reported a history of childhood 
abuse. This dose response pattern also emerged using the CTQ, where reservation-based AI 
youth with a high number (three to six) of ACEs were 4.6 times more likely to use multiple 
types of substances than peers with less than three ACEs [33].

Gender differences in the dose response of trauma were reported by Koss et al. [34] where 
AI reservation-based men who reported three adverse experiences were 4 times more likely 
to have AUD and women with four or more adverse experiences were 7 times more 
likely to have AUD. Evidence supporting the dose response of traumatic events related 
to SUD appears linked to childhood trauma or childhood trauma in combination with trauma 
experienced later in life among AI people living on reservations.

In contrast, one study with urban AI gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or two-spirit 
(GLBTT-S) individuals did not find a dose response of childhood trauma linked to a 
past year AUD [44]. These findings are inconsistent with other research with AI/ANs

that supports the association of multiple traumatic events and substance use, suggesting 
differential impact of multiple traumatic events for these multiple minority individuals in 
urban AI/AN communities.

When compared to a non-AI sample, no disparities emerged between the dose response 
pattern of ACEs and alcohol misuse among AI and non-AI adults surveyed in South Dakota, 
despite AI individuals being more likely to report more ACEs than non-AI peers [9]. Higher 
rates of traumatic experiences, but similar rates of alcohol misuse and other mental health 
concerns may suggest other unmeasured factors for AI adults may act as a buffer between 
higher rates of traumatic exposures but comparable rates of substance use and other mental 
health concerns with non-AI adults.

3.5.3  Trauma Types Linked to Substance Use and Comorbidity.—Type of 
trauma exposure was correlated with increased rates of substance use and sometimes the 
type of substance used. Brockie and colleagues [33] found that intimate partner violence 
most strongly increased the odds of polysubstance use in AI/AN youth. Additionally, in a 
sample of AI/AN youth in SUD treatment, sexual trauma was most predictive of a PTSD 
diagnosis [37]. Sexual trauma was also the strongest predictor of binge drinking in the last 
6 months for urban AI/AN women [40] compared to other types of criterion A events (e.g. 
natural disaster, physically attacked, witnessed death). However, even though sexual trauma 
may be a strong predictor of SUD among AI/AN people, these trauma types may not be 
consistent across community groups or gender. For example, among the AI-SUPERPFP 
sample, childhood physical sexual abuse increased the likelihood of AUD, but only in the 
Northern Plain AI individuals and not those from the Southwest [43]. Koss et al. [34] found 
that combined sexual and physical abuse increased likelihood of AUD for AI men, while 
the combination of sexual assault history and boarding school attendance increased odds for 
AUD in AI women. Additionally, AI adults who experienced physical injury or assault were 
3.5 times more likely to have AUD and 4 times more likely to have a cannabis or stimulant 
use disorder [42].

3.5.4  Substance Use Context of Trauma.—For AI/AN youth, when traumatic events 
occurred, substance use was often involved. Traumatic events for participants often occurred 
at a young age, most commonly when the perpetrator of violence was under the influence 
of alcohol or other drugs [45]–[47]. The context of parental substance use also appears to 
increase likelihood of childhood trauma; those who reported a parent used alcohol while 
growing up were more likely to experience multiple traumas in their lifetime than those 
whose parents did not use alcohol [39].

3.5.5  Self-Medication Hypothesis.—Qualitative findings supported self-medication 
theory–the use of substances to cope with symptoms from traumatic experiences. Focus 
group participants endorsed using substances to cope after experiencing physical or sexual 
abuse in childhood [48], [49]. Additionally, one study found that childhood sexual assault 
(CSA) moderated the relationship between depression and a history of alcohol treatment, 
where those with a history of both CSA and alcohol treatment had higher depression scores. 
Easton and colleagues [50] interpreted this as supportive of the self-medication theory.

The self-medication hypothesis may be relevant for some AI/AN people who are exposed 
to trauma at a young age prior to initiation of substance use. Whitesell and colleagues [51] 
found that individuals who had no symptoms of substance use before a traumatic event were 
more than twice as likely to report substance use symptoms after a trauma than those who 
did not experience a traumatic event. While this is not evidence of causality, it implies that 
adversities often precede substance use. Additionally, those who experienced a traumatic 
event earlier in their lifetime were more likely to initiate substance use at an earlier age [52].

3.6  Support for Indigenist Stress Coping Model

The Indigenist Stress Coping Model provided a lens to inform additional culturally specific 
stressors and buffers that may be relevant to AI/AN individuals with concerns around trauma 
and substance use.

3.6.1  Cultural Buffers.—Among qualitative literature, cultural protective factors, 
especially spirituality and AI traditional forms of healing, provided healing from traumatic 
experiences for AI/AN individuals[45]. Cultural and spiritual practices were important in 
participants’ lives and recovery, as individuals reported enhanced cultural identity, feeling 
buffered against current and historical stressors, and increased wellness [47]. AI mothers 
reported that cultural involvement was a tool for recovery from their own substance misuse 
and trauma. Cultural activities and ceremonies (e.g. Canoe Journey) modeled sobriety and 
wellness and connected young people to Elders and the community broadly [49]. Certain 
ceremonies and traditional healing also encourage or require sobriety for participation 
[45], [53]. Additionally, for AN individuals, a traditional lifestyle including involvement 
in subsistence activity was cited as a protective factor and supportive of leading a sober 
lifestyle [46].

Cultural buffers were also represented among quantitative literature. As reported by Holm 
[54], 64% of surveyed AI Vietnam War veterans believed that tribal ceremonies and 
traditional practices provided healing. Of those who reported recovering from substance 
use problems associated with PTSD, 41% of AI veterans with alcohol related problems 
and 83% of those with drug related problems reported attending ceremonies. Additionally, 
65.7% of those with sleep disturbance and 78.5% of those experiencing flashbacks reported 
that attending ceremonies resolved these symptoms related to their PTSD [54]. Further, AI 
women (32%) and AI men (23% ) in residential SUD treatment utilized traditional healing 
within the last year [35].

3.6.2  Social Stressors Specific to AI People.—Additional social level stressors 
were found across quantitative studies including historical loss, boarding school attendance, 
and discrimination and related to poorer mental health. Among those who attended boarding 
school, AI youth were more likely to experience a traumatic event [39] and AI women, but 
not men, were more likely to have AUD [34]. Additionally, among urban based two-spirit 
AI/AN adults, those who attended boarding school were more likely to have AUD, and if 
they were raised by someone who also attended boarding school, they were more likely 
to report PTSD symptoms [55]. However, for AI women recruited from primary care, 
boarding school attendance was not related to PTSD or SUD [56]. For AI adolescents ages

15 to 24, increased historical loss symptoms were related to higher rates of substance use 
and more PTSD symptoms. In the same sample, those who reported more experiences of 
discrimination, as assessed by an AI specific discrimination measure [57], were more likely 
to use substances and have PTSD [33].

Intergenerational Patterns.—Multiple studies highlighted the generational 

3.6.3 
patterns of trauma and substance use happening within AI/AN families and communities. 
Myhra and Wieling [48] found that among families with generational substance yse, 
boarding school attendance in their family was associated with substance use and traumatic 
experiences. Further, AI women living on a rural reservation noted that their own exposure 
to violence and substance use was cyclical in nature, both for their own patterns but also 
passed down through their families [49]. Among AI/AN individuals, parental use of alcohol 
while growing up was correlated with an increased rate of SUD in two diverse reservation 
communities [43].

3.7  Treatment Factors

3.7.2  Cultural Assessment and Integration.—Gathering information about cultural 
identity during assessment may highlight particular strengths or areas of interest for AI/AN 
clients entering SUD or PTSD treatment. Commonly reported was the desire for cultural 
practices and traditional healing to be integrated into treatment options for AI/AN clients 
(e.g., [45], [48], [49], [53]. Additionally, among AI/AN patients enrolled in aftercare 
following hospitalization from physical trauma, 33% requested traditional healing while 
in the hospital and more than half (60%) chose to participate in traditional Native practices 
following release from the hospital as a way to facilitate the healing process [58].

Beyond individual experiences of trauma, historical trauma was noted as a prevalent 
factor among AI reservation communities that may hinder healing [30], [45]. Additionally, 
personal or parental attendance of boarding school predicted substance use outcomes and 
trauma exposure [34], [39], [55].

3.7.4  Systemic Barriers.—Individual level interventions can help identify individual 
solutions to trauma and substance misuse, but there is a larger system of racism and 
oppression impacting AI/AN people and communities that hinders recovery and wellness. 
Under-resourced communities may also need additional infrastructure to support AI/AN 
youth specifically. Community members noted boredom is often cited as a reason for early 
experimentation with substances, and there is a need for greater access to prosocial and 
culturally rich experiences for AI/AN youth and families [48]. Long-lasting and holistic 
solutions to issues around trauma and substances are needed to improve the health of AI/AN 
individuals and their communities.

When interviewing tribal members in Montana, Skewes & Blume [30] found that healing or 
recovery requires intervention on multiple levels; specifically, healing and recovery requires 
intervention at individual, community, family, socioeconomic, and systems levels. Findings 
also highlighted that provider availability in AI/AN communities, many of which are in 
underserved or rural locations, may be an additional barrier to care for AI/AN individuals 
with comorbid SUD and PTSD. Legha et al. [38] reported the use of telepsychiatry

to increase provider availability at a tribally operated, urban based residential SUD 
treatment clinic serving AN adults with complex treatment needs, particularly medication 
management.

3.7.5  Existing Treatments for Trauma and Substance Use.—One existing 
evidence-based treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), was culturally adapted 
and tested by Pearson and colleagues [32] to target PTSD symptoms, substance use, and 
HIV sexual risk behaviors in AI women. The culturally adapted CPT included removal 
of the trauma narrative from CPT, tailoring concepts and handouts to include culturally 
specific examples and content. Results of the randomized controlled trial found that CPT 
was effective at reducing alcohol use and PTSD symptoms. While just one example of a 
treatment for comorbid trauma and substance use concerns, there are substantive takeaways 
from this work. In particular, the culturally adapted CPT showed promise for use with rural 
dwelling AI/AN women presenting to treatment exhibiting PTSD symptoms and wanting to 
reduce alcohol use. However, only 30% of participants completed the treatment, and 20% 
dropped out after baseline without receiving any treatment. Strategies to improve treatment 
engagement for AI/AN clients are warranted given high rates of attrition in treatment.

4.  Discussion

4.1 

Indigenous Framework to Contextualize Main Findings

Contextualizing the main findings of this review utilizing an Indigenous methodological 
framework included the use of a culturally specific model to guide findings, the Indigenist 
Stress Coping model [16], and honoring the personal and experiential aspects of Indigenous 
traditional knowledge [19]–[21] by including both quantitative and qualitative literature. 
Utilizing this lens to examine the relationship between trauma and substance use brings 
light to often overlooked cultural and community factors that may be important for AI/AN 
individuals with co-occurring trauma and substance use.

4.1.1  Relationship Between Trauma and Substance Use.—Qualitative and 
quantitative findings each supported connections between trauma and substance use but 
in different ways. Across qualitative literature included in this review, AI/AN community 
members highlighted that the relationship between trauma and substance use was cyclical, 
where substance use led to traumatic events and trauma led to substance use among 
AI/AN individuals. A positive correlation was seen across cross-sectional data that pointed 
to a dose response of traumatic events that increased the likelihood for SUDs among 
reservation-based AI individuals [34], [39], [43], but not in a sample of urban based AI/ANs 
[44]. In fact, most of AI/AN individuals who presented to SUD treatment had a trauma 
history, though a smaller proportion met criteria for PTSD. Further, those with a history of 
childhood trauma and revictimization as an adult were at an increased risk for SUD [43]. 
Presentation to specialty SUD treatment may be more common for AI/AN individuals, given 
that no studies included clinical PTSD treatment alone. Additionally, some studies supported 
the self-medication hypothesis to explain the relationship between traumatic events and 
substance use in some AI individuals. Given the high rates of trauma across the lifespan and 
high rates of multiple traumatic events, these studies highlight the importance of treatment

options that can address multiple lifetime traumatic events rather than just one traumatic 
event. Overall, the present review highlighted that the context of traumatic events and 
substance use are intertwined for many AI/AN individuals, at the community level and at 
clinical levels.

Indigenist Stress Coping Model.—Evidence to support the Indigenist Stress 

4.1.2 
Coping Model was limited by the sparse measurement of culturally specific buffers and 
stressors in existing quantitative data. However, qualitative literature indicated that cultural 
buffers like spirituality, cultural involvement, and access to traditional healing provided 
support for those moving towards recovery from trauma and substance use related distress. 
Qualitative research also supported the model in that additional stressors increase the 
likelihood of negative mental health outcomes (like PTSD and SUD) including proximal 
factors like discrimination and distal factors such as historical and cultural loss tied to 
boarding schools and colonialism broadly. From quantitative literature, boarding school 
attendance impacted both alcohol use disorders and PTSD. However, only one study 
demonstrated a statistical relationship between historical loss and higher PTSD symptoms 
and SUD [39]. This same pattern also emerged among those who endorsed higher rates of 
discrimination. Generally, qualitative literature provided more context for the applicability of 
the Indigenist Stress Coping model to trauma and substance use. However, quantitative work 
shows some growing evidence to support additional stressors such as historical trauma and 
discrimination, that illuminate additional risk to the relationship between substance use and 
trauma for AI/AN individuals and their communities.

4.1.3  Cultural Considerations in Diagnosis & Treatment.—The use of culturally 
relevant and appropriate instruments to measure trauma and comorbidity is essential for 
research and treatment with AI/AN individuals. This is particularly relevant for diagnosing 
PTSD, given that Manson and colleagues [59] found that twice the rate of PTSD was 
diagnosed by using culturally appropriate instruments compared to national estimates at 
the time for PTSD in AI/AN people aged 15 to 54. From this review, the Composite 
International Diagnostic Interview [28] emerged as the only culturally validated measure 
utilized to diagnose PTSD and SUD. When tailoring the CIDI, Beals and colleagues 
[28] utilized community stakeholders to provide feedback. They reported changes to 
screening language like adding cultural idioms of distress and breaking down questions into 
simpler language. Additionally, assessment of culturally specific stressors may contribute 
to case conceptualization when working with AI/AN clients [60]. Cultural considerations 
in measurement are vital for more holistic models that can elucidate understanding of risk 
and protective factors regarding high rates of trauma and substance use among AI/AN 
communities.

Furthermore, ongoing systemic stressors and historical stressors were notable in the 
literature for impacting diagnosis, treatment, and traditional healing for AI/AN individuals 
across studies. Cultural stressors measured among studies in this review included personal 
and parental boarding school attendance, discrimination, historical loss and trauma, and 
intergenerational patterns of trauma and substance use. Relevant protective factors included 
traditional healing and access to cultural knowledge and spirituality. While these factors

may aid the healing process for AI/AN with trauma and substance use concerns, these 
types of cultural support should come from community not from non-Native providers or 
organizations. Additionally, not all AI/AN individuals may come from backgrounds where 
these types of traditions and cultural ceremonies or activities are accessible or appropriate. 
This accentuates the importance that cultural identity or acculturation be assessed, and 
client’s desire or willingness to engage or re-engage in culturally specific traditions of 
healing.

4.2  Limitations of the Research

Studies included in this review are primarily from American Indian samples. Given the 
lack of representation in the literature and the immense diversity of tribes nationally and 
in Alaska alone, Alaska Native (AN) people and communities, while grouped together 
racially with AIs, may have a different presentation. Culturally and historically, AI tribes 
and AN tribes vary widely, and patterns and observations made in research with AI 
communities may have limited applicability to AN people and communities. Additionally, 
individual studies often come from one or a few tribal communities and findings may not be 
generalizable given the immense diversity of AI/AN tribes and communities.

Some literature examining substance use and trauma are found within the context of articles 
where the primary aim is often another construct or diagnosis, like conduct disorder [61], 
depression [50] mood disorders [62], HIV risk [63], [64] or a combination of multiple 
different diagnoses [33], [65], [66]. In addition, the search terms required both substance 
use and trauma, so we cannot speak to individuals who have only one or the other. While 
this provides valuable information on contextual factors that play a role in the relationship 
between substance use and trauma, these findings limit the generalizeability of these patterns 
beyond these specific diagnoses.

Methodological problems involving design and measurement hampered confidence in 
results. Most studies in this review were cross-sectional, limiting interpretation of these 
findings about the relationship between trauma and substance use in AI/AN people. Given 
the cross-sectional nature of these quantitative data, no conclusions can be made about 
a causal relationship between trauma and substance use. The estimates informing this 
relationship also may not represent a true prevalence of the extent of substance use 
and trauma in AI/AN communities. Importantly, few articles reported the reliability of 
trauma or substance use assessments in studies and none tested their validity, so it is 
unclear how well diagnostic measures performed in the AI/AN samples represented in this 
review. Psychometric testing of assessment measures are needed to help ensure accurate 
measurement and interpretation among AI/AN people. Given the stigma around constructs 
like substance misuse and trauma, these constructs are potentially underestimated in AI/AN 
individuals and their communities.

4.3  Future Directions

4.3.1  Community Engaged Research.—Given the sensitive and potentially 
stigmatizing nature of substance use and trauma research topics, utilizing community-based 
approaches, like Indigenous research methods [19], [20] or Community Based Participatory

Research [67] may increase community buy in and individual willingness to participate 
in research on these health inequities, as well as help ensure appropriate questions, 
methods, and conclusions. In this review, Skewes & Blume [30], noted that AI community 
members prefaced knowledge transmission with history and context of their community 
to researchers to better inform current situations related to trauma and substance use. 
Research methodologies that utilize community knowledge and build on these resources 
may better inform culturally relevant constructs in co-occurring PTSD and SUD and 
illuminate potential treatment targets. Additionally, research with communities should be 
inclusive of rural, reservation, and urban communities, given that each of these communities 
have differential access to resources (whether considering healthcare, economic, cultural, or 
other sources) and thus have different needs when it comes to SUD and PTSD prevention 
and treatment options. Most research has been focused on AI peoples and reservation-based 
communities, and additional research is needed on AN and urban communities given the 
immense diversity of tribes and rurality.

4.3.2  Prevention.—Efforts to prevent or intervene with AI/AN youth was a strong theme 
across qualitative studies given the report of childhood trauma as a factor in substance 
misuse and trauma later in life ([46], [49], [53]. Justifications included youth as an 
impressionable time, especially because age of onset for substance use is younger among 
AI/AN youth than for youth of other racial/ethnic groups [68], [69]. Additionally, given that 
parental substance use was associated with trauma exposure, treatment of SUD for parents 
may be protective for children and future generations. More longitudinal research is needed 
to better understand predictors and directionality or circularity of trauma and substance 
misuse. In addition, research on early intervention following traumatic events in childhood is 
needed to help reduce these substantive health inequities. Screening and education are vital 
to addressing these traumas that may be occurring in childhood for AI/AN communities and 
prevention of further trauma or the development of negative health outcomes like SUDs. The 
role of cultural protective factors revealed among qualitative literature and in community 
knowledge should also be further developed in research. Including cultural variables as 
outcomes, mediators, and moderators in quantitative research, not just as covariates, may 
help illuminate the relevance of these constructs.

4.3.3. 
Intervention Development.—Among AI/AN communities, there is an immense 
need for culturally relevant and efficacious treatment to address health inequities, including 
SUD and PTSD. Interventions that target multiple traumatic events and diagnoses may be 
particularly relevant. Given high levels of trauma exposure from a young age, focusing on 
coping skills to deal effectively with trauma may be particularly beneficial. Additionally, 
cultural tailoring of existing treatment modules such as cognitive restructuring and distress 
tolerance may improve acceptability, engagement, and outcomes. Examples from the 
literature include cognitive behavior therapy that has been culturally adapted for AI/AN 
children exposed to trauma [70], dialectical behavior therapy that has been tailored for 
AI/AN youth with SUD [71], and motivational interviewing and community reinforcement 
approach with AI adults [72]. Further, in addition to traditional healing, culturally grounded 
interventions should be developed to demonstrate cultural and community strengths in 
processes of healing and broaden accessibility of treatment options for individuals.

Individual level interventions are needed for AI/AN people and should include attention to 
social and cultural factors. Furthermore, the intergenerational patterns of substance misuse 
and collective trauma may also require broader community level interventions to promote 
healing and wellness. Finally, efforts to implement tailored evidenced-based treatments in 
AI/AN community settings are necessary to ameliorate mental health inequities for AI/AN 
people.

5.  Conclusion

For AI/AN individuals, there is a significant association between trauma exposure early in 
life and even more if additionally in later life and higher rates of SUDs. However, this 
pattern may not be consistent across reservation and urban-based AI/AN people. Further 
research is needed to better explain the existing association of SUD and PTSD. Utilizing the 
Indigenist Stress Coping model to incorporate culturally specific risk and protective factors 
in this relationship found that boarding school attendance, discrimination, and historical loss 
increased risk while cultural involvement and access to traditional healing buffered the risk 
and aided in recovery. Further research is needed to validate, culturally tailor, and implement 
PTSD and SUD assessment tools and treatments to more effectively address these health 
inequities.
