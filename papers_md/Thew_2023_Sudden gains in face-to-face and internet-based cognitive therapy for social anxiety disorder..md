Sudden  gains  are large  and stable  decreases in  clinical  symptoms between  consecutive  therapy sessions. This 
work examined the frequency and possible determinants of sudden gains in Cognitive Therapy for Social Anxiety 
Disorder,  comparing  face-to-face  (CT)  and  internet-based  (iCT)  formats  of  treatment  delivery.  Data  from  99 
participants from a randomised controlled trial were analysed. The frequency of sudden gains was high: 64% and 
51% of participants experienced a sudden gain in CT and iCT respectively. Having a sudden gain was associated 
with  lower  social  anxiety  symptoms  at  posttreatment  and  follow-up.  There  was  evidence  of  reductions  in 
negative social cognitions and self-focused attention immediately prior to the sudden gain, contrasting with no 
prior reductions in depression symptoms. Ratings of session videotapes in CT showed that clients’  statements 
indicated greater generalised learning in sessions immediately prior to gains, compared to control sessions. This 
may suggest a role for generalised learning in facilitating these large symptom reductions. There were no sig-
nificant differences in results between the CT and iCT treatment formats, suggesting that the therapy content 
appears  to  play  a  more  important  role  in  determining  participants’  large  symptom  improvements  than  the 
medium of treatment delivery.   

1. Introduction 

Sudden  gains  are  large  and  stable  decreases  in  clinical  symptoms 
between consecutive therapy sessions (Tang & DeRubeis, 1999), which 
have been found in many studies of psychological therapies for mental 
health problems (Shalom & Aderka, 2020). A recent meta-analysis of 50 
sudden gains studies found that 14.4–62.2% of treated patients experi-
enced a sudden gain, and that sudden gains were associated with greater 
improvement  on  primary  outcome  measures  at  end  of  treatment  and 
follow-up (Shalom & Aderka, 2020). Sudden gains therefore represent 
an  interesting  clinical  phenomenon  that  may  have  implications  for 
enhancing therapies if their occurrence can be better understood. 

The criteria used to identify sudden gains specify that gains must be 
large  in  absolute  magnitude,  large  in  relative  magnitude,  and  large 
relative to symptom fluctuation (Tang &  DeRubeis, 1999; Tang, DeR-
ubeis, Beberman, & Pham, 2005). There are currently five studies that 
have  examined  sudden  gains  in  social  anxiety  disorder  (SAD)  (Bohn, 
Aderka,  Schreiber,  Stangier,  &  Hofmann,  2013;  Butler  et  al.,  2019; 

Hofmann, Schulz, Meuret, Moscovitch, &  Suvak, 2006; Shalom et al., 
2020;  Thorisdottir,  Tryggvadottir,  Saevarsson,  &  Bjornsson,  2018). 
These have focused on CBT interventions in individual, group, and on-
line  formats,  as  well  as  interpersonal  therapy  and  mindfulness-based 
cognitive  therapy  approaches.  Results  across  the  studies  have  been 
relatively consistent regarding the proportion of patients with SAD who 
experience a sudden gain. Typically around 20% of patients showed a 
sudden gain, a figure that is lower than the average proportion across all 
disorders studied (34.65%), as reported by Shalom and Aderka (2020). 
However, other findings in the SAD studies have been less consistent, 
particularly  in  two  respects:  firstly  regarding  whether  experiencing  a 
sudden gain is associated with better overall treatment outcomes, which 
is true of most sudden gains studies in other clinical conditions (Shalom 
&  Aderka,  2020).  Among  the  five  SAD  studies  that  assessed  sudden 
gains, two (Bohn et al., 2013; Shalom et al., 2020) found that individuals 
who experienced sudden gains had better overall clinical outcomes and 
three (Butler et al., 2019; Hofmann et al., 2006; Thorisdottir et al., 2018) 
found  no  such  relationship.  Secondly,  whether  there  is  evidence  of

Thew et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

changes in anxious cognitions associated with the gain. Neither of the 
two studies that examined such cognitions (Bohn et al., 2013; Hofmann 
et al., 2006) found evidence of greater cognitive change in the session 
prior to a sudden gain. However, Bohn et al. (2013) found evidence of 
reduced  negative  social  cognitions  occurring  concurrently  with  the 
sudden gain. Hofmann et  al. (2006) found no evidence of concurrent 
cognitive  change,  but  noted  that  the  cognition  measure  used  in  their 
study,  the  Negative  Self-Statements  During  Public  Speaking  scale 
(SSPS-N;  Hofmann  &  DiBartolo,  2000)  only  assesses  negative 
self-perception, which may not be the only cognitive change expected to 
occur across therapy. It is possible that the inconsistencies in findings 
across the SAD studies may stem from variability in methodology, for 
example, different treatment types, delivery formats, and process and 
outcome measures. There is therefore a need for further of sudden gains 
in the treatment of SAD before conclusions can be drawn. 

A further question of interest in the sudden gains literature is which 
factors may predict their occurrence. This has been examined by ana-
lysing  changes  in  cognitions  or  other  theoretically-derived  constructs 
prior to sudden gains (e.g. Wiedemann, Stott, et al., 2020), whether they 
can  be  predicted  from  demographic  or  clinical  characteristics  (e.g. 
Doane, Feeny, & Zoellner, 2010), or whether some sudden gains might 
be  considered  ‘false  positives’  linked  to  measurement  error,  pretreat-
ment variability or other statistical artefacts (see Shalom et al., 2020; 
Thomas & Persons, 2013; Vittengl, Clark, Thase, & Jarrett, 2015). Other 
studies have closely examined the content of the pre-gain session using 
therapy session videotapes to explore patient and therapist behaviours 
immediately preceding gains (e.g. Goodridge & Hardy, 2009; Lutz et al., 
2013; Norton, Klenck, & Barrera, 2010; Tang & DeRubeis, 1999; Tang 
et al., 2005). This approach has the advantage of focusing specifically on 
within-session  content,  and  by  drawing  on  ratings  from  external  ob-
servers,  it  reduces  the  need  to  rely  exclusively  on  self-report  data. 
However,  this  approach  has  yet  to  be  taken  within  interventions  for 
SAD. 

This  study  aimed  to  examine  the  occurrence  and  possible  de-
terminants  of  sudden  gains  in  individual  cognitive  therapy  for  SAD, 
comparing  the  standard  face-to-face  treatment  format  (CT)  with  a 
therapist-guided Internet-based programme (iCT). This is the first study 
of  its  kind  to  make  a  comparison  of  two  delivery  formats  where  the 
treatment content is identical. Sudden gains have been shown to occur in 
Internet interventions (e.g. Hedman et al., 2014; Shalom et al., 2020), 
but it is not yet known whether the frequency and nature of these gains 
are comparable to those occurring in the equivalent therapy delivered 
face-to-face. This is an important step to understand whether the psy-
chological  mechanisms  of  change  underlying 
face-to-face  and 
Internet-based  treatments  are  similar.  Lastly,  we  aimed  to  explore 
therapy content in more detail by examining videotapes of face-to-face 
CT sessions. 

Each  session  is  90  min  duration  and  often  includes  the  patient  and 
therapist  completing  behavioural  experiments  together.  The  iCT-SAD 
intervention  is  a  modular  therapist-guided  online  treatment  that  de-
livers the same content and techniques as CT-SAD (see Stott et al., 2013). 
Therapist guidance is provided via a weekly phone call of approximately 
20 min duration, plus other communication during the week through 
messaging and SMS. Treatment also includes a webcam experiment with 
the therapist in week two. The majority of behavioural experiments are 
done independently by the patient outside of the weekly calls. 

2.2. Measures 

Measures were completed prior to each weekly face-to-face CT ses-
sion, and on a weekly basis for patients allocated to iCT. Although the 
RCT included a waitlist control group, outcome measurement during the 
wait period was insufficiently frequent (i.e. baseline, mid-wait, and post- 
wait) to allow the calculation of sudden gains in this condition. Sudden 
gains were calculated based on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale – Self- 
report version (LSAS; Baker, Heinrichs, Kim, &  Hofmann, 2002; Heim-
berg et al., 1999). Additional independent ratings of social anxiety were 
made  using  the  relevant  section  of  the  Anxiety  Disorders  Interview 
Schedule (ADIS; Brown, Barlow, & DiNardo, 1994) at the start and end of 
treatment. The present study also examined changes in negative social 
cognitions and self-focused attention, which are central to the Clark and 
Wells (1995) model, around the period of the gain. There is evidence 
that  these  variables  mediate  treatment  outcomes  in  CT-SAD  (Hoffart, 
Borge, & Clark, 2016; Hoffart, Borge, Sexton, & Clark, 2009; M¨ortberg, 
Hoffart, Boecking, & Clark, 2015; Thew et al., 2020). Depressed mood 
was also measured to examine the specificity of any effects observed for 
the model-derived variables. Negative social cognitions were assessed 
with the Social Cognitions Questionnaire (SCQ; Clark, 2005); self-focused 
attention  (SFA)  with  two  items  of  the  Social  Phobia  Weekly  Summary 
Scale (SPWSS; Clark, 2005); and depressive symptoms with the Patient 
Health Questionnaire – 9-item version (PHQ-9; Kroencke, Spitzer, & Wil-
liams, 2001). 

2.3. Identification of sudden gains 

Sudden  gains  were  identified  based  on  the  LSAS,  using  the  three 
criteria outlined by Tang et al. (2005). For criterion one, we calculated 
the  reliable  change  index  (RCI)  as  described  in  Jacobson  and  Truax 
(1991), using the standard deviation of the baseline assessment scores 
(SD = 18.0), and the internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of the scale 
(0.95; Baker et al., 2002), as shown below:

2. Method 

2.1. Participants, treatments, and therapists 

Data were drawn from a waitlist-controlled RCT (Clark et al., 2022) 
comparing  face-to-face  CT-SAD  (n  = 50)  with  therapist-guided  inter-
net-based  iCT-SAD  (n  = 49).  Participants  all  met  DSM-IV  (American 
Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for SAD, were age 18–65, were 
able to read English, had adequate access to an internet-enabled com-
puter,  and  were  on  no  or  stable  psychotropic  medication.  Exclusion 
criteria  were  current  alcohol  or  substance  dependency  or  borderline 
personality  disorder,  and  current  or  past  psychosis.  The  study  was 
reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. 

Both  treatments  were  delivered  over  14  weeks  with  follow-up  at 
three and twelve months. Three clinical psychologists with experience in 
both treatment formats delivered the treatments. The CT-SAD treatment 
protocol is based on the Clark and Wells (1995) model and is delivered 
via individual in-person sessions (Clark et al., 2006) on a weekly basis. 

Rounding up to the nearest whole number this gave a value of 12 
points for the criterion one cutoff, which is in line with RCI calculations 
used in other studies of iCT-SAD (Stott et al., 2013; Thew et al., 2019) 
and is similar to the 10 point cutoff used in Hofmann et al. (2006). Gains 
were required to represent a drop of at least 25% of the pregain score 
(criterion two), and the mean difference between the three pregain and 
three postgain measurements was required to be greater than 2.78 times 
the pooled standard deviation of the two groups (criterion three). Where 
only  five  of  the  six  datapoints were  available  (i.e.,  for  gains  between 
sessions 2 and 3, or between sessions 12 and 13, or where one datapoint 
was missing), an adjusted critical value of 3.18 was used (see Lutz et al., 
2013).  Gains  occurring  following  the  first  session  or  the  penultimate 
session were therefore not included. 

The sessions before and after a sudden gain are referred to as session 
‘n’ (pregain session) and session ‘n+1’ (postgain session), respectively, 
with  earlier  or  later  sessions  identified  in  relation  to  session  ‘n’  (e.g. 
session  ‘n-2’).  In  iCT,  where  therapist  contact  is  brief  but  regular 
throughout  each  week,  and  assessments  are  completed  online  on  a

weekly basis, the notion of therapy ‘sessions’ is not applicable; here, we 
use  the  term  ‘week’,  where  ‘week  x’  refers  to  the  period  between 
assessment x and assessment x+1. 

2.4. Missing data 

Where individual questionnaire item scores were missing, the total 
score was calculated by prorating missing scores based on the mean of 
the completed items. If an entire questionnaire was missed, the weekly 
total  score  was  not  estimated  or  replaced,  to  avoid  influencing  the 
calculation of sudden gains (see Tang, DeRubeis, Hollon, Amsterdam, & 
Shelton, 2007). Across the posttreatment, three-month follow-up, and 
12-month follow-up assessments, five participants were missing at least 
one LSAS score, and 12 missing at least one ADIS score. When analysing 
the  relationship  of  sudden gains  to therapy  outcomes,  a  linear  mixed 
effects  approach  was  used,  which  has  the  advantage  of  implicitly  ac-
counting for data missing at random. 

randomised with respect to whether the client had experienced a sudden 
gain or not. To assess the reliability of the coding manual, a second rater 
(a  clinical  psychologist)  independently  scored  a  sample  of  eight  tape 
pairs  (21%). These  ratings  showed ICC(2,1) values  between 0.76 and 
0.85  indicating  excellent  agreement  (Cicchetti,  1994)  across  the  four 
rating scales. 

2.6. Analysis 

Analyses  were performed  in  R  version 3.4.3  (R  Core  Team,  2017) 
using the packages ‘suddengains’  (Wiedemann, Thew, Stott, &  Ehlers, 
2020), ‘nlme’ (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & R Core Team, 2018), 
and ‘tidyverse’ (Wickham, 2017), with additional analyses using SPSS 
version  24.  Statistical  assumptions  were  checked  and  met  for  each 
analysis.

3.1. Frequency and Description of sudden gains 

In  preparation  for  this  study,  the  first  author  viewed  a  sample  of 
recordings  of  six  pregain  (n)  CT-SAD  sessions  along  with  their  corre-
sponding pre-pregain (n-1) sessions as a control. This led to a hypothesis 
that  pregain  sessions  may  be  associated  with  a  greater  amount  of 
generalised learning relative to control sessions. To test this, we devel-
oped an original coding manual to facilitate the rating of tapes blinded 
to whether they were a pregain or control session, and permit analysis of 
interrater reliability. The coding manual (see Supplementary Material) 
operationalised  the  concept  of  generalised  learning  i.e.,  new  learning 
arising from any therapy activity that applies across a range of different 
social contexts and involves drawing a more general conclusion about 
the  self,  others,  or  social  situations.  Generalised  learning  (e.g.,  “I  am 
acceptable to others, and even when I feel anxious I come across well.”) was 
contrasted  with  specific  and/or  situational  learning,  where  a  client’s 
learning relates to a particular interaction or social situation (e.g. “At the 
party,  people  were  interested  in  what  I  was  saying.”).  Four  ratings  were 
made for each session. The first two scales rated the extent to which the 
therapist  asked  questions  aiming  to  elicit  generalised  learning  (e.g. 
“What does this say about the idea that you are unlikeable?”) and specific 
learning (e.g. “How did the other people respond on that occasion?”), using 
a 0–2 scale (0 = no questions, 1 = a limited number of questions, 2 =
numerous  questions).  The  remaining  two  scales  rated  the  extent  to 
which clients’ statements demonstrated the two forms of learning. These 
used 0–6 scales, with 0, 2, 4, and 6 indicating ‘no evidence’, ‘some but 
limited evidence’, ‘moderate evidence’, and ‘extensive evidence’ of that 
form of learning, respectively. A larger scale range was chosen given the 
more  nuanced  range  of  how  client  statements  may  indicate  learning 
compared to the extent of therapists’ questions. 

To ensure blind ratings, the selection and ordering of therapy tapes 
to be rated was performed by an independent research assistant as fol-
lows.  Firstly,  the  pregain  and  control  sessions  for  each  client  experi-
encing a gain (n = 32) were identified. In five cases where participants 
had sudden gains in two consecutive sessions, the later session was not 
selected  due  to  the  absence  of  an  appropriate  control  session,  and  in 
remaining cases where participants had more than one sudden gain, the 
largest gain was selected. Where a pregain session tape was not available 
(n  = 7),  this  session  and  the  corresponding  control  session  were 
excluded, and where a control session tape was not available (n = 5), the 
previous session (n-2) was used as a replacement. This resulted in 25 
tape pairs, each comprised of one pregain and one control session. An 
additional 13 pairs of sessions from participants who never experienced 
a sudden gain were added as foils (i.e., a 2:1 ratio). The session numbers 
of  these  foil  pairs  were  selected  to  match  the  frequency  of  session 
numbers in the sudden gains group. Tape pairs were viewed together by 
the first author, with the order counterbalanced so that pregain tapes 
were  viewed  first  50%  of  the  time.  The  order  of  tape  pairs  was 

Of the 1089 between-session intervals analysed, 77 were classified as 
sudden gains (7%). In the CT condition, 32 participants (64%) experi-
enced a sudden gain, 11 of whom experienced more than one, leading to 
a total of 44 sudden gains in this group. In the iCT condition, 25 par-
ticipants (51%) experienced a sudden gain, with nine of those experi-
encing more than one, leading to 33 sudden gains in total for this group. 
Chi-squared tests showed that the proportion of patients experiencing a 
sudden gain did not significantly differ between treatment conditions 
(χ2  = 1.707,  p  = .191),  nor  the  proportion  of  sudden  gain  sessions 
relative  to  the  total  number  of  inter-session  intervals  analysed  (χ2  =
1.461, p = .227). Among patients who experienced a sudden gain, the 
proportion of patients with more than one sudden gain was not signif-
icantly different between treatment conditions (χ2 = 0.016, p = .898). 
An independent samples t-test showed there was no significant dif-
ference in the mean magnitude of sudden gains in CT (M = 23.0, SD =
9.0) and iCT (M = 20.8, SD = 7.3): t(75) = 1.155, p = .252. On average, 
sudden  gains  represented  47%  and  56%  of  participants’  overall 
improvement on the LSAS across the CT and iCT interventions, respec-
tively,1 which is consistent with previous studies (e.g. 42.3% in Shalom 
& Aderka, 2020, p. 51% in Tang & DeRubeis, 1999). The distribution of 
the occurrence of sudden gains was relatively even across the course of 
treatment for both interventions, with the modal pregain sessions/weeks 
being five and twelve in CT and four in iCT. The average sudden gain for 
each treatment is shown in Fig. 1. 

3.2. Relationship to therapy outcomes 

A  linear  mixed  effects  model  was  used  to  test  for  differences  in 
therapy outcomes between participants who did and did not experience 
a sudden gain. This model used LSAS scores as the dependent variable, 
with  categorical  fixed  factors  of  time  (posttreatment  assessment  vs. 
three-month  follow-up  vs.  12-month  follow-up),  treatment  condition 
(CT vs. iCT), and sudden gain status (present vs. absent). A random ef-
fect of participant was specified to account for between-subject varia-
tion. The baseline LSAS score was entered as a covariate. Models used 
maximum  likelihood  estimation,  an  unstructured  covariance  matrix, 
and  retained  cases  with  missing  data.  The  assumption  of  normally 
distributed residuals was examined using Q-Q plots and found to be met. 
Pairwise  comparisons  indicated  that  participants  with  sudden  gains 
showed  lower  LSAS  scores  than  those  without  sudden  gains  at  the 
posttreatment (adjusted difference = 16.40, SE = 3.41, p < .001, d =
0.91), 3-month follow-up (adjusted difference = 14.70, SE = 3.41, p <

1  These  percentages  include  only  the  largest  gain  where  a  participant  had 

more than one.

independent  ratings  of  SAD  symptoms  using  the  ADIS,  with  pairwise 
comparisons  indicating  that  participants  with  sudden  gains  showed 
lower ADIS scores than those without sudden gains at the posttreatment 
(adjusted difference = 0.77, SE = 0.19, p < .001, d = 0.78), 3-month 
follow-up (adjusted difference = 0.76, SE = 0.20, p < .001, d = 0.77),

3.3. Changes on process measures around the gain 

Participants’  scores  around  sudden  gains  on  measures  of  negative 
social  cognitions,  self-focused  attention,  and  depressed  mood  were 
analysed using linear mixed effects models, where timepoint (n-2, n-1, n, 
n+1, n+2, n+3) in relation to the gain was specified as a categorical 
fixed factor,  and random intercepts specified to account for between- 

participant  variation.  Treatment  condition  was  not  specified  as  an 
additional  fixed  factor  in  order  to  simplify  the  models.  Models  were 
otherwise  specified  and  assumptions  examined  as  described  earlier. 
Planned  contrasts  compared  pairs  of  consecutive  timepoints.  Where 
participants had more than one sudden gain, their largest gain was used. 
Fig. 3 shows the mean scores on each measure around the sudden gain, 
and the results are given in Table 1. 

Results indicated that negative social cognitions (SCQ-frequency and 
SCQ-belief),  self-focused  attention,  and  depressed  mood  (PHQ-9) 
showed  a  significant  decline  simultaneously  with  the  sudden  gain  in 
social anxiety symptoms (n to n+1). Importantly, negative social cog-
nitions  and  self-focused  attention,  but  not  depressive  symptoms,  also 
showed significant reductions immediately prior to the sudden gain (n-1 
to n). For the SCQ-belief and self-focused  attention scales, the results 
suggested this prior cognitive change was relatively circumscribed to the 
immediate pregain interval because the preceding interval (n-2 to n-1)

did not show significant cognitive change. The SCQ-frequency subscale 
already  showed  a  significant  reduction  over  the  n-2  to  n-1  interval, 
which might indicate a cumulative effect, where cognitive changes build 
up over a few sessions leading to the sudden gain. 

3.4. Rating of sudden gain videotapes in CT 

Paired t-tests compared pregain and control sessions within partici-
pants who experienced a sudden gain. Results indicated that the ratings 
of  clients’  generalised  learning  were  significantly  higher  for  pregain 
sessions (M = 3.68, SD = 1.73) compared to control sessions (M = 2.76, 
SD = 1.59): t(24) = (cid:0) 2.554, p = .017, dCohen  = 0.51. Ratings of par-
ticipants’  specific  learning  were  not  significantly  different,  t(24)  =
(cid:0) 1.979, p = .059. The equivalent comparisons for the therapist rating 
scales were nonsignificant: therapists’ generalised learning questions, t 
(24) = 0.527, p = .603; therapists’ specific learning questions, t(24) =
(cid:0) 0.296, p = .770 (see Fig. 4, panel a). 

To  evaluate the  amount of learning between  participants who  did 
and did not experience a sudden gain, independent samples t-tests were 
used to compare the mean ratings for the pregain sessions of participants 
with a sudden gain, with the foil sessions of those without a sudden gain. 
Ratings of clients’ generalised learning, t(49) = (cid:0) 2.848, p = .006; and 
specific learning, t(49) = (cid:0) 2.694, p = .010; were significantly higher for 
participants  with  a  sudden  gain  compared  to  participants  without  a 
sudden  gain  (see  Fig.  4,  panel  b).  No  significant  differences  were 
observed  between  pregain  and  foil  sessions  in  the  extent  to  which 
therapists used generalised learning questions, t(49) = 0.178, p = .859; 
or specific learning questions, t(49) = (cid:0) 1.351, p = .183. Taken together, 
the videotape findings would suggest that generalised learning by the 
client is associated with the subsequent occurrence of a sudden gain, but 
the occurrence of generalised learning is not simply a function of ther-
apists asking more generalised learning questions. Other aspects of the 

4.1. Presence and frequency of sudden gains in CT and iCT 

Sudden  gains  were  found  in  both  CT  and  iCT.  The  proportions  of 
patients who showed sudden gains (64% and 51% respectively) were at 
the  higher  end  of  the  range  reported  in  a  recent  meta-analysis  of  all 
clinical conditions (Shalom & Aderka, 2020) and greater than the fre-
quencies of around 20% reported in the other studies of sudden gains in 
SAD (Bohn et al., 2013; Butler et al., 2019; Hofmann et al., 2006; Shalom 
et  al.,  2020; Thorisdottir et  al., 2018). The high  frequency  of sudden 
gains observed is perhaps not surprising given the high overall efficacy 
of cognitive therapy for SAD. In the trial from which the present data 
were drawn (Clark et al., 2022), the LSAS controlled pre-post effect sizes 
(dCohen) against waitlist were greater than 2. In addition, nine previous 
randomized controlled trials in different countries have found CT-SAD 
to  be  superior  to  a  range  of  alternative  psychological  and  pharmaco-
logical interventions (Clark et al., 2003, 2006; Ingul, Aune, & Nordahl, 
2014; Leichsenring et al., 2013; M¨ortberg, Clark, Sundin, & ÅbergWis-
tedt,  2007;  Nordahl  et  al.,  2016;  Stangier,  Heidenreich,  Peitz,  Lau-
terbach,  &  Clark,  2003;  Stangier,  Schramm,  Heidenreich,  Berger,  & 
Clark, 2011; Yoshinaga et al., 2016). The protocol for CT-SAD that was 
used in both delivery formats contains a number of discrete techniques 
such  as  the  self-focused  attention  and  safety  behaviours  experiment, 
videofeedback, and techniques for addressing socially traumatic mem-
ories, that often generate key realisations for the client, and can lead to 
significant symptom reduction in their own right (McManus et al., 2009; 
Wild, Hackmann, & Clark, 2007). Besides the particular treatment used, 
it is conceivable that the high frequency of sudden gains in this study 
was partly due to small differences in the criteria for identifying sudden 
gains, though this seems unlikely to be a major contributor as the pre-
sent study used a cutoff of 12 points on the LSAS for the first sudden gain 
criterion,  which  is  marginally  more  conservative  than  the  10-point 
cutoff  used  in  the  only  previous  study  using  the  LSAS  to  calculate 
gains (Hofmann et al., 2006). 

The presence of sudden gains within iCT demonstrates these large 
symptom  improvements can occur  within  online  therapies, consistent 
with previous findings (e.g. Hedman et al., 2014; Shalom et al., 2020). 
This is the first study to compare sudden gains between face-to-face and 
internet-based treatments that are identical in content, and it is notable 
that in all analyses no evidence of significant differences between the 
two treatment formats were found. Online sudden gains were compa-
rable  in  frequency,  magnitude,  and  clinical  significance  to  those  in 
face-to-face CT treatment. This indicates that the therapy content and its 
implementation appears to play a more significant role in determining 
participants’  large symptom  improvements,  compared to  the  medium 
through which the therapy is delivered. 

4.2. Relationship between sudden gains and treatment outcome 

Consistent with the broader sudden gains literature, the presence of a 
sudden  gain  during  therapy  was  associated  with  lower  social  anxiety 
scores  at  posttreatment,  in  both  CT  and  iCT.  Given  that  the  baseline 
LSAS scores of participants who had a sudden gain did not differ from 
those without a sudden gain, the results support the view that sudden 
gains represent a meaningful and clinically significant shift, rather than 
simply  artefacts  of  measurement.  The  association  between  having  a 
sudden gain and improved outcome was maintained across the three- 
month and twelve-month follow-up assessments for both CT and iCT, 
consistent with Bohn et al. (2013) and Shalom et al. (2020).

analysis, comparing the pregain sessions of those with a sudden gain (SG) and the sessions of participants not experiencing a sudden gain (Non-SG). Error bars 
represent ± 1SE. 

4.3. Changes on process measures around the gain 

Reductions in negative social cognitions and self-focused attention, 
two processes that are central to the Clark and Wells (1995) model, were 
observed  prior  to  sudden  gains  in  social  anxiety,  while  changes  in 
depressed mood were not. This suggests that cognitive and attentional 
changes during therapy may show a specific association with the pres-
ence  of  sudden  gains,  and  may  be  processes  that  drive  symptom 
improvement. This is the first study of sudden gains in SAD to find ev-
idence of cognitive change occurring prior to gains. There was evidence 
to indicate that most of this change happens immediately prior to the 
gain, but findings from the SCQ-frequency subscale indicate that a cu-
mulative effect from earlier sessions may also be possible, and this could 
usefully be explored further in future studies. 

Sudden gains in social anxiety symptoms were associated with con-
current  widespread  improvements  across  other  symptom  and  process 
variables.  These  include further  improvements in  cognitions  and self- 
focused attention, and improvements in mood. 

4.4. Videotape ratings in CT 

The results from the videotape ratings suggested an association be-
tween generalised learning and the subsequent occurrence of a sudden 
gain. As generalised learning represents a form of cognitive shift, this is 
consistent  with  the  earlier  findings  regarding  prior  cognitive  change. 
While the amount of specific learning was greater in pregain sessions 
compared  to  control  sessions,  the  difference  was  nonsignificant.  One 
interpretation  is  therefore  that  the  generalisation  is  particularly 
important, rather than the overall amount of learning. The dependent 
measure in this study (LSAS) assesses fear and avoidance across a wide 
range of social situations. Generalising learning from one situation to 
other  situations  would  therefore  be  necessary  to  achieve  a  large 

improvement. As social anxiety generally starts early in life and natural 
recovery is rare (Bruce et al., 2005), generalisation may be particularly 
important in overcoming such chronic negative beliefs and symptoms. 
Work from educational psychology suggests that ‘knowledge transfer’ 
depends on noticing that the current situation is similar to one you have 
learned about previously, but that failing to recognise this is extremely 
common  (Day  &  Goldstone,  2012).  Gumport,  Williams,  and  Harvey 
(2015)  found  that  generalising,  but  not  simply  thinking  about,  nor 
applying  the  learning,  was  associated  with  improved  outcomes  one 
week later in CBT for depression. Generalised learning therefore appears 
to  show  quite  specific  effects  and  may  represent  a  promising  line  of 
research with the potential to enhance treatment outcomes. It should be 
noted  however,  that  the  mean  rating  of  generalised  learning  during 
pre-gain sessions fell just below ‘moderate’ on the scale. This suggests 
that not all participants showed substantial generalised learning in this 
session. This implies that other factors may also have played a role in the 
occurrence of sudden gains. 

From a clinical perspective we may wish to consider whether and 
how therapists can facilitate more generalised learning, as it is possible 
that just one good question may make an important difference. Ques-
tions such as ‘What does this say about how acceptable you are to other 
people?’,  ‘How  do  others  respond  to  you  generally,  if  you  drop  your 
safety behaviours and let them get to know you?’, or ‘Do you think this 
might apply in other situations?’ may facilitate clients considering this, 
potentially  leading  to  greater  therapeutic  gains,  and  it  would  be 
important to examine this in future studies. 

4.5. Limitations 

First,  as  highlighted  previously,  although  we  followed  standard 
criteria for identifying sudden gains, these are open to criticism. Con-
cerns have been raised about the likelihood of ‘false positive’  sudden 

BehaviourResearchandTherapy166(2023)1043347G.R. Thew et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

gains  and  thus  their  clinical  significance,  and  although  the  present 
findings suggest this was unlikely, it remains possible that some of the 
gains  found  in  this  sample  occurred  by  chance  variation  in  scores. 
However,  in  the  interest  of  consistency  and  comparability  with  other 
studies,  we have  retained  the  original  criteria.  Second,  as  the  weekly 
questionnaire measures were completed immediately prior to each CT 
therapy  session,  it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  gains  that  occurred 
within a session from those that occurred during the rest of the week 
leading up to the next session. Repeated measurement before and after 
face-to-face therapy sessions may help to explore within-session changes 
more directly, though may be impractical within some study designs. 
Third, there was no control group in this study that had the repeated 
measurement required to assess sudden gains. It is noted that only six 
participants in the waitlist condition (n = 34) showed LSAS improve-
ments greater than 12 points in the seven weeks between baseline and 
mid-wait, and six participants in the seven weeks between mid-wait and 
post-wait. This suggests that sudden gains were perhaps less likely to 
have occurred in the waitlist group, but future studies could consider if 
weekly outcome measurement during a wait period is feasible, to permit 
the  direct  examination  of  sudden  gains  in  the  absence  of  treatment. 
Fourth, although the overall sample was relatively large, the subdivision 
between treatment conditions and sudden gain status resulted in more 
modest  sample  sizes  per  group,  which  may  have  limited  statistical 
power.  Replication  in  larger  samples  is  warranted.  Lastly,  the  coding 
manual used was developed specifically for this study, therefore has yet 
to be further validated in other studies. 

4.6. Conclusions 

This study has shown that sudden gains can occur in online therapies, 
and that these gains are similar in frequency, magnitude, and clinical 
significance to those seen in face-to-face CT. Sudden gains were common 
in  both  CT  and  iCT  and  were  more  frequent  compared  to  previous 
studies  of  social  anxiety  treatments.  Having  a  sudden  gain  predicted 
better  overall therapy outcomes. The results provided evidence of re-
ductions in negative social cognitions and self-focused attention occur-
ring prior to sudden gains, but not changes in depressed mood. Clients’ 
statements  in  CT  sessions  indicated  greater  generalised  learning  in 
pregain compared to control sessions, suggesting a possible association 
between generalised learning and the occurrence of sudden gains. Taken 
together, the results support the view that sudden gains reflect clinically 
meaningful events in therapy, that the online therapy format does not 
diminish  their  likelihood,  and  that  further  investigation  is  warranted 
into how learning from therapy generalises and how this may influence 
outcomes.
