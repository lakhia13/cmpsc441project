Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
are two debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders. The former is associated with social impairments
whereas the latter is associated with inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. There is recent
evidence that both disorders are somehow related and that genes may play a large role in these
disorders. Despite mounting human and animal research, the neurological pathways underlying
ASD and ADHD are still not well understood. Scientists investigate neurodevelopmental disorders
by using animal models that have high similarities in genetics and behaviours with humans. Mice
have been utilized in neuroscience research as an excellent animal model for a long time; however,
the zebraﬁsh has attracted much attention recently, with an increasingly large number of studies
using this model. In this review, we ﬁrst discuss ASD and ADHD aetiology from a general point of
view to their characteristics and treatments. We also compare mice and zebraﬁsh for their similarities
and discuss their advantages and limitations in neuroscience. Finally, we summarize the most recent
and existing research on zebraﬁsh and mouse models of ASD and ADHD. We believe that this review
will serve as a unique document providing interesting information to date about these models, thus
facilitating research on ASD and ADHD.

1. Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
are two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders that share symptoms and genes, making
it difﬁcult to understand and separate them. Common signs and symptoms include
difﬁculty paying attention and problems related to concentration, activity, and relationships.
However, although the same individual can have both conditions, there are key differences
in their prevalence, causes, diagnostics, and treatment therapies. ASD or autism refers
to a broad range of conditions characterized by repetitive behaviours and difﬁculties in
social skills, speech, and nonverbal communication. There are several subtypes of autism
caused by a combination of genetic and environmental inﬂuences, whereas ADHD (also
known as ADD) is not a spectrum disorder. Moreover, these disorders can cause a range of
difﬁculties from one individual to another. To research therapies for these disorders, animal
models are often used, especially mouse and zebraﬁsh models. This review focuses on ﬁrst
describing the two disorders and then presenting existing models of ASD and ADHD in
mice and zebraﬁsh.

1.1. Overview and Epidemiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
1.1.1. Overview

Autism or ASD is a neurological and developmental disorder affecting individuals
in diverse aspects of their life, such as interaction, communication, learning and social
behaviour. Symptoms are usually detected in early life (~2 years), and according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [1], individuals are
diagnosed with ASD if they demonstrate:
•
•
•

Difﬁculty communicating and interacting with others.
Limited interests and repetitive behaviours.
Troubles in functioning at school, work, and in society.

Although there is no cure for ASD to date, treatments and services can improve an

individual’s symptoms and daily life.

1.1.2. Prevalence

The worldwide prevalence of ASD is estimated to be close to 1.5% [2–5]. ASD preva-
lence varies depending on the year and the country dataset. Figure 1 was designed using
the results of existing ASD datasets (https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/
autism-prevalence-studies/9mw4-6adp, accessed on 20 April 2022). Figure 1A shows that,
in general, the highest prevalence was observed in Australia (39 per 1000), followed by
Sweden (21 per 1000) and Japan (19 per 1000), and a lower prevalence was observed in
Taiwan (2.21 per 1000). In Figure 1B, it can be seen that prevalence has been increasing
recently in some countries, such as Australia (from 3.92 per 1000 in 2002 to 39 per 1000 in
2014), Japan (from 1.55 per 1000 in 1983 to 19 per 1000 in 2015), the USA (from 0.33 per
1000 in 1985 to 15 per 1000 in 2019), and Denmark (from 0.43 per 1000 in 1962 to 11.4 per
1000 in 2011). These data suggest that external factors such as mode of life and industrial-
ization may have affected individual behaviours and could play a role in ASD occurrence.
However, prevalence rates may vary because of differences in diagnostic procedures and
reliability across countries, regions, and time frames.

1.1.4. Causes and Risk Factors

Genetics are primarily involved in the vast majority of ASD cases [7]. However,
nongenetic or “environmental” factors can increase the incidence of ASD in genetically
predisposed individuals [8]. Understanding ASD risk factors can contribute to a better
understanding of the biological basis of the disorder. Research has shown that an older
parental age also contributes to a higher incidence of their child having ASD [9]. Similarly,
having a sibling with ASD increases the incidence of developing ASD by 2–18% [10–13].
Studies have shown that among identical twins if one child has been diagnosed with ASD,
there is more than a 36–95% chance that the second child will also develop ASD. In the case
of nonidentical twins, the incidence is evaluated to be approximately 31% [10,11,14,15]. In
addition, individuals with certain genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome or Fragile X
syndrome, have a higher incidence of developing ASD [16–18]. These data suggest that
ASD could be the result of disruptions in genetic factors during prenatal development. Fur-
thermore, with the recent events of COVID-19, concerns exist about a possible connection
between childhood vaccinations and ASD development. Nevertheless, studies seem to
refute any link between vaccination and autism [19–22].

1.1.5. ASD Diagnosis

ASD is diagnosed by evaluating behaviour and development. Although diagnosis can
be performed at any age, it is better to diagnose ASD by the age of two, and treatments
can be started earlier for better efﬁcacy [6,23,24]. Figure 2 presents a summary of ASD
diagnosis, depending on the developmental stage.

Figure 2. ASD diagnosis. In young children, diagnosis is conducted at 2 different stages (general
developmental screening and additional evaluation). However, in adolescents and adults, diagnosis
is more difﬁcult, and symptoms are identiﬁed following performance in school or social behaviours.

1.1.6. Treatments of ASD

Once the diagnosis is conﬁrmed, ASD treatment should begin immediately because
treatment timing could impact the outcome [6]. The difﬁculty with ASD is that there is no
proper best treatment, as individuals face different kinds of diverse and complex symptoms.
Other reports have described the principal medications adapted for ASD. Principally, medi-
cations can help with the symptoms of irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, attention, and
repetitive behaviour. In addition, behavioural, psychological, and educational programs
involving specialists, caregivers and trusted family members are reported to help improve
social, communication, and language skills [25,26]. These therapies also have the advan-
tage of reducing abnormal behaviours and increasing the life skills necessary to overcome
the disorder. Of particular interest, depending on the age and the individual, cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) modiﬁcations can help. CBT approaches are performed to teach
individuals how to monitor their feelings and perceptions. CBT targets both cognition
(thinking) and behaviour (action) and is used as a therapeutic intervention for individuals
with anxiety and depression [27,28].

1.2. Overview and Epidemiology of Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
1.2.1. Overview

Inattention: difﬁculty doing a task and staying focused and organized.

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a particular disorder marked
by an alternation of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with
functioning or development. People with ADHD face an ongoing pattern of:
•
• Hyperactivity: moving constantly, including in inappropriate situations, or demon-
strating excessive ﬁdgets, taps, or talks. In adults, hyperactivity is manifested by
extreme restlessness or talking too much.
Impulsivity: acting without thinking or difﬁculty with self-control. Importantly, it
can be manifested by a desire for immediate rewards or the incapacity to wait for
gratiﬁcation.

•

1.2.2. Prevalence

ADHD prevalence can be classiﬁed into two types: among children and adolescents
and among adults. The average worldwide prevalence of ADHD is ~2.2% overall (range,
0.1–8.1%) in children and adolescents (aged < 18 years). From a range of countries in Asia,
Europe, the Americas and the Middle East, the prevalence is ~2.8% overall (range, 0.6–7.3%).
Worldwide prevalence data on ADHD in children are scarce; however, country-speciﬁc
prevalence studies have been conducted all over the world. As demonstrated in Figure 3,
the highest prevalence in 2017 was in the USA (8.1%), whereas the lowest was reported in
Iraq (0.1%), Poland (0.3%) and Romania (0.4%). Similarly, in adults, the lowest prevalence
was in Iraq and Romania (0.6% each), and the highest prevalence was reported in France
(7.3%) [29,30]. As was observed for ASD prevalence, the variability in ADHD prevalence
data may be due to diagnostic procedures and genetic and environmental factors.

1.2.3. Signs and Symptoms of ADHD

ADHD symptoms are expressed either by inattention or by hyperactivity-impulsivity.
However, both types of symptoms can be observed in the same individual. These symptoms
can be severe and impede social activity at school, work or in general life. Table 2 describes
the symptoms of individuals with ADHD and their different components.

1.2.4. Diagnosis of ADHD

In general, central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders such as stress, sleep dis-
orders, anxiety and depression can cause symptoms like those of ADHD. Therefore, the
diagnosis must be pronounced by having chronic or long-lasting symptoms of inattention
and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. In addition, these symptoms must be troublesome to the
person’s activities and lead them to fall behind typical development for their age. ADHD

symptoms are ﬁrst observed at the ages of 3–6 years old and can persist through adoles-
cence and adulthood or change as the individual grows up. Hyperactivity-impulsivity is
the most predominant symptom in childhood, and with age, the symptom of inattention
may become more prominent. In contrast, during adolescence, hyperactivity starts to lessen,
but inattention and impulsivity may remain. Inattention, restlessness, and impulsivity are
reported to persist into adulthood [31].

1.2.5. Risk Factors

Like ASD, the causes of ADHD are not well understood. However, the genetic compo-
nent seems to play a major role. In addition, environmental factors such as strong stimuli,
brain injuries, nutrition, and social factors might play a role in ADHD. It is important to
note that ADHD is more frequent in boys than in girls, and girls are more likely to demon-
strate inattention symptoms. Learning disabilities, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder,
depression, substance abuse, and early life exposure to chemicals such as lead or nicotine
from tobacco are often associated with ADHD [32,33].

1.2.6. Treatment of ADHD

To date, there is no cure for ADHD, but the symptoms can be managed with adequate
treatment. Current therapies include medication, psychotherapy, education, or a combina-
tion of treatments. Medication includes the use of stimulants that increase dopamine and
norepinephrine levels in the brain or non-stimulants that can also improve focus, attention,
and impulsivity. Antidepressants are sometimes used alone or in combination with a
stimulant to treat ADHD.

Psychotherapy including only individual treatment sessions with the child (without
parent involvement) is reported to not be effective for managing ADHD symptoms and
behaviour. This demonstrates that in addition to psychotherapy, parents and family par-
ticipation are important. Parents must reward positive behaviours, encourage behaviour
changes, and improve interactions with the person with ADHD. Similarly, ignoring or
redirecting the child’s inadequate behaviours can help improve symptoms.

1.3. Key Differences, Similarities and Conditions That Can Be Mistaken for ASD or ADHD

ASD and ADHD share several similarities and differences, as presented in Table 3. In
the same way, several conditions exist that may be confused with or appear along with ASD
or ADHD. It is important to discriminate against these conditions for appropriate treatment.
More, as described further in Section 3, researchers should be careful when using animal
models to investigate ASD or ADHD, as these models must speciﬁcally demonstrate face
validity, construct validity and predictive validity, to be accepted.

1.4. Molecular Biology and Mechanisms Underlaying ASD and ADHD
1.4.1. ASD

The dopaminergic system is mainly implicated in the neuropathology of ASD. In the
limbic and cortical brain which controls locomotion, emotion, cognitive and endocrine
functions, the rs6280 (C>T) SNP of the ﬁrst dopamine receptor D3 exon results in a serine
to glycine substitution (ser9Gly), leading to mental disorder [34]. More, the glutamate
metabotropic receptor 7 (GRM7) has spatiotemporal expression in the cerebral cortex,
cerebellum, and hippocampus [35], and an rs779867 (T>G) is an intronic polymorphism of
GRM7 strongly associated with ASD in children [36]. Similarly, recent evidence suggested
that the rs849563 (T>G) polymorphism located at exon 10 of neuropilin-2, the non-tyrosine
kinase cell surface glycoproteins, could contribute to ASD [37].

In addition, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity is suggested

in lymphocytic mitochondria, whereas plasma pyruvate levels were elevated in ASD
children [38].

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), an inﬂammatory cytokine produced by macrophages
and monocytes, is solicited during acute inﬂammation to mediate cell proliferation, differ-
entiation, and apoptosis [39]. Higher levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 and lower levels of
IL-2 were observed in ASD patients [40].

In addition, vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT1) has a role in the accumula-
tion of cytosolic monoamines into synaptic vesicles and is implicated in the mechanistic of
anxiety, affective, and alcohol addiction disorders. It has been demonstrated that rs1390938
G/A genotype polymorphism of VMAT1 is signiﬁcantly correlated with ASD [41].

Furthermore, vitamin D3 deﬁciency during pregnancy and early childhood was sug-
gested to be implicated in the progression of ASD [42]. Furthermore, the rs16976358 T>C
polymorphism of GTP-binding protein RIT2 is reported to play a role in ASD, Alzheimer’s
disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder [43].

1.4.2. ADHD

Two major pathways have been proposed to address the molecular biology of ADHD:
dysfunctions in the dopaminergic-fronto-striatal pathway and alterations of the circadian
rhythm. There is ample evidence of the implication of the dopaminergic system in the phys-
iopathology of ADHD [44]. Although neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine are also
implicated, only the dopaminergic system has been extensively explored [45]. As a matter
of fact, methylphenidate, a potent selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is a common medi-
cation used in ADHD treatment. Neurobiology and imaging systems have tried to delineate
ADHD mechanisms; however, ADHD behaviours are also manifested in several disorders,
making it difﬁcult to clearly explain it. Recently, molecular imaging has been suggested to
be useful in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of ADHD [46]. The dopamine

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7550

reuptake transporter (DAT) located in the striata is the site of action of methylphenidate
and allows the reduction of dopamine synaptic concentration [47]. By using molecular
imaging, scientists have suggested that an increase in DAT protein expression in the striata
due to genetic or environmental factors, could principally lead to ADHD [48]. However,
contradictory results exist to refute that hypothesis, conﬁrming again the variability and
inconsistency of results to explain ADHD molecular physiopathology [49]. Further, it has
been reported a high level of D2 and D3 receptors in patients with a history of perinatal
cerebral ischemia and ADHD symptoms. A mechanism of upregulation in postsynaptic
D2/D3 receptors was explained by loss in dopamine neurons due to the ischemia or an
increase in presynaptic dopamine reuptake [50]. Although dysfunction of the infraorbital
prefrontal cortex is implicated, the molecular biology of ADHD remains unclear.

A disturbed circadian rhythm and altered sleep are also key features of ADHD [51].
Circadian rhythm is driven by circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) genes,
which regulate several factors such as weight and mood, as demonstrated by obesity or
mood and CNS-related disorders occurring when these genes are altered. Similarly, ADHD
medications are known to improve sleep efﬁcacy and alter CLOCK genes’ expression [52].
At a molecular level, circadian rhythm is assured by several transcription-translation
feedback loops controlling the expression of CLOCK genes [53]. There is a recent accu-
mulation of evidence of circadian rhythm implication in ADHD molecular mechanisms.
For example, CLOCK genes aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1)
and period circadian regulator 2 (PER2) showed circadian rhythmicity in control patients
whereas ADHD patients showed inconsistency in addition to signiﬁcant phase delayed
cortisol rhythms [51]. Although there is evidence that the dopamine system and circadian
rhythm are fully implicated in ADHD, additional resources are needed to fully understand
this disorder.

2. Current Behavioural Tests of ASD and ADHD in Research

For a long period of time, mice were the most used animal models in behavioural
neuroscience research. Indeed, mice are mammalian species and can display a variety of
behaviours that resemble human diseases. In addition, the emergence of tools for direct
genome manipulation has allowed scientists to easily investigate the impact of genes on
development and behaviour [54,55]. However, recently, zebraﬁsh, or Danio rerio, a freshwa-
ter ﬁsh that inhabits rivers in several places in Asia, has gradually attracted the interest of
scientists. Indeed, zebraﬁsh have become one of the preferred in vivo model organisms for
studying diverse human diseases regarding developmental conditions [56,57], embryogen-
esis, regeneration, and behaviour [58–60]. In particular, zebraﬁsh offers many advantages
in the ﬁeld of neuroscience, such as good tractability, ease of genetic manipulation, and
amenability to high-throughput screens. Furthermore, zebraﬁsh embryos and larvae are
transparent, making them an excellent system for analysing developmental processes and
neural signalling in vivo.

Both mice and zebraﬁsh present some advantages and limitations, and it is important
to take them into consideration in the ﬁeld of neuroscience. In Table 4, we compare these
two species closely related to humans.

A valid model for any human disorder, including ASD or ADHD, should demonstrate

the following capabilities [61]:
•
•
•

Strong similarity to human phenotype.
Same biological phenomena that are responsible for the disease in humans.
Similar response to potential treatments used in humans.

Mice and zebraﬁsh have demonstrated their importance as animal models in neuro-
science. They validate the requirements for a valid model in evaluating ASD or ADHD
disorders, as demonstrated by several studies of their use as animal models in the core areas
affected in ASD and ADHD patients. Table 5 presents a summary of important behavioural
tasks in mice and zebraﬁsh to investigate ASD and ADHD.

social problems, attention difﬁculty and speech/language delays.

2.1. Behavioural Tests in Mice
2.1.1. The Social Approach Test

The social approach test evaluates sociability and preference for novel society and is
adapted to detect behavioural characteristics of ASD in mouse models [65–68]. As shown
in Figure 4, the apparatus is usually made of Plexiglass and consists of three chambers
(~20 × 40 cm per chamber). The test is performed in three phases. In phase 1, the three
chambers are separated, and a mouse, M1, is placed in the middle of the chamber and
allowed to habituate to the apparatus. After 5 min, a new mouse, M2, unfamiliar to mouse
M1, is placed in a small metal cage and introduced into one of the two side chambers.
An identical empty small metal cage is placed next to the adjacent side chamber, and the
chamber separators are removed. In phase 2, mouse M1 is allowed to move freely for
10 min. The duration of time that it spends in the chamber containing mouse M2 and the
duration of time it spends oriented towards the cage with its nose pointing less than 2 cm
from it is recorded. In phase 3, a new mouse, M3, is placed into the previously empty cage.
Mouse M1 is allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 10 min. The duration of time spent
in contact or oriented towards the new cage containing mouse M3 compared to the cage
with mouse M2 is also recorded [65–68]. A reduction in sociability time is associated with
an ASD phenotype.

Figure 4. The social approach test. In the test for sociability (A), the test mouse, M1, chooses between
spending time in the side with an unfamiliar mouse, M2, or in an empty side. In the test of preference
for social novelty (B), the test mouse, M1, is now given a preference choice between the ﬁrst mouse,
M2, and a newly introduced unfamiliar mouse, M3. Created with Biorender.com.

2.1.2. The Reciprocal Social Interaction Test

After 30 min of acclimation to the experimental room environment, a mouse is placed
in a cage containing fresh bedding. After 15 min of acclimation, a new mouse is added to the
cage, and the two animals are allowed to freely interact for a period of 20 min. Behavioural
events such as snifﬁng, following, grooming, mounting, huddling, and wrestling are
recorded [68,69]. For the ASD phenotype, a reduction in social interaction is observed.

2.1.3. Juvenile Play

Mice are brought to the testing environment a day before actual testing for habituation.
Each test subject is then moved to individual cages with no access to food or water for
1 h. Each mouse is then deposited in the play testing arena for a 10-min habituation
period. After all mice are habituated, each is replaced in its home cage with all cage
mates. In the actual test, individual bouts and durations of social interaction parameters,
including following, pushing past, crawling, nose-to-nose snifﬁng, anogenital snifﬁng
and social grooming, are recorded [68]. Social interaction parameters are reduced in the
ASD phenotype.

2.1.4. Repetitive Grooming Test

This is a simple test in which mice are ﬁrst individually acclimated in a video-equipped
cage for 10 min. Following the habituation period, the number of grooming sessions and

Social interaction parameters are reduced in the ASD pheno-type. 2.1.4. Repetitive Grooming Test  This is a simple test in which mice are first individually acclimated in a video-equipped cage for 10 min. Following the habituation period, the number of grooming ses-sions and total time spent grooming are determined by video surveillance at 10, 15, and 20 min [66–68]. An increase in grooming sessions is associated with ASD behaviours. 2.1.5. Repetitive Novel Object Test  In the repetitive novel object test (Figure 5), mice are evaluated for the frequency of repetitive contact with novel objects. On Day 1 of the test, mice are introduced to the ex-perimental room and left undisturbed for a 30 min habituation period. The next day, the animals are individually placed in an identical clean cage containing fresh sawdust bed-ding as well as four novel objects (small children’s toys) located approximately 4 cm from each of the four corners. Close contact with or burying of the novel objects is recorded during a 10-min session test. The occurrence of repetitive contact with three and four toys, the frequency of times that the mice buried each object, the total frequency of contact with each of the toys, and the total number of burying episodes are calculated [71,72]. Re-stricted and increased repetitive behaviours are a core feature of ASD. (A)Sociability(B)Social noveltyM1M2M3M2M1Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7550

An increase in grooming sessions is associated with ASD behaviours.

2.1.5. Repetitive Novel Object Test

In the repetitive novel object test (Figure 5), mice are evaluated for the frequency of
repetitive contact with novel objects. On Day 1 of the test, mice are introduced to the
experimental room and left undisturbed for a 30 min habituation period. The next day,
the animals are individually placed in an identical clean cage containing fresh sawdust
bedding as well as four novel objects (small children’s toys) located approximately 4 cm
from each of the four corners. Close contact with or burying of the novel objects is recorded
during a 10-min session test. The occurrence of repetitive contact with three and four toys,
the frequency of times that the mice buried each object, the total frequency of contact with
each of the toys, and the total number of burying episodes are calculated [71,72]. Restricted
and increased repetitive behaviours are a core feature of ASD.

2.1.6. The Social Transmission of Food Preference

The social transmission of food preference test is used to investigate the communica-
tion of information obtained through social interactions. As demonstrated in Figure 6, mice
can communicate and overcome their avoidance of a novel unfamiliar food by snifﬁng the
mouth, face and whiskers of another mouse. In step 1, a mouse M1 is given the new food.
In step 2, by socially interacting with that mouse, a different mouse M2 obtains information
regarding the food, and in step 3, the ﬁrst mouse is fasted overnight and given access to a
new food with different ﬂavours. The two mice are then left together for a period of 10 min.
Afterwards, the second mouse is fasted overnight and is given a choice between the two
ﬂavoured foods for the preference choice task [68].

2.1.7. The Resident–Intruder Paradigm

The test is performed to assess territorial aggression on ﬁve different days. On each
testing day, an unfamiliar intruder mouse is randomly assigned to a mouse (resident) for
interaction. The housing cage of the resident mouse is used as the interaction area. A
transparent Plexiglas separator that can enable visual, auditory, and olfactory perception is
placed in the middle of the cage to prevent direct interaction between animals. The intruder
mouse is placed on the other side of the plastic screen for a period of 5 min. The separator
is then removed, and the interaction is recorded for 5 min. The frequency of attacks and
bites and the latency to the ﬁrst attack, the number of lateral threats, and tail rattles are
analysed for all interaction days [65,88,89].

2.1.8. The Y-Maze Spontaneous Alternation Test

This behavioural test is used to assess working memory (Figure 7). Spontaneous
alternation can be evaluated by individually placing animals in one arm of a symmetric
Y-maze made of opaque black acrylic walls and recording the sequence of arm entries and
the total number of entries over an 8-min period session. This test evaluates the tendency
a mouse has towards choosing a distinct path from the one it previously chose (deemed
spontaneous alternation) and hence requires memory of its previous choice [66]. Deﬁcits in
spontaneous alternations are characteristic of the ADHD phenotype. However, this test is
not as deﬁnitive as the Barnes maze and other more specialized learning/memory tests.

Figure 7. The Y-maze spontaneous test in mice. Working memory is evaluated as in the Barnes
maze test.

2.1.9. The Barnes Maze Test

The Barnes maze test is a spatial-learning task that allows mice to use spatial hints
to locate a way of escaping from a mildly aversive environment. In this test (Figure 8),
mice can be assessed for their ability to learn the location of an escape box over the course
of 9 days in the Barnes maze apparatus. The escape hole is constant for each mouse over
5 training days, and each mouse is then tested three times per day for 4 days, followed by
no testing for 2 days and retesting on Day 7 [65,66]. Inattention and memory impairment
are typically observed in ADHD phenotypes.

2.1.10. The Impaired Vocalization Test

Ultrasonic vocalizations are recorded in mice after an experiment using a male subject
and female urine exposure [81,82]. Brieﬂy, vocal emissions and acoustic data during the
5 min female urine exposure are recorded, and an observer counts the number of ultrasonic
vocalizations emitted during the 5 min female urine exposure. In addition, the number of
ultrasonic vocalizations emitted during the ﬁrst 3 min of female urine exposure as well as
their numbers in 10 s time bins is determined, to evaluate the time course of the ultrasonic
vocalization response [80,81]. Reduced ultrasonic vocalizations are observed in mice with
ASD phenotypes.

2.2. Behavioural Tests in Zebraﬁsh
2.2.1. The Social Preference Test

Like the mouse social preference test, this test evaluates zebraﬁsh social behaviour
and locomotor activity (Figure 9). Brieﬂy, a target conspeciﬁc ﬁsh is introduced to a
conspeciﬁc compartment, separated by transparent sliding doors from the rest of the
apparatus. Zebraﬁsh are individually introduced to the central arena, which is separated
by sliding doors from the two arms of the corridor. After a short period of time, the
sliding doors are removed, and zebraﬁsh can freely explore the apparatus for 6 min. Their
behaviour is recorded, speciﬁcally the number of centre entries, time spent in the centre, the
number of “conspeciﬁc” arm entries, the number of “nonconspeciﬁc” (empty) arm entries,
total arm entries, and time spent in the respective zones of the apparatus [77]. Like the test
in mice, reduced social preference is indicative of an ASD phenotype.

2.2.2. Shoaling Test

Zebraﬁsh are shoaling animals and are observed in groups for their shoaling behaviour.
In this test, the distances (cm) between each ﬁsh in the group and the average interﬁsh
distance are recorded after an observation period of 20 min (Figure 10) [77,91]. Reduction in
shoaling behaviour is usually likened to the altered social interaction in ASD phenotypes.

The Barnes Maze Test  The Barnes maze test is a spatial-learning task that allows mice to use spatial hints to locate a way of escaping from a mildly aversive environment. In this test (Figure 8), mice can be assessed for their ability to learn the location of an escape box over the course of 9 days in the Barnes maze apparatus. The escape hole is constant for each mouse over 5 training days, and each mouse is then tested three times per day for 4 days, followed by no testing for 2 days and retesting on Day 7 [65,66]. Inattention and memory impairment are typically observed in ADHD phenotypes.  Figure 8. The Barnes maze test in mice. Different cues are given to the mouse to find an escape in the Barnes maze apparatus. Created with Biorender.com. 2.1.10. The Impaired Vocalization Test  Ultrasonic vocalizations are recorded in mice after an experiment using a male sub-ject and female urine exposure [81,82]. Briefly, vocal emissions and acoustic data during the 5 min female urine exposure are recorded, and an observer counts the number of ul-trasonic vocalizations emitted during the 5 min female urine exposure. In addition, the number of ultrasonic vocalizations emitted during the first 3 min of female urine exposure as well as their numbers in 10 s time bins is determined, to evaluate the time course of the ultrasonic vocalization response [80,81]. Reduced ultrasonic vocalizations are observed in mice with ASD phenotypes. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 43   2.2. Behavioural Tests in Zebrafish 2.2.1. The Social Preference Test  Like the mouse social preference test, this test evaluates zebrafish social behaviour and locomotor activity (Figure 9). Briefly, a target conspecific fish is introduced to a con-specific compartment, separated by transparent sliding doors from the rest of the appa-ratus. Zebrafish are individually introduced to the central arena, which is separated by sliding doors from the two arms of the corridor. After a short period of time, the sliding doors are removed, and zebrafish can freely explore the apparatus for 6 min. Their behav-iour is recorded, specifically the number of centre entries, time spent in the centre, the number of “conspecific” arm entries, the number of “nonconspecific” (empty) arm entries, total arm entries, and time spent in the respective zones of the apparatus [77]. Like the test in mice, reduced social preference is indicative of an ASD phenotype.  Figure 9. Social preference test apparatus in zebrafish.

Shoaling Test  Zebrafish are shoaling animals and are observed in groups for their shoaling behav-iour.

2.2.3. Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT)

This test investigates impulsiveness and attention by measuring the ability of zebraﬁsh
to respond to one of ﬁve perceptually identical stimuli that are applied randomly after a
variable intertrial interval. It was adapted from the 5-CSRTT in rodents (typically the rat or
mouse) and requires the animal to correctly identify which of the ﬁve apertures has been
brieﬂy illuminated to receive a reward. The results of this test in zebraﬁsh are demonstrated
to parallel those in mammals (Figure 11) [82,83].

2.2.4. The Novel Tank Test

This is the most commonly used test to assess locomotion and anxiety-like phenotypes,
as the recorded parameters can be used to assess hyperactivity [86–88]. After a pretreat-
ment period in a beaker, zebraﬁsh are introduced into a novel environment, where they
usually swim in the bottom section and gradually increase their swimming activity in
the upper sections of a tank. Total distance travelled, average speed, absolute turn angle
and immobility time are important parameters recorded during the 6-min test session
(Figure 12) [85–87]. In ADHD phenotypes, an increase in distance travelled and a decrease
in immobility time are generally observed.

2.2.5. The Mirror-Attack Test

Zebraﬁsh are placed in an experimental tank (L30 cm × H15 cm × W10 cm), and a
mirror is placed at the side of the tank (Figure 13). Before the test, zebraﬁsh are added to
the tank and allowed to habituate for 60 s. The aggressive behaviours toward the zebraﬁsh
mirror image are then recorded over a period of 5 min. The tank is divided into four equal
sections, and the number of entries and time spent in each section are recorded [69,70,90].

Plexiglas box and measuring mouse movements during a ﬁxed period (5–60 min) [93,95,96]

swim speed, active swim time and total distance swum are measured (Figure 14B).

2.3.2. The Predator Avoidance Test

In this test, a natural predator of zebraﬁsh or mice is introduced into a tank/cage well
known for a given subject, and the following parameters related to avoidance and fear are
recorded: distance between predator and test subject, predator approaching time, geotaxis,
locomotor/swimming activity, turn angle, number of freezing episodes, and time spent
frozen (Figure 15) [78,79]. In ASD, these parameters are modiﬁed to denote an increased
avoidance of natural predators.

a 6-min period. The number of centres and total arm entries and the number of freezing
episodes and freezing duration are documented (Figure 16) [77]. Stereotyped behaviours
and reduced exploratory activity are typical of ASD phenotypes.

3. Mouse Models of ASD and ADHD Research

The development of an animal model is a common approach to studying the mech-
anisms of a speciﬁc disease or disorder. Given the complexity of ASD and ADHD and
their aetiology, genetic or pharmacological models are mainly used. Genetic models have
recently been explored with the advent of new genetic tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9 gene-
editing technologies. These tools can mimic either ASD or ADHD symptoms and reﬂect
the neurobiology in animals. In general, animal models should mimic a clinical disorder as
much as possible, with similar symptoms, treatment responses, and pathophysiology. More
speciﬁcally, an adequate ASD or ADHD model should have three types of validity [64]:
•

Face validity: mimic the fundamental behavioural deﬁcits found in ASD or ADHD
individuals;
Construct validity: conform to the proposed pathophysiology or known therapeutics
of ASD or ADHD;
Predictive validity: predict unknown aspects of ASD or ADHD such as its genetics,
neurobiology, or therapeutics.

3.1. Genetic Mouse Models of ASD

There are multiple genetic mouse models that can imitate ASD-like phenotypes in
humans, and the majority of existing genetic models have been obtained by performing
reverse genetics (alteration of the orthologous ASD-linked genes in mice) [61]. According
to the SFARI GENE Database (https://gene.sfari.org/autdb/GS_Home.do, accessed on
10 May 2022), to date, more than 281 genes have been used to explore ASD phenotypes
in mouse models [97]. We ﬁrst discuss some of the most important or frequently reported

models. A comprehensive list of mouse models of ASD candidate genes and the main
phenotypes observed is presented in Table 6.

3.1.1. Black and Tan Brachyury (BTBR) T+ tf/J Mice

This mouse strain has demonstrated social behaviour impairments such as reduced
interaction, aversion for frontal interaction; communication impairments such as altered
patterns; high levels of repetitive behaviours such as increases in self-grooming and persis-
tent burying behaviours; and difﬁculties in learning-related tasks. BTBR T+ tf/J mice also
show alterations in the development of the brain, and several ASD-linked genes have been
identiﬁed to be disrupted in this strain [98,99].

3.1.2. The Shank3 Knockout Mice

SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3) is a postsynaptic density protein
which plays a role in the structural and functional organization of the dendritic spine and
synaptic junction [100]. Shank3 includes an ankyrin repeat domain, a PDZ domain, and a
Homer binding domain. Mutations can be inserted at each different domain, resulting in
different impairments related to ASD phenotypes. For example, mice with a mutation in
the ankyrin domain display impairments in excitatory neurotransmission and long-term
potentiation; however, they show no trouble with sociability and only slight differences
in ultrasonic vocalizations and repetitive behaviour [101,102]. Mice with a mutation in
the PDZ domain display much more severe phenotypes, such as highly persistent self-
grooming leading to skin lesions, impaired sociability, and reduced corticostriatal excitatory
transmission [102]. When the mutation is at the Homer binding site, Shank3 KO mice
demonstrate more aggressiveness, reduced long-term potentiation, and enhanced long-
term depression [103]. This strain is particularly interesting due to the diverse mutations at
different sites resulting in different types of behaviours using the same gene.

3.1.3. Fragile X Syndrome

Fragile X syndrome is one of the most frequent genetic causes of intellectual disabili-
ties, and more than 30% of individuals with Fragile X syndrome meet the diagnostic criteria
for autism [18]. Constriction at the end of the X chromosome is associated with a critical
expansion of CGG triplet repeats, transcriptionally silencing the fragile X messenger ribonu-
cleoprotein 1 (Fmr1) gene [104,105]. Fmr1 is a multifunctional polyribosome-associated
RNA-binding protein playing a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plastic-
ity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic
transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs [100]. Mice with a
mutation in Fmr1 display impairments in long-term potentiation and abnormal social, cog-
nitive, and anxiety-related behaviours [95,106–108]. The Fmr1 mutation is also implicated
in the upregulation of mGluRS receptors [109]. Interestingly, crossing mGluRS knockout
mice with Fmr1 gene KO mice leads to rescue of the long-term depression and attenuation
of seizures [110].

3.1.4. The E3 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase (Ube3a) Gene and 15q11-13 Duplication
Maternal/Paternal

The 15q11-13 mutations are linked to duplication or gene deletion. For example, the
loss of maternal genomic information at the 15q11.2-13 locus is responsible for Angel-
man syndrome, whereas paternal genetic material leads to Prader–Willi syndrome [111].
In individuals with ASD, maternal duplications and triplications of the 15q11-13 locus
have been frequently observed. Interestingly, Ube3a is the sole gene expressed from the
maternal allele in mature neurons, and its deletion or mutations are responsible for Angel-
man syndrome [112]. It serves as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin
from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and transfers it to its
substrates [100].

3.1.5. The Contactin-Associated Protein-like 2 (Cntnap2) Gene

Cntnap2 plays a role in the formation of functionally distinct domains critical for salta-
tory conduction of nerve impulses in myelinated nerve ﬁbres [100] and its mutations are
responsible for a syndromic form of ASD, cortical dysplasia, and focal epilepsy syndrome.
The symptomatic form of the disorder consists of epileptic seizures, language regression,
intellectual disability, and hyperactivity. KO mice for the mutation demonstrate autistic
traits, a diminution of interneurons and abnormal neuronal network activity. However,
abnormal behaviours are amended following risperidone administration [113]. It is impor-
tant to mention that Cntnap2 has also been found in a different mouse inbred strain located
in divergent regions within the C58/J gene [114].

3.1.6. Rett Syndrome

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) is a chromosomal protein that binds to methy-
lated DNA [100]. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the Mecp2 gene, and only
affects girls, as it is linked to chromosome X [115]. The syndrome is characterized by
intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, seizures, early death, and autism. Interestingly,
KO of the Mecp2 gene in males provokes a total loss of function, whereas, in females, there
are evident ASD-linked behaviours [116]. In addition, loss of Mecp2 from GABAergic
neurons recapitulates different phenotypes such as repetitive behaviours, characteristic of
Rett syndrome and ASD. More, Mecp2 deﬁciency provokes a reduction in glutamic acid
decarboxylase (Gad) 1 and 2 levels, suggesting that the implication of Mecp2 in GABAergic
neurons function is critical and that its mutation could alter GABA neurons and contribute
to ASD [117]. It is noteworthy to mention that generation of a Mecp2-overexpressing mouse
model or the use of an antisense oligonucleotide strategy successfully restored normal
Mecp2 levels and phenotype in Mecp2 duplication adult mice [118].

behavioural abnormalities similar to those observed in autistic patients [115,206,207]. In ad-
dition, neuroanatomical and cellular changes similar to those in human ASD are observed
in rodents exposed to VPA [208]. Other antipsychotic drugs have also been used, such as
the glutamatergic antagonist phencyclidine (PCP; Table 7).

3.3. Genetic Mouse Models of ADHD
3.3.1. The Dopamine Transporter Knockout Mouse (DAT-KO)

The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a presynaptic plasma protein found on dopaminer-
gic nerve terminals that terminate dopamine signalling by rapidly sequestering dopamine
released into the synaptic cleft [215,216]. The DAT-KO mouse demonstrates behavioural
characteristics of ADHD, such as spontaneous hyperactivity and deﬁcits in spatial mem-
ory [64,217,218]. The knockdown of DAT is responsible for a decrease in dopamine; never-
theless, dopamine metabolites, such as homovanillic acid (HVA), are increased, whereas
the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) concentration does not vary [219]. In DAT-
KO mice, a decrease in D1 and D2 receptors with approximately 50% decreases in both
their mRNA and protein levels in basal ganglia have been previously reported [220,221].
DAT-KO mice also demonstrate important cognitive impairment in the eight-arm radial
maze, a test of spatial learning [217,222]. Interestingly, stimulants such as amphetamine,
methylphenidate, and cocaine can inhibit the hyperactivity observed in DAT-KO mice,
but dopamine levels in the neostriatum were not increased when mice were administered
these drugs [217,219,220,222]. Fenﬂuramine and quipazine (5-HT agonist) and ﬂuoxetine
(SRI antidepressant) also antagonize the hyperactivity observed in DAT-KO mice [222].
It is important to note that this mouse model also presents with abnormalities such as
premature death or growth retardation, making it a less useful model. Indeed, no more than
68% of the homozygotes survived by week 10, and female mice show impaired maternal
behaviour [220,223].

3.3.2. Coloboma Mutant Mouse

The coloboma mutant (Cm) mouse was developed by application of neutron irra-
diation, and the heterozygote Cm+/− mouse, which is the only viable strain, shows a
variety of defects that resemble core features of ADHD. It shows, for example, delayed neu-
rodevelopment and behavioural deﬁcits such as hyperactivity and impulsivity [224–227].
Treatment with low doses of d-amphetamine (2–4 mg/kg) reduces hyperactivity, whereas
methylphenidate (2–32 mg/kg) increases hyperactivity [225]. In addition, this mouse
model has a mutation in the synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) gene, and the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7550

23 of 41

authors suggest that the behavioural performance of coloboma mice could be related to
SNAP25 dysfunction [225,228]. Further investigations are needed to better understand
the mechanisms.

3.3.3. Acallosal Mouse Strain I/LnJ

The I/LnJ mouse shows total callosal agenesis with complete penetrance, with be-
haviours such as learning deﬁcits and hyperactivity, a reduced number of brief stops and a
decrease in habituation in an open ﬁeld [96,229]. Behavioural hyperactivity in this callosal
agenesis model was demonstrated to be related to functional dominance of the right hemi-
sphere because of the lack of callosal connections. However, neurotransmitter activity in
this model remains unstudied.

3.3.4. The Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta 1 (Thrb1) Transgenic Mouse

This model of ADHD carries a mutant human Thrb1 gene linked to human resistance to
thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome [230]. Thrb1 is a nuclear hormone receptor having a high
afﬁnity for thyroid hormones and can act as a repressor or activator of transcription [100].
The Thrb1 transgenic mouse shows hyperactivity; however, it does not demonstrate impul-
sivity or signs of inattention [231]. Nevertheless, a promoter for the Thrb1 gene was used to
demonstrate impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity in these mice [232]. The authors
also suggested that an elevated dopamine turnover in these mice could be related to the
catecholaminergic system [232]. It has been demonstrated that abnormal thyroid hormone
levels can cause negative effects on brain development and cognition [233]. However, it is
important to mention that the role of the thyroid system in ADHD remains unclear.

3.3.5. α-Synuclein-Deﬁcient Mice

The synucleins consist of a family of three proteins (α, β, γ), which are mainly
present in presynaptic terminals [234–236]. The α-synuclein protein was demonstrated
to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease [237–240], suggesting that α-
synuclein is important in the regulation of dopamine. Interestingly, mice lacking α- and
γ-synuclein demonstrate signs of hyperactivity [241], which is associated with an increase
in dopamine release.

3.4. Pharmacological and Environmental Mouse Models of ADHD
3.4.1. Juvenile Mouse with a Neonatal 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Brain Lesion

A polymorphism of the D4 receptor has been linked to ADHD [242–245]. To investigate
the role of the D4 receptor in ADHD, mice with neonatal 6-OHDA lesions can be useful
because of the lack of D4 receptor activity. However, they do not show hyperactive
behaviour compared to the wild type [246].

3.4.2. Exposure to Chemicals

Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
or to pharmacological agents such as nicotine might lead to ADHD [32,247,248]. Mice ex-
posed to lead from birth demonstrated important levels of spontaneous motor activity that
were reduced by treatment with amphetamine and methylphenidate [249,250]. Analysis of
forebrain tissue of mice following early life exposure to lead demonstrated an increased
high-afﬁnity transport of L-tyrosine and a decreased uptake of choline and dopamine. How-
ever, tissue levels of acetylcholine and dopamine were not increased [249,250]. Similarly,
mice that were exposed to nicotine showed a full range of ADHD-associated behavioural
phenotypes, including working memory deﬁcits, attention deﬁcits and impulsive-like
behaviours. Nevertheless, the mechanisms and genes implicated have not been fully
investigated [251–253].

3.4.3. Maternally Stressed Mice

Adult offspring of mice treated with restraint stress during pregnancy have been
shown to be hyperactive [254]. Furthermore, wheel-running activity is increased in these
mice even after three days of habituation, and dopamine antagonists reduce this activ-
ity. Additionally, studies suggest a correlation between stress during pregnancy and
ADHD [255,256]. However, the mechanisms remain unexplained.

4. Zebraﬁsh Models of ASD and ADHD in Research
4.1. Genetic Zebraﬁsh Models of ASD

One useful aspect of zebraﬁsh is the ease of genetic manipulations on embryos and
larvae. The most used zebraﬁsh models consist of morpholino-based (MO) expression
silencing. MOs are small modiﬁed oligonucleotides that can bind a selected target by com-
plementarily knocking down gene function without altering its sequence [61,257]. Several
examples of morpholino-based studies for ASD candidate genes exist and are presented
in Table 8. However, MOs are effective temporarily, up to 4 days post fertilization (dpf),
which does not allow the study of gene function beyond the early life of zebraﬁsh [258].
Moreover, they can lead to off-target effects, resulting in nonspeciﬁc phenotypes for the
gene of study [259,260]. Furthermore, targeted induced local lesions in the genome (TILL-
ING) is a technique that has also been used. This technique is based on exposure to
ethylnitrosourea (ENU), an alkylating mutagen that induces error-prone replication and
leads to random point mutations in the genome. Sequencing is then performed to identify
loss-of-function mutations. Several zebraﬁsh ENU-KO models for ASD exist and are also
presented in Table 8. Last, nuclease-based technologies, such as transcription activator-like
effector nucleases (TALEN) and zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (ZFN), were recently established
to improve the generation of novel zebraﬁsh lines (Table 8) [261,262]. TALENs have a
broader target potential but are restricted to simple mutations [263,264]. More recently,
CRISPR/Cas9 technology has allowed the development of interesting zebraﬁsh models
(Table 8) [265–267].

Table 8. Principal zebraﬁsh ASD models and phenotypes observed. This table presents the main
zebraﬁsh models in the literature and the reported phenotypes. ENU: ethylnitrosourea; MO: mor-
pholino, TALEN: transcription activator-like effector nucleases; ZFN: zinc-ﬁnger nucleases.

The use of mutant zebraﬁsh to study gene function is a challenging task because
gene loss-of-function manipulations may leave signiﬁcant amounts of mRNA produced by
the targeted gene [294]. To facilitate the task for researchers, the Simons Foundation for
Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) has curated zebraﬁsh lines with mutations in zebraﬁsh
ASD risk genes (https://www.sfari.org/resource/zebraﬁsh-models/, accessed on 10 May
2022). To date, eight lines with validated loss-of-function are available for distribution
(arid1b, chd8, dync1h1, fmr1, mecp2, mef2c, pten and scn1a/scn2a). These loss-of-function lines
were validated by direct measurement of target mRNA or protein levels [295]. Of note,
six genes with loss of function (cntnap2, dyrk1a, grin2b, nrxn1, shank3, and syngap1) have
been validated but are not yet available at the Zebraﬁsh International Research Center
(ZIRC). Furthermore, based on the association of each gene with autism incidence, SFARI
has established a gene scoring system classifying ASD genes into one “syndromic” category
or one of three “idiopathic” categories: category 1 (high conﬁdence), 2 (strong candidate),
or 3 (suggestive evidence) (https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/, accessed on
10 May 2022). Table 9 summarizes these genes with their classiﬁcation score. Because this
review also describes ADHD, when there is an association of the gene with ADHD, we
mentioned it.

4.2. Pharmacological Zebraﬁsh Models of ASD
4.2.1. Valproic Acid

The most-reported pharmacological model is valproic acid (VPA), a drug that is
known to induce autism-like effects in animal models. Originally, VPA was used as an
anticonvulsant drug to treat seizures, and studies have demonstrated that embryonic
exposure to VPA can lead to ASD in children [296–298]. VPA has been implicated in ASD
by using various animal models, such as rats, mice and prairie voles [205,299]. Exposure
of larval zebraﬁsh to VPA results in phenotypic changes such as reduction of neural cell
proliferation in the telencephalon [300] and decreased locomotor activity [301].

4.2.2. Other Drugs

The noncompetitive glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
dizocilpine (MK-801) induces impaired shoaling and aggression in zebraﬁsh [302,303]. The
abnormal behaviours are reversed by oxytocin and carbetocin but not by the oxytocin
receptor antagonist L-368,899 [302]. Acute nicotine administration decreases shoaling
behaviour (low effect on shoaling polarization), whereas acute ethanol mildly decreases
shoal cohesion and affects polarization [304]. Additionally, the D1 receptor antagonist
SCH23390 was demonstrated to decrease social preference in the zebraﬁsh AB strain [305];
however, there was no sign of altered motor function or vision. Lead pollutants are also
used to generate ASD zebraﬁsh models, as they decrease shoal cohesion and increase
anxiety-like freezing and edge preference [306]. The water-soluble fraction of crude oil also
signiﬁcantly increases anxiety and locomotor activity, decreases repetitive behaviour, and
reduces the level of serotonin in zebraﬁsh larvae [306]. Developmental exposure to the
organophosphate chlorpyrifos is responsible for a decrease in dopamine levels in zebraﬁsh
until adulthood [307].

4.3. Genetic Zebraﬁsh Models of ADHD

Several genetic models have been developed to study ADHD in larval and adult
zebraﬁsh. Latrophilin 3 (lphn3), a G-protein-coupled receptor belonging to the adhesion
subfamily, is a regulator of synaptic function and maintenance in brain regions that mediate
locomotor activity, attention, and memory for location and path [308]. Down-regulation
of the lphn3 gene ortholog lphn3.1 induces hyperactivity and impulsivity in zebraﬁsh, as
observed in ADHD patients [75]. The neuromedin U (nmu) gene plays a role in pain, stress,
immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases and feeding regulation, and its mutants present a

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7550

27 of 41

hypoactive phenotype [309]. In addition, KO of the CLOCK gene period1b (per1b) implicated
in the circadian rhythm, is responsible for hyperactivity, impulsivity, and circadian distur-
bance phenotypes similar to ADHD [310]. In the same way, as observed for ASD, cntnap2
mutants display ADHD-like phenotypes such as hyperactivity and GABAergic deﬁcits in
the forebrain [276]. Knockdown of the gene DEP domain containing 5, GATOR1 subcomplex
subunit (depdc5), a protein-coding gene, generates mutants that demonstrate hyperactiv-
ity and cognitive deﬁcits [311]. Similarly, knocking down the gene micall2b ortholog in
zebraﬁsh leads to animals with hyperactive/impulsive behaviours. These behaviours were
corrected by the administration of atomexine [312]. Furthermore, morpholino knockdown
of exosome component 3 (exosc3) in zebraﬁsh embryos causes abnormalities such as micro-
cephaly and poor motility [313]. Moreover, cyclin K (ccnk) knockdown impairs brain and
spinal cord development [314]. The X-linked genetic syndrome associated with mutations
in the taf1 gene causes developmental delay [315]. KO of the gene bromodomain PHD ﬁnger
transcription factor (bptf), suggested to be implicated in the regulation of transcription, causes
smaller head size and craniofacial abnormalities [316]. Mutations in the transcription factor
mecp2 gene are observed in more than 90% of Rett syndrome patients who also show
signs of mental retardation. Interestingly, mecp2 KO zebraﬁsh show reduced swimming
activity [317] and deﬁcits in neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene expression [318]. The gene per1b
ortholog KO in zebraﬁsh results in hyperactive juveniles, with increased aggressiveness.
This mutant zebraﬁsh also shows a decrease in levels of dopamine in the brain [310]. In
the case of the 5-HT system, the 5-HT synthesis enzymes TPH1 and TPH2 [319–321] and
transporter genes serotonin transporter (SerT)/solute carrier family 6 member 4 (slc6a4) which
encodes an integral membrane protein that transports the neurotransmitter serotonin from
synaptic spaces into presynaptic neurons, have also been demonstrated to impact ADHD
phenotypes [322]. Several dopaminergic system-related genes have been linked to ADHD
phenotypes. This is the case for the gene encoding the dopaminergic D4 receptor DRD4, the
dopaminergic D5 receptor DRD5, and the dopaminergic transporter (DAT)/solute carrier
family 6 member 3 (slc6a3) [323,324].

4.4. Pharmacological Zebraﬁsh Models of ADHD

Pharmacological models of ADHD using zebraﬁsh are scarce. Zebraﬁsh exposed to
1% alcohol demonstrated motor hyperactivity. The mechanism involved is relevant to
dopaminergic neuron stimulation [325]. Similarly, the associative learning performance
of embryonic alcohol-exposed ﬁsh is impaired, and a small amount of alcohol reaching
the embryo results in lasting cognitive deﬁcits [326]. Additionally, neurodevelopmental
exposure of zebraﬁsh to ethanol causes learning and memory deﬁcits [326–329]. Nicotine
is a toxicant leading to ADHD in humans; however, few studies have evaluated the effects
of nicotine on ADHD phenotypes [32,330–333].

Similarly, it has been reported that environmental lead (Pb) exposure can result in
neurological alterations leading to ADHD phenotypes. For example, Pb exposure decreases
the density of axon tracts in the zebraﬁsh midbrain and forebrain, corresponding to the
downregulation of two genes at 14 and 16 hpf (hours post-fertilization), respectively [334].

(A) 1254 on visual avoidance behaviour were evaluated in zebraﬁsh larvae at 7 dpf, show-
ing elevated levels of thigmotaxis and higher levels of freezing relative to controls [335].
Methylphenidate, an ADHD medication, was evaluated in early life exposure experiments,
and it resulted in a transient increase in dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, together
with long-term impairment in the predatory avoidance response and spatial learning [336].
The environmental contaminant perﬂuorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) accumulates in the brain
and has potential neurotoxic effects. It was previously shown to induce behavioural alter-
ations such as increased spontaneous hyperactivity, a phenotype that was corrected by the
administration of dexamphetamine in zebraﬁsh larvae [337].

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, zebraﬁsh and mice are useful models to investigate neurodevelopmental
disorders such as ASD or ADHD. There is an increase in research on these disorders using
either mouse or zebraﬁsh experiments. However, the choice of a model to investigate
a particular aspect of each disorder demands speciﬁc considerations, as we described
that both mouse and zebraﬁsh models include advantages and limitations. Studies to
understand the genetic and neurochemical mechanisms should be considered, together
with research on animal models to investigate the behavioural aspects of the disorders. The
most important thing to consider is the impact of the proposed research on the scientiﬁc
community. As demonstrated in this review, the results obtained from zebraﬁsh, taking
into consideration the advantages of this model, can be further extrapolated to mouse
models and eventually humans, thus providing extensive information on different aspects
of the disorders.
