Abstract
Purpose  To explore the experiences of refugee mothers and community health nurses participating in a nurse home visit-
ing program in Denmark, focusing on the program’s effects on the psychosocial well-being of refugee mothers during the 
transition to motherhood.
Methods  The nurse home visiting program was an add-on the public care offered to all families, with extra training of the 
community health nurses and more time to engage with the families with immigrant and refugee backgrounds. Community 
health nurses (12) and participating women (9) participated in qualitative interviews between September and December 
2020, following the program’s conclusion.
Results  Utilizing the Resource-Based Model of refugee adaptation as a theoretical framework, we identified four main 
themes: (i) negotiating parenting norms and gaining confidence through parenting resources; (ii) finding emotional support 
to cope with integration pressures; (iii) expanding social resources, (iv) building bridges with welfare state services. These 
themes captured the resources gained by mothers through the home visiting program, positively influencing their psychoso-
cial well-being, while also acknowledging the impact of the socio-political context on community health nurses’ work and 
mothers’ daily lives.
Conclusion  Findings offer insights about the potential and limitations of tailored nurse home visiting programs for refugee 
families, emphasizing the positive impact on mental health. However, challenges such as assimilation pressures, unwelcom-
ing immigration policies, and discrimination may hinder program effectiveness.

Introduction

By the end of 2018, there were 2.4 million refugees in the 
European Union, half of whom women and girls, many in 
their prime childbearing years (UNHCR 2018). Refugee 
mothers often face multiple challenges: low incomes, lin-
guistic barriers, uncertain residency, restricted healthcare 
access, and discrimination (Castaner et al. 2021; Stevenson 
et al. 2023; Niner et al. 2013). Further hardships emerge

from disrupted social support networks, fostering feelings 
of loneliness and isolation (Ganann et al. 2020; Wachter 
et al. 2022). These strains, coupled with exposure to trauma 
during migration, manifest in the psychosocial well-being 
of refugee mothers: a recent meta-analysis showed a peri-
natal  depression  prevalence  of  33.5%  (Stevenson  et  al. 
2023), double the rate of the non-migrant population. It is 
therefore crucial to develop maternal care models to bolster 
the psychosocial well-being of refugee mothers during the 
perinatal period (Balaam et al. 2021). Although there are 
various models and definitions of psychosocial well-being, it 
is generally recognized as a dynamic state of overall health, 
encompassing both psychological (e.g., self-acceptance, 
purpose, life satisfaction, autonomy, personal growth, and 
the ability to manage stress) and social (e.g., connectedness, 
sense of belonging, and positive social interactions) dimen-
sions of a person’s life (Kumar et al. 2020; Burns 2017).

This state reflects both intrapersonal and interpersonal func-
tioning (Lent 2004; Silva and Pereira 2023).

This study delves into an add-on nurse home visiting 
(NHV) program with refugee mothers in Denmark, explor-
ing their experiences and the program’s impact on their psy-
chosocial well-being after childbirth. NHV programs stand 
as effective public health interventions to reduce health 
inequities and social inequality (Duffee et al. 2017). NHV 
has exhibited positive impacts on parental responsiveness, 
infant survival (Wüst 2012), child development (Henwood 
et al. 2020; Peacock et al. 2013; Richter et al. 2017), and 
maternal  mental  health  (Goldfeld  et  al.  2021).  There  is 
robust evidence demonstrating the positive impacts of the 
Nurse-Family Partnership, an intensive prenatal and postna-
tal home visitation program for low-income first-time moth-
ers, on maternal and child health (Miller 2015). However, 
little is known about how nurse home visiting can support 
the well-being of refugee mothers and how both mothers 
and healthcare providers perceive their participation in such 
programs (Molloy et al. 2021).

Clarke (2021) revealed the perceptions of refugee moth-
ers regarding home visitors as being particularly instrumen-
tal in facilitating connections with the healthcare system. 
However, mothers expressed a desire for more support that 
addressed their roles as mothers and not solely the health 
of their children (Clarke 2021). Likewise, a UK study high-
lighted how home visitors had to prioritize essential physi-
ological and safety needs, such as secure housing, as well 
as the needs of infants over those of mothers (Drennan and 
Joseph 2005).

Through interviews with refugee mothers and commu-
nity health nurses (CHNs), we zoom into a specific nurse 
home visiting program in Denmark to uncover insights into 
the ‘CHNs integration’ (in Danish’ Sundhedsplejersker sty-
rker integration (SSI) program’s effects and tensions. We 
ask refugee mothers about their experiences of participating 
in ‘CHNs integration’ and whether and how the program 
enable their psychosocial well-being in the transition to 
motherhood in Denmark. To do so we draw on the Resource-
Base Model (RBM) of refugee adaptation (Ryan et al. 2008), 
which emphasizes how refugees’ psychosocial well-being 
hinges on how changes in available resources enable them 
to meet their needs, long-term goals and aspirations, and 
internal and external demands. Access to resources is influ-
enced by the socio-political context, which can enable or 
constrain them. For example, temporary forms of residence 
can hinder refugees’ ability to find stable employment and 
restore material resources, leading to a negative spiral of 
resource loss and thus poor well-being. In contrast, the 
socio-political context can facilitate refugees’ well-being 
by providing holistic approaches that recognize refugees’ 
agency in defining their needs and goals (Chase & Rous-
seau, 2018). Using RBM as a theoretical lens, as depicted in 
Fig. 1, allows us to examine how refugee mothers perceive 
changes in resources from participating in the home visiting 
program. It also helps us explore how these changes relate to 
their needs, goals, and societal demands, and how they con-
tribute to their psychosocial well-being. At the same time, 
this approach remains mindful of the structural tensions that 
may arise due to the socio-political context of the program.

Methods

Program description

SSI was implemented from 2017 to 2019 across 15 munici-
palities in Denmark for families with children under six. The 
program included five additional visits to the existing uni-
versal visiting program over one year. During the first visit, 
community health nurses (CHNs), supported by an inter-
preter, used a mind mapping exercise. Mind mapping, first 
described by Buzan and Buzan (Buzan and Buzan 2006), uti-
lizes graphic representations to express major themes radi-
ating from a central concept. This technique was designed 
to foster creative thinking, explanation and exploration of 
dilemmas and tensions. It has also been used in healthcare 
settings (Pringle 2019; Russell et al. 2020). In SSI, the CHN 
used mind mapping to understand the family’s background 
and needs. CHN asked questions like: ‘Who were you back 
home? What are the good things in your life now? What 
do you dream about? Is there anything challenging in your 
life that we can work on together?’ and, together with the 

families, recorded details about family members and areas 
where support was needed. This helped guide the selection 
of visit packages, which could be adjusted based on ongoing 
discussions. Subsequent visits focused on five broad themes: 
pregnancy, parent-child relationships, multicultural parent-
ing, health, and integration (see Fig. 2). CHNs also con-
nected families with other services. Although the program 
concluded after a year, some families continued to reach out 
to CHNs with questions about their children’s development 
and local resources. See appendices for further details.

Study design and participants

The ethics committee at Copenhagen University approved 
the study, which began in September 2020. This study was 
independent of the SSI internal evaluation (Ramboll 2020). 
To provide a holistic perspective on the intervention, we 
included both community health nurses (CHNs) and refugee 
mothers. While the CHNs shared their views on the inter-
vention’s underlying assumptions, goals, and their experi-
ences with implementation, the mothers provided firsthand

accounts of their care experiences and the impact of the 
intervention on their daily lives.

We employed a purposive sampling strategy to select 
four municipalities, where we interviewed eleven CHNs and 
nine refugee mothers. Initially, we planned to conduct group 
interviews with CHNs in each municipality. As a result, we 
conducted three group interviews with four, three, and three 
CHNs in each group, respectively. In the fourth municipality, 
however, only one nurse was available to participate. The 
purpose of the group interviews was to foster discussion 
among the nurses about their experiences and practices.

In contrast, we conducted individual interviews with the 
nine refugee mothers to provide a safe space to share their 
personal experiences. Our study focused specifically on 
mothers in the perinatal period. Therefore, we invited only 
women who had enrolled in the program either toward the 
end of their pregnancy or immediately after giving birth, and 
who were 18 years of age or older. Data was collected from 
September to December 2020.

All CHNs were part of SSI since the inception of the pro-
gram, had at least five years of experience, and were Danish 
born. All nine mothers participated in SSI in 2019 and had 
refugee backgrounds. Mothers were from Syria (5), Eritrea 
(2), Iran (1), and Uganda (1), were between 23 and 37 years 
old, had between one to three children, and had lived in Den-
mark between one and six years. Five mothers had their first 
child in Denmark, seven lived with their partners and two 
were single mothers. Only one mother could communicate 
fluently in Danish.

Data tools and analysis

Women’s interview guide aimed to gather participants’ expe-
riences with SSI in the context of migration and becoming 
a mother in Denmark. The interview for CHNs focused on 
their experiences participating in SSI, challenges, and per-
ceived benefits for women (see Appendix).

All participants could choose to be interviewed in their 
preferred language. Two women chose to be interviewed 
in English, one in Danish, one in Farsi, four in Arabic, and 
one in Tigrinya. In addition, two women requested to do the 
interviews with their husbands present. Group interviews 
and individual interviews with CHNs were conducted in 
Danish (3) and English (2). The first author participated in 
all interviews but performed only the ones in English. A 
Master student conducted the other interviews in Danish. 
Interviews in Farsi, Arabic, and Tigrinya were conducted 
with a bilingual interpreter. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, 
we did eight of the nine interviews with women and three 
of the five interviews with the group of CHNs using vide-
oconference. Interviews were digitally audio recorded, then 
transcribed to English (see Appendix).

The data were analyzed in Nvivo using thematic analysis 
based on Braun and Clark (Clarke and Braun 2017). We 
followed five analytic steps: (1) becoming familiar with the 
data, (2) generating codes, (3) generating themes, (4) defin-
ing and naming themes, and (5) finding examples. The first 
author (MM) coded the data from mothers, while the sec-
ond author (VP) coded data from community health nurses 
(CHNs). MM then reanalyzed both data sources to identify 
areas of convergence and divergence, ensuring distinct per-
spectives were acknowledged and highlighting overarching 
patterns. Using our theoretical framework and the concepts 
of resources, goals, and demands, MM identified twenty-
seven basic themes reflecting the experiences of both moth-
ers and CHNs (see Table 1).

In collaboration with the last author (SFV), these codes 
were clustered into four main themes that captured the voices 
of both groups. To validate the findings, MM conducted two 
additional group interviews with seven of the eleven CHNs 
and discussed analytical ideas with other researchers in 
migration and maternal health. After presenting the results 
to various academic audiences, MM reviewed the data for 
evidence that could challenge the identified themes, ensuring 
the complexity of participants’ narratives was represented.
The main themes (see Table 1) serve as subheadings in 
the findings below, illustrating how the resources activated 
in interactions between health visitors and refugee families 
help refugee women navigate life in Denmark and support 
their psychosocial well-being.

Findings

Negotiating parenting norms and gaining 
confidence through parenting resources

Mothers  experienced  a  transition  from  a  community 
approach to raising children to more individualized forms 
of mothering in Denmark, where parents are considered the 
caregivers and are expected to make independent decisions 
about the pregnancy and their babies. Particularly first-time 
mothers experienced challenges navigating the demands of 
parenting in Denmark. ‘I had a lot of worries. I didn’t have 
somebody to help me, and I couldn’t speak the language. 
I didn’t know where the doctor was and how you raise a 
child.’ (M2). In this transition, CHNs played an important 
role in strengthening women’s agency and resourcefulness.

In my country the family does everything. Here when 
you have a child you do it yourself. But I say to myself, 
I can do it, I can do it. When I don’t understand some-
thing, I call Maria (the CHN). (M1)

CHNs were described as part of ‘us’, the refugee fam-
ily, but also part of ‘them’, Danish society. As Naila put it,

M. Marti-Castaner et al.

‘…she (CHN) has become a part of us, this is something 
good (M6)’. From a resource-based perspective, this rela-
tionship was valuable because mothers and CHNs shared the 
same aspirations–providing a good future for the children. 
Women described CHNs as ‘baby experts’ and that meant 
they could be trusted to talk about parenting. Through the 
relationship with the CHN, mothers gained knowledge and 
practical guidance about infant healthy eating, sleeping rou-
tines, and a child’s health or developmental expectations, 
contributing to their increased confidence in raising their 
children in Denmark. CHNs often became a substitute for 
the female kindship they missed and allowed them to main-
tain some collectivistic disposition. 

‘She (CHN) is my friend now. When I have problems, 
she tells me ‘call me if you need anything about Ana 
(the child)’… I was very happy that now my kid is in 
good hands’ (M1).

Mothers also highlighted CHNs’ role in resolving ten-
sions arising from different familiar parenting practices and 
parenting Danish norms, such as early introduction of solid 
foods, encouraging mobility from a young age, letting babies 
sleep outside in prams or bringing babies to daycare at ten 
months.

and educational institutions. However, CHNs recognized 
how that must entail a challenging dialog and negotiation 
where CHNs fostered the value of parenting resources and 
cultural background and reflected about their own position. 
‘We (CHN) have to take a little step back from our own cul-
ture and listen to the culture that we meet (CHN4)’.

Finding emotional support to cope with integration 
pressures

Most mothers found emotional support in their conversa-
tions with CHNs. They offered families a space to share 
and helped them find additional support if they needed. The 
mind map activity facilitated this process. Mothers described 
how the experience of drawing, and visualizing their past 
and present life, their strengths and needs, helped them give 
meaning to some of the experiences they had and how they 
felt. 

‘Imagine  doing  and  drawing  your  whole  life  on  a 
paper, that’s something that relieved me a lot.’ (M4).

This was particularly important for women who were dis-

tressed like one mother said: 

I was frustrated. My son has pain in his stomach, I 
want medicine, here in the pharmacy they didn’t give 
me medicine, she (CHN) said to me, “they (parents), 
here, they don’t use medication a lot” … She (CHN) 
said, “with basic movement you can (help) relax your 
child”. Then it means, there are no reason for the ten-
sion and frustration, it means, things are simple. (M5)

‘my  psyche  was  very  tired…from  the  weather,  the 
alienation, being far from home, being a stranger in 
a country, it was very hard.’ (M5). For her, the most 
important aspect of the program was the emotional 
support. ‘I felt that she helped me more rather than the 
children…I really relaxed when she talked to me, her 
concern about me, I really relaxed.’ (M5).

When mothers had to negotiate between the ways of car-
ing for children that were known to them with Danish nor-
mative parenting, the CHNs offered families an insider view 
into new parenting norms. ‘How to raise a child is different 
in Denmark compared to Iran. She taught us the Danish way 
of raising children because my child will live in Denmark, so 
that was a big help” (M4). From a resource-based perspec-
tive, mothers gained new parenting resources in dialogue 
with CHNs.

However, the idea that there is a ‘Danish way’ of parent-
ing may also become problematic. One mother described 
how other mothers in her community found the support 
unnecessary.  ‘There  are  some  of  my  friends  that  were 
annoyed  by  the  repeated  visits.  They  said,  we  are  also 
mothers and have raised [children], so we know, this is 
not necessary (M4)’, suggesting how normative mother-
hood (O’Reilly 2023) can turn from a helpful resource to an 
oppressive structure and create tensions between families 
and CHNs that represent the welfare state.

From the nurses’ perspective, discussing Danish parent-
ing norms was crucial to ease transitions into Danish society 

Mothers also experienced demands to learn Danish and 
enter the labor market. Such demands could become exces-
sive and detrimental to well-being. ’There is a system from 
above that says you have to go to work, you have to get an 
education, otherwise we will take your services. And there 
is a family that has a trauma, that make it really hard to 
live up to’ (CHN5). CHNs had the double role of promoting 
integration while caring for the family’s well-being. CHNs 
tried to turn the ‘pressure’ to integrate into encouragement 
to explore educational and job opportunities while advocat-
ing for families in front of integration officials. Such emo-
tional support encouraged some mothers to challenge gender 
norms and pursue new opportunities outside the home.

I told her ‘I am feeling this way’ (feeling sad). She 
(CHN) tried to help me. All my thought was that I had 
to stay within the limits of the house. I am a mother 
that has children (four). I should stay at home. I should 
take care of these children. That was my thoughts. But 
after I sat with her…I can also go out, I can also study, 
I can also work, I can do a lot of things…I started 

Refugee mothers’ mental health in Denmark: possibilities and limits of home visiting programs  

251

thinking more, I was more relieved, It is really possible 
that I can also do that (M4).

CHNs experienced this dialogue as a balancing act, where 
they were curious about families’ background and offered 
emotional support while discussing what CHNs described 
as ‘Danish values’ important for integration (i.e. gender 
equality).

However, the emotional support, the encouragement and 
recognition, could not help mothers cope with the uncer-
tainty  of  their  temporary  permits  and  public  discourses 
against refugees. At the time of the interviews, the Danish 
government had started revoking some refugees’ residency 
permits. All women expressed their fear and worry for their 
children’s future.

I think my boys have a good future here (in Denmark) 
but I am also worried about what is happening, seeing 
that they want to send some Syrians back. And that 
really worries me (M7).

When women started to imagine a future in Denmark, 
anti-immigration policies reminded them about the uncer-
tainty of their legal status, which made them feel unwel-
comed, and threaten their well-being. ‘When they (govern-
ment) speak that refugees shall return. I don’t feel like there 
is future’ (M5).

Expanding social resources

CHNs facilitated mother groups and encouraged mothers 
to participate in local activities such as Danish language 
groups. Participating in these groups created at first some 
insecurities among mothers. ‘I hesitated, the language, I 
don’t know it.I didn’t have any motivation to go’ (M5). From 
CHNs’ perspective, expanding mothers’ social networks was 
a way of supporting their mental health and their integra-
tion into Danish society ‘In relation to mental health, this is 
exactly where we can help to create a network…The network 
is incredibly important, to get out among others and see 
some role models (CHN6)’.

From a resource-based model perspective, by framing 
these interactions as a place where refugee mothers could 
exchange their experiences and knowledge, CHNs contrib-
uted to reinforcing mothers’ psychological resources of self-
efficacy and helped mothers to gain new social resources.

She encouraged me, she said ‘you should try, and see, 
you will be better …language isn’t important, there 
is a lot one can do, with signs… Its right, they might 
be educated, but you also have experience…they will 
also be benefited from you, and you will benefit from 
them"…And it was a really beautiful experience, There 
were difficulties in the language…But it passed, we 
understood each other (M4).

Connecting with other mothers enabled them to create 
new bonds ‘I can’t say that they replaced my mother and 
mother-in-law, but it was a replacement, a replacement that 
I was very comfortable with’, and create friendships and a 
sense of community.

CHNs recognized that creating these opportunities to 
expand mothers’ social networks was challenging, for prac-
tical reasons (i.e. lack of transport), and a lack of a shared 
language or experiences. Few mothers also discussed how 
they  had  created  their  own  networks  (family  members 
that migrated before, or mothers they meet at the asylum 
center). Therefore, ‘prescribing’ mother groups was not suit-
able. Instead, understanding mothers’ needs for new social 
resources and actively facilitating such opportunities, par-
ticularly when mothers experienced social isolation, was 
considered more effective.

Building bridges with welfare state services

From a RBM perspective, mothers shared a demand over-
load as they lacked cultural resources (e.g. Danish language 
and knowledge about welfare services) to navigate wel-
fare state services, namely healthcare and early childhood 
services, that were not fully adapted to meet the needs of 
newly arrived refugee families. These challenges were com-
pounded by the rigid rules of the integration system.

“They [job centers] have these rules they follow, and 
if you have been absent four times, they take your 
subsidies, and then we push them [refugee families] 
further and further out, and they [refugee families] 
cannot always do that. They do not have the resources 
to tell what is important and why it has been that way. 
(CHN 5)

When parents had to contact the healthcare system, sign 
up their children for nursery, or navigate the demands from 
integration services, CHNs offered practical resources. They 
went to the nursery with families, assisted with housing sup-
port applications, or called their doctor to ensure their needs 
were understood and they could receive care promptly‘I 
didn’t have the knowledge about signing up, and when I had 
a meeting with the daycare, she (nurse) came with me. It was 
nice having someone caring. (M3)’. Receiving such support 
made families feel connected and cared for by the CHN.

CHNs also advocated for families, particularly when fac-
ing multiple adversities, such as trauma, low literacy, or dis-
ability, attempting to convince integration services of the 
harmful effects of overburdening families with strict rules 
and regulations.

CHN4: we could use that collaboration with the job 
center and the integration department, and the fact 
that  if  there  was  a  problem…was  it  you  who  had 

252

a family, where we redeemed the mother from not 
doing an internship or language school for a period 
of time? (CHN4)
CHN3: It was me yes. A mother who had just lost her 
husband. They had recently arrived in Denmark, and 
he passed away from a very serious illness. She was 
in a new country, alone, with her twin children. She 
had come from another municipality, and in this one, 
they told her: “You have to attend language school, 
you have to do an internship, and the children must 
be cared for outside the home.” When I visited her, 
she was completely overwhelmed. She looked terri-
ble, so I had to contact various agencies, arrange a 
meeting at the kindergarten, call the job center, and 
consult my own doctor—basically, coordinate eve-
rything to create a unified plan. Eventually, she was 
exempted from both the internship and some of the 
other demands, and she started attending language 
school. She began to improve, and I see her often 
now. She lives on a road I frequently drive along, so 
we wave at each other. She looks completely different 
these days.

CHNs leveraged their positions to negotiate with insti-
tutions  responsible  for  family  integration.  The  project 
empowered them to challenge rigid integration plans set by 
job centers, language schools, and case managers, which 
often  overlooked  the  specific  needs  of  families.  While 
CHNs were aware of integration rules and their role was 
to support integration into Danish society, they based their 
decisions on discussions with families and the relation-
ships they developed over time. Mothers noted that CHNs 
understood both their needs and preferences and the work-
ings of Danish institutions, allowing them to act in the 
families’ best interests: ‘she helped me to find the best 
daycare for my child (M3)’.

CHNs went beyond their usual roles, helping moth-
ers  rehearse  phone  conversations  with  doctors,  which 
equipped them with the skills to handle similar situations 
independently after the CHNs had left. By gaining social 
and cultural resources through their relationships with 
CHNs, mothers felt less stressed navigating unfamiliar 
systems  and  became  more  confident  in  advocating  for 
themselves. One mother told her CHN, 

“You have given me faith that I can do things myself. 
Everyone wants us to succeed.”

However, CHNs acknowledged that learning to navigate 
these systems required time—often beyond the duration of 
the program—and a positive attitude from professionals 
interacting with refugee families. They reflected on the 
limitations of their roles within a broader social system 
that remained challenging for refugee mothers, where they 

continued to experience discrimination. The following 
exchange between two CHNs highlights the complexities 
of the system and their frustrations in trying to assist refu-
gee mothers:

CHN 1: The experience of the distrust to the system 
and the fact that we also are a part of the system, we 
also hear that they have distrust elsewhere. Job center, 
the bank….
CHN 2: I sometimes get asked “it’s because I’m dark 
that they do not want to talk to me”, “You must help 
me then” and that feeling of not being good enough 
and that you are not welcome… we can not take their 
background away from them…Integration is a difficult 
size … we’ve got our eyes on it too. Not that it should 
sound negative but it is true that we have seen that it is 
a wide size and much wider that our program.... 
CHN 3: You have to help them with everything pos-
sible with these contexts and when I meet them again 
a few years later, they say “we are in the same posi-
tion”. During SSI we collaborated a lot with integra-
tion consultants. We could give them some tasks, and it 
was really good, they were really happy that we could 
have this collaboration. We also had some meetings 
together. But this is closed now.

Overall,  the  SSI  project  gave  CHNs  the  flexibility  to 
engage with integration services, early childhood education 
centers, or doctors, advocating for refugee families. By help-
ing families understand and engage with welfare services, 
CHNs guided them in overcoming barriers while nurturing 
their self-efficacy. However, concerns remain about the pres-
sures to assimilate and experiences of discrimination and 
racism within and outside public institutions.

Discussion

Our study, informed by the RBM of refugee adaptation, 
underscores the positive impact of a tailored home visit-
ing program for refugee families. Specifically designed to 
support the well-being and integration of refugee families, 
this program expands mothers’ resource pool (Ryan et al. 
2008), aiding them in navigating the demands of integra-
tion into Danish society and strengthening their psychosocial 
well-being. Our findings reveal that refugee mothers acquire 
parenting resources, emotional support, and opportunities to 
build social networks which enhances their self-confidence, 
autonomy, and reduces stress, while by focusing on their 
shared goal of providing a better future for their children. 
This aligns with studies exploring postnatal care models 
involving peers or bicultural workers (Paris 2008; Rogers 
et al. 2020, 2023).

253

Notably, our work emphasizes how refugee mothers 
can form meaningful bonds with home visitors who don’t 
share their cultural background and who represent a wel-
fare state institution. By allowing time for relationship-
building,  flexibility  in  defining  CHNs  roles,  balancing 
family’s needs and pressures to integrate, and having a 
shared focus on the baby’s well-being, trust is cultivated, 
enabling mothers to gain resources from this connection. 
This is aligned with Willey et al. (2018), who argues that 
nurses require more time and flexibility to build relation-
ships with refugee families and develop intercultural com-
munication skills and cultural self-awareness. Our findings 
emphasize the importance of understanding the “gain of 
resources” in the resource-based model (Ryan et al. 2008) 
within a relational context, where health and social care 
providers can create a safe space by listening and respond-
ing to the families’ needs and goals (Kassam and Marcel-
lus 2022).

However, our research also highlights the impact of the 
broader socio-political context and assimilation notions on 
mothers’ ability to utilize resources for their aspirations. 
Mothers experience a dissonance between feeling cared for 
by CHN and feeling unwelcomed in Denmark and pressured 
by the Danish government. Recent shifts in Danish immigra-
tion policies, with weakened protection and stricter require-
ments to obtain permanent residency, intensify concerns 
voiced by women about the effects such policies have on 
themselves and their children.

Structural injustice theories (Young 2001; Powers and 
Faden 2019), allow us to critically analyze the constraints 
within which CHNs operate. Applying a structural injustice 
approach, which focuses on the way in which economic and 
social structures affect mental health and well-being rather 
than zooming on individuals and their conditions, allows 
us to see the limit of ‘the assistance’ the CHNs could offer 
refugee mothers.

Firstly, it can be argued that the support is founded on 
an ideology of integration, which runs the risk of increas-
ing pressures to assimilate. Despite mothers being grateful 
to learn about Danish parenting norms and expectations, 
these approaches should critically re-assess and carefully 
revise static assumptions about ‘good Danish parenting’ that 
potentially dismiss refugee’s mothers parenting resources, 
values, and beliefs (Matthiesen and Society 2019). As some 
CHNs pointed out, negotiating parenting norms and what is 
best for the children requires a constant dialogue between 
families and CHNs, where CHNs dare to revise their own 
cultural assumptions about ‘good parenting’. Still, when 
there is pressure to assimilate (exerted by integration poli-
cies), refugee mothers may be confronted with a problematic 
trade-off which might lead to dismissing some of their native 
practices not necessarily because they are inferior but only 
because such practices will make integration harder.

Secondly, the CHNs create bridges between mothers, 
families, and other institutions, yet, developing knowl-
edge and understanding about how welfare state institution 
work takes time and mental resources. The fact that refu-
gee families experience discrimination and racism across 
other institutions is a reminder that promoting the psycho-
social well-being of refugee mothers and their children 
must be a collective effort and that should extend beyond 
the period of early childhood.

In sum, we argue that there is a need to further exam-
ine the effectiveness of nurse-home visiting models such 
as the one we have studied to improve maternal mental 
health outcomes among refugees. More importantly, effec-
tiveness studies must examine how social and structural 
determinants intersect with well-intentioned public health 
programs.

Our findings have several limitations. Since the study 
was not part of the original intervention design, we only 
accessed refugee women through the CHN, potentially 
introducing selection bias toward positive program experi-
ences. Still, mothers reflected on broader community expe-
riences, revealing tensions like paternalism and assimi-
lation  narratives.  Future  research  should  also  examine 
families with minimal program engagement.

Additionally, our small sample of municipalities and 
participants limits generalizability. While mothers consist-
ently benefited emotionally and socially from the program, 
further research should consider the impact of contextual 
factors like community resources and organizational fac-
tors of nurse visiting programs in diverse contexts and 
municipalities. Nevertheless, the use of the RBM enables 
theoretical abstraction, fostering relevance to other studies 
analysing motherhood in diaspora.

In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance 
of  advocating  for  family-centered  models  that  address 
the unique needs of refugee families in the broader com-
munity, social, and cultural context. Tools such as mind 
mapping may facilitate dialogue between families and pro-
viders, fostering a mutual understanding of the families’ 
goals and needs. This, in turn, can support CHNs in pro-
viding social, cultural, and emotional resources to refugee 
families. Such models can assist mothers in navigating 
parenting in a foreign country and promote their mental 
health. However, we must further unpack how underly-
ing assimilation assumptions can create tensions and dis-
engagement between welfare services offering postnatal 
care and refugee families. More participatory methods that 
engage communities in the co-design of interventions can 
foster models of postnatal care that are more inclusive and 
less shaped by normative assumptions around motherhood.
