Neuropsychological Perspective

Abstract

The behavior patterns of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention that would ultimately become 
recognized as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been described for 
centuries. Nevertheless, in the past 35 years, advances in diagnostic methods, identification of 
biomarkers, and treatments have advanced at an exponential rate. ADHD is now recognized as the 
most common behavioral disorder of childhood, with risks extending well into adulthood for both 
males and females, leading to its identification as a significant public health issue. This historical 
neuropsychological review of ADHD emphasizes scientific highlights in the past 35 years related 
to ADHD, including the evolution of the diagnosis (from Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood to 
ADHD), influential theories (executive functions, cognitive-energetic, delay aversion), landmark 
treatment studies (Multimodal Treatment of ADHD [MTA] and Preschool ADHD Treatment 
Study [PATS]), and advances in brain mapping techniques (anatomic, functional, and resting state 
magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging). The review concludes by highlighting the 
challenges of studying and treating a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder like ADHD, 
with emphasis on associated disorders and conditions (learning disabilities, sluggish cognitive 
tempo), special populations (girls, preschoolers, adults), and recommendations for scientific 
inquiry in the next 35 years. Neuropsychologists are well positioned to address the clinical and 
research challenges of the next generation of studies, especially involving advances in 
understanding the sexual dimor.phism, full developmental course, and dynamic risks associated 
with ADHD.

disorder of childhood affecting nearly approximately 10% of U.S. children ages 4–17 years 
(Pastor, Reuben, Duran, & Hawkins, 2015), although worldwide estimates are lower (around 
5%) and differ as a function of varying diagnostic methods, practice guidelines, and access 
to specialized clinical care (Polanczyk, de Lima, Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007).

Symptoms of ADHD typically begin in early childhood, have a chronic course, and 
adversely affect the academics and social interactions of affected individuals (American 
Academy of Pediatrics, 2011). Despite advances in diagnostic processes, identification of 
biomarkers, and multimodal treatment, individuals with ADHD often struggle both socially 
and academically, even when treated. Approximately two-thirds of individuals have at least 
one co-existing developmental or psychiatric condition, such that “simple” ADHD is 
considered the exception rather than the rule (Larson, Russ, Kahn, & Halfon, 2011).

ADHD is now recognized a major public health issue (Hinshaw & Ellison, 2016). Recent 
estimates suggest that the annual incremental societal costs associated with ADHD total over 
143 billion dollars in the United States alone (Doshi et al., 2012), with one-fourth of these 
costs borne by the U.S. education system. In school, children with ADHD are more likely to 
experience increased learning problems, school absences, troublesome relationships with 
peers, and a higher rate of ambulatory medical visits. As adults, these risks and associated 
problems result in 33% reduced earning and 15% increase in use of social assistance among 
those with ADHD (Fletcher, 2014). The costly toll that ADHD takes on individual 
adjustment, family life, schools, health care, and social services underscores the importance 
of understanding its etiology, developmental course, and outcomes, with the ultimate goal of 
earlier (accurate) identification, treatment, and the reduction of individual and societal 
burden.

ADHD AS A DISORDER: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES

ADHD is now recognized as a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder with known structural 
and functional brain anomalies. The present conceptualization of ADHD has evolved in 
parallel with the field of psychiatry more generally in the past 35 years, acknowledging the 
shift from psychological and environmental explanations of behavior to biological (or 
biopsychosocial) framework, based on the exponential advances in neuroimaging and 
genetic research (Faraone et al., 2015). The trend toward a biological explanation for ADHD 
was well established even before the term was coined in 1980, especially among 
psychiatrists who hypothesized a neurochemical basis (likely a dopamine deficiency) for the 
condition later described as Minimal Brain Dysfunction and ultimately ADHD.

Precursors to the formal adoption of the diagnosis of ADHD, going back to the nineteenth 
century, included the Hyperactive/Hyperkinetic Syndrome and ultimately the broad category 
of Minimal Brain Dysfunction. It is notable that the first use of a stimulant medication as a 
calming influence on hyperactivity was in children considered to have “brain damage,” 
rather than those with genetically based neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down 
syndrome (Bradley, 1937). The group of individuals defined as “brain damaged” was 
broadly defined by the combination of hyperactivity and motor impairments (but to a more 
minor degree falling short of the diagnosis of cerebral palsy).

The conference that introduced the term Minimal Brain Dysfunction built on the idea of 
“brain damage” as a combination of hyperactivity and minor motor dysfunction, and also 
added a heterogeneous set of learning and perceptual anomalies to the description 
(Clements, 1966). Initially, dyslexia was set aside as a very special category, but later for 
educational classification was subsumed under the category of learning disabilities.

In the years between 1966 and the 1975, implementation of the U.S. federal special 
education law (PL 94–142), some states had classes for individuals with “brain damage,” 
while others had classes for those with “neurological impairments”; however, admission 
requirements for both included symptoms of hyperactivity, minor motor anomalies, and 
perceptual or learning impairments, but with IQ in the normal range. Thus, before 1980, the 
bond between minor motor anomalies, often referred to as soft signs, and the behavioral 
precursor to ADHD was very strong, such that one publication (Denckla & Rudel, 1978) 
established that a quantitative motor examination could discriminate typically developing 
peers from hyperactive boys who were free of any learning disabilities.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: HYPERKINETIC DISORDER, ATTENTION DEFICIT 

DISORDER, AND ADHD

Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals

By 1980, research by psychologists using continuous performance tests, most prominently 
Virginia Douglas (Douglas & Peters, 1979), became so influential that the mental health 
profession as a whole started to recognize the relationship between attention and the 
condition formerly known as the Hyperactive/Hyperkinetic Syndrome (or the broader 
version, Minimal Brain Dysfunction). The result was that attention became, and has 
remained, a central characterizing descriptor of the disorder. Eventually, the Hyperactive 
Reaction of Childhood diagnosis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental 
Disorders Second Edition (DSM-II) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1968) was 
renamed Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with publication of the DSM-III (APA, 1980). 
Subtypes of the disorder were also first introduced in the DSM-III, and included Attention 
Deficit Disorder, with or without Hyperactivity. Subsequent revision (DSM-III-R; APA, 
1987) renamed the condition again to its present label (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder), but did away with subtypes in favor of a separate diagnosis, Undifferentiated 
ADHD, used for the individuals presenting without prominent hyperactivity. Subtypes were 
again introduced in the DSM-IV (APA, 1994), and included Inattentive, Hyperactive/
Impulsive and Combined subtypes.

While there has been consistent support for the latent structure of symptom groups 
(inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity), the validity of the three subtypes as was called into 
question in the research literature, given the temporal instability of the categories, 
inconsistent practices for symptom counts between home versus school informants (Valo & 
Tannock, 2010), and sexual dimorphism in symptom manifestation (Willcutt et al., 2012). 
Also, the Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype was shown to be rare outside the preschool setting, 
and more appropriately considered a developmental precursor to the Combined subtype 
(Barkley, 1997). Concurrently, the DSM-IV age-of-onset criterion (requiring symptoms

producing impairment by age 7 years) was also questioned, following observation of later 
symptom onset in girls (Todd, Huang, & Henderson, 2008), and the recognition of a 
potentially separate adult-onset manifestation (Barkley, Murphy, & Fischer, 2008).

The diagnostic criteria changed in several important ways with the publication of the (APA, 
2013). Prior editions of the DSM classified ADD and ADHD among the Disorders Usually 
Diagnosed in Infancy Childhood, or Adolescence. With publication of the DSM-5, however, 
ADHD was characterized as a Neurodevelopmental Disorder, more appropriately 
recognizing its onset and chronic developmental course (Shaw & Polanczyk, 2017). While 
retaining most of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD that were previously included in the 
DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000), three important changes were introduced: (1) age-of-onset 
criterion was increased from 7 to 12 years; (2) symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/
impulsivity were required to be merely present (as opposed to causing “impairment”); (3) 
there was provision for using a reduced symptom threshold for diagnosis in adults (ages 17 
years and older), requiring five (rather than six) symptoms of inattention and/or hyper-
activity/impulsivity. Highlights of diagnostic changes in the DSM are summarized in Table 
1.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS

The World Health Organization (WHO) has long recognized ADHD in its criteria for the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9, ICD-10; WHO, 1978, 1993), but has, until 
recently, kept the earlier name of Hyperkinetic Disorder. The criteria for the ICD-10-CM 
(WHO, 2017) are more in line with the DSM-5, and are outlined in Table 1. Historically, the 
ICD criteria follow many of the same diagnostic criteria as the earlier versions of the DSM; 
however, the requirement for earlier onset (before age 7 years), and the exclusions of ADHD 
diagnosis when accompanied by other disorders (including mood disorders) has contributed 
to lower diagnostic rates in studies using the ICD criteria (Hinshaw et al., 2011).

CONSENSUS STATEMENTS AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES

The progression and refinement of diagnostic methods for ADHD from the 1960s through 
the 1990s led to advancements in both identification and treatment. Despite this progress, 
the disorder remained controversial, leading to conflicting opinions in the public sector, and 
confusion for clinicians and policy-makers. One of the main controversies was the rapidly 
expanding use of stimulant medication. Also, by the late 1990s, there remained a belief by 
many that the disorder did not exist, and/or could not be reliably diagnosed. These 
controversies led professional researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders to establish the 
first published consensus statements to address the controversies, and to outline 
considerations for care in children and adults. The NIH Consensus Statement on ADHD 
(NIH, 1998), and the International Consensus Statement on ADHD (Barkley, 2002), and the 
European Consensus Statement on Diagnosis and Treatment of Adult ADHD (Kooij et al., 
2010), are summarized in Table 2.

During the same period, the leading professional practice organizations around the world 
also began to issue specific guidelines for the identification and treatment of ADHD in

children and adolescents. A summary of the most recently published guidelines from the 
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) (Pliskza & The AACAP 
Workgroup, 2007), the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines from the 
United Kingdom (2009), based in part on the earlier European Clinical Guidelines for 
Hyperkinetic Disorder (Taylor et al., 2004), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 
2011), and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia 
(2012) is outlined in Table 3. Of these, the NICE guidelines specifically include treatment 
recommendations for ADHD in adults.

The AACAP, NICE, and AAP practice guidelines specifically address treatment issues for 
preschoolers with ADHD, recognizing the validity of the diagnosis and appropriateness of 
treatment in that age range. The AAP and NICE guidelines state that for preschool children 
with ADHD (ages 4–5 years), clinicians should prescribe behavior therapy, rather than 
medication, as the first line of treatment (AAP, 2011); however, the NICE guidelines go one 
step beyond to virtually preclude pharmacotherapy in the preschool years, and to use 
medication only as a second line treatment in school-age children with mild to moderate 
symptoms of ADHD. Of relevance to neuropsychologists, the AACAP 2007 guidelines state 
that psychological assessment is not mandatory for ADHD diagnosis, but is recommended in 
patients with suspected low IQ or poor academic achievement.

INFLUENTIAL THEORIES OF ADHD

ADHD and Executive Functions

The prevailing neuropsychological theories of ADHD in the past 25 years have emphasized 
the behavioral and cognitive disruptions associated with executive functions, broadly 
defined, secondary to presumed anomalies in (pre)frontalstriatal brain circuitry, and 
modulated by expression of catecholamines. The most influential of these was put forth by 
Barkley (1997) in an effort to extend prior explanations of behavioral dyscontrol more 
generally to those specific deficits observed in children with ADHD. Barkley’s theory built 
on the earlier writing of Quay (1988) and Gray (1982) who asserted that behavioral 
impulsiveness arises from the brain’s inhibitory control systems. The application of 
Barkley’s unifying theory was to interpret deficits in ADHD as a failure of self-control 
systems, with behavioral inhibition as the core. The theory specifically linked inhibition to 
four executive functions: working memory, self-regulation of affect-motivation-arousal, 
internalization of speech, and reconstruction (i.e., behavioral analysis and synthesis). With 
inhibition viewed as the primary deficit, these secondary executive function impairments 
ultimately led to deficits in motor control, including inefficient output (performance).

Beyond Executive Functions

Subsequent neuropsychological theories, including those based on growing awareness of 
frontostriatal functions as a result of brain mapping research, recognized that while deficient 
inhibitory control is a critical component of the ADHD phenotype, it is likely insufficient to 
characterize the range of functional behavioral problems observed. Heilman and colleagues 
(Heilman, Boeller, & Nadeau, 1991) emphasized the importance of the striatum in executive 
control, as it acts to gate sensation into two parallel behavioral systems: how (organization

and praxis) and when (response inhibition). Neuropsychological research over the past 25 
years has highlighted the wide range of neuropsychological differences (beyond inhibitory 
and executive control deficits), emphasizing the dynamic (Nigg & Casey, 2005) and 
heterogeneous nature of ADHD (Sonuga-Barke, 2010 Sonuga-Barke 2010 to the ref list.–>). 
At the group level, children with ADHD show inconsistent and often small reductions in 
performance on performance-based tests of executive function, with mean effect sizes in the 
small to moderate range (Sergeant, Willcutt, & Nigg, 2007), and expression moderated by 
other more contextual variables, such as IQ (Mahone et al., 2002). At the individual level, 
only a small proportion of children with ADHD manifest deficient performance across a 
range executive function tasks (Nigg, Willcutt, Doyle, & Sonuga-Barke, 2005). Recognizing 
these limitations, recent theories have addressed a broader range of non-frontostriatal 
constructs, including state regulation, delay aversion, and performance variability.

Cognitive-Energetic Models

Based largely on the information processing models of Joseph Sergeant and colleagues, 
these state regulation models recognized the dynamic interplay between tonic versus phasic 
activation systems in the brain. The cognitive-energetic theory of ADHD (Sergeant, 2000) 
characterized the behaviors observed in ADHD as a product of the dynamic interplay 
between energetic (bottom–up) systems involving arousal, activation and effort, and 
cognitive (top–down) executive control systems that limit the expression of the energetic 
drive states, often in an inverted U manner allowing for other executive functions (e.g., 
working memory) to also moderate output (Sergeant, Guerts, Huijbregts, Sheres, & 
Oosterlaan, 2003). In contrast to Barkley’s (1997) executive function theory of ADHD, the 
cognitive-energetic model allowed for subcortical anomalies affecting arousal and activation 
to be primary in the manifestation of ADHD.

Motivation and Delay Aversion

The concept of delay aversion comes from the motivational model of ADHD, based on the 
influence of reward systems in the brain, and characterized behaviorally by the preference 
for “smaller sooner” (SS) over “larger later” (LL) rewards (Sonuga-Barke, Sergeant, Nigg, 
& Willcutt, 2008). Like the cognitive-energetic models, delay aversion theories incorporate 
executive control and dorsal-frontostriatal circuitry, represented behaviorally by inhibitory 
control problems. The dual pathway model, however, also recognizes the influence of a 
second (reward) circuit, represented by ventral frontostriatal dysfunction and reflected 
behaviorally in delay aversion (Sonuga-Barke, 2003), and anomalous sensitivity to reward 
(Luman, Van Meel, Oosterlaan, Sergeant, & Guerts, 2009).

More recently, the model has been expanded to consider a third potential pathway 
influencing behavioral output (i.e., a triple-pathway model), involving temporal processing 
deficits, manifested in difficulties with timing, time discrimination, reproduction, and motor 
synchronization (Sonuga-Barke, Paraskevi, & Thompson, 2010). The addition of these 
timing deficits to the model recognizes the influence of cerebellar functioning in the 
manifestation of cognitive and behavioral function in ADHD.

Response Variability

Page 7

Intra-individual variability in response time (for both externally and self-paced tasks) is 
observed in groups of individuals with ADHD, both at the phenotypic and genetic levels, 
with explanations ranging from temporal processing deficits to arousal regulation and 
anomalies in the default-mode network (Kuntsi & Klein, 2012). Prior observation of slowed 
processing speed in ADHD, characterized by longer mean response times, is now recognized 
to be driven by significant skewing of the response-time distribution, and exacerbated by the 
presence of more frequent, very slow (“off task”) responses, measurable via the variable tau 
at the extreme tail of the distribution via ex-Gaussian analytic methods (Ghemlin et al., 
2014).

Parallel to these findings, state regulation theories prompted investigations built on the 
notion that motor activation is facilitated by stimulus unpredictability. In a series of recent 
studies in children with ADHD, increased intra-individual variability (Ryan, Martin, 
Denckla, Mostofsky, & Mahone, 2010) and lapses from performance (manifest by increased 
tau), have been shown to be normalized by a introducing a moderate degree of 
unpredictability in the stimulus presentation, operationalized by “jittering” the inter-stimulus 
interval (Lee et al., 2015).

Sluggish Cognitive Tempo

During the field trials for the DSM-IV, investigators identified a set of symptoms, later 
termed sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT), that were observed in children with ADHD, but 
were also in many ways distinct, including lethargy, daydreaming, confusion, and 
drowsiness. The characterization of SCT was ultimately included in the examples provided 
for the ADHD, Not Otherwise Specified diagnosis in DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). Initially, 
proposed revisions for DSM-5 included a separate Restrictive Inattentive ADHD 
presentation that overlapped with the SCT construct. Upon publication of DSM-5, however, 
neither the Restrictive Inattentive presentation, nor the diagnosis of SCT, was included. Most 
subsequent investigations of the SCT construct have identified three core symptoms, 
lethargy, underactivity, and slowness, that appear distinct from the inattention associated 
with ADHD and are hypothesized to be a function of earlier selective attention processes 
(Jacobson et al., 2012).

LANDMARK TREATMENT STUDIES

Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA)

This multi-site, study represented the largest controlled trial to of treatment for ADHD to 
date (Arnold et al., 1997), and enrolled 579 children with ADHD, ages 7–9, who were 
randomized to one of four treatment strategies: medication alone, psychosocial treatment 
alone, combined (medication + psychosocial treatment), and community control. 
Participants were treated actively for 14 months, with a follow-up 10 months after the 
conclusion of active treatment. At 14 months, all four groups showed sizeable reductions in 
symptoms, with those in medication-alone and combined strategies showing greatest 
improvement.

Behavioral therapy and community control strategy groups showed less improvement than 
the medication-alone and combined, but did not differ from one another (MTA Cooperative 
Group, 1999a). Medication management and behavioral therapies for this trial represented 
gold standard care, including careful titration of short-acting methylphenidate, dosed three 
times a day (for the mediation groups), and intensive behavioral therapy based on the 
summer program developed by Pelham and colleagues. In children with comorbid 
conditions, the medication groups showed less superiority to behavioral treatments (MTA 
Cooperative Group, 1999b), although admittedly, more intensive behavioral treatments (not 
offered in the MTA studies) may have been required to maintain greater effects.

At 24-month follow-up, the medication and combined groups continued to show persistence 
of improvement, but with notably diminished effects over time (MTA Cooperative Group, 
2004). The initially superior results of the well-monitored medication condition were 
attenuated in long-term naturalistic follow-up, which showed not only the superiority of 
combination treatment, but also emergence of growth-related side effects in those treated 
with long-term medication, and the contribution of comorbidities (especially anxiety) and 
family-related processes (notably SES) that contributed significantly to functional outcome 
(Hinshaw, Arnold, & the MTA Cooperative Group, 2015).

Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS)

The PATS was a large multi-site, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial to 
study the effects of methylphenidate in carefully-diagnosed preschoolers with ADHD, ages 
3 to 5.5 years (Abikoff et al., 2007). Like the MTA study, methylphenidate immediate 
release was titrated and administered three times per day. The medication led to 
improvement in symptoms with effect sizes smaller than those observed in the MTA trials 
(Greenhill et al., 2006). Most receiving medication maintained improvement over 10 
months; however, side effects were more common (including slowed growth rate) than 
observed in older children. A 6-year naturalistic follow-up of those enrolled in the PATS 
study showed a remarkable stability of the symptoms (and disorder) over time, with 
continued high severity, despite ongoing medication treatment (Riddle et al., 2013).

Non-pharmacological Interventions

Long-term findings from the MTA and PATS studies highlight limitations of medication, and 
the importance of non-pharmacological treatments in overall care of individuals with 
ADHD. The types of non-pharmacological interventions that have been studied vary widely, 
and include, among others, behavioral treatments, dietary interventions, cognitive training, 
and neurofeedback, both in isolation and in combination with other treatments. A recent 
meta-analysis of these treatments identified challenges in study design around blinding of 
observers; however, among those well-blinded studies, interventions involving free fatty acid 
supplementation and exclusion of artificial food colors (among those with food sensitivities) 
showed small effects of unclear significance, with other treatments, including 
neurofeedback, cognitive training, and behavioral therapies produced inconsistent results 
with regard to core ADHD symptoms that require additional study using blinded 
assessments before conclusions can be drawn (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013). Overall, these 
findings suggest that children need careful evaluations to identify comorbidities and that the

BIOMARKERS OF ADHD AND THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN BRAIN 

MAPPING RESEARCH

Genes, Environment, and ADHD

The recognition that ADHD runs in families prompted extensive research into the genetic 
etiology of the disorder. Based on observations from twin studies, the heritability of ADHD 
is as high as 70–80%, and first-degree relatives of probands with ADHD have a 5- to 10-fold 
increased risk in developing the disorder themselves (Faraone et al., 2015). Studies of 
candidate genes emphasized those associated with dopamine or other neurotransmitters (e.g., 
DAT1, DRD4, SNAP25; Wu, Yang, & Wang, 2014), although effect sizes have been small, 
and results have often not been replicated. The COMT gene has also been explored, given its 
role in degradation of prefrontal dopamine (Sun, Yuan, Shen, Ziong, & Wu, 2014). The 
heterogeneity of the phenotypic presentation, and variable patterns of lifetime symptom 
development, suggest that ADHD is associated with multiple genes of small effect, and 
gene–environment interactions, such that identification of a single genetic etiology is 
unlikely.

Neuroimaging and ADHD

A remarkable accumulation of evidence converging on the neurobiological nature of ADHD 
began with the availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anatomic (aMRI) 
measurements, not clinical readings, focused on the basal ganglia, showing volume 
reductions (Aylward et al., 1996) and shape deformations (Qiu et al., 2009) in children with 
ADHD, with evidence that stimulant medication treatment may normalize morphological 
features of the basal ganglia (Sobel et al., 2010). Somewhat later, appreciation of the other 
regions participating in control circuits led to the finding of volume reductions in the 
cerebellum (Wyciszkiewicz, Pawlak, & Krawiec, 2017) and functionally defined frontal lobe 
sub-regions (Mahone, Ranta, et al., 2011).

Shaw and colleagues used longitudinal analyses of aMRI data to examine trajectories of 
development in children with ADHD (Shaw et al., 2007). Their landmark study 
demonstrated that in most regions of the cortex, children with ADHD showed a 
developmental lag, up to 3 years, in attaining peak cortical thickness, leading to the 
conclusion that ADHD may be best conceptualized as a delay in brain maturation, rather 
than as a discrete categorical entity. More recent longitudinal aMRI studies demonstrated 
that this rate of “thinning” is actually proportional to the level of symptoms, such that those 
with the most rapid thinning have the fewest ADHD symptoms, while those with the slowest 
(most delayed) cortical thinning have the most severe ADHD symptoms (Shaw et al., 2011), 
lending support to the dimensional (spectrum) view of ADHD.

In the past 15 years, multimodal neuroimaging methods (beyond aMRI) have added to the 
growing understanding of the neurobiology of ADHD. Using task-activated functional MRI 
(fMRI), a recent review of 55 studies of children with ADHD in terms of their task-

responsive activations recorded a pattern of decreases in the executive/frontoparietal and, 
visual-attentional/ventral attentional networks, contrasted with increases in the default mode 
and somatomotor networks (Cortese et al., 2012). Resting state (non–task-activated/baseline) 
fMRI measurements of connectivity in children and adults with ADHD show atypicality of 
the default mode network, sometimes described as reduced coherence or decreased integrity 
thereof (Fair et al., 2010).

The burgeoning group of publications assessing functional connectivity in children with 
ADHD has added data showing interplay of the default mode, cognitive control, reward, 
attention, and amygdala-seeded networks (Castellanos & Aoki, 2016). At the same time, 
using of diffusion tensor/weighted imaging, a recent review revealed anomalies in 
frontostriatal white matter pathways, albeit not always in the same direction, in children and 
adolescents with ADHD (Tamm, Barnea-Goraly, & Reiss, 2012).

ADHD PHENOTYPES AND SPECIAL SUB-POPULATIONS

ADHD and Learning Disabilities

The history of learning disabilities (LD), first published as such in 1962, and the pre-1980 
conceptualization of ADHD is one of over-inclusiveness under the Minimal Brain 
Dysfunction label (Clements, 1966). Two of the most common neurodevelopmental 
disorders, ADHD and dyslexia, co-occur more often than would be expected by chance 
(Cuoto et al., 2009), suggesting shared genetic risks. When starting with a sample of young 
children with ADHD, the observed emergence of LD is striking, such that one third struggle 
to learn basic reading. At later ages, when demands for “learning to read” give way the need 
for “reading to learn,” difficulties with both written expression and mathematics (associated 
with increased demands for executive control) are observed, raising the co-occurrence of 
between LD (all types) and ADHD to approximately two-thirds (Denckla, 2005; Hooper & 
Williams, 2005).

ADHD and Motor Control

Whether regarded as an associated or core feature of ADHD, anomalies of motor 
development have a long history of parallel description alongside attentional and executive 
attainments, suggesting a shared neural circuitry (Diamond, 2000). Overflow movements 
involve unconsciously produced concomitant movements of limbs or parts thereof (e.g., 
fingers) that are not the primarily requested movements, including feet-to-hands (with heel 
or toe walking) and mirroring of patterned hand or finger movements during repetitive and 
sequenced movements. Overflow movements are especially sensitive developmental 
biomarkers, diminishing to a point of disappearance during the first decade of life in 
typically developing children the functional outcome of maturation in the brain’s collateral 
inhibition (Gidley Larson et al., 2007).

Overflow movements persist, however, in children with neurological impairments, including 
ADHD (Cole et al., 2008). Mirror movements, an important subtype of overflow, have been 
long recognized as the most diagnostically discriminating motor sign for hyperactive and 
typically developing children (Denckla & Rudel, 1978), the physiology for which has been

revealed recently by transcranial magnetic stimulation (Gilbert, Isaacs, Augusta, MacNeil, & 
Mostofsky, 2011).

Other aspects of anomalous motor development, including meeting balance and gait 
milestones and speed, rhythm, and patterning of foot and hand/finger movements, have also 
been found to be characteristic of children with ADHD, especially before adolescence, and 
more dramatically in young girls with ADHD (Cole et al., 2008). The motor endophenotype 
designation is meaningful in ADHD, as motor control matures earlier than cognitive or 
social-emotional control. As such, motor development may serve as a type of “canary in the 
coal mine” in diagnosis or prediction of ADHD. For example, the ability to hop on one foot 
at age 4 years was reported long ago to be the best predictor of hyperactivity at age 7 years 
(Nichols & Chen, 1981).

Sexual Dimorphism and Girls with ADHD

Available neuroimaging research examining brain development highlights a striking pattern 
in which girls reach maturation (i.e., peak cortical thickness) 2–5 years earlier than boys in 
most functional regions (Lenroot et al., 2007). At birth, it has been estimated that girls are 3 
weeks ahead of boys in physical maturation, and by the time they enter school, girls are 
approximately 1 year ahead (Eme, 1992). These patterns of development in girls set the 
stage for sexually dimorphic manifestation of motor and executive dysfunction in children 
with ADHD, including risk genes for ADHD with different effects in males and females 
(Davies, 2014). While initial studies suggested that girls with ADHD had better adolescent 
and adult outcomes than boys with ADHD, more recent findings, most notably from the 
large-scale longitudinal studies, highlight considerable functional impairment in girls/
women with ADHD, including persistent executive dysfunction (Miller, Loya, & Hinshaw, 
2013), mood and externalizing disorders (Tung et al., 2016), and severe behavioral problems 
(i.e., suicide attempts, self-injury) into adulthood (Hinshaw et al., 2012).

Anatomic MRI studies of ADHD in girls also highlight patterns that are differently (rather 
than less) deviant in girls with ADHD, consistent with the observed later onset and greater 
social (vs. academic) impairment. Specifically, the medial and orbitofrontal regions 
(sometimes called the limbic frontal regions) are smaller to a greater degree than the 
dorsolateral and premotor regions, in contrast to the male ADHD frontal profile (Dirlikov et 
al., 2014). The breakdown of sub-domains of executive functions is also differently 
distributed among girls versus boys with ADHD (O’Brien, Dowell, Mostofsky, Denckla, & 
Mahone, 2010).

ADHD in Preschoolers

ADHD has become the most commonly diagnosed form of psychopathology in the 
preschool years, with CDC prevalence estimates at 2.7% of children ages 4–5 years. The 
increase in identification and treatment of preschool ADHD occurs in the context of parallel 
increases in enrollment in preprimary academic programs in the preschool years (Bosco & 
Bona, 2016), which has led some researchers to caution of an epidemic of preschoolers 
being wrongfully diagnosed (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014). Nevertheless, neuroanatomical 
changes in preschoolers with ADHD as young as 4 years are now identified, with rate of

anatomic “delay” associated with symptom severity (Mahone, Crocetti, et al., 2011). The 
picture is concerning, because even when treated in preschool years, children with ADHD 
continue to have symptoms and significant functional impairment in elementary school 
(Riddle et al., 2013).

ADHD in Adults

The primary symptoms of ADHD most often begin in early childhood, and persist (in some 
form) into adulthood for as many of 85% of individuals with the disorder (van Lieshout et 
al., 2016). In the past 20 years, adult onset ADHD has also been recognized, and (Faraone et 
al., 2015), and is now acknowledged as valid condition with genetic associations that are 
potentially unique from the child-onset variation (Agnew-Blais et al., 2016). The DSM-5 
criteria for ADHD also allow for an adjusted diagnostic threshold in individuals ages 17 
years and older, such that only five of nine symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity and/or 
inattention are required (APA, 2013). Adult diagnosis is acknowledged to be more difficult 
than in the early years due to multiple comorbidities accruing by adult life and variable 
access to childhood records or histories.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In the past 35 years, ADHD has emerged as one of the most diagnosed, treated, and 
researched neurologically based behavioral conditions. Nevertheless, outcomes remain poor. 
The preponderance of research involving behavioral and phenotypic expression of ADHD 
has suffered from the population bias, such that most samples are biased toward a population 
of boys aged 6–12 years. Moreover, diagnostic methods and societal gender role beliefs have 
contributed to a male bias in ADHD diagnosis, where boys are at risk for over-diagnosis, 
and girls are at risk for under-diagnosis (Bruchmuller, Margraf, & Schneider, 2012). 
Neuropsychologists working with individuals with ADHD (whether or not it is the primary 
reason for referral) are encouraged to recognize that the developmental course is often 
lifelong, necessitating a “family practice” approach to consultation and intervention, in 
which caregivers provide assistance in different contexts and in different formats throughout 
the life of the individual with the condition.

At the time of this writing, the psychiatric conceptualization of ADHD remains categorical, 
while neuropsychological theories of ADHD emphasize functions as dynamic, dimensional 
constructs. In the next 35 years, research using dimensional frameworks such as Research 
Domain Criteria (RDoC; Insel et al., 2010), which also call for integration of multiple units 
of analysis (physiology, behavior), may be better suited to study the individual with ADHD, 
without the constraints of categorical diagnoses, especially for those individuals whose 
behaviors and cognitive skill patterns fall sub-threshold for diagnosis.

In conclusion, several prominent clinical and research questions remain, and will likely be 
the focus of the next generation of investigation into ADHD. Our (admittedly incomplete) 
list of suggested future investigations would include: (i) Links between multimodal brain 
mapping and phenotypic dimensions associated with ADHD, with emphasis on accessing 
international large datasets of bio-markers (e.g., enigma.io). (ii) Clarification of the 
neurobiological and phenotypic presentation of adult onset ADHD as a disorder potentially

Published consensus statements on ADHD

Statement

Year

Features and unique criteria

Table 2

NIH Consensus 
Development 
Statement

November 1998 Conference hosted by the National Institutes of Health, bringing together international experts on 

ADHD, as well as health care representatives from the public.

The consensus statement (NIH, 1998) concluded the following:

International 
Consensus Statement 
on ADHD

•

•

•

ADHD is valid disorder of childhood and a major public health problem.

Children with ADHD usually have pronounced difficulties and impairments 
resulting from the disorder across multiple settings, and can experience long-term 
adverse effects on academic performance, vocational success, and social-emotional 
development.

Evidence supporting the validity of ADHD includes the long-term developmental 
course over time, cross-national studies revealing similar risk factors, familial 
aggregation (recognized as either genetic or environmental), and, heritability.

2002

Prompted by continued inaccurate portrayal of ADHD in the media, and the stories of ADHD as a 
myth or as an otherwise benign condition.

Concern from international healthcare and research community that thousands would not seek 
treatment for the condition.

Supported by U.S. Surgeon General, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric 
Association, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Psychological 
Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics.

The statement concluded, “as a matter of science, the notion that ADHD does not exist is simply 
wrong” (p. 89), and further charged the media to depict ADHD as realistically and accurately as it 
is depicted in the scientific community, as a valid disorder having substantial adverse impact on 
those who have the condition suffer from it through no fault of their own or their parents and 
teachers—a statement directly contradicting those in the popular media who had continued to 
portray ADHD as the result of bad parenting or teaching (Barkley, 2002).

European Consensus 
Statement on treatment 
of adult ADHD

2010

Adults with ADHD manifest anomalies in brain functioning, based on cognitive, 
electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, and the effectiveness of pharmacological 
treatments with dopamine agonists support the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD.

The high heritability and associated environmental risk factors suggest a primary role for genetic 
influences that are moderated by environmental factors in the majority of cases.

Adult ADHD can be reliably diagnosed with careful examination, and a cutoff of 4/9 DSM 
criteria for inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are recommended for diagnosis of Adult 
ADHD.
