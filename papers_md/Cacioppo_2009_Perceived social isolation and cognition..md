Perceived Social Isolation and Cognition

John T. Cacioppo and Louise C. Hawkley
University of Chicago

Abstract

Social species, from Drosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens, fare poorly when isolated. Homo
sapiens, an irrepressibly meaning-making species, are, in normal circumstances, dramatically
affected by perceived social isolation. Research indicates that perceived social isolation (i.e.,
loneliness) is a risk factor for, and may contribute to, poorer overall cognitive performance, faster
cognitive decline, poorer executive functioning, more negativity and depressive cognition,
heightened sensitivity to social threats, a confirmatory bias in social cognition that is self-protective
and paradoxically self-defeating, heightened anthropomorphism, and contagion that threatens social
cohesion. These differences in attention and cognition impact emotions, decisions, behaviors, and
interpersonal interactions that may contribute to the association between loneliness and cognitive
decline and between loneliness and morbidity more generally.

Introduction

The health, life, and genetic legacy of members of social species are threatened when they
finds themselves on the social perimeter. Social isolation decreases lifespan in the fruit fly1;
promotes obesity and Type 2 diabetes in mice2; exacerbates infarct size and edema and
decreases post-stroke survival rate following experimentally induced stroke in mice3; promotes
activation of the sympatho-adrenomedullary response to an acute immobilization or cold
stressor in rats4; delays the effects of exercise on adult neurogenesis in rats5; decreases open
field activity, increases basal cortisol concentrations, and decreases lymphocyte proliferation
to mitogens in pigs6; increases the 24 hr urinary catecholamines levels and evidence of
oxidative stress in the aortic arch of rabbits7; and decreases the expression of genes regulating
glucocorticoid response in the frontal cortex of piglets.8 Humans, born to the longest period
of abject dependency of any species and dependent on conspecifics across the lifespan to
survive and prosper, do not fare well, either, whether they live solitary lives or they simply
perceive they live in relative isolation (see Box 1).

Perceived social isolation, known more colloquially as loneliness, was characterized in early
scientific investigations as “a chronic distress without redeeming features” (9, p. 15). Recent
research suggests that the social pain of loneliness evolved as a signal that one's connections
to others are weakening and to motivate the repair and maintenance of the connections to others
that are needed for our health and well being and for the survival of our genes (see Box 2;10).

Experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies are beginning to elucidate the various
ways in which loneliness is related to, and in some cases affects, human information processing.

Cognitive Capacities

Human social processes were once thought to have been incidental to learning and cognition,
whereas the social complexities and demands of primate species are now thought to have
contributed to the evolution of the neocortex and various aspects of human cognition.
Consistent with this reasoning, human toddlers and chimpanzees have similar cognitive skills
for engaging the physical world but toddlers have more sophisticated cognitive skills than
chimpanzees for engaging the social world11; cross-species comparisons have revealed that
the evolution of large and metabolically expensive brains is more closely associated with social
than ecological complexity12; and a composite index of sociality in troops of baboons has been
found to be highly correlated with infant survival.13

Evidence that social isolation might be related to fundamental aspects of cognition comes from
animal research showing that isolation impairs learning that requires the inhibition of
previously learned responses (e.g., reversal learning, extinction;14) and from human research
showing that loneliness is a risk factor for cognitive decline15-17 and AD17. Gow and
colleagues17 investigated the correlates of changes in mental ability of 488 individuals from
the Lothian Birth Cohort Study who were tested at age 11 and 79. Among the variables tested
were loneliness, social support, and social network (e.g., presence of significant others, number
of significant others). After controlling for age-11 IQ, gender, years of education, and social
class, only loneliness was associated significantly with changes in IQ. Although loneliness is
temporally stable and heritable18, 19, the study by Gow and colleagues does not address the
possibility that loneliness is a consequence rather than a predictor of cognitive decline. Two
recent longitudinal studies do speak to this question.

Tilvis and colleagues15 measured cognition by the mini-mental state examination and the
Clinical Dementia Rating at baseline and at one, five and ten year assessments of a population-
based sample of 75-85 year old individuals. Results at the 10-year follow-up assessment
revealed APOE4, elevated serum (ionized) calcium, and loneliness independently predicted
cognitive decline. In a larger prospective study, Wilson et al.16 assessed 823 older adults free
of dementia at enrollment. Participants completed an extensive battery of cognitive measures
to assess global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual
speed, and visuospatial ability. The lonelier were the participants, the poorer the cognitive
performance within each of these domains at baseline, and loneliness was associated with
greater cognitive declines in every domain except working memory and episodic performance.
Furthermore, 76 individuals developed dementia during the 65 month study period. Cox
proportional hazards models that controlled for age, sex, and education indicated that loneliness
significantly increased the risk of clinical AD, and this association was unchanged when
objective social isolation and other demographic and health-related factors served as
covariates. Depression may also contribute to cognitive declines, so Wilson et al.16 also
examined the possible role of depressive symptoms. The loneliness at baseline predicted
cognitive decline and the onset of AD even when depressive symptoms served as a covariate.
For instance, the association between loneliness and AD risk was reduced by about 16% when
controlling for depressive symptoms and remained significant. Depressive symptomatology,
on the other hand, was marginally related to the risk of AD, and this association was reduced
by more than half when controlling for loneliness (see, also, Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, &
Lindenberger,20).

Brain autopsies were available for 67% of the participants who died during the study. Of these,
30% had a clinical diagnosis of AD. Loneliness and the neuropathological measures derived

from the brain autopsy were each inversely related to global cognition at the last assessment
prior to death, but loneliness was unrelated to the neuropathological measures. Although the
mechanism underlying the association between loneliness and cognitive decline has not yet
been identified, social isolation was recently shown to decrease central anti-inflammatory
responses and survival rate, and increase the infarct size and edema development, following
the induction of stroke in mice.3 The deficits in reversal learning associated with isolation in
animals have also been associated with diminished prefrontal-cortico-striatal functioning21, a
neural mechanism involved in the inhibition of previously learned responses. Socially isolated
animals also show less dendritic arborization in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex22 and
decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor23. To what extent loneliness produces similar
neurophysiological changes and how such differences contribute to cognitive decline in
humans are open questions. Consistent with the animal research, however, human studies
indicate that loneliness impairs executive functioning, specifically the inhibition of prepotent
responses. We turn to that evidence next.

Executive Functioning

Executive functioning includes the capacity to control one's attention, cognition, emotion, and/
or behavior to better meet social standards or personal goals, that is, to self-regulate. Early
evidence from young adults who performed a dichotic listening task suggested that attentional
regulation was poorer in lonely than nonlonely individuals.24 Participants were asked to
identify the consonant-vowel pair presented in the left or right ear. Typically, performance
shows a right-ear advantage and performance is better for the ear to which participants have
been instructed to attend. Lonely and nonlonely individuals showed an equivalent right ear
advantage under the no-instruction condition and an equivalent attentional shift to the right ear
when so instructed, but lonely participants showed a weaker left-ear advantage (the non-
prepotent response) when instructed to attend to this ear.

Poorer self regulation when feeling isolated is not limited to attentional control. In cross-
sectional and longitudinal research, lonely individuals have been found to have lower odds of
engaging in regular exercise than nonlonely individuals, and the poorer emotional regulation
of individuals when they felt lonely mediated the effect.25 Experimental manipulations that
lead people to believe they face a future of social isolation also decrease self-regulation. In an
illustrative study, Baumeister and colleagues26 had the participants complete two
questionnaires: an introversion/extraversion test, and a personality inventory. Participants then
were randomly assigned to receive no feedback (Control Group) or to receive feedback to
induce feelings of a future of social isolation (Future Alone), social connection (Future
Belonging), or general misfortune (Misfortune Control Group). Results revealed that the Future
Alone group performed significantly worse than the other groups on the General Mental Ability
Test of the Graduate Record Exam. Bad news itself was not enough to cause the disruption,
only bad news about social connection.

In subsequent variations on this experimental paradigm, randomly assigned participants to the
Future Alone Group, relative to the other groups, performed similarly on a rote memorization
task but attempted the fewest problems and made the most mistakes on a logical reasoning
task27, consumed more delicious but unhealthy foods27, and were more aggressive toward
others28. A perceived future of social isolation, then, did not impair routine mental ability, only
the higher order cognitive and self-regulatory processes that are characteristic of executive
functioning. A brain scan conducted while participants performed moderately difficult math
problems revealed that the brains of the future socially isolated participants were less active in
the areas involved in the “executive control” of attention.29

Colorations of Cognition

Experimental manipulations of loneliness not only impair executive functioning, they produce
higher negative mood, anxiety, anger, and depressive symptomatology.30 An experience
sampling study, in which participants were beeped randomly nine times per day for seven days,
confirmed that the social interactions of lonely, in contrast to nonlonely, individuals were more
negative and less satisfying, and such interactions contributed subsequently to more negative
moods and interactions.31 Evidence from behavioral and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies further suggests that loneliness increases attention to negative social
stimuli (e.g., social threats). Using a modified emotional Stroop task, lonely participants,
relative to nonlonely participants, showed greater Stroop interference specifically for negative
social relative to negative non-social words.32 No differences between lonely and nonlonely
participants were found in Stroop interference for positive social relative to positive non-social
words. Stroop interference is used to gauge the implicit processing of stimuli, so these results
suggest that loneliness is associated with a heightened accessibility of negative social
information. Similarly, Yamada and Decety33 investigated the effects of subliminal priming
on the detection of painful facial expressions. Using signal detection analyses, they found that
lonely individuals were more sensitive (d′) to the presence of pain in dislikable faces than were
nonlonely individuals.

The patterns of regional brain activation found when lonely and nonlonely individuals think
about people differ, as well.34 A region associated with reward and appetitive behavior (i.e.,
ventral striatum) was more strongly activated in nonlonely than lonely individuals when
exposed to pleasant social pictures in contrast to pleasant nonsocial pictures (see Figure 2). On
the other hand, activation of the visual cortex to the presentation of unpleasant social, in contrast
to nonsocial, pictures was directly related to the loneliness of the participant, indicative of
greater visual attention to the negative social stimuli., These results are consistent with the
behavioral data indicating that loneliness is related to the attention elicited by negative social
stimuli.

A possible casualty of loneliness and the priming of social threats is that lonely individuals
may be more likely to focus on themselves, their needs, and their preservation in negative
circumstances. To examine this possibility, activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) --
a region that has been found previously to be activated in theory of mind tasks and in tasks in
which individuals take the perspective of another, was also examined.34 Consistent with this
reasoning, TPJ activation was observed when participants viewed unpleasant pictures of people
versus objects, and loneliness was inversely related to amount of activation observed.

The hypersensitivity to negative social information and the diminished pleasure derived from
positive social stimuli might be expected to shape social expectations and motivations and
contribute to a downward spiraling of negative affect and depressive symptomatology. Indeed,
loneliness is related to stronger expectations of and motivations to avoid bad social outcomes
and weaker expectations of and motivations to approach good social outcomes.35 Furthermore,
loneliness and depressive symptoms are distinct states both by measures of statistical30 and
functional independence,36-38 and longitudinal studies have shown that loneliness predicts
increases in depressive symptomatology above and beyond what can be explained by basal
levels of depressive symptomatology.39-41 Results are mixed in terms of whether depressive
symptoms have a reciprocal influence on loneliness.

Social Cognition

The brains of lonely, in contrast to nonlonely, individuals are on high alert for social threats,
so lonely individuals tend to view their social world as threatening and punitive (see Box 3).
Experimental manipulations of loneliness not only cause people to feel more anxious, fear

negative evaluation, and act more coldly toward others30, it causes them to feel colder.42 Lonely
individuals also tend to form more negative social impressions of others, and their expectations,
attributional reasoning, and actions toward others tend to be less charitable than shown by
nonlonely individuals.43 When an individual's negative social expectations elicit behaviors
from others that validate these expectations, the expectations are buttressed and increase the
likelihood of the individual behaving in ways that pushes away the very people to whom he or
she most wants to be close to better fulfill their social needs.44, 45 Consequently, lonely
individuals may view themselves to be passive victims in their social world, but they are active
contributors through their self-protective and paradoxically self-defeating interactions with
others.43

Although loneliness may interfere with a person's attempts to form stable and trusting social
connections with other people, loneliness has been found to promote attempts to form social
connections though memorial or inferential means, such as through nostalgic reminiscences,
46 imputed parasocial relationships (relationships with imaginary television characters;47), and
digital connections.48 In addition, loneliness promotes social connection through the
anthropomorphism of pets,49 technological gadgets,50 celestial bodies,51 and supernatural
entities.51 Together, this work suggests that when people feel socially isolated, they become
more likely to use their cognitive capacities to try to fill the social void.

Loneliness is typically investigated as an individual factor, but because perceived and objective
isolation can be differentiated, loneliness can also vary within and across groups. Network
linkage data from the population-based Framingham Heart Study were used to trace the
topography of loneliness in social networks, and the path through which loneliness spreads
through these networks.52 Results indicated that loneliness occurs in clusters within social
networks, is disproportionately represented at the periphery of social networks, extends up to
three degrees of separation, and is stronger for women than men.

Several features of the Framingham study pointed to loneliness spreading through a contagious
process and moving lonely individuals closer to the edge of social networks over time.
Contagion is defined as the transmission of a state by direct or indirect contact, and virulence
is determined, in part, by exposure (i.e., dose). Longitudinal analyses indicated that loneliness
in one individual at Time 1 was followed by others in the social network becoming lonelier by
Time 2. Second, the closer the friend or contact was physically to this individual at Time 1,
the lonelier the friend or contact became by Time 2. Third, loneliness was transmitted from
the individual at Time 1 through friends and contacts to others beyond the individual's circle
of contacts such that these other individuals became lonelier by Time 2. Fourth, the
transmission of loneliness was stronger when the friendship between the individual who was
lonely at Time 1 and others in the social network was reciprocal than not. Importantly, these
results were unchanged when controlling for depressive symptomatology, indicating that the
contagion of loneliness was not secondary to depression.52

If loneliness is contagious, driving away those who are lonely functions to keep the contagion
in check, leading people who feel socially isolated to become objectively more isolated.
Loneliness not only spreads from person to person within a social network, but it reduces the
ties of these individuals to others within the network. The collective rejection of isolates
observed in humans and other primates may therefore serve to protect the structural integrity
of the social entities necessary for humans to survive and prosper.

Data from the Framingham study do not permit detailed investigation of the means by which
loneliness was transmitted, but this contagion may occur through three different mechanisms:
automatic emotional contagion,53 coextensive self-other overlap and the attendant

susceptibility of shared states,54 and quality of social interactions.31 For instance, in an
experience sampling study of everyday behavior, loneliness was associated with more negative
affect and more negative social interactions, the quality of social interactions predicted
subsequent affective states and vice versa, and more negative social interactions had longer
lasting effects on affect than positive social interactions.31 These data are consistent with the
notion that the contagion of loneliness can occur through the more negative social cognition
and interpersonal interactions it engenders.

Conclusion

Cognition has been regarded as the quintessential individual activity. Mental representations
and processes were rendered testable in the dawn of the cognitive sciences by virtue of reverse
engineering: mathematical and computer models were created that specified stimulus inputs,
information processing operations that acted on and transformed these inputs to produce and
change representational structures, and information processing operations that led to
observable responses. Computers today are no longer solitary devices, but rather they operate
as a connected collective resulting in power, capacities, representations, and processes that
were unforeseen. Social species create emergent organizations beyond the individual–
structures ranging from dyads and families to institutions and cultures. These emergent
structures evolved hand in hand with neural, hormonal, and genetic mechanisms to support
them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and
care for offspring sufficiently long that they too reproduced. These emergent levels of
organization have long been apparent, but identifying their biological and cognitive bases and
consequences is one of the major problems for the cognitive sciences to address this century.

Box 1

Physiological and Health Effects
Although objective social isolation can affect loneliness,55, 56 perceived social isolation
(loneliness) is more closely related to the quality than quantity of social interactions.55 This
is in part because loneliness is influenced by factors unrelated to objective isolation,
including genetics,57 childhood environment,18 cultural norms58, social needs59, physical
disabilities55, and discrepancies between actual and desired relationships.60 Accordingly,
perceived social isolation predicts various outcomes above and beyond what is predicted
by objective isolation. For instance, loneliness predicts elevated blood pressure61, morning
rise in cortisol36, physical activity62, perceptions of the neighborhood environment63, and
changes in life satisfaction across a lifetime17 beyond what could be predicted by social
support or objective social isolation. In studies of cognitive functioning, Wilson et al. 16
found no evidence for an influence of social network size or frequency of social activity on
cognitive decline or on risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), whereas loneliness persisted in
predicting each of these outcomes even when social network size and frequency of social
activity were statistically held constant. Similarly, loneliness has been found to predict
lifetime change in IQ17 and changes in depressive symptoms39 beyond what could be
predicted by objective isolation. Experimental manipulation of loneliness30 and imagined
future isolation64 result in cognitive changes even though objective isolation is not altered
in these experimental studies. Perceived (but not objective) social isolation has even been
associated with gene expression—specifically, the under-expression of genes bearing anti-
inflammatory glucocorticoid response elements and over-expression of genes bearing
response elements for pro-inflammatory NK-κB/Rel transcription factors [37; See Figure
1]. This finding is paralleled by decreased lymphocyte sensitivity to physiological
regulation by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis in lonely
individuals65, which together with evidence of increased activity of the HPA axis24, 66,
67, suggests the development of glucocorticoid resistance in chronically lonely individuals.

We, therefore, focus the current review on the association between perceived social isolation
and cognition.

A Biological Signal to Renew the Connections Needed to Survive and Prosper

The species Homo sapiens is fundamentally social, and in ontogeny and phylogeny humans
need others to survive and prosper. Physical pain is an aversive signal that evolved to
motivate one to take action to minimize damage to one's body. Loneliness, a social pain, is
an aversive signal that evolved to motivate one to take action that minimizes threats or
damage to one's social body. Research on social rejection, for instance, suggests that social
pain co-opted the physical pain to extend its protective function to include those with whom
we form connections. In Eisenberger, Lieberman, and Williams68, participants were
excluded from or included in a social situation (i.e., a ball tossing game). Results revealed
neural activation localized in a dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that
is implicated in the affective component of the physical pain response. Eisenberger and her
colleagues suggest that “Because of the adaptive value of mammalian social bonds, the
social attachment system… may have piggybacked onto the physical pain system to
promote survival” (p. 291).

Loneliness also appears to modulate the rudimentary reward system to extend its protective
function to social cognition and emotion. The ventral striatum, a key component of the
mesolimbic dopamine system, is rich in dopaminergic neurons and is critical in reward
processing and learning69, 70. The ventral striatum is activated by primary rewards such as
stimulant drugs71, abstinence-induced cravings for primary rewards72, and secondary
rewards such as money73. Evidence that social reward also activate the ventral striatum has
begun to accumulate in studies of romantic love74, social cooperation75, social
comparison76, and punitive altruism77. Cacioppo and colleagues78 investigated how an
individual's loneliness was related to the differential activation of the ventral striatum to
pleasant social versus matched nonsocial images. As depicted in Figure 2, lonely individuals
showed weaker activation of the ventral striatum to pleasant pictures of people than of
equally pleasant pictures of objects, whereas nonlonely individuals showed stronger
activation of the ventral striatum to pleasant pictures of people than of objects. Experience
sampling studies confirm that lonely individuals regard pleasant interpersonal interactions
to be less pleasant but less so than do nonlonely individuals.31

Regulatory Loop and Remaining Questions

Given our evolutionary heritage, the human brain and biology have been sculpted to seek
meaningful connections with others. In evolutionary time, social groupings were relatively
small and stable, and the pain of loneliness may have served both to promote the social
connection necessary for the survival of the genes and as a deterrent to selfish actions that
were detrimental to the group.58 The evidence reviewed here, however, suggests that
loneliness in contemporary society may affect human cognition in sometimes maladaptive
ways (see Figure 3). Specifically, feeling socially isolated can trigger implicit
hypervigilance for social threats, which in turn produces attentional, confirmatory, and
memorial biases. Accordingly, lonely individuals are more likely to attend to and construe
their social world as threatening, hold more negative social expectations, and remember
more negative social events than are nonlonely individuals. These cognitions increase the
likelihood that individuals engage in behavioral confirmation processes, through which they

produce more negative social interactions and elicit evidence confirming that they have
little personal control or social value. These dispositions, in turn, alter the nature and
likelihood of social engagement and activate neurobiological mechanisms that increase
activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and diminish sleep quality.
Repeated or chronic activation of threat surveillance in a social context, coupled with
diminished anabolic processes, may contribute to heightened cognitive load, diminished
executive functioning, dysregulated brain and physiological systems, and broad based
morbidity and mortality. Although this theoretical model is consistent with the evidence
reviewed here, many details remain to be tested and refined. The following questions may
be of special import.

•

•

•

To what extent is loneliness a consequence rather than an antecedent of incipient
dementia? Longitudinal and experimental studies suggest loneliness may play a
causal role in at least some of the observed associations between loneliness and
cognitive functioning, but sensory loss, functional impairments, and cognitive
impairments may also lessen social contact and increase loneliness. Questions
remain about the extent to which, and conditions under which, the associations
between loneliness and cognitive functioning reflect the effects of loneliness, the
effects of cognition, and the effects of a third variable.

By what mechanism might loneliness contribute to cognitive decline as people
age? Among the possible mechanistic pathways that warrant investigation are the
effects of loneliness on: (a) elevated activation of the HPA axis and/or increased
inflammatory responses in the brain, each of which may impact cognitive
functioning; (b) behavioral or neural plasticity such that older individuals are less
able to compensate for age-related degenerative changes in neural systems
involved in cognitive functioning; (c) the simplification of social cognition and
reduction in social stimulation and engagement that are tantamount to lower
cognitive stimulation; (d) cognitive load (and reduction in available cognitive
resources available for creative adaptations) produced by chronic surveillance for
and protection from threats; (e) elevations in depression and/or reductions in
physical activity; (f) the reduction in the number and quality of social interactions;
and (g) impairments in the consolidation of learning that may result from
diminished sleep quality.

Does the detrimental effect of loneliness occur later in life or is it cumulative across
the lifespan? If cumulative, are the deleterious effects of loneliness on cognition
(if causal) reversible? Increasing social contact and social support appear not to
be sufficient to lower loneliness or to explain the effects of loneliness on cognition.
How does one intervene to reduce perceived social isolation and promote healthy
social connections? Does the nature of effective interventions for loneliness differ
across age, gender, or ethnicity?

• What are the brain mechanisms underlying the association between loneliness and

cognition? Diminished prefrontal-cortico-striatal functioning, dendritic
arborization, brain-derived neurotrophic factors, and central anti-inflammatory
responses are just a few of the possibilities that are suggested by the extant
evidence.

Figure 1.
Differential gene expression in individuals high versus low in loneliness. Genome-wide
transcriptional profiles were assessed in peripheral blood leukocyte RNA samples collected
from individuals in the top and bottom 15% of the distribution of subjective social isolation.
Analysis by Affymetrix U133A high-density oligonucleotide arrays identified 209 transcripts
showing >30% difference in mean expression levels across groups (green = over-expression
in high-lonely, red = under-expression). High subjective social isolation is associated with a
statistically significant net reduction in the number of expressed genes (131 down-regulated
versus 78 up-regulated, p value by exact binomial test). (From Cole, Hawkley, Arevalo, Sung,
Rose, & Cacioppo, 2007 37.)

Figure 2.
A cluster of voxels centered in the ventral striatum, but extending to the amygdala and portions
of the anterior thalamus, showed an inverse relationship between loneliness and activation in
the pleasant social–pleasant nonsocial contrast. The scatterplots demonstrate the association
between loneliness and activity in this cluster in response to pleasant social pictures [r(21) =
_.46, p < .05], and in response to pleasant nonsocial pictures [r(21) = .69, p < .001]. Estimated
impulse response functions and mean percent signal change AUC for participants lower and
higher in loneliness (estimates at 1 SD above and below the mean UCLA score in our sample
are presented) show a crossover interaction for the relationship between loneliness and brain
responses to pleasant social and pleasant nonsocial stimuli, such that nonlonely participants
exhibit greater activation to pleasant pictures that contain social content and lonely participants
exhibit greater activation to pleasant nonsocial pictures. (From Cacioppo, J. T., Norris, C. J., Decety,
J., Monteleone, G., & Nusbaum, H. (2009). In the eye of the beholder: Individual differences in
perceived social isolation predict regional brain activation to social stimuli. Journal of
