Case report

SUMMARY
A 20- year- old man was admitted to an inpatient 
psychiatric unit for self- professed dissociative identity 
disorder. His presentation of multiple personalities 
without amnesia, dissociation or depersonalisation led 
to further examination of personality and cultural factors 
that may contribute to this uncommon presentation. 
Careful clinical investigation supported a diagnosis 
of schizotypal personality disorder with elements of 
fantastical thinking influenced by media presentations of 
dissociative identity disorder.

BACKGROUND
Dissociative  identity  disorder  (DID)  is  a  complex 
mental  illness  in  which  individuals  experience 
consistent impairments in identity, memory distur-
bance and disruption in behaviour. There is a signifi-
cant correlation with early trauma, especially sexual 
trauma. Around 94% may have experienced child-
hood physical or sexual abuse and over 80%  may 
meet  diagnostic  criteria  for  post- traumatic  stress 
disorder (PTSD).1 Childhood trauma and maltreat-
ment  lead  to  increased  risk  of  not  only  DID  and 
PTSD but also suicidal and self- harm behaviours.2

Schizotypal  personality  disorder  (SPD)  is  an 
under- recognised  personality  disorder  character-
ised by consistent themes of interpersonal relations, 
cognitive- perceptual disturbances and disorganised 
speech  and  behaviours.  The  fantastic  and  bizarre 
thought processes related to SPD can lead to exces-
sive  interests  and  beliefs  in  paranormal  and  pseu-
doparanormal ideas.

Here,  we  present  a  case  of  atypical  SPD  in  a 
patient  who  presented  to  an  inpatient  psychiatric 
unit  for  apparent  DID  symptomatology.  We  focus 
on  diagnostic  clarity  and  psychologic  assessment 
and interventions.

and elaborate diagrams of the relationships between 
personalities  and  added  a  personality  during  the 
admission.  He  described  competition  for  control 
between  the  personalities  and  was  engaged  and 
excited to discuss them.

The  patient  reported  the  perception  that  his 
adoptive  parent’s  divorce  was  traumatic  but 
described the divorce as amicable and denied signs 
and  symptoms  consistent  with  a  primary  trauma 
disorder.  He  further  denied  any  childhood  phys-
ical or sexual trauma. He was placed in foster care 
at 4 years old and adopted at around 8 years old. 
He  appeared  to  harbour  resentment  towards  his 
adoptive  mother.  The  patient  reported  consistent 
difficulties  with  close  interpersonal  relationships 
through his high school years until the present day. 
His language reflected poor self- esteem and exces-
sive concern for the opinions of others. The patient 
described a general dysthymic and socially anxious 
temperament  through  much  of  his  early  life  and 
worsening while in high school. He was not specific 
in the ages of onset or worsening of the dysthymic 
and  anxious  mood  symptoms.  Collateral  was  not 
obtained from family.

The  emergence  of  the  self- reported  multiple 
personalities began in high school during a period 
of  increased  interpersonal  conflict  with  peers 
and  family.  It  was  observed  by  the  care  team  that 
the  personalities  emerged  around  the  time  that 
the  film  Split  entered  the  box  office.  A  correla-
tion  was  also  noticed  regarding  the  characteris-
tics  of  the  patient’s  personalities  and  those  in  the 
film,  which  also  portrayed  a  childlike  character,  a 
charismatic  personality  and  a  dangerous  persona 
with  a  nonhuman  name  (‘The  Beast’).  Although 
the  patient  aware  of  the  film,  he  had  consistently 
denied watching the film at the time and denied any 
connection.

CASE PRESENTATION
A  20- year- old  man,  active  duty  military  service 
member,  was  admitted  to  a  military  inpatient 
psychiatric unit after he had informed a coworker 
about his experience of multiple personalities. On 
the  intake  evaluation,  the  patient  reported  several 
unique personalities, which he described as ‘alters’. 
These  personalities  included  a  variety  of  human 
figures  and  nonhuman  beings,  including  a  nerdy 
man,  an  ethereal  gatekeeper  or  protector,  a  child 
with  trauma,  a  charismatic  Casanova  and  “one 
who should not be named”. The patient had a full 
recollection of the experiences of each persona and 
appeared  to  jump  easily  between  them.  Through 
the  first  days  of  hospitalisation,  he  drew  intricate 

INVESTIGATIONS
Medically,  the  patient  was  stable.  He  presented 
without any acute or chronic medical illnesses. Vital 
signs and laboratory results including serum alcohol 
and  urine  drug  testing  were  within  normal  limits. 
He  was  not  taking  medications  or  supplements. 
There  were  no  signs  or  symptoms  consistent  with 
substance  intoxication  or  withdrawal.  The  patient 
was evaluated for delirium and other alterations of 
consciousness,  but  no  dysfunction  was  observed. 
In  this  case,  head  imaging  was  neither  considered 
medically nor diagnostically necessary.

A  thorough  history  was  taken  at  intake,  with 
clarifying  investigation  on  subsequent  days.  The 
primary  treatment  team,  led  by  a  psychiatrist,

performed daily clinical interviews, which explored the patient’s 
thought  patterns,  beliefs  and  childhood  experiences.  He  was 
evaluated  for  signs  and  symptoms  associated  with  psychotic 
disorders, mood disorders, trauma disorders, dissociative disor-
ders and personality disorders. No accurate family history could 
be obtained due to his adopted status. An independent clinical 
evaluation by interview was performed by a psychologist.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Given the unusual characteristics of the patient’s presentation, a 
significant range of diagnoses was initially considered, including 
psychotic  disorders,  mood  disorders,  trauma- related  disorders, 
factitious  disorder,  malingering,  dissociative  disorders  and 
personality disorders. The patient’s lack of reported history of 
trauma or significant mood symptoms were not consistent with 
a primary trauma- related disorder or mood disorder.

Psychotic disorders were considered early in the hospitalisation. 
The patient denied any hallucinations and did not present with 
disorganised  thinking  or  other  negative  symptoms.  Delusional 
disorder, in particular, was considered. Delusions are not typi-
cally amenable to change when faced with conflicting evidence 
and require a strong degree of conviction. The patient’s response 
to psychotherapeutic techniques within a relatively short period 
of time lends more credibility to the thoughts presenting more as 
strongly held odd beliefs than as true delusions. His constellation 
of symptoms outside the odd belief system was inevitably better 
explained by another mental disorder.

Malingering and factitious disorder were considered. Malin-
gering requires clear secondary gain and may be found at a higher 
prevalence in military populations.3 Factitious disorder presents 
as falsification of symptoms to take a sick role. Malingering was 
ruled out due to a lack of clear secondary gain. The patient was 
admitted in response to a concerning report by another service 
member and not by his request. He reported contentment with 
his military service and was supported by his leadership. Though 
the patient exhibited passion in talking about his personalities, 
he  appeared  to  do  so  more  out  of  a  need  for  nonjudgmental 
validation.

Despite his report of multiple personalities, the patient denied 
any  amnesia,  dissociation,  depersonalisation  and  derealisation. 
He also denied frank physical or sexual abuse, which is highly 
correlated  with  presentations  of  DID.4  This  quickly  ruled  out 
DID and other dissociative disorders.

Due to the chronic nature of his abnormal thought patterns, 
uncommon  beliefs  and  interpersonal  struggles,  the  treatment 
team evaluated the patient for personality disorders. His symptom 
constellation was found to be consistent with SPD. The findings 
were  consistent  between  the  primary  treatment  team  and  the 
independent evaluation by the psychologist. Consistent with the 
fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of 
Mental Disorders, he demonstrated a ‘pervasive pattern of social 
and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and 
reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as cognitive or 
perceptual  distortions  and  eccentricities  of  behaviour’,  which 
began in early adulthood, around 14 or 15 years old.5

He  clearly  and  consistently  reported  five  criteria  of  SPD. 
He  demonstrated  ideas  of  references  including  incorrect  inter-
pretation  of  causal  incidents  and  attributing  his  successes  to 
the  reported  personalities.  He  presented  with  odd  beliefs  and 
magical thinking, in which the personalities were a pseudopara-
normal  phenomenon  that  empowered  the  patient  and  allowed 
him to feel special. His thought process could be considered odd 
or at least abnormal. At times, his speech was overly digressive 

and  not  always  logical,  though  not  to  the  point  of  psychotic 
disorganisation.  The  patient  reported  paranoia  regarding  the 
intentions  of  others  including  his  family,  workmates  and  the 
treatment team. He lacked close friends and confidants, and his 
relationship with his family was quite limited.

TREATMENT
Though there are indications for psychopharmacological inter-
ventions  in  DID,  there  is  limited  data  on  the  use  of  psycho-
pharmacological interventions in SPD. Due to a combination of 
limited data in SPD and patient preference, the treatment team 
decided against psychopharmacological interventions. The liter-
ature  that  exists  focuses  on  the  use  of  psychotropics  to  target 
specific symptoms. For example, antipsychotics have been used 
in the treatment of related paranoia and stimulants in the treat-
ment of cognitive dysfunction and disorganised thinking.6 7

Treatment  focused  on  psychotherapeutic 

interventions. 
There  are  no  randomised  controlled  studies  supporting  the 
use  of  a  specific  psychotherapeutic  technique  in  SPD.  Due  to 
the  patient’s  initial  emotional  distress  and  paranoia,  therapy 
was  primarily  supportive,  with  a  focus  on  nonjudgmental 
rapport building, reflection and summarisation. Reflection and 
summarisation techniques were modified to combat the use of 
‘we’ in the patient’s description of self. For example, when the 
patient made a statement such as ‘we feel that we are not under-
stood’, the psychiatrist would reply ‘I understand that you feel 
that you are not understood. I imagine that it a difficult situ-
ation’.  A  consistent  effort  was  made  to  validate  the  patient’s 
emotional  distress  while  focusing  away  from  the  personali-
ties  and  towards  other  notable  aspects  of  the  patient’s  inter-
personal  struggles  and  internal  processes.  Through  consistent 
reinforcement of the singular and redirection of the therapeutic 
content from the personalities to other aspects of the patient’s 
reality, the daily therapeutic sessions shifted from focus on the 
personalities to focus on other aspects of the patient’s life and 
experiences. By the end of his hospitalisation, the patient did 
not discuss the personalities in the therapeutic sessions or with 
other patients.

Therapy  also  incorporated  interpersonal  and  psychoeduca-
tional  elements.  The  interpersonal  therapy  focused  on  ‘theory 
of mind’, how to understand others’ thoughts and feelings and 
incorporate  that  into  socially  appropriate  responses.  Emphasis 
was placed on familial and occupational interactions. Psychoed-
ucation was provided regarded the patient’s diagnosis. He exhib-
ited a strong emotional reaction, tearful for the only time in his 
hospitalisation.  The  moment  was  used  as  an  opportunity  to 
emphasise the patient’s strengths, including his powerful imagi-
nation and creativity and instil hope in the future. He emotion-
ally recovered quickly and was discharged on the eighth day of 
hospitalisation.

OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient engaged in outpatient individual and group therapy 
for  approximately  4  months  after  discharge.  He  fluctuated 
between  focus  on  interpersonal  problems  and  his  diagnosis. 
At  times,  he  did  report  multiple  personalities,  though  outpa-
tient  therapists  reinforced  his  SPD  diagnosis.  He  continued  to 
deny  a  connection  or  causation  between  media  influence  and 
his  symptom  presentation.  The  patient  experienced  temporary 
occupational limitations due to his hospitalisation but otherwise 
continued  in  his  military  obligation  without  significant  prob-
lems. The patient is alive at the time of this publication.

DISCUSSION
In the case herein, we describe a presentation of SPD disguised 
as  DID.  Accurate  diagnosis  is  vital  in  assuring  relevant  patient 
care  and  disposition.  Both  disorders  are  relatively  uncommon 
and  infrequently  diagnosed  on  inpatient  psychiatric  wards. 
Dissociative  identity  disorder  is  diagnosed  in  less  than  1%  in 
an  inpatient  setting  and  SPD  is  diagnosed  in  less  than  2%  of 
evaluated  individuals;  both  are  slightly  more  prevalent  in  men 
than  women.8–12  The  diagnosis  requires  recurrent  dissociative 
and  amnestic  periods,  and  so  a  report  of  multiple  personali-
ties  should  not  lead  to  an  assumption  of  DID.  However,  DID 
should  be  highly  considered  as  the  diagnosis  in  a  presentation 
of impaired identity with amnestic and dissociative facets. The 
diagnosis  of  SPD  requires  a  comprehensive  clinical  assessment 
but may be supported by diagnostic instruments. The Structured 
Clinical  Interview  for  DSM- IV  (SCID- III),  the  semi- structured 
interview for DSM- III- R Personality Disorders (SIDP- R) and the 
Structured  Interview  for  DSM- III  Personality  Disorder  (SIDP) 
are proven reliable and valid, but the use may be controversial 
due to the current use of the DSM-5.13

Schizotypal  symptom  presentation  can  be  conceptualised  in 
three  groups:  cognitive- perceptual  disturbances  (including  odd 
beliefs, magical thinking, ideas of reference, paranoia and unusual 
perceptual disturbances), oddness and disorganisation and inter-
personal  dysfunction.14  The  combination  of  abnormal  thought 
and interpersonal struggles may contribute to the susceptibility 
to beliefs outside the cultural norm. These can include belief in 
paranormal phenomena and alternative cultural beliefs.

Autistic fantasy is an immature defence mechanism that involves 
daydreaming and fantastic thinking as a method for coping with 
stress and preventing a breakdown in self- esteem.15 16 Here, the 
term  autistic  is  used  in  the  classic  psychodynamic  reference  to 
omnipotence, not autistic spectrum disorder.17 Media may have 
an impact on the presentation of mental illness in cases involving 
significant autistic thinking. In this case, it is suspected that expo-
sure to a popular movie that incorrectly portrayed DID contrib-
uted to construction of a fantasy world to protect the patient’s 
self- image in the face of increased interpersonal stressors.

Personality  disorders  often  develop  during  a  person’s  young 
adulthood. The use of development theoretical constructs such 
as  Eriksonian  stages  may  lend  a  further  understanding  of  the 
patient’s  struggles.  During  the  teen  years,  an  individual  would 
be  working  through  the  ‘identity  versus  confusion’  Eriksonian 
stage; the development of a rich inner world with several iden-
tities  would  bolster  the  patient’s  sense  of  self  despite  social 
challenges.18  The  later  attention  the  patient  experienced  while 
hospitalised  may  have  validated  his  social  standing  and  would 
have reinforced the beliefs if not for psychotherapeutic interven-
tion. Eriksonian developmental stages are theoretical and, while 
this explanation may be accurate, it cannot be proven.

There  are  certain  limitations  in  this  case  study.  Though  the 
patient  was  interviewed  via  an  independent  clinical  evaluation 
by  a  psychologist,  neither  personality  assessment  scales  nor 
the  aforementioned  psychometric  measures  (SCID- III,  SIDP- R, 
SIDP) were used. Patient history and self- report may have been 
inaccurate at times, as subjective reporting is flawed and may be 
altered by emotional distress and the effects of time. The treat-
ment team was unable to obtain collateral from family or friends 
from the patient’s childhood. Finally, the therapeutic techniques 
with focus on the use of ‘I’ statements (replacing ‘we’ statements) 
appeared to have contributed to the cessation of the discussion 
of  other  personalities.  In  this  case,  causation  cannot  be  ascer-
tained from correlation.

Case report

Personality disorders are not uniform in presentation. Careful 
differential  diagnoses  must  be  considered  in  cases  that  present 
well  outside  the  norm.  Assumption  of  early  diagnoses  may 
reinforce  the  incorrect  diagnosis,  especially  in  mental  illnesses 
which are prominent in the media. SPD is a personality disorder 
in  which  the  combination  of  abnormal  thoughts  and  interper-
sonal struggles may lead to presentations that initially appear to 
be  that  of  another  mental  disorder.  Patients  with  SPD  present 
infrequently to treatment and no large systematic studies address 
psychotherapeutic  and  psychopharmacologic 
interventions; 
therefore, such interventions should be thoughtfully considered 
and employed. Accurate diagnosis and careful psychotherapeutic 
interventions  may  improve  the  mental  well- being  of  patients 
with SPD.

In  this  case,  we  present  a  case  of  a  young  adult  male  active 
duty  service  member  admitted  to  an  inpatient  psychiatric  unit 
for  apparent  DID  symptomatology,  with  an  ultimate  diagnosis 
of  SPD.  This  case  allows  an  opportunity  to  provide  education 
and awareness of differential diagnosis in potential personality 
disorders. While the literature is limited in evidence for specific 
diagnostic procedures and treatment interventions, there is some 
evidence  for  specific  psychometric  assessments  and  symptom- 
based psychopharmacological treatment. In this case, a modified 
supportive  therapy  was  used  in  lieu  of  psychopharmacological 
treatment, with some apparent benefit.

Learning points

 ► Schizotypal personality disorder is an under- recognised 

disorder characterised by consistent themes of interpersonal 
relations, cognitive- perceptual disturbances and disorganised 
speech and behaviours. The fantastic and bizarre thought 
processes related to SPD can lead to excessive interests and 
beliefs in paranormal and pseudoparanormal ideas.
 ► Media may influence the presentation of symptoms in 

schizotypal personality disorder.

 ► Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as supportive and 

interpersonal therapy, and psychoeducation are preferred in 
the treatment of schizotypal personality disorder, with a focus 
on consolidation of the individual.
