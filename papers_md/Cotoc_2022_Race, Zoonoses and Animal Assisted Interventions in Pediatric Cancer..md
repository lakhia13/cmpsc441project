Abstract: Emerging evidence accumulates regarding the benefits of animal-assisted interventions (AAIs)
in facilitating pediatric cancer treatment and alleviating symptomatology through positive changes in
the patients’ emotional, mental, and even physical status. A major concern expressed by healthcare
providers and parents in implementing AAIs in hospital settings is the transmission of disease from
animals to patients. Immunocompromised children, such as pediatric cancer patients are at increased
risk for pet-associated diseases. Furthermore, existing disparities among the racial and ethnic minority
groups of pediatric cancer patients can potentially exacerbate their risk for zoonoses. This literature
review highlights the most common human infections from therapy animals, connections to the race
and ethnic background of pediatric oncology patients, as well as means of prevention. The discussion is
limited to dogs, which are typically the most commonly used species in hospital-based animal-assisted
therapy. The aim is to highlight specific preventive measures, precautions and recommendations that
must be considered in hospitals’ protocols and best practices, particularly given the plethora of benefits
provided by AAI for pediatric cancer patients, staff and families.

Pediatric cancer will affect 10,470 children under the age of 15 in 2022 alone in the
US, and it is one of the leading causes of death by disease for this population group,
alongside congenital malformations and intentional self-harm [1,2]. Despite improved
treatments and longer life expectancy, the challenges for pediatric cancer patients are
ongoing and lifelong. They struggle daily with debilitating early and late side effects
including pharmacogenomic variations with drug exposure, pain, fatigue, psychological
problems, fear of cancer recurrences, cognitive difﬁculties, social problems, and other
quality of life aspects [2].

Racial and ethnic groups disparities are present in the rates of the most common types
of childhood cancer, with Hispanic children having nearly twice the rate of leukemia as
Black children [3].

Like all cancers, gene mutations and alterations lead to uncontrolled cell growth and
eventually malignancy. These genetic changes are passed down from parent to child, whose
family history, risk factors and prior exposures further enhance racial and ethnic disparities
for pediatric cancer. These disparities increase children’s vulnerability to the development
of psychological and physical disorders, which may directly or indirectly affect their
general clinical condition. The diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer causes physical
and emotional suffering not only for children, but also for parents, caregivers, and their
communities [3,4].

There is a growing movement and awareness of treating cancer patients in a holis-
tic approach. Pediatric cancer patients can partake in integrated medicine care, which
incorporates conventional medical treatments along with different types of complementary
therapies. Animal Assisted Interventions (AAI) is blanket terminology for this type of

therapy, including animal-assisted therapy (AAT), animal-assisted activities (AAA), animal-
assisted education (AAE) and AAI Resident animals (RA) [5]. Thus, AAI could mitigate
the arduous physical and psychosocial symptoms for cancer patients.

Research on human–animal interaction, especially as it relates to pediatric cancer, is
limited. Recognition of AAI as an innovative adjuvant therapeutic modality, its safety and
efﬁcacy in different environments, including oncologic hospitals, is growing.

One of the main obstacles in a wider implementation of AAIs in the clinical settings
is the concern about zoonoses and possibility of infection transmission from the therapy
animal to the child patient [4,6]. The evidence of transmitted zoonotic pathogens in this
context is scarce. Furthermore, research on susceptibility to zoonoses associated with dogs
for minority groups in the US is almost non-existent.

The aim of this review was to synthetize the available data on the most common human
infections from therapy animals and their risk factors for pediatric oncology patients,
particularly for minority groups of patients. The emerging ﬁndings can help improve
existing hospital and clinic animal-assisted therapy protocols, with the dogs undergoing
health checks for often overlooked pathogens, resulting in safer therapeutic environments
for children with cancer, guardians, and staff.

2. Materials and Methods

For this paper, we conducted a scientiﬁc literature search performed thorough May
2021, examining the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), SCOPUS, Cochrane Library.
The search used MeSH terms and included all possible combinations of keywords (with
wildcard characters) from the following 4 groups: (1) “animal assisted therapy”, “pet
therapy”, “animal assisted intervention”, or “human animal interaction”; (2) “cancer”,
“neoplasm”, or “tumor”; (3) “children”, “adolescent”, or “pediatrics”; and (4) “race” or
“ethnic background”. We selected articles describing animal-assisted intervention with
pediatric cancer patients, as well as articles mentioning racial and ethnic characteristics of
pediatric cancer patients. The articles obtained were screened for relevance and selected
based on the abstracts and their relevance for the scientiﬁc literature. Furthermore, we per-
formed a cited (i.e., forward reference search) and a reference list (i.e., backward reference
search) resulting in additional articles. All relevant articles included were in English.

3. Results
3.1. AAI and Pediatric Cancer

A diagnosis of childhood cancer has debilitating consequences for children, families,
and their communities. The demand for a holistic patient-center treatment includes incor-
porating complementary and alternative adjuvant therapies, such as animal-assisted inter-
ventions (AAIs). This terminology encompasses animal-assisted therapy (AAT), animal-
assisted education (AAE), animal-assisted activity (AAA) and more [5]. The most common
animals used for AAIs in clinical settings are dogs.

Despite the history of human–animal interactions, research on AAI is still in its infancy.
Studies on AAI in the pediatric oncologic context are scarce, with only eight known studies
conducted internationally. Four of these studies were done in the US (Table 1).

Emerging evidence reports beneﬁcial effects for patients with phycological and physi-
cal diseases. The unique human–animal bond is believed to facilitate positive changes in
patients’ emotional, behavioral, mental, and physical status [7–16].

The presence of animals can lead children to have a more favorable perception of the

hospital environment, increasing their participation and enhancing their displayed affect [8].

Short-term improvements were found in children’s functional autonomy, such as
feeding and nutrition following AAI sessions [9,10]. Results also showed higher heart rates
in children participating in AAI compared to children in nonpet therapy groups, but also
noticeable pain alleviation, decreased fear and discomfort felt during medical procedures
and cancer treatments [8–10].

Some beneficial effects of AAI on
children: a better perception of
the environment and a good
interaction with dogs. A total of
94% of parents had positive
perception of AAI. The medical
staff needed more information
about safety. The presence of
infections in the wards did not
increase after AAIs.

practice of AAI with pediatric
oncology patients

A virtual letter writing
program can provide pediatric
oncology patients a source for
connection, friendship, shared
experience, fun, and a way to
process the cancer experience
with a dog or cat pen pal who
has also faced cancer or
serious medical treatment.

McCullough et al. (2018) noted improvements following AAIs in the initial stages of
pediatric cancer treatment, with children experiencing signiﬁcant reduction in anxiety and
parents reporting signiﬁcant decrease in parenting stress [11].

Hospital staff, parents and guardians recognized positive changes following AAI,
including enhanced calmness, motivation and better interpersonal relationships between

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7772

healthcare professionals and patients, as reported by questionaries of the medical staff in
an Italian study and qualitative analysis in a Brazilian study [8,12].

Reported long-term outcomes in children that took part in AAI include improved
self-esteem, treatment compliance and motivation. Patients reported being more optimistic
about the future, evidenced by a positive correlation between happier mood and higher
cortisol levels. Moreira et al. noted a reduction in stress, anxiety, loneliness, and isolation
following AAI sessions [12]. On the other hand, McCullough found no signiﬁcant difference
over time between patients exposed to AAI and those who were not [11].

Novel intervention using virtual AAIs sessions (i.e., virtual visits with a dog or a
cat through letter writing and pictures) promoted well-being, improved connection, and
friendship among pediatric cancer patients [13].

AAIs can contribute to improving the overall quality of life in children experienc-
ing cancer, by decreasing pain and fear, providing a much-needed distraction from the
gruesome reality of cancer treatments and procedures, lowering emotional distress, and
facilitating symptom management [4,6,12].

3.2. Zoonoses Associated with Dogs

Despite approval and recognition of the beneﬁcial effects of AAI, parents/guardians
requested additional safety issue facts and information [8]. Pediatric oncologic patients due
to their immunodeﬁciency status are at higher risk of developing disease or complications
from zoonotic diseases.

Furthermore, parents and staff lacked adequate knowledge on the implementation of
AAIs, as well as insufﬁcient understanding of the therapeutic objectives of animal assisted
therapy with pediatric cancer patients [12].

In this context, the close interactions between humans and animals increases the risk
factors and can facilitate the transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms from
animals to patients. Exposure can occur through inhalation and contact with skin, eyes and
mucous membranes. Transmission occurs through direct contact, inhalation of aerosols,
infected saliva, contaminated urine or feces, or contact with contaminated objects [17–19].
Common transmissible diseases associated with dogs include viral infections (Norovirus
infections, Rabies), bacterial infections (Bordetella bronchiseptica-associated disease, Brucel-
losis, Campylobacterosis, Capnocytophagosis, Coxiellosis, Cryptosporidiosis, Infections
with pathogenic E. coli, Leptospirosis, Methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus/MRSA,
Pasteurellosis, Salmonellosis, Staphylococcal pyoderma, Tularemia cutaneous, Yersiniosis
enterocolitica), fungal infections(Ringworm), parasites (Echinococcosis, Giardiasis, Mange)
and Visceral larva migrans [17–20] (Table 2).

For the majority of zoonoses, effective treatments are available. Basic preventive
care (e.g., internal and external parasite control, vaccination) protects both canine and
human health and is further enhanced by animal and environmental management control.
Epidemiologic studies on the topic suggest that the occurrence of dog associated zoonotic
disease is low overall [19]. Results from an Italian study showed that 31.6% of the animals
involved in AAI over a two-year period positive for pathogens, with 21.7% of the dogs
harboring potentially dangerous zoonotic parasites (Ancylostomatidae, Eucoleus aerophilus,
Toxocara canis, Giardia duodenalis, Nannizzia gypsea and Paraphyton mirabile) [7]. Availability
of educational resources and open communication about zoonotic diseases for medical
staff, dog handlers and patients is critical and ensures good practices. It also builds trust
between patients, AAI teams and medical staff.

The surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in the context of AAI is necessary for ensuring a
safe environment in the clinical setting, for patients, staff and families. Prevention methods
for zoonotic diseases vary for different pathogens; however, standard preventive measures
(vaccination, serology testing) are recognized as effective tools in reducing the risks of
exposure and transmission.

3.3. Susceptibility to Zoonoses by Race

Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease past infancy among children in the
United States. Among children ages 0 to 14 years, it is estimated that in 2021, 10,500 will be
diagnosed with cancer and 1190 will die of the disease [3].

Within the pediatric population, regarding racial and ethnic minority children, we
found that compared to non-Hispanic White childhood cancer patients, Black and Hispanic

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7772

6 of 11

patients had worse survival for all cancers combined, leukemias and lymphomas, brain
tumors, and solid tumors [21–25].

Black and Hispanic patients had a higher risk of death compared to White, non-
Hispanic patients. Black patients had a higher risk of death at 5 years after diagnosis
compared to non-Hispanic white patients, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 69.8% for
Black patients, 72.9% for Hispanic patients and 77.6% for White patients [21–23]. Similar
differences were found when comparing 12.5-year survival rates [24]. Marcotte found the
incidence of leukemias to be higher in White children when compared to both Black and
Asian/Paciﬁc Islander children [25].

Despite similar reported survival rates for Hispanics, African Americans, Asians and
White children, gaps in understanding disparities in cancer still exist [26,27]. Racial and
ethnic disparities in childhood CNS tumor survival appear to have their roots at least
partially in post-diagnosis factors, potentially due to the lack of access to high quality care,
leading to poorer overall outcomes [28,29]. These disparities include differences or delays in
treatment. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of private insurance, and adolescent/young
adult age are most often associated with these poorer outcomes [26]. Additional disparities
include impaired access to care and clinical trials, differences in cancer biology, treatment
non-adherence, language barriers, and implicit racial bias. Although socioeconomic factors
may account for a large proportion of disparities seen, the causes of disparities are complex
and interconnected and still need to be better understood [27,28]. Further studies on how
systemic racism and oppression impact pediatric cancer are needed.

Prior research suggests that ethnicity is a crucial factor shaping disease knowledge [30].
Hispanics/Latinos have 30% less knowledge on rabies compared to non-Latino Whites
counterparts. Language and cultural barriers, the lack of available educational materi-
als in languages other than English for transmissible infectious diseases, all play a role.
Furthermore, African American people have lower knowledge on rabies than their White
counterparts. In this case, trust in the information source was a key factor, with African
Americans having low or diminished trust in public health authorities. Women also scored
higher on knowledge about rabies than males [31].

Health disparities are a heavy burden on the US healthcare system, with racial and
ethnic differences in chronic disease morbidity and mortality well documented. Non-
Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics exhibit odds 1.7 times and 2.8 times higher than those of
non-Hispanic Whites for contracting enteric pathogens [32]. Non-Hispanic Blacks were
almost twice as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to be seropositive for Helicobacter pylori, and
Mexican Americans were 2.2 times more likely to be seropositive than non-Hispanic Whites.
This higher prevalence of infection for minority groups is also reported for Toxoplasma
gondii, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Herpex Simplex2 [32].

These disparities are inherited by minority children, and hence by minority pediatric can-
cer patients. Combined with the immunocompromised status as a result of cancer treatments,
the prevalence for infections for minority pediatric cancer patients increases considerably.

3.4. Existing Hospital Protocols for AAIs

Perhaps in part due to broad media claims of patients beneﬁts, canine-assisted in-
terventions are becoming more popular in hospital settings [33]. States including Illinois
(Ill. Admin. Code tit. 77 § 250.890) have established policies for AAI based on CDC
recommendation regarding establishing a department in charge, sanitation and infection
control, certiﬁcation of training, patient screening for participation, areas permitted, length
of sessions, type of animals, policies for incidents, and patient consent [34]. Despite the
existence of these proposed guidelines for AAI in hospitals, there are signiﬁcant differences
in infection control policies across these groups [35]. Additional research is needed to inves-
tigate whether therapy animals can serve as pathogen vectors, from being contaminated by
contact with one patient, and then transmitting these pathogens to another patient, leading
to pathogen exchange. This is critical to test because many patients served by these therapy

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7772

7 of 11

animals have a compromised health status and may be at higher risk of infection compared
to the general population [36].

Chuback and Hawkes (2016) reported on the variability of practices and protocols
used across institutions. These differences in protocols and intervention designs could
potentially compromise the outcomes, safety and generalizability of ﬁndings [14].

Current guidelines recommend that the following 10 health-related factors be evalu-
ated at each life stage for a canine patient: lifestyle effect on the patient’s safety, zoonotic
and human safety risk, behavior, nutrition, parasite control, vaccination, dental health,
reproduction, breed-speciﬁc conditions, and a baseline diagnostic proﬁle [37,38].

Findings of AAI studies with pediatric cancer patients show a lack of standardization
of the number of canines, duration, and frequency of sessions, the executed activities, and
the safety measures for the animals and cancer patients. Lefebvre et al. (2008) advocated
the need for universal, consensual and collaborative guidelines that represents the interests
of the stakeholders in the pediatric cancer arena, which provides speciﬁc recommendations
to minimize both injuries and the transmission of infectious organisms to and from therapy
animals [37–39]. The guidelines developed recommended a less-than-rigorous screening
protocol to identify animal carriage of speciﬁc pathogens (including group A streptococci,
Clostridium difﬁcile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and MRSA). Exceptions were made
for cases when the animal interacted directly with a human carrier or if the dog is linked to
an outbreak of infectious diseases [39].

Silva and Osorio (2018) proposed and implemented an effective AAI protocol for
outpatient pediatric oncology patients in Brazil. Patients were screened for severe infec-
tions, such as infection by resistant bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative
oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or cefepime-resistant
and/or meropenem-resistant Gram-negative bacillus), or suspected or conﬁrmed infection
with Clostridium difﬁcile; no details are provided on what infections the therapy animals
were screened for [16].

Santaniello et al. (2020) reported on the presence of P. multocida in dogs performing
AAI, highlighting the potential risk of this infection being transmitted from therapy animals
to vulnerable individuals, including immunocompromised patients [40]. Furthermore,
results of a systematic review emphasize the need for mandatory microbial control of
the therapy animals, along with strong hygienic rules, considering the evidence of in-
creased risk of zoonoses associated with dogs for ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium,
Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Enterobacter spp.) [41].

Studies show a lack of effective educational campaigns and open communication
networks between hospital infection control departments and therapy animal handlers
regarding infection risk [36]. Expanding and improving infection control measures for
AAIs in cancer hospitals and clinics is critical to obtain a positive balance of the beneﬁts
and risks for all stakeholders [42,43].

4. Discussion

Historically, African Americans have had the highest death rate and lowest survival
rate of any racial or ethnic group for most cancers. Although there have been improvements
in recent years, persistence of systemic racism, oppression, lower socioeconomic status,
impaired access to health insurance and adequate medical care services support existing
health disparities, manifested in African Americans still being the populational group with
the highest cancer rates. Non-Hispanics have also a higher risk of death compared to their
White counterparts [1,3].

Pediatric cancer is one of the few cancer types where the discrepancies in cancer
incidence are lower. Black children experience decreased incidence of acute lymphoid
leukemia compared to Whites, and this decreased incidence was strongest at ages 1 through
7 years. Hispanic children have a decreased overall incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma and
astrocytoma but experience increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7772

8 of 11

to non-Hispanic Whites. Substantially decreased risk across many tumor types was ob-
served for Asian/Paciﬁc Islanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives pediatric cancer
patients [3,21–25].

Despite these encouraging statistics, health disparities impacting minority groups are
also affecting children experiencing cancer. A cancer diagnosis has major repercussions
not only for the child who is diagnosed, but also for his immediate family and caretakers.
Systemic oppression, racism, ﬁnancial burdens all play a role in increasing the disease
burden for disadvantaged and minority groups of patients.

Furthermore, prior evidence suggests a higher susceptibility to infections for Hispanics
and Blacks. A Canadian study showed that therapy dogs visiting hospitals have almost ﬁve
times higher odds of carrying MRSA than therapy dogs who visit other locations, such as
schools [43]. Compounding the immunodeﬁcient health status of pediatric cancer patients,
their risk for zoonotic diseases increases. Mitigating the zoonoses risks requires all AAI
stakeholders in a clinical setting to collaborate and have accurate and timely information
on infection diseases [19].

Previous studies have not reported any serious negative impacts of AAI, and most
report at least some positive effect on the patients and families. Several studies speak of the
beneﬁts of AAI.

Chia-Chun et al. [44], in a study of children’s systolic blood pressure (SBP) when
measuring SBP before and after AAI, reported decreased levels from before to during
and continued after the AAI interaction [45]. Lindstron-Nilsson et al. (2020) found the
well-being of children increased to very good after AAI and reported the hospital stay as
better with 93% of the children assessing their interaction with the dog as very good [45].
Zeblisky and Jennings (2016) reported similar results at a large children’s hospital. Data
from a 9-year study indicated a 93% percent positive change in the mood of patients [46].
Avila-Alverez and Pardo-Vasquez (2020) concur as children and parents gave AAI their
highest satisfaction rating with a signiﬁcant improvement in the child’s mood [47]. In
a survey of parents and staff at a children’s hospital, Uglow (2019) reported that out of
200 respondents, 100% recommended expanding the services across the U.K. and had no
concerns of the dogs being present, their behavior or cleanliness [48].

Concerns of disease transmission may be better addressed with the active involvement
of veterinarians. Currently, in many hospital settings, the veterinarian role is limited to
requests made by the pet owner for participation based on hospital policies. Expanding
that role so the veterinarian is an active member of a team that includes hospital staff, the
individual responsible for care of the animal would enhance the ability to focus on the
well-being of the pet, possibly mitigation of the spread of disease and enhance the ability
to maximize the beneﬁt of the AAI [37,38]. To assist veterinarians working with animals
participating in AAI, products such as wellness health care checklists could facilitate
communications between the veterinarian and client relating to pets used in AAI.

As AAI are becoming more and more popular in hospital settings, the active involve-
ment of veterinarians could play a vital role in working alongside hospital administrative
and clinical staff, and the AAI handlers in developing safeguards to minimize risk and
maximize beneﬁts to venerable humans and protect therapy dog welfare.

5. Conclusions

A successful AAI hospital protocol and disease prevention program relies on cancer
patients, parents, therapy animals’ handlers and staff receiving accurate, timely advice
and information on risk reduction for zoonoses. Given the health beneﬁts of AAI and
the vulnerability of pediatric cancer patients, well outlined infection control measures
must be included in any hospital/clinic protocol for therapy animals. Minority children,
particularly the immunocompromised cancer patients, are at increased risk for zoonotic
infections, so additional safeguards should be considered.

These safeguards include speciﬁc consideration for the most common zoonoses associ-
ated with animal-assisted therapy dogs. Screenings and preventive vaccinations should

be discussed for the zoonoses associated with dogs, with moderate risk of transmission.
Considering their wealth of knowledge and expertise on zoonoses, veterinarians should
be consulted and included in the teams that develop clinical protocols for animal assisted
interventions in any oncologic treatment and care setting.
