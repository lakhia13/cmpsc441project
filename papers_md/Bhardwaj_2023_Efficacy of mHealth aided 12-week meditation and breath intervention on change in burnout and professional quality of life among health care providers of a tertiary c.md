Introduction: Burnout is “Chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully 
managed.”  Professional  quality  of  life  (PQL)  includes  work  related  experiences 
of  compassion  satisfaction  and  compassion  fatigue.  Healthcare  providers 
(HCPs)  are  highly  susceptible  to  burnout  and  compassion  fatigue  due  to  their 
demanding work, which lowers PQL. Burnout leads to poor care, medical errors, 
and patient safety across healthcare disciplines. Yoga has been shown to improve 
resilience, reduce stress, and increase self-compassion and psycho-physiological 
coherence. This study compared HCPs in a mHealth-aided 12-week yoga-based 
meditation and breath intervention to waitlist controls for HCP burnout and PQL 
at a north Indian tertiary care hospital.

Methods:  This  was  randomized  waitlist-controlled  trial.  Total  98  HCPs  (62 
males and 36 females) with an average age of 28.26  ±  3.547  years were enrolled 
consecutively  from  March  2021  to  November  2022.  Randomization  was  done 
with  opaque  sealed  envelopes  numbered  in  a  computer-generated  sequence. 
The  experimental  group  (n  =  49)  received  12  online  weekly  yoga  sessions  and 
performed  daily  home  practice  (6  days  a  week).  The  waitlisted  control  group 
(n  =  49)  continued  their  daily  routine.  Maslach’s  burnout  inventory  (MBI), 
professional  quality  of  life  (PQL)  and  anthropometric  measurements  were 
assessed at baseline and after 12  weeks.

Results:  After  12  weeks, 
depersonalization,  and  personal  accomplishment  showed  a  highly  significant 
difference  between  the  two  groups  (p  <  0.001).  PQL  outcomes  of  compassion 
satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma also differed significantly (p <  0.001). 
Within group analysis showed that MBI and PQL outcomes improved significantly 
(p <  0.001) for the experimental group after 12  weeks.

doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. Integrating yoga into healthcare 
settings is crucial for addressing the detrimental impact of burnout on decision-
making  and  promoting  positive  patient  outcomes.  mHealth  technologies  have 
the  potential  to  enhance  the  user-friendliness  of  yoga-based  interventions 
by  personalizing  the  practice  space  and  time.  Yoga-based  interventions  and 
mHealth technologies can effectively address physician burnout, in a simple and 
implementable manner.

1. Introduction

Burnout occurs when employees are exposed to a stressful work 
environment with high job demands and low resources (1). As per the 
World Health Organization and the International Classification of 
Disease-11, “burnout is an occupational syndrome conceptualized as 
resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully 
managed”  (2,  3).  Health  care  providers  (HCPs)  are  particularly 
susceptible to burnout due to the demanding nature of their job (1).

Burnout  manifests  in  three  main  dimensions:  emotional 
low  personal 
exhaustion  (EE),  depersonalization  (DP),  and 
accomplishment  (PA)  (2,  3).  EE  is  characterized  by  feeling 
overwhelmed, stressed, and fatigued when the demands of the job 
outweigh one’s capacity to cope. DP involves losing enthusiasm and 
displaying an impersonal attitude toward work, perceiving the job as 
burdensome or monotonous. Low PA refers to experiencing low levels 
of competence, effectiveness, and impact on work and people.

Burnout is a global phenomenon, with studies predicting a wide 
range of prevalence estimates among HCPs in Arab countries (4), the 
Middle East (5), and the US (6). The prevalence of burnout among 
intensive  care  professionals  ranges  from  6  to  47%  (7).  In  India,  a 
questionnaire-based  survey  showed  a  high  prevalence  of  burnout 
among  doctors,  with  scores  of  45,  65.98,  and  87%  for  the  three 
Maslach  burnout  inventory  (MBI)  subscales  of  EE,  DP,  and  PA, 
respectively (8). Another study suggested that residential doctors not 
only  have  moderate  (66%)  to  high  (13%)  levels  of  stress,  but  also 
experience burnout (90%), go through depression (30%), and even 
have suicidal thoughts (16%). During COVID-19, there was a global 
surge in the number of cases of burnout, with prevalence counts going 
as  high  as  67%  (9).  This  trend  was  also  observed  in  India,  where 
burnout was rampant among frontline nurses and HCPs (10, 11).

Professional quality of life (PQL) refers to the overall well-being 
and  satisfaction  of  HCPs  with  their  work.  PQL  comprises  two 
fundamental  dimensions:  compassion  satisfaction  (CS)  and 
compassion fatigue (12). CS is the positive aspect of PQL and refers to 
the joy of helping others professionally. It also involves feeling good 
about co-workers, contributing to the workplace, and enjoying one’s 
work’s larger social impact (12). Compassion fatigue is the negative 
aspect of PQL, which can be further divided into two components 
(12).  The  first  component  is  burnout  (BO),  which  is  typically 
associated  with  feelings  of  exhaustion,  frustration,  anger,  and 
depression. (Hereby BO is referred to as the individual component of 
Burnout under compassion fatigue of PQL) The second component is 

known as secondary traumatic stress (ST), which is driven by fear and 
the experience of work-related trauma (12).

Prevalence trends for PQL among HCPs in India have not been 
directly  examined,  and  further  research  is  needed  in  this  regard. 
Nonetheless,  the  importance  of  PQL  in  healthcare  settings  and 
understanding its impact on HCPs cannot be undermined.

Burnout and PQL are interlinked. Evidence suggests that self-
compassion  and  resilience  are  associated  with  higher  PQL,  while 
compassion fatigue and burnout are negatively associated with PQL 
(13). Burnout can negatively affect the health and well-being of HCPs 
(13), leading to poor quality care, medical errors, and patient safety 
issues (7). Higher levels of burnout have been associated with lower 
quality and safety across healthcare disciplines (14).

The cause of this profound burnout syndrome and the interlinked 
low PQL among doctors and HCPs can be pin-pointed to prolonged 
stress due to overwork. However, the factors responsible for this stress 
accumulation may vary and include a lack of resources, a high patient 
load, administrative and managerial pressure for profit earning, and 
crippling dependency upon the hospital, institution, or organization 
(15, 16). Despite undergoing significant amounts of stress, HCPs in 
India avoid seeking help due to reasons like lack of time, cost issues, 
fear  of  future  academic  jeopardy,  confidentiality  issues,  and 
stigma (17).

Mind–body therapies like Yoga and mindfulness, among others, 
have been recognized as helpful interventions to mitigate the effects 
of stress and reduce burnout among HCPs (18). Yoga is a system of 
Indian philosophy that emphasizes the balance of physical, mental, 
and spiritual health (19). Nowadays, Yoga is commonly known as a 
multimodal mind–body practice that includes different techniques 
such as physical postures, breathing practices, philosophical wisdom, 
and meditation (20). Several physical and mental health benefits have 
been  associated  with  Yoga,  including  improvements  in  physical 
performance and injury prevention (21), adopting a healthier lifestyle 
(22), physical and mental well-being (20), etc.

Yoga is becoming increasingly popular in western and European 
countries (19), leading to the development of different schools of Yoga 
and  an  increase  in  the  use  of  Yoga-based  interventions  in  health 
research (20). Research evidence suggests that Yoga interventions help 
reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and musculoskeletal pain among 
HCPs and medical students at high risk of compromised health (23). 
Findings from a systematic review suggested that Yoga may be an 
effective approach for managing and preventing stress and burnout in 
HCPs (24).

While  the  effects  are  evident,  Yoga-related  studies  have 
identified adherence to intervention as a limiting factor due to a 
lack  of  motivation,  the  effort  required  in  practice,  and  time 
constraints (25), all three of which seem to be common phenomena 
among HCPs who work hectic schedules and continuous shifts. 
Thus,  compliance  becomes  a  major 
in  behavioral 
interventions like Yoga (26).

issue 

mHealth, or mobile health, refers to the use of mobile devices such 
as smartphones, tablets, and wearable technology for health-related 
purposes (26). mHealth has been effective in improving care services, 
especially those aimed at changing behavior (27). mHealth has been 
effective  in  facilitating  behavioral  changes  related  to  disease 
prevention, lifestyle modification, and disease management (28). The 
use  of  mHealth  for  self-monitoring  and  implementing  lifestyle 
interventions  has  been  shown  to  positively  impact  adherence  to 
behavioral interventions (29, 30). Thus, mHealth can be a valuable 
technological tool for delivering behavioral interventions like yoga 
and addressing the problem of compliance.

Since physician health is a burning topic nowadays, especially 
after  the  COVID  pandemic,  global  initiatives  are  being  taken  at 
healthcare  institutions  worldwide  to  implement  evidence-based 
mind–body  interventions  for  relieving  job-related  stress  among 
doctors, nurses, and employees. India too is ramping up its use of 
these tried and tested indigenous tools of stress management in health 
research  (31);  however,  methodological  strength  and  robustness 
remain persistent issues (23, 24).

Considering the multi-modal effects of yoga-based interventions 
(32), this study was planned as a stepping stone toward addressing the 
hot  topic  of  burnout  among  Indian  HCPs.  Accounting  for  the 
feasibility and ease of access provided by mHealth, it was decided to 
deliver the intervention online. This study examined changes in MBI 
and PQL outcomes among HCPs before and after a 12-week mHealth-
aided yoga-based breath and meditation intervention in comparison 
to a waitlist control group.

by HCPs. Interested candidates were contacted by phone after duty 
hours and briefed in detail about the study procedures.

Adult HCPs (18–60 years of age) employed at the host institute for 
the past six months were included after confirming free accessibility 
of mobile or a laptop device with good internet connectivity. Pregnant 
females and individuals already practicing yoga, meditation or any 
other stress reduction practice were not included. Participants were 
also  excluded 
like 
musculoskeletal  disorders,  uncontrolled  hypertension,  diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.

if  reported  having  medical  conditions 

A total of 124 individuals who showed interest were assessed for 
eligibility, and 98 participants were enrolled sequentially from March 
2021 to November 2022. Figure 1 depicts the flow of events during 
enrollment (33).

2.3. Randomization

Eligible participants were randomly allocated to the Experimental 
and Control groups in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random 
implemented  using 
sequence.  Allocation  concealment  was 
sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Baseline outcomes 
were assessed after randomization.

2.4. Participants’ characteristics

A total of 62 males and 36 females were enrolled. There were 30 
males and 19 females in the experimental group, while the control 
group  had  32  males  and  17  females.  The  average  age  for  all  the 
participants was 28.26 ± 3.547 years (age range: 21 to 39 years), for the 
experimental  group  it  was  27.61 ± 3.610 years,  and  for  the  control 
group  it  was  28.90 ± 3.399 years.  Both  groups  were  comparable  at 
baseline  in  terms  of  demographic  variables  like  gender,  age  and 
job-role. See Table 1 and Figure 2 for details on the demographic 
distribution across the study population.

2.1. Study design and population

2.5. Outcome measures

This  was  a  randomized,  waitlist-controlled  trial  with  a  1:1 
allocation  ratio,  utilizing  a  simple  random  sampling  method  for 
recruiting eligible participants. The study commenced after obtaining 
due  approval  from  the  institutional  ethics  committee  (AIIMS/
IEC/20/733) and registration with the Clinical Trial Registry of India 
(CTRI/2020/11/029136).

The population for this study consisted of HCPs, including faculty 
members, resident doctors, medical students, nursing officers, and 
nursing  staff  posted  at  high  dependency  units,  critical  care  units, 
intensive care units, and emergency departments of a tertiary care 
hospital in north India.

2.5.1. Maslach burnout inventory

The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) – Human Services Survey 
for Medical Personnel (HSS-MP) (34) was used to measure Burnout. 
The tool is intended specifically for HCPs and has 22 statements based 
on subjective feelings and viewpoints. The inventory is divided into 
three subscales: the Emotional Exhaustion (EE) subscale has nine 
items, the Depersonalization (DP) subscale has five, and the Personal 
Accomplishment (PA) subscale has eight. All 22 item statements are 
based on a seven-point Likert scale, with a frequency score of zero 
being never, one being a few times a year, two being once a month or 
less, three being a few times a month, four being once a week, five 
being a few times a week, and six being every day.

2.2. Participant enrolment

2.5.2. Professional quality of life scale

Infographic  posters  containing  study  procedures  and  contact 
details of the investigators were attached to the notice boards of the 
designated areas and circulated within the social media groups shared 

The PQL scale was used for measuring levels of PQL (12). It has 
been extensively used since 1995 to assess the positive and negative 
aspects of working as a human service provider. It has 30 statements 
that are based on personal sentiments and attitudes and are equally

divided into three sub-scales. The Compassion Satisfaction subscale 
(CS) rates the positive aspects of working as a helper; the Burnout 
(BO)  subscale  assesses  work-related  hopelessness  and  feelings  of 
inefficacy;  and  the  Secondary  Trauma  (ST)  sub-scale  evaluates 
secondary exposure to extremely or traumatically stressful workplace 
events. The PQL measures the frequency of each statement on a Likert 

scale  as  follows:  one = never;  two = rarely;  three = sometimes; 
four = often; and five = very often.

automatic  blood  pressure  monitor  HEM-7120  (35),  with  the 
participant  seated  comfortably  in  chair  for  five  minutes  prior  to 
measurement. An average of three consecutive readings measured at 
intervals of five minutes was considered the final value of SBP, DBP, 
and HR. Height was measured using a stadiometer and weight using 
an  electronic  weighing  machine.  Body  Mass  Index  (BMI)  was 
calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters2 (using 
formula  BMI = kg/m2).  Waist  Circumference  (WC)  and  Hip 
Circumference (HC) were measured using a non-elastic measuring 
tape, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated by dividing WC by 
HC (using formula WHR = WC/HC).

All outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks, i.e., at 
endpoint. Observations were recorded on a case report form, and 
assessments were carried out in a safe environment in line with the 
COVID protocol for disease prevention.

2.6. Intervention details

The mHealth-aided 12-week yoga-based meditation and breath 
Intervention was implemented using an online video conferencing 
application, “Zoom Meetings” (Version: 5.7.7 (1105) (zoom.us)). The 
intervention  was  based  on  Sudarshan  Kriya,  a  comprehensive 
breathing  technique  that  involves  Ujjayi  pranayama,  Bhastrika 
pranayama, Om chanting, and rhythmic breathing, followed by resting 
in Shavasana. The entire 12-week intervention was divided into the 
following three main components:

2.6.1. Four-day orientation

Highly trained instructors from the Art of Living organization led 
the  initial  four-day  orientation  program  online.  Each  of  the  four 
sessions 
included  practical 
demonstrations to train participants. On the fourth day, participants 
received instructions for home practice.

lasted  two  hours  per  day  and 

2.6.2. Home practice

Participants performed the practice at home once a day, every six 
days a week, which lasted approximately thirty minutes per session. 

Participants  were  assisted  in  their  practice  online  during  three 
designated time slots: morning, afternoon, and evening. Participants 
were free to choose from any of the three time slots according to 
their availability.

2.6.3. Guided weekly online sessions

Participants attended weekly online group sessions, during which, 
the Yoga instructors and the investigators emphasized the importance 
of regular practice.

Regular practice reminders were sent to participants in the form 
of mobile text messages and phone calls. Participants’ attendance logs 
were  maintained  for  both  home  practice  and  weekly  sessions.  A 
minimum  of  75%  compliance  was  necessary  for  participants  to 
be eligible for the final evaluation.

2.7. Statistical methods

Continuous variables were described using means and standard 
deviations.  Counts  and  percentages  were  used  to  describe 
categorical  variables.  Continuous  variables  were  checked  for 
normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality, and 
parametric  and  non-parametric  statistical  tests  were  applied 
accordingly. An independent t test was used between two groups, 
and a paired t test was used within the same group for normally 
distributed  outcome  variables.  For  non-normally  distributed 
outcome variables, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, also known as the 
Mann–Whitney u test, was used between two groups, while the 
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used within the same group. The 
Chi-square test was used to assess compliance within groups. A p 
value of ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Effect size 
was estimated for all outcomes based on Cohen’s d using G*Power 
(Ver. 3.1.9.4) (36) and was interpreted as small (≥0.20), medium 
(≥0.50), and large (≥0.80) magnitudes (37). Post-hoc analysis of 
power was performed to check for type 2 error in primary endpoint 
outcomes between groups using OpenEpi (Version 3). All data was 
stored 
(Microsoft 
Corporation). Statistical tests were performed using “IBM-SPSS 

in  “Microsoft  Excel”

An ‘intention to treat’ analysis with a ‘last observed value carried 
forward’  approach  was  followed  to  minimize  attrition  bias.  A 
sample size of 74 participants was determined using G*Power (36) 
based on findings from a previous study (38). An attrition rate of 
20% was added to this, raising the total sample size to be 90, with 
45 participants in each group.

(p 0.282), HC (p 0.137), and WHR (p 0.172) (See Table 4).

3.2. Intragroup analysis (baseline vs. 
endpoint)

A highly significant difference (p < 0.001) was observed within 
the Experimental group for the outcomes of MBI and PQL, depicting 
a moderate effect (Cohen’s d 0.5–0.79) for EE, DP, PA, BO, and ST 
and a large effect for CS (Cohen’s d > 0.8). Within the control group, 
there was no significant difference observed for the outcomes of EE 
(p 0.51); CS (p 0.228); BO (p 0.294); and ST (p 0.533); however, DP 
(p  0.001)  increased  significantly  and  PA  (p  0.018)  reduced 
significantly (see Table 5). A significant reduction was also observed 
in  HR  within  the  experimental  group  (p < 0.001)  but  not  in  the 
control group (p 0.124). SBP (p 0.001) and DBP (p < 0.001) increased 
significantly within the control group, but no significant change was 
observed within the experimental group (SBP: p 0.289; DBP: p 0.109) 
(See Table 6).

4. Discussion

The results show that after mHealth aided 12-week yoga-based 
meditation and breath intervention, all MBI and PQL outcomes 
improved for the experimental group HCPs. Previous studies have 
investigated  the  efficacy  of  various  yoga  and  mindfulness-based 
interventions on outcomes of burnout among HCPs (38–44). They 
showed significant improvements in either one or two aspects of 
burnout  in  the  yoga,  mindfulness,  and  meditation-related 

Two studies showed improvements in EE and DP but not in PA 
(38, 41). One study showed improvements in EE alone (44). One 
study showed improvement in DP but not in EE and PA (40). In 
another  study, 
in  EE  and 
PA but not in DP (43). A triple arm study showed improvement only 
in EE for the yoga group, and in EE and PA for the meditation group 
(42). However, it used the Japanese Burnout Index, which is similar 
to MBI but adapted for the Japanese populations (42).

improvements  were  observed 

Only one study showed improvements in all three outcomes of 
MBI, i.e., EE, DP, and PA (39). However, the intervention used in this 
study was of a shorter duration, i.e., four weeks, and included Laughter 
Yoga, which is performed in a group (39).

Regarding PQL, one study showed improvements in CS and BO 
within the yoga intervention group but not when compared to the 
control group (40).

The  following  section  provides  a  closer  look  at  the  individual 
outcomes,  possible  mechanisms  behind  yoga’s  effect,  and  the 
implications of each of the outcomes for HCPs:

4.1. Emotional exhaustion

EE involves energy drain, resulting in a feeling of being stressed 
and  emotionally  overwhelmed  (34).  Our  results  suggest  that 
12 weeks  of  yoga-based  breath  and  meditation  intervention 
significantly reduced EE among HCPs. This is supported by the 
findings of other yoga-based intervention studies (38, 39, 41–44). 
This  decrease  in  EE  can  be  attributed  to  the  increase  in 
parasympathetic drive due to regular practice of yoga, which helps 
calming down the stress response systems (32).

Yoga breathing modulates the hypothalamic–pituitary axis via 
hypothalamic  and  anterior  pituitary  vagal  afferents  (45,  46).  Yoga 
practice brings about a state of calm alertness (32). Yoga also helps 
increase  the  production  of  well-being  hormones  like  prolactin, 
oxytocin, and vasopressin (45, 46). It decreases production of stress

hormones  like  cortisol  and  adrenocorticotropin  while  optimizing 
serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels (45, 46). Therefore, 
regular yoga practice might play a significant role in alleviating EE.

HCPs with high levels of EE are more likely to develop physical and 
mental health issues, further compromising patient care (1). Eventually, 
if EE is not managed, it may hinder patient care and decision-making 
(34). Our results add to the evidence that meditation and breathing 
practices can reduce both work-related exhaustion (47) and EE (48).

Yoga  based  interventions  have  also  been  found  to  reduce 
interpersonal  disengagement  (47),  cynicism  (48),  self-role 
distance  (48),  and  improve  social  connectedness  (57).  These 
improvements  can  also  be  attributed  to  a  reduction  in 
DP. Whereas, high levels of DP can result in a lack of empathy, 
detachment from work, and work-related cynicism (34) and can 
add to lower job satisfaction, increased absenteeism, negligence, 
and even medical errors (1).

4.2. Depersonalization

4.3. Personal accomplishment

The present findings align with previous studies which have also 
reported  a  notable  decrease  in  DP  after  participants  underwent  a 
yoga-based intervention. (38–41)

Yoga based practices have been shown to increase empathy (49–
51),  consciousness  quotient  (49),  mindfulness  (52–54),  enhance 
prosocial behaviors (50, 55), and increase self-compassion (50, 54, 55). 
These benefits may also result in reducing DP.

HCPs with lower levels of DP and greater empathy can recognize 
and  respond  better  to  patient  emotions  and  needs  (56).  On  the 
contrary, when HCPs have high levels of DP, it can cause them to see 
patients as objects or tasks instead of individuals in need of care (1). 
This  can  lead  to  a  decrease  in  patient-provider  trust  and  rapport, 
ultimately compromising the delivery of healthcare (34).

PA involves a sense of making an impact on one’s work and 
the people around them (34). In the current study, PA increased 
significantly for the yoga based intervention group, which is in 
line with the past findings (39, 42, 43). Literature also suggests 
that  meditation  and  breathing  practices  increase  professional 
fulfillment 
(48),  and  have 
been  associated  with  an  increase  in  life  satisfaction  and  self-
esteem (58).

(47),  professional  efficacy 

Yoga based practices have been shown to increase overall brain 
wave  activity,  increase  gray  matter,  and  enhance  amygdala  and 
prefrontal  cortex  activation  (59).  This  increases  interhemispheric 
brainwave synchronization, improves memory, attention, emotional 
control, and cognitive state (60).

Furthermore, yoga practice positively affects autonomic tone (61–
63), improves heart rate variability (64), and enhances sleep parameters 
(64, 65), all of which are crucial for work-related productivity. Thus, 
regular  yoga  practices  can  help  HCPs  be  more  productive  in  their 
workplace and help achieve a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

When  HCPs  feel  satisfied,  it  improves  the  quality  of  care  they 
provide (34). This in turn improves organizational culture, increases job 
satisfaction, and reduces employee turnover (1, 6). On the other hand, 
low PA might cause HCPs to lose motivation (1), further hampering 
productivity, job satisfaction, and diminish patient care (1).

4.4. Compassion satisfaction

hyperarousal (72), thus enabling practitioners to achieve a state of 
calm and restfulness (55).

CS is about the pleasure one derives from being able to do one’s 
work well (12). Our study adds to past findings showing improvements 
in CS (40). Literature also suggests that yoga-based interventions can 
enhance professional fulfillment through self-worth, satisfaction, and 
a sense of contribution (47).

HCPs tend to face ST on a more regular basis in comparison to 
other occupational professionals (40). If unhandled, ST may cause 
fear, intrusive images and sleep problems (1). ST can impair an HCP’s 
well-being, increase their risk of mental health disorders, and reduce 
their ability to provide empathetic and effective care (1).

High levels of CS can make HCPs feel happier and more fulfilled 
with their work (12). This results in job satisfaction, motivation, better 
engagement, productivity, and quality care (40). Whereas, low CS can 
leave HCPs feeling exhausted, unfulfilled, and disconnected from their 
positive  work  (13).  It  adversely  affects  job  satisfaction,  care,  and 
motivation (13). Eventually, HCPs may lose purpose and meaning in 
their work, decreasing their commitment and increasing turnover (1).

4.5. Burnout

BO is one of the two prime components of compassion fatigue 
(12).  BO  is  generally  associated  with  a  high  workload  and  a 
non-supportive environment (40). The present results are in line with 
previous findings suggesting that yoga-based interventions can help 
improve  BO  (40,  57)  Yoga  also  improves  parameters  of  sleep,  life 
satisfaction, and resilience (65), all three of which are inversely related 
to Burnout.

Yoga improves emotional awareness, which increases resilience by 
enhancing self-awareness and empathy for others (66). Yoga-based 
practices help increase interoception (67) and develop emotional self-
regulation and awareness. Their regular practice improves selective 
intentional attention and helps develop a non-judgmental attitude 
toward one’s own experiences (65). This insight helps combat negative 
self-perceptions and help reduce self-criticism, negative reappraisal, 
emotional reactivity, and rumination (65) which play a crucial role in 
overcoming BO.

Since BO causes a gradual onset of hopelessness and a decline in 
job performance, it gets reflected by self-criticism and a feeling of lack 
of efficacy (12). Thus, yoga-based interventions might help HCPs to 
be  self-aware  and  avoid  self  criticism.  Simultaneously,  it  can  help 
enhance  their  psychological  resilience  and  enable  them  to  better 
manage  workload,  even  in  challenging  circumstances  like  viral 
outbreaks (65, 68).

4.6. Secondary trauma

ST refers to the second component of compassion fatigue and 
involves secondary exposure to traumatic experiences at work (12). 
Our results of a significant reduction in ST for the experimental group 
are novel when compared to past studies (40).

Evidence  suggests  Meditation  and  yoga  breathing  practices  as 
effective tools in reducing anxiety and post-traumatic stress (68–70). 
Patients  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  benefit  from 
yoga-based practices in terms of emotional and physical resilience, 
stress, and energy (71–78). Yoga helps reduce PTSD symptoms by 
reducing stress-induced allostatic load and increases parasympathetic 
activity, leading to a decrease in physiological arousal (71).

Considering  yoga’s  beneficial  effects  on  psychological  trauma, 
HCPs can benefit from yoga-based practices to overcome the negative 
effects  of  working  as  a  caregiver,  thereby  preventing  compassion 
fatigue and protecting one’s mental health.

4.7. Other findings

Our  study  showed  a  significant  reduction  in  HR  within  the 
meditation and yoga breathing group. This is a common finding for 
yoga  based  interventional  studies  (32,  45,  46,  64).  Since  all  the 
participants  were  healthy  adults,  anthropometrics  did  not  vary 
significantly post-intervention. However, a significant change in DP, 
PA, SBP, and DBP was observed within the waitlist-control group 
participants.  These  could  be  due  to  the  stressful  and  demanding 
nature of participants’ jobs (1, 4, 5, 9–11, 79), as DP and PA are both 
components of Burnout, while stress is identified as a significant risk 
factor for increase in BP.

4.8. Strengths, limitations, and future 
directions

Yoga-based research studies suffer from shorter interventions and 
low  compliance  rates.  This  impacts  the  treatment  effect  of  yoga, 
ultimately  diminishing  the  overall  evidence  on  yoga’s  efficacy. 
However,  our  study  used  a  longer  intervention  of  12-weeks,  in 
comparison to past studies which ranged from four to eight weeks of 
intervention (38–44).

Longer interventions are associated with greater improvements in 
outcomes of psychological well-being and behavioral functions (80). 
This might be the reason for a greater effect on outcomes of our study, 
when compared to past research (38–44).

The mHealth-aided intervention allowed HCPs to choose their 
preferred time and space for practice, enabling them to incorporate it 
into  their  busy  schedules.  Further  research  can  help  establish  the 
treatment fidelity of mHealth-aided yoga-based interventions.

Our  study  utilized  a  unique  and  thoroughly-researched  yoga-
based technique called Sudarshan Kriya (32, 45–47, 61–63, 70, 75). It 
follows a specific sequence of procedures that can be taught by trained 
individuals and implemented at home using simple and easy to follow 
instructions, therefore, making it suitable for prescription purposes. 
Since this was an online based intervention, the long-term effects of 
offline or in-person Sudarshan kriya practice also need to be explored 
in the context of Burnout and PQL.

Our study lacked blinding among the two groups and an active 
intervention  for  the  comparator  group.  Future  research  can 
be  strengthened  by  implementing  blinding  of  participants  and 
employing an active or sham intervention for the control group.

Additionally, yoga reduces physical tension, increasing relaxation, 
attenuating  automatic  thoughts  and  behaviors  associated  with 

Researchers are also encouraged to utilize objective psychological, 
physiological, neurological, endocrine, and immunological outcome

measures for deriving possible correlations with the domains of MBI 
and PQL. Further research is warranted to generalize our findings.

5. Conclusion

The mHealth aided intervention showed a strong effect during 
intergroup comparisons and a moderate effect during within-group 
comparisons. The present evidence supports the use of Sudarshan 
Kriya  Yoga  for  managing  stress  and  building  resilience  among 
healthcare providers. It yielded significant improvements in outcomes 
of  burnout  and  professional  quality  of  life  after  12 weeks.  Current 
findings  underscore  the  significance  of  integrating  accessible  and 
technology-enhanced yoga-based practices into the daily routines of 
healthcare professionals. Such integration can offer promising avenues 
toward a more sustainable and fulfilling healthcare ecosystem for both 
providers and patients alike. Further research in diverse healthcare 
settings and populations will undoubtedly refine and expand upon 
these promising outcomes, propelling us toward a brighter and more 
resilient future for healthcare providers worldwide.
