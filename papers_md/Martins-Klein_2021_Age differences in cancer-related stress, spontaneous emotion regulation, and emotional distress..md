Abstract

Objectives: Cancer risk increases with age, cancer-related stress is common and devastating to 
mental health of patients, yet little work has explored age differences in cancer-related stress. This 
study investigated sources of stress related to cancer diagnosis and treatment and its association 
with age and emotional health. Though not an a priori aim of the study, adaptive strategies 
mentioned within discussions of stress—which we classify as spontaneous emotion regulation 
(ER) — were also investigated.

Method: Participants (N = 147, aged 27–88) recruited from the VA (98% male) with oral-
digestive cancers participated in semi-structured interviews regarding sources of stress 6-months 
post-diagnosis (T1) and treatment-related stress at 12-months post-diagnosis (T2). Patients also 
reported their emotional distress at T2 via the PROMIS-29. Inductive content analysis was used to 
classify sources of stress and ER into semantic themes and relative frequencies.

Results: The greatest source of stress at diagnosis was psychological; physical symptoms were 
the greatest source of stress at treatment. Older adults less frequently reported psychological 
uncertainty, social stress, and situational stress, whereas age groups reported similar rates of 
physical stress. When describing stress, older adults more often made spontaneous references to 
emotion regulation (ER). Across age groups, those who reported stress without ER in qualitative 
comments had higher emotional distress on the PROMIS-29 than those reporting stress with ER or 
no stress.

Introduction

Cancer-related stress

Psychosocial stress is common following the diagnosis of and treatment for cancer. about 
one-third of cancer patients will develop a mental health condition (Grassi, Caruso, Sabato, 
Massarenti, & Nanni, 2014), which can persist after cancer treatment (Bamonti, Moye, & 
Naik, 2018; Deshields, Tibbs, Fan, & Taylor, 2006; Stommel, Kurtz, Kurtz, Given, & Given, 
2004). Psychological comorbidity in cancer is associated with maladaptive coping, reduced 
quality of life, disability, suicide risk, and mortality (Satin, Linden, & Phillips, 2009; Leung 
et al., 2013; Teo, Fingeret, Liu, & Chang, 2016; Meggiolaro, Berardi, & Andritsch, 2016; 
Kroenke et al., 2010).

Recognizing the impact of distress on cancer outcomes, since 2007, the Commission on 
Cancer (CoC) (a cancer program accreditation body in the United States) mandates that 
cancer patients be screened for psychosocial distress at least once during a pivotal visit 
(Commission on Cancer, 2016). The goal of this distress screening is to ensure that proper 
referrals are made in a concerted effort to provide patient-centered care. Distress screening 
implementation may promote improved quality of life and enhanced clinician-patient 
communication, when identified problems are addressed (Breitbart et al., 2015; Hilarius, 
Kloeg, Gundy, & Aaronson, 2008; Watson et al., 2016).

The CoC highlights a preference for standardized, validated tools, but ultimately, the distress 
screening tool is at the discretion of each clinic. The National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) recommends using the Distress Thermometer (DT), on which patients rate 
their distress level from 0 to 10 (NCCN, 2003). An optional 39-item problem checklist 
highlights distress sources across practical, family, emotional, spiritual/religious, and 
physical categories (Wagner, Spiegel, & Pearman, 2013). Numerous reports detail strategies 
and obstacles for implementation of distress screening in general (Bultz et al., 2011; Zebrack 
et al., 2015; Smith, Loscalzo, Mayer, & Rosenstein, 2018; Knies et al., 2018), although there 
are no published studies related to development and validation of the checklist to our 
knowledge.

The ambiguity of current cancer screening procedures leaves it unclear whether stress 
(e.g.what is stressful), distress (e.g.symptoms of depression), and/or sources of distress 
(e.g.financial difficulties due to sick leave) should be the focus of clinical assessments. A 
key starting point in clarifying these distinctions is the patient’s voice (Salmon, Clark, 
McGrath, & Fisher, 2015). While numerous qualitative studies have examined cancer 
survivors’ experiences broadly speaking, few categorize specific sources of stress from a

qualitative perspective, as they evolve from diagnosis to treatment, aligning with the CoC’s 
recommendation that sources of stress be tracked at pivotal visits.

Aging and cancer-related stress

Understanding sources of stress across the diagnosis and treatment experience is especially 
important for older adults because cancer prevalence increases significantly across the 
lifespan. Importantly, two-thirds of those diagnosed with cancer are older adults (Mosher & 
Danoff-Burg, 2006; Siegel, Miller, & Jemal, 2017). Older adults with cancer face different 
survivorship issues in the context of increased comorbidities and require care approaches 
tailored to these needs (Coughlin, Paxton, Moore, Stewart, & Anglin, 2019; Guerard et al., 
2016; Williams et al., 2016). More generally, lifespan developmental research points to the 
importance of changes in sources of stress with age (Yancura & Aldwin, 2008). Thus, 
studies that consider the impact of cancer and its treatment from patient’s perspective within 
a lifespan developmental lens, particularly age differences in sources of stress and their 
relationship to emotional health, (Mohile et al., 2016; Sedrak & Hurria, 2018) are needed.

Adaptation to cancer-related stress

Recalling cancer-related stressors may induce a need to manage emotions. Indeed, 
recollection of past experiences has been shown to induce mood states similar to those 
experienced during the original event (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991). 
Furthermore, when asked to recall two personal memories, individuals often recall a positive 
second memory, and highlight mood repair as their primary motivation for doing so 
(Josephson, 1996).

Both coping and emotion regulation literatures highlight that appraisal of stress or undesired 
emotion is the first step in both processes. Coping may be described as a three-stage process 
involving the identification of a stressor, assessment of one’s ability to cope with the 
stressor, and employment of problem-focused and/or emotion-focused strategies to decrease 
stress as necessary (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). In contrast, emotion regulation (ER) is an 
iterative process of momentarily monitoring, assessing, and managing one’s relatively 
transitory affective state (Gross, 2014).

Older adults compared to younger adults more frequently use secondary coping strategies, 
such as asking others for help, enhancing motivation, and adjusting goals, which benefits 
them in the context of health decline (Hall, Chipperfield, Heckhausen, & Perry, 2010; 
Heckhausen, Wrosch, & Schulz, 2010). Compared to younger adults, older adults experience 
less negative affect in response to situations characterized by lack of perceived control, 
although this has not been explicitly examined with cancer as a source of stress (Diehl & 
Hay, 2010). The ER literature suggests that when faced with transitory affective states, older 
adults use pro-hedonic ER strategies by focusing more on the positive aspects of situations 
in order to enhance their present emotional experience (Isaacowitz, Toner, Goren, & Wilson, 
2008; Livingstone & Isaacowitz, 2015; Mather, 2012). Furthermore, older adults are more 
likely to use passive ER strategies, such as acceptance, and less likely to engage in 
maladaptive strategies than younger adults (Schirda, Valentine, Aldao, & Prakash, 2016).

stress impacts emotional and physical health outcomes (DeSteno, Gross, & Kubzansky, 
2013). However, research examining age differences in use of adaptive strategies in the 
context of cancer related stress is limited.

Aims of this manuscript

In this paper we employ a mixed methods approach to (1) describe sources of stress from the 
patient’s perspective, considering both diagnostic and treatment stressors, and; (2) examine 
age related differences in reported stressors. Further, though not an a priori goal of this 
investigation, our qualitative analyses revealed participants modified their descriptions of 
stress with adaptive statements. We were unsure if these comments reflected coping or ER. 
Because they arose in the context of our face-to-face queries about what was “most 
stressful,” we posit these may be attempts to manage transitory affective states induced by 
our prompt, which we attribute to ER. Thus, our third aim is to (3) describe the content of 
these adaptive strategies, also examining age differences in reported strategies. Finally, (4) 
we examine the relationship between stress, adaptation, and emotional health (symptoms of 
depression and anxiety). In the Discussion we return to consider these findings in the context 
of the gerontological literature and theoretical frameworks of stress and adaptation in aging.

Methods

Recruitment

Participants

Participants with diagnoses of head and neck, gastro-esophageal, or colorectal cancer were 
recruited from VA Medical Centers at Boston, MA and Houston, TX tumor registries for a 
prospective longitudinal study. These cancer types were selected on the basis of shared risk 
factors and potential side effects (e.g.gastrointestinal symptoms). Additional inclusion 
criteria included: being 6 months post-diagnosis, age 18 years or older, having ability to read 
and speak English, not in hospice care, and no evidence of psychotic disorder or dementia. 
As described elsewhere, 170 of 416 eligible participants agreed to be interviewed (Naik et 
al., 2013).

There were 144 men and 3 women, age 27–88 (M = 64.75, SD = 9.73). The majority of 
participants were White or Caucasian (80.3%) and the remainder were African American 
(16.3%) and other races/ethnicities (3.4%). About half (51.7%) had some college education 
or were college graduates. Participants had head and neck cancers (38.1%), eso-gastric 
cancers (9.5%), or colo-rectal cancers (52.4%), of American Joint Committee on Cancer 
Stage I (25.9%), II (28.6%), III (21.8%) or IV (23.8%); 73.5% received surgery whereas 
59.9% received chemotherapy and 40.8% received radiation (treatments were not mutually 
exclusive). This paper describes responses for 147 participants with complete data at Time 1 
(6-months post diagnosis) and 2 (12 months post-diagnosis). There were 78 participants 
under the age of 65 (M = 57.79, SD = 6.12, range = 27–64) and 69 participants 65 years of 
age or older (M = 72.61, SD = 6.55, range 65–88).

Procedure

Measures

Page 5

Participants completed a face to face individual interview in which the interviewer read each 
question to the participant and recorded the participant’s responses. Interviews were 
conducted at a location convenient for the participant, such the local VA medical center or 
the patient’s home. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the 
Boston, MA and Houston, TX VA Healthcare Systems.

Cancer information—Information about the cancer diagnosis, including cancer organ site 
and stage, was obtained from the participants’ medical records. Participants reported if they 
received surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation and the date of their last treatment, which 
were verified in the medical record.

Cancer related stress—At six months post-diagnosis (“T1”), individuals were asked “I 
would like to know the story of your diagnosis. What I mean is, what caused you to be 
evaluated? How did you learn of the diagnosis?” Additional standardized prompts were used 
for clarification. Then, the interviewer asked, “What was most stressful about the diagnostic 
experience?” Responses were recorded verbatim. The interviewer did not restrict the 
participant’s response by length or content. Some respondents named more than one thing 
that was stressful. Some respondents described things outside of the diagnostic experience 
that were “most stressful.” At 12-months post-diagnosis (“T2”), individuals were asked 
“What is happening with your cancer now?” Participants were then asked, “When we talked 
last, we asked you what was most stressful about your diagnosis. Looking back at your 
cancer treatment, what was most stressful?”

Emotional health—The 29-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS v 1.0) (Cella et al., 2010; Craig et al., 2014) “static version” (all 
participants answer all items) was used to measure emotional health. We used 4 items 
measuring depressive symptoms and 4 items measuring anxiety symptoms which are 
identified as representing “emotional health”. We created a total emotional health score 
following the method of Spritzer and Hays (2018), by converting raw scores to T scores 
using the manual, then converting these to z scores, and next averaging the two scores to 
create an emotional health score (Spritzer & Hays, 2018).

Statistical analyses

Qualitative analyses—We used inductive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) in 
which codes were identified and named based on their semantic content. Consistent with 
concept of reflexivity (Finlay, 2002) we acknowledge the influence of the researchers on the 
coding. Three members of the research team are trained as geropsychologists broadly 
focused on stress and adaptation to illness in older adults. Two members of the research 
team have done research in emotional regulation. As such, our data analytic approach is 
informed by a lifespan developmental framework, our experience providing psychotherapy 
to older adults adjusting to medical illnesses, and our research experiences.Responses were 
coded in batches of 10 by three members of the research team (BM-K, PB, JM) with discrete 
codes attached to clauses, allowing for multiple codes to be assigned to a response. Coding

discrepancies were resolved through team consensus, adjusting code names and definitions 
within a coding manual until agreement across team members > 90% was obtained (average 
agreement = 97.1% using the final code book). Subsequently, after coding 50 participants, 
each team member coded a portion of remaining responses using the final code book, with 
continued discussion of any statements that did not readily map to the coding manual. Next, 
to confirm the reliability the team repeated the process for the first 50 statements. Once this 
process was completed, frequencies were calculated for each code assigned. Codes with 
counts of less than five were collapsed and combined with other codes based on team 
discussion. Finally, codes were grouped into themes. The results section provides exemplar 
responses with minor editing changes to enhance readability, with subject numbers provided.

Quantitative analyses—Descriptive statistics were calculated to represent the frequency 
of themes. We then examined differences in the proportion of themes which emerged on the 
basis of type of stress (diagnosis versus treatment) and age (younger < 65 versus older ≥ 65) 
using chi-square analyses. Finally, we used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
controlling for age to examine emotional health as measured by PROMIS among three 
groups: those describing stress without ER, those with stress and ER, those describing no 
stress.

Results

Perceived sources of stress

Perceived stress occurred in four thematic areas: psychological, physical, social, and 
situational. These themes with codes and exemplar responses appear in Table 1, while Figure 
1 visualizes differences by age group, with relevant chi-square comparisons in Table 2.

Psychological stress—Almost two-thirds (65%) referred to psychological stress across 
time points, for which we identified three sub-themes: negative emotions, difficulty 
accepting, and lack of certainty (Table 1). First, some (17% at either time period) cited their 
own negative emotions as a source of stress, equivalent across time periods and age groups. 
In addition, some (32%) cited the difficulty accepting the diagnosis, such as stress related to 
the seriousness and difficulty accepting the diagnosis, also equivalent in frequency across 
time and age. A third category of psychological stress was lack of certainty, (37%), such as 
difficulty determining diagnosis or treatment, uncertainty of outcome, or having to wait. 
This was more often described at the diagnostic period, and more frequently reported by 
younger adults.

Physical stress—More than half (54%) referred to physical stressors at either time point 
in five categories: fatigue/weakness, pain/discomfort, gastrointestinal distress, loss or change 
in function, and other areas (Table 1). Physical stressors were equally reported by younger 
and older adults, but became more prevalent in the treatment period (Table 2).

Social stress—In the overall sample, 23% reported social stress at either time period in 
three categories: concern about others, lack of social support, and problems or stress related 
to the healthcare system (Table 1). Social stress was more frequently reported at diagnosis 
than treatment and more frequently reported by younger adults than older adults (Table 2).

Situational stress—In the overall sample, 17% reported situational stressors at either 
time point in three categories: poor timing, financial stressors, transportation problems, as 
described in Table 2. Situational stressors were more frequently reported by younger versus 
older adults, but were equally reported across time periods (Table 2).

No stress—In the overall sample, 37% explicitly said nothing was stressful at either the 
diagnostic or treatment period, and 10% of participants said this at both time periods. 
Participants were more likely to report no stress at the diagnostic period; fewer said so in 
reference to treatment with no statistically significant differences across age groups (Table 
2).

Emotion regulation

More than half the sample (59.2%) provided “regulatory” statements alongside their reports 
of stress. Such ER occurred most often with statements of physical stressors (61.3%), 
followed by social stressors (55.9%), situational stressors (48.0%), and psychological 
stressors (44.2%). Table 3 provides exemplar statements of each of these sources of ER. 
Figure 2 visualizes differences by age group with relevant chi-square comparisons in Table 
4.

Cognitive—We delineated five subcategories of what we labeled cognitive ER: acceptance 
(i.e.included words like “ accepted”), self-determination (i.e.an explicit “ I” statement 
revealing self-control or ability), autobiographical referencing (i.e.a reference to an event in 
past), positive appraisal, and process reappraisal, as shown in Table 3. Positive appraisal 
refers to a positive assessment of a difficult situation, whereas process reappraisal refers to a 
change or conversion from negative to positive appraisal. Cognitive strategies were cited 
more frequently by older adults (49%) than by younger adults (27%) (Table 4).

Social—About one-fifth (21.8%) of participants referred to social support in ameliorating 
stress, which was equivalent across age groups (Table 4). Statements referenced support 
from family and friends, as well as the support of their healthcare team.

Behavioral—A subgroup (12.2%) referred to what appeared to be more active or 
behavioral approaches in responding to perceived stress (Table 3). Older adults were more 
likely than younger adults to reference this when reporting sources of perceived stress (Table 
4).

Religious—A subgroup (6.1%) of participants referenced religious beliefs in counterpoint 
to perceived stress (Table 3) related to diagnosis or treatment, with no differences in age 
groups (Table 4).

In sum, combining across all strategies, older adults were more likely than younger adults to 
counter statements of perceived stress with ER (Table 4).

Association of stress, emotion regulation, and emotional distress

We classified the sample into three ER groups, those who, in response to questions about 
what was most stressful: (1) described stressors without ER (n = 56), (2) individuals who

described stressors and employed ER (n = 76), and (3) individuals who said there was 
nothing stressful at both time periods (n = 15). Results of the ANCOVA comparing mean 
emotional health score (on PROMIS) by ER group, controlling for age, found a main effect 
for the overall model, (F(2, 146) = 12.24, p<.001), with significant effects for age (F(1, 146) 
= 17.49, p<.001), and ER group (F(2, 146) = 4.28, p=.02). In post-hoc analyses with 
Bonferroni correction, those reporting stressors but no ER had the highest emotional distress 
scores (n = 56; M z score=.09, SD=.86), which was significantly higher than those reporting 
no stressors (n = 15; M z score=−.87, SD=.17; mean difference p<.01), and those reporting 
stressors with ER (n = 76; M z score=−.27, SD=.87; mean difference p<.05). Additionally, 
Post-hoc t-tests with Bonferroni correction revealed that the group reporting stressors with 
ER group was significantly older (M = 65.88, SD = 8.81) than the group reporting stressors 
without ER (M = 61.52, SD = 10.13; p=.03). The group reporting no stressors was also 
significantly older (M = 71.07, SD = 8.78) than the group reporting stressors without ER 
group (p<.01).

Discussion

The main findings of this study span four areas. First, we offer a rich description of patients’ 
greatest sources of stress – using each patient’s subjective experience – and provide thematic 
categories to guide interpretation. Second, we similarly describe spontaneous ER – which 
was not predicted but emerged from our data. Third, we report differences in sources of 
stress and ER by time period of inquiry and by age. Finally, we report relationships between 
stress, ER, and emotional health.

Our results provide exploration of the lived experience of cancer-related stress, emphasizing 
the ways in which physical and psychological stress manifest in the first year following 
cancer diagnosis. Psychological factors were most frequently reported as most stressful 
related to diagnosis (6 months) characterized by uncertainty, negative emotions, and 
difficulty accepting cancer, while both psychological and physical factors, including pain, 
nausea and fatigue, were most stressful related to treatment (12-month follow-up). These 
findings, based on an open-ended interview, are broadly consistent with studies using 
standardized survey methods, which demonstrate cancer survivors confront psychological, 
physical, social, and situational stressors during and after treatment (Raphael, Frey, & Gott, 
2017; Valdivieso, Kujawa, Jones, & Baker, 2012). In some categories there were differences 
in what sources of stress were “most stressful” at treatment and diagnosis, supporting the 
need for re-assessment of stress at more than one “pivotal visit”.

In terms of age differences, we found that younger adults reported social and situational 
stressors more than older adults, perhaps because younger adults are more likely to work 
full-time and be in the process of raising families (Blank & Bellizzi, 2008). In addition, 
younger adults were more likely to describe uncertainty as a source of stress and less likely 
to describe “no stressors” in response to cancer diagnosis and treatment than older adults. 
While our data cannot pinpoint the exact source of this age difference, it may be that as 
cancer becomes more prevalent in later life, diagnosis is more common, less unexpected, 
and less stressful in nature than it is for younger people (Neugarten & Datan, 1973). In 
addition, cumulative exposure to health-related stressors and life experience over time may

promote positive adaptation through the lifespan. Indeed, older adults who focus more on 
positive emotions are found to have greater trajectories of recovery from adversity and stress 
(Ong, Bergeman, & Boker, 2009); and the capacity to reframe stressors as challenges when 
reflecting on the past is key to later-life resilience (Randall, 2013).

Older adults may benefit from engaging in ER strategies, effectively dampening the negative 
impact of recalling stressors related to cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we did 
not ask about coping directly. However, when we asked about what was most stressful, older 
adults spontaneously used what we labeled ER strategies more frequently than did younger 
adults, in both cognitive and behavioral categories. These findings are consistent with 
previous research on ER, health, and aging. ER and health outcomes bi-directionally 
influence one another, as sustaining positive emotion and regulating negative emotions can 
not only enhance in-the-moment well-being, but also to promote engagement in behaviors 
that support long-term health (DeSteno et al., 2013). As life is viewed as more finite, older 
adults focus increasingly more on maximizing present moment affect via ER (Carstensen, 
Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999; Mather, 2012). For instance, when in negative moods, older 
adults automatically direct their attention towards focus on positive information in order to 
enhance their emotional experience (Isaacowitz et al., 2008). This shift in regulation may be 
heightened by stressful events such as discussing stressors encountered during cancer 
diagnosis and treatment. Reflective of the current findings, perceived stress predicts global 
life satisfaction in younger adults, while perceived efficacy of coping is most predictive for 
older adults’ life satisfaction (Hamarat et al., 2001). Clinical discussion of cancer-related 
stress may benefit from capitalizing on older adults’ tendency to engage in pro-hedonic 
coping. Engaging in strengths-based reflection statements, such as highlighting a patient’s 
instrumental and coping resources, may promote mood repair during appointments in which 
sources of physical and psychological stress are assessed.

We also found those who reported stressors with ER had lower of anxiety and depression 
symptoms relative to those who did not employ ER. Maintained engagement in 
biopsychosocial domains across the cancer trajectory may involve both behavioral and 
cognitive strategies. Stress may be behaviorally regulated by older adults via selective 
engagement in daily activities and contexts that minimize negative distress (Horgas, Wilms, 
& Baltes, 1998). In addition, older adults may cognitively manage stress more than younger 
people, given a stronger focus on emotional goals and optimizing affect in later-life (Mather, 
2012). Previous work suggests that individuals consciously recall positive memories as a 
manner of managing transitory mood states (Josephson, 1996). Thus, when asked to review 
negative experiences related to cancer (i.e. stress), older adults may opt to engage in positive 
autobiographical reflection to improve mood in a pro-hedonic manner, and engagement in 
spontaneous ER may help promote long-term emotional outcomes. Indeed, the capacity to 
engage with and reflect on negative experiences facilitated by in-the-moment ER, is adaptive 
given the high costs to health and well-being of avoiding consideration of health information 
on the basis of maximizing hedonic experience (Lockenhoff & Carstensen, 2004).

Limitations and future directions

A major limitation of this studyis that we did not directly measure coping or ER. Thus, we 
cannot differentiate whether the adaptive strategies participants referenced coping, ER, or 
neither. Future research should aim to contrast these possibilities, by explicitly asking 
patients about their use of coping and regulation strategies via validated questionnaires 
(Brandão, Tavares, Schulz, & Matos, 2016). In addition, patients had differing diagnoses of 
cancer which may have introduced greater heterogeneity into our findings. Due to limited 
sample size, we were unable to contrast our findings across cancer type, stage, and specific 
treatments received. Future studies with larger samples should investigate whether more 
aggressive cancer and treatments are associated with differing perceived sources of stress 
and ER. Finally, a limitation of our study is the heterogeneity in military experience of our 
Veterans, who vary in terms of combat experience. Some participants may have increased 
resilience in the face of previous adversity and some degree of post-traumatic growth related 
to these challenges in the past, which has been shown to moderate depressive outcomes 
(Morrill et al., 2008). Adaption to cancer is particularly salient for the aging generation of 
Vietnam Veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and face an increased risk of 
presumptive Agent Orange-related cancers (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2019). In 
addition, focus on Veterans may limit the generalizability of our findings, particularly to 
older females, as our Veteran sample is predominantly male. Nonetheless, the current study 
reflects an addition to the stress and cancer literature, which has predominantly focused on 
breast cancer populations, who are majority female.

This study highlights significant age differences not only in the perception of stress related 
to cancer, but also in adaptive strategies. As previously discussed, an aim of the 2007 
Commission on Cancer (CoC) is for patients to be screened for distress during important 
cancer-related visits, such as those following diagnosis and initiation of treatment. These 
findings support the importance of distress screening at pivotal visits across diagnosis and 
treatment, allowing for a wide range of sources of stress, and considering age differences. 
Furthermore, group or peer-to-peer interventions may consider the mixing/matching younger 
to older adults, so that younger adults might learn from the strategies used by older adults 
when confronting cancer-related stress. While asking patients to rate distress on a 
thermometer is a step in the right direction, understanding the specific sources of stress and 
changes from the patient’s baseline lifestyle may target specific referrals to promote 
resilience.
