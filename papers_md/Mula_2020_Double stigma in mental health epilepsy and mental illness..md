Double stigma in mental health: epilepsy
and mental illness

Marco Mula and Kenneth R. Kaufman

Background
Epilepsy and mental illness share similar problems in terms of
stigma, as a result of centuries of superstition, ignorance and
misbeliefs. Stigma leads not only to discrimination and civil and
human rights violations but also to poor access to healthcare and
non-adherence or decreased adherence to treatment, ultimately
increasing morbidity and mortality. Despite continuous efforts in
fighting stigma in these conditions, there is very limited knowl-
edge on the phenomenon of double stigma, meaning the impact
of having two stigmatised conditions at the same time.

Aims

To discuss double stigma in mental health with special reference
to epilepsy.

Method
Articles were identified through searches in PubMed up to 31
October 2019 using the search terms ‘epilepsy’, ‘psychiatric
disorders’, ‘stigma’ and additional material was identified from
the authors’ own files and from chosen bibliographies.

Results

Double stigma is gaining attention for other stigmatised medical
conditions, such as HIV, however, the literature on epilepsy is
almost non-existent and this is quite astonishing given that one
in three people with epilepsy have a lifetime diagnosis of a

psychiatric condition. Felt (perceived) stigma and psychiatric
disorders, particularly depression, create a vicious circle in epi-
lepsy maintaining both, as depression correlates with stigma and
vice versa as well as epilepsy and depression serving as bidir-
ectional risk factors. This phenomenon has no geographical and
economic boundaries as similar data have been reported for
low-income and high-income countries.

Conclusions
Governments and policymakers as well as health services,
patients’ organisations, families and the general public need to
be aware of the phenomenon of double stigma in order to
develop campaigns and interventions tailored for these patients.

Keywords

Epilepsy; stigma; double stigma; depression; psychiatric
disorders.

Background

Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting approximately
50 million people worldwide.1,2 In high-income countries, incidence
rates range between 40 and 70/100 000 persons/year, with higher
rates among children and elderly people.3 Incidence rates are much
higher in resource-poor countries, being above 120/100 000/year,
but even in high-income countries, poor people seem to have a
higher incidence.4,5 According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), epilepsy accounts for about 0.5% of the global burden of
all diseases with total annual costs, in Europe in 2004, of approxi-
mately 15.5 billion Euros.6

is characterised by different components,

People with epilepsy are among the most vulnerable in our society
because epilepsy is a hidden disability and remains today a highly stig-
matised condition because of ignorance and superstition caused by
centuries of misconceptions towards this disorder.7 Social stigma is
a key aspect of chronic illnesses and negatively affects quality of life.
It
including enacted
stigma (external behaviours and discrimination) and felt (perceived)
stigma (shame and expectation of discrimination).8,9 Stigma leads
not only to discrimination and civil and human rights violations
but also to poor access to healthcare and decreased adherence to treat-
ment, ultimately increasing morbidity and mortality. Mental illness
shares with epilepsy exactly the same issues because of centuries of
misbeliefs, ignorance and superstition about mental health problems
with similar consequences in terms of discrimination, violation of
human rights and poor access to health resources.

Double stigma

known as double stigma and it is now getting attention for psychi-
atric disorders in other stigmatised medical conditions such as, for
example, HIV, tuberculosis or obesity.10 However, there is still very
limited attention to the problem of double stigma in people with
mental health issues and epilepsy. In this narrative review, we
aimed at discussing the issue of double stigma in mental health
with special reference to epilepsy.

Method

Articles were identified through searches in PubMed up to 31
October 2019 using the search terms ‘epilepsy’, ‘psychiatric disor-
ders’, ‘stigma’. No language restrictions were applied. This search
generated 111 abstracts. Articles were selected based on originality
and relevance to the present topic. Additional articles were identi-
fied from the authors’ own files and from chosen bibliographies.

Results

How frequent are mental health problems in epilepsy?

Mental health problems are not uncommon in epilepsy. Data from
cross-sectional epidemiological studies show that one in three
people with epilepsy have a lifetime history of a psychiatric disorder
and all major psychiatric disorders show prevalence rates in people
with epilepsy higher than those reported in the general popula-
tion.11 Furthermore, it is now established that there is a bidirectional
relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric disorders.12

What happens when two highly stigmatised conditions sensitive to
cultural themes occur in the same individual? This phenomenon is

In adults, a meta-analysis of 14 population-based studies
showed an overall prevalence of active depression in epilepsy of

23.1% (95% CI 20.6–28.3%) with an increased overall risk of 2.77
(95% CI 2.09–3.67) compared with the general population.13
These estimates, however, vary considerably across studies depend-
ing on the ascertainment source (i.e. self-report versus screening
interviews), countries, regions
tools versus structured clinical
and settings. A meta-analysis on anxiety disorders in over 3000
people with epilepsy showed a pooled prevalence of 20.2% (95%
CI 15.3–26.0) with generalised anxiety disorder being most
common (10.2%; 95% CI 7.7–13.5%).14 A meta-analysis of 58
studies of psychosis and related disorders showed a pooled preva-
lence of 5.6% (95% CI 4.8–6.4%) in unselected samples increasing
to 7% (95% CI 4.9–9.1%) in people with temporal lobe epilepsy,
with a pooled odds ratio for risk of psychosis compared with the
general population of 7.8 (95% CI 2.8–21.8).15 Data from epilepsy
surgery samples suggest an even higher prevalence.16 Still, studies
in selected samples of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy have
shown prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders up to 60%.17

A population-based study in 85 children and adolescents (aged
5–15) with active epilepsy in West Sussex in the UK reported a preva-
lence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of around
33%, autistic spectrum disorder of 21%, depression of 7% and
anxiety of 13%.18 A nationwide Norwegian registry study in an unse-
lected paediatric population of over 1 000 000 children reported devel-
opmental and psychiatric comorbidities in 43% of children with
epilepsy, with overall odds ratios (compared with the general popula-
tion of children) of 10.7 (95% CI 9.5–12.1) for autism, 5.4 (95% CI 4.8–
5.9) for ADHD, 2.3 (95% CI 1.8–3.0) for anxiety disorders and 1.8
(95% CI 1.4–2.5) for depression.19 A study of 140 adolescents with epi-
lepsy attending a Hong Kong hospital out-patient neurology clinic
reported 22.1% rates for depression and 32.8% for anxiety.20

Stigma and double stigma in mental health

Stigma is a complex phenomenon and research in this area involves
specialised disciplines including social sciences and social psych-
ology. The French sociologist Emile Durkheim was probably the
first to explore stigma as a social phenomenon but research on
stigma in mental health probably started in the 1960s with the
American sociologist Erwin Goffman,21 followed by the publica-
tions of Thomas Scheff22 and Bruce Link23. However, at that time,
the debate focused on how psychiatry was organised, and how
this was responsible for the stigma and public attitude towards
people with mental health problems. Subsequent research on
stigma in mental health progressed identifying different types of
stigma and social group processes.24–26 The labelling, stereotyping,
separation from others and consequent status loss are the key ele-
ments of stigma and they are ‘relevant only in a power situation
that allows them to unfold’.27,28 These studies have highlighted
how powerful stereotypes are in our society and their deleterious
impact primarily on patients themselves. In fact, negative stereo-
types are so ingrained in the collective belief that they become an
accepted part of people’s belief including patients who internalise
how society devalues them. This process is a key element of felt (per-
ceived) stigma and it makes patients feel not empowered to change
the situation and, ultimately, maintain the stigma itself.

Negative stereotypes about mental illness are well known. A survey
investigating beliefs of random Web users around the world showed
that only 7% of people believe that psychiatric disorders could be over-
come and between 8% (high-income countries) and 16% (low-income
countries) of people believe that individuals with mental health issues
are more violent than others.29 A cross-sectional survey in people with
first-episode psychosis or depression investigated levels of discrimin-
ation through face-to-face interview.30 People with depression reported

greater discrimination in regard to neighbours, dating, education, mar-
riage, religious activities, physical health and acting as a parent than
participants with first-episode psychosis. Data from a large prospective
population study in Norway showed high chances of divorce in couples
where one of the two is diagnosed with a mental illness.31 A US study
comparing fictitious job applications (n = 635) listing mental illness
versus physical injury, showed significant discrimination for candidates
with a history of mental illness, and this discrimination did not differ
for jobs that could be done away from an office setting.32

The main consequence of stigma is not simply a negative impact
on quality of life for people with mental illness, as stigma has dele-
terious consequences from a clinical perspective serving as a barrier
to health-seeking/diagnosis, treatment and adherence.33 A system-
atic review investigating the relationship between mental health-
related stigma and help-seeking clearly showed that stigmatising
attitudes towards people with a mental illness is associated with
less active help-seeking from patients and their relatives.34 In this
context, people with an already stigmatised condition often do
not reveal their mental state to healthcare professionals for fear of
being stigmatised further. Also, healthcare professionals dealing
with people with epilepsy are often not skilled in detecting psycho-
logical symptoms and, even when they do, they often fail to take the
necessary action for further assessment, management and refer-
ral.35,36 For all these reason, people with double stigma have to
fight further in order to receive the best possible care (Appendix).
The European Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020 has spe-
cifically included, among the proposed actions, evidence-based
anti-stigma activities in high-risk groups.37 In 2018, the WHO pub-
lished the United Nations Common Position on Ending HIV, TB and
Viral Hepatitis through Intersectoral Collaboration.38 Among the
shared principles, it is specifically mentioned that ending these
epidemics is not just the absence of the disease but also a state of
complete, physical, mental and social well-being, acknowledging
the issue of double stigma in these patients. It is quite astonishing
that none of
these documented listed epilepsy among those
medical conditions already stigmatised.

The double stigma of epilepsy and mental health: a
complex paradigm

The impact of stigma is immediately evident on the more intimate life
domains of people such as cohabitation and marriage. Patients with
epilepsy are less likely to be married or more likely to be divorced as
compared with people with other chronic medical conditions.39–41
A systematic review of the social outcomes of adults with a
history of childhood-onset epilepsy showed that only one in three
people were in a romantic relationship, one in three lived independ-
ently and one in five had children.42 In low-income countries,
people with epilepsy are particularly vulnerable to discrimination
as in many of these countries there are no anti-discrimination laws
or policies in place. A study from Tanzania, showed that only one
in three people with epilepsy was in education or in paid employ-
ment.43 However, stigma easily overcomes anti-discrimination laws
and policies and problems are very similar in high-income countries
where anti-discrimination laws may not be effective. A survey from
Australia showed that 47% of patients with epilepsy were able
to document unfair treatment in the workplace.44 A systematic
review of employability in people with epilepsy showed a mean
adjusted employment rate of 58% with no significant differences
between continents.45 Still, this study showed similar employment
rates in people with uncontrolled and those with controlled seizures,
suggesting that unemployment is likely to be related to non-clinical
factors.45

The concept of double stigma in epilepsy and mental health is more
complex than the simple additional effects of the two stigmatised

2

conditions. In fact, felt (perceived) stigma is an important determinant
per se of mental health problems in epilepsy, creating a vicious
circle.46,47 In epilepsy, perceived stigma is a risk factor for the develop-
ment of mood and anxiety disorders,48,49 which, at the same time, are
risk factors for perceived stigma, along with other personality fea-
tures.50,51 This phenomenon is present in low-income as well as
high-income countries, independently of background, although spe-
cific cultures may have greater degrees of stigma. A study from
Ethiopia showed that perceived stigma is associated with depression
in people with epilepsy.52 In the same way, a study from Italy showed
that feeling stigmatised correlates with depressive symptoms rather
than seizure frequency.53 A systematic review of clinical correlates of
stigma in adults with epilepsy showed that stigma is associated with
depression and anxiety.54

Stigma affects not only patients but also their caregivers and has
negative consequences on their mental health.55,56 A cross-sectional
study from the USA showed that caregivers of people with drug-resist-
ant epilepsy experience high perceived stigma and burden levels.57 In
low- and middle-income countries, 20% of mothers of children with
epilepsy feel stigmatised because of their child’s neurological condi-
tion.58 The caregiver’s perception of burden, together with the level
of family functioning, are indirectly correlated with depressive symp-
toms in people with epilepsy via the mediating effect of caregiver
depression.59 The same phenomena are reported also in high-
income countries. A UK study showed that mothers of young children
with epilepsy report high levels of parenting stress as compared with
mothers of children with non-epilepsy related neurodisabilities.60

Studies addressing the phenomenon of double stigma in epilepsy
are almost non-existent. A study from Brazil showed that cohabiting
relatives of people with epilepsy and depression experience more
stigma than those with epilepsy only.61 A study from Bosnia
Herzegovina, showed that patients with epilepsy and depression
present with higher levels of stigma as compared with those with epi-
lepsy only.62 However, the phenomenon of double stigma is not ana-
lysed in detail.

What can be done to address the problem? Anti-stigma campaigns
and educational initiatives about epilepsy can have positive effects on
well-being and mental health problems. An educational campaign in
rural Bolivia aimed at improving knowledge towards epilepsy showed
that the improved knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy was asso-
ciated with reduced stigma, better quality of life and fewer depressive
symptoms.63 However, as pointed out by a study from the
Philippines, these strategies may not always be successful in the
context of double stigma if context-specific approaches are not consid-
ered.64 It is not possible to develop effective campaigns and policies on
double stigma in epilepsy and mental health without a clear analysis of
the problem and for this reason, further studies on this phenomenon
are urgently needed.

The new definition of epilepsy published in 2014 now defines epi-
lepsy as a disorder of the brain characterised not just by recurrent sei-
zures but also by its psychosocial consequences65 and the new
classification of syndromes published in 2017 recognises comorbid-
ities as an important part of the diagnostic process.66 Furthermore,
the new WHO global report on epilepsy also mentions the presence
of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy and the importance of addressing
them.1 These necessary preliminary steps are helpful as they lead to
the global acknowledgement of mental health problems in people
with epilepsy as well as the associated double stigma but significant
work still needs to be done in terms of education (for example
society, patients, and healthcare providers) and access to care.

Discussion

Lack of studies on the phenomenon of double stigma represents a
major concern and more research in this area is needed. Both

Epilepsy, mental illness and stigma

quantitative and qualitative studies as well as systematic reviews
and meta-analyses are required to better appreciate the key issues
that exist for patients with both epilepsy and mental disorders. In
fact, future anti-stigma campaigns will need to take into account
the phenomenon of double stigma in order to develop targeted
and focused interventions.

Stigma is unacceptable and everyone has the right to be protected
from it. Counteracting stigma and discrimination is a duty of govern-
ments, health services, medical schools, medical societies, patients’
organisations, families and the general public. Advocacy can take
many forms and it represents the best way to fight stigma and to
empower people with epilepsy and mental health problems.67
