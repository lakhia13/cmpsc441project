Abstract 
The implementation of equine-assisted services (EAS) during treatment for psychological disorders has been fre-
quently documented; however, little is known about the effect of EAS on outcomes for populations with substance 
use disorder (SUD). The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize existing literature reporting the effects of 
EAS when incorporated into SUD treatment. This review followed guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist for scoping reviews. A search of four databases (MEDLINE/
PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Academic OneFile) 
identified studies reporting quantitative and/or qualitative data for an EAS intervention that was implemented among 
a population receiving treatment for and/or diagnosed with SUD. Of 188 titles, 71 underwent full-text assessment and 
six met inclusion criteria. Three additional articles were identified through other sources. Quantitative data suggested 
a potential positive effect of EAS on SUD treatment retention and completion as well as participants’ mental health; 
however, studies were limited by small sample sizes. Qualitative data indicated that in addition to participants devel-
oping bonds with the horses and perceiving EAS as welcomed breaks from traditional treatment, they experienced 
increased self-efficacy, positive emotional affect, and SUD treatment motivation. Due to methodological limitations 
and an overall dearth of available studies, the effectiveness of EAS as adjuncts to SUD treatment is inconclusive. Addi-
tional research is necessary before supporting broad implementation of EAS as adjuncts to SUD treatment.

Introduction
In  2020,  40.3  million  Americans  recorded  a  past  year 
substance  use  disorder  (SUD),  yet  only  approximately 
one-tenth  of  this  number  received  any  specialty  treat-
ment  [1].  Among  those  who  do  engage  in  SUD  care, 
retention  is  uncertain  and  dropout  rates  across  in-per-
son  psychosocial  treatments  average  30.4%  [2].  Given 
the  documented  positive  association  between  time  in

treatment  and  improved  outcomes  for  individuals  with 
SUD [3–5], there is a need to identify interventions that 
can be used to increase treatment motivation, retention, 
and remission.

One potential avenue for such interventions is equine-
assisted services (EAS). EAS is a unifying term that cap-
tures all services where professionals incorporate horses 
(or  equines)  to  benefit  people  [6].  Of  particular  inter-
est  are  psychotherapies  incorporating  equines,  such  as 
equine-assisted  psychotherapy  (EAP)  and  equine-facili-
tated psychotherapy (EFP). With these novel and comple-
mentary  approaches  to  psychotherapy,  the  horse  serves 
as a supporter of psychotherapeutic interventions as well 
as a mediator between psychotherapist and client [7]. In

this therapeutic triad (client-horse-therapist), by prompt-
ing  specific  behaviors  and  serving  as  a  metaphor  for 
understanding  internal  experiences,  the  horse  facilitates 
personal exploration and provides a context for interpret-
ing  client  difficulties  [8].  Horses  may  be  suited  for  this 
therapeutic  role  due  in  part  to  a  keen  awareness  of  and 
sensitivity  to  nonverbal  communication  [8,  9].  Horses’ 
automatic responses to client behaviors provide valuable 
information that can inspire client insight and self-aware-
ness  [8,  9].  Additionally,  horses  are  claimed  to  be  well-
positioned  due  to  their  powerful  physical  attributes  and 
the resulting emotions they stir in people [9, 10].

The  implementation  of  equines  during  treatment 
for  psychological  disorders  has  been  frequently  docu-
mented.  Following  EAS,  participants  have  reported 
significant  reductions  in  symptoms  of  psychological 
distress  [11],  hyperactive  behaviors  [12],  violent  behav-
iors [13], post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [14, 15], 
and anxiety [15, 16].

In  line  with  this  developing  body  of  research,  there 
have  been  media  reports  of  incorporating  equines 
into  SUD  treatment  [17–19].  However,  while  some 
individuals  have  indicated  a  beneficial  effect  of  EAS 
on  substance  misuse  [20],  few  studies  have  provided 
experimental/non-anecdotal  support  for  their  effec-
tiveness on the recovery process. One study evaluating 
the efficacy of an EAS intervention for treating anxiety 
and  PTSD  found  a  significant  reduction  in  alcohol  use 
among participants [15].

While  previous  research  has  indicated  a  potentially 
beneficial  effect  of  EAS  on  behavioral  health  outcomes, 
there remain significant concerns regarding methodolog-
ical  limitations  of  corresponding  studies  and  the  possi-
bility of marketing expensive treatments of questionable 
efficacy and challenging scalability to vulnerable popula-
tions [8]. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is 
to discuss the current state of the literature, identify gaps 
in knowledge, and propose future directions for research 
necessary to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of EAS 
on  recovery-related  outcomes  for  individuals  undergo-
ing SUD treatment. A scoping review design was selected 
due to an anticipated lack of published literature on the 
use of EAS in SUD recovery and a desire to comprehen-
sively identify all existing studies.

Methods
Information sources

This  scoping  review  followed  guidelines  in  the  PRISMA 
checklist  for  scoping  reviews  [21].  The  literature  search 
included four databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, 
the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Liter-
ature (CINAHL), and Academic OneFile. Academic One-
File  was  queried  to  increase  the  opportunity  to  identify 

eligible  studies  within  gray  or  lay  literature.  Databases 
were searched from database inception to July  27th, 2021. 
At  this  time,  scoping  review  protocols  cannot  be  reg-
istered  with  PROSPERO  and  the  protocol  was  not  pub-
lished elsewhere.

Search criteria

The  search  query  included  the  medical  subject  heading 
“substance-related  disorders,”  SUD-related  keywords, 
and  EAS-related  keywords.  A  full  description  of  the 
search  terms  can  be  found  in  Supplemental  Table  1.  In 
addition to the database search, one author (MAG) con-
ducted  a  thorough  search  of  past  systematic  reviews  to 
identify any potentially relevant articles not produced in 
the database search.

Eligibility criteria

Articles  were  included  in  this  review  if  they  reported 
quantitative and/or qualitative data for an EAS interven-
tion  that  was  implemented  among  a  population  receiv-
ing treatment for and/or diagnosed with a SUD. Studies 
were excluded if the EAS intervention was implemented 
in  a  population  not  comprised  of  those  receiving  treat-
ment  for  and/or  diagnosed  with  a  SUD.  Studies  exclu-
sively  focusing  on  hippotherapy  were  excluded  due  to 
hippotherapy’s designation as a therapy tool for physical, 
occupational, and/or speech therapy and its typical use in 
populations  with  neuromotor  and/or  cognitive/commu-
nication deficits [22].

Selection of evidence

Sequential  screening  of  article  titles,  abstracts,  and 
full-text  articles  was  performed  independently  by  two 
reviewers (LD, MAG). Any disagreements were resolved 
through  consensus.  Data  extraction  was  performed 
independently  by  two  authors  (LD,  MAG)  using  origi-
nally  developed  Microsoft  Excel  spreadsheets.  Informa-
tion extracted on the study characteristics included: first 
author,  publication  year,  study  objective,  study  design, 
study  setting,  years  of  recruitment,  population,  sam-
ple size, description of study groups, study outcomes or 
qualitative  themes,  subthemes,  and  brief  results.  Infor-
mation  extracted  on  EAS  interventions  included:  name 
of EAS intervention, definition of EAS intervention, EAS 
staff  qualifications,  EAS  activities,  and  descriptions  of 
EAS  activities.  Disagreement  during  the  data  extraction 
process was resolved through consensus. Following data 
extraction,  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  were  jointly 
reviewed  and  qualitatively  synthesized/summarized  by 
two authors (LD, MAG).

Results
The search yielded a total of 192 articles (Fig. 1). Of the 
188  titles  that  remained  after  the  removal  of  duplicates 
(n = 4),  71  were  selected  for  full-text  assessment.  The 
majority  of  titles,  largely  comprised  of  magazine  and 
news media articles, did not include abstracts. Therefore, 
all articles selected during title assessment went through 
full-text assessment. Of those 71 titles, 65 were removed, 
either  due  to  an  inability  to  locate  the  full-text  article 
(n = 1) or because the article, or study referenced within 
the  article,  did  not  include  participants  diagnosed  with 
and/or  in  treatment  for  a  SUD  (n = 64).  In  addition  to 
the  six  studies  remaining  after  full-text  assessment,  two 
studies [23, 24] were discovered searching the references 
of these papers and one study [25] was found via a more 
recent  article  search  on  November   11th,  2021,  yielding 
nine total studies for qualitative synthesis.

Study settings and populations

Table  1  summarizes  the  study  and  intervention-related 
characteristics  of  corresponding  EAS.  Six  studies  were 
qualitative [23, 24, 26–29]. The three quantitative studies 

included  a  randomized  control  trial  [30],  prospective 
cohort  analysis  [31],  and  quasi-experimental  study  [25]. 
All but two studies were peer-reviewed publications, one 
study  was  an  unpublished  master’s  thesis  [23]  and  one 
was a doctoral dissertation [29]. Five of the studies took 
place in Norway [23, 27, 28, 30, 31], two in Canada [24, 
26], one in the United States [25], and one did not specify 
location [29].

Demographics and clinical characteristics

The majority of study participants were 26 years of age 
or  younger  with  four  studies  including  strictly  ado-
lescents  [24–26,  29].  Less  than  half  of  the  included 
studies  provided  demographic  information  on  race  or 
ethnicity  [24–26,  29].  Five  studies  provided  data  on 
participant substance use [24, 26, 29–31]. Among these 
studies, a wide variety of substance use was character-
ized with no clear indication of a primary substance of 
misuse  among  populations  receiving  EAS.  Four  of  the 
nine  studies  assessed  for  the  presence  of  co-morbid 
mental  health  conditions  among  participants  [28–31].

Additional  demographic  characteristics  for  each  study 
are summarized in Supplemental Table 2.

Quantitative results
Horse‑assisted therapy

EAS-related results

EAS  captured  in  this  review  included  horse-assisted 
therapy  (HAT)  (n = 5)  [23,  27,  28,  30,  31],  equine-
assisted learning (EAL) (n = 2) [24, 26], equine-assisted 
psychotherapy  (EAP)  (n = 1)  [29],  and  equine-facili-
tated psychotherapy (EFP) (n = 1) [25].

EAS staff qualifications were documented in six of the 
nine studies (Table 1) [23, 27–31]. HAT therapists were 
consistently described as qualified/experienced psycho-
therapists  with  additional  horsemanship-related  com-
petencies [23,  27, 28, 30, 31]. Stiltner [29] documented 
EAP  therapists  as  being  trained  through  the  Equine 
Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) 
model.  For  curriculum  design,  it  appears  that  all  five 
HAT  studies  employed  the  “Gaustad  Model”  of  horse-
assisted  therapy  at  Oslo  University  Hospital  (unpub-
lished)  [23,  27,  28,  30,  31].  For  EAL,  Adams  et  al.  [26] 
detailed  the  Cartier  Equine  Learning  Center  as  devel-
oping  an  “EAL  formula”  distinct  from  other  programs 
and based on six components: relationship, curriculum, 
formula, horse, facilitation, and partnerships. Atherton 
et al. [25] described their EFP protocol as being devel-
oped  according  to  a  choice  theory  foundation  with 
each session based on one of Glasser’s [32] connecting 
behaviors. Dell et al. [24] and Stiltner [29] did not doc-
ument curriculum design.

Across EAS programs participants engaged in a vari-
ety of facilitator-led horse activities. In HAT, activities 
included various combinations of herd behavior obser-
vation,  stable  work,  groundwork  (such  as  grooming, 
leading, or setting limits), mounted work (riding in the 
arena,  around  the  grounds,  or  in  the  woods),  vaulting 
(gymnastics  on  horseback),  and  driving  a  carriage  [23, 
27,  28,  30,  31].  Each  activity  was  described  as  having 
a  different  psychological  significance  and  was  incor-
porated  at  the  discretion  of  the  HAT  therapist  and 
according to patient treatment progression [30, 31]. For 
EFP,  described  activities  largely  included  groundwork 
as  well  as  the  horseman’s  handshake,  herd  observa-
tion, and grooming [25]. These activities were targeted 
toward  specific  therapeutic  and  horsemanship  goals 
and  each  EFP  session  concluded  with  a  half-hour  of 
group processing facilitated by the intervention’s addic-
tion counselor and equine specialist [25]. EAL activities 
were  largely  undescribed  with  the  exception  of  pro-
grams  being  characterized  as  non-riding  and  focused 
on  ground  activities  [24,  26].  Examples  of  EAP  activi-
ties included leading the horse, maneuvering the horse 
around obstacles, and riding the horse [29].

Two  studies  provided  quantitative  results  for  HAT 
(Table  2)  [30,  31].  In  both  studies,  treatment  as  usual 
(TAU)  consisted  of  a  person-centered  program  with 
both  individual  and  group  therapy  that  was  based  on 
a  biopsychosocial  model  with  emphasis  on  mentali-
zation-based  theory  and  practice.  Using  a  naturalistic 
prospective  cohort  study  design  (n = 108),  Kern-Godal 
et al. [31] reported that compared to TAU, HAT group 
participants  were  more  likely  to  complete  treatment 
(p < 0.001),  remain  in  treatment  for  a  longer  period 
(p < 0.001),  and  remain  in  treatment  for  90  days  or 
more (aOR 3.9, p = 0.001). Using an intention-to-treat, 
randomized  control  trial  (RCT)  study  design  (n = 37), 
Gatti  et  al.  [30]  documented  no  significant  association 
between  participants  receiving  HAT  versus  TAU  and 
dropout  relative  to  treatment  completion  (OR:  0.60, 
p = 0.553)  or  transferring  to  another  treatment  facility 
relative to treatment completion (OR: 0.47, p = 0.335).

Equine‑facilitated psychotherapy

With  a  quasi-experimental,  pretest–posttest  design 
(n = 10),  Atherton  et  al.  [25]  documented  that  after 
completing six EFP sessions, adolescents with an active 
SUD  diagnosis  experienced  an  increase  in  prosocial 
behaviors  and  a  reduction  in  negative  psychosocial 
symptoms, specifically depressive and anxious sympto-
mology (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

Qualitative results

Presented  here  is  a  synthesis  of  the  common  themes 
seen  across  qualitative  studies  (n = 6).  Brenna  [23]  is 
not  referenced  in  this  synthesis  due  to  overlap  with 
qualitative  results  presented  by  Kern-Godal,  Brenna, 
Arnevik,  et  al.  [27]  and  Kern-Godal,  Brenna,  Kogstad, 
et  al.  [28],  and  the  likelihood  that  these  results  are 
based on the same study population.

Developed bond/relationship with a horse

Four studies described the benefits of the bond or relation-
ship  participants  formed  with  the  horses  [24, 26,  28,  29]. 
Many  of  the  participants  reported  that  bonding  with  the 
horses helped them develop trust [24, 26, 29]. These bonds 
likely formed because participants perceived the horses as 
non-judgmental [24, 28]. Participant reports included, “the 
horse accepts you, like, for who you are” [28]. Furthermore, 
in two studies interviewing First Nations and Inuit youth in 
Canada, researchers reported that working with the horses 
helped  the  youth  develop  a  bond  that  facilitated  spiritual 
exchange with their cultures [24, 26].

Increased self‑efficacy and empowerment

Negative/indifferent experiences

All five studies reported that partaking in the EAS pro-
gram  empowered  participants  [24,  26–29].  Many  par-
ticipants reported increased self-efficacy through their 
“mastery”  of  working  with  the  horses  [28].  Dell  et  al. 
[24]  reported  that  First  Nations  youth  often  shared 
their pride in how they learned to perform equine-spe-
cific  techniques  through  communicative  interactions 
with  the  horse.  This  increased  confidence  may  also  be 
due  to  the  physicality  associated  with  working  with 
the horses, which gave participants a sense of purpose 
through  meaningful  engagement  with  a  productive 
activity [27, 29].

of participation in the EAS programs [26, 28, 29]. Nearly 
all  of  the  participants  expressed  happiness  as  well  as  a 
sense of calmness when engaging in EAS [26, 28, 29] and 
several  participants  reported  that  EAS  had  an  effect  on 
their mental health, particularly depression. In one study, 
a  participant  stated  that  upon  leaving  EAP,  “I  come  out 
happy and not so depressed” [29].

Break from usual/traditional treatment

Another qualitative theme seen across studies is the feel-
ing  that  EAS  represented  breaks  from  usual/traditional 
treatment  for  participants.  Stiltner  [29]  reported  that 
participants felt EAP made their residential facility seem 
less like an institution and credited the horses with mak-
ing  things  feel  “homey”  [29].  In  parallel,  Kern-Godal, 
Brenna,  Arnevik,  et  al.  [27]  documented  participants 
describing  HAT  as  a  “pleasant  variation”  from  usual 
treatment.  Participants  especially  enjoyed  the  hands-on 
aspect  of  EAS  versus  traditional  talk  therapy  [27,  29]. 
Dell et al. [24] detailed how EAL enhanced participants’ 
social wellbeing by providing participates an opportunity 
to participate in a new activity.

Treatment motivation

Across  studies,  participants  additionally  detailed  the 
motivational  impact  of  EAS  on  their  treatment.  Stilt-
ner  [29]  documented  how  EAP  participants  looked 
forward  to  their  sessions  and  wished  that  they  could 
spend  more  time  with  the  horses.  Similarly,  Kern-
Godal,  Brenna,  Arnevik,  et  al.  [27]  described  HAT  as 
being a motivational factor for participants to come to 
treatment in the first place. Adams et al. [26] addition-
ally  documented  that  EAL  participants  experienced 
psychological  healing  as  a  result  of  increased  partici-
pation and effort.

Four  studies  included  in  this  review  briefly  reported  on 
negative/indifferent  participant  experiences/attitudes 
regarding EAS as adjuncts to their SUD treatment. Kern-
Godal,  Brenna,  Arnevik,  et  al.  [27]  detailed  one  par-
ticipant  as  feeling  that  HAT  had  little  to  do  with  their 
motivation  to  succeed  in  treatment.  Moreover,  Stiltner 
[29]  detailed  two  participants  that  did  not  look  forward 
to their EAP sessions due to a fear of horses and displeas-
ure with being outdoors. Lastly, Dell et al. [24] noted that 
several  EAL  participants  complained  that  the  equine 
facility was “cold” and “stinky like a farm.”

Discussion
This  scoping  review  is  the  first  to  synthesize  literature 
discussing  the  implementation  of  EAS  in  populations 
diagnosed with or receiving treatment for SUDs. Results 
highlight  potentially  beneficial  effects  of  EAS  for  indi-
viduals  with  SUDs;  however,  an  overall  dearth  of  stud-
ies and methodological limitations necessitate additional 
research before the implementation of EAS as adjuncts to 
SUD treatment can be supported.

Quantitative  data  summarized  in  the  current  study 
are insufficient to conclude a beneficial effect of EAS on 
the SUD recovery process. Using a more rigorous RCT-
experimental design, Gatti et al. [30] was unable to repro-
duce the statistical significance of Kern-Godal et al. [31] 
and  only  observed  nonsignificant  differences  in  treat-
ment completion (44% versus 32%) and time in treatment 
(98.7 days versus 107.4 days) for HAT participants com-
pared to their TAU counterparts. Gatti et al. [30] suggests 
a  reduction  in  sample  size  from  n = 50,  a  value  origi-
nally  calculated  based  on  findings  from  Kern-Godal  et 
al.  [31],  to  n = 37  as  potentially  responsible  for  the  lack 
of  statistical  significance.  Reasons  for  participant  exclu-
sion included: four were not eligible, two did not return 
informed  consent  documents,  and  seven  withdrew  con-
sent  based  on  randomization  assignment.  Continuing, 
among HAT participants, only 11% completed all 12 pre-
scribed HAT sessions and among those who dropped out 
of SUD treatment 75% attended less than eight sessions. 
Gatti  et  al.  [30]  reasons  that  this  may  indicate  a  mini-
mum number of sessions necessary to achieve meaning-
ful effect when treating persons with SUDs. Despite the 
lack of statistical significance experienced by Gatti et al. 
[30], the suggestive positive effect of HAT on SUD treat-
ment  retention  and  completion  seen  by  Kern-Godal 
et  al.  [31]  is  consistent  with  observations  of  EAS  for 
individuals with PTSD, another population with histori-
cally  poor  treatment  outcomes  and  high  attrition  rates 
[33].  The  finding  that  EFP  reduces  negative  psychoso-
cial  symptoms,  specifically  anxious  symptomatology,  as 
reported  by  Atherton  et  al.  [25],  has  also  been  reported 

 Diaz et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2022) 17:81

in non-SUD populations [14–16]. Considering that men-
tal  illness  may  lead  to  the  persistence  of  SUDs  through 
mechanisms such as self-medication of dysphoric mood 
[34],  it  is  potentially  worth  investigating  whether  EAS 
could be useful adjuncts in the treatment of those dually 
diagnosed with mental health conditions and SUDs.

Qualitative  studies  highlight  a  number  of  beneficial 
effects  of  EAS  for  individuals  in  treatment  for  and/or 
diagnosed with SUDs. Qualitative findings are consistent 
with those of other studies investigating EAS as adjunc-
tive  therapies  for  populations  with  mental  health  disor-
ders  or  trauma,  where  EAS  participants  have  similarly 
reported  decreases  in  negative  psychosocial  symptoms 
and  forming  bonds  with  their  horses  [11,  14,  16,  35]. 
Yet,  there  are  several  limitations  to  consider  regarding 
the  applicability  of  these  results.  First,  included  studies 
appear to have limited their focus to positive attributes of 
EAS,  indicating  potential  bias. Three  studies  specifically 
made  note  of  this  positive/negative  imbalance,  stating 
that  a  pro-horse  background  among  authors  may  have 
influenced interpretation of participants’ responses [27–
29]. It is equally important to recognize that the themes 
identified in these studies were limited to adolescent and 
young adult populations.

Directions for future research
Quantitative studies

Future  research  into  EAS  programs  should  focus  on 
methodologically rigorous studies. While the field would 
benefit  from  additional  RCTs  with  sufficient  statistical 
power, there is also a role for non-randomized prospec-
tive  cohort  studies  that  allow  for  easier  implementation 
and  further  exploration  of  outcomes  impacted  by  EAS 
participation,  including  measures  of  substance  use  (e.g., 
self-report and/or urine drug screens). RCTs moving for-
ward  should  include  careful  consideration  of  TAU  con-
ditions  and  consider  potentially  incorporating  elements 
(e.g.,  gardening  activities)  that  control  for  peripheral 
aspects  of  EAS,  such  as  positive  effects  stemming  from 
being  outdoors  or  engaging  in  productive  work.  Fur-
thermore, consideration should be given to three-armed 
randomized  controlled  studies  that  include  alternative 
animal-assisted  therapies.  Studies  of  this  nature  would 
allow  investigators  to  better  isolate  EAS-specific  effects 
and  the  unique  contributions  of  the  horse.  Additionally, 
as  acknowledged  by  Gatti  et  al.  [30]  who  had  7  partici-
pants withdraw consent based on randomization assign-
ment, it is reasonable to assume that EAS would be most 
effective for those actively seeking this type of treatment. 
Therefore,  innovative  randomized  experimental  designs 
that  take  into  consideration  patient  preference  may 
more  accurately  reflect  real  world  implementation  and 
effectiveness [36].  Additionally, however,  these  observed 

dropouts  may  have  also  been  the  result  of  randomizing 
individuals  in  a  single  treatment  setting  where  partici-
pants  are  acutely  aware  of  counterparts’  differing  treat-
ment conditions. As such, if multiple residential settings 
are available, it may be more appropriate to employ clus-
ter  randomized  trials  or  stepped-wedge  designs  where 
all participants in a single setting receive the same inter-
vention.  Independent  of  exact  study  design,  however, 
quantitative  studies  investigating  the  impact  of  EAS  in 
populations  with  SUDs  should  incorporate  larger  sam-
ple sizes to account for the high probability of dropout in 
these populations [2] and to enhance the statistical power 
of findings.

Qualitative studies

In addition to quantitative studies, there is an equal need 
for  continued  qualitative  studies.  Qualitative  studies  are 
important  for  further  identifying  predictors  and  out-
comes that should be rigorously assessed in future quan-
titative  studies.  Several  themes  have  already  emerged 
across  existing  qualitative  studies  that  should  inform 
future  study  measurements,  including  improved  self-
esteem/efficacy  and  emotional  effect/mental  health. 
Moving  forward,  however,  qualitative  studies  should 
include  more  direct  exploration  of  negative  participant 
experiences.  As  previously  described,  qualitative  studies 
to this point have seemingly limited their focus to posi-
tive  attributes  of  EAS.  Evaluating  negative  perspectives 
on  EAS  through  intentional  assessment  (e.g.,  targeted 
interview  questions)  is  necessary  in  order  to  accurately 
evaluate  the  acceptability  of  EAS  among  populations  in 
SUD  treatment.  Additionally,  future  qualitive  studies 
should consider assessing individuals’ reasons for declin-
ing EAS participation (if they consent to this sub-study). 
Ultimately,  qualitative  studies  will  be  essential  for  eluci-
dating possible mechanism of change for EAS as adjuncts 
to SUD treatment.

Standardized terminology for equine interventions

services 

referencing  human 

When 
incorporating 
equines, in both popular media and academic literature, 
there  exist  widespread  usage  of  unclear  and  imprecise 
terms [6]. This lack of standardization impedes replicable 
research  and  creates  an  environment  where  EAS  inter-
ventions  cannot  be  properly  evaluated  and  scientifically 
developed [37]. Future researchers should work to stand-
ardize  and  optimize  terminology  surrounding  human 
services incorporating equines. Woods et al. [6] provided 
a  starting  point  to  this  end,  but  acknowledge  that  their 
recommendations were developed from consensus rather 
than unanimous decision making and identify their arti-
cle  as  a  living  document.  Prior  to  the  resolution  of  ter-
minology  concerns,  researchers  should  provide  detailed 

Diaz et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2022) 17:81 

Page 11 of 13

protocol  descriptions  such  that  replicability  is  possible 
independent of naming convention [37].

Reporting of participants’ demographics

Future  research  into  the  effectiveness  of  EAS  in  SUD 
treatment  should  include  improved  reporting  on  study 
participants’ demographics. Of the nine studies included 
in  this  review,  less  than  half  provided  racial  or  ethnic 
demographic  information  for  their  study  populations 
[24–26, 29]. Without clear reporting on such characteris-
tics, the generalizability of results across racial and ethnic 
groups  cannot  be  determined.  This  is  especially  signifi-
cant  given  the  well-documented  racial  disparities  that 
exist  in  SUD  treatment  completion  [38–40].  Moreover, 
four studies provided no breakdown of participants’ sub-
stance use [23, 25, 27, 28]. If the impact of EAS on SUD 
treatment  is  to  be  understood,  detailed  characterization 
of study participants’ substance use, including identifica-
tion  of  SUD  diagnosis  status  and  specific  SUD,  must  be 
reported, and where possible, sub-analyzed. Additionally, 
we  recommend  that  future  research  carefully  describe 
treatment settings and concomitant interventions so that 
results  can  be  appropriately  interpreted.  Understanding 
the variance in effect depending on type of SUD or treat-
ment setting will be important in identifying groups that 
potentially  stand  to  benefit  the  most  from  participation 
in EAS as a part of SUD recovery.

Limitations

The current scoping review has several limitations. First, 
the majority of studies included in this review had small 
sample sizes and likely lacked the statistical power neces-
sary to accurately describe the effect of EAS participation 
on  treatment-related  outcomes.  Second,  summarized 
results may be subject to publication bias as researchers 
may  have  missed  unpublished  findings  of  existing  EAS 
programs  for  individuals  with  SUD.  Finally,  the  studies 
included  in  this  review,  which  provided  study  location, 
came from Norway (n = 5), Canada (n = 2), or the United 
States  (n = 1),  limiting  the  generalizability  of  the  find-
ings to those regions. Further, as all nine studies involved 
exclusively  adolescent  or  young-adult  populations,  both 
qualitative  and  quantitative  findings  cannot  be  general-
ized to older adult populations with SUD.

Conclusions
Despite  suggestive  positive 
trends,  methodological 
limitations,  limited  population  diversity,  and  an  over-
all  dearth  of  available  studies  delay  conclusions  on  the 
effects  of  EAS  as  adjuncts  to  SUD  treatment.  In  addi-
tion  to  a  greater  number  of  quantitative  and  qualitative 
studies of rigorous design that further explore outcomes 
impacted  by  EAS,  future  research  should  ensure  clear 

reporting of participant demographics as well as attempt 
to  standardize  and  optimize  terminology  related  to  ser-
vices  incorporating  equines.  Additionally,  future  studies 
should  investigate  EAS  as  adjuncts  to  SUD  treatment 
among  older  adults  and  populations  in  additional  geo-
graphic locations.
