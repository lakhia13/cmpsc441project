Abstract

There is a growing appreciation of the importance of gut microbiota to health and disease. This has been driven by advances 
in sequencing technology and recent findings demonstrating the important role of microbiota in common health disorders 
such as obesity. Moreover, the potential role of gut microbiota in influencing brain function, behavior, and mental health has 
attracted the attention of neuroscientists and psychiatrists. At the 29th International College of Neuropsychopharmacology 
(CINP) World Congress held in Vancouver, Canada, in June 2014, a group of experts presented the symposium, “Gut microbiota 
and brain function: Relevance to psychiatric disorders” to review the latest findings in how gut microbiota may play a role 
in  brain  function,  behavior,  and  disease. The  symposium  covered  a  broad  range  of  topics,  including  gut  microbiota  and 
neuroendocrine  function,  the  influence  of  gut  microbiota  on  behavior,  probiotics  as  regulators  of  brain  and  behavior,  and 
imaging the gut-brain axis in humans. This report provides an overview of these presentations.

Microbiota and Behavior

The role of the microbiome in the determination of behavior and 
cognition  is  increasingly  being  recognized  (Cryan  and  Dinan, 
2012; Collins et al., 2013; Foster and McVey Neufeld, 2013; Lyte, 
2013).  In  fact,  the  development  of  the  brain  itself  in  the  grow-
ing infant has been shown to be influenced by the microbiome 
(Douglas-Escobar  et  al.,  2013).  As  such,  the  communication  of 
gut microbiota with the brain, through what is referred to as the 
microbiota-gut-brain  axis,  represents  a  new  biological  axis  by 
which novel diet-based therapies can be designed to influence 
brain function and behavior. Early studies in animals first dem-
onstrated that the introduction of a single, unique bacterium in 
the gut resulted in the development of anxiety-like behavior in 

mice,  with  concomitant  activation  of  neuronal  regions  in  the 
brain that were dependent on information received from the gut 
via the vagus nerve (Goehler et al., 2005). Later studies showed 
that  the  transplantation  of  the  fecal  microbiome  from  one 
mouse strain displaying a phenotypic set of behaviors to another 
strain resulted in the recipient strain exhibiting the behavioral 
phenotype of the donor (Bercik et al., 2011a; Collins et al., 2013). 
Ongoing research continues to demonstrate in humans that the 
composition of the microbiota has a dramatic influence on the 
behavior of the individual. For example, the composition of the 
mucosal microbiota of cirrhotic patients was linked to poor cog-
nition (Bajaj et al., 2012).

Much  of  our  understanding  related  to  how  microbiota  may 
influence  behavior  comes  from  animal  studies  that  manipulate 
the  composition  and  diversity  of  gut  microbiota. The  germ-free 
(GF)  mouse  has  been  a  useful  animal  model  to  help  determine 
the  domains  of  behavior  that  are  influenced  by  microbiota. The 
GF  mouse  model  was  established  in  1957,  where  GF  mice  are 
raised in sterile/gnotobiotic environments and have no commen-
sal  bacteria  (Gustafsson  et  al.,  1957;  Gustafsson,  1959).  Both  the 
mucosal and the systemic immune systems of GF mice are imma-
ture, with reduced numbers of B lymphocytes and T lymphoctyes 
(Macpherson and Harris, 2004). A landmark study showed that GF 
mice  have  exaggerated  stress-reactivity  in  response  to  restraint 
stress,  revealed  by  increased  plasma  corticosterone  and  plasma 
adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels compared to specific patho-
gen-free (SPF) mice (Sudo et al., 2004). This publication was really 
the stimulus for neuroscientists to consider the GF mouse model 
(Sudo et al., 2004). The question arose as to whether or not GF mice 
would  show  an  altered  behavioral  phenotype.  Several  research 
groups have examined behavior in germ-free mice; these studies 
are summarized in Table 1. Across these studies, some common 
findings have emerged. First of all, GF mice show reduced anxiety-
like  behavior,  compared  to  conventionally-housed  mice,  in  the 
elevated  plus  maze  (EPM)  and  light/dark  test  (Heijtz  et  al.,  2011; 
Neufeld et al., 2011b; Clarke et al., 2013). Second of all, reconstitu-
tion of GF mice with strain-matched microbiota early in life is able 
to normalize many of the behaviors (Heijtz et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 
2013),  whereas  reconstitution  of  GF  mice  in  adulthood  was  not 
able to change the reduced trait anxiety–like phenotype observed 
in the EPM (Neufeld et al., 2011a). Interestingly, one can argue that 
the behavioral phenotype is linked directly to the microbiota, as 
the  transfer  of  SPF  Balb/C  microbiota  to  GF  Swiss Webster  (SW) 
mice reduced exploratory behavior compared to normal SW mice, 
while transfer of SPF SW microbiota to GF Balb/C mice increased 
exploratory  behavior  compared  to  normal  Balb/C  mice  (Bercik 
et al., 2011a). In stress-sensitive F344 rats, GF rats showed reduced 
social  interaction,  reduced  center  entries  in  the  open  field  (OF), 
and increased time spent in the corners of the OF (Crumeyrolle-
Arias  et  al.,  2014). These  observations  are  opposite  the  explora-
tory  and  anxiety-like  differences  mentioned  above  in  several 
non–stress sensitive strains of mice; however, these observations 
parallel social behavior deficits that have been reported in GF SW 
mice (Desbonnet et al., 2013). Together, the above studies identify 
both  exploratory  and  anxiety-like  behaviors  and  social  behavior 
as  domains  that  are  influenced  by  microbiota.  The  suggestion 
that strains modulate the influence of microbiota is important to 
consider  and  was  addressed  in  a  recent  paper  using  stress-sen-
sitive Balb/C mice. Researchers compared GF Balb/C mice to the 
offspring of conventionalized GF Balb/C mice (EX-GF) and showed 
less anxiety-like behavior in EX-GF mice in both the OF and in the 
marble  burying  test  (Nishino  et  al.,  2013).  Monoassociation  with 
Clostridium  coccoides  also  reduced  anxiety-like  behavior,  whereas 
monoassociation  with  Bifido  infantis  showed  reduced  activity  in 
the OF and no changes in anxiety-like behavior compared to GF 
mice (Nishino et al., 2013). Understanding which microbiota spe-
cifically influence behavior is a central theme of ongoing research 
in this area.

Probiotic Studies in Animals

Several groups have examined the effect of probiotic adminis-
tration on behavior. Initial reports in rats showed no effect of 
probiotic administration to healthy rats. First, administration of 
Lactobacillus salivarius, B. infantis, or B. breve to healthy Sprague-
Dawley  or  Wistar  rats  had  no  effect  on  open  field  behavior 

(McKernan  et  al.,  2010).  Second,  administration  of  B.  infantis 
to  healthy  Sprague-Dawley  rats  showed  no  effect  on  depres-
sive-like  behavior  in  the  forced  swim  test  (FST;  Desbonnet 
et  al.,  2008):  however,  45  days  of  treatment  with  B.  infantis  in 
rats  exposed  to  early-life  maternal  separation  normalized 
stress-induced depressive-like behavior in the FST (Desbonnet 
et al., 2010). Similarly, probiotic treatment has been shown to 
be beneficial in animal models of infection and colitis (Bercik 
et al., 2010, 2011b). Specifically, administration of L. rhamnosous 
for  10  days  normalized  anxiety-like  behavior  induced  by  the 
parasite  Trichuris  muris  (Bercik  et  al.,  2011b)  and  administra-
tion  of  B.  longum  for  14  days  normalized  anxiety-like  behav-
ior  induced  by  dextran  sodium  sulphate  colitis  (Bercik  et  al., 
2011b).  Interestingly,  a  few  studies  have  reported  a  change  in 
behavior when probiotics are administered to healthy rodents. 
For  example,  28-day  administration  of  L.rhamnosous  to  Balb/C 
mice  resulted  in  reduced  anxiety-like  behavior  in  the  EPM 
and reduced depressive-like behavior in the FST (Bravo et al., 
2011). It has also been shown that B. Breve and B. Longum both 
significantly  reduced  anxiety-related  behaviors,  albeit  with 
different  profiles  (Savignac  et  al.,  2014),  and  the  latter  strain, 
but not former, enhanced cognitive function in healthy Balb/C 
mice (Savignac et al., 2015). Also, 14-day administration of the 
combination  of  L.  helveticus  and  B.  longum  reduced  anxiety-
like  behavior  in  the  defensive  marble  burying  test  in  Wistar 
rats  (Messaoudi  et  al.,  2011a).  Interestingly,  administration 
of  this  combination  of  probiotics  to  healthy  human  subjects 
showed  a  beneficial  effect  on  anxiety  and  depression  meas-
ures  (Messaoudi  et  al.,  2011b).  Other  combinations  of  probi-
otics  have  been  shown  to  reduce  a  sad  mood  triggered  by  a 
psychological stimulus (Steenbergen et al., 2015) and to reduce 
depression  anxiety  and  stress  scales  whilst  modulating  the 
hypothalamic  pituitary  adrenal  (HPA)  axis  in  petrochemical 
workers (Mohammadi et al., 2015).

Microbiota, Immune Signaling, and 
the Brain

While  several  gut-brain  pathways  are  suggested  to  play  a  role 
in microbiota-to-brain signaling (Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Foster 
and  McVey  Neufeld,  2013),  this  CINP  symposium  presented 
key findings related to the role of immune signaling in behav-
ior.  Researchers  in  psychiatry  and  behavioral  neuroscience 
are  increasingly  recognizing  the  importance  of  the  adaptive 
immune  system  in  behavior.  Recombinase-activating  gene-1 
(RAG-1) is a component of the adaptive immune recombination 
system (Chun et al., 1991). Deletion of RAG-1 results in the abil-
ity of lymphocytes to execute VDJ recombination, a mechanism 
of genetic recombination that rearranges variable (V), joining (J), 
and diversity (D) gene segments to create diversity in the varia-
ble chain of the T cell receptor. This deletion generates mice that 
lack mature T and B cells, thus silencing the adaptive immune 
system (Mombaerts et al., 1992). RAG1-/- mice (Cushman et al., 
2003) show reduced anxiety-like behavior. Mice lacking both β-2 
microglobulin and transporters associated with the antigen pro-
cessing genes (β2M−/−TAP−/−), resulting in the loss of functional 
class I major histocompatability complex (MHC) molecules and 
depleted  CD8 T  cells  (Sankar  et  al.,  2012),  show  no  differences 
in time spent in the open arm of the EPM; however, they show 
increased risk assessment behaviors (Sankar et al., 2012). Mice 
lacking T cell receptor β and δ chains (TCRβ-/-δ-/-) and deficient 
of  T  cells  showed  reduced  anxiety-like  behavior  in  the  EPM, 
light/dark  test,  and  OF,  whereas  these  behavioral  differences 
are  not  observed  in  B  cell  deficient  mice  (Rilett  et  al.,  2015).  In

the study with β2M−/−TAP−/− mice we observed a loss of sexual 
dimorphism in activity, exploratory, and anxiety-like behaviors 
compared to B6 mice (Sankar et al., 2012). This was also observed 
in TCRβ-/- δ-/- mice (Rilett et al., 2015). Considering the evidence 
of sexual dimorphisms in immune functioning (Weinstein et al., 
1984; Da Silva, 1999; De Leon-Nava et al., 2009), it is seems rea-
sonable  and  necessary  to  further  examine  a  role  for  immune 
phenotype in sex differences in behavior.

Microbiota Produce Neurochemicals that 
Affect the Brain

In  many  of  the  studies  that  have  addressed  mechanisms  by 
which microbes can influence behavior, the conclusions are that 
such mechanisms involve the immune system to some degree, 
as noted in the above section. This is not surprising given that 
such studies often involve the administration of a microorgan-
ism  in  a  manner  that  nearly  guarantees  an  immune  system 
response. However, mechanisms by which microbiota-gut-brain 
communication  can  occur  that  are  non-immune  mediated  are 
becoming an area of growing research interest (Lyte and Cryan, 
2014a).

The ability of bacteria to produce and recognize neurochem-
icals  (Lyte,  2013)  provides  a  mechanistic  basis  with  which  to 
examine  the  ability  of  the  microbiota  to  influence  the  micro-
biome-gut-brain axis. The recognition that prokaryotic, as well 
as  eukaryotic,  microorganisms  produce,  as  well  as  possess, 
receptors for a wide range of neuroendocrine hormones has in 
fact been known for decades (for reviews see Lenard, 1992, and 
Roshchina, 2010). The range of neurohormones that are found in 
microorganisms is extremely diverse, ranging from somatosta-
tin to acetylcholine to progesterone. Critically, microorganisms 
which inhabit the gastrointestinal tract are capable of producing 
neurochemicals that can bind to host receptors (intra- and extra-
intestinal)  in  sufficient  quantities  to  effect  neurophysiological 
changes  in  the  host.  Asano  et  al.  (2012)  established  that  the 
microbiota is capable of the in situ production of the biologically 
active  neuroendocrine  hormones  dopamine  and  norepineph-
rine, in quantities large enough to affect host neurophysiology.

Production and recognition of neurochemicals that are more 
commonly associated with mammals by prokaryotic and eukar-
yotic microorganisms has led to a new understanding of an evo-
lutionary-based  mechanism  by  which  microbes  can  influence 
host behavior and vice versa: namely, microbial endocrinology 
(Lyte,  2014a,  2014b;  Lyte  and  Cryan,  2014b).  Microbial  endocri-
nology represents the intersection of the fields of microbiology 
and neurophysiology and had its beginnings in the demonstra-
tion that neurochemicals produced by the host during periods 
of stress, such as the biogenic amine norepinephrine, could dra-
matically increase the growth of bacteria both in vitro and in vivo 
(for review see Lyte, 2010).

Given that bacteria are prolific producers of neuroendocrine 
hormones, as well as other neuroactive compounds (Holzer and 
Farzi,  2014),  it  would  seem  reasonable  to  conclude  that  such 
bacterial production of neuroactive compounds within the gut 
lumen  could  influence  either  host-specific  neural  receptors 
within the gut or extra-intestinal neuronal sites following lumi-
nal  uptake  into  the  portal  circulation. There  are  a  number  of 
reports that provide support that neurochemical production by 
bacteria  within  the  gut  can  influence  behavior  in  both  human 
and animal model systems (Bravo et al., 2011; Messaoudi et al., 
2011a; Collins et al., 2013). Most often, these reports employ pro-
biotic  bacteria,  such  as  Lactobacillus  or  Bifidobacterium:  many  of 

the species belonging to these two genera are prolific producers 
of  neurochemicals  for  which  well-defined  neural  mechanisms 
are  known  and  by  which  behavior  may  be  modulated.  Of  par-
ticular  interest,  Bravo  and  colleagues  (2011)  observed  reduced 
anxiety-like  and  depressive-like  behavior  in  mice  fed  the  pro-
biotic  strain  L.  rhamnosus  (JB-1).  Following  probiotic  adminis-
tration, they were able to demonstrate changes in the levels of 
GABAAα2 mRNA in those brain regions associated with the spe-
cific behavior (Bravo et al., 2011). Although they did not quantify 
the amount of GABA produced by the administered L. rhamnosus 
(JB-1)  strain,  the  demonstration  of  a  mechanism  such  as  that 
mediated  via  central  GABA  receptor  expression  provides  evi-
dence that the ability of bacteria to influence behavior can occur 
through a neurochemical-mediated route.

And as to whether bacteria are capable of producing enough 
quantities of neurochemicals to affect behavior, a recent study 
that employed the GABA-producing Lactobacillus brevis FPA 3709 
amply demonstrates that ability. In this functional food study, 
L.  brevis  was  used  to  enrich  black  soybean  milk  with  GABA, 
which was then fed to rats subjected to the FST (Ko et al., 2013). 
The  FST,  in  which  animals  are  placed  in  a  water-containing 
glass  cylinder  and  the  duration  of  immobility  before  the  ani-
mals  begin  to  swim  is  measured,  is  a  well-recognized  test  of 
depressive-like behavior. In this study, the GABA-enriched soy-
bean  milk  significantly  reduced  the  immobility  time  before 
the  rats  began  to  swim  and  was  as  effective  as  the  selective 
serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  fluoxetine  as  an  antidepressant 
(Ko  et  al.,  2013). The  use  and  design  of  probiotics  based  on  a 
microbial  endocrinology-based  approach  has  also  been  pro-
posed (Lyte, 2011).

Microbiota and Brain Imaging

Although  much  of  the  progress  in  understanding  how  the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis influences brain function and behav-
ior has been in preclinical studies, work is now moving forward 
in  human  populations. Alterations  in  the  microbiota-gut-brain 
axis have been implicated in brain-gut disorders such as func-
tional  gastrointestinal  (GI)  disorders  (Mayer  and Tillisch,  2011), 
inflammatory  bowel  diseases  (Mayer  et  al.,  2014),  obesity,  and 
metabolic  syndrome  (Yau  et  al.,  2012).  In  addition,  microbiota 
are  also  implicated  in  non-GI  brain  disorders,  including  anxi-
ety  and  depression,  multiple  sclerosis,  Alzheimer’s  disease, 
Parkinson’s disease, and autism (Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Foster 
and McVey Neufeld, 2013; Naseribafrouei et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 
2015; Mayer et al., 2015; Scheperjans et al., 2015). Results to date 
point  to  changes  in  microbiota  composition  and  diversity  in 
patient populations compared to healthy individuals: however, 
few studies have made direct links between gut microbiota and 
brain  function.  One  approach  to  study  gut-brain  interactions 
in  human  populations  is  to  combine  manipulations  of  the  gut 
microbiota  with  brain  imaging  and  measures  of  symptoms  of 
emotion (Tillisch et al., 2013). A recent report showed that probi-
otic ingestion affected brain functions in healthy women (Tillisch 
et  al.,  2013).  In  a  double  blind,  randomized,  controlled  study, 
individuals received that test product—a commercially available 
fermented milk product that contained B. animalis subsp lactis (B. 
Lactis), Lactoccouc lactis subsp lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus, 
and  Streptococcus  thermophiles—a  non-fermented  dairy  product, 
or no treatment (Tillisch et al., 2013). This probiotic combination 
was previously shown to have no impact on the composition of 
the gut microbiota, but did modulate some metabolic pathways 
involved  in  polysaccharide  degradation,  including  amino  acid 
metabolism (McNulty et al., 2011). Interestingly, consumption of 

the  test  product  containing  probiotics  for  4  weeks  was  associ-
ated  with  reduced  engagement  of  an  extensive  brain  network 
in response to an emotion recognition task (Tillisch et al., 2013). 
The  widely  distributed  brain  network  was  increased  in  the  no 
treatment group, not different in the individual who consumed 
the control product, and decreased in those who consumed the 
probiotic mixture (Tillisch et al., 2013). Ongoing work in the field 
of brain imaging includes an approach to connect gut microbial 
ecology  (Saulnier  et  al.,  2011)  with  large-scale  brain  networks 
(Irimia and Van Horn, 2013). Such approaches will aid in our abil-
ity to determine how the microbiome influences brain function 
and to potentially identify multiple mediators of the gut-brain 
axis.

Experimental Challenges Ahead

The past 5 years have seen an amazing increase in our knowl-
edge of how bacteria signal to the brain and the implications 
this  has  for  psychiatry. There  are  still  many  open  questions, 
however. Firstly, the mechanisms of how the microbiota sig-
nals to the brain are only slowly being unraveled. The studies 
that  have  been  performed  to  date  have  not  yet  conclusively 
demonstrated  that  a  microbial  endocrinology-based  mecha-
nism  can  account  for  the  observed  ability  of  the  gut  micro-
biota  to  influence  behavior.  We  are  at  the  very  early  stages 
of  research,  which  will  need  to  employ  experimental  rigor 
that must be employed to unequivocally demonstrate that it 
is the actual production of a neurochemical in vivo by a spe-
cific  microorganism,  and  not  a  non-neurochemical  aspect  of 
the microorganism, such as a cell wall component interacting 
with immune cells in the gut, that is responsible for a specific 
change in behavior. Further, receptor-specific binding within 
the  gut  or  extra-intestinal  site  must  be  demonstrated  for 
the  specific  neurochemical  produced  by  the  microorganism. 
Recently,  a  step-by-step  experimental  approach  was  intro-
duced  to  guide  the  experimental  design  for  probiotics  that 
seek to examine such microbial endocrinology–based mecha-
nisms  (Lyte,  2011).  Such  experiments  are  currently  under-
way in a number of laboratories, and will provide a definitive 
answer.

Secondly,  the  individual  components  of  bacteria  that  are 
mediating  their  effects  need  to  be  disentangled.  As  the  field 
continues to consider composition and diversity of the micro-
biota in natural, clinical, and experimental settings, the evolv-
ing  field  of  metabolomics  is  advancing  and  assisting  in  our 
ability  to  better  understand  the  signaling  cascades  and  roles 
of bacterial products.

Thirdly, as most of the studies to date have been in rodents, 
further  human  studies  are  needed  to  determine  if  bacteria-
based interventions can indeed have a positive effect on men-
tal  health,  a  so-called  psychobiotic  effect  (Dinan  et  al.,  2013). 
Although some preliminary studies have focused on the altered 
composition  of  the  microbiota  in  depression  and  autism,  the 
time is now ripe for a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota 
in other disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety, drug addic-
tion,  and  eating  disorders  (Bach-Mizrachi  et  al.,  2006;  Dinan 
et al., 2014; Leclercq et al., 2014; Burokas et al., 2015; Fond et al., 
2015; Nemani et al., 2015), followed by mechanistic studies that 
will determine if such changes have any causal relationship to 
psychiatric symptomatology.
