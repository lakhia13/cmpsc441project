Abstract 

Background

Increasing evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of 
depression, supporting insomnia intervention as a promising approach to prevent depres-
sion in youth. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of app-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in preventing future onset of major 
depressive disorder (MDD) in youth.

Methods and findings

This was a randomized, assessor-blind, parallel group-controlled trial in Chinese youth 
(aged 15−25 years) with insomnia disorder and subclinical depressive symptoms. Partic-
ipants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 6-week app-based CBT-I or 6-week app-based 
health education (HE) delivered through smartphones. Online assessments and telephone

clinical interviews were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month 
 follow-ups. The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD. The secondary outcomes 
included depressive symptoms and insomnia at both symptom and disorder levels. 
Between September 9, 2019, and November 25, 2022, 708 participants (407 females 
[57%]; mean age, 22.1 years [SD = 1.9]) were randomly allocated to app-based CBT-I group 
(n = 354) or app-based HE group (n = 354). Thirty-seven participants (10%) in the inter-
vention group and 62 participants (18%) in the control group developed new-onset MDD 
throughout the 12-month follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 
0.38–0.87; p = 0.008). The number needed to treat to prevent MDD at 1 year was 10.9 
(6.8–26.6). The app-based CBT-I group has higher remission rates of insomnia disorder 
than the controls at post-intervention (52% versus 28%; relative risk 1.83 [1.49–2.24]; p < 
0.001) and throughout 12-month follow-up. In addition, the CBT-I group reported a greater 
decrease in depressive (adjusted difference −1.0 [−1.6 to −0.5]; Cohen’s d = 0.53; p < 0.001) 
and insomnia symptoms (−2.0 [−2.7 to −1.3], d = 0.78; p < 0.001) than the controls at 
post-intervention and throughout 6-month follow-up. Insomnia was a mediator of interven-
tion effects on depression. No adverse events related to the interventions were reported.

Conclusions

App-based CBT-I is effective in preventing future onset of major depression and improv-
ing insomnia outcomes among youth with insomnia and subclinical depression. These 
findings highlight the importance of targeting insomnia to prevent the onset of MDD and 
emphasize the need for wider dissemination of digital CBT-I to promote sleep and mental 
health in the youth population.

Author summary

Why was this study done?

1. Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavior therapy for 

insomnia (CBT-I), has shown promising results in alleviating both insomnia and depres-
sive symptoms among patients with insomnia.

2. The existing research on insomnia intervention mostly focused on adult or older adult 

subjects. In addition, there are limited studies with adequate statistical power to demon-
strate the preventive effect of CBT-I on depression at both symptom and disorder levels.

3. Little is known as to whether digital intervention of insomnia could potentially prevent 

youth depression.

What did the researchers do and find?

1. This was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a fully automated 

app-based CBT-I in preventing future onset of depression in 708 youth with insomnia 
disorder and subclinical depression.

2. We found that app-based CBT-I was effective in preventing future depression at both 

symptom and disorder levels.

3. Insomnia was a mediator of intervention effects on depression.

4. App-based CBT-I not only improved nocturnal symptoms of insomnia but also reduced 

daytime fatigue and led to a greater shift toward morningness.

What do these findings mean?

1. The app-based CBT-I is a feasible and effective intervention for preventing future depres-
sion at both symptom and disorder levels in youth. Further studies should explore the 
integration of app-based CBT-I into clinical practice to enhance accessibility and prevent 
depression among the youth population.

2. Future pragmatic clinical trials are needed to explore the potential benefits of adapting 
digital sleep interventions in alleviating and preventing depression to advance the field 
toward personalized and stepped care approaches in community.

3. The main limitations of the current study include the inclusion of a mixture of individu-

als with and without prior depression, and a limited sample size of adolescents, albeit that 
there was an adequate overall sample size.

1.  Introduction

Youth is a vulnerable transitional stage often linked to the emergence of sleep and mental 
health problems [1]. In particular, three-quarters of mental disorders emerge by the age of 
24, with major depressive disorder (MDD) being one of the most common mental disorders 
among youth [2]. Youth depression tends to be persistent and recurrent, leading to various 
adverse long-term outcomes, including academic and social impairments, poor self-rated 
health, and increased suicidal risk [3,4]. Given the deleterious impact of youth depression, it 
is crucial to translate the modifiable risk factors for depression into an effective preventive 
strategy.

There is a growing recognition of insomnia as a significant and independent risk factor for 
depression in both adult and youth populations [5,6]. Interventions directly targeting insom-
nia, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), may have the potential to pre-
vent future onset of MDD. However, despite the effectiveness of CBT-I in reducing depressive 
symptoms in adult and youth populations [7–9], only a few studies with adequate statistical 
power examined the effects of CBT-I on preventing new-onset depression at disorder level, 
but with mixed findings [10]. For example, two prevention trials conducted in adults showed 
promising results of CBT-I in digital format for alleviating depressive symptoms among 
at-risk adults, whereas neither of these studies demonstrated the preventive effects of digital 
CBT-I for clinical depressive disorder [11,12]. On the other hand, a recent study showed that 
delivery of face-to-face CBT-I has significant benefits in preventing incident and recurrent 
MDD among older adults with insomnia [13]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether CBT-I 
(especially in digital format) can be used as an indicated prevention approach for at-risk indi-
viduals with subclinical depression [14], and whether its preventive effects can be achieved in 
youth, a vulnerable developmental period for the onset of mood problems.

In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of 
an app-based CBT-I on preventing future onset of MDD in youth with insomnia disorder and

subclinical depression. In addition, we evaluated the effects of app-based CBT-I on improving 
insomnia outcomes in secondary analyses. An app-based intervention was adopted in this 
study to address barriers in the implementation of CBT-I among youth, such as the low level 
of help-seeking and limited accessibility to healthcare system [15,16]. We hypothesized that 
(1) app-based CBT-I would reduce the incidence of MDD over a 12-month follow-up, (2) 
app-based CBT-I would reduce depressive and insomnia symptoms, as well as increase remis-
sion rates of insomnia disorder at post-intervention and follow-ups, and (3) the improve-
ments in depressive symptoms would be mediated by changes in insomnia symptoms.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Study design and participants

This was a randomized, assessor-blind, parallel group-controlled trial conducted in Chi-
nese youth (aged 15−25 years) with insomnia disorder and subclinical depression. Potential 
participants were recruited from universities, high schools, and communities in mainland 
China and Hong Kong from September 9, 2019 to November 25, 2022. They were invited 
to complete online screening assessments to confirm the presence of moderate-to-severe 
insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] [17] score ≥15) and subclinical depressive 
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] [18] score greater than 4 but less than 
20). Participants who met the screening criteria were invited for a telephone diagnostic inter-
view to ascertain the following inclusion criteria: (1) presence of insomnia disorder based on 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnostic criteria, defined as insomnia 
symptoms ≥3 times per week, accompanied by significant distress or functional impairments 
for at least 1 month, which cannot be adequately explained by another sleep–wake disorder, 
mental disorder, or medical condition [19] and (2) absence of a current diagnosis of MDD 
or a prior episode of MDD within past 2 months by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI) [8]. Additional details about inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found 
in the research protocol (S1 Protocol).

All eligible participants were randomly assigned to 6-week app-based CBT-I or 6-week 
app-based health education (HE) at 1:1 ratio, irrespective of any pharmacological treatments 
for insomnia that the participant has been receiving (Fig 1). Assessments, including telephone 
clinical interviews and online self-administered questionnaires, were conducted at baseline, 
post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups after intervention. Two additional assessments 
were conducted upon the completion of sessions 2 (post-session 2) and 4 (post-session 4) to 
evaluate sleep and mood symptoms. If participants experienced a depressive episode before 
the 12-month follow-up, they were considered as completed cases that met the endpoint of the 
study. The study was reported in accordance with the CONSORT Guidelines (S1 Checklist).
Written informed consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and above. For par-
ticipants under 18, assent from them and consent from their parent(s)/caregiver(s) were 
obtained. Ethical approval for the study was granted by Joint Chinese University of Hong 
Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC Ref. No.: 
2019.044) and Medical Ethics Committee of Peking University Sixth Hospital (Issue No. 21 
[2019]). The trial is registered with Clinical Trials.Gov (NCT04069247).

2.2.  Randomization and masking

Randomization was stratified by sex and insomnia severity (15 ≤ ISI ≤ 21 versus ISI > 21) at 
baseline. A research assistant who was not involved in the study generated the random num-
ber sequence for this trial using RAND and RANK functions in Excel with a block size of four. 
Study participants were not informed of their group assignment, although it was likely that

most of the participants were aware of their allocation based on the content of the program. 
Trained investigators who conducted telephone clinical interviews were masked to group 
allocation.

2.3.  Intervention

2.3.1.  Experimental condition.  The app-based CBT-I intervention is a digital, self-paced, 

and interactive insomnia intervention program delivered through smartphones (esleep: 
Android: https://sd-oss-cdn.sumian.com/apk/eSleep_1.0.3-release.apk; iOS: Apple App store). 
It was initially developed by our research team (Li Chiu Kong Family Sleep Assessment Unit, 
Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR) and was 
modified and issued by BestCare & SuMian BioTech Co., Ltd. The program was designed to 
adapt for the language background of the participants in China. Based on a well-established 
CBT-I treatment protocol, the program consists of six sequential modules, including (1) 
overview of sleep, (2) sleep restriction, (3) stimulus control, (4) cognitive restructuring 
(targeting sleep-related dysfunctional cognitions), (5) structured worry time, and (6) relapse 
prevention (Table A in S1 Appendix). Each module consisted of 20–30 min of animated 
videos and was automatically unlocked weekly. During sleep restriction module (session 2), 
participants would obtain a “sleep prescription” from the application, specifying their sleep 
window for the next 7 days. The setting of the sleep window was based on each individual’s 
expected wake-up time and average total sleep time (TST) from the previous week, while 
adhering to the 5-h minimum rule. The sleep prescription was adjusted weekly based on 
each individual’s sleep efficiency (S1 Protocol). Participants were allowed to complete the 
intervention in a 12-week window. Individualized text messages based on participants’ course 
progress were sent to the participants regularly to remind them of timely completion of the 
treatment modules (once per week).

2.3.2.  Attention-matched control.  The control (app-based HE) condition is a health 
promotion program developed to control for the potential dosing effect of attention and 
non-specific components (e.g., expectation and contact hours). The general sleep knowledge 
session was purposively added to the program to meet the expectations of the participants, 
while it did not include any active insomnia and depression therapeutic components (Table A 
in S1 Appendix). Similarly, participants in the control group were contacted weekly to remind 
them to complete the modules.

2.4.  Outcome measures

The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD determined by telephone clinical inter-
views using the Chinese version of MINI at post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. 
The MINI has been validated in Chinese psychiatric patients with adequate psychometric 
properties (sensitivity for diagnosing depression = 92.2%; specificity = 86.0%) [20]. During 
each interview, the evaluation covered the period from the previous assessment to establish 
the onset of a depressive episode. In cases at which the participants were unable to recall the 
exact date, they were asked to indicate the closest week or month, and the midpoint of that 
week or month was used as the reference point. To assess interrater reliability, interviews were 
recorded and independently reviewed by a second investigator. The κ coefficient for interrater 
agreement regarding the diagnosis of MDD was 0.82 based on randomly selected data from 
12% (85/708) of the participants, indicating excellent agreement.

The secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms and the measures of insomnia at 

both symptom and disorder levels. Remission of insomnia disorder was determined by the 
following criteria [21]: (1) no functional impairments or distress with sleep, (2) insomnia 

PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004510  January 21, 2025

symptoms less than three times per week for at least 1 month, and (3) sleep-promoting med-
ication use less than once per week in the past month. Although the use of sleep-promoting 
medication is not a standard criterion for diagnosing insomnia disorder, it may mask the 
underlying symptoms and was thus taken into account in the current study [21]. Changes in 
depressive and insomnia symptoms were assessed with PHQ-9 and ISI, respectively.

Other prespecified outcomes included anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 

7-item [GAD-7]) [22], suicidal ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation-Current) [23], Fatigue 
(Multi-dimensional Fatigue Inventory) [24], circadian preference (reduced Morningness- 
Eveningness Questionnaire) [25], sleep-related beliefs and attitudes (Brief version of Dys-
functional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep) [26], and sleep parameters including time in bed 
(TIB), TST, sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE) 
measured by 7-Day Sleep Diary.

Adverse events related to the interventions that occurred from randomization until the 
12-month follow-up were recorded during telephone interviews by asking participants if they 
experienced any adverse events attributed to the interventions from the previous assessment 
to the current interview, and to specify if they answered yes.

In the study protocol, multiple outcomes were designated as primary outcomes based 
on the study hypothesis, including depression and insomnia at both symptom and disorder 
levels. The presence of multiple primary outcomes and the lack of a defined hierarchy may 
pose some concern to the interpretation of the major findings of the study. Therefore, we 
reorganized the hierarchy of outcomes when reporting the study results to ensure that the trial 
was chiefly judged by the outcome for which it was fully powered, namely the incidence of 
depressive disorder.

2.5.  Sample size calculation

The sample size calculation was based on the incidence of depressive disorder. As the study 
sample included a mixture of individuals with and without prior history of MDD, a 50% 
increase in the 1-year incidence of depression was expected compared to that (11%) reported 
in the previous meta-analysis on patients with insomnia [6]. According to previous research 
on self-help intervention for prevention of MDD [27] and data on CBT intervention for 
depression in youth population [28–30], we expected a 50% reduction in the incidence rate for 
the intervention group. Based on a 1-year incidence rate of 16.5% (11% × 1.5), power analysis 
indicated that 282 participants per condition were needed to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.5 under 1:1 randomization at α < 0.05 (two-tailed) with 80% statistical power. To account 
for 40% potential attrition rate, a total of 940 participants would be initially needed. In the 
amendment of study protocol, the recruitment was reduced to a sample size of 708 (354 per 
condition) based on an estimated attrition rate of approximately 20%, as the attrition rate was 
much lower than initially expected.

2.6.  Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan was finalized before the completion of data collection (S1 Proto-
col), except for subgroup analyses of the primary outcome and exploratory analysis controlling 
for potential confounders affecting the primary outcome, including prior history of MDD, 
educational level, family income, comorbid medical illnesses, and use of sleep-promoting  
medications [31], to test the robustness of the results. Analyses were conducted based on the 
intent-to-treat approach. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regres-
sion model were employed to determine differences in time to onset of MDD between the 
intervention and control groups over 12-month follow-up. Remission rates of insomnia were

analyzed using a weighted generalized estimating equations model. Weights were computed 
as the product of a missing model weight to attenuate the effect of attrition conditional on 
strata variables and group allocation [32]. The intervention effects on continuous variables 
were analyzed using linear mixed-effects model analysis with residual maximum likelihood 
estimation. In the sensitivity analyses, missing scores due to participants reaching the study 
endpoint (experiencing a depressive episode) before the 12-month follow-up were handled 
using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, as LOCF likely to be conservative 
when the target condition is expected to improve spontaneously over time (e.g., insomnia and 
depression) [33]. Mediation analyses using maximum likelihood estimation within a struc-
tural equation modeling framework were used to investigate the mediating effects of insomnia 
on depressive symptoms (the mediating effects were tested when the efficacy analysis showed 
significant differences between the two groups in depressive symptoms). Strata variables at 
baseline were included as covariates in all analyses. Data analyses were performed using the 
Stata 17.0 statistical software with standard two-tailed α of 0.05.

3.  Results

3.1.  Participants

A total of 708 youth (407 females [57%]; mean [SD] age, 22.1 [1.9] years) with insomnia 
disorder (mean duration, 3.0 years) were allocated to either app-based CBT-I (n = 354) or 
app-based HE group (n = 354) (Table 1). Majority of the participants (90%; 639/708) were 
undergraduate students or university educated. Nearly half of the participants (48%; 339/708) 
had a history of MDD, and 17% (123/708) of them had suicidal ideation in the past month as 
confirmed by MINI interview, while only few of them had taken antidepressants before (5%; 
38/708). In addition, 140 (20%) participants took sleep-promoting medications at baseline. 
The percentage of participants using sleep-promoting medications decreased in both groups 
at post-intervention (app-based CBT-I versus app-based HE, 12% versus 15%) and follow-up 
assessments (12-month, 10% versus 14%) with no significant group differences (Fig A in S1 
Appendix).

Of the included participants (n = 708), 634 (90%) contributed data to the post-intervention 

assessment, 565 (80%) completed the 6-month assessments, and 500 (71%) completed the 
assessments at 12 months (Fig 1). Attrition rates from assessments at post-intervention and 
follow-ups did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the app-based CBT-I group, 
333 participants (94%) logged on at least one session and 296 (84%) completed all six sessions 
(Table A in S1 Appendix). As for the app-based HE group, 332 (94%) participants logged on 
at least one session and 301 (85%) completed six sessions. No adverse events related to the 
interventions were reported.

3.2.  Preventive effect of app-based CBT-I on major depression

Thirty-seven participants (incidence proportion, 10%; 37/354) in the intervention group and 
62 participants (incidence proportion, 18%; 62/354) in the control group developed new- 
onset MDD during the 12-month follow-up. Fig 2 shows the survival curves for the app-based 
CBT-I and control groups. The estimates of the cumulative 1-year incidence rate (person-time 
rate) of MDD were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9% to 17%) for the app-based CBT-I 
group and 21% (17% to 27%) for the HE group. The number needed to treat to prevent MDD 
at 1 year was 10.9 (6.8–26.6). Cox regression revealed an HR of 0.58 (0.38–0.87; p = 0.008) for 
MDD favoring app-based CBT-I intervention.

After additionally adjusting for prior history of MDD, educational level, family income, 
comorbid medical illnesses, and use of sleep-promoting medications in exploratory analysis,

the risk of developing MDD remained significantly lower for the app-based CBT-I interven-
tion group compared with the controls (adjusted HR 0.60 [0.40–0.90]; p = 0.01) (Table B in 
S1 Appendix). Further analyses demonstrated that the preventive effect of app-based CBT-I 
on MDD across various subgroups was generally consistent with the effect observed in the 
overall sample (Fig B in S1 Appendix), and there was no interaction between the intervention 
effect and any of the variables that defined the subgroups (ps > 0.05 for all interactions). In 
the sensitivity analyses conducted among participants with persistent insomnia (insomnia 
duration ≥ 3 months, n = 616), all results remained consistent (Table C and Fig C in

3.3.1.  Remission rates of insomnia disorder.  Fig 3 shows remission rates of insomnia 

disorder (adjusted means and standard errors) by groups and assessments. At post-
intervention, the weighted percentage of remitters based on clinical interviews in app-based 
CBT-I group was higher than that of the app-based HE group (52% versus 28%; relative risk 
[RR] 1.83 [95% CI 1.49–2.24]; p < 0.001) after controlling for strata variables and accounting 
for the missing data patterns. Improvements achieved in the app-based CBT-I group were 
well sustained throughout the follow-up period, with higher remission rates than the controls 
at both 6-month (56% versus 44%; RR 1.27 [1.08–1.48]; p = 0.003) and 12-month follow-
ups (57% versus 48%; RR 1.17 [1.01–1.35]; p = 0.03). The results remained consistent in the 
sensitivity analysis (Fig D in S1 Appendix).

3.3.2.  Depressive and insomnia severity.  Results from the mixed-effects model revealed 

significant group by time interactions for both ISI and PHQ-9 scores (both ps < 0.001;  
Table 2 and Fig E in S1 Appendix). Compared with the control condition, the app-based 
CBT-I intervention led to greater improvements in both depressive and insomnia symptoms 
at post-session 4 (depressive symptoms, adjusted difference −1.0 [1.6 to −0.4]; Cohen’s 
d = 0.50; p = 0.002; insomnia symptoms, −1.7 [95% CI −2.4 to −1.0]; d = 0.66; p < 0.001) 
and post-intervention (depressive symptoms, −1.0 [−1.6 to −0.5]; d = 0.53; p < 0.001; 
insomnia symptoms, −2.0 [−2.7 to −1.3]; d = 0.78; p < 0.001). The results for depressive 
symptoms remained the same after excluding sleep item from the PHQ-9.

The intervention effects of app-based CBT-I on insomnia symptoms were well sustained 
throughout the follow-up period (6-month, d = 0.45; p = 0.002; 12-month, d = 0.32; p = 0.03). 
While significant group differences in depressive symptoms were only sustained at 6-month 
follow-up (d = 0.42; p = 0.009), albeit depressive symptoms remained in the mild range for

the intervention group at 12-month follow-up. In the sensitivity analyses with LOCF, greater 
improvements in both depressive and insomnia symptoms in the app-based CBT-I group 
compared to the control group were consistently observed throughout post-session 4–12-
month follow-up (Table D in S1 Appendix).

In the mediation analyses, insomnia symptoms at post-session 4 accounted for 74% of the 

intervention effect on depressive symptoms measured by PHQ-8 (excluding sleep item) at 
post-intervention (Table E in S1 Appendix). Similarly, insomnia symptoms at post-intervention 
explained 78% of the improvements in depressive symptoms at 6-month. There were no signifi-
cant residual direct effects observed in both models, indicating that the impacts of the interven-
tion on depressive symptoms depend on its effects on insomnia. While in the reverse mediation 
analysis at which depressive symptoms at post-session 4 and post-intervention were set as 
the mediators, direct effects of the intervention on insomnia symptoms were noticed (81% at 
post-intervention and 57% at 6-month), suggesting that the intervention improved insomnia 
symptoms independent of its impacts on depressive symptoms.

toward morningness, which were maintained at least up to the 6-month follow-up, except for 
anxiety symptoms. There were no significant differences between the two groups in WASO, 
TST, or suicidal ideation.

4.  Discussion

This large-scale RCT study showed that app-based CBT-I is effective in reducing future onset 
of MDD and increasing the remission rates of insomnia in youth with insomnia disorder and 
subclinical depression. The observed causal relationship between changes in insomnia symp-
toms and improvements in depressive symptoms lends additional support that insomnia plays 
an important role in precipitating the onset of depression. In addition, timely intervention of 
insomnia disorder in youth not only improved nocturnal symptoms but also reduced daytime 
fatigue and led to a greater shift toward morningness. Overall, our findings expand upon the 
results of recent sleep interventions in older adults [10], supporting the efficacy of app-based 
CBT-I in preventing depression and improving insomnia in youth population.

To the best of our knowledge, our finding on the preventive effect of app-based CBT-I on 
MDD in youth population is novel. In addition, self-help app-based CBT-I showed a similar 
magnitude of preventive effect in youth (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.38–0.87]) when compared to 
previous prevention trials that employed face-to-face CBT-I in elderly (HR 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) 
[13] and web-based psychological intervention in middle-aged adults (HR 0.59 [0.42–0.82]) 
[27]. Furthermore, the preventive effect of app-based CBT-I on MDD was generally consistent 
across most subgroups, even in the presence of baseline suicidal ideation and a prior history of 
MDD. Given that the intervention program did not incorporate any therapeutic components 
specifically aimed at directly treating depression, the mechanisms underlying the preventive 
effect of CBT-I on MDD warrant further investigation. This effect may be partially attributed 
to the ability of CBT-I to indirectly address depression through sleep improvements, as indi-
cated by the mediation analyses, or directly by targeting shared mechanisms between insom-
nia and depression, such as hyperarousal, ruminations, and worries [34,35].

As for the intervention effects of app-based CBT-I on depressive symptom severity, the 
between-group effect size at post-intervention (d = 0.53) is comparable to that reported in 
a recent meta-analysis on digital CBT-I (d = 0.42 [0.28–0.56]) [9], which was sustained at 
6-month follow-up. Although depressive symptoms of the intervention group remained in 
the mild range at 12-month follow-up, we did not detect significant between-group effects 
due to the large within-group changes in the control arm. This could be partly due to the sleep 
improvements observed in the control group, which may in turn lead to changes in mood. 
Another reason for the lack of differentiation in symptom improvements at 12 months may be 
that some participants reached the study endpoint (experiencing a depressive episode) before 
the final follow-up. These participants were removed from subsequent assessments and pro-
vided with information for further treatment due to ethical considerations. Further sensitivity 
analyses with LOCF demonstrated greater improvements in depressive symptoms in the app-
based CBT-I group at 12-month follow-up.

For insomnia outcomes, the large between-group effect size on insomnia severity at 
post-treatment in the current youth population (d = 0.78) is consistent with the findings of 
the previous meta-analysis on digital CBT-I in adults (d = 0.76) [9]. The intervention effects 
on insomnia were sustained throughout the follow-up period, albeit effect size was attenuated 
(d = 0.32 at 12-month follow-up). This decline in intervention effects was also documented 
by a previous meta-analysis [36], indicating that additional booster sessions might be needed 
to maintain long-term effects. Furthermore, the current study did not combine app-based 
CBT-I with circadian interventions (e.g., light therapy and circadian rhythm support), which 
have shown potential benefits in managing sleep and depressive symptoms in both adolescent

and adult subjects [37,38]. Given the overlap between insomnia and circadian problems in 
youth, future digital sleep intervention may need further adaption by incorporating treatment 
components typically targeting circadian problems to optimize the treatment effects in youth 
population.

In contrast to the long-term effects of app-based CBT-I on insomnia, its anxiolytic effect 

observed at post-intervention did not sustain at follow-ups, despite the close relationship 
between insomnia and anxiety [39]. This finding may be attributed to the fact that our youth 
subjects had only mild anxiety symptoms at baseline, leaving little room for further improve-
ment. Nevertheless, the mean GAD-7 score for youth receiving the app-based CBT-I inter-
vention declined from mild at baseline to a range of near normal throughout the follow-up 
period.

Our findings have significant implications for clinical practice and research. First, our 
study supports the notion of targeting modifiable risk factors, especially insomnia, to pre-
vent future depression in youth. Second, fully automated digital CBT-I has the potential to 
address unmet clinical needs, enhance accessibility, and encourage help-seeking behavior 
among youth. Further studies should consider integrating digital CBT-I into clinical prac-
tice, especially among primary care. Third, previous RCT studies that evaluated the efficacy 
of digital CBT-I in youth with insomnia were all conducted in Western culture, and the 
majority of them had modest sample sizes [40–42]. Our study further confirmed that digital 
CBT-I is effective for treating insomnia and preventing depressive symptoms and disorders 
in non-Western youth population, with substantial long-term effects. Last, previous RCTs 
conducted in adults have reported high attrition rates (about 50% at post-intervention), which 
remains as a major barrier to the wider implementation of digital CBT-I [11,12,42]. Partic-
ipants in the current study with weekly individualized text reminder based on their course 
progress have demonstrated a relatively low attrition rate (10% at post-intervention; 74/708). 
This finding indicates the effectiveness of timely reminders in reducing attrition and suggests 
that digital treatment may be preferable to youth population who have been described as 
digital native. Furthermore, a similarly low attrition rate was also observed in a previous RCT 
on digital CBT-I conducted in non-Western culture [43], suggesting possible cross-cultural 
differences in terms of the completion of intervention activities.

The current study has several strengths. First, as a large-scale prevention trial, we had suf-
ficient statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of CBT-I on depression. Second, 
the depression and insomnia outcomes in the current study were confirmed by both diag-
nostic interview and self-report questionnaires, which allow us to capture the multi-faceted 
nature of individual’s sleep and mood at both symptom and disorder levels. Third, there was a 
high attendance rate for the intervention program in the current study, with 84% (597/708) of 
the participants completing all six sessions of the intervention, which was higher than that of 
most online CBT-I programs. However, several limitations should be noted when interpreting 
the findings. First, participants in our study included a mix of individuals with and without a 
prior history of MDD, with 48% (339/708) of participants reporting a history of prior MDD. 
Nonetheless, only 5% (38/708) of them received treatment with antidepressants, and all of 
them had discontinued antidepressant use at least 2 months before the intervention, except 
for low-dose trazodone (25–50 mg) as sleep aids. In addition, the lack of interaction between 
the intervention effect and prior depression suggests that there is no difference in response 
to app-based CBT-I between participants with and without prior depression. Nevertheless, 
future randomization studies stratified by a prior history of depression are needed to replicate 
this finding and verify whether app-based CBT-I is effective in preventing both first-onset and 
recurrent depression. Second, clinical interviews using MINI were administered via tele-
phone instead of face-to-face interviews. However, MINI telephone interview has been widely 

PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004510  January 21, 2025

adopted in research contexts as a reliable method for assessing psychiatric disorders [44]. 
Third, although the assessors were masked to group allocation when conducting telephone 
interviews, it was possible that the assessors may still become aware of participants’ allocations 
based on their responses. Fourth, app-based HE with the inclusion of general sleep knowledge 
may not be a completely ‘inactive’ control condition [45], as the controls similarly improved 
in both insomnia and depression outcomes, albeit to a lesser extent than the intervention 
group. Last, the modest sample size of adolescents (<18 years, n = 10) limits the generalizabil-
ity of the findings to this age group.

5.  Conclusions

The current study documented the efficacy of app-based CBT-I for preventing future depres-
sion at both symptom and disorder levels, as well as reducing nocturnal and daytime impair-
ments among high-risk youth. These findings support the integration of digital CBT-I into 
clinical practice for the youth population.
