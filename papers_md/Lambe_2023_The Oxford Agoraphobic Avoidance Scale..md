Abstract

Background. Agoraphobic avoidance of everyday situations is a common feature in many men-
tal health disorders. Avoidance can be due to a variety of fears, including concerns about nega-
tive social evaluation, panicking, and harm from others. The result is inactivity and isolation.
Behavioural avoidance tasks (BATs) provide an objective assessment of avoidance and in situ
anxiety but are challenging to administer and lack standardisation. Our aim was to draw on
the principles of BATs to develop a self-report measure of agoraphobia symptoms.
Method. The scale was developed with 194 patients with agoraphobia in the context of psychosis,
427 individuals in the general population with high levels of agoraphobia, and 1094 individuals
with low levels of agoraphobia. Factor analysis, item response theory, and receiver operating char-
acteristic analyses were used. Validity was assessed against a BAT, actigraphy data, and an existing
agoraphobia measure. Test–retest reliability was assessed with 264 participants.
Results. An eight-item questionnaire with avoidance and distress response scales was devel-
oped. The avoidance and distress scales each had an excellent model fit and reliably assessed
agoraphobic symptoms across the severity spectrum. All items were highly discriminative
(avoidance: a = 1.24–5.43; distress: a = 1.60–5.48), indicating that small increases in agorapho-
bic symptoms led to a high probability of item endorsement. The scale demonstrated good
internal reliability, test–retest reliability, and validity.
Conclusions. The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale has excellent psychometric proper-
ties. Clinical cut-offs and score ranges are provided. This precise assessment tool may help
focus attention on the clinically important problem of agoraphobic avoidance.

Introduction

For many people with mental health problems it can be a challenge to step out of the front
door. Everyday activities – catching a bus, shopping locally, walking down the street – are
avoided. This type of withdrawal from everyday life is a common feature of depression
(Kennedy, Foy, Sherazi, McDonough, & McKeon, 2007), psychosis (Freeman, Taylor,
Molodynski, & Waite, 2019a), anxiety disorders (Saris, Aghajani, van der Werff, van der
Wee, & Penninx, 2017), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Zayfert, DeViva, and
Hofmann, 2005). Withdrawal often persists even after the mental health problem has remitted
(Davidson, Dowrick, & Gunn, 2016; Kennedy et al., 2007). Physical and mental health are
negatively affected by withdrawal (Patterson & Veenstra, 2010). Our view is that this with-
drawal is – at least in part – driven by agoraphobic anxious avoidance (Freeman et al.,
2019a, 2019b; McKnight, Monfort, Kashdan, Blalock, & Calton, 2016). Agoraphobia is char-
acterised by fear and avoidance of places or situations where escape may not be possible or
help not available (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). High rates of agoraphobic avoid-
ance have been found in psychosis (Freeman et al., 2019a), social anxiety (Knapstad & Smith,
2021), panic disorder (Goodwin et al. 2005), and PTSD (Van Minnen & Hagenaars, 2010)
suggesting that agoraphobic-type avoidance may be a final common pathway arising from
many different types of fears, including concerns about negative judgement from self and
others, panicking, and harm from others. Agoraphobic anxious avoidance of everyday situa-
tions is an important treatment target in its own right. We are trialling a new treatment for

agoraphobic avoidance in patients with psychosis (Freeman et al.,
2019b). This requires precise measurement to both identify the
presence of a clinical problem accurately and to test treatment.
This paper reports the development of an easy to use self-report
measure of agoraphobic avoidance in psychosis based on the prin-
ciples of behavioural avoidance tasks (BATs).

BATs are the gold standard for assessing anxious avoidance,
providing an ecologically valid approach that is potentially objective.
Participants are asked to approach a feared stimulus in a hierarchy
of steps of increasing difficulty, stopping the progression when anx-
iety becomes unmanageable. This provides a measure of avoidance,
based on the number of steps completed, and a measure of anxiety,
based on subjective unit of distress (SUD) ratings obtained at each
step. Versions of BATs have been used to assess anxious avoidance
in phobias (Flatt & King, 2010; Ollendick, Allen, Benoit, & Cowart,
2011), social anxiety (Chorney et al., 2008; Compton et al., 2001;
DiBartolo & Grills, 2006), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
(Barrett & Healy-Farrell, 2003; Barrett, Healy, & March, 2003),
PTSD (e.g. Saigh, 1989), and schizophrenia (Freeman et al.,
2016). However, there is a clear drawback: they are often impracti-
cal. BATs are onerous to administer, lack standardisation, and do
not lend themselves easily to psychometric evaluation. Few studies
have assessed test–retest reliability (Hamilton & King, 1991). The
result is that BATs are not used in clinical services and can be dif-
ficult to use in clinical research.

Our aim was to produce a self-report questionnaire of agora-
phobic avoidance, The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale
(O-AS), based on the principles of BATs (i.e. assessing avoidance
and anxiety in a series of steps for ecologically valid situations),
that would be suitable for use in clinical services and research.
We wanted a measure that was psychometrically robust, straight-
forward to complete, and focussed on everyday activities that are
meaningful to patients. Using data from across the spectrum of
severity, a combination of classical test theory (CTT) and item
response theory (IRT) was used to develop the scale. CTT is
based on the assumption that observed scores are determined by
a person’s true level of an underlying construct (e.g. agoraphobic
anxious avoidance) and measurement error. This assumption
underpins factor analytic techniques used to assess the dimension-
ality of a scale. In CTT the estimation of severity is based on a
count of item endorsement within each dimension. In contrast,
IRT examines the probabilistic relationship between the spectrum
of the underlying construct and the ways in which individual items
measure that construct. The differences between items are thus
accounted for in the estimation of severity, and, as a result, IRT
produces more precise estimates (Bortolotti, Tezza, de Andrade,
Bornia, & de Sousa Júnior, 2013). Our objective was to use CCT
and IRT to develop a precise measure of agoraphobic avoidance
with a robust factor structure, assess the scale’s item and test prop-
erties, and identify score ranges to aid use.

Method

Participants

We sought participants across the severity of agoraphobic avoid-
ance. There were three groups: patients with psychosis who were
experiencing agoraphobic avoidance severe enough for treatment,
individuals from the general population meeting caseness for
agoraphobia, and general population controls who did not meet
caseness for agoraphobia. See Table 1 for demographic and clin-
ical characteristics.

The patients with psychosis were the first cohort of partici-
pants from gameChange, a randomised controlled trial of an
automated virtual reality intervention to reduce agoraphobic
avoidance in everyday situations (Freeman et al., 2019b). The
main inclusion criteria for the gameChange trial were (1) a diag-
nosis of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis or affective disorder
with psychotic symptoms and (2) self-reported difficulty going
into everyday situations due to anxiety. This second criterion
was established using a screening tool,
the Brief Avoidance
Scale (Freeman et al., 2019b). Participants had to report moderate
to severe anxiety in three of the following situations: a café, pub,
GP surgery, street, local shop, and bus; and want treatment to
address this. In the gameChange sample, 93% scored above the
clinical cut-off for agoraphobia on the Agoraphobia Mobility
Inventory (AMI; score ⩾2.3).

Participants from the general population were recruited online
using advertisements on social media. The inclusion criteria were:
(i) being aged 18 years or older and (ii) resident in the UK.
Caseness for agoraphobia was determined using the clinical
cut-off for agoraphobia on the AMI (score ⩾2.3). To evaluate
test–retest reliability, 264 participants from the general popula-
tion (n = 94 with caseness for agoraphobia) repeated the question-
naire after 2 weeks. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at
the University of Oxford (R63059/RE001) for recruitment of
the general population sample; and from the NHS South
Central – Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075)
for recruitment of the psychosis sample.

Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale (O-AS) item pool
A pool of 40 items (see online Supplementary materials) was devel-
oped based on the principles of a BAT. Items reflected everyday
activities, broken down into discrete steps of increasing difficulty
‘Walk down a quiet
(e.g.
street’; ‘Walk down a busy street’). The items included activities in
varied locations (e.g. around the home, outdoors, public transport,
a GP surgery, shops, and cafés) that were either completed alone
(e.g. ‘Sit in a café on your own for 10 min’) or with someone (e.g.
‘Sit in a café with someone you know for 10 min’). The content
of items were generated through a discussion with a panel of clinical
psychologists with expertise in treating agoraphobic anxious avoid-
ance, review of individualised BATs used in previous studies, and
through discussions with the gameChange Lived Experience
Advisory Panel (LEAP), comprising 10 people with lived experience
of psychosis and agoraphobic anxious avoidance. The final item
pool was reviewed by both the LEAP and the panel of experts to
ensure completeness, relevance, clarity, and readability. For each
item, two rating scales are used. First, an avoidance rating is given
for whether the participant thinks they could complete each task
right now (‘Yes, I could do this now’ or ‘No, I would get too anx-
ious’). Second, participants rate how anxious they would feel doing
the task on a 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) scale. Higher
avoidance and distress scores indicate higher levels of agoraphobia
symptoms. The final scale can be seen in the Appendix.

Oxford behavioural avoidance task (O-BAT)
The O-BAT (Freeman et al., 2019b) is a real-world test involving a
five-step hierarchy of situations that the participant finds difficult
due to anxiety. The hierarchy is individualised for each participant
and starts with a task that, while anxiety provoking, the individual

thinks they would be able to do (green step). The next steps are
tasks that the individual is uncertain whether they could complete
due to anxiety (orange steps), and then, those that they could not
complete due to anxiety (red steps). The O-BAT takes approxi-
mately 30 min to complete. The participant is asked to carry out
each step, rate their anxiety for each step achieved, and stop
when they are too anxious to continue. It provides an avoidance
score based on the number of steps completed (0–5; with a lower
score indicating higher avoidance) and a distress rating for each
step completed from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extremely distressed).

Agoraphobia mobility inventory (AMI)
The AMI (Chambless, Caputo, Jasin, Gracely, & Williams, 1985)
includes 26 items assessing avoidance of situations due to anxiety
(i.e. agoraphobia). Items ask about avoidance of places (e.g. thea-
tres, department stores, and museums), transport (e.g. airplanes,
buses, cars), specific situations (e.g. being home alone, standing
in queues), and spaces (e.g. enclosed spaces, high places, open
spaces). Items are coded on a 1 (Never avoid) to 5 (Always
avoid) scale. There is also an option to select ‘not applicable’; as
a result, mean item scores are calculated. Higher mean scores

of the latent variable or items that are redundant as content is cov-
ered by another item), did not load onto any factor, or had cross-
loadings above 0.30 on multiple factors.

Once a final set of items had been derived, confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) for both the avoidance and distress ratings was
conducted to assess the model fit in (1) the combined agorapho-
bic group (n = 621) and (2) the complete sample (N = 1715). CFA
was conducted in the ‘lavaan’ package (Rosseel, 2012) using the
robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator for the ordinal dis-
tress scale and the robust weighted least-squares (WLSMV) esti-
mator for the binary avoidance scale. A good model fit was
determined using recommended thresholds of 0.95 (good) on
the comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Tucker–Lewis index
(TLI), and <0.10 and <0.06 on the Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA) and the Standardised Root Mean
Square Residual (SRMR), respectively (Bentler & Bonett, 1980).

Procedure

The new questionnaire item pool was completed by all three par-
ticipant groups. To assess the concurrent validity of the final
measure – the Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale (O-AS) –
all participants completed the AMI, the R-GPTS scales, and the
PHQ-9. Patients with psychosis also completed the O-BAT
(after completing the self-report item pool) and provided actigra-
phy data. Participants in the general population also completed
the GAD-7. Participants from the general population completed
all measures online. Patients with psychosis completed the mea-
sures in person with the support of a research assistant.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted in R, version 3.6.1 (R Core Team,
2013). There were no missing data for the O-AS item pool since
only participants with complete responses were included in the
sample. For the additional measures, only responses from those
who completed at least 80% of
items on that measure were
included. For questionnaires with less than 20% missing values,
items were imputed using predictive mean matching in the ‘mice’
package (Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Factor analysis
was appropriate in both samples, as Bartlett’s test of Sphericity
was significant (psychosis sample: χ2 = 8784, df = 780, p < 0.001;
general population sample: χ2 = 21830, df = 780, p < 0.001) and
the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test of sampling adequacy was
excellent (psychosis KMO = 0.94; general population KMO = 0.96).

Development of the O-AS
To derive the O-AS from the item pool, exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) was conducted using the ‘psych’ package (Revelle, 2020)
with a combined sample of patients with psychosis and agorapho-
bia symptoms (n = 194) and participants from the general popula-
tion meeting caseness for agoropohbia (n = 427). Items that were
highly correlated with other items (r ⩾ 0.8) for either avoidance
or distress scores were deleted prior to the EFA to avoid issues of
multicollinearity. EFA was conducted with only the ordinal distress
ratings (0–10) due to a greater variance in scores compared to the
binary avoidance ratings. EFA was estimated using principal axis
factoring to account for non-normality in the data (Costello &
Osborne, 2005) and oblique rotation. Parallel analysis and inspec-
tion of scree plots were used to determine the number of factors to
extract. Items were deleted if they were theoretically inconsistent or
redundant (i.e. items not fitting with the theoretical understanding

Evaluating psychometric properties
To examine the item and test properties of the O-AS, IRT analysis
was conducted using the ‘mirt’ package (Chalmers, 2012) with the
complete sample of patients with psychosis and all participants
from the general population (N = 1715). The IRT analysis used
a two-parameter graded response model (GRM) for the polyto-
mous distress scale (Samejima, 1969), and a two-parameter logis-
tic (2PL) model for the binary avoidance ratings (Baker & Kim,
2017). For both IRT analyses, outlier participants with atypical
response patterns were excluded based on extreme person fit stat-
istic scores (z < −3 or z > 3) (Felt, Castaneda, Tiemensma, &
Depaoli, 2017). The IRT parameters are expressed as a function
of theta (θ), representing the severity spectrum of the latent
trait (i.e. agoraphobic avoidance). Higher θ values therefore reflect
higher levels of agoraphobic avoidance.

the probability of

Item properties
The IRT analyses produce discrimination and difficulty parameters
for both O-AS ratings. The discrimination (a) parameter represents
the ability of each item to discriminate levels of agoraphobic avoid-
ance across the spectrum of severity. Higher discrimination values
therefore indicate that
item endorsement
increases with only small shifts in severity. Discrimination para-
meters above 1 are considered highly discriminative whilst para-
meters below 0.5 are not acceptable (Baker & Kim, 2017). The
difficulty parameters (b) represent the level of severity (i.e. θ)
that an item typically measures. For the binary avoidance ratings,
a single difficulty parameter (b1) represents the 50% probability
of endorsing that item. For the polytomous distress ratings, 10
difficulty parameters (b1–b10) represent
the 50% probability
of responding at the boundary between the 11 response options
(0–10). A higher b parameter suggests the response option reflects
a higher (i.e. more severe) level of anxious avoidance.

Using the IRT parameters, differential item functioning (DIF)
analysis was conducted to assess measurement invariance between
the genders (male v. female), age groups (16–30 years; 31–50 years;
51+ years), and sample population (patients with psychosis
v.

Significant item variance between the groups was determined by
a beta (β) change >10% or a pseudo-R2 > 0.13 (Crane et al., 2007).

Test properties
The internal reliability of the O-AS scales was evaluated using the

showing its internal reliability at differing points on the severity
spectrum (i.e. theta). The formula 1/
is used to convert
TI at specific points of theta to a value that can be interpreted
in line with Cronbach’s alpha (O’Connor, 2018). To examine
test–retest reliability in the 268 participants from the general
population with repeat data, a two-way, mixed effects, absolute
agreement intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was conducted.
Concurrent validity was examined using simple correlations
between the O-AS scores and validated measures of anxious avoid-
ance, anxiety, paranoia, and daytime activity (i.e. actigraphy data).
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences
in O-AS scores between participant groups. The ecological validity
of the O-AS was evaluated in the patient group by comparing scores
with clinically assessed avoidance of real-world situations on the
O-BAT. Items in the O-AS (e.g. ‘Order a drink on your own in a
café’) were compared to equivalent steps on the O-BAT (e.g.
‘Order a drink in Costa on my own’), and the degree of concordance
was calculated.

Determining score ranges
The expected score function from the IRT models and receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to determine score
ranges. The expected score function highlights the predicted score
at each point of the severity spectrum, and its accuracy is determined
by the fit of the IRT model to the data and the correlation between
raw total scores and theta scores derived from the model. ROC ana-
lysis assessed the ability of the O-AS scales to distinguish the patients
with agoraphobic avoidance requiring treatment in the context of
psychosis (n = 194) and control participants from the general popu-
lation (i.e. those without agoraphobia) (n = 1094). In ROC analysis,
the area under the curve (AUC) represents a tests’ discriminative
ability, with values >0.70 considered fair, >0.80 good, and >0.90
excellent (Egan, 1975). Youden’s J statistic is then used to determine
a cut-off score with an optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Deriving the questionnaire

Using the combined agoraphobic avoidance sample (n = 621), 22
items were deleted prior to EFA due to high correlations with
other items. During the EFA one item was deleted due to a low
four items were deleted due to cross-
communality (<0.30),
loadings (>0.30), and five items were deleted for theoretical

reasons. EFA on the distress score identified a single factor struc-
ture for the remaining eight items (including each of the six loca-
tion domains) that explained 61% of the variance (see Table 2 for
factor loadings). The correlation of r = 0.76 between the avoidance
and distress scores suggested that although highly related, the two
scales assess separate aspects of agoraphobic avoidance.

The eight-item unidimensional solution had a good model
fit in the agoraphobia group for both the distress (χ2 = 108.7,
df = 20, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.959, TLI = 0.943, RMSEA = 0.085,
SRMR = 0.036) and the binary avoidance scores (χ2 = 60.7, df =
20, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.988, TLI = 0.983, RMSEA = 0.057, SRMR
= 0.054). The structural validity of this unidimensional solution
was further demonstrated in the complete participant group
(N = 1715), where model fit was good for both the distress (χ2 =
180.3, df = 20, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.975, TLI = 0.965, RMSEA = 0.068,
SRMR = 0.021) and the avoidance (χ2 = 64.6, df = 20, p < 0.001,
CFI = 0.997, TLI = 0.995, RMSEA = 0.036, SRMR = 0.032) scores.

Psychometric properties

IRT was conducted using the complete sample (N = 1715). For the
distress scale, 11 participants were excluded due to high person fit
statistics. A two-parameter GRM with the final sample (n = 1704)
provided a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, RMSEA =
0.070, SRMSR = 0.024). For the avoidance scale, no participants
had high person fit statistics, and a 2PL model with all 1715 par-
ticipants had an excellent model
(CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99,
RMSEA = 0.042, SRMSR = 0.032). All eight items had residual
correlations below 0.20 on both scales, suggesting a lack of local
dependence between items. The item parameters for both O-AS
scales are shown in Table 3. Item probability trace lines and infor-
mation functions are shown in the supplement.

Item properties

As shown in Table 3, all items for both the avoidance and the dis-
tress scales had high discrimination parameters, indicating small
increases in agoraphobic avoidance lead to large increases in the
probability that items would be endorsed. Across the two scales,
the two most discriminating items were ‘Walk down a busy street
with someone you know’ (avoidance: a = 5.43, S.E. = 0.57; distress:
a = 4.45, S.E. = 0.17), and ‘Go to a shopping centre on your own
for 15 mins’ (avoidance: a = 5.36, S.E. = 0.56; distress: a = 5.48,
S.E. = 0.24).

Sinead Lambe et al.

The difficulty parameters show that endorsement of any of the
binary avoidance items was indicative of elevated agoraphobic
avoidance of at least 0.85 S.D.s above average. However, the para-
meters suggest that avoidance of the tasks ‘Stand outside your
home on your own for 5 min’,
‘Purchase an item in a local
shop, from a shop assistant’, and ‘Sit in the waiting room of
your GP/health centre on your own for 5 min’ would indicate
the most severe agoraphobic avoidance of 1.65–1.99 S.D.s above
average.

The difficulty parameters also show that, for all items, the 0–10
distress scale assessed a broad range of agoraphobic avoidance
from low to severe. High distress ratings (b8–b10, item responses
7+) on all items represented heightened agoraphobic avoidance at
over 1 S.D. above average, while ratings of 9+ represented 1.5–3.5
standard deviations above average. Notably, higher difficulty para-
meters across all response options (Table 3) suggest that distress
associated with the tasks ‘Stand outside your home on your
own for 5 mins’, ‘Purchase an item in a local shop, from a shop
assistant’, and ‘Walk down a quiet street on your own’ is especially
indicative of severe agoraphobic avoidance.

For both avoidance and distress scales, there was no evidence
of significant difference between men (n = 546) and women (n =
1128), participants in different age categories (16–30 years, n =
449; 31–50 years, n = 583; 51+ years, n = 664), or between the
patients with psychosis (n = 194) and individuals from the general
population (n = 1379).

Test reliability
The TI functions shown in Fig. 1 represent the reliability of the
O-AS as a function of agoraphobic avoidance severity (i.e.
theta). These show that the avoidance score is highly reliable for
the elevated levels of agoraphobic avoidance likely in clinical
populations, with equivalent reliability of α > 0.90 (TI = 10)
between 0.56 and 1.62 S.D. above average. However, the avoidance
score had poorer reliability at the lower end of the severity spec-
trum with a limited ability to discriminate average levels (i.e.
theta = 0). Conversely, the distress score demonstrated high reli-
ability across a wider range of severity, with equivalent reliability
of α > 0.90 between 0.86 S.D. below and 2.38 S.D. above average
levels of agoraphobic avoidance. The maximum reliability of the
avoidance score was α = 0.96 at 1.01 S.D. above average (TI =
25.8, S.E. = 0.20) and the maximum reliability of the distress
score was α = 0.97 at 0.81 S.D. above average (TI = 38.2, S.E. =
0.16). Test–retest reliability after 2 weeks in the 264 participants
from the general population was good for both avoidance [ICC =
0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–0.86] and distress (ICC =
0.91, 95% CI 0.89–0.93) scale.

Score ranges

Both avoidance and distress scores demonstrated a high level of
precision, with very high correlations between the summed total
score and theta scores (avoidance: r = 0.96, distress: r = 0.95).
Expected score functions derived from the IRT models are
shown in Fig. 1. Mean scores and the proportions of individuals
scoring above our recommended severity ranges in each sample
group are shown in Table 4. ROC plots for both scores are
shown in the supplement.

Avoidance
As shown in Fig. 1, most people did not report avoiding any of
the O-AS items, with an expected avoidance score of 0.17

(maximum score = 8) at the average level of trait agoraphobia.
ROC analysis showed the avoidance score had good discrimin-
atory power (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI 0.84–0.90). A score of 1/8
was the optimal cut-off for discriminating patients with agora-
phobic avoidance in the context of psychosis (n = 194) from
general population controls (n = 1094), with a sensitivity of
0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.87) and a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI
0.82–0.86). Avoidance of at least one O-AS item represented
agoraphobia levels of 0.62 S.D. above average and was used
to define a moderately elevated score range. Avoidance of at
least three items (⩾1 S.D.) defined a high score range and
avoidance of more than six items (⩾1.7 S.D.) defined a severe
range.

Distress
Unlike the avoidance score, most people are likely to report mild
distress for some of the O-AS items, with an expected score of
13.6 (maximum score = 80) at average levels of trait agoraphobia.
ROC analysis showed the distress rating has excellent discrimin-
atory power (AUC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.97–0.98). A distress score
of 24/80 was identified as the optimal cut-off for discriminating
patients with agoraphobia and psychosis (n = 194) from general
population controls
(n = 1094), with a sensitivity of 0.96
(95% CI 0.93–0.98) and specificity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90).
A distress score of 24 represents 0.37 S.D. above average levels of
trait agoraphobia and was used to define a moderately elevated
score range. A distress score of at least 46 (⩾1 S.D. above average)

defined a high range and a distress score of at least 66 (⩾1.70 S.D.
above average) defined a severe range.

Validity

Mean scores and correlations between the O-AS avoidance and
distress scores and measures of agoraphobia, paranoid thoughts,
depression, and generalised anxiety are shown in Table 5. The
O-AS demonstrated good concurrent validity, with a strong cor-
relation across the combined sample between both O-AS scales
(i.e. AMI).
and an established measure of
Convergent validity with related psychological problems was
also good. In the general population group, there was a moderate
association between generalised anxiety and the O-AS avoidance
scale and a strong association with the distress scales. Across
the combined sample, there was a moderate association between
O-AS scales and both paranoid thoughts and depression.

agoraphobia

Supporting the construct validity of the scale, there was a sig-
nificant main effect of participant group on both O-AS avoidance
(F(2,1712) = 408.4, p < 0.001) and distress (F(2,1712) = 1049, p <
0.001) scores. For both avoidance and distress scores, patients
with agoraphobia in the context of psychosis scored significantly
higher than the two general population groups ( p < 0.001).
Individuals in the general population meeting AMI caseness for
agoraphobia then had significantly higher ( p < 0.001) O-AS
scores than the general population controls (see Table 5).

The relationship between the O-AS and real-world behaviour
was supported by concordance with performance on the OBAT
and correlations with actigraphy data. For the O-BAT, 955 steps
from 191 participants were reviewed. Of these there were 191
steps that corresponded closely to an item on the O-AS. This
included 39 green steps attempted by 39 different patients, 80
orange steps attempted by 70 different patients, and 72 red
steps attempted by 62 different patients. There was good concord-
ance between the O-AS and O-BAT (i.e. a patient rating they
could or could not do the step on the O-AS and then completing
or not completing that step during the BAT). The O-AS showed
high concordance for green steps (82.1%) and red steps (76.4%).
Concordance for orange steps, i.e. those designed to be something
the patient is uncertain whether they can do, was moderate (53%).
Actigraphy data in the psychosis sample showed a small but sig-
nificant negative association with both the O-AS distress and
avoidance scales, indicating higher scores were associated with
less daily activity.

Discussion

The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale is a single factor, eight-
item self-report questionnaire measuring agoraphobic avoidance.
It presents everyday tasks of increasing difficulty, from standing
outside the home to sitting in a café. Each O-AS item is rated
on two separate response scales: avoidance (Yes/No) and distress
(0–10). Although highly related, these two ratings function differ-
ently. Avoidance of any of the eight items is indicative of clinically
elevated levels of agoraphobic avoidance and is highly reliable for
assessing more severe presentations. The O-AS avoidance score
will therefore function well as a clinical tool for patients with
agoraphobic avoidance. In contrast, the distress ratings are able
to detect a wide range of agoraphobic avoidance severity, from
the mild anxiety that is common in the general population to
the severe distress experienced by those using mental health ser-
vices. The reliability of the distress score was very high across the

severity spectrum, and therefore has good precision for use in
both non-clinical and clinical populations. Convergent validity
was shown with the gold standard of a BAT, and an objective
measurement of movement. Test–retest reliability was also high
for the questionnaire. Importantly, all items functioned similarly
between gender, ages, and the different participant groups. The
scale’s strong psychometric properties, the ease of administration,
and the frequency of agoraphobia across clinical conditions raise
the likelihood of significant use.

The O-AS has a number of strengths compared to existing
measures of agoraphobic anxious avoidance, the most commonly
used of which is the AMI. The O-AS is briefer than the AMI,

properties.
robust
Furthermore, O-AS items have been designed to reflect the every-
day situations that patients consider important. This increases the
utility of the O-AS as a meaningful outcome measure. In contrast,
the AMI assesses a broad range of situations but many of these are
not everyday (e.g. theatre, airplanes, high places). To the best of
our knowledge, the O-AS is the first agoraphobia measure to be
validated against a real-world behaviour avoidance task.

psychometric

There are a number of limitations. The general population
sample was recruited online and will not have been representative
of the general population. Importantly, the high agoraphobia sub-
sample from the general population was determined using scores
the Agoraphobia Mobility
from another self-report measure,
Inventory, rather than from a structured diagnostic interview.
However, we used the scale cut-off
featured in the NHS
Increasing Access to Psychological Therapy programme (<2.3;
The National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2018),
which is more conservative than that recommended by the scale
(<1.6; Chambless et al., 2011). A further limitation is that test–
retest data were only collected for the general population sample.
Sensitivity to clinically important change has also not yet been
assessed. Our view is that agoraphobic anxious avoidance is a
problem that significantly impairs the life of patients across a
large number of mental health conditions – this precise assess-
ment tool may help renew attention to the clinical issue.

Appendix

Oxford – Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale (O-AS)

Anxiety can make it difficult for people to go into everyday situations. This questionnaire is all about anxiety in everyday situations. We want to know whether
there are situations that you do not go into because of anxiety. We also want to know how anxious you think you would feel if you were in each of these situations.

For each task below please tick whether or not you could do it at the moment (yes, I could do this now/no, I would get too anxious) and rate how anxious/

distressed you think you would feel doing each task on a scale from 0 (No distress) to 10 (Extreme distress).

Example:
