The role of psychology and communication 
skills in orthodontic practice: a systematic 
review
Martin Baxmann1*, Zoltán Baráth2 and Krisztina Kárpáti3 

Abstract 
Effective communication and psychological strategies are integral to orthodontic practice, influencing patient satis-
faction, adherence, and overall treatment outcomes. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 
guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024560432), examined the role of these strategies in orthodontic 
care and their integration into educational curricula. A comprehensive search identified studies focusing on commu-
nication and psychological interventions in orthodontics. The findings emphasize that patient-centered communica-
tion enhances understanding, adherence, and satisfaction. Structured approaches, such as personalized follow-up 
reminders and digital tools like social media, have shown significant improvements in patient engagement. Psycho-
social factors, including anxiety and body image concerns, were identified as critical barriers to adherence, necessitat-
ing tailored psychological support and empathy-based communication. Additionally, gaps in orthodontic education 
were identified, with recommendations for integrating simulations, interprofessional education, and ongoing training 
into curricula to address these challenges. This review underscores the importance of addressing the psychological 
and communicative dimensions of orthodontic care, providing actionable recommendations for enhancing patient 
outcomes and optimizing educational practices. Future research should explore the long-term impact of these strate-
gies and assess their effectiveness across diverse populations.

Background
Orthodontic practice, while deeply rooted in the science 
of  dental  correction,  increasingly  demands  a  compre-
hensive understanding of the psychological and commu-
nicative  dynamics  that  influence  patient  care  [1,  2].  The 
interaction  between  orthodontists  and  patients  extends

beyond  the  mere  application  of  clinical  techniques;  it 
encompasses  the  management  of  patient  expectations, 
alleviating  anxiety,  and  fostering  trust  and  cooperation 
[3–5]. The success of orthodontic treatment often hinges 
on the precision of the technical work and the quality of 
the relationship between the practitioner and the patient 
[6].  Effective  communication  is  essential  in  explaining 
complex  treatment  plans,  setting  realistic  expectations, 
and  ensuring  patients  adhere  to  long-term  treatment 
regimens [7]. Moreover, understanding the psychological 
factors that affect patients—such as fear, motivation, and 
self-esteem—can  significantly  enhance  the  overall  treat-
ment experience and outcomes [8, 9].

Despite  the  clear  benefits,  the  current  landscape 
of  orthodontic  education  places  disproportionate

emphasis on technical skills at the expense of develop-
ing  these  crucial  interpersonal  abilities.  The  curricu-
lum  in  many  dental  schools  prioritizes  the  mechanical 
aspects  of  orthodontics,  leaving  little  room  for  train-
ing in psychology and communication [10]. This gap in 
education has significant implications for the future of 
orthodontic practice, as new graduates may find them-
selves ill-equipped to manage the psychosocial aspects 
of  patient  care.  Patients  today  are  more  informed 
and  have  higher  expectations  regarding  the  care  they 
receive, making it imperative that orthodontists are not 
only technically proficient but also skilled in managing 
patient interactions and emotions [11].

The  rationale  for  integrating  psychology  and  com-
munication  into  the  orthodontic  curriculum  is  clear. 
As  the  field  of  healthcare  shifts  towards  a  more  holis-
tic,  patient-centered  approach,  the  role  of  these  skills 
in  enhancing  patient  care  cannot  be  overstated.  Prop-
erly  trained  orthodontists  can  better  manage  patient 
concerns,  increase  treatment  adherence,  and  improve 
patient satisfaction—all of which are key factors in suc-
cessful  outcomes  [5,  9].  By  fostering  these  competen-
cies  during  their  training,  orthodontists  will  be  better 
prepared to navigate the complex interpersonal dynam-
ics that are inherent in patient care, ultimately leading 
to a more satisfying and effective practice [11].

Research  on  the  integration  of  psychological  and 
communication  skills  in  orthodontics  has  identified 
these  abilities  as  critical  to  improving  patient  satisfac-
tion, adherence to treatment plans, and overall success. 
However,  studies  addressing  this  intersection  remain 
fragmented, with limited exploration of how such train-
ing can be systematically incorporated into orthodontic 
curricula [5, 9]. While existing literature highlights the 
theoretical importance of these skills, actionable strate-
gies for their implementation and their impact on clini-
cal practice have not been adequately synthesized.

This  systematic  review  addresses  these  gaps  by  eval-
uating  the  importance  of  psychology  and  communi-
cation  skills  in  orthodontic  practice  and  providing 
evidence-based  recommendations  for  their  integration 
into  orthodontic  education.  By  systematically  synthe-
sizing evidence across diverse studies, this review aims 
to  advance  understanding  of  how  these  competencies 
can  enhance  patient  care,  treatment  adherence,  and 
practitioner satisfaction. Additionally, the findings seek 
to  inform  future  educational  strategies,  ensuring  that 
orthodontic training evolves to balance technical excel-
lence  with  strong  interpersonal  skills.  This  dual  focus 
is  essential  for  developing  well-rounded  practitioners 
equipped  to  meet  the  complex  demands  of  modern 
patient-centered care.

Methods
This  systematic  review  adhered  to  PRISMA  guidelines 
to  ensure  comprehensive  and  transparent  reporting. 
The  review  protocol  was  registered  with  PROSPERO 
(ID  number:  CRD42024560432).  The  selection  of  stud-
ies  adhered  to  well-defined  PICOS  criteria. The  popula-
tion  included  orthodontic  patients,  with  interventions 
focusing on communication and psychological strategies 
implemented  in  orthodontic  practice  or  training.  Com-
parisons included studies evaluating different communi-
cation and psychological methods or the absence of such 
interventions. Outcomes of interest encompassed meas-
ures  of  patient  satisfaction,  adherence,  and  psychologi-
cal  impacts.  Eligible  study  designs  included  randomized 
controlled  trials,  observational  studies,  and  qualitative 
research, reflecting the broad range of evidence relevant 
to the review’s objectives.

A  comprehensive  literature  search  was  conducted 
across  multiple  databases, 
including  PubMed,  the 
Cochrane  Library,  ERIC,  and  CINAHL.  Search  terms 
included  combinations  of  “orthodontic  practice,”  “psy-
chology,”  “communication  skills,”  “patient  management,” 
and  “educational  curriculum.”  In  addition  to  database 
searches, reference lists of relevant articles and gray liter-
ature were reviewed to identify additional studies meet-
ing the inclusion criteria.

Data were extracted using a standardized form by two 
independent  reviewers  to  ensure  accuracy  and  consist-
ency.  Extracted  data  included  study  design,  participant 
characteristics,  psychological  and  communication  train-
ing details, outcomes measured, and main findings. This 
structured approach facilitated a comprehensive analysis 
of  the  identified  educational  practices.  The  risk  of  bias 
in  the  included  studies  was  assessed  using  established 
tools.  The  Cochrane  Risk  of  Bias  Tool  was  utilized  for 
randomized controlled trials, while observational studies 
were  evaluated  using  the  Newcastle-Ottawa  Scale.  Two 
independent reviewers conducted these assessments, and 
any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with 
a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis was conducted to 
summarize  the  findings  qualitatively,  highlighting  key 
themes and patterns across studies.

Results
The initial search yielded 526 records from various data-
bases,  with  an  additional  455  records  removed  before 
screening.  Following  the  screening  process,  71  records 
were  assessed  for  relevance,  resulting  in  1  record  being 
excluded.  Reports  were  sought  for  retrieval  for  the 
remaining 70 records, of which 8 were not retrieved. Ulti-
mately, 62 reports were assessed for eligibility, leading to 
the  exclusion  of  41  reports  due  to  reasons  such  as  lack

of relevance (29 reports), absence of full text (3 reports), 
and  unsuitable  methodology  (9  reports).  Consequently, 
21 studies were included in the final review (Fig. 1).

The  risk  of  bias  for  the  included  observational  studies 
was  assessed  using  the  Newcastle-Ottawa  Scale  (NOS) 
summarized  in  Table  1.  The  total  scores  ranged  from  5 
to  9,  indicating  varying  levels  of  methodological  quality 
among the studies. Alhaija et al. [12] received the highest 
score [9], indicating a low risk of bias across all domains. 
In  contrast,  several  studies,  including  Choudhry  et  al. 
[13]  and  Mehra  et  al.  [14],  scored  5,  reflecting  a  higher 
risk  of  bias  in  certain  domains,  particularly  in  selecting 
the non-exposed cohort and follow-up length.

For  the  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  the 
Cochrane  Risk  of  Bias  tool  was  employed  (Table  2).  Al-
Silwadi  et  al.  [24]  and  Cozzani  et  al.  [25]  exhibited  a 

generally low risk of bias across most domains, except for 
the  blinding  of  participants  and  personnel  in  Al-Silwadi 
et  al.  [24],  which  was  rated  as  high  risk.  Le  Fouler  et  al. 
[26]  had  unclear  risk  in  several  domains,  including  ran-
dom  sequence  generation,  allocation  concealment,  and 
blinding  of  outcome  assessment,  indicating  potential 
biases that could affect the study’s validity.

The included studies varied in their design, participant 
characteristics,  interventions,  and  outcomes  measured 
(Table  3).  The  observational  studies  primarily  focused 
on  the  role  of  psychological  and  communication  skills 
in  orthodontic  practice,  with  outcomes  such  as  patient 
satisfaction, treatment adherence, and practitioner com-
munication  competence.  The  RCTs  investigated  specific 
interventions to improve these skills and their impact on 
clinical outcomes.

consistently  highlight  that  patient-centered  communica-
tion fosters better understanding of treatment plans and 
enhances adherence rates [1]. Cooperative relationships, 
built  on  clear  communication,  play  a  critical  role  in 
achieving  successful  orthodontic  outcomes  [3].  Patients 
who  feel  informed  and  actively  involved  in  treatment 
decisions also report greater satisfaction and compliance 
with  orthodontic  instructions,  resulting  in  more  favora-
ble clinical outcomes [27].

Evidence  emphasizes  the  effectiveness  of  structured 
communication strategies. For example, the use of social 
media for patient education improved adherence to oral 
hygiene  protocols  and  increased  patient  satisfaction  by 
providing  accessible,  clear,  and  consistent  information 
[24].  Similarly,  personalized  follow-up  reminders,  such 
as text messages, enhanced compliance with orthodontic 
treatment plans, showcasing the value of direct and tar-
geted communication methods [25]. These interventions 
demonstrate the potential of digital tools to bridge com-
munication  gaps,  especially  for  younger  or  tech-savvy 
patients.

Other  studies  further  underscore  the  importance  of 
communication  in  building  trust  and  fostering  collabo-
ration.  Empathetic  interactions,  where  orthodontists 
actively listen and tailor their communication to patient 
needs,  have  been  associated  with  improved  patient 
engagement and adherence [1]. Empathetic communica-
tion  can  be  particulary  useful  in  managing  expectation 
during long = term treatments [19]. Simplifying complex 
medical  information  into  patient-friendly  language  can 
also  significantly  reduce  confusion  and  increase  compli-
ance,  particularly  in  long-term  orthodontic  treatments 
[27].  Trust  and  cooperation  between  orthodontists  and 
patients are strengthened when communication is empa-
thetic and consistent, as shown by research emphasizing 
the importance of establishing rapport throughout treat-
ment [5]. By adopting patient-centered strategies and lev-
eraging digital tools, orthodontists can not only enhance 
patient  experiences  but  also  achieve  better  clinical  out-
comes.  This  underscores  the  importance  of  addressing 
individual  needs  through  empathetic  and  structured 
communication.

Challenges in orthodontic communication

Barriers  to  effective  communication  in  orthodontic 
practice often hinder patient understanding and engage-
ment. One common challenge is the use of overly techni-
cal  language,  which  can  make  it  difficult  for  patients  to 
comprehend  their  treatment  options  and  plans  [1].  For 
example,  patients  may  struggle  to  grasp  the  specifics  of 
orthodontic  procedures  when  discussions  are  domi-
nated by jargon, leading to confusion and reduced adher-
ence  to  treatment  protocols  [27].  Additionally,  some 

orthodontists dominate conversations, limiting opportu-
nities for patient input and questions. This lack of patient 
involvement  in  decision-making  processes  can  result  in 
feelings of alienation and decreased satisfaction [1].

Interprofessional  communication  presents  its  own 
challenges,  particularly  in  complex  cases  requiring  col-
laboration with other healthcare professionals. Inconsist-
ent  communication  methods,  such  as  reliance  on  email 
or  written  reports  by  orthodontists  versus  phone  calls 
preferred  by  general  dentists,  can  result  in  miscommu-
nication or delays in sharing critical patient information 
[18]. Ensuring alignment among all involved profession-
als  is  crucial  for  optimizing  patient  outcomes  and  pre-
venting potential complications [7].

Addressing  these  challenges  requires  orthodontists  to 
adopt  simplified,  patient-friendly  language  and  encour-
age active participation in treatment discussions. Studies 
suggest  that  fostering  two-way  communication  not  only 
enhances patient understanding but also builds trust and 
cooperation,  key  components  of  successful  orthodon-
tic  care  [27].  Moreover,  implementing  consistent  com-
munication  protocols  between  healthcare  providers  can 
facilitate  timely  and  coordinated  care,  reducing  the  risk 
of errors or misunderstandings in complex cases [7, 18].

Psychosocial factors influencing orthodontic outcomes

factors, 

Psychosocial 
including  anxiety,  depression, 
and  body  image  concerns,  significantly  impact  patient 
adherence  and  satisfaction  with  orthodontic  treatment. 
Patients  with  higher  levels  of  anxiety  often  demonstrate 
lower  compliance  with  prescribed  regimens,  highlight-
ing  the  need  for  orthodontists  to  address  these  under-
lying  psychological  barriers  [12,  23].  Managing  anxiety 
before  and  during  procedures  such  as  orthognathic  sur-
gery has been shown to improve patient experiences and 
treatment outcomes [16]. Similarly, body image concerns 
can affect a patient’s willingness to engage in or continue 
treatment, particularly when long-term results are uncer-
tain [28].

Personality  traits,  such  as  perfectionism  or  low  self-
esteem,  further  influence  patient  cooperation.  Studies 
have  shown  that  patients  with  perfectionist  tendencies 
may  have  heightened  concerns  about  treatment  out-
comes,  leading  to  increased  anxiety  and  reduced  adher-
ence  [17].  Incorporating  psychological  evaluations  into 
routine care enables orthodontists to identify patients at 
risk of non-compliance due to these factors and provide 
targeted support, such as reassurance and tailored com-
munication strategies [21].

Social support systems also play a pivotal role in treat-
ment  success.  Patients  with  strong  familial  or  peer  sup-
port are more likely to adhere to treatment plans, as these 
networks  provide  encouragement  and  accountability 

 Baxmann et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1472 

Page 8 of 10

[29].  Psychological  support  provided  throughout  treat-
ment can significantly reduce anxiety and improve adher-
ence, particularly in complex orthodontic cases [20].

Adopting  cautious  and  individualized  approaches  to 
patient communication enhances adherence and satisfac-
tion,  particularly  in  long-term  treatment  regimens  [14]. 
Orthodontists  must  not  only  recognize  these  challenges 
but  also  actively  incorporate  strategies  such  as  motiva-
tional  interviewing  and  empathy-based  communica-
tion  to  reduce  patient  anxiety  and  improve  adherence 
[30].  Cultural  considerations,  as  highlighted  in  studies 
addressing diverse patient populations, further influence 
treatment adherence and outcomes [22].

Educational implications for orthodontic training

The  integration  of  communication  and  psychological 
skills  into  orthodontic  training  is  essential  for  prepar-
ing practitioners to meet the complex demands of mod-
ern patient-centered care. Current orthodontic curricula 
often  prioritize  technical  proficiency,  leaving  graduates 
underprepared  to  manage  the  psychosocial  aspects  of 
patient  care  [10].  This  gap  has  significant  implications, 
as  effective  communication  and  emotional  intelligence 
are critical for fostering trust, enhancing adherence, and 
achieving successful outcomes [7, 13].

Hands-on  demonstrations  with  patients  have  been 
shown  to  improve  their  understanding  and  compliance 
with  treatment  protocols  [26].  Simulated  patient  inter-
actions,  for  instance,  provide  students  with  opportuni-
ties  to  practice  empathetic  communication  and  receive 
immediate  feedback,  improving  their  ability  to  navigate 
real-world  patient  scenarios  [7,  28].  Additionally,  the 
use of digital tools, such as Oral Health Education Com-
ics (OHEC), has been shown to enhance communication 
skills  by  helping  students  simplify  complex  information 
into accessible formats for patients [23].

Interprofessional education also plays a critical role in 
fostering  effective  collaboration  between  orthodontists 
and  other  healthcare  professionals.  Training  programs 
that include team-based scenarios or joint sessions with 
medical  and  dental  professionals  have  been  shown  to 
improve  communication  across  disciplines,  reducing 
miscommunication  and  ensuring  coordinated  care  [13, 
18]. These  collaborative  experiences  prepare  students  to 
navigate multidisciplinary teams in their future practices.
Ongoing  professional  development  is  equally  impor-
tant.  Regular  workshops  and  online  training  modules 
on communication and psychological care enable ortho-
dontists to stay current with emerging best practices and 
address  evolving  patient  expectations  [15].  Programs 
focusing on conflict resolution, delivering difficult news, 
and managing patient anxiety are particularly valuable for 
improving practitioner confidence and patient outcomes.

By  embedding  communication  and  psychological 
training  into  both  initial  education  and  continuing  pro-
fessional  development,  orthodontic  programs  can  bet-
ter  equip  practitioners  to  deliver  patient-centered  care. 
These  skills  are  as  critical  as  technical  proficiency  in 
ensuring  successful  treatment  outcomes  and  should  be 
emphasized throughout the curriculum [13, 15].

Future directions

While this review highlights the critical role of commu-
nication and psychological skills in orthodontic practice, 
several  gaps  in  the  current  literature  warrant  further 
exploration.  One  key  area  is  the  long-term  impact  of 
communication  training  on  patient  outcomes.  Although 
existing studies demonstrate immediate benefits, such as 
improved adherence and satisfaction, research is needed 
to determine whether these effects persist over the course 
of multi-year orthodontic treatments [23, 28].

Another avenue for future investigation is the relation-
ship  between  specific  psychological  factors  and  treat-
ment  adherence.  For  instance,  while  anxiety  and  body 
image  concerns  are  well-documented,  additional  studies 
could  explore  how  traits  like  perfectionism  or  resilience 
influence  compliance  and  satisfaction  [17,  21].  Identify-
ing  these  relationships  may  inform  the  development  of 
tailored  interventions  to  address  diverse  patient  needs 
more effectively.

The  integration  of  digital  tools  into  orthodontic  care 
also  presents  opportunities  for  innovation.  Research 
into  how  newer  technologies—such  as  telehealth  plat-
forms, mobile applications, or gamified patient education 
tools—can  enhance  communication  and  engagement  is 
particularly timely [23, 24]. Such studies could guide the 
adoption  of  technology-driven  approaches  to  improve 
accessibility and efficiency in patient care.

Finally,  future  work  should  examine  the  effectiveness 
of  interdisciplinary  education  and  collaboration.  Under-
standing  how  joint  training  programs  impact  commu-
nication  between  orthodontists  and  other  healthcare 
professionals  could  provide  valuable  insights  into  opti-
mizing team-based care and improving patient outcomes 
[13, 18].

By addressing these gaps, future research can build on 
the findings of this review, further advancing the role of 
communication and psychological skills in orthodontics. 
Such efforts are essential for fostering a holistic, patient-
centered approach to care that balances technical exper-
tise with interpersonal proficiency.

Limitations

This  review  did  not  directly  assess  clinical  outcomes, 
which  may  limit  its  applicability  to  treatment  success 
metrics.  However,  its  emphasis  on  psychological  and 

Baxmann et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1472 

Page 9 of 10

communication  factors  provides  valuable  insights  into 
addressing  patient-centered  challenges  in  orthodon-
tic  practice.  Variability  in  study  design  and  quality,  as 
reflected  in  the  risk  of  bias  assessment,  may  have  influ-
enced  the  interpretation  of  findings,  with  observational 
studies  being  more  prone  to  confounding  than  rand-
omized  controlled  trials.  Publication  bias  is  another 
potential  limitation,  as  formal  statistical  assessments 
were  not  conducted,  despite  efforts  to  minimize  its 
impact  by  searching  multiple  databases.  Additionally, 
the  heterogeneity  of  study  populations,  interventions, 
and  outcomes  limits  the  generalizability  of  the  findings. 
Future  research  should  prioritize  standardized  meth-
odologies  and  reporting  to  enhance  the  robustness  and 
applicability of evidence in this area.

Conclusions
This  systematic  review  underscores  the  essential  role  of 
effective  communication  and  psychological  support  in 
orthodontic practice, highlighting their impact on patient 
satisfaction,  adherence,  and  overall  outcomes.  Address-
ing psychosocial factors, such as anxiety and body image 
concerns,  through  patient-centered  care  is  crucial  for 
achieving  clinical  success  and  emotional  well-being. 
Orthodontic  education  should  incorporate  interdisci-
plinary  training  in  communication  and  psychological 
strategies, led by specialists in organizational and behav-
ioral  psychology.  By  drawing  on  evidence-based  prac-
tices  from  psychology  research,  this  training  can  ensure 
practitioners  are  equipped  with  scientifically  grounded 
approaches to meet the complex needs of their patients. 
Integrating these  skills  into both practice  and  education 
will  advance  the  field  of  orthodontics  toward  delivering 
holistic, patient-centered care.
