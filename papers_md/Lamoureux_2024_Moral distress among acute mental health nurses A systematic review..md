Abstract
Moral distress has been identiﬁed as an occupational hazard for clinicians caring for vulnerable populations.
The aim of this systematic review was (i) to summarize the literature reporting on prevalence of, and factors
related to, moral distress among nurses within acute mental health settings, and (ii) to examine the efﬁcacy of
interventions designed to address moral distress among nurses within this clinical setting. A comprehensive
literature search was conducted in October 2022 utilizing Nursing & Allied Health, Embase, CINAHL,
PsychInfo, and PubMed databases to identify eligible studies published in English from January 2000 to
October 2022. Ten studies met inclusion criteria. Four quantitative studies assessed moral distress among
nurses in acute mental health settings and examined relationships between moral distress and other psy-
chological and work-related variables. Six qualitative studies explored the phenomenon of moral distress as
experienced by nurses working in acute mental health settings. The quantitative studies assessed moral
distress using the Moral Distress Scale for Psychiatric Nurses (MDS-P) or the Work-Related Moral Stress
Questionnaire. These studies identiﬁed relationships between moral distress and emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, cynicism, poorer job satisfaction, less sense of coherence, poorer moral climate, and less
experience of moral support. Qualitative studies revealed factors associated with moral distress, including
lack of action, poor conduct by colleagues, time pressures, professional, policy and legal implications, ag-
gression, and patient safety. No interventions targeting moral distress among nurses in acute mental health
settings were identiﬁed. Overall, this review identiﬁed that moral distress is prevalent among nurses working
in acute mental health settings and is associated with poorer outcomes for nurses, patients, and organizations.
Research is urgently needed to develop and test evidence-based interventions to address moral distress

Introduction

The initial recognition of moral distress within nursing dates back to the 1970s and 1980s. During this time,
medical schools were establishing bioethics courses and recognized the increasing interest from nurses and
nursing students in this area. Nursing students’ concerns differed from those of medical students, however, in
that they concentrated on feelings, practical situations, as well as nurse–patient and nurse–physician rela-
tionships.1 Andrew Jameton ﬁrst deﬁned moral distress in his 1984 text Nursing Practice: The Ethical Issues
as ‘a challenge that arises when one has an ethical or moral judgement about care that differs from that of
others in charge’.2(p. 298) Although there have been several subsequent attempts to redeﬁne moral distress,
many have been poorly delineated. Additionally, there have been subsequent difﬁculties in distinguishing
moral subjectivity from moral distress.2 With the increasing body of moral distress research, the ability to
develop a clear deﬁnition of moral distress has complicated the attempts to study moral distress. Moreover, the
rising number of cited causes, and effects, of moral distress has meant that its deﬁnition has expanded to now
being an umbrella term that lacks precision, resulting in a wide-ranging phenomenon and causes. Without a
coherent and consistent understanding of moral distress, its prevalence, effects and possible responses to
moral distress are expected to be confusing and contradictory.3

Moral distress is a signiﬁcant component of moral conﬂict which can negatively impact healthcare,
including the success and quality of care, as well as workplace culture.4 Furthermore, institutions and
professional colleagues can both impact the level of moral distress experienced by nurses and make it
challenging, or impossible, for the nurse to act on their own best judgement.5 Moral distress can include the
presence of unpleasant feelings or psychological conﬂict that arise when a clinician is aware of the ethically
correct action to take in a given situation,6 but either internal or external factors restrain them from acting
accordingly.7 Responses to the constraints experienced through moral distress include physical and emotional
exhaustion combined with failure, frustration, anger, and guilt.8 Research has shown that moral distress
ultimately diminishes nurses’ professional performance, negatively impacting patient care and nursing staff
retention.9

Moral distress has been researched within a variety of clinical areas including intensive care, paediatrics,
palliative care, and oncology settings.9 Giannetta et al.10 completed a systematic review centring on moral
distress experienced by nurses within Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Findings from this review found a
moderate level of moral distress among nurses within ICU settings. Causes of moral distress for ICU nurses
included patient-level, unit/team-level, and system-level factors, and most studies in this review highlighted
cost-control, end-of-life care, and futile care as causing the greatest moral distress among nurses.10

Eche et al.11 completed a systematic review focussing on moral distress among oncology nurses. Findings
from this review identiﬁed that oncology nurses were likely to experience low to moderate frequency of moral
distress, but a higher intensity of moral distress. Moral distress experienced by oncology nurses was a
substantial predictor for burnout, end-of-life care decisions, provider communication, inability to deliver
compassionate care, and work conditions.11

It has become recognized, internationally, that mental health nursing is a demanding professional speciality
due to workplace stressors and challenges,12 including verbal and physical aggression,13 which can have a

1180

Nursing Ethics 31(7)

negative impact on the physical and psychological health, and the wellbeing of mental health nurses.12 These
encounters not only negatively impact nurses and patients but also negatively impacts staffs’ ability to
maintain a therapeutic environment.13

Acute mental health units are inpatient settings for individuals requiring involuntary, or voluntary, short-
term treatment during the acute phase of a mental or psychiatric illness, depending on the severity of the
patient’s symptoms, distress levels, and risk to themselves or to others.7 A signiﬁcant component of the mental
health nurses’ role within these environments is the therapeutic patient–nurse interpersonal relationships.12
Nurses may experience moral distress related to restrictions placed on patients,14 including involuntary
admissions and restraints,15 working during staff shortages, observing unsafe patient care, inadequate clinical
communication, economic constraints, increased clinical acuity, and the drive for efﬁciency.16 Moral distress
has been identiﬁed as an occupational hazard for clinicians providing care to vulnerable populations, in-
cluding care to mental health patients.17 However, little is known about the relationship between moral
distress experienced by mental health nurses,14 how mental health nurses cope with repeated exposure to
moral distress,6 and the relationship of moral distress with work-related phenomena, including burnout, job
satisfaction, lack of empathy, and intention to resign from mental health units.17 The purpose of this review
was to identify the prevalence of moral distress within acute mental health units, factors associated with moral
distress experienced within these settings, and identifying the efﬁcacy of any interventions currently in place.
To address this, and other moral distress issues, the following questions were posed:

1. What is the prevalence, or level, of moral distress among mental health nurses in acute mental health

settings?

2. What factors are associated with moral distress among mental health nurses in acute mental health

settings?

3. What is the efﬁcacy of interventions designed to address moral distress among nurses in acute mental

health settings?

Methods

The systematic review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews; CRD42022343038).

Eligibility criteria

This systematic review considered primary research of all study designs and methodologies, including
qualitative, quantitative, observational, experimental, and mixed methods research. The search was limited to
peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and October 2022. January 2000 was selected as the
earliest date to capture any quantitative studies which may have utilized Corley’s Moral Distress Scale and the
Moral Distress Scale – Psychiatric Nurses within the acute mental health setting.

To be included, studies needed to meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria:

1. Types of studies. Qualitative, quantitative, observational (prospective and retrospective cohort, case-
control, and cross-sectional studies), experimental (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized
controlled trials, and uncontrolled pre-post studies), and mixed methods studies were included in this
review. Studies needed to be peer-reviewed and published in English to be considered.

2. Types of participants. Studies conducted with nurses working within acute inpatient mental health
settings providing care to youth and/or adults were included. Studies that focused on non-nursing
clinicians (physicians and allied health), clinical students, and nursing facilitators were excluded from

Lamoureux et al.

1181

this review, even if employed within an acute mental health setting. If studies reported on a mix of
disciplines (e.g. a mixed sample of nurses and allied health), studies were only eligible for inclusion if
separate data for nurses were reported.

3. Types of settings. Studies conducted in acute adolescent or adult inpatient mental health settings were
eligible for inclusion. Studies conducted in acute child inpatient mental health units, mental health
community programs, and non-acute inpatient mental health environments were excluded from this
review. Additionally, non-mental health hospital units and community programs/teams were also not
included in this review. Studies that were conducted in multiple clinical settings (e.g. acute care
inpatient and outpatient/rehabilitation units) were included, so long as the data related to acute in-
patient mental health settings could be extracted separately.

Information sources

A systematic search of health-related databases was conducted to retrieve published articles via Nursing &
Allied Health, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and PubMed. Database searches were conducted between
October 8 and October 12, 2022. A manual search of Google Scholar was also completed to ensure that all
relevant studies were captured.

Search strategy

The search consisted of three overarching themes of moral distress, nursing, and acute psychiatric/mental
health organization(s)/unit(s) with appropriate search terms and synonyms within each category to maximize
search results. The research team collaborated with three expert librarians to determine the most appropriate
search terms and reﬁned the search strategy. Finalized search terms for title, abstract, and subject can be
viewed in Supplementary Table S1.

Selection process

Endnote was utilized to manage literature search sources as well as screening of titles and abstracts. Once
duplicate articles were removed, title and abstract screening of the full search yield was undertaken by SL and
AEM. Full texts of potentially eligible articles were retrieved and reviewed independently by SL and AEM
who assessed each for eligibility. Where there was disagreement between the two reviewers regarding el-
igibility, a third reviewer (EMF) was consulted to reach a consensus.

Data collection process

Data from each of the articles for inclusion in the review were extracted by SL using a form developed by the
review team, and included author, year, country, study design, setting, methodology, methods, participant
characteristics, intervention details (where relevant), and results.

Data items

The primary outcomes were the prevalence or levels of moral distress and factors related to moral distress.
Moral distress and factors related to moral distress could be assessed using any qualitative or quantitative
assessment methods.

1182

Nursing Ethics 31(7)

Synthesis methods
A narrative synthesis approach was utilized for this review as it allows for the identiﬁcation of the causes of
particular social problems a particular community encounters and the factors that shape the implementation of
interventions.18

Results

Study selection
A total of 14,363 potentially eligible articles were identiﬁed through the search process. Of these articles,
9119 duplicates and 67 studies not published in English were removed. The remaining 5177 article titles and
abstracts were screened, with 54 articles identiﬁed for full-text screening. SL emailed the authors of three
studies to ascertain whether the research was conducted in an eligible setting (adolescent or adult acute
inpatient mental health setting). All three studies were considered ineligible as the author of one study
reported that the setting included both acute and sub-acute settings without distinguishing the results between
the settings and the authors of the other two studies did not respond. Thus, a total of 10 articles met eligibility
criteria and were included in the review (see Figure 1).

Quality appraisal

Careful appraisal of the studies in any systematic review is a core component of systematic reviews and the
Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used for quality appraisal.19 Critical assessment of the included
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies was completed19,20 and ﬁve of the six qualitative studies
met all ﬁve of the quality criteria with one qualitative study meeting four out of ﬁve quality criteria.19,20 All
four of the quantitative studies met the quality criteria.

Risk of bias in studies

Of the ten studies included, one study had one methodological quality criteria not met. Participants provided
written answers to two questions as part of a questionnaire and answers were analysed as qualitative data.
Seven themes were identiﬁed, with corresponding sub-themes.21 However, the identiﬁed themes in this
research were not supported by evidence collected. The study met all other MMAT criteria and therefore was
included in this review as it outlined moral distress as experienced by nurses within the acute inpatient setting.

Study characteristics

Of the ten studies included, most were conducted in either Japan or Norway with three studies included from
each country, respectively. The remaining four studies were from Canada, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden. Four of
the studies were quantitative, while the remaining six studies were qualitative. Data extraction from the
quantitative studies comprised of moral distress levels (including scores for frequency and intensity where
reported), and its relationship with sense of coherence, job satisfaction, general health, participant demo-
graphics,22 and burnout.8,9 Hospital ethical climate, moral sensitivity, and work-related moral stress were also
reported.23

Three of the quantitative studies utilized the Moral Distress Scale for Psychiatric Nurses (MDS-P),8,9,22 a
self-report questionnaire used to measure moral distress within the acute mental health setting. These studies
also included other self-reported questionnaire measures, such as the Sense of Coherence Scale,22 General

Health Questionnaire,22 Job Satisfaction Scale,22 Maslach Burnout Inventory,9 and the Maslach Burnout
Survey – General Survey,8 to assess the relationship between moral distress and other variables. Lutzen et al.23
did not utilize the MDS-P to assess moral distress. Instead, they utilized the Hospital Ethical Climate
Survey,23 Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire23 and the Work-Related Moral Stress Questionnaire.23

Quantitative moral distress measures. The Moral Distress Scale was initially developed by Corley et al.24 in
2001 for use in the critical care settings8 and is based on Jameton’s deﬁnition of moral distress within
nursing.24 The Moral Distress Scale for Psychiatric Nurses (MDS-P) was developed and validated by Ohnishi

1184

Nursing Ethics 31(7)

in 2010 and was based on the Moral Distress Scale initially developed by Corley and her colleagues.8,22 The
MDS-P assesses for moral distress across three different subscales: unethical conduct by caregivers (6 items),
low stafﬁng (5 items), and acquiescence to patients’ rights violations (4 items).8 Each item uses a 7-point
Likert response scale to measure either frequency or intensity of moral distress, and item scores are averaged
to produce subscale and/or total scores.8 An average score of three on the MDS-P is the mid-point, with scores
greater than three considered problematic.22

Other quantitative measures. In addition to using the MDS-P, Delfrate et al.9 assessed the relationship between
moral distress and burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The MBI comprises of 22 items
across three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, and higher
scores indicate greater levels of burnout. Likewise, Ohnishi et al.8 utilized the Maslach Burnout Inventory –
General Survey (MBI-GS).8 This scale has been used globally, and the Japanese version has been evaluated
for reliability and validity.8 The MBI-GS consists of three subscales: exhaustion, cynicism, and professional
efﬁcacy.8 Lutzen et al.23 used the Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire (MSQ), Work-Related Moral Stress
Questionnaire, and the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey to examine the relationship between work-related
moral stress with moral climate and moral sensitivity within mental health settings.23 The 9-item Work-
Related Moral Stress Questionnaire (WRMSQ) was developed speciﬁcally for Lutzen’s study to assess
general symptoms related to stress experienced within the previous month.23 The 26-item Hospital Ethical
Climate Survey was used to measure nurses’ experience of moral climate.23

Qualitative studies. Of the qualitative studies, one study utilized questionnaires which included two open-
ended questions assessing how nurses responded when encountering an ethical issue and what resulted from
their response to the ethical situation. The researchers then analysed the text answers using qualitative
methods.21 Another study utilized a dialogue approach.25 The third study utilized semi-structured inter-
views,26 which consisted of open-ended questions alongside prompts to expand explanations.26

Two studies used in-depth interviews.6,27 These researchers used in-depth interviews to obtain insights into
the participants subjective attitudes, experiences, motives, and thoughts.6,27 One study used one-to-one
interviews, however, did not describe the type of interviews completed.7 Two of these studies also utilized
focus groups.6,7

Data extraction from the qualitative studies focussed on factors associated with moral distress. Data
extraction for all studies included sample size and settings. Data extraction for both quantitative and
qualitative studies can be found in Table 1 and Table 2.

Prevalence of moral distress

Quantitative studies. Ando and Kawano focussed their research on the intensity of moral distress among
mental health nurses in mental health units.22 They reported an overall mean score of moral distress intensity
on the MDS-P of 2.11 (SD = 1.45).22 The highest subscale score was for moral distress due to acquiescence to
patients’ rights violations (M = 2.64, SD = 1.58), followed by unethical conduct by caregivers (M = 2.01, SD =
1.37) and low stafﬁng (M = 1.69, SD = 1.39).22 These researchers found negative correlations between the
moral distress subscales and both sense of coherence and job satisfaction, with greater moral distress as-
sociated with poorer sense of coherence and worse job satisfaction.22

Delfrate et al.’s9 study likewise utilized the MDS-P to assess moral distress of nurses working within
mental health inpatient, outpatient, and rehabilitation settings in Italy. The median overall MDS-P score for
mental health inpatient nurses was 2, which was higher compared to the median scores for mental health
nurses working in outpatient units and rehabilitation centres.9 They also utilized the Maslach Burnout
Inventory (MBI) to assess the relationship between moral distress and burnout, ﬁnding positive correlations

Qualitative studies. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify themes within the qualitative data. Braun and
Clarke’s inductive approach was used to identify themes based on the research presented.28 Within the six
qualitative studies, three themes inﬂuencing the presence of moral distress were found. These included
aggression and coercion, insufﬁcient resources, as well as legal conﬂict and professional approaches. An
additional theme highlighted within the qualitative studies focused on nurses’ coping mechanisms.

Aggression and coercion. There has been an increase in patients experiencing mental illness due to synthetic
drug use.7 This combination of substance use with fewer inpatient mental health beds has resulted in patients
that are admitted who are considerably more unwell as compared to patients admitted to acute mental health
inpatient units ten years ago.7 Nurses reported experiencing serious verbal7 and physical27 aggression from
patients, as well as observing physical aggression from patients towards inanimate objects and other patients,7
thus creating an apprehensive atmosphere.7 There are several factors that impact nurses’ ability to utilize
restraints, including low predictability of aggression, architecture and size of the unit, limited documentation
on when to use restraints, and the pressure to reduce the use of restraints.7 Nurses reported that they wanted to
use the least restrictive processes, ensuring that all other avenues had been utilized ﬁrst7 and also felt the need
to increasingly tolerate violence and to only utilize restraints when violence was imminent.7 Nurses reported
feeling shame and guilt in relation to not preventing patient violence or aggressive behaviour,6 safeguarding
other patients from this aggression7 and believe that they could have prevented injury to others if they had
restrained the patient earlier, leading to moral distress as a result.7

The current treatment philosophy to allow patients to de-escalate on their own also creates an ethical
dilemma for nurses as this process can negatively impact other patients and creates doubt among staff.27
Nurses expressed frustration regarding the minimal attention to patient violence and how this impacts
nurses.27 Nurses have also identiﬁed that using restraints often leaves them experiencing unpleasant feelings.7
Repeated exposure to aggression places nurses at risk for vicarious trauma, PTSD symptoms, shame, self-
blame, occupational stress, guilt, skeletal problems, and burnout syndrome.7

The use of coercion in situations that could have otherwise been resolved through improved stafﬁng or the
unit’s routines had the nurses feeling uncomfortable,27 guilty, and shameful.6 Nurses’ frustrations were also
experienced when a patient’s autonomy was limited due to their disruptive behaviour being caused by a
colleague’s communication style or personality.27

Insufﬁcient resources. Lack of time has been found to negatively impact patient care.27 Nurses reported that
time was considered essential in providing necessary care, including building relationships, engaging in
therapeutic conversations, patient motivation and reassurance, supervising patients in seclusion, and engaging
in clinical assessments.27 Additionally, insufﬁcient time inhibited nurses from actually knowing who their
patients were beyond their diagnosis and medications25 and increased nurses’ doubting the quality of their
assessments.27

Insufﬁcient competency and time can lead to superﬁcial treatment, including reduced follow-up for
patients experiencing suicidal thoughts, potentially reducing time with patients at risk of self-harm and
suicide – both of which require immense time from nurses.27 Furthermore, lack of time may lead to more
disrupting behaviours and use of coercion.27 As a result of the limited time spent with patients, participants
reported feelings of disgust25 and increased worry, vulnerability, and guilt in relation to not being able to
spend the necessary time with patients at risk of suicide or self-harm.27

Nurses reported the lack of resources frustrating and often led to patients not receiving the care they
required.6 Nurses reported experiencing inexcusable behaviour by both unskilled and professional staff,
increasing the risk of dangerous situations.6 Nurses reported experiencing challenges when delegating
suicidal patients, patients requiring seclusion, or patients at risk of increased violence to untrained clinicians
as these clinicians may not comprehend the seriousness, or have the same sense of responsibility, as

1190

Nursing Ethics 31(7)

permanent clinicians.6 The use of untrained clinicians increased nurses’ worry as they spent more time
monitoring these clinicians than they spent time with patients.6 When nurses raised concerns related to
stafﬁng issues and impact on patient safety, they were invalidated, and they reported they did not see any
changes.6 Additionally, the lack of time,25 coupled with inadequate stafﬁng,6 may have led to clinicians
viewing patients as being problems rather than individuals.25

Legal conﬂict and professional approach. Deady and McCarthy’s research found that patient care failing to meet
professional and personal criteria for best practice may lead to moral distress.26 This research found that,
overall, nurses did not feel moral distress if coercion and seclusion practices were prescribed by physicians,
legal, and applied appropriately. However, the participants in Deady and McCarthy’s research did report that
they experienced moral distress when coercion and seclusions were applied due to medical interventions
being insufﬁcient, delays in being prescribed, or prescribed inappropriately.26

Changes in therapeutic, political, and legal ideals, particularly around the treatment of mental health
patients have made it more challenging to admit a patient to a psychiatric unit with an involuntary status,
increasing the number of voluntary admissions, and the length of these admissions due to the necessity for
longer assessment periods prior to changing the patient’s voluntary inpatient status to an involuntary ad-
mission status.7 This results in nurses reporting feelings of sadness and frustration as they witnessed the
deterioration of patients’ health as these patients declined care, and had to wait for days before they received
adequate treatment and medications.7 As these voluntary patients became increasingly unwell, families did
not want the patient to be discharged; however, voluntary patients cannot be kept on the unit against their
will.6 Nurses’ reported feeling personally responsible for motivating patients to remain in hospital and to
accept treatment, and tended to utilize pressure or persuasion rather than motivation to achieve this.7

Austin et al.’s25 research found that nurses’ experiences of moral distress were often situated around the
responsibilities and expectations society had placed on healthcare practitioners. Being given such respon-
sibilities were often connected with being considered trustworthy; however, when nurses were given such
responsibilities, they were not always provided with the necessary control and power.25

Nurses perceived other members of the interdisciplinary team, such as physicians and allied health
clinicians, to have greater inﬂuence of clinical decision-making, either due to their status within the pro-
fessions or by mental health law.26 Additionally, other disciplines involved in patient care were able to move
freely and leave the unit, whereas nurses were left to spend more time with patients and observed the ongoing
deterioration of patient health.26 This became more prominent when medical care was delayed, and conﬂicts
between patients increased.26 Nurses also reported that their assessments, particularly around patient de-
terioration, were not always heard by other disciplines.26 Nurses also reported frustration with the limited
post-incident discussion,
incidents and their moral concerns remained
unresolved.26

leaving nurses feeling that

Despite nurses’ not wanting to tolerate illegal practices, participants reported they felt the need to get along
with their colleagues despite sometimes viewing their colleagues’ practice as poor.26 Participants within
Deady and McCarthy’s research reported that they found it arduous to challenge colleagues, including by
questioning the nurse’s competence or not providing support at key clinical patient cares, as it may have
resulted in being isolated from the team, even if being isolated subtly.26 Acute mental health nurses have
reported that it can be distressing to challenge a peer’s standard of practice26 and reported experiencing
negative outcomes such as feeling hurt, leading to helplessness if they did so.21

Finally, participants in Deady and McCarthy’s research reported that restricting patients’ autonomy in-
creased nurses’ moral distress.26 The example highlighted in this research included a palliative patient’s
discharge from hospital being prevented as the patient expressed interest in seeking euthanasia overseas, and
this was seen as an articulation of suicidal intent. The nurse reported feeling that the patient was being unfairly
heard and that the patient should be able to make their own end-of-life decisions.26

Coping with moral distress. The build-up of moral distress can lead to moral residue, which can, in turn, lead to
long-term negative feelings and a decrease in quality patient care. As a result, improving coping abilities is
necessary.22 Jansen et al.6 highlighted that coping mechanisms consisted of not taking work home and
speaking up versus loyalty.6

Efﬁcacy of interventions for moral distress. Exploring coping processes can lead to better understanding of the
kinds of skills, supports, and structures nurses require to identify strategies to mitigate moral distress.6 Of the
articles included in this review, none explicitly assessed the efﬁcacy of interventions, or considered possible
interventions, as part of their research. Although not overtly explored in the available research, some research
has reported that mentoring groups could be helpful to manage moral distress and that the process of ‘sorting
work’ was essential.6 It was also noted that unit culture impacts how nurses express their concerns and have
their experiences acknowledged.6

Discussion
This mixed methods systematic review examined the prevalence, factors associated with, and the efﬁcacy of
interventions for addressing moral distress among mental health nurses working in acute mental health
settings. Nurses’ experience of moral distress varies by setting.15 Nurses within acute mental health inpatient
settings have been shown to experience greater moral distress than their counterparts in outpatient units and
rehabilitation centres which may be due to working within closed environments, with restraint procedures
more frequently utilized than these other settings.9

Moral distress within mental health settings has been identiﬁed as an occupational hazard for professionals
not only because they are caring for vulnerable communities17 but also due to mental health patients ex-
periencing mental illness human rights violations16 and restrictions on patients’ freedom, including in-
voluntary hospitalizations.15

Ohnishi et al.’s8 and Delfrate et al.’s9 research found positive correlations between moral distress and
burnout.8,9 Burnout may be an unintended consequence of not detecting moral distress early15 and can
become a serious problem if failed to be noticed by management.29 For example, burnout can increase
hospital errors which in turn signiﬁcantly impacts quality of care, safety culture, and the resilience of care
providers29 and can lead to low job satisfaction and poor nursing retention.17

For the nurse, the physical and psychological effects of moral distress can be long lasting8 and harmful to
their professional and personal wellbeing.16 Moral distress can contribute to medication errors, poor
communication between clinicians, and negative work outlook.17 Further unresolved moral distress can lead
to moral residue, which results in the build-up of moral distress through subsequent experiences, making it
problematic to fully resolve the initial moral distress,30 leading to negative feelings of guilt, sadness,
powerlessness, shame, despondency, angst, resignation,7 desensitization and disengagement of clinicians,30
and negative impacts on nurse retention5 as nurses leave their work environment and nursing altogether.8
The quantitative studies included in this review showed similar results in the level of moral distress among
inpatient mental health nurses. Moral distress among acute mental health nurses was found to be low,22
moderately low,8 and medium-low.9 In comparison to other clinical areas, oncology nurses experience low to
moderate levels of moral distress, with some variations in intensity and frequency. However, evidence has
suggested that critical care nurses experience higher levels of moral distress as compared to nurses in other
clinical settings, including mental health.11 Critical care nurses may experience quantitatively higher moral
distress levels due to the complexities of caring for patients with critical needs, which is often associated with
the burden of uncertainty and difﬁculties in treatment-related decision-making.31

The severity and frequency of moral distress is associated with an assortment of factors.32 The studies in
this review found that the external factors outnumbered the internal factors. These external factors included

1192

Nursing Ethics 31(7)

aggression and violence.7,27 insufﬁcient resources,6,7,21,25–27 legal conﬂicts and professional approaches,6,7,26
as well as loyalty6,7 and support.6 Moral distress has been associated with diverse cognitive and emotional
consequences and can lead to inattention or distraction.33

Given the pervasiveness of moral distress and its potentially negative impact, organizations and clinicians
need to intervene.34 However, there have been few evidence-based interventions that have been found to
alleviate the negative effects of moral distress,35 and none have been tested with nurses in psychiatric settings.
The systematic reviews that have reviewed moral distress interventions have identiﬁed that there is limited
evidence of interventions currently in place.34 Moral distress interventions that have been implemented, have
been primarily implemented through educational and reﬂective workshops.34 Interventions to improve
nurses’ coping strategies related to moral distress include assertiveness training and education aimed to
enhance critical clinical approaches.17 Assertiveness training will allow for nurses to overcome apparent
hierarchy related challenges with their nursing and interdisciplinary colleagues. Additionally, education and
professional development is likely to increase the accountability of early career nurses and other members of
the multidisciplinary team.17 Further approaches for moral distress interventions require a more standardized
approach, utilizing validated tools, and consistent follow-up for these interventions to be considered effective.
These interventions need to be available across the hospital setting and not be unit speciﬁc given the
pervasiveness of moral distress across the hospital system.34

Limitations

The inclusion of a small number of studies published in English and the limited number of studies within the
acute inpatient mental health setting may limit the generalizability of these ﬁndings. Additionally, the studies
included in this review were from a limited number of countries. As such, cultural and geographical inﬂuences
which may impact how moral distress is experienced in these countries may not be generalized globally.

Conclusion and recommended future research

Nurses within acute mental health settings experience various factors that can lead to moral distress. These
include insufﬁcient resources, inadequate and/or inappropriate stafﬁng, relationships with other disciplines,
exposure to aggression and violence, participation in coercive care, and experiencing negative feelings
outside the workplace because of their work.

There are two areas of note that need further research regarding moral distress. First, there are few studies
that focus on interventions for moral distress for nurses who provide direct patient care. Further research is
necessary to develop and test evidence-based interventions to address moral distress among nurses and to
evaluate the effect this has on nurse, patient and organizational outcomes.36

The second area that may require additional research is how moral distress affects men versus women. The
only study to assess this was Lutzen et al.23 Jensen et al.27 did not assess the impact of moral distress on men
and women but acknowledged that, given the low participation rate of men in their study, more research will
be needed to examine gender differences in moral distress with samples in which more male nurses are
represented.27 There is a scarcity of research on how gender inﬂuences the experience of moral distress for
which this relationship can be evaluated and compared. Furthermore, gender bias within nursing research has
been well-documented.37

Nurses working in acute mental health settings experience levels of moral distress that are impacted by
aggression, limited resources, and legal and professional obligations.38 Mental health nurses are the largest
group of clinicians within mental health settings, yet many new mental health nurses are more likely to leave
their jobs within the initial two years within mental health to pursue other opportunities to develop their
clinical abilities and skills.39 The combination of increasing patient acuity38 with an expected shortage of

mental health nurses in many countries including Australia by 203012 highlights the necessity to engage in
moral distress research and related interventions for mental health nurses who may experience moral distress.
