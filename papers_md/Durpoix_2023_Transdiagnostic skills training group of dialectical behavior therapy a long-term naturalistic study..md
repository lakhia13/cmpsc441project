Abstract
Introduction  Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has assembled a large body of evidence for the treatment of 
emotional dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), but also in other disorders characterized by 
emotional dysregulation (e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and ADHD). Standalone skills learning groups address the problem 
of limited resources in several clinical settings. Furthermore, transdiagnostic skills groups facilitate the recruitment and 
decrease the scattering of resources in psychiatric settings. However, few studies have focused on the pertinence of 
transdiagnostic standalone skills groups in naturalistic settings as well as their long-term outcomes. The goal of this 
study is to assess the impact of participation in a transdiagnostic DBT skills group one year after its completion.

Method  Transdiagnostic DBT skills training groups were provided for BPD, BD and ADHD patients in a University 
Psychiatric Department (Strasbourg, France), between 2019 and 2020. They consisted of 16 group sessions of 2.5 h 
and 3 individual sessions. At 1-year follow-up, ad-hoc questionnaires were proposed to all participants to assess the 
perceived impacts, the changes in symptomatology, and the maintenance of skills learned.

Result  22 of the 31 participants were interviewed at the one-year post-group session (64% BPD, 41% ADHD and 
27% BD). 73% participants estimated that group impact was important or very important, 64% stated using the skills 
learned often or very often, mainly emotion regulation skills. An improvement in emotional instability, substance use, 
impulsivity and suicidal thoughts was reported by respectively 100%, 91%, 86% and 85% of participants. Quality of life 
improved according to 90% participants. All patients reported an improvement in suicidality during the post-group 
year, especially in suicide attempts. Psychotropic medication decreased in 59% of participants.

Discussion  Our one-year naturalistic study suggests that transdiagnostic DBT skills training groups are promising for 
the treatment of emotional dysregulation in people with BPD, BD and/or ADHD. The observational design and the 
lack of control group are the main limitations. Randomized controlled studies are required to confirm the long-term 
efficacy of transdiagnostic skills learning groups in naturalistic settings.

Introduction
Emotion  dysregulation  (ED)  is  defined  as  an  inability  to 
use effective strategies to reduce intense emotional oscil-
lations.  ED  is  a  core  processus  of  borderline  personality 
disorder (BPD) but it is also observed in other disorders 
such  as  bipolar  disorder  (BD)  [1],  ADHD  [2],  or  autism 
[3]. Importantly, ED is associated with suicidal behaviors, 
poorer social and interpersonal functioning, and psycho-
logical distress [4, 5].

Amongst  psychosocial  interventions  for  BPD,  Dialec-
tical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT)  has  the  highest  evidence 
level  of  efficacy  [6].  DBT  targets  ED  [7,  8],  notably  by 
teaching  emotion  regulation  skills.  Linehan’s  biosocial 
theory, the theory underlying DBT, posits ED as the core 
mechanism  of  BPD  symptoms.  According  to  Linehan’s 
theory,  ED  arises  from  interactions  between  emotional 
vulnerability and an invalidating developmental environ-
ment [9]. Mechanisms that explain emotional dysregula-
tion  may  differ  to  some  extent  across  disorders  and  ED 
has been reported to be heightened in BPD compared to 
BD  [1]  and  ADHD  [2].  However,  several  recent  findings 
suggest  that  ED  is  a  transdiagnostic  mechanism  of  psy-
chopathology [10–12] and, beyond its clinical relevance, 
Linehan’s  biosocial  model  has  gathered  empirical  evi-
dence supporting its pertinence in BPD and in other psy-
chiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders [3, 13].

Importantly,  several  studies  have  shown  that  DBT  is 
also  effective  in  targeting  ED  found  in  disorders  other 
than BPD [14–16], such as BD [17–19], and ADHD [20]. 
No other psychotherapy has demonstrated similar levels 
of  evidence  for  treating  ED.  Furthermore,  even  though 
pharmacological  treatments  are  recommended  as  first-
line approaches in BD and ADHD, their effectiveness for 
ED is small to moderate [11].

Comprehensive  DBT  is  an  intensive  therapy  that 
includes  four  components  (skills  training  group,  indi-
vidual  therapy,  phone  coaching  and  team  consultation), 
needing  sufficient  staff  and  patient  availability,  which 
limits  its  implementation  [21,  22].  On  average,  45.3% 
of  teams  that  have  implemented  DBT  fail  to  pursue  the 
delivery  of  the  therapy,  usually  after  2  to  5  years  [22]. 
These  interruptions  are  dramatic  given  that  the  number 
of  DBT  therapists  is  low  compared  to  patients’  needs 
[23].  For  this  reason,  less  resource-intensive  and  more 
easily implementable models have been evaluated, in par-
ticular  those  focusing  on  standalone  DBT  skills  training 
groups [24]. DBT skills training groups is the most inves-
tigated  standalone  component  of  adapted  DBT  models. 
Recent  meta-analyses  found  4  randomized  controlled 
studies  for  BPD  with  standardized  mean  difference  of 
-1,05 on affective instability [25] and 12 for other disor-
ders with large overall effect size [26].

only one group for different diagnoses instead of several 
groups  for  each  diagnosis.  To  our  knowledge,  4  studies 
exist on transdiagnostic DBT groups. The only random-
ized  controlled  study  [27]  found  that  after  a  4-month 
DBT  group,  patients  with  depression  and/or  anxiety 
disorder experienced a decrease in ED and anxiety  with 
an important effect size compared to the control group. 
A  clinical  improvement  was  also  found  by  other  stud-
ies in depression and anxiety after a 5-week DBT group 
with  daily  sessions  [28].  Improvements  have  also  been 
reported  in  deliberate  self-harm  after  a  6-week  DBT 
group with daily sessions [29], and in emotion regulation 
after  a  6-month  DBT  group  with  weekly  sessions  [30]. 
However, these studies focused mainly on depression and 
anxiety  disorder.  Transdiagnostic  groups  have  been  less 
studied in BD, BPD and ADHD. Yet, the latter are often 
comorbid and characterized by high levels of impulsivity 
and ED, which are linked to suicidal behaviors [1, 15, 31]. 
Moreover,  studies  on  transdiagnostic  DBT  groups  did 
not  analyze  outcome  follow-up  data  beyond  a  3-month 
period.

In this study, we were interested in the long-term sus-
tainability  of  treatment  benefits  of  skills  learning  DBT 
transdiagnostic  groups  targeting  ED.  While  there  is  no 
consensus on the definition of a long-term effect in psy-
chotherapeutic  treatment,  we  considered  assessing  the 
benefits  one  year  after  treatment  completion  as  an  ade-
quate  reflection  of  the  maintenance  of  effects.  Indeed, 
given  that  BPD,  BD  and  ADHD  are  characterized  by 
their  lifelong  course,  the  sustainability  of  the  effect  is 
crucial  when  recommending  relatively  brief  treatments. 
Furthermore,  for  it  to  be  clinically  relevant,  this  benefit 
must  impact  both  the  consequences  of  ED,  such  as  sui-
cidal  ideation,  and  quality  of  life.  We  also  explored  the 
maintenance of skills use, which could indicate that clini-
cal improvements are related to this assumed active prin-
ciple of DBT.

Given  the  methodological  challenges  of  conduct-
ing  a  controlled  trial  in  a  naturalistic  setting,  our  study 
employed  a  retrospective  method,  and  we  queried 
patients  about  their  perceived  improvement.  Our  pri-
mary  hypothesis  was  that  one  year  after  treatment, 
patients  would  report  improvements  in  symptoms  asso-
ciated  with  ED  and  in  their  quality  of  life,  on  the  one 
hand, and that they would also report a continued use of 
the  DBT  skills  learned  during  the  groups,  on  the  other. 
We hypothesized that the observed improvement would 
be associated with the generalization and continued use 
of skills.

they  could  decline  to  participate  without  incurring  any 
negative  consequences.  This  research  received  approval 
by the Ethics Committee of the Strasbourg Medicine Fac-
ulty (CE-2021-108).

Characteristics of participants & setting

Transdiagnostic  DBT  skills  training  groups  were  pro-
vided  to  patients  with  BPD,  BD  or  ADHD  in  the  Psy-
chiatry  Department  of  Strasbourg  University  Hospital. 
Patients were referred by psychiatrists, the referral crite-
ria being a diagnosis of  BPD, BD and  ADHD  associated 
with  ED.  Diagnosis  was  done  according  to  the  DSM-5 
criteria for each disorder.

One year after the last session of transdiagnostic DBT 
groups, a follow-up individual session was systematically 
proposed  to  patients,  during  which  a  semi  structured 
interview  was  administered,  described  in  the  “outcome 
measures”  section  (questionnaire  available  as  Supple-
mentary material).

Between  March  2018  and  December  2019,  4  transdi-
agnostic  DBT  groups  were  conducted  with  31  different

patients, including 3 who prematurely dropped out. Out 
of  the  remaining  28  participants,  6  did  not  attend  the 
1-year  follow-up  debriefing  session  between  2019  and 
2020 (4 renewed their participation in DBT group before 
this debriefing and were therefore not included, and 2 did 
not reply). Therefore, 22 patients responded to the 1-year 
questionnaire.  In  the  referral  letters,  the  main  diagnosis 
was  BPD  (64%),  ADHD  (41%)  and  BD  (27%).  At  least  2 
diagnoses were mentioned for 5 patients (23%) (Table 1).

Intervention: transdiagnostic DBT groups of 16 weeks

Based on Neasciu & al [27, 32], the transdiagnostic DBT 
skills  training  groups  consisted  of  16  weekly  sessions  of 
2.5 h. Divided in 2 cycles with a fixed skills learning pro-
gram (Table 2), it covered the four DBT modules devel-
oped  by  Linehan  [8]  :  mindfulness,  emotion  regulation, 
distress  tolerance  and  interpersonal  effectiveness.  Each 
cycle  began  with  mindfulness  teaching  sessions,  partici-
pants could enter the program during these sessions, i.e. 
sessions  1,  2  and  10.  Two  debriefing  sessions  were  held 
at the end of each cycle and another one, one year after 
treatment  completion.  These  debriefing  sessions  pro-
vided  an  opportunity  to  review  the  skills  learned  in  the 
previous sessions, engage in role-play or skills modelling, 
address  questions,  assist  participants  in  noticing  their 
progress,  and  gather  feedback  from  participants  regard-
ing their experiences in the group sessions. This program 
was named GREMO – in French : Groupe de Régulation 
Emotionnelle [33, 34]. In addition to DBT skills training 

Durpoix et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2023) 10:37 groups, a consultation team was held weekly and patients 
had treatment as usual (psychiatric consultation, medica-
tion,  individual  psychotherapy…).  Therapists  were  psy-
chiatrists  or  clinical  psychologists  trained  in  DBT  (i.e., 
the four authors).

Outcome measures, design & aim

An  individual  debriefing  session  at  1-year  post-group 
was done through semi-structured interview guided with 
an  ad  hoc  questionnaire.  The  semi-structured  interview 
aided the recall of the post-treatment year to improve the 
reliability  of  responses.  The  questionnaire  (see  supple-
mentary  materials)  was  divided  in  three  parts.  The  first 
one concerned DBT skills: impact of skills training group, 
frequency of skills use, the most used skills (mindfulness, 
emotional regulation, distress tolerance or interpersonal 
effectiveness). The second focused on perceived changes 
for specific symptoms (emotional instability, depression, 
sleeping,  suicidal  thoughts,  impulsivity,  substances  use, 
eating  behavior,  emptiness  feeling,  loneliness  feeling), 
overall  quality  of  life  and  in  specific  domains  (couple 
life,  friendship  life,  spiritual  life,  professional  life,  stud-
ies/training,  leisure,  health,  hope,  meaning  of  life,  self-
esteem).  Responses  were  rated  according  to  a  7-point 
Likert  scale  (very  highly  improved,  highly  improved, 
slightly improved, stable, slightly worsened, highly wors-
ened,  very  highly  worsened)  or  “non-applicable”.  The 
third part focused on suicidality and use of services (psy-
chiatric  hospitalization,  suicide  attempt,  self-harming

ing at 1 year (N = 22)

behavior, consultations with clinicians, and psychotropic 
medication take).

Following  the  debriefing  sessions  held  between  2019 
and 2020, we analyzed retrospectively this questionnaire 
as  part  of  this  naturalistic  study.  The  aim  was  to  assess 
the  one-year  impact  of  a  transdiagnostic  4-month  DBT 
skills training group for BPD, BD and/or ADHD.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analyses were performed on the responses to 
the  questionnaire,  mostly  expressed  in  proportions.  To 
explore the relationship between emotion instability and 
suicidal ideation on the one hand, as well as the relation-
ship of these symptoms with socio-demographic charac-
teristics,  skills  use,  and  psychotherapeutic  follow-up  the 
year after the group on the other hand, Fisher exact tests 
were  performed  as  the  variables  were  categorical.  Since 
these  were  exploratory  analyses  conducted  on  a  clinical 
sample without prior power estimation, no correction for 
multiple  testing  was  applied,  and  the  results  should  be 
interpreted  accordingly.  These  statistical  analyses  were 
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 software.

Results
Perception of change at the one-year debriefing session
Perception of DBT skills training impact at 1 year

DBT  skills  training  impact  was  estimated  as  important 
or  very  important  by  73%  of  participants  (Fig.  1).  One 
year following the last session, 64% stated using the skills 
learned  often  or  very  often,  emotional  regulation  skills 
being the most used according to the participants (Fig. 2).

Clinical change at 1 year

At  1-year  post-intervention,  100%  of  participants 
reported  experiencing  an  improvement  of  emotional 
instability,  91%  of  substance  use  (for  the  11  concerned 
participants),  86%  of  impulsivity  and  85%  of  suicidal 
thoughts  (for  the  20  concerned  participants).  Improve-
ments in feelings of emptiness, depression, eating behav-
ior and feeling of loneliness were less frequently noticed 
(Fig. 3).

According to our survey, 90% of participants reported 
an  increase  in  their  overall  quality  of  life.  More  specifi-
cally, 85% experienced improvements in self-esteem, 82% 
in the meaning given to their life, 81% in work/study and 
hope, 68% in leisure, 64% in friendly relationship, 60% in 
romantic  relationship,  50%  in  health  issues,  and  38%  in 
sleeping difficulties (Fig. 4).

Perceived change of suicidality and use of services at one-
year post-DBT

All  patients  reported  an  improvement  in  suicidality 
if  they  were  concerned,  especially  in  suicide  attempts 
(Fig. 5). None reported stabilization or worsening.

Regarding their medication, 13 patients said that it was 
decreased  (59%),  3  patients  that  it  was  increased  (14%) 
and 6 that it was stable (27%). Five patients were not tak-
ing any medications (23%).

Regarding  the  consultations  with  psychotherapist,  the 
frequency  decreased  according  to  50%  of  patients  and 
remained stable according to others. This frequency was

order),  nor  with  the  type  of  individual  therapy  and  its 
intensity  during  this  post-group  year.  By  contrast,  the 
frequency  of  skills  use  was  associated  with  improve-
ment  in  emotional  instability  (p = 0.014).  Furthermore, 
improvement  in  emotional  instability  and  improvement 
in suicidal ideation were correlated (p = 0.010). Neverthe-
less,  the  frequency  of  skills  use  was  not  associated  with 
improvement in suicidal ideation.

tional  instability  or  suicidal  ideation  was  not  associated

Discussion
This  naturalistic  study  aimed  to  explore  the  one-year 
impact of a transdiagnostic 4-month DBT skills training 
group for BPD, BD and/or ADHD. To our knowledge, our 
study is the first to investigate the long-term impact of a 
transdiagnostic DBT group. One-year post-treatment, all 
participants  deemed  that  the  DBT  skills  training  group 
had  had  a  positive  impact,  which  was  rated  as  impor-
tant  or  very  important  by  three  quarters  of  them.  All 
participants  reported  improvements  in  emotional  insta-
bility,  and  over  85%  in  substance  use,  impulsivity,  and 
suicidal thoughts. Although other symptoms showed less 
improvements,  more  than  half  of  participants  noticed 
improvements  in  eating  behavior,  depression,  feelings 
of  emptiness  and  over  a  third  in  feelings  of  loneliness. 
For  each  assessed  symptom,  participants  reported  more 
improvements  than  stability  or  worsening.  Improve-
ments were also reported by most patients for quality of 
life, suicidal behaviors, and use of services.

Consistent with other studies [35, 36], the use of DBT 
skills  was  associated  with  improvement  in  emotional 
instability.  Moreover,  this  improvement  was  correlated 

with  suicidal  thoughts  improvement.  In  contrast,  none 
of  these  symptoms  were  correlated  with  patients’  socio-
demographics characteristics nor with individual therapy 
attended during the post-group year. Half of participants 
reported  a  decrease  in  the  frequency  of  sessions  with 
psychotherapists and the other half remained stable. Par-
ticipants reported using mainly emotion regulation skills. 
This  is  in  contrast  with  findings  suggesting  that  during 
the course of the group, the most used skills are usually 
distress  tolerance  ones  [37].  The  absence  of  correlation 
between  socio-demographics  characteristics  and  emo-
tional instability improvement suggests that regardless of 
age,  sex  or  diagnosis,  emotional  stability  improves  after 
the transdiagnostic DBT group.

The  literature  on  DBT  stand-alone  transdiagnostic 
groups is recent and scarcely developed. The Neasciu et 
al. study [27], which inspired our DBT program, included 
anxious  or  depressed  patients  and  excluded  those  with 
high  suicidality.  Like  Neasciu  et  al.,  we  observed  an 
improvement in ED associated with the use of DBT skills. 
However, the authors found it at post-therapy and at two 
months follow-up. Like Gibson et al. [29], who evaluated 

Durpoix et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2023) 10:37  
Page 7 of 9

Fig. 5  Participants’ assessment of the change of suicidality at 1-year follow-up

a 6-week daily group program in a sample with 18,6% BD 
and  74,3%  BPD  individuals,  we  found  an  improvement 
in self-harming behaviors, although their post-group fol-
low-up was held at three months only. Other short trans-
diagnostic  DBT  groups  found  clinical  improvements  in 
emotion  regulation,  depression  and  hope,  but  a  follow-
up  was  not  provided  [28,  30]. Therefore,  our  study  adds 
to  this  literature  by  providing  evidence  for  longer-term 
effects (up to a year) of a short DBT skills training group 
in people with BD, BPD and or/ADHD.

The  acquisition  of  DBT  skills  is  readily  adaptable  to 
various diagnostic contexts, particularly considering that 
Linehan’s  biosocial  model  can  account  for  the  develop-
ment of ED in the case of developmental peculiarities [3]. 
Furthermore,  DBT  skills  are  now  widely  disseminated 
and have become a dominant model. However, our data 
do not allow us to determine whether DBT skills in par-
ticular are effective or if considering ED in various disor-
ders  and  assisting  patients  in  regulating  their  emotions, 
regardless  of  the  therapeutic  model,  could  yield  similar 
results.  Taking  these  factors  into  account,  it  is  certainly 
valuable to use the DBT model in standalone group for-
mats, although other modalities deserve to be tested and 
compared.

Our  results  suggest  that  it  is  likely  beneficial  to  offer 
DBT  skills-training  groups  to  patients  with  various  psy-
chiatric  disorders,  and  this  treatment  modality  can  be 
provided using a transdiagnostic approach. Based on our 
clinical experience, the presence of patients with different 

diagnoses has not been a hindrance for the participants, 
but  rather  an  opportunity  for  interaction  and  learning. 
This  observation  seems  corroborate  by  the  results  of 
the  study,  notably  few  dropped-out.  Qualitative  studies 
would  provide  a  deeper  exploration  of  this  aspect  and 
the overall experiences of the participants. In addition to 
being  consistent  with  Linehan’s  [7]  behavioral  approach 
of  ED,  transdiagnostic  formats  make  it  easier  to  recruit 
an adequate number of patients without focusing on the 
primary  diagnosis,  particularly  for  non-specialized  psy-
chiatric setting. Furthermore, the cost of such programs 
is relatively modest, within the scope of traditional outpa-
tient psychiatric care services, as it can be implemented 
without  significant  organizational  modifications.  Stud-
ies evaluating the cost-benefit ratio should be conducted 
with larger samples.

Several  significant  limitations  of  our  study  should  be 
noted.  First,  the  absence  of  a  control  group  does  not 
allow  us  to  conclude  that  the  DBT  skills  training  group 
is  the  active  ingredient  of  clinical  improvement.  While 
emotional dysregulation in ADHD and BD is usually con-
sidered  stable  over  1–2  years  without  therapeutic  inter-
vention, this is less consensual in BPD because remission 
in BPD symptoms reaches 39% at 2 years [38–40]. How-
ever, this did not mean complete regression of all symp-
toms  or  absence  of  relapse  risk  [41].  At  one-year,  the 
control  groups  referenced  in  Finch’s  meta-analysis  [42] 
had low effect size on BPD symptoms and nearly zero on 
suicidality.  Second,  the  retrospective  self-reported  data 

Durpoix et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2023) 10:37  
may  have  been  influenced  by  a  social  desirability  bias 
and a memory bias. These biases may have overestimated 
the  results.  However,  the  evolution  is  not  the  same  for 
all  symptoms,  which  suggests  that  these  biases  did  not 
explain all the improvements found here. Third, the small 
sample limits the reliability of Fisher exact test to deter-
mine  if  some  characteristics  of  the  participants  could 
have  moderated  the  response  of  the  intervention  (age, 
initial  severity  of  ED,  diagnosis).  The  sample  consists  of 
86%  women,  and  we  were  unable  to  draw  conclusions 
about  a  gender-related  treatment  effect.  Fourth,  indi-
vidual DBT sessions was offered to some of the patients 
presenting with severe BPD symptoms. Thus, we cannot 
affirm that the skills group stand-alone is sufficient for all 
patients presenting with severe ED. To avoid these limi-
tations, further studies are necessary with larger samples 
and/or with randomized controlled methodology.

Conclusion
Transdiagnostic  DBT  skills  training  groups  seem  to 
have  positive  outcomes  at  one  year  for  individuals  with 
BPD,  BD  and/or  ADHD  presenting  with  emotional  dys-
regulation.  These  results  are  relevant  in  terms  of  DBT 
implementation,  notably  when  evidence-based  psycho-
therapies are difficult to implement due to access to ser-
vices limitation. The transdiagnostic format can be more 
easily  implemented  outside  of  specialized  settings  for  a 
specific  disorder.  Randomized  controlled  trials,  obser-
vational studies on larger samples and cost-effectiveness 
studies are still needed.
