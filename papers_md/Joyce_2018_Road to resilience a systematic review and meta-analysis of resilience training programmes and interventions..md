AbstrACt
Objectives  To synthesise the available evidence on 
interventions designed to improve individual resilience.
Design  A systematic review and meta-analysis
Methods  The following electronic databases were 
searched: Ovid Medline, Ovid EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid 
Cochrane and WHO Clinical Trials Registry in order to 
identify any controlled trials or randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) examining the efficacy of interventions aimed at 
improving psychological resilience. Pooled effects sizes 
were calculated using the random-effects model of meta-
analysis.
Outcome measures  Valid and reliable measures of 
psychological resilience.
results  Overall, 437 citations were retrieved and 111 
peer-reviewed articles were examined in full. Seventeen 
studies met the inclusion criteria and were subject to 
a quality assessment, with 11 RCTs being included in 
the final meta-analysis. Programmes were stratified 
into one of three categories (1) cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT)-based interventions, (2) mindfulness-based 
interventions or (3) mixed Interventions, those combining 
CBT and Mindfulness training. A meta-analysis found a 
moderate positive effect of resilience interventions (0.44 
(95% CI 0.23 to 0.64) with subgroup analysis suggesting 
CBT-based, mindfulness and mixed interventions were 
effective.
Conclusions  Resilience interventions based on a 
combination of CBT and mindfulness techniques appear to 
have a positive impact on individual resilience.

IntrODuCtIOn 
Managing  the  ups  and  downs  of  daily  life 
requires  resilience.  Given  the  impact  of 
stress-related  illness  on  global  economies, 
resilience  is  not  only  a  topic  of  immense 
personal and familial importance but also has 
major social and financial significance.1–3 To 
meet  this  challenge,  research  is  increasingly 
focusing  on  what  constitutes  resilience  and 
how it can be developed or enhanced. Resil-
ience  is  a  multifaceted  phenomenon,  which 
is  influenced  by  the  presence  or  absence 
of  various  resilience-promoting  resources.4 
When  such  resources  are  cultivated,  they 
enhance a person’s overall ability to effectively 

strengths and limitations of this study

 ► We employed a systematic strategy to search for the 
best  quality  evidence  of  effectiveness  in  resilience 
interventions  and  assessed  the  methodological 
rigour of each included study.

 ► We completed a priori planned subanalyses to pro-
vide  further  insight  regarding  the  effectiveness  of 
different types of resilience training.

 ► There  were  relatively  small  sample  sizes  across 
many  of  the  randomised  controlled  trials  and  over 
a third of the included studies did not provide ade-
quate data for inclusion in the main meta-analysis.
 ► None of the included studies investigated the impact 
of adverse situations following intervention meaning 
improvement in resilience was detected solely by a 
change in scores on self-report resilience scales.
 ► There was not a prospectively published protocol for 
the systematic search and non-English articles were 
excluded.

cope with heightened stress and adverse life 
circumstances.4–9 

Definitions  of  resilience  are  diverse  and 
plentiful.  Some  researchers  have  described 
it as the ability to adapt positively to stressful 
circumstances,10  while  others  have  defined 
resilience  as  being  able  to  remain  function-
ally  stable  and  well  despite  ongoing  stress.11 
The  American  Psychological  Society  defines 
resilience  as  a  process  of  ‘bouncing  back’ 
from  difficult  experiences  and  ‘adapting 
well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, 
threats or significant sources of stress’.12 This 
definition captures the ‘bounce-back’ charac-
teristic, which a number of researchers have 
proposed  as  being  one  of  the  central  quali-
ties of resilience.4 13 In this way, resilience can 
be viewed as being on a continuum ranging 
from low (poor bounce-back ability) to high 
(strong  capacity  to  recover)  and  extremely 
high, which in the literature has been termed 
‘thriving’  and  reflects  a  person’s  ability  to 
reach a superior level of functioning following 
an adverse or stressful event.13 14

Higher self-reported resilience has been associated with 
lower levels of anxiety, psychological distress and mixed 
anxiety/depression.5  15–17  Researchers  have  also  found 
that  resilience,  as  measured  by  various  self-report  tools, 
has  a  mitigating  effect  on  depression  symptoms  among 
individuals who have experienced trauma in both child-
hood and later life,18–21 as well as among patients experi-
encing severe health conditions.22 Together, these studies 
suggest  that  the  measurable  components  of  individual 
resilience may play an important protective role in easing 
the negative effects of stress, trauma and adversity.

Several  studies  have  examined  the  benefits  of  resil-
ience  training  among  various  specific  groups,  including 
intensive care nurses, college students, cancer survivors, 
youth workers, radiologists, immigrants, physicians, mili-
tary  officers  and  general  office  workers.4–9  While  the 
training programmes typically share the common aim of 
enhancing resilience or resilience resources, they tend to 
differ greatly in terms of content, delivery and length. An 
important  limitation  in  the  resilience  literature  is  aptly 
noted  by  Leppin  and  colleagues23  who  observe  that  ‘no 
single accepted theoretical framework or consensus state-
ment  exists  to  guide  the  development  or  application  of 
these programmes’.23 In spite of these concerns, a number 
of  recent  reviews  have  highlighted  the  growing  body  of 
research supporting the benefits of resilience training for 
mental  health  and  well-being.23–25  While  research  high-
lighting the relationship between resilience and psycho-
logical  well-being  is  vital,  it  is  important  to  note  that 
resilience  cannot  simply  be  measured  via  psychometric 
tools examining well-being and mental health symptom-
ology. A training programme may enhance and improve 
mental  health  symptoms,  yet  not  improve  a  person’s 
overall  psychological  resilience  or  vice  versa.26  27  More-
over, in groups where people are ‘mentally healthy’, other 
measures are needed to examine the efficacy of resilience 
programmes beyond simple well-being outcomes. Given 
these  concerns,  when  appraising  the  evidence  for  resil-
ience training, it is crucial to consider how resilience as 
an  outcome  is  measured.  A  recent  review  analysed  the 
validity  and  reliability  of  various  resilience  measures 
currently  in  use,  and  concluded  that  while  there  are  a 
number  of  valid  and  reliable  measures  of  resilience,  at 
present, there was no gold standard measure.28

The  main  aim  of  the  present  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis  is  to  synthesise  the  available  research 
evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  interventions  designed 
to promote or enhance individual resilience.

search strategy
A  systematic  search  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses  guidelines.29  In  June  2016,  the  following 
electronic  databases  were  searched:  Ovid  Medline,  Ovid 
EMBASE,  PsycINFO  and  Ovid  Cochrane  Library.  Search 
items,  summarised  in  table  1,  included:  ‘resilience’,

example  of  the  full  search  strategy  for  one  database  is 
provided  in  online  supplementary  file  1.  No  time  restric-
tions were placed on the search strategy, with all published 
articles up to June 2016 considered. The references of each 
included  paper  were  also  searched  for  relevant  resilience 
intervention  studies.  Additionally,  in  order  to  reduce  the 
risk of publication bias, in July 2016, we searched the WHO 
Clinical Trials Registry using the term ‘resilience’ to identify 
any trials that had not published their findings.

eligibility criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
or controlled trials assessing the efficacy of any programme 
designed  to  develop,  enhance  or  improve  resilience  in 
adults. Studies had to describe a specific aim to improve 
resilience  and  employ  an  acceptable  measure  of  resil-
ience  as  one  of  the  outcome  measures.  It  was  decided 
a  priori  that  in  order  to  be  an  acceptable  measure  of 
resilience,  the  outcome  measure  used  had  to  meet  two 
criteria.  First,  the  measure  had  to  assess  an  individual’s 
ability to adapt to change and cope effectively with signif-
icant  life  adversity.  Second,  the  measure  had  to  have 
undergone  some  type  of  validity  assessment.  A  recent 
review  has  systematically  reviewed  the  psychometric 
rigour  of  resilience  measurement  scales  developed  for 
use in general and clinical populations.28 This concluded 
that there is currently no gold standard measure of resil-
ience,28 which makes assessing criterion validity of various 
measures difficult. In keeping with the conclusions of this 
review,28 the following three measures of resilience were 
agreed a priori to have met both of our defined criteria: 
The  Connors  and  Davidson  Resilience  Scale,  The  Brief 
Resilience  Scale  and  The  14-item  Resilience  Scale.  If 
studies were identified that employed other measures of 
resilience,  these  were  closely  examined  in  terms  of  the 
construct that was measured and the degree to which it 
had  been  validated  against  other  recognised  outcomes. 
No restrictions were made based on the type of compar-
ator used and length of follow-up. Studies that only eval-
uated  the  implementation  or  receptivity  of  a  resilience 
programme  were  excluded.  Non-English  publications 
and  studies  that  exclusively  used  well-being  or  mental 
health outcomes as the main measure of resilience were 
also excluded.

Joyce S, et al. BMJ Open 2018;8:e017858. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017858study selection
Two  researchers  (SJ  and  JT)  worked  independently  to 
initially  screen  the  titles  and  abstracts  retrieved  by  the 
literature. Following the initial screening, relevant papers 
were retrieved in full text and specific inclusion criteria 
were  used  to  identify  eligible  studies.  Discrepancies 
between  the  researchers’  selection  results,  which  were 
infrequent, were discussed with a third researcher (SBH) 
until consensus on inclusion or exclusion was reached.

Quality assessment
Methodological  quality  of  each  included  study  was 
assessed  using  the  Downs  and  Black  Checklist.30  Minor 
modifications were made to the tool for use in this review. 
In line with previous studies,31–33 the scoring for question 
27  on  statistical  power  was  simplified  to  either  zero  or 
one, based on whether or not there was sufficient power 
in  the  study  to  detect  a  clinically  significant  effect  (ie, 
studies  reporting  power  of  less  than  0.80  with  alpha  at 
0.05 obtained a zero score). The maximum score for the 
modified checklist was 28 with all individual items rated as 
either yes (=1) or no/unable to determine (=0), with the 
exception  of  item  5,  ‘Are  the  distributions  of  principals 
confounders  in  each  group  of  subjects  to  be  compared 
clearly  described?’  in  which  responses  were  rated  as  yes 
(=2),  partially  (=1)  and  no  (=0).  Scores  were  grouped 
into four categories based on ranges: excellent (26 to 28), 
good (20 to 25), fair (15 to 19) and poor (14 and less). 
Studies  with  an  overall  ‘poor’  quality  assessment  were 
excluded from the final review.

Data extraction and contact with researchers
Data from each study were extracted by the lead author 
(SJ).  Where  additional  information  was  required  for 
effect size calculations, the study’s lead researchers were 
contacted.  Contact  details  were  obtained  through  the 
correspondence addresses provided on the study’s publi-
cation.  At  times,  website  searches  were  also  performed 
to ensure that contact details were still valid and in use. 
Researchers were contacted by email and non-responders 
were sent two follow-up emails at fortnightly intervals.

Two authors (SJ and SJL), both practicing psychologists, 
reviewed the available information to determine whether 
the intervention being tested in each study was primarily 
based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mind-
fulness principles, or a combination of both. Most studies 
provided a detailed description of the theoretical basis of 
their  interventions  and  examples  of  the  content,  which 
made  this  classification  possible.  If  required,  additional 
clarification was sought from the corresponding author.

Data synthesis/statistical analysis
The  meta-analyses  were  performed  using  the  statistical 
software package STATA, V.12.1. The main outcomes of 
interest  in  each  study  was  the  measure  of  psychological 
resilience. As studies used various measures of resilience, 
the effect size was represented by the standardised mean 
difference (SMD), which was computed by subtracting the 

Open access

average score of the control group from that of the inter-
vention group, and dividing the result by the pooled SD. 
The pooled mean effect sizes were expressed as SMD with 
95% CI.  Some  heterogeneity  was  anticipated  given  the 
varying  populations  and  interventions  employed  across 
included studies. Therefore, pooled effect size estimates 
were calculated using the random-effects model (REM) of 
analysis  using  the  method  of  DerSimonian  and  Laird.34 
In addition, the I2 statistic was reported to determine the 
level and impact of heterogeneity and the percentage of 
outcome variability, which may result from heterogeneity 
present across studies. Two subgroup meta-analyses were 
planned a priori. First, in order to examine the evidence 
base  for  different  types  of  resilience  training,  subgroup 
analyses  were  planned  for  training  based  on  CBT  skills, 
mindfulness training and a combination of both. Second, 
a  planned  subanalysis  examined  studies  that  provided 
6-month  follow-up  data  to  determine  the  longer-term 
effects  of  different  types  of  resilience  training.  Publica-
tion biases were examined through visual inspection of a 
funnel plot with the SMD plotted against the SMD SE and 
quantitatively through Egger’s test for small study effects.

Patient and public involvement
The research question being addressed by this study was 
informed by consultations with a range of policy markers 
and  industry  groups,  who  expressed  a  keen  interest  in 
understanding  if  resilience  training  can  work.  Patients 
were not directly involved in the conduct of the analysis.

results
Overview of search results and included studies
The search of the databases of published papers retrieved 
437  citations.  Following  the  screening  of  title  and 
abstract,  a  total  of  111  papers  were  examined  in  full. 
Ninety-six  papers  were  excluded  as  they  did  not  meet 
the  inclusion  criteria.  Thus,  15  studies  were  considered 
eligible  for  inclusion  and  were  subject  to  quality  assess-
ment (figure 1).

A search of the WHO Clinical Trial Registry produced 
174  citations,  with  five  studies  meeting  the  inclusion 
criteria.  The  lead  researchers  of  each  of  these  studies 
were  contacted,  with  two  providing  the  requested  data. 
These two papers were combined with the 15 published 
studies obtained to result in a total of 17 included studies 
for the present review. Six studies were deemed to be of 
‘good’ quality, 10 were ‘fair’ and one was deemed ‘poor’ 
quality. The quality rating for each study and a detailed 
summary  of  each  study’s  characteristics  including  the 
control condition are outlined in online supplementary 
table  1.  Fifteen  studies  were  RCTs  with  pre/postevalua-
tion.  Two  papers  described  controlled  studies  that  were 
not  randomised.  Eleven  of  these  studies  (all  of  which 
were RCTs) provided adequate postintervention data for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis. Of these, all but two used 
a wait list as the control condition. Five RCTs included a 
6-month follow-up and appropriate data for analysis. The

There  was  considerable  variation  in  the  type  of  resil-
ience training provided, although most involved a combi-
nation of psychoeducation, mindfulness, cognitive skills, 
self-compassion skills, gratitude practise, emotional regu-
lation training, relaxation and goal setting. As outlined in

Figure 2  Meta-analysis examining the effect of resilience training on self-reported measures of resilience.

table 2, six of the studies described mixed interventions 
that  combined  mindfulness  and  CBT  while  four  studies 
used  only  CBT-based  interventions  and  two  focused  on 
mindfulness-based  techniques.  Training  hours  for  inter-
ventions  varied  considerably  and  ranged  from  a  2-hour 
single  session  to  28 hours  of  training  over  multiple 
sessions. Eighty per cent of interventions were delivered 
via face-to-face training over multiple sessions.

Meta-analysis
Effects of resilience intervention programmes compared with 
control conditions
Figure  2  presents  the  SMDs  of  resilience  levels  at  the 
completion  of  training  and  the  pooled  mean  effect  size 
using the REM for the 11 studies included in the meta-anal-
ysis. While only 4 of the 11 studies indicated a statistically 
significant effect of the interventions, the estimated pooled 
SMD between the intervention and control groups was 0.44 
(95% CI 0.23 to 0.64), reflecting a moderate positive effect 
favouring the intervention group. A moderate amount of 
heterogeneity  was  present,  with  an  I2  estimate  of  48%.  A 
sensitivity analysis including only those studies deemed of 
‘good’ quality (n=5) also revealed a similar moderate posi-
tive effect size estimate (0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.79).

Effects of mixed interventions incorporating mindfulness and CBT 
skills
As noted above, six of the included studies tested ‘Mixed’ 
resilience  interventions  incorporating  both  mindfulness 
and CBT skills. Five of these studies provided sufficient data 
to permit a subgroup analysis and the results are presented 
in figure 3A. The SMD between mixed interventions and 

the  control  groups  was  0.51  (95%  CI  0.12  to  0.91),  indi-
cating a moderate effect.

Effects of CBT-based resilience interventions
Four  studies  provided  sufficient  data  to  permit  a 
subgroup  analysis  examining  the  effect  of  CBT-based 
resilience  interventions.  The  results  are  presented 
in  figure  3B.  The  SMD  between  CBT-based  resilience 
interventions and the control groups was 0.27 (95% CI 
0.05 to 0.50), indicating a small positive effect.

Effects of mindfulness-based resilience interventions
Five included studies were mindfulness based; however, 
only  two  of  these  studies  provided  adequate  data  to 
permit a subgroup analysis and the results are presented 
in  figure  3C.  The  SMD  between  mindfulness-based 
interventions and the control groups was 0.46 (95% CI 
0.10 to0.82), indicating a positive moderate effect.

Effect of resilience interventions compared with control conditions 
at 6-month follow-up
Five  studies  reported  a  6-month  follow-up  assessment, 
three  of  which  involved  mindfulness-based  interven-
tions  and  two  CBT-based  interventions.  Two  separate 
subgroup  analyses  were  performed  to  examine  the 
long-term  effects  of  each  intervention  type.  For  mind-
fulness-based interventions, the SMD between the inter-
vention  and  control  groups  was  0.58  (95%  CI  0.27  to 
0.89),  which  is  similar  to  the  effect  size  seen  immedi-
ately after training. With regards to CBT-based interven-
tions,  the  SMD  between  the  intervention  and  control 
groups was 0.76 (95% CI −0.04 to 1.55), although this is

based on only two studies and there was a high level of 
heterogeneity (I2=94%, p=0.01).

Examination for evidence of publication bias
Visual inspection of a funnel plot of the SMD and SE for 
each  study  revealed  no  suggestion  of  asymmetry,  indi-
cating  a  low  likelihood  of  publication  bias  (see  online 
supplementary  figure  1).  Results  of  the  Egger’s  test  for 
funnel plot asymmetry confirmed this (p=0.31).

DIsCussIOn
There has been increasing interest in the concept of resil-
ience  and  whether  training  programmes  can  enhance 
individual  resilience  and  protect  overall  well-being.  To 
the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  systematic 
review and meta-analysis focused on examining the ability 
of  different  interventions  to  successfully  alter  resilience 
as assessed by validated resilience measures. Our results 
highlight that certain types of resilience training appear 

6

Joyce S, et al. BMJ Open 2018;8:e017858. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017858to be beneficial. In particular, interventions using mind-
fulness  or  CBT  techniques  appeared  able  to  enhance 
measures of resilience.

The key strengths of the present review and meta-anal-
ysis  include  the  detailed  systematic  search  strategy,  the 
inclusion  of  unpublished  data  and  the  quality  assess-
ment of each study’s methodological rigour. Despite this, 
a  number  of  important  limitations  both  of  our  review 
process and the studies identified require consideration. 
First, there were relatively small sample sizes across many 
of the RCTs and over a third of the included studies did 
not  provide  adequate  data  for  inclusion  in  the  main 
meta-analysis. Second, none of the included studies inves-
tigated  the  impact  of  adverse  situations  following  inter-
vention meaning improvement in resilience was detected 
solely  by  a  change  in  scores  on  resilience  scales.  Given 
the definition of resilience is usually taken as the ability 
to bounce back from ‘adverse circumstances’,12 it is argu-
able that the most accurate measure of resilience would 
require a significant challenge or threat to the individual 
during  the  study  period.  When  confronted  with  such 
adversity,  the  quality  of  adaptation  and  bounce  back  is 
more accurately assessed. However, this approach would 
only  be  feasible  with  certain  groups  (eg,  army/police/
emergency workers) who regularly encounter challenging 
circumstances given the nature of their daily work. More-
over,  established  resilience  measures  should  be  ideally 
combined with measures of functioning or other indices 
of one’s capacity to manage adverse circumstances. In the 
absence of indices of exposure to adversity and measures 
of functioning, the validated measures of resilience used 
in  this  review  constitute  the  best  available  measures. 
While we limited the present review to include only those 
studies  which  employed  valid  and  reliable  measures  of 
resilience, it remains unclear as to whether each of these 
scales  are  capturing  exactly  the  same  construct  of  resil-
ience. The majority of studies in the present review used 
a single measure of resilience. In future studies, it may be 
advantageous  to  include  several  measures  of  resilience. 
Doing so is likely to provide clarity regarding which facets 
of resilience are related to psychological health and are 
most sensitive to change. This would also further inform 
the  development  of  targeted  interventions  aimed  at 
bolstering successful adaptation to significant adversity.

There  are  a  number  of  additional  limitations  related 
to our review process which also need to be considered. 
First,  while  key  decisions  on  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria were made a priori, we did not publish a protocol 
outlining  our  full  search  and  data  extraction  processes. 
Second,  the  exclusion  of  non-English  articles  may  have 
introduced  additional  bias  to  our  search.  As  with  any 
review, there is a risk of publication biases; however, the 
detailed  search  of  the  WHO  Clinical  Trial  Registry  for 
unpublished  data  should  have  reduced  the  probability 
of  bias  and  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  tests  for 
publication  bias  suggested  significant  bias  was  unlikely. 
Finally,  there  was  a  moderate  amount  of  heterogeneity 
in  our  main  meta-analysis,  with  an  I2  of  48%.  This  level 

Open access

of  heterogeneity  limits  the  interpretation  of  the  pooled 
effect  sizes  as  it  suggests  there  is  a  significant  amount 
of  variation  between  the  individual  studies  included, 
meaning  pooling  all  results  may  not  be  appropriate. 
Possible  explanations  for  the  observed  heterogeneity 
include the different types of training programmes imple-
mented, different lengths of training, different measures 
of resilience and the different control conditions. While 
the  effects  of  different  training  programmes  were  able 
to  be  explored  in  stratified  analyses,  there  were  only 
two studies that used a control condition other than the 
wait list, which made examining the impact of this factor 
impossible. As a result, the cause of much of this hetero-
geneity  and  therefore  the  accuracy  of  the  pooled  effect 
estimate remains uncertain.

There is growing consensus that resilience is a malleable 
characteristic,  wherein  an  individual’s  ability  to  adapt  and 
‘bounce-back’  effectively  from  adversity  can  be  developed 
and enhanced. Our findings suggest that resilience training, 
particularly  those  based  on  mindfulness  and/or  cognitive 
and  behavioural  skills,  may  be  able  to  enhance  resilience. 
The  positive  benefits  of  such  strategies  as  treatment  inter-
ventions for established mental health conditions have been 
examined thoroughly in the past. Several reviews have high-
lighted the value of such skills when treating common mental 
health  conditions  such  as  anxiety  and  depression38–41  and 
have also been associated with improving psychological and 
physical health.40 42 43 In spite of these parallels, considerable 
uncertainty remains regarding what type, if any, of resilience 
training  can  be  recommended.  There  was  considerable 
variation  in  the  type  of  CBT  or  mindfulness  skills  offered 
in  the  intervention  studies  examined,  and  training  times 
varied  considerably  across  studies,  from  2-hour  single-ses-
sion  seminars  to  28 hours  of  multiple  training  sessions. 
The two studies that involved single-session training7 15 had 
conflicting  results,  which  precludes  any  insight  regarding 
the efficacy of brief resilience training. Most interventions 
tended  to  follow  the  traditional  group  therapy  format  of 
multiple  60–90 min  sessions  over  several  weeks.  This  is 
understandable given the fact that time is typically an influ-
ential factor during any new skill acquisition including skills 
acquired through psychological strategies. Eighty per cent 
of  interventions  were  delivered  via  face-to-face  training, 
with  the  remaining  20%  involving  a  mix  of  bibliotherapy, 
online webinars or phone coaching. Despite the increased 
popularity of resilience training in the corporate sector, the 
predominance  of  face-to-face  training  poses  specific  chal-
lenges with regards to accessibility and engagement. These 
limitations  may  result  in  resilience  programmes  being 
costly and time consuming. In response to these logistical 
challenges,  there  is  an  emerging  literature  examining  the 
effectiveness of online e-health interventions, which target 
resilience in the workplace.44 While e-health interventions 
offer some potential solutions to the logistic challenges asso-
ciated with effective resilience training, our review demon-
strates the lack of currently available evidence regarding the 
effectiveness of online resilience training and highlights the 
needs for trials examining this possibility.

The issue of resilience and the possible benefits of resil-
ience training are particularly relevant to high risk indus-
tries,  such  as  the  medical  workforce  or  first  responders. 
Regular exposure to trauma or distress is very likely within 
such workforces, which leads to heightened rates of mental 
health problems.45 46 Longitudinal studies of these high-risk 
workforces  have  begun  to  show  that  self-report  resilience 
scales, similar to those used in the studies found in this review, 
can predict which workers will develop mental health prob-
lems during their career.47 Given the results of this review, 
which suggest that certain types of resilience training can 
modify these predictor variables, it is reasonable to consider 
whether those entering careers such as medicine, nursing, 
policing, paramedicine or firefighting should be provided 
with resilience training. Some professions, such as nursing, 
have begun to consider this possibility.48 In others, such as 
medicine, routine provision of resilience training remains 
very rare. Previous qualitative studies of doctors have found 
that  a  belief  that  ‘doctors  are  invincible’  is  very  common 
among those within the medical profession.49 These types 
of  misperceptions  will  need  to  be  addressed  if  additional 
resilience training is to become an acceptable part of career 
development within such industries.
