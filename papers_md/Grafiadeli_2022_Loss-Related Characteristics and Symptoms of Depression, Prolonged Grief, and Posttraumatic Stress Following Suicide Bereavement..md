Abstract: (1) Background: The aim of the present study was to examine symptom classes of major
depressive disorder (MDD), prolonged grief disorder (PGD), and posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) in a sample of suicide-bereaved individuals, while accounting for loss-related characteristics.
(2) Methods: A latent class analysis was conducted to identify classes of the suicide bereaved,
sharing symptom proﬁles, in a German suicide-bereaved sample (N = 159). (3) Results: Our analyses
revealed three main classes: a resilient class (16%), a class with high endorsement probability for PGD
symptoms (50%), and a class with high endorsement probability for combined PGD/PTSD symptoms
(34%). Prolonged grief and intrusive symptoms emerged across all classes, while MDD showed low
endorsement probability. Our results indicate an association between class membership and time
passed since the loss; however, this applies only to the comparison between the PGD and the resilient
class, and not for the PGD/PTSD class. (4) Conclusions: Our results may provide information about
the predictability of symptom clusters following suicide bereavement. The ﬁndings also represent
a signiﬁcant step towards tailoring treatments based on the needs of relevant suicide-bereaved
subgroups through a symptom-level approach. Time passed since loss might explain differences
between symptom clusters.

1. Introduction

Suicide bereavement represents a widely recognized stressor conferring risk for mental
disorders and negative social outcomes. The increasing attention on the vulnerability of
this population to forming maladaptive emotional reactions has led to the development of
several psychological interventions over the past decade [1]. Despite the variety of existing
interventions for suicide-bereaved individuals, results from existing efﬁcacy studies indi-
cate only small to medium effect sizes, while the superiority of psychological interventions
over unspeciﬁc interventions has not been consistently shown [1,2]. The lack of robustness
of these effects might be an indication of a not-yet-fully developed understanding of the
speciﬁc needs of this high-risk population.

According to a population-based study in Canada, nearly half of suicide-bereaved
parents develop at least one mental health disorder within two years after the bereavement
(Bolton et al., 2013 [3]). A register-based cohort study from Denmark revealed an increased
risk for the development of mental disorders in suicide-bereaved spouses when compared
to the general population, or spouses bereaved through other means [4]. Research has
shown that suicide bereavement is associated with a high risk for the development of
emotional disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and
speciﬁcally posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [3,5,6]. Additionally, a high proportion of

those bereaved show persisting grief reactions, with increased probability for the devel-
opment of a prolonged grief disorder (PGD), with prevalence rates ranging between 7%
and 10% [7–11]. Additionally, a co-occurrence of these disorders following bereavement is
commonly observed [3,12]. Recent estimates on post-loss symptomatology indicate that
63% of bereaved individuals with PGD show co-occurring depression, while 49% show a
PTSD comorbidity [13].

The examination of this co-occurrence following bereavement has received increased
attention over the past decade. PGD has been included in the ICD-11 [14] and was only
recently introduced as a distinct disorder in the text revision of the DSM-5 (DSM-5-TR;
APA 2020 [15]). PGD is characterized by elevated and persistent grief following the loss
of a signiﬁcant person while causing functional impairment to the individual. PGD is
mainly characterized by a persistent yearning or longing for the deceased individual.
Research notes the high relatedness of emotional disorders, especially between PGD, MDD,
and PTSD. Despite the close similarities of these disorders, several main differences exist.
For example, while PGD and PTSD share symptoms of intrusion and avoidance, the
expressions of these symptoms differentiate. While trauma-related avoidance is associated
with fear, bereavement-related avoidance is often associated with loss-related aspects such
as (positive) memories of the deceased and separation distress. Sufﬁcient insight into the
overlap of emotional disorders exists, as well as with regard to their distinctiveness [16,17].
Following a person-centered approach using latent class analysis (LCA) research on
psychological sequelae following bereavement, researchers examined classes of patients
presenting similar symptom proﬁles. LCA represents a powerful method of cluster analysis
that can be used to identify patterns of similar responses for categorical indicator variables
(e.g., symptom present or symptom absent). The goal is to create a set of exclusive latent
classes; that is, to split respondents into groups with homogeneous symptom proﬁles.
This approach has been previously used in bereavement literature to examine symptom
proﬁles of the three most commonly prevalent syndromes in bereaved individuals: MDD,
PGD, and PTSD. For instance, Djelantik and colleagues (2017) [18] used this approach to
investigate symptom clusters of MDD, PGD, and PTSD in a bereaved community sample,
revealing three classes of symptoms: a PGD class (48%), a PGD and PTSD symptom proﬁle
class (27%), and a resilient class (25%). Another study applying LCA to a trauma-exposed
bereaved sample revealed four classes: a resilient class (13%), a class with prominent PGD
and MDD symptoms (23%), a class with PGD and PTSD symptoms (20%), and a class with
MDD, PGD, and PTSD symptoms (45%) [19]. A study including a disaster-bereaved sample
again revealed three classes as the best ﬁt: a resilient class with low probability of MDD,
PGD, and PTSD symptoms (20%), a class characterized only by PGD symptoms (41.8%), and
a combined class with a moderate to high probability for the presence of all three symptom
clusters (38.2%) [20]. One recent study focusing on a recently bereaved sample examined
symptoms of MDD, PGD, and PTSD within the ﬁrst 6 months of bereavement and revealed
again a three-class symptom proﬁle: a low-symptom class (35.4%), a predominantly PGD
class (29.8%), and a high-symptom proﬁle class (34.8%) including symptoms of all symptom
clusters [21]. For a summary of the main ﬁndings of previous latent class research following
bereavement, see Figure 1.

While existing research highlights the predominant role of PGD symptoms in bereaved
populations, the examination of these symptom clusters in suicide-bereaved individuals
remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify classes regarding symptoms
of MDD, PGD, and PTSD in a German sample of suicide-bereaved individuals by examining
patterns of symptom co-occurrence. We additionally aimed to examine possible differences
in symptom severity based on loss-related characteristics such as kinship and the period of
time since the loss. The examination of symptom clusters may offer important insights for
the reﬁnement of psychological treatments for the suicide bereaved.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants and Procedure

Participant data were derived from a help-seeking sample, which completed the
assessment for participation in a randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness
of an online group intervention for suicide-bereaved adults [22]. The study protocol was
approved by the review board of the Medical School Hamburg. Participant recruitment took
place primarily through support organizations for bereaved individuals in Germany, as well
as through online advertisements. After signing the informed consent form, participants
aged between 18 and 75 years were invited to complete the online screening assessment,
followed by a telephone interview conducted by the study coordinators. Participants
with acute suicidality, self-harm, current psychosis, alcohol or substance abuse, severe
depression (BDI > 35), bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder were not eligible
for participation in the trial. This resulted in a total number of N = 159 participants who
completed the screening assessment.

2.2. Variables and Measures

Sociodemographic variables included in our analysis were gender, age of the bereaved,
education, and marital status. Loss-related variables comprised the age of the bereaved
since the day of loss, and relationship to the deceased.

Due to the limitation of the number of item inclusions in the LCA analysis, a subset
of core symptoms for each disorder in correspondence with the diagnostic criteria of the
ICD-11 and/or DSM-5 was included. In case of overlap of items between two disorders,
items were included in the category which we considered more representative. The items
of each questionnaire were dichotomized in 0 (=symptom absent for lower item ratings)
and 1 (=symptom present for higher item ratings), based on prior research examining latent
class symptom proﬁles of bereaved individuals [19,23].

Symptoms of depression were assessed with the revised German version of the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown., 1996 [24]; Hautzinger, Keller, Kühner,
& Beck, 2009 [25]), assessing depressive symptom severity. Each symptom is formu-
lated as four statements with increasing levels of severity (e.g., sadness/depressed mood:

While existing research highlights the predominant role of PGD symptoms in be-reaved populations, the examination of these symptom clusters in suicide-bereaved indi-viduals remains unclear.

0 = “I do feel sad”–3 = “I am so sad and unhappy I cannot stand it”). We selected 7 out of
21 BDI-II items in accordance with depressive disorder symptoms in the ICD-11. We
included both “worthlessness” and “guilt”, as these symptoms were especially relevant
for the suicide-bereaved sample. Furthermore, we excluded the item “concentration dif-
ﬁculty”, as there was an overlap with the scale for posttraumatic stress symptoms, as
well as “suicide ideation”, as acute suicidality represented one of the exclusion criteria for
participation in the study (for an overview of the included items and the corresponding
symptom description, see Table 1). Based on a previously set cut-off from previous research
conducting LCA analyses with the BDI-II, each item was considered absent (=0) if rated
with 0 or 1, while it was considered present (=1) if rated with 2 or 3 [18].

Symptoms of prolonged grief were assessed with the German version of the Inventory
of Complicated Grief (ICG; Prigerson et al., 1995 [26]; ICG-D; Lumbeck, Brandstaetter,
& Geissner, 2012 [27]). We selected 8 out of 19 items of the ICG corresponding closely
to the diagnostic criteria proposed by Prigerson et al.
(2009) [28], allowing a reliable
distinction from other mental health disorders (Bellini et al., 2018; Boelen, 2013; Stroebe,
Schut, & Van den Bout, 2013 [10,16,29,30]). According to previous studies conducting LCA
research using the ICG, we created dichotomized indicator variables for each included item
(Djelantik et al., 2017; Lenferink et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018 [18,20,31]). Each item was
deﬁned as symptom absent (=0) for ratings between 1 = “never” to 2 = “rarely” and was
considered as symptom present (=1) for ratings between 3 = “sometimes” to 5 = “always”.
Symptoms of posttraumatic stress were measured with the use of the adapted ver-
sion of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; Horowitz et al., 1979 [32]; Maercker &
Schützwohl, 1998 [33]), which assesses symptoms of PTSD. Items were selected as corre-
sponding to the DSM-5 categories for intrusion symptoms (thoughts, images, dreams),
avoidance of thoughts and behavior (reminders, thoughts, numbness), and changes in
arousal and reactivity (irritability/anger, concentration difﬁculties). Aiming for consistency
of dichotomization, we set a similar cut-off as described for the measures above. A symp-
tom rating between 0 = “not at all” and 1 = “minimal” was deﬁned as symptom absent (=0)
while ratings between 2 = “moderately” and 4 = “extremely” were considered as symptom
present (=1).

2.3. Data Analysis

The ﬁrst part of the statistical analysis was conducted in RStudio, version 4.0.0 (RStudio
Team, Boston, MA, USA 2020 [34]). No examination of missing data was necessary, as
a full adherence at the screening assessment was a prerequisite for participation in the
trial. To identify classes of suicide-bereaved individuals with comparable MDD, PGD, and
PTSD symptom proﬁles, the poLCA package was used [35]. The estimation process began
with two latent class proﬁles, while increasing the number of proﬁles in order to ﬁnd the
optimal number of classes. For the identiﬁcation of model ﬁt, the following indices were
examined: Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10277

5 of 10

and entropy (classiﬁcation quality). As indicated in previous research, lower AIC and BIC
values and higher entropy values indicate better ﬁt [36]. Furthermore, an additional LCA
was conducted, adding important covariates in our model.

3. Results
3.1. Sociodemograhic Characteristics

The sample consisted of 159 adults (n = 142, 89.3% female) with a mean age of 40.62
(SD = 12.67) years. The majority of the sample was in a relationship (n = 31, 19.5%) or
married (n= 45, 28.3%), and had received a degree from vocational school, university
or higher (69.8%). The sample included ﬁrst-degree bereaved relatives (n = 102; 64.2%),
bereaved spouses or partners (n = 36, 22.6%), and bereaved friends, colleagues, or others
(n = 21, 13.2%). The mean age of the bereaved individual at the time of loss was 41.45
(SD = 17.02) years. The mean time since the loss was 28.18 (SD = 55.77) months. For an
overview of all sociodemographic and loss-related characteristics, see Table 2.

The ﬁt indices for the latent class proﬁles are listed in Table 3. Based on the goodness-of-
ﬁt indices, three class solutions appeared adequate with a better ﬁt and interpretability, and
were therefore retained. We considered a value of >0.60 as a high probability of symptom
endorsement [19,37]. The three-class model revealed one resilient class (class 1; 16% of
the sample), one class with a higher probability for some symptoms of PGD and intrusion
symptoms of PTSD (class 2; 50% sample), and one class with prominent symptoms of PGD
and PTSD (class 3; 34% of the sample). The distinct symptom occurrences are presented
in Figure 2.

In class one (resilient class), only the PGD items “longing for the deceased” and “up-
setting memories”, as well as the PTSD item “intrusive thoughts”, had a high probability
of endorsement. In class two (PGD class), all PGD items except “disconnection” and “life
is empty” showed a high endorsement probability, while this was again observed for
the intrusion items of PTSD “intrusive thoughts” and “intrusive images”. In class three

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10277

(combined PGD and PTSD class), all PGD items and PTSD items except “intrusive dreams”
and “numbness” had a high endorsement probability. This is the only class in which a
symptom of depression showed higher endorsement, though this only applied to the item
“sadness”. In general, symptoms of PGD and especially “longing” and “upsetting memo-
ries”, similar to the PTSD item “intrusive thoughts”, had a high endorsement probability
in all classes, while the probability for endorsement of all depressive symptoms, besides
“sadness”, was low.

We extended our analysis by adding important covariates to our LCA analysis. Table 4
depicts differences between the classes regarding sociodemographic (age, gender) and
loss-related (kinship, time passed since day of loss) variables between the classes. The ﬁrst
(resilient) class was used as the class of reference. No statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the classes for age, gender, or kinship were found. Time passed since the day of
loss was the only variable signiﬁcantly associated with the class membership. However,
this signiﬁcance only applied to differences between the PGD and the resilient class. Time
since loss appeared lower for individuals in the PGD class compared to the resilient class.

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study employing LCA to explore classes of MDD,
PGD, and PTSD symptoms in a suicide-bereaved sample. Half of the examined population
showed mainly elevated PGD symptom endorsement, while one-third of the included
sample showed high PGD and PTSD symptom endorsement. PGD symptoms had a high
endorsement probability for all classes, while no pattern of increased MDD symptom
endorsement was revealed. A tendency towards higher endorsement probability for one
MDD item appeared, but only in the class characterized by increased combined PGD and
PTSD endorsement.

Our ﬁndings are in line with previous research focusing on community or trauma-
exposed samples showing classes of patients with increased PGD and with combined
PGD and PTSD symptom endorsement [18,19]. Based on the ﬁndings of this symptom
approach, it becomes clear that the targeted treatment of PGD reactions might be especially
valuable for the highest proportion of the population. “Longing/ yearning” appears to be
the most predominant symptom across all classes, independent of the time passed since the
loss [18,23]. Additionally, our ﬁndings are in line with research stressing the need to pay
attention to treatment options targeting comorbid PGD and PTSD symptoms [18,19,38].
Again, intrusive posttraumatic stress symptoms and in particular “intrusive thoughts”
showed high endorsement in all classes. Our ﬁndings offer an indication that time since
the loss might play a role in PGD symptom reduction, while there is no similar indication
for comorbid PGD/PTSD symptoms.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, the assessment for comorbid treatment of PTSD appears crucial for those
bereaved through suicide. Similarly, the ﬁnding that a subgroup of participants appeared
to be affected by combined symptoms of PGD, PTSD, and only to a lesser extent by MDD
symptoms, agrees with previous research focusing on bereaved individuals [18,23,39]. Thus,
one partial explanation for our ﬁndings could be the exclusion of more severe depression.
Including severely depressed bereaved individuals might have led to differential ﬁndings.
Several limitations should be noted. First, our data are based on self-report ques-
tionnaires, leading to strengthened associations between variables. Second, our sample

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10277

8 of 10

consisted mainly of female, highly educated adults. Future studies should aim to examine
larger and more heterogeneous suicide-bereaved samples. Third, there was a wide range
regarding the time since bereavement, ranging from less than one month to more than
20 years. A high percentage of participants were bereaved for more than 6 months, which is
the prerequisite for a PGD diagnosis [28]. Furthermore, there was not a full correspondence
with the diagnostic criteria, in contrast to the ICD-11 and DSM-5 criteria. In our approach,
which aimed at minimizing the number of items for the analysis and including only the
most characteristic symptoms of each disorder, we intentionally excluded doubled items
(e.g., “anger”, “concentration difﬁculties”) which simultaneously resemble symptoms of
more than one clinical diagnosis category. Through including all items, it appears likely
that symptom endorsement would increase as the interrelatedness of symptoms would
increase [16,17]. Thus, assessing formal diagnoses was beyond the scope of the present
study. A replication of our ﬁndings on a larger population, while also examining the full
spectrum of ICD-11 and DSM-5 criteria, is needed.

Notwithstanding the above-mentioned limitations, this study offers an important
ﬁrst insight into subgroups of those bereaved through suicide, based on a symptom-level
approach. This was examined in a sample with a wide range of time elapsed since the
loss, and with different levels of kinship or relationship to the deceased. We found three
distinct classes of suicide bereavement, with participants appearing to be especially af-
fected by PGD symptoms, commonly combined with the presence of PTSD symptoms, and
especially with symptoms of intrusion. In line with previous ﬁndings on bereavement,
our ﬁndings highlight the necessity for concurrent treatment for PGD and PTSD for the
suicide bereaved [18]. Taking the traumatic circumstances following a violent death and
the exposure when discovering the deceased into account, it is not surprising that this
population shows an increased risk for developing PTSD [40]. Moreover, previous research
underlines the relatedness of PGD and PTSD, suggesting that the likelihood of yearning for
the deceased is higher for individuals who experience death-related intrusive thoughts and
memories related to the circumstances of death [41]. This attempt to avoid painful expe-
riences appears to mediate the relationship between the traumatic distress and yearning.
Trauma-focused, exposure-based treatments targeting PGD and PTSD symptoms simulta-
neously, while promoting the development of a comprehensive narrative, could represent
effective treatment options for those bereaved through suicide [42,43]. It appears likely that
a targeted treatment for PGD and PTSD could lead to simultaneous MDD symptom relief.
