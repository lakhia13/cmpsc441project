Abstract: Effective communication by nursing home staff is related to a higher quality of life 
and a decrease in verbal and physical aggression and depression in nursing home residents. 
Several communication intervention studies have been conducted to improve communication 
between nursing home staff and nursing home residents with dementia. These studies have 
shown  that  communication  skills  training  can  improve  nursing  aides’  communication  with 
nursing home residents. However, these studies tended to be time-consuming and fairly difficult 
to implement. Moreover, these studies focused on the communicative benefits for the nursing 
home residents and their well-being, while benefits and well-being for the nursing aides were 
neglected. The current study focused on implementing a brief communication skills training 
program to improve nursing aides’ (N=24) communication with residents with dementia (N=26) 
in a nursing home. The effects of the training on nursing aides’ communication, caregiver distress, 
and job satisfaction and residents’ psychopathology and agitation were assessed relative to a 
control group condition. Nursing aides in the intervention group were individually trained to 
communicate effectively with residents during morning care by using short instructions, posi-
tive speech, and biographical statements. Mixed ANOVAs showed that, after training, nursing 
aides in the intervention group experienced less caregiver distress. Additionally, the number 
of short instructions and instances of positive speech increased. Providing nursing aides with 
helpful feedback during care aids communication and reduces caregiver burden, even with a 
brief intervention that requires limited time investments for nursing home staff.

Introduction
Nursing home residents spend a lot of time in each other’s company and with nurs-
ing home staff, yet social interactions are limited. Interaction between nursing aides 
and nursing home residents accounts for only 10.7% of the time the aides spend in 
the nursing home,1 and communication is of a rather neutral and task-oriented style, 
rather than a positive and personal one.2 This is a missed opportunity, because effective 
communication is related to a higher quality of life,3 lower depression rates, and lower 
frequencies of verbal and physical aggression4 in nursing home residents.

What  typically  happens  in  nursing  homes  is  that  nursing  home  staff  are  over-
accommodating in their communication style  when interacting with nursing  home 
residents,  particularly  those  with  dementia,  based  on  stereotypes  regarding  these 
residents’ competencies. This is called the Communication Predicament Of Aging.5 
Elderspeak, a communication style with high pitch, exaggerated intonation, simpli-
fied grammar, and slow speech,6 is a common communication style among nursing

home staff. Although  well intentioned, elderspeak decreases 
the chances of effective communication, because residents 
are not taken seriously as an interaction partner and, con-
sequently, are talked to rather than talked with. Elderspeak 
reduces self-confidence among nursing home residents and 
contributes to mental and physical declines in the long run, 
because there are no frequent or high-quality interactions. 
These declines then reinforce the negative stereotypes one 
has regarding nursing home residents.7

It is not surprising, then, that several studies have focused 
on improving communication in nursing homes to break the 
circle of patronizing speech or elderspeak. One way to do this 
is with the Communication Enhancement Model.8 This model 
illustrates an intervention in which communication partners of 
the elderly adopt new, facilitating, rather than directing, roles 
and utilize new communication skills that match the level and 
individual needs of the older person they are talking to. This 
approach empowers the person being talked to, optimizes their 
well-being and level of cognitive functioning, and improves 
communication skills. Although this is a fairly general model 
that can be employed in different circumstances and for differ-
ent populations, it also allows for a more targeted approach to 
improve communicative interactions in a certain setting. 

Several communication intervention studies have been 
conducted to improve communication between nursing home 
staff and nursing home residents, including residents with 
dementia. Two communication intervention studies focused 
exclusively on improving communication skills and decreas-
ing elderspeak in nursing homes.9,10 The results from both 
studies9,10  showed  that,  after  training,  nursing  aides  used 
elderspeak and authoritarian speech to a smaller extent and 
had a more respectful, caring, and less controlling style of 
speech toward residents than before they were trained.10

Another communication intervention study used memory 
books  to  improve  communication  in  nursing  homes  for 
residents with moderate cognitive impairments.11 Personal-
ized memory books contained biographical information and 
daily schedules that the residents could share with others. In 
addition, nursing aides were taught to use the memory books 
when interacting with the residents as part of a communica-
tion skills program. It was thought that  including  memory 
books in conversations would help to increase communica-
tion  between  residents  as  well  as  communication  between 
residents  and  staff.  Moreover,  care  information  contained 
in the memory books could help to increase residents’ inde-
pendent functioning during care routines and function as a 
distraction to decrease disruptive behaviors. The results of 

the  study11   indicated  that  nursing  aides  in  the  intervention 
group talked more and displayed more positive communica-
tion with residents after receiving the training than before, 
without spending more time on care. A similar intervention, 
but  conducted  on  a  larger  scale,  demonstrated  benefits  of 
communication training with regard to both the quantity and 
quality of communication.2 There were more verbal interac-
tions between nursing home staff and residents after training, 
and the communication style became more positive, social, 
and personal than before.

A communication intervention that purely focused on com-
munication between nursing aides and residents with dementia 
involved training about effective verbal and nonverbal com-
munication techniques through role play.12 Basic strategies for 
effective communication were discussed, such as making sure 
that residents were wearing their glasses or hearing aids when 
they needed them. Additionally, strategies for communicating 
effectively with residents with problem behaviors were taught. 
Results of this Nursing Assistant Communication Skills Pro-
gram (NACSP) were that residents’ well-being improved after 
the intervention, and they exhibited depressive symptoms and 
verbally aggressive behavior to a lesser extent 3 and 6 months 
later compared to before the staff were trained.

In the FOCUSED communication intervention program, 
which was specifically targeted at patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease, nursing aides were educated regarding the difficul-
ties in communication and language that these patients often 
experience.13 Also, strategies for effective communication 
in  different  stages  of  language  deterioration  were  taught, 
such as using short sentences and closed-ended questions. 
Results showed that the training program enhanced nursing 
aides’  knowledge  of  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  improved 
their attitudes toward patients. After training, nursing aides 
were  more  satisfied  with  their  communication  with  the 
patients.  For  example,  they  experienced  a  greater  feeling 
of  control  during  communication.  Nursing  aides  reported 
that their newly acquired skills would cause them to try to 
communicate with residents more.

Overall, the abovementioned intervention studies were all 
effective  in  demonstrating  improvements  in  communication 
between nursing home staff and residents with dementia. These 
residents all suffer from degenerative memory loss and problems 
with learning and communication. Frustration with their impair-
ments in these various cognitive domains may therefore lead 
to agitation and the display of problem behaviors. If staff are 
trained to understand the causes of these behaviors and receive 
strategies for adequately responding to these behaviors by using

more appropriate communication techniques, then substantial 
improvement  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of  communication 
between  residents  and  staff  is  possible,  as  are  subsequent 
improvements in well-being among nursing home residents.

The present study included the best components of these 
intervention studies and the Communication Enhancement 
Model, but in a brief, portable format. A drawback of most 
previous  intervention  studies  is  that  they  were  time-con-
suming for the researchers and nursing home staff12,13 and 
rather invasive for nursing home residents, with a number of 
these studies involving the presence of a research team from 
early morning until close to bedtime.2,11 Moreover, all stud-
ies discussed above focused on the communicative benefits 
for the residents and their well-being, whereas well-being 
of the nursing aides was generally not taken into account. 
Therefore, the current study implemented a brief, small-scale 
communication skills training program that aimed to improve 
the  quantity  and  quality  of  nursing  aides’  communication 
with residents. Secondary benefits were expected to occur 
with regard to a reduction in caregiver distress, an increase 
in nursing aides’ job satisfaction, and decreases in depression 
and problem behaviors among nursing home residents. If suc-
cessful, this brief intervention could be implemented more 
easily compared to the interventions previously discussed in 
a wide variety of settings, as fewer restrictions with regard to 
the setting and time would be involved and the burden placed 
on nursing home staff could be kept to a minimum. 

Methods
Participants
Participants  in  this  study  were  the  nursing  aides  and 
residents of a nursing home for people with dementia in the 
Netherlands. 

nursing staff
Nursing aides were recruited in staff meetings. Based on this 
criterion and the research schedule, the final nursing staff 
sample consisted of 24 nursing aides. Temporary employees 
were excluded from participation, because staff were required 
to be available for participation in all research phases. Two 
nursing aides were excluded during the study due to their 
unavailability during training and postintervention observa-
tions. There were no significant a priori differences between 
the intervention and control group (P0.05) on demographic 
characteristics. In the whole sample, 91.67% were certified 
nursing assistants, and 8.33% were licensed practical nurses. 
The mean age was 43.21 years.

residents
Prior to the study, a letter of consent was sent to residents’ 
family  members  or  representatives.  Fifty-two  consented 
to  the  resident  participating.  Twenty-two  residents  were 
excluded,  one  because  of  a  life  expectancy  of  less  than  6 
months, and 21 for different reasons, for example, not being 
able to complete the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) due 
to communication problems or  unwillingness to participate. 
The  MMSE  was  used  to  assess  the  severity  of  cognitive 
impairment.14,15 This instrument can distinguish people with 
dementia from other patient groups and control groups. In 
this  study,  the  MMSE  (including  the  conversation  held 
during the assessment) was also used to determine whether 
residents were sufficiently communicative for participation 
in the study. Four residents were excluded because of low 
MMSE scores. The final sample consisted of 26 residents. 
All residents had a dementia diagnosis. There were no sig-
nificant  a  priori  differences  between  the  intervention  and 
control group (P0.05) demographic characteristics. In the 
whole sample, the mean age was 84.95 years and the mean 
MMSE score was 11.17.

Measurement
The measurements used were adaptations from existing com-
munication intervention programs that included observations 
of  communicative  interactions  between  nursing  aides  and 
residents.1,2,11

Communication skills checklists
Nursing  aides’  communication  was  assessed  with  two 
communication skills checklists. First, the Communication 
Skills Checklist (CSC)2 was used to measure the quantity of 
effective and ineffective instructions, positive and negative 
speech,  and  biographical  statements.  Additionally,  it  was 
used to assess if activities of care were announced and if the 
resident was called by name. The interrater reliability in the 
current study was 75.40%. 

The second checklist, the Observation Form of General 
Communication (OFGC), was designed for this study to be 
able to measure general characteristics of speech. With this 
checklist,  the  frequency  of  positive,  neutral,  and  negative 
speech  was  tallied.  These  frequencies  were  then  summed 
to form the total frequency of speech. Speech was labeled 
positive,  neutral,  or  negative  depending  on  the  content 
(for example, a compliment was labeled as positive, while 
unhelpful comments were labeled as negative). The interrater 
reliability was 78.80%.

Questionnaires
The Dutch version of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inven-
tory  (CMAI-D)  was  used  to  measure  the  frequency  of  29 
agitated behaviors displayed by residents during the preceding 
2 weeks. The interrater reliability of the CMAI is sufficient.16 
The construct validity of the Dutch version is confirmed for 
nursing home residents with dementia.17 

The  Dutch  version  of  the  Neuropsychiatric  Inventory 
Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to measure the severity of 
different types of psychopathology in residents and to assess 
the level of caregiver distress experienced by nursing aides 
because of these symptoms. The interrater reliability and the 
convergent validity of the NPI-Q are sufficient.18

Nursing  aides’  job  satisfaction  was  assessed  with  the 
short, Dutch version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale 
(UWES). This instrument measures three dimensions of work 
engagement: vigor, dedication, and absorption. The internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α) is sufficient, and the three-factor 
structure has been confirmed.19 

Design and procedure
Similar  to  other  intervention  programs,  this  study  had  a 
two-group  comparison  design.2,11  One  ward  served  as  the 
intervention group, and the other ward served as the control 
group. The two wards were completely separate: residents 
from different wards could not contact each other. The study 
was conducted in four phases: group assignment, baseline 
observations,  training,  and  postintervention  observations. 
Both observation phases had the same procedure and were 
conducted in both groups. The total time period from baseline 
through the postintervention phase was 8 weeks. With this 
pretest/posttest design and intervention group/control group 
comparison, it was possible to demonstrate improvements 
over time within groups (from baseline to postintervention) 
and to demonstrate improvements in the intervention group 
only after training.

group assignment
Similar  to  previous  intervention  studies,  the  MMSE  was 
administered  to  the  residents  in  both  groups.  Wards  were 
randomly assigned to an intervention and control group.2,11 

Observation phases
The observations were conducted by two observers. Multiple 
practice  sessions  were  held  to  maximize  interobserver 
agreement.20 Use of the checklists was practiced by observing 
interactions between staff and residents in living rooms in the 
nursing home and by watching videos of interactions between 

nursing aides and residents.20 During the last practice session, 
interrater reliability was calculated.

During both observation phases, communication check-
lists  and  questionnaires  were  administered  to  the  nursing 
staff. In the mornings, during residents’ activities of daily 
living,  nursing  aides’  communication  was  observed  from 
behind  a  door  or  curtain,  because,  to  be  able  to  measure 
communication,  hearing  the  conversations  was  sufficient. 
During  these  observations,  the  two  communication  skills 
checklists  (CSC  and  OFGC)  were  used  to  record  nursing 
aides’ communication. Administration of one checklist took 5 
minutes. The CSC was administered at least twice to the same 
nursing aide and the OFGC was administered at least four 
times. Each nursing aide was observed interacting with dif-
ferent residents. It was not possible to always assess the same 
aide/resident dyad during both observation phases, because 
the usual work routine in the nursing home was followed to 
reduce the burden placed on the staff by the study. Also, some 
residents moved away or died during the study. 

After  each  morning  of  observation,  the  nursing  aides 
were asked to complete some of the questionnaires (NPI-Q, 
CMAI,  UWES)  described  above.  Nursing  aides  received 
instructions on how to fill in these questionnaires. After the 
final baseline observation, nursing aides were given a form 
which contained information about the purpose of the training 
and the communication skills that would be taught. This form 
was explained by the researchers. 

Training
The training program addressed communication skills suit-
able for different types of dementia. The number of training 
sessions for each nursing aide was based on the mean scores 
on  the  CSC  during  baseline.  For  each  aide,  all  effective 
skills were added up (short instructions, general instructions, 
biographical  statements,  positive  speech).  Subsequently, 
the  ineffective  elements  (multiple  instructions,  negative 
speech) were subtracted. The seven nursing aides with the 
lowest resulting scores received two training sessions; the 
others with higher scores received one session. This way, 
in  the  brief  time  available  for  the  study,  as  many  nursing 
aides as possible received the communication training and 
the intensity was based on the extent to which they already 
possessed the relevant skills. 

During  the  training  of  the  intervention  group,  nursing 
aides were individually observed during residents’ activities 
of daily living. The CSC was used to record the use of specific 
communication skills and types of instructions. During these 
observations, nursing aides were observed interacting with

several residents, to make sure enough feedback could be 
provided. After these observations, nursing aides received 
feedback on their communication. First, they were asked how 
they had experienced the observed interactions. Subsequently, 
they received feedback on which effective communication 
skills  and  instructions  (short  instructions,  general  instruc-
tions, biographical statements, positive speech) they had used 
and which they should have used. They were encouraged to 
keep using the effective communication skills they had used 
and to start using the skills they had not used. If they had not 
used an effective skill, the use and purpose of the skill were 
explained.  Finally,  if  nursing  aides  used  ineffective  skills 
(multiple instructions, negative speech), it was explained to 
nursing aides why they should not use these skills. 

Preparation of analyses
The  scores  on  the  different  items  of  each  questionnaire 
(UWES, CMAI-D, NPI-Q symptoms, NPI-Q caregiver dis-
tress) were added up to form the total scores. Average scores 
on each skill on the communication skills checklists were 
calculated for baseline and postintervention measurements 
for each nursing aide. 

Data  were  analyzed  using  2  (group)  ×  2  (time)  mixed 
analyses of variance (ANOVAs). These were the same analy-
ses as in other intervention studies.2,11 For significant main or 
interaction effects, partial eta-squared scores were calculated, 
for which 0.01 was considered a small effect, 0.06 a medium 
effect, and 0.14 a large effect.21 Data regarding the quantity of 
positive and negative speech on the CSC were not analyzed, 

because these were measured for training purposes only and 
these variables were also measured with the OFGC.

Results
nursing staff
Nursing staff’s communication skills when interacting with 
residents were assessed as well as measures of their distress 
that could be attributed to their interactions with residents 
and their job satisfaction.

Communication
Quantity and quality of speech
The mean number of communication skills used is shown 
in  Table  1.  This  table  shows  that  the  style  of  speech  was 
mostly  neutral,  rather  than  positive  or  negative.  Negative 
speech was very uncommon. The percentages of interactions 
in which the resident was called by name and activities of 
care were announced were already very high during baseline 
(80%). 

There  were  no  significant  interactions  between  time 
and group or main effects of group (P0.05) for the dif-
ferent  types  of  communication  skills.  The  main  effect  of 
time was significant for the number of positive statements 
on  the  OFGC,  after  applying  a  Bonferroni  correction 
(F[1,22]=9.10, ηp
=0.29, P0.05). This is a large effect.21 
Table 1 shows that, in both groups, positive speech increased 
with time.

increased  in  the  intervention  group  and  decreased  in  the 
control  group  (F(1,20)=3.64,  P0.10).  However,  in  the 
control group, the maximum score had already been reached 
at baseline, which means that the score could only decrease 
or remain the same.

Quantity and quality of instructions
Table 2 shows the mean number of short, general, and multiple 
instructions.  Short  instructions  were  used  much  more  fre-
quently than multiple instructions. There were no significant 
interactions between time and group for the different types of 
instructions (P0.05). The main effect of time was significant 
2 =0.19, 
for the number of short instructions (F(1,22)=5.10, ηp
P0.05). This is a large effect.21 Table 2 shows that the num-
ber of short instructions increased with time in both groups. 
The main effect of group was significant for the number of 
2 =0.29, P0.01). This 
multiple instructions (F(1,22)=9.12, ηp
is a large effect.21 Table 2 shows that the number of multistep 
instructions was lower in the intervention group than in the 
control group. However, this difference was significant only in 
the postintervention phase (Levene’s t[15]=3.74, P=0.002).

Caregiver distress
Figure  1  shows  the  mean  caregiver  distress  scores  for 
both  groups  during  both  observation  phases.  The  time  × 
2 =0.18, 
group interaction was significant (F(1,24)=5.20, ηp
P0.05)  on  the  caregiver  distress  scores.  This  is  a  large 
effect.21 Figure 1 shows that caregiver distress decreased from 
baseline to postintervention observations in the intervention 
group, whereas the opposite pattern occurred in the control 
group.  This  confirms  the  hypothesis  that  communication 
skills training can decrease nursing aides’ caregiver distress. 
There  were  no  significant  main  effects  of  time  and  group 
(P0.05) for the caregiver distress scores. Note that caregiver 
distress scores were low overall, all mean scores were below 
10, while the maximum score is 60 on the NPI-Q.

Job satisfaction
The mean job satisfaction scores were 46.55 during baseline 
and 45.27 during postintervention observations for the inter-
vention group. For the control group, these scores were 48.31 
and 45.77, respectively. Because the maximum score on the 
UWES is 54, these scores are considered high. There were 
no significant interactions between time and group or main 
effects  of  time  and  group  for  the  job  satisfaction  scores 
(P0.05).  Scores  were  comparable  across  groups,  with  a 
downward trend in the control group.

residents
Residents were evaluated by their nursing aides with regard 
to their level of agitation and psychopathology.

Agitation
The  CMAI-D  covers  problem  behaviors  that  can  be 
expressed  in  the  form  of  verbal  or  physical  aggression, 
as  well  as  inappropriate  behaviors  (eg,  disrobing)  and 
restlessness. The agitation scores on the CMAI-D ranged 
from 29 to 203. For the intervention group, the mean agita-
tion scores were 44.75 during baseline and 44.37 during 
postintervention observations. For the control group, these 
scores were 51.00 and 48.20, respectively. Compared to 
the norms,17 these scores are considered to be somewhat 
above  average.  There  were  no  significant  interactions 
between time and group or main effects of time and group 
for the agitation scores (P0.05). The scores across the 
groups were comparable but, within the groups, there was 
quite a bit of variation.

Psychopathology
Table  3  shows  residents’  mean  psychopathology  scores 
regarding the total severity of psychopathology and the sever-
ity of specific symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. 
Most  symptoms  were  uncommon,  given  the  fact  that  the

phases.

scores were below 1.00 (maximum is 3). An exception was 
the severity of irritability in the control group, which was 
1.30 before and 1.70 after the intervention. 

After  applying  the  Bonferroni  correction,  there  were 
no significant interactions between time and group or main 
effects  of  time  and  group  (P0.05)  regarding  the  total 
severity of psychopathology and that of specific symptoms. 
However, there was a trend for a decrease of the severity of 
psychopathology in the intervention group against an increase 
in the control group (F(1,24)=2.88, P=0.10).

A  correlational  analysis  between  the  severity  of 
irritability and the caregiver distress scores showed positive 
correlations  between  these  two  variables  during  baseline 
(r=0.44, P0.05) and postintervention observations (r=0.53, 
P0.01).

Discussion
This study implemented effective components from previ-
ously  tested  communication  intervention  studies1,2,8,11,12  in 
a  brief,  small-scale,  portable  intervention  in  one  nursing 
home  with  participating  nursing  aides  and  residents  with 
dementia.  Our  short  intervention  also  focused  on  nursing 
aides’ well-being and burden, and was expected to improve 
nursing aides’ communication skills, decrease their levels of 
caregiver distress, and increase their job satisfaction, as well 
as decrease residents’ psychopathology. 

The training focused on using short instructions, positive 
speech, and biographical statements, as these are relatively 
easy  to  teach  to  nursing  home  staff  in  a  relatively  short 
period of time. The results confirmed the hypothesis that, 
from baseline to postintervention observations, the interven-
tion  decreased  the  level  of  caregiver  distress  experienced 
by nursing aides in the intervention group only. Although 
predicted, this outcome is still surprising, given the low level 
of caregiver distress to begin with. This effect coincided with 
a trend of a decrease in the severity of psychopathology in 
the  intervention  group  and  high  correlations  between  the 
severity of residents’ irritability and nursing aides’ caregiver 
distress.

The  outcomes  of  the  observed  interactions  between 
nursing home staff and residents reflect a dynamic interplay 
of how staff experience the stress of caregiving in concor-
dance with negative behaviors by the residents. Decreases 
in caregiver distress in the intervention group could be an 
indication that the training provided a strategy for coping 
better during these interactions. Moreover, trained nursing 
aides may have felt more support as a result of the regular 
and positive feedback from the researchers during training.

This feedback may have made them more aware of the good 
communication skills they already had and developed over 
the course of the training. Feelings of confidence and aware-
ness of good caregiving skills might have given them the 
strength to calmly handle residents’ psychopathology and 
problem behaviors. This process could reflect another loop in 
the Communication Enhancement Model,8 in which nursing 
aides feel empowered when given appropriate feedback on 
their communication skills. The fact that nursing aides in the 
control group did not receive any feedback, yet invested time 
and effort in the study as well, may have contributed to their 
distress. Future research could demonstrate whether or not 
this does, in fact, happen. If so, control group participants 
should be given the opportunity for training after the inter-
vention  group  has  finished.  Other  intervention  programs 
have not reported on these measures, which is why further 
research into this issue is necessary. 

With regard to the communicative interactions, the num-
ber  of  short  instructions  and  instances  of  positive  speech 
increased from baseline to postintervention in both groups. 
This is in accordance with the Communication Enhancement 
Model and the results of intervention studies that demon-
strated the largest improvements in communication during 
one-on-one care interactions of staff with residents.2,11 In the 
present study, nursing aides fulfilled a more facilitative role 
when communicating with residents, taking into account the 
need for positive speech. The effects seemed to spill over 
to some extent to nursing aides in the control group, who 
may have heard about the trained skills during lunch breaks. 
Alternatively, the reappearance of the researchers after the 
training when they worked with nursing aides in the interven-
tion group only may have had a positive effect on the quality 
of interactions between nursing aides and residents. 

The contribution of this intervention study to the field is 
that, despite the relatively limited number of training sessions 
and the presence of good communication skills at baseline, 
the training still yielded positive results. First, the level of 
caregiver distress nursing aides experienced decreased only 
in the intervention group. It may therefore be useful in any 
kind of nursing home to regularly provide feedback on the 
observed skills. This contributes to nursing aides’ well-being 
and raises their confidence regarding their communication 
skills. This feedback should help them to be able to handle 
residents’ problem behaviors better, which may help decrease 
residents’ psychopathology. Although these reasons for the 
decreased caregiver distress seem plausible, future research 
should further examine those components of the training that 
contribute the most to a decrease in caregiver distress. 

Second,  the  communication  training  resulted  in  an 
increase  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of  communication, 
despite  possible  carryover  effects  to  the  control  group. 
Regularly giving nursing aides feedback regarding their care 
interactions with the residents is a good strategy that may not 
only improve their communication skills, but also decrease 
caregiver  distress.  This  process  contributes  to  positive 
interactions between nursing aides and residents, which, in 
turn, might lower residents’ problem behaviors.

There were no direct effects of the intervention on the prob-
lem behaviors or psychopathology of the residents. Previously, 
one communication intervention study demonstrated reduc-
tions in proxy depression scores in the intervention group after 
implementation of a communicative intervention.22 Moreover, 
residents’ problem behaviors were associated with the aides’ 
proxy depression scores, with lower proxy depression scores 
after nursing aides were trained in the intervention group. The 
extent to which problem behaviors occur among nursing home 
residents and are evaluated by nursing home staff as such is 
strongly  associated  with  the  distress  that  their  caregivers 
experience on the job. Training may not only reduce the level 
of distress, but may improve well-being among residents, at 
least as to how it is evaluated by nursing aides.

In future research, these complex relationships should 
be better disentangled in order to assess specific rather 
than combined benefits of communicative strategies on 
how residents feel and act. If, indeed, effective and posi-
tive communication results in improved well-being among 
both  residents  and  nursing  aides,  then  future  training 
programs should focus on regular monitoring during care 
interactions followed by feedback to the nursing aides. 
Possibly, certain problem behaviors may decrease more 
than  others,  which  would  provide  insight  into  specific 
triggers  of  these  problem  behaviors  and  how  they  can 
be reduced. 

Conclusion
This  small-scale  intervention  study  showed  good  results 
with regard to improvements in the quantity and quality of 
communication over time, as well with regard to reductions 
in caregiver distress among trained nursing aides. This could 
be a promising model for future studies that aim to improve 
communication  and  well-being  in  nursing  home  staff  and 
residents without substantial time investment and in a ben-
eficial manner for everyone involved.
