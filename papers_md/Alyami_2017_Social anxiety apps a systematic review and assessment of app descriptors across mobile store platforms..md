AbStrAct
Question  The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (1) to characterise the purpose and description of available social anxiety apps and (2) to 
review the evidence on the effectiveness of social anxiety apps.
Study selection and analysis  A search was conducted on three major mobile platforms: Apple iTunes, Google Play and Windows Store. Apps 
were included if they addressed social anxiety and used an English language interface. A systematic review of the literature from MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science to identify evidence-based evaluations of social anxiety apps was also undertaken.
Findings  Of the 1154 apps identified, 38 apps met the inclusion criteria: iTunes (n=18), Google Play (n=16) and Windows Store (n=4). Over 60% of 
apps were exclusively focused on social anxiety, while the remainder targeted social anxiety and related conditions. Most developers did not provide 
information on their organisational affiliations or their content source. Most apps used multimedia while 17 apps used text only. Finally, although the 
systematic review of the literature identified 94 articles, none of which met inclusion criteria.
conclusions  Social anxiety apps have the potential to overcome barriers to accessing treatment; however, none of the apps identified have had 
studies on their effectiveness published. As the evidence base is lacking, it is therefore not currently possible to recommend their use.

bAckground
Social  anxiety  disorder  is  characterised  by  chronic  fear  and  avoidance  of 
social engagement, scrutiny by others and social withdrawal to avoid feel-
ings of embarrassment and humiliation.1 It is highly prevalent and associated 
with major personal, social and economic burden.1–3 Although epidemiolog-
ical studies on social anxiety have reported varying prevalence, one recent 
systematic review found that the global prevalence rate (after adjusting for 
methodological differences) is approximately 7.3%.4

While  effective  treatments  for  social  anxiety  including  cognitive–
behavioural  therapy  (CBT)  are  available,  and  show  large  effect  sizes5  6 
they are underused.7 Several studies have also investigated the barriers 
to accessing treatment for social anxiety and found a number of contribu-
tors including low mental health literacy,8 geographical restrictions, finan-
cial cost, lack of awareness of existing and effective treatment options, 
health system capacity and fear of stigma.9–11 In a 2010 study, 63.9% of 
respondents reported concerns about financial cost as the main barrier 
to  seeking  treatment,  followed  by  uncertainty  of  where  to  seek  help 
(63.2%), and long appointment waitlists (52.1%).10

Non-traditional  methods  of  treatment  delivery  such  as  mobile  appli-
cations  (apps)  can  widen  the  reach  of  mental  health  services12–14  and 
address  barriers  to  treatment.  Indeed,  by  2012  more  than  31%  of  all 
health  apps  available  on  the  Apple  iTunes  Store  were  categorised  as 
mental health and healthy eating apps15 and is likely to have increased 
since then. Several of these apps are designed to address anxiety and 
their  purpose  may  range  from  symptom  monitoring  and  psychoeduca-
tion  through  to  assessment  and  management.  Ideally,  apps  should  be 
evidence based, incorporate appropriate therapies such as CBT, provide 
validated  mental  health  information,  have  utility  for  real-time  engage-
ment/gamification/reminders, and easily found and accessed.16 However, 
due to the lack of empirical evidence, the effectiveness of many apps is 
questionable.17

Apps for a variety of mental health disorders/medical conditions such 
as  depression,18  schizophrenia,19  bipolar  affective  disorder,20  cancer21 
and  diabetes22  have  been  previously  reviewed.  However,  no  review  of 
social anxiety apps has been undertaken previously.

objectiveS
The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  characterise  the  purpose  and 
description  of  available  social  anxiety  apps.  This  was  also  comple-
mented by a systematic review of the literature to identify any previous 
evaluations of social anxiety apps. We asked the following questions:
1.  What  social  anxiety  apps  are  currently  available  to  mobile  (iOS, 

Android, Windows) users?

2.  What are the characteristics of these apps in terms of information 
provided  about  their  development  (developer  affiliations/content 
source/evidence-based/theory-driven/trials to assess effectiveness/
free to use/in-app purchases)?

3.  What  are  the  main  purposes  of  social  anxiety  apps  (education/
screening/monitoring/diagnosis/treatment/support/multipurpose)?

Study Selection And AnAlySiS
overview
We developed a systematic search strategy with the aim of identifying 
all  relevant  social  anxiety  apps  and  effectiveness  studies.  We  under 
took  a  systematic  review  based  on  methodology  used  in  previous 
work,12  18  21  to  guide  both  the  identification  and  characterisation 
of  social  anxiety  apps  found  on  various  mobile  platforms.  We  also 
assessed the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of social anxiety 
apps in the literature.

Mobile application search
In  June  2016,  we  carried  out  a  search  of  the  three  main  app  plat-
forms: Apple (iTunes), Android (Google Play) and Windows (Windows 
Store). We searched across all store categories, rather than restricting 
to a specific category. However, our search was limited to those apps 
that  had  any  of  the  keywords  below  in  the  title  or  app  description. 
Two  authors  (BG,  HA)  conducted  the  search  independently  for  all 
app stores, and data were extracted from app descriptions available. 
Disagreement  on  eligibility  was  resolved  by  iterative  discussion  and 
consensus.

Selection criteria
Identified apps were categorised as either ‘potentially relevant’ or ‘not 
relevant’  according  to  the  app  title  and  store  description.  Apps  were 
included  if  they  satisfied  five  inclusion  criteria:1  the  keywords  ‘social 
anxiety’, ‘social phobia’, ‘phobia’ or ‘shyness’ in the title or app descrip-
tion2  explicitly  specified  the  purpose  was  education/symptom  moni-
toring  assessment/management/support/therapy  or  a  combination  of 
these3 a focus on social anxiety or that social anxiety was one of the 
main aspects of app content4 used an English language interface; and5 
were  not  in  electronic  book  format.  Apps  were  excluded  if  they  did 
not provide sufficient information, had no clear focus on social anxiety, 
included the keywords in an unrelated context (eg, specific phobias or 
purely entertainment games) or were duplicates within the same store, 
but not between stores.

data extraction and coding
We extracted and coded information from the store description of the 
identified apps for several variables, based on18 21 and we also collected 
information on additional variables:
1.  Platform (iTunes, Google Play or Windows Store)
2.  Device (phone only, tablet only, phone and tablet, or universal)
3.  Developer,  affiliation  (medical  institution,  non-profit  institution  or 

insufficient information)

4.  Release date
5.  Cost (US$)
6.  Target audience (people with social anxiety, laypersons, students, 

health professionals)

7.  Target age group (4+, 9+, 18+ and all)
8.  Content focus (social anxiety only, or social anxiety plus others)
9.  Content  source  (expert,  external,  lived  experience  or  insufficient 

information)
Main purpose (multipurpose, psychoeducation, assessment, 
symptom monitoring, symptom management, supportive resourc-
es, treatment)

10. Media type (text, audio, text and audio, text and visual)

literature search on the effectiveness of social anxiety apps
Overview
We  conducted  a  literature  search  during  June  2016,  using  six  data-
bases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus and 
Web of Science. We used combinations of the search terms including 
social  phobia  or  social  anxiety  or  phobia  or  social  anxiety  disorders, 
app store, mobile app, Google Play, Android, iPhone, Windows phone, 
smartphone,  mobile  application.  This  search  was  also  supplemented 
with a manual search through the identified articles’ bibliography. Two 
of the authors (BG, HA) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts 
to identify eligible studies. If deemed potentially relevant, the full text of 
the article was retrieved.

Selection criteria
Articles were considered potentially relevant if they provided an eval-
uation  of  mobile  apps  for  social  anxiety,  included  empirical  evidence 
on  the  effectiveness  of  social  anxiety  apps,  and  were  in  English.  We 
excluded articles that evaluated apps for specific phobias and articles 
that only provided study protocols for future research.

Data extraction and coding
Eligible articles were reviewed by two authors (BG, HA) independently. 
Only  one  author  (BG)  extracted  information  via  a  preprepared  data 
extraction tool following PRISMA guidelines.23 Extracted data included 

66

year  of  publication,  funding  sources,  demographic  characteristics  of 
participants,  condition,  characteristics  of  the  app  used  (eg,  purpose, 
developer and affiliation), study design, results and biases.

FindingS
general characteristics
The initial search of the three app stores yielded a total of 1154 apps 
(see figure 1) potentially relevant to social anxiety (iTunes=212 apps, 
Google Play=913 apps and Windows Store=29 apps). After screening, 
73 apps were relevant to social anxiety but 35 apps were duplicates 
and hence excluded. Duplicates were excluded within each store but 
not  between  stores,  because  the  same  apps  in  different  stores  may 
have different content or functionality and so are considered different 
apps for the purpose of this study and this approach would be consis-
tent with previously published work.24 Overall, 38 apps met the inclu-
sion criteria from the following platforms: iTunes (n=18), Google Play 
(n=16) and Windows Store (n=4). Figure 2 shows the distribution of 
social anxiety apps across the mobile platforms.

Release  dates  were  available  for  34  apps.  iTunes  apps  reported  the 
earliest release date (2009), with the majority being released between 
2014 and 2016. Release dates for apps on Google Play ranged between 
2011  and  2016,  with  the  majority  being  released  in  the  last  2 years. 
However, apps on the Windows Store did not report this information.

Most  apps  were  free  to  download  (n=20).  iTunes  provided  8  apps 
for free, and 10 were paid ($1.09–$5.45). Similarly, Google Play had 10 
apps free of charge, and 6 were at a cost ranging from $2.18 to $4.64. 
Windows Store offered two free apps and two paid apps, which were the 
most expensive of all at $5.45 and $5.79.

Consistent  with  the  literature,21  the  majority  of  developers  did  not 
provide  information  on  their  organisational  affiliations  (35/38,  92.1%). 
Of  those  that  indicated  their  affiliations,  two  apps  were  affiliated  with 
non-profit  institutions,  and  only  one  paid  app  was  associated  with  a 
medical institution (Mayo Clinic).

Purpose of social anxiety apps
As shown in figure 3, more than a third of the apps reported their main 
purpose  as  psychoeducation  (13/38,  34.2%),  symptom  management 
(5/38,  13.16%),  treatment  (4/38,  10.52%),  self-assessment  (3/38, 
7.89%)  and  supportive  resources  (3/38,  7.89%).  Multipurpose  apps 
accounted for 26.3% (10/38) of the sample. Furthermore, over 60% of 
the apps (23/38) were exclusively focused on social anxiety, while the 
remainder of apps (15/38, 39.5%) focused on social anxiety and other 
related conditions. Over 65% of the apps did not report their content 
source, and of those that reported this information in sufficient detail, 
23.7% cited as expert and 5.3% as external sources. Most apps used 
a multimedia format, while 17 apps (44.7%) used text only to deliver 
content.

Over 94.7% (36/38) of apps were targeting the public and only two 
apps were directed at healthcare professionals. With regard to the target 
age group, only five apps (13.2%) were unrated, and the remaining were 
rated  as  suitable  for  individuals  aged  3+.  In  addition,  about  a  third  of 
the  apps  could  be  downloaded  and  installed  on  either  smartphones  or 
tablets,  23.7%  phone  only  and  the  remainder  were  universal.  Table  1 
summarises  the  characteristics  of  the  apps.  See  online  supplementary 
appendix A for a complete list of included apps.

characterisation of apps by purpose
Therapeutic treatment (four apps)
Therapeutic  treatment  apps  mainly  used  audio  (3/4,  75%)  to  deliver 
content, which accounted for the majority of audio apps found in the 
sample. The content of these apps was primarily in the form of hypnosis. 
One app provided treatment content via text only, in the form of social

challenges. All these apps were exclusively focused on social anxiety, 
and all reported insufficient information on content source.

Psychoeducation (13 apps)
Psychoeducation apps mostly used text only (8/13, 61.5%), accounting 
for  about  half  of  all  text  apps  in  the  sample,  followed  by  multimedia 
format  to  deliver  educational  content  about  social  anxiety  (5/13, 
38.5%).  One  app  provided  an  audio  HypnoSleep  tool,  which  reads 
out information to the individual. The content included information on 
definition,  symptoms,  causes  and  ways  to  overcome  social  anxiety. 
Most apps did not include sufficient information about content source 
(11/13, 84.6%), but were available for both smartphones and tablets. 
Also, while more than half of these psychoeducational apps were social 
anxiety focused (7/13, 53.8%), accounting for about a third of all apps 
included  in  this  study,  six  apps  focused  on  social  anxiety  plus  other 
conditions (6/13, 46.2%).

Self-assessment (three apps)
None of the self-assessment apps provided enough information on their 
content source. Despite this, two apps were targeted at health profes-
sionals.  Two  apps  used  text  only  media  and  one  app  used  multimedia

format. Two apps were exclusively focused on social anxiety, though did 
not indicate what type of assessment methods/tools were used, and one 
app included social anxiety among other conditions such as depression, 
panic attacks, mania and psychosis. Based on available app description, 
this app used the Social Phobia Inventory for assessment.25 All three apps 
were designed for both phones and tablets.

Symptom management (five apps)
Three  apps  (3/5,  60%)  did  not  provide  enough  information  on  their 
content source, which accounted for 12% of the entire sample. One 
app  reported  that  the  content  source  was  external  and  one  expert. 
Two apps used multimedia, two used text only and one app used audio 
only. Three apps were social anxiety specific, while two apps included 
other  conditions.  Furthermore,  symptom  management  techniques 
ranged from asking users to perform social challenges, deep muscle 
relaxation, breathing exercises and cognitive bias modification (CBM) 
techniques  which  provide  training  in  ignoring  negative  stimuli.  Only 
two  apps  allowed  users  to  rate  their  anxiety  levels  at  different  time 
points  and  track  their  progress.  All  five  apps  were  compatible  with 
smartphones and tablets.

Supportive resources (three apps)
None of the supportive resource apps identified the source of their 
contents. Two apps were text only, while one app used multimedia. 
Only  one  app  was  social  anxiety  specific.  All  apps  provided  online 
support resources (user chatrooms and social networking).

Multipurpose (10 apps)
This category included the only app that was affiliated with a medical 
institution (Mayo Clinic). The majority (90%) of these apps reported 
the  source  of  content,  with  almost  all  citing  an  expert  (80%)  or 
external  (10%)  source.  Similarly,  the  majority  also  used  multimedia 
(n=7), text only (n=2) and audio only (n=1) format. More than half 
of these apps (60%) focused solely on social anxiety, while four apps

included  other  conditions.  All  apps  provided  multiple  functions  (a 
combination of assessment, management and treatment). Eighty per 
cent  specifically  focused  on  CBT.  Most  apps  were  compatible  with 
smartphone devices and tablets, with only two apps suitable only for 
smartphones.

evaluation of the effectiveness of apps
The  literature  search  yielded  84  articles  in  total:  Medline  (12), 
Embase  (34),  PsycInfo  (15),  Cochrane  (0),  Scopus  (12),  Web  of 
Science (10) and manual search (1). After independent review of titles 
and  abstracts,  10  articles  were  retained.  Five  duplicate  articles  were 
excluded. Further analysis eliminated the remaining five articles as they 
evaluated  apps  for  specific  phobia,  or  did  not  provide  original  data, 
rather they were study protocols and guidelines for future research in 
this area, or assessed smartphone-delivered interventions but not social 
anxiety  stand-alone  apps.  However,  we  found  two  smartphone-deliv-
ered  interventions  for  social  anxiety:  (1)  a  mobile-based  CBT  (mCBT) 
and a mobile-based interpersonal psychotherapy,26 which the authors 
found to be effective, but the mCBT demonstrated more lasting posi-
tive effects, and (2) a smartphone-based CBM for attention, which was 
found to be as effective as dot-probe attention bias training.27 Of note, 
none of the apps included in this study provided any form of evaluation 
or empirical evidence in their available app descriptions.

concluSionS
This systematic review was the first to characterise the purpose and 
content  description  of  available  social  anxiety-focused  apps  across 
all main platforms, and to review the evidence base for apps that are 
currently  available.  In  total,  38  apps  were  identified  as  specifically 
targeting  social  anxiety.  Over  60%  of  the  identified  apps  were  exclu-
sively focused on social anxiety, while the remainder did not solely focus 
on social anxiety. The purpose of most apps was a combination of some 
of the following: psychoeducation; symptom management; treatment; 
self-assessment;  or  supportive  resources.  Furthermore,  most  of  the 
apps  neither  reported  their  organisational  affiliation  nor  their  content 
source. More than half of apps used multimedia and approximately half 
used  text  only  media.  Lastly,  the  systematic  review  of  the  literature 
found a lack of empirical evaluation of social anxiety mobile apps and 
none of the apps identified in the current study have had evaluation of 
their effectiveness published.

This study confirms the growing number of mobile apps that are readily 
accessible.16  18–20  28–30  Included  apps  were  available  across  the  three 
main mobile platforms, which is unsurprising given the popularity of these 
platforms. Compared with previous studies31–33 that have restricted their 
search to one platform, our search strategy enabled a wider evaluation of 
the major platforms for downloading apps. However, despite a significant 
increase in the number of health-based apps over recent years, where 
studies have found apps for a variety of clinical conditions, for example, 
295  for  cancer;21  243  for  depression;18  259  for  stress  management,34 
social anxiety focused apps are still relatively uncommon.

Targeting  social  anxiety  through  a  mobile  platform  may  help  increase 
access to quality mental healthcare and overcome treatment barriers. This 
is  especially  true  for  conditions  such  as  social  anxiety  that  hinder  people 
from  seeking  help/accessing  services  due  to  several  reasons  as  outlined 
earlier.9–11 However, apps have their limitations. For example, providing infor-
mation alone is well recognised to be inaequate when aiming for behaviour 
change.35 Therefore, apps should also aim to incorporate evidence-based 
treatment options such as CBT33 36 37 and support self-management skills 
necessary to translate that knowledge into effective practice.21 The main 
form  of  treatment  we  encountered  in  the  current  study  was  hypnosis 
whereby the evidence base is less robust and similar research has found 

that smoking cessation apps often did not adhere to evidence-based prac-
tices.29 31 38

Furthermore,  absence  of  evidence  on  effectiveness  and  insuffi-
cient  information  of  developers’  affiliations  are  concerning.  Previous 
reviews  of  health  apps  have  also  highlighted  these  concerns21  31  32 
38 39 and discrepancies between information provided in the app and 
official guidelines.22 31 Additionally, previous work has found that apps 
targeting healthcare consumers had less valid information than those 
designed  for  healthcare  professionals  (32%  vs  96%).32  The  findings 
from our study confirm this whereby of all included apps, only three 
apps reported their affiliations.

Finally,  developers  should  adhere  to  evidence-based  guidelines 
and  involve  users  in  the  development  process  as  has  been  done 
in  previous  work.40  Including  users  in  the  development  of  apps  is 
important41  and  has  proven  successful.42  A  study  of  mental  health 
service  users  in  Ireland43  found  that  all  participants  were  interested 
in  participating  in  app  design  and  may  help  with  usability  and  the 
overall  therapeutic  benefit  of  such  apps.  With  regard  to  design  and 
development  processes,  guidelines  have  also  emerged  to  aid  future 
developers including Bakker’s and colleagues recommendations,16 the 
Purple guideline44 and the Mobile App Rating Scale.45 These guidelines 
will also help developers in reporting their app features, content and 
provide relevant attribution to content providers.

Strengths and limitations
The  main  strength  of  our  approach  is  that  our  search  covered  the 
three main mobile app platforms and were independently searched by  
two  reviewers.  We  adopted  a  search  strategy  that  is  already 
published.18 21 23 However, our study also had limitations. Our search 
was restricted to app description, rather than physically downloading 
and testing apps whereby some apps may have contained this missing 
information within the app itself. As a result, we found that a consid-
erable number of apps failed to disclose their organisational affiliations 
and content source. Second, it is possible that many of the apps we 
excluded that were not specific to social anxiety could be valuable for 
people with the disorder. Social anxiety has high comorbidity with other 
mental health conditions such as depression and panic disorder.46 47 
Apps for these disorders may also be useful. Future research should 
also test the functionality or usability of the apps we included in this 
study.

clinicAl iMPlicA tionS
As  with  other  mental  health  disorders,  social  anxiety  apps  have  the 
potential to overcome barriers to accessing treatment; however, given 
the small number of apps specifically targeting social anxiety and none 
with  a  robust  evidence base,  finding  the  appropriate  app  may  prove 
to  be  challenging.  It  is  important  that  researchers  consider  all  plat-
forms when reviewing apps. This study also highlighted the need for 
standardised reporting and the need for evidence-based evaluations of 
apps. Future research should focus on evaluating the utility and effec-
tiveness of social anxiety-specific apps.
