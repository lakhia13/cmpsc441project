Abstract
Alcoholic hepatitis is the severest clinical presentation of alcoholic liver
disease. Lacking an effective pharmacologic treatment, alcoholic hepatitis
is associated with a poor prognosis and its recovery relies mostly on
abstinence. With alcohol use disorder being universally on the rise, the
impact of alcoholic hepatitis on society and health-care costs is expected to
increase significantly. Prognostic factors and liver biopsy can help with
timely diagnosis, to determine eligibility and response to corticosteroids,
and for prognostication and transplant referral. Although recent discoveries
in the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis are encouraging and could
pave the way for novel treatment modalities, a multidisciplinary approach
considering timely identification and treatment of liver-related
complications, infectious and metabolic disease, malnutrition, and addiction
counseling should be emphasized. Apart from proper selection of
candidates, transplant programs should provide adequate post-transplant
addiction support in order to make of early liver transplantation for alcoholic
hepatitis the ultimate sobering experience in the next decade.

Introduction
Alcoholic  hepatitis  (AH)  is  a  life-threatening  form  of  acute-on-
chronic  liver  failure  that  occurs  in  patients  with  sustained  heavy 
alcohol  use.  AH  is  characterized  by  a  rapid  onset  or  worsening 
of  jaundice,  liver  synthetic  dysfunction,  and  features  of  hepatic 
decompensation,  including  ascites,  encephalopathy,  and  por-
tal  hypertensive  bleeding.  An  episode  of  AH  is  frequently  the 
first  clinical  presentation  of  alcohol-related  liver  disease,  and  in 
patients with severe disease, prognosis is poor; mortality is 20 to 
50% at 28 days and up to 70% at 90 days1,2. Pharmacotherapy for 
AH  remains  limited  to  corticosteroids;  however,  almost  half  of 
patients  cannot  tolerate  or  do  not  respond  to  corticosteroid  ther-
apy.  The  only  intervention  shown  to  improve  long-term  survival 
in AH  is  alcohol  abstinence,  thus  highlighting  a  critical  role  for 
multidisciplinary  care  incorporating  mental  health  and  addiction 
teams.  More  recently,  early  liver  transplantation  (LT)  has  been 
used  in  carefully  selected  populations  showing  3-year  survival 
rates  equivalent  to  those  for  other  chronic  liver  diseases;  con-
cerns  regarding  post-transplant  alcohol  relapse,  however,  have 
limited acceptance of early transplantation as standard treatment.

Epidemiology of alcoholic hepatitis
The  epidemiology  of  AH  is  poorly  understood,  particularly  in 
the US, where liver biopsy is rarely performed for this condition. 
Trends in patterns of alcohol use, however, suggest that AH inci-
dence  rates  are  likely  to  increase  in  Western  nations.  Recent  US 
reports on the impact of state alcohol sales policies have highlighted 
increased  rates  of  alcohol  consumption3,4.  Furthermore,  drinking 
at  an  earlier  age5,6  and  binging  patterns  of  use  have  dramatically 
increased in the last decade7. These behaviors have translated into 
increased  mortality  related  to  alcoholic  liver  disease;  from  2009 
to  2016,  Americans  25  to  34  years  old  experienced  the  greatest 
increase  in  liver-related  mortality  among  all  age  groups  and  this 
increase was driven entirely by alcoholic liver disease8. Although 
a  significant  proportion  of  these  deaths  are  likely  attributable 
to AH,  no  US  studies  have  systematically  explored  the  epidemi-
ology  of  AH.  In  a  Danish  national  cohort  study,  the  incidence 
of AH rose from 24 to 34 per million women  and from  37 to 46 
per  million  men  between  1999  and  20089,  and  it  is  likely  that 
similar trends have occurred in other Western nations.

With  the  changing  epidemiology  of  alcohol  use  and  alcohol-
related  liver  disease,  the  health-care  and  economic  burden  of 
AH  has  increased  over  the  last  decade.  For  example,  an  analy-
sis  of  the  Nationwide  Inpatient  Sample  demonstrated  increased 
rates  of  hospitalization  for AH  from  2002  to  201010. While  there 
was  a  significant  decline  in  inpatient  mortality  due  to AH  (4.3% 
absolute  risk  reduction),  the  cost  of  hospitalization  increased  by 
41%10.  Another  report  showed  a  96%  increase  in  the  inpatient  
for  both  studies,  increased  costs  likely  represent  an  cost  of 
care  for  alcoholic  cirrhosis  between  2002  and  2014,  rep-
resenting  almost  50%  of 
inpatient  charges  for  
the 
cirrhosis11. As length of stay remained unchanged over the studied  
time  frame  for  both  studies,  increased  costs  likely  represent  an 
absolute increase in resource utilization.

Pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis
AH  is  driven  by  both  intra-  and  extra-hepatic  effects  of  alcohol.  
Within  hepatocytes,  alcohol  is  degraded  into  the  toxic  metabolite  

F1000Research 2020, 9(F1000 Faculty Rev):97 Last updated: 10 FEB 2020

acetaldehyde  via  non-inducible  (alcohol  dehydrogenase)  and  
inducible  (CYP2E1)  enzymes.  In  addition  to  acetaldehyde,  mul-
tiple  reactive  oxygen  intermediates  (ROIs)  are  generated  by 
CYP2E1. Acetaldehyde directly induces hepatocyte death through 
both necrosis and apoptosis, and hepatocyte injury leads to release 
of  damage-associated  molecular  patterns  (DAMPs).  DAMPs  sub-
sequently  bind  to  Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs)  in  Kupffer  cells, 
the  resident  tissue  macrophage  of  the  liver,  leading  to  activa-
tion  of  the  inflammasome,  a  multiprotein  complex  containing 
caspase  1.  Upon  inflammasome  activation,  caspase  1  generates  
the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)12–14.

Alcohol  exerts  deleterious  intestinal  effects,  which  eventually 
lead  to  hepatic  inflammation  through  multiple  mechanisms.  Par-
ticularly,  alcohol  exerts  direct  toxicity  on  intestinal  epithelial  
cells  and  decreases  the  expression  of  tight-junction  proteins, 
which  enhances  the  permeability  of  the  intestinal  mucosa,  
permitting 
translocation  of  pathogen-associated  molecular  
patterns  (PAMPs)  such  as  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  into  the 
liver15–17. As  with  DAMPs,  PAMPs  can  then  activate  macrophage 
inflammasomes  via  TLR,  leading  to  elaboration  of  multiple  
inflammatory  cytokines  (including  IL-1B,  tumor  necrosis  factor 
alpha  (TNF-α)  and  IL-10)  and  neutrophil  chemokines  (including 
IL-8, Gro-α, CXCL-5, and CXCL-6)18. The net increase in intra-
hepatic inflammation perpetuates further hepatocellular mitochon-
drial dysfunction, ROI generation, and hepatic failure.

In  addition  to  dysregulated  hepatic  inflammation,  multiple  clini-
cal observations point to hepatocellular dysfunction and impaired 
regeneration  as  critical  drivers  of  liver  failure  in  AH.  First, 
liver  explants  from  AH  patients  undergoing  LT  demonstrate 
near  complete  loss  of  hepatocyte  proliferation  compared  with 
alcoholic  cirrhosis  and  normal  liver19,20.  In  addition,  hepato-
cyte  proliferation  is  associated  with  improved  survival  in  severe 
AH20. Finally, patients with AH exhibit a significant expansion of  
liver  progenitor  cells  (LPCs)  (termed  ductular  reaction)  and  
failure  of  LPC  differentiation  into  mature  hepatocytes  corre-
lates  with  reduced  survival21.  To  further  delineate  molecular  
mechanisms  of  hepatocellular  dysfunction  in  AH,  Argemi  et  al.  
performed  untargeted  RNA  sequencing 
livers  with  dif-
ferent  alcoholic  liver  disease  phenotypes  and  identified  that  
development  of  AH  was  characterized  by  defective  activity  of 
liver-enriched  transcription  factors22.  In  particular,  transform-
ing  growth  factor  beta  1  (TGF-β1)  was  a  primary  transcriptional  
regulator  in  AH  and  induced  fetal  isoforms  of  hepatic  nuclear  
factor  4a  (HNF-4a)  P2  promoter,  resulting  in  defective  hepatic 
synthetic  and  metabolic  function.  Altered  expression  of  HNF-
4a–dependent  genes  was  driven  by  epigenetic  phenomena22. 
Together, these findings highlight a critical role for not only intra- 
hepatic  inflammation  but  also  hepatocellular    dysfunction  and 
impaired regeneration in the pathogenesis of AH.

Recently,  genetic  predisposition  has  expanded  our  understand-
ing  of  alcoholic  liver  disease,  and  some  relevant  genetic  signals 
are  shared  with  the  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis  counterpart  (for 
example, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3,  
transmembrane  6  superfamily  member  2,  and  hydroxyster-
oid  17-beta  dehydrogenase  13)23–25.  Although  the  impact  of 
in 
genetic  predisposition

CYP2E126 and, more recently, a transcriptome analysis were over 
represented  in  AH  or  had  prognostic  implications27.  In  the  lat-
ter,  a  123-gene  prognostic  signature  was  identified  from  fixed 
liver  biopsy  samples  in  patients  with  severe AH  and  it  improved 
the  prediction  of  transplant-free  survival  along  with  the  model 
for  end-stage  liver  disease  (MELD).  The  identified  genetic  sig-
nals corresponded to inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, 
intermediate metabolism, and hepatic stellate cells27.

Gut  dysbiosis  has  been  involved  in  the  pathophysiology  of  vari-
ous  chronic  liver  ailments,  including  alcoholic  liver  disease28. 
Alcohol directly contributes to intestinal microbial dysbiosis, and 
in  both  murine  and  human  studies,  alcohol  induces  shifts  in  bac-
terial  communities  favoring  pathogenic  species29,30.  Non-bacterial 
populations  are  also  affected,  as  a  recent  translational  study 
described  reduced  fungal  biodiversity  with  enhanced  anti-fungal 
immune  responses  in  severe  AH31.  Such  changes  in  microbiota 
break  the  balance  of  the  gut–liver  axis  either  directly  through 
bacterial  metabolites  or  indirectly  through  TLRs  and  other  sig-
naling  molecules  (PAMP/DAMP  pathways)  and  activation  of 
the  immune  system32.  The  beneficial  effects  that  modulation 
of  the  intestinal  flora  brings  to  patients  with  AH,  as  observed 
in  pilot  trials  using  either  rifaximin  or  fecal  microbiota  trans-
plantation,  add  evidence  to  support  the  pivotal  role  of  the 
gut–liver axis and gut eubiosis as a novel therapeutic aim33,34.

Diagnostic and prognostic assessment in alcoholic 
hepatitis
There  are  no  reliable  non-invasive  markers  for  identification  
of  AH  and  hence  the  syndrome  is  most  often  diagnosed  on  
clinical  grounds.  The  cardinal  feature  of  AH  is  recent  onset  of 
jaundice  within  60  days  of  last  alcohol  consumption  in  a  patient 
with known heavy alcohol use for more than 6 months. The diag-
nosis  relies  on  proving  heavy  alcohol  use  as  the  primary  etiol-
ogy  of  liver  injury  while  excluding  other  causes  of  liver  disease. 
Although  minimum  alcohol  use  requirements  for  AH  have  not 
been  described,  a  consumption  threshold  of  at  least  three  drinks 
(40 g) daily in women or at least four drinks (60 g) daily in men  
is most commonly used for inclusion in treatment studies in  AH. 
Laboratory  features  of  AH  include  serum  bilirubin  of  at  least  
(AST)  between  50  
3  mg/dL,  aspartate  aminotransferase 

and  400  IU/mL,  and  AST/alanine  aminotransferase  ratio  of  at 
least 1.5.

In  2016,  an  expert  panel  within  the  National  Institute  for  Alco-
hol  Abuse  and  Alcoholism  proposed  a  classification  scheme  for 
AH  as  follows:  (1)  definite  AH:  clinical  criteria  for  diagnosis 
are  met  and  confirmed  by  liver  biopsy;  (2)  probable  AH:  clini-
cally  diagnosed  AH  without  liver  biopsy  and  without  confound-
ing  factors;  and  (3)  possible  AH:  clinically  diagnosed  AH  but 
with  confounding  factors,  including  possible  ischemic  hepati-
tis,  drug-induced  liver  injury,  atypical  laboratory  tests,  or  uncer-
tainty  regarding  alcohol  consumption  or  a  combination  of  these2; 
in this subset, liver biopsy is recommended.

In  contrast,  the  European  Association  for  the  Study  of  the 
Liver  recommends  liver  biopsy  for  the  diagnosis  of  AH,  as  the 
accuracy  of  clinical  diagnosis  is  around  70  to  80%35.  Typical 
histologic  findings  include  macrovesicular  steatosis,  balloon-
ing  degeneration  of  hepatocytes,  Mallory–Denk  bodies,  meg-
amitochondria,  lobular  inflammation  with  neutrophilic  satelli-
tosis,  and  bilirubinostasis  with  ductular  reaction35–37.  Advanced 
fibrosis  is  a  common  feature  of  AH,  and  it  is  estimated  that 
80%  of  patients  with  AH  have  micronodular  cirrhosis37.  Typi-
cal  fibrosis  patterns  include  centrilobular,  pericellular,  and  sinu-
soidal  fibrosis  (“chicken  wire”  fibrosis).  A  landmark  study  from 
2014  demonstrated  that,  in  addition  to  prognostic  information, 
histology  may  also  provide  prognostic  value  in AH,  and  a  scor-
ing  system  consisting  of  fibrosis,  bilirubinostasis,  neutrophilic 
infiltration,  and  megamitochondria  demonstrated  an  area  under 
the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve  (AUROC)  of  0.77 
for  90-day  mortality37.  Severe  AH  was  defined  as  a  histologic 
score  of  6  to  9  and  was  associated  with  50%  90-day  mortality37. 
Interestingly,  severity  of  fibrosis  was  the  strongest  negative 
predictor  of  survival  whereas  neutrophilic  inflammation  was 
associated  with  improved  survival.  Despite  the  utility  of  liver 
biopsy,  the  presence  of  coagulopathy,  thrombocytopenia,  ure-
mia,  and  ascites  in  AH  generally  precludes  percutaneous  liver 
biopsy, and transjugular biopsy is not widely available.

Several  laboratory-based  scoring  systems  have  been  studied  for 
outcome  prediction  in  AH  and  these  are  highlighted  in  Table  1.

Historically,  the  Maddrey  discriminant  function  (MDF)  was 
the  most  commonly  used  model  to  identify  candidates  for  cor-
ticosteroid  therapy38.  Two  major  drawbacks  of  MDF  were 
(1) the use of prothrombin time, which is not standardized between 
clinical laboratories, and (2) the absence of renal function assess-
ment,  as  acute  kidney  injury  is  a  strong  predictor  of  mortality 
in AH39.  More  recently,  the  MELD  score  has  been  used  to  clas-
sify  AH  patients  at  high  risk  of  death  in  need  of  treatment40. 
At  a  cutoff  of  at  least  21,  MELD  score  exhibited  75%  sensitiv-
ity  and  specificity  for  predicting  90-day  mortality.  Other  models, 
including  the  age/bilirubin/international  normalized  ratio/cre-
atinine  (ABIC)  score41  and  the  Glasgow  Alcoholic  Hepatitis 
Score (GAHS)42 are less well studied in North American popula-
tions. An ABIC  score  of  less  than  6.71  has  been  associated  with 
100%  survival,  whereas  an  ABIC  score  of  more  than  9.00  pre-
dicts  25%  survival  at  90  days41.  The  GAHS  has  also  been  used 
to  identify  candidates  for  corticosteroid  therapy,  as  patients  with 
a  GAHS  of  at  least  9  and  an  MDF  of  at  least  32  exhibited  bet-
ter  survival  with  steroid  therapy  than  without,  whereas  subjects 
with a GAHS of less than 9 and an MDF of less than 32 did not 
benefit from treatment43.

Early  observational  trials  of  steroid  therapy  identified  declining 
bilirubin  as  a  marker  of  therapeutic  response  and  hence  the  Lille 
score  was  developed  to  quantify  changes  in  labs  over  7  days  of 
steroid  treatment.  A  Lille  score  of  more  than  0.45  after  7  days 
was  associated  with  over  75%  90-day  mortality44.  A  multina-
tional  study  reported  on  a  similar  accuracy  when  the  Lille  score 
was  evaluated  at  day  4,  when  compared  with  the  original  one 
after  7  days  on  corticosteroids45.  Combining  MELD  and  Lille 
scores  increases  prognostic  accuracy  compared  with  either  score 
alone46,  and  various  useful  combination  strategies  were  recently 
studied  as  part  of  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  a  large  multicenter AH 
clinical trial47.

Given  the  above  limitations  of  laboratory-based  models  for 
outcome  prediction  in  AH,  a  number  of  studies  have  explored 
novel  biomarkers  of  AH.  For  example,  analysis  of  circulating 
exosomes  has  demonstrated  increased  enrichment  of  miR-155 
(a  key  regulator  of  inflammation),  miR-192,  and  miR-30a  in 
patients  with  AH  compared  with  controls48,49.  Circulating  lev-
els  of  several  cytokines,  including  TNF-α,  IL-1,  IL-6,  and  IL-8, 
have also been studied in AH, and elevated serum  IL-6 levels, in 
particular,  have  shown  promise  as  a  marker  of  increased  mortal-
ity  in  patients  with  an  MDF  of  at  least  3250.  More  recently,  two 
studies  have  shown  that  increased  levels  of  cytokeratin  18  frag-
ments  may  be  used  for  identification  and  severity  assessment 
in  AH51,52,  and  urinary  metabolomics  studies  have  identified 
higher  levels  of  urinary  acrolein  metabolites  in  severe AH  com-
pared with both healthy controls and non-severe disease53. Finally, 
an  analysis  of  blood  neutrophil/lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR)  dem-
onstrated  that  NLR  was  associated  with  infection,  acute  kidney 
injury,  and  steroid  responsiveness54.  Validation  and  standardi-
zation  of  these  promising  tools  are  still  needed  across  multiple 
clinical settings.

clinical  trial  demonstrated  that  pentoxifylline  decreased  short-term  
mortality  by  reducing  rates  of  renal  failure56,  the  recently 
reported  STOPAH  (steroids  or  pentoxifylline  for  alcoholic  hepa-
titis)  study  has  raised  concerns  regarding  the  efficacy  of  both 
treatments57.  Over  1,100  patients  were  enrolled  from  hospitals 
throughout  Britain  and  randomly  assigned  into  a  2×2  facto-
rial  designed  clinical  trial  to  study  the  benefit  of  corticosteroids 
and  pentoxifylline.  Corticosteroids  demonstrated  a  trend  toward 
reduced  28-day  mortality  compared  with  placebo  (14%  versus 
18%,  P  =  0.06),  but  no  reduction  was  observed  for  90-day  mor-
tality.  Pentoxifylline  provided  no  improvements  in  either  short-
term  or  long-term  mortality.  Importantly,  mortality  rates  were 
significantly  lower  than  those  reported  in  other  clinical  trials  of 
severe AH. As biopsy-proven AH was not used as an inclusion cri-
terion, this raised concerns regarding whether a subset of patients 
had  acute-on-chronic  liver  failure  related  to  decompensated  cir-
rhosis  as  opposed  to  AH.  Two  recent  meta-analyses  of  rand-
omized controlled trials reported that corticosteroids provided sig-
nificant  survival  benefit  at  28  days  but  not  at  90  or  180  days58,59, 
although  the  last  updated  Cochrane  meta-analysis  continues  to 
find  no  benefit.  Given  the  short-term  benefits  of  corticosteroids, 
their judicious use is still warranted in selected populations.

There  is  increasing  interest  in  novel  treatments  for  severe  AH 
(Table  2).  Ongoing  trials  are  exploring  the  efficacy  of  antibi-
otic  therapy,  farsenoid  X  receptor  (FXR)  agonists  (obeticholic 
acid),  caspase  inhibitors  (emricasan),  receptor  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors  (selonsertib),  IL-1R  antagonists  (anakinra),  and  IL-22 
agonists.  Of  particular  interest  is  the  use  granulocyte-colony 
stimulating  factor  (G-CSF). The  rationale  for  G-CSF  is  based  on 
(1)  histologic  studies  demonstrating  that  increased  hepatic  neu-
trophil  infiltration  is  associated  with  improved  survival  in  AH37 
and  (2)  pre-clinical  observations  that  G-CSF  mobilizes  granu-
locytes  to  improve  survival  in  acute-on-chronic  liver  failure60. 
A few randomized pilot studies from India have shown increased 
survival and more rapid decline in MELD scores in both decom-
pensated  cirrhosis  and  AH61–65.  Though  promising, 
these 
results will require replication in other clinical centers.

Supportive measures
Alcohol abstinence
Although  corticosteroids  marginally  improve  short-term  mor-
tality,  only  alcohol  abstinence  has  been  shown  to  increase 
6-month  survival66,67.  Most  patients  with  AH  meet  criteria  for 
an  alcohol  use  disorder  (AUD),  characterized  by  ongoing  alco-
hol  consumption  despite  experiencing  adverse  consequences  of 
drinking68. Therefore, use of screening tools to diagnose AUDs in 
patients with AH is  critical  to guide referral to  optimal  treatment 
pathways.  One  recent  meta-analysis  of  the  AUD  Identification 
Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C)69 (https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/
default/files/files/AUDIT.pdf)  demonstrated  feasibility  and  effi-
cacy  of  this  instrument  for  identification  of  AUDs;  furthermore, 
counseling  interventions  in  those  patients  testing  positive  led  to 
reductions in harmful alcohol consumption70.

Management of acute alcoholic hepatitis
The pharmacotherapy for AH has changed little since the introduc-
tion of corticosteroids in the early 1970s55, and although an early 

In  addition  to  addiction  counseling,  pharmacotherapy  for  AUD 
is  now  available  (Table  3).  Although  disulfram  and  naltrexone 
have  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approval  for  treatment 
of  AUD,  both  drugs  exhibit  significant  hepatotoxicity  limiting

their  use  in  advanced  liver  disease.  Baclofen  has  been  studied 
extensively  for  AUD  treatment  in  patients.  Given  the  limited 
hepatic  metabolism  of  baclofen,  there  is  a  theoretically  lower 
risk  of  hepatotoxocity.  Results  of  baclofen  treatment  trials,  how-
ever,  are  mixed71. Whereas  one  meta-analysis  of  14  studies  dem-
onstrated  no  superiority  of  baclofen  over  placebo72,  two  other 
meta-analyses  demonstrated  increased  rates  of  abstinence  and 
increased time to first relapse with baclofen73,74. Other drugs with 
low  reported  risk  of  hepatic  injury  include  acamprosate,  gabap-
entin,  topiramate,  and  varenicline.  However,  of  these  agents, 
only  acamprosate  is  approved  for  treatment  of  AUD.  A  recent 
meta-analysis  demonstrated  reduced  rates  of  alcohol  relapse  for 
acamprosate (number needed-to-treat of 12; 27 trials)75. Although 
further trials are needed to assess efficacy specifically in alcoholic 
liver  disease,  acamprosate  represents  an  alternative  therapeutic 
option in survivors of an episode of severe AH.

Identification and treatment of infections
Infections  are  a  common  complication  of  AH  and  contribute 
to  increased  mortality  in  AH76.  In  the  STOPAH  trial,  infections 
were  responsible  for  24%  of  all  deaths57.  Patients  with  severe 
AH  are  at  particularly  increased  risk  for  infection  for  a  number 
of  reasons.  First,  immune  function  of  circulating  innate  immune 
cells  is  impaired,  as  multiple  studies  have  identified  decreased 
phagocytic  activity,  oxidative  burst,  and  proliferation  in  severe 
AH77,78. Second, immunosuppression with corticosteroids impacts 
infection  risk,  as  shown  in  a  subanalysis  of  the  STOPAH  trial 
where  circulating  bacterial  DNA  detected  at  enrollment  was 
associated  with  development  of  early  infections  (within  7  days 
of  commencing  treatment)  only  among  patients  who  received  
prednisolone79.  The  source  and  type  of  infection  also  change 
during  the  disease  course.  In  an  early  study  of AH,  spontaneous  
bacterial  peritonitis  and  spontaneous  bacteremia  were  leading 
infections at initial presentation whereas respiratory infections were 
the  most  common  infections  after  exposure  to  corticosteroids80.  
Although Gram-negative bacteria are the leading organisms iden-
tified  in  AH,  recent  studies  have  reported  invasive  fungal  infec-
tions.  For  example,  in  a  series  of  120  consecutive  AH  patients 
admitted  to  an  intensive  care  unit,  10%  developed  invasive  fun-
gal  infections,  including  candidemia  and  invasive  aspergillosis 
infections; all were exposed to corticosteroids81.

Finally,  early  diagnosis  of  infection  in  AH  is  particularly  chal-
lenging  in  patients  with  systemic  inflammatory  response  syn-
drome  (SIRS),  which  is  diagnosed  when  two  or  more  of  the  fol-
lowing  criteria  are  met:  (a)  white  blood  cell  count  of  more  than 
12,000/mL  or  less  than  4,000/mL  or  more  than  10%  bands, 
(b)  temperature  of  more  than  38°C  or  less  than  36°C,  (c)  heart 
rate  of  more  than  90  beats/minute,  (d)  respiratory  rate  of  more 
than 20/minute. In one study, SIRS was present in 20% of patients 
at  admission  and  was  associated  with  multiple  organ  failure 
and  short-term  death82  independent  of  the  presence  of  infec-
tion.  Owing  to  the  high  rate  of  negative  bacterial  cultures  in AH 
patients  with  SIRS,  there  is  growing  interest  in  the  development 
of  novel  infection  biomarkers  in AH.  Small  studies  have  demon-
strated efficacy of bacterial DNA and LPS79,82 to screen for infec-
tions,  but  further  research  is  needed  to  validate  these  findings. 
As  up  to  26%  of  patients  with  AH  initially  present  with  

F1000Research 2020, 9(F1000 Faculty Rev):97 Last updated: 10 FEB 2020

infection80,  baseline  screening  for  infection  (blood  cultures, 
urine  cultures,  chest  radiography,  and  ascitic  fluid  analysis)  is 
routinely  performed;  furthermore,  a  clinical  trial  studying  the 
use  of  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  with  prednisolone  in  patients 
with  severe  AH  was  nearing  completion  by  December  2019 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02281929).

Evaluation of nutritional status and nutritional support
Malnutrition—in  particular,  protein-calorie  malnutrition—is  a 
well-recognized  complication  of  AH83,84.  With  the  rising  epi-
demic of obesity in Western nations, a subjective physical assess-
ment  by  treating  clinicians  may  incorrectly  classify  nutritional 
status  in  severe  AH.  Although  a  recent  randomized  clinical 
trial  failed  to  demonstrate  intense  enteral  nutrition  via  nasogas-
tric  tube  superior  to  oral  nutrition  in  patients  with  AH  treated 
with  corticosteroids,  a  subgroup  analysis  showed  that  patients 
receiving  less  than  21.5  kcal/kg  per  day  had  lower  6-month  sur-
vival  than  patients  meeting  this  threshold,  and  reduced  survival 
was  associated  with  decreased  protein  and  lipid  content  in  the 
diet85.  In  addition,  multiple  macro-  and  micro-nutrient  deficien-
cies  have  been  described  in AH.  In  particular,  zinc  deficiency  is 
associated  with  increased  intestinal  permeability86,  and  a  clini-
cal  trial  incorporating  zinc  supplementation  (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT01809132) was completed in December 2018.

Recently,  there  has  been  renewed  interest  in  the  use  of  objec-
tive  measures  of  nutritional  status  and  physical  function  for  out-
come  prediction  in  cirrhosis.  In  patients  with  decompensated 
cirrhosis,  6-minute  walk  test,  cross-sectional  abdominal  muscle 
area,  and  gait  speed  are  strongly  associated  with  mortality,  LT 
waitlist  dropout,  and  increased  hospital-related  expenditures87–89. 
Furthermore,  a  liver  frailty  index  composed  of  dominant  grip 
strength,  chair  stands,  and  balance  was  recently  shown  to  pre-
dict  survival 
these 
tools  have  yet  to  be  incorporated  into  prognostic  models  in AH, 
they  may  hold  potential,  in  particular,  for  predicting  long-term 
outcomes in short-term survivors of an episode of AH.

in  decompensated  cirrhosis90.  Although 

Early liver transplantation for alcoholic hepatitis
Patients  with  AH  who  fail  corticosteroids  have  poor  long-term  
to  75%  6-month  
survival,  and  some  studies  reported  up 
mortality44.  Therefore,  LT  has  emerged  as  a  potential  curative 
therapy  for  AH.  Historically,  transplantation  for  alcoholic  liver 
disease  has  required  demonstration  of  abstinence  for  at  least  
6  months.  The  genesis  of  the  “6-month  rule”,  however,  was  to 
permit  recovery  from  an  episode  of  acute-on-chronic  liver  fail-
ure  after  prolonged  abstinence,  but  by  the  late  1990s,  most  US 
LT  programs  and  insurance  carriers  required  a  6-month  absti-
nence  period  prior  to  approving  LT  listing.  Multiple  studies  have 
examined  the  utility  of  the  pre-transplant  sobriety  for  predicting 
post-transplant  relapse,  but  results  have  been  conflicting.  In  one 
landmark  analysis  of  LTs  performed  for  alcoholic  liver  disease, 
steatohepatitis  on  explant  pathology  was  used  as  a  surrogate 
marker  of  recent  alcohol  consumption;  interestingly,  there  were 
no differences in patient survival, graft survival, or alcohol relapse 
rates  between  subjects  with  and  without  steatohepatitis91. Also,  a  
systematic  review  of  22  studies  reported  that  duration  of  pre- 
transplant  abstinence  was  a  poor  predictor  of  post-transplant  

Page 7 of 11

reports  have 

relapse92,  although  some 
identified  duration 
of  pre-transplant  sobriety  as  a  predictor  of  post-transplant  
drinking93–95. Interestingly, the United Network for Organ Sharing 
has  never  formally  recommended  a  6-month  rule  for  transplant 
candidacy.

In a prospective, multi-center European trial, early LT for steroid  
non-responders  afforded  a  marked  survival  benefit  when  com-
pared  with  historical  matched  controls  (6-month  survival  of 
77%  versus  23%,  respectively;  P  <0.001)96.  Importantly,  these 
transplants  accounted  for  only  2.9%  of  all  transplants  performed 
at  participating  centers  over  the  same  period,  thus  allaying  
concerns  regarding  reduced  donor  availability  for  other  liver  
diseases. Since this report, a number of single-center studies have 
reported  similar  survival  benefit97,98.  In  particular,  a  recent  US 
series  of  147  LT  recipients  across  12  centers  demonstrated  a 
3-year  survival  of  84%,  and  survival  was  100%  in  patients  who 
maintained sobriety after LT99. Outcome modeling using data from 
the two seminal trials showed that early transplantation improves 
survival  when  compared  with  the  6-month  probation—regardless 
of  estimated  post-transplant  alcohol  recidivism—and  the  highest 
survival advantage was among patients with a Lille score of 0.5 to 
0.82 and a MELD score of at least 32100.

Reported  psychosocial  selection  criteria  across 
transplant  
centers  are  variable  but  appear  to  adhere  to  the  following  
principles:  (1)  adequate  psychosocial  support,  (2)  a  first  episode  

of  hepatic  decompensation  related  to  alcohol  use,  (3)  absence  of 
other  substance  use  disorders,  (4)  absence  of  untreated  psychiat-
ric  disease,  and  (5)  acknowledgment  of  an AUD  and  willingness 
to  participate  in  alcohol  rehabilitation  to  maintain  abstinence 
after  LT.  More  recently,  a  model  for  alcohol  relapse  after  LT 
identified  prior  alcohol-related  legal  issues  and  multiple  failed 
alcohol  rehabilitation  attempts  as  additional  risk  factors99,101.  
Future  studies  are  needed  to  optimize  uniform  selection  criteria  
to  (1)  maximize  long-term  abstinence  in  LT  recipients  with  
severe  AH  and  (2)  ensure  equity  and  fairness  in  the  care  of  
patients with severe AH.

Conclusions
AH  is  a  life-threatening  form  of  acute-on-chronic  liver  failure  
in  patients  with  chronic  heavy  alcohol  use.  Given  temporal 
trends  in  alcohol  consumption  patterns  worldwide,  the  incidence 
of AH,  especially  in  young  adults,  is  expected  to  rise  in  the  next 
decade.  Despite  high  rates  of  short-term  mortality  in  severe AH, 
the  treatment  of  AH  and  accompanying  AUD  has  remained 
largely  unchanged  since  the  1970s.  A  marked  increase  in  the 
number  of  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  trials  in  the  last  decade, 
however,  reflects  a  growing  interest  in  this  devastating  disease. 
LT is a life-saving therapeutic option for AH and is to be encour-
aged  particularly  in  patients  with  a  favorable  profile  and  low 
risk  for  alcohol  recidivism.  Future  studies  should  aim  to 
improve  post-transplant  addiction  support  in  order  to  maximize 
transplant benefits.
