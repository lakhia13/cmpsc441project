Health  literacy  skills  are  cognitive  and  social  skills  which 
determine  the  motivation  and  ability  of  individuals  to  gain 
access to, understand, and use information in ways which pro-
mote  and  maintain  good  health’.  Patients  use  these  literacy 
skills  to  critically  analyze  information;  to  allow  them  to  exert 
greater control over life events and situations. An understand-
ing  of  health  literacy  is  also  important  for  those  developing 
and delivering healthcare programmes, especially vaccination 
programmes, as both the information and the actions required 
to  use  the  information  are  complex  requiring  sophisticated 
health literacy skills beyond the capacity of a significant pro-
portion of the population. There are simple steps which can be 
taken to make the information in vaccination materials easier 
to understand and use. The complex concepts of reading and 
numeracy skills in relation to health will be discussed and strat-
egies described which can improve access to healthcare infor-
mation for all patients, whatever their literacy level.

Introduction

Health  literacy  skills  are  ‘the  cognitive  and  social  skills 
which  determine  the  motivation  and  ability  of  individuals  to 
gain access to, understand, and use information in ways which 
promote and maintain good health’1. Health literacy skills can 
be conceptualized at various levels of complexity; however the 
most  fundamental  skills  can  be  defined  as  ‘those  basic  skills 
in  reading  needed  to  be  able  to  function  in  everyday  (health) 
situations to access and use information’ i.e., functional health 
literacy.1  To  become  and  remain  healthy  citizens  need  a  wide 
range of literacy and numeracy skills to promote health, protect 
personal and public safety, prevent disease, manage illness and 
navigate the health service.2

Low  health  literacy  is  a  public  health  problem;  it  reduces 
health  and/or  increases  the  levels  and  impact  of  illness  while 
simultaneously affecting a significant proportion of the popula-
tion. Lower functional health literacy skills are associated with 
lower  levels  of  self-reported  health3  and  higher  prevalence  of

long-term  health  conditions,3  higher  mortality  in  older  peo-
ple,4-6  greater  use  of  medical  services  such  as  increased  hos-
pitalization  and  greater  emergency  care  use,7  poorer  ability 
to  interpret  labels  and  health  messages  and  demonstrate  tak-
ing medications appropriately,6,8 and poorer ability to manage 
long-term illnesses such as heart failure and asthma.9,10 Health 
literacy also impacts on a persons’ ability to engage in preventa-
tive activities; there is evidence of lower involvement in cancer 
screening (colorectal,11,12 cervical13 and breast screening12,14 and 
reduced uptake of influenza vaccination.12,14 Low health literacy 
is known to be a problem for a large proportion of the popula-
tion.  Reported  levels  of  low  health  literacy  vary  according  to 
the measures used, but in industrialized nations reported preva-
lence of low or ‘problematic’ health literacy is around 50%.3,15-
17 The situation is similar in England; when a range of health 
materials in common circulation were rated for the level of lit-
eracy and numeracy skills required to fully understand and use 
them,  the  literacy  (text)  component  difficulty  of  the  majority 
of  materials  was  at  the  skills  level  expected  to  be  achieved  by 
English school students at age 14–16 y (National Qualifications 
Framework level 2: see Table 1), while the numeracy component 
was at the skills level expected to be achieved by English school 
students  at  age  11–14  y  (National  Qualifications  Framework 
level 1, Table 1). Analysis of the most recent English national 
skills survey, undertaken on the English working age (16 – 65 
y) population,18 shows that 43% of working age adults do not 
have the literacy skills to fully understand and use the written 
(text) element of health materials in common circulation, this 
figure rises to 61% when text is combined with numerical con-
cepts or calculations.19 There is significant regional variation in 
the  proportion  of  the  population  below  these  ‘health  literacy 
thresholds’,  with  those  in  London  and  the  North-East  being 
at  higher  risk  of  low  health  literacy.  Health  literacy  is  associ-
ated  with  other  social  determinants  of  health;  in  particular 
older people and those from Black and Minority Ethnic Groups 
(with a first language other than English), in low grade employ-
ment (with low income) and living in more socio-economically 
deprived areas are at higher risk of being below the ‘health lit-
eracy  threshold’19.  These  groups  are  already  at  higher  risk  of 
poor health20 therefore understanding the issues raised by low 
health literacy can help to reduce health inequalities.

Why health literacy is important in vaccination 
programmes

The complexity of vaccine information
Information  about  vaccination  is  inherently  complex  and 
consequently  challenging  to  communicate  to  patients,  partic-
ularly  those  with  low  literacy  and  numeracy.  Patients  need  to 
have information about the disease or illness, the risks of con-
tracting the condition, the risks of having the vaccination, and 
the potential risk of vaccination failure resulting in the patient 
contracting  the  condition  anyway.  There  are  three  important 
elements  to  consider  as  vaccination  information  is  developed 
and communicated; what are the overall literacy and numeracy 
skills of the patient, do they have marked variation in literacy 
and numeracy sub-skills (known as ‘spiky  profiles’) and what 
cognitive  skills  are  required  for  the  patient  to  respond  to  the 
information?

Targeting resources toward patients with low health literacy 

and numeracy

When thinking about approaches to tailoring health infor-
mation to patient health literacy and numeracy skills there are 
several approaches. The strongest predictor of functional health 
literacy  and  numeracy  skills  is  the  patient  education  level  (in 
England this has a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 78%.21 

One  option  is  thus  to  routinely  collect  data  on  qualification 
level at patient registration and tailor information to health lit-
eracy levels. Such questions are routinely asked for and so this 
approach is likely to be acceptable to patients. A second option 
is to ‘test’ patient health literacy levels, either before or during 
consultation.  The  Newest  Vital  Sign22  and  the  REALM23  are 
quick  measures  which  can  be  applied  in  clinical  settings  and 
have  been  validated  for  use  in  the  UK.24,25  However,  such  an 
approach has the potential to distress patients particularly those 
with  low  literacy  and  numeracy  due  to  the  stigma  attached.26 
Such approaches place the onus for successful communication 
of information on the patient rather than on the doctor or nurse. 
A  better  more  inclusive  approach  is  that  of  universal  precau-
tions, where information and services are developed to be acces-
sible and understandable by people with low health literacy and 
numeracy.27 Table 2 shows the proportion of the English work-
ing age population at or above different literacy and numeracy 
levels; from this table it can be seen that producing information 
presented  more  simply  greatly  increases  the  proportion  of  the 
population able to understand and use it. Obviously a propor-
tion  of  the  population  have  more  sophisticated  language  and 
numeracy  skills,  therefore  simple  and  accessible  materials  can 
be  supported by  more  complex  information  available  to  those 
who request it.

‘Spiky profiles’ and learning preferences
Literacy and numeracy skills are made up of ‘sub-skills’ using 
different cognitive processes. For literacy the sub-skills are read-
ing  comprehension,  vocabulary,  word  recognition,  comprehen-
sion  and  writing.  For  numeracy  the  sub-skills  are  numbers, 
shapes and space and data handling. Everyone has skills that are 
better in some areas than others and corresponding learning pref-
erences (’spiky profiles’18, for people at lower skill levels these are 
more  marked.  People  with  higher  skills  levels  will  generally  be 
able to adapt to understand and use information presented in a 
non-preferred format, whereas people with lower skills will find 
this difficult or impossible to do.

Cognitive processing of information
Skills  levels  also  impact  on  the  extent  of  cognitive  process-
ing  applied  to  information,  as  shown  in  Bloom’s  Taxonomy  of 
Learning28  (Fig.  1).  At  the  lowest  skill  level  people  may  know, 
but  not  understand  information.  More  sophisticated  skills  are 
required  to  apply  knowledge  in  various  settings  and  to  be  able 
to analyze the information ‘de novo’ rather than having to rely 
on pre-analyzed data. Being able to deconstruct and reconstruct 
information and to evaluate the relevance of information to one-
self, one’s life and work environments requires the highest level 
cognitive skills. This is of importance in vaccination information, 
which requires cognitive processing at all these levels as patients 
must not just understand but evaluate and act upon vaccination 
information.

Making vaccine information easier to understand

For  vaccine  information  to  be  accessible  and  useful  for  as 
many  people  as  possible  those  producing  vaccine  information 
should take account of the literacy and numeracy level required 
to  understand  and  use  the  materials.  This  should  include  the 
design and layout of the material, whether materials can be pro-
duced in varying formats to suit learning preferences and whether 
additional support is required in understanding and applying the 
information  thus  enabling  patients  to  make  decisions  that  are 
right for them.

Simple steps can be taken to reduce the literacy and numeracy 
difficulty  of  vaccine  information.  For  text  (literacy)  informa-
tion, the SMOG (simplified measure of gobbledygook) is a use-
ful tool. Developed in the US.29 It has now been applied to UK 
English.30  The  two  major  factors  impacting  on  the  readability 
are the number of syllables in each word, specifically the number 
of words with three or more syllables, and the sentence length. 
Short sentences and short words greatly increase the accessibility 

Figure 1. Bloom’s taxonomy of learning28

of  information  to  people  with  lower  skills  levels.  The  SMOG 
test  is  available  online  (http://www.niace.org.uk/misc/SMOG-
calculator/smogcalc.php#top)  meaning  that  documents  can  be 
written, rewritten and simplified easily. The SMOG is however 
only a tool; it does not analyze the quality of the content - com-
pletely  incorrect  information  can  be  written  at  a  highly  acces-
sible level – but it is helpful when used well. In addition factors 
such as document layout, font size and word spacing can have a 
large impact on readability.30 Communicating complex medical 
information in mono- and bi-syllabic words can be very challeng-
ing;  how  can  one  explain  about  illnesses  such  as  meningococ-
cal  septicaemia  without  using  these  very  complex  words?  Such 
‘medical metalanguage’ is best managed by using the term once 
or  twice  early  in  a  text,  next  to  a  simplified  explanation,  then 
referring back to the term with simpler language. In longer texts 
this  can  be  repeated  to  refresh  recognition  of  essential  medical 
terms. (Table 3.)

Unfortunately, no tools like the SMOG exist to assess and sim-
plify the numeracy content of materials. There are, however, simple 
steps that can be taken to make the numeracy content of materi-
als easier to understand. This is particularly important for vaccine 
information because of the need to convey complex numerical con-
structs such as risk. These difficulties are augmented by the fact 
that for 60% of people numeracy skills levels are lower than liter-
acy skills.18 Generally an individual’s numeracy skills decline faster 
than literacy skills as many people do not routinely use numeracy 
skills in everyday life. Finally, large numbers (over 1,000) are dif-
ficult for people to conceptualize. Steps to increasing the accessibil-
ity of the numeracy components of materials are shown in Table 4. 
Key points are to avoid numbers wherever possible, to reduce the 
number  of  calculations  required  to  zero  or  1  by  using  absolute 
values  (i.e.,  avoiding  decimals  and  fractions)  and  giving  real-life 
examples rather than abstract concepts. As with the text compo-
nent of materials, using larger clearer fonts, spacing and increasing 
the amount of white space may help to keep numerical information 
clear.  Following  these  suggestions  will  mean  that  understanding 
will  be  improved  for  many  people,  enabling  them  to  undertake 
more sophisticated cognitive processing such as applying the infor-
mation to their situation and evaluating different sources and types 
of information. Having information available in different formats 
(such  as  graphs,  pictographs,  video  and  audio  formats)  may  be 
helpful for people with lower numeracy skills, who can then choose 
the format they find most helpful.

Finally,  written  information  should  always  be  supported  by 
the practitioner checking the patients’ understanding. The ‘teach 
back’ technique is a good example31; the practitioner uses a phrase 
such as ‘let me see if I’ve explained this clearly enough. Can you 
tell me the benefits to you if you have this injection?’ The empha-
sis should always be that teach back tests the practitioner com-
munication skills, not the patient health literacy skills.

Building public health literacy skills
Teaching  basic  skills  to  adults  is  a  highly  specialized  field 
outside  both  the  skill-sets  and  time  constraints  of  health  pro-
fessionals.  However  health  professionals  aware  of  the  issues  of 
health literacy may, through their clinical work, be able to iden-
tify  patients  with  low  literacy  and  numeracy  skills  who  would 
benefit  from  opportunities  to  build  their  health  literacy  skills. 
Good  health  is  important  to  everyone  and  thus  is  an  excellent 
‘hook’ to get people engaged in learning literacy and numeracy. 
Furthermore, the skills learned are likely to be highly transferable 
to other areas of life such as management of personal finances. 
Learning  outcomes  from  such  programmes  include  increased 
health knowledge, improved health behaviors, and engagement 
in  further  learning,  including  studying  for  qualifications.32  In 
vaccination clinics, sensitivity to the issues involved, and engage-
ment  with  local  education  services,  means  that  patients  who 
might  benefit  from  developing  health,  and  wider,  literacy  and 
numeracy skills can be supportively referred to appropriate edu-
cation courses.

Potential impact on participation in vaccination programmes
The known association between low health literacy and low 
rates of involvement in vaccination programmes implies that sim-
plifying vaccine information and building patient health literacy 
skills should lead to higher vaccination rates, but such interven-
tions may have unexpected outcomes. There has been little high 

quality research published in this area,6 however a well-designed 
Australian randomized controlled trial looked at the effect of a 
carefully designed decision aid focusing on the benefits and risks 
of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening, when this was sent out 
with the CRC screening kit it increased knowledge and informed 
choice but decreased participation in screening.33 Decisions about 
participation in preventative health actions are complex and will 
reflect not only the extent to which individuals can understand 
the information, but also issues of self-efficacy, locus of control, 
previous experiences (personally or of family and friends) and cul-
tural influences. Interventions designed to improve participation 
may need to look different to interventions designed to improve 
knowledge and inform choice. A potential solution to this could 
be the theoretical construct ‘critical health literacy’, defined by 
Nutbeam as ’more advanced cognitive skills that, together with 
social skills, can be applied to critically analyze information, and 
to  use  this  information  to  exert  greater  control  over  life  events 
and situations’34. Nutbeam goes on to postulate that developing 
higher-level health literacy skills will have social benefits and the 
development of social capital. It could be that by clearly outlin-
ing the benefits and risks to the individual, their friends, families 
and communities (i.e., the risk of infectious disease outbreaks if 
immunization rates (herd immunity) drop below critical levels) 
about the benefits of immunization, may lead to more informed 
decisions, resulting in higher participation rates.

Conclusion

Health literacy is a complex concept, ranging from basic skills 
in  reading  and  numeracy  through  to  advanced  cognitive  skills 
needed to critically analyze information, and to use this to exert

important for those developing and delivering vaccination pro-
grammes,  as  both  the  information  and  the  actions  required  to 
use the information are complex requiring  sophisticated health 
literacy  skills  beyond  the  capacity  of  a  significant  proportion 
of the population. However, simple steps can be taken to make 
the  information  in  vaccination  materials  easier  to  understand 
and use. Materials should be produced at as simple literacy and 
numeracy level as possible, with more detailed and sophisticated 
material available for those wanting more detailed information. 
Those  with  lower  skills  should  be  offered  alternative  informa-
tion  formats  or  longer  1:1  consultation  time.  Techniques  such 
as ‘teach-back’ can be used to check that information has been 
successfully communicated and understood.

In the course of their work, those administering vaccines will 
identify patients with low health literacy skills. Such health pro-
fessionals are in an ideal position to inform patients about local 
opportunities to develop literacy and numeracy skills for health 
and multiple other areas in life. Developing partnerships between 
health professionals and adult learning tutors can lead to fruitful 
partnerships for both.

Finally, while developing and using health information which 
is easier to use and understand must be best for patients, and will 
improve informed consent, it may have unintended consequences 
on  participation  rates.  Widening  information  and  discussions 
beyond individual benefits and risks, to include consequences to 
families, communities and the wider society may help to redress 
this.
