Abstract
Background

Infertility is a public health issue with a significant impact on the well-being of affected couples.

Aim

This paper aims to detect the determinants of pregnancy and their outcome after assisted reproductive
therapy (ART) in a sample of Palestinian society.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was carried out at Razan Medical Center for Infertility. Subjects were
assigned into twelve categories based on the type of infertility (primary versus secondary), the cause of
infertility, and the treatment modality. Age at marriage, age at presentation, duration of infertility, in
addition to regularity of menstruation, were also studied. Biochemical pregnancy was considered the
endpoint for the purpose of the analysis.

Results

We reviewed the files of 459 subjects diagnosed with infertility. 79.74% had primary infertility while 20.26%
had secondary. 28.85% were found to be infertile due to anovulation, 2.86% due to endometriosis, 16.74%
attributed to male factor, and 3.3% had tubal damage. 13.43% of cases were multifactorial while 34.80%
were idiopathic. Four biochemical markers were assessed in our study: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
(x̄=2.32±2.46), luteinizing hormone (x̄=6.71±4.90), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (x̄=6.59±6.11), and
human prolactin (x̄=41.88±6.50). The menstrual cycle was regular in 70.58% of subjects, in contrast to
29.41% with irregular cycles. The female mean age at presentation was 22.76±5.58, while their mean age of
marriage was 22.76±4. The mean duration of infertility was 3.97±6.87 years. Patients were treated via three
modalities - ovarian stimulation (2.2%), intrauterine insemination (29.58%), and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (68.21%) - with a success rate of 51.85%. Of the studied factors, only diagnosis, follicle-stimulating
hormone, and treatment modality had a significant impact on the outcome, with p-values of 0.040, 0.003,
and <.0.001, respectively.

Conclusions

There is a strong relationship between diagnosis prior to intervention, level of FSH, and treatment modality
and successful outcome of ART.

Introduction
Infertility is defined as failure to achieve clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular, unprotected
sexual intercourse according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. For many couples, the lack of
ability to have children profoundly impacts their social, physical, and sexual well-being [2]. Infertility is a
public health issue for couples of reproductive age, affecting about 72.4 million women aged 20-44 with an
estimated prevalence of 9% [3]. Infertility can be classified into primary and secondary; while primary
infertility refers to couples who have never achieved pregnancy, secondary infertility refers to those who
have conceived at least once before, but now are unable to [4].

As a result of the huge impact of infertility on individual and social well-being, many epidemiological
studies reviewed and analyzed the factors that have been attributed to infertility to provide guidance for the

prevention of infertility. Conventionally, these parameters include the age of marriage, body mass index
(BMI), duration of infertility, obstetric history, psychological stress, menstrual regularity, environmental
factors, and occupational exposures [5].

All steps must occur correctly during ovulation, fertilization, and implantation to achieve pregnancy.
Several factors can cause a disturbance at any step, whether due to female or male reasons. Female reasons
leading to infertility included: hormonal disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, premature ovarian failure,
endometriosis, fallopian tube obstruction, congenital uterine anomalies [6], and complications of medical
diseases (diabetes and hypothyroidism) [7,8]. Male infertility is usually due to sperm abnormalities or
hormonal imbalance [2,9].

Palestinian women's fertility rate is considered one of the highest in the world, with an average of 4.38
births per woman [10]. Unfortunately, no studies were conducted to detect the determinants of pregnancy
outcomes in Palestinian women. This study aims to detect the characteristics and pregnancy outcomes after
assisted reproductive therapy (ART) at Razan Medical Center for Infertility.

Materials And Methods
Study design and settings

This is a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from the electronic records of the patients who
presented to the Razan Center for the management and evaluation of infertility between 2015-2018. The
study included patients from Razan branches in three major cities in the West Bank of the Palestinian
Territories - Nablus, Ramallah, and Bethlehem - which serve the whole Palestinian population in the West
Bank.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All cases that met the WHO definition of infertility, defined as the inability to conceive despite regular,
unprotected sexual intercourse for 12 consecutive months, were included. Those who have never conceived
before were defined as primary infertile, while those who had at least conceived once prior to the start of the
study were categorized as secondary. Cases that presented for follow-up of normal pregnancy, gender
selection, frozen embryo transfer as well as records with missing data were excluded. In addition, cases that
did not meet the WHO definition of infertility in terms of duration and inability to have regular sexual
intercourse were also excluded too.

Sample and data collection

A total of 459 files were reviewed according to the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four
categorical variables were studied. The first variable was the type of infertility - whether primary or
secondary. The second variable was the underlying cause of infertility - male factors, anovulation,
endometriosis, or anatomical tubal damage. Patients who had more than one cause were labeled
multifactorial, while those in whom no specific diagnosis was reached after extensive workup were labeled
idiopathic.

Patients who were found to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), ovarian insufficiency (whether
premature or age-related), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were all grouped under the category of
anovulation. Endometriosis was assigned a separate category due to the ambiguity of the exact mechanism
by which endometriosis causes infertility.

The third categorical variable studied was the regularity of the menstrual cycle - the response was either
'regular' or 'irregular' based on the patient's answer and subjective assessment. The fourth categorical
variable was the treatment modality. The studied modalities were - ovarian stimulation (via clomiphene
citrate, follitropin alfa, or dydrogesterone), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI).

Continuous variables studied were - the biochemical markers of infertility, including follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human prolactin
(hPRL). The sociodemographic factors studied were - age at presentation, age at marriage, and the duration
of infertility.

Data analysis

The primary endpoint of the study was biochemical pregnancy, defined as a positive serum β-human
chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test. The predictors investigated for association with a positive biochemical
pregnancy were diagnosis, level of TSH, day two LH, day two FSH, hPRL, age at marriage, age at
presentation, duration of infertility, regularity of the menstrual cycle, and modality of treatment. The
endpoint and predictors were described as means and standard deviations (SD) for quantitative variables
and as absolute values and percentages for categorical variables. Differences in predictor variables according

to the presence or absence of biochemical pregnancy were described using Chi-squared test and t-test, as
appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value <0.05. All data were analyzed using
the STATA Data Analysis and Statistical Software, version 14 (StataCorp, College Station USA).

Results
The total number of infertile females who met the inclusion criteria was 459. The mean age of the sample
was 26.81 (SD ± 5.84 years, range 17 to 45 years). The duration of infertility was less than 5 years in 390
females (80.2%), and was 5 years or more in 96 females (19.75%). Three hundred and sixty-six (79.7%)
females had primary infertility while the rest (20.2%) had secondary infertility. Details of the demographic
data of the females are listed in Table 1.

One hundred thirty-one cases (28.85%) were diagnosed as infertile due to anovulation, disregarding whether
anovulation was due to PCOS, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or premature ovarian failure. Seventy-six
cases (16.74%) were attributed to male factors, 15 cases (3.3%) were due to tubal damage, 13 cases (2.86%)
were due to endometriosis, 158 cases (34.8%) were idiopathic, defined as patients with no apparent cause of
infertility despite having a regular menstrual cycle, and 61 cases (13.43%) being multifactorial (infertility
attributed to more than one of the cases mentioned above). These findings are summarized in Table 2.

Discussion
In our study, we evaluated the effect of hormones, demographic determinants, as well as treatment modality
on biochemical pregnancy among a female sample from Palestine. Despite Palestine being a developing
country, its fertility pattern is considered distinct compared to that of other, surrounding developing nations
in that the high fertility rate coexists with a high level of education and a low level of infant mortality.
Moreover, due to the special political situation in Palestine, fertility is not considered a mere biological
reality, but a political one - Palestinian women desire to have more children as a means of resistance
against the continuous displacement and human loss due to ongoing conflict [10].

In our study, we found a statistically significant relationship (p-value of 0.003) between FSH level pre-in
vitro fertilization (IVF) and biochemical pregnancy, which was in agreement with several studies in which
FSH level was found to be a significant negative predictive factor of clinical pregnancy [11,12]. LH levels were
not statistically significant (p-value of 0.995) with regard to the biochemical pregnancy test. This finding
was opposed to some studies that showed that the mean serum concentration of LH was significantly low in
couples who conceive in comparison to couples who did not [13,14]. The other studied hormones, namely,
TSH and hPRL (p = 0.592, 0.282, respectively), did not have a statistically significant relationship with the
outcomes and the success of the pregnancy trial, which was in agreement with previous studies that showed
no significant difference between the two groups in the serum concentration of TSH and hPRL [13]. In
addition, we found a very strong relationship between the modality of treatment and biochemical
pregnancy.

As we predicted, the pre-treatment diagnosis had a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.04) with the
outcome, but in clinical practice, it is rare for child-bearing-age women to have an isolated reproductive
disorder, as most of them suffer from multiple conditions [15]. This means that multiple, coexisting
reproductive disorders should be taken into account when studying pregnancy outcomes. Our
finding coincides with another study that summarizes all reproductive disorders that could affect the
pregnancy outcome in women of childbearing age [16]. Our results revealed that whether the patient had
not had a previous pregnancy (primary infertility) or failed to conceive after one or more successful
pregnancies (secondary infertility) had no statistical significance on the outcome (p = 0.268). Whether the
patient had a regular menstrual cycle or not did not impact the outcome of treatment (p = 0.469).
Chronological parameters of the patient did not impact the outcome of treatment as well - the mean age at
marriage was relatively the same when comparing that of women with successful outcomes compared to
those with a failure result (23.03 years of age vs. 22.49 years), the relationship, as expected, was not
statistically significant (p = 0.308).

The age of presentation did not significantly affect the outcome (p = 0.805), as expected by the close means

of the age of successful vs unsuccessful cases (26.75 vs. 26.88). The duration of infertility is measured as the
number of years between getting married and presenting to the infertility center. Those who presented
before fulfilling one year of infertility were told to come back after fulfilling the required duration. As there
was no difference between successful and unsuccessful cases regarding the duration of infertility (both
groups had a mean of 3.98), the relationship was statistically insignificant (p = 0.99). These findings might
be attributed to the fact that most of the women studied belonged to the same age category, and further
studies, including more women of a wider spectrum of age categories, should be conducted. Regarding the
modality of treatment, a very strong relationship was found between the type of treatment and the success
of the cycle, as the rate of success for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was significantly higher
compared to intrauterine insemination and ovarian stimulation (68.21% vs 29.58% vs 2.20%), with a p-value
of 0.001.

This clinical audit is considered the first at Razan Medical Center for Infertility, as it will help modify and
enhance clinical practice and patient care. In addition, the large sample size helped define the actual
relationships between different determinants. Being a retrospective cohort study, its results are considered
relatively strong and reliable. Our study was limited by the high number of incomplete files, manifested by
the fact that of the total of 459 infertile females enrolled in the study, only 291 completed their
investigations, giving a rate of 63.5% of adherence to follow-up. The insufficient data were in the
biochemical markers of infertility, including FSH and LH.

Conclusions
We found a strong relationship between FSH levels with the success of treatment. The underlying diagnosis
significantly affected the success rate. Our most important finding was the extremely significant relationship
between the ICSI technique and positive outcome, as it was superior to both IUI and ovarian stimulation in
achieving a positive end result. We recommend starting with ICSI for eligible patients to save their time and
effort in achieving their desired results. However, this remained an obstacle given how expensive ICSI is
compared to IUI. Furthermore, we recommend testing FSH hormone as routine for patients who present to
the IVF center.
