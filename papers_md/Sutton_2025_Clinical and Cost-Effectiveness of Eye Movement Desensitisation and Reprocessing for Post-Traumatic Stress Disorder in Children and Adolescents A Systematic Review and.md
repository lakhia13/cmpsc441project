ABSTRACT
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological therapy used to treat trauma. While trauma- focused 
cognitive behavioural therapy (TF- CBT) is often used, EMDR has potential for treating post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Previous research has focused on adult populations, with limited evidence for children and adolescents available. A systematic 
review was conducted to evaluate the clinical and cost- effectiveness of EMDR for treating or preventing PTSD in children and 
adolescents. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a comprehensive search of six databases in September 
2023. Eligibility criteria were based on the NICE 2018 PTSD guidelines. Data were extracted, and risk of bias was assessed using 
the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Meta- analyses were conducted where appropriate. Of 1220 unique records identified, nine 
studies  met  the  inclusion  criteria.  Eight  RCTs  (n = 794  participants)  explored  clinical  effectiveness,  and  one  study  examined 
cost- effectiveness. Most studies compared EMDR with waitlist/usual care. A meta- analysis demonstrated a significant and large 
effect size (SMD 1.57 95% CrI = 0.07–3.21) of EMDR treatment (delivered 3 months or more following trauma) compared with 
waitlist/usual care for children and adolescents with PTSD, in various populations including refugees, and victims of physical 
and/or sexual violence. Two trials compared EMDR with TF- CBT and found no significant difference between therapies. From 
the very limited cost- effectiveness evidence available, EMDR was ranked sixth out of 10 interventions. EMDR was demonstrated 
to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents, particularly when compared with waitlist/usual care. 
However, more high- quality RCTs are needed to establish definitive conclusions. In addition, future research should prioritise 
within- trial cost- effectiveness analyses to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cost–benefit profile of EMDR.

Summary

•  Eye  movement  desensitisation  and  reprocessing 
(EMDR) is an effective treatment for reducing PTSD 
symptoms  in  children  and  adolescents,  with  a  large 
effect  size  observed  when  compared  with  waitlist  or 
usual care.

•  EMDR  appears  to  be  as  effective  as  trauma- focused 
cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (TF- CBT)  in  the  child 
and  adolescent  population.  This  systematic  review 
found no significant differences in clinical outcomes 
between the two therapies, suggesting that EMDR is a 
comparable and valid alternative.

•  More  high- quality,  methodologically  sound  studies 
are  needed  to  provide  definitive  conclusions.  Future 
research  should  prioritise  well- designed  randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) and include cost- effectiveness 
analyses to provide a more complete picture of EMDR's 
benefits.

1   |   Introduction

Eye  movement  desensitisation  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  is  a 
psychological  therapy  for  those  experiencing  trauma.  While 
trauma- focused  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (TF- CBT)  re-
mains the most widely used approach (Thielemann et al. 2022), 
EMDR  has  the  potential  to  address  the  unique  challenges  of 
post- traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  in  younger  populations 
(Hoppen, Meiser- Stedman, et al. 2023; Adamowicz 2024).

Previous research has primarily focused on adult populations, 
exploring  EMDR's  effectiveness  in  various  trauma  contexts, 
such as combat, natural disasters and displacement (Kitchiner 
et al. 2019; Le Roux and Cobham 2022; Macgowan et al. 2022; 
Maglione  et  al.  2022).  Systematic  reviews  and  meta- analyses 
have  demonstrated  comparable  outcomes  between  EMDR  and 
TF- CBT  in  treating  PTSD  among  adults  (Hudays  et  al.  2022; 
Hoppen, Jehn, et al. 2023). However, the evidence base for chil-
dren and adolescents is much less extensive, and there is a grow-
ing need for more comprehensive research on EMDR's efficacy 
for children and adolescents. In 2018, the UK National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance for 
recognising,  assessing  and  treating  PTSD  in  children,  young 
people and adults (NICE 2018). The guidelines for children and 
adolescents were based on evidence reviews that identified liter-
ature up to January 2018 and included only two randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) (Soberman et al. 2002; de Roos et al. 2017).

It is essential to conduct up- to- date systematic reviews to inform 
clinical guidelines and practice. This review aims to evaluate the 
most recent RCT evidence on EMDR's effectiveness, safety and 
cost- effectiveness  in  treating  or  preventing  PTSD  in  children 
and  adolescents.  By  examining  comparisons  with  alternative 
treatments or no treatment, this review will contribute to a more 
comprehensive understanding of EMDR's role in addressing the 
unique needs of young people affected by trauma.

The  objective  of  this  review  was  to  update  the  rigorous  NICE 
guidance and identify evidence published since 2018; therefore, 

the eligibility criteria mirrored those of the NICE 2018 guidelines 
(NICE 2018). In a recent survey of psychiatrists in 39 European 
countries, of those who used clinical guidelines, NICE was on a 
par with the World Health Organization (WHO) as the preferred 
source of guidelines (Rojnic Kuzman et al. 2024), demonstrating 
the  relevance  and  use  of  updating  the  NICE  review.  Updating 
the evidence reviews from the NICE guidance is crucial for in-
forming clinical practice and ensuring that therapists and their 
clients have access to the most up- to- date, evidence- based treat-
ment options. By evaluating recent research, this review directly 
informs therapists, including those using EMDR and other mo-
dalities, on the effectiveness of EMDR for children and adoles-
cents with PTSD. This ensures that clinical decisions are guided 
by the best available evidence, ultimately benefiting patient care.

2   |   Materials and Methods

The  systematic  review  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with 
the  general  principles  recommended  in  the  York  CRD  guid-
ance (Akers et al. 2009) and the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  (PRISMA)  statement 
(Page et al. 2021) (see Appendix S1). The review protocol is reg-
istered on the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic re-
views as CRD42023463360. The review question was: What is 
the clinical and cost- effectiveness of EMDR for the prevention 
and treatment of children and adolescents with PTSD?

2.1   |   Searches

Systematic searches to identify RCTs and cost- effectiveness stud-
ies  were  conducted  in  September  2023,  using  the  following  bib-
liographic  databases:  MEDLINE  via  Ovid,  Embase  via  Ovid, 
PsycINFO via Ovid, Cochrane Library, CINAHL via EBSCO and 
PTSDpubs via ProQuest. The EMDR Publications Database main-
tained by the University of Sheffield for EMDR UK Members was 
also searched to cross- check for any additional references. Searches 
were conducted using a combination of subject headings and free- 
text search terms related to the population (people with PTSD) and 
the intervention (EMDR). The search strategy for MEDLINE can 
be found in Box 1. Boolean operators were used to combine these 
terms, and published methodological search filters were applied to 
identify RCTs, economic studies and systematic reviews (Glanville 
et al. 2025). A broad search including all ages was conducted, and 
results were separated into those relating to adults and those re-
lating to children and adolescents. The review relating to adults is 
published separately (Simpson et al. 2025). The search strategy did 
not exclude any ages, and adolescents were classed as individuals 
aged  from  10  to  19 years,  as  defined  by  the  WHO  (2025).  When 
synthesising  research  on  children  and  young  people,  chronolog-
ical age is the most reliable variable for grouping and comparing 
participants across different studies in order to conduct reproduc-
ible systematic reviews. This is because standardised developmen-
tal stage measures are not consistently reported. All comparators 
eligible  to  be  included  in  the  review,  where  directly  compared 
with EMDR; therefore, it was not necessary to include comparator 
terms in the search strategy. Searches were limited to studies pub-
lished from 2018 onward to focus on evidence published since the 
NICE guidelines on PTSD. Pre- 2018 RCTs were sourced from the 
evidence review underpinning those guidelines. The search was

not limited by language, but non- English language studies and ab-
stracts were excluded unless they provided sufficient information 
for data extraction and quality assessment.

The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE via Ovid, with 
input from clinical experts and was peer- reviewed by a second 
information  specialist  using  the  PRESS  checklist  (McGowan 
et  al.  2016).  Supplementary  searching  included  reference  list 
screening  of  included  studies  and  relevant  systematic  reviews 
and  hand  searching  of  key  journals  and  websites.  An  update 
search  of  the  EMDR  Publications  Database  was  conducted  in 
January 2025 to check for potentially relevant studies since the 
original literature search was conducted. The full search strate-
gies and sources can be found in Appendix S2.

2.2   |   Study Selection, Data Extraction and Risk 
of Bias Assessment

As  this  review  aimed  to  update  the  findings  reported  in  the 
2018  NICE  guidelines  (NICE  2018),  the  eligibility  criteria  ap-
plied were consistent with those used in the original guidelines 
(see Table 1). Therefore, studies in specific populations with the 
coexisting  conditions,  adjustment  disorders,  traumatic  grief, 
psychosis  and  learning  disabilities,  were  excluded.  Reported 
symptoms relating to comorbidities such as anxiety and depres-
sion  were  analysed  as  secondary  outcomes,  recognising  that 
PTSD often involves significant psychiatric comorbidity, partic-
ularly high rates of co- occurring depression and anxiety symp-
toms (Qassem et al. 2021), the reduction of which is relevant for 
assessing overall treatment success.

Identified  records  were  imported  into  Covidence  software 
(Veritas Health Innovation, n.d.). Two reviewers independently 

conducted  study  selection  at  both  the  title/abstract  and  full- 
text  stages,  using  the  eligibility  criteria  outlined  in  Table  1. 
Disagreements  between  reviewers  were  resolved  through 
consensus  or  by  consulting  a  subject  expert.  For  clinical  effec-
tiveness and safety, data were extracted into a prepiloted data ex-
traction form by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. 
Disagreements were resolved through consensus or by consult-
ing  a  subject  expert.  The  following  data  were  tabulated:  study 
characteristics,  participant  characteristics,  intervention  and 
comparator details and clinical outcome measures and results. 
As per the NICE 2018 guidelines, we searched for and extracted 
quantitative  data  only,  outcomes  that  are  formally  measured 
using validated scales.

For cost- effectiveness studies, data were collected on the follow-
ing study characteristics:

•  Publication information (author, year and journal)

•  Study  design  (country,  population,  perspective  [outcome 
and costs], analysis type [within- trial and statistical meth-
ods  used  or  modelling/modelling- type],  outcome  measure 
and  associated  detail  [e.g.,  preference- based  measure  and 
utility  value  set],  time  horizon,  comparators,  intervention 
duration, cost type, discount rates and year of valuation)

For  RCTs,  the  quality  of  included  studies  was  assessed 
using  the  validated  Cochrane  Risk  of  Bias  2.0  tool  (Sterne 
et  al.  2019).  This  assessment  focused  on  the  primary  out-
come of our review and was conducted by one reviewer, with

to the trials identified from both the update searches and the 
NICE evidence reviews.

2.3   |   Methods of Data Synthesis for Clinical 
Effectiveness

A  minimum  of  three  studies  were  required  for  statistical  as-
sessment via pairwise meta- analysis (Dias et al. 2013). To be in-
cluded in a pairwise meta- analysis, a study had to provide both 
mean and standard deviation (SD) for changes in PTSD symp-
toms from pretreatment to post- treatment, or these data had to 
be calculable.

The primary outcome of interest was the change in PTSD symp-
toms,  expressed  as  a  standardised  mean  difference  (SMD)  to 
facilitate  comparisons  across  studies  using  different  scoring 
methods.  Detailed  information  regarding  the  assumptions, 
calculations  and  statistical  analyses  used  to  assess  treatment 
effects can be found in the Supporting Information. A positive 
change in SMD indicated improvement, while a negative change 
indicated worsening of symptoms. Only one meta- analysis was 
possible,  focusing  on  delayed  treatment  of  children  and  ado-
lescents  with  PTSD  (i.e.,  3 months  or  more  following  trauma). 
Meta- analyses for prevention or early treatment were not feasi-
ble due to insufficient data.

Because data were selected from studies from independent re-
searchers, a common effect size could not be assumed. Therefore, 
a random- effects model was used to account for heterogeneity 
in  treatment  effects.  Model  parameters  were  estimated  using 
a  Bayesian  framework,  with  details  provided  in  Appendix  S3. 
All analyses were conducted using the freely available software 
WinBUGS  (Lunn  et  al.  2000)  via  the  R  package,  R2WinBUGS 
(Sturtz  et  al.  2005).  Results  are  presented  alongside  the  poste-
rior median treatment effects and 95% credible intervals (CrI). 
Effect sizes were graded using Cohen's criteria: not substantial 
(SMD < 0.2), small (0.2 ≤ SMD < 0.5), medium (0.5 ≤ SMD < 0.8) 
and  large  (0.8 ≤ SMD)  (Cohen  2013).  Study  heterogeneity  was 
assessed  and  interpreted  using  established  categories  (Ren 
et al. 2018).

For  comparisons  where  meta- analysis  was  not  feasible,  for 
example,  where  the  required  minimum  of  three  studies  was 
not  met,  or  data  were  not  provided  in  a  suitable  format  for 
statistical  calculation,  a  narrative  synthesis  was  conducted. 
Narrative synthesis was also used to report on all secondary 
outcomes.  For  the  narrative  synthesis,  data  were  systemati-
cally grouped into tables to analyse.

3.1   |   Search Results

More  than  1200  titles  and  abstracts  were  screened  from  the 
bibliographic  database  searches,  160  full- text  articles  were 
checked and eight studies (nine reports) were found that met

the  inclusion  criteria  (Figure  1).  One  study  focused  on  cost- 
effectiveness,  while  the  remaining  seven  studies  (eight  re-
ports) reported clinical effectiveness data for PTSD outcomes 
(Figure 1). An additional study was identified from the 2018 
NICE guidelines (de Roos et al. 2017). This was the only rele-
vant study from the original 2018 NICE review. One other trial 
evaluating EMDR in children or adolescents with PTSD was 
included  in  the  NICE  2018  guidance  (Soberman  et  al.  2002) 
but  was  excluded  from  this  review  because  only  31%  of  par-
ticipants  had  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  and  discrete  data  for  this 
group were not reported. The primary diagnosis for most par-
ticipants in the study was conduct disorder (59%). The update 
search  in  January  2025  identified  16  potential  new  studies, 
but  none  satisfied  the  inclusion  criteria.  Therefore,  this  re-
view includes a total of eight relevant RCTs evaluating EMDR 

in children and adolescents with PTSD from both before and 
after 2018 and represents the total evidence of relevant studies 
satisfying the inclusion criteria.

3.2   |   Clinical Effectiveness Results

Eight  RCTs  (nine  reports)  published  between  2017  and  2021 
were  identified  providing  up- to- date  data  on  EMDR's  clinical 
effectiveness  for  PTSD  in  children  and  adolescents  (de  Roos 
et al. 2017; Osorio et al. 2018; Jaberghaderi et al. 2019; Molero 
et  al.  2019;  Jiménez  et  al.  2020;  Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021; 
Karadag  et  al.  2021;  Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022).  Tables  2 
and 3 provide details of the study and participant characteristics 
of these trials.

All studies were unblinded; four studies were based in a single 
centre  (Osorio  et  al.  2018;  Jaberghaderi  et  al.  2019;  Meentken 
et  al.  2020,  2021;  Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022),  three  were 
multicentre  (de  Roos  et  al.  2017;  Molero  et  al.  2019;  Jiménez 
et al. 2020) and one was community based (Karadag et al. 2021). 
This  latter  study  (Karadag  et  al.  2021)  evaluated  a  unique 
self- help  EMDR  intervention,  and  as  such  represented  a  very 
different  approach  to  EMDR  compared  with  all  other  stud-
ies.  The  studies  were  conducted  in  the  Netherlands  (n = 2)  (de 
Roos  et  al.  2017;  Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021),  Mexico  (n = 2) 
(Osorio et al. 2018; Jiménez et al. 2020), Turkey (n = 2) (Karadag 
et  al.  2021;  Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022),  Spain  (Molero 
et al. 2019) and Iran (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019). Data were col-
lected  at  multiple  timepoints  in  studies,  from  immediate  post- 
treatment assessments to a maximum follow- up; these follow- up 
periods ranged from 2 weeks (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019) to 1 year 
(de Roos et al. 2017); the follow- up duration was unclear in one 
study (Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022).

The  trials  evaluated  a  range  of  EMDR  delivery  approaches: 
Three  studies  delivered  an  EMDR  group  protocol  (Osorio 
et al. 2018; Molero et al. 2019; Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022), 
two  for  ongoing  traumatic  stress  (OTS)  (Osorio  et  al.  2018; 
Molero  et  al.  2019).  One  study  delivered  the  Protocol 
for  Recent  Critical  Incidents  (PRECI)  protocol  (Jiménez 
et  al.  2020).  Group  therapy  interventions  tended  to  be  more 
intensive.  The  number  of  treatment  sessions  differed  across 
the studies, where reported, from as few as a mean of 3.5 ses-
sions  (Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021)  to  a  maximum  of  12  ses-
sions (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019), over differing periods of time, 
from  2 days  (with  six  sessions)  (Osorio  et  al.  2018)  to  1 week 
(Karadag  et  al.  2021)  or  several  weeks  (de  Roos  et  al.  2017; 
Jiménez et al. 2020).

All studies compared EMDR with waitlist/treatment as usual/
no  treatment.  Two  studies  also  included  a  third  arm:  both 
compared  EMDR  with  TF- CBT,  with  treatments  lasting  4–12 
(Jaberghaderi et al. 2019) or 6 weeks (de Roos et al. 2017). Most 
studies assessed the effectiveness of delayed treatment (deliv-
ered  3 months  or  more  following  trauma);  only  two  studies 
examined  EMDR  for  prevention  of  PTSD  (children  and  ado-
lescents  had  subclinical  levels  of  PTSD)  (Osorio  et  al.  2018; 
Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021).  All  trials  used  self- report  mea-
sures only for children and/or parents, three studies used the 
DSM- 5  Post- Traumatic  Checklist  (PCL- 5)  (Osorio  et  al.  2018; 
Molero  et  al.  2019;  Jiménez  et  al.  2020),  two  studies  used 
Childhood  Post- Traumatic  Stress  Reaction  Index  (CTPS- RI) 
(Karadag et al. 2021; Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022), two stud-
ies used the Children's Responses to Trauma Inventory (CRTI) 
(de Roos et al. 2017; Meentken et al. 2020, 2021) and one study 
used Child/Parent Report of Post- Traumatic Stress Symptoms 
(CROPS/PROPS), Persian version (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019).

The  populations  studied  (see  Table  3)  included  refugees 
(Molero  et  al.  2019;  Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022),  child-
hood abuse and/or parental conflict (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019), 
female  victims  of  sexual  and/or  physical  violence  (Jiménez 
et  al.  2020),  individuals  hospitalised  with  or  affected  by 
COVID- 19 (Meentken et al. 2020, 2021; Karadag et al. 2021) 
and  cancer  patients  (Osorio  et  al.  2018).  Children  and  ad-
olescents  in  one  study  had  been  exposed  to  a  wide  range  of 

different  traumas,  including  physical  and  sexual  abuse  and 
disasters (de Roos et al. 2017). Four studies included popula-
tions with PTSD following a single traumatic event (de Roos 
et  al.  2017;  Osorio  et  al.  2018;  Molero  et  al.  2019;  Karadag 
et  al.  2021),  and  one  study  was  in  a  mixed  population  (sin-
gle  and  multiple  trauma)  (Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021).  The 
remaining four studies did not clearly specify whether partici-
pants had experienced single, multiple or ongoing trauma.

According  to  the  WHO  definition,  adolescents  are  between  10 
and  19 years  old  (WHO  2025).  All  studies  included  adolescent 
participants  (see  Table  3),  with  some  studies  potentially  only 
including  this  age  group  (data  unclear).  Two  studies  reported 
a  mean  age  of  between  9  and  10 years  (Meentken  et  al.  2020, 
2021; Karadag et al. 2021), one study reported that participants 
fell within an age range of 8–12 years (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019), 
one  study  reported  a  mean  age  of  approximately  13 years  (de 
Roos et al. 2017) and three studies reported a mean age of be-
tween  15  and  17 years  (Osorio  et  al.  2018;  Molero  et  al.  2019; 
Jiménez et al. 2020). One study did not report a mean age, only 
a  range  of  6–15 years  as  an  inclusion  criterion  (Banoglu  and 
Korkmazlar  2022).  The  female:male  split  was  generally  even 
in most studies, but one study was conducted exclusively with 
female children and adolescents (female victims of physical or 
sexual violence) (Jiménez et al. 2020) and one exclusively with 
male refugees (Molero et al. 2019).

3.3   |   Risk of Bias Assessments

All  of  the  trials  conducted  in  children  and  adolescents  were 
assessed as being at either high (de Roos et al. 2017; Banoglu 
and  Korkmazlar  2022;  Jaberghaderi  et  al.  2019;  Karadag 
et  al.  2021)  or  moderate  risk  of  bias  (Jiménez  et  al.  2020; 
Molero  et  al.  2019;  Meentken  et  al.  2020;  Osorio  et  al.  2018) 
(see  Figure  2).  The  primary  methodological  concerns  iden-
tified  in  the  trials  were  related  to  randomisation,  outcome 
measurement  and  selective  reporting.  While  randomisation 
was attempted, inadequate allocation concealment may have 
led  to  imbalances  between  groups.  The  unblinded  nature  of 
the  trials  increased  the  risk  of  observer  bias  in  primary  and 
secondary  outcome  measurement,  with  rare  exceptions  for 
any outcome measure (de Roos et al. 2017). Additionally, the 
lack of detailed trial protocols raised concerns about potential 
selective reporting of outcomes. Generally, there were no re-
ported  deviations  from  the  planned  interventions,  and  miss-
ing data were not a significant issue due to the short duration 
of treatment and follow- up.

3.4   |   PTSD Results

To  make  the  comparisons  more  homogenous  and  robust,  and 
in accordance with the previous NICE guidelines (NICE 2018), 
the studies were grouped and analysed based on the following 
criteria:

•  Comparator: TF- CBT or waitlist/usual care/no treatment

•  Treatment  timing:  Delayed  (more  than  3 months  post- 

trauma) or early (within 3 months)

10 of 17

Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy, 2025

FIGURE 2    |    Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment of included studies.

•  Follow- up: Post- treatment or later duration

•  Outcome assessment: Self- report or clinician assessed

reported  a  decline  in  the  usual  care  group  at  the  90- day  fol-
low- up (Jiménez et al. 2020).

All of the included studies assessed self- report only, and therapy 
more than 3 months after the index event (delayed). The PTSD 
results for all included studies are presented in Table 4. A total of 
794 patients contributed PTSD data, with n = 371 randomly as-
signed to EMDR, n = 82 to TF- CBT and n = 341 to waitlist/usual 
care/no treatment. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of 
populations and comparisons.

3.4.1   |   EMDR vs. TF- CBT for Treatment of PTSD

Two studies (de Roos et al. 2017; Jaberghaderi et al. 2019) com-
pared  delayed  (three  or  more  months  after  trauma)  EMDR 
with  TF- CBT  for  treating  PTSD  in  children  and  adolescents. 
Both treatments led to improvements, but there were no signif-
icant  differences  between  the  groups  at  follow- ups  of  2 weeks 
(Jaberghaderi  et  al.  2019),  3 months  or  12 months  (de  Roos 
et al. 2017). EMDR sessions were conducted at least three times, 
while a maximum of 12 TF- CBT sessions were delivered. Due 
to the limited number of studies (< 3), a meta- analysis was not 
possible for this comparison.

3.4.2   |   EMDR vs. Waitlist/Usual Care/No Treatment 
for Treatment of PTSD

Six  studies  (de  Roos  et  al.  2017;  Jaberghaderi  et  al.  2019; 
Molero  et  al.  2019;  Jiménez  et  al.  2020;  Karadag  et  al.  2021; 
Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022)  compared  EMDR  with  wait-
list or usual care for children and adolescents with PTSD. All 
studies showed improvement in the EMDR group, and EMDR 
was significantly better than the control conditions. One study 

Five  of  the  six  studies  were  suitable  for  meta- analysis.  The 
Karadag  trial  (Karadag  et  al.  2021)  did  not  provide  data  in  a 
suitable  format  for  meta- analysis  and  involved  a  unique  self- 
help  intervention,  making  it  less  comparable  with  traditional 
EMDR  therapy.  Two  of  the  studies  were  considered  to  have  a 
high risk of bias (Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022; Jaberghaderi 
et al. 2019), while the remaining three were at moderate risk (de 
Roos et al. 2017; Molero et al. 2019; Jiménez et al. 2020). A total 
of 393 participants were included across the four studies. A pair-
wise meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate the overall effect 
of EMDR compared with the control conditions of waitlist/usual 
care. Figure 3 presents the SMD of EMDR compared with wait-
list/usual care, as measured by self- reported scores in children 
and adolescents.

The  meta- analysis  found  that  EMDR  was  significantly  more 
effective than waitlist, usual care or no treatment for children 
and adolescents with PTSD, with a large effect size. The SMD 
was 1.57 (95% CrI = 0.07–3.21). However, there was substantial 
heterogeneity in the results between studies, as indicated by a 
between- study  SD  of  1.55  (95%  CrI = 0.69–2.65).  According  to 
the  interpretation  presented  by  Ren  et  al.  (2018),  this  suggests 
that  the  treatment  effect  in  one  study  could  be  up  to  50  times 
larger than that in another study; this is likely to be due to the 
much larger treatment effect observed in the Jimenez 2020 study 
relative to the other four studies, as well as other potential differ-
ences in study design and populations.

The previous NICE review (NICE 2018) found no significant dif-
ference between EMDR and waitlist/usual care, though the re-
sults slightly favoured EMDR (SMD 0.90, 95% CrI −0.85 to 2.64). 
That finding was based on only two studies (de Roos et al. 2017;

FIGURE 3    |    Meta- analysis for delayed EMDR treatment in children and adolescents with PTSD versus waitlist/usual care/no treatment (self- 
reported outcomes) and risk of bias assessment.

Soberman et al. 2002), one of which (Soberman et al. 2002) only 
included  a  small  proportion  of  trial  participants  with  PTSD 
(31%),  and  no  discrete  outcome  data  for  this  subgroup,  and  so 
was excluded from the current review.

3.4.3   |   EMDR vs. Waitlist/Usual Care/No Treatment 
for Prevention of PTSD

Two studies compared EMDR with usual care/no treatment for 
prevention  of  PTSD  in  children  and  adolescents  and  reported 
improvements in the EMDR group (Osorio et al. 2018; Meentken 
et  al.  2020,  2021).  However,  only  one  study  directly  compared 
the two groups and found a statistically significant advantage for 
EMDR (Osorio et al. 2018). Due to the limited number of studies 
(< 3), and the lack of SD data in one study, a meta- analysis was 
not possible for this comparison.

3.5   |   Other Outcomes

A  range  of  other  outcomes  was  also  reported  by  these  trials, 
including  discontinuation  and  adverse  event  rates,  depression, 
anxiety and quality of life scores (data provided in Appendix S4).

Six of the seven included studies reported discontinuation rates 
(Osorio et al. 2018; Jaberghaderi et al. 2019; Molero et al. 2019; 
Jiménez et al. 2020; Karadag et al. 2021; Meentken et al. 2021; 
Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022). There were no significant dif-
ferences in discontinuation rates between EMDR and TF- CBT. 
When comparing EMDR with waitlist/usual care, the evidence 
was inconsistent. Some studies reported lower discontinuation 
rates  with  EMDR  (Jiménez  et  al.  2020;  Karadag  et  al.  2021; 
Banoglu  and  Korkmazlar  2022),  while  others  reported  higher 
rates  (Jaberghaderi  et  al.  2019).  However,  the  studies  varied 
in  terms  of  participant,  intervention  and  comparator  details.

Some settings, such as those with displaced populations (Molero 
et al. 2019; Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022), were less conducive 
to treatment continuation due to external factors.

alternative values for the risk of relapse, the results remained ro-
bust. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, cognitive therapy 
remained the most cost- effective intervention in all scenarios.

Three of the seven included studies reported on adverse events 
(Osorio et al. 2018; Molero et al. 2019; Jiménez et al. 2020) and 
found  no  significant  adverse  effects  associated  with  EMDR  or 
the comparator, treatment as usual (Jiménez et al. 2020).

Six  studies  assessed  depression  and/or  anxiety  outcomes  in 
children and adolescents (Osorio et al. 2018; Molero et al. 2019; 
Jiménez  et  al.  2020;  Meentken  et  al.  2020,  2021;  Karadag 
et al. 2021; Banoglu and Korkmazlar 2022). Given the high rates 
of comorbidity with PTSD, these outcomes help to measure the 
holistic  effectiveness  of  treatments.  Studies  comparing  EMDR 
with waitlist/usual care or no treatment generally found signif-
icant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms following 
EMDR  treatment  relative  to  the  comparator.  However,  while 
the data suggest that EMDR may have a positive impact on both 
depression  and  anxiety,  this  evidence  is  limited  by  the  small 
number  of  studies,  methodological  limitations  and  variability 
between  studies.  All  of  the  studies  contributing  data  on  these 
outcomes  were  at  high  or  moderate  risk  of  bias;  had  relatively 
small  sample  sizes;  and  demonstrated  some  heterogeneity  in 
terms of details of populations, interventions and comparators.

3.6   |   Cost- Effectiveness Results

None of the RCTs included in the clinical effectiveness section 
provided a within- trial cost- effectiveness analysis, which would 
have  given  insight  into  the  cost  of  delivering  the  intervention, 
alongside the causal impact of future  costs and general health 
outcomes.  One  modelling- based  cost- effectiveness  study  was 
identified by the search (Mavranezouli, Megnin- Viggars, Grey, 
et al. 2020). The effectiveness evidence was based on a network 
meta- analysis that included 29 RCTs for changes in PTSD symp-
tom  scores  between  baseline  and  treatment  endpoint  and  10 
RCTs  for  changes  in  PTSD  symptom  scores  between  baseline 
and  1-   to  4- month  follow- up  (Mavranezouli,  Megnin- Viggars, 
Trickey, et al. 2020).

The model used a hybrid decision- analytic model of a decision 
tree followed by a Markov model. The cohort was based on those 
under the age of 18. The population concerned those with clin-
ically  important  PTSD  with  symptoms  present  for  more  than 
3 months  after  the  incident.  Cognitive  therapy,  a  form  of  TF- 
CBT, was the most cost- effective intervention, while EMDR was 
the sixth most cost- effective intervention, out of 10 interventions 
and no treatment. However, this ranking separates TF- CBT into 
multiple subtypes (cognitive, narrative exposure, exposure/PE, 
Cohen TF- CBT/CPT and group therapy), with all but one rank-
ing higher than EMDR. When considering these TF- CBT inter-
ventions as a whole, EMDR would rank third, with only TF- CBT 
and play therapy above it. Although EMDR had lower direct in-
tervention costs, the effectiveness data used in the model meant 
that  patients  receiving  TF- CBT  and  play  therapy  were  more 
likely to achieve remission than those receiving EMDR, relative 
to  no  treatment.  For  EMDR,  this  resulted  in  higher  long- term 
health state costs and lower QALYs, making it less cost- effective. 
The deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that when using 

4   |   Discussion

This review of the clinical and cost- effectiveness of EMDR for 
treatment and prevention of PTSD in children and adolescents 
identified eight relevant trials and one cost- effectiveness study. 
Previous  NICE  guidance  (NICE  2018)  included  only  one  of 
these eight studies (de Roos et al. 2017), highlighting the sizable 
amount of new evidence identified and analysed by the current 
review. No other systematic review has been published to date 
on the clinical and cost- effectiveness of EMDR within this spe-
cific population of children and adolescents with PTSD or sub-
clinical PTSD.

All  of  the  studies  investigating  clinical  effectiveness  were  at 
high or moderate risk of bias. Most compared EMDR with wait-
list/usual care, with only two comparing EMDR with TF- CBT. 
Meta- analysis of data from five studies was feasible for the com-
parison  of  EMDR  versus  waitlist/usual  care/no  treatment  and 
found that, for children and adolescents who received treatment 
more than 3 months after a traumatic event, EMDR was signifi-
cantly  more  effective  than  waitlist/usual  care/no  treatment  in 
reducing  PTSD  symptoms,  regardless  of  the  trauma  (type  and 
frequency)  and  age  of  the  participants,  or  the  details  of  the 
EMDR  approach.  This  was  measured  at  the  end  of  treatment 
using self- report scales, with a SMD of 1.57 (95% CrI 0.07–3.21).

Evidence  from  two  studies  comparing  EMDR  with  TF- CBT 
demonstrated that both therapies improved symptoms for chil-
dren  and  adolescents  with  PTSD,  but  there  was  no  significant 
difference between the two groups at follow- up. One study was 
assessed to have a high risk of bias (Jaberghaderi et al. 2019) and 
one to have a moderate risk of bias (de Roos et al. 2017).

In terms of other outcomes, such as rates of discontinuations, 
adverse  events  and  impact  on  anxiety  and  depression,  the 
trend was also for there to be no significant difference between 
EMDR  and  TF- CBT.  There  was  no  significant  difference  be-
tween  EMDR  and  waitlist/usual  care/no  treatment  for  dis-
continuations and adverse events, but there was superiority of 
EMDR in terms of anxiety and depression. Further research is 
needed  to  better  understand  the  factors  that  influence  treat-
ment  discontinuation  in  children  and  adolescents  receiving 
EMDR.  Our  review  also  identified  two  studies  regarding  the 
prevention  of  PTSD.  Analysis  of  EMDR  for  this  group  (com-
pared with usual care) is new: No studies were identified at the 
time  of  the  previous  NICE  review  or  have  been  published  in 
any other review.

The clinical effectiveness review therefore identified a number 
of  RCTs  demonstrating  the  consistent  efficacy  of  EMDR  for 
PTSD in a range of child and adolescent populations, using sev-
eral  different  approaches  to  EMDR  delivery,  and  in  a  number 
of different settings, using a number of different outcome mea-
sures. However, the evidence base is still relatively limited: It is 
at a high or moderate risk of bias, uses only self- report outcome 
measures  and  is  very  limited  in  terms  of  active  comparisons

(only two trials comparing EMDR with the most common ther-
apy of choice for child or adolescent PTSD, TF- CBT) and preven-
tion (as opposed to treatment). The unblinded design of studies 
introduces potential bias. However, while blinding of most key 
persons in RCTs of psychological interventions may not be fea-
sible (Juul et al. 2021), outcome assessors might be blinded, but 
only when using clinician- assessed tools.

A notable gap in the literature was the absence of within- trial 
cost- effectiveness  analyses.  This  limitation  hindered  a  com-
prehensive  understanding  of  the  cost–benefit  profile  of  these 
interventions.  The  cost- effectiveness  review  was  based  on  a 
single  modelling- based  cost- effectiveness  analysis  which  was 
conducted using a hybrid decision- analytic model. The analysis 
found CBT to be the most cost- effective intervention. However, 
it is important to note that the model's assumptions and the lim-
ited availability of cost data may influence the results. In terms 
of limitations of the review processes, the search applied a date 
limit of 2018 and used a previous review as the source for any 
relevant  trials  published  before  that  date.  Best  practice  would 
have been to conduct a full search without date limits. However, 
both the current review and the original NICE review applied ex-
actly the same criteria, identified some overlap of evidence, and 
the current review also applied standard supplementary search 
techniques, such as reference checking, in order to identify any 
earlier trials that both reviews might have missed. It should be 
noted  that  all  included  trials  were  published  before  2022  and 
therefore conducted in populations meeting the DSM and ICD 
criteria at the point in time of the study. An update search was 
conducted in January 2025 on the EMDR research publications 
database, which catalogues all peer- reviewed literature relating 
to EMDR, and no new RCTs in children and adolescents with 
trauma were identified.

Further  research  is  needed  in  several  areas.  High- quality  and 
better- reported  RCTs  would  be  beneficial,  including  adequate 
blinding wherever possible, and evidence regarding longer term 
follow- up is currently absent from the literature. Studies inves-
tigating  the  effectiveness  of  EMDR  for  prevention  and  early 
intervention  in  children  and  adolescents  are  required.  Future 
research  should  also  prioritise  conducting  within- trial  cost- 
effectiveness  analyses  to  provide  more  robust  evidence  on  the 
economic  value  of  different  interventions  for  PTSD  in  young 
people. Additionally, further research is needed to refine model 
assumptions and incorporate more precise cost data to enhance 
the reliability of the findings. Despite these limitations, this re-
view suggests potential benefits of EMDR for treating PTSD in 
children and adolescents.

5   |   Conclusion

EMDR was demonstrated to be effective in reducing PTSD symp-
toms in children and adolescents, particularly when compared 
with waitlist/usual care. However, the evidence base is limited, 
and more high- quality RCTs are needed to confirm these find-
ings and explore their broader applications. In addition, future 
research should prioritise within- trial cost- effectiveness analy-
ses to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cost–
benefit profile of EMDR.
