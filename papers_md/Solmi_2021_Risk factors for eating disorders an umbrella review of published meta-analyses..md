Objective: To grade the evidence about risk factors for eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, and binge eating disorder) with an umbrella review approach.
Methods: This was a systematic review of observational studies on risk factors for eating disorders
published in PubMed/PsycInfo/Embase until December 11th, 2019. We recalculated random-effect
meta-analyses, heterogeneity, small-study effect, excess signiﬁcance bias and 95% prediction intervals,
grading signiﬁcant evidence (p o 0.05) from convincing to weak according to established criteria. Quality
was assessed with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2) tool.
Results: Of 2,197 meta-analyses, nine were included, providing evidence on 50 risk factors, 29,272
subjects with eating disorders, and 1,679,385 controls. Although no association was supported by
convincing evidence, highly suggestive evidence supported the association between childhood sexual
abuse and bulimia nervosa (k = 29, 1,103 cases with eating disorders, 8,496 controls, OR, 2.73, 95%
CI 1.96-3.79, p = 2.1 x 10-9, AMSTAR-2 moderate quality) and between appearance-related teasing
victimization and any eating disorder (k = 10, 1,341 cases with eating disorders, 3,295 controls, OR
2.91, 95%CI 2.05-4.12, p = 1.8x10-9, AMSTAR-2 moderate quality). Suggestive, weak, or no evidence
supported 11, 29, and 8 associations, respectively.
Conclusions: The most credible evidence indicates that early traumatic and stressful events are risk
factors for eating disorders. Larger collaborative prospective cohort studies are needed to identify risk
factors for eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa.

Introduction

Eating disorders (ED) are a complex group of psychiatric
disorders characterized by psychopathology which results
in pathological eating behaviors that can lead to medical
complications.1 For example, people with anorexia ner-
vosa (AN) are approximately ﬁve times more likely to die
from any cause and eighteen times more likely to die from
suicide than the general population.2,3 In addition, bulimia
nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorders (BED) are

associated with complications of vomiting, laxative abuse,
and obesity, respectively.

ED outcomes have remained poor in recent decades,
with high rates of chronicity,4-6 which could suggest a lack
of understanding about the underlying pathophysiological
mechanisms that lead to ED onset and persistence. For
example, the lack of efﬁcacious pharmacological
inter-
ventions speciﬁcally for AN might be due to a relative lack
of
the biological mechanisms underlying
it.7-9 The fact that there is no clearly superior psychosocial

insight about

intervention among a wide range of interventions for adults
and adolescents with AN is also particularly concerning.10
Despite the poor mechanistic knowledge of ED, an
extensive body of literature has investigated putative risk
factors for ED, testing a wide range of environmental11-15
and genetic16-20 risk factors. However, the contrasting
results of individual studies are frequently not conﬁrmed in
meta-analysis. A recent large collaborative genome-wide
association study has shown that metabo-psychiatric
genetic predisposition, speciﬁcally eight previously uni-
dentiﬁed loci, might increase the risk of AN.21

Poor knowledge of the mechanistic processes that lead
to ED and risk factors for ED might be one of the reasons
why early ED intervention and prevention has been studied
less than psychotic and other non-psychotic disorders.22,23
Despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential
efﬁcacy of ED prevention, more evidence synthesis is
needed,24,25 since the state of the art for evidence on inter-
ventions to prevent or delay ED onset seems to be rela-
tively less explored than in other ﬁelds of psychiatry.26,27
Although the prevention of mental disorders, particularly
psychosis, is being explored, it has only been partially
implemented worldwide. The results so far have shown
that the pre-assessment of risk should be improved to ﬁnd
subjects actually at risk of developing mental disorders.28-32
Since preventive interventions are not free from potential
side effects, they must be performed only for individuals
with an epidemiologically and clinically signiﬁcant risk of
any mental illness.33 Putative risk factors, whose associa-
tions have been inﬂated by biased results, must be replaced
with convincing ones, as is being done for several other
mental disorders, including schizophrenia,34,35 autism,36,37
depression,38 bipolar disorder,39 post-traumatic stress
disorder,40 anxiety spectrum disorder and obsessive com-
pulsive disorder.41 This a necessary step for ﬁnding indi-
viduals who might be at risk of ED and could thus beneﬁt
from preventive interventions.

Therefore,

the aim of

the present umbrella review,
which graded evidence through a systematic review of
meta-analyses, identiﬁed quantitative criteria based on
additional statistical tests, and re-calculated each meta-
analytic association, was to grade the available evidence
on risk factors for ED, identifying those that should be
targeted in ED prevention and considered when assess-
ing a person with subthreshold symptoms.

Methods

A protocol for this study is publicly available on the Center
for Open Science platform (https://osf.io/hu8yd/?view_
only=269352b4b1e040bcb825f48b567032a4). We per-
formed a systematic review, considering the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses42 and the Meta-analysis of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.43

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched the PubMed, PsycInfo and Embase data-
bases (ﬁnal search on December 11th, 2019) to identify
systematic reviews with meta-analyses pooling longitudinal

observational studies that examined any association
between putative risk factors for ED, deﬁned according to
clinical records, any version of the DSM or ICD, or vali-
dated scales with cut-off points. The following keywords
were used in PubMed (meta-analysis OR meta-analysis
OR systematic review) AND (anorexia nervosa OR binge*
OR bulimi* OR eating disorder*), and equivalent ones were
used in PsycInfo and Embase. Two reviewers (DM, DB)
independently searched the titles/abstracts for eligibility
and assessed the full
text of articles that passed this
phase. A third reviewer (MS) resolved any conﬂicts. When
more than one meta-analysis assessed the same risk
factor, we only included the one with the most studies, as
previously described.34,38,39,44,45 The exclusion criteria
were: 1) meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials; 2)
those published in languages other than English; 3) those
that included cross-sectional studies from which no causal
inference could be made; 4) systematic reviews without
meta-analyses.

The same two investigators who independently per-
formed the screening extracted the data in a predeﬁned
Excel spreadsheet. For each meta-analysis, we extracted
the PMID/DOI, ﬁrst author, publication year, population,
risk factor, study design, ED type (AN, BN, BED, or mixed),
number of included studies and total sample size to identify
the largest meta-analysis. For each primary study in the
largest meta-analyses, we recorded data on the ﬁrst
author, year of publication, study design, number of cases
(subjects who developed ED), subjects who did not deve-
lop ED, effect size with 95% conﬁdence intervals (95%CI),
ED deﬁnition criteria, and study location. The methodolo-
gical quality of each included meta-analysis was assessed
with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews
(AMSTAR) 2 tool (a recent update of AMSTAR,46 avail-
able at https://amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php) by the same two
investigators.

Data analysis

For each association in each meta-analysis, we re-
performed a random-effect meta-analysis that calculated
the pooled effect size and the 95% conﬁdence intervals.47
Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic.48 We
calculated the 95% prediction intervals for the summary
random effect sizes, which provide the possible range in
which the effect sizes of future studies are expected to
fall.49 We also tested for the presence of small-study
effect bias,38,39,44,50 which was deemed to be present in
cases of pooled estimates larger than the largest indi-
vidual study, as well as publication bias (Egger’s regres-
sion asymmetry test [p p 0.10]). Finally, we assessed
the
excess signiﬁcance bias by evaluating whether
observed number of studies with nominally statistically
signiﬁcant results (p p 0.05) were different
from the
expected number of studies with statistically signiﬁcant
results (signiﬁcance threshold set at p p 0.10).51,52

umbrella reviews.38,39,44,50,53 In brief, associations that
presented nominally signiﬁcant random-effects summary
effect sizes (i.e., p o 0.05) were ranked as convincing,
highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak evidence based
on the number of events, the strength of the association,
and the presence of several biases (criteria presented
in Box 1). The quality of
included meta-analyses was
assessed with the AMSTAR-2 tool.

Results

Search

A ﬂowchart of the search, selection and inclusion process
is presented in Figure 1. Out of 2,197 articles screened at
the title/abstract level, we assessed the full text of 45
publications. Of these, 36 were excluded for including
only cross-sectional studies (n=26), not conducting a
meta-analysis of risk factors for ED (n=4), not being the
focusing on ED as
largest meta-analysis (n=3), not
deﬁned according to the inclusion criteria of the present
umbrella review (n=2), or performing a pooled, rather than
a meta-analysis (n=1). A reference list of the 36 excluded
articles is provided in Table S1, available as online-only
supplementary material. Nine meta-analyses were ulti-
mately included, providing evidence on 49 risk factors from
a total of 29,272 individuals with ED and 1,679,385 controls.

Grading the evidence

The evidence grade for ED risk factors is reported in
Table 1. Nine meta-analyses11,12,54-60 investigated a wide
range of risk factors for ED. Early menarche was investi-
gated in one meta-analysis, peripartum events were
investigated in four (APGAR score, C-section, vaginal
instrumental delivery, and gestational age lower than
37 weeks), pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions
were investigated in seven (attention deﬁcit and hyper-
activity disorder, substance use, type I diabetes), initial
psychological features and BMI at baseline assessment in
longitudinal studies were investigated in nine, and the

remaining investigated risk factors were lifetime or child-
hood traumatic events or physical, emotional, sexual
abuse.

Overall, no association was supported by convincing
evidence. Highly suggestive evidence supported the
association between childhood sexual abuse and BN
(k = 29, 1,103 ED cases, 8,496 controls, OR, 2.73, 95%CI
1.96-3.79, p = 2.1 x 10-9, AMSTAR-2 moderate quality)54
and between appearance-related teasing victimization
and any ED (k = 10, 1,341 ED cases, 3,295 controls, OR
2.91, 95%CI 2.05-4.12, p = 1.8 x 10-9, AMSTAR-2
moderate quality).57 Suggestive, weak, or no evidence
was provided for 10, 29, and 8 risk factor, respectively.
More speciﬁcally, the 12 meta-analyses that investigated
risk factors for AN had the lowest evidence among all ED
(one provided suggestive evidence, seven provided weak
evidence, and four provided no evidence). Ten meta-
analyses investigated risk factors for BED (three provided
suggestive evidence and seven provided weak evidence).
Ten meta-analyses investigated BN (one provided highly
suggestive evidence, one provided suggestive evidence,
and eight provided weak evidence). The remaining 17
meta-analyses investigated risk factors for any ED (one
provided highly suggestive evidence, ﬁve provided
suggestive evidence, seven provided weak evidence,
and four provided no evidence). The median number of
studies per meta-analysis was 32 (interquartile range
[IQR] 17-82). The median number of ED cases per risk
factor was 514 (IQR 196-1,103), and the median total
population was 3,147 (IQR 993-8,478).

Detailed sources of bias are reported in Table 2 for all
signiﬁcant associations. Overall, the following bias pattern
emerged: associations based on evidence from at least
1,000 subjects with ED (18%), 95% prediction intervals
excluding the null value (18%), small study effect absent
(72%), excess signiﬁcance bias absent (60%), low overall
heterogeneity of associations (8% with signiﬁcant hetero-
the largest study (68%), and
geneity), signiﬁcance of
publication bias (70%). The quality of
included meta-
analyses was high for one,60 critically low for one,59 and
moderate for the reaming seven.

Discussion

This is the ﬁrst comprehensive umbrella review of meta-
analyses on risk factors for ED, which goes beyond mere
pooling of available meta-analyses by including additional
stringent statistical tests and evidence grading based on
quantitative criteria. This review included 50 associations
from nine meta-analyses, showing a lack of convincing
evidence supporting all ED risk factors. Highly suggestive
evidence was found for childhood sexual abuse as risk
factor for BN and appearance-related teasing victimiza-
tion for any ED.

These results can advance clinical knowledge in the
ﬁeld of ED on various points. First, none of the putative
risk factors for ED are supported by convincing evidence,
and several types of bias may have inﬂated the estimates
reported in meta-analyses. This is particularly concerning
when we compare the evidence of risk factors for ED with
the evidence of risk factors for schizophrenia34,35 (seven
factors overall supported by convincing evidence), aut-
ism36,37 (seven factors), depression38 (eight factors), bipo-
lar disorder39 (one factor), post-traumatic stress disorder40
(three factors), and anxiety spectrum disorder and obses-
sive compulsive disorder41 (one). Environmental factors

play an important role in the pathogenesis of mental
disorders, while genetic predisposition still explains only a
very small portion of the risk of schizophrenia, depressive
disorders, bipolar disorders.61 The lack of established risk
factors for ED may be due to limited research in this ﬁeld
or to the heterogeneity of the clinical pictures, which have
common characteristics and frequent overlap with other
mental disorders. There are common general psycho-
pathologic features in ED (e.g., depressive, anxious,
obsessive-compulsive), as well as feelings of ineffective-
ness and interpersonal sensitivity, which appear to be
even more central
than behavioral and speciﬁc psy-
chopathologies.62 This could reduce the speciﬁcity of risk
factors.

Second, while a number of mental disorders have speci-
ﬁc risk factors, such as high clinical risk for psychosis,34 or
irritable bowel syndrome for bipolar disorder,39 the risk
factors for ED found in the present review appear to be
relatively unspeciﬁc. For example, childhood sexual abuse
has been connected with a number of adverse health
outcomes, including borderline personality disorder, anxi-
ety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis,
and non-suicidal self-injury, in addition to pain, risky sexual
behavior, obesity, and HIV infection.63 This is not surprising,

Umbrella review risk eating disorders

321

given that child abuse is a risk factor for general psycho-
pathology64 and that the effect of sexual abuse on ED
psychopathology is probably mediated by ineffectiveness,
which is present beyond ED.65 The transdiagnostic nature
of these risk factors is relatively underexplored but could,
at least theoretically, allow transdiagnostic early detection
and intervention for these disorders.66,67 To the best of
our knowledge, only one pooled analysis of follow-up data
from three randomized controlled trials on ED preven-
tion has focused on a high-risk population with body
dissatisfaction, ﬁnding that negative affect and low BMI
predicted AN, elevated body dissatisfaction, overeating,
and fasting predicted BN, and elevated body dissatisfac-
tion, overeating, and functional
impairment predicted
BED.68 However, such ﬁndings have not yet been repli-
cated in larger cohort studies and have not been pooled in
meta-analyses accounting for random error and hetero-
geneity across studies. Moreover, one more reason for
the lack of evidence about risk factors for ED might be
explained by a recent large GWAS study, which included
16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525 controls,
ﬁnding that eight loci linked to other psychiatric disorders,
physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid
and anthropometric traits (independent of the effects of
common variants associated with body-mass index) were
associated with a higher risk of AN.21 Such results might
suggest that some genetic risk is shared with other psy-
chiatric conditions, but that there are also speciﬁc meta-
bolic pathways for AN that should be investigated in
greater detail. However, an overlap between mental and
physical disorders is also present in other mental disorders.69
Third, we found that the least evidence is available for
AN, which is, on the other hand, the most severe ED in
terms of clinical outcome, medical complications, and
survival. Fourth, the lack of clear evidence supporting the
identiﬁcation of ED risk factors, especially for AN, is highly
relevant in the light of the need for early ED detection as a
crucial component in improving ED treatment efﬁcacy.
Some authors70 have proposed a staging model for AN
that shows poorer outcomes with illness progression. In
line with this framework, the NICE (2010) ED guidelines
recommend that treatment should begin at the earliest
opportunity to avoid the additional effects of chronicity,
psychiatric comorbidity, and complications from malnutri-
tion.71 Promoting mental health, a complementary strat-
egy for preventing mental disorders, is particularly needed
in young populations, such as those at risk of developing
ED.72

Appearance-related teasing victimization was identiﬁed
as a risk factor for any ED, with highly suggestive, but not
convincing, evidence. This conﬁrms that
interpersonal
and social functioning might be a risk factor for ED, which
was suggested in a systematic review73 that highlighted
the role of interpersonal issues as a factor in ED onset. In
addition, this ﬁnding conﬁrms that emotional abuse in
childhood and adolescence, which consists of humiliating
and demeaning experiences, is the form of abuse most
directly associated with ED psychopathology, indepen-
dent of other psychiatric comorbidities.74

The strength of the present study is that it is the ﬁrst
umbrella review to demonstrate that no convincing

evidence supports any ED risk factor. Moreover,
it
provides methodological direction for future studies, i.e.,
a focus on high quality evidence about ED risk factors,
such as large-scale collaborative studies, harmonizing
measurements, and data sharing to bridge the gap with
prevention strategies implemented in other areas of psy-
chiatry. Finally, the focus of collaborative studies should
be on metabolic pathways, which were associated with
AN in a large recent GWAS study. Thus, leading centers
involved clinical research on ED should plan large multi-
center longitudinal cohort studies investigating the role of
putative risk factors for ED,
focusing on metabolic
pathways, which have been completely neglected to date.
The main limitation of the present study is that only one
of the included meta-analyses met high quality criteria
according to the AMSTAR-2 checklist. Furthermore, the
lack of evidence for speciﬁc risk factors could be related
to the paucity of
large-scale collaborative longitudinal
studies assessing the role of moderating mechanisms in
the relationship between conditions preceding the onset
of the disorder and the development of ED psychopathol-
ogy.75 Finally, factors not included in meta-analyses are
not considered in umbrella reviews.

In conclusion, no ED risk factor is supported by con-
vincing evidence. The ﬁeld of ED is being left behind with
respect to the preliminary evidence necessary to begin
implementing targeted preventive interventions for indivi-
duals with subthreshold symptoms. More multi-center
longitudinal cohort studies are needed to identify modiﬁ-
able risk factors for ED, including the metabolic factors
suggested by a recent large-scale GWAS study.21
