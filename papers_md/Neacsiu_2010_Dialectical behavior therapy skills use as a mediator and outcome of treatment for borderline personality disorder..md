Abstract

A central component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the teaching of specific behavioral
skills with the aim of helping individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) replace
maladaptive behaviors with skillful behavior. Although existing evidence indirectly supports this
proposed mechanism of action, no study to date has directly tested it. Therefore, we examined the
skills use of 108 women with BPD participating in one of three randomized control trials
throughout one year of treatment and four months of follow-up. Using a hierarchical linear
modeling approach we found that although all participants reported using some DBT skills before
treatment started, participants treated with DBT reported using three times more skills at the end
of treatment than participants treated with a control treatment. Significant mediation effects also
indicated that DBT skills use fully mediated the decrease in suicide attempts and depression and
the increase in control of anger over time. DBT skills use also partially mediated the decrease of
nonsuicidal self-injury over time. Anger suppression and expression were not mediated. This
study is the first to clearly support the skills deficit model for BPD by indicating that increasing
skills use is a mechanism of change for suicidal behavior, depression, and anger control.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral treatment program originally
developed to treat suicidal individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The
model of BPD that informs DBT suggests that: 1) BPD is a disorder of emotion
dysregulation stemming from important deficits in interpersonal, emotion-regulation
(including regulation of mood dependent behaviors), and distress tolerance skills, 2)
adaptive behavioral skills that individuals do have in their repertoire are often inhibited or
interfered with by maladaptive behavior, and 3) maladaptive behaviors (that constitute many
of the criteria of BPD) such as suicidal behaviors or other impulsive behaviors are

strengthened through processes of reinforcement. For example, suicidal behavior is viewed
as maladaptive problem-solving behavior resulting from a deficit in alternative, adaptive
problem solving skills and is reinforced by either an immediate reduction in emotional
arousal and/or by the environment's response (Linehan, 1993a). Thus, DBT focuses on
teaching new behavioral skills and facilitating the replacement of maladaptive behaviors
with skillful behavior.

A growing body of research on individuals with BPD supports the DBT skills deficit model.
Evidence suggests that BPD individuals experience difficulties in emotion regulation
(Linehan, Bohus, & Lynch, 2007), interpersonal relationships (Kremers, Spinhoven, Van der
Does, & Van Dyck, 2006), and distress tolerance (Gratz, Rosenthal, Tull, Lejuez, &
Gunderson, 2006). Furthermore, suicidal BPD individuals often report that suicidal
behaviors function to relieve negative emotions (Brown, Comtois, & Linehan, 2002).
Intense negative emotions, and the inability to modulate them, are important precipitators in
self-injurious behavior (Nixon, Cloutier, & Aggarwal, 2002). In addition, imagery of both
self-injurious and suicidal behaviors are associated with immediate reductions in
physiological and subjective measures of negative emotions (Welch, Linehan, Sylvers,
Chittams, & Rizvi, 2008).

Additional support for the model comes from evidence suggesting that DBT is an
efficacious intervention in reducing suicidal behavior and emotional problems in individuals
with BPD. DBT treatment, which includes weekly behavioral skills training, has been shown
effective across a wide variety of behavioral outcomes, including suicidal behavior, and
emotional distress indicators such as depression and anger (Lynch, Trost, Salsman &
Linehan, 2007a). With highly suicidal BPD clients, DBT has been shown effective in two
randomized control trials (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991; Linehan et
al., 2006a). Compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) and treatment by community experts
(TBE), DBT participants were significantly less likely to attempt suicide or self-injure, had
less medically severe intentional self-injury episodes over the year, lower treatment drop-
out, tended to enter psychiatric units less often and had fewer inpatient psychiatric days
(Linehan, et al., 1991; Linehan et al., 2006a). McMain and colleagues (2009) also compared
DBT with medication tapering to general psychiatric management (psychodynamic therapy,
symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy, and suicide risk management) for highly suicidal BPD
clients. They found significant reductions following treatment in suicidal behavior, health
care utilization, depression, borderline psychopathology and anger, but no difference
between the two conditions. Treatment gains were also maintained throughout one year of
follow up for both groups. Among less severe patients (i.e., those with suicide risk but not
necessarily a recent history of self-inflicted injury), DBT reduces anger (Linehan et al.,
2008), suicide ideation, hopelessness, and depression (Koons et al., 2001; Lynch, Morse,
Mendelson, & Robins, 2003; Verheul et al., 2003).

Furthermore, DBT skills training alone appears to be an effective intervention. Koons and
colleagues (2006) provided only skills training to a group of 12 BPD participants. The eight
completers improved significantly from pretreatment to six months follow-up on anger
expression, control of anger expression, work role satisfaction, and on number of hours
worked weekly (Koons et al., 2006). Miller and colleagues (2000) interviewed suicidal
adolescents with BPD features undergoing DBT on the usefulness of skills training. Mean
subject ratings for each skill module suggested a high perceived efficacy of DBT skills
(Miller, Wyman, Huppert, Glassman, & Rathus, 2000).

In other populations, DBT skills training alone was a feasible treatment for oppositional-
defiant adolescents (Nelson-Gray et al., 2006), adult ADHD patients (Hesslinger et al.,
2002), treatment resistant major depressive disorder (Harley, Sprich, Safren, Jacobo, &

Fava, 2008), women with binge eating disorder (Telch, Agras, & Linehan, 2000), difficult to
manage correctional populations (Shelton, Sampl, Kesten, Zhang, & Trestman, 2009) and
families of suicidal patients (Rajalin, Wickholm-Pethrus, Hursti, & Jokinen, 2009). DBT-
skills-only outperformed standard group therapy in improving drop-out, depression, anger
and affect instability among BPD clients (Soller et al., 2009). Lastly, a DBT skills only
program, modified for a group of women who were victims of domestic abuse, yielded a
reduction in depression, hopelessness and general distress (Iverson, Shenk, & Fruzzetti,
2009).

Despite this growing body of evidence, no study to date has examined whether DBT skills
use is indeed one of the mechanisms of change associated with treatment efficacy.
Relatedly, two studies have examined the frequency of skills practice in DBT. Lindenboim,
Comtois, and Linehan (2007) and Stepp and colleagues (2008) used DBT diary cards, a
daily self-monitoring record on which clients were asked to circle the skills that they
practiced on any given day, as the measure of frequency of skills used. Use of skills was
assessed every week throughout one year of treatment. Both groups reported that
participants in DBT practiced increasingly more skills over time (Lindenboim, Comtois, &
Linehan, 2007; Stepp, Epler, Jahng, & Trull, 2008). However, neither of these studies
examined whether increase in skills use has an effect on treatment outcome.

The present study had two aims. The first aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of DBT
versus control treatments in increasing DBT skills use. We hypothesized that DBT would
increase behavioral skills use significantly more than control treatments. The second aim
was to determine whether DBT skills use mediated primary treatment outcomes of suicide
attempts, non-suicidal self-injury, anger, and depression. Based on the DBT skills deficit
model, we hypothesized that DBT skills use would fully mediate changes in suicidal
behavior (suicide attempts and self inflicted injury) and in indicators of emotional distress
(anger and depression).

Method

Participants & Procedure

Participants for the current study were drawn from three larger outcome studies on DBT in
which DBT skills use was measured. Participants included 63 recurrently suicidal BPD
women (Linehan et al., 2006a) and 45 BPD women with drug dependence (Linehan et al.,
1999; Linehan et al., 2002) for a total of 108 women with BPD. Demographic information is
provided in Table 1. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics
between the suicidal group and the drug dependent group.

Participants met criteria for BPD on both the International Personality Disorders
Examination (Loranger, 1995) and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II
Personality Disorders (First, Spitzer, Gibbons, Williams, & Benjamin, 1996). Exclusion
criteria included any psychotic disorder, epilepsy or other severe seizure disorder requiring
antiseizure medications, other additional problems requiring immediate attention, or court
referral. The most prevalent co-occurring Axis I disorders were major depression (60.2%),
substance dependence (55.6%), PTSD (41.7%), panic disorder (26.9%), and social phobia
(14.8%). See Table 1 for participant characteristics per treatment condition.

In each of the larger studies, participants provided informed consent and were randomly
assigned to a treatment condition. Participants were placed in either a DBT condition (n=52)
or one of three control treatments: community treatment by experts (CTBE; n=31) –
community-based non-behavioral treatment by therapists nominated as experts in treating
difficult clients (see Linehan, et al., 2006a for a more detailed description), treatment as

usual (TAU, n=11; see Linehan, et al., 1999 for a more detailed description), or
comprehensive validation therapy in conjunction with a 12 step program (CVT+12 Step,
n=12; see Linehan et al., 2002 for a detailed description). All participants were assigned to
one year of treatment, and completed assessments at pretreatment and then every four
months including a four month follow-up (at pretreatment, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months,
and four months after treatment ended—at 16 months). Study measures were administered at
each assessment point by trained assessors, blind to the study condition.

DBT Ways of Coping Checklist (DBT-WCCL)—The DBT-WCCL is an adaptation of
the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist (RWCCL; Vitaliano, Russo, Carr, Maiuro, & Becker,
1985) that includes additional items intended to represent DBT skills (Neacsiu, Rizvi,
Vitaliano, Lynch, & Linehan, 2010). The DBT-WCCL, a self-report questionnaire, has 38
items measuring frequency of DBT skills use over the previous month and 21 items
measuring dysfunctional, non-DBT coping strategies. In order to avoid potential response
bias, DBT language and terms that would resemble skills training or use are avoided in this
scale. Rather, a more general description of skillful behavior is used (e.g., instead of “used
GIVE skills”. “Made sure I'm responding in a way that doesn't alienate others”). Further, the
title “DBT-WCCL” was not included on the questionnaire nor was there any indication that
the questionnaire referred to the skills they learned in DBT, but rather asked about ways in
which they have coped with stressful events. In the current study, only the subscale
measuring DBT skills use was examined. All items, are rated from 0 to 3 (“never use” to
“always use”) and the DBT skills use index was computed by averaging across all items in
the scale.

Previous examination of the psychometric properties of the DBT-WCCL in BPD individuals
revealed that the DBT Skills Subscale of the DBT-WCCL (DSS) had excellent internal
consistency (Cronbach α=0.92 to 0.96; n=316). Test-retest reliability at 4 months for 119
BPD individuals treated without access to skills training was acceptable, (ρI = 0.71, p
<0.001). In addition, individuals who received skills training had significantly higher scores
after four months of treatment than individuals who did not receive skills training (Neacsiu
et al., 2010).

Suicide Attempt and Self Injury Interview (SASII)—The SASII (Linehan, Comtois,
Brown, Heard, & Wagner, 2006b) is a semi-structured interview that assesses the factors
involved in non-fatal suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury. For the present study,
two variables were used: number of suicide attempts (including attempts with ambivalent
intent) and number of nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) episodes since the previous assessment.
Both variables were highly skewed and clustered; therefore they were transformed into
binary variables: attempts (none versus any) and NSSI episodes (none versus any). The
SASII has been shown to have very good inter-rater reliability and adequate validity
(Linehan et al., 2006b).

Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)—The 17-item HRSD (Hamilton,
1960) is an interviewer-rated scale which has been widely used in clinical research. The
interview assesses cognitive and melancholic symptoms, and uses standard prompt questions
for each rating. Inter-rater reliability has been found to range from 0.82 and 0.96, with an
intraclass r ranging from 0.46 to 0.99. Test-retest reliability ranged from 0.81 to 0.98
(Bagby, Ryder, Schuller, & Marshall, 2004).

State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI)—The STAXI (Spielberger, 1988) is
a widely used self-report measure for anger. The questionnaire has four subscales which

measure the disposition to experience anger (Anger Trait), the frequency with which anger
is both suppressed (Anger In) and expressed (Anger Out), and the amount of control over
the anger attempted by the participant (Anger Control; Spielberger, 1988). In this study, we
used Anger Out, Anger In and Anger Control as indicators of anger throughout the
treatment. Anger trait was not used because it is considered a stable personality
characteristic of the individual and therefore not as amenable to change as a target of
treatment. Internal consistency of the scales is reported to range between 0.73 and 0.93, and
construct validity was demonstrated through associations between each scales and responses
to anger scenarios (Spielberger, 1988).

Data Analysis

A mixed-effects models approach was used to analyze the repeated measures data (pre-
treatment through the 16-month assessment (Longford, 1993). Appropriate covariance
structures were analytically determined based on a comparing model fit criteria such as
Restricted Maximum likelihood (REML) estimate, Akaike Information criteria (AIC), and
the Akaike Information corrected criteria (AICC) in comparing nested models (Verbeke,
1997). As a result, a hierarchical linear modeling approach (HLM; Bryk & Raudenbush,
1992) was chosen. First, we assessed whether the three control conditions had differential
effects on skills use. Second, differences in rates of change in DBT skills use (i.e., the slopes
of the subject-specific regression lines) were compared for the two treatment groups: DBT
and control conditions (TAU+CVS+TBE).

To examine mediation within the context of multi-level models, the procedure outlined by
Krull and MacKinnon (2001) was followed. In order to preserve a temporal connection
(Kraemer, Wilson, Fairburn, & Agras, 2002), the mediator introduced in equations was DBT
skills use at the previous time point. According to Baron and Kenny (1986) and Krull and
MacKinnon (2001), three criteria must be met to support full mediation. First, the
independent variable needs to be significantly related to the mediator (DBT skills use at time
point t-1). Second, the independent variable must significantly predict the outcome variable
(e.g., anger at time point t). Third, for full mediation, the relationship between independent
variable and outcome must disappear when the mediator is introduced into the equation. If
after introducing the mediator into the equation, the coefficient between the independent
variable and outcome remains significant but is reduced, there is evidence for partial
mediation.

We hypothesized that DBT skills use, as a proxy for skillful behavior, would mediate
treatment outcomes in general, and not only in DBT. Doss and Atkins (2006) highlighted
that when treatment condition is included in the mediation, what is measured is the effect on
outcome of the difference of two treatments, and not necessarily the effect of interventions
on outcome. Many of the DBT skills were derived from behavioral assignments and
suggested client practices in other treatments (Linehan, 1993b) and therefore, skills use may
occur despite explicit skills training. Thus, the hypothesis of the importance of skills use in
the change of outcome variables is better examined as a nonspecific predictor of outcome by
constructing the mediation model around the significance of the time effect in predicting the
mediator and outcome. In our analyses, therefore, the independent variable was time in
treatment and not type of treatment. Nevertheless, because the total sample included the
participants from three different studies, we added a categorical variable, “study,” as a
covariate to our mediation analyses. This addition was made to address the unique sources
of variation from each original study that could confound the mediation findings.

The mediation effect was computed by multiplying the path coefficient between the
independent variable and the mediator (α) by the path coefficient between the mediator and

2 is the square of the standard error of α (Krull & MacKinnon,

Recent work by Shrout and Bolger (2002) and Preacher and Hayes (2004) has shown that
the classical test statistic for mediation has lower power. Therefore, they recommended the
use of bootstraps to test mediation. To increase the power of our analysis we therefore used
the bootstrap approach by treating the complete mediation data set as if it were a population.
From this dataset, 999 bootstrap samples were repeatedly created using replacements from
the original data set. Because this technique was applied as part of a longitudinal framework,
we followed Chernick's (1999) recommendations and used case resampling through
selecting a subject's entire data collection if the participant was selected as part of the
bootstrap sample. Within each bootstrap sample we derived its mediation effect. Therefore,
the final mediation effect (for the original data set) and its standard error were computed
using the bootstrapping approach as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of
the mediation effects over the bootstrap samples. To further assess the statistical significance
of the effect, we derived the empirical 95% confidence interval for the mediation effects,
which corresponded to the 2.5% and 97.5% observed values. Confidence intervals including
0 indicated a mediation effect that was not statistically significant.

For each of the equations used in the mediation analyses, the mixed-effects models approach
(Longford, 1993) was used for normally distributed outcomes (depression and anger) and a
generalized estimating equation analysis (GEE; Liang & Zeger, 1986) was used for
outcomes that were infrequent and highly skewed (suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self
injury). In the latter case, variables were recoded into binary variables (none versus any) and
pretreatment values were used as a covariate.

Missing data imputations were not specified in either the HLM or the GEE models. A
restricted estimated maximum likelihood (REML) model was used for HLM analyses,
which accounts for the missing data. In this approach, time is treated as a continuous
variable, and a regression line is modeled for each participant based on the number of
available points. The model does not assume each outcome to be measured on the same
number of points and therefore any time point sampling is relevant to the regression line the
model creates. Thus, subjects with missing data are still modeled using the data points they
do have. (Schafer & Graham, 2002; Gibbons, Hedeker, & DuToit, 2010). GEE assumes that
if there is missing data, it is missing completely at random (MCAR). The analysis computes
the marginal means of the available data, even if it has missing points. Standard errors (SEs)
are adjusted as part of the model to accommodate for the amount of independent information
that is entered in the model. Therefore, if a subject with missing data is entered, SE may be
inflated to account for this difference (Gibbons, Hedeker, & DuToit, 2010).

While the modeling approaches accommodate “missing data”, we implemented pattern-
mixture models (Hedeker & Gibbons, 1997) to assess whether important mediations
estimates per the HLM and GEE models were dependent on missing data patterns (Hamer &
Simpson, 2009). To determine whether mediation effects were driven by informative
missing data patterns, we classified two monotonic patterns of patients' available data
(treatment completers versus treatment drop outs) and assessed the interaction of pattern
with the mediation effect in our analyses.

Results

DBT Skills Use as an Outcome of Treatment

Page 7

To assess the hypothesis that DBT would increase behavioral skills use significantly more
than control treatments, participants who received DBT were compared to participants in the
three control conditions. In order to determine whether control conditions had differential
effects on skills use, or whether we could combine them into one control group, an HLM
analysis was conducted assessing the interaction between time and each control condition in
predicting skills use. The analysis revealed a nonsignificant effect for condition (F(2,
217.49)=0.51, p=0.60) and a nonsignificant interaction between time in treatment and
control condition (F(2, 76.31)=0.83, p=0.44). All control conditions had similar effects on
variations of skills use over time and therefore were combined into one control condition for
the rest of the analyses. Thus, in describing the rest of the results, “treatment condition”
refers to DBT versus control treatment.

HLM analyses revealed a significant interaction between time and treatment condition in
predicting DBT skills use (F (1, 90.85) = 26.41, p<0.001). Specifically, clients in DBT
reported higher DBT skills use than clients in the control conditions over time (see Figure
1). Furthermore, participants in the control conditions did not change over time in their DBT
skills use. The DBT slope estimate was 0.13 (SD=0.02), which was significant,
t(90.61)=7.11, at the 0.001 level; the control treatment slope estimate was −0.004
(SD=0.02), which was not significant, t(91.05)=−0.23.

At pretreatment, the mean score for all participants on the DBT-WCCL was 1.48 (SD=0.48;
range=0.29 to 2.63). At the end of the treatment year, participants in the DBT condition
increased in their mean DBT skills use from 1.43 to 1.89 (a 15.33% increase), while
participants in the control conditions increased from 1.53 to 1.67 (a 4.66% increase). Four
months after treatment ended, participants in the DBT condition remained at the same level
of DBT skills as at the end of their treatment year, while participants in the control condition
dropped from 1.67 to 1.52 (a 5.00% decrease).

DBT Skills Use as Mediator of Outcome

To assess the hypothesis that DBT skills use would fully mediate changes in primary
outcomes, data from the four treatment conditions were combined. The fact that DBT skills
use was seen across treatment conditions at pretreatment strengthened the theoretical
decision to examine mediation over time, not by treatment condition. In addition, including
all data allowed for sufficient number of data points as well as sufficient variation in the
DBT skills use at each time point. Although the participants in the control condition, on
average, stayed the same throughout treatment, 24 control participants had higher scores and
16 had lower scores at the end of treatment when compared to pretreatment, suggesting that
there was indeed variability in skills use in this group. Mediation analyses were then
conducted for each of the following four outcomes: suicidal behavior, nonsuicidal self-
injury, anger, and depression. The independent variable used was time in treatment, and the
mediator was the DBT-WCCL skills subscale score assessed at the previous time point.
Bootstrapping was used to compute a more robust mediation effect as well as confidence

Significance for the mediation effect was concluded if the confidence interval computed for

was implemented. GEE analyses predicting the likelihood of no suicide attempt/NSSI
episode to occur were conducted to assess mediation.

A significant mediation effect indicated that an increase in the DBT skills use fully mediated
the relationship between time in treatment and decrease in likelihood for suicide attempts to
occur (Table 2). When the mediator was added to the equation, the raw βc coefficient (of the
independent variable, time in treatment, predicting the dependent variable, likelihood of no
suicide attempt) dropped from 0.36, p<0.05 to 0.27, p=0.16. Significant mediation effect
also indicated that an increase in the DBT skills use partially mediated the increase in
likelihood of no NSSI episodes to occur over time in treatment (Table 2). In this analysis,
when the mediator was added to the equation, the raw βc coefficient (of the independent
variable, time in treatment, predicting the dependent variable, likelihood of no NSSI
episode) dropped from 0.41, p<0.001 to 0.34, p<0.01. The reverse models for both
likelihood of suicide attempts and likelihood of NSSI at the previous time point mediating
current use of skills were not significant (p>0.05). Furthermore, the pattern-mixture analyses
in which we assessed whether the interaction between the mediator and treatment drop
status, were non-significant in both models (p> 0.05).

DBT skills use as a mediator of improvements in anger

Anger variables were normally distributed and therefore a single-level HLM model was
used for each of the three mediation equations. These analyses indicated that the relationship
between time in treatment and increase in Anger Control was fully mediated by DBT skills
use (α and β paths in Table 2) when using a bootstrap approach and covarying the original
study from which the participant was sampled. The coefficient for time in treatment (βc)
predicting Anger Control outcome dropped from 0.57, p<0.001, when the mediator was not
part of the model, to 0.35, p>0.05 when the mediator was added to the model. The reverse
mediational model (Anger Control at the previous time point mediating current use of skills)
and the pattern mixture result (mediator * treatment drop status predicting anger control)
were not significant (p>0.05). Single-level mediation analyses indicated that the
relationships between time in treatment and Anger In or Anger Out were not mediated by
DBT skills use (see Table 2).

DBT skills use as a mediator of improvements in depression

The total score for depression was also normally distributed and therefore a single-level
HLM model was used for each of the three mediation equations. As shown in Table 2, the
analyses indicated that DBT skills use fully mediated improvements in depression over time
(α and β paths in Table 2) when using a bootstrap approach and covarying the original study
from which the participant was sampled. Although β was only significant at a trend level,
the confidence interval for the mediation effect indicated that the full mediation was
significant. The coefficient for time in treatment predicting depression (βc) dropped from
−0.91 (p<0.001), when the mediator was not part of the model, to −0.29, (p>0.05) when the
mediator was added to the model. The reverse mediational model (depression at the previous
time point mediating current use of skills) was not significant (p>0.05). Furthermore, the
pattern-mixture result assessing for a significant interaction between the mediator and data
missing because of subjects dropping treatment was non-significant (p> 0.05).

Discussion

The present study examined BPD individuals' DBT skills use throughout treatment, and its
relationship to primary outcome variables. Four main findings emerged. First, all
participants reported using at least some DBT skills about 50% of the time before treatment
started. Second, participants treated with DBT reported using skills throughout treatment

significantly more than participants in the control condition. Third, DBT skills use fully
mediated the likelihood of suicide attempts and partially mediated the likelihood of NSSI to
occur. Fourth, skills use fully mediated the change over time of certain indicators of
emotional distress (Anger Control and depression). These findings provide further validation
for the DBT model by indicating that an increase in DBT skills mediates some of the
outcomes reported in DBT RCTs (see Lynch, Trost, Salsman, & Linehan, 2007a).

Although DBT is based on the assumption that remediating skills deficits will drive a
decrease in maladaptive behavior, research thus far has at most indicated an association
between skills deficit change and maladaptive behavior change. This study is the first to
clearly support the skills deficit model for suicidal behavior in BPD by showing that
increasing skills use is a mechanism of change for suicide attempts. The partial mediation
found for nonsuicidal self injury partially supports the skills deficit model, and suggests that
additional factors may play into the change seen in this behavior throughout treatment. For
example, research indicates that thought suppression is a partial mediator for the relationship
between emotional reactivity and NSSI (Najmi, Wegner, & Nock, 2006) and is also
associated with self harm frequency (Chapman, Specht, & Cellucci, 2005). BPD treatments
may reduce thought suppression through at least directly assessing problems, which may in
turn influence the change seen in NSSI above and beyond skills use.

Skills use also fully mediated the decrease in depression over time. This finding is
compatible with the theory proposed by Jacobson, Martell, and Dimidijan (2001) who
suggested that the mechanism of change for depression is behavioral activation. DBT
conceptualizes the lack of behavioral activation as a skills deficit and therefore teaches
principles of behavioral activation within the emotion regulation module (Linehan, 1993b).
There have now been a number of studies that indicate DBT's efficacy in treating depression
(Harley et al., 2008; Lynch et al., 2003; Lynch et al., 2007b). Furthermore, an increase in
emotional processing was found to be related to a reduction in depression only for DBT
participants but not for control participants in a treatment resistant group with major
depression (Feldman et al., 2009). Thus, while DBT has been shown to be effective in
reducing depression in BPD and depression populations, the mechanism of change was to
date unclear. Our finding suggest that the use of DBT skills is an active ingredient behind
changes in depression.

Skills use also fully mediated the increase in anger control over time. The STAXI Anger
Control scale assesses how successful a person is in regulating cues that could trigger anger
and is very close to the anger regulation taught in the DBT emotion regulation module
(Linehan, 1993b). The full mediation of Anger Control improvement signals that skills
training may indeed help clients to better regulate the emotion of anger. Similar to
depression, prior studies have shown a positive effect of DBT treatment on anger
dysregulation (e.g., Linehan et al., 2008). This finding emphasizes that the mechanism of
change behind such findings may be use of DBT skills.

No evidence for mediation was found for changes in Anger In (anger suppression) or Anger
Out (anger expression) which may seem puzzling, especially in light of the other findings.
However, it is consistent with the DBT skills deficit model because the items in both scales
may refer to both functional (“I keep things in”; “I express my anger”) and dysfunctional (“I
pout or sulk”, “I do things like slam doors”) behaviors. In DBT skills training, clients learn
how to tolerate and problem-solve unjustified anger, how to accept justified anger, how to
stand up for themselves if needed, how to be mindful of the current emotion and how to
accurately express how they are feeling (Linehan, 1993b). Keeping anger to oneself may be
effective behavior (e.g., the individual is mindful of the emotion while aware that expressing
it may hurt a relationship) or a target for change (e.g., individual bottles up and explodes

periodically in rage attacks). Similarly, expressing anger may be a behavior to increase if
emotional numbness or lack of assertiveness is the problem behavior, or to decrease if anger
is not justified by the context and appears out of control. DBT skills are aimed at increasing
the client's effectiveness in handling inter- and intra- personal situations. The fact that the
Anger In and Out scales are not necessarily tied to effectiveness may explain the null
findings in this study.

In addition to the mediation findings, results also indicate that DBT is effective in teaching
DBT skills, which further supports the studies of Lindenboim and colleagues (2007) and
Stepp and colleagues (2008). Besides strengthening their finding that skills use increases
with the provision of DBT, this study further indicates that skills use increases more in DBT
than in other treatment conditions. Thus, being treated with DBT versus a control treatment
results in more skills used in distressing situations, even when DBT-specific language does
not confound measurment. Moreover, the fact that the change seen in DBT at the end of
treatment was maintained at the four month follow up (unlike in the control conditions) also
indicates that DBT is effective in ensuring that generalization of skills use occurs. The
important question that remains to be addressed is whether the increase in skills use is
particular to the DBT skills taught or whether it represents an increase in DBT skills and self
efficacy in general.

It is also interesting to note that when DBT skills were reframed into non-DBT specific
language, participants reported using some of the skills even before treatment started. While
some people reported using skills only a few times, the majority reported using DBT skills
about half the time at pretreatment. Also, skills use and not skills training mediated
treatment outcomes. This leads to important questions about whether skills training is the
most effective way to increase skills use, whether teaching all the skills is necessary for
successful DBT outcomes, or whether the skills training modules could be shortened to
incorporate only novel skills.

Although the results are generally supporting of the DBT model, several potential
limitations should be noted. Even though there is no reason to believe that there was a
systematic over-reporting or under-reporting of skill practice by the entire sample, it is
certainly possible that some individuals exhibited either the former or the latter tendency. In
a study comparing an assessment of retrospective coping over the past week using the
RWCCL and an abbreviated daily coping version, Smith, Leffingwell and Ptacek (1999)
reported that only 25% of the variance was shared between the retrospective account and the
modified daily version. Since the present analyses used an adapted version of the RWCCL
that was assessed over the previous month, retrospective bias may indeed be an important
flaw in data accuracy. However, since the statistical model used controls for intra-individual
factors, retrospective bias likely had a smaller effect since it can be expected that it did not
fluctuate over time within the same individual. A possible future improvement would be to
control for retrospective bias by using ambulatory monitoring and assessing DBT skills use
on a daily basis. An additional limitation was that the measure used a checklist format that
focused on how often a specific skill was practiced in particular distressing situation. The
format offered advantages since participants from both DBT and control treatments could
offer comparable information about their DBT skills use. Nevertheless, important
descriptors of the skills practice such as intensity of use, the appropriateness of the skill
used, and the quality of the skill used were not assessed.

It is important to also highlight the statistical approach we took to examine our hypotheses.
We considered skills use to be a universal treatment mechanism and assessed its impact on
the relationship between time in treatment and various outcomes. The DBT model could
have also been assessed using a moderated mediation statistical approach, in which

treatment condition (DBT or control) could have been considered the moderator and skills
use would have been the mediator (Kraemer et al., 2002). Our decision not to use a
moderated mediation approach was based on the fundamental question for the current study
being not whether DBT performs better than another treatment, but what processes drive
changes in suicidal behavior, depression and anger over time. Moderated mediation
investigates the mechanisms through which a treatment performs better than another, not
about the mechanism through which change happens over time in treatment in a clinical
population (Doss & Atkins, 2006). While DBT may have indeed targeted skills training
more explicitly, therapy in general targets engaging in effective behavior that leads to
change which is in essence skills use. In this regard using skills or using effective behaviors
in difficult situations can be thought as a universal mechanism of change in psychological
treatments. Illustrative of this, all clients used some skills before treatment started, and
varied in skills use throughout treatment, regardless of the treatment they were receiving.

Nevertheless, our approach has some limitations. First, it may be that skills use is a
mechanism of change unique to DBT. In this case, our analysis may underestimate the
mediation effect by adding data from treatments where this mechanism was not present.
Future analyses should investigate whether skills use is a universal or a unique mechanism
of change in treatment. Second, an assumption that is commonly made for standard
mediation analysis methods, such as the one used here, is that there is no extraneous variable
which influences both the mediator and the outcome (Robins and Rotnitzky, 2005). In the
case of our analysis, it is possible to have had unmeasured confounds influencing the results.
An interesting avenue for future research would also be to validate the DBT model using a
causal inferences approach, which would account for this limitation (MacKinnon et al.,
2007). Although there have been some examples of these models used in longitudinal data
(e.g., Lin et al., 2008), proper models to accommodate unmeasured confounds coupled with
repeated measures are an active area under current research.

An additionally important avenue for future research is therefore to replicate these findings
with different samples and statistical techniques. Furthermore, future research should also
assess how use of particular skills mediates outcomes that are directly targeted in skills
training. Some questions that could be answered from such research include: Does use of
emotion regulation skills actually improve emotion regulation? Are distress tolerance skills
and/or other skills responsible for the improvement in behavioral self-control seen in DBT?
Answers to these questions could lead to the refinement of DBT and other treatments to
maximize their effectiveness.

Figure 1.
Change in DBT Skills Use across Time in DBT and Control Treatment
Note: Treatment ended at 12 months. The 16 month assessment point is a follow up
assessment. Skills use was rated on a scale from 0 to 3, 0 denoting no skills use and 3
denoting using all the skills most of the time.

α is the coefficient of the independent variable (time in treatment) predicting the mediator (DBT skills use), β is the coefficient of the mediating
variable (DBT skills use at the previous time point) predicting the outcome variable when the independent variable (time in treatment) is also
included in the equation; Suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are binary variables, where 0 represents no suicide attempt/NSSI
episodes and 1 represents any suicide attempt/NSSI episode since the last assessment; the models for these variables predict the likelihood of no
suicide attempt/NSSI episode; confidence intervals are computed on the mediation effect using bootstrapping; confidence intervals containing 0 are
not statistically significant mediation effects.
