Background: Anxiety disorders are commonly diagnosed and cause substantial functional impairment. A mixture of pharmaco-
logic and psychosocial treatments currently exists, but these treatments are not always tolerable and effective. For patients with
anxiety resistant to standard therapy, psychedelics may be a promising alternative. This review assesses the therapeutic benefits
and safety of psychedelics in treating anxiety disorders.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL for clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with
clinician-diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, separation anxiety disorder, selective
mutism, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and anxiety attributable to another medical condition. We analyzed data from 9 indepen-
dent psychedelic-assisted trials testing ayahuasca (1 study), ketamine (4 studies), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (2 studies), 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (1 study), and psilocybin (1 study). Efficacy was assessed by measuring the change in
outcome measures and the quality of life from baseline.
Results: The reviewed studies demonstrated encouraging efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms, increasing self-perception, and
increasing social function in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or anxiety attributable to another
medical condition while establishing feasibility and evidence of safety. For many patients, the therapeutic effects of the psychedelic
treatment lasted weeks, and no severe adverse events were reported.
Conclusion: Based on the evidence of symptom reduction and safety, the current literature (2011 to 2021) shows that psychedelics
could be considered for treating clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorders. Psychedelics may provide an alternative therapeutic option
for patients resistant to current standard treatments.

INTRODUCTION

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psy-
chiatric disorders worldwide, causing significant impacts
on physical and emotional health and substantial func-
tional impairment.1,2 Approximately 33.7% of individuals in
the United States between the ages of 13 and 64 have
been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at some point
in their lives.3 In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
(DSM-
of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition, Text Revision)
5-TR), anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety dis-
order, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder,
selective mutism, specific phobia, panic disorder, agorapho-
bia, substance-/medication-induced anxiety disorder, anxi-
ety disorder attributable to another medical condition, other
specified anxiety disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder.4
Anxiety disorders are characterized by intense and exces-
sive fear and worry, as well as maladaptive behavioral
changes such as avoidance behavior.5,6 Patients with an
anxiety disorder can present with a wide range of cogni-

tive and somatic symptoms depending on the type of disor-
der, such as persistent fear about specific situations, nausea,
and palpitations.6 Symptoms can range in severity from mild
to severe and can cause significant functional impairment.

Anxiety disorders often have a substantial negative impact
on an individual’s quality of life.7 On a societal level, anxiety
disorders have an associated economic burden, as some
patients have difficulty working and effectively performing
in their jobs and may require mental health treatment and
services.8 A 1996 study conducted on the economic cost
of anxiety disorders using the human capital approach esti-
mated that the combined direct and indirect costs associ-
ated with anxiety disorders were $46.6 billion US dollars in
1990.9

The natural course of anxiety is akin to other chronic
medical
illnesses. Despite numerous available pharmaco-
logic and nonpharmacologic treatments, anxiety disorders
are often chronic, with fluctuating symptom severity.10,11
Complete remission is uncommon.10,11 Furthermore, anxiety

disorders are complicated by high comorbidity with other
psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder,1,12
and are often associated with a higher risk of medical comor-
bidities (including cardiovascular events) and poorer health
outcomes compared to the general population.13

Although pharmacologic agents and psychotherapies are
frequently used to treat anxiety disorders, these treatments
are not always tolerated or effective.14-16 While cognitive
behavioral therapy is considered an effective therapy for
anxiety disorders, some patients do not improve with treat-
ment, some are unwilling to participate, others do not have
access to a cognitive behavioral therapy–based therapist,
and some patients are unable to afford the therapy.14,17,18

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and sero-
tonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are
first-line pharmacologic agents for the treatment of anxiety
disorders,19 but some patients do not respond adequately to
treatment with these agents and may develop a treatment-
resistant anxiety disorder.14,20,21 SSRIs can take 4 to 6 weeks
to achieve symptom amelioration and often have significant
adverse effects, including withdrawal symptoms, nausea,
increased anxiety with initial use, sexual dysfunction, and
insomnia.15 These adverse reactions and delayed effects
often lead to nonadherence.22

Psychedelics are substances

that alter cognition,
mood, and sensory perception.23,24 Some plant-based
psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, peyote, and psilocybin,
are entheogens, psychoactive substances specifically used
in religious and spiritual contexts.25-27 Entheogens have
a long history; plant-based psychedelics have been used
worldwide for centuries for ritual and healing purposes.23,26
In modern Western civilization, however, the therapeutic use
of psychedelics began with the discovery of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) by chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz in
1943.28 Research into the therapeutic use of psychedelics
to treat psychiatric disorders bloomed in the United States
in the 1950s and 1960s, with numerous studies published
about their potential to treat a wide range of diagnoses
such as alcoholism, addiction, depression, and anxiety.29-31
Not only were psychedelics investigated for their thera-
peutic potential but also as a tool for understanding the
pathogenesis of psychiatric illnesses.30

The therapeutic use of psychedelics was principally inves-
tigated using 2 models: the psycholytic model and the
psychedelic model.30,32 The psycholytic model used several
low doses of psychedelics in combination with psychoan-
alytic therapy; the psychedelics were thought to enhance
the efficacy of psychotherapy by deepening the experience
and accessing the subconscious.30,32,33 The psychedelic
model used higher doses of psychedelics to induce a mys-
tical experience; this therapeutic use was commonly stud-
ied in patients with alcoholism.30,32,33 However, research
into psychedelic therapies slowed with the Controlled Sub-
stances Act of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven-
tion and Control Act of 1970.32 As a result, LSD and other
psychedelics became classified as Schedule 1 drugs, the
classification given to drugs that the US government con-
siders to lack an acceptable use in medicine and to have a
significant potential for harm and abuse.34

Further exploration of

the therapeutic and recre-
ational potential of psychedelics continued underground
despite the new regulations.35-37 Renewed interest in the

continuation of
legitimate psychedelic research began
with the development of modern neuroimaging techniques
and the enhanced understanding of the neurobiology of
psychiatric disorders.23,38 Since then, studies have been
conducted into the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile
of specific psychedelics for various conditions such as
anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, smoking,
and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.23
Many of these studies supported the efficacy of psychedelic
substances in improving symptoms and demonstrated that
the substances were generally well tolerated.23,32

term
psychedelics have a wide range of mechanisms of action.
Broadly speaking, classic psychedelics refer to substances
that produce their psychotropic effects primarily by acting
as agonists or partial agonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptors.39-41 However,
(serotonin)
psychedelics have also been shown to interact with other
receptors such as 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C.42 LSD,
psilocybin, ayahuasca (a plant-based decoction that con-
tains beta-carboline alkaloids and dimethyltryptamine),
mescaline, peyote (a cactus that contains mescaline),
and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B, a syn-
thetic drug similar in structure to mescaline) are all classic
psychedelics.43,44 These psychedelics can produce changes
in mood, thinking patterns, and sensory perception and can
cause visual and auditory hallucinations, dissociation, and
mystical experiences.41 The exact mechanism of how these
substances produce therapeutic effects for psychiatric dis-
orders remains unclear.29 Psychedelics may directly affect
neuronal connections and brain activity or exert effects as
an adjunct to traditional psychotherapy.29

Recent (2023) research performed on mice demonstrated
that psychedelics may produce a metaplastic change in the
brain.45 Metaplasticity is the extent to which synaptic plas-
ticity can be initiated.46 The induction of synaptic plasticity
suggests the ability to reopen the critical period of learn-
ing, allowing increased psychological flexibility and cogni-
tive reappraisal.45 These properties have been linked to suc-
cessful treatment of anxiety.46 Psychologically, psychedelics
have been demonstrated to work through ego dissolu-
tion, the separation of boundaries between the world and
oneself.47 After the onset of ego dissolution, psychedelic
experiences are thought to create personal insight through
introspection by removing mental hurdles and relaxing the
psychological or ego resistance.48,49 Allowing relaxation of
the maladaptive beliefs helps dissolve rigid and ingrained
patterns of thinking.49

Nonclassic psychedelics are other substances that can
alter cognition and sensory perception and produce a
psychedelic-like experience; this category includes 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine, and
salvia.43 These substances have mechanisms of action
distinct from those of classic psychedelics. For instance,
MDMA, also known as the street drug ecstasy, works primar-
ily by releasing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.50
Studies have shown that MDMA can produce empathogenic
feelings such as empathy, kindness, and connection to
others and increase social approach behavior.51 MDMA-
assisted psychotherapy has been used to treat certain
psychiatric disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress
disorder.52 Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, can similarly

alter levels of consciousness and is hypothesized to assert
an effect as an antidepressant via its N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonist action.53 In a small study, Berman et
al showed that ketamine had rapid antidepressant effects
in patients with major depressive episodes, and signif-
icant improvement in symptoms occurred within hours,
for
making ketamine a substance of particular interest
treating depression.54 Salvia (Salvia divinorum) is an herb
native to Mexico that produces its hallucinogenic effects
via the ingredient salvinorin A that activates kappa opioid
receptors.55 Like ketamine, salvinorin A has been identified
as a potential candidate for major depressive disorder treat-
ment research.56

Psychedelic compounds have been recognized as ben-
eficial
in treating certain psychiatric disorders. For exam-
ple, in January 2023, Oregon became the first US state
to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin mushrooms.57
Australia’s medical regulator announced that as of July 1,
2023, authorized psychiatrists may prescribe MDMA for the
treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and psilocybin
for treatment-resistant depression.58 Entheogens, particu-
larly psilocybin, have been decriminalized in some cities
and states in the United States or have active governmen-
tal bills regarding decriminalization.59 Despite the therapeu-
tic potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy for a variety of
psychiatric conditions, many challenges complicate the use
of psychedelic-assisted therapies in a clinical setting, includ-
ing the cost of treatments and ethical and legal restrictions.35
Although studies have investigated the efficacy of
psychedelics in treating patients with psychiatric disorders
such as posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive
disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder with anxiety
either coexisting with the diagnosis or as a comorbidity,
less research has examined the effect of psychedelics on
patients with anxiety disorders as the primary diagnosis. This
review focuses on the therapeutic efficacy and safety pro-
file of psychedelic-assisted therapy in patients with anxiety
disorders.

METHODS

The literature review was conducted and reported accord-
ing to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.60

Studies, Participants, and Interventions

For this original

literature review, we searched for clin-
ical trials and case reports investigating the effects of
ayahuasca, peyote, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, psilocybin,
mescaline, salvia, and 2C-B on anxiety symptoms that were
published in peer-reviewed journals. We limited publications
to papers in the English language, and we required access
to the entirety of the publication. Posters, reviews, abstracts,
and animal studies were excluded. Patients included in the
studies must have had an established diagnosis of one of
the DSM-IV-TR, DSM-5, or DSM-5-TR anxiety disorders.

Outcome Measures

The efficacy of the psychedelics on anxiety symptoms
was measured using different scales and self-reported ques-
tionnaires. Symptom improvement was measured by com-
paring baseline scores to scores at various follow-up peri-
ods. The safety and tolerability of the psychedelics were

investigated by noting the incidence and types of adverse
effects.

Search Methods and Extraction

Two authors (LF and TS) conducted the literature search
in August 2022 in the PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and
CINAHL online databases using the search words and
terms LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, MDMA, mescaline, pey-
ote, ketamine, salvia, 2C-B, “separation anxiety,” “general-
ized anxiety disorder,” “social anxiety,” “selective mutism,”
“panic disorder,” “agoraphobia,” and “anxiety.” No time
frame was defined for excluding articles. All publications
were downloaded into EndNote (Clarivate Plc), and dupli-
cates were removed. All publications were uploaded into
Rayyan (Rayyan Systems, Inc) to be screened by title and
abstract by 3 authors (LF, TS, and NR). The authors (LF, TS,
and NR) reviewed the remaining full-text articles based on
the eligibility criteria. The reference lists of notable reviews
were also manually searched for relevant articles.

Authors, publication date, patient diagnosis, sample size,
study design, research question, psychedelic intervention,
follow-up, response, and type of outcome measure were
extracted using Qualtrics (Qualtrics).

Bias Assessment

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool61 was used to investi-
gate each manuscript for bias. This tool covers 6 bias
domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias,
attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Bias in each of
these individual domains was assessed and categorized into
3 categories:

1. Low risk: plan to reduce bias is distinctly defined and

good.

2. Unclear risk: plan to reduce bias is not mentioned, or bias

effects are unknown.

3. High risk: plan to reduce bias is absent or inadequate.

The assessment of whether the risk in each domain was
high or low depended on whether bias of a sufficient mag-
nitude was found to have influenced the results or the con-
clusions of the trial. If the trial had no mention of a particu-
lar domain or an insufficient description of the process, the
domain risk was categorized as unclear. To promote trans-
parency regarding each risk assessment, detailed informa-
tion relevant to each of the bias domains from the trials
included in our review is presented in the Appendix.

We chose to use the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to pro-
vide a standardized way for readers to quickly appraise the
reliability of each trial. Author NR performed the bias assess-
ment. NR consulted with authors LF and TS if the bias deter-
mination was not clear-cut, and all 3 authors conferred until
a decision was made.

RESULTS
Search Results

The literature search yielded 216 database records
(Figure). We eliminated 27 duplicates and screened 189
titles and abstracts. Of these records, 169 records were
excluded, and 20 full-text articles were sought for retrieval
to determine eligibility. One full-text article could not be
retrieved, and 11 articles were further excluded. One
additional article was identified via manual searching of

reference lists in cited articles. Nine studies were included
in this review.

Studies were classified according to drug and anxiety
disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disor-
der, anxiety associated with life-threatening disease). Study
inclusion was based on whether the study included a diag-
nosed anxiety disorder without coexisting major depressive
disorder. Three studies62-64 controlled for depression. The
other 6 studies65-70 did not control for depression but were
included because major depressive disorder was not co-
studied or mentioned as a current coexisting disease. Of the
included studies, 1 used ayahuasca70 (for social anxiety dis-
order), 4 used ketamine62-64,68 (for treatment-resistant gen-
eralized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder), 2 used
LSD66,67 (for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness),
1 used MDMA65 (for anxiety associated with life-threatening
illness), and 1 used psilocybin69 (for anxiety associated with
life-threatening cancer and generalized anxiety disorder).
Details of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.
We did not find any studies examining the effects of peyote,
2C-B, mescaline, or salvia on anxiety disorders.

anxiolytic effects and change in self-perception after

double-blind,

1 dose (2 mL/kg) of ayahuasca compared to placebo in 17
patients (2 males, 15 females) with social anxiety disorder.70
Although the ayahuasca group had decreased visual analog
mood scale anxiety scores, ayahuasca did not produce
significantly decreased visual analog mood scale anxiety
scores at the 3 follow-up appointments (days 7, 14, and
21) compared to placebo. No significant difference in anx-
iety as assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory was seen
between groups. On the Self-Statements During Public
Speaking scale, patients receiving ayahuasca had signifi-
cant increases in self-perception and speech performance
at all 3 follow-ups.70

Ketamine for Treatment-Resistant Generalized
Anxiety Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder

Glue et al conducted an uncontrolled, open-label trial
examining the effect of ascending single doses (0.25, 0.5,
and 1 mg/kg) of ketamine on anxiety ratings in 12 patients
(8 male, 4 female) with treatment-resistant generalized anxi-
ety disorder or social anxiety disorder.62 The study was pub-
lished in 2017. All patients had a Hamilton Anxiety Rating
Scale (HAM-A) score >20 or a Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
(LSAS) score >60. To avoid confounding results of comor-
bid depression, subjects with Montgomery-Asberg Depres-
sion Rating Scale (MADRS) scores >20 were excluded. Fear
Questionnaire (FQ) scores showed a significant dose × time

interaction. HAM-A scores showed an initial decrease and
duration of reduced scores but not a statistically significant
difference from baseline at the 7-day follow-up. Ten of the
12 patients reported a >50% reduction in HAM-A and FQ
scores after the 0.5 or 1 mg/kg dose.

A double-blind, psychoactive-controlled ascending dose
study by Glue et al (published in 2020) examined the effect of
ascending single doses (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) of ketamine
on anxiety ratings compared to placebo in 12 patients
(8 male, 4 female) with treatment-resistant generalized anx-
iety disorder or social anxiety disorder.64 All patients had
a HAM-A score >20 and/or an LSAS score >60. To avoid
confounding results of comorbid depression, subjects with
MADRS scores >20 were excluded. The mean HAM-A at
screening was 28.1, and the mean LSAS at screening was
91.3. Midazolam (0.01 mg/kg), a potent anxiolytic, was used
as the placebo. The placebo effect mirrored the effects of the
0.25 mg/kg dose, but analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed
a significant dose × time effect on FQ scores. The effects
of midazolam overlapped the change in FQ scores for the
0.5 mg/kg ketamine dose, but ANOVA showed a significant
effect of HAM-A vs dose and HAM-A vs time. Eight of the
12 patients reported a >50% decrease in HAM-A and FQ
scores after the 0.5 or 1 mg/kg doses.

In 2018, Glue et al published an uncontrolled open-label
study that examined the change in anxiety ratings, toler-
ability, and anxiety remission after 3 months of 2 weekly
ketamine injections (1 mg/kg) in 20 patients (10 male, 10
female) with treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disor-
der or social anxiety disorder.63 The participants in this study
had already been deemed as responders in the prelimi-
nary ascending dose-finding trials (published in 201762 and
202064). The mean HAM-A score of these patients at base-
line was 12.6, a reduction from the previous mean of 25
because of their participation in one of the original ascend-
ing dose trials. An hour after the ketamine injection, FQ and
HAM-A ratings decreased by 50%. FQ scores reached a
plateau by 7.5 weeks, and HAM-A scores plateaued by 3.5
weeks. Most participants reported an increased ability to
concentrate and perform everyday tasks.63

Ketamine for Social Anxiety Disorder

A 2018 double-blind,

randomized, placebo-controlled
intravenous (IV)
crossover trial examined the effects of
ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) vs placebo (normal
saline) on social phobia symptoms in 18 adults (11 male,
7 female) with social anxiety disorder.68 Each patient either
received ketamine or placebo on day 0 and then received
the other infusion on day 28. Patients receiving ketamine
demonstrated a significant decrease in LSAS scores com-
pared to placebo at the 2- and 10-day follow-ups but did
not show a significant change from placebo for the anxiety
symptoms on the visual analog scale.68

LSD for Anxiety Associated With Life-Threatening
Illness

A 2014 double-blind,

randomized, placebo-controlled
pilot study examined the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted
psychotherapy in 12 patients (8 male, 4 female) on anxi-
ety associated with life-threatening illness.67 All 12 patients
reported a baseline State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-
S) or State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T) score >40.

STAI scores were compared before and after 2 experimental
psychotherapy sessions with 200 μg of LSD or placebo (20
μg of LSD) 2 to 3 weeks apart. All participants were followed
for 12 months after the study. STAI-S scores were signifi-
cantly reduced at the 2-month follow-up and were sustained
after 12 months, but the STAI-T scores were not signifi-
cantly decreased. Nonanxiety measures also had significant
outcomes, including the 30-item European Cancer Quality
of Life Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised.67

At the conclusion of the study, participants who received
placebo were offered open-label treatment with 200 μg of
LSD. The long-term follow-up, open-label, nonplacebo clin-
ical trial (2015) included 10 (6 males, 4 females) of the origi-
nal 12 participants66; 3 of the participants received placebo
in the original clinical trial.67 The new study looked at the
long-term effect on STAI anxiety scores after 3 months of
treatment with 6 to 8 psychotherapy sessions and 2 LSD
experiences (200 μg) at a 4- to 6-week interval. STAI-S
and STAI-T scores showed significant reductions at the 12-
month follow-up. Semistructured interviews conducted with
the participants and evaluated via qualitative content anal-
ysis concluded that 77.8% reported sustained reductions
in anxiety, 77.9% reported less fear of death, and 66.7%
reported improved quality of life.66

MDMA for Anxiety Associated With Life-
Threatening Illness

A 2020 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
examined the change in anxiety ratings before and after
administration of MDMA (125 mg) with two 8-hour psy-
chotherapy sessions in 18 patients (4 male, 14 female)
with anxiety associated with life-threatening illness.65 Partic-
ipants had a mean STAI-S score of 57.4 and a mean STAI-T
score of 61.1 at baseline. In patients receiving MDMA, mean
STAI-T scores decreased 1 month after the second psy-
chotherapy session by –23.5 compared to placebo. How-
ever, these differences were not significant because of an
outlier (P=0.0558). When the placebo outlier was removed
from the analysis, STAI-T change scores between groups
were statistically significant (P=0.0066). To examine long-
term follow-up at 6 and 12 months, a crossover was done
for participants in the placebo group, and the overall ANOVA
for STAI-T and STAI-S showed statistically significant reduc-
tions in scores for all participants.65

Psilocybin for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and
Anxiety Associated With Life-Threatening Cancer
A 2011 double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined
the safety and effectiveness of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) in 12
adults (1 male, 11 female) with a diagnosis of anxiety associ-
ated with life-threatening cancer, generalized anxiety disor-
der, or adjustment disorder with anxiety.69 Subjects received
niacin (250 mg) in a separate session to act as their own
controls. The STAI scores revealed no significant changes
from day 1 to 2 weeks after treatment, although a nonsignifi-
cant but considerable decrease for STAI-S was seen 6 hours
after administration. No significant STAI-S anxiety change
was observed, but a decrease in STAI-T scores was sus-
tained during the 6-month follow-up. A significant decrease
was observed at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups after the
second treatment.69

Safety and Tolerability

Not every study included in this review reported data
regarding adverse effects. For the studies that did, the
incidence of adverse effects is summarized in Table 2.
Overall, ayahuasca, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, and psilocy-
bin were well tolerated. The most common adverse effects
were transient elevated blood pressure, nausea/vomiting,
dissociation/derealization, and transient anxiety/distress.
Although increases in blood pressure were reported for all
psychedelics other than MDMA, only ayahuasca, LSD, and
1 ketamine trial produced clinical hypertension in some
participants. Ayahuasca produced nausea/vomiting, as well
as transient increase in blood pressure. Ketamine had the
highest rates of drowsiness and dissociation/derealization.
LSD caused increased cold sensitivity and transient anxi-
ety. MDMA had the highest rate of headaches. An adverse
effect that was unique to MDMA was jaw clenching. Along
with the other adverse effects listed in Table 2 for the MDMA
trial, no intervention was needed and all resolved after the
session.65 Although no other adverse effects were identified
by the authors of the psilocybin trial, psilocybin produced
a statistically significant elevation in blood pressure.69 The
mean elevated systolic blood pressure of patients after tak-
ing psilocybin was 138.9 mm Hg, which is not considered to
be hypertensive, compared to the mean of 117.0 mm Hg dur-
ing the niacin placebo sessions.69 All adverse effects of the
psychedelics resolved after the acute drug sessions ended.
No cases of prolonged hallucinations and altered state of
consciousness were reported.

Bias Assessment

The level of bias across the studies varied greatly, the high-
est being in the performance, selection, and detection bias
domains.61 Table 3 presents the results of author NR’s bias
assessment. A detailed explanation of the assessment of
each publication is provided in the Appendix.

Selection bias was assessed according to 2 factors:
sequence generation and allocation concealment. The risk of
bias was low if the patients were selected through a random-
ized process and the details of the randomization method-
ology were provided. If patients were randomized but the
description of the methodology was insufficient, the risk was
unclear. Nonrandomized trials were high risk. Allocation con-
cealment was present in all but 2 trials, and these studies
were assessed as low risk. The 2 open-label studies were
assessed as high risk.

Blinding of participants and researchers, a form of perfor-
mance bias, was assessed universally as high risk because
each trial was either open label or participants were able to
correctly guess whether they had received active treatment
or placebo regardless of blinding because of the psychoac-
tive effects of the treatment.

Blinding of outcomes, a form of detection bias, was
assessed as high risk when the rater was the participant or
the clinician observing the participant, for the same reason
as above.

Incomplete outcome data, a source of attrition bias, were
measured in terms of completion rate and completeness of
outcome data. The completion rate was high (75% to 100%)
in all but 1 trial, and these studies were assessed as low risk.
The lower completion rate for 1 trial (66%), was assessed as

high risk; however, the completion rate was likely attributable
to the terminal disease in the participants.

decreased anxiety after treatment, not all studies had signif-
icant results, likely because of the small population sizes.

Selective reporting, a form of reporting bias, was not
observed in any of the trials. For this domain, studies were
assessed as low risk because primary and secondary end-
points as well as adverse effects were included. Other
biases—ranging from comorbidities, drug-drug interactions,
crossover study design, and patients asking to adjust their
dose according to their underlying anxiety disorder—were
widely observed. For this domain, studies were assessed as
having an unclear risk of bias.

The highest contributor to bias across all studies was the
lack of adequate blinding of participants and researchers,
resulting in performance bias. This problem is common
among double-blind controlled trials that involve psychoac-
tive compounds. Although 1 study used a low-dose anxi-
olytic as a placebo, the authors recognized that using an
active placebo might affect the validity of their results.64

Additionally, many participants had a history of comor-
bid psychiatric diagnoses, most commonly major depres-
sive disorder. Glue et al hypothesized that such a medical
history could represent a phenotype exceptionally respon-
sive to psychedelic treatments.62-64 Other sources of bias
were nonrepresentative population selection, methodology
of obtaining outcome data, presence of a life-threatening
or terminal illness, and variable frequency and duration of
follow-up with participants.

DISCUSSION

The principal finding of our review is that ketamine,
LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin decrease anxiety scores and/or
the negative effects of anxiety and are well-tolerated.62-69
Although all studies other than the trial of ayahuasca70 found

Therapeutic Effects of Psychedelics

Eight of the studies included in this review demonstrated
reduced scores on anxiety outcome measures after therapy
with psychedelics. The exception was the ayahuasca study
by Dos Santos et al.70 Although the anxiety scores of the
patients treated in the Dos Santos et al trial did not decrease
after ayahuasca therapy, the participants reported improved
self-perception and speech performance. These results still
have clinical significance, as a core part of social anxiety
disorder is a negative cognitive bias in self-perception. Cur-
rent first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder include
exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRIs.
Because patients with social anxiety disorder often still
experience symptoms with these treatments, ayahuasca
could potentially increase patients’ self-confidence, enhanc-
ing other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy.

The pattern of anxiety score improvement with ketamine
was similar to the results of prior ketamine studies of
patients with treatment-resistant depression.64,71 These ran-
domized controlled trials that successfully used ketamine
for treatment-resistant depression led to US Food and
Drug Administration approval
in 2019 of the ketamine S-
enantiomer (esketamine) for treatment-resistant depression
and depression with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.72
The 0.25 mg/kg dose appears to be the threshold dose.62-64
No study of the effects of ketamine on anxiety ratings
thus far has examined a dose >1 mg/kg, but in the stud-
ies we reviewed, 1 mg/kg produced the best anxiolytic
effects,62-64,68 and ketamine produced anxiety relief within
1 hour of administration.62-64

322

Ochsner Journal

LSD decreased anxiety ratings and had a positive psy-
chological effect on subjects, including increased relaxation,
equanimity, and mental strength. Psychotherapy with LSD-
like hallucinations may successfully relieve anxiety symp-
toms by breaking up a fixed pattern of thinking that is influ-
enced by emotional bias.66 Gasser et al demonstrated that
LSD can increase mental flexibility during psychotherapy.66
MDMA has the potential for long-term benefits of at least
1 year beyond administration, as the decreased scores on
the STAI-S and STAI-T anxiety rating scales were main-
tained at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups in the Wolfson
et al study.65 Patients also demonstrated increased coping
mechanisms, determined subjectively through their greater
emotional and functional quality of life. MDMA may ben-
efit patients experiencing anxiety who are overcoming an
illness.65

Grob et al reported a sustained reduction in anxiety with
psilocybin.69 Scores on the STAI-T continued to decrease for
the entire 6-month follow-up, reaching significance at the 1-
month and 3-month follow-ups. The study authors hypothe-
sized that the participants had decreased stress and anxiety
over time.69

As previously mentioned, the first line of treatment for
anxiety is SSRIs or SNRIs that take 4 to 6 weeks to take
effect.15 Additionally, side effects such as sexual dysfunc-
tion and increased anxiety with initial use often hinder peo-
ple from continuing these medications.73,74 The ability for the
anxiolytic effects of psychedelics to manifest as early as 1
day potentially suggests a quicker alternative to mainstream
treatment, especially for treatment-resistant patients. Addi-
tionally, many of the anxiolytic effects were sustained for 2
weeks. The long-lasting effects could potentially increase
compliance, as patients would not be required to take daily
medication.

Safety and Tolerability of Psychedelics

In the studies we reviewed, treatment with psychedelics
was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse
effects were transient elevated blood pressure, nau-
sea/vomiting, dissociation/derealization, and transient anxi-
ety/distress.

Two patients in the ayahuasca trial reported headaches
that went away by the following day without interven-
tion. One participant experienced increased distress but
was reassured by researchers about transient effects and
remained calm for the remainder of the experiment. No com-
plaints were made about the tolerability of the experience.70
The 1 mg/kg dose of ketamine appeared to cause the
most adverse effects. After this dose, 2 subjects from the
Glue et al 2017 trial62 felt out of control (categorized as tran-
sient anxiety/distress on Table 2), but no intervention was
needed. Two adverse events that are not noted in Table 2
occurred during the Glue et al 2018 trial but were determined
to be attributable to secondary causes rather than the exper-
imental drug.63 One patient experienced hypertension and
delirium within 5 minutes of dosing that resolved within 15
minutes and returned to baseline by 60 minutes. This event
was presumed to be attributable to inadvertent IV injection.
A second patient who developed a pulmonary embolism had
recently started taking an oral contraceptive.63 The dissocia-
tive effect, the most common effect of ketamine, appeared
to disappear with time and maintenance of treatment.62-64,68

Feulner, L

Although some patients (22.7%) experienced transient
anxiety during the Gasser et al experimental session with
LSD, more participants in the placebo group (50%) reported
transient anxiety.67 A similar pattern was found for emotional
distress; 36.4% of patients in the LSD group reported emo-
tional distress vs 33.3% in the placebo group.67

In the Wolfson et al study, MDMA produced few psychi-
atric adverse events and no reports of suicidal ideation or
behavior which are concerns associated with the drug.65

Psilocybin did not cause any clinically concerning cardio-
vascular sequelae in the Grob et al study. Minor increases in
blood pressure were judged to be evidence of a mild adren-
ergic effect.69

Although these studies show promising evidence of safe
anxiety relief with psychedelics,
the psychedelics were
administered under controlled conditions in each of these
studies. The risk for adverse effects potentially increases
when the dose and context of the psychedelic are not
controlled.

A concern associated with the legalization and safety
for addiction. Although
of psychedelics is the potential
research is limited, LSD and psilocybin have not been shown
to lead to physiologic dependence because they produce
fewer reinforcing effects compared to highly addictive drugs
such as cocaine.41,75,76 Ayahuasca has been used for physi-
ologic dependence recovery and has not been found to have
addictive properties.77

Ketamine and MDMA have been determined to have more
potential for addiction than LSD, psilocybin, and ayahuasca
because of increased positive reinforcement compared to
the other psychedelics.78-80 When used outside of a con-
trolled setting, ketamine has the potential to lead to crav-
ings and withdrawal.81 The evidence is conflicting regard-
ing the potential for MDMA to lead to addiction. Studies
of MDMA dependence describe withdrawal effects after
use,79,82 but whether the reaction is withdrawal or the suba-
cute comedown that people experience after using the drug
is unclear.83 Although some of the psychedelics have a pos-
sible risk of addiction, other highly addictive drugs such as
benzodiazepines and amphetamines have been successfully
used for medical treatment under the guidance of a medical
professional.

When taken in inappropriate doses, the psychedelics dis-
cussed in this study can cause side effects such as dehy-
dration, confusion, hypertonia, and hyperthermia because
of their serotonergic properties.84 An additional risk is the
experience of overwhelming distress, often called a “bad
trip,” with these psychedelics. Adverse effects associated
with a bad trip include increased anxiety and self-harm.85
Researchers have attempted to determine clinical features
that can predict a poor reaction to psychedelics, in particu-
lar LSD, but no conclusions have been reached.86

Despite the reported risks, LSD has been studied for its
anti-addiction properties in the treatment of alcohol use
disorder. A pooled analysis of 6 randomized controlled tri-
als found that a single dose of LSD had a statistically
significant benefit on alcohol misuse at the first follow-up
assessment.87 Ketamine has also been studied in the treat-
ment of alcohol use disorder. In a 2022 study, patients who
received 3 ketamine infusions had more days abstinent from
alcohol in the 6-month follow-up period than the patients
who were randomized to placebo.88

Psychedelic Treatment of Anxiety Disorders

Limitations

This research has several limitations. The number of stud-
ies investigating psychedelics in patients with anxiety disor-
ders was limited. Our literature search, including the manual
search, yielded only 9 studies that met our inclusion crite-
ria, limiting the types of anxiety disorders and psychedelics
we could assess. Ketamine was the only psychedelic sub-
stance with 4 studies, while LSD, ayahuasca, psilocybin,
and MDMA only had 1 or 2 studies. Additionally, the results
of all these studies were self-reported, making their results
prone to response bias, and they used restrictive numeric
self-reporting scales. As shown in Table 3, many studies had
high bias ratings. The high bias ratings may be related to the
legislation regulating the use of psychedelics that therefore
limits study designs. In congruence with the limited study
designs, each study had a small population size (n=10 to
20), affecting significance and decreasing internal and exter-
nal validity, as many of the participants had life-threatening
diseases. Although some of the studies were double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trials, the effects of the
drugs are often difficult to mimic with placebo, making it
easier for participants to tell they are receiving the tested
psychedelic. Some of the studies did not control for depres-
sion or mention coexisting depression. As depression com-
monly coexists with anxiety, some of the participants may
have had undiagnosed or undisclosed comorbid depres-
sion. Patients with life-threatening illnesses are likely to
have comorbid depression, as changes in the progression
of the illness can impact their mental health, skewing the
results.

Direction for Future Research

Future research investigating psychedelics as a therapeu-
tic treatment for anxiety disorders should include double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with
large populations. Improvements in study design and more
extensive trials will become increasingly more accessible as
the laws in the United States and internationally open to
the use of psychedelics. Additionally, when examining the
effect of psychedelics on anxiety, controlling for coexisting
depression will be essential. Future research can focus on
determining precise dosing and frequency of administration.
Another important determination is whether the psychedelic
substances have a tolerance effect or if patients need less at
each administration. Additional studies could investigate the
effects of psychedelics such as peyote and ibogaine on anx-
iety because these substances have been found to have a
better safety profile than many major legal and illegal drugs89
and have little physical dependence.76

CONCLUSION

This literature review examined psychedelic use for gener-
alized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and anxiety
associated with a life-threatening disease. Ketamine, LSD,
MDMA, and psilocybin consistently produced an anxiolytic
effect sustained for at least 2 weeks after the therapeutic
session. Although ayahuasca did not produce a signifi-
cant change in anxiety ratings, patients with social anxiety
disorder had increased self-perception and performance.
No life-threatening psychedelic-related adverse effects
were reported in any of the trials. SSRIs and SNRIs are the
current pharmacologic gold standard treatment for anxiety

disorders but are associated with multiple adverse effects
and poor adherence. Psychedelics may represent a possible
treatment option for people who are unable to tolerate the
effects of the first-line medications or are unresponsive to
their effects. Because much of this research is novel and
conducted in small populations and in controlled settings,
large double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials
with long-term follow-up and an examination of dosing
and frequency need to be done to determine efficacy and
safety.

Four patients
requested
twice-weekly
dosing for early
recurrence of
anxiety (usually
within 4 days of
dosing), and 16
received
once-weekly
dosing

Participants and

Degree of group

All prespecified
outcomes
reported
Variability in the

extent of contact
with subjects after
treatment; ad hoc
communication
depended on the
needs and wishes
of subjects, some
of whom were
near death while
others were more
functional

differences impacted
by an outlier in the
placebo group who
responded
exceptionally well to
psychotherapy alone
compared to other
participants in the
placebo group
during the blinded
segment; potential
placebo effect
because 2 of 3
placebo participants
believed they were
assigned MDMA
during the blinded
segment
