Abstract

Background.  Adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been well-
documented, but only a few studies have characterized distinct trajectories of anxiety over time. 
Further, whether specific emotion regulation and coping efforts to manage pandemic distress 
predict these distinct trajectories remains unexamined.

Aims:  The study characterized anxiety trajectories across the first year of the pandemic 
and identified emotion regulation and coping strategies that predict these classes of anxiety 
trajectories. A national sample of 1,108 U.S. adults completed online surveys six times in the first 
year of the pandemic. Five emotion regulation and coping strategies were assessed (substance use, 
active, behavioral disengagement, positive reappraisal, catastrophizing). Latent Growth Mixture 
Modeling (LGGM) analyses were performed to identify anxiety trajectory classes.

Results.  LGMM revealed five latent classes: Resilience (consistently very low anxiety; 79.9%), 
Moderate Anxiety (8.8%), Chronic High Anxiety (4.6%), Improving-Worsening Anxiety (3.2%), 
and Worsening-Improving Anxiety (3.5%). Using substances, disengagement, and catastrophizing 
to deal with COVID-19 stress consistently predicted trajectories higher in anxiety as did active 
coping, while positive reappraisal was unrelated to trajectory class membership.

Conclusions.  These results identify emotion regulation and coping strategies that appeared to 
exacerbate anxiety during the course of the pandemic.

On average, high levels of anxiety often follow major stressful experiences (see Szabo 
et al., 2017, for a review), yet great individual variations in anxiety responses are also 
well-documented (see King et al., 2012 and Tortella-Feliu et al., 2019, for reviews). Recent

research characterizing the variety in patterns of anxiety and other aspects of distress that 
follow highly stressful events has identified multiple distinct trajectories. These distinct 
trajectories have been found following many types of major adversity, including terrorist 
attacks, bereavement, and cancer diagnosis (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018). In contrast to 
models that predict only mean levels of distress, identifying distinct trajectories of distress 
advances our understanding by highlighting individuals’ diverse responses to major stressors 
and allows determining predictors of these different trajectories.

Across studies, a trajectory of resilience---fairly stable low levels of distress--tends to be 
by far the most common (Bonanno, 2004). Other identified trajectories include stable 
levels of high distress, stable moderate levels of distress, and changing trajectories (e.g., 
increases, decreases, initial decreases then increases) across the assessed time points. In fact, 
these consistent, robust findings of multiple distress trajectories led some psychologists to 
speculate early in the pandemic that similar trajectories would emerge from the COVID-19 
crisis (e.g., Chen & Bonanno, 2020).

Fulfilling that prediction, researchers did indeed identify multiple distinct trajectories over 
short periods of time (e.g., over several weeks to several months), with resilience by far 
the predominant one, in studies around the world [e.g., in the UK (McPherson et al., 2021; 
Pierce et al., 2021; Saunders et al., 2021), Israel (Kimhi et al., 2021), Australia (Batterham et 
al., 2021), France (Pellerini et al., 2022), Germany (Ahrens et al., 2021), and Spain (Banos 
et al., 2021)]. Notably, all of these studies were conducted in the first few months of the 
pandemic (almost all earlier than June 2020) and thus could not address the question of 
longer-term trajectories of distress as the pandemic lengthened and became increasingly 
perceived as an enduring and open-ended crisis (Heisbourg, 2020).

One study that examined trajectories of general distress across the full first year of the 
pandemic was conducted in Poland; however, vaccines were largely unavailable there during 
the first year of the pandemic, and Poland experienced its second lockdown a full year 
after the pandemic’s start (Gambin et al., 2021). In the Polish study, 60% of the sample 
demonstrated resilience (low levels of anxiety/depressive symptoms) across time, while 23% 
demonstrated chronic high levels of distress and smaller percentages experienced either 
increases (7%) or decreases (10%) in distress across the year (Gambin et al., 2021).

Several other studies of distress across the first year identified multiple trajectories of 
general distress or anxiety in particular. For example, in a cohort of German adults, a 
measure of anxiety/depressive symptoms was administered four times across 2.5 years 
of the pandemic (although not starting until July, 2020). Six symptom trajectories were 
identified: low-stable (i.e., resilient; 77.2 %), continuous deterioration (2.4 %), transient 
deterioration (6.0 %), continuous improvement (7.7 %), transient improvement (3.0 %) and 
chronicity (3.7 %) (Kenntemich, 2024). In a sample of Israelis across the first year of the 
pandemic, four trajectories of anxiety were identified: resilience (66%), chronic anxiety 
(22%), emerging anxiety (7%), and improving (6%) (Hemi et al., 2023).

Identifying distinct trajectories of distress then allows determining predictors of trajectory 
class membership, the second aim of our study. We based our study on the transactional

stress and coping model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), which highlights the roles of 
individuals’ resources (both material and psychosocial) and specific coping efforts with a 
given stressor in determining their levels of distress (Marroquín et al., 2017). Specifically, 
those who have greater resources and use coping strategies that are more effective in 
managing negative emotions and resolving problems experience less distress (Folkman, 
2020). Studies of trajectories in the pandemic most commonly identified demographic 
predictors, showing older age, male gender, and higher socioeconomic status predicted a 
resilient or other favorable trajectory (e.g., Kenntemich, 2024; Pierce et al., 2021; Saunders 
et al., 2021). Fewer studies examined psychosocial resources as potential predictors of 
trajectory class in the context of COVID-19. In the abovementioned Polish sample, fewer 
difficulties in emotion regulation and greater social support predicted classification in more 
mentally healthy trajectories (Gambin et al., 2021). In the French sample mentioned above, 
resources (wisdom, optimism, hope, self-efficacy, peacefulness) protected individuals from 
membership in symptomatic groups. In community samples in the UK, the five-factor model 
of personality predicted trajectory class membership (Saunders et al., 2021) while loneliness 
predicted lower likelihood of a resilient trajectory (McPherson et al., 2021; Shevlin et 
al., 2021). Higher religiousness predicted resilient class membership in a sample in Israel 
(Kimhi, 2021). In Italian and German samples, psychological flexibility predicted higher 
likelihood of resilience (Hemi et al., 2023; Landi et al., 2022).

While the studies linking emotion regulation difficulties and psychological flexibility with 
trajectory class membership suggests that how individual regulate their distress and coping 
may be an important predictor of distress trajectories (Hemi et al., 2023; Landi et al., 2022; 
Gambin et al., 2021), studies to date have yet to directly examine whether individuals’ actual 
efforts to regulate COVID-related distress predict trajectory class membership. Previous 
studies of people facing myriad types of crises [e.g., serious illness (Petrie & Jones, 2019) 
and disasters (Park & Blake, 2020)] demonstrated that individuals’ specific strategies for 
coping with stressful situations and regulating their emotions have a substantial impact 
on how they fare psychologically. For example, among the most helpful strategies are 
meaning-focused coping, such as reappraising the situation in a more positive light, along 
with employing active problem-solving when situations are amenable to change; both of 
these strategies have been shown to lead to less distress following high-magnitude stressors 
(e.g., Park et al., 2012; for review, see Marroquín et al., 2017). On the other hand, facing 
major stressors through catastrophizing, turning to drugs or alcohol to cope, or disengaging 
(essentially giving up) have been shown to lead to greater distress (see Aldwin, 2007; Cisler 
et al., 2010; Zaumseil, 2014, for reviews).

Given this large body of literature on emotion regulation and coping strategies, it is 
not surprising that similar findings have been reported in the context of COVID-19. For 
example, a study of adults in China found disengaging and using substances to cope with 
the pandemic related to greater distress (Lin et al., 20121), and in a study of people in the 
US and Canada, positive reappraisal of and active coping with the pandemic related quite 
strongly to lower levels of anxiety and depression while disengaging and using substances 
to cope related to higher levels of anxiety and depression (Shamblaw et al., 2021). One 
study of community residents in Canada early in the pandemic found that likelihood of 
being in the resilient rather than depressed class was predicted by lower scores on broadly-

defined “maladaptive coping” and emotion-focused coping styles dimensions—but these 
were assessed as traits rather than specific actions regarding COVID-19, again highlighting 
the need to better understand specific coping strategies in determining distress trajectory 
class membership (Joshi et al., 2021).

Given that few studies have examined relatively long-term trajectories of anxiety following 
COVID, we aimed to identify the trajectories that emerged across the first year. We 
hypothesized that we would find 4–5 trajectories of distress, similar to existing studies 
reviewed above. For example, some people might demonstrate resilience, showing low levels 
of anxiety throughout the pandemic. We also hypothesized that we would see a substantial 
trajectory class of improvement from the nadir of the initial surge in late fall 2020, before 
vaccines were available in the US and very little was understood about the virus or its 
impact, to April, 2021, when vaccines were widely available, which introduced the hope 
that the pandemic would end and might reduce stress and therefore reduce anxiety, at least 
for some people (Fiske et al., 2022; Murray & Piot, 2021). Further, over time, more and 
more information about COVID-19 became available, which may have reduced the stress of 
uncertainty (Peters et al., 2017).

Our second aim was to examine the extent to which emotion regulation and coping 
strategies predicted class membership. Based on previous literature demonstrating effects 
of emotion regulation and coping strategies on subsequent distress, we hypothesized that 
these strategies would predict trajectory class membership. In particular, we anticipated that, 
as in past research, positive reappraisal and active coping would be adaptive and thus predict 
resilience or recovery trajectories while catastrophizing, behavioral disengagement, and 
using substances to cope would predict chronic distress. We anticipated that these emotion 
regulation and coping strategies would remain predictive of anxiety trajectory classes even 
after controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status and employment (all of which 
have been reported as predictive of trajectories).

These data were drawn from a longitudinal research project; the ethics of the study were 
approved by the BLINDED FOR REVIEW IRB (Exempt Protocol #X20–157). Participants 
were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). U.S. adults aged 18 years or 
older and fluent in English were eligible for the project. Participants submitted informed 
consent before starting the online baseline survey. The research collected data at six time 
points from April 2020 through April 2021: T1 (baseline), T2 (30 days after), T3 (60 days 
after), T4 (90 days after), T5 (180 days after), and T6 (365 days after). Each survey was 
open for two weeks, and participants received $2 after completing a survey at each time 
point. At T1 (i.e., baseline), 1,565 participants completed the survey.

The current study analyzed data from 1,108 participants who completed surveys for at least 
two time points. In the longitudinal data, the number of participants decreased over time: 
1,108 at T1, 841 (75.9%) at T2, 816 (73.6%) at T3, 744 (67.1%) at T4, 712 (64.3%) 
at T5, and 502 (45.3%) at T6. Participants at T1 were an average age of 38.04 years

(SD = 13.76), ranging from 20 to 88. More than half were female (54.3%) and White, 
non-Hispanic (70.2%). Over a third of participants were married (38.4%), and 70.2% were 
employed (See Table 3). Of the 1,546 participants, data from 438 participants who finished 
the baseline survey only were excluded from current analyses. The participants with one 
timepoint data were younger (M = 29.50, SD = 9.67), represented a higher percentage of 
minority races/ethnicities, and were less likely to be married and employed than were those 
who participated over time.

Demographics.  Participants reported age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, and 
employment status.

COVID-19 Coping and Emotion Regulation.  To assess participants’ coping and 
emotion regulation strategies with regard to pandemic-related stressors, three subscales 
from the Brief COPE (Carver et al., 1989) were selected: substance use (four items, α 
= .96), active coping (two items, r = .62, p < .001), and behavioral disengagement (two 
items, r = .57, p < .001). Participants responded to these items using a four-point Likert 
scale: 1 (I usually don’t do this at all) to 4 (I usually do this a lot). A mean score 
was calculated for each subscale. Moreover, two subscales from the Cognitive Emotion 
Regulation Questionnaire-short form (CERQ; Garnefski et al., 2006) were selected: Positive 
reappraisal (2 items, r = .69, p < .001) and catastrophizing (2 items, r = .68, p < .001). 
Participants reported those two emotion regulation strategies using a five-point Likert scale: 
1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Each CERQ subscale was scored by summing the 
responses to the items. For both Brief COPE and CERQ, items were asked regarding 
their responses to the stresses of COVID-19; higher scores indicate more use of a specific 
emotion regulation or coping strategy.

Anxiety.  Anxiety was assessed using the anxiety subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, 
Stress Scales (DASS-21; Henry & Crawford, 2005). Participants rated how much seven 
anxiety-related statements applied to them over the past week on a four-point Likert scale: 0 
(did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time). The seven 
items were summed to create the anxiety score, and the summed score was multiplied by 
2. Based on the cutoff value, individuals could be categorized as normal (0–6), mild (7–9), 
moderate (10–14), severe (15–19), or extremely severe (20+) (Sinclair et al., 2012). In the 
present sample, Cronbach’s alpha ranged from .89-.91 across the six time points.

Analytic strategies

We conducted Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) using Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 
1998–2017) to identify trajectories of anxiety. We first tested a single growth curve model 
without predictors and model fit indices: Chi-square statistics, comparative fit index (CFI; 
Hu & Bentler, 1999), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Browne & 
Cudeck, 1993), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; Jöreskog & Sörbom, 
1981). Each model fit index was acceptable: CFI values ≥ 0.90; RMSEA values ≤ 0.10; 
SRMR values ≤ 0.10 (Weston & Gore, 2006). Next, we examined one- to six- classes 
models and selected the optimal number of classes based on theoretical expectations

(i.e., model fit indices), meaning and interpretability of trajectories, and the necessity for 
parsimony (Wickrama et al., 2021). Model fit indices include: Akaike’s information criterion 
(AIC; Akaike, 1974), Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwartz, 1978), sample-size 
adjusted BIC (SSABIC; Sclove, 1987), entropy, and the bootstrap likelihood ratio test 
(BLRT; Nylund et al., 2007). For the optimal class model, lower AIC, BIC, and SSABIC 
are preferred. Also, entropy around 0.8, higher and significant BLRT at .05, and no less than 
1.0% of total count in a class are preferred (Jung & Wickrama, 2008). Significant BLRT 
indicates that k-class model shows a better fit than k-1 class model. Lastly, a LGMM model 
with predictors was tested to investigate class memberships. Predictors were selected based 
on correlations with anxiety scores, LGMM model fit indices (Huang et al., 2010), theories 
and literature review (Frankfurt et al., 2016), and discussions among authors.

To handle the missing data, the missing mechanism was identified: we ran Little’s test (Little 
& Rubin, 1987) and found that anxiety scores with missing data are not missing completely 
at random (MCAR), χ2(106) = 203.553, p < .001. Then, correlations between missing data 
in anxiety and research variables were analyzed: the percentage of missing data in anxiety 
was higher among participants with lower substance use, behavioral disengagement, and 
catastrophizing. Therefore, we considered the missing mechanism to be missing at random 
(MAR). As previous literature suggested (deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; Enders, 2001), Full 
Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) was used to handle missing data.

Prior to LGMM analyses, mean anxiety scores at each time point and correlations among 
the scores were investigated. The overall level of anxiety across decreased across the six 
time points but was within the range considered “normal” across all time points, based on 
suggested cutoff values (Sinclair et al., 2012). The anxiety scores at each time point were 
highly intercorrelated. Regarding COVID-19 coping at T1, the mean usage of active coping 
was higher than substance use and behavioral disengagement. Among cognitive emotion 
regulation strategies, the mean usage of positive reappraisal was higher than catastrophizing 
(See Table 1).

We tested both a linear and quadratic growth curve model with no predictors: χ2 (16) = 
166.82, p < .001, RMSEA = .09 [.08, .11], CFI = .96, SRMR = .04, and χ2 (12) = 79.82, 
p < .001, RMSEA = .07 [.06, .09], CFI = .98, SRMR = .03, respectively. According to 
model fit indices and Chi-square difference test (Δ; χ2 (4) = 87.00, p < .001), the quadratic 
curve model was selected for this study. Next, the number of classes was identified by 
investigating one- to six-class models with no predictors and comparing model fit indices 
of each model (See Table 2). Across one- to six-class models, AIC, BIC, and SSABIC 
got lower, meaning that the model fit improved. Moreover, although the number of classes 
increased, we found constantly higher entropy than 0.93 and significant BLRT. Also, no 
class showed less than 1.0% of the total sample. Given the figures of those six models and 
the interpretability of trajectories, the five-class model of trajectories was selected as the 
final model (see Figure 1).

The first class (n = 885, 79.9%), labeled Resilience, was the largest. Resilience had the 
smallest intercept for anxiety among classes (b = 2.13, SE = 0.14, p < .001). The anxiety 
level of Resilience slightly decreased over time (slope: b = −0.23, SE = 0.06, p < .001; 
quadratic slope: b = 0.02, SE = 0.004, p < .001). The second class (n = 98, 8.8%), labeled 
Moderate Anxiety, had an intercept of moderate value for anxiety (b = 16.23, SE = 1.70, p 
< .001). Anxiety levels in the Moderate Anxiety class significantly decreased over time (b = 
−1.51, SE = 0.66, p < .05) and the decrease tapered off (b = 0.12, SE = 0.05, p < .05). The 
third class (n = 51, 4.6%), labeled Chronic High Anxiety, showed the largest intercept for 
anxiety among classes (b = 27.03, SE = 1.25, p < .001). The anxiety levels of the Chronic 
High Anxiety class was consistently stable (slope, b = 0.19, SE = 0.36, ns; quadratic slope, 
b = −0.03, SE = 0.03, ns). The fourth class (n = 35, 3.2%), labeled Improved-Worsened 
Anxiety, had an intercept indicating an extremely severe level of anxiety (b = 20.92, SE = 
1.96, p < .001). The anxiety level of this class improved from T1 through T5 (b = −7.49, SE 
= 0.70, p < .001) but then dramatically worsened by T6 (accelerated increase; b = 0.68, SE 
= 0.06, p < .001). The last class (n = 39, 3.5%), labeled Worsened-Improved Anxiety, had 
normal levels of anxiety (per cutoffs; Sinclair et al., 2012) at T1 (b = 6.92, SE = 1.18, p < 
.001). Anxiety in the Worsened-Improved Anxiety class grew faster from T1 through T5 (b 
= 3.64, SE = 0.70, p < .001) but then decreased by T6 (deaccelerated increase; b = −0.25, SE 
= 0.06, p < .001).

Those in the Resilience class were more likely to be older and married. Moreover, those 
in the Chronic High Anxiety were more likely to be younger and bi/multi-racial. Similar 
to the Resilience, Improved-Worsened were more likely to be married, whereas Worsened-
Improved were less likely to be married (See Table 3).

To examine COVID-19 coping and cognitive emotion regulation as predictors of class 
membership, we performed multinomial logistic regression analyses (See Table 4). 
Considering Resilience as a reference class, those in both the Moderate Anxiety and the 
Chronic High Anxiety classes were more likely to use substances (i.e., alcohol or drugs), 
withdrawal, and catastrophizing to cope with COVID-19 stressors. In addition, those in 
the Chronic High Anxiety class were more likely to actively cope with their COVID-19 
stressors than were those in the Resilience class. Furthermore, compared to those in the 
Resilience class, those in the Improved-Worsened Anxiety class were more likely to use 
substances, behaviorally disengage, and catastrophize to deal with COVID-19 stressors. 
Those in the Worsened-Improved Anxiety class were more likely to use withdrawal coping 
behaviors and catastrophize about their COVID-19 stressful experiences than were those in 
the Resilience class. Compared to those in the Moderate Anxiety class, those in the Chronic 
High Anxiety class were more likely to actively cope with COVID-19 stressors. Those in 
the Worsened-Improved class were less likely to use substances and withdraw to cope than 
were those in the Chronic High Anxiety class. Compared to those in the Improved-Worsened 
class, those in the Worsened-Improved class were less likely to use substances to cope.

Discussion

Across six time points in the first year of the pandemic in the U.S., we found generally 
fairly low levels of anxiety (in the range of “normal”; Sinclair et al., 2012), but also found

that people varied greatly in their anxiety levels. Further, we saw distinct trajectories of 
anxiety across identifiable subgroups. These findings are consistent with the many studies 
that documented modest average levels of anxiety early in the pandemic in the U.S. and 
worldwide (Hyland et al., 2021; Planchuelo-Gómez et al., 2020), but also large individual 
differences in the extent to which people were experiencing anxiety (e.g., Shevlin et al., 
2021). Indeed, as has been shown in studies of trajectories of anxiety over time in the 
context of other stressors (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2012; Boyes et al., 2013) as well as earlier in 
the pandemic (e.g., Kimhi et al., 2021; McPherson et al., 2021), the most common trajectory 
in our study, by far, was Resilience, in which people experienced relatively little anxiety 
across time. In fact, nearly 80% of our sample (79.9%) were in this trajectory class.

In addition to seeing a predominance of resilience, we observed general stability in anxiety 
levels across the entire first year of the pandemic; collectively, 13.4% were stable in their 
moderate (8.8%) or high levels (4.6%) while only 6.4% were in trajectories that changed 
over the year. Trajectory studies looking at shorter timeframes earlier in the pandemic 
documented somewhat more change but showed fewer individuals in the resilience class 
(e.g., Shevlin et al., 2021).

This study was conducted across a full year in which the spreading of COVID-19 blossomed 
from an emergency response into a long-term situation requiring substantial adaptation in 
all spheres of life (AJMC, 2020; Webster, 2021). We anticipated that we would see some 
reduction in anxiety from the nadir of the initial surge in late fall 2020, before vaccines had 
been approved in the US, to April, 2021, when vaccines were widely available and people 
had had time to learn and understand more about COVID-19 and adapt to it (AJMC, 2020). 
However, given that the bulk of individuals had stably low levels of anxiety, most individuals 
had little room for improvement. We saw a nearly-equal number of individuals improve and 
decline in their anxiety from late fall 2020 to the approximately one-year anniversary of the 
pandemic in early April 2021. Both groups were small (less than 4% of the sample for both 
those who gradually reduced in their anxiety through October then shot up again by the first 
year, and those who gradually increased in their anxiety through October then precipitously 
declined). That interim entailed a highly-charged social and political environment that may 
have brought about changes in anxiety levels in the US. This period included a highly 
contested presidential election, insurrection at the US Capitol, surging infections of a new 
COVID-19 variant, and high levels of vaccine refusal or hesitancy (Marshburn et al., 2021; 
Troiano & Nardi, 2021), any or all of which may have accounted for observed changes in 
anxiety.

Our second aim was to examine the extent to which emotion regulation and coping strategies 
predicted class membership. Based on transactional stress and coping theory (Lazarus & 
Folkman, 1984), we anticipated that strategies shown to predict anxiety in previous studies 
with other enduring, community-level stressful experiences would predict trajectory class 
memberships in dealing with COVID-19. Specifically, we anticipated thatcatastrophizing, 
disengagement, and using substances to cope would lead to higher and more chronic levels 
of anxiety (Cisler et al., 2010; Zaumseil, 2014). We found support for these expectations; 
all three of these previously-demonstrated problematic strategies for emotion regulation and 
coping related positively to membership in a trajectory of higher or more chronic anxiety

when used for managing COVID-19-related stressors relative to those in the resilience 
trajectory.

However, our expectations that two emotion regulation and coping strategies generally 
shown to be helpful in other high-level stressful encounters—active coping and positive 
reappraisal (e.g., Puechlong et al., 2020; Schäfer et al., 2020)--would relate to reduced levels 
of anxiety in dealing with pandemic stress were not supported. In fact, active coping actually 
related positively to membership in classes experiencing higher levels of anxiety while 
positive reappraisal did not predict class membership at all. Perhaps the most troublesome 
stressors of the pandemic were ones over which people could exert little control, and thus 
active coping was an ineffective strategy (Zakowski et al., 2001; Sweeny, 2012). It is 
somewhat disappointing that we identified only maladaptive emotion regulation and coping, 
suggesting strategies in which people should not engage but not those in which they should. 
However, these findings are similar to other studies of coping with COVID-related stressors 
(e.g., Joshi et al., 2021; Zacher & Rudolph, 2021) and reflect the broader coping and 
emotion regulation literature in which maladaptive strategies are more easily identified and 
appear to be stronger predictors of distress (Aldwin, 2007; Park et al., 2022).

Limitations and Future Directions

Limitations of our study should be noted. At baseline, participants had already experienced 
the start of the pandemic. Ideally, future research on wide-ranging stressors like the 
COVID-19 pandemic would capitalize on ongoing studies for prospective analyses (e.g., 
including measures of anxiety pre-pandemic). Our sample of MTurk workers may not 
comprise a nationally representative sample of Americans; they may have been, on average, 
less diverse and higher in socioeconomic status than the entire US population (Walters et 
al., 2018) and therefore more protected from some pandemic stressors (Thomas et al., 2022). 
The observational longitudinal design, while allowing modeling of temporal ordering, does 
not permit causal inferences. Clearly, more assessments over longer timeframes will be 
necessary to fully understand resilience and recovery trajectories (Bonanno et al., 2010); the 
present results may not generalize to anxiety levels of trajectories in subsequent years of 
coping with the pandemic, such as with the subsequent surges of infection reported in the 
Fall of 2021. To reduce participant burden, some coping measures were abbreviated (e.g., 
Brief COPE) and thus may have had suboptimal psychometric properties; in addition, other 
types of emotion regulation and coping not included in the study (e.g., mindful acceptance) 
might have predicted additional variance in anxiety.

In spite of these limitations, our results provide suggestions for subsequent interventions to 
improve individual coping and emotional regulation strategies in highly stressful experiences 
that may reduce anxiety. In particular, excessive cognitive focus on stressors in the form 
of catastrophizing should be minimized, yet avoiding dealing with them through behavioral 
disengagement and using substances is also unhelpful. Perhaps reappraisal, seeing situations 
in a more positive light, is a way to navigate these stressful situations that, while not directly 
helpful, does not appear to increase anxiety levels. There is evidence that coping efforts 
that suspend negative appraisals of events and one’s reactions to them are associated with 
decreased rumination and worry (Farb et al., 2014). One such way to cope with stress

in these situations might be through more mindful acceptance—that is, facing situations 
and seeing events and the emotions they elicit without judging or trying to change them 
(Arch & Landy, 2015; Naragon-Gainey et al., 2017). The development and testing of these 
interventions in the context of ongoing, community-wide stressors is thus a promising future 
direction.
