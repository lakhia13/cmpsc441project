Abstract

Background: Because psychological variables are known to intercorrelate, the goal of this investigation was to
compare the unique association between several well-established psychological constructs in pain research and
pain-related outcomes. Sex differences are considered because pain is experienced differently across sex groups.

Methods: Participants were 456 consecutive chronic pain patients attending a tertiary pain clinic (mean age = 58.4
years, SD = 14.8, 63.6% women). The study design was cross-sectional. Psychological constructs included personality
(NEO-Five Factor Inventory), irrational thinking (General Attitudes and Beliefs Scale), and coping (Social Problem
Solving Inventory). Outcomes were pain severity and interference (Brief Pain Inventory) and physical, general, and
mental health status (Short Form-36). To decide whether the bivariate analyses and the two-block, multivariate
linear regressions for each study outcome (block 1 = age, sex, and pain severity; block 2 = psychological variables)
should be conducted with the whole sample or split by sex, we first explored whether sex moderated the
relationship between psychological variables and outcomes. An alpha level of 0.001 was set to reduce the risk of
type I errors due to multiple comparisons.
Results: The moderation analyses indicated no sex differences in the association between psychological variables
and study outcomes (all interaction terms p > .05). Thus, further analyses were calculated with the whole sample.
Specifically, the bivariate analyses revealed that psychological constructs were intercorrelated in the expected
direction and mostly correlated with mental health and overall perceived health status. In the regressions, when
controlling for age, sex, and pain severity, psychological factors as a block significantly increased the explained
variance of physical functioning (ΔR2 = .037, p < .001), general health (ΔR2 = .138, p < .001), and mental health
(ΔR2 = .362, p < .001). However, unique associations were only obtained for mental health and neuroticism (β = −
0.30, p < .001) and a negative problem orientation (β = − 0.26, p < .001).
Conclusions: There is redundancy in the relationship between psychological variables and pain-related outcomes
and the strength of this association is highest for mental health status. The association between psychological
characteristics and health outcomes was comparable for men and women, which suggests that the same
therapeutic targets could be selected in psychological interventions of pain patients irrespective of sex.

Background
Chronic pain is defined as a recurrent of persistent pain
that lasts longer than 3 months [1]. Current estimates of
this disease range from 20 to 30% globally [2, 3] and this
disease has become one the leading causes of sick leave
and physical disability both in the United States of
America and Europe [4, 5]. Unfortunately, projections of

future prevalence of this disease are not more encour-
aging. As life expectancy rises, we are experiencing a
change in the age distribution of our populations
towards the elderly [6]. Because the prevalence of this
disease increases to up to 73.5% for people over 65 years
old [7], the ageing of the population is likely to have
important implications for chronic pain. Due to its high
prevalence, the annual costs of chronic pain has been
estimated to exceed those of other major chronic dis-
eases, such as heart problems, cancer, and diabetes [5].

In addition to these economic consequences of the dis-
ease, the onset and chronification of pain has an import-
ant impact on the quality of life of individuals, with
more than 30% of patients in specialized centres meeting
criteria for severe depression [8]. As a consequence of
the above, chronic pain has become a major health chal-
lenge for our societies worldwide and research is needed
to improve its current management [9].

to the severity of

Traditionally, pain had been considered to be a sensory
experience in which the amount of tissue damage was
proportional
the disease. However,
decades of research have evidenced that chronic pain can
only be understood within a biopsychosocial framework
[10]. Consequently, pain is now defined as a multidimen-
sional “distressing experience associated with actual or po-
tential tissue damage with sensory, emotional, cognitive,
and social components” [11].

treatment has

As a result of this new approach to pain, the inclusion of
psychological factors is now frequent in the pain literature
[12–14] and psychological
increasingly
gained ground as a major non-pharmacological treatment
for chronic pain [15–17]. While this has contributed to a
better understanding of the disease, a limitation of existing
research is that an overwhelming array of psychological fac-
tors associated with pain is now available, but the specific,
independent contribution of each psychological
factor
remains unclear. This is important because psychological
variables tend to correlate with each other [18, 19], so this
overlap between constructs might be leading to redundancy
or misleading decisions in current treatments and psycho-
logical models of pain.

Thus, the goal of the present study is to explore the
unique association of a number of well-established psycho-
logical factors in the pain literature, namely personality,
coping, and maladaptive forms of thinking, such as cata-
strophizing and self-criticism [12, 20, 21], in relation so
several pain- and health-related outcomes in a sample of
chronic pain patients. Importantly, the study will account
for sex differences. This is essential because both the
experience of pain and health status, as well as the role of
psychological factors appear to be sensitive to sex. For
instance, women appear to be more sensitive to pain and
display more negative responses to it, engage in pain
behaviour for longer periods of time, and are more likely to
focus on the negative emotions associated with pain, argu-
ably due to higher levels of catastrophizing and neuroti-
cism [22–25], as well as biological sex differences related to
the immune system [26–28].

Despite the aforementioned sex differences revealed in
the pain literature, the extent to which treatments and
mechanisms of change differ for men and women re-
mains unclear [29]. In fact, popular pain models like the
Fear Avoidance Model of pain or the Psychological
Flexibility Model of pain [30, 31] still tend to ignore sex

as a contributor to the pain experience. By comparing
the unique association between important psychological
factors and the pain experience while considering sex
differences, we aim at shedding some light in this regard.
Specifically, we expect to find important communalities
(i.e., correlations) between the psychological constructs in-
cluded in the study (i.e., personality, coping, and beliefs
like catastrophizing and self-criticism), so that unique as-
sociations will be rare. Additionally, we hypothesize that
women will present a different psychological profile than
men (i.e., higher neuroticism, catastrophizing, and nega-
tive coping), which will help understand higher mental
distress and higher physical disability in this population.
Finally, we expect to find sex differences when exploring
the unique association between psychological variables
and study outcomes, so that stronger relationships will be
revealed in women.

Methods
Procedure
Participants were consecutive patients attending the Pain
Clinic of the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital in Barce-
lona (Spain), which is a public, tertiary referral hospital
with an area of influence of more than 400,000 residents.
Patients were contacted by letter a month before their
first medical appointment. The letter included the evalu-
ation protocol together with an explanation of the study
goal, its procedures and associated risks, as well as the
contact information of the lead researcher, C.S.R. All
participants completed the informed consent and ques-
tionnaires at home and returned the documents to their
doctor the day of their medical appointment.

Participants
Over a period of 4 years (from early 2012 to late 2015) we
contacted 2127 individuals. Of these, 513 patients (24.1%
of the contacted patients) agreed to participate and com-
pleted the protocol. Difficulties in writing or reading,
together with the high number of questions included in
the protocol were cited as main reasons for not participat-
ing. Further information on participants who declined to
participate at this stage could not be collected.

In addition to this, the protocol was not complete for
57 of the 513 patients (11.1%). To facilitate the read-
ability of the text and to minimize the risk of response
bias due to small variations in each analysis as a result
of different
samples, only those individuals with
complete information for all variables (n = 456) will be
used in the analysis. To discuss the generalizability of
findings and possible biases, we will compare their
characteristics, when available, with those of the non-
completers.

Measures
Personality
Several models of personality exist, but the Five Factor
Model (FFM) of personality is the most integrative and
widely used model
including
chronic pain [14]. The FFM describes five bipolar dimen-
sions, which are neuroticism, extraversion, openness to
experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. High
scores in neuroticism are associated with a tendency to
experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression
and anger or worry. Extroverts tend to be active, talkative,
enthusiast and energetic. Openness to experience defines
individuals with a great variety of interests, who tend to be
curious, original and sensitive to art. High scores in agree-
ableness are obtained by altruist, careful and cooperative
individuals. Finally, conscientiousness refers to achieve-
ment, diligence and hard-work in the positive pole [33].

The FFM of personality was measured with the NEO-
Five-Factor-Inventory (NEO-FFI; [33, 34]). In the NEO-
FII, individuals are asked to rate the degree to which
they agree with 60 statements (12 per scale) using a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from 0 = “totally disagree” to
4 = “completely agree.” Scores for each scale range from
0 to 48. The NEO-FFI has adequate psychometric prop-
erties (0.66 < α < 0.81; [34]). The internal consistency in
our sample was also good (0.69 < α < 0.84).

Maladaptive beliefs
The General Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (GABS; [35]) is con-
sidered to be the gold standard measure of maladaptive be-
liefs, as it assesses cognition rather than behaviour [36] and
considers the four irrational forms of thinking proposed by
Albert Ellis [37, 38]. These are demandingness (i.e., inflexible
requirements expressed in terms of ‘have to’, ‘musts’, ‘shoulds’,
or ‘oughts’), catastrophizing (i.e., anticipating, focusing, and
ruminating about the most negative consequences of an
event), low frustration tolerance (i.e., evaluating certain cir-
cumstances as unbearable), and self-downing (i.e., a
tendency to be excessively critical with oneself.

The present study used a shortened version of the
GABS [21], the GABS-SV, which has 24 irrational items (6
for each scale). Participants are asked to rate their degree
of agreement using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging
from 0 = “strongly disagree” to 4 = “strongly agree”, so
scale score range is 0–24. A reduced version of the GABS
has been previously used [39], where its scales showed
moderate to good levels of consistency (0.59 < α < 0.70).
Internal consistency estimates in our sample were ad-
equate (0.67 < α < 0.86).

Coping
The Social Problem solving Inventory – Revised (SPSI-
R; [40]) assesses the way individuals cope with real-life
problems. It differentiates two components of coping:

problem orientation and specific strategies used when
solving problems. The former reflect the person’s ap-
praisal of problems and differentiate a positive orienta-
tion (i.e., a view of problems as achievable challenges)
from a negative orientation (i.e., appraisal of problems as
unsolvable situations). Problem orientations are argued
to lead to the use of certain strategies, namely planning
and solution-testing (i.e., rational problem solving, pro-
crastination (i.e., avoidance style), or rushed behaviour
(i.e., impulsive-careless style; [41, 42]).

The short version of the SPSI-R has 25 items, 5 for
each scale. Participants are asked to rate their degree of
agreement on a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 means “to-
tally disagree” and 4 “completely agree”. Therefore,
scores for each scale can range from 0 to 20. All five
scales of the short version of the questionnaire have
been reported to have a good internal consistency
(0.73 > α > 0.86; [43]), which is congruent with scores in
our sample (0.68 > α > 0.82).

Health
Physical, general, and mental health status were assessed
with the Short Form-36 Health Survey [44, 45]. In the
questionnaire, physical aspects of health include the ability
to perform daily activities (physical functioning) and work-
related activities (role physical), and the average intensity
of pain in the last 4 weeks (bodily pain). Some components
refer to both physical and mental health status, namely the
perception of present and future health (general health),
vitality (i.e., the evaluation of personal energy), and social
functioning (i.e., the interference of health problems in
interpersonal life). Role emotional (i.e., the interference of
emotions on functioning), and mental health (i.e., overall
perception of psychological well-being) mainly reflect
psychological and mental aspects of health [46].

Two composite scores of physical and mental health can
be obtained for physical and mental health using the
aforementioned subscales, which reduces the number of
statistical comparisons [45]. However, the use of the phys-
ical functioning and general health scales was preferred in
the present study. First, because pain intensity had already
been measured with a numerical rating scale, which is a
more frequent practice in pain research. Additionally, be-
ing unemployed or retired is very frequent in pain samples
[47], including the present, which makes the role physical
scale less relevant. The mental health component will be
used as the measure of perceived mental well-being. All
three scales (i.e., physical functioning, general health, and
mental health) are standardized to have a 0–100 range.
Higher scores indicate better health. The psychometric
properties of the questionnaire are good (0.78 < α < 0.94;
[44]). The internal consistency was also good in our sam-
ple (0.75 < α < 0.92).

Pain severity and interference
We assessed current pain severity and interference by
means of a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (“no
pain/interference”) to 10 (“worst possible pain/interfer-
ence”) based on the Brief Pain Inventory [48, 49]. This in-
strument is widely used in the assessment of chronic pain
and has become a standard tool [50]. The SF-36 also in-
cludes a scale on pain intensity (bodily pain); however, this
only evaluates average pain intensity in the last 4 weeks,
which might differ from current pain ratings and both are
frequently defined as separate assessment domains [51].

Data analysis
First, we performed a series of descriptive analyses dif-
ferentiated by sex on our study variables. In doing so, we
calculated their sex differences using Student’s t-tests.
Differences between males and females will be expressed
as Cohen d’s as study variables have different units.
Completers and non-completers will be compared using
a Chi-square (for sex) and a Mann-Whitney U-test (for
age and pain severity and interference) due to the
reduced sample size in the non-completers group and
the violation of assumptions for parametric tests. The
remaining characteristics could not be compared due to
missing information in the non-completers condition.

Next, an analysis of moderation was performed to ex-
plore whether heterogeneity of associations between psy-
chological variables and pain and health status existed as
a function of sex. Testing an interaction is preferred to
direct stratification because in the latter, the lack of as-
sociation in one sex (or in both) could be the conse-
quence of a reduced power in one or both strata (doi:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.09.012.) [52].

To end, a series of Pearson correlations and multivariate
regressions were conducted to explore both the bivariate
and multivariate relationship between psychological vari-
ables (personality, problem solving, and irrational beliefs)
and pain- and health-related factors (pain intensity and
interference and physical, general, and mental health).
Both in the bivariate and the multivariate analyses, the
analyses will only be conducted independently as a func-
tion of sex when the previous moderation analyses
revealed a significant moderation effect of sex. In all other
cases, the whole sample will be used.

The multivariate linear regression analyses were per-
formed to explore a health model using psychological vari-
ables and controlling for the role of age, sex, and pain
severity. Each pain- and health-related factor was used as
a dependent variable (i.e., pain severity and interference,
physical functioning, general health, and mental health),
while age, sex, pain severity, and psychological measures
were the independent variables. In a first block, we in-
cluded age, sex, and pain severity. Psychological factors

were added in the second block. Pain severity was not
used as a covariate when pain severity was the outcome.

Because independent variables were expected to be
significantly correlated, we calculated multicollinearity
problems in all regressions by means of the Variance In-
flation Factor (VIF). The typically suggested thresholds
of 5 or 10 were used to determine multicollinearity
problems [53]. To reduce the risk of type I errors due to
the large number of statistical analyses performed and to
minimize unimportant associations, the critical alpha
level for significance in the study will be set at 0.001.

Some patients only completed part of the evaluation
protocol due to its length. The analyses will be conducted
with the sample of patients will complete data (n = 465).
Otherwise, it would be hard to identify whether a response
bias was introduced due to small variations in each
analysis due to different samples for some variables. To
discuss the generalizability of findings, the characteristics
of the completers’ sample will be compared against those
of the non-completers, when available.

The statistical program IBM SPSS Statistics version 22

was used to perform all data analysis [54].

Results
Demographic characteristics of the sample and
comparison with non-completers
The completer’s sample included 456 participants (63.6%
women). Their mean age was 58.4 years (SD = 14.8, age
range = 18–89). Most participants had not completed their
secondary education (54.1%) and were not working at the
time of assessment (68.1%). More than half of the sample
was married or in a relationship (60.7%). Most frequent
diagnoses were low back pain (58.6%), neck pain (9.1%),
post-surgery pain (5.6%), and osteoarthritis (5.4%).

Completers and non-completers were comparable in
terms of sex distribution (χ2 = 0.513, p = .474) and pain
severity (U = 11,360.5, p = .169), but non-completers
tended to be older in age (U = 9333.5, p < .001, mean age
for non-completers = 65.21 years, SD = 14.06).

Sex differences in psychological factors and health
outcomes
Our analyses revealed sex differences in pain intensity and
physical functioning only, both in favour of men (Table 1).
All differences were between small and medium (d between
.30 and .39). Male-to-female differences in pain interference,
pain duration, perceived general health, mental health, and
psychological characteristics (i.e., personality, coping, and
beliefs) were all non-significant at an alpha level of 0.001.

Sex differences in the association between psychological
factors and pain and health outcomes
As seen in Table 2, none of the interaction terms in
moderation analysis indicated a significantly different

association between predictors (i.e., psychological vari-
ables) and outcomes (i.e., pain and health status) as a
function of sex (all p values were larger than .001). Con-
sequently, further analyses were not segregated by sex.

Bivariate associations
Pearson correlations were calculated altogether for men
and women (Table 3). Results revealed that several psy-
chological constructs were significantly intercorrelated.
Overall, these correlations were between weak and moder-
ate. In general, we found extraversion and conscientious-
ness to be positively intercorrelated and significantly
associated with so-called positive psychological constructs
(i.e., a positive problem orientation and rational problem
solving), while negatively linked with arguably negative
psychological variables (i.e., neuroticism, a negative prob-
lem orientation,
impulsive-careless style, avoidant style,
and all forms of irrational thinking except for demanding-
ness). The opposite direction of associations was revealed
for neuroticism.

Table 3 also shows the bivariate associations between
psychological variables and study outcomes (i.e., health
scales and pain intensity ratings). Overall, psychological
factors were more strongly associated with perceived gen-
eral health status and mental health than with physical
functioning, pain severity, and pain interference. Specific-
ally, neuroticism, a negative problem orientation, avoidant
coping and impulsive coping, catastrophizing, frustration
intolerance, and self-downing correlated to poorer per-
ceived general health status and mental health (−.19 ≤ r ≤
−.57, all p < .001), while positive associations with both
outcomes were revealed for extraversion, conscientious-
ness, a positive problem orientation, and rational coping
(.16 ≤ r ≤ .30, all p < .001). Only openness (r = .15, p < .001),
a positive (r = .16, p < .001) and a negative problem orien-
tation (r = −.19, p < .001), and avoidant coping (r = −.18,
p < .001) were associated with physical functioning, while
only neuroticism correlated to pain severity (r = .15,
p < .001) and interference (r = .22, p < .001).

Unique associations between psychological factors and
pain and health outcomes
The multivariate regressions revealed that psychological
factors, as a block, added significant variance to the pre-
diction of mental health status (ΔR2 = .352, p < .001) and
overall perceived health (ΔR2 = .166, p < .001) above and
beyond age, sex, and pain severity levels (Table 4). Neur-
oticism (β = − 0.30, p < .001) and a negative problem
orientation (β = − 0.26, p < .001) were the only factors
significantly linked to mental health status when con-
trolling for all the covariates and the remaining psycho-
logical constructs, while no psychological variable was
uniquely and significantly associated with general health
status. Psychological variables failed to add significant
variance to the prediction of physical functioning, pain
severity, and pain interference. Only pain severity was
uniquely associated with physical functioning (β = − 0.38,
p < .001) and pain interference (β = 0.69, p < .001).

In the regressions, all VIF values were found to be

lower than 4, indicating no multicollinearity problems.

Discussion
The current investigation had a focus on comparing the
role of important psychological factors that are known to
be associated with the pain experience, taking sex differ-
ences into account. As revealed in previous research,
results in the present investigation indicated significant
associations between psychological variables and pain and
health outcomes [10], as well as sex differences in some
health characteristics [22, 25]. Unique to the present study
is that redundancy exists in the relationship between psy-
chological variables and pain- and health-related outcomes.
Most importantly, the association between psychological
factors and pain and health outcomes was not sensitive to

sex. Research in the past decades has repeatedly supported
the multidimensional nature of the pain experience, which
is now understood as an interplay between biological, psy-
chological, and social factors [10]. This new approach to
pain has resulted in an explosion in the number of psycho-
logical factors that have been argued to play a role in the
experience of pain. The present study replicated existent
findings, supporting the important association between
psychological factors and health status in pain patients
[55]. On the one hand, we found a number of psychological
factors to be negatively related to health status, namely
neuroticism, some coping variables (i.e., a negative problem
orientation and impulsive-careless and avoidant strategies),
and all irrational forms of thinking (i.e., demanding, cata-
strophizing, low frustration tolerance, and self-downing).
On the other hand, associations between psychological
factors and positive outcomes were also replicated, thus re-
vealing an arguably positive role of extraversion, conscien-
tiousness, a positive problem orientation, and rational
problem-solving in the pain experience.

A contribution of the present investigation to the lit-
erature is the analysis of sex differences in the relation-
ship between the aforementioned psychological variables
and pain and health outcomes. Contrary to our expecta-
tions, the association between psychological factors and
outcomes was comparable for men and women. While

the literature has revealed biological and psychological
differences in the experience of pain between men and
women [22–28], our study indicates that these differences
are not likely to extend to how psychological factors are
associated with pain and health status. In a period when
cost-effective interventions are considered an urge [56], a
comparable associations between psychological variables
and pain and health outcomes for men and women is im-
portant as it supports the implementation of mixed, group
psychological interventions. In fact, group interventions
including both men a women is a frequent practice in
chronic pain psychological treatments [57]. The present
study findings suggest
that segregating psychological
interventions as a function of sex would not be justified in
terms of how psychological factors are expected to impact
on outcomes as a function of sex.

Another strong point of the present study was the com-
parison of several psychological factors that are important
in the pain experience, namely personality, coping, and ir-
rational thinking, to explore their unique association with
pain and health status when controlling for the association
of the others. As predicted, we found psychological con-
structs to be intercorrelated, which resulted in a reduced
number of unique associations in our regression analyses.
This is important because the reduction of key interven-
tion targets to a more manageable set might serve guide

psychological treatments in a more effective way (i.e., sim-
plifying treatments to crucial elements). Specifically, our
investigation revealed that neuroticism and a negative
problem orientation are likely to be relevant factors to
understand the mental well-being of pain patients above
and beyond other psychological characteristics.

On the one hand, neuroticism has become a matter of
public health concern [58] and a goal of the new generation
treatments for emotional problems, such as the transdiag-
nostic treatment for emotional disorders [59, 60]. Our
results suggest that this should be the case in chronic pain
too. While personality traits are quite stable constructs,
there is evidence to suggest that changes in personality
occur during the lifespan [61] and some encouraging exam-
ples of successful psychological treatments changing per-
sonality already exist [62–64], so future studies in chronic
pain should address neuroticism as a key factor to be
included in psychological treatments for pain.

On the other hand, a negative problem orientation is
viewed as narrow and rigid form of coping [65], which is
frequently associated with poorer health status [66]. The
study of problem solving and problem orientation in

pain settings is not new and, decades ago, there was a
call for cognitive-behavioural
interventions in chronic
pain to include problem solving into existent programs
[67]. Problem solving has also been tested in other pop-
ulations, such as patients with personality disorders [68],
individuals with severe disabilities [69], and caregivers
[70, 71], among others. To date, however, the majority of
treatment programs in chronic pain fail to incorporate
problem solving [72–75] and existent models of pain
behaviour, such as the Fear Avoidance Model of pain or
the Psychological Flexibility Model of pain [30, 31], tend
to ignore problem solving. The present study suggests
that, compared to other psychological variables, a nega-
together with neuroticism,
tive problem orientation,
might be important target outcomes in psychological
interventions for chronic pain patients.

An interesting result in the present study was that the
contribution of psychological factors was stronger for
psychological (i.e., the mental health) or a combination
of psychological and physical outcomes (i.e., perceived
general health), as opposed to the more physical dimen-
sions of health (i.e., pain intensity and interference and

Suso-Ribera et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes          (2019) 17:128

physical functioning). This is a frequently finding in the
pain literature and is consistent with studies showing
that psychological treatments are more likely to impact
positively on psychological well-being than on pain re-
ports [15, 57, 76, 77]. While this might be interpreted
as a limitation of psychological treatments, it might as
well help guide interventions in a more effective man-
ner (i.e., prioritizing psychological treatment when the
goal is to reduce of psychological symptoms as opposed
pain levels).

the list

The present study certainly has limitations. Study de-
sign was cross-sectional, so the mechanisms underlying
the revealed associations remain speculative and causal
inferences should be made with caution. For instance,
the study of the relationship between physical function-
ing and psychological constructs as a function of sex is
likely to be “a chicken and egg situation”, in which cor-
relational studies cannot shed light on whether sex dif-
ferences are due to differences in physical functioning,
psychological characteristics, or other factors. Addition-
ally, despite we included a number of important psycho-
logical constructs that are present both in the pain and
the health literature in general,
is far from
complete. A more comprehensive list, however, would
require even larger sample sizes, especially if sex-
sensitive studies are to be conducted. Despite this, the
goal of the present study was not to compare the contri-
bution of all psychological factors that have been investi-
gated in pain settings, but to shed some light on the
communalities between psychological factors in the con-
tribution of health outcomes and the important role of
sex in such associations. Another study refers to both
the specificity of the sample used (i.e., adults with het-
erogeneous pain characteristics, but mostly musculoskel-
etal pain) and the fact that a large number of individuals
approached by letter (more than 75% of them) were not
willing to complete the protocol, mostly because they
found it
too time-consuming and demanding. This
points out to the need to reduce assessment protocols
and the importance of developing psychometrically-
sound, shortened versions of existing questionnaires that
maximize participation rates by reducing burden, spe-
cially of older participants (i.e., note that non-completers
were found to be older). Other strategies, such as con-
ducting assessments onsite and compensating partici-
pants are also frequent procedures, but were not feasible
in the present investigation. Finally, it is important to
note that comorbidities, which are known to be frequent
in chronic pain patients [78], were not investigated in
the present investigation. Therefore, sex differences in
comorbidities, as well as the association between comor-
bidities and outcomes and the association of psycho-
logical factors with outcomes while controlling for the
role of comorbidities could not be investigated.

Conclusions
the present
investigation revealed that
To conclude,
psychological
factors share significant variance in the
prediction of outcomes in pain settings, thus supporting a
preference for parsimonious and integrative models of
health as opposed to complex models that include a wide
array of presumably unrelated psychological factors. The
list of psychological factors present in the pain literature is
now very extensive [79] and it is about time that treatment
targets are reduced to a more manageable list. The present
study is a step in this direction. Additionally, the present
study had a focus on personalizing pain treatments by
exploring whether there was preliminary support for a
differential association of psychological factors and health
outcomes as a function of sex. Different to previous re-
search suggesting that sex differences may be important in
the experience of pain [29, 56], our study supports target-
ting the same psychological factors for both men and
women with chronic pain. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no research that has tested the effect of adapting
psychological treatments for pain according to sex differ-
ences. In the light of our findings, segregating by sex might
not be a necessary practice in psychological interventions
for chronic pain, which is likely to make treatments more
cost-effective (i.e., by facilitating the creation of groups irre-
spective of the sex characteristics of patients seeking treat-
ment).
