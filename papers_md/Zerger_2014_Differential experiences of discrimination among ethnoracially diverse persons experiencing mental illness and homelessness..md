Abstract

Background: This mixed methods study explored the characteristics of and experiences with perceived
discrimination in an ethnically diverse urban sample of adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness.
Methods: Data were collected in Toronto, Ontario, as part of a 4-year national randomized field trial of the Housing
First treatment model. Rates of perceived discrimination were captured from survey questions regarding perceived
discrimination among 231 ethnoracially diverse participants with moderate mental health needs. The qualitative
component included thirty six in-depth interviews which explored how individuals who bear these multiple
identities of oppression navigate stigma and discrimination, and what affects their capacity to do so.

Results: Quantitative analysis revealed very high rates of perceived discrimination related to: homelessness/poverty
(61.5%), race/ethnicity/skin colour (50.6%) and mental illness/substance use (43.7%). Immigrants and those who
had been homeless three or more years reported higher perceived discrimination on all three domains. Analysis
of qualitative interviews revealed three common themes related to navigating these experiences of discrimination
among participants: 1) social distancing; 2) old and new labels/identities; and, 3) ? homeland? cultures.
Conclusions: These study findings underscore poverty and homelessness as major sources of perceived
discrimination, and expose underlying complexities in the navigation of multiple identities in responding to
stigma and discrimination.

Background
Toronto is home to the largest cohort of homeless people
in Canada, with over 5,000 people literally homeless on
any given night and approximately 28,000 different indi-
viduals using homeless shelters each year [1]. Toronto is
also one of the world? s most multicultural centres, with
half of its population born outside of Canada, and nearly
as many half (49%) describing themselves as belonging
to a visible minority [2]. Newcomers represent two-
thirds of the population growth in Canada over the past
decade, and it is projected that by 2031, 78% of persons

[3]. Visible minorities, immigrants and refugees in Canada
are especially vulnerable to becoming homeless [4-7] and
homelessness, in turn, is a cause and consequence of com-
plex health, mental health, and addiction problems [8,9].

Experiences with stigma and discrimination are dis-
tressingly common for individuals who are visible mi-
norities, homeless, and/or have a mental illness [10-16].
Negative consequences of stigma and discrimination are
well-documented, particularly negative physical and
mental health outcomes, the latter at least in part due to
delay or avoidance of treatment [11-13,17-27]. Increas-
ingly, researchers have taken into account the effects of
multiple domains on discrimination experiences, such as
mental illness, race, gender, age, physical disability, and

sexual orientation. They have typically concluded that
compound effects result in even worse health outcomes,
and that all of these domains are important contributors
when looking for effective interventions or, as one author
put it, the ? capacity of the individual to resolve?
the nega-
tive impacts of discrimination [28] (see also: [15,29-34]).
Yet while acknowledging that discrimination can be based
on multiple domains of difference, the literature largely
assumes an additive, not an intersectional, effect.

Most of these primarily US-based studies also lack
multicultural samples and employ quantitative mea-
sures of discrimination prevalence. And while income
and neighborhood poverty are occasionally included as
potential factors affecting perceived discrimation, home-
lessness and immigration status are rarely considered.

In part because immigrants tend to experience housing
instability in the form of residential crowding - sometimes
called ? hidden homelessness? - literature exploring their
experiences with literal homelessness is scant [35,36].
However, some recent studies from Canada have assessed
the physical and mental health of homeless immigrant
populations [11,37-40], and a few qualitative studies
have explored the experiences of homeless women,
youth and families, including immigrants [41-44]. One
Ontario qualitative study looked at factors affecting
discrimination among homeless mothers with mental
illness, and noted but did not pursue the finding that
? issues newcomers faced?
tended to compound the bar-
riers for these women [42] p.691. A more recent Canadian
study asserted the need for a better understanding of
? how discrimination and its health effects are differen-
tially experienced? by immigrants and refugees [45], p.1557.
Authors of a review of discrimination and stigma mea-
sures related to mental illness note a gap in understanding
how non-Western cultures experience mental
illness
stigma [46]. On the whole, much remains unknown
about the relative prevalence of discrimination due to
homelessness and immigration status, the factors asso-
ciated with that prevalence, and especially about how
multiple identities interact and inform experiences of
stigma and discrimination.

This mixed method study takes advantage of a unique
study sample with an ethnically diverse group of indivi-
duals who are experiencing homelessness and mental
health problems to address some of the gaps in the
literature. A key purpose of this study is to explore how
individuals who bear multiple labels and identities of
oppression including being homeless, an immigrant, a
racialized minority, and having a mental illness, navigate
stigma and discrimination ? and what affects their capacity
to do so. Specifically, this study addresses three research
questions: 1) What is the prevalence of perceived discri-
mination due to homelessness/poverty, race/ethnicity, and
mental health/substance use in an ethnically diverse

sample of homeless people with mental illness? 2) What
sociodemographic characteristics are associated with
perceived discrimination? And, 3) How do multiple
identity characteristics interact and inform experiences
of discrimination?

Methods
Given the lack of quantitative data on perceived discrim-
ination based on poverty and homelessness, and our
interest in qualitatively exploring the interplay between
identities in multiple social locations simultaneously, we
determined that a mixed methods approach would be
most appropriate to address our research questions. This
study uses data collected in Toronto as part of a 4-year
national randomized field trial of the Housing First model
for persons experiencing homelessness and mental illness.
Details about this national trial - ? At Home/Chez Soi?
have been published elsewhere: [47,48].

Study sample
In Toronto, At Home/Chez Soi participants were recruited
from its extensive network of organizations serving people
experiencing homelessness, including shelters, drop-in
centres, community health centres, hospitals and crim-
inal justice programs. Eligible participants were 18 years
or older, absolutely homeless or precariously houseda, had
a severe mental illness with or without a co-occurring
substance use problem, and were not currently receiv-
ing assertive community treatment or intensive case
management.
Individuals not meeting these criteria
were ineligible for the study, as were those who were
not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, refugee or
refugee claimant at the time of enrollment. Targeted
recruitment strategies, published elsewhere [47], ensured
the final sample was representative of the ethno-racial
diversity of Toronto and characteristic of its homeless
population. From the total sample of 550 participants in
Toronto, for the purposes of this study we examined the
subsample of 231 who identified as racialized minorities
and rated as ? moderate need?
for mental health servi-
cesb. For the qualitative component we used purposeful
sampling methods; field coordinators identified 36 indi-
viduals who were most willing and able to reflect on
their experiences. All of those identified agreed to par-
ticipate in an in-depth interview.

Sample description
Three-quarters of the qualitative subsample (n = 36)
interviewed were male and just over half (55%) were
younger than 40 years. Two-thirds had completed at
least high school. One-third were born in Canada; the
remainder were born in 19 different countries (see
Table 1 footnote). Two-fifths had spent three or more
years living homeless. Just over one-third were diagnosed

tics were similar to the larger sample (n = 231), though the
latter included slightly fewer males (66% compared to
75%) and lower educational achievement overall (55%
completed high school or more, compared with 66% in
the subsample) (Table 1).

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board
(REB) at St. Michael? s Hospital, Toronto. At Home Study
participants were recruited between October 2009 and
June 2010; they provided written informed consent and
were compensated for their participation. Separate REB
approval was obtained for the qualitative interviews; par-
ticipants signed a separate consent form and received
additional compensation of $25 cash and transportation
costs for in-person interviews conducted between No-
vember 2010 and July 2011.

Data sources
Quantitative
We use findings from discrimination questions included
in the baseline interviews with the sample of 231 ethnora-
cial moderate needs participants. Specifically, participants
were asked whether they had ? experienced discrimination
or been treated unfairly by others in Canada? due to:

ethnicity, race, skin colour, language, accent, religion,
gender, sexual orientation, appearance, mental health,
use of alcohol or drugs, homelessness, or poverty. We
grouped participants according to whether they per-
ceived experiencing discrimination due to (i) homeless-
ness or poverty, (ii) mental health or use of alcohol or
drugs, and (iii) race or ethnicity or skin colour. Selected
demographic variables, adapted from the 2006 Census of
Canada, were also collected and used to describe these
two samples, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview 6.0 (MINI 6.0) was used to assess and describe
mental health and substance use disorders [48].

Qualitative
A trained researcher conducted in-person interviews,
lasting between 34 and 90 minutes, with the subsample of
36 ethnoracial moderate needs participants. The semi-
structured interview protocol was designed to probe for
experiences with intersecting dimensions of homelessness,
illness, race and gender or any other possible
mental
forms of discrimination or stigma; for example, after
general questions about discrimination experiences with
homelessness, participants were asked to reflect whether/
how their mental health status, ethnicity, or gender may

have influenced those experiences. Though asked gen-
erally about being ? treated unfairly,?
the concepts of
discrimination and stigma were not explicitly defined,
as the intent was to better understand how the inter-
viewees conceived of and described experiences associ-
ated with these identities. Though interpreters were
available, all chose to conduct their interviews in English.
All interviews were audio-taped and transcribed.

Analytic strategies
Quantitative
SPSS 20.0 software was used for the quantitative ana-
lysis. Descriptive statistics,
including frequencies and
means, were used to describe both study samples. Cross-
tabulations and Pearson Chi Square tests and Fisher? s
Exact Test for cell sizes fewer than 4 were used to assess
statistically significant differences of categorical demo-
graphic variables on perceived discrimination.

Qualitative
We used data analytical techniques of grounded theory
to analyze transcribed interview text. Specifically, we
used coding and comparative analytic inductive proce-
dures to de-contextualize and re-contextualize individual
cases and experiences [49]. This iterative process led to
increasingly abstract conceptual categories which helped
to expose the data and patterns within it [50]. The re-
search analyst first conducted line-by-line open coding
during a thorough read of the transcripts to identify key
concepts,
then progressively transformed codes into
higher level categories by using a constant comparative
method of analyzing and grouping similar codes into
conceptual categories (? axial? coding). A constructionist
stance guided the process, which meant the focus was to
identify latent thematic schema, as opposed to semantic
or descriptive [51]. A team of qualitative analysts com-
pared several coded transcripts to ensure consistency
at regular intervals throughout this process. NVivo 9.2
software facilitated the coding and thematic analysis
process, and memo notes were used to track emerging
codes. To enhance rigor, the researcher kept a journal to
track and address potential assumptions or biases, and
listened to audio-tapes after coding to gain contextual
insight that may have been missed in the transcribed
version.

Quantitative
Perceived discrimination findings
Perceived discrimination among study participants is
very high, with 61.5% reporting perceived discrimination
due to homelessness or poverty, 50.6% due to race,
ethnicity, or skin colour, and 43.7% due to mental health
problems or alcohol/drug use. Nearly three-quarters of
the sample (73.6%) reported perceived discrimination on
at least one of these domains (Table 2).

Univariate analysis showed that age, gender, education,
employment status and the diagnosis of psychotic dis-
order were not related to any of the three domains of
perceived discrimination. (See Additional file 1) Individ-
uals who experienced discrimination in any of the three
domains showed statistically significant difference in
terms of their ethnic or cultural identity: more than half
of those who experienced each form of discrimination
identified their ethnicity as Black. Individuals who re-
ported perceived discrimination due to homelessness or
poverty and due to mental health or alcohol/drug prob-
lems had significantly lower monthly income compared
to those who did not report any of these types of dis-
crimination. Individuals born outside of Canada were
more likely to report perceived discrimination compared
to their Canadian-born counterparts, and this pattern
was significant across all three forms of discrimination.
Individuals who experienced discrimination of any of the
three forms were more likely to have been homeless for
three or more years (χ 2 (1, N = 170) = 8.80). We ob-
tained similar results (not reported) by testing each form
of perceived discrimination against the group which did
not experience any type of discrimination.

Qualitative
A note on perceived discrimination experiences
All of those interviewed described being stigmatized due
to their differences, ranging from appearance (traditional
ethnic dress, unkempt clothing due to living on the street,
skin colour), to behaviors (typically associated with mental
illness or substance use). And most had encountered
discrimination, primarily when seeking jobs or housing,
or interacting with law enforcement or service providers.

Participants? subgroup identities are inextricably linked
as they intersect with perceptions of, and experiences
with, stigma and discrimination. These individuals
certainly do not perceive themselves nor experience
discrimination categorically: as one woman commen-
? I would get put down because not only am I
ted,
brown but I? m a woman that? s out on the streets.?
However, this qualitative component is focused not on
documenting or describing these experiences, but ra-
ther on uncovering how their multiple interlocking
identities affect these experiences. A companion article
from the At Home/Chez Soi study, published else-
where, explored the perceptions of discrimination in
healthcare settings among this populaion [52].

Varied effects of social distancing Even when social
distancing was not a direct result of stigma, and even
when it was deemed necessary for recovery to progress,
it had myriad negative effects which entrenched partici-
pants further into poverty and homelessness. For example,
it cut off important sources of emotional or instrumental
support, created and/or exacerbated depression or other
mental health problems, and reinforced a lack of trust in
others, thus hindering engagement with social services.
All of them understood and felt the negative conse-
quences; one articulated it this way: ? I really kept myself
isolated most of the time. So by doing so I lost contacts, I
lost maybe job opportunities, maybe some encouragement
which maybe I could have got from?

friends.?

Theme: Social distancing
A recurrent theme in participant narratives described
social distancing, the reasons underlying it, and its im-
pact on coping and recovery.

Reasons for social distancing Interviewees described
distancing themselves from family and friends because
of the stigma associated with their experiences of home-
illness. One man said home-
lessness and/or mental
? I stopped trusting
lessness made him feel worthless:
anyone. I? m isolating myself;? another discussed avoiding
contact to ? hide? his mental illness: ? I tried to be isolated
from anyone, so no one can know that I? m sick.?

Nearly all of those who immigrated as adults addition-
ally described distancing themselves from family and
friends in their home country, declaring they had not
informed them about their homelessness or, if diagnosed
in Canada, their mental illness. They spoke about the
shame of being homeless or mentally ill, of feelings of
failure to meet social norms and expectations and not
wanting to ? disappoint?
their family.
Typical comments included: ? I don? t want my mom to
get depressed and worry about me;? and ? I just didn? t
want to have to put them through that.?

? worry? or ? disturb?

Many Canadian-born respondents also talked about so-
cial distancing, not trusting others, and not wanting to
cause worry or be a burden; however, their families and
friends were more apt to know about ? and in some cases
had played a direct role in - their pathways to homeless-
ness and/or mental health problems. Several noted that
their family members were also poor and busy trying to
survive. Some avoided family members or friends who
were substance abusers or triggers for their mental health
problems as a means to aid in their own recovery.

Female interviewees were more apt to talk about social
distancing as a survival technique. As this woman ex-
? I don? t get myself involved in any situation I
plained:
can? t come out of?

I stay by myself.?

to your sister?

run to your father?

Among foreign-born interviewees, the profound sense
of being alone reinforced their helplessness about finding
a way out of their predicaments. As one man commented:
? What else can you do. You are here in a foreign land.
You can? t?
to your
mother to talk about it. The only person maybe is a case-
worker, who gives you an appointment.? Yet while distan-
cing and self-isolation impeded access to critical supports
in Canada, it also served as a means to protect and retain
such support from family/friends abroad. Many described
their family as key to their survival: for example, ? when I
remember them?
I find there is something in my life I can
live for.? By not revealing their experiences of homeless-
ness and/or mental illness to those most important to
them, they were able to project a more positive self-image,
prevent additional stigma, and retain emotional support.
This recent immigrant explained why he distanced himself
from his family: ? I didn? t want to scare them, because I
was their strength. My children, and my wife, they knew I
was their hero.?

illness,

Summary Discrimination and stigma associated with
being homeless or having a mental
led all of
these participants to distance themselves from family
and friends, and experience profound loneliness and loss
of critical supports. The motives and effects of social dis-
tancing, however, varied within and among subgroups:
for example, women tended to talk about it more as a
tool of survival than as a means of avoiding shame, and
recent immigrants distanced themselves from family and
friends in their homelands to protect loved ones and re-
tain meaningful emotional supports.

Theme: Old and new labels
Another recurring theme was the qualitatively different
ways that those interviewed described experiences with
the three kinds of discrimination we asked about: race/
ethnicity, mental
illness, and homelessness. Being a
person of colour is an ? old label? : race discrimination
was something participants were familiar with; they had

grown up experiencing and learning to ignore or other-
wise cope with ?
that is, racism was nothing new. Ac-
quiring a diagnosis of a mental
illness or becoming
homeless, on the other hand, were mostly ? new labels?
and identities which required new ?
and pressing ?
internal negotiation to determine how it fit or did not
fit with who they are, and thus how they would respond
to stigma or discrimination based on them. Though this
theme held for all participants, there were again differ-
ences between foreign- and Canadian-born participants.

? Old labels? Asked dir-
Race/Ethnicity/Skin colour:
ectly about any experiences they might have with dis-
crimination based on their colour or race, most of the
immigrants in this sample said they had not experienced
it at all since arriving in their new country. These re-
sponses were frequently tied to their perceptions of
Canada and the multicultural context of Toronto, as
? I heard from
illustrated by the following comments:
my friend ..[that] there is no discrimination here;? and,
.?
? I never got any racial discrimination that I knew of ?
These perfunctory assertions, though, belie the reality
that they were simply accustomed to race discrimin-
ation in its many forms and had become inured to its
for example:
inevitability. Their comments included,
? my upbringing was already training me to deal with
racism;?
It doesn? t bother me because I grew up with it,
I know how to deal with it;? and, ? it used to bother me,
but after you see something?
repetitive after like, after
five, ten years, you? re like, yeah, whatever.?

While Canadian-born participants were more apt to
mention specific experiences of race discrimination, a
few talked about it as becoming more insidious. As one
woman put it, ? it? s changing forms now?
it? s something
more sneaky.? Yet they too were much more apt to focus
on stigma associated with mental illness or homelessness.

Homelessness and mental illness: New labels Most
expressed reactions to being diagnosed with a mental
illness and/or becoming homeless in dramatic,
life-
altering terms: ? I was kind of shocked? , ? it was just this
overwhelming feeling? ; ? oh, it ruined my whole life? ; and,
? mental health kind of just snatched me out of my life.?
Several initially reacted with denial: ? I didn? t believe it?
I
said I? m normal, I just had some stability issues? ; and, ? I
couldn? t believe that I was sick.? Similarly, many?
espe-
cially foreign-born participants ?
described becoming
homeless as completely new and confusing: ? it was totally
new, totally new;? and ? it was something all of a sudden
and something that I? ve never heard about.?

For many respondents, becoming homeless was inex-
tricably linked to their mental illness. One man described
his diagnosis as the reason he was ? put on the streets? ;
another noted his was ? another thing I would have

Asked about experiences with being stigmatized due

identities, they primarily talked
about the process of learning what these new labels had
to do with who they were: ? it was puzzling at first be-

? It? s not you who says that you are homeless. People -

Another commented: ? It just feels like I? m walking but I
don? t feel myself?

half semi-conscious.?

Summary Interviewees described experiences with dis-
crimination associated with race, homelessness, and
mental illness, in qualitatively different ways. Adjusting
to race discrimination was not new, but navigating
stigma associated with mental
illness diagnoses and
homelessness were new and unsettling experiences. For
most, becoming homeless and/or diagnosed with a mental
illness involved an overwhelming sense of failure, loneli-
ness, and sadness, and many blamed themselves, thus
internalizing the stigma they experienced from others.
Participants frequently linked becoming homeless with
illness, but found it
being diagnosed with a mental
easier to mask and avoid the stigma associated with
mental illness.

Theme: ? Homeland? cultures
Another factor that influenced how these individuals
processed ? new label?
identities - homeless and mentally
ill ?
and associated stigmas, was how these were per-
ceived in their culture and/or birth country. Though it
tended to affect recent immigrants more strongly, espe-
cially those with families still in their homeland, it also
affected Canadian-born respondents with relatives or
friends who were still closely tied to their homeland and
its culture.

Mental illness Reactions to stigma associated with men-
tal health diagnoses were shaped by perceptions of mental

illness in the culture of their home country. The words
they used to describe how mental illness was perceived
(e.g. ? outcasts? and ? crazy?
? dangerous? and ? someone
screaming and beating people? ) can be read as a desire
to contrast those perceptions with their personal experi-
ences. One man said in his home country mental illness
meant that ? you? re a crazy person. I couldn? t believe I
was sick? because?

I? m belonging now to ? crazy people.?

some distinctions by country of origin. One man from
Colombia,
for example, described homelessness as a
symptom of an impoverished country where ? a war is
going on?
and people who are living on the street are
treated as ? people that need help.? A few interviewees
from Jamaica noted the importance of family members in

? they tend to think,

health symptoms and issues in Canada tended to be

They don? t take it like it might just be a medical thing.?
Many responded to the cultural dissonance by further
distancing themselves from ? and even blaming - those
individuals and cultural organizations which had previ-
ously been important sources of support. For example,
one man who had immigrated to Canada as a boy blamed
his inability to communicate with his parents about his
experiences with depression (and treatment) on his cul-
tural roots:? They don? t understand what? s a mental ill-
ness.? Another man avoided taking medications to
control symptoms because his priest suggested they
came from ? a Satanic source? he thought I had evil
spirit inside me.? Though he took communion as ad-
vised, his condition worsened; he subsequently avoided
church, which had been an important source of support
for him. A young woman raised primarily in Canada
said her otherwise supportive parents ? kind of knew?
she had ? mental
issues? but did not seek psychiatric
help, and did not believe in medications, because, ? [back
home] they think of it in spiritual terms, not medical?
so I think culture does play a huge role.?

Homelessness Similarly, many respondents used very
strong language to describe how people from their home-
land/culture perceived homeless people: ? like a dog that
doesn? t have an owner? No home, no hope;?
really don? t talk or sit with that person;?
? you can die in
the street, just like an animal;? and, ? someone who doesn? t
deserve help.?

? people?

This perception clashed with their personal experi-
ences: ? [People back home would say] you came to the
it? s a land of opportunity, so you should be able
west ?
to better yourself? but it? s actually hard to make money.?
Another said he had assumed homelessness was some-
thing that ? happened to orphans or those with difficult
not to someone from a ? decent fam-
family relations?
ily?
like his; he therefore struggled when others would
? look at you like it? s your fault that you? re homeless.?

Though negative stereotypes of homelessness were
mostly consistent across all respondents, there were

Summary Cultural perspectives and beliefs played an
important role in how these individuals interpreted and
adjusted to their newfound statuses as ? mentally ill?
and/or ? homeless? and the associated stigma and dis-
crimination they experienced. Many coming to terms
with a medicalized understanding of mental illness and
the reality of living homeless reacted to cultural disson-
ance by distancing themselves from their cultural origins.

Discussion
Perceived discrimination was very common among this
ethnically diverse urban sample of 231 homeless individ-
uals with mental illness, especially perceived discrimin-
ation due to homelessness and poverty. Those who had
spent three or more years without stable housing in their
lifetime, and those who were foreign born, were espe-
cially likely to report discrimination due to homeless-
ness/poverty, to mental health/substance use, and to
race/ethnicity/skin color when compared with those
with less experience living homeless and Canadian-born
individuals.

As noted previously,

literature on the prevalence of
discrimination due to homelessness and poverty is
scarce, especially in samples of homeless adults, so it is
difficult to say how these findings compare to other
samples. One study, for example, found 53% of a sample
of 1,824 individuals with severe mental illness experi-
enced some form of discrimination; this included 51.5%
due to ? economic circumstance? and 21.5% due to home-
lessness [30]. About a third of a sample of 500 Black and
419 Latino active substance users in another study re-
ported discrimination due to poverty (38% of Black; 26%
Latinos) [53]. Finally, about one-third of 523 individuals
living with HIV-AIDS in temporary housing reported
experiencing discrimination due to homelessness, but
was specific to health-care settings [54]. While these
examples suggest our finding of 61.5% experiencing per-
ceived discrimination due to homelessness or poverty is
high, the samples described above are all US-based with
limited racial diversity, and are not directly comparable.
Our findings led us to explore, with a subgroup of 36
participants, factors which affected how they perceived
and experienced stigma or discrimination associated
with their race, homelessness, or mental illness, and to
focus more closely on immigrants in our sample. We

identified three overarching themes: social distancing;
old and new labels; and ? homeland? cultures. Addressing
multiple identities allowed for an exploration of the
complexity of these participants? experiences, and helped
identify the unique effects of culture and newcomer status.
All of these participants distanced themselves from
friends and family due to shame and the stigma of being
homeless and/or diagnosed with a mental illness. Aspects
of this theme recur in the literature: social-isolation can
be both a consequence and a survival mechanism for indi-
viduals experiencing homelessness [55,56], and stigma
associated with mental
illness is shown to undermine
social connectedness [57]. In the present study, those born
outside of Canada tended to consider their family ? back
home? as essential to their survival yet were least apt to
communicate with them about their struggles and despair.
The physical distance, and having control over when/how
communication occurred, meant that even if they could
not give financial support, they could at least protect loved
ones from worrying, and maintain aspects of much needed
positive self image. This finding suggests the importance
of understanding social distancing as a nuanced reaction
which may vary for subgroups.

Study participants spoke very differently about dis-
crimination due to race than discrimination due to
homelessness and mental illness. The latter were ? new
labels? which required them to internally negotiate
what these identities meant for them, and were most
disarming. The stigma of being homeless roused espe-
cially deep shame; unlike race, homelessness is situ-
ational and subject
for
change, and unlike mental illness, can be hard to hide
from others. The role and impact of each of these
labels/identities is discussed in the literature, but this
study suggests they can have very different meanings
and roles depending on social context, and should not
be analyzed in isolation [58].

least some potential

to at

Finally, the perceptions of mental illness and home-
lessness in participants? homeland or culture affected
how they interpreted and adjusted to these new labels.
Some research has tied cultural belief systems to mental
health, though it remains predominantly focused on first-
world countries [59]. Our study found participants from
cultures that do not medicalize mental illness were less
likely to seek/find empathy from family/friends both at
home or within their local ethnic communities. Similarly,
a recent study found in some countries which lacked
mental health services there was a ? lack of a perceived
norm? about mental health, and this served as a barrier
to service access for some first-generation U.S. immi-
grants [60]. The present study, though, found that dis-
crimination experiences were especially distinct for those
participants most closely tied to a culture or homeland
outside of Canada, regardless of their immigration status

or length of time residing in Canada. That is, this study
suggests cultural ties play a larger role than birthplace in
shaping experience of discrimination, and would be an
important factor in a more systematic investigation.

Interest in examining discrimination along multiple
domains is growing, yet remains limited to two or three
social categories; more diverse study samples and alter-
native frameworks, such as intersectionality, should be
applied to ensure a comprehensive understanding of
how social classifications mutually ? depend on each
other for meaning and, thus, mutually construct one an-
other and work to shape outcomes [61].? As illustrated
with this study, the processes with which multiple iden-
tities interact in shaping how stigma and discrimination
are experienced and negotiated are nuanced and com-
plex. A description of one of the participants? situations
illustrates this: This man immigrated to Canada as a
boy, sponsored by his uncle. When his uncle died from a
heart attack a few years later, he ? had no one to guide?
him and became homeless. ? When I became homeless it
had an effect on my mental health ?
I was very de-
pressed, I was sad all the time, I was hopeless. That? s
why I became suicidal once. So they took me to the psy-
chiatric hospital.? His depression led him to stop talking
to his family and friends (? I isolate from everyone? ). He
felt shame from the stigma about his homelessness and
believed his family - living abroad ? would not understand
his homelessness or his mental illness. His homelessness,
his race, his immigrant status, and his depression ? when
combined with social distancing, discrimination, stigma
and misfortune - all hindered his capacity to exit home-
lessness. To neglect any of his social categories/identities,
or even to focus on one more than on others, would be
to lose critical meaning of his experience and, therefore,
an understanding about how best to support him. As
one author noted, ? to focus on a single dimension in the
service of parsimony is a kind of false economy [61],
p.179.? As importantly, shifting from a traditional addi-
tive approach ?
e.g. an individual with two minority
statuses experiences more discrimination than someone
with one ?
reveals the complex processes in which
social categories and locations shape discrimination
experiences and individuals? reactions to them.

Study limitations
This study? s limitations included: 1) Participants in this
study all reside in Toronto, Ontario. While the uniquely
multi-ethnic context made it possible to recruit
the
diverse sample for this study, it may have ameliorated
effects of some of the racial discrimination these partici-
pants experienced. 2) Purposive sampling methodology
meant restricting the sample to those willing and able to
reflect on their experiences. And, although interpreters
were available, all respondents opted for interviews in

English [this also occurred in a qualitative study with
homeless mothers [42]]. We thus did not explore discrim-
ination due to language as distinct from race/ethnicity,
although it did not arise even among study participants
with limited English proficiency. 3) Experiences with dis-
crimination and stigma were based on self-reports and
perceptions, so it is not possible to verify specific examples
given; however, perceived discrimination itself has been
linked to detrimental outcomes [12].

Conclusions
This study revealed very high rates of perceived discrimin-
ation among ethnoracially diverse persons experiencing
homelessness and mental illness, and exposed underlying
complexities in the navigation of multiple identities in
responding to stigma and discrimination, particularly for
immigrants and others closely tied to countries of origin.

Becoming literally homeless, and/or of being newly
diagnosed with a mental
illness, had a profoundly
devastating impact on the lives of study participants.
Future research should not only heed the enormity of
these causes for discrimination, and explore key ele-
ments in service delivery that might support coping
and resilience, but also strive to disentangle the com-
plex effects these identities have on various subgroups;
as this research revealed, for example, reactions trad-
itionally seen as negative (such as social distancing)
can have important positive consequences for women
and for individuals with social support systems living
abroad.
