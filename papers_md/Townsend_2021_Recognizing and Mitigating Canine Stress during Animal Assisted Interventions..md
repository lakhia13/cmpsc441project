Abstract: Animal-assisted Interventions (AAI) proliferated rapidly since clinicians and researchers
ﬁrst noted the positive effects animals have on people struggling with physical and mental health
concerns. The intersection of AAI with the ﬁeld of animal welfare evolved from considering animals’
basic needs, such as freedom from pain, to recognition that animals experience nuanced emotions.
Current conceptualizations of the various roles of companion animals as an adjunct to treatments
for humans emphasize not only the animals’ physical comfort and autonomy, but also their mental
well-being and enjoyment of AAI activities. However, numerous challenges to effective monitoring of
animals involved in AAI exist. This article focuses speciﬁcally on dogs, highlighting factors that may
lead handlers and therapists to miss or ignore canine stress signals during human-animal interactions
and offers strategies to recognize and ameliorate dogs’ distress more consistently. The primary
goals of this discussion are to summarize the current thinking on canine well-being and to highlight
practical applications of animal welfare principles in real-world AAI settings. The paper highlights
contextual factors (e.g., physical setting, patient demand), human inﬂuences (e.g., desire to help), and
intervention characteristics (e.g., presence or absence of a dog-speciﬁc advocate) that may promote
or inhibit humans’ ability to advocate for therapy dogs during AAI activities. Deidentiﬁed examples
of each of these factors are discussed, and recommendations are provided to mitigate factors that
interfere with timely recognition and amelioration of canine distress.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we describe the multiple contexts in which animal-assisted interventions
(AAI) take place, as well as the numerous challenges to effective monitoring and response to
canine stress that handlers and providers face. We summarize current evidence regarding
canine emotions, cognitions, and stress signaling, and highlight factors that inhibit timely
detection of canine stress. We provide case examples that contextualize these factors in
“real world” scenarios and provide practical strategies for alleviating canine stress and
enhancing dogs’ enjoyment of animal-assisted interventions.

Humans have long known the beneﬁts animals can have on physical and psychological
recovery. During the Roman Empire, healers noted that the presence of animals uplifted
people who were suffering; Florence Nightingale and Sigmund Freud observed similar
dynamics between animals and their patients [1]. Animal-assisted interventions and
research regarding their application and efﬁcacy proliferated following Boris Levinson’s
description of the beneﬁcial effects of his dog, Jingles, on his therapeutic work with
children [2].

2. Terminology and Settings

Knowledge regarding the characteristics of and settings in which animal-assisted
activities take place is essential to ensuring the welfare and comfort of animals who partici-
pate. Additionally, the use of a single, agreed set of terms allows for clear communication
and transparent sharing of information. The International Association of Human-Animal
Interaction Organization (IAHAIO) deﬁnes Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA) as “informal
interactions/visitations often conducted on a volunteer basis by the human-animal team
for motivational, educational, and recreational purposes.” Activities are conducted by
individuals who are not required to have education in health or human services and there
is no speciﬁc intervention goal that guides the interaction [3]. In contrast, Animal-Assisted
Therapy (AAT) “is a goal oriented, planned, and structured therapeutic intervention directed
and/or delivered by health, education, and human service professionals.” Speciﬁed inter-
vention goals guide the interactions, and client progress is documented [3]. Animal-Assisted
Education (AAE) “is a goal oriented, planned and structured intervention directed and/or
delivered by educational and related service professionals.” AAE activities further aca-
demic, social, or cognitive goals [3]. Animal-Assisted Crisis Response (AACR) teams undergo
specialized training and screening for suitability to intervene during crises, which can be
characterized by environmental unpredictability and emotional intensity [4]. National
standards were developed to ensure that handlers and dogs meet minimum standards for
training, health, and well-being [5]. Each of the settings described above (AAA, AAT, AAE,
and AACR) are characterized by unique goals and attributes that directly impact animal
well-being as well as pressures that inﬂuence handler recognition of stress signals from
their dog.

Evaluating Therapy Dogs

AAI organizations strengthened their emphasis on assessing whether an animal enjoys
interacting with people and participating in animal-assisted activities. IAHAIO formally
incorporated animal well-being into their guidelines, noting that AAAs “should only be
performed with the assistance of animals that are in good health, both physically and
emotionally and that enjoy this type of activity” [3]. At least two major U.S. therapy dog
registration programs (Pet Partners and Alliance of Therapy Dogs) now include animal
willingness to engage in interactions with humans as an essential element of their therapy
dog evaluations. Pet Partners’ training program underscores the YAYABA (“You are Your
Animal’s Best Advocate”) concept, which symbolizes the vital role that handlers play in
providing for their animals’ well-being at all times during animal-assisted activities [6,7].
The concept of “goodness of ﬁt” has been applied to the process of choosing dogs with specific
temperaments, preferences, and energy levels that are aligned with the contexts in which
animal-assisted activities occur [8]. To best evaluate a therapy dog’s willingness to engage in
interactions with others, we need tools to evaluate their willingness to be involved.

3. Advancements in Animal Welfare: From Basic Needs to Nuanced Emotions

As the role of animals in therapeutic work with humans expanded, provisions for
the welfare of animals engaged in AAI became increasingly necessary. Early focus on
animal welfare considered only the basic needs of livestock (freedom from hunger/thirst,
discomfort, pain/injury/disease, fear and distress, and the freedom to express normal
behavior) [9]. Advances in understanding of animal cognition and behavior prompted
recognition that dogs are capable of complex reasoning [10] and experience complex
emotions [11], including empathy [12]. Acknowledgement that dogs experience an array of
emotions must catalyze efforts to ensure that therapy dogs are not simply “used” as tools for
service delivery, but instead are treated as sentient beings who experience the advantages
and disadvantages of their therapeutic roles similar to their human counterparts.

4. Recognizing Canine Stress, Enjoyment, and Enrichment

A primary role of the therapy dog handler is to monitor and provide for the animal’s
well-being. This involves simultaneously monitoring canine stress signals, maintaining
awareness of the environment, creating circumstances the dog ﬁnds rewarding, and inter-
acting with people who receive animal-assisted services. Dogs communicate stress in a
variety of ways, and as described below, some of that communication is extremely subtle.
Generally, dogs progress from milder indications of distress, such as paw lifting, to more
obvious signs that can include growling, snapping, or biting [13]. Expressions of stress can
be unique to every dog, necessitating that handlers know their animals well and take the
time to familiarize them with the therapy environment. Scientiﬁc evaluations of canine
stress must be multimodal, evaluating multiple behavioral and physiological parameters
when possible [14].

Although scientiﬁc understanding of canine enjoyment is nascent, mounting evidence
suggests that dogs experience and communicate pleasure. Signs that a dog ﬁnds an
activity or environment enjoyable include a relaxed posture, open mouth, and movement
toward the interaction or activity [15]. Biological studies demonstrate improvements in
neuroendocrine parameters (increases in plasma β -endorphin, oxytocin, prolactin, phenyl
acetic acid, and dopamine) and blood pressure in both humans and dogs following brief,
positive interactions [16], suggesting that interactions between humans and dogs can be
associated with emotional and physiological beneﬁts for both species.

As understanding of canine cognition and emotions has grown, attention has in-
creasingly turned toward enriching the lives of our canine companions. Neurobiological
evidence indicates that enrichment is associated with decreased hippocampal neuron loss
in aging dogs [17]. Enrichment was also associated with increased social responsiveness
and decreased problem behaviors in shelter dogs [18]. Enrichment ideally should include
a wide array of social and sensory experiences, including novel activities, interactions
with people and other conspeciﬁc animals, as well as taste, olfactory, and auditory sensa-
tions [19].

5. Canine Stress Signals

Dogs exhibit a variety of behaviors that communicate stress and distress. Interpreta-
tion of these stress signals is paramount to adequately prepare and then advocate effectively
for the well-being of dogs involved in AAI. Studies of dog owners indicate that humans
frequently miss subtle signs of canine stress even in their own dogs [20]. Interpretation
of canine stress signals can be clouded by a number of factors, including breed-speciﬁc
morphological differences in facial and body features, handler familiarity and relationship
with a particular dog, and individual differences in how dogs are reinforced or aversively
conditioned for expressions of distress. In addition, context matters. The meaning of a
yawn may differ dramatically when it occurs near bedtime in a dog’s home than when
it occurs during an AAI session [21]. Timely and responsive advocacy requires that hu-
mans maintain familiarity with the communication patterns of the breeds with which they
are working, their dogs’ normative behavior, and how their dogs communicate distress.
Early stress signals can be quite subtle, necessitating that handlers remain attuned to their
dogs throughout all animal-assisted interactions. We will brieﬂy highlight some, but not
all, of these nuanced stress signals in dogs below:

5.1. Avoidance

Dogs who feel hesitant or uncertain about a situation demonstrate subtle indicators of
avoidance. These include looking away, lifting a paw, exerting pressure against the handler,
or actual hiding [15]. Subtle displacement behaviors like snifﬁng or yawning are frequently
ignored or misinterpreted by handlers. During a human-animal interaction in a busy
environment, avoidance and displacement signals may go unnoticed, disregarded, or
actively discouraged by the handler, to compel the dog to engage with the human.

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

5.2. Fear

Dogs who progress beyond avoidance into fear exhibit more dramatic, recognizable
stress signals. These may include elements of avoidance such as looking away and leaning
away from the interaction, as well as additional physical signs such as bracing their hind
legs, ﬂattening their ears, lowering their heads, and tucking their tails [15]. If dogs are
unable to obtain relief from the feared stimulus and feel trapped, they may progress toward
displays of aggression [15].

5.3. Gaze

Dogs subtly communicate with humans via directed gazing and will seek information
from their owners and even strangers regarding the safety of ambiguous stimuli [22].
Behavioral ratings suggest that dogs with insecure attachment to their handlers may gaze
more at them during mock AAI sessions than dogs with secure attachment, although
these ﬁndings were signiﬁcant only at the trend level [23]. Other studies demonstrate
that therapy dogs’ gaze is preferentially directed toward their handlers during therapy
sessions [24]. Further research is needed to appreciate the communicative role of canine
gaze more fully, and it is possible that gaze intent and duration may vary across dog
breeds. For example, Border Collies were bred to herd ﬂocks of sheep and it is believed that
they stare at individual sheep as a form of intimidation to encourage the sheep to move
in a speciﬁc direction [25]. In a study examining gaze duration in three breeds of dogs,
Retrievers were found to gaze signiﬁcantly longer at human faces than German Shepherds
or Poodles [26].

5.4. Freezing

Dogs may freeze when they attempt unsuccessfully to avoid a threatening situation.
Freezing is characterized by postures that reduce body size and protect vulnerable areas of
the body. One goal of freezing is to minimize visibility; another is to deliver a calming signal
to other beings, animal or human. These behaviors can be viewed as last efforts to avoid
conﬂict and frequently precede overt aggression [27,28]. Freezing is often accompanied by
difﬁculty responding to environmental cues, including handler commands [27].

5.5. Aggression

Aggressive behavior itself might seem self-evident; however, initial displays of de-
fensive aggression in dogs can go unnoticed in a busy context and may not be recognized
easily by humans [29]. Initial signs of aggressive arousal include raised hackles, closed
mouth, alerting (attending to the stimulus), and targeting (staring at a chosen stimulus) [15].
Left unaddressed, the circumstance could progress to overt aggression, which includes
growling, barking, lunging, air snapping, and even biting [30].

5.6. Animal Assent/Dissent

Although dogs cannot verbally express their consent to interact with humans, they
do express “assent and dissent” [30] through body language and behavior. Unfortunately,
many humans assume that dogs welcome physical touch and interaction and misread
signs of dissent. The “canine consent test” [31], suggests that humans approach dogs
using a nonthreatening, sideways stance while gently offering an open palm near the
animal’s chest. A dog who remains motionless or moves away is communicating dissent.
One who moves toward the proffered hand and initiates physical contact is communicating
willingness to be touched. This consent test provides a useful method for determining
whether a dog is willing to interact with people at a given time. Handlers can advocate
for their dogs by gently instructing others about how best to approach them. Allowing
dogs to provide consent and honoring their desire to dissent and move away from an
interaction strengthens the handler-dog bond and models positive relationships for clients
participating in the interaction [32].

6. Contextual Factors That Contribute to Stress in Dogs
6.1. Physical Setting
6.1.1. Crowds

Dogs performing AAI are often asked to navigate environments in which many people
are present. Even when they are conducting one-on-one interactions (e.g., in a private
therapy session), they may be asked to walk through or wait in a crowded waiting room
beforehand. Dogs in busy hospital environments may spend time in bustling corridors or in
elevators with multiple people squeezed into a small space. Crowded areas typically give
rise to elevated noise levels and may be characterized by balloons, music, small children
moving quickly, emergency responders, and many other stimuli. Crowded locations are
often accompanied by more trafﬁc or construction on the drive to the location and/or near
to the destination bringing additional sounds (truck or bus engines, horns, etc.), smells
(exhaust fumes), and delays (creating pressure to hurry).

6.1.2. Classroom

Educational settings often involve multiple people, including children of various
developmental ages and abilities. Children’s behavior can be loud and spontaneous,
especially if they are young. Dogs participating in AAE are often the central feature of a
learning activity and can be surrounded by children who all want to interact with the dog
at the same time. Many children were not taught the appropriate way to interact with a
dog, making the dog vulnerable to rough handling such as ear- or tail-pulling, hugging,
or other behaviors likely to stress the dog. Very young children may not understand that
dogs should not eat puzzle pieces, or that legos should not be inserted into the dog’s ear,
or that touching the dog in a sensitive area could be painful or startling to the dog.

6.1.3. Hospital

Dogs who serve in hospital environments may be exposed to a variety of sensory
experiences such as smells associated with bodily ﬂuids or cleaning agents, sights and
sounds of medical equipment, rapidly moving health care workers, throngs of people,
and humans displaying intense emotions. It is possible that medication may accidentally
be dropped on the ﬂoor, or a patient’s meal may be served while the dog is in the room.
Circumstances may change rapidly, escalating from a quiet, calm interaction to intense,
urgent activity. Many hospitals are located in dense, urban environments, necessitating
that the dog walk along crowded city streets near heavy trafﬁc, the hectic movements of
people, and construction.

6.1.4. One-to-One Visit

Visits with individuals may offer a quieter, calmer environment for human–animal
interaction; however, these visits are characterized by their own unique stressors. A therapy
dog may be conﬁned to a small room or ofﬁce space with a closed door which creates
a feeling of conﬁnement. Dogs may be exposed to atypical physical behavior and the
expression of intense emotions depending on the client’s presenting problem. In some
cases, clients may attempt to hug and hold the dog while they express their emotions, but
this behavior may be alarming and uncomfortable to the dog.

6.1.5. Noise and Urgency Level

Different therapeutic environments operate at different paces. A quiet, one-on-one
therapy session might be slow-paced and calm, with little sense of urgency. In contrast,
a busy hospital environment is characterized by sudden, fast-paced activities, such as staff
responding quickly to a medical emergency.

6.2. Canine Characteristics
6.2.1. Fatigue

Dogs’ tolerance for stress may change depending on the activities in which they
engage and how physically and emotionally taxed they feel. Many organizations do not
impose time limits on visit length, while others limit duration to one or two hours [30].
Fatigue affects many aspects of canine functioning, including cognition and frustration
tolerance. Extending visits beyond a dog’s fatigue point can impair their ability to respond
to cues and tolerate frustration.

6.2.2. Aging

A dog’s age may differentially impact their response to therapy situations. An older
dog may be more accustomed to the sights and sounds of a therapy environment; however,
he or she might become more easily fatigued. In comparison, a younger dog may feel
more stressed by the novelty of the therapy environment but will likely be more resilient
to fatigue.

6.2.3. Physical Health

A national survey of therapy dog organizations demonstrated that the majority require
regular veterinary checks for registered dogs as well as recommended health checks if an
animal exhibits signs of illness [30]. Advancements in illness identiﬁcation began to incor-
porate observations of subtle animal communication. For example, animals experiencing
the onset of illness are known to change posture and to selectively inhibit some feeding
and social behaviors before clinical symptoms become apparent. These behavioral indi-
cators are predictive of illness onset in many species [33]. Maintaining routine veterinary
wellness checks combined with awareness of these subtle illness indicators in dogs and in
a handler’s own dog offer the opportunity to proactively advocate for canine well-being in
the context of AAI.

6.2.4. Workload

The amount of time spent working in an AAI setting exerts a strong inﬂuence on
a dog’s stress tolerance. If a dog has worked signiﬁcantly more than usual, he or she
may be more likely to exhibit signs of stress during an AAI interaction. Workload is
especially relevant for dogs involved in AACR, which can involve travel to disaster sites
and a prolonged period of intense interaction spanning several days [34]. Handlers need
to closely monitor their dogs for signs of stress and establish a workload that is well within
their own dog’s tolerance. It is also critical to continually monitor the dog for any signs
that the current workload may have become too challenging so that the workload can be
adjusted to better meet the dog’s needs.

6.2.5. Trigger-Stacking

Trigger-stacking occurs when a dog undergoes multiple stressors without adequate re-
turn to baseline. This phenomenon can lead to the appearance of “unpredictable” behavior,
such as growling or refusing to engage in an activity; however, many canine stress-related
behaviors can be anticipated with thorough understanding of their antecedents. Trigger-
stacking can occur over short or extended periods of time, depending upon the intensity
and duration of the stressor [35,36]. For example, a dog who travels to an unfamiliar
location for a family vacation may experience many stressors that are simply part of the
fun for his or her humans. Depending upon whether car rides, changes in daily routine,
water sources and unfamiliar housing, and people are stressful to a speciﬁc dog, he or
she may return home unprepared to transition into an AAI visit right away. Conversely,
a dog who has just spent an hour listening to the beep of a smoke alarm with a low battery
may struggle to participate in an AAI session that would normally be easy for him or
her. Physiological stress responses and return to baseline differ for each dog, making it

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

7 of 16

imperative for handlers to maintain awareness of environmental conditions their dogs face
not only the day of an AAI session, but also in the days leading up to that visit.

7. Intervention Characteristics That Contribute to Missed Stress Signals

The speciﬁc nature of an AAI can contribute to, or alleviate, stress and the ability of a

handler to detect it.

7.1. Presence-Absence of Canine Advocate
7.1.1. Diamond Model

The “Diamond Model” of AAI speciﬁcally provides for a handlers’ involvement in a
therapy interaction [37]. Model components include the dog, a handler, the clinician, and
patient(s). The handler assumes primary responsibility for the dog’s welfare during the
session and collaborates with the therapist to ensure that therapeutic activities do not stress
or harm the animal. The clinician assumes primary responsibility for the client. By design,
this model includes a person whose primary responsibility is to ensure the welfare of the
therapy animal and advocate for changes in the therapeutic interaction that address the
animal’s well-being.

7.1.2. Triangle Model

In the Triangle model, which is often employed in outpatient psychotherapy, the
clinician is responsible for the simultaneous well-being of both dog and client [37]. This
arrangement requires increased vigilance on the part of the handler/therapist given that
he or she must continuously monitor their dog and the client for signs of distress. It is
likely that canine stress signaling may be missed more frequently in the triangle than in the
diamond model given the role of divided attention and potentially conﬂicting priorities for
the therapist.

7.2. Intervention Complexity

Variability in the complexity of animal-assisted interventions is well documented in
the literature [38]. Interventions vary widely in the degree of animal involvement, from
simply asking the animal to be present to asking the animal to navigate obstacles or follow
instructions. Individual differences in canine preferences become relevant given that some
dogs may prefer simple, relaxed activities and others might prefer more active engagement
and mental activity. Physical and cognitive overstimulation or boredom may all function
as stressors.

7.3. Schedule and Frequency of Dog Involvement

The demands placed on therapy dogs vary considerably depending upon the client
population, the setting, and interaction goals. Facility dogs accompany their handlers
to work daily and typically remain onsite for eight hours. Other dogs may conduct
hospital visits once or twice weekly, whereas some dogs only work occasionally. A study
that examined canine cortisol production in response to human-animal interactions of
varying durations and intensities found that salivary cortisol concentrations were higher
on therapy days than on nontherapy days and increased following therapy sessions of
shorter duration [39]. Handlers are recommended to adjust the intensity, duration, and
frequency of canine participation to minimize animal distress. For example, high-intensity
sessions should include frequent breaks, and canine participation in these interactions
should be limited in frequency. In contrast, dogs may be involved in longer low-intensity
sessions with less frequent breaks incorporated throughout [40]. Individual dogs vary
in their tolerance for therapeutic interactions, requiring handlers to know their dogs and
judge their participation accordingly.

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

8. Canine Factors

There are inconsistencies among dogs as to what will initiate a stressful response, and

even the same dog may respond differently over time.

8.1. Health Changes

The majority of therapy animal organizations mandate regular veterinary health
checks for their registered dogs [41]. This typically involves yearly health checks and
documentation of vaccination status. However, health conditions may arise between
yearly exams, rendering it vital for handlers to monitor changes in their dogs’ attitudes
and behavior. Relatedly, determining when a therapy dog should retire is fraught with
strong emotion for handlers. There is no single set of criteria for therapy animal retirement
decisions; recommendations include multifactorial health and behavioral observations of
the animal [42].

8.2. Canine Variability in Stress Signaling

The degree to which dogs become stressed by conditions they encounter in their roles
as therapy animals is dependent upon multiple factors, including breed type and genet-
ics [43] and those described earlier (e.g., workload, trigger stacking), but it is important to
keep in mind that all dogs do not follow the same pattern of stress signaling, which can
complicate the identiﬁcation of stress signals in individual dogs. Canine experience and
communication of stress and frustration may be further modiﬁed by training [44]), with
reward-based training resulting in improved canine adjustment and relationships with
humans [45].

Training out of Stress Indicators

Dogs may inadvertently or intentionally become conditioned to accelerate stress
signaling by skipping lower levels of communicative behavior and moving directly to more
overt indicators [46]. Dogs who ﬁnd that mild stress signals, such as snifﬁng, yawning, or
paw lifting, are routinely ignored may resort to task refusal or growling in the face of a
signiﬁcant stressor. These behavioral choices may be inadvertently reinforced by handlers
who only detect and respond to overt signs while consistently missing their dog’s early
signals of discomfort. Some handlers may punish their dogs for demonstrating certain
stress signals, such as pinning their ears back or raising their lips to show their teeth. This
handler reaction may also lead a dog to accelerate their stress signaling, especially if the
handler becomes motivated to relieve the animal’s distress as a response to embarrassing
behavior, such as growling. In these examples, dogs are reinforced for skipping lower-level
stress indicators and moving ahead to employ signals that promise more immediate relief.
The solution to this problem is to take lower-level canine stress signals seriously and
provide relief rather than reinforcing the dog for use of more dramatic, overt stress signals.

9. Human Inﬂuences

Just as individual dogs will vary in their responses to stressful environments, handlers

are differently equipped to respond to those same circumstances.

9.1. Level of Canine Behavior Knowledge and Willingness to Act on Knowledge

Pet owners vary in their knowledge regarding dog behavior and appropriate responses
to canine stress signals [41]. While handlers can be expected to demonstrate greater
knowledge of canine behavior given the training they receive through the therapy dog
registration process [6,7], people vary in their background familiarity with dogs and their
attitudes toward management of canine stress. A handler with many years’ experience
detecting and responding to their dog’s communications is likely to respond more quickly
and effectively than someone who is embarking upon AAI work with their ﬁrst dog.
Similarly, a change in setting brings new challenges to handlers and their dogs, necessitating
that both learn a new environment together. Handlers new to a setting may experience

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

9 of 16

more divided attention than handlers who are more familiar with that environment, causing
them to miss their dogs’ stress signals. Evidence indicates that many owners would beneﬁt
from educational efforts to improve their ability to recognize and react to signs of stress in
their dogs [29].

9.2. Urgency of Problem

Handlers may experience situational demand to meet the needs of people receiving
AAI. Two contexts that may exert such pressure include palliative care and crisis response.
Those settings are characterized by intense emotional need on the part of service recipients
and urgency. These characteristics may inﬂuence handlers to extend their dogs’ working
hours and reduce the frequency of breaks.

9.3. Other Pressures

Programmatic and internal pressures may reduce handlers’ detection of and/or will-
ingness to respond to their dogs’ stress signals. A therapist whose entire practice depends
upon one therapy dog may fear disappointing clients if the animal is ill or overtaxed.
A visitation or educational program with a small team of therapy dogs may place more
demand on each dog to meet service needs than programs with more handler-dog teams.
Humans involved in AAI typically care a great deal about the welfare of other people,
increasing their potential to ignore or rationalize their dogs’ need for downtime.

Recognizing stress indicators and the circumstances and inﬂuences that can trigger
them will improve the ability of handlers to react quickly and in their dogs’ best interests.

10. Speciﬁc Recommendations

Because reading through the indicators and circumstances described above may
not be sufﬁcient to complete a handler’s awareness of dog stress and the complicated
environments in which it can arise, we offer a recommendation for an assessment tool that
can be helpful in evaluating AAA settings, followed by several case studies illustrating
stressful situations and offering resolutions.

10.1. LEAD Assessment

Risk assessment is essential to setting up AAIs for success and preventing stress and
potential injury to human and animal participants. The LEAD (Lincoln Education Assis-
tance with Dogs) Assessment Tool [47] serves as the current best practice standard for risk
assessment in animal-assisted activities, including animal-assisted interventions, education,
and therapy. The tool provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating potential risks
to human and animal participants tailored to speciﬁc environments. Undergirded by a
philosophy of compassion for all human and animal participants, the tool emphasizes
the importance of modeling care and concern for the welfare of animals and advocating
on their behalf when signs of stress are observed. The LEAD tool provides a structured
framework for identifying and mitigating environmental hazards as well as assignment of
mitigation responsibility to predetermined designees. The LEAD assessment framework
is easily adapted for individual dogs in speciﬁc settings and encourages AAI program
leaders, staff, and handlers to anticipate and prevent potential hazards to human and
animal participants.

10.2. Case Examples with Speciﬁc Recommendations and Resources

The following hypothetical examples highlight the complex contingencies that inﬂu-
ence canine stress and handler decision-making during animal-assisted activities. The
vignettes represent an amalgamation of the authors’ observations of canine-human inter-
actions in a variety of therapeutic settings. They are meant to provide food for thought
and to prompt creative thinking about how to adapt activities with animals to mitigate
challenges to their welfare.

10.2.1. AAA

Henry and Pickles volunteer at the Shady Pines nursing home. Pickles is a 5-year-old
French bulldog who enjoys visiting older adults. She particularly enjoys sitting on the
residents’ laps and pouncing on squeaky toys they throw to her. Pickles’ usual behavior on
visit days is to run to the door and turn in circles excitedly when she sees Henry gather her
therapy dog vest and leash. One morning, Pickles walked sadly away from the door and
laid down under the kitchen table when Henry brought out her equipment. Henry tried
to motivate Pickles for several minutes before ﬁnally cajoling her with treats. Henry was
anxious to get to Shady Pines because the residents and staff were celebrating a resident’s
centenarian milestone that day. During the visit, Pickles seemed reluctant to engage with
anyone, licking her lips frequently when she was picked up and placed in people’s laps.
She refused to chase her squeaky toys when they were thrown. Henry felt disappointed
that Pickles was not engaged in the birthday celebration and worried that the guest of
honor would be upset. Over the following two days at home, Pickles began moving stifﬂy,
holding her paw up, and developed difﬁculty jumping onto furniture. When Henry paid
a visit to the veterinarian, he discovered that Pickles had a pulled muscle that required
crate rest. Henry recalled that Pickles played vigorously with his friend’s new puppy the
day before; he suspected she pulled her muscle then. After taking a two-week break from
Shady Pines to recover, Pickles was back to her happy self when they visited again.

This example highlights the pressures handlers face to accomplish speciﬁc goals
during an animal-assisted intervention as well as the subtlety of canine stress signaling.
Henry feared disappointing residents and staff at Shady Pines. In addition, his assumption,
which was usually correct, was that Pickles loves visiting the nursing home. The onset of
Pickles’ muscle soreness was subtle, leading Henry to misinterpret or disregard Pickles’
unusual behavior.

Mitigation strategies in this situation include allowing Pickles to stay home for the day
and continuing to observe her unusual behavior. Henry could have gone to the birthday
celebration at Shady Pines and explained that Pickles was temporarily under the weather.
When Henry observed Pickles’ lack of enthusiasm at Shady Pines, he could have shortened
the visit, explaining that Pickles didn’t appear to feel well and needed to go home. Table 1
presents ways to mitigate stressors associated with a variety of animal-assisted activities.

10.2.2. AAE

Carrie and her dog, Bentley, a 4-year-old Australian Shepherd mix, volunteer in a
special education classroom for ﬁrst graders with developmental disabilities. They have
been working with the kids for about six months and Bentley knows the children well.
A new student, Sam, is introduced into the classroom; Carrie and Bentley meet Sam for the
ﬁrst time when they arrive to help with the classroom reading group. Sam was diagnosed
with Autism spectrum disorder and was working with his occupational therapist to develop
ways of communicating his needs without raising his voice, banging objects, or throwing
things. In addition, Sam struggles with novel environments and changes to his routine.
Sam often responds to change with yelling and demonstrating his discomfort with physical
outbursts. Carrie and the teacher begin the reading group by having the kids take turns
reading to Bentley. Each child sits next to Bentley to read aloud and show him the book’s
illustrations. When the time comes for Sam’s turn, he begins shouting and waving his arms
and throws his book across the room. Bentley licks his lips, puts his head down, and leans
against Carrie’s side. The teacher’s aide quickly distracts Sam by taking him to a small
coatroom adjacent to the classroom, where he sobs loudly and rocks. The teacher signals
for the reading group to continue and the next student seats herself next to Bentley, who
remains pressed against Carrie with one paw slightly off the ﬂoor.

A number of teacher and handler pressures present themselves in this educational
setting. Teachers face a plethora of demands on their time, including responsibility for
multiple students simultaneously and accountability for ensuring that students achieve
learning goals. Bentley is demonstrating clear indicators of stress in response to Sam’s
outburst and continues to communicate hesitance to remain engaged in the reading group.
His compliant, nonaggressive nature led him to quietly ask for Carrie’s support; however,
Carrie faces her own set of pressures to remain engaged in the reading activity. She knows
that most of the students adore Bentley and look forward to seeing him each week. Some
of them disliked reading before they met Bentley, who functions as a strong motivator
for students to read. A few of the students will not read aloud to a human, whereas they
forget their fear and read enthusiastically to Bentley. Carrie fears that disengaging from the
reading group could upset the students and the teacher or make them seem unreliable. She
also does not want to stigmatize Sam for his behavior.

Opportunities for mitigating canine stress while furthering students’ educational goals
exist in this and similar situations. Communication between Carrie and the teacher ahead
of time could forewarn Carrie that Sam may not respond well to Bentley initially. They
could develop an alternate plan for introducing Sam to Bentley. Additionally, the teacher
could communicate with Sam’s occupational therapist so that gradual exposure to a dog
could be incorporated into his treatment plan. When Sam began to exhibit distress that
affected Bentley, Carrie could have suggested that Bentley take an exercise break outside
for a few minutes before returning to the reading circle. From a programmatic standpoint,
close collaboration between the teacher and handler could enhance canine well-being
and student safety as well as provide enhanced learning opportunities for the students.
Learning activities that combine skills acquisition and addressing canine and student safety
could include recognizing the meaning of human and canine nonverbal communication
and practicing how to pet a dog safely [48]. These concepts could be incorporated as a fun
element of a social skills curriculum. Table 2 provides suggestions for addressing many
stressors associated with educational environments.

Melanie is a cognitive-behavioral therapist in private practice who works with adults
struggling with depressive and anxiety disorders. Her co-therapist is a Yorkie called Rufus.
Rufus comes to work daily with Melanie and is extremely popular with the staff. Melanie
and Rufus were working with a client, Angie, whose recovery from major depressive
disorder was progressing steadily. One morning, Melanie receives an anguished message
from Angie letting her know that her daughter was killed in a car accident the previous day.
Upon returning her call, Melanie encourages Angie to attend her therapy appointment as
usual so that she can talk things through and develop a crisis plan. Melanie is primarily
concerned about Angie’s history of considering suicide when she experiences distress
and wishes to assess her safety. During the appointment, Angie cries uncontrollably and
scoops Rufus onto her lap for comfort. Angie folds over Rufus, holding him gently, yet not
allowing him freedom to move away. Melanie notices that Rufus displays a sideways look,
also known as a whale eye, several times while yawning frequently. Although Angie’s
hold on Rufus is gentle, he is not free to move away from her. Melanie considers what
she can do to help Rufus while not appearing to take him away from Angie. After 10 min,
Rufus impulsively jumps down from the therapy couch and scampers to Melanie’s side,
where he lies down and watches Angie intently.

The emotional distress inherent in AAT settings can feel overwhelming and difﬁcult
to metabolize for dogs and humans alike. In this example, Melanie employs the Triangle
model of AAT, in which she is solely responsible for Rufus’ and Angie’s well-being in
the session. Advocating for a therapy animal in the face of intense client distress feels
difﬁcult, in part because it could seem alienating to the patient. Yet, Rufus’ well-being
cannot be subjugated to Angie’s needs. Despite the conﬂicting needs exempliﬁed in this
therapy example, there are several strategies that could be seamlessly employed to beneﬁt
Rufus and Angie. Planning ahead is a critical element of all effective therapy sessions.
Melanie could incorporate hypothetical scenarios into her session planning, especially
anticipating patient distress. She could consider how she will deftly protect Rufus while
simultaneously addressing the patient’s needs. One way she could have responded is
to acknowledge Angie’s distress and calmly encourage her to change her body posture–
for example, she could lean back against the backrest of the couch with open hands,
palms facing upwards. This is a soothing posture for patients and would release Rufus

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

13 of 16

from her “hug”. Alternatively, Melanie could sit next to Angie with Rufus on her lap;
the comfort that comes from a supportive person sitting quietly beside a client cannot be
underestimated. Given that Melanie received advanced warning that Angie would be
distressed during the session, she also could have asked staff members to keep Rufus with
them for the appointment. Table 3 offers ideas for mitigating stressors often encountered
during animal-assisted therapy sessions.

11. Discussion
11.1. One Health

The One Health philosophy emerged 200 years ago with the recognition that humans
and animals are similarly susceptible to certain diseases [49]. Informed by advancements
in understanding about the interrelationships between human, pet, livestock, wild animal,
and environmental well-being, the One Health model evolved to reﬂect that challenges
to one sector reverberate throughout this interconnected system. Public health efforts
led to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of animal health conditions [50].
Attention has more recently turned to prioritizing the well-being of animals involved
in human–animal interactions [51]. Broadly deﬁned, the primary domains of therapy
animal well-being were conceptualized as physical (freedom from hunger, thirst, pain,
and discomfort), natural (expressing normal behavior and freedom of choice) and affective
(adequate sleep and freedom from cognitive overstimulation and stress) [40]. Explorations
of animal affective states suggest similar biological, neuroendocrine, and communicative
underpinnings as humans [52], making it paramount to ensure that animals experience
positive affective states when participating in human–animal interactions.

11.2. Mutual Beneﬁt and Canine Agency

In keeping with the One Health model and current behavioral and neurobiological
understanding of canine cognition and emotions, fulﬁlling our responsibility to our canine
co-workers requires a stance that their welfare stands on equal footing with that of our
clients. Generally, recipients of AAAs and AAIs choose to participate; our dogs do not.
Winkle, Johnson, and Mills [53] extend the One Health model to promote animal agency
in human–animal interactions; this includes tailoring animals’ work to include activities
for which they are best suited in terms of capability, enjoyment, and agency and allowing
them autonomy and choice regarding human-animal interactions. Viewing one’s dog as a
therapy partner rather than a therapeutic tool builds the human-dog relationship and may

Vet. Sci. 2021, 8, 254

14 of 16

promote safety and enjoyment for all participants in the interaction. [54]. This philosophy
stands to mitigate one of the most signiﬁcant pressures handlers face during AAA—that of
disappointing clients. Winkle, Johnson, and Mills [53] argue that contrary to disappointing
clients, privileging animal agency and autonomy models a foundation of compassion and
caring that can only strengthen the handler/client relationship.

12. Conclusions

Human–animal interactions became more and more important in our lives and are
increasingly recognized as having positive impacts on our health and well-being. Ad-
vancements in science gave us greater understanding of the ways in which dogs interpret
their environment and the broad range of emotions they experience in response to their
surroundings and interactions with humans. With greater understanding comes height-
ened responsibility to our canine companions and colleagues. Dogs are not “tools” to be
used solely for the beneﬁt of people; they are colleagues and collaborators who respond
to stressors in many of the same ways that we do. They simply don’t communicate their
feelings using the same language. It is incumbent upon those of us who work alongside
dogs to understand the signals they send and represent their interests as they collaborate
with us in improving human lives. This paper highlights some of the ways that dogs
may become distressed in animal-assisted interventions and offers practical suggestions to
prevent and mitigate canine stress. Key elements of canine stress mitigation are planning
ahead for circumstances you may encounter with your canine collaborator and maintaining
awareness of their responses during animal-assisted interactions. Advocating for our dogs
is not only the best way to take care of our canine colleagues; it communicates empathy
and kindness to our human clients as well.
