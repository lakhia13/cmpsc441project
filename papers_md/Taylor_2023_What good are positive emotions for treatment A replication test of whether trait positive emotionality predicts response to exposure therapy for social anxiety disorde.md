Abstract

Background:  Positive valence emotions serve functions that may facilitate response to exposure 
therapy – they encourage approach behavior, diminish perceived threat reactivity, and enhance 
assimilation of new information in memory. Few studies have examined whether positive emotions 
predict exposure therapy success and extant findings are mixed.

Methods:  We conducted a secondary analysis of an exposure therapy trial for social anxiety 
disorder to test the hypothesis that patients endorsing higher trait positive emotions at baseline 
would display the greatest treatment response. N = 152 participants enrolled in a randomized 
controlled trial of D-cycloserine augmentation completed five sessions of group exposure therapy. 
Pre-treatment positive emotionality was assessed using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Social 
anxiety symptoms were assessed throughout treatment by blinded evaluators using the Liebowitz 
Social Anxiety Scale.

Results:  Accounting for baseline symptom severity, multilevel growth curve models revealed 
that patients with higher pre-treatment positive emotionality displayed faster social anxiety 
symptom reductions and lower scores at 3-month follow-up. This predictive effect remained 
significant after controlling for baseline depression and extraversion (without the positive 
emotionality facet).

Conclusions:  These findings add to emerging evidence suggesting that explicitly targeting and 
enhancing positive emotions during exposure to perceived threat may improve treatment outcomes 
for anxiety and fear-based disorders.

Prediction

Exposure therapy is the core component of first-line cognitive and behavioral treatments for 
anxiety and fear-based disorders. It is based on the premise that recovery from anxiety 
occurs when a person repeatedly confronts threat-relevant cues or contexts and learns 
that feared stimuli are not as dangerous as previously thought (McNally, 2007; Smits, 
Powers, & Otto, 2019). Such learning requires one to approach and engage with avoided 
feared situations, tolerate unpleasant experiences (e.g., distress), and assimilate new, threat-
inconsistent information into memory (Craske et al., 2008). Because exposure therapy 
response rates approximate 50% (Loerinc et al., 2015), there is a need to identify theory-
driven and modifiable predictors of treatment success that could be leveraged to improve 
treatment outcomes. Here, we conducted a secondary analysis of an exposure therapy trial 
for social anxiety disorder (SAD) to examine whether individual differences in the trait-like 
tendency to experience positive valence emotions predicts treatment success.

Affective science findings suggest positive valence emotions (e.g., joy, interest, contentment) 
and their associated response tendencies (e. g., behavioral approach) serve functions that 
support adaptive responses to perceived threat and promote new, non-threat learning. 
Individual differences in positive affect (i.e., the frequency and intensity with which a 
person experiences positive valence emotions) as well as experimentally inducing positive 
emotions relative to neutral or negative emotions (e.g., sadness) in non-clinical samples: 
(1) downregulates physiological (Fredrickson, Mancuso, Branigan, & Tugade, 2000) and 
subjective reactivity (e.g., negative affect) (Speer & Delgado, 2017) to perceived threat; 
(2) facilitates tolerance of aversive experiences (de Wied & Verbaten, 2001); (3) activates 
approach motivation and behavior, including engagement with threat-relevant exposures 
(Berman, Summers, Weingarden, & Wilhelm, 2019); (4) promotes adaptive coping (e.g., 
positive reappraisal) in stressful situations (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004); and (5) increases 
awareness and assimilation of new information, including promoting openness to new 
information and patterns of information processing (see review by (Fredrickson, 2013)). 
Positive affect has also been shown to facilitate mechanisms supporting learning and 
memory, including enhancing encoding, rehearsal, and retrieval (see review by (Zbozinek & 
Craske, 2017b)) – processes that underpin extinction learning (Craske et al., 2008; Kredlow, 
Eichenbaum, & Otto, 2018).

Data from fear conditioning and extinction paradigms in healthy samples – an experimental 
analogue of exposure therapy – suggests positive affect may inhibit the return of fear 
following extinction training (Zbozinek & Craske, 2017a; Zbozinek, Holmes, & Craske, 
2015). In a cross-sectional study, higher positive affect (but not negative affect) before and 
after extinction was associated with less return of fear during reacquisition [i.e., re-pairing 
of the CS+ and US following extinction] as measured by skin conductance arousal and 
fear expectancy (Zbozinek & Craske, 2017a). Experimentally inducing positive affect prior 
to extinction training decreased subsequent negative valence appraisals of the conditioned 
aversive stimuli and led to less return of fear during reinstatement [i.e., exposure to the US 
in the absence of the CS+] one week later (Zbozinek et al., 2015). Conversely, anhedonia (a 
clinical phenotype characterized by low positive affect), but not general distress or fears, was 
associated with increased activity in threat-related neural circuity (e.g., amygdala, anterior 
insula) in response to an extinguished threat stimulus in a cross-section of young adults 
(Young et al., 2021). Those findings point to a persistence of inflated threat reactivity when 
danger is no longer present in people with low positive affect – complementing extinction 
training studies linking positive affect and extinction learning in healthy samples. Research 
in patient samples further supports the positive emotionality-threat reactivity link: adults 
with SAD characterized by higher positive affect experienced lower anticipatory anxiety 
and displayed less anxiety-related behavior in response to a standardized public speaking 
exposure, beyond level of negative affect (Taylor, Tsai, & Smith, 2020).

Findings from laboratory-based studies suggest individual differences in positive emotions 
may predict response to exposure-based therapies for anxiety. Initial support for that 
hypothesis came from a secondary analysis of an exposure-based CBT trial for patients 
diagnosed with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017). 
Higher pre-treatment levels of trait positive emotionality (measured using the positive 
emotion facet of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory) predicted greater reduction in

anxiety symptoms and fewer symptoms following treatment, even when accounting for 
baseline levels of depression and disorder-specific symptom severity. Responder status 
was greater in participants who scored above the normative sample mean on positive 
emotionality vs. those who scored below (71% vs. 40%). However, a subsequent study 
in patients diagnosed with SAD did not find that baseline levels of positive affect predicted 
response to CBT or acceptance and commitment therapy (Sewart et al., 2019). In this 
study, positive affect was measured in reference to the past week using a composite of 
the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire 
positive affect items (cf. using a personality assessment inventory; (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 
2017)), and hence was more of a “state” measure of positive affect, not a “trait” measure. 
Similarly, state positive emotional reactivity in response to viewing positive valence images 
did not predict response to CBT or ACT for SAD (Niles, Mesri, Burklund, Lieberman, & 
Craske, 2013). Thus, despite laboratory evidence suggesting positive emotions may support 
processes believed to underpin exposure therapy success, prediction of clinical response 
from pre-treatment measures of positive emotions is mixed.

To further investigate the possibility that positive emotions are relevant for exposure therapy 
success, we sought to replicate and extend to a sample of patients with SAD prior findings 
(Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017) demonstrating that higher pre-treatment positive emotionality 
predicted superior clinical response. The replication sample comprised patients enrolled 
in a D-cycloserine (DCS) exposure augmentation trial for SAD in which all patients were 
instructed to repeatedly confront feared social situations (e.g., public speaking exposures; 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02066792) (Hofmann et al., 2015; Smits et al., 2020). 
Similar to (Taylor et al., 2017a), participants completed a pre-treatment measure of positivity 
emotionality derived from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory of personality. Clinician-rated 
social anxiety symptoms were assessed before, during (weekly), and after treatment. Linear 
mixed effect models tested the hypothesis that higher pre-treatment positive emotionality 
would be associated with a larger reduction in symptoms (H1) and lower symptom severity 
at the final follow-up (H2). Because depression frequently co-occurs with social anxiety 
(Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005) and is also characterized by low 
positive affect (Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow, 1998), secondary models also controlled for 
baseline depression scores. Finally, to account for the possibility that the higher order 
extraversion domain, rather than positive emotionality per se, would predict treatment 
response (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017), we examined a model also controlling for baseline 
extraversion scores that did not include the positive emotion facet.

dysfunction; significant suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviors in the past 6 months; serious 
medical illness; history of seizures; pregnancy, lactation, or of child-bearing potential 
and not using contraception; or concurrent psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or prior 
nonresponse to exposure therapy. The analysis sample included participants who were 
randomized to one of four treatment arms (N = 152). Sample demographics were: age 
(M = 29.24, SD = 10.16), sex (84 women [55.26%], 67 men [44.08%] women, 1 neither 
[0.66%]), race (90 [59.21%] White, 34 [22.37%] Asian, 20 [13.16%] Black, 5 [3.29%] other, 
and 6 [3.95%] not reported), ethnicity (30 [19.74%] Hispanic or Latino, 116 [76.32%] not 
Hispanic or Latino, 6 [3.95%] not reported).

1.2.  Measures

1.2.1.  Positive emotions—Trait positive emotions were assessed using the NEO 
Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI; (Costa & McCrae, 1992)). The NEO FFI is a 60-item 
self-rated measure designed to assess five personality domains: neuroticism, extraversion, 
agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Facets within each domain 
describe lower-level groups of personality characteristics. Research supports a 4-item 
positive emotions scale within the domain of extraversion (items: laughs easily; not cheerful 
or light-hearted [R]; cheerful, vivacious; not a cheerful optimist [R]) (Chapman, 2007; 
Saucier, 1998). The NEO FFI positive emotion scale is reliable and valid, and correlates 
highly (r = 0.86) with the positive emotion facet score of the 240-item NEO-PI-R (used 
to predict treatment response in (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017)). Current sample Cronbach’s 
alpha = 0.76. The remaining NEO FFI extraversion items (reflecting sociability and activity) 
were summed (without the positive emotion items; Cronbach’s alpha = .70 and entered into 
secondary analysis models (described below).

1.2.2.  Depression—The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; 
(Montgomery & Asberg, 1979)) was used to assess depression severity at baseline. It 
comprises 10 items rated by clinicians on a seven-point Likert scale. Items are summed 
to produce a total scale score ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting greater 
depression severity.

1.2.3.  Social anxiety symptom severity—Trained evaluators blind to participant’s 
treatment condition administered the LSAS (Liebowitz, 1987) each week to measure 
severity of social anxiety symptoms. Participants rated their level of fear and avoidance 
within the past week for 24 social or performance situations on a 4-point scale ranging from 
0 (no fear/never avoids) to 3 (severe fear/usually avoids). LSAS was assessed weekly during 
treatment and at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.

1.3.  Procedure

Potential participants were invited for a full in-person eligibility assessment after providing 
informed written consent. Eligible participants met with an independent evaluator who 
administered the baseline outcome measures. The following week, 160 of 169 participants 
attended the first session (60 min) of a 5-session group exposure therapy program (Hofmann 
et al., 2015), which provided education on SAD and a rationale for exposure therapy. The 
remaining sessions (2–5; 90 min) focused on public speaking practice designed to evoke

adequate fear activation and provide opportunities for violating threat expectancies. Between 
session exposure practice was encouraged.

Randomization occurred at the beginning of session 2 (N = 152) in a double-blind fashion 
to one of four DCS/placebo augmentation regimens based on the timing (before or after) 
and success of the exposure session (success was defined as achieving an end of exposure 
fear score of 40 or less on a scale of 0–100). Treatment conditions were: (1) placebo before 
the session and either DCS after a successful session or placebo after an unsuccessful 
session (tailored); (2) DCS before the session and placebo after the session (pre-session); (3) 
placebo before the session and DCS after the session (post-session); (4) placebo before and 
after the session (placebo). Study medication was administered and monitored by research 
staff blind to treatment condition.

1.4.  Statistical analyses

The growth curve model of LSAS over the course of the study was analyzed using mixed 
effects models (MEMs). MEMs include all participants who have at least one assessment, 
and can model the complex covariance of the repeated measures over time. We first 
determined the best fitting growth curve model, comparing linear, quadratic, and log growth 
models and choosing the model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC]. Then 
we determined the best fitting covariance structure of the error covariance matrix, comparing 
diagonal, AR (1), compound symmetry, Toeplitz, and unstructured covariance structures, 
and random effects models, again choosing the model with the lowest BIC (please see the 
Supplement for the definition of each of these covariance structures).

As noted above, the parent study was comprised of 4 different DCS treatment groups. 
Although all 4 DCS treatment groups received the same exposure treatment (just different 
DCS protocols), participants responded better in some treatment groups than in others. To 
ensure that the obtained effects of Positive Emotionality were not due to DCS treatment 
group difference (even though there were no treatment group differences in Positive 
Emotionality, p = .657), all analyses controlled for DCS Treatment Group and the DCS 
Treatment Group × Time interaction.

Because Positive Emotionality was related to baseline LSAS severity (higher Positive 
Emotionality was related to lower baseline LSAS, r (150) = −0.28, p < .001), all models 
also controlled for baseline LSAS and baseline LSAS × Time. Otherwise, the beneficial 
effect of Positive Emotionality might be due to lower baseline LSAS severity. Thus, all 
models included Positive Emotionality, Time, Positive Emotionality × Time, baseline LSAS, 
baseline LSAS × Time, DCS Treatment Group (dummy coded), and DCS Treatment Group 
× Time. The growth curve model tracked LSAS from the beginning of the first session 
of exposure treatment through the final assessment (3-month follow-up). In sensitivity 
analyses, we reran all analyses without controlling for baseline LSAS and DCS treatment 
groups to determine if the results for Positive Emotionality were due to inclusion of these 
control variables.

We also examined whether treatment responders (defined as LSAS < 50 at follow-up, as per 
Pollack et al., 2014) had higher baseline Positive Emotionality scores than non-responders.

Following the approach used in our previous paper on this topic (Taylor, Lyubomirsky, 
& Stein, 2017), we included all participants in this analysis by employing our intent-to-
treat MLM models to estimate the follow-up scores of participants who did not complete 
the follow-up assessment. We then performed a oneway ANOVA, with the independent 
variable being responder status (yes/no), and the dependent variable being baseline Positive 
Emotionality score.

Sensitivity analyses examined whether the effects of Positive Emotionality varied between 
DCS treatment groups by including the interactions between the dummy variables coding 
the 4 DCS treatment groups and the Positive Emotionality × Time interaction. Exploratory 
analyses investigated whether the effect of Positive Emotionality on the effectiveness of the 
exposure treatment remained after controlling for baseline depression by adding baseline 
MADRS scores, and the baseline MADRS × Time interaction, to the primary model above. 
In a second exploratory analysis, we controlled for baseline extraversion by adding baseline 
extraversion (minus the Positive Emotionality items) and the baseline extraversion × Time 
interaction to our primary model. Finally, in a third exploratory analysis, we controlled 
for both baseline MADRS and extraversion by adding baseline MADRS and extraversion 
(minus the Positive Emotionality items), and their interactions with Time, to our primary 
model.

Effects were considered significant if p < .05. Approximate effect sizes for all significant 
effects were calculated using the t-to-d (Cohen’s d) conversion. The BIC for each model is 
reported below. Although one cannot statistically compare models based on the BIC, Singer 
and Willett (2003) suggest that differences between models of 0–2 points is “weak”, 2–6 is 
“positive”, 6–10 is “strong”, and over 10 is “very strong.”

2.  Results

2.1. 

Initial analyses

The CONSORT diagram for the parent trial (Smits et al., 2020) is included in the 
supplement (Supplemental eFig. 1). Box plots and strip plots for the variables of interest 
in the present study are shown in the Supplement in eFig. 2. Scatterplots between these 
variables are shown in the Supplement eFig. 3. As reported in the parent trial, the study 
included 152 adults with SAD (mean[SD] age, 29.24[10.16] years, 84 [55.26%] of which 
were male). There were no differences between DCS Treatment Groups on demographic 
variables or outcome measures at baseline (supplement eTable 1). Session attendance was 
high (N = 139 (91.4%) attended through the last exposure session). Attrition at the 3-month 
follow-up was N = 29 of 152 [19.1%]. Attrition did not differ between groups. Participants’ 
demographic and baseline measures were not different between those with missing data vs. 
those with complete data. The primary trial reported the differences between the 4 DCS 
groups so those differences will not be reported here unless there is an interaction between 
the effects of Positive Emotionality and the DCS treatment groups.

2.2.  Positive emotions as a predictor of treatment outcome

The best fitting growth curve model for the change in LSAS over time (lowest BIC) was a 
linear model coding assessment number, from assessment 1 (beginning of the first exposure 
session) to assessment 8 (the 3-month follow-up). Time was then centered at assessment 
8 so that the main effect of Positive Emotionality would reflect the effect of Positive 
Emotionality on LSAS at assessment 8 (the 3-month follow-up). The best fitting covariance 
structure (lowest BIC) for the errors of the repeated measures was AR(1). All the findings 
reported herein were robust (i.e., did not change in significance) to changes in the growth 
curve model (e.g., using LN of weeks as the Time variable instead of linear assessments) and 
to changes in the covariance structure (e.g., using a Toeplitz matrix instead of AR(1) for the 
error covariance).

Average Positive Emotionality scores across the 4 Positive Emotionality items ranged from 
1.25 to 5.0, with a mean (and median) of 3.0 (SD = 0.82). Consistent with hypothesis 
1, our MEM analysis showed that the slope of decrease (improvement) in LSAS from 
the beginning of exposure sessions to the 3-month follow-up was steeper for participants 
with higher baseline Positive Emotionality, b = −1.11, 95% CI [−1.70, −0.52], t(1102) = − 
3.67, p < .001, d = 0.22 (see Fig. 1; BIC for this model was 8463.97). For example, for 
participants who averaged a score of 4.0 on the 4 Positive Emotionality items, their slope 
of improvement was b = −5.10, 95% CI [−5.85, −4.35], t(1102) = −13.32, p < .001, d 
= 0.80 (i.e., their LSAS scores decreased about 5.1 points per assessment). The decrease 
for participants who averaged a score of 2.0 on the 4 Positive Emotionality items, though 
still significant, was 44% lower, b = −2.88, 95% CI [−3.63, −2.13], t(1102) = −7.51, p 
< .001, d = 0.45. As a result of this difference in slopes of improvement, we found that 
higher pre-treatment positive emotionality was associated with lower symptom severity at 
the 3-month follow up (hypothesis 2), b = −8.19, 95% CI [−11.33, −5.05], t(1102) = −5.12, 
p < .001, d = 0.31. Participants with an average score of 2 on Positive Emotionality items 
were estimated to have a mean LSAS of 62.5 at 3-month follow-up, while those with an 
average score of 4 on the Positive Emotionality items were estimated to have a score of 46.1. 
Spaghetti plots for a subset of the total sample are provided in Supplement eFig. 4. eFig. 4a 
shows the spaghetti plots for the first 15 participants who were classified as “low Positive 
Emotionality” (in the bottom 25th percentile) and eFig. 4b shows the spaghetti plots for the 
first 15 participants classified as “high Positive Emotionality” (in the top 25th percentile).

Sensitivity analyses, dropping the terms involving the control variables (baseline LSAS and 
DCS treatment condition), revealed identical results in terms of significance. For example, 
in this sensitivity analysis we found that higher pre-treatment positive emotionality was 
associated with lower symptom severity at the 3-month follow up, b = −11.82, 95% CI 
[−15.93, −7.71], t(1110) = −5.64, p < .001, d = 0.34. The BIC for this model was 8570.81, 
substantially worse than the BIC for the full model above (8463.97).

Another sensitivity analysis provided further support to the effect of Positive Emotionality 
on exposure treatment success from another perspective. For this sensitivity analysis, we 
examined whether treatment responders (defined as LSAS< 50 at follow-up, as per Pollack 
et al., 2014) had higher baseline Positive Emotionality scores than non-responders. Overall, 
47.7% of participants met criterion for responders. We then performed a oneway ANOVA,

with the independent variable being responder status (yes/no), and the dependent variable 
being baseline Positive Emotionality score. The analysis indicated that responders had 
higher average baseline Positive Emotionality scores (M = 3.24, SD = 0.76) than non-
responders (M = 2.84, SD = 0.86), F(1, 149) = 9.36, p = .003.

Further sensitivity analyses, adding the interactions between the DCS Treatment Group 
dummy variables and the Positive Emotionality × Time interaction (and all subcomponents) 
to the primary MLM model, showed no indication that the Positive Emotionality × Time 
interaction (or the Positive Emotionality differences at 3-month follow-up) differed between 
DCS Treatment groups (ps ranged from p = .559 to p = .926). The BIC for this model was 
8505.37, substantially worse than for our primary model above (8463.97).

2.3.  Exploratory analyses

2.3.1.  Baseline depression severity—Baseline depression scores on the MADRS, 
and their interaction with Time, were added to our primary model above to determine 
if the effects of baseline Positive Emotionality remained significant after controlling for 
baseline depression. Analyses (which controlled for baseline LSAS and baseline Positive 
Emotionality, as well as DCS treatment condition) showed that baseline depression 
significantly moderated the change in LSAS over time, with participants who were higher 
on baseline depression improving less than those who were lower, b = 0.09, 95% CI [0.05, 
0.14], t(1089) = 4.00, p < .001, d = 0.24. The BIC for this model was 8362.21, substantially 
better than the BIC for the primary model without MADRS (8463.97), indicating that 
adding baseline MADRS to the primary model substantially improved model fit. This is 
consistent with the significant effects of both MADRS and Positive Emotionality. Similarly, 
participants with higher baseline depression had higher LSAS scores at the 3-month follow-
up, b = .60, 95% CI [0.39, 0.81], t(1089) = 5.63, p < .001, d = 0.34. See Supplement eFig. 5. 
Despite this relation, the effects of baseline Positive Emotionality remained significant, and 
decreased only about 10%, b = −1.01, 95% CI [−1.60, −0.43], t(1089) = −3.42, p < .001, 
d = 0.21, for the baseline Positive Emotionality × Time interaction, and b = −7.54, 95% CI 
[−10.58, −4.49], t(1089) = −4.85, p < .001, d = 0.29, for the main effect of baseline Positive 
Emotionality on LSAS symptoms at the 3-month follow-up.

2.3.2.  Extraversion (without positive emotionality items)

Next, baseline extraversion scores (excluding the 4 Positive Emotionality items), and 
their interaction with Time, were added to our primary model (without MADRS) to 
determine if the effects of baseline Positive Emotionality remained after controlling for 
baseline extraversion. Analyses (which controlled for baseline LSAS and baseline Positive 
Emotionality, as well as DCS treatment condition) showed that baseline extraversion did not 
moderate the change in LSAS over time (p = .971), nor was it significantly related to LSAS 
scores at the 3-month follow-up (p = .612). BIC for this model was 8477.46, substantially 
higher than the BIC for the primary model (8463.97). The effects of baseline Positive 
Emotionality on LSAS remained significant, and decreased only slightly, b = −1.11, 95% CI 
[−1.83, −0.41], t(1100) = −3.09, p = .002, d = 0.19, for the baseline Positive Emotionality 
× Time interaction, and b = −7.66, 95% CI [−11.40, −3.92], t(1100) = −4.02, p < .001,

d = 0.24, for the main effect of baseline Positive Emotionality on LSAS symptoms at the 
3-month follow up.

2.3.3.  Controlling for both depression and extraversion

Our final exploratory analysis added both baseline depression and baseline extraversion 
(excluding the 4 Positive Emotionality items), and their interactions with Time, to the 
primary model. In this analysis, baseline depression significantly moderated the change in 
LSAS over time, with participants who were higher on baseline depression improving less 
than those who were lower, b = 0.09, 95% CI [0.05, 0.14], t(1087) = 4.07, p < .001, d = 0.25, 
and participants with higher baseline depression having higher LSAS scores at the 3-month 
follow-up, b = .61, 95% CI [0.40, 0.82], t(1087) = 5.70, p < .001, d = 0.35. Extraversion, 
however, was not related to LSAS (ps > .163). Despite controlling for both of these potential 
confounders, the effects of baseline Positive Emotionality remained significant, b = −0.87, 
95% CI [−1.57, −0.16], t(1087) = −2.41, p = .016, d = 0.15, for the baseline Positive 
Emotionality × Time interaction, and b = −0.6.05, 95% CI [−9.74, −2.37], t(1087) = −3.23, 
p = .001, d = 0.20, for the main effect of baseline Positive Emotionality on LSAS symptoms 
at the 3-month follow up. The BIC for this model was 8368.37, better than the BIC for the 
primary model (8463.97), but somewhat worse than the previous model which only added 
MADRS as an additional control variable.

In a further post-hoc analysis we found no evidence for an interaction between baseline 
depression and baseline Positive Emotionality affecting either change in LSAS over time 
(p = .125) or affecting LSAS scores at the 3-month follow-up (p = .332). The BIC for this 
model was 8505.37, substantially worse than the BIC for the primary model (8463.97).

Final post-hoc analyses were run because baseline MADRS scores were skewed, skewness 
= 1.14, with one outlier score of 43 (see eFig. 2c). This is not surprising given that most 
MARS scores were low because our inclusion criteria did not require participants to have 
elevated MADRS scores. Thus, the MLM analyses were rerun using MADRS scores that 
were square root transformed (skewness = 0.36, no outliers after transformation). Results 
for all analyses were identical (in terms of significance) using the square root transformed 
MADRS scores as with the raw MADRS scores. For example, in the exploratory analysis 
in which we controlled for MADRS scores (our first exploratory analysis reported above), 
higher transformed MADRS scores were still related to slower improvement in LSAS scores 
over time (p < .001 for the transformed MADRS × Time interaction), and higher Positive 
Emotionality scores were related to greater improvement over time (p < .001 for the Positive 
Emotionality × Time interaction). BIC for this model using the square root of MADRS 
(8360.78) was very similar to the BIC for the same model above using raw MADRS 
(8362.21).

3.  Discussion

We investigated the relationship between baseline positive emotionality and treatment 
outcomes in adults with social anxiety disorder (SAD) who received exposure therapy 
as part of a D-cycloserine (DCS) augmentation trial (Smits et al., 2020). Higher positive 
emotionality was associated with superior treatment response – reflected in a steeper rate of

decline in LSAS scores from before treatment to the 3-month follow-up, as well as lower 
symptom severity at 3-month follow-up. Results were robust when accounting for baseline 
depression severity and when accounting for extraversion (without the positive emotionality 
facet). These findings add to a growing literature supporting the potential value of positive 
emotions for improving treatment response for anxiety disorders.

Multiple lines of observational and experimental evidence support the premise that positive 
emotions may facilitate response to exposure-based therapies for anxiety (for a review, 
see (Taylor, Hoffman, & Khan, 2022)). Although the current study cannot answer how 
positive emotionality facilitated treatment success in patients receiving exposure therapy 
for SAD, extant studies point to several candidate mechanisms, including diminished 
threat reactivity, increased approach behaviors, distress tolerance, cognitive reappraisal, and 
inhibitory learning. That is, positive emotions may have increased behavioral engagement 
(Berman et al., 2019) and/or reduced subjective distress during exposure to perceived threat 
(i.e., public speaking exposures; (Taylor et al., 2020)), and may have promoted learning that 
the situation was less dangerous than initially expected (Zbozinek et al., 2015). Research 
is needed in which these and other putative mechanisms underpinning the positive emotion-
exposure response link are assessed.

The current results are consistent with a prior study in which positive emotionality (similarly 
assessed using a personality inventory) predicted superior response in patients with GAD 
or panic disorder completing 10-sessions of CBT (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017); however, 
they differ from a 12-session CBT trial in SAD in which positive emotions were assessed 
in reference to participants’ experiences during the past week (Sewart et al., 2019). This 
divergence may be explained in part by the relative trait vs. state nature of the positive 
emotion assessments. To the extent that positive emotions experienced shortly before and 
throughout exposure exercises facilitated treatment response, the greater temporal stability 
of the personality-based positive emotion assessments at baseline may have better captured 
how participants were likely feeling at any given moment during treatment, including 
when completing exposure exercises. Future research could resolve this issue by examining 
state affect immediately before, during and after exposure exercises, alongside trait-based 
measures at baseline. Such data could also inform the optimal timing of positive emotion 
targeted augmentation strategies intended to boost exposure therapy efficacy. It should also 
be noted that the scope of the 4-item NEO-FFI positive emotionality assessment was limited 
compared to prior work (Sewart et al.). Research is needed to determine whether a broader 
measure of trait positive emotionality would yield similar findings or whether certain facets 
of positive emotionality (e.g., cheerfulness as assessed by the NEO-FFI) more strongly 
predict exposure therapy response relative to other facets.

Two exploratory outcomes are worth noting. First, non-positive emotionality facets of 
extraversion (sociability and activity) did not predict treatment response. This finding is 
consistent with prior work (Taylor, Knapp, et al., 2017) and suggests positive emotionality 
may serve unique functions in facilitating exposure response beyond general extraversion 
and its associated outcomes (e.g., positive social interactions). Second, baseline depression 
severity significantly moderated the change in LSAS over time, such that participants with 
higher depression scores improved less. This outcome suggests that features of depression

beyond (low) positive emotionality interfered with treatment response. For example, sleep 
disturbance is common in those experiencing depression and was found to predict worse 
response to CBT for SAD (Zalta et al., 2013). Other candidate symptoms include diminished 
energy (which may limit treatment engagement) and concentration difficulties (which may 
impair memory for treatment content and/or directly interfere with extinction learning). 
Regardless, the current findings support positive emotionality as a strong predictor of 
response to exposure therapy for SAD, independent of variance shared with depression.

Clinical significance of the observed outcomes is reflected in the 44% larger reduction 
in symptoms experienced by participants scoring approximately one standard deviation 
above the sample mean on positive emotionality (score = 4) compared to those scoring one 
standard deviation below the mean (score = 2). The end state social anxiety scores of the 
low positive emotionality group remained above the LSAS cutoff of 60 typically used for 
identifying people who are eligible for entry into clinical trials and who are characterized 
by fear and avoidance of most social situations (reflecting the former DSM generalized 
subtype of social anxiety disorder; (Mennin et al., 2002)). The significance of these findings 
is further underscored by the prevalence of low positive emotionality in SAD samples. For 
example, nearly half (43%) of a sample of over 700 patients with SAD were characterized 
by low positive temperament (Tung & Brown, 2020), pointing to a sizable portion of the 
SAD population who may not respond sufficiently to first-line exposure-based therapies. 
The present findings suggest that directly targeting positive emotions before and/or while 
patients engage in exposure therapy may be a fruitful approach to improving treatment 
response – especially for people characterized by low positive emotionality. Accumulating 
evidence supports the initial efficacy of several cognitive and behavioral strategies focused 
on upregulating positive emotions in anxious populations, including acts of kindness (Alden 
& Trew, 2013), savoring (LaFreniere & Newman, 2023), and multicomponent protocols 
comprised of those and other (e.g., gratitude) activities (Craske et al., 2019; Taylor, 
Lyubomirsky, & Stein, 2017); however, to our knowledge, such approaches have not been 
directly tested in conjunction with exposure therapy. Although it remains to be established 
whether certain positive emotions facilitate exposure response more so than others, prior 
work suggests it is possible to increase a range of discrete positive emotions in anxious 
samples (Taylor, Lyubomirsky, & Stein, 2017), including those primarily measured by the 
NEO-FFI.

The following caveats should be considered when interpreting the study outcomes. Positive 
emotionality was measured before treatment using a self-report personality scale. It is not 
possible to determine whether positive emotions experienced throughout treatment or prior 
to exposure exercises accounted for the observed pattern of treatment response. Different 
positive emotions serve different functions (Shiota et al., 2017), suggesting it may be 
valuable to determine whether certain discrete positive emotions facilitate response better 
than others. Positive emotions were not manipulated in this study and therefore causality 
cannot be inferred. Finally, patients received five sessions of exposure therapy and it remains 
to be established whether positive emotionality predicts response to treatments of different 
durations and over the longer term (i.e., beyond three months following treatment cessation). 
Limitations notwithstanding, the current findings add to a growing literature supporting 
the value of assessing and possibly targeting positive emotions in treatment. Research is

Fig. 1. 
Estimated LSAS scores from baseline through 3-month follow-up at different levels of 
baseline Positive Emotionality. Note: 1MFU = 1-month follow-up; 3MFU = 3-month follow-
up. Blue squares indicate the raw means for those with low Positive Emotionality (mean = 
2.01/item). Red Circles indicate the raw means for those with high Positive Emotionality 
(mean = 4.14/item). These estimated means come from analyses in which baseline LSAS 
and its interaction with Time are controlled. (For interpretation of the references to colour in 
this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
