Psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar 
and bipolar depression
Oliver G. Bosch*, Simon Halm and Erich Seifritz 

Abstract 
This is a narrative review about the role of classic and two atypical psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar and 
bipolar depression. Since the 1990s, psychedelics experience a renaissance in biomedical research. The so-called clas-
sic psychedelics include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline and ayahuasca. Characteristic effects 
like alterations in sensory perception, as well as emotion- and self-processing are induced by stimulation of seroto-
nin 2A receptors in cortical areas. The new paradigm of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy suggests a therapeutic 
framework in which a safely conducted psychedelic experience is integrated into a continuous psychotherapeutic 
process. First randomized, controlled trials with psilocybin show promising efficacy, tolerability, and adherence in the 
treatment of unipolar depression. On the other hand, classic psychedelics seem to be associated with the induction 
of mania, which is an important issue to consider for the design of research and clinical protocols. So called atypical 
psychedelics are a heterogeneous group with overlapping subjective effects but different neurobiological mecha-
nisms. Two examples of therapeutic value in psychiatry are 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine  (MDMA) and 
ketamine. Since 2020 the ketamine enantiomer esketamine has been granted international approval for treatment-
resistant unipolar depression, and also first evidence exists for the therapeutic efficacy of ketamine in bipolar depres-
sion. Whether psychedelics will fulfil current expectations and find their way into broader clinical use will depend 
on future rigorous clinical trials with larger sample sizes. A well-considered therapeutic and legal framework will be 
crucial for these substances to create new treatment settings and a potential paradigm shift.

Introduction
The  discovery  of  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD)  by 
the  Swiss  chemist  Albert  Hofmann  in  1943  triggered  a 
worldwide interest into the substance’s unique effects on 
the human psyche and its potential clinical use and value 
for research (Nichols and Walter, 2021). Challenging the 
existing paradigms of psychiatry and psychotherapy, LSD 
promised  to  be  a  tool  to  better  understand  the  human 
mind and mental disorders. It is widely seen as the pro-
totype of a psychedelic drug. The term psychedelic itself 
was  introduced  by  the  British  psychiatrist  Humphry 
Osmond combining the Greek words ψυχη (psychḗ, soul)

and δῆλος (dẽlos, to make visible, to reveal) hence mean-
ing mind revealing or mind manifesting (Osmond, 1957). 
Only some years later the writer and philosopher Aldous 
Huxley popularized the term in his culturally influential 
essay The Doors of Perception, in which he described his 
subjective  experience  with  the  phenylalkylamine  mesca-
line,  another  classic  psychedelic  (Huxley,  1959).  Follow-
ing Hofmann’s discovery of LSD, his employer, the Swiss 
pharmaceutical  company  Sandoz,  enabled  an  extensive 
research  effort  by  distributing  the  substance  under  the 
name  Delysid  to  researchers  around  the  world.  During 
this  first  wave  of  psychedelic  research  over  a  time  of  15 
to  20  years,  psychiatrists  investigated  the  substance’s 
therapeutic potential in the treatment of numerous psy-
chiatric  conditions  including  affective  disorders,  sub-
stance use and chronic pain (Grispoon and Bakalar, 1981; 
Nichols  and  Walter,  2021). These  studies  included  more

than 40′000 subjects, showing often promising improve-
ment rates but also methodological flaws such as lack of 
blinding  and  control  groups.  A  recent  analysis  of  19  of 
these  early  studies  showed  improvement  in  depressive 
symptoms  in  79.2%  of  the  423  Patients  after  adminis-
tration  of  a  psychedelic  (Rucker  et  al.,  2016).  The  1960s 
saw  an  increasing  interest  into  psychedelics  not  only  in 
science but also in the counterculture movement, culmi-
nating  in  an  increasing  idealization  and  controversy  as 
well  as  instrumentalization  from  both  its  advocates  and  
opponents  (Dyck,  2005).  The  result  of  this  dispute  was 
a sudden interruption of research after the international 
prohibition  of  LSD  in  1970  (UN,  1971).  Subsequently, 
the  discoverer  Hofmann  himself  in  hindsight  called  the 
chemical his problem child (Hofmann, 2012).

Nonetheless, this problem child emerged to an initially 
subtle  but  soon  rapidly  accelerating  renaissance  starting 
in the early 1990s, which showed a renewed scientific and 
later  clinical  engagement  with  psychedelic  substances 
(Cameron  and  Olson,  2018).  Simultaneously,  scientists 
started to investigate several other molecules with partly 
overlapping subjective effects, but different neurobiologi-
cal  mechanisms.  This  heterogeneous  group  of  so-called 
atypical  psychedelics  such  as  3,4-methyl enedioxy meth-
amphetamine  (MDMA) and ketamine soon also showed 
potential therapeutic effects in psychiatry (Vollenweider, 
2001). In a parallel development, new advances in neuro-
imaging  techniques  such  as  positron  emission  tomogra-
phy,  single-photon  emission  computed  tomography  and 
functional  magnet  resonance  imaging  facilitated  a  new 
and differentiated understanding of psychedelic-induced 
altered states of consciousness (Vollenweider et al., 1997; 
Hermle  et  al.,  1992).  Finally,  two  further  developments 
set  up  the  stage  for  the  definitive  comeback  of  psyche-
delic substances into laboratories and clinics: on the one 
hand the increasing neuroscientific investigation of psy-
chotherapeutic  processes  and  on  the  other  hand  the  so 
called psychopharmacology in crisis (Nutt and Goodwin, 
2011),  i.e.  the  withdrawal  of  the  pharmaceutical  indus-
try from psychiatric drug development. In the following 
article, we will describe the most important psychedelics, 
their  subjective  effects,  and  mechanisms  of  action.  We 
also will give an overview of current evidence on psych-
edelics  in  the  treatment  of  unipolar  and  bipolar  depres-
sion  and  potential  future  challenges.  This  is  a  narrative 
review,  for  which  we  performed  a  Pubmed  search  using 
the  terms  “psychedelic”,  “LSD”,  “psilocybin”,  “mesca-
line”, “ayahuasca”, “DMT”, “ketamine”, “MDMA”, together 
with  “depression”,  “bipolar  disorder”,  “mania”,  “unipo-
lar  depression”,  “bipolar  depression”,  “pharmacokinetic”, 
“pharmacology”, “subjective effects”, “neurobiology”, “neu-
ropsychopharmacology”,  “mechanisms”,  “psychotherapy”. 

Then,  relevant  information  was  extracted  regarding  our 
section topics and included accordingly.

Psychedelic substances
Psychedelics  can  be  separated  into  classic  and  atypi-
cal  (Calvey  and  Howells,  2018).  Classic  psychedelics 
(sometimes  referred  to  as  hallucinogens)  are  a  group  of 
psychoactive  substances  inducing  a  characteristic  psy-
chedelic  experience  with  distinct  changes  in  conscious-
ness,  visual  perception  as  well  as  emotional,  social-  and 
self-processing. Despite the complexity of their pharma-
cological mechanisms, compelling evidence suggests that 
serotonergic  neurotransmission—especially  the  sero-
tonin  2A  receptor—plays  a  key  role  in  the  mediation  of 
their  effects.  Unsurprisingly,  some  of  these  molecules 
show  structural  similarity  to  serotonin  itself  (Vollen-
weider  and  Kometer,  2010).  Classic  psychedelics  can  be 
further distinguished into three classes: tryptamine deri-
vates  (such  as  psilocybin  and  N,N-dimethyltryptamine 
[DMT]),  phenylalkylamines  such  as  mescaline,  and 
ergoline  derivatives  such  as  LSD.  The  relatively  short 
history of psychedelics in the western world began with 
early  research  on  mescaline  in  the  early  twentieth  cen-
tury  and  was  then  accelerated  by  the  discovery  of  LSD 
by Hofmann in 1943 (Nichols and Walter, 2021). On the 
contrary,  in  Central-  and  South  America  plant-derived 
substances  like  psilocybin,  DMT  (in  the  form  of  aya-
huasca) and mescaline (in the form of peyote and the san 
pedro  cactus)  look  back  on  a  rich  history  in  traditional 
medicinal  and  spiritual  use  of  1´000  to  over  5′000  years 
(Miller et al., 2019, Bruhn et al., 2002, Carod-Artal, 2015, 
Carod-Artal and Vazquez-Cabrera, 2006). The term atyp-
ical  psychedelics  can  be  used  to  summarize  substances 
that  also  induce  characteristic  altered  states  of  con-
sciousness  and  profound  perceptual  changes  but  do  so 
via  various  molecular  mechanisms  and  pharmacological 
receptor profiles (Calvey and Howells, 2018). Two exam-
ples of therapeutic value in psychiatry are the entactogen 
MDMA and the dissociative anesthetic ketamine (and its 
enantiomer esketamine).

LSD, etc.

LSD is a semisynthetic derivative of lysergic acid, which 
naturally occurs in ergot fungi such as Claviceps purpu-
rea, growing parasitically on rye and other types of grass 
(Passie  et  al.,  2008).  Chemically  it  is  an  indole  alkaloid 
with a chiral structure and with only the d-isomer being 
psychoactive.  Pharmacodynamically,  it  shows  a  diversi-
fied  profile  primarily  acting  as  a  partial  agonist  of  sero-
tonin 2A and 1A receptors, but also of other serotonergic 
as well as dopaminergic D1 and D2 and adrenergic recep-
tors.  Pharmacokinetically,  LSD  has  a  high  potency:  the

lower threshold for light subjective effects lies at approxi-
mately 5 µg p.o. (approx. 0.35 µg/kg)(Hutten et al., 2020), 
while the common dose to induce a full psychedelic effect 
is  usually  set  between  100  and  200  µg  p.o.  (approx.  1.4 
bis 2.8 µg/kg)  (Dolder et al., 2017). The duration of these 
effects  is  dose-dependent  and  reported  between  6  and 
11 h with possibly longer lasting aftereffects. The  LD50 is 
varying  between  species  between  0.3  and  60  mg/kg  i.v., 
and  very  rare  overdose-related  deaths  in  humans  were 
mostly linked to suicide or accidents after increased risk-
taking  under  influence  of  the  drug  (Passie  et  al.,  2008; 
Schlag et al., 2022). However, also three cases with poten-
tial  toxicity-linked  deaths  were  reported  (Nichols  and 
Grob, 2018).

Psilocybin

Psilocybin 
(4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) 
is a naturally occurring alkaloid with a tryptamine struc-
ture containing an indole ring and ethylamine substitute 
(Passie et al., 2002). It is found around the globe in over 
200 fungal species, mostly of the genus Psilocybe, which 
are also referred to as Magic Mushrooms. Ceremonial and 
spiritual  human  use  of  these  psychoactive  mushrooms 
has  a  long  tradition  in  indigenous  cultures  especially  in 
South-  and  Central  America,  where  the  mushrooms  are 
regarded  as  sacred  by  the  Mazatec  people  (Miller  et  al., 
2019,  Diaz,  1977,  Wasson,  1980).  Psilocybin  is  a  prod-
rug  that  is  dephosphorylated  into  its  active  compound 
psilocin  which  binds  with  high  affinity  to  serotonin  2A 
and  with  lower  affinity  to  other  serotonergic  receptors. 
It is effective in a dose range of approx. 20 to 40 mg p.o. 
(approx. 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg) with effects lasting about 3 to 
6 h (Brown et al., 2017a). The  LD50 in mice is 280 mg/kg, 
and  very  rare  overdose-related  deaths  in  humans  were 
mostly  linked  to  accidents  after  increased  risk-taking 
under  influence  of  the  drug  (Passie  et  al.,  2002;  Schlag 
et al., 2022).

with  doses  of  200  to  400  mg  (approx.  2.8  to  5.7  mg/kg) 
required for the full effect. With 10 to 12 h, it has a rather 
long duration of effect. The  LD50 varies between species 
(50  to  157  mg/kg  i.v.)  and  there  are  no  reported  lethal 
overdoses  in  humans  (Dinis-Oliveira  et  al.,  2019;  Schlag 
et al., 2022).

Ayahuasca

Ayahuasca is the commonly used name for a plant-based 
brew that has been used in religious rituals in indigenous 
communities  in  the  amazon  region  for  centuries,  with 
recent findings showing the ritual use of ayahuasca ingre-
dients  in  South  America  for  at  least  1′000  years  (Miller 
et al., 2019). Its psychedelic properties are determined by 
the  combination  of  the  classic  psychedelic  DMT,  which 
is  commonly  present  in  Psychotria  viridis,  and  mono-
aminoxidase  inhibitors  (MAO),  such  as  harmaline  and 
harmine,  derived  from  the  liana  Banisteriopsis  caapi 
(Hamill et al., 2019). The combination is necessary to pre-
vent DMT from being degraded by MAO-enzymes in the 
gastrointestinal-tract, when taken orally. The tryptamine-
based  molecule  of  DMT  shows  structural  similarities  to 
psilocybin  and  serotonin  and  the  strong  psychological 
effect  is  mediated  through  serotonin  2A  and  2C  recep-
tor agonism. Analysis of samples taken from the amazon 
region  show  a  wide  spectrum  of  potential  dose  combi-
nations  in  the  used  plants,  where  nine  to  42  mg  DMT 
(approx. 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg) are combined with harmine in 
a dose range of 17 to 280 mg, or harmaline in a range of 5 
to 28 mg, respectively (Gable, 2007). The peak of the aya-
huasca effect lies around 60 to 120 min after oral intake 
with  a  total  expected  duration  of  4  h  (Riba  et  al.,  2003). 
There  is  no  known   LD50  and  although  overall  medical 
risks  of  ayahuasca  seem  to  be  considerably  low,  some 
lethal cases after intake in humans were reported in the 
literature  (Schlag  et  al.,  2022;  Houle  et  al.,  2021;  Heise 
and Brooks, 2017).

Mescaline

MDMA

Mescaline  (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine)  is  a  plant 
derived  phenylethylamine,  which  naturally  occurs  in 
different  cacti  species  such  as  the  Central  American 
peyote-cactus  or  Lophophora  williamsii  and  the  South 
American  san  pedro  cactus  or  Trichocereus  macrogonus 
var.  pachanoi  (Dinis-Oliveira  et  al.,  2019).  Human  ritual 
use of peyote dates back 5′700 years and today mescaline 
is  one  of  the  few  psychedelics  that  can  be  legally  used 
for  religious  purposes  in  the  USA  (Bruhn  et  al.,  2002). 
Chemically,  it  shows  structural  similarities  to  the  syn-
thetic  atypical  psychedelic  MDMA.  Contrary  to  other 
classic  psychedelics,  mescaline  mainly  acts  as  a  seroto-
nin  2C  agonist  and  shows  a  lower  affinity  to  2A  recep-
tors. Consequently, it shows a lower psychedelic potency 

(3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine) 

MDMA 
is  a 
synthetic  amphetamine  derivative  that  is  illicitly  used 
and known worldwide under the name Ecstasy (Simmler 
and  Liechti,  2018).  Due  to  its  euphoric,  pro-social  and 
empathogenic  properties  it  is  commonly  described  as 
entactogen,  but  like  other  synthetic  phenylethylamines 
it can as well be classified as atypical psychedelic. It acts 
as selective agonist at serotonin receptors, directly stim-
ulates  the  release  of  both  serotonin  and  norepinephrine 
and  inhibits  the  reuptake  of  these  two  neurotransmit-
ters plus dopamine. The described serotonin 2A receptor 
agonism  points  to  overlaps  regarding  phenomenologi-
cal  experiences  with  classic  psychedelics.  The  thresh-
old  for  subjective  effects  is  around  50  mg  while  the  full

spectrum  of  drug  effects  is  expected  between  75  and 
125  mg  (approx.  1  to  1.7  mg/kg),  lasting  for  a  duration 
of 5 to 7 h (Simmler and Liechti, 2018). The  LD50 in most 
animal species is around 100 to 300 mg/kg indicating an 
expected   LD50  of  10  to  20  mg/kg  in  humans.  There  are 
multiple reports of lethal MDMA-intoxications in recre-
ational settings, mostly due to dehydration and combined 
drug  intoxications  (Simmler  and  Liechti,  2018;  Holze 
et al., 2020).

Ketamine

including  out-of-body-experiences 

Ketamine is a synthetic cyclohexanone derivative that is 
used  as  an  anesthetic  and  is  listed  on  the  World  Health 
Organizations  list  of  essential  medicines  for  this  indica-
tion  (WHO,  2021).  Chemically,  the  molecule  is  racemic 
with possible configurations as (R)- and (S)-ketamine, the 
latter possessing a higher anesthetic potency (Kamp et al., 
2020). It significantly differs from other anesthetics, as it 
rather  increases  haemodynamic  parameters  (Vankawala 
et  al.,  2021)  and  exerts  dissociative  effects,  sometimes 
even 
(Muetzelfeld 
et al. 2008). It is also used in recreational settings, and it 
can be classified as an atypical psychedelic with distinc-
tive  psychological  effects.  Pharmacodynamically,  it  is 
known  to  inhibit  glutamatergic  N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA)-receptors  in  cortical  regions  and  furthermore 
modulates  GABAA and opioid receptors. Due to its oral 
bioavailability  of  only  17%,  its  clinical  forms  of  use  are 
mostly  intravenous,  intramuscular,  and  intranasal,  but 
also  include  oral,  subcutaneous,  and  sublingual  appli-
cations.  The  common  dose  for  a  psychedelic  ketamine 
effect is around 35 mg i.v. (racemate approx. 0.5 mg/kg) 
and  18  mg  i.v.  (esketamine,  approx.  0.25  mg/kg)  as  an 
infusion  over  a  time  course  of  about  40  min,  with  psy-
choactive effects lasting up to 90 to 120 min (Kamp et al., 
2020; Peltoniemi et al., 2016; Muetzelfeldt et al., 2008). In 
animals, the  LD50 is over 600 mg/kg, being equivalent to 
approx.  4  g  in  humans.  In  the  literature,  there  are  mul-
tiple  reports  of  lethal  intoxications  in  humans,  mostly 
cases  of  combined  drug  intoxications  with  respiratory 
depressants  in  young  males  (Zanos  et  al.,  2018;  Hansen 
et al., 1988; Darke et al., 2021).

Subjective effects
Psychedelic  drugs  have  profound  psychoactive  effects, 
which  are  characteristic  and  reliably  reproducible,  and 
include  alterations  of  perception,  affectivity,  conscious-
ness  and  self,  sometimes  resulting  in  transpersonal  or 
mystical  experiences  (Vollenweider  and  Preller,  2020; 
Nour and Carhart-Harris, 2017). At the same time, how-
ever, they are difficult to describe, due to their disparity 
from  everyday  conscious  experience.  Outside  the  medi-
cal  framework  the  so-called  trip  is  an  overarching  and 

popularly  used  term  to  characterize  the  inner  journey 
people  go  through  after  taking  a  psychedelic  (Bohling, 
2017).  Yet,  the  onset  and  experience  of  these  altered 
states  of  consciousness  are  not  only  determined  by  the 
substance  itself,  but  also  by  the  psychological  state  of 
the individual taking the substance and the surroundings 
this happens in, illustrating two other popular terms: set 
and setting (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018). The comprehen-
sive  similarity  between  classic  and  atypical  psychedelics 
is  exactly  this  phenomenological  trip-structure,  whereas 
the temporal characteristics and details of the subjective 
experience may be distinctly different.

Perception, etc.

On  the  16th  of  April  1943  Albert  Hofmann  involuntar-
ily  came  in  physical  contact  with  LSD,  a  substance  with 
which  he  was  working  during  his  laboratory  investiga-
tions into ergotamine derivates. The consequence was „a 
dreamlike state, with eyes closed, I perceived an uninter-
rupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes 
with  intense,  kaleidoscopic  play  of  colors."  (Hofmann, 
1979,  Hofmann,  2012),  a  beautiful  first-hand  descrip-
tion.  Changes  in  sensory  perception  can  reach  from 
slight  changes  in  visual  and  spatial  perception  to  synes-
thesia  and illusions with colorful moving geometric pat-
terns  and  objects,  up  to  complex  scenic  and  dream-like 
episodes (Kometer and Vollenweider, 2018). The rich and 
diverse perceptual changes under the influence of psych-
edelics  have  inspired  the  work  of  generations  of  artists, 
musicians, and authors, sometimes referred to as psyche-
delic art (Masters and Houston, 1968).

Affectivity

Psychedelic  experiences  are  often  accompanied  by 
changes  in  mood  (often  euphoria)  and  emotional  sensi-
tivity, which in the right supportive setting may even lead 
to profound emotional release and breakthrough experi-
ences (Preller and Vollenweider, 2018). Changes in emo-
tion perception are seen as important mechanisms for the 
reported  antidepressant  effects  of  psychedelics  (Breek-
sema  et  al.,  2020).  While  with  classic  psychedelics,  the 
reported experiences often emphasize on visual-aesthetic 
and  transpersonal  elements,  the  atypical  psychedelic 
MDMA  more  typically  induces  a  strong  emotional-
tactile form of stimulation (Holze et al., 2020). Intensive 
euphoria,  feelings  of  peace  and  perfection  and  a  desire 
for closeness and harmony are frequently reported. This 
can also be associated with a heightened desire for non-
sexual body contact, feelings of affection and empathy for 
surrounding people and an increased wish to communi-
cate (Sumnall et al., 2006). MDMA-induced reprocessing 
of  traumatic  memories  and  emotional  engagement  with 

Bosch et al. International Journal of Bipolar Disorders           (2022) 10:18

therapeutic processes are also understood as core mecha-
nisms,  here  for  the  treatment  of  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder (PTSD) (Feduccia and Mithoefer, 2018).

Consciousness and self

The  consciousness  itself  including  the  perception  of  self 
and time can be deeply altered under psychedelics, some-
times  resulting  in  new  insights  about  oneself  or  a  sense 
of oneness with the environment. In more intense forms, 
total  ego-dissolution  or  a  feeling  of  eternity  may  occur, 
sometimes  described  as  mystical  and  transpersonal 
experiences  (Vollenweider  and  Preller,  2020;  Nour  and 
Carhart-Harris, 2017). These effects explain why psyche-
delic  drugs  were  and  still  are  used  in  spiritual  practices 
around  the  world,  to  transcend  the  structure  of  every-
day reality and to connect to some form of higher entity 
(Baker, 2005). The occurrence of insights and the shifting 
from  a  rigid  self-focus  towards  a  stronger  connected-
ness with the world and beyond, are also understood as 
important  antidepressant  mechanisms  of  psychedelics 
(Breeksema et al., 2020). Ketamine produces distinct dis-
sociative  alterations  of  the  consciousness  and  the  self, 
such  as  derealization  and  depersonalization  (Muet-
zelfeldt  et  al.,  2008).  In  higher  doses,  out-of-body  expe-
riences  and  characteristic  forms  of  ego-dissolution  may 
occur.  In  hedonistic  user  subcultures,  this  dissociation 
from normal body experience and sometimes total inabil-
ity to communicate is referred to as k-hole (Muetzelfeldt 
et al., 2008). Due to this derealization and depersonaliza-
tion,  ketamine  produces  a  more  pronounced  feeling  of 
immobilization  than  other  psychedelics  (Vlisides  et  al.,

Subjective experiences in clinical populations

A  recent  investigation  on  the  subjective  experiences  of 
patients  undergoing  treatments  with  various  psyche-
delics identified some overlapping phenomena of poten-
tial  therapeutic  significance  (Breeksema  et  al.,  2020). 
Fifteen studies were analyzed including 178 patients suf-
fering from various psychiatric disorders including anxi-
ety,  depression,  eating  disorders,  PTSD,  and  substance 
use  disorders.  Substances  included  psilocybin,  LSD, 
ibogaine,  ayahuasca,  ketamine  and  MDMA.  Subjective 
phenomena  that  patients  experienced  as  clinically  and 
personally  important,  were  insights,  altered  self-percep-
tion,  increased  connectedness,  transcendental  experi-
ences, and an expanded emotional spectrum (Breeksema 
et al., 2020).

Psychological adverse effects

Under  the  influence  of  both  classic  and  atypical  psych-
edelics  psychological  complications  and  adverse  effects 
may  occur.  Acute  symptoms  like  disorientation,  panic, 

fear and overwhelming distress—often referred to as bad 
trip—may arise, especially in a difficult setting (Johnson 
et  al.,  2008;  Baylen  and  Rosenberg,  2006;  Perry  et  al., 
2007). In a study investigating negative experiences under 
psilocybin in 1993 recreational users, 39% rated it among 
the  top  five  most  challenging  experiences  of  his/her  life 
and 11% put self or others at risk of physical harm. How-
ever,  84%  reported  still  having  benefited  from  the  expe-
rience  (Carbonaro  et  al.,  2016).  Also,  with  MDMA  bad 
experiences  are  reported  especially  in  higher  doses,  for 
example  in  the  form  of  alterations  of  judgement,  over-
whelming  experiences,  or  feelings  of  total  dissolution 
(Sumnall  et  al.,  2006).  Nevertheless,  an  investigation  on 
potential long-term effects of psychedelics (LSD, psilocy-
bin,  mescaline,  peyote)  after  non-medical  use  in  21′967 
subjects  did  not  show  increased  life-time  risk  for  the 
occurrence of psychiatric disorders (Krebs and Johansen, 
2013).  One  recent  meta-analysis  even  found  decreased 
suicidality  following  psychedelics  administered  in  a 
therapeutic  setting,  which  again  emphasizes  the  impor-
tance  of  set  and  setting  variables  (Zeifman  et  al.,  2022). 
Moreover, also large population-based studies found use 
of  psychedelics  associated  with  reduced  psychological 
distress and suicidality (Hendricks et al., 2015; Jones and 
Nock, 2022b), depression (Jones and Nock, 2022a), low-
ered odds of crime arrests (Jones and Nock, 2022c; Hen-
dricks  et  al.,  2018),  lowered  odds  of  opiate  use  disorder 
(only psilocybin) (Jones et al., 2022), lower odds of heart 
disease and diabetes (Simonsson et al., 2021a), and lower 
odds  of  overweight  (Simonsson  et  al.,  2021b).  However, 
it  should  be  further  noticed  that  psychedelics  have  an 
outstanding  suggestive  potency.  Not  only  in  non-medi-
cal users but also in patients, researchers, and clinicians, 
they may evoke strong expectation biases, increased sug-
gestibility, and idealization. The latter is also illustrated by 
the increasing popularization of these substances among 
various groups (Yaden et al., 2021; Anderson et al., 2020).

Mechanisms of action
Neurobiological mechanisms

The  resurgent  interest  in  the  psychopharmacological 
potential  of  psychedelics  has  led  to  a  deepened  under-
standing of their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. 
In  various  areas  of  interest  from  neurotransmission  and 
receptor activation up to brain connectivity changes and 
network  alterations,  but  also  predictive  processing  and 
neuroplasticity, a tremendous amount evidence has been 
created (Vollenweider and Preller, 2020; McClure-Begley 
and Roth, 2022). Interestingly, there are important paral-
lels to state-of-the-art antidepressants, where alterations 
in  emotional  processing,  social  interaction  and  neuro-
plasticity  are  also  discussed  as  new  therapeutic  mecha-
nisms  (Harmer  et  al.,  2017).  Starting  with  the  receptor

level,  all  classic  psychedelics  act  as  agonists  on  cerebral 
serotonin  2A  receptors,  primarily  on  apical  dendrites 
of  pyramidal  cells  in  layer  V  of  the  neocortex  (Nichols, 
2016). This basic mechanism seems crucial for the broad 
spectrum  of  behavioral  and  subjective  effects  of  these 
drugs.  Already  in  1998,  Vollenweider  and  colleagues 
described  the  fundamental  principle  of  preventing  psy-
chedelic  effects  induced  by  psilocybin  by  simply  block-
ing  serotonin  2A  receptors  using  the  specific  antagonist 
ketanserin (Vollenweider et al., 1998). A finding that was 
later reproduced for the psychedelic effects of DMT and 
LSD (Valle et al., 2016, Preller et al., 2017). The activation 
of serotonin 2A receptors leads to a downstream increase 
in  cortical  glutamate  concentrations  (Martin-Ruiz  et  al., 
2001).  Furthermore,  dopaminergic  neurotransmission  is 
facilitated,  as  shown  with  psilocybin  by  increasing  stri-
atal dopamine release, which was associated with subjec-
tive euphoria and depersonalization (Vollenweider et al., 
1999).  Other  neurotransmitter-modulations  are  diverse 
across  substances,  but  a  potential  causal  relationship 
between other neurotransmitters and characteristic clas-
sic psychedelic effects is still lacking.

Classic  psychedelics  modulate  different  neuronal  net-
works that process sensory perception, the experience of 
self,  and  emotion  regulation,  which  are  relevant  for  the 
neurobiology  of  depression  (Vollenweider  and  Kometer, 
2010;  Vollenweider  and  Preller,  2020).  Several  studies 
demonstrated  classic  psychedelics-induced  decreases  as 
well  as  increases  of  brain  resting  state  functional  con-
nectivity  of  the  default  mode  and  the  salience  networks 
(Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015; Speth et al., 2016; Carhart-
Harris  et  al.,  2017;  Muller  et  al.,  2018;  Pasquini  et  al., 
2020).  Brain  areas  of  interest  are  the  prefrontal  cortex, 
the  thalamus,  the  anterior  and  posterior  cingulum,  and 
the  claustrum,  converging  in  three  core  models  of  the 
neurobiological  mechanisms  of  the  psychedelic  experi-
ence  (Castelhano  et  al.,  2021;  Carhart-Harris  and  Fris-
ton,  2019;  Vollenweider  and  Geyer,  2001).  In  the  CSTC 
model  (from  in  cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical  [CSTC] 
feedback  loops),  psychedelic  phenomena  are  explained 
by a reduction of the thalamic filter-function and a con-
secutive  overload  of  prefrontal  areas  with  internal  and 
external information (Vollenweider and Geyer, 2001). In 
principle, this idea of the brain as a reduction valve dur-
ing everyday conscious experience was already suggested 
by Aldous Huxley in his famous essay The Doors of Per-
ception  (Huxley,  1954).  While  the  thalamic  filter  model 
builds  on  evidence  of  altered  thalamic  gating  in  CSTC 
feedback loops, newer imaging studies provide evidence 
for changes in sensory processing: connectivity between 
sensory cortices increases (potentially explaining the fre-
quent synesthetic phenomena), while integration of asso-
ciative cortical areas decreases (Vollenweider and Preller, 

2020).  The  relaxed  beliefs  under  psychedelics  (REBUS) 
model  postulates  that  the  psychedelic  brain  shows 
increased  neuronal  entropy  in  the  context  of  enhanced 
predictive processing (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). 
This idea builds on the conception of the brain working 
under the premises of Bayesian inference, thus constantly 
generating, and updating prior beliefs of its own state and 
its  environment.  With  reference  to  psychedelic  states, 
the REBUS model suggests that prior beliefs are less con-
strained  and  less  precise  under  the  influence  of  psych-
edelics,  potentially  allowing  a  more  intense  modulation 
of  top-down  cognition  by  incoming  bottom-up  sensory 
stimuli.  Keeping  in  mind  that  rigid  beliefs  and  negative 
biases  about  oneself  and  the  world  are  key  features  of 
depression,  opening  up  these  beliefs  and  biases  for  new 
perspectives  might  already  be  a  mechanism  for  poten-
tial  antidepressant  effects  of  psychedelics  (Carhart-Har-
ris  and  Friston,  2019).  A  third  model,  which  was  partly 
derived  from  resting-state  functional  brain  connectivity 
studies, postulates that characteristic psychedelic effects 
result  from  decreased  control  from  top-down  networks 
and an increase of the excitability of structures process-
ing  sensory,  emotional  and  cognitive  functions,  which 
is  reflected  by  reduced  functional  connectivity  of  and 
within  default  mode  network  (Castelhano  et  al.,  2021). 
Here, the claustrum, a thin area of grey matter between 
the insula and the external capsule that densely expresses 
serotonin  2A  receptors,  may  be  the  core  structure  of 
functional  decoupling  of  top-down  and  bottom-up  net-
works (Doss et al., 2022).

Furthermore,  current  studies  in  animal-  and  in-vitro-
models  provide  evidence  for  mostly  glutamate-induced 
increases  in  neuroplasticity,  likely  also  initiated  by  sero-
tonin  2A  receptor  activation  (Aleksandrova  and  Phil-
lips,  2021;  de  Vos  et  al.,  2021).  Here,  brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most important 
mediators  of  neuroplasticity  under  psychedelics  (Vol-
lenweider & Kometer, 2010). The involved processes are 
responsible  for  the  regulation  of  synaptogenesis,  learn-
ing  and  memory  consolidation.  Moreover,  several  stud-
ies also found evidence for anti-inflammatory properties 
of classic psychedelics (Nichols et al., 2017). These post-
acute  effects  are  seen  as  a  central  element  of  the  long-
lasting therapeutic effects of these drugs (Ly et al., 2018).
A  multitude  of  receptor  mechanisms  and  second-
ary  processes  is  responsible  for  the  effects  of  MDMA 
(Simmler  and  Liechti,  2018).  It  primarily  promotes  the 
release of serotonin, norepinephrine and to a lesser extent 
dopamine.  The  most  important  effects  are  explained  by 
activation of the serotonergic system resulting in reduced 
amygdala-reactivity  to  adverse  stimuli  (Carhart-Har-
ris  et  al.,  2015).  In  addition,  an  increased  release  of  the 
social-bonding  hormone  oxytocin  is  observed  after  the

a 

although 

ingestion of MDMA, which partly explains the prosocial 
and empathogenic effects of the drug (Sessa et al., 2019).
Ketamine  primarily  acts  as  antagonist  at  gluta-
secondary 
matergic  NMDA-receptors, 
activation of glutamatergic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptors can be observed. 
Different  brain  areas  are  involved  in  the  neurobiological 
processing of ketamine’s subjective effects, such as the pre-
frontal  cortex,  the  subgenual  anterior  cingulate  cortex,  the 
hippocampus, and the reward system (Ionescu et al., 2018). 
Compelling evidence points to the central role of increased 
neuroplasticity  for  the  antidepressant  effects  of  ketamine, 
resulting  from  changes  in  the  regulation  of  various  growth 
factors  including  BDNF,  eukaryotic  elongation  factor  2, 
mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  and  glycogen  synthase 
kinase-3 (Zanos and Gould, 2018).

Psychological mechanisms

After  an  interruption  of  almost  50  years,  a  renewed 
interest  for  the  scientific  investigation  of  psychedelics-
induced  psychological  phenomena  and  their  potential 
therapeutic  effects  in  neuropsychiatric  disorders  has 
evolved, recently. Here, alterations in emotion-, self-, and 
social-processing  have  been  identified  as  core  mecha-
nisms (Vollenweider and Preller, 2020).

Emotion‑processing

Several  human  studies  could  show  that  classic  psych-
edelics like LSD and psilocybin reduce affective and neu-
robiological reactions to negative stimuli (Kraehenmann 
et al., 2015, 2016; Mueller et al., 2017). For example, LSD 
(Dolder et al., 2016) and psilocybin (Kometer et al., 2012), 
impair the recognition of fearful face-expressions, which 
is  accompanied  by  reduced  amygdala  reactivity.  These 
changes even seem to be long-lasting, as altered emotion 
perception  after  a  single  dose  of  psilocybin  endured  for 
up to 1 month after administration in patients with treat-
ment  resistant  unipolar  depression  (Stroud  et  al.,  2018). 
Since  a  pronounced  negative  bias  is  seen  as  hallmark 
symptom and etiological factor of major depression, this 
mechanism  could  have  counteracting  effects  and  thus 
exert  a  therapeutic  function.  The  adjustment  of  nega-
tive  biases  might  allow  patients  to  reflect  on  depressive 
thoughts  and  self-percepts  with  a  less  negative  attitude 
and greater psychological flexibility (Wolff et al., 2020).

Consciousness‑ and self‑processing

Altered experiences of the consciousness and the self are 
consistently reported under the influence of psychedelics 
(Nour  and  Carhart-Harris,  2017).  These  include  altered 
self-perception, insights and catharsis, as well as changes 
in  the  self-to-other  discrimination,  to  feelings  of  total 
ego-dissolution,  and  a  mystical  feeling  of  unity  (Milliere 

et  al.,  2018).  Psychedelics-induced  mystical  experiences 
were associated with positive psychological outcomes in 
healthy subjects and patient populations (Johnson et al., 
2019).  In  an  early  study  on  LSD-assisted  psychotherapy, 
insightful  and  cathartic  experiences  were  accompanied 
by clinical improvement (Gasser et al., 2015). The feeling 
of awe, which is an emotion experienced in the presence 
of  an  overwhelming  stimulus  requiring  an  adaptation 
of  mental  constructs,  is  also  discussed  as  an  impor-
tant  mechanism  in  this  context  (Hendricks,  2018).  As 
mentioned  above,  a  comprehensive  review  on  clinically 
important  subjective  phenomena  under  psychedelics 
reported insights, altered self-perception, increased con-
nectedness, transcendental experiences, and an expanded 
emotional spectrum as some of the most significant expe-
riences (Breeksema et al., 2020). It is important to notice 
that plenty of studies have shown a correlation between 
positively experienced self-dissolution or feeling of unity 
and  therapeutic  effects  in  addiction,  anxiety,  and  affec-
tive disorders (Nour and Carhart-Harris, 2017; Roseman 
et al., 2017). However, it is still difficult to unambiguously 
attribute these effects either to the treatment per se or to 
expectation-enhanced placebo effects.

Social‑processing

Additionally,  current  studies  suggest  psychedelics-
induced alterations in social and interpersonal processing 
as important therapeutic mechanisms (Forstmann et al., 
2020; Preller et al., 2018). Social withdrawal and impaired 
social  cognition  are  ubiquitous  in  psychiatric  disorders, 
as both causal and maintaining factors (Fett et al., 2015). 
Psychedelics like psilocybin interfere with these relevant 
mechanisms by reducing negative feelings of social isola-
tion  and  rejection,  and  potentially  reinstating  emotional 
empathy and social reward processes (Preller et al., 2016). 
After one-time administration of psilocybin, patients suf-
fering  from  depression  reported  more  positive  connec-
tion  to  their  social  environment,  which  was  reported  as 
one  of  the  most  important  factors  contributing  to  their 
treatment success (Watts et al., 2017).

Mindfulness and acceptance

In  recent  psychotherapy  approaches,  especially  of  the 
so-called  third  wave,  mindfulness  and  acceptance  are 
important  therapeutic  strategies  for  the  management 
of  psychosocial  distress  (Khoury  et  al.,  2015),  and  there 
is  growing  evidence  that  mindfulness  techniques  and 
psychedelics have synergistic positive effects (Heuschkel 
and  Kuypers,  2020).  Recent  models  aim  at  integrating 
increased  psychological  flexibility  and  acceptance  into 
the  framework  of  psychedelics-assisted  psychotherapy 
(Watts  and  Luoma,  2020;  Wolff  et  al.,  2022).  In  a  study 
with  39  experienced  meditators  receiving  a  single  dose 

 Bosch et al. International Journal of Bipolar Disorders           (2022) 10:18 

Page 8 of 16

of  0.315  mg/kg  psilocybin  p.o.  in  a  placebo-controlled 
design, a significant positive association between psyche-
delic  effects  and  mindfulness  was  observed  (Smigielski 
et al., 2019). Psilocybin led to a deepening of meditative 
states  and  more  intensive  positively  experienced  self-
dissolution.  In  the  4-months-follow-up,  subjects  in  the 
psilocybin group still reported significantly higher mind-
fulness  ratings  and  positive  alterations  in  psychosocial 
functioning compared to placebo (Smigielski et al., 2019). 
Critically  reflecting  the  data,  it  is  important  to  mention 
that studies have not shown additional clinical efficacy of 
mindfulness augmentation of classic cognitive behavioral 
psychotherapy, yet (Cuijpers et al., 2019).

Set and setting in the psychedelics‑assisted psychotherapy

The  variables  of  set  and  setting  were  recognized  as  cru-
cial  therapeutic  factors,  already  in  the  early  phase  of 
the  psychiatric-psychotherapeutic  use  of  psychedelics 
(Gukasyan  and  Nayak,  2021).  Here,  it  is  important  to 
mention that expectancy effects may have a strong ideal-
istic or spiritual undertone in some subcultures (Lieber-
man, 2021). Early psychotherapeutic use of psychedelics 
was orientated at the psychoanalytic methods of its time 
and  aimed  at  releasing  subconscious  and  repressed  psy-
chic material to be integrated in the therapeutic process 
(Nichols  and  Walter,  2021).  This  was  also  mentioned  in 
the  information  material  coming  with  Sandoz  pharma-
ceutical LSD called Delysid (Sandoz, 1964). In this frame-
work, the therapeutic effect is not primarily attributed to 
the substance itself but rather to its capacity to catharti-
cally release blocked emotions and memories, which are 
then  used  as  therapeutic  material  (Harris,  2021).  Here, 
the  early  German  psychedelic  pioneer  Hanscarl  Leuner 
should  be  mentioned,  who  used  his  own  therapeu-
tic  experiences  with  psychedelic  substances  to  develop 
his  psychotherapeutic  technique  of  Guided  Affective 
Imagery (Leuner, 1969). Current therapeutic frameworks 
also  emphasize  on  the  elements  of  set,  setting  and  psy-
chotherapeutic  integration  and  implement  these  ele-
ments  into  new  treatment  paradigms  using  classic  and 
atypical  psychedelics  (Nutt  and  Carhart-Harris,  2021; 
Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011; Dore et al., 2019). The 
result is a concept of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy 
in  which  sporadic  and  professionally  guided  substance 
experiences  should  be  integrated  into  a  continuous  psy-
chotherapy,  with  a  not  yet  defined  duration  and  fre-
quency of sessions.

Ketamine controversy

Both  neurobiological  and  conceptional  differences 
between the therapeutic principles of classic psychedelics 
and MDMA on the one, and ketamine on the other hand 

can be drawn. The use of ketamine and esketamine in its 
intravenous and intranasal solutions initially followed the 
traditional  approach  of  substances  acting  via  molecular 
mechanisms  and  not  necessarily  by  producing  altered 
subjective  experiences.  Indeed,  investigations  show  that 
conscious  phenomenological  changes  appear  not  to  be 
a  necessary  condition  for  the  antidepressant  response 
to  ketamine  (Ballard  and  Zarate,  2020).  However,  also 
ketamine-induced  psychedelic  experiences  might  be  of 
additional therapeutic value, when used in a psychedelic-
assisted psychotherapy context (Mathai et al.,2020, 2022; 
Mollaahmetoglu et al., 2021; Dore et al., 2019).

Psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar and bipolar 
depression

Several  studies  investigating  the  antidepressant  effects 
of  classic  psychedelics  including  LSD,  psilocybin  and 
mescaline  were  performed  in  the  1950s  to  1970s.  These 
studies  did  not  typically  follow  a  double-blind  and  pla-
cebo-controlled design, thus the overall efficacy in reduc-
ing  depressive  symptoms  by  80%  in  a  total  of  over  420 
patients should be interpreted carefully, rather as a posi-
tive signal, than as robust clinical evidence (Rucker et al., 
2016). The international ban on psychedelics also ended 
clinical  research  with  these  molecules,  until  the  current 
revival in the early 2000s (Griffiths et al., 2006). Soon also 
clinical  studies  using  psychedelics  in  psychiatric  condi-
tions  with  affective  symptoms  were  initiated.  In  one  of 
the first such investigations, the effect of a single dose of 
psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) as an adjunct to psychother-
apy  was  tested  on  anxiety  and  depression  in  29  patients 
with cancer. In this double-blind study with an active pla-
cebo-controlled crossover design using niacin, psilocybin 
led  to  a  clinically  significant  symptom  reduction,  which 
was still measurable in 60–80% of the patients at the 6.5-
month  follow-up.  The  authors  identified  the  psilocybin-
induced  mystical  experience  as  a  main  mediator  of  the 
therapeutic  effect  (Ross  et  al.,  2016).  Weaknesses  of  the 
study were functional unblinding due to obvious psyche-
delic  effects  (although  an  active  placebo  was  used)  and 
a  small  and  non-representative  sample,  both  of  which 
are  typical  for  this  phase  of  clinical  psychedelic  studies. 
In another study with 51 terminally ill cancer patients, a 
high dose of psilocybin (22 or 30 mg p.o.) compared to a 
placebo-like low dose of psilocybin (1 or 3 mg p.o.) also 
led  to  a  decrease  of  depressed  mood  and  anxiety,  with 
about 80% of patients continuing to show improvements 
at  a  6-month  follow-up  (Griffiths  et  al.,  2016).  A  first 
open-label feasibility trial in 12 patients with treatment-
resistant unipolar depression using two doses of psilocy-
bin (10 mg and 25 mg p.o.) combined with psychological 
support  showed  promising  results.  Adverse  effects  were

all  transient  and  included  initial  anxiety,  confusion  and 
thought disorder, nausea, and headache, while symptom 
reduction was rapid and sustained up to 3 months after 
high-dose treatment (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016).

Observational and experimental studies in healthy vol-
unteers  offered  indications  that  also  ayahuasca  might 
have antidepressant properties (Dos Santos et al., 2016), 
which  was  confirmed  in  a  first  small  open-label  study 
with  six  depressive  patients  (Osorio  Fde  et  al.,  2015).  In 
a  following  open-label  study  with  a  larger  sample  of  17 
patients  with  recurrent  major  depression,  a  single  dose 
of  ayahuasca  had  a  significant  and  rapid  antidepressant 
effect, which lasted for 3 weeks (Sanches et al., 2016). The 
ayahuasca  potion  contained  0.8  mg/ml  DMT,  0.21  mg/
ml  harmine,  and  no  harmaline,  and  patients  received 
2.2  ml/kg,  resulting  in  individual  doses  of  96  to  160  mg 
of DMT and 25 to 42 mg of harmine. Psychedelic effects 
of the drug were mild, and vomiting was the most com-
mon  adverse  effect  (47%).  A  weakness  of  this  study  was 
that  the  patients  mostly  suffered  from  mild  and  mod-
erate  depression  (only  one  severely  depressed  patient) 
(Sanches et al., 2016).

During this first wave of new open-label clinical inves-
tigations with psychedelics, also LSD was shown to have 
beneficial  effects  in  patients  with  psychiatric  symptoms. 
In 12 patients with life-threatening diseases, two sessions 
with 200 µg and 20 µg LSD p.o. respectively, which were 
integrated  into  psychotherapy,  led  to  a  sustained  reduc-
tion  of  anxiety  (Gasser  et  al.,  2014).  Given  the  standard 
caveats of psychedelic studies such as functional unblind-
ing  and  positive  expectancy  effects  (Lieberman,  2021), 
these  uncontrolled  studies  should  be  interpreted  with 

caution,  especially  as  the  sample  sizes  were  very  small. 
Still,  these  were  important  preliminary  investigations, 
which  added  evidence  to  the  promising  results  of  other 
early  studies  and  inspired  further  investigations  with 
more rigorous designs.

Unfortunatley,  systematic  studies  are  still  limited  to 
unipolar depressed patients, as patients with bipolar dis-
order  have  been  excluded  from  recent  psychedelic  tri-
als  due  to  safety  concerns.  These  concerns  stem  mostly 
from  qualitative  user  reports  or  case  studies,  which 
documented  the  occurrence  of  switches  to  mania  after 
ingestion  of  psychedelics  (see  Table  1).  One  case  study 
of  a  21-year-old  woman  described  the  occurrence  of 
psychotic  mania  about  36  h  after  a  single  ingestion  of 
psilocybin-containing mushrooms, which could be stabi-
lized  first  with  lithium  and  aripiprazole,  and  which  was 
later successfully switched to lamotrigine due to adverse 
effects. The patient had a positive family history of bipo-
lar  disorder  (father  and  paternal  grandmother)  and  was 
suffering depression and PTSD, but was unmedicated at 
the  time  of  the  episode  (Hendin  and  Penn,  2021).  Aya-
huasca  and  DMT  were  also  reported  to  induce  mania 
with psychotic features in patients with bipolar disorder 
or a positive family history of bipolar disorder. A 40-year-
old male psychiatrist with known bipolar disorder (a sin-
gle previous manic episode) was hospitalized with mania 
and  psychosis  after  self-medicating  for  depression.  He 
took up to 1 g daily of vaporized DMT for 6 months and 
then  added  the  MAO  inhibitor  phenelzine  (60  mg  p.o.) 
3  weeks  before  the  hospitalization.  A  combination  of 
lithium 1200 mg/d, paliperidone 6 mg/d, and clonazepam 
3.5 mg/d as sleep aid led to stabilization, but a follow-up

was not possible (Brown et al., 2017b). Another 25-year-
old  male  with  known  bipolar  disorder  and  history  of 
cannabis  abuse,  was  hospitalized  with  mania  with  psy-
chotic  features,  which  occurred  2  days  after  ayahuasca 
ingestion.  Remission  was  achieved  with  a  combination 
of benperidole, olanzapine and lorazepam (Zellner et al., 
2019). A 30-year-old male with previous hypomanic epi-
sodes  and  a  positive  first-degree  family  history  of  bipo-
lar  disorder  developed  mania  with  psychotic  features, 
also  2  days  after  a  ayahuasca  ritual,  which  could  be  sta-
bilized with risperidone 2 mg/d and clonazepam 2 mg/d 
(Szmulewicz  et  al.,  2015).  The  etiological  classification 
of  ayahuasca-related  mania  is  especially  difficult,  as  the 
drug consists of a classic psychedelic (DMT) and a MAO 
inhibitor  (harmine  and  harmaline).  MAO  inhibitors 
are—like other antidepressants—known to induce manic 
switches  in  patients  with  unipolar  depression  (Wada 
et  al.,  2006).  Moreover,  psychosis  with  schizophrenic 
features  such  as  hallucinations  and  paranoid  delusions, 
rather  than  mania,  was  reported  to  be  a  rare  but  possi-
ble  adverse  reaction  to  ayahuasca  or  DMT  use  in  a  sys-
tematic review of existing case reports (Dos Santos et al., 
2017).  LSD  was  reported  to  have  induced  a  first-time 
manic episode with psychotic features after 3 weeks post 
ingestion,  which  could  be  stabilized  with  lithium  treat-
ment (Lake et al., 1981).

First,  this  is  an  important  safety  issue,  which  must  be 
taken into consideration for the design of studies or treat-
ment protocols. Efficient screening procedures regarding 
individual or family history of bipolar disorders should be 
included. Moreover, a rigorous monitoring and follow-up 
of  the  occurrence  of  manic  and/or  psychotic  symptoms 
following psychedelic use should help to identify if these 
substances  pose  safety  concerns  for  populations  with 
affective  disorders.  Furthermore,  as  gathering  of  data  of 
psychedelics in patients with bipolar disorder is difficult 
under  current  conditions,  it  is  important  to  investigate 
if  an  increased  switch-to-mania  rate  can  be  detected  in 
the  studies  with  unipolar  depressed  patients.  A  recent 
ongoing study is investigating the safety, tolerability, and 
feasibility  of  psilocybin  therapy  in  people  with  bipolar 
II  disorder  (NCT05065294,  2022).  Second,  the  reported 
switches-to-mania  might  also  be  an  indicator  for  anti-
depressant  efficacy,  as  most  antidepressant  drugs  are 
known  to  induce  mania  in  a  low  but  significant  propor-
tion of patients with depression (Viktorin et al., 2014). It 
is  important  to  note,  that  the  described  cases  of  psych-
edelics-related  mania  all  included  psychotic  features, 
which is more rarely the case with antidepressant-related 
mania (Stoll et al., 1994). Strikingly, data from user web-
sites also indicate an association of adverse events when 
psychedelics  are  co-administered  with  lithium.  In  fact, 
lithium  in  combination  with  a  classic  psychedelic  was 

associated  with  the  highest  number  of  negative  con-
sequences  including  seizures  (46.8%)  and  bad  trips 
(17.7%)  (n = 62  reports),  while  no  seizures  or  bad  trips 
were  reported  in  combination  with  lamotrigine  (n = 34 
reports) (Nayak et al., 2021).

For  unipolar  depression-studies  a  four-step  treatment 
approach has been developed: 1. assessment, 2. prepara-
tion, 3. experience and 4. integration (Nutt and Carhart-
Harris,  2021).  In  the  first  step  the  psychological  and 
somatic eligibility is thoroughly assessed. In this process, 
a  history  of  psychotic  or  bipolar  disorder  in  patients  or 
first-degree  relatives  is  widely  considered  as  exclusion 
criterion.  Patients  with  relevant  somatic  impairments 
such  as  uncontrolled  or  severe  arterial  hypertonia  are 
also  excluded  from  participation.  Serotonergic  medica-
tion such as selective serotonin inhibitors often needs to 
be tapered down with special attention given to possible 
discontinuation  syndromes.  Especially  for  ayahuasca, 
which includes MAO-inhibiting harmine and harmaline, 
a  combination  with  serotonergic  drugs  is  contraindi-
cated.  The  second  step  aims  to  prepare  the  participants 
by  explaining  the  range  of  possible  effects  and  potential 
challenges  and  setting  the  right  attitude  for  the  psyche-
delic  experience.  Any  potential  concerns  are  addressed 
and  a  trusting  relationship  to  the  therapist  and  to  the 
study  environment  should  be  established.  The  experi-
ence itself is then taking place in a comfortable and safe 
living-room-like  setting,  usually  with  the  option  to  lis-
ten  to  relaxing  music  and  to  use  blindfolds.  The  patient 
is  invited  to  self-center,  close  the  eyes,  and  observe  the 
unfolding  experience.  During  the  experience  the  thera-
pist  is  usually  not  actively  interfering  but  remains  in  a 
supportive  and  if  necessary,  reassuring  role.  Already  on 
the  following  day,  the  first  post-experience  integration 
session is conducted with the same therapist. The experi-
ences and potential insights are gathered, integrated, and 
worked with in the further therapeutic process. Usually, 
more sessions follow to process the experience over time 
and  provide  integration  into  everyday  life  with  the  aim 
of finally facilitating lasting psychological and behavioral 
changes.

After the above mentioned first explorative and open-
label  studies  were  performed  successfully,  three  more 
robust  classic  psychedelics  treatment  studies  with  more 
rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled designs in uni-
polar  depression  followed,  one  with  ayahuasca  and  two 
with psilocybin (Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Davis et al., 
2021;  Palhano-Fontes  et  al.,  2019).  Ayahuasca  showed 
rapid  antidepressant  effects 
treatment-resistant 
depression  in  a  recent  Brazilian  study  (Palhano-Fontes 
et  al.,  2019).  The  ayahuasca  potion  was  applied  in  ml/
kg,  which  corresponded  to  doses  of  0.36  mg/kg  DMT, 
1.86 mg/kg harmine, 0.24 mg/kg harmaline, and 1.2 mg/

in

kg  tetrahydroharmine,  and  was  compared  to  an  active 
placebo of comparable color and taste including zink sul-
fate,  which  induced  low  to  modest  gastrointestinal  dis-
tress. The  study  was  conducted  using  a  parallel-arm  (14 
ayahuasca  and  15  placebo),  double-blind,  randomized, 
placebo-controlled  design  in  patients  with  treatment-
resistant  depression,  but  also  76%  with  comorbid  per-
sonality  disorders.  The  response  rates  were  high  for  the 
ayahuasca and the placebo groups on days one and two, 
and  were  significantly  higher  for  ayahuasca  on  day  7, 
while  the  between-groups  remission  rate  showed  only  a 
trend towards significance on day seven (Palhano-Fontes 
et  al.,  2019).  A  strength  of  the  study  was  the  use  of  an 
active  placebo  with  some  ayahuasca-like  adverse  effects 
such as nausea and anxiety, but this probably also led to 
higher  response  rates  in  the  placebo  group.  Even  more 
so, as the sample included a high percentage of comorbid 
personality disorders (most of the cluster B), which tend 
to present higher placebo responses (Ripoll, 2013). Here, 
a  lager  sample  size  would  certainly  have  helped  to  pro-
duce clearer results. Moreover, no considerable follow-up 
was conducted to assess effects posterior to the seventh 
day time point.

A  randomized  clinical  trial  investigating  the  effects 
of  two  psilocybin  sessions  (session  1:  0.28  mg/kg;  ses-
sion  2:  0.42  mg/kg)  combined  with  supportive  psycho-
therapy  compared  to  a  delayed-treatment  waiting  list  in 
27  patients  with  treatment-resistant  depression,  showed 
a response in 71% of the patients at weeks one and four, 
and  remission  in  58%  at  week  one  and  in  54%  at  week 
four  (adjusted  for  the  delay  period)  (Davis  et  al.,  2021). 
The delayed treatment waiting list design is an interesting 
method  to  reduce  the  effect  of  functional  unblinding  in 
studies with psychedelics. Still, expectancy effects cannot 
be ruled out with this approach. Other weaknesses of this 
study were the small sample size and a short-term follow-
up period.

For psilocybin, a recent phase-2-study with 59 patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  unipolar  depression  showed 
a  similar—but  not  greater—efficacy  of  the  substance 
compared  to  the  SSRI  escitalopram  over  a  duration  of 
6  weeks  (Carhart-Harris  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  double-
blind,  randomized,  controlled  trial,  30  patients  received 
two  separate  doses  of  25  mg  psilocybin  3  weeks  apart 
plus  6  weeks  of  daily  placebo  (psilocybin  group)  and  29 
patients  received  two  separate  doses  of  1  mg  psilocybin 
3  weeks  apart  plus  6  weeks  of  daily  escitalopram  (escit-
alopram  group),  while  all  patients  received  psychologi-
cal  support.  Comparisons  of  the  changes  of  depression 
scores,  response  and  remission  rates  at  week  6  showed 
only  trend-wise  superiority  of  psilocybin  compared  to 
escitalopram (Carhart-Harris et al., 2021). Until now, this 

rigorous  study  provides  the  qualitatively  highest  stand-
ing  evidence  on  the  antidepressant  properties  of  psilo-
cybin.  Although  it  does  not  prove  a  superiority  on  the 
primary endpoint, it does overall show an at least  equal 
antidepressant  effect  along  with  substantially  less  phar-
macological  exposition  within  the  6  weeks  of  the  trial 
(daily  administration  of  SSRI  compared  to  two  psilocy-
bin  sessions).  Nevertheless,  the  study  has  considerable 
limitations  such  as  being  underpowered  (potential  for 
false  negative  results),  and  that  the  improvement  in  the 
escitalopram group was not even on a standard placebo 
level. Moreover, standard psychedelics studies limitations 
like functional unblinding and expectancy effects for spe-
cifically  selected  (and  highly  interested  in  psychedelics) 
patients  who  are  mostly  recruited  via  advertisement  do 
persist  (Carhart-Harris  and  Friston,  2019,  Lieberman, 
2021). This can only be addressed in head-to-head com-
parisons  in  further  robust  studies  with  larger  and  inde-
pendent  study  populations.  Another  potential  challenge 
in  this  treatment  paradigm  is  the  intensity  in  terms  of 
time  and  therapeutic  resources  as  a  guided  psilocybin 
session requires around 6 h of therapist presence. Should 
psychedelic  assisted  psychotherapy  be  made  available 
for larger parts of the population it is crucial to provide 
a  reliable  framework  for  the  role  of  medical  doctors, 
therapist training and supervision and an overall appro-
priate and safe application of these substances (Nutt and 
Carhart-Harris, 2021). Further studies will hopefully help 
to  elaborate  how  populations  with  diverging  attitudes 
and  vulnerabilities  may  react  to  these  potentially  very 
intense and challenging experiences. This is of particular 
importance  regarding  patients  with  bipolar  depression, 
as  classic  psychedelics  seem  to  be  associated  with  the 
induction  of  manic  switches  and,  in  combination  with 
lithium,  of  epileptic  seizures  and  bad  trips  (Lake  et  al., 
1981;  Hendin  and  Penn,  2021;  Szmulewicz  et  al.,  2015; 
Viktorin et al., 2014). Careful precautions are needed to 
prevent people from misuse and to establish reliable and 
professionalized medical procedures for the use of these 
promising substances.

In  conclusion,  the  current  outcome  of  studies  with 
classic psychedelics in patients with unipolar depression 
is very promising, but not yet definitive. Further studies 
with larger sample sizes are warranted to establish clini-
cal  efficiency  and  later,  adjustments  in  legal  and  thera-
peutic  frameworks  will  be  necessary  conditions  for  an 
approval of these substances in major depression.

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is currently not inves-
tigated in the treatment of unipolar or bipolar depression, 
but promising evidence was produced for the treatment 
of PTSD. A recent phase-3-study showed good tolerabil-
ity and efficacy in 90 patients with severe PTSD (Mitchell 

 Bosch et al. International Journal of Bipolar Disorders           (2022) 10:18 

Page 12 of 16

et  al.,  2021).  These  encouraging  results  for  MDMA  in 
PTSD patients led to a designation as breakthrough ther-
apy granted by the US Food and Drug Administration, a 
status that was recently also granted to psilocybin in the 
treatment of depression.

The  antidepressant  properties  of  ketamine  have  first 
been published in the year 2000 and have since then been 
established  in  a  considerable  amount  of  randomized 
controlled trials and meta-analyses (Berman et al., 2000; 
Bahji  et  al.,  2021;  McIntyre  et  al.,  2020).  These  stud-
ies  show  that  both  the  initially  investigated  intravenous 
use,  but  also  the  intranasal  application  of  ketamine  and 
esketamine  show  rapid  therapeutic  effects  in  unipolar 
depression.  However,  a  recent  meta-analysis  suggests  a 
potentially  stronger  effect  of  i.v.  applications,  although 
potential  placebo  and  expectancy  effects  of  this  route 
of  application  are  discussed  (Bahji  et  al.,  2021).  For 
both  ketamine  i.v.  and  esketamine  i.n.  an  antisuicidal 
effect  was  confirmed  in  a  recent  meta-analysis  (Xiong 
et  al.,  2021).  Subsequently,  ketamine  is  currently  being 
included  in  international  treatment  guidelines  as  an 
augmentation  therapy  for  treatment-resistant  unipolar 
depression  (Swainson  et  al.,  2021).  Moreover,  a  recent 
Cochrane  analysis  also  showed  limited  but  existing  evi-
dence for antidepressant effects of single ketamine infu-
sions  in  combination  with  mood  stabilizers  in  bipolar 
depression (Dean et al., 2021). Further larger studies are 
needed  to  determine  the  safety  profile  and  therapeutic 
effects of ketamine and esketamine in these patients.

Conclusions
Since  outcomes  of  currently  available  antidepressant 
treatments  are  limited,  and  parts  of  the  pharmaceutical 
industry  have  withdrawn  from  psychopharmacological 
drug  development,  the  demand  for  innovative  therapies 
is  high  and  growing.  Here,  psychedelics  and  psyche-
delic-assisted  psychotherapy  offer  new  and  promising 
approaches  for  research  and  clinical  treatments  in  psy-
chiatry.  Despite  limitations  like  functional  unblinding 
and  expectancy  effects,  a  growing  number  of  small  and 
medium  sized  studies  show  encouraging  effects  in  psy-
chiatric disorders such as unipolar depression and PTSD. 
Investigating  classic  psychedelics  in  patients  with  bipo-
lar  disorder  is  not  yet  recommended,  as  an  association 
with switches to mania has been reported in case studies. 
Therefore, the investigation and monitoring of the occur-
rence of manic symptoms should be a standard practice 
in all psychedelic studies in clinical populations.

At  the  same  time,  an  increasing  popularization  of 
psychedelics  is  observable,  with  obvious  parallels  to 
the  1960s  including  idealization  in  certain  subcultures 

and  spreading  uncontrolled  use.  Here,  the  urgency  of  a 
strictly  scientific,  thoughtful,  and  professional  clinical 
practice  comes  into  play,  again.  It  will  depend  on  some 
crucial  factors,  whether  the  current  renaissance  of  psy-
chedelic  substances  will  be  fruitful  and  sustainable  on  a 
broader  societal  level.  One  important  factor  will  be  the 
implementation of strict ethical and practical standards, 
controlled  and  legitimized  by  the  professional  medical 
societies  through  transparent  and  peer-reviewed  pro-
cesses (Anderson et al., 2020; Petranker et al., 2020). Fur-
ther,  longitudinal  studies  with  larger  sample  sizes  und 
independent  study  populations  will  be  needed  to  estab-
lish the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics in psychiatric 
conditions (Vollenweider and Preller, 2020). Under these 
premises, an integration of these promising and fascinat-
ing  substances  into  contemporary  biomedicine  seems 
feasible and even desirable.
