Abstract

Objective: This study examined relations between acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) 
constructs and symptom-based subgroups of advanced cancer patients.

Methods: Patients with advanced breast, gastrointestinal, lung, and prostate cancer (N=201) 
completed questionnaires assessing five common symptoms and ACT variables (i.e., 
psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, values obstruction and progress, peaceful acceptance, 
mindfulness, and activity engagement) on one occasion.

Results: Latent profile analysis showed three patient classes: (1) normal levels of all symptoms 
(32%); (2) normal levels of all symptoms except for mild sleep problems and moderate fatigue 
(19%); and (3) normal pain, mild levels of sleep problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and 
moderate fatigue (48%). Controlling for demographic covariates, lower psychological inflexibility, 
cognitive fusion, and values obstruction were associated with a higher likelihood of being in 
classes 1 or 2 than class 3. In addition, greater values progress, peaceful acceptance, mindfulness, 
and activity engagement were associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 1 than class 
3. Of these four factors, only greater mindfulness and activity engagement were associated with a 
higher likelihood of being in class 2 than class 3.

Conclusions: Advanced cancer patients show heterogeneous symptom profiles, and even mild 
to moderate symptom levels are related to greater withdrawal from personally meaningful 
activities and less acceptance of cancer and internal experiences (e.g., symptoms, thoughts, 
feelings). Findings are consistent with the ACT model and support further testing of ACT to 
address symptom interference with functioning in advanced cancer patients.

Background

Page 2

Advanced cancer patients face progressive functional decline and symptoms that are a major 
source of suffering, impairment, and disability.1–3 Prevalent symptoms include fatigue, sleep 
disturbance, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pain.1,4 These symptoms often co-occur, and 
symptom clusters have predicted health and quality-of-life outcomes in advanced cancer.4,5

A growing body of research has examined mindfulness and acceptance-based interventions 
to reduce symptom-related suffering in cancer patients.6,7 These interventions, such as 
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), aim to reduce symptom interference with 
functioning.6 ACT is designed to increase psychological flexibility so that difficult internal 
experiences (e.g., symptoms, feelings, thoughts) interfere less with meaningful activities. 
According to the ACT model,8 psychological flexibility is defined as fully experiencing 
the present moment while persisting in actions aligned with personal values. Psychological 
flexibility is facilitated by six psychological skills (i.e., acceptance, defusion, being present, 
self-as-context, values, committed action). Acceptance is full awareness of experiences 
without defense, and defusion involves noticing thoughts without getting caught up in 
their content. Being present involves non-judgmental attention to current experiences, and 
self-as-context is flexible perspective-taking. These four skills comprise mindfulness and 
acceptance processes associated with value-based action. Values are personally meaningful 
life directions (e.g., being an engaged parent), and committed action is effective behavior 
linked to chosen values. In the broad ACT literature, certain ACT processes (e.g., 
acceptance) have mediated mental health and functional outcomes; however, studies had 
methodological limitations.9

While traditional CBT focuses on changing difficult thoughts and reducing distress, ACT 
views distress and suffering as normative and instead targets the behavioral impact of 
difficult thoughts.6 This is accomplished through mindful acceptance of internal experiences 
and aligning actions with values. ACT is well suited for advanced cancer patients who 
often struggle with normative distress and barriers to value-based action, given their physical 
limitations. Furthermore, value-based action may be particularly meaningful when time is 
perceived as limited.

ACT has produced promising results in pilot trials with advanced cancer patients.10–13 In 
a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with late-stage ovarian cancer patients, ACT had 
large effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms and global quality of life compared to 
cognitive-behavioral therapy.11 Another pilot RCT with metastatic breast cancer patients 
found that ACT showed strong evidence of feasibility and promise with respect to fatigue 
and sleep interference with functioning relative to education/support.10

Although ACT has been tested in a few pilots with advanced cancer patients,10–13 
establishing relationships between ACT constructs and symptoms would bolster the 
theoretical foundation for large-scale trials. To date, one study of metastatic breast 
cancer patients linked higher symptom burden to disengagement from valued activities 
and psychological inflexibility,14 and another study found that mindfulness facets were 
negatively correlated with physical and psychological symptoms in this population.15

Among advanced prostate cancer patients, higher levels of mindfulness facets were also 
associated with reduced distress.16 Building on this limited literature, the current study 
examined associations between a number of ACT constructs and subgroups of advanced 
solid-tumor patients based on symptom levels. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to 
group patients by levels of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and 
pain. Based on the ACT model8 and previous research,14–16 we hypothesized that patients 
with higher symptom levels would show higher psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, 
and values obstruction and lower values progress, peaceful acceptance, mindfulness, and 
activity engagement than patients with lower symptom levels.

Methods

Participants and Procedures

The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved study procedures 
(1712548641). Participants were recruited from a public hospital, an academic medical 
center, and affiliated clinics in Indiana between February and October 2018. Potential 
participants were identified through institutional cancer registries, and eligibility was 
confirmed through medical chart review. Eligible patients met the following inclusion 
criteria: (1) diagnosis of breast, gastrointestinal (GI), lung, or prostate cancer; (2) at least 
3 weeks post-diagnosis of stage IV cancer or completed primary treatment for stage I or II 
cancer at least 6 months ago (ongoing endocrine therapy was allowed); (3) ≥18 years old; 
and (4) fluent in English. Patients were excluded if there was evidence of severe cognitive 
impairment based on investigator judgement or exceeding a clinical cut point (≥3 errors) 
on a 6-item cognitive screener.17 The screener’s diagnostic properties are comparable to the 
Mini-Mental Status Exam.17

Potentially eligible patients were mailed a study information sheet and introductory letter 
with contact information for opting out. Research assistants called patients who did not opt 
out to administer the cognitive screener17 and obtain verbal informed consent. Consenting 
patients were sent an online or paper survey, depending on their preference. Reminder calls 
were made as necessary, and those sent an online survey also received automated email 
reminders. Once the survey was received, participants were mailed a $25 gift card.

Of the 701 patients who were mailed a study introductory letter and consent form, 
592 (84%) were reached via phone. Of those reached, 99 (17%) refused to participate 
and 29 (5%) were ineligible or deceased. Common reasons for refusal included lack of 
interest and time constraints. Of the 464 patients who provided verbal consent, 430 (93%) 
completed REDCap or paper surveys. Only participants who were diagnosed with stage IV 
cancer (n=201) were included in the current analyses, as their symptom profiles differed 
from survivors who had completed primary treatment. Our findings on early-stage cancer 
survivors are reported elsewhere.18

Measures

Page 4

Demographic and medical information—Age, gender, and cancer information were 
obtained via chart review. Participants self-reported other demographics and whether they 
had been diagnosed or treated for 12 medical comorbidities within the past three years.19

Physical and psychological symptoms—Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) measures were used to assess symptom severity during the 
past week.20 Four-item PROMIS measures were used to assess sleep disturbance, fatigue, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms and a 3-item PROMIS measure was used to assess pain 
intensity. For each PROMIS measure, T-scores anchored on the U.S. general population 
were computed, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. PROMIS measures 
have undergone rigorous testing20 and have evidence of reliability and validity in cancer 
patients.21 Based on prior research,22,23 T-scores <50 for the fatigue measure and T-scores 
<55 for sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and pain measures are considered normal. 
Mild severity is defined as T-scores of 50–54 for fatigue, 55–60 for sleep disturbance and 
pain, and 55–64 for anxiety and depression. Moderate severity is defined as T-scores of 55–
74 for fatigue, 60–70 for sleep disturbance and pain, and 65–74 for anxiety and depression.

ACT constructs—ACT measures were selected for their brevity and good psychometric 
properties with cancer patients. The measures encompass all six ACT skills, except for 
self-as-context, given the lack of validated measures for cancer patients. For each measure, 
higher scores indicate greater experience of the measured construct.

Psychological inflexibility was assessed with the 7-item Acceptance and Action 
Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II).24 The AAQ-II has demonstrated good reliability and validity 
in the general population24 and has evidence of good internal consistency in prior research 
with cancer patients.14 Patients rated each item on a 7-point scale (1=never true, 7=always 
true).

Cognitive fusion was assessed with the 7-item Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ).25 
The CFQ has demonstrated good reliability and was a strong predictor of anxiety in cancer 
patients.26 Patients rated each item on a 7-point scale (1=never true, 7=always true).

Values-based living was assessed with the 10-item Valuing Questionnaire (VQ),27 which 
consists of obstruction and progress subscales. The VQ subscales have demonstrated good 
reliability and validity in the general population27 and have been used in prior research with 
cancer patients.14 Patients rated each item on a 7-point scale (1=never true, 7=always true).

Peaceful acceptance was assessed with the 7-item Peaceful Acceptance subscale of the 
Peace, Equanimity, and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience (PEACE) measure.28 This 
subscale has demonstrated reliability and validity in research with advanced cancer 
patients.28 Items are answered on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 4=to a large extent).

Mindfulness was assessed with the 5-item Acting with Awareness, Nonjudging, and 
Nonreactivity subscales of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form (FFMQ­
SF).29 These subscales have demonstrated good internal consistency and predicted health

Analysis

outcomes in previous research with advanced cancer patients.15 Acting with Awareness and 
Nonjudging subscales were combined to assess mindfulness for the current analysis, as they 
were correlated in our sample (r=.46, p<.01). Nonreactivity showed small correlations with 
these subscales and was excluded from analyses. Patients rated each item on a 5-point scale 
(1=never or very rarely true, 5=very often or always true). All items for the Acting with 
Awareness subscale are reverse-coded.

Activity engagement was assessed with the 6-item PROMIS measure of ability to participate 
in roles and activities, including leisure, social roles, and work (including housework).20 
Patients rated each item on a 5-point scale (1=always, 5=never). Items are reverse-coded.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics, medical information, and main 
study variables. Correlations between symptoms and ACT constructs were computed in 
SPSS, v.25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.). Then an LPA was conducted with Mplus v.830 
to identify possible latent classes or subgroups of advanced cancer patients based on 
observed patterns of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pain. This 
person-centered analysis mirrors the subtyping that occurs in clinical practice. Missing data 
were managed using the full information maximum likelihood. Model fit indices, including 
information criteria (i.e., Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC] and Akaike Information 
Criterion [AIC]) and the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (VLMR LRT), were 
assessed to determine the final number of patient subgroups. Good model fit was evaluated 
as: (1) lower values of the information criteria, (2) a statistically significant value for the 
VLMR LRT,31 (3) feasibility of class interpretation,32 and (4) entropy >.80.33,34 As LPA is 
exploratory, no formal power analysis based on sample size is possible; however, simulation 
studies suggest our sample size was adequate for model convergence.35

Multinomial logistic regressions using Vermunt’s 3-step approach36 were performed in 
Mplus to examine the degree to which demographic and medical factors were associated 
with patient subgroups based on symptoms. Then multinomial logistic regressions using 
Vermunt’s 3-step approach were also used to assess relations between ACT constructs 
(independent variables) and patient subgroups (dependent variables), controlling for 
significant demographic and medical correlates of subgroups. Given the small number of 
cases with missing data (n=8), listwise deletion was employed for regression analyses. To 
balance the potential for Type I and II error, p<.01 was considered statistically significant.

Patient characteristics are presented in Supporting Information Table 1. Patients were mostly 
White (80%) and 51% were male, with an average age of 62 years.

Descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alphas, and correlations between main study variables 
are shown in Supporting Information Table 2 (ns=198–201). Significant correlations 
were found between all five symptoms and psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, 
values obstruction, and activity engagement (rs= −.65-.66, ps<.01). Peaceful acceptance 
and mindfulness were significantly associated with all symptoms (rs= −.58 – −.22,

ps<.01) except for pain (rs= −.14, −.18, ps=.05, .01, respectively). Values progress was 
significantly associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms (rs=−.34, −.39, ps<.01, 
respectively), but associations with other symptoms fell short of statistical significance 
(rs=−.18 – −.16, ps=.01–.02). All measures had good to excellent internal consistency 
(αs=.80-.97).

Six latent profile models were estimated to identify patient subgroups based on the severity 
of fatigue, sleep problems, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pain. Anxiety and depressive 
symptoms were allowed to covary in this analysis, as they were highly correlated in our 
sample. Although information criteria (i.e., BIC and AIC) favored the 4-class solution (see 
Supporting Information Table 3), the VLMR LRT indicated that the 4-class model did not 
fit the data significantly better than the 3-class model, and class sizes and interpretability 
were markedly reduced. The 3-class solution was chosen based on model fit indices, good 
class separation, and adequate class size. Importantly, the 3-class solution was the most 
conceptually meaningful. Class 1 (n=65, 32%) was the least symptomatic with normal levels 
of all symptoms.22,23 Class 2 (n=39, 19%) reported normal levels of all symptoms except for 
mild sleep problems and moderate fatigue. Class 3 (n=97, 48%) was the most symptomatic 
with mild levels of sleep problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, moderate fatigue, and 
normal pain. Descriptive statistics for symptoms and ACT constructs by class are presented 
in Table 1.

Using multinomial logistic regression, demographics and medical factors were assessed 
as potential correlates of classes based on symptoms. Female gender, lower income, and 
being diagnosed with breast as compared to prostate cancer were associated with a higher 
likelihood of being in class 3 than class 1 (gender: OR=.37, CI [.14, .94]; income: OR=4.80, 
CI [1.34, 17.13]; breast vs. prostate cancer: OR=.11, CI [.02, .60]). Due to the overlap of 
gender and cancer type, cancer type was not included as a covariate in subsequent analyses. 
Controlling for gender and income, multinomial logistic regressions showed significant 
relationships between ACT constructs and classes based on symptoms (see Table 2). Results 
were largely consistent with our hypothesis. Lower levels of psychological inflexibility, 
cognitive fusion, and values obstruction were associated with a higher likelihood of being 
in classes 1 or 2 than class 3. Additionally, greater levels of values progress, peaceful 
acceptance, mindfulness, and activity engagement were associated with a higher likelihood 
of being in class 1 than class 3. Of these four variables, only greater mindfulness and activity 
engagement were associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 2 than class 3.

Discussion

In this study, we identified subgroups of advanced solid tumor patients based on the 
severity of common symptoms and examined their relations to ACT constructs. Three 
patient subgroups were found: those with normal levels of all symptoms; those with normal 
levels of all symptoms except for mild sleep problems and moderate fatigue; and those with 
normal pain, mild levels of sleep problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and moderate 
fatigue. Previous studies have also found heterogeneous clustering and severity of symptoms 
in advanced cancer patients.4,5,14 In our study, compared to patients with normal levels of all 
symptoms, the other patient subgroups showed higher psychological inflexibility, cognitive

fusion, and values obstruction as well as lower mindfulness and activity engagement. 
Additionally, compared to those with normal symptoms, the most symptomatic subgroup 
showed lower peaceful acceptance and values progress. Results are largely consistent with 
our hypothesis and the ACT model,8 suggesting that patients with even mild to moderate 
symptoms show greater attempts to control their thoughts and feelings and less peaceful 
acceptance of their illness. In addition, patients with higher symptom levels reported less 
engagement in work and social activities and perceived less progress in pursuing personal 
goals.

Previous research found that greater psychological inflexibility, or avoidance of difficult 
internal experiences, was correlated with higher symptom burden in metastatic breast cancer 
patients.14 Among patients with mixed cancer types and stages, greater psychological 
inflexibility has also been associated with worse psychological and social outcomes.37,38 
Our findings extend this work by relating this avoidance to physical and psychological 
symptoms in patients with various advanced cancers. One possible reason for these findings 
is that avoidance of unwanted thoughts, feelings, and sensations is a method of coping with 
cancer-related symptoms. In addition, attempts to avoid symptoms may exacerbate them, as 
patients may refrain from seeking appropriate medical attention or employ symptom control 
strategies that are inconsistent with personal values (e.g., avoiding activities with loved 
ones to conserve energy). Another possibility is that psychological inflexibility is a process 
undertaken by patients with high neuroticism, which leads to increased symptoms.39

This study also examined aspects of psychological flexibility in relation to symptom 
experiences. Higher levels of mindfulness facets—acting with awareness and nonjudging—
were associated with lower symptom levels. Prior studies have also linked these mindfulness 
facets to less distress in advanced breast and prostate cancer patients as well as lower 
levels of physical symptoms in advanced breast cancer.15,16 Greater mindful attention to 
present experiences may lead to reduced symptom burden, as compassionate awareness of 
bodily sensations may prompt wise action (e.g., seeking care). In addition, a non-judgmental 
attitude toward internal experiences, a core aspect of mindfulness and psychological 
flexibility, may lessen emotional reactivity to symptoms. In our study, greater acceptance 
of the cancer experience was also associated with reduced symptoms, whereas greater 
cognitive fusion, a process by which behavior is overly influenced by one’s thoughts, was 
associated with higher symptom levels. Acceptance of cancer showed small-to-moderate, 
negative correlations with distress outcomes in a meta-analysis.40 However, cognitive fusion 
has rarely been examined in the cancer literature, with one study associating it with greater 
distress in survivors of various cancers.26 Values and committed action have also received 
limited empirical attention in cancer, with one study linking values obstruction to greater 
symptom burden in advanced breast cancer.14 Our results suggest that advanced cancer 
patients with mild to moderate symptoms reduce their involvement in social, leisure, and 
work activities and perceive less progress in achieving values-based goals than those with 
normal symptom levels.

Study Limitations

Page 8

Limitations of this study warrant mention. The majority of patients were non-Hispanic 
White, and the cross-sectional design precluded examination of temporal relationships 
between variables. Symptom measures included items assessing symptom severity and 
interference with functioning. From an ACT perspective, patients with higher levels of 
psychological inflexibility are expected to have greater symptom interference, but not 
necessarily more severe symptoms than other patients.6 ACT theorists view cancer-related 
symptoms as normative.6 Thus, symptom severity and interference should be measured 
separately in future studies. Additionally, the incremental and discriminant validity of the 
AAQ-II has been questioned.39 Although these questions could not be fully addressed in our 
study, the measure was moderately correlated with distress and showed similar correlations 
with symptoms relative to other ACT measures (e.g., FFMQ-SF, CFQ). In addition, self-as­
context was not examined. Finally, LPA is an exploratory approach and, thus, results warrant 
replication.

Clinical Implications

Our results suggest that even mild to moderate symptoms may disrupt values-based 
goal pursuit among advanced cancer patients. Alternatively, disengagement from valued 
activities, including self-care, may lead to increased distress and symptom burden. To 
supplement standard interventions for symptom reduction, clinicians may assess the degree 
to which patients have disengaged from activities and help them set feasible goals aligned 
with their values. The distinct patient subgroups in this study suggest that certain patients 
may benefit from more intensive treatment, an approach used in stepped care models. For 
example, patients with symptoms of anxiety, depression, or fatigue may especially benefit 
from discussion of barriers to value-based action and techniques to reduce the behavioral 
impact of unhelpful thoughts.

Based on the current findings and promising pilot trials in advanced cancer,10–13 
mindfulness and acceptance may be targeted in interventions to reduce symptom 
interference with functioning. Mindfulness may be increased through meditation or 
purposeful attention during activities. Interventions that might foster acceptance of cancer 
warrant further study. For example, acceptance may be an outcome of emotionally 
processing the losses associated with the diagnosis and integrating the experience into one’s 
worldview.40

Finally, income was more strongly associated with patient subgroups based on symptoms 
than any of the psychological variables. This finding underscores the importance of 
attending to both practical and psychological needs and addressing health disparities.

Conclusions

Many advanced cancer patients have symptoms that interfere with functioning.1–3 Our 
results in combination with prior research10–13 provide a strong rationale for large-scale 
trials of ACT to reduce symptom interference in advanced cancer and promote feasible 
engagement in activities that enrich quality of life. If found to be efficacious, ACT could be
