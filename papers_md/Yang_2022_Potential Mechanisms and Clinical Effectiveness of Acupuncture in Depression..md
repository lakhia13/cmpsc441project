Abstract:  Major  depressive  disorder  is  the  most  common  mental  disorder  with  significant  economic 
burden  and  limited  treatments.  Acupuncture  has  emerged  as  a  promising  non-pharmacological  treat-
ment for reducing depressive symptoms. However, the potential mechanisms and clinical effectiveness 
of acupuncture are not fully understood. This review aimed to: (1) summarize the available evidence 
on the mechanisms and clinical effectiveness of acupuncture for depression, and then (2) compare with 
pharmacological  interventions,  guiding  future  studies.  Studies  with  animal  models  of  depression  and 
patients have shown that acupuncture could increase hippocampal and network neuroplasticity and de-
crease brain inflammation, potentially to alleviating depressive disorders. Overall clinical studies indi-
cated that acupuncture could relieve primary depression, particularly milder cases, and was helpful in 
the management of post-stroke depression, pain-related depression, and postpartum depression both as 
an  isolated  and  adjunct  treatment.  It  was  emphasized  that  acupuncture  combined  with  antidepressant 
pharmacological  treatment  not  only  enhanced  the  improvement  of  primary  and  secondary  depressive 
symptoms but also reduced the side effects of the medical treatment, which is the main cause for high 
dropout rates with drug treatment. In summary, substantial evidence from animal and human research-
es supported the beneficial effect of acupuncture in depression. However, most clinical trials of acu-
puncture were small, and it is unclear whether their findings can be generalized, so more studies are 
needed. 

Keywords:  Depression,  acupuncture,  pharmacological  treatments,  neuroplasticity,  inflammation,  non-pharmacological  treat-
ment. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

  As the most severe psychiatric disorder, depression is the 
primary  cause  of  disability  worldwide.  The  World  Health 
Organization  predicted  that  it  would  become  the  greatest 
cause  of  global  disease  burden  by  2030  [1].  The  clinical 
symptoms include anhedonia, fatigue, negative emotions [2, 
3],  and  the  vulnerability  of  physical  illness,  such  as  stroke, 
pain,  cancer,  and  others  [4,  5],  which  lead  to  the  poor  re-
sponse  to  pharmacological  treatments.  The  standard  drug 
treatments  (mainly  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs)) for depressive disorder are not entirely satisfactory 
due to undesirable side effects and delay the onset of action 
[6, 7]. Regardless of the high incidence of depressive disor-
der  or  the  high  rate  of  suicide  and  treatment-resistant  that 
to  depression,  new 
attention 
would  draw  public

strategies  to  enhance  the  efficacy  of  antidepressants  in  the 
early stage of treatment are greatly in need. 

  Acupuncture  is  a  promising  non-pharmacological  treat-
ment for reducing depressive symptoms, which can be alter-
natives  to  pharmacological  treatment  or  complementary 
treatment  to  improve  the  outcomes  [8].  Compared  with 
pharmacological treatments, acupuncture has the advantages 
of low cost and minimal side effects [9]. In addition, grow-
ing  evidence  have  indicated  that  acupuncture  plus  drug 
treatment is more effective than the drug alone, is safe, well-
tolerated, and has an early onset of action, which embodied 
the potential benefits of combining acupuncture and pharma-
cological  treatments  for  the  depressive  disorder  [7].  Given 
the growing body of literature on the effectiveness and neu-
robiological  pathways  underlying  acupuncture  for  major 
depressive  disorder,  it  is  time  to  synthesize  and  review  the 
available  evidence  on  the  mechanism  and  clinical  effective-
ness of acupuncture for depression in comparison to pharma-
cological  interventions  consolidating  its  effectiveness  and 
guiding future studies.

2. METHOD 

  We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. The 
searches  identified  English  language  papers  published  from 
the database establishment up to the present time. Keywords 
included  “acupuncture”  or  “electroacupuncture”  or  “EA”, 
and  “depression”  or  “mental  disorder”  or  “psychological 
disorder”  or  “emotional”.  After  carefully  evaluated,  the  in-
formation  presented  in  the  following  studies  was  described 
and discussed. 

3. IDENTIFYING ACUPOINTS AND STIMULATION 

  As  an  isolated  and  adjunct  treatment,  acupuncture  has 
been  emerging  as  a  potential  therapeutic  regimen  to  treat 
depression  with  two  main  styles,  acupuncture  (manual)  and 
electroacupuncture.  Manual  acupuncture,  which  is  typically 
used  in  clinical  practice,  is  the  traditional  method  of  pene-
trating  a  thin  and  metallic  needle  into  acupoint  through  the 
skin and then manipulating by hands, such as lifting, thrust-
ing,  twisting,  and  others.  The  acupoint  stimulation  with  the 
electrical  current  instead  of  manual  manipulations  is  called 
electroacupuncture.  Compared  with  manual  acupuncture, 
electroacupuncture  can  generate  more  consistent  and  repro-
ducible  results.  Therefore  electroacupuncture  is  the  most 
commonly  used  method  in  clinical  trials  and  laboratory  re-
search. 

  With  respect  to  the  Yellow  Emperor’s  Internal  Classic, 
meridian and acupoint are the unique systems in the circula-
tion of energy channels [10]. Governor Vessel was the most 
popular meridian in depressive disorder as it is the only me-
ridian  of  the  fourteen  meridians  to  connect  the  head  and 
brain directly [11,12]. In this meridian, Baihui (GV20), Yin-
tang (GV29), and Shenting (GV24) are often used points to 
promote  recovery  of  depressive  disorder.  Besides,  Liver  Qi 
stagnation contributed to the etiology of depression, causing 
symptoms  like  mental  stress,  down  in  spirits  and  activities, 
and  low  self-esteem  [13].  Xingjian  (LR2),  Taichong  (LR3), 
and  Qimen  (LR14)  in  Liver  Meridian  are  the  points  of  the 
standard  acupuncture  protocol  to  regulate  Liver  Qi  move-
ment.  In  summary,  the  application  of  meridians  and  acu-
points  for  depression  lays  emphasis  on  the  head  acupoints 
(such as GV20, GV29, and GV24) and extremities (such as 
LR3  and  LR2).  It  makes  good  use  of  superior-inferior  acu-
points matching.  

4.  PROPOSED  MECHANISMS  OF  ACUPUNCTURE 
FOR DEPRESSION 

  Depression  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  multi-
pathophysiological  mechanisms,  including  neuroplasticity 
and  inflammation  that  generated  various  symptom  patterns 
[14].  Although  different  animal  models  of  depression  have 
been used for many years in experiments, a credible and rea-
sonable  animal  model  can  perfectly  reproduce  the  depres-
sion-like phenotype of human has yet to be found [15]. Dif-
ferent  modeling  methods  produce  different  selectivity  upon 
antidepressants with both advantages and disadvantages [16]. 
For example, the reserpine-induced model has low reliability 
but high efficiency [17]; meanwhile, the learned helplessness 
model,  chronic  mild  stress  model,  and  social  defeat  stress 
model  are  high  specificity  but  easily  affected  by  subjective 

impacts  and  environmental  impacts  with  high  mortality  rate 
[16,  18].  Therefore,  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of  de-
pression may be multifactorial and involved several factors, 
which is difficult to predict the therapeutic effect using only 
a  single  model  [14].  The  current  pharmacological  treatment 
of  depression,  targeting  a  single  point,  is  far  from  perfect. 
The changing of synaptic plasticity [19] and the imbalance of 
the  immune  system  [20,  21]  are  gradually  accepted  as  the 
key players in the pathogenesis of depression. 

  Acupuncture,  as  a  comprehensive  treatment  in  depres-
sion,  has  the  potential  to  alleviate  depressive  symptoms  by 
targeting  neuronal  and  synaptic  remodeling  and  immune 
response.  Therefore,  acupuncture  may  be  a  promising  treat-
ment  for  major  depressive  disorder  arising  from  various 
mechanisms. 

4.1. Targeting Neuroplasticity in Depression 

  Although  the  cause  of  depression  is  not  yet  clear,  the 
brain played an important role in the pathogenesis of depres-
sion.  The  changes  of  neural  circuits  or  chemical  balance  in 
the brain were thought to be the physiological abnormalities 
that  directly  caused  depressive  symptoms  [22].  A  multitude 
of  neuroimaging  studies  found  that  there  were  abnormal 
structure  and  function  in  specific  brain  regions  or  connec-
tions, where they were associated with the process of cogni-
tion  and  emotion,  including  the  hippocampus  [23],  medial 
prefrontal  cortex  (mPFC)  [24],  anterior  cingulate  cortex 
(ACC)  [25],  amygdala  [26],  and  nucleus  accumbens  (NAc) 
[27]. Besides, the changing of these regions could affect the 
symptoms of depressive disorder [14, 28-31]. The reduction 
in hippocampal volume, which was related to the duration of 
depression  (Fig.  1A)  and  was  inversely  proportional  to  the 
length  of  treatment  [32],  was  reversed  by  antidepressant 
treatment [33]. Changed structure and function of these spe-
cific  brain  regions  had  the  potential  to  alter  connectivity 
[34],  such  as  default-mode  network  (DMN)  [35],  ACC-
thalamus  [36],  prefrontal-limbic-thalamic  [37],  and  others, 
which suggested that alterations in the connections of multi-
ple neuronal circuits were risk factors for the development of 
depression pathologies.  

  Growing evidence implicated the importance of underly-
ing  cellular  changes,  which  lead  to  the  reduction  of  volume 
in brain regions. Neuroplasticity is probably especially perti-
nent in regulating the structure and function of neuronal net-
works via various pathways, including promoting neurogen-
esis  and  modulating  the  synapse  connections  [38,  39].  The 
decreased  gene  expression  of  glutamate  was  observed  in 
both the PFC [40] and hippocampus [41] by microarray gene 
profiling, leading to the loss of excitatory synapses. Similar-
ly,  the  size  of  the  neuronal  cell,  but  not  cell  numbers,  was 
also decreased in PFC and hippocampus through postmortem 
studies [42], indicating that the synaptic contacts and proces-
sions  between  neurons  were  decreased  in  major  depressive 
disorder. 

  Compared  with  sham  acupuncture  treatment,  the  acu-
puncture 
increased  resting-state  functional  connectivity 
(rsFC) between the left amygdala and ACC or right amygda-
la  and  left  hippocampus,  which  was  positively  correlated 
with corresponding clinical improvement, indicating that the 

740    Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 4 

Yang et al. 

therapeutic effect of acupuncture was mediated by the limbic 
system, especially the amygdala and the ACC [43]. Similar-
ly, another randomized controlled trial (RCT) also found that 
acupoint  stimulation  could  decrease  the  clinical  depressive 
scores after eight-week treatment, mainly through increasing 
the  rsFC  between  the  inferior  ventral  striatum  and  mPFC, 
ventral  rostral  putamen,  and  amygdala/para-hippocampus 
[7],  indicating  that  acupuncture  altered  corticostriatal  re-
ward/motivation  circuitry  to  play  therapeutic  effects  in  de-
pressive disorder. 

  Acupuncture may act in a variety of ways, such as stimu-
lating  biochemical  pathways  and  restoring  neuronal  struc-
tures in patients with depression. No matter developing neu-
rons and mature neurons, the monoamine neurotransmitter of 
serotonin (5-HT) always has a powerful influence on synap-
tic  plasticity.  When  altered,  it  could  lead  to  neurodevelop-
mental and psychiatric disorders [44]. Therefore, significant 
focus  has  been  placed  on  5-HT  in  the  pathophysiology  and 
treatment  of  depression.  Electroacupuncture  could  regulate 
the  5-HT  receptor  and  restore  hippocampus  CA1  synaptic 
plasticity,  in  turn,  ameliorate  depressive-like  behaviors  [45, 
46].  Similarly,  acupoint  electro-stimulation  had  antidepres-
sant efficacy, mainly or partly via improving the 5-HT recep-
tor  and  upregulating  the  5-HT  content  in  synaptic  gaps  of 
brain regions (Fig. 1B) [47]. 

  Brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF)  not  only  regu-
lates  neural  structural  plasticity  by  promoting  the  growth,  re-
construction,  and  synaptic  formation  of  axons  and  dendrites 
but also affects neural functional plasticity by altering synaptic 
transmission  through  presynaptic  and  postsynaptic  mecha-
nisms [38]. Electroacupuncture at GV20 and GV29 acupoints 
could  ameliorate  the  depression-like  behaviors  and  markedly 
promoted nerve regeneration by increasing BDNF expression 
in the hippocampus [48]. In addition, acupuncture at Shenmen 
(HT7)  also  upregulated  the  expression  of  BDNF  in  the  PFC, 
suggesting  that  acupuncture  has  neuroprotective  effects  in 
depression via up-regulating BDNF (Fig. 1B) [48-51].  

4.2. Targeting Immune System and Inflammation in De-
pression  

In  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  microglia  is  the 
main factor responsible for the physiology and pathology in 
the  innate  immune  [52].  Microglia  shifts  from  immune  sur-
veillance  to  an  activated  state  under  pathogen  infection  or 
synaptic  and  neuron  damage  in  some  diseases  (Fig.  1C). 
When  active,  microglia  not  only  was  the  hyper-ramified 
phenotype [53, 54] but also exhibited an amoeboid morphol-
ogy  to  invade  lesions  in  protecting  the  host  against  harmful 
microorganisms  [55].  Not  surprisingly,  long-term  activation 
of microglia also led to immune pathology, mainly with the 
overwhelming  production  of  various  neurotoxins,  including 
inflammatory  cytokines,  nitric  oxide,  and  others  [56],  ulti-
mately  aggravating  neuronal  damage  [57].  The  receptor  of 
translocator  protein  which  were  labeled  with  radioligands, 
was  highly  expressed  in  activated  microglia  [58].  In  a  posi-
tron  emission  tomography  (PET)  study,  this  radioligand  in 
PFC,  ACC,  and  insula  was  significantly  increasing  [59], 
suggesting  that  the  proportion  of  activated  microglia  was 
elevated  in  these  brain  regions.  As  such,  it’s  gradually  rec-

ognized  that  activated  microglia  are  the  core  of  the  patho-
physiology of depression. 

  Behavioral  symptoms  caused  by  infection  or  inflamma-
tion are mainly evoked by inflammatory cytokines in periph-
eral  tissues,  which  directly  acted  on  the  CNS  via  leaky  re-
gions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [60, 61] (Fig. 1D). In 
recent decades, a significant focus has always been placed on 
the  monoamine  depletion  hypothesis,  which  indicated  that 
the  imbalance  of  serotonergic  and  noradrenergic  neuro-
transmission  plays  a  key  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  mood 
disorders  [62].  The  interaction  between  inflammation  and 
brain-immune  could  induce  the  imbalance  of  serotonergic 
and noradrenergic neurotransmission, which was involved in 
the occurrence and development of depressive disorder [63]. 
Activated  microglia  produced  a  variety  of  proinflammatory 
cytokines in response to inflammation and stress, resulting in 
the neurodegeneration and depressive behaviors through two 
different  pathways:  (1)  evoking  the  imbalance  of  sero-
tonergic  and  noradrenergic  neurotransmission  through  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  (HPA);  (2)  decreasing 
the  level  of  5-HT  via  increasing  the  activity  of  the  enzyme 
indoleamine-2,3-deoxygenase (IDO) (Fig. 1C). Additionally, 
the  persistent  inflammatory  response  was  also  associated 
with  the  unresponsiveness  of  antidepressant  treatment  [64]. 
The imbalance of immune response in the peripheral or cen-
tral system was considered as another cause in the develop-
ment  of  depression.  Therefore,  targeting  inflammation  may 
be a promising therapeutic avenue. 

  Acupuncture  significantly  improved  sucrose  preference 
and  locomotor  activities  of  depressive  rats  and  decreased 
pro-inflammatory  cytokine  serum  levels  [65].  The  stimula-
tion  of  the  vagal  nerve  (VNS)  is  a  long-term  adjunctive 
treatment  for  severe  depressive  disorder,  which  was  ap-
proved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  in  2005 
[66].  Acupuncture,  as  a  non-invasive  method  of  VNS,  may 
be  a  potential  therapeutic  regimen  to  treat  the  inflammatory 
response  in  depression  [67,  68].  The  α7nAChR,  which  is 
activated  by  acetylcholine  released  from  the  cholinergic 
nerve  endings,  is  the  crucial  target  for  attenuation  of  pro-
inflammatory  cytokines  released  from  macrophages  [69]. 
Acupuncture could activate the α7nAChR to reduce the pro-
duction of inflammatory cytokines via the vagal nerve [70]. 
It  was  naturally  postulated  that  acupuncture  is  a  promising 
non-pharmacology  treatment  for  depression  through  the  ex-
citing vagal nerve to suppress the inflammatory responses in 
the peripheral and central systems.  

  Growing  evidence  implicated  the  importance  of  gut  mi-
crobiota permeability in accelerating the production of proin-
flammatory cytokines in depressive patients (Fig. 1E). Com-
pared  with  healthy  controls,  gut  macrobiotic  compositions 
were  significantly  different  in  major  depressive  disorder 
[71].  Meanwhile,  depressive  patients  had  a  marked  increase 
of IgM and IgA in serum compared with healthy individuals, 
which  suggested  invasive  enterobacteria  had  more  opportu-
nities  to  induce  the  inflammatory  response  in  the  peripheral 
and  central  systems  via  increasing  gastrointestinal  permea-
bility [72]. Similarly, rats that received fecal microbiota from 
patients  with  depression  exhibited  depression-like  behavior 
and  decreased  hippocampal  neurotransmitters,  increased 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  serum  and  damaged  of  the

campal volume was related to the duration of depression (A). The synaptic contacts and processions between neurons were decreased in ma-
jor depressive disorder, which can be reversed by upregulating the expression of 5-HT and BDNF (B). Activated microglia produce inflam-
matory cytokines and nitric oxide that can contribute to depression through hyper-activation of the HPA axis and IDO (C). Gut microbiotic 
permeability accelerated the production of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral tissues (D), which act directly on the CNS via leaky regions

intestinal epithelial cells [73]. Meanwhile, acupuncture could 
adjust the count and proportion of the intestinal microbiota to 
recover its stability and ameliorate the intestinal barrier func-
tion by promoting the interaction between intestinal microbi-
ota and brain-gut axis and then suppressing the production of 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines  [74,  75].  The  vagal  nerve  con-
nects the brain and gastrointestinal tract, indicating that it not 
only  modulates  the  depression-associated  brain  regions  or 
circuits  (e.g.,  amygdala,  PFC)  but  also  suppresses  the  sys-
temic  and  central  inflammation via  different  neuropathways 
(e.g.,  splenic  nerve)  [76].  Therefore,  we  proposed  an  as-
sumption  that  acupuncture  may  act  on  the  following  two 
pathways  to  suppress  the  inflammation  and  ameliorate  de-

pression:  (1)  inhibition  of  the  release  of  inflammatory  cyto-
kines  by  activating  the  vagal  nerve;  (2)  regulation  of  the 
brain-gut axis through intestinal microbiota. 

  Besides, endorphin has been found to suppress the func-
tion of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in order 
to control inflammatory and neuropathic pain [77]. Acupunc-
ture  has  been  demonstrated  to  relieve  pain  and  enhance  the 
healing  process  by  releasing  corticosteroids  and  enhancing 
endogenous  opioids  in  central  and  peripheral  nervous  sys-
tems,  such  as  dynorphin,  endorphin,  encephalin  [78].  There 
is  a  plausible  assumption  that  acupuncture  could  increase 
endorphin  expression,  which  suppressed  the  inflammation

via  µ-opioid  receptors,  in  turn,  ameliorated  depression  [79], 
especially  in  post-stroke  depression  (PSD)  and  pain-related 
depression (PRD), which were associated with inflammation. 
Endorphins  have  been  linked  to  cases  of  mental  illness,  in-
cluding  autism,  depression,  and  depersonalization  disorder, 
as well as to activities such as laughter and vigorous aerobic 
exercise [80], indicating that the release of endorphins could 
directly  ameliorate  depressive  disorder,  rather  than  through 
inflammation.  Levels  of  microglial  activation  in  primary 
depression have been shown to be low both at post-mortem 
and  on  PET  imaging  [81],  which  demonstrated  that  inflam-
mation  was  more  likely  to  be  reactive  than  causative.  The 
increasing  of  endorphins  release  in  individuals  may  be  an-
other acceptable explanation for the beneficial effects of ac-
upuncture in primary depression.  

4.3. Summary 

In  this  review,  we  found  out  that  the  primary  cause  of 
depression is brain inflammation and BBB disruption, which 
caused a neuronal loss in brain regions (especially in hippo-
campus), reduced monoaminergic levels, and impaired brain 
network connectivity. Studies with animal models of depres-
sion  and  patients  have  shown  that  acupuncture  can  increase 
brain regions and network neuroplasticity and decrease brain 
inflammation, in turn, have the potential to alleviate the de-
pressive disorder.  

5.  CLINICAL  EVIDENCE  FOR  ACUPUNCTURE  ON 
DEPRESSION 

From  a  clinical  perspective,  the  depressive  disorder  can 
be  divided  into  different  subtypes,  such  as  primary  depres-
sion  and  secondary  depression.  An  8-week  controlled  clini-
cal study with 60 patients to compare the effects of electro-
acupuncture  and  SSRIs  in  depressive  patients  found  that 
electroacupuncture  showed  greater  improvement  in  global 
clinical  impression,  anxiety/somatization,  and  feelings  of 
despair  than  SSRIs  [82].  Besides,  an  RCT  compared  SSRIs 
alone  versus  SSRIs  together  with  manual  acupuncture  or 
electroacupuncture  in  477  moderate  to  severely  depressed 
patients  [83],  identifying  that  compared  with  SSRIs  alone, 
both  manual  acupuncture  and  electroacupuncture  were  sig-
nificantly  better  on  17-item  Hamilton  Depression  Rating 
Scale  (HDRS)  response  rate,  HDRS-17  early-onset  rate, 
Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Clinical Global Impres-
sion  (CGI)  and  Rating  Scale  foe  Side  Effects  (SERS),  indi-
cating  that  acupuncture  have  therapeutic  effects  in  addition 
to  SSRIs  alone  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  depres-
sion,  and  was  well  tolerated.  Similarly,  several  high-quality 
RCTs  also  found  that  acupuncture  may  be  not  only  a  safe 
adjunctive  treatment  with  antidepressants  but  also  more  ef-
fective  in  improving  depressive  symptoms  [84,  85].  Alt-
hough  growing  evidence  indicated  that  acupoint  stimulation 
was  a  very  promising  treatment  for  primary  depressive  dis-
order,  there  was  still  insufficient  evidence  to  determine  the 
efficacy of acupuncture due to lacking well-designed studies. 

  A  significant  focus  of  acupuncture  has  been  placed  on 
secondary  depression,  which  has  a  similar  pathophysiologi-
cal mechanism to primary depression. Indeed, the depressive 
disorder  has  been  associated  with  a  significant  reduction  in 

life  expectancy,  partly  due  to  suicide,  and  the  rest  resulting 
from a significant increase in the likelihood of major illness, 
including  cardiovascular  disease,  stroke,  cancer,  and  other 
conditions. Meanwhile, physical diseases also contributed to 
the development of depression. Therefore, multi-target ther-
apy may be a promising avenue for the treatment of second-
ary depression. Among secondary depressive disorders, PSD, 
PRD,  and  postpartum  depression  (PPD)  are  the  most  com-
mon  diseases  in  acupuncture.  Based  on  current  procurable 
evidence, the significant effects of acupuncture in ameliorat-
ing  depression  were  manifested  in  patients  compared  with 
both usual care and waiting-list. 

5.1. Post-stroke Depression 

PSD  is  the  most  common  neuropsychiatric  consequence 
of  stroke,  afflicting  around  33%  of  stroke  survivors  [86]. 
Depressive  disorder  is  a  high-risk  factor  for  stroke,  which 
seriously affects patients’ attitude towards disease treatment, 
reduces the quality of life, increases the chance of recurrence 
of  neurovascular  events,  poor  functional  recovery,  and  high 
morbidity  and  mortality  [87].  A  meta-analysis  in  2019, 
which involved 15 prospective cohort studies with a total of 
250,294  participants  followed  from  1  to  15  years,  showed 
that  PSD  is  a  highly  prevalent  risk  factor  for  a  marked  in-
crease  in  mortality  among  stroke  patients  [88].  Meanwhile, 
somatic  disability  may  further  promote  the  development  of 
depressive behaviors. While actively and effectively control-
ling  the  primary  disease,  efforts  should  also  be  put  into  im-
proving  patients’  psychological  and  social  function.  There-
fore, the use of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the early 
stage  of  stroke  could  not  only  reduce  the  prevalence  of  de-
pression  [89-91]  but  also  give  patients  a  positive  attitude 
toward  treatment  and  then  promote  long-term  functional 
recovery after stroke [92, 93]. Clinical evidence showed that 
acupuncture could improve PSD-related symptoms. 

  A  system  review  involving  31  trials  with  2,257  partici-
pants  in  the  subacute  or  chronic  stages  of  stroke  found  that 
acupuncture  had  therapeutic  effects  on  the  improvement  of 
depression  and  dependency,  global  neurological  deficiency, 
and some specific neurological impairments [94]. For PSD, a 
meta-analysis  including  7  trials  with  514  participants  found 
that  acupuncture  had  a  significantly  higher  treatment  effect 
than controls in symptoms of PSD, with low study heteroge-
neity.  Besides,  subgroup  analysis  further  showed  that  acu-
puncture alone was superior to medication in improving de-
pression-associated  symptoms,  but  was  no  statistically  sig-
nificant  difference  between  acupuncture  combined  with 
medicine  groups  [95].  Likely,  an  overview  of  systematic 
reviews with meta-analyses on acupuncture in PSD research, 
including  four  systematic  reviews  and  ten  systemic  reviews 
with  good  methodological  quality,  revealed  that  compared 
with an antidepressant, acupuncture significantly reduced the 
score  of  HDRS  after  two  weeks  of  treatment  and  acupunc-
ture usage was not associated with increased risk of adverse 
events  [96].  This  review  suggested  that  acupuncture  is  safe 
and  improves  cognitive  function  and  depressive  disorder 
without  obvious  serious  adverse  events  for  PSD.  Therefore, 
the  promising  efficacy  and  safety  of  acupuncture  on  PSD 
patients  have  been  confirmed  by  several  systemic  reviews 
and meta-analyses. 

 
 
 
Potential Mechanisms and Clinical Effectiveness of Acupuncture in Depression 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 4    743 

  A  population-based  cohort  study  recruited  8,487  stroke 
patients,  of  whom  1,036  patients  received  more  than  five 
post-stroke acupuncture stimulations, 1,053 patients received 
1-5 times, and 6,398 did not receive acupuncture. This study 
showed  that  acupuncture  might  lower  the  risk  of  PSD  by 
52.5%  and  28.2%  in  frequent  and  infrequent  acupuncture 
users,  respectively  [97].  These  results  provided  powerful 
evidence  to  support  the  viewpoint  that  post-stroke  acupunc-
ture  significantly  decreased  the  risk  of  depressive  disorder. 
In a study, 58 participants with ischemic PSD received acu-
puncture  and  placebo  starch  tablets  treatment  or  fluoxetine 
tablets  add  body  acupuncture  treatment  during  a  12-week 
intervention period, found that both acupuncture and fluoxe-
tine  could  reduce  the  depressive  scores,  but  the  former  had 
no obvious adverse reaction and side effects [98], indicating 
that the effects of acupuncture were comparable to first-line 
treatments in PSD patients 

5.2. Summary 

Psychological stress associated with a physical disability 
may  lead  to  the  occurrence  of  PSD,  and  depression  could 
worsen  stroke  behaviors.  Therefore,  PSD  is  of  high  clinical 
importance.  Despite  the  familiar  occurrence  of  PSD  with 
impressive  medical  expenses  and  poor  quality  of  life,  the 
current  treatment  options  are  limited.  A  meta-analysis  in 
2019,  which  identified  a  total  of  63  eligible  trials  recruiting 
9,168 participants, found that no reliable evidence supported 
the view that routinely using SSRIs could markedly improve 
the  physical  recovery  after  stroke  [99].  In  contrast,  most 
studies supported that the effects of acupuncture were com-
parable  or  even  exceeded  the  pharmacological  treatment  in 
PSD,  indicating  that  acupuncture  may  be  more  suitable  for 
treating  PSD  without  serious  complications.  The  robust  ef-
fects  of  acupuncture  on  PSD,  at  least  in  part,  could  be  ex-
plained by multiple therapeutic targets for stroke patients. In 
addition to the antidepressant mechanisms mentioned above, 
acupuncture  treatment  also  improved  stroke  rehabilitation 
and global or specific neurological deficits, whose improve-
ments have been found to be greatly helpful in reducing de-
pressive  symptoms  in  stroke  patients  [94,  100].  Therefore, 
acupuncture  was  comparable  or  superior  to  antidepressants 
in  improving  both  response  and  symptom  severity  of  PSD 
with low adverse, which can be considered as an alternative 
option in PSD patients. 

5.3. Pain-related Depression 

  Depression  and  pain  are  the  most  common  debilitating 
diseases  that  have  a  powerful  impact  on  society  as  a  whole 
[101]. Nearly 80% of patients with chronic pain have depres-
sion  at  the  same  time  [102],  which  markedly  reduced  the 
quality  of  life  and  led  to  the  occurrence  of  high  mortality 
[103].  RCTs  reported  that  compared  with  patients  without 
pain, these patients with pain were more likely to report de-
pression [104, 105].  

  However,  the  majority  of  patients  with  depression  and 
pain  comorbidities  did  not  respond  to  pharmacological 
treatments  for  pain  or  depression,  all  of  which  significantly 
made this co-morbidity disorder to reduce the quality of life 
and  then  impose  a  heavy  burden  on  society  [106].  Multi-
target of depression and pain may be an attractive target for 

therapeutics.  Acupuncture,  as  a  unique  treatment  of  tradi-
tional  Chinese  medicine,  played  a  therapeutic  role  through 
multiple  targets,  such  as  both  treating  pain  and  improving 
depression.  Therefore,  acupuncture  has  been  reported  as  a 
potential  alternative  treatment  for  patients  with  depression 
and pain comorbidities.  

  A systematic review that recruited 7 available RCTs with 
535  patients  in  2020  found  that  compared  with  medicine 
therapy,  acupuncture  significantly  decreased  the  scores  of 
pain and depressive symptoms assessing by Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) and HDRS, separately, and lower side effects in 
PRD patients. This review supported the view that acupunc-
ture can be used in patients with poorer responses to conven-
tional medical therapy or suffering from serious side effects 
[107]. Similarly, another systemic review and meta-analysis 
with 8 studies (636 participants) in 2021 showed that single 
acupuncture  treatment  and  drug  treatment  had  the  same  ef-
fects in improving the HDRS score and alleviating the VAS 
score,  but  acupuncture  was  safer.  In  addition,  acupuncture 
combined  with  drugs  was  more  beneficial  in  HDRS  score 
and  VAS  score  [108].  These  systematic  reviews  supported 
the view that acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment 
for  PRD,  and  acupuncture  combined  with  drug  therapy  is 
more effective than single-drug therapy. 

  A  clinical  study  recruited  270  patients  with  episodic  or 
chronic tension-type headaches who were randomly divided 
into  the  waiting-list  group,  acupuncture  group,  and  minimal 
acupuncture  group  (superficial  needling  at  non-acupuncture 
points) with 12 sessions over eight weeks. This clinical study 
found that compared with the waiting-list group, acupuncture 
fared significantly better for the pain and depression assess-
ment by the Allgemeine Depressionsskala scale (ADS) after 
8-week treatment. However, the efficacy of acupuncture and 
the  minimal  acupuncture  group  was  no  significant  different 
[109].  However,  He  et  al.  found  that  compared  with  sham 
acupuncture, acupuncture also reduced pain intensity of pain 
and  depressive  behaviors  in  24  patients  with  chronic  neck 
and shoulder pain [110]. In this study, patients were random-
ly  assigned  to  an  acupuncture  group  or  sham  acupuncture 
group (sham points) for 10 times during three to four weeks. 
After treatment, acupuncture improved the pain and depres-
sion  compared  with  sham  acupuncture,  which  was  again 
significantly different at 6 months and 3 years follow-ups. A 
secondary  analysis  of  an  RCT  with  755  patients  also  found 
that  acupuncture  was  most  marked  in  the  reduction  of  de-
pression  and  pain  compared  with  counseling  or  usual  care 
[111]. 

5.4. Summary  

  Depression  is  explained  as  an  emotional  state,  which  is 
different  from  physical  pain.  However,  a  multitude  of  clini-
cal studies has shown that depressive disorder and pain have 
a high degree of comorbidity, which will increase the health 
burden  and  affect  the  quality  of  life.  Acupuncture  has  been 
increasingly  accepted  as  an  integrative  or  complementary 
treatment  for  pain  with  little  risk  of  serious  adverse  [112]. 
Concomitant  with  the  rising  use  of  acupuncture  in  pain,  the 
comorbidities  of  depression  and  pain  are  drawing  public  at-
tention.  In  most  cases,  acupuncture  was  effective  for  both 
depression  and  pain.  Despite  the  interest,  most  studies  fo-

cused on pain, and very little work has addressed depression 
and  its  causal  relationship  to  pain  in  the  treatment  of  acu-
puncture. Current studies indicated that compared with med-
ical  treatment,  acupuncture  has  therapeutic  effects  in  reduc-
ing  pain  and  relieving  symptoms  of  depression  in  patients 
with PRD.  

acupuncture or non-invasive sham acupuncture two sessions 
weekly  for  four  weeks  found  that  electroacupuncture  and 
sham  acupuncture  both  reduced  the  score  of  HDRS,  Edin-
burgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and De-
pression  Scale  and  Clinical  Global  Impression  and  was  no 
significant difference between two groups [122]. 

5.5. Postpartum Depression 

5.6. Summary 

PPD, one of the most common mental disorders associat-
ed  with  childbirth,  usually  occurs  between  the  first  day  and 
four months after giving birth [113]. It clinically presented as 
low  energy,  extreme  sadness,  irritability,  and  suicidal 
tendencies  [114].  When  pregnant  women  suffered  from  de-
pressive  disorder,  there  were  tangible  but  subtle  negative 
effects  on  newborns,  including  increasing  the  incidence  of 
violence  during  adolescence  or  adulthood  [115].  Pharmaco-
logical treatments are the standard therapy for major depres-
sive  disorder.  However,  the  majority  of  postpartum  women 
are  unwilling  to  take  medicine,  mainly  or  partly  due  to  its 
serious  adverse  effects  and  addictiveness  [116].  The  tolera-
bility and safety of treatment play a key role in compliance. 
In  the  majority  of  studies,  acupoint  stimulation  was  easily 
tolerated,  and  the  undesirable  side  effects  were  rare.  Acu-
puncture  was  acceptable  to  pregnant  women  who  were  not 
utilizing  conventional  approaches,  as  well  as  an  adjunct  for 
those  using  standard  depression  therapeutics.  Therefore,  it 
may be more suitable to receive the treatment of acupuncture 
for depression in postpartum women. 

  A  meta-analysis  involving  12  RCTs  recruited  877  PPD 
patients,  of  whom  443  patients  received  acupuncture  treat-
ment, and 444 patients were in the control group. This study 
found that compared with the control group, the patients who 
received  acupoint  stimulation  had  more  significantly  im-
proved  depressive  symptoms,  assessed  by  the  HDRS  [117]. 
A systematic review and meta-analysis involving 8 prospec-
tive  trials  with  517  participants  also  found  that  acupuncture 
decreased the score of depression but no beneficial effects in 
clinical  response  and  estradiol  [114].  By  contrast,  another 
systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  including  9  trials  with 
653  women  demonstrated  that  compared  with  the  control 
group,  acupuncture  could  obviously  improve  the  overall  ef-
fective  rate  and  increase  oestradiol  levels,  but  there  was  no 
difference in depression [118].  

  An  RCT  involved  57  PPD  patients  found  that  compared 
with muscle relaxation or usual care, there was a significant-
ly  lower  depression  score  after  acupuncture  treatment  with-
out  adverse  event  [119].  Similarly,  another  trial  with  150 
PPD  who  were  randomized  to  receive  either  acupuncture 
specific for depression or one of two active controls: control 
acupuncture  or  massage,  also  found  that  compared  with  the 
control  group,  acupuncture  got  a  greater  rate  of  decrease  in 
symptom severity and response [120]. Some small but relia-
ble  studies  also  demonstrated  the  therapeutic  effect  of  acu-
puncture in PRD patients. A study of prospective case series 
enrolled 15 PPD patients to receive acupuncture therapy with 
20  min  for  one  session  and  eight  times  for  4  weeks.  Com-
pared with six patients who did not finish this treatment, nine 
patients  who  completed  treatment  had  more  obvious  im-
provement of pain and depression [121]. However, a double-
blind  RCT  involving  20  PPD  women  who  received  electro-

  Compared  with  pharmacological  treatment,  acupuncture 
may be reasonable to consider for women during pregnancy 
or postpartum due to fewer adverse effects. Pregnant women 
suffering  from  depression  are  willing  to  try  acupuncture, 
despite  having  little  prior  knowledge  of  it,  indicating  that 
there  is  an  increasing  demand  for  acupuncture  in  the  PPD 
field.  In  recent  years,  four  systemic  reviews  evaluated  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  acupuncture  for  PPD  [114,  117,  118, 
123],  and  they  all  indicated  that  acupuncture  was  effective 
for PPD patients. While there is a risk of bias associated with 
acupuncture, general consensus suggests that the benefits of 
acupuncture outweigh the drawbacks. 

6. ACUPUNCTURE VS. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREAT- 
MENTS 

6.1.  Acupuncture  may  be  more  Effective  or  Suitable  in 
Some Depression 

  Antidepressant  pharmacological  treatment  is  the  current 
standard  of  treatment  for  depression  [124].  A  host  of  high-
quality  RCTs  supported  the  view  that  pharmacological 
treatment was superior to non-pharmacological treatments in 
major depressive disorder [125, 126]. However, the severity 
of  baseline  symptoms  determines  whether  the  medication 
was  effective  or  not.  Several  meta-analyses  of  RCTs  have 
compared pharmacotherapy with placebo to explore whether 
baseline  symptom  severity  affected  the  efficacy  of  antide-
pressant pharmacological treatment. These studies found that 
the  higher  the  severity  of  baseline  symptoms,  the  better  the 
efficacy  of  pharmacological  treatment  [127,  128].  Kirsch  et 
al.  extrapolated  from  their  findings  that  the  minimum  base-
line  of  HDRS  score  had  to  be  greater  than  23  for  a  clinical 
difference  between  pharmacological  treatment  and  placebo. 
For  baseline  with  a  lower  HDRS  score,  the  clinical  differ-
ence  was  able  to  negligible.  Importantly,  according  to  the 
American  Psychiatric  Association  Taskforce  for  the  Hand-
book of Psychiatric Measures, a score of more than 23 indi-
cated a very serious depressive disorder [129]. In fact, a re-
cent survey of depressed treatment-seeking outpatients found 
that  71%  of  the  503  patients  assessed  had  HDRS score  less 
than  22  [130],  indicating  that  the  magnitude  of  benefit  of 
pharmacological treatment may be minimal or nonexistent in 
patients  with  mild  or  moderate  depressive  symptoms  [129, 
131]. 

  Acupuncture,  as  a  promising  non-pharmacological  treat-
ment,  has  the  protentional  to  treat  mild  or  moderate  major 
depressive  disorder  by  regulating  neuroplasticity  and  in-
flammation, and the therapeutic effects were comparative or 
might  even  exceed  antidepressant  pharmacological  treat-
ment. A multicenter, randomized, positive-controlled clinical 
trial  enrolled  242  perimenopause  women  with  the  mild-
moderate depressive symptom, who were randomly assigned 

 
Potential Mechanisms and Clinical Effectiveness of Acupuncture in Depression 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2022, Vol. 20, No. 4    745 

to received 36 sessions of electroacupuncture or escitalopram 
treatment. This study found that there was no difference be-
tween  the  two  groups  in  depressive  scores,  menopause-
specific  quality  of  life,  and  serum  sexual  hormones  [132], 
indicating  that  electroacupuncture  was  effective  and  safe  in 
relieving depression symptoms and improving the quality of 
life.  Similarly,  a  small  RCT  with  30  patients  with  mild  to 
moderate depression who were randomized to receive active 
or  inactive  (sham)  laser  acupuncture  found  that  compared 
with  sham  acupuncture,  the  decreasing  of  the  depressive 
score  was  higher  in  laser  acupuncture,  indicating  that  acu-
puncture  may  be  worth  further  investigation  as  a  treatment 
for  mild  to  moderate  depression  in  primary  care  [133]. 
Therefore,  acupuncture  may  be  potentially  effective  mono-
therapy for mild to moderate depression. 

  There  are  improvements  of  depressive  symptoms  by 
medication in some special patients, including PPD and geri-
atric  depression,  and  these  improvements  have  also  been 
seen  in  non-pharmacological  treatment,  including  acupunc-
ture  [115].  Those  patients  may  prefer  non-pharmacological 
options  because  antidepressant  pharmacological  treatment 
also comes with considerable risks for harm, such as higher 
systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure,  addictiveness.  A  pro-
spective study with 15 patients diagnosed with mild PPD to 
explore  the  effects  of  acupuncture  found  that  acupuncture 
alone  could  decrease  the  depressive  scores  and  alleviate 
symptoms  of  mild  PPD,  with  no  side  effects  [121].  In  con-
clusion, these findings indicated that compared with pharma-
cological treatments, acupoint stimulation is at least as effec-
tive as or possibly more suitable, with a very rare occurrence 
of  side  effects  for  mild  to  moderate  depressive  disorder  or 
special depressive patients.  

6.2.  Acupuncture  may  be  an  Adjunct  Treatment  in  Se-
vere Depression 

Severe depression, the most disabling form of depression, 
was commonly treated by second-generation antidepressants, 
such  as  SSRIs,  which  were  recommended  as  the  first-step 
therapy by most evidence-based guidelines [113]. In antide-
pressant  pharmacological  treatment,  approximately  60%  of 
patients respond well to medication. However, about 30% do 
not respond well. Besides, up to 63% of patients on second-
generation antidepressants experienced adverse events [114]. 
The  tolerability  and  safety  of  treatment  play  a  key  role  in 
compliance;  therefore,  a  large  proportion  of  severe  depres-
sive patients were forced to abandon antidepressant pharma-
cological  treatment  in  midway  due  to  the  undesirable  side 
effects and end up with relapse and dysfunction [115].  

In  addition,  accumulating  evidence  have  demonstrated 
that  acupuncture  combined  with  antidepressant  medication 
was more effective than antidepressants alone, and was safe, 
well-tolerated,  and  had  an  early  onset  of  action  [7].  A  sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis involving 1,046 subjects in 
13 RCTs shown that acupuncture in combination with SSRIs 
had  a  stronger  antidepressant  effect  and  an  early  onset  of 
action  and  was  safer  and  well-tolerated  than  SSRIs  alone 
during the first six weeks of treatment [9]. Immune deregula-
tion was associated with the unresponsiveness of antidepres-
sant pharmacological treatment. Meanwhile, a growing body 
of  evidence  from  RCTs  found  that  compared  with  placebo, 

using  anti-inflammatory  medicine  alone  also  significantly 
improved  the  depression  [114],  and  acupuncture,  as  a  non-
invasive method of VNS, maybe a potential therapeutic reg-
imen  to  treat  the  inflammatory  response  in  depression  [63, 
64].  Meanwhile,  acupuncture  combined  with  SSRIs  could 
significantly  reduce  HDRS-17  score  in  the  first  week  com-
pared with SSRIs alone, suggesting that the addition of acu-
puncture may shorten the onset time of SSRIs [12]. In addi-
tion to needing a long time to onset of action, typical mono-
amine  reuptake  inhibitor  antidepressants  required  a  longer 
time to effectively reverse the abnormal structure of depres-
sive  disorder  [19].  Electroacupuncture  showed  therapeutic 
effects  on  neurogenesis  by  upregulating  the  proliferation  of 
hippocampus progenitor cells [116]. These findings indicated 
that  combination  or  augmentation  strategies  of  antidepres-
sants with acupuncture are more effective and have an early 
onset of action in severe depression 

  Acupuncture combined with antidepressant pharmacolog-
ical  treatment  may  have  the  potential  to  reduce  the  side  ef-
fects  of  medical  treatment,  but  it  remains  controversial  due 
to  limited  research.  Although  acupuncture  has  been  used  to 
manage various physical symptoms that may present as side 
effects from antidepressants, including nausea [117], insom-
nia [9], weight gain, and sexual dysfunction [118], few stud-
ies  have  directly  demonstrated  that  acupuncture  could  im-
prove the side effects of antidepressants. Here, we found only 
a  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  sham-controlled 
trial to identify. In this study, 80 depressive patients were di-
vided  into  acupuncture  group  (acupuncture,  10  mg/day 
fluoxetine  plus  10-20  mg/day  placebo)  and  sham  acupunc-
ture group (sham acupuncture and 20-30 mg/day fluoxetine).  
This  research  found  no  significant  difference  between  the 
two  groups  in  therapeutic  response  rates  and  depressive 
score, whereas the patients in the acupuncture group showed 
better  improvement  than  the  sham  acupuncture  group  in 
side-effects  of  antidepressants  [85].  Therefore,  further  stud-
ies using large- and high-quality samples are needed to con-
firm it. 

CONCLUSION 

  Mechanistically,  acupuncture  has  the  potential  to  allevi-
ate depressive disorders by increasing hippocampal and net-
work  neuroplasticity  and  decreasing  brain  inflammation.  In 
addition,  overall  clinical  studies  indicated  that  acupuncture 
could  relieve  primary  depression,  particularly  milder  cases, 
and was helpful in the management of PSD(cid:1)PRD and PPD 
both as an isolated and adjunct treatment. In summary, sub-
stantial  evidence  from  animal  and  human  researches  sup-
ported  the  beneficial  effect  of  acupuncture  in  depression. 
However, the effect of acupuncture remains to be assessed in 
large and well-designed clinical trials.
