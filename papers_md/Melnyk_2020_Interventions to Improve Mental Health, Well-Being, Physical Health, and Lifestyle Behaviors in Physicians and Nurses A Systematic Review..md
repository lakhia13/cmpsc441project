Abstract

Objective:  This systematic review focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 
physicians and nurses that tested interventions designed to improve their mental health, well-
being, physical health, and lifestyle behaviors.

Data Source:  A systematic search of electronic databases from 2008 to May 2018 included 
PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library.

Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:  Inclusion criteria included an RCT design, samples 
of physicians and/or nurses, and publication year 2008 or later with outcomes targeting mental 
health, well-being/resiliency, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and/or physical health. Exclusion criteria 
included studies with a focus on burnout without measures of mood, resiliency, mindfulness, or 
stress; primary focus on an area other than health promotion; and non-English papers.

Data Extraction:  Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from each study by 2 
independent researchers using a standardized template created in Covidence.

Data Synthesis:  Although meta-analytic pooling across all studies was desired, a wide array of 
outcome measures made quantitative pooling unsuitable. Therefore, effect sizes were calculated 
and a mini meta-analysis was completed.

Results:  Twenty-nine studies (N = 2708 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated 
that mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy-based interventions are effective in reducing 
stress, anxiety, and depression. Brief interventions that incorporate deep breathing and gratitude 
may be beneficial. Visual triggers, pedometers, and health coaching with texting increased 
physical activity.

Conclusion:  Healthcare systems must promote the health and well-being of physicians and 
nurses with evidence-based interventions to improve population health and enhance the quality 
and safety of the care that is delivered.

Objectives

In 2017, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) launched the Action Collaborative 
on Clinician Well-being and Resilience because of epidemic levels of burnout, depression, 
and suicide in physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers.1 Burnout is a syndrome 
characterized by a high degree of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization along with 
a low sense of personal accomplishment at work, which has a high association with 
depression.2 The Action Collaborative’s primary goal is to decrease rates of clinician 
burnout in the United States in order to ultimately improve population health of clinicians 
and ensure health-care quality and safety.2

Findings from a recent systematic review indicate that over 50% of physicians and nurses 
are experiencing burnout. Another recent study with nearly 1800 nurses from 19 healthcare 
systems across the country found that over 50% of respondents reported suboptimal physical 
and mental health.3 Depression affected 25% of this sample and was the leading cause of 
medical errors, which are now the third leading cause of death in America.4 Nurses with 
poor mental and physical health were 26% to 71% more likely to report making medical 
errors compared to those in better health.

Although physicians and nurses do their best to provide outstanding care to their patients, 
they often do not prioritize their own self-care. As a result, participation in healthy lifestyle 
behaviors are often given a low priority.4 Besides personal factors, there are multiple 
healthcare system challenges that contribute to clinician burnout and depression, including 
poor staffing patterns, ongoing challenges with electronic medical records that result in 
less time with patients, and pressure to increase caseloads.5 Leaders must address these 
healthcare system challenges in order to optimize clinician well-being outcomes to ensure 
patient safety.

The fourth aim in healthcare quadruple is to improve the work-life and well-being of 
clinicians.6 If clinicians are not well, healthcare quality and safety may suffer. It is 
imperative for healthcare systems to invest in an infrastructure that includes providing 
evidence-based interventions that are known to cultivate a culture that supports clinician 
health and well-being in order to reach the quadruple aim in health care. A model 
identifying factors affecting clinician well-being and resilience has been created by NAM.7 
In this model, external and individual factors have been identified. External factors include 
sociocultural factors, regulatory, business, and payer environment, organizational factors, 
and learning/practice environment. Individual factors include healthcare role, personal 
factors, skills, and abilities. A wide array of interventions have been designed to promote 
well-being in clinicians primarily within the personal factors identified on the model. 
Individual level interventions include a focus on physical health, mental health, mindfulness, 
stress reduction, resilience, and others. A website that contains a knowledge hub has been 
created by the NAM to support clinician well-being and resilience that includes many 
resources.8

There have been a number of systematic reviews completed that have focused on a singular 
aspect of wellness for physicians and/or nurses. However, this review is different than others 
in that a wide array of experimental studies were included that implemented a variety of 
interventions that sought to improve mental health, well-being, lifestyle behaviors, and/or 
physical health in order to identify evidence-based interventions to improve population 
health in physicians and nurses. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic 
review of interventions targeted to improve all of these outcomes.

Methods

Data Source

The Institute of Medicine guidelines for completing systematic reviews were used and 
reporting of findings followed PRISMA guidelines.9,10 Prior to beginning the review, a 
protocol was developed and registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42018098869). A research 
librarian conducted the literature search. Electronic databases searched for studies published 
between 2008 through May of 2018 included PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, 
and Cochrane Library (see Online Appendix A). All aspects of the review process 
were completed by 2 researchers. Titles and abstracts of all articles were screened for 
applicability. If the article appeared to meet the review’s inclusion criteria, the full article 
was reviewed and assessed to ensure that it met the criteria for inclusion. All discrepancies 
were reviewed by the same 2 researchers and consensus was met regarding the eligibility 
of the study. For each article included in this review, all references were reviewed for 
inclusion criteria. Additionally, citations for all included studies were identified through 
Google Scholar and reviewed for inclusion criteria.11

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria for this review included a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, 
samples of physicians and/or nurses, and publication year 2008 or later with outcomes 
targeting mental health (ie, stress, anxiety, depression, and negative mood), well-being/

resiliency, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and/or physical health. Exclusion criteria included 
studies with a focus on burnout without measures of mood (ie, depression/anxiety), 
resiliency, mindfulness, or stress; primary focus on an area other than health promotion 
(eg injury prevention and weight loss); and non-English papers.

Data Extraction

Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from each study by 2 independent 
researchers using a standardized template created in Covidence™.11 Data extracted 
included study author, location, population demographics, sample size, intervention details, 
quality details, and outcomes. Critical appraisal of studies was performed using Cochrane 
Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias.12

Data Synthesis

Although meta-analytic pooling across all the studies was desired, a wide variety of outcome 
measures was used to make quantitative pooling unsuitable. However, Cohen’s deffect sizes 
were calculated on studies reporting means and standard deviations. For studies measuring 
similar concepts, effect sizes were assessed with a mini meta-analysis using a fixed-effect 
approach.13 A Z-score was calculated based on the mean effect size and its standard 
error with the corresponding P-value identified. Additionally, studies were summarized 
descriptively and assessed qualitatively.

Results

Due to a broad search that was conducted, a wide array of studies were identified with 
most not meeting inclusion criteria. Eleven thousand five hundred forty references were 
identified for screening. Duplicates were removed (n = 1175). One hundred eighty-seven 
studies appeared to meet inclusion criteria and were assessed for full-text eligibility. One 
hundred fifty-eight studies were excluded for various reasons, including no intervention, 
the study involved students, and non-RCT design. This process resulted in 29 studies being 
included in this review (see Figure 1).14–42 These 29 studies had sample sizes of 22 to 
557. Six studies included physicians; 6 included nurses; and 17 included physicians, nurses, 
and/or other allied health-care professionals. Ten studies had attention-control groups, 11 
studies used wait-list control groups, 6 studies had no-attention control groups, and 2 studies 
had cross-over designs.

Instrumentation

Multiple instruments were used to measure a variety of mental health outcomes in 
the included studies. Seven studies measured anxiety, which was captured with the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, the Smith anxiety scale, the Symptoms Checklist-90-
Revised, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21).18,25,31,32,34,37,38 
Tools to measure mood in 8 studies included the Profile of Mood States, symptoms 
of distress, the Brief Symptom Index, the DASS, and mental health questions from 
the Short Form 36.15,19,20,23,24,26,29,30 Stress was most commonly measured with the 
Perceived Stress Scale and the DASS 12-item stress subscale. Other stress tools 
included the Coping with Stress Scale, the Nursing Stress Scale, and the Post-traumatic

Diagnostic Scale.17,18,22,23,25,27–29,31–33,36–38,42 The most common instruments used to 
assess mindfulness were the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale.14,15,18,35,36,38,41

Nine studies measured depression, which was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale, the DASS-21, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Symptom 
Checklist 90 Revised-Depression, the 2-item Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Health, 
and a 2-question screen.17,25,29–34,42 Well-being measures included the Work Ability Index 
Score, the Self Compassion Scale; the World Health OrganisationFive (WHO-5) Well-Being 
Index, Work Engagement, Empowerment at Work, and the Quality of Life: Linear Analog 
Self-Assessment Scale.20,21,24,25,29,32,37–39

Three studies measured physical activity with a pedometer or reported physical 
activity.19,28,40 Six studies included either body mass index (BMI) or weight.16,19,26,28,30,40 
Three studies included a measure of percent body fat.16,30,40 Two studies measured blood 
pressure16,19and 2 studies measured oxygen uptake during peak exercise (V˙ O2) peak.16,30

Type and Length of Interventions Delivered

Twelve studies provided a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) type intervention 
(see Table 1).14,15,20,31–36,39,41,42 The duration of studies was between 4 weeks to 9 months 
with total time in intervention sessions ranging from 10 to 53 hours plus home practice. 
The typical number of sessions in these MBSR interventions were 8 weekly sessions plus 
home practice. Eight studies provided stress reduction programs that included a variety 
of interventions, such as journaling, web-based stressed management, breathing exercises, 
and yoga.17,18,22,23,27,29,37,38 Duration of interventions in these studies were between 4 
weeks and 12 to 18 months with time ranging between 1 and 12 hours. Seven studies 
targeted improvement of lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity and/or healthy 
eating.16,18,24,26,28,30,40 The duration of these studies was between 4 and 40 weeks with 
time ranging between 12 and 92 hours. Two studies targeted overall well-being with 
interventions that included an eMental Health program utilizing cognitive behavior therapy 
(CBT) components and an online 10-week intervention that included asking physicians to 
complete microtasks designed to cultivate professional satisfaction and well-being.21,25

Studies varied widely in the variables evaluated and findings of significance reached 
postintervention (see Table 2). Authors reported either within group significance, between-
group significance, or both. Significant findings were identified for many variables, but not 
consistently across all studies.

Interventions That Improved Mental Health Outcomes

Seven studies assessed a mindfulness outcome (see Table 2). Six (86%) studies reported 
significant differences between groups, with sample sizes ranging from 22 to 127 and 
duration between 1.5 and 53 hours.14,15,18,35,36,38,41 One study reported only a correlation of 
mindfulness with subscales of the DASS and the Maslach’s Burnout Inventory.20

Sixteen studies assessed a measure of stress, 2 of which assessed post-traumatic 
stress.17,18,20,22,23,25,27–29,31–33,36–41 Seven (44%) studies identified a between-group

hours. The focus of the interventions included MBSR (n = 1, 14%),36 stress and resiliency (n 
= 3, 43%),23,37,38 and other (n = 3, 43%).22,17,29

Eight studies assessed a general mood measure.15,19,20,23,24,26,29,30 Three (37.5%) studies 
identified a significant between-group with sample sizes ranging between 40 and 98 and 
length of intervention was between 12 and 28 hours. The emphasis of the interventions 
varied and included MBSR,15 cardiovascular risk reduction,19 and benefits of relational 
groups.29

Seven studies assessed a measure of anxiety.18,25,31,32,34,37,38 Three (43%) studies identified 
a significant between-group difference with sample sizes ranging between 26 and 40, and 
duration was between 1.5 and 25 hours. One study focused on MBSR,34 while the other 
2 studies37–38 used the same intervention focusing on decreasing stress and enhancing 
resiliency.

Nine studies assessed a measure of depression.17,25,29–34,42 Four (44%) studies identified 
a significant between-group difference. Sample sizes ranged from 29 to 102 and duration 
between 11.5 and 27 hours of MBSR plus exercise, counseling, and journaling. Emphasis 
of the interventions included mindfulness (n = 2, 50%),31,34 gratitude (n = 1, 25%),17and 
benefits of a relational group (n = 1, 25%).29

Interventions That Improved Well-Being/Resilience and Sleep

Five studies assessed a measure of resilience;18,31,36–38 however, only 1 study identified a 
significant between-group difference.37 This study had a sample size of 40 and included a 
brief stress management and resiliency training intervention (1.5 hours).

Nine studies assessed a measure of well-being.20,21,24,25,29,32,37,39 Five (56%) studies 
identified a significant between-group difference. Sample sizes ranged between 26 and 557 
and the intervention duration was between 1.5 and 12 hours. Emphasis of the interventions 
included eMental Health (n = 1, 20%),25 decreasing stress and enhancing resiliency (n = 2, 
40%),37,38 exercise (n = 1, 10%),24 benefits of a relational group (n = 1, 20%).29

Eight studies assessed a measure of sleep or fatigue.19,21,22,25,29,32,35,37 Two (25%) studies 
identified a significant between-group difference. Sample sizes ranged between 120 and 127 
and duration of the intervention was between 7 weeks and 6 months (length of time not 
reported). Emphasis of the interventions included MBSR22 and mindfulness-based CBT.35

Interventions That Improved Lifestyle Behaviors/Physical Health

Six studies assessed a measure of body mass, including BMI or weight.16,19,26,28,30,40 One 
(17%) study identified a significant between-group difference with sample size 118 and 
intervention duration 40 weeks ( ~ 80 hours).16 The emphasis of the intervention was soccer 
or Zumba for exercise with the Zumba group having the significant effect. Three studies 
assessed a measure of fat.16,30,40 None identified a significant between-group difference.

identifying a significant between-group difference.16,19

Risk of Bias

All 29 studies were assessed using the Cochrane Bias Tool (see Table 3). Two studies 
scored low risk of bias for all 7 domains.24,35 The 2 binding domains were predominantly 
unclear or high risk of bias. The domain primarily judged as low risk was selective outcome 
reporting. Two domains had 5 studies judged as high risk for bias and included incomplete 
outcomes data and other sources of bias. Reporting of the randomization method was 
fairly high with 20 studies being judged as low risk. Six additional items of interest were 
extracted. Sixteen (55%) studies reported baseline comparability on key factors. Fifteen 
(52%) studies described drop-outs or withdrawals. Twenty-three (79%) studies had more 
than 80% of participants with measures at postintervention. Fourteen (48%) studies reported 
using intention to treat analysis. Only 2 (7%) studies reported fidelity assessment of the 
interventions. Eighteen (62%) studies indicated dose received by participants.

Effect Sizes and Mini Meta-Analysis

Effect sizes were calculated for 16 outcome variables (see Table 4). Effect sizes for stress 
were small, medium, and large almost equally divided. Mindfulness effect sizes were 
medium to large. Two effect sizes for mood were large with one being less than small. 
Effect sizes for anxiety ranged between less than small to large. Effect sizes for depression 
were less than small to small. Resilience effect sizes were medium to large with one being 
small in favor of the control group. The WHO 5 Well-Being Index and the Work Ability 
scales had an effect size of less than small to small. Distress and the work engagement scales 
had small effects. Quality of life effect sizes was less than small and medium. Measures of 
sleep and fatigue had effect size of less than small, small, and large. The effect size for a 
measure of fat was large. The effect size for physical activity was medium and large. The 
effect size for a measure of mass was less than small for 2 studies and large for 1 study. 
The mean effect size for variables ranged from −0.87 to 0.85. Significant Z-scores for the 
mini-meta analysis were found for stress, mindfulness, mood, anxiety, resilience, Who-5 
Well-Being Index, sleep, and fatigue.

Conclusions

There have been several published systematic reviews that focus on 1 specific dimension 
of wellness for physicians and/or nurses. This review is different and extends the science 
in that it focused on a wide array of interventions so that findings could reveal which 
types of interventions are the most effective in improving mental health, well-being, lifestyle 
behaviors, and/or physical health of physicians and nurses.

Studies in this review evaluated a variety of different types of interventions for decreasing 
stress, increasing mindfulness and resilience, and improving mood, anxiety, sleep, and 
fatigue. Many of the studies that incorporated mindfulness techniques had significant 
positive effects on stress, anxiety, and/or depression and were typically comprised of 
interventions that included 8 weekly 1- to 2.5-hour sessions led by a mindfulness-trained

instructor followed by at least 9 hours of practice at home. Although effective, mindfulness-
based interventions are usually time-intensive and require clinicians to attend lengthy 
sessions followed by several hours of practice that may be difficult to arrange with their 
schedules. Many hospitals also do not have qualified mindfulness trainers to deliver these 
interventions.

Three studies included CBT principles or therapy and had positive effects on mindfulness, 
sleep, fatigue, depression, and work engagement.25,31,35 A recent RCT of an 8-session 
manualized CBT-based intervention entitled MINDSTRONG© delivered by a nurse to new 
nurse residents also demonstrated decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress as well as 
improvements in job satisfaction up to 6 months following the intervention.43,44

Three studies that used a program called Stress Management and Resiliency Training, 
comprised of a brief 90-minute session that focused on attention and interpretation therapy 
that aimed to decrease stress and increase resiliency along with the use of deep breathing 
techniques, was found to lessen physician anxiety.37,38 A focus on helping clinicians to use 
gratitude practice also was effective on stress and depression.17 Only 1 study measuring 
physical parameters, such as BMI, fat, or blood pressure, found a significant difference 
highlighting the difficulty in changing healthy lifestyle behaviors to a significant degree.16

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this body of studies include RCT designs and several studies had 6- to 12-
month follow-up. However, several weaknesses in methodological design were apparent. 
Most of the studies did not measure intervention fidelity, which is critical in determining 
the impact of the interventions on outcomes. Many studies did not have attention-control 
groups that controlled for time spent with the experimental groups, which threatens their 
internal validity. Many studies did not report if participants or research staff were blinded. 
Some studies combined a variety of interventions, which make it difficult to determine 
what specifically impacted the outcomes. Additionally, the studies assessed outcomes using 
a variety of different measures, which inhibited pooling of the data across studies. Many 
studies used self-report measures rather than objective measures. The sample size in many 
studies also was small and attrition was higher than desirable.

Findings from RCTs are considered high-quality evidence. However, our rating was 
downgraded due to methodological weaknesses of several studies due to inadequate 
attention-control groups, lack of blinding or reporting of blinding of participants or 
research staff, or lack of information regarding handling of missing data. Therefore, the 
overall quality of this body of evidence appears to be moderate when considering the 
methodological weaknesses identified.45,46

There are limitations in the conduct of this review. Only English manuscripts have been 
included with 4 non-English studies identified through the literature search. Studies reported 
outcomes measured with a variety of tools limiting our ability to pool findings. Effect sizes 
were only calculated based on data reported in the published manuscripts for each study.

dates to the prior 10 years.

Individual and group evidence-based interventions that focus directly on clinicians are 
important to positively impact their health and well-being outcomes. However, without 
building a culture of well-being in healthcare systems that makes healthy choices, the norm 
or the easy choices for clinicians to make, those behaviors are not likely to sustain.47 It 
is also important to target system-based interventions that are known to adversely affect 
clinician well-being (eg, short staffing, long work hours, and alarm fatigue). Healthcare 
systems must invest in the well-being of their clinicians to enhance their outcomes and 
ultimately improve the quality and safety of care. Prior studies have shown that, for every 
dollar invested in employee wellness, the return on investment is $3 to $4.48 Value of 
investment also increases as clinicians who perceive they practice in a healthcare system 
that is supportive of their well-being tend to be in better physical and mental health, more 
engaged, and have higher levels of job satisfaction.3

Findings from this systematic review indicate an urgent need for more rigorously designed 
RCTs with attention-control groups that evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve 
the health and well-being outcomes of physicians and nurses. Studies should implement 
interventions that can be easily reproduced and scaled across the United States. It is 
critical that fidelity and dose response of interventions be assessed, and similar outcomes 
be measured so that data can be pooled to conduct meta-analyses. Sample size should be 
sufficient and long-term follow-up is important. Reliable objective measures provide greater 
confidence in study results.

What is already known on this topic?

So What?

A broad range of interventions have been tested to address physician and nurse mental 
health, well-being, and physical health with modest improvements.

What does this article add?

Our findings indicated that mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy-based 
interventions are effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Brief interventions 
that incorporate deep breathing and gratitude may be beneficial. Visual triggers, 
pedometers, and health coaching with texting increased physical activity.

What are the implications for health promotion practice or research?

Healthcare systems need to provide wellness cultures and rapidly translate evidence-
based interventions into clinical settings to improve the mental health, healthy lifestyle 
behaviors, and physical health outcomes of their clinicians, which should lead to 
improvements in the quality and safety of care. There is a need for more RCTs with 
rigorous methods and use of similar outcome measures.
