Abstract

Motor features of autism have long been acknowledged by clinicians, researchers, and community 
stakeholders. Current DSM-5 and ICD-11 guidelines allow clinicians to assign a co-occurring 
diagnosis of developmental [motor] coordination disorder (DCD) for autistic individuals with 
significant motor problems. DCD is characterized by poor motor proficiency with an onset of 
symptoms in early development. Studies have shown considerable overlap in the behavioral motor 
features observed in autism and DCD. However, others indicate that motor problems in autism 
and DCD may stem from different underlying sensorimotor mechanisms. Regardless of whether 
autism has a unique motor phenotype or an overlap with DCD, changes need to be made in the 
clinical pipeline to address motor problems in autism at the stages of recognition, assessment, 
diagnosis, and intervention. Consensus is needed to address unmet needs in research on the 
etiology of motor problems in autism and their overlap with DCD, to optimize clinical practice 
guidelines. The development of screening and assessment tools for motor problems that are valid 
and reliable for use with autistic individuals is essential, and an evidence-based clinical pipeline 
for motor problems in autism is urgently needed.

Author Note: In this manuscript, we use identity-first language to refer to autistic individuals, in alignment with current best-practice 
recommendations encouraging avoidance of disorder-focused or medicalized language in discourse. A preference for identity-first 
language in the developmental [motor] coordination disorder/dyspraxia community has not yet been documented, and so we continue 
to use person-first language for this group. We use the current ICD-11/DSM-5 diagnostic terminology of ‘autism spectrum disorder’ 
and ‘developmental [motor] coordination disorder’ when referring to the diagnostic criteria or process. We recognize that identity is 
deeply personal and affirm that all individual preferences regarding the language used to express identity are valid and should be 
respected.

Many neurodevelopmental conditions are accompanied by motor problems that are 
functionally relevant, but may not be assessed or prioritized in intervention planning. Several 
recent studies have documented a high prevalence of clinically significant motor problems 
in those with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis, ranging from 50% to 95%.1–4 
These are present across many domains, including functional mobility, physical activity, 
participation and competence in activities of daily living, and fall risk. Motor problems 
present a significant barrier to the performance of daily living activities, as well as for social 
and cognitive development.

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of common motor features in autism 
and discuss opportunities to improve identification and intervention for motor problems in 
this population. At present, Internationa Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11)5 
and DSM-56 guidelines permit clinicians to diagnose autistic individuals with co-occurring 
developmental [motor] coordination disorder (DCD), a neurodevelopmental condition of 
poor motor proficiency that affects activities of daily living. However, while it seems that 
a high percentage of autistic individuals meet the clinical criteria for DCD,3 very few 
actually receive a DCD diagnosis. Given that motor problems are a common and overlooked 
feature of autism, they may be better recognized and addressed by adding a domain-specific 
‘specifier’ to the ASD diagnostic criteria.1 Here, we provide an overview of the recent 
literature and present a case for a more uniform structure to the assessment and treatment of 
motor problems in autism.

MOTOR PROBLEMS IN AUTISM

There is strong empirical evidence that autistic individuals have differences in motor 
behavior compared to neurotypical individuals. These can be separated into two categories: 
motor stereotypies (e.g. hand flapping) and differences in motor control and motor 
coordination (e.g. postural instability, hand–eye coordination). The scope of this discussion 
is focused on motor control and motor coordination differences, not motor stereotypies, as 
these are captured under DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and defined separately in the ICD-11 
under 6A06. These motor differences persist in a variety of domains across the lifespan. 
A recent systematic review demonstrated that infants later diagnosed with autism exhibit 
significant motor differences,7 including delays in achieving motor milestones,8 and fine 
and gross motor problems in infants at an elevated likelihood of being autistic between 6 
months and 36 months.1,9 Studies have demonstrated the persistence of these differences 
beyond childhood into adulthood, for example, in the domains of static and dynamic 
balance10,11 and locomotion.12 Motor problems have also been highlighted when using 
screening measures used to identify those at risk of coordination difficulties,2 broader 
measures of adaptive functioning,1 and criterion-standard observational measures of motor 
proficiency.3

Importantly, motor problems are as prevalent and functionally impactful as other domains 
recognized as specifiers to an ASD diagnosis (e.g. intellectual and language impairment).1 
For example, intellectual disability is a common specifier for ASD, and prevalence estimates 
indicate approximately 30% to 50% of autistic individuals have an intellectual disability.

This rate is substantially lower than current prevalence estimates of motor problems in 
autistic individuals on both parent-reported measures (87%)2 and observational measures 
(97%; 85%).3,13 However, clinicians currently document motor problems in only around 
1% of autistic individuals,1,3 highlighting a serious need for improved recognition and 
documentation of motor problems in autism.

LIFESPAN FUNCTIONAL AND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF MOTOR 

PROBLEMS IN AUTISM

Autistic individuals’ persistent motor problems have a lifelong impact on developmental 
opportunities, and a downstream effect on daily living.1,14,15 Childhood consequences of 
motor problems include limited access to object and environment exploration, difficulty 
engaging with peers during play, and difficulty building non-verbal communication skills. 
Motor delays in sitting and crawling16 and limited use of motor skills during social 
interactions17 are among the earliest markers in children later diagnosed with ASD. 
Further, a recent systematic review of 114 motor studies (total n > 6000) found that gross 
motor performance in autistic children was strongly associated with social communication 
performance, noting large effects for gross motor problems in autistic compared to 
neurotypical children.18 Problems with locomotion, postural control, and manual dexterity 
limit autistic children’s ability to comfortably engage in self-care behaviors including eating, 
bathing, toileting, and dressing.19 Autistic adolescents’ and adults’ manual motor skills 
correlate not only with concurrent daily living skills but also predict subsequent daily living 
skills up to 8 years later.20 Autistic children and adults also experience barriers to physical 
activity including perceived difficulty and motor challenges.21,22 However, little is known 
about the long-term impact of decreased physical activity frequency and intensity across the 
lifespan of autistic individuals, or the specific physical, environmental, and social barriers 
they may encounter.23 There is an approximately 33% greater prevalence of overweight 
and obese autistic adolescents compared to neurotypical adolescents,24 placing them at risk 
for long-term health consequences. A recent longitudinal study tracking physical activity 
of autistic individuals from age 9 to 18 years found that autistic children became more 
physically inactive with age compared to neurotypical children.25 Given these findings, it is 
clear that there is a critical need to identify and address motor problems in autism early, and 
improve access to intervention and accommodation across the lifespan.

ASSESSMENT OF MOTOR PROBLEMS

Early recognition of motor problems is a prerequisite for early intervention and is vital in 
the prevention of secondary adverse outcomes, such as physical inactivity and academic 
difficulties. However, given the heterogeneous nature of motor problems in autistic children 
and adolescents, a comprehensive assessment battery is necessary to capture potential 
problems across different motor domains. Especially for autistic children, the administration 
of such a comprehensive motor assessment can be challenging. Conversely, screening for 
motor problems by means of a caregiver-reported questionnaire can optimize the cost–
benefit ratio and reduce the time and effort burden on all parties. Previous research indicates 
that the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, a 15-item caregiver-reported

questionnaire, can be used to detect motor problems in autistic children.26 Adding a brief 
screening tool like the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire to standard 
clinical procedures would provide clinicians with information about a child’s motor skills 
that may not be observable during routine visits. This information can help guide decision-
making with regard to whether a full motor assessment is necessary.

For children with motor problems, comprehensive assessment may be needed to determine 
the specific domains in which they require support or intervention. Several standardized 
observational measures are available for this type of assessment, and may be appropriate for 
use in autism. For example, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (currently in its 
second edition) has been used successfully to detect motor problems in autism.2,4,14,26 The 
use of observational measures such as the Movement Assessment Battery for Children as 
part of standard clinical practice of assessing autistic individuals’ motor skills can provide 
clinically relevant information about their manual dexterity, eye–hand coordination, bilateral 
coordination, and balance. Other movement assessments that have successfully been used 
to characterize motor profiles in autism include the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor 
Proficiency, Second Edition, Test of Gross Motor Development, Third Edition, and the 
Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, Sixth Edition. However, 
there is a lack of assessments that last through adulthood, with the Bruininks-Oseretsky 
Test of Motor Proficiency being the only one that can be used up to 21 years of age. It 
is important to consider that some assessments are especially useful with a visual support 
protocol, for example, the Test of Gross Motor Development.27 Depending on the specific 
areas of motor problems an individual appears to experience, a combination of these 
measures may be needed to sufficiently inform intervention and support planning. Further 
research is needed to assess the validity and reliability of observational motor assessments in 
autism across the lifespan.

Despite evidence for screening and assessment of motor problems in autistic individuals, 
it has been suggested that motor delays and impairments are potentially explained by lack 
of interest or motivation, difficulty managing social demands, or differences in intellectual 
ability, among other factors. Discounting the fundamental nature of motor differences in 
autism—independent of cognitive or social factors that may exacerbate their manifestation 
in assessment contexts—does a disservice to the autistic community. It does not presume 
intellectual and communicative competence and perpetuates ableist stereotypes that autistic 
individuals only experience motor problems because they cannot understand instructions or 
lack motivation to perform.28 Certainly, communication differences can present challenges 
in any assessment setting. For that reason it is important for assessments to be done by 
professionals who are experienced in working with autistic individuals, to ensure that the 
observed motor behaviors are not better explained by other factors. But there is a large body 
of evidence that autistic adolescents and adults have problems in motor domains that do 
not involve instruction in daily living, such as standing balance and walking as described 
previously. Further, many studies of autistic movement use assessment paradigms that have 
been shown to be engaging and accessible for autistic individuals. Continued research on 
the validity of standardized motor assessments in autism and clinical application of these 
assessments is needed to raise awareness of the fundamental nature of motor problems in 
autism, independent of cognitive and social skills.

IS IT CO-OCCURRING DCD?

Once motor problems are identified via appropriate assessments, clinicians are faced 
with the challenge of assigning diagnostic codes or labels and making recommendations 
for accommodations or interventions. Although a co-occurring diagnosis of DCD is 
permitted by ICD-115 and DSM-5,6 questions remain about whether this is the best 
approach. Unquestionably, there remains a need for further research to determine whether 
motor problems in autism are distinct from those observed in other neurodevelopmental 
conditions like DCD in their etiology, manifestation, and functional impact.29,30 In 
the meantime, however, there is a human cost to taking a ‘wait and see’ approach 
before addressing this issue in clinical practice. Autistic children, adolescents, and adults 
experiencing motor problems may not have the information or documentation necessary to 
access accommodative supports or intervention services. Since motor problems are not a 
recognized feature of autism under the current guidelines, insurers and education systems 
are often reluctant to provide coverage or resources unless a clinician also assigns a co-
occurring motor diagnosis (i.e. DCD).

Even though it can be helpful in circumstances where autistic people would otherwise not 
have access to care for motor problems, assigning a DCD diagnosis is not a panacea in all 
cases. There are three issues with a co-occurring diagnosis that may present barriers to care 
for some autistic individuals. First, a diagnosis of DCD is not currently recommended until 
at least 5 years of age,31 to account for natural variability that exists in the attainment of 
motor skills. The problem with this age-related barrier is that a critical therapeutic window 
to support the development of motor skills is likely to be missed. Second, if a diagnosis 
of ASD is assigned before 5 years of age (as currently recommended), a later, secondary 
diagnostic evaluation for DCD may place additional financial and time burden on families 
and clinicians. Evaluation for DCD may be particularly difficult for families to access, or 
not presented to them as an option, since DCD is under-recognized and underdiagnosed in 
the general population32 and in autism.1,2 Third, some motor problems seen in autism are 
distinct from features seen in individuals diagnosed with DCD, and so clinicians may be 
hesitant to assign co-occurring DCD as a co-occurring diagnosis. This is perhaps the most 
challenging issue, as there is limited research in this area on which to base a clinical practice 
guideline or consensus.

An overview of the few studies that have compared autism to DCD have found that 
problems with general motor ability as measured by the Movement Assessment Battery for 
Children assessment are comparable between the two groups.3,13 However, for certain praxis 
skills, such as imitation of meaningful actions and gesture to command, autistic children 
perform significantly worse than children with DCD, and in the autism group only, imitation 
errors correlate with emotion recognition ability.13 Thus, while general motor ability (i.e. 
balance, manual dexterity, and aiming/catching) may be comparable between autism and 
DCD, autism may be distinguished by poorer performance on imitation of meaningful 
gestures and other praxis skills.

MOTOR IMPAIRMENT AS AN ASD SPECIFIER

Currently, there is a clear research-to-practice gap in the recognition and management 
of motor problems in autism. Given that motor problems in autism are similar but not 
always identical to those observed in DCD, resolving this gap is challenging. One possible 
solution is to add ‘with or without accompanying motor impairment not otherwise explained 
by motor stereotypies’ as a domain-specific specifier to the ASD diagnostic criteria. The 
addition of a motor specifier would increase the likelihood that motor problems are assessed, 
documented, and managed in concert with other autistic traits, similar to the current practice 
for other domain-specific specifiers (i.e. language and intellectual impairments). Although 
motor stereotypies are already captured under the restricted, repetitive behaviors domain 
of the ASD diagnostic criteria, the full breadth of motor differences (e.g. motor control, 
motor coordination) observed in autism are not well represented by the current taxonomy. 
Affirming a motor specifier could serve as a triggering event for referral to comprehensive 
motor assessment (e.g. by neurologists or physical/occupational therapists). It would also 
enable autistic individuals to access motor-related services or accommodations, including 
before the age of 5 years, before a co-occurring diagnosis of DCD could be considered.

Adding motor problems as an ASD specifier may, therefore, be an effective stop-gap 
approach while research studies continue probing underlying etiology and diagnostic overlap 
with DCD. If future studies determine that the etiology of motor problems in autism are 
distinct from those observed in DCD, then a co-occurring diagnosis of DCD may not be 
needed or appropriate in some cases. If future studies determine that the etiology of motor 
problems in autism overlaps substantially with those observed in DCD, then the specifier 
would still serve as a triggering event for assessment and a means of accessing early motor 
intervention with less difficulty. It would, in essence, help to establish a clinical pipeline for 
screening, evaluation, and management of motor problems and DCD in autism. Finally, but 
certainly not of least importance, adding motor problems as a specifier would bring needed 
attention to this issue in the clinical and caregiver community. Given that motor problems 
are present in most autistic children in observational research studies but only diagnosed in 
approximately 1% of autistic children in clinical practice, increased awareness is the first 
step toward bridging the research-to-practice gap.

COMPLEX INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN MOTOR SKILLS AND OTHER 

DOMAINS

Current evidence from large sample studies indicate that motor difficulties are present in 
children with ASD with and without intellectual disability and they continue to predict 
autistic traits and language and functional delays even after controlling for cognitive delays. 
Therefore, while it is true that motor difficulties are greater in individuals with ASD and 
intellectual disability, they continue to negatively impact communication and functioning 
in the majority of autistic individuals, including autistic children without intellectual 
disability.33

The complex interrelationships between IQ, language, sensory, and motor differences in 
autism are evident in the dual task literature where the level of performance difference is

affected by task complexity.8,34,35 It is also evident in some studies relating motor skills 
with IQ, language, and sensory skills. In preschool autistic children, IQ scores are positively 
related with fine motor skills.36 Furthermore, social and communication functioning has 
been found to be positively related to manual dexterity and fine motor skills in autistic 
children and adolescents.37,38 While some studies have found that the relationship between 
motor skills and daily living skills is mediated by IQ in adolescence,39 others have found 
that sensory reactivity and motor skills uniquely contribute to daily living skills independent 
of IQ in early childhood.14 Despite this literature, it remains unknown if the presence of 
a greater number and magnitude of autistic traits exacerbates motor difficulties, or if early 
motor difficulties negatively impact the developmental affordances required for acquisition 
of cognitive, social communication, and other skills.40

Regardless of the outcome of this debate, motor differences have a clear and persistent 
impact in autism. Motor differences are still evident even when there are not competing 
cognitive, sensory, or language demands (e.g. quiet standing under normal visual and 
proprioceptive conditions).41 Additionally, motor differences predict later development even 
when controlling for IQ, language, and sensory domains. In a longitudinal study of 209 
autistic children, autistic children’s gross motor skills at 2 years of age predicted subsequent 
expressive and receptive language up to 9 years of age even when controlling for IQ and 
autism symptoms.42 These findings indicate that there is likely variability in the effects 
individual domains have on autistic individuals’ functional abilities. The challenge of teasing 
out the relationships between these domains and their impact on functional abilities makes 
it difficult to identify the mechanisms underlying motor problems in autistic individuals. 
However, consideration needs to be given to understand these complex interactions to 
enable more targeted interventions and accommodations for the specific needs of autistic 
individuals.

AWARENESS AND ACCESS TO CARE

For decades, stakeholders in the autistic community have been calling for researchers and 
clinicians to direct more attention toward issues that affect their physical health, mental 
health, and well-being.43 Motor skills have known effects on each of these areas, and motor 
skills interventions could provide significant improvements for autistic individuals’ quality 
of life. The addition of motor impairment as a diagnostic specifier would not only elevate 
community awareness of the presence and impact of motor problems in autism, but also 
open new doors to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other motor skill interventions 
and accommodations.

Further, access to motor interventions and accommodations could provide autistic 
individuals with opportunities to improve their physical and mental health. Physical health 
improvements may be achieved through increased access to or comfort with physical 
activity, decreased likelihood of falls or other injuries, and decreased risk of chronic 
health conditions such as obesity. Mental health improvements may be achieved through 
affirmation of lived experiences with motor problems and amelioration of frustration due to 
lack of explanation for these problems, improved self-esteem, access to information about 
accommodations and tools for self-advocacy in school or the workplace, and reduction of

the social isolation and limited participation commonly observed among individuals with 
untreated motor problems.

There is precedent for modification to the ASD diagnostic criteria based on emerging 
scientific evidence. In addition to the aforementioned specifiers for intellectual disability 
and language skills, sensory difficulties were added to the diagnostic category of restricted 
and repetitive behaviors. Yet, despite overwhelming evidence of its clinical relevance, motor 
problems are still absent from the criteria. Gaps in motor development increase over time, 
such that by 5 years of age, the motor skills of an autistic child are at the level of a child half 
their age.44 Yet, access to motor-related services (e.g. occupational therapy/physical therapy) 
decreases dramatically with age.45 This creates a clear unmet need that is not currently 
addressed in clinical practice.

It is critical to increase awareness of motor problems in autism and establish a clear 
pipeline for screening, assessment, and management. This pipeline should include a variety 
of clinic- , school- , and community-based services, including both motor skills interventions 
(e.g. occupational therapy/physical therapy) and adaptive recreation and fitness activities. 
This pipeline must be accessible to individuals across the lifespan, so that those diagnosed 
later in life do not fall through the cracks.

CONCLUSION

Regardless of whether autism has a unique motor phenotype or an overlap with DCD, 
changes must be made in the clinical pipeline to address motor problems in autism 
at the stages of recognition, assessment, diagnosis, and intervention/accommodation. 
Collaboration between community stakeholders, researchers, and clinicians is urgently 
needed to address this unmet need. We must continue research on the etiology of motor 
problems in autism and their overlap with other clinical conditions like DCD, in order to 
develop optimal clinical practice guidelines. What additional literature is needed to build 
consensus on the significant and ubiquitous presentation of motor problems in autism, and to 
prompt a change in current practices?

Autistic individuals deserve comprehensive care, including support for motor problems. 
This will ensure that they have equitable opportunities to develop the motor skills needed 
to engage comfortably and successfully in activities of daily living and recreation. Motor 
problems may be the key to fully understanding functional differences in this population. 
There is a vital need for services in this area across the lifespan, in order to adequately 
support autistic individuals through changes in their developmental context (e.g. their 
physical and cognitive states, social relationships, level of independence, and environments) 
and the demands of their day-to-day activities.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We are sincerely grateful to stakeholders in the autistic and DCD/dyspraxic communities for sharing their 
experiences with motor problems in research studies and personal interactions–they are vital agents of change 
with valuable expertise. We are also grateful to our partners in clinical practice, research, education, and advocacy 
who are working tirelessly to address unmet needs.
