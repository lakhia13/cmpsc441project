Abstract

In contrast to the association of insomnia with mental health, its association with physical health
has remained largely unexplored until recently. Based on findings that insomnia with objective
short sleep duration is associated with activation of both limbs of the stress system and other
indices of physiological hyperarousal, which should affect adversely physical and mental health,
we have recently demonstrated that this insomnia phenotype is associated with a significant risk of
cardiometabolic and neurocognitive morbidity and mortality. In contrast, insomnia with normal
sleep duration is associated with sleep misperception and cognitive-emotional arousal but not with
signs of physiological hyperarousal or cardiometabolic or neurocognitive morbidity. Interestingly,
both insomnia phenotypes are associated with mental health, although most likely through
different pathophysiological mechanisms. We propose that objective measures of sleep duration
may become part of the routine evaluation and diagnosis of insomnia and that these two insomnia
phenotypes may respond differentially to biological vs. psychological treatments.

Introduction

The prevalence of insomnia in the general population ranges between 8-40%, depending on
the definition used. While 20-30% of the general population has poor sleep (i.e., insomnia
symptoms of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, or non-
restorative sleep at any given time), another 8-10% of the population suffers from chronic
insomnia.1,2 Also, about 4% of the population use sleeping pills in a regular basis.3
However, the connection of insomnia with significant medical morbidity has not been
examined until very recently. This has led to view insomnia and its associated mental and
physical health complaints as a minor problem from a public health perspective.

A factor that may have contributed to this lack of firm association between insomnia and
significant medical morbidity is the definitions used for this disorder and the lack of

validated objective/biological markers. Sleep disorders were included for the first time in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III-R4 in 1987 and provided
overall diagnostic criteria for “insomnia disorders” based on the subjective complaints of
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or of non-restorative sleep, occurring at least 3
times a week for at least 1 month, and associated daytime functioning complaints. The
DSM-IV-TR eliminated the overall diagnostic criteria for “insomnia disorders” as well as
the frequency criterion, maintained the diagnoses of “primary insomnia”, “dysomnia NOS”,
insomnia “related to another mental disorder”, “due to a general medical condition”, and
introduced “substance-induced insomnia”.5 The DSM-5 has eliminated the different
insomnia diagnoses in DSM-IV-TR to reintroduce overall diagnostic criteria for “insomnia
disorder” with specification of comorbid mental and/or physical conditions, so that no causal
attributions between insomnia and the physical/mental condition are made, and has extended
the duration criterion from 1 month to 3 months.6 The latter change is an acknowledgement
that chronicity is what differentiates insomnia as a disorder vs. insomnia symptoms, i.e.,
poor sleep due to underlying, identifiable physical, emotional, or drug-related factors.

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), and its revised form ICSD-R
(1997), also defined insomnia based on subjective sleep and daytime functioning complaints
but, in contrast, attempted to identify subtypes based on “intrinsic” factors such as etiology
(i.e., “psychophysiological”), age of onset (i.e., “idiopathic insomnia”), degree of
discrepancy between objective sleep findings and subjective perception of sleep (i.e., “sleep
state misperception”) or “extrinsic” environmental factors such as “inadequate sleep
hygiene”, “food-allergy” or “altitude insomnia”. However, these subtypes, even when
refined in the ICSD-2,7 have not proven to be clinically useful and the reliability and
validity of DSM and ICSD diagnoses is at best modest.8

Although the objective sleep of insomniacs is different than that of normal sleepers, PSG
variables are not required or recommended for the diagnosis of the disorder. In fact, PSG
criteria have not proven to be useful in terms of differential diagnosis or severity assessment
and are not currently used in clinical practice. The sleep laboratory is useful for the
evaluation of patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), the diagnosis of narcolepsy,
and the differential diagnosis of idiopathic vs. psychogenic hypersomnia,9,10 as well as the
study of the initial effectiveness, continued efficacy or tolerance, and potential withdrawal
effects of a hypnotic drugs. The validity and clinical utility of sleep lab testing for
diagnosing insomnia has been evaluated in large studies11,12 that have shown that PSG
measures such as latency to sleep onset, total sleep time, number of arousals and
awakenings, sleep efficiency, or sleep stages, are not useful in the diagnosis or differential
diagnosis including subtyping of insomnia, except to confirm or exclude other sleep
pathologies when there is reasonable evidence from clinical history (e.g., SDB or periodic
limb movements). The current consensus is, therefore, that PSG is not recommended for
routine, differential diagnosis, or severity assessment of insomnia in clinical practice.13

In this review paper, we present evidence that objective measures of sleep are useful in
predicting the medical severity of insomnia (i.e., cardiometabolic and neurocognitive
morbidity and mortality) and that should be considered in the new classification of
insomnia.

Insomnia and the Stress System

In the last two decades, several models have been proposed to understand the etiology and
pathophysiology of insomnia and most of them have emphasized the importance of the joint
effect of stress and psychological factors in the pathogenesis of insomnia.14 The
characteristic psychological profile of patients with insomnia, consisting of cognitive-
emotional hyperarousal (i.e., obsessive, anxious, ruminative, and dysthymic personality

traits) and emotion-oriented coping strategies,14-16 is thought to be present pre-morbidly and
play a key role in the etiology of the disorder.14,17-20 Insomnia is associated with
precipitating life events21 and cognitive-emotional arousal14 and is perceived by the patient
as stressful on its own. Thus, insomnia should be expected to be associated with activation
of the stress system.

Stress has been associated with the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
and the sympatho-adrenal-medullary axes, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
and cortisol (products of the hypothalamus and adrenals, respectively), and catecholamines
(products of the sympathetic system) are known to cause arousal and sleeplessness to
humans and animals. On the other hand, sleep and particularly deep sleep appears to have an
“anti-stress” effect as it is associated with an inhibitory effect on the stress system including
its main two components, the HPA axis and the sympathetic system.

While the majority of early studies reported no difference between subjectively defined
“poor sleepers” and controls in the levels of cortisol secretion,22-24 later studies found that
24-h urinary free cortisol, norepinephrine, and catecholamine metabolites levels were either
increased in patients with insomnia with objective sleep disturbances as compared to
controls or were correlated with PSG indices of sleep disturbance in insomnia patients.25-31
The few exceptions might be related to the fact that the objective sleep of patients with
insomnia was very similar to that of controls32 or to lack of statistical power and controls
not being carefully selected.33,34 In addition, it was shown that middle-aged healthy
individuals were more vulnerable to the sleep disturbing effects of the stimulating hormones
of the HPA axis, i.e., CRH, which may explain physiologically the increased prevalence of
insomnia in older subjects.35 Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated that this type of
insomnia is associated with increased nocturnal heart rate and impaired heart rate
variability,36,37 increased overall oxygen consumption (VO2), a measure of whole-body
metabolic rate,38,39 and increased pupil size, indicative of sympathetic system activation,40
but not in insomnia defined only on subjective measures.41,42

Another paradox with patients with insomnia who typically complain that they are fatigued
and sleepy during the day is that during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) they have
either similar or increased daytime sleep latencies when compared to controls.42-45 In fact,
several studies have shown that, within patients with insomnia, those with shorter objective
sleep duration show longer sleep latencies in the MSLT44,46-48 and are more alert in
vigilance tests.38,39,46 This is in contrast to normal individuals who after sleep deprivation
experience significantly reduced sleep latencies on the MSLT and decreased alertness in
vigilance tests, i.e., physiological sleepiness.49,50 Thus, long latencies in the MSLT may
represent a reliable marker of physiological hyperarousal in insomnia patients.

Finally, evidence about the presence of central nervous system hyperarousal in insomnia
comes from studies in human subjects using neuroimaging,51,52 and spectral,53,54 arousal,55
and event-related56 electroencephalography analyses as well as from studies on the neural
circuitry of stress-induced insomnia in rats.57 Increased cortical arousal during sleep is
present to a variable degree in all patients with insomnia53-56 and may explain why they
perceive their sleep as wake and as non-restorative.58,59

Insomnia and Cardiometabolic Morbidity

Until recently, chronic insomnia has not been linked firmly with significant medical
morbidity, such as cardiovascular disease. Several surveys have shown a significant
relationship between difficulty falling asleep or poor sleep with cardiometabolic outcomes
such as hypertension60-62 and diabetes.63-66 For example, persistent complaints of difficulty
initiating or maintaining sleep were associated with an increased risk of hypertension,61

acute myocardial infarction,62 and incident type 2 diabetes.63-66 However, these studies
showed relatively small effect sizes and did not include a PSG evaluation so as to control for
SDB or other sleep pathology. The findings of these early studies were dismissed as
methodologically flawed by many clinicians and researchers alike.67,68 In fact, at least one
report showed a reduced mortality rate for those individuals complaining of sleep difficulties
after 6 years of follow-up.69

Given the well-established association of hypercortisolemia with significant medical
morbidity, (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and others),25-31
we hypothesized that insomnia with objective short sleep duration is associated with
significant cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. A series of recent epidemiological
studies from the Penn State Adult Cohort,1 that used in-lab PSG, have shown that insomnia
with objective short sleep duration is associated with a high risk of hypertension,70,71
diabetes,72 and mortality.73 For example, compared to normal sleepers who slept ≥ 6h per
night, the highest odds of hypertension or diabetes was in patients with insomnia who slept
≤5h (OR = 5.1 and OR = 2.95, respectively) and the second highest in patients with
insomnia who slept 5-6 h (OR = 3.5 and OR = 2.07, respectively), while patients with
insomnia who slept ≥ 6h were not at significantly increased risk of hypertension or diabetes
(OR = 1.3 and OR = 1.1, respectively). Recent longitudinal data from the same cohort has
shown that patients with insomnia who slept < 6h were at a significantly higher risk of
incident hypertension (OR = 3.75),71 suggesting that insomnia precedes the onset of
hypertension. Interestingly, in a recent longitudinal study we found that non-obese chronic
insomniacs, despite sleeping objectively shorter than controls or poor sleepers, did not have
a significantly increased risk of incident obesity; in fact, they were less likely to become
obese than controls or poor sleepers.74 These data indicate that insomnia with objective
short sleep duration may be linked to medical morbidity such as hypertension and diabetes
through mechanisms other than weight gain and obesity (i.e., activation of the stress system
and inflammation process). Furthermore, other longitudinal research showed that mortality
risk in men was significantly increased in patients with insomnia who slept < 6 h compared
to normal sleepers (OR = 4.00), and that there was a marginally significant trend toward
higher mortality from insomnia with short sleep duration in men with diabetes or
hypertension (OR = 7.17) than in those without these comorbid conditions (OR = 1.45).
Thus, the impact of insomnia with short sleep duration was much stronger in those with
diabetes and hypertension at baseline versus those who were healthy.73 In women, mortality
was not associated with insomnia with short sleep duration, most likely related to the fact
that women were followed-up for a shorter time period.

Consistent with the findings of these population-based studies, other recent studies have
shown (1) higher nighttime systolic blood pressure and reduced day-to-night systolic blood
pressure dipping,75 (2) impaired heart rate variability,76 (3) lower cardiac pre-ejection
period,77 and (4) poorer indices of glucose metabolism78 in patients with insomnia.
Cumulatively, these data suggest that objective short sleep duration may predict the medical
severity of chronic insomnia.59

Insomnia and Neurocognitive Morbidity

Patients with insomnia typically complain of difficulty concentrating, memory problems,
and difficulty focusing attention. However, studies using objective neuropsychological
testing have produced inconsistent findings. This has led some researchers to question the
existence of true cognitive impairments in insomnia79 and attribute the daytime complaints
to excessive attention to the expected consequences of poor sleep.14

The role of objective sleep measures in the association of insomnia with cognitive
impairment has been addressed in a recent study from the Penn State Adult Cohort.80 This

study showed that patients with insomnia, based solely on a subjective complaint, did not
differ significantly from controls on either PSG variables or neurocognitive performance.
However, significant interactions between insomnia and objective short sleep duration (i.e.,
< 6h) on specific neurocognitive tests were found. Specifically, patients with insomnia with
objective short sleep duration showed poorer neuropsychological performance on tests of
processing speed, switching attention, and number of short-term visual memory errors and
omissions compared to control groups with normal or short sleep duration. In contrast,
patients with insomnia with normal sleep duration group showed no significant deficits
when compared to controls. Based on these findings, it seems that insomnia with objective
short sleep duration is associated with deficits in switching attention, a key component of the
“executive control of attention”.80 Importantly, the presence of a group of good sleepers
with short sleep duration allowed to demonstrate that deficits in executive attention were
associated with underlying physiological hyperarousal, a characteristic of chronic insomnia,
rather than to short sleep per se.80 Another recent study by Edinger et al,81 examined the
association between physiological hyperarousal, as measured by the MSLT, and response
accuracy on reaction time tasks among 89 individuals with primary insomnia as compared to
95 well-screened normal sleepers. Interestingly, the authors found that individuals with
MSLT mean onset latency > 8 min showed lower nighttime sleep efficiencies and increased
wake after sleep onset, suggesting 24-h physiological hyperarousal particularly in the
primary insomnia group. Importantly, they found a significant interaction between insomnia
and increased MSLT mean onset latency so that individuals with primary insomnia and with
MSLT mean onset latency > 8 min showed greater error rates in switching attention tasks
than normal sleepers with MSLT mean onset latency > 8 min, who showed no significant
deficits. The authors concluded that physiological hyperarousal in insomnia may lead to
increased daytime alertness yet dispose these individuals to higher error rates on tasks of
switching attention,81 a finding consistent with those of a study by Fernandez-Mendoza et
al., in which physiological hyperarousal was ascertained by objective short sleep duration.80

A recent meta-analysis has shown that individuals with insomnia exhibit performance
impairments of small to moderate magnitude in several cognitive functions, including
working memory, episodic memory, and some aspects of executive functioning.82 However,
an important factor that has been neglected in meta-analytic research of the neurocognitive
literature is the role of the degree of objective sleep disturbance in this association. As we
have recently reviewed,59 most studies have shown that cognitive performance is impaired
in patients with insomnia with objective sleep disturbances or that it correlates with
objective markers of sleep disturbance in patients with insomnia, whereas those studies in
which performance was not significantly impaired established insomnia diagnoses using
solely subjective criteria.59

Cumulatively, the data from these studies indicate that objective short sleep duration may
predict its effect on cognitive functions. Future studies should examine whether insomnia
with objective short sleep duration may be a premorbid risk factor for mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and dementia.

Insomnia and Psychiatric Morbidity

Many studies have established that insomnia is highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders
and is a risk factor for the development of depression, anxiety, and suicide.83 However, the
mechanisms by which insomnia precedes the development of psychiatric disorders, e.g.,
depression, are unknown. In a recent study from the Penn State Adult Cohort, insomnia with
objective short sleep duration was associated with a psychological profile consistent with
depressed mood, fatigue, concerns about health and physical functioning, somatically
focused anxiety, and poor health status, which is typical of medical outpatients.58 In
contrast, insomnia with normal sleep duration was associated with sleep misperception (i.e.,

the underestimation of time asleep and overestimation of time awake during the night) and a
psychological profile consistent with depressed mood, rumination, anxiety, intrusive
thoughts, and poor coping resources.58 These data have led us to suggest that both insomnia
subtypes are associated with (or are at risk of developing) psychiatric disorders but that
different pathophysiological mechanisms may account for such an association.59 For
example, it is possible that biological mechanisms, i.e., hyperactivity of the HPA axis, may
play a role in the development of depression in insomniacs with objective short sleep
duration, while psychological mechanisms, i.e., poor coping resources and ruminative traits,
may play such a role in insomniacs with normal sleep duration. However, these hypotheses
need yet to be tested.

Natural History of Insomnia: Chronic Insomnia vs. Poor Sleep

As mentioned in the introduction, about 20% of the general population has poor sleep (i.e.,
insomnia symptoms at any given time) and about another 10% has chronic insomnia.
Natural history studies have shown that chronic insomnia is a highly persistent condition,
whereas the course of poor sleep is more variable and has a higher remission
rate.17,19,20,84,85 This suggests that insomnia is a disorder while poor sleep is a symptom of
underlying mental and physical health problems.19,20,85 Furthermore, objective short sleep
duration has been shown to be a risk factor for poor sleep evolving into the more severe
form of chronic insomnia20 as well as of chronic insomnia becoming persistent.85 These
latter findings suggest that objective short sleep duration may be a biologic marker of
genetic predisposition to chronic insomnia20 and of the severity and chronicity of the
disorder.85

Conclusion

As a result of the above-reviewed literature we have suggested two phenotypes of chronic
insomnia. The first phenotype is primarily associated with physiological hyperarousal (i.e.,
short sleep duration and activation of both limbs of the stress system), significant medical
sequelae (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, cognitive impairment, increased mortality), and a
persistent course. The second phenotype is associated with cognitive-emotional and cortical
arousal, but not with physiological hyperarousal (i.e., normal sleep duration and normal
activity of the stress system) or significant medical sequelae, and is more likely to remit over
time. Furthermore, the first phenotype is associated with a psychological profile typical of
medical outpatients, whereas the second phenotype is associated with sleep misperception,
anxious-ruminative traits, and poor coping resources.59Table 1 summarizes the findings of
key studies, while Figure 1 depicts a heuristic model of the underlying pathophysiological
mechanisms and clinical characteristics of the two insomnia phenotypes.

Our proposed model for the two insomnia phenotypes may have an impact on how we
diagnose and treat chronic insomnia. As we have stated earlier, previously proposed
subtypes of insomnia are based on subjective tools such as clinical interviews,
questionnaires, and specific scales and their diagnostic reliability is, at best, modest. The
data reviewed here suggest that objective measures of sleep can be useful in detecting the
most severe form of insomnia. Thus, we propose the inclusion of objective sleep duration as
a criterion in future diagnostic manuals for insomnia in order to differentiate these two
clearly different and clinically relevant subtypes of insomnia.

Further, our data suggest that objective measures of sleep, in addition to a thorough clinical
evaluation, should become part of the standard diagnostic procedures for insomnia.59
Although our studies have focused on the utility of sleep duration, other studies suggest that
other variables of sleep efficiency and continuity or of physiological hyperarousal (i.e.,
MSLT) may also serve as markers of the biological severity of the disorder.20,26,81,86-88

However, a potential disadvantage of biomarkers such as stage 1, SWS, or MSLT is that
they require a full PSG study or daytime laboratory assessment, whereas sleep duration
perhaps could be obtained with simpler methods, e.g., actigraphy. In this regard, several
studies suggest the potential usefulness of actigraphy to assess sleep patterns for a period of
days or weeks in the “habitual home environment”, to characterize the severity of the
insomnia disorder.88 A similar amount of home sleep monitoring with PSG would be
difficult and impractical for clinical venues. However, several problems associated with the
use of actigraphy, such as lack of an industry standard for the sleep algorithms used in
different actigraphic devices and the propensity to over- or underestimate sleep time, make
its current use limited. Future studies using cost-effective methods should examine which
variables, i.e., sleep duration vs. night-to-night variability, and which methods, i.e.,
actigraphy, salivary cortisol, peripheral measures of sympathetic activation, are better
predictors of cardiometabolic and neurocognitive morbidity.

Finally, our findings may affect the way we treat chronic insomnia. The insomnia phenotype
with short sleep duration may respond better to treatments that primarily aim at decreasing
physiological hyperarousal and increasing sleep duration, such as medication or other
biological treatments.30 Previous studies have shown that sedative antidepressants such as
trazodone or doxepin, used at low dosages, down-regulate the activity of the HPA axis,
decrease cortisol levels, and increase sleep duration.30,89,90 Needless to state that biological
treatments should be part of a multidimensional approach that combines behavioral changes,
i.e., sleep hygiene, and psychological interventions, i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT), when indicated. The second phenotype, i.e., insomnia with normal sleep duration,
may respond better to treatments that primarily aim at decreasing cognitive-emotional
arousal, changing sleep-related beliefs and behaviors, and altering sleep misperception, such
as CBT.91 Psychotherapeutic medication may be indicated based on the presence of
comorbid psychiatric conditions, i.e., anxiety or depressive disorders. The differential
treatment response of these two phenotypes should be tested in future placebo-controlled
clinical trials. In any event, the treatment of insomnia with objective short sleep duration
should become a priority given its severity and its effects on physical health. Finally, in the
prevention of chronic insomnia, our strategies should focus on (1) those with premorbid
cognitive-emotional hyperarousal and short sleep duration, (2) stress-related poor sleep with
short objective sleep duration, and (3) a family history of sleep problems.18-20
