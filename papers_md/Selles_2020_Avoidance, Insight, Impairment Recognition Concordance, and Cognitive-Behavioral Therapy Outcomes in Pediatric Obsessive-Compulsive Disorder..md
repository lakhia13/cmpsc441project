Abstract

Objective: Insight and avoidance are commonly discussed factors in obsessive compulsive 
disorder (OCD) that have demonstrated associations with increased severity as well as reduced 
treatment response in adults, but have not been sufficiently examined in pediatric OCD. The 
present study examines the impacts of avoidance, insight, and impairment recognition 
concordance, on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outcomes, as well as impacts of CBT on 
insight and avoidance, in a large sample of OCD-affected youth.

Method: Data from 573 OCD-affected youth enrolled in CBT trials was aggregated. The 
Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale items measured treatment response, insight, 
and avoidance. Standardized differences between child- and parent-ratings of impairment were 
used to calculate impairment recognition concordance. Binary logistic regression was utilized to 
identify variables associated with treatment response.

Results: Greater avoidance, limited child recognition of impairment, older age, and lower 
baseline severity predicted reduced likelihood of treatment response, but insight did not. Both

insight and avoidance improved significantly following CBT. Response rates were lower when 
post-treatment insight and avoidance were worse.

Conclusion: Contrasting with prevailing belief, poor insight does not appear to limit CBT 
response potential in pediatric OCD. Avoidance and impairment recognition are understudied CBT 
response predictors and warrant further consideration in pediatric OCD. Clinicians should attend 
to these factors to optimize outcomes for children affected by this common, debilitating illness.

Lay Summary

Combining data from four programs, the present study features an international sample of 573 
youth with obsessive compulsive disorder who received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 
Youths’ symptom insight at baseline was not related to their likelihood of responding to treatment, 
but youth were less likely to have responded to treatment if they were older, had lower baseline 
severity, had greater baseline avoidance, and reported much less OCD-related impairment 
compared to their parent. Improvement in insight and avoidance over treatment was common, but 
lower rates of treatment response were observed among youth with worse post-treatment 
avoidance and insight. Youth denial of OCD-related impairment, but not poor baseline insight, 
may represent a signal of treatment resistance and tracking/targeting of avoidance and insight 
throughout CBT is recommended.

Introduction

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing psychiatric condition that is 
associated with reduced quality of life,1 impairment in functioning,1–3 and a chronic course 
if untreated.4 Consistently found to be efficacious and tolerable, cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) emphasizing exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a first line approach for 
treating pediatric OCD; however, a sizable proportion of youth receiving CBT do not 
achieve response and/or remission.5–7 Identification of vulnerability factors associated with 
suboptimal response may provide additional treatment targets to improve eventual outcomes.

OCD-related avoidance, symptom insight, and recognition of impairment may represent 
such factors. Avoidance (i.e., an individual’s attempts to minimize or circumvent triggering 
of distress/symptoms) is a common behavioral coping strategy employed by youth with 
OCD.8–11 Symptom insight (i.e., an individual’s recognition that obsessions/compulsions 
are problematic symptoms of an OCD diagnosis rather than true, natural, or protective 
beliefs/behaviors) is an important clinical feature of OCD.12–14 Given that the presence of 
impairment is included in diagnostic criteria for OCD, failure to recognize or admit 
impairment observed by other family members may also represent an additional marker of 
illness awareness that has not been adequately explored in pediatric OCD. Prior to 
intervention, insight and avoidance are strongly correlated,15 and both factors are associated 
with greater OCD severity.15–19

Given that ERP requires the patient to directly approach their feared stimuli without the use 
of safety behaviors, reducing avoidance and improving insight are likely fundamental in 
achieving optimal treatment outcomes. Avoidance is the opposite of the approach 
encouraged through exposure and therefore will be addressed throughout treatment. In 
addition, insight may be expected to improve as individuals learn to face the threat of 
obsessional content via ERP and build confidence managing their compulsive urges despite 
that perceived threat. In fact, although rarely examined as an outcome, prior research has 
indicated that insight improves and avoidance is reduced following CBT.20–22

However, insight, avoidance and divergent family perspectives regarding illness impact may 
also present barriers to treatment success. Given that CBT for pediatric OCD generally 
requires parent involvement, failure of either the child or the parent to recognize negative 
impacts of OCD may limit motivation to engage in treatment. Youth with poor insight and/or 
severe avoidance also may be less likely to engage, or more likely to subvert, ERP exercises 
due to a perception that their behaviors are protective (e.g., “if I don’t hide the knives, I 
might really hurt myself”; “I can’t handle my distress”) or functional, rather than 
problematic (e.g., “my compulsions/avoidance help me to feel okay and get on with my 
day”). In support of this, both poorer insight and greater avoidance at baseline have been 
associated with reduced response to CBT/ERP in a number of adult OCD studies,23–26 
although contradictory results have also been reported with respect to baseline insight.27,28 
Further, when measured again at post-treatment, two small studies (n = 41; n = 78) of adults 
with OCD found that failure to improve insight during treatment, rather than baseline levels 
of insight, was associated with attenuated response.20,21 In pediatric OCD, one treatment 
study has suggested that poorer baseline insight was associated with reduced response across 
SSRI, CBT, combined SSRI plus CBT, or pill placebo treatment groups.29 Specific to CBT, 
a recent study noted better baseline insight was associated with greater improvements in 
global severity (Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale) but not OCD severity as 
measured by the Children’s Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS).30 No 
pediatric OCD studies were identified that examined changes in insight or avoidance and 
CBT outcomes.

Given that insight and avoidance are domains directly influenced during ERP, and that initial 
evidence suggests they may predict treatment response, further examination within the 
context of pediatric OCD treatment is warranted. In addition, examination of parent- and 
child- concordance regarding impairment warrants exploration as an additional construct 
that may impact CBT response. Therefore, utilizing a well powered, multi-site aggregated 
sample of youth receiving CBT, the present study addressed the following two primary and 
one exploratory aims:

Primary Aim 1.

To examine whether baseline avoidance, insight or impairment recognition concordance, 
predicted response to CBT at post-treatment. It was hypothesized that greater avoidance, 
poorer insight, and limited impairment recognition would be associated with reduced 
likelihood of response to CBT.

Method

Participants and Procedures

Measures

Data for 573 OCD-affected youth was obtained from four international pediatric OCD 
programs that implemented CBT trials (see Table S1, available online for program/study 
details). This sample represents a subsample of participants previously combined and 
included in Selles et al (2018).15 Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of OCD and a 
baseline CY-BOCS total score ≥ 16 and an insight rating. The sample was 53.2% female and 
aged 7 to 19 years old (M = 12.67; SD = 2.87). See Table 1 for an overview of participant 
characteristics for individual programs and the combined sample.

Diagnostic Assessments: Sites utilized either the Kiddie Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia – Present and Lifetime Version31 or the Anxiety Disorder 
Interview Schedule for Children – Parent Version32 to establish baseline diagnoses.

OCD Severity:

CY-BOCS:33: The CY-BOCS is a 10-item clinician-rated measure of OCD severity in 
youth. Items (time spent, interference, distress, resistance, control) across two subscales 
(obsessions and compulsions) are rated from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more 
severe symptoms. The psychometric properties of the CY-BOCS have been well established.
33,34

Avoidance: The CY-BOCS includes a clinician-rated extension item (Q12) that measures 
avoidance. Youth are asked the extent to which they avoid doing things, going places, or 
being with people because of obsessions or compulsions. Using provided detailed 
descriptors as reference, answers are rated on a five-point scale, specifically 0) None; 1) 
Mild; 2) Moderate; 3) Severe; and 4) Extreme. Only one youth was missing an avoidance 
rating at baseline.

Insight: The CY-BOCS includes a clinician-rated extension item (Q11) which assesses 
insight, most specifically, overvalued ideation/fixity of belief. In particular, youth are asked 
whether they believe their concerns or behaviors are reasonable as well as whether they 
believe their feared outcome may occur if they do not perform their compulsions. Using 
provided detailed descriptors as reference, answers are rated on a five-point Likert scale, 
specifically 0) Excellent; 1) Good; 2) Fair; 3) Poor; and 4) Lacks Insight/Delusional.33 In

youth, Q11 is the primary measure used in prior studies of insight in pediatric 
OCD15,19,29,35 and when assessed, Q11 demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability.35

Impairment Recognition Concordance: In pediatric OCD, discordance of child and 
parent-reported impairment suggests that one of the parties may underestimate (or 
overestimate) impacts of this illness. Therefore, to supplement analyses, impairment 
recognition concordance was calculated using parent- and child-ratings on versions of the 
Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale (COIS) at baseline. A total of 482 youth had 
available child- and parent-ratings on the COIS. Sites varied in utilizing the original 52-item,
3 the revised 33-item,36 or a brief 20-item, version (see Supplemental Table 1 for utilization 
of measure by program). As such, prior to calculation, raw COIS total scores were converted 
into standardized z-scores within each site and then combined across sites. The difference 
between parent-rated impairment and child-rated impairment was then calculated, with 
concordant impairment recognition indicated by a z-score difference between −1 and 1, and 
discordant impairment recognition indicated by all other z-score differences. Discordance 
possibilities included limited parent recognition of impairment (relative to child report) 
indicated by z-score difference scores below −1 (i.e. child reported substantially more 
impairment than the parent), and limited child recognition of impairment (relative to parent 
report) indicated by difference z-scores above 1 (i.e. parent reported substantially more 
impairment than the child). Due to the method of measurement, impairment recognition 
could not be recalculated at post-treatment.

Analytic Plan

Relationships between baseline OCD severity, avoidance, and insight were examined using 
Pearson correlation coefficients. One-way ANOVAs were used to examine relationships 
between impairment recognition concordance and OCD severity, avoidance, and insight.

An intent-to-treat approach was utilized to address missing post-treatment CY-BOCS total 
scores. Of the 573 youth assessed at baseline, 90% (n = 517) had complete post-treatment 
CY-BOCS scores. When missing, post-treatment CY-BOCS total scores were replaced with 
CY-BOCS scores from (in order of priority) 1-month follow-up assessment (n = 6), mid-
point assessment (n = 12), or baseline assessment (n = 38). The predictive impact of 
avoidance, insight, and impairment recognition concordance on treatment response (≥ 35% 
reduction in CY-BOCS score)37 was calculated using binary logistic regression. Due to 
associations with poorer insight at baseline,15 child age and baseline symptom severity were 
included as covariates along with study site. Due to the small number of youth with absent 
insight (n = 8), youth with absent and poor insight were combined for the regression 
analysis.

Improvements in insight and avoidance were evaluated using chi-square testing and the 
measured effect size of change from baseline to post-treatment (Cohen’s d). As post-
treatment insight and avoidance were measured simultaneously with post-treatment severity, 
their associations with treatment response were examined only descriptively. Post-treatment 
insight and avoidance ratings were available for 89% of youth (n = 510).

Results

Baseline Outcomes

Page 6

At baseline, distribution of insight ratings were as follows: excellent (29.7%; n = 170); good 
(34.0%; n = 195); fair (24.6%; n = 141); poor (10.3%; n = 59); and absent (1.4%; n = 8). 
Distribution of avoidance ratings at baseline were: none (16.8%; n = 96), mild (19.9%; n = 
114), moderate (37.6%; n = 215), severe (20.6%; n = 118), and extreme (5.1%; n = 29).

Relationships between baseline OCD severity, insight, avoidance, and impairment 
recognition concordance are presented in Table 2. Increased OCD severity was noted among 
poor/absent youth although the overall correlation between insight and OCD severity is 
small (r = .15, p < .001). Avoidance was significantly positively correlated with OCD 
severity (r = .40, p < .001). Insight had a small but significant negative correlation with age 
(r = −.13, p = .001), while avoidance was not correlated with age (r = .08, p = .054). Insight 
and avoidance were significantly positively correlated with each other (r = .20, p < .001). No 
significant relationships were found between impairment recognition concordance and 
baseline OCD severity [F (2, 480) = 2.48, p = .09], child age [F (2, 480) = 0.87, p = .42], 
insight [F (2, 480) = 1.20, p = .30], or avoidance [F (2, 479) = 1.21, p = .30].

Impact on CBT Response

Table 3 presents the distribution of CBT responders (≥ 35% reduction in CY-BOCS score)37 
versus CBT non-responders in addition to the mean CY-BOCS score change across baseline 
levels of insight, avoidance, and impairment recognition convergence. Results from the 
binary logistic regression analysis indicated that the model accounted for a small but 
statistically significant portion of the variance in likelihood of response [Adjusted R2 = .14, 
X2 (15, 467) = 51.65, p < .001; see Table 3]. Regarding control variables, site was 
significantly associated with response rate and a greater likelihood of response was predicted 
by younger age and higher baseline severity.

Baseline insight was not significantly related to response rates. Greater baseline avoidance 
and limited child recognition of impairment predicted reduced likelihood of achieving 
response to CBT. Response rates steadily declined with worsening avoidance from a 71.9% 
(n = 69) response rate for youth with no avoidance down to a 48.3% (n = 14) response rate 
for youth with extreme avoidance. Only 46.2% (n = 30) of youth with limited recognition of 
impairment (relative to the parent’s recognition) responded to treatment, in comparison to 
62.3 – 66.8% of youth with either concordant, or limited parent, impairment recognition.

Impact of CBT on OCD-Related Insight and Avoidance

Changes in insight and avoidance levels over treatment were evaluated using chi-square 
analyses. Results indicated that insight ratings significantly changed over treatment [X2 (16, 
494) = 67.14, p < .001] with most youth maintaining, or improving towards, excellent 
insight (see Figure 1). Avoidance ratings also significantly changed with treatment [X2 (16, 
494) = 116.00, p < .001] with most youth exhibiting reductions in avoidance (see Figure 1). 
Restricted by limited room for improvement (e.g., youth cannot improve on excellent insight 
or no avoidance), overall effect sizes were moderate for insight improvement (d = 0.67) and

avoidance improvement (d = 0.94); however, very large improvements were observed when 
only examining youth who had poor or absent baseline insight (d = 2.85; n = 60) or severe/
extreme baseline avoidance (d = 2.36; n = 127).

Post-Treatment Insight and Avoidance and Response

Table 4 presents the distribution of responders to CBT and the mean CY-BOCS Change 
across post-treatment insight and avoidance ratings. Lower response rates presented with 
each level of declining insight and increasing avoidance at post-treatment, decreasing from 
78.0% (n = 224) response among youth with excellent insight (n = 287) to 23.5% (n = 4) 
response among youth with poor insight (n = 17) and from 87.6% (n = 219) response among 
youth with no avoidance (n = 250) to 3.4% (n = 1) response among youth with severe/
extreme avoidance (n = 29).

Discussion

The present study elucidates roles of insight, avoidance and concordance of parent-child 
reported impairment in the context of CBT for pediatric OCD. Baseline insight did not 
predict treatment response while greater baseline avoidance, limited child impairment 
recognition (relative to parent), older age, and lower baseline severity, were associated with 
a reduced likelihood of treatment response. Insight and avoidance were identified as factors 
that substantially improve with CBT. Finally, individuals with worse insight and more 
avoidance following CBT also demonstrated lower response rates to CBT, indicating 
improvements in these factors is related to symptom improvement.

These results contrast with both adult OCD findings and conventional thinking, by 
suggesting that baseline insight does not have a substantial impact on the likelihood of 
treatment response. Regardless of youth’s awareness that their beliefs may be excessive, 
unrealistic, and/or a manifestation of their OCD, it appears that CBT is equally efficacious. 
In addition, youth typically maintained, or moved towards, higher levels of insight over 
CBT. Given that, prior to treatment, youth with poor insight demonstrate greater distress, 
avoidance and reduced symptom resistance,15 results of the present study may indicate that 
through ERP tasks (i.e. approaching fear, increasing resistance), the youth may begin to 
understand the nonsensical or excessive nature of their symptoms and change their 
dysfunctional beliefs.38 If so, it seems possible that poorer insight may still be expected to 
negatively impact the efficacy of placebo and medication (i.e., despite reductions in 
perceived distress, poorer insight does not lead to changes in behaviors or beliefs) which 
may partially explain the present study’s differences from the findings that poorer insight 
predicted worse outcomes across treatments in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study.29

Regarding differences from adult findings,23–26 pediatric OCD has been proposed as a 
developmental subtype that is distinct from adult OCD.39 Among adult samples, poor 
insight has been associated with earlier age of onset,16,40 longer symptom duration,40 and 
more chronic course.16,41 Given the low observed frequency of absent insight in the present 
sample, it seems possible this subgroup may delay seeking assessment/treatment until 
adulthood, at which point their symptoms may be further entrenched and their likelihood of 
response to intervention reduced. In addition, limitations in the assessment of insight among

youth as compared to adults (e.g., youth may be incorrectly identified as having poor insight 
due to issues in identifying or describing core fears, impulsivity toward compulsive urges 
despite no strong beliefs, extensive avoidance) may have contributed to the lack of 
associations between insight and outcome. Overall, the findings suggest that poor insight 
should not be considered a contraindication for CBT in youth.

In contrast to insight findings, limited child impairment recognition (relative to the parent) 
was associated with reduced treatment response and smaller mean CY-BOCS reductions. As 
limited child impairment recognition captures denial of OCD-related problems, it may 
represent a better proxy for “poor insight” in youth compared to Q11 of the CY-BOCS. 
Completion of CBT is a difficult and time-consuming process that requires experiencing 
distress, extensive behavioral changes, and potential temporary reductions in functioning. A 
child’s minimizing of OCD-related impairment relative to his/her parent may be an early 
marker that the child is lacking motivation to engage in treatment. An individual who does 
not recognize or believe the negative impacts of OCD would likely provide less effort 
towards, expect less benefit from, or be more easily turned away by initial negative 
experiences of, treatment. As impairment recognition was calculated via discrepancies in 
parent and child reports, family factors, such as accommodation (e.g., accommodations shift 
impairment from child to parent) and conflict/dysfunction/blame (e.g., parent blames child, 
so child denies symptoms), may also play a role in the observed associations.42–44 
Regardless, these findings suggest that impairment recognition concordance is likely an 
important variable to be evaluated and considered at the onset of treatment.

Greater baseline avoidance was also associated with decreased likelihood of treatment 
response. Consistent with insight, ratings of avoidance improved significantly over the 
course of treatment, perhaps demonstrating both direct (e.g., successful targeting of 
avoidance) and indirect (e.g., less avoidance due to reduced symptom severity) benefits from 
CBT. As a barrier to CBT response, extensive avoidance may mask a youth’s symptom 
severity at baseline (e.g., patient under reports time spent, distress, and interference 
associated with symptoms due to persistent avoidance of triggers) and prevent, or slow, 
youth’s engagement in both planned and naturalistic ERP. As a result, clinicians should 
ensure that initial estimates of severity and impairment adequately reconcile the role that 
avoidance may play (e.g., wearing gloves may temporarily reduce hand-washing) and, if the 
youth is engaged in avoidant behaviors, clinicians should monitor their use within the 
context of ERPs and ensure that the patient is directly/fully engaging with the feared 
stimulus. For some youth, extensive avoidance may also signal the presence of other factors, 
such as poor distress tolerance45 and unwillingness to experience unpleasant thoughts, 
emotions, and/or bodily sensations46 which may have a more direct impact on inhibiting 
treatment success and warrant slight modifications to treatment (e.g., utilizing interoceptive 
exposures,47 pharmaceutical augmentation).

While not the focus of the present study, it is worth noting that older age was also associated 
with a reduced likelihood of treatment response. While older youth may have additional 
cognitive and communication capacities for treatment, one might hypothesize that younger 
youth are more malleable to intervention (e.g., symptoms less entrenched, faster learning).

trials in the present study, may also be more substantial for younger youth (e.g., greater 
parental involvement in symptoms and opportunity for control over behavior).

Following CBT, results indicated that individuals who finished treatment with poorer insight 
or more avoidance were also less likely to have responded to treatment. As avoidance and 
insight were measured simultaneously to symptom severity at post-treatment, it is not clear 
whether this outcome implicates these domains as possible mediators of treatment 
improvement or if these domains are simply secondary outcomes of treatment response. 
These results are particularly difficult to interpret given that most youth made large 
improvements in avoidance and insight, and that post-treatment ratings included youth 
whose insight or avoidance worsened rather than simply failed to improve. It is possible that 
difficulties in assessing insight at baseline (e.g., patient reports excellent insight at baseline 
but reveals absent insight once ERPs became challenging) prevented the study’s ability to 
detect youth who display the trait-like resistant insight observed in adult studies. However, 
worse post-treatment ratings in these domains could be a reflection of other patient factors 
associated with non-response (e.g., distress tolerance, motivation), a failure of the 
intervention or clinician (e.g., ERPs did not adequately target the core fear), or other 
unknown factors. Regardless of the relationship direction or other factors contributing to its 
association, the above findings suggest that clinicians may be advised to monitor insight and 
avoidance throughout treatment and, if failing to improve or deteriorating, consider adjusting 
treatment to better target these domains (e.g., reconceptualization of core fear, enhanced 
focus on avoidance behaviors and acceptance of obsessions, and consideration of treatment 
alternatives including medication augmentation).

The study has several limitations. The participants included in the present study were 
recruited at OCD specialty centers for a variety of clinical trials examining ERP-focused 
CBT and combined retrospectively. With a broad distribution of patients in regard to 
nationality, age, baseline severity, treatment history, and comorbidity, the study sample is 
highly representative of treatment-seeking youth with primary OCD; however, study results 
may not generalize to all youth experiencing OCD, particularly those who may have OCD 
within the context of a different primary disorder, those experiencing excluded comorbidities 
(e.g., psychosis, active suicide risk), and/or those not presenting for assessment/treatment. 
This limitation may partially explain the particularly small number of youth with absent 
insight (n = 8) included in the present study and, as a result, reduced the likelihood of 
finding a relationship between absent insight and reduced treatment response. Second, 
although all sites provided ERP-focused CBT, they differed in exact delivery (e.g., dosing 
amount and frequency, components, individual versus group, extent of family/parent 
involvement). These differences reflect how varied CBT provision can be, even within the 
context of OCD specialty centers/treatment trials, and further supports the generalizability of 
the present study’s findings; however, these differences limit the ability to draw specific 
conclusions about study findings within the context of any one approach to treatment 
delivery. Third, insight and avoidance were measured by single items that are not 
comprehensive or truly continuous and limited impairment recognition was assessed 
indirectly. Finally, while in comparison to individual sample studies, data aggregation 
reduced the number of statistical tests, multiple testing was conducted increasing the chance 
of type-I error.

In conclusion, avoidance, insight, and parent-child concordance on impairment, all appear to 
be variables relevant to CBT. As a result, it is recommended that clinicians assess and 
monitor these factors prior to, and throughout, treatment. Future studies are needed to 
understand the emergence of problematic presentations, such as limited child impairment 
recognition, and extreme avoidance, in youth prior to treatment. In addition, the use of more 
comprehensive and frequent assessment of these domains throughout the treatment process 
is recommended to identify reasons for lack of change in, or worsening of, insight and/or 
avoidance over treatment.

Clinical Guidance

•

•

•

•

Poor symptom insight at baseline does not appear related to CBT outcome; 
however, research using a more comprehensive measure of insight is needed 
in pediatric OCD to be more conclusive

Greater avoidance at baseline may slow/complicate treatment progress, but 
should not be considered a barrier to CBT participation.

Clinicians are recommended to measure and contrast child- and parent-reports 
of OCD-related impairment, as limited impairment recognition by the child as 
compared to their parent may limit improvement.

Avoidance and insight should be tracked and targeted throughout CBT and if 
youths’ avoidance and/or insight does not improve with treatment, alternate 
conceptualizations or treatment approaches should be considered.
