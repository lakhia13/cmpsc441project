Histrionic personality disorder is one of a group of conditions called "cluster B" or "dramatic" personality disorders. People with these disorders have intense, unstable emotions and distorted self-images. For people with histrionic personality disorder, or HPD, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention. The word histrionic means "dramatic or theatrical."

This disorder is more common in women and people assigned female at birth, but researchers think that might reflect bias in how the condition is diagnosed.Â  It's usually is evident by adolescence or early adulthood.Â

Histrionic vs.borderline personality disorder

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is another "cluster B" condition. Like people with histrionic personality disorder, people with BPD have strongemotionsthat change rapidly. If you have BPD, you're very worried about people abandoning you.Â

A major difference between these two personality disorders is that people with BPD feel more despair and show more suicidal behaviors.Â

Histrionic vs.narcissistic personality disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is also a "cluster B" condition. If you have NPD, you feel superior to other people and think you're entitled to praise and special treatment. A major difference between the histrionic and narcissistic disorders is that someone with NPD is very focused on how special they are, something experts call "grandiosity."Â

- Be overly concerned with physical appearance

## Causes of Histrionic Personality Disorder


The exact cause of histrionic personality disorder is not known, but many mental health professionals believe that both learned and inherited things play a role.Â

For example, the tendency for histrionic personality disorder to run in families suggests that a genetic cause might exist. But the child of a parent with this disorder might simply be repeating behavior they learned at home.Â

Other things that experts think might play a role:Â

- Not being criticized or punished as achild

- Getting positive feedback from parents only when you show certain behaviors that they approve ofÂ

- Inconsistent, unpredictable attention from parentsÂ

- Confusion about what behaviors will get approval from parentsÂ

Your temperament, psychological style, and the way you learn to cope with stress while growing up all can play a role in the development of a personality disorder.Â


## Histrionic Personality Disorder Diagnosis


Your personality continues to change and develop as you grow up, so it's unusual for a doctor to diagnose histrionic personality disorder before you're 18 years old.Â

Personality disorders are tough to recognize, and if you have one, you may not think there's anything wrong with you. Often, someone with histrionic personality disorder seeks help because their condition has caused problems in their life, such asrelationship issues, leading to depression or anxiety.

If you show signs of HPD, your doctor may do a complete medical and psychiatric history. The doctor might do a physical exam and laboratory tests (such as neuroimaging studies or blood tests) to make sure a physical illness is not causing your symptoms.Â

If the doctor finds no physical ailment, they might refer the person to apsychiatrist,Â psychologist, or other licensed behavioral health professionalÂ who may use specially designedÂ interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a personality disorder.

A mental health professional will ask questions about your:Â

- Impulse controlÂ

If you have HPD, you might not be aware of your behaviors, so family members or others close to you could be asked for their input.

You may find quizzes and self-assessments online, but there's no exact histrionic personality disorder test. Only amental healthprofessional can make a diagnosis.

TheAmerican Psychiatric AssociationâsDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disordersspells out the criteria for an HPD diagnosis. The most recent version of this handbook, published in 2013, Â is called DSM-5.

If you have HPD, you'll show five or more of these behaviors on a regular basis:Â

- You're uncomfortable unless you're the center of attentionÂ

- You behave seductively or provocativelyÂ

- Your emotions are shallow and shift easilyÂ

- You use your appearance to draw attentionÂ

- Your speech is vagueÂ

- You think your relationships are closer than they really are

- You're easily influenced by othersÂ

- Your emotions are dramatic or exaggerated


## Histrionic Personality Disorder Treatment


If you have histrionic personality disorder, you might not think you need therapy. Your dislike of routine might make following a treatment plan difficult.Â

Psychotherapy(a type of counseling) is generally the treatment of choice for histrionic personality disorder. The goal of treatment is to help you uncover the motivations and fears linked to your thoughts and behavior, and to help you learn to relate to others in a more positive way.

Types of therapy that might help include:Â

- Group therapy, which involves meeting with people who have the same diagnosis, supervised by a mental health professional. If you have HPD, it can give you a window into what your own behavior looks like to other people.Â

- Psychodynamic psychotherapy tries to get at the root of your emotions and behaviors.

- Supportive psychotherapy focuses on improving your symptoms and developing coping skills.Â

- Cognitive behavioral therapyis a goal-oriented approach that helps you unlearn negative patterns and substitute healthier ones.Â

You might take medication to treat other conditions, such as depression and anxiety.

- Conversion disordersare also called functional neurological symptom disorder. When you have this, your mental health condition causes physical symptoms such as seizures, paralysis, loss of sight, or loss of hearing. The symptoms are real, but they are caused by your mental health disorder disrupting your brain and central nervous system.Â
