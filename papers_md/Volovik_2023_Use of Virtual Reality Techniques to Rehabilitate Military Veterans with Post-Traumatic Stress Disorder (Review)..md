Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  mental  and  behavioral  disorder  developing  after  a  traumatic  event  like  participation  in 
combat activities. Objective diagnosis of combat PTSD and effective rehabilitation of war veterans is a current multifaceted problem with 
particularly high social costs. This review aims to evaluate the potential of virtual reality technique used as exposure therapy tool (VRET) to 
rehabilitate combat veterans and service members with PTSD.

The review was written following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). 

The final analysis includes 75 articles published in 2017–2022.

VRET therapeutic effect mechanisms were examined along with protocols and scenarios of VRET combined with other interventions 
influencing  PTSD  treatment  like  pharmacotherapy,  motion-assisted  multi-modular  memory  desensitization  and  reconsolidation  (3MDR), 
transcranial magnetic stimulation. The necessity is substantiated of psychophysiological measurements for objectification of PTSD clinical 
criteria and its dynamics during treatment. It was shown that inclusion of VRET to the package of PTSD rehabilitation interventions positively 
affects  the  results  due  to  the  enhanced  effect  of  presence  and  greater  experience  personalization.  Thus,  VRET  may  be  an  effective, 
controlled, and cost-effective alternative for PTSD treatment in combatants, including those not responding to conventional therapy.

Key words: post-traumatic stress disorder; PTSD; military veterans; virtual reality; VR; virtual reality exposure therapy; VRET.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental and 
behavioral  disorder  developing  after  a  traumatic  event 
like  participation  in  combat  activities,  a  terrorist  act, 
traffic  accident,  sexual  assault,  domestic  violence,  and 
other  threats  to  person’s  life  and  health  [1].  Symptoms 
of  PTSD  may  include  disturbing  thoughts,  feelings,  or 

dreams related to the traumatic event; mental or physical 
distress  due  to  cues  associated  with  the  trauma; 
avoidance  of  the  event  reminders;  changes  in  thoughts 
or feelings and increased fight-or-flight response (Walter 
Cannon,  1932).  A  person  with  PTSD  is  at  higher  risk 
for  suicide  and  intentional  self-harm.  These  symptoms 
persist for more than a month after onset [2].

PTSD  was  first  talked  about  after  the  Vietnam  War;

reviewsat  the  same  time,  development  of  a  psychodiagnostic 
toolkit  was  started  to  identify  the  main  symptoms 
making  up  the  PTSD  syndrome  [2].  About  2.5  million 
U.S. servicemen were involved in operations in Iraq and 
Afghanistan,  and  according  to  various  reports,  10−30% 
of them developed PTSD [3]. Studies show that modern 
wars veterans compared to veterans of previous eras are 
at increased risk of developing mental disorders, suicidal 
behavior,  are  prone  to  homelessness  and  problems 
with  criminal  justice  [4]. According  to  a  sample  of  U.S. 
veterans,  $923  million  were  spent  during  two  years  to 
treat  PTSD  in  the  late  2010s  putting  a  high  burden  on 
health care [5]. Long-term studies conducted for a year 
or  more  after  trauma  exposure  allowed  to  reveal  a 
typical  symptom  dynamic  leading  to  either  recovery  or 
a prolonged PTSD treatment [6].

Considering  that  PTSD  includes  a  wide  enough 
spectrum of both somatic and psychogenic disorders, its 
diagnosis  is  rather  difficult.  The  main  goal  is  to  rule  out 
other  conditions  with  different  etiology.  Then,  the  most 
important issue is to reveal the traumatic experience in the 
anamnesis and to establish the disorders connected with 
it  [7].  The  clinical  questionnaires  most  commonly  used 
to  diagnose  PTSD  are:  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for 
DSM  (SCID)  —  Davidson  J.,  Smith  R.,  Kudler  H.,  1989; 
Mississippi  Scale  for  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  — 
Keane  T.M.  et  al.,  1987,  1988;  Clinical-administered 
PTSD  Scale  (CAPS)  —  Weathers  F.W.  et  al.,  1990; 
Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) — Horowitz M.J. 
et al., 1979; Combat Exposure Scale — Keane T.M. et al., 
1989 [8].

Thus,  PTSD  diagnosis  is  primarily  based  on  data 
obtained from the patient’s self-report. In this connection, 
factors allowing to establish a disorder presence and to 
assess  its  severity  may  depend  on  their  conscious  or 
unconscious  misrepresentation  in  the  patient’s  verbal 
report.  As  a  consequence,  the  necessity  to  objectivize 
PTSD clinical criteria in psychophysiological parameters 
space becomes more and more obvious. The results of 
a psychophysiological research confirmed diagnostically 
significant  differences  in  functioning  of  the  central  and 
vegetative  nervous  system,  sensory  and  cognitive 
systems  between  conditionally  healthy  people  and 
people  with  PTSD  [9].  Numerous  instrumental  data 
confirm differences in CNS functioning [10–12].

activity  measured  applying  various 
techniques  of 
heart  rate  recording.  Cognitive  functions  are  assessed 
related  to  PTSD  like  memory,  executive  functions  and 
cognitive flexibility. Emotional involvement and emotional 
regulation,  risk  and  reward  sensitivity  are  investigated 
using ECG, EEG, fMRI, and MRI along with eye tracking 
and photoplethysmography [13–17]. The development of 
these and other instrumental techniques is important for 
effective  medical  and  psychological  support  of  combat 
veterans at all stages of military service [14].

Conventional  PTSD  treatment  is  based  on  exposure 
therapy  (ET),  including  prolonged  exposure  (PE),  its 
success  requiring  presence  of  both  the  patient  and 
physician at treatment sessions along with observing the 
protocol  of  activities.  However,  most  of  the  necessary 
activities  are  performed  without  medical  supervision 
outside the clinic.

It  is  well  known  that  the  rehabilitation  process  may 
become  unnecessarily  protracted  if  the  patient  loses 
interest in it or sufficient human and technical resources 
are  unavailable 
[18].  Premature  discontinuation  of 
treatment was noted in 20–25% of veterans with PTSD 
[19]. Impaired affect regulation and finding treatment “too 
stressful”  are  among  the  cited  reasons  [17].  Thereby, 
service providers may need to adapt existing treatments 
to meet individual patient needs. An important problem is 
the risk of developing secondary traumatic stress among 
physicians  and  other  personnel  providing  psychiatric 
care  to  military  personnel,  veterans,  and  persons  who 
were  in  a  conflict  zone  and  faced  traumatic  situations 
daily [8, 20, 21].

Combining  conventional 

techniques 
with  the  use  of  new  technologies  (e.g.  brain-computer 
interfaces,  noninvasive  brain  stimulators,  wearable 
function  analysis  devices,  etc.)  may  have  a  positive 
effect  on  recovery  from  PTSD  [19].  Results  of  a  2018 
meta-analysis by the International Society for Traumatic 
Stress Studies (ISTSS) showed that a number of novel 
therapies, e.g. neurobiological effects management and 
transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (TMS),  evidenced 
effective  therapy  of  persistent  PTSD  [22].  In  2020, 
ISTSS experts ranked virtual reality (VR) technology as 
a promising intervention for PTSD treatment [23].

Mechanisms of VRET therapeutic effect

A  major  component  of  PTSD  is  the  inability  to 
suppress  the  maladaptive  fear  response  resulting  from 
pathologically  increased  activity  in  the  amygdala  and 
dorsal  anterior  cingulate  cortex  along  with  reduced 
activity 
[1]. 
Increasing  the  endogenous  activity  of  the  latter,  e.g. 
using TMS during fear-inducing stimuli processing, may 
be a promising method for inhibiting fear and improving 
treatment efficacy [28].

the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex 

in 

According  to  Liu  et  al.  [29],  virtual  reality  exposure 
therapy (VRET) is widely used to correct PTSD, phobic 
and  anxiety  disorders,  nervous  system  disorders  and 
to  manage  pain.  VRET  effectiveness  relies  on  models 
of  fear  response  formation  based  on  origination  of 
conditioned  bonds  anchoring  the  relevant  pathological 
engrams;  interruption  of  these  bonds  leads  to  fear 
[30].  Re-activation  of 
reduction  or  suppression 
trauma  memory  with  VRET  allows  to  incorporate  new 
information  related  to  safety  in  therapeutic  environment

and  anxiety  resulting  from  individual  experience.  This 
retraining is at the heart of the therapy and is an active 
process involving amygdala synaptic modification.

Landowska et al. [31] using a combination of functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and VR showed that 
both ET and VRET normalize brain activity in the circuit 
controlling  fear.  The  authors  measured  the  dynamics 
of  oxygenated  hemoglobin  (HbO)  concentration  in  the 
dorsolateral  and  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex  during 
several exposure sessions. Activity reduction was found 
in  these  areas  during  the  first  exposure;  then,  during 
three consecutive sessions, activity increased to normal 
contributing  to  inhibit  amygdala  activity  and  thus  to 
retard the fear response.

Verger  [32]  conducted  a  study  where  therapy  based 
on  eye  movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing 
(EMDR)  was  combined  with  stress  exposure  to  VR 
war  scenes  and  reported  a  positive  sign  evidenced 
by  improvement  in  precuneus  metabolism  (according 
to  positron  emission  tomography)  in  servicemen  with 
PTSD. After  EMDR,  connectivity  reduction  of  metabolic 
changes  between  the  precuneus  and  large  bilateral 
clusters  of  cerebellum  posterior  areas 
(cerebellar 
lobules  Crus  I  and  VI)  was  observed  concurrently  with 
reduction  of  PTSD  clinical  manifestations  severity. 
Increased  metabolism  in  relevant  cerebellum  areas 
decreased after EMDR. Increased precuneus metabolic 
activity  after  EMDR  therapy  correlated  with  clinical 
improvement  according  to  CAPS  [33].  A  study  in  mice 
described  a  neural  pathway  controlled  by  the  superior 
colliculus that mediates persistent fear attenuation, when 
alternating  bilateral  sensory  stimulation  during  EMDR 
is combined with conditioned stimuli [34]. Stimulation of 
that  kind  suppressed  the  activity  of  fear-encoding  cells 
in  the  basolateral  amygdala  and  stabilized  inhibitory 
neurotransmission  via  a  direct-coupled  inhibition  circuit 
from  the  mediodorsal  thalamus. Apparently,  this  neural 
circuitry  underlies  an  effective  strategy  for  sustained 
attenuation of traumatic memories in PTSD.

Association was demonstrated between hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal  axis  functioning  and  PTSD  treatment 
outcome  in  veterans.  In  patients  who  responded  to 
therapy,  salivary  cortisol  levels  before  and  after  a  VRET 
session  (6  sessions)  tended  to  be  higher  than  average, 
this  predicting  greater  improvement  in  PTSD  symptoms 
[35, 36]. Higher cortisol levels associated with the session 
contribute  to  fear  attenuation  and  reconsolidation  and 
may  be  considered  as  biomarker  of  response  to  PTSD 
therapy.

Protocols and scenarios of VRET combined  
with other PTSD therapies

therapy 

VR  exposure 

is  based  on  prolonged 
intervention  aimed  to  virtually  recreate  the  trauma 
patient  story  [37].  Protocols  of  PTSD  therapy  separate 
sessions  and  courses  are  available  at  a  considerable 

number  of  studies  [38–40,  etc.]. Almost  all  researchers 
emphasize the importance of the meaningful part of the 
scenarios used for VRET.

The most widespread scenarios are VR narrative ones 
based on the patient’s life story presented by the patient 
from the narrator’s position [41]. The basic principles to 
develop  war  scenarios  for  VRET  were  defined  with  the 
participation of combat veterans with PTSD and should: 
be  dynamic  and  include  multisensory  experience,  be 
combined with conventional therapy, provide a sense of 
presence and realism of sensations [42].

VR  exposure  therapy  can  be  effective  to  prevent 
PTSD  before  manifestation  and 
to  prevent  PTSD 
augmentation  after  manifestation.  Pyne  et  al.  [43]  used 
VRET  in  their  study  to  run  a  preventive  training  course 
aimed  at  increasing  soldiers’  resistance  to  occurrence 
of PTSD. Participants were divided into two groups: with 
heart rate variability biofeedback and with modification of 
cognitive  distortions.  Severity  of  PTSD  symptoms  was 
measured before manifestation, at 3 and 12 months after 
deployment.  Overall,  no  significant  effect  of  VRET  was 
achieved in this study. Nevertheless, resistance training 
as  a  preventive  measure  against  PTSD  development 
was found to be useful because the subgroup of soldiers 
above 45 years had lower rates of PTSD symptoms after 
its  formation  compared  to  younger  soldiers  and  to  a 
control group having never been in a conflict zone.

et  al.  [45]  obtained  results  showing  that  D-cycloserine

after  VRET,  but  no  significant  additional  effect  was 
found from taking dexamethasone. And dexamethasone 
improved  no  ET  results.  Besides, 
intake  was 
associated with frequent withdrawal from therapy (76.9% 
compared  with  28.5%  in  the  placebo  group)  [46].  The 
results  of  this  study  demonstrated  the  potential  risks  of

activates  participation  and  increases  attention  during

for  simultaneous  and

Psychophysiological measures can provide important

Psychophysiological  methods  of  autonomic  nervous 
system  research  are  used  to  monitor  the  process  of 
PTSD  treatment  with  VRET,  to  predict  and  objectively 
evaluate  the  results  [20,  45,  47,  53].  For  instance, 
Gramlich  et  al.  [6]  recorded  heart  rate  (HR),  GSR,  and 
skin  temperature  every  5  min  during  VR  sessions, 
comparing  the  results  with  the  clinicians’  assessment 
and  self-questionnaire  data.  During 
the  course  of 
treatment,  ET  group  participants  showed  greater 
increase of HR compared to the VRET group. GSR rates 
increased  during  early  sessions;  then,  a  habituation 
response was formed. Exposure to traumatic memories 
increased  GSR,  this  correlating  with  PTSD  symptoms

with  impaired  sympathetic  and  cardiovagal  baroreflex 
sensitivity  and  increased  inflammation  (blood  samples 
were  analyzed  for  inflammatory  biomarkers,  C-reactive 
protein levels). However, the 1-minute cold pressor test 
applied showed no significant difference of sympathetic 
response,  blood  pressure,  and  HR  between  the  groups 
with and without PTSD. VRET was particularly effective 
in  reducing  anxiety  by  eliciting  reactions  to  realistic 
frightening stimuli in patients with PTSD, and this helped 
to eliminate cognitive and functional disorders [57].

Participants’  HR  increased  slightly  during  the  sessions

beginning, this being consistent with the strong negative 
feelings  experienced  by  the  study  participants  during 
the  sessions.  However,  during  treatment,  SUDS  scores 
and  negative  feelings  decreased,  and  positive  feelings 
increased  significantly  coinciding  with  reduction  of 
PTSD  symptoms  as  assessed  by  clinicians.  A  strong

3MDR + VRET therapy courses to veterans, multi-omics 
biomarkers  (proteomic  and  genomic  profiles  of  blood

mediators  and  microRNA)  were  studied,  eye  tracking, 
EEG,  HR,  breathing  movements,  and  walking 
patterns  were  analyzed  [21,  58].  3MDR  operators  and 
physicians  had  no  serious  issues.  Inclusion  of  genetic 
and  psychobiological  measures 
into  predictors  of

Efficiency, limitations and prospects of VRET

Currently,  ET  is  the  only  intervention  for  PTSD 
with  sufficient  evidence  of  effectiveness  [45].  In  2001, 
Rothbaum  et  al.  [60]  published  the  first  open  clinical 
trial showing a significant reduction of PTSD symptoms 
after  VRET.  In  randomized  clinical  trials,  conventional 
ET  is  most  commonly  used  to  actively  control  efficacy 
of  VRET  for  PTSD  in  military  personnel.  No  significant 
advantages of VRET over ET were found [61–63].

In studies of Beidel’s group [64, 65], individual VRET 
was  compared  to  conventional  group  psychotherapy  in 
an  intensive  outpatient  format.  PTSD  symptoms,  sleep 
quality,  levels  of  depression,  anger,  guilt,  and  social 
isolation  were  assessed  after  treatment,  after  3  and 
6 months of follow-up. VRET contributed to a significant 
reduction  of  symptoms,  and  65.9%  of  combatants  no 
longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. However, VRET 
gave  no  optimal  treatment  outcomes  for  all  problems 
associated  with  PTSD.  Reduction  of  depression  and 
anger  was  significant,  but  none  of  the  interventions 
improved sleep, and reliable reduction of social isolation 
occurred  only  in  those  participants  who  received  group 
therapy.  Positive  effects  of  treatment  persisted  for 
6 months of follow-up.

As  a  secondary  result  of  VRET  compared  to  the 
control  group  (no  treatment),  increase  of  perceived 
social support was noted, this being one of the possible 
ways  to  reduce  PTSD  symptoms  [66].  VRET  effects 
concerned  mainly  depressive  symptoms,  with  dose–
response relationship observed: the greater the number 
of  VRET  sessions,  the  more  significant  improvement  in 
patients’  state  was  recorded.  A  sustained  reduction  of 
PTSD symptoms was demonstrated at 3 and 6 months 
after VRET course completion [67]. A meta-analysis also 
showed  that  VRET  is  more  effective  than  no  treatment 
at  all  (waiting  list  control  groups),  while  no  significant 
difference  was  found  between  VRET  and  conventional 
therapy [61].

in  VR 

However,  current  advances 

technologies 
demonstrate  their  potential  to  address  cognitive  and 
functional disorders in patients with PTSD. A key aspect 
of  the  therapeutic  process  in  VRET  is  re-experiencing 
traumatic  events  affecting  three  clusters  of  symptoms: 
freezing,  avoidance,  strong  arousal  [68].  Increasing 
attention  is  being  paid  to  VRET  effects  on  selected 
PTSD  aspects  and 
its 
effectiveness,  along  with  using  VR  to  predict  PTSD 
symptoms  development  in  veterans.  This  is  especially 
true for persons resistant to conventional therapy.

VR exposure therapy as a digital method of delivering 
therapy to war veterans was more highly rated than the 
inconsistent  results  of  cognitive-behavioral  approaches. 
Being  as  effective  as  face-to-face  delivery,  VR  reduces

disease 

VRET  was  demonstrated  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
cardiovascular 
associated  with  PTSD, 
including distant periods after treatment [59]. VRET was 
reported to be effective in distracting from fear to make 
movements  related  to  possible  pain  (kinesiophobia) 
[53, 70].

Various 

symptoms 

of  PTSD  may 

change 
inequivalently over the course of treatment. Changes in 
re-experiencing  symptoms  in  war  veterans  were  found 
to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during VRET 
[71]. When comparing PE, VRET, and untreated groups 
of  veterans  with  PTSD,  an  interdependent  change  in 
symptoms  was  shown.  The  authors  suggested  that

in  overall  PTSD  symptoms  than  imaginal  exposures  in 
VRET [72].

Compared  to  a  waiting  list  control  group  (untreated), 
VRET  showed  significantly  better  results  for  PTSD 
symptoms  and  symptoms  of  depression,  but  not 
symptoms of anxiety. Besides, no significant differences 
were  found  between  the  effectiveness  of  VRET  and 
pharmacotherapy by the end of treatment [5].

A  study  of  Loucks  et  al.  [73]  assessed  PTSD, 
depression,  and  psychophysiological  measures  of 
distress  before  treatment,  immediately  after  treatment, 
and after 3 months of follow-up. Significant improvement 
of the patients’ state was observed, and the percentage

Heterogeneity  of 

treatment  by 
response 
dynamics  of  18  baseline  variables  was  investigated 
in  two  groups  of  veterans:  with  best  response  to  PE 
and  with  best  response  to  VRET.  It  was  found  that 
significant factors of greater PTSD symptoms reduction 
in  VRET  were  age  (more  effective  in  young  people), 
no  antidepressants  taking,  more  evident  symptoms  of 
hyperarousal in PTSD and suicide risk above a minimum 
[74]. PE/VRET reduced suicidal ideation likelihood after 
treatment  [75].  Thus,  prescribing  therapy  based  on 
individual  patient  profiles  may  significantly  increase  the 
effectiveness of combat-related PTSD treatment.

A  study  of  Reger  et  al.  [76]  showed  that  anxiety 
symptoms  associated  with  simulation  in  VRET  are 
side effects of being in VR. The authors recommend to 
consider the possibility of increased anxiety levels and to 
interpret VRET results cautiously.

Stigma  and  attitudes  toward  mental  health  services 
were  assessed  before  randomization  and  after  5  and 
10  VRET  sessions.  After  therapy,  the  soldiers  showed 
a  significant  improvement  in  their  openness  to  talking 
about  mental  health  issues  compared  to  those  on  the 
waiting  list.  Reduction  of  PTSD  symptoms  and  positive 
changes  in  attitudes  toward  treatment  seem  to  predict 
reduction of stigma later on [77].

The  ability  of  trauma-related  multisensory  stimuli  to 
enhance  emotional  engagement  is  a  benefit  of  VRET 
that may be crucial to clinical outcome. When comparing 
SUDS  scores  during  the  first  imaginal  exposure  to  PE 
or  VRET,  it  was  noted  that  soldiers  with  greater  initial 
severity  of  PTSD  symptoms  had  higher  mean  or  peak 
distress.  No  differences  were  found  between  the  PE 
and  VRET  groups  in  terms  of  SUDS  at  the  first  or  last 
session,  or  in  habituation  between  sessions.  However, 
reduction  per  every  10  SUDS  units  (both  mean  and 
peak) from the beginning of the first session to the end 
of  treatment  was  associated  with  a  greater  decrease 
in  CAPS  scores 
intergroup 
differences  were  found  neither  in  these  dynamics  nor 
in  SUDS/habituation  dependence  on  severity  of  PTSD 
symptoms [78].

for  both  groups.  No 

In  a  study  of  Shulman  et  al.  [79],  part  of  active  duty 
soldiers  with  PTSD  in  the  PE  and  VRET  groups  were 
asked  to  participate  in  a  preliminary  survey  about  their 
intention  to  undergo  a  full  course  of  treatment.  Survey 
participants  were  less  likely  to  drop  out  of  the  study 
compared  to  those  who  were  not  interviewed.  The 
authors  anticipate  randomizing  this  phenomenon  in 
future clinical trials.

Temporal  relationships  between  clusters  of  PTSD 
symptoms  in  soldiers  assessed  by  clinicians  during 
treatment  using  PE,  VRET,  and  a  waiting  list  control 
state (untreated group) were studied [80]. No significant 
differences  were  found  between  PE  and  VRET  groups, 
but  compared  to  controls,  these  groups  showed  an 
earlier reduction of avoidance/stupor symptoms followed 
by a reduction of hyperarousal symptoms. The results of 
this study confirmed the effectiveness of any form of ET 
on PTSD symptoms, especially avoidance.

VR  increasing  availability  associated  with  advances 
in  mobile  device  technology  allowing  to  track  motions 
and  to  project  images  makes  VRET  a  promising  tool 
that  can  be  used  at  work,  at  home,  or  on  the  go  [81]. 
A  veteran  student  who  underwent  cell-phone  VRET 
reported  decreased  psychological  symptoms  of  social 
anxiety and improved sleep quality after completing the 
course [82].

A group of researchers led by Rizzo [24] presented a 
VR application for treatment of servicemen and veterans 
with  combat  PTSD  in  the  form  of  virtual  environment 
BraveMind  with  an  extension  of  simulations  to  14 
different  therapeutic  scenarios  for  PTSD  assessment 
and  prevention.  The  advantages  of  this  therapy  are 
interactivity,  controllability,  confidentiality,  and  possibility 
of  personal  adjustment.  This  allows  for  meaningful 
success in cases of resistant PTSD in veterans [83].

VR  exposure  therapy  is  used  as  a  tool  allowing  to 
predict  development  of  PTSD  symptoms  in  veterans 
[44]. Patients with combat PTSD, in contrast to veterans 
without  psychophysiological  arousal,  in  response  to 
combat  stimuli,  exhibited  higher  GSR  reactivity  during 
non-personalized and standardized combat presentation 
in VR, but not during peaceful events [55].

In their study, van Gelderen et al. [36] investigated the 
efficacy  of  combining  VR  with  3MDR  to  treat  veterans 
with  therapy-resistant  PTSD  (an  average  of  4  treatment 
failures in the past) compared to a control group receiving 
a  nonspecific  treatment  component.  Clinical  symptoms 
of PTSD were assessed at the beginning and at the end of 
therapy, after 12 and 16 weeks of follow-up. After 3MDR, 
there was a more evident reduction of PTSD symptoms 
severity  from  initial  level  compared  to  the  control  group. 
High  participant  engagement  was  evidenced  by  low 
dropout  rate  (7%)  with  45%  of  patients  in  the  3MDR 
group  experiencing  clinical  improvement.  However,  no 
reliable differences between the groups in the long-term 
period  are  available,  and  this  limits  the  conclusions 
about  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  technique  and 
emphasizes the need for additional tests.

themselves 

It  was  shown  that  VRET  with  arousal  control  is 
effective  to  reduce  severity  of  combat  PTSD  symptoms 
in untreated veterans in the first years after their return 
from war [3].

A  regression  meta-analysis  of  30  studies  with  1057 
participants  (including  5  PTSD  studies)  allowed  to  find 
that  larger  sample  sizes  were  associated  with  smaller 
VRET effects compared to controls [84].

Uncertainty  of  meta-analytic  evaluations  [67]  and 
insufficient  data  on  whether  digital  treatment  for  PTSD 
in military personnel and war veterans leads to the same 
results  as  face-to-face  treatment  [69]  limit  the  use  of 
VRET. Issues of risk, safety, confidentiality, and potential 
harm  (e.g.,  suicidal  tendencies,  avoidance  potential) 
also require further consideration.

It  should  be  noted  that  treatment  leads  to  PTSD 
symptoms  improvement  not  for  all  veterans  [51,  62], 
therefore  analysis  of  failure  reasons  is  needed  in  each 
case. The results obtained in combat veterans may not 
be  applicable  to  non-military  veterans  or  to  PTSD  in 
civilians (more research is needed).

Weaknesses  of  VRET  technologies  include  the  use 
of  non-validated  self-report  applications,  difficulty  and 
infrequency  of  staff  communication  with  patients  during 
PTSD  deployment,  low  severity  of  PTSD  symptoms 
throughout the study [36], and limitation of the follow-up 
period to 3–6 months. Note that some participants may 
exhibit  strong  emotional  response  during  the  study 
or  experience  side  effects  related  to  cybersickness 
[49,  etc.]  The  presence  is  highly  recommended  of  a 
second research team member observing the participant 
during sessions, other than the person operating the VR 
environment [28]. The cost of procedures should also be 
taken into account: for instance, the use of VR combined 
with  3MDR  dramatically  increases  labor  content  and 
cost of sessions.

Conclusion

The  ambiguity  of  the  results  of  VRET  studies  in 
patients  with  PTSD  results  from  relatively  small  (but 
the

variety  of  protocols  and  scenarios.  Besides,  VRET 
can  be  an  effective  alternative  to  existing  methods  and

demonstrated more successful treatment of patients with 
PTSD who did not respond to previous therapy.

The task of future studies is to find out the dynamics 
of  changes  in  PTSD  symptom  cluster  at  all  stages  of 
treatment  with  VRET  within  individual  sessions,  at  the 
end of the course, and in the long-term period.
