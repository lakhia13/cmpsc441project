Introduction: The study aimed to evaluate, both comparatively and
longitudinally, the effects of receiving services from community mental health
centers on the stigma levels of patients and relatives and the burden of care for
patients with severe mental illness.

Methods: The study was planned to be conducted on patients with severe
mental
illness [schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and bipolar disorder
(BD)] and their relatives, followed by the community mental health center (CMHC
group) and the outpatient clinic (outpatient group). It was planned to provide
psychoeducation to relatives once a month for 2 h; meetings with the case
manager at least once every 2 weeks; and psychosocial interventions (social
inclusion, daily life activities studies, etc.) and psychoeducation for 2 h once a
week for the patients. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI) was
applied to the patients; the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS) and the Self-
Stigma Inventory for Families (SSI-F) were applied to the relatives at the beginning
of the study, at the 6th and 12th month.

Results: The study was completed with 53 patients from the CMHC group
(number of patients with SSDs = 39, number of patients with BD = 14) and 60
patients from the outpatient group (number of patients with SSDs = 45, number
of patients with BD = 15). In the CMHC group, in patients with SSD, there was a
statistically signiﬁcant decrease in ISMI (p < 0.001), ZCBS (p < 0.001), and SSI-F (p
< 0.001) scores at the end of the 12th month. In the outpatient group, in patients
with SSD, there was no statistically signiﬁcant decrease in ISMI (p = 0.948), ZCBS
(p = 1.000), and SSI-F (p = 1.000) scores at the end of the 12th month. In the
CMHC group, in patients with BD, there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in
ISMI (p = 0.002), ZCBS (p < 0.001), and SSI-F (p < 0.001) scores at the end of the
12th month. In the outpatient group, in patients with BD, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant decrease in ISMI (p = 0.645), ZCBS (p = 0.166), and SSI-F (p = 0.142)
scores at the end of the 12th month.

Discussion: The results of our study suggest that multidimensional assessments
of patients and their families, efforts to promote social participation, support for
self-management in daily life, and psychoeducation may be helpful in reducing
stigma and burden.

1 Introduction

The group most stigmatized in the world are individuals with
severe mental
illnesses (SMIs) such as schizophrenia spectrum
disorders (SSDs) and bipolar disorder (BD), which have a destructive
effect on cognitive, managerial, and social skill areas, leading to loss of
abilities (1). These individuals, who experience intense stigmatization
in almost all areas of their lives, have forms of stigmatization that are
almost the same in different countries or regions (1).

In society, having a mental illness is often seen as a sign of
personal deﬁciency, weakness, deviation,
low intelligence,
unreliability, or incompetence, while it is known that individuals
with SMIs are seen as individuals with violent and unpredictable
behaviors (2, 3). The stigmatization, which can be brieﬂy deﬁned as
the existing false beliefs, negative attitudes, and behaviors towards
individuals with mental illnesses, has been shown to be widespread
in the general population, including the individuals themselves,
their families, their social environments, and among health
professionals, according to many study ﬁndings (2, 4, 5). Families,
in particular, are affected by the stigmatization their patients face
and experience feelings of blame, shame, or withdrawal, and
concealment. Common beliefs that poor parenting skills trigger
mental illnesses and the emergence of the disease as a result of the
effect of inheritance biologically cause the stigma on families to be
larger and heavier. The perception that they have a shameful feature
against society with the thought that the community will interpret
the disease of their children as a result of not being able to parent
well, not being able to be a good family, outweighs in parents.

The experience of self-stigmatization can lead to a decrease in
self-esteem in family members; to despair, helplessness, and
depression; to hiding the disease and withdrawing from social
relationships;
to deterioration in individual and familial
functionality; to an increase in burden; and to the disruption of
the treatment relationship (6). Determining the burden experienced
by the relatives of patients with schizophrenia, the factors associated
with the burden, and the initiatives made to reduce the burden is
quite important for both the patient individuals and the caregivers.
With the development of social psychiatry, societal treatments have
begun to be anticipated as a result of the mindset change in the treatment
of SMIs. Changes have been made in mental health policies for the
purpose of mental–social treatment. The ﬁrst step of these changes was

the closure of depot hospitals known as mental hospitals and the opening
of community mental health centers (CMHCs). Thus, the understanding
of the community-based model has begun to dominate the presentation
of mental health services instead of the hospital-based model with a
medical approach. In this model, which is also recommended by the
World Health Organization and is applied more and more as its
effectiveness is seen, the country is divided into service regions and
each CMHC coordinates and presents mental health services in its own
responsible region with a multidisciplinary team consisting of
psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, psychologists,
occupational therapists, and master instructors. CMHCs register
mental patients in the responsible region to the center by detecting
them and closely monitor the conditions of these patients by also making
home and workplace visits when necessary. The understanding of the
multidisciplinary team facilitates the provision of multi-faceted services.
CMHCs carry out anti-stigma studies with a multidisciplinary approach
in the ﬁeld of mental health and actively support existing studies to
increase social functionality and social wellbeing.

According to the report published by the World Health
Organization in 2022, the importance of a community-based
approach is emphasized in preventing stigmatization (7). It is seen
that the initiatives that will reduce stigmatization the most ensure that
patients socialize in the same environment as non-patients,
guaranteeing that they are employed in the same environment,
regaining their abilities to sustain their lives on their own, and even
seeing some patients working in jobs beneﬁcial to the community.
These initiatives can only be achieved in the current system with
individual and multi-faceted studies with a case manager assigned to
each patient with CMHCs. One of these studies aims to give
psychoeducation to patients and their relatives.

In studies examining the effect of psychoeducation on caregiver
burden,
it has been shown that psychoeducation reduces the
caregiver burden in both schizophrenia and mood disorders (8).
In addition, in comparative studies, it has been shown that the
quality of
life of patients and families who were given
psychoeducation increased, their family and social relations
improved, and the functionality of the patients increased (9, 10).

There are far fewer studies evaluating the effect of
psychoeducation on stigma. In studies conducted with BD, it has
been shown that functionality increases and stigma scores decrease
in patients given psychoeducation (11). In another study conducted

Frontiers in Psychiatry

Tozog˘lu and Gürbüzer

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1469448

on patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, it was
shown that stigma scores measured with the social distance scale
were lower in the group receiving psychoeducation (12).

The clinical symptoms of schizophrenia and BD often overlap.
The BD phenotype includes symptoms such as psychosis, depression,
anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunctions, which cannot
always be clearly differentiated from schizophrenia. The
“schizophrenia-trait disorder spectrum model” has been put
forward to describe this situation. Schizoaffective disorder, in which
symptoms related to both diseases coexist, and cases in which the
diagnosis changes over time constitute the common points between
the two diseases with an average rate of 20% within a spectrum (13).
Genetic, neurodevelopmental disorders and biological and
psychosocial factors are thought to be important in the etiology of
both disorders. Stress and life events may also lead to the emergence
of both disorders (13, 14). Schizophrenia and BD have many
commonalities in terms of genetic, structural, symptomatic, and
therapeutic features. Both disorders are lifelong disorders with a
high risk of suicide and prolonged symptomatic periods, and use the
health system intensively. Both disorders impose a heavy burden on
the individual, family, and society. These illnesses, which occur under
the inﬂuence of environmental factors and psychosocial stresses, are
severe mental disorders whose causes are not fully known and whose
treatment can only be partially provided (15). Considering these
common factors, both diagnostic groups were addressed in the same
study group. At the same time, in terms of stigmatization, in a study
conducted in the United Kingdom, many psychiatric diagnoses were
evaluated, and it was found that stigmatization was most common in
SSDs and most common in BD after personality disorders. It can be
said that these two disorders have similar places in the society in
terms of stigmatization (16).

We think that CMHCs, which evaluate both the patient and his/
her family/relatives more comprehensively, intervene to increase
their functionality in many areas, and also give psychoeducation,
may have positive effects on stigma on patients and their relatives.
However, when we review the literature, comparative cross-
sectional studies have been conducted on the effect of CMHC
services on stigmatization before, and no signiﬁcant positive effect
of CMHCs has been detected, and it has been commented that
designing the studies as longitudinal studies on the same patients
will give more accurate results (17).

In our study, we aimed to evaluate both comparatively and
longitudinally the effect of service receipt from the CMHC, the
applied psychosocial interventions, and the given psychoeducation
on the stigmatization levels of patients with SMI, the stigmatization
levels of their relatives, and the burden of care.

2 Methods

2.1 Ethics and consent

The research protocol was approved by the Scientiﬁc Research
Ethics Committee of Health Sciences University Erzurum Faculty of
Medicine (Erzurum, Türkiye) with the decision numbered BAEK
2023/01-01 and carried out in accordance with the Helsinki

Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained, stating that
they agreed to participate in the study and gave their consent to the
publication of all clinical and other data contained in the
manuscript from all participants and/or their court-appointed
guardians, if any.

2.2 Participants

The study was planned to be conducted on patients with SMI
who are followed by the community mental health center (CMHC
group) and the outpatient clinic (outpatient group) between June
2023 and May 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: being
between the ages of 18 and 60; having a diagnosis of SSDs and BD
made by a psychiatrist by applying SCID-5; the patient being in
remission during the study process [patients with SSDs are in the
remission phase according to Van os criteria (18); patients with BD
with a Young Mania Rating Scale ≤8 and a Hamilton Depression
Scale ≤7 for the last 6 months (19)]; the patient and the relative
having the literacy skills to understand and ﬁll out the tests; the
patient and, if any, his guardian or a relative agrees to participate in
the study; and showing that the patient’s relative does not have a
mental disorder through the application of SCID-5 by a
psychiatrist. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the patient
and the relative having mental capacity problems, having an
oncological pathology that can increase the care burden in the
patient or the relative, and not being able to maintain more than
20% of the trainings.

2.3 Study design and setting

The Erzurum Community Mental Health Center is currently
monitoring 908 patients (681 with SSDs and 227 with BD) with
severe mental disorders. The center’s staff (doctors, psychologists,
occupational therapist, nurses, social worker, and occupational
technician) have received online training, on-the-job training, and
international supervision training as part of the CMHC trainings
jointly organized by the Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organization. An occupational therapist, an occupational
technician, and a psychologist who received the training had been
working in the ﬁeld of mental health for at least 4 years; nurses and
doctors had been working in the ﬁeld of mental health for at least 10
years. Their competencies related to the training provided were
evaluated. Personnel and the work carried out were inspected twice
a year by the Ministry of Health and the Provincial Health
Directorate Mental Health Department.

Case management is being done for registered patients, their
pharmacological treatments are monitored by the doctor, and ﬁeld
studies aimed at improving abilities impaired by the effects of the
disease, especially negative symptoms, family trainings, and home/
workplace visits, are being made.

For patients who met the work criteria and agreed to participate
in the study and their primary caregiver,
in addition to the
individual psychosocial interventions of the case manager speciﬁc
to the patient’s needs, psychoeducation was planned for 1 year.

Tozog˘lu and Gürbüzer

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1469448

The case manager got to know the patient, identiﬁed their
strengths, and provided interactive guidance. Support was provided
for further education and job interviews. Course guidance was
provided, and study plans were organized to prepare for exams
for people with disabilities.

The case manager aimed to increase family functionality by
discussing duties and responsibilities within the family. Discussions
were held to improve friend relationships, if any. Alternative ways
to make friends were discussed. They were guided and supported to
participate in handicraft courses, job training courses, and cultural
clubs. On these and similar issues, the case manager worked
individually to meet the needs of the patient.

Psychoeducation lasting 2 h each month was planned for
patient relatives/caregivers; at least once every 2 weeks, individual
face-to-face meetings with the case manager and psychoeducation
lasting 2 h once a week were planned for patients. Care4Today
materials were used for psychoeducation.

Before starting the study, patients and their relatives were
informed about the study, and their written and verbal consents
were obtained. At the beginning of the study, the sociodemographic
data form was applied to the patients and the Internalized Stigma of
Mental Illness Scale (ISMI), the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale
(ZCBS), and the Self-Stigma Inventory for Families (SSI-F) were
applied at the beginning of the study, at the 6th month of follow-up,
and at the 12th month. If the patient’s relative does not meet the
criteria but the patient does, the patient was included in the training
but was not included in the study data.

To prevent bias, during the process, the scales were ﬁlled out by
a single psychiatrist who was not involved in the patients’
psychoeducation and psychosocial
interventions and did not
perform case management for any patient.

2.4 Psychosocial interventions

A care plan is created for each patient’s individual needs. In this
is reached in line with the aim and with the

plan, the goal
strategies determined.

2.4.1 Studies in the ﬁeld of occupational activities
and educational needs

A care plan was created for the occupational and educational
needs of the patients. In this context, strategies to overcome the
obstacles in meeting these needs with the work were carried out;
returning to work or school, skill development, and social
interaction studies were included in the plan.

In the community, advocacy work was carried out on behalf of
service recipients to combat discrimination and stigma that existed
and pose an obstacle to reaching the goals of education and
occupational therapy.

Advocacy was deﬁned as working with or on behalf of service
recipients to contribute to the change of policies or practices that
have a negative impact on service recipients or to access services or
resources that could not be obtained without effort.

2.4.2 Studies aimed at improving daily
life activities

It is ideal that patients meet their daily life needs independently.
Daily life activities were included in the care plan. In this context,
strong, weak, and vulnerable aspects of service recipients and
strategies to cope with them were also included in the plan.
Practical support was provided to service recipients to meet their
basic needs, if necessary, in cooperation with other community
support institutions and caregivers.

2.4.3 Social inclusion studies

Social

inclusion means that individuals fully and actively
participate in society, where they are valued and respected despite
their differences, where their basic needs are met, and where they live
with human dignity. Work is done together with service recipients to
enable them to participate in all aspects of community life and to be
able to contribute. In the care plan, studies are included to increase
social inclusion and to address the obstacles to inclusion. In this
context, strategies to reduce isolation and marginalization, strengthen
the ties of service recipients with the community, and increase their
self-conﬁdence are also included in the plan.

2.4.4 Psychoeducation

Care4 Today Healthy Living Guide was used as material for
psychoeducation (20). Care4Today is a psychoeducation program
developed for patients with schizophrenia and their families to be
used under the guidance of
trained practitioners. This
psychoeducation program mainly includes symptoms of
schizophrenia, diagn os is of schizophr enia, c auses of
schizophrenia, effects and side effects of medications, exacerbation
symptoms, crisis planning, disease management and recovery, and
coping with drugs and alcohol. In addition to psychoeducation, it is
aimed that patients lead healthier lives with modules on healthy
nutrition and shopping, physical activity and exercise, quitting
smoking, communication, relationships, and sexuality. It has been
shown that the program increases patients’ adherence to treatment
and reduces hospital stay time and treatment costs (21).

The Healthy Living Guide includes Workbooks Facilitator
Guide, Healthy Living Activities Implementation Guide, Patient
Workbooks, Healthy Living Books, and visual materials in
presentation and video format.

In the presentations, owing to the lack of information speciﬁc to
BD, additional presentations on the symptoms, diagnosis, and
causes of BD were prepared by our team and included in
the psychoeducation.

2.5 Data sources/measurement

2.5.1 Sociodemographic information form

This form is designed to evaluate the sociodemographic
information (such as age, sex, and working status) and clinical
characteristics (such as total disease duration and total number of
hospitalizations) of the participants in the study.

Frontiers in Psychiatry

04

Tozog˘lu and Gürbüzer

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1469448

2.5.2 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5
Disorders, clinician version

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) is one of the
most widely used diagnostic tools in clinical research worldwide.
The latest version is SCID-5. SCID-5, Clinician Version is a
comprehensive, standardized tool for the evaluation of major
psychiatric disorders according to the deﬁnitions and criteria of
DSM-5. This structured clinical interview includes 32 diagnostic
categories with detailed diagnostic criteria and 17 diagnostic
categories with research questions. The validity and reliability
study of the Turkish version of SCID-5, Clinician Version was
conducted (22).

2.5.3 Hamilton Depression Scale

It assesses the severity of depressive symptoms over 17 items
and on a three- or ﬁve-level dimension. It is ﬁlled out by the
clinician, and the total score indicates the severity of depression. A
score between 0 and 7 indicates absence of depression (23). In the
Turkish adaptation study, the Cronbach’s alpha value was found to
be 0.75 (24).

2.5.4 Young Mania Rating Scale

It measures core symptoms deﬁned for the manic period of BD,
each one through 11 items with ﬁve stages (from mild to severe).
The scale is ﬁlled out based on an interview taking into account the
patient’s condition in the last 48 h (25). In the Turkish validity and
reliability study of the scale, the internal consistency coefﬁcient was
found to be 0.79 (26).

2.5.5 Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale

The ISMI was developed in 2003 by Ritsher and colleagues, and
the validity and reliability study of the Turkish version was
conducted by Ersoy and Varan (2007). This self-report scale,
which evaluates internalized stigma in psychiatric patients,
consists of a total of 29 items. The scale has ﬁve subdimensions:
alienation, endorsement of stereotypes, perceived discrimination,
social withdrawal, and resistance to stigma. In the four-point Likert-
type scale, the items of the resistance to stigma subscale are scored
inversely, and an increase in the scale score indicates that the
person’s level of internalized stigma is high in a negative direction.
While the Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients for the subscales of ISMI
vary between 0.63 and 0.87, the Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient for the
entire scale is calculated as 0.93 (27).

2.5.6 Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale

2.5.7 Self-Stigma Inventory for Families

The Self-Stigma Inventory for Families (SSI-F) is a scale
consisting of 14 items and three factors, withdrawal from society,
hiding the disease, and perception of worthlessness, aimed at
evaluating self-stigmatization or internalized stigmatization in
illness. The ﬁve-point Likert-type
individuals with mental
measurement was designed as follows: “1 = does not ﬁt me at all,
2 = ﬁts a little, 3 = ﬁts moderately, 4 = usually ﬁts, 5 = ﬁts perfectly”.
As the scores obtained from the scale increase, the self-
stigmatization of the patient’s relatives increases. The Cronbach’s
alpha coefﬁcient of the scale was found to be 0.88 (30).

2.6 Statistical analysis

Analyses were conducted using the IBM SPSS 26 statistical
analysis software. The data were presented in terms of mean,
standard deviation, and count. A normality analysis was
performed to check whether the skewness and kurtosis values of
all variables fall within the range of −2 to +2. These values indicate
that the normality assumption is met (George, 2011). Since the
normal distribution condition was met, the independent samples
test was used for comparisons between two independent groups.
The chi-square test was applied for comparisons between
categorical variables.

partial

To evaluate the change in scales over time, a repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Partial eta squared
(h
2) values were given to determine the effect size. The assumption
of sphericity was evaluated with Mauchly’s Sphericity test. In cases
where the data met the assumption of sphericity, the “Sphericity” test
was used; in cases where this assumption was not met, the “Greenhouse
Geisser” test was used. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used
to analyze the mean differences between the groups.

A repeated-measures ANOVA test assessed intra-group
comparison (overall) analyses across multiple time points.
Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used to analyze the
mean differences between the groups.

Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the
correlation between scale scores. A linear regression analysis was
performed to investigate the effects of common variables in a mixed
model containing scale scores. The level of statistical signiﬁcance
was taken as p < 0.05.

3 Results

The ZCBS was developed by Zarit and colleagues in 1980. It is a
scale used to evaluate the difﬁculty experienced by caregivers
providing care to an individual in need of care. It can be ﬁlled
out by the caregiver themselves or by the researcher. The items on
the scale are generally oriented towards the social and emotional
area, and a high score on the scale indicates that the experienced
difﬁculty is high. The validity and reliability study of the scale for the
Turkish version has been conducted (28). The Cronbach’s alpha
coefﬁcient of the scale was found to be 0.95 (29).

The study started with 65 CMHC patients and an equal number
of 65 outpatient groups who met the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. However, because of the acute phase of one patient with
SSDs during the process, one BD patient being hospitalized and
treated due to a manic attack, seven patients and three patient
relatives not attending more than 20% of psychoeducations, their
data were not included in the study. From the outpatient group, two
patients with BD were removed from the study due to manic attack,
one BD patient was removed due to depressive attack, and two

patients with SSDs entering the acute phase and who were
hospitalized were removed.

The study was completed with 53 patients from the CMHC
group (number of SSDs = 39, number of BDs = 14) and 60 patients
from the outpatient group (number of SSDs = 45, number of BDs =
15). The sociodemographic data of the groups are shown in Table 1.
Skewness-kurtosis analysis was performed to evaluate whether the
data ﬁt the normal distribution. It was seen that the data ﬁt the
normal distribution.

The initial scores of the CMHC and outpatient group were
evaluated with the Student t-test (Table 1). To evaluate the change
of ISMI, ZCBS, and SSI-F scores over time, ANOVA test was
applied separately to each group. In the CMHC group, in patients
with SSDs, there was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in ISMI (F =
214,972, h
2 =
0.501, p < 0.001), and SSI-F (F = 123,523, h

The correlation of scale scores at the end of the 12th month with
each other was examined. A moderate level of signiﬁcant and
positive relationship was found between ZCBS and SSI-F total
score and subscale scores. SSI-F total scale score, ISMI total score,
and social withdrawal and perceived discrimination subscale scores
were moderately signiﬁcant and positively related. ISMI total score
and alienation, conﬁrmation of stereotypes, social withdrawal, and
perceived discrimination subscale scores showed a moderate level of
signiﬁcant and positive relationship with ZCBS scores (Table 4).

A linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the
effects of common variables in a mixed model containing ZCBS,
ISMI, and SSI-F 12th month total scale scores. According to the
analysis result, it was found that ISMI total score was effective for
ZCBS (B ± SE; 0.509 ± 0.179, p = 0.006), and in the model created
for ISMI (B ± SE; 0.283 ± 0.098, p = 0.006), ZCBS total score was
effective (Table 5).

4 Discussion

Stigmatization related to SMI is a universal problem and is
prevalent in every culture and everywhere. People living with
mental health conditions can experience stigmatization from their
families, neighbors, and health professionals (31). In addition to
this, there is also the stigma internalized by the patients. Because
people generally prefer to endure mental distress without relief,
there is a risk of discrimination and exclusion that comes with
access to mental health services. Although the symptoms of the
disease can be reduced with pharmacotherapy, negative symptoms
that are difﬁcult to control, perhaps the care burden it brings,
withdrawal from the social environment, and stigmatization cannot
be solved with pharmacotherapy. However, with the right support,
most people with serious mental health conditions can maintain
excellent relationships and be functional in many areas. Therefore,
addressing stigmatization in studies is an important responsibility.
The role of CMHCs, which carry out community-based recovery

that came to the agenda with social psychiatry, is important in this
regard. In our study, when SMI patients followed in the outpatient
clinic were compared with SMI patients followed in the CMHC;
although the initial scale scores were similar; although not in the
short term, in the long term, with the interventions applied in the
CMHC, it was shown that the levels of stigma in themselves and
their families were reduced in many areas, and the caregiver burden
in their caregivers was signiﬁcantly reduced.

While the symptoms of stigmatization can sometimes be
described as worse than the symptoms of their illness by patients
with SMI, when the literature is reviewed, it is seen that studies
aimed at reducing stigmatization and discrimination are generally
conducted by high-income countries (32–34). Studies conducted in
low- and middle-income countries are much less. In a study
conducted in China in 2018, a community-based intervention was
discussed. In the randomized, controlled, and 9-month longitudinal
study, despite the joint implementation of the program-named
strategies against discrimination and stigmatization in addition to
psychoeducation, social skills training, and cognitive-behavioral
therapy, it was shown that there was no signiﬁcant decrease in
the ISMI scores in the intervention group, but there were signiﬁcant
improvements in the scores of anticipated discrimination and
overcoming stigma compared to the control group. Only patients
with schizophrenia were included in this study, and no studies were
conducted on patients with BD. A study of community-based
interventions with 30 patients with schizophrenia and their
families was conducted in India. In the study, a model was
created that included psychoeducation (providing information
about the disease), adherence management (increasing regular
and correct use of medications through adherence strategies and
side effect management), rehabilitation (improving functional
abilities through social, vocational, and other skills training and
planning of daily activities), and referral
to community
organizations (increasing community support by increasing
knowledge and access to disability beneﬁts, employment agencies,
and social welfare organizations), as well as self-care practices,

appropriate diet and lifestyle changes, and stress and anger
management. Although many difﬁculties were encountered
during the implementation of the model, such as not reaching the
targeted number of sessions and experiences of stigmatization and
discrimination not being adequately addressed, the community-
based approach in schizophrenia has been accepted as an acceptable
and feasible approach, especially to reduce the treatment gap (35).
Again, in India, four people with SMI from a family were included
in a community-based intervention program. The main elements of
the program were home visits, one-to-one interaction, collaborative
work with local government bodies, medical intervention, social

work team interventions, social skills training and vocational
training, and psychoeducation including information-education
and communication skills. After the program, family burden and
stigma scores of patients with SMI decreased compared to before
the program. The results of the study were similar to those of our
study. It has been interpreted that community-based intervention
can provide changes in stigmatization, reduce discrimination, and
increase social acceptance and social support of family members
(36). A yearlong multicenter study similar to our study was
conducted in India to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-
based intervention for patients with schizophrenia and caregivers.

While 167 patients with schizophrenia and their families received
community-based intervention, 86 patients and their families
received only hospital care. However, unlike our study,
stigmatization was not evaluated in this study; disease severity
and disability were evaluated. At the end of 1 year, there were
signiﬁcant decreases in the scores of the positive and negative
syndrome scale and disability assessment scale in the community-
based intervention group compared to the hospital group (37). In a
study published in 2021, a 30-year evaluation of interventions to
reduce mental health stigma in India was conducted. Only nine
s t u d i e s p u b l i s h e d o n s t i g m a t i z a t i o n a n d i n c l u d i n g
pharmacotherapy interventions could be included in the review.
Only one of these studies dealt with patients with schizophrenia and
their relatives. In this review, it was suggested that social contact was
the most effective strategy to reduce mental health stigma. However,
it was also interesting that there was only one study in the review
that used social contact as part of the intervention (38). This review
also shows that there are very few studies on stigmatization and
community-based interventions, especially in underdeveloped and
developing countries. When studies conducted in our country are
examined, it is seen that most of the studies conducted in the ﬁeld of
stigma towards severe mental disorders are descriptive (5, 39, 40),
and in the studies where interventions are made, the intervention
consists of psychoeducation (11, 41); it is seen that there is no study
that integrates community-based interventions into the health
system and measures its effect longitudinally.

In our study, although not speciﬁc to stigmatization, a
psychoeducation program was implemented that included interactive
information sharing about identifying the disease, informing about its
treatment, and discussions on what can be done to reduce ﬂare-ups and
increase functionality. In addition, each patient in the CMHC group
has a case manager. The case manager ﬁrst gets to know the patient
well in all aspects. It identiﬁes the patient’s strengths and guides the
patient through interactive conversations to be able to do again what
they could do with these strengths before the disease. It is shown that
the patient can contribute to himself and life by doing what he can do
not in the CMHC environment but in the community. If he has an
interrupted education process, he is supported to continue. If necessary,
a rehearsal is made before the job interviews that need to be done for
employment purposes, and if necessary, the case manager goes to the
job interview with him. Again, for employment purposes, it directs the
patient to courses in preparation for public personnel exams for the
disabled and organizes exam study plans. If the patient is working at a
workplace, a workplace visit is made and the patient is visited while
there. It is discussed what can be done at the place where he works.
What can be done to make friends according to the patient’s location is
also discussed. While these are being discussed, patients and their
relatives are confronted with the fact that a person with any physical
illness or a person without an illness also struggles with these issues,
and while doing this, it is tried to discuss the stigmatization internalized
by the patient. Seeing that the patient is in the community also reduces
the stigma and burden brought by the disease for the patient's relatives.

been thought that positive results may not have been observed
because the studies showing the effectiveness of CMHCs on the
subject of stigmatization are generally cross-sectional comparative
studies (17). However, as in our study, when long-term individual

and group studies are conducted on the same patient and relative
and worked with a community-based logic, a decrease in
stigmatization levels in the family and patient and a decrease in
caregiver burden have been observed.

Charlene Sunkel, the founder of the Global Mental Health Peer
Network and co-chair of the Lancet Commission on Ending Stigma
and Discrimination in Mental Health, says, “If there’s one solution
to resolving stigma, it’s inclusion of people with mental health
conditions in everything—in employment, education, communities.
By including people, others can see it’s another human being,
deserving of dignity and human rights” (42). In our study, not
only did we support patients in psychoeducation, we also strived for
each patient in the CMHC group to be included in society as if they
were an individual without a mental illness. The results of our study
show that the individual and multifaceted evaluation of patients and
their relatives, working for social inclusion, enabling the patient to
manage themselves in daily life, and community-based
interventions are effective ways to reduce stigma and burden.

The effects of stigma on individuals with SMI include
perceived, experienced, anticipated, and self-stigma. Perceived
stigma is deﬁned as an individual's beliefs about the general
public's attitudes toward individuals with SMI. A study of 422
patients with SMI from a psychiatric hospital and four CMHCs in
China found that perceived public stigma was a primary condition
for individual stigma to occur (43). Experienced stigma refers to
the discrimination experienced by people with SMI. A study
conducted in the United States on 516 patients with SMI showed
that experienced stigma, but not self-esteem and self-efﬁcacy, was a
predictive factor for internalized stigma (44). Anticipated stigma—
or the expectation that a person will be discriminated against
because of their SMI—can occur even if the person has no prior
experience of discrimination and contributes to social withdrawal
and self-stigma. Self-stigma—or internalized stigma—describes
the transformation process in which a person’s previous social
identity (deﬁned by social roles such as son, sibling, friend,
employee, or potential spouse) is increasingly replaced by a
devalued and stigmatized view of the self, referred to as the
“disease identity.” In our study, we focused on the internalized
stigma that the patient has. However, other effects of stigma are
also important and should not be ignored. Future studies that
include more comprehensive studies would be valuable. Family
stigma is a stigma that arises from others' negative perceptions,
attitudes, feelings, and avoidant behaviors towards a family (and
each family member); from others' beliefs that the family's
unusualness is somehow harmful, dangerous, and unhealthy,
which may affect them negatively or is different; and from the
family's social isolation due to the illness identity of their patients.
In our study, we evaluated the families' own stigmatization, but it
may be instructive to show all these effects on family stigmatization
in more comprehensive studies.

Although there are many things that can be done publicly and
as mental health professionals in order to reduce stigmatization, we
were able to examine only one pillar of psychoeducation and
psychosocial interventions in our study (45). The most signiﬁcant

limitation of the study is that a structured program aimed at
combating self-stigmatization was not implemented in the study.
As there are studies showing the positive effect of psychosocial
struggle programs used against self-stigmatization in SSDs in
psychoeducation (46), there are also studies showing that
programs speciﬁcally applied to stigmatization have no effect (47).
Another limitation is that the Care4Today application is a program
prepared only for patients with schizophrenia. However, the fact
that schizophrenia and BD have many similar aspects both
etiologically and clinically, and that we as a team prepare BD-
speciﬁc materials and presentations for the program, partially
reduces this limitation.

The longitudinal design of the study with the same patients
constitutes a strong aspect of the study. However, there is clearly a
need for studies involving longer-term follow-up to assess whether
the initial gains are maintained or reduced and whether booster
doses of intervention are needed to sustain progress. Making
individual plans for each of the patients and their relatives,
conducting multidimensional evaluations (from the perspectives
of occupational therapists, psychologists, and doctors), and
including the family in the study are among the strengths of the
study. While most studies on community-based interventions and
stigmatization included only patients with schizophrenia, the
inclusion of patients with BD in our study makes it stand out.
The bias was eliminated by having the scales ﬁlled out by a single
psychiatrist who was not involved in the psychoeducation and
psychosocial interventions of the patients and who did not do
case management for any patients throughout the process.
However, considering the limitations we mentioned, conducting
multicenter studies in the future, including country policies and
systematic cooperation with institutions, may reveal the effect of
community-based interventions on stigma more clearly.
