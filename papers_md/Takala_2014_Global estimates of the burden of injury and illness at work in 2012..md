This article reviews the present indicators, trends, and
recent solutions and strategies to tackle major global and
country problems in safety and health at work. The article
is based on the Yant Award Lecture of the American Indus-
trial Hygiene Association (AIHA) at its 2013 Congress. We
reviewed employment ﬁgures, mortality rates, occupational
burden of disease and injuries, reported accidents, surveys on
self-reported occupational illnesses and injuries, attributable
fractions, national economic cost estimates of work-related
injuries and ill health, and the most recent information on the
problems from published papers, documents, and electronic
data sources of international and regional organizations, in
particular the International Labor Organization (ILO), World
Health Organization (WHO), and European Union (EU), in-
stitutions, agencies, and public websites. We identiﬁed and
analyzed successful solutions, programs, and strategies to
reduce the work-related negative outcomes at various levels.
Work-related illnesses that have a long latency period and are
linked to ageing are clearly on the increase, while the number
of occupational injuries has gone down in industrialized coun-
tries thanks to both better prevention and structural changes.
We have estimated that globally there are 2.3 million deaths
annually for reasons attributed to work. The biggest component
is linked to work-related diseases, 2.0 million, and 0.3 million
linked to occupational injuries. However, the division of these
two factors varies depending on the level of development. In
industrialized countries the share of deaths caused by occupa-
tional injuries and work-related communicable diseases is very
low while non-communicable diseases are the overwhelming
causes in those countries. Economic costs of work-related
injury and illness vary between 1.8 and 6.0% of GDP in
country estimates, the average being 4% according to the ILO.
Singapore’s economic costs were estimated to be equivalent to
3.2% of GDP based on a preliminary study. If economic losses
would take into account involuntary early retirement then costs
may be considerably higher, for example, in Finland up to 15%
of GDP, while this estimate covers various disorders where
work and working conditions may be just one factor of many
or where work may aggravate the disease, injury, or disorders,
such as trafﬁc injuries, mental disorders, alcoholism, and
genetically induced problems. Workplace health promotion,
services, and safety and health management, however, may
have a major preventive impact on those as well. Leadership
and management at all levels, and engagement of workers

are key issues in changing the workplace culture. Vision Zero
is a useful concept and philosophy in gradually eliminat-
ing any harm at work. Legal and enforcement measures that
themselves support companies and organizations need to be
supplemented with economic justiﬁcation and convincing ar-
guments to reduce corner-cutting in risk management, and to
avoid short- and long-term disabilities, premature retirement,
and corporate closures due to mismanagement and poor and
unsustainable work life. We consider that a new paradigm is
needed where good work is not just considered a daily activity.
We need to foster stable conditions and circumstances and
sustainable work life where the objective is to maintain your
health and work ability beyond the legal retirement age. We
need safe and healthy work, for life.

INTRODUCTION

B ased on different starting points the International Labor

Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization
(WHO), have made estimates of occupational injuries and
illnesses or burden of disease. ILO has made global estimates
from the point of view of occupational burden and WHO
from the health point of view. Both of them have come to the
conclusion that of all fatalities in industrial countries some 5–
7%(1,2) is attributed to work-related illnesses and occupational
injuries. This percentage is somewhat smaller in develop-
ing countries where non-occupational health problems have
a bigger share.(3) While new information gradually becomes
available from various sources, and when work processes,

work environment, and working populations change quanti-
tatively and qualitatively, updates of the estimates become
important. Better evidence is needed for policy and practices
in countries, companies, and organizations. This article and
related presentation provide the latest updated information for
such purposes. The article is based on the Yant Award Lecture
of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) at its
2013 Congress.

Economic cost studies related to injuries and illnesses have
been carried out using different methods. The most appro-
priate method has been the incidence approach where new
injuries, diseases, and disorders occurring in a particular year
are counted. Once this is known—e.g., by using the attributable
fraction (AF) method—all direct and indirect costs can be
calculated, including costs that are extended to the expected
total work life starting from an incidence in the year under con-
sideration. Usually long term disabilities, reduced work ability
and capacity due to partial disabilities, premature retirement
from work, and deaths cause a lion share of economic costs.
Studies and estimates by many countries and the ILO have
shown that economic costs of work-related illness and injury
would be equivalent to a range from 1.8%–6% of GDP.

The objective of this article is to provide an overall view
of the latest data and knowledge on workplace safety and
health—as yet more evidence for policy and practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

M ember states of ILO and WHO report their own statistics

regularly and these are collected, recorded, and reported
by these United Nations (UN) bodies. Reports from developed
countries are usually more comprehensive but a large number
of countries do not properly report their data on occupational
injuries and illnesses. Such missing data for occupational
injuries may be replaced by a proxy, a country, or an average
of several countries that have closely resembling economic
structures and methods of production and work cultures, and
that have reported such data well.

Occupational injuries (accidents) are followed and recorded
in many countries and the ILO, European Union (EU), and to
some extent other regional organizations collect and record
such national data. However, national systems are usually
poorly standardized and international comparisons are difﬁ-
cult. The best recorded data involves fatal injuries and this is
also the starting point for estimating the number of less severe
injuries. The methodology on establishing more comparable
estimates for occupational deaths and injuries has been de-
scribed in several papers while the methodology has gradually
been improved.(4–6)

Reliable and comparable occupational disease statistics
based on compensated cases are not available at the global
level. This lack has been compensated for by the population
attributable fractions (AF) for work-related illnesses—a wider
concept than the usually legally deﬁned term of “occupa-
tional diseases.” The AFs are commonly used to measure
the component or fraction of such illnesses and deaths that

are related to work. Those fractions have been extensively
studied in developed countries but very limited information
from developing countries exists. WHO mortality tables by
different regions provide background data and by using the
AF component as a percentage, it is possible to provide a
rough estimate of the fatalities for each disease or group of
diseases. ILO and WHO data and complementary data from
individual member states and from the EU have been used.
These data are based on latest possible sources from the years
2008–2011. Updating is done regularly.(7)

The most important AF values used by the ILO study were

as follows(8) :

(i) work-related cancer: AF = 8.4% (13.8% male, 2.2%

female) of all cancer deaths

(ii) asbestos: lung cancer and mesothelioma 12.2% (14.0%

male, 0.6% female)

(iii) external tobacco (passive) smoke, lung cancer, and
circulatory diseases: AF lung cancer = 3.0 – 2.0% m/f
(iv) circulatory system diseases: AF = 12.4% (14.4% male,

6.7% female)

(v) respiratory system diseases: AF = 4.1% (6.8% male,

1.1% female)

(vi) communicable diseases: AF = 8.8% (4.8% male, 32.5%
female, the latter being high due to occupational in-
fections in the health sector). This high AF value
was adjusted for developing countries where health
sector exposure is small compared to other exposures
in agriculture and elsewhere, such as tropical diseases,
bacteria, viruses, and vector-borne diseases.

Studies adapted by ILO for use as global estimates state that
the overall AF for work-related causes was 6.7% (2005).(5)
The AF method is widely used to assess work-relatedness of
a broad range of diseases and disorders.

These AF values have been adapted from those used orig-
inally in Finland.(9) These have been used in other parts of
the world, in particular, by ILO and in Australia,(10) New
Zealand,(11) and Alberta, Canada.(12) Estimates based on these
AF values have been reviewed to be the most representative
globally(13) so far. While somewhat different AF values have
been used, such as those by Steenland (2003),(14) new infor-
mation has come much closer to the above-mentioned AF
values used by the ILO. For example, Rushton et al.,(15) have
demonstrated that occupational cancer in the U.K. kills 8010
people annually. After this study a group from the International
Agency for the Research of Cancer (IARC), led by MacGor-
mack(16) have shown that the number of mesothelioma cases
can be used as an indication and proxy for asbestos exposures
that do cause both mesothelioma and lung cancer. The number
of deaths caused by lung cancer could be 2–10 times that
of mesothelioma. So far much lower lung cancer estimates
have been used in past studies. Asbestos alone causes 112,000
deaths annually (Takala/ILO/EU(17)) and 90,000 deaths ac-
cording to WHO(18) and Nishikawa et al.(19) A comparative list
of AF values is given in the Table I enclosed.(20)

FIGURE 1. Cost items borne by employers, workers, and the
community

The ILO has estimated that 4%% of annual global GDP,
or US$2.8 trillion, is lost due to the direct and indirect costs
of occupational accidents and diseases, including lost working
time, workers’ compensation, interruption of production, and
medical expenses.(21)

Many studies on the economic cost of workplace injuries
and diseases have been conducted. Leigh(22) estimated that the
national cost of work-related injuries and diseases in the United
States amounted to US$250 billion (1.8% of GDP). Safe Work
Australia estimated that the costs of work-related injuries
and illnesses for Australia were AU$57.5 billion (5.9% of
GDP)(23) for 2005–2006 and AU$60.6 billion (4.8% GDP) for
2008–2009.(24) The European Agency for Safety and Health at
Work made a Member State Survey on the estimated economic
costs: some results are as follows(25)
• Norway(26) 6.0% of GDP (not in the EU report)
• Sweden 4.0% of GDP
• Finland(27) 3.8% of GDP
• Italy 3.2%
• Denmark 2.7%
• New Zealand(28) 3.4% of GDP (ﬁnancial cost, not in the EU

report)

The report on New Zealand stated that only 10% of the
ﬁnancial cost is compensated and the cost of suffering and
premature death was 77% of total costs while the ﬁnancial
costs were 21% of total costs and compensated costs were 2%
of all costs.

In estimating the economic costs the Workplace Safety and
Health (WSH) Institute in Singapore reviewed the method-
ologies and cost models from different countries and global
estimates when developing a preliminary economic cost model
for Singapore. In this model, Figure 1, the Institute determined
the cost of work-related injuries and ill health that would
be borne by employers, workers, and the community. Cost
items linked to staff turnover, training of replacement workers,
loss of worker output, insurance premiums, and legal costs

incurred were computed as costs borne by employers. The
costs borne by workers included expenses beyond those cov-
ered by compensation for medical treatment, rehabilitation,
and loss of future earnings. Cost items like social payouts,
costs of investigation, inspection, and promotion activities,
and loss of human capital for fatal cases and medical subsidy
were considered as costs borne by community. The adopted
incidence model does not take into account the cost from
property damage and human pain and suffering.

RESULTS

G lobally 2.3 million deaths take place(29) due to occupa-

tional injuries (318,000 deaths) and work-related dis-
eases (2,022,000 deaths) annually, see Figure 2. The biggest
killers are work-related cancer (32%); work-related circulatory
diseases (23%), cardiovascular and stroke; communicable dis-
eases (17%), in particular, in developing countries and farm-
ing, and occupational accidents (18%). The last two causes,
however, are less common in the established market economy
countries (see Figure 3). The main reason for the difference
is that the overall number of communicable diseases has been
relatively low in high-income countries, and that pattern seems
to continue also in rapidly developing countries such as China.
However, while there has been a clear long-term declining
trend for occupational injuries, in global terms this has been
offset by the increase in occupational injury fatalities due to
shifting of manufacturing, construction, mining, and agricul-
ture in rapidly industrially progressing countries, in particular
Asian countries.

While industrialized economies have gained through better
leadership, management, and cultures and reduced the number
of industrial injuries, another major part of the gain is caused by
the gradual move of hazardous industries to Asia. Furthermore,
in many high-income countries that positive development has
become increasingly difﬁcult to continue. Fatal injuries have
stagnated and another quantum leap or paradigm change is
required.

Today, occupational injuries form a small part of the mor-
tality of high-income countries, the goal posts for preven-
tion of risks are moving, and new disorders are becoming
more important. Long-term latency disorders continue to grow
and cause fatalities—for example lung cancer and circulatory
diseases—and long-term absences caused by musculoskeletal
disorders and psychosocial factors. These are ranked as major
problems by enterprises and organizations in economic sectors
employing a large number of people. These are ranked as major
problems by enterprises and organizations in economic sectors
employing a large number of people, such as government and
municipal workers, health and education sectors.

Competitiveness and safety and health go hand-in-hand; the
lower the number of accidents the higher is the competitiveness
and productivity. Figure 4 illustrates the link between com-
petitiveness as measured by the World Economic Forum(30)
in 2013, and total accident rates using data reported to the
ILO.(6) While ILO data are from the year 2008, the total

global numbers have not changed radically from the past. The
United States had 96,000 fatal work-related diseases and 5,300
fatal occupational injuries including an adjustment for under
reporting, while the competitiveness ranking was the highest
in the world in 2008; today the United States is ranked seventh.
Canada had 11,330 fatal work-related illnesses and 479 fatal
occupational injuries and its competitiveness ranking today is
12.

Regions follow WHO Regions except for the high-income
countries and EU27 that are separately covered and excluded
from corresponding WHO Regions in Table II.

High-income countries are listed in Table III.
The only region or group where the level of accident re-
porting is relatively close to expected numbers is the group
of high-income countries. In contrast, most other regions have
low levels of reporting. This will also provide a false picture
to decision makers believing that there is no reason to be wor-
ried. This in turn will become not only an economic obstacle
to increasing competitiveness and productivity but will con-
tinue to increase pressures for basic human rights. No country
has shown a high level of competitiveness and productivity
while maintaining poor safety records. Such links exist for

companies and organizations as well while small- and medium-
sized enterprises may not have ﬁrsthand feedback of poor
working conditions in the form of accidents that are statisti-
cally not common in smaller populations.

The EU data related to occupational injuries have been
separately studied by Eurostat through a self-reported injury
and illness survey in all EU Member States. The result of
this study concluded that in the EU27 there were 7 million
occupational injuries, or 3.2% of the workforce, in 2007.(31)
This validated perfectly the ILO estimate, mentioned previ-
ously, that arrived at 7.37 million occupational injuries based
on ILO data from 2008, data collection must have been earlier
than that. On the other hand 8.6% of workers in the EU-

27 experienced a work-related health problem in the past 12
months, which corresponds to 20 million workers.

Economic costs in Singapore

The estimated cost in Singapore was equivalent to 3.2%
of the Singapore GDP in 2011. This is comparable to similar
studies done by other countries, e.g., Australia (4.8%) and the
ILO (4%). Workers bore about half of these costs (51%) while
the rest is shouldered by employers (22%) and the community
(27%).

The circumstances in Singapore reﬂect those of other highly
developed countries. As a result of having overcome most com-
municable diseases as a cause of death, the relative importance

of non-communicable diseases and disorders is constantly
increasing. Some diseases that have a clear linkage to work are
work-related cancers, circulatory diseases, chronic respiratory
diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychosocial factors
at work, among others.

As a whole the magnitude of economic costs in any country
and region is radically different from those of the activities
targeted to prevention. Figure 5 demonstrates the imbalance
between safety and health action and costs of work-related
injuries and illnesses including those caused by absenteeism
and involuntary early retirement in the EU.(32) The calculations
are based on expenditure calculations by Ahonen(33) in Finland
and adapted by authors of this article.

DISCUSSION: TRENDS, STRATEGIES,
AND SOLUTIONS

T aking into account the risks involved and the fact that

both traditional and new and emerging risks need to be
studied, new innovations and solutions need to be identiﬁed.

Singapore, based on models in the United States and elsewhere,
has decided to concentrate on two aspects:

1. Establishing a Research Agenda setting priorities for
the continuous search for evidence for policy and prac-
tice(34)

2. Building a Risk Observatory or Observatory for Work-

place Landscape (OWL).(35)

Often perceptions drive action more than real evidence and it is
important to highlight the difference between media interest,
public attention, and real evidence for policy and practice.
Media, including social media, are vital for communication,
for reaching large number of stakeholders, workers, small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the informal sector,
migrant workers, and vulnerable groups, and to foster a safety
culture at places of work. Figure 6 illustrates, however, that
misperceptions in assessing risks exist. In particular statistical
risks are not easy to assess correctly. Further, common every-
day risks are underestimated and complicated technologically
and risks not easily controlled by individuals are overrated.

Leadership, management, and systems thinking at all lev-
els(36) and related worker engagement have been identiﬁed
as key for efforts to ensure workplace safety and health.(37)
Recent experiences from mega-projects such as the London
Olympics construction effort were successful exactly because
of emphasis on and continuous follow-up of these factors.(38)
The numbers presented in Tables I and II are alarmingly
high and often poorly understood, and their importance has
been underestimated. One should also keep in mind that the
targets or “goal posts” are gradually moving due to changes
in work, workplace, and work force. A systems approach is
necessary at all levels. An enterprise management system is
the strategic component for an organization,(39) but an action
program for risk assessment and priority setting for risk man-
agement is also needed. Collaboration between management
and workers at the organizational (enterprise) level must be
followed by a national-level mechanism, such as a tripartite
advisory council, that looks after wider issues like new legal
measures and better strategic enforcement. Contrary to some
perceptions enforcement supports employers in reducing in-
juries and injury claims, and saving compensation costs, on
average 26% or US$355,000, as a result of inspection of
the company, and saving employers US$6 billion nationwide.
This counts neither the costs of lost production of the injured
workers nor the pain and suffering.(39,40)

Several key processes have been gaining momentum, such
as design for safety, and control banding based on the new
Globally Harmonized System for Classiﬁcation and Labelling
of Chemicals (GHS) labelling requirements. One groundbreak-
ing and new longer-term concept, or philosophy, is Vision
Zero. The idea is to change the values and mindset of all
stakeholders from business as usual and ensure zero accidents,
zero illnesses, zero exposures, zero violence, zero harassment,
simply zero harm during an entire working life as the ultimate
goal. So far it has been launched for selected special needs
already, such as the Swedish trafﬁc vision.(41)

CONCLUSION

K Key action programs should concentrate on ﬁnding so-

lutions and reducing exposures for illnesses that have a
long latency period. For each injury and illness there are many
factors with inﬂuence on the negative outcomes. Cultures that
start from committed and capable leadership in the organiza-
tion need to be developed and presently known best practices
as well as new innovations at an organization and country
levels need to be identiﬁed and used. In addition to laws,
enforcement, and health and safety services, media including
social media should be better used for promotion of safety,
health, and well-being at work.

Occupational injuries and work-related diseases and disor-
ders are a bigger problem than estimated earlier. Longer-term
risks are gradually increasing in importance at workplaces. A
toolbox comprising: (i) legal measures, (ii) enforcement, (iii)
knowledge and solutions, (iv) incentives, (v) awareness rais-
ing and campaigns, (vi) services available to enterprises and

organizations such as occupational health services, and (vii)
networking for best exchange of good practice is vital for any
successful strategy for safety, health, and well-being at work.
A comprehensive toolbox model is the ILO Convention
no.187 on the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety
and Health.42 Safe work, healthy work is all about decent work,
good work, for life.

In the words of the former Secretary General of the United
Nations, Koﬁ Annan: “Health and safety at work is not just
sound economic policy it is a basic human right.”
