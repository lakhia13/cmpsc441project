HIGHLIGHTS 
•  This  review  summarizes 
the  current  evidence  on  the 
effects  of  EMDR  for 
depression. 
•  Findings  show  that  one- 
third  of  people  with 
depression  could  benefit 
from  EMDR. 
•  EMDR  could  be  considered 
as  an  alternative  to  first-line 
treatments  for  depression, 
pending  further  research. 

ABSTRACT
Background:  In  recent  years,  eye  movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  has 
been  applied  to  different  psychiatric  conditions  beyond  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD),  and  an  increasing  number  of  studies  have  evaluated  its  effect  on  depression.  To 
date,  no  quantitative  synthesis  of  the  efficacy  of  EMDR  on  depression  has  been conducted.
Objective:  To  meta-analytically  review  the  studies  on  EMDR  for  depression  as  the  primary 
target  for  treatment.
Method: Studies with a controlled design evaluating the effect of EMDR on depression were 
searched  on  six  electronic  databases  (PubMed,  Embase,  CINAHL,  PsycINFO,  Cochrane  data-
base,  and  Francine  Shapiro  Library)  and  then  selected  by  two  independent  reviewers. 
A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  was  conducted.
Results:  Eleven  studies  were  included  for  qualitative  synthesis.  Nine  studies  were  included 
in  the  meta-analysis,  involving  373  participants.  The  overall  effect  size  of  EMDR  for  depres-
sive  symptoms  is  large  (n  =  9,  Hedges’  g  =  –  1.07;  95%CI  [–1.66;  –  0.48]),  with  high 
heterogeneity  (I2  =  84%),  and  corresponds  to  a  ‘number  needed  to  treat’  of  1.8.  At  follow- 
up  (range  3–6  months),  the  effect  remains  significant  but  moderate  (n  =  3,  Hedges’ 
g = – 0.62; 95%CI [–0.97; – 0.28]; I2  = 0%). The effect of EMDR compared with active controls 
is  also  moderate  (n  =  7,  g  =  –  0.68;  95%CI  [–0.92;  –  0.43];  I2  =  0%).  No  publication  bias  was 
found,  although  the  results  are  limited  by  the  small  number  and  poor  methodological 
quality  of  the  included  studies.
Conclusions: Review findings suggest that EMDR may be considered an effective treatment 
for improving symptoms of depression, with effects comparable to other active treatments. 
However,  findings  need  to  be  interpreted  in  light  of  the  limited  number  of the  studies  and 
their  quality.  Further research is  required  to understand  the  longer-term of effects  EMDR  in 
treating  depression  and  preventing  depression  relapse.

Desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimientos oculares para la 
depresión:  una  revisión  sistemñtica  y  meta-análisis
Antecedentes: En los últimos años, la desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimientos 
oculares (EMDR) se ha aplicado a diferentes condiciones psiquiátricas más allá del trastorno 
de estrés postraumático (TEPT), y un número creciente de estudios ha evaluado su efecto en 
la depresión. Hasta la fecha, no se ha realizado ninguna síntesis cuantitativa de la eficacia de 
la  EMDR  en  la  depresión.
Objetivo:  Revisar  meta-analíticamente  los  estudios  de  EMDR  para  la  depresión  como 
objetivo  principal  del  tratamiento.
Método:  Se  buscaron  estudios  con  un  diseño  controlado  que  evaluaran  el  efecto  de  la 
EMDR  en  la  depresión  en  seis  bases  de  datos  electrónicas  (PubMed,  Embase,  CINAHL, 
PsycINFO, base de datos Cochrane y Francine Shapiro Library) y luego fueron seleccionados 
por  dos  revisores  independientes.  Se  realizó  una  revisión  sistemática  y  un  metanálisis.
Resultados:  Se  incluyeron  once  estudios  para  la  síntesis  cualitativa.  Se  incluyeron  nueve 
estudios  en el meta-análisis,  con  373  participantes. El tamaño del efecto  global de  la EMDR 
para  los  síntomas  depresivos  es  grande  (n  =  9,  g  de  Hedges  =  −1,07;  IC  del  95%  [−1,66; 
−0,48]), con  alta heterogeneidad  (I2  = 84%), y corresponde  a un ‘número necesario  a tratar’ 
de  1,8.  En  el  seguimiento  (rango  3-6  meses),  el  efecto  sigue  siendo  significativo  pero 
moderado  (n  =  3,  g  de  Hedges  =  −0,62;  IC  del  95%  [−0,97;-0,28];  I2  =  0%).  El  efecto  del 
EMDR en comparación con los controles activos también es moderado (n  = 7,  g  = −0,68; IC 
del  95%  [−0,92;-0,43];  I2  =  0%).  No  se  encontró  ningún  sesgo  de  publicación,  aunque  los

resultados  están  limitados  por  el  pequeño  número  y  la  pobre  calidad  metodológica  de  los 
estudios  incluidos.
Conclusiones:  Los  resultados  de  la  revisión  sugieren  que  la  EMDR  puede  considerarse  un 
tratamiento eficaz para mejorar los síntomas de la depresión, con efectos comparables a los 
de  otros  tratamientos  activos.  Sin  embargo,  los  hallazgos  deben  interpretarse  a  la  luz  del 
número  limitado  de  los  estudios  y  su  calidad.  Se  requiere  investigación  adicional  para 
comprender  los  efectos  a  largo  plazo  de  la  EMDR  en  el  tratamiento  de  la  depresión  y  la 
prevención  de  la  recaída  de  la  depresión.

1. Introduction

Depression is widespread in the world with a prevalence 
that ranges between 2.6% (among males in the Western 
Pacific Region) and 5.9% (among females in the African 
Regions), with a peak in late adulthood and a higher rate 
for  women  than  for  men  (World  Health  Organization, 
2017). This disease impacts on people’s quality of life and 
functioning.  In  this  regard,  in  2017  the  World  Health 
Organization  identified  depression  as  one  of  the  major 
causes of reduced life years due to mortality and disabil-
ity (James et al., 2018). According to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  5th  Edition 
(DSM-5), depression assumes clinical relevance when it 
leads  to  significant  distress  or  impairment  in  social, 
occupational,  or  other  important  areas  of  functioning 
and  meets  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  an  episode  of 
major  depressive  disorder 
(American  Psychiatric 
Association, 2013).

The treatment of depression has greatly evolved over 
the last few years and there are now various therapeutic 
options that combine pharmacology and psychotherapy 
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2009, 
2018).  However,  less  than  half  of  the  treated  patients 
(Johnston,  Powell,  Anderson,  Szabo,  &  Cline,  2019) 
show  a  positive  response 
therapy  (i.e. 
a reduction in depressive symptoms) and, although the 
introduction of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has 
allowed  a  doubling  of  the  percentage  of  responders 
(Hofmann  et  al.,  2014),  recurrence  rates  at  1  and 
2  years  remain  high  at  29%  and  54%,  respectively 
(Vittengl, Clark, Dunn, & Jarrett, 2007).

to  drug 

for 

to  50% 

Among  the  main  risk  factors  for  depression,  trau-
matic events play a crucial role. This seems particularly 
evident when considering that psychiatric patients show 
an  89.9%  prevalence  of  early  traumatic  experiences 
compared 
the  general  population 
(Schalinski et al., 2016). The causal relationship between 
traumatic events and the onset of a depressive disorder 
is complex and has yet to be fully outlined. However, it 
is  likely  that  the  impact  of  traumatic  experiences  is 
mediated by an individual’s epigenetic, immunological, 
endocrine (Caldji et al., 1998; Huot, Plotsky, Lenox, & 
McNamara, 2002; Ladd et al., 2000; Liu, 1997; Meaney 
et  al.,  1996;  Plotsky  &  Meaney,  1993),  neurobiological 
(Andersen  et  al.,  2008;  Davey,  Yücel,  &  Allen,  2008; 
Ernst,  Pine,  &  Hardin,  2006)  and  psychological  mod-
ifications  (Aldao,  Nolen-Hoeksema,  &  Schweizer, 
2010a;  Courtney,  Kushwaha,  &  Johnson,  2008;  Crow, 
Cross, Powers, & Bradley, 2014; Maciejewski & Mazure, 
2006;  Wright,  Crawford,  &  Del  Castillo,  2009). 
Exposure to adverse events during childhood and ado-
lescence  is  not  only  a  significant  risk  factor  for  devel-
oping  a  depressive  disorder  but  also  influences  the 
course, prognosis, and response to treatments. Indeed, 
this  exposure  has  been  shown  to  be  one  of  the  main 
factors in recurrence, persistence, and resistance to the 
treatment of depression (Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012; 
Nelson,  Klumparendt,  Doebler,  &  Ehring,  2017). 
Furthermore, it seems to increase the individual sensi-
tivity  of  the  disorder  to  psychotherapeutic  interven-
tions,  which  in  these  cases  are  more  effective  than 
drug therapy (Nemeroff et al., 2003). Relying on these 

findings,  some  authors  proposed  considering  trauma- 
associated  depression  as  a  particular  subtype,  which 
would  require  a  different  approach  compared  to  the 
traditional  one  proposed  by  the  guidelines  (Minelli 
et  al.,  2019;  Nanni  et  al.,  2012;  Nelson  et  al.,  2017; 
Paterniti, Sterner, Caldwell, & Bisserbe, 2017).

Eye  movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing 
(EMDR)  is  a  first-choice  therapy  in  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (PTSD)  and  is  based  on  the  adaptive 
information  processing  (AIP)  model  proposed  by 
Shapiro  (Shapiro,  2018).  Such  a  model  proposes  the 
influence  of  dysfunctional  memories  that  have  not 
been completely processed underlying various psychia-
tric disorders (such as PTSD, mood disorders, chronic 
pain,  and  drug  addiction).  These  memories  could  be 
triggered by internal or external stimuli, thus assuming 
an  intrusive  nature  and  accompanying  appearance  of 
PTSD symptoms and other disorders (Hase et al., 2018). 
According  to  Barry  and  collaborators  (Barry,  Naus  & 
Rehm, 2006), dysfunctional memories are characterized 
by  a  lack  of  ‘memory  awareness’  as  a  consequence  of 
their incomplete processing. EMDR therapy targets this 
lack  of  awareness  by  reprocessing  such  pathogenic 
memories with the use of alternate bilateral stimulations 
(e.g.  eye  movements),  thus  enabling  their  transforma-
tion and integration into already existing semantic links 
(Hase, Balmaceda, Ostacoli, Liebermann, & Hofmann, 
2017; Solomon & Shapiro, 2008).

shown 

that  EMDR  could  contribute 

Recently, a specific EMDR therapy protocol for the 
treatment of depressive disorders (DeprEND®) has been 
published  (Hofmann  et  al.,  2016).  Research  findings 
have 
to 
a  significant  reduction  of  depressive  symptoms  asso-
ciated with PTSD when compared to waitlist/usual care 
or  non-trauma-focused  CBT.  However,  these  findings 
are  supported  by  very  low-quality  evidence  (Bisson, 
Roberts,  Andrew,  Cooper,  &  Lewis,  2013;  Cuijpers, 
van Veen, Sijbrandij, Yoder, & Cristea, 2020).

Moreover, in recent years EMDR has been applied 
to  the  treatment  of  psychiatric  disorders  beyond 
PTSD, such as depression, although it is not currently 
recommended by the guidelines (Cuijpers et al., 2020; 
Valiente-Gómez et al., 2017). Therefore, it is essential 
to  determine  whether  EMDR  is  an  evidence-based 
treatment  for  depression.

Previous  reviews  addressing  this  topic  have  been 
published (Carletto et al., 2017; Malandrone, Carletto, 
Hase,  Hofmann,  &  Ostacoli,  2019;  Wood  &  Ricketts, 
2013),  suggesting  the  potentiality  of  EMDR  for 
depression but also highlighting the paucity of meth-
odologically  sound  studies  conducted  until  then.  As 
other  studies  have  been  conducted  in  recent  years, 
including  some  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs), 
the present systematic review and meta-analysis aims 
to  update  and  add  a  quantitative  analysis  on  the 
efficacy  of  EMDR  for  the  treatment  of  depression.

2. Methods

2.1. Protocol  registration

The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO 
repository  (CRD42018090086).  The  original  protocol 
recorded  on  PROSPERO  has  undergone  some  varia-
tions.  In  particular,  the  search  has  been  updated  and 
the meta-analysis focused on depression considered as 
a primary diagnosis and outcome.

The systematic review and meta-analysis was carried 
out following the PRISMA statement and the PRISMA 
checklist  (Moher,  Liberati,  Tetzlaff,  &  Altman,  2010) 
and  it  was  drafted  following  the  Cochrane  Handbook 
Guidelines (Higgins et al., 2019).

2.2. Search  strategy  for  identification  of  studies

Searches  were  conducted  in  the  following  databases 
on  30  September  2020:  PubMed,  Embase,  CINAHL, 
PsycINFO  and  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of 
Controlled  Trials.  Moreover,  we  performed  a  search 
with  the  keyword  ‘depress’  in  the  Francine  Shapiro 
Library,  which  is  an  online  compendium  of  confer-
ence  presentations,  scholarly  articles,  and  other 
important  grey  literature  related  to  EMDR.  From 
selected studies, cross-references were checked manu-
ally (see Supplementary Material S1 for details of the 
search  strategy).

2.3. Eligibility  criteria

2.3.1. Design
We  included  studies  with  a  controlled  trial  design, 
either  randomized  or  not.  No  year  or  language 
restrictions were  applied.

2.3.2. Population
Trials included patients of any age with depression as 
a  primary  diagnosis  and  primary  outcome  of  the 
study.  Depression  is  defined  as  either  major  depres-
sive  disorder  or  depressive  symptoms  (above  or 
below  a  predefined  cut-off  on  the  questionnaires 
employed  in  each  study).  There  was  no  restriction 
by  concurrent  organic disease.

Intervention  and  comparison

2.3.3.
We included studies that evaluated EMDR intervention 
alone  or  in  addition  to  another  treatment  in  compar-
ison  with  no  intervention,  waiting  list,  treatment  as 
usual,  or  other  types  of  intervention  (e.g.  antidepres-
sant medication, CBT, psychodynamic therapy).

2.3.4. Outcome
We included studies with depression as a primary out-
come.  Studies  were  supposed  to  include  quantitative 
data on depressive scores, as measured by standardized 

4

psychometric scales, before and after the intervention/s. 
Finally,  in  order  to  be  included  in  the  meta-analysis, 
studies  also  had  to  provide  enough  data  to  calculate 
effect sizes.

2.4. Data  collection  and  analysis

2.4.1. Study  selection  and  appraisal
Two  authors  (S.C.  and  F.M.)  independently  con-
ducted  standardized  assessments  to  determine  study 
eligibility  according  to  the  inclusion  criteria.  They 
screened  the  abstracts  and  then  retrieved  and  ana-
lysed  the  full  texts  for  all  material  deemed  relevant. 
Any  disagreement  was  discussed  with  a  third  author 
(L.O.)  before  agreement  was  reached.

2.4.2. Data  extraction
Data  from  the  selected  studies  were  inserted  into 
a standard template by two independent researchers (S. 
C.  and  F.M.).  Extracted  data  covered  publication  year, 
publication  type,  language,  study  design,  population, 
primary  diagnosis,  sample  size  (for  both  experimental 
and control groups), duration and type of intervention, 
duration  and  type  of  comparator,  depression  measure 
and length of follow-up. Article authors were contacted 
via email for missing information.

2.4.3. Risk  of  bias  in  individual  studies
The  internal  validity  of  the  RCTs  was  assessed  using 
Version  2  of  the  Cochrane  risk-of-bias  tool  for  ran-
domized  trials  (RoB  2)  (Sterne  et  al.,  2019),  which 
consists  of  five  domains  (randomization  process, 
deviations  from  intended  interventions,  missing  out-
come data, measurement of the outcome, selection of 
the reported result) and a categorization of the overall 
risk  of  bias.  Risk  of  bias  of  controlled  studies  was 
assessed  using  the  MINORS  scale  (Slim  et  al.,  2003; 
Zeng  et  al.,  2015).  For  all  included  studies,  quality 
was  also  assessed  using  the  platinum  standard  (PS) 
(Hertlein  &  Ricci,  2004),  which  was  specifically 
designed to evaluate effectiveness in EMDR research. 
Assessment  of  the  risk  of  bias  was  made  by  two 
independent coders (S.C. and F.M.) and any disagree-
ments  were  discussed  and  resolved  with  a  third 
reviewer  (L.O.).

2.4.4. Summary  measures
For each study, the mean change from baseline (post- 
score  –  baseline  score)  was  computed.  Because  the 
included  studies  used  different  scales  for  measuring 
depression,  effect  sizes  were  computed  as  the  stan-
dardized mean difference based on Hedges’ g method 
(Hedges & Olkin, 1985). Moreover, as the correlation 
coefficient  between  the  post-  and  baseline  scores  is 
needed for computing the standard error, the value of 
0.7  was  assigned, as  suggested  by  Rosenthal  (1991).

The  DerSimonian  and  Laird  random-effects 
model  was  used  to  pool  estimates  across  studies 
(DerSimonian  &  Laird,  1986).  Average  effect  size 
and  95%  confidence  interval  (95%CI)  were  com-
puted  using  the  Jackson  method.  The  number 
needed  to  treat  (NNT)  was  calculated  with  the  for-
mulae  provided  by  Kraemer  and  Kupfer  (2006).  To 
estimate  heterogeneity  between  studies,  Cochran’s 
Q  test  and  the  Higgins  I2  statistic  were  used. 
Similarly,  subgroup  analyses  were  carried  out  using 
random-effects  models  by  considering  the  risk  of 
bias.  The  extent  to  which  different  treatment  doses 
affect  the  effect  size  was  examined  by  applying 
a  univariate  meta-regression.  To  identify  influential 
studies  that  resulted  in  variation,  a  sensitivity  ana-
lysis was carried out using GOSH (graphical display 
of  study  heterogeneity)  plots,  which  fit  the  same 
meta-analysis  model  for  all  the  possible  study  com-
binations and look for specific patterns by perform-
ing  clustering  with  k-means,  DBSCAN  (density- 
based  spatial  clustering  of  applications  with  noise) 
and  Gaussian  mixed  models  (Olkin,  Dahabreh,  & 
Trikalinos,  2012).  Publication  bias  was  examined 
by  visual  inspection  of  funnel  plots  and  using 
Egger’s  test  (Egger,  Smith,  Schneider,  &  Minder, 
1997).  Analyses  were  carried  out  using  R  version 
3.6.1  (R  Development  Core Team,  2019).

3. Results

3.1. Study  selection  and  study  characteristics

The  PRISMA  flowchart  describing  the  selection  pro-
cess,  including  reasons  for  exclusion,  is  presented  in 
Figure  1.  The  search  retrieved  11  studies:  10  articles 
on  adult  patients  and  one  on  adolescents  (Table  1). 
Meta-analysis  included  9  studies,  as  two  studies  (Lei 
&  Zhen-Ying,  2007;  Tang  et  al.,  2015)  was  excluded 
due  to  there  being  no  usable  data  for  calculating  the 
effect  sizes.

The  meta-analysis  involved  373  participants,  with 

177  allocated  to  EMDR  treatment  and  196  controls.

Ten studies were published in journals and one was 
a  PhD  dissertation  thesis.  All  except  one  were  in 
English.  The  first  published  study  dates  back  to  2007 
and the last in 2020. Regarding the study design, eight 
studies  were  RCTs  and  three  were  controlled  studies 
(CS). None of the studies included patients with a PTSD 
diagnosis.  The  presence  of  traumatic  experiences  was 
considered as an inclusion criterion in only one of the 
studies (Minelli et al., 2019), whereas in the other stu-
dies it was assessed among other variables. Concerning 
the use of medication, one study considered it to be an 
exclusion criterion, one study reported no information, 
and nine studies chose to keep stable or not exclude the 
use  of  antidepressants.  In  five  studies,  the  efficacy  of 
investigated  as  an  add-on  to  other 
EMDR  was

psychotherapies, medications, or psychoeducation, and 
six studies compared EMDR as a stand-alone treatment. 
When  EMDR  was  investigated  as  a  stand-alone  treat-
ment, two studies compared EMDR with a waiting list/ 
no treatment control group, whereas four studies com-
pared EMDR with an active control. Among the latter, 
all  studies  compared  EMDR  with  CBT.  The  average 
amount of EMDR therapy administered is 16.97 hours 
(SD = 16.53) and the average amount of control treat-
ment is 19.08 hours (SD = 15.94). Although six studies 
planned a follow-up evaluation, only four studies pro-
vided data for including in the meta-analysis.

3.2. Risk  of  bias  within  studies

The risk of bias for each study is reported in Table 2 
and Figure S2. Eight RCTs were assessed with RoB 2. 
The  quality  of  the  included  studies  was  not  optimal: 
the overall risk of bias was rated as low in only 22.2% 
of  the  studies.  The  major  issues  identified  were 
related  to  deviation  from  the  intended  intervention, 
in  particular  the  lack  of  intention-to-treat  analysis 
and  inadequate  reporting  of  allocation  concealment.

The three controlled studies showed a high risk of 
bias, mainly related to missing methodological infor-
mation.  Quality  assessment  according  to  the  PS  is 

reported  in  Supplementary  Material  S3.  The  total  PS 
score  for  each  study  ranged  from  6.5  to  11.5  (max-
imum of 13), with a mean of 8.73 (SD = 1.63). Almost 
all  studies  were  judged  to  have  clearly  defined  target 
symptoms,  reliable  and  valid  measures  and  used 
a  control  or  comparison  group.  Moreover,  almost 
all  studies  reported  the  level  of  therapist(s)  training 
and  applied  a  manualized,  replicable,  specific  EMDR 
treatment. The lowest PS scores are mainly related to 
not  reporting  information  regarding  the  assessors’ 
training, effect size and  level of treatment adherence. 
Finally,  in  only  two  studies  was  the  treatment  length 
11  or  more  sessions,  which  is  considered  the  thresh-
old to achieve an effect according to the PS guidelines 
(Hertlein  &  Ricci,  2004).  Overall,  the  PS  scores  were 
largely  consistent  with  the  judgement  of  risk  of  bias 
provided  by  RoB  2/MINORS.

3.3. Synthesis  of  results

The  forest  plot  of  the  overall  effect  of  EMDR  is 
reported  in  Figure  2.  EMDR  results  in  a  large  sig-
nificant  effect  on  depressive  symptoms  (n  =  9, 
Hedges’  g  =  –  1.07;  95%CI  [–1.66,  –  0.48]),  with 
high heterogeneity (I2  = 84%). The effect size corre-
sponds  to  an  NNT  of  1.8.  Exclusion  of  one  outlier

resulted  in  a  smaller  but  still  moderately  significant 
effect size for post-treatment (n = 8, g = – 0.75; 95% 
CI  [–0.99,  –  0.50],  NNT  =  2.5;  forest  plot  S5),  with 
low heterogeneity (I2  = 2%). At follow-up, the effect 
is  still  significant  (n  =  3,  g  =  –  0.62;  95%CI  [–0.97, 
–  0.28];  forest  plot  S6)  with  no  heterogeneity 
(I2  =  0%).  As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  3,  low-quality 
studies  showed  a  higher  effect  size  than  those  of 
high  quality.  Considering  only  the  latter,  EMDR 
showed  a  moderate  effect  (n  =  2,  g  =  –  0.75;  95% 

CI  [–1.13,  –  0.37])  with  no  heterogeneity  (I2  =  0%; 
Figure  3).  The  effect  of  EMDR  was  compared  with 
an  active  control  group  in  seven  studies,  showing 
a  moderate  effect  (n  =  7;  g  =  –  0.68;  95%CI  [–0.92, 
–  0.43];  forest  plot  S7)  with  no  heterogeneity 
(I2  =  0%).  In  three  studies,  EMDR  was  compared 
to  CBT,  resulting  in  a  still  significant  moderate 
effect  size  (n  =  3,  g  =  –  0.68;  95%CI  [–1.03, 
–  0.33];  forest  plot  S8)  with  no  heterogeneity 
(I2  =  0%).  In  four  studies,  EMDR  was  an  add-on  to

treatment,  showing  a  moderate  effect 
(g  =  –  0.68;  95%CI  [–1.02,  –  0.33]  with  no  hetero-
geneity  (I2  =  0%).  The  forest  plot  is  reported  in 
Supplementary  Material  S9.  A  dose–response  effect 
on  EMDR  effect  size  at  post-treatment  was  not 
observed  (n  =  7,  β  =  0.0003;  p  =  0.4231).

3.4. Risk  of  bias  across  studies

Neither  visual  inspection  of  funnel  plots  nor  Egger’s 
test showed any evidence of publication bias (Figure 4 
Figure 5).

4. Discussion

The  aim  of  this  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis 
was  to  update  the  state  of  the  art  and  add 
a  quantitative  analysis  on EMDR  therapy  for depres-
sion  as  the  primary  target  for  treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on 
this topic. Although EMDR is typically associated with 
the treatment of PTSD, the AIP model (Shapiro, 2001) 
opens  up  the  possibility  to  treat  other  mental  health 
conditions with a trauma-focused approach (Hase et al., 
2017).

The  results  from  the  nine  studies  included  in  the 
present  meta-analysis  show  that  EMDR  has  a  large 
effect,  although  high  heterogeneity  was  found  and 
only two studies present a low risk of bias. The statistical 
effect  also  reflects  clinical  significance,  as  one-third  of 
people with depression benefit from EMDR therapy. In 
the limited number of studies where follow-up data was 
available positive effect of EMDR treatment were main-
tained but with a smaller effect. It should be noted that 
this  latter  finding  is  based  on  only  three  studies,  so 
future  studies  are  needed.  The  effect  was  moderate 
even  when  EMDR  is  compared  with  active  controls 
and  when  compared  directly  with  CBT.  These  results

are strengthened by the absence of heterogeneity, there-
fore EMDR could be considered as an effective trauma- 
focused  treatment  for  depression.  The  effectiveness  of 
EMDR appeared not to be related to the treatment dose 
received.  This  is  in  line  with  previous  studies,  which 
showed  no  psychotherapy  dose–response  relationship 
for  depression  (Barth  et  al.,  2013;  Stulz,  Lutz,  Kopta, 
Minami, & Saunders, 2013). Furthermore, it is impor-
tant to consider the limited range of EMDR sessions in 
the studies conducted so far. The effect sizes obtained in 
this meta-analysis are similar or superior to other meta- 
analyses  evaluating  the  effects  of  CBT  and  other  psy-
chotherapies for depression (Cuijpers, Huibers, Daniel 
Ebert, Koole, & Andersson, 2013; Cuijpers, Van Straten, 
Andersson,  &  Van  Oppen,  2008)  that  are  currently 
recommended as effective treatments for depression in 
the clinical guidelines (National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence, 2018; Parikh et al., 2009). This finding 
is in line with evidence showing that different types of 
psychotherapies  have  comparable  effects  (Barth  et  al., 
2013;  Cuijpers,  Quero,  Dowrick,  &  Arroll,  2019; 
Cuijpers  et  al.,  2008).  However,  our  meta-analysis 
included  only  9  studies,  compared  to  more  than  100 
studies  in  other  meta-analyses,  thus  highlighting  the 
need  for  high-quality  studies  to  further  evaluate  the 
effect of EMDR for depression.

4.1. Strengths  and  limitations  of  the  studies

In  general,  the  studies  have  several  limitations.  As 
expected  from  studies  in  a  field  that  is  still  in  its 
infancy,  several  methodological 
limitations  were 
found,  such  as  small  sample  size,  high  risk  of  bias, 
and  high  heterogeneity.  Less  than  half  of  the  studies 
evaluated  the  long-term  effect  of  EMDR  on  depres-
sion.  Treatment  fidelity  was  independently  checked 
and  considered  as  adequate  in  only three  studies.

The  studies  also  have  some  strengths.  In  most 
articles,  the  outcome  evaluation  criteria  were  well 
explained and the assessment tools were all validated. 
Furthermore, in recent years an increasing number of 
RCTs addressing the effectiveness of EMDR in treat-
ing depression as a primary outcome have been pub-
lished, along with an increase in their methodological 
quality. A manualized treatment protocol was applied 
in  the  great  majority  of  studies  and  data  on  the 
competence  of  the  therapists  were  provided  in  all 
but  one of  the  studies.

4.2. Strengths  and  limitations  of  this  review

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  meta-analysis  on 
the effectiveness of EMDR in the treatment of depres-
sion  as  a  primary  outcome,  going  beyond  previous 
research  that  evaluated  its  effect  as  an  associated 
symptom  in  patients  with  PTSD  (Bisson  et  al.,  2013; 
Cuijpers et al., 2020). Moreover, the Francine Shapiro

Library was consulted to retrieve grey literature, thus 
conducting  a  comprehensive  review  as  suggested  in 
the  Cochrane  handbook  (Higgins  et  al.,  2019).  This 
meta-analysis does have some limitations. First of all, 
the  number  of  included  studies  is  small,  indicating 
that  the  interest  in  research  on  the  application  of 
infancy. 
EMDR 
Secondly,  the  majority  of  the  studies  were  character-
ized  by  low  methodological  quality  and  only  a  few 
studies  examined  long-term  effects,  thus  limiting 
interpretation  of  the  results  of  this  meta-analysis. 
Finally,  another  limitation  was  represented  by  the 
impossibility  of  retrieving  data  for  two  studies, 
which therefore were not included in our quantitative 
synthesis.

treatment  outcomes 

The results of this study can inform clinical practice by 
considering  EMDR  effective  at  reducing  depression, 
thus  adding  an  additional  therapeutic  option  for  clin-
icians treating this disorder. The increase of therapeutic 
strategies for depression is of particular importance as it 
allows better personalization to be provided according 
to patients’ preferences. In fact, studies have shown that 
receiving a preferred treatment is associated with stron-
ger therapeutic alliance, lower dropout rates, and posi-
tive 
(Lindhiem,  Bennett, 
Trentacosta, & McLear, 2014; Swift, Callahan, Cooper, 
& Parkin, 2018; Windle et al., 2020). It is also essential 
to routinely evaluate the presence of adverse childhood 
experiences and traumatic events in people with depres-
sion in order to identify if trauma-focused psychothera-
pies such as EMDR could be more effective for patients 
with  a  history  of  maltreatment.  Previous  studies  have 
shown  that  exposure  to  childhood  maltreatment  pre-
dicts a poorer response to drug treatment (Nanni et al., 
2012;  Williams,  Debattista,  Duchemin,  Schatzberg,  & 
Nemeroff, 2016) and a better response to psychotherapy 
(Nemeroff  et  al.,  2003)  in  patients  with  depression. 
Therefore,  trauma-focused  therapies  could  represent 
a  valid  option  for  patients  with  depression,  who  are 
less  likely  to  respond  to  usual  treatments  and  may 
require specific interventions focused on their maltreat-
ment history. It may also be useful to consider whether 
different  types  of  adverse  childhood  experiences  play 
a  role  in  predicting  the  outcome  of  treatment,  in  line 
with  findings  supporting  a  significant  association  of 
childhood  maltreatment,  especially  emotional  abuse 
and  neglect,  with  depression  (Humphreys  et  al.,  2020; 
Mandelli, Petrelli, & Serretti, 2015; Nelson et al., 2017).
Among  EMDR  clinicians,  evaluation  of  the  type 
and  sequence  of  treatment  targets  (e.g.  current  epi-
sode  trigger;  event(s)  that  gave  rise  to  the  series  of 
recurring depressive episodes; belief system related to 
attachment  history  events)  could  be  useful  for 

therapeutic  outcomes.  More 

improving 
studies 
should also consider adopting the DeprEnd® protocol 
(Hofmann  et  al.,  2016)  as  an  EMDR  intervention 
specific for depression, or at least report a more spe-
cific  description  of  the 
intervention  offered  to 
patients,  in  line  with  current  checklists  such  as  the 
template  for  intervention  description  and  replication 
(Hofmann  et  al.,  2014).  As  effect  sizes  could  be 
inflated  by  the  inclusion  of  low-quality  studies, 
further  studies  with  better  methodological  quality 
are  needed  to  obtain  more  reliable  effect  estimates. 
Future  studies  should  include  longer-term  follow-up 
(i.e. after 1 and 2 years). This would make it possible 
to  investigate  whether  EMDR  could  be  effective  not 
only  for  reducing  depressive  symptoms  but  also  pre-
venting  relapses,  particularly  in  comparison  with 
other  interventions  already  recommended  by  clinical 
guidelines.  Although  treatment  duration  was  not 
identified  as  a  potential  moderator  of  intervention 
efficacy  either  in  this  study  or  in  previous  reviews 
on  CBT  (Barth  et  al.,  2013;  Santoft  et  al.,  2019), 
further studies should try to identify the ideal number 
of  sessions to  achieve  a  successful outcome. As  emo-
tional  dysregulation  is  a  common  clinical  feature  in 
patients  with  depression  (Aldao  et  al.,  2010a;  Sloan 
et al., 2017), and previous research has found that this 
association is mediated by the exposition to traumatic 
events (Christ et al., 2019), it would be interesting for 
future  research  to  explore  the  impact  of  EMDR  on 
emotional  regulation.  Furthermore,  no  study  has 
been conducted so far to evaluate the neurobiological 
effects  of  EMDR  in  depression.

To date, there is preliminary evidence on the effects 
of  EMDR  therapy  on  adolescents  with  depression 
(Bae,  Kim,  &  Park,  2008;  Paauw,  De  Roos,  Tummers, 
De Jongh, & Dingemans, 2019). Previous reviews have 
shown  encouraging,  although  limited,  results  on  the 
effectiveness  of  EMDR  in  reducing  depressive  symp-
toms  secondary  to  PTSD  in  children  and  adolescents 
(Manzoni  et  al.,  2021;  Moreno-Alcázar  et  al.,  2017). 
Future  controlled  studies  are  needed  to  further  evalu-
ate  the  effects  of  EMDR  for  depression  as  a  primary 
target  of  the  treatment  among  children  and  adoles-
cents.  Future  studies  should  analyse  possible  adverse 
effects and rates of attrition from EMDR treatment, as 
these  aspects  are  essential  to  inform  clinical  practice. 
Finally,  it  would  be  interesting  to  investigate  the 
impact  on  the  economic  and  social  costs  of  treating 
depression  with  EMDR  compared  to  other  psy-
chotherapies  or pharmacotherapy.

5. Conclusion

The  findings  from  this  review  suggest  EMDR  can  be 
considered  as  an  effective  trauma-focused  treatment 
for  reducing  symptoms  of  depression,  although  sev-
eral  methodological  weaknesses  were  found  in  the 

included  studies.  Further  studies  are  required  in 
order  to  replicate  these  findings,  improve  methodo-
logical  quality, and  evaluate longer-term  effects.
