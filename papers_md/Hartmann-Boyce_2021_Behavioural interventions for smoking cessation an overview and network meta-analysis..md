Background

A B S T R A C T

Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage.
Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and
effectiveness.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking
cessation  attempts  and  to  conduct  a  network  meta-analysis  to  determine  how  modes  of  delivery;  person  delivering  the  intervention;
and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence
six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics,
including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy.

To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms
of comparative costs and cost-effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary.

Methods

This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We
identified  Cochrane  Reviews  of  behavioural  interventions  (including  all  non-pharmacological  interventions,  e.g.  counselling,  exercise,
hypnotherapy, self-help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological
quality  of  reviews  using  AMSTAR  2  and  synthesised  data  from  the  reviews  narratively.  2.  We  used  the  included  reviews  to  identify
randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no
intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months
or  longer.  Screening,  data  extraction,  and  risk  of  bias  assessment  followed  standard  Cochrane  methods.  We  synthesised  data  using
Bayesian component network meta-analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention.
Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the
behavioural intervention. We used component network meta-regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics,
provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE
domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components.

Main results

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study
arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta-analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components.
Of  the  33  reviews,  confidence  in  review  findings  was  high  in  four  reviews  and  moderate  in  nine  reviews,  as  measured  by  the  AMSTAR
2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly
inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect
the  searching,  screening,  or  data  extraction  elements  of  the  review  process,  which  have  direct  bearing  on  our  CNMA.  Of  the  included
studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the
contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness
varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high-certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio
(OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15
to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent
with pair-wise meta-analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate-certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered
via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair-wise comparison), and for the following components
where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content
including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low-to
very low-certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in
harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population
characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration
of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no
difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving
smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.

Authors' conclusions

Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms.
This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the
absence  of  pharmacotherapy.  Evidence  of  benefit  is  strongest  for  the  provision  of  any  form  of  counselling,  and  guaranteed  financial
incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message,
email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how
to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking
cessation was more cost-effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias
and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed.

Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?

Key messages

Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects.

Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are
trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them.

Stopping smoking

The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.

Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural
support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with
nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking.

Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or
how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one-to-one.

Why we did this Cochrane Review

We wanted to find out:

– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;

– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and

– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.

What did we do?

We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then
compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking.

Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020.

What we found

We  found  33  Cochrane  Reviews,  from  which  we  identified  312  relevant  studies  in  250,503  adults  (aged  18  to  63  years)  who  smoked
cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking.

Most  studies  were  conducted  in  the  USA  or  Western  Europe;  115  studies  took  place  in  healthcare  settings  and  195  took  place  in  the
community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months.

The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:

– no behavioural support;

– usual or standard care;

– less-intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.

We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta-analysis.

What are the main results of our review?

Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six
months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with
these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking.

Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support.

Compared  with  no  support,  tailoring  behavioural  support  to  the  person,  or  group  of  people,  trying  to  stop  smoking  probably  slightly
increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking.

Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how
many people stopped smoking.

We are uncertain about:

– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise-based support, and entering competitions; and

– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.

Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted
effects.

How confident are we in our results?

We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change
these results.

We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations
with  some  of  the  studies,  including  how  they  were  designed,  conducted,  and  reported.  These  results  are  likely  to  change  when  more
evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.

Description of the condition

Smoking  is  hazardous  to  health,  shortening  life  by  a  mean  of  10
to  11  years  in  people  who  smoke  their  whole  lives  and  killing
more  than  seven  million  people  each  year  (Doll  2004;  Pirie  2013;
WHO  2018).  Tobacco  kills  up  to  half  of  its  users,  increasing
mortality  primarily  through  cardiovascular  disease,  lung  cancer,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (WHO 2018). It is also
causally  associated  with  other  cancer-  and  non-cancer-related
health conditions, giving rise to premature morbidity and mortality
(USDHHS 2014). Fortunately, smoking cessation reverses much of
the damage. Stopping smoking before the age of 35 years prevents
almost all early mortality; stopping by age 60 years improves life
expectancy  by  three  years;  and  stopping  after  60  still  reduces
mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer risk (Doll 2004; Mons
2015; Müezzinler 2015; Ordóñez-Mena 2016).

Worldwide, over one billion people are current tobacco smokers,
with approximately 80% living in low- and middle-income countries
(WHO  2018).  In  the  UK,  as  in  many  other  high-income  countries,
smoking  is  a  major  contributory  factor  to  health  inequalities,
with  the  burden  of  smoking-related  disease  disproportionately
impacting people of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and people
belonging  to  certain  social  groups,  including  ethnic  minorities
and  people  living  with  mental  health  conditions  (ASH  2016).
Aside  from  the  risks  to  the  individual,  smoking  remains  the
prime preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, making it an
important population health concern (GBD 2016).

Smoking  places  an  enormous  economic  burden  on  societies.
The  economic  costs  of  smoking  include  healthcare  expenditures
for  treatment  of  smoking-related  diseases  and  those  affected  by
second-hand smoke, loss of earnings and workplace productivity,
disability-adjusted  life-years  (DALY)  lost,  and  other  indirect  costs,
including  fire  damage  and  environmental  harm  from  growing
tobacco  (ERS  2013).  In  2012,  5.7%  of  global  health  expenditure
was due to smoking-attributable diseases. Combining the costs of
health  expenditures  and  productivity  losses,  the  total  economic
cost  of  smoking  was  an  estimated  USD  1436  billion,  which  is
equivalent to 1.8% of the world's annual gross domestic product
(GDP).  Forty  percent  of  this  cost  occurred  in  low-  and  middle-
income countries (Goodchild 2018).

Among  smokers  who  know  it  is  hazardous  to  their  health,  most
want  to  quit  (WHO  2018).  However,  quitting  is  challenging,  and
most smokers make multiple attempts before successfully quitting
(Chaiton 2016). There is a strong evidence base showing that both
behavioural  therapies  and  pharmacotherapies  can  help  people
quit, either alone, or in combination (Cahill 2013; Hartmann-Boyce
2014a; Lancaster 2017; Matkin 2019; Stead 2016; Stead 2017).

Description of the interventions

Behavioural  therapies  for  smoking  cessation  vary  widely  in  their
content,  delivery,  and  availability.  Typically,  they  include  advice
to  quit  smoking,  information  on  how  to  quit  smoking,  or  a
combination  of  both,  but  may  use  different  techniques  and
theoretical frameworks to achieve these aims. They can range from
one-off  brief  advice  from  a  healthcare  professional  (Stead  2013),
or  a  printed  leaflet  (Livingstone-Banks  2019a),  to  more  intensive
programmes  involving  multiple  counselling  sessions  (Lancaster

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2017; Matkin 2019; Stead 2017), with or without added components
such  as  financial  incentives  and  partner  support  (Faseru  2018;
Notley  2019).  They  may  be  delivered  in  conjunction  with,  or
independent from, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, and may
be delivered to people motivated to quit or to people not interested
in  quitting.  Some  interventions  may  be  tailored  to  the  individual
or  a  particular  subgroup  (pregnant  women,  parents,  teenagers,
people with pre-existing conditions), while other interventions may
be more general or applicable to all. Evidence on whether tailoring
increases  effectiveness  is  inconclusive  (Livingstone-Banks  2019a;
Taylor  2017),  as  is  evidence  on  whether  increasing  intensity  (e.g.
length  of  sessions,  duration  of  intervention)  is  associated  with
increased effectiveness (Hartmann-Boyce 2019; Matkin 2019).

How the intervention might work

Behavioural  therapies  for  smoking  cessation  can  work  by
prompting a quit attempt or by helping to maintain abstinence once
a  person  has  tried  to  quit,  or  both.  Factors  that  seem  to  prompt
quit attempts are typically related to motivation, such as concern
over the long-term health effects or the financial cost of smoking.
Factors  associated  with  long-term  success  after  a  quit  attempt
mostly relate to the strength of the underlying addiction to smoking
(Vangeli 2011). However, most attempts are made without the aid
of behavioural support, and it is plausible that factors influencing
motivation,  resilience  to  overcome  the  challenges  of  quitting,  or
other psychological processes may mediate the impact of various
components of behavioural support.

Why it is important to do this overview

Globally,  smoking  is  the  leading  cause  of  preventable  death  and
disease. Accordingly, governments and healthcare systems invest
in smoking cessation services, but these vary in their effectiveness
(West  2013).  Much  of  this  variation  is  the  result  of  differences
in  the  behavioural  support  provided  (Brose  2011;  Dobbie  2015).
It  is  important  to  pinpoint  which  types  of  behavioural  support
work best for smoking cessation and focus available resources and
training  on  the  most  effective  approaches.  This  requires  data  on
comparative effectiveness.

Existing  Cochrane  Reviews  in  this  area  primarily  focus  on  mode
of  delivery  (e.g.  in-person  support  either  one-to-one  (Lancaster
2017) or in groups (Stead 2017), telephone-delivered (Matkin 2019),
delivered  without  in-person  contact  by  mobile  phone  (Whittaker
2019),  by  printed  media  (Livingstone-Banks  2019a),  or  Internet
(Taylor 2017) or provider (e.g. nurse (Rice 2017)). These reviews all
show these interventions are effective but include few or no direct
comparisons between these different modes of delivery, and little
investigation  of  other  components  of  these  programmes  which
may impact effectiveness.

Network meta-analysis provides an opportunity to compare many
different types and components of behavioural interventions with
each  other  simultaneously.  By  conducting  a  Cochrane  Overview
of reviews, we can also summarise relevant interventions that fall
outside the scope of a network meta-analysis (Pollock 2020).

resources  with  which  to  provide  smoking  cessation  services,  it  is

interventions for smoking cessation.

Types of interventions

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed
the  effect  of  behavioural  interventions  designed  to  support
smoking  cessation  attempts  and  to  conduct  a  network  meta-
analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the
intervention;  and  the  nature,  focus  and  intensity  of  behavioural
interventions  for  smoking  cessation  influence  the  likelihood  of
achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking
and  whether  the  effects  of  behavioural  interventions  depend
upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the
provision of pharmacotherapy.

Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion

Types of reviews/studies

We  restricted  this  overview  to  Cochrane  Reviews  of  randomised
controlled  trials  of  behavioural  therapies  for  smoking  cessation.
We  restricted  the  component  network  meta-analysis  (CNMA)  to
randomised controlled trials already listed as included or excluded
in eligible Cochrane Reviews. We screened all included studies in
eligible  reviews  and  queried  lists  of  excluded  studies  to  check  if
those studies that had been excluded on the basis of comparator
(e.g. where a study had been excluded from a review because it was
a head-to-head comparison of two behavioural interventions) were
eligible for inclusion in this review.

We  included  reviews  that  tested  behavioural  interventions  for
smoking  cessation,  delivered  at  the  individual  or  group  level
(as  opposed  to  public  health  interventions  such  as  standardised
packaging), and those defined by intervention type (e.g. 'Individual
counselling  for  smoking  cessation'  (Lancaster  2017)),  person
delivering the intervention (e.g. 'Nursing interventions for smoking
cessation'  (Rice  2017)),  and  theoretical  basis  of  intervention  (e.g.
'Motivational interviewing for smoking cessation' (Lindson 2019a)).
To  meet  the  condition  of  joint  randomisability,  we  restricted
interventions in the network meta-analysis to those that a person
might receive from, or be referred to by, a healthcare professional
(e.g.  not  workplace  interventions  (Cahill  2014)),  or  to  which
an  individual  could  plausibly  self-refer.  As  such,  we  excluded
interventions tailored to specific population groups as these violate
the  assumption  of  joint-randomisability  (or  transitivity),  though
we  included  interventions  tailored  at  the  individual  level  (e.g.
interventions where content varied based on participants' baseline
motivation  to  quit).  We  also  excluded  from  the  network  meta-
analysis  any  historical  interventions  that  would  not  plausibly
be  offered  in  the  present  day  (e.g.  aversive  smoking),  along
with  interventions  that  targeted  multiple  lifestyle  changes  (e.g.
dietary change in addition to smoking cessation), and interventions
targeted at smoking outcomes other than abstinence (e.g. smoking
reduction).

We  excluded  reviews  or  trials  that  evaluated  the  effects  of
included
pharmacotherapies  for  smoking  cessation,  though 
studies  in  which  both  intervention  and  control  arms  received
the  same  pharmacotherapy,  and  that  met  all  other  inclusion
criteria (e.g. studies testing behavioural interventions as adjuncts
to pharmacotherapy, as per Stead 2017).

Types of participants

We considered the following components in our CNMA.

At  the  overview  level,  we  included  all  participants  covered  by
the reviews included in this overview. These were normally adult
smokers. Following the methods used by Cahill 2013, we did not
include reviews that focused on particular populations of smokers
(e.g. adults with mental health problems) (e.g. Tsoi 2013; van der
Meer 2013). These reviews cover a range of interventions beyond
the behavioural interventions considered by this overview, and the
relevant reviews of specific behavioural interventions will already
include studies in specific subgroups (e.g. the review of 'Individual
counselling for smoking cessation' includes studies conducted in
people with mental health problems (Lancaster 2017)).

To  ensure  comparability  between  studies  and  to  ensure  joint
randomisability,  inclusion  criteria  for  studies  in  the  CNMA  were
narrower  than  for  the  overview  in  general.  We  only  included
studies  in  which  participants  were  adult  cigarette  smokers  (aged
18  years  or  older),  who  were  randomised  prior  to  quitting,
and  who  were  not  selected  on  the  basis  of  a  pre-existing
condition (e.g. pregnancy, heart disease). The latter was because
interventions  targeting  particular  populations  of  smokers  (e.g.
smoking cessation interventions to protect infants from the harms
of  parental  smoking;  smoking  cessation  interventions  delivered
with  the  explicit  motivational  purpose  of  preventing  a  second
myocardial infarction) were not considered 'jointly randomisable'
as members of the population without such circumstances could
not realistically be referred to such interventions.

To  be  included  in  the  CNMA,  trials  must  have  compared  a
behavioural  intervention  for  smoking  cessation  with  another
behavioural intervention for smoking cessation or with a 'minimal'
control (e.g. no treatment or a waiting list control).

Types of outcome measures

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Studies of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation often do
not measure adverse events. Where included reviews reported on
adverse events, we summarised findings narratively.

Search methods for identification of reviews

To identify eligible reviews, we searched the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in the Cochrane Library for any reviews
with 'smoking' or 'tobacco' in the title, abstract, or keyword fields
(most recent search 28 July 2020). Since Cochrane Reviews strive
for  methodological  rigour  and  are  regularly  updated,  we  did  not
include non-Cochrane reviews in this overview.

We  identified  studies  to  include  in  the  CNMA  by  screening  the
reviews  that  met  our  inclusion  criteria.  In  one  case  (Carr  2012),
the searches for the review had been updated by our information
specialist but the published review update was not yet available;
we summarised the published review in our overview, but included
studies  identified  in  the  most  recent  search  for  the  purposes  of
the CNMA. The review update of Carr 2012 will also include these
studies, but we anticipate this update will be published after this
overview.

We ran a separate search to identify relevant economic evidence (20
May 2019). This included:

• searching the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) using
the following terms: tobacco OR smok* OR cigaret* OR nicotine;
• searching  MEDLINE,  Embase,  and  CINAHL  from  1  December
2015,  to  capture  any  relevant  evaluations  published  since
NHS  EED  ceased  being  updated,  using  specialist  search  terms
for  economic  evidence  derived  from  Scottish  Intercollegiate
Guideline Network (SIGN) guidance ((SIGN 2018); see Appendix
1 for MEDLINE strategy).

Data collection and analysis

Selection of reviews

Two authors independently assessed all potentially eligible reviews
for  inclusion  in  the  overview.  We  raised  uncertainties  with  the
broader  project  team,  and  the  whole  project  team  approved  the
final list of included reviews. We listed key excluded reviews in a
table of excluded reviews, along with reasons for exclusion (Table
1).

Selection of studies

Two  authors  independently  screened  the  included  and  excluded
studies  in  each  included  review  for  inclusion  in  the  CNMA.  We
resolved  discrepancies  through  discussion  or  referral  to  a  third
author. We did not include ongoing studies identified from existing
reviews  in  the  CNMA,  as  these  were  not  formally  screened  for
inclusion by the original authors. We created a table listing studies
included in the original reviews but excluded from the CNMA along
with reasons for exclusion from the CNMA (S4 Excluded studies).

In accordance with standard methods from the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group, the primary outcome for this overview and CNMA
was smoking cessation at six months or longer from baseline. The
preferred measurement of cessation was biochemically validated
continuous  or  prolonged  abstinence,  measured  at  the  longest
reported time point, and including all participants randomised in
their original groups.

in an overall confidence rating of low or critically low, respectively.

Where  overview  authors  were  also  authors  on  included  reviews,
two overview authors not involved in the original review conducted
quality assessment for the review in question.

We did not exclude reviews on the basis of AMSTAR 2 ratings, but
considered the ratings in our interpretation of our results.

Study level

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We only extracted data from studies that were eligible for inclusion
in  the  CNMA.  We  extracted  the  following  characteristics  for  each
study.

• Population:  number  randomised  to  each  group;  mean  age
across  study  population;  percentage  women  across  study
population;  presence  of  pre-existing  conditions  (defined  as
healthy or less-healthy based on inclusion criteria and whether
pre-existing  conditions  were  prevalent  in  demographic  data);
percentage  pregnant;  SES  (defined  as  high  or  low  depending
on whether the majority of participants exceeded a high-school
education); motivation to quit (determined by inclusion criteria:
motivated to quit, seeking help to quit, or both; not motivated
to quit; general population not selected on motivation); mean
cigarettes per day at baseline.

• Intervention  and  comparator  group  content:  behavioural
components;  nature  of  intervention  focus  (categorised  as:
intervention  focused  on  reasons  why  a  person  might  quit
smoking;  intervention  focused  on  methods  to  quit  smoking;
intervention has approximately equal focus on both elements);
nature  of  support  provided  (categorised  as:  addressing
motivation;  maximising  self-regulation;  promoting  adjuvant
activities,  as  per  Michie  2011;  categories  are  not  mutually
exclusive);  delivery  mode;  setting; 
intervention  provider;
duration of intervention; session length; frequency of sessions;
total  number  of  sessions;  tailoring;  provision  of  financial
incentives; type of pharmacotherapy provided.

• Risk of bias (see Assessment of risk of bias in included studies).
• Smoking cessation: number who quit in each group at longest
follow-up  using  the  strictest  measure  available;  definition  of
cessation; number available at follow-up.

Two authors independently extracted data, first from information
provided in the original reviews in which the studies were included,
and  then  any  information  not  supplied  in  the  original  review
was  extracted  from  the  full-text  study  report.  Some  reviews  had
overlap (i.e. the same study was included in more than one review).
We  recorded  where  this  was  the  case  and  data  from  each  study
was  only  used  once  in  the  CNMA.  Where  there  were  different
assessments  or  data  extracted  for  the  same  study,  two  authors
extracted data from the original publication in duplicate.

Assessment of methodological quality of included reviews

Two  authors  independently  assessed  the  quality  of  each  review
using  the  AMSTAR  2  measurement  tool;  disagreements  were
resolved by discussion or by referral to a third author (Shea 2017).
Seven of the 16-items of the AMSTAR 2 tool were identified as critical
domains, as defined in Shea 2017, due to their greater effect on the
validity of review findings and as such, were weighted more heavily
when rating overall confidence in the results of the review. One or

Where  risk  of  bias  had  already  been  assessed  for  the  studies
in  reviews  included  in  the  CNMA,  we  checked  that  this  was
performed  consistently  in  accordance  with  Cochrane  Tobacco
Addiction Group guidance for assessing each domain. Where this
had been done, we used these 'Risk of bias' assessments and did
not re-evaluate. Where it appeared that the risk of bias guidance
had not been consistently applied, or where specific domains had
not been evaluated for specific reviews, two authors independently
assessed  risk  of  bias  as  part  of  the  data  extraction  process,  with
discrepancies resolved by discussion or referral to a third author,
where necessary.

For studies that required further assessment, we used the Cochrane
'Risk of bias' tool v1 for the following domains: random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measure,
attrition, and other bias. Random sequence generation, allocation
concealment,  and  other  bias  were  assessed  based  on  standard
methods set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011).  Following  standard  Cochrane
Tobacco  Addiction  Group  methods  for  reviews  of  behavioural
interventions  where  blinding  is  not  possible,  we  did  not  assess
performance bias, and assessed detection bias in the following way.

• We judged studies to be at low risk of bias if smoking status was
measured objectively (i.e. biochemical validation) or if smoking
status  was  measured  by  self-report,  but  the  intervention  and
control  arms  received  similar  amounts  of  face-to-face  contact
(or none).

• We judged studies to be at high risk of detection bias if smoking
status was measured by self-report only, and participants in the
intervention arm had more personal contact than in the control
arm, as results may be prone to differential misreport.

Attrition is often substantial in smoking cessation trials. To assess
attrition  bias,  we  followed  standard  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction
Group methods.

• We judged studies to be at low risk of bias when the following
conditions were all met: numbers lost to follow-up were clearly
reported  for  each  group  (not  just  overall,  unless  the  overall
percentage  lost  was  less  than  10%);  the  overall  number  of
participants lost was not greater than 50%; and the difference
in percentage followed up between groups was not greater than
20%. We also considered results at low risk of attrition bias if the
authors reported sensitivity analyses that indicated the overall
direction  of  effect  was  not  sensitive  to  different  imputation
methods for loss to follow-up.

• We  judged  studies  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias  when  the  above
thresholds were not met, or in the case of cluster-randomised
trials, where entire clusters were not followed up.

• We  judged  studies  at  unclear  risk  when  the  number  lost  to
follow-up in each group was not clear, and authors did not report
sensitivity analyses based on loss to follow-up.

We judged studies at low risk of bias overall if judged to be of low
risk for all domains. We considered them at high risk of bias overall
if they were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains.
We considered all other studies at unclear risk of bias overall. We
presented the results of the risk of bias assessment in a 'Risk of bias'
summary figure.

Measures of treatment effect

Included  reviews,  for  the  most  part,  reported  smoking  cessation
at  the  longest  follow-up  using  risk  ratios  (RR),  calculated  as:
(number of quitters in intervention group/number randomised to
intervention group)/(number of quitters in control group/number
randomised  to  control  group).  In  the  CNMA,  we  reported  pooled
results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs) as
the statistical model described in Data synthesis is conducted on
the log-OR scale, as in Cahill 2013. However, we also considered the
absolute effect sizes implied by these pooled estimates.

Unit of analysis issues

For cluster-randomised trials, we used the effect size reported in the
systematic review (or if not available, in the original trial paper), and
checked that allowance for clustering was made in performing the
analysis. In the majority of studies, the trial papers made allowance
for  clustering;  otherwise,  this  was  done  in  the  review  before  the
trial's results were entered into a meta-analysis.

If  in  a  trial  at  least  two  arms  shared  the  same  components,
these  arms  were  combined  into  one.  If  in  a  trial  at  least  two
arms  shared  the  same  components  but  differed  in  the  provision
of  pharmacotherapy  (and  included  a  comparison  with  additional
arm(s) with pharmacotherapy), then we excluded the arms without
the pharmacotherapy.

Dealing with missing data

Any  participants  lost  to  follow-up  were  assumed  to  be  smoking,
excluding  deaths,  as  is  standard  in  the  field  (West  2005),  and
is  standard  across  reviews  produced  by  the  Cochrane  Tobacco
Addiction Group. For studies in the CNMA, we noted in the 'Risk of
bias' tables the proportion of participants for whom the outcome
was  imputed  in  this  way,  and  whether  there  was  either  high
or  differential  loss  to  follow-up.  The  assumption  that  'missing  =
smoking'  provides  conservative  absolute  quit  rates,  and  makes
little difference to the OR unless dropout rates differ substantially
between groups.

Assessment of reporting biases

There  is  no  established  way  of  assessing  reporting  bias  within
CNMA.  We  extracted  information  from  the  included  systematic
reviews  regarding  any  investigation  or  presence  of  reporting  or
publication bias.

Data synthesis

We synthesised data from the included reviews on both smoking
cessation and adverse events (where reported), producing tables
with key characteristics of each included review (title, publication
year, number of included studies, number of included participants,
key  findings,  and  certainty  in  the  evidence,  where  assessed)  as

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

per  standard  guidance  for  Cochrane  Overviews  (Pollock  2020).
We  did  not  attempt  to  standardise  numerical  results  in  this
table, as data on effectiveness and comparative effectiveness was
derived  from  the  CNMA,  and  information  on  adverse  events  was
heterogeneously measured and reported, precluding comparisons
between interventions.

We  used  Bayesian  CNMA  and  meta-regression  (CNMR)  random-
effects models, with adjustment for multi-arm studies, to evaluate
the comparative effectiveness of the components identified above
and draw conclusions about which components were most strongly
associated with smoking cessation. We did not attempt to evaluate
adverse events or harms using CNMA as most studies of behavioural
interventions for smoking cessation do not record adverse events,
and in those that do, event data is heterogeneously collected and
summarised. Models were constructed similarly to those used by
Freeman  and  colleagues  (Freeman  2018)  and  adapted  to  include
a binomial likelihood with logit link for binary outcome. The main
results  model  included  all  motivational,  behavioural,  provider,
and  delivery  components  described  earlier  (excluding  intensity
components)  and  assumed  their  effects  were  additive  (i.e.  no
interactions between components). The model including intensity
components was run in a smaller sample, including only those trials
that provided details on all intensity components.

Bayesian  analyses  were  run  using  WinBugs  version  1.4.3
(Cambridge,  UK)  and  R  (version  4.0.0)  using  the  R2WinBUGS
package (Sturtz 2005). For each model, three different chains with
different initial values were run, each with at least 30,000 iterations,
discarding the first 15,000 iterations and with the default thinning
interval  set  by  the  R2WinBUGS  package  to  compute  summary
estimates. Trace plots were used to evaluate convergence for each
chain. Flat priors for the trials' baseline risks (defined as quit rates
in  control  arms),  component  effects,  and  between-trial  standard
deviation (SD, measured on the log-odds scale) were chosen as in
Freeman 2018. A common between-trial SD was assumed.

We  analysed  intensity  variables  for  interventions  which  involved
sessions  (e.g.  interventions  such  as  counselling;  interventions
such as one-off print-mailings were not included in this analysis).
Intensity  variables  were  duration  of  intervention,  total  length  of
sessions, and number of sessions; we excluded studies that did not
report data for all these three variables. This left 92 studies eligible
for  this  analysis.  We  used  a  continuous  model  which  assumes
linearity;  we  a  priori  decided  not  to  use  a  categorical  model  for
this variable as some of the included studies involved incremental
increases  in  intensity  variables;  collapsing  into  categories  would
have  thus  rendered  arms  from  these  studies  ineligible  for  this
analysis,  which  already  had  a  substantially  reduced  sample  size
compared to the main analysis because of incomplete reporting in
this area.

Meta-regression

In  the  CNMR,  a  common  interaction  between  the  covariates
and  each  of  the  component  effects  was  assumed  (i.e.  the  same
for  each  component),  with  flat  priors.  Models  with  independent
component-specific  interactions  were  also  considered  but  as
they  did  not  indicate  an  improvement  in  fit,  as  measured  by
reduction  in  the  Deviance  Information  Criterion  (DIC),  we  opted
for the simpler model assuming the same interaction effect for all
components.  All  models  were  fitted  in  a  sample  of  all  trials  with
complete information for the selected covariate. Models including

continuous covariates were centred on the mean of the covariate
across all studies.

We  considered  the  following  as  covariates,  which  were  extracted
(where available) for each trial.

• Mean age at baseline.
• Percentage female.
• Study setting: community or healthcare.
• SES, defined as a binary variable due to the variation in reporting
across studies: 'low' where 50% or more of the study population
had  their  highest  level  of  education  as  high  school  or  less  or
where mean years of education was less than or equivalent to
completing  high  school  in  that  country,  or  where  income  or
deprivation level was reported instead of education, where 50%
or  more  were  below  the  median  deprivation/income  level  for
that community; 'high' where the opposite applied.

• Pre-exisiting conditions at baseline, defined as a binary variable
due  to  variation  in  reporting  across  studies:  'low'  was  coded
where  the  population  was  healthier  than  might  be  expected
in a general population of smokers (e.g. studies in which both
arms  were  given  pharmacotherapy  and  study  investigators
excluded people with pre-existing health conditions); 'high' was
coded where more than 50% of study participants reported pre-
existing conditions or where inclusion criteria were tailored to a
less healthy population.

• Mean cigarettes per day at baseline.
• Length of follow-up.
• Quit  rates  in  control  arms  (described  as  'baseline  risk';  we
applied a continuity correction of 0.5 when fitting this covariate
as the presence of arms with 0 events prevented convergence of
the statistical model).

We  had  originally  planned  to  also  consider  pregnancy  and
motivation  to  quit  as  covariates.  In  our  final  models,  we  did
not  analyse  pregnancy,  as  no  eligible  studies  reported  including
pregnant  people.  We  also  did  not  analyse  motivation  to  quit,  as
it  seemed  likely  that  these  trials  mostly  recruited  people  who
were actively wanting to quit smoking, but this was not explicitly
reported for most trials and so could not be inferred directly.

We  did  not  conduct  separate  subgroup  analyses,  but  where
individual  reviews  present  these  data,  we  considered  it  when
reporting their findings.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  considered  heterogeneity  between  interventions  first  by
examining  how  the  contributing  reviews  reported  heterogeneity.
For pooled results from individual included reviews, we used the I2
statistic to represent heterogeneity. I2 values over 50% are typically
considered substantial. The I2 statistic cannot be used in CNMA, so
for  our  CNMA,  we  considered  the  95%  CrI,  the  median  between-
trial  SD,  and  the  DIC  as  indicators  of  heterogeneity  and  relative
model fit. When adding variables to our analyses, we considered
the impact they had on the SD and DIC. This informed our choice of
which model to present as our primary model. We created contour
plots  to  identify  the  studies  contributing  the  most  deviance.  We
then conducted three post hoc analyses to explore the impact of
reducing possible causes of variation; these are described in more
detail in the Results section.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Sensitivity analysis

We  tested  whether  findings  from  our  model  were  sensitive  to
the  exclusion  of  studies  at  high  overall  risk  of  bias  (based  on
risk  of  bias  assessments  for  individual  studies,  not  on  overall
quality or certainty judgements for the reviews in which they were
contained),  and  whether  they  were  sensitive  to  removal  of  the
studies contributing the most deviance.

Evaluating certainty of the evidence

When  included  reviews  used  a  GRADE  approach  to  evaluate
certainty  of  the  evidence,  we  reported  these  findings  in  the
overview.

We present three modified 'Summary of findings' tables presenting
effect  estimates  and  GRADE  evaluations 
for  each  of  the
components, grouped as 1. behavioural/motivational components;
2.  provider;  3.  delivery  mode,  using  an  adapted  version  of  the
approach  set  forward  in  Yepes-Nuñez  2019.  The  effect  estimates
and  GRADE  ratings  in  these  tables  refer  to  individual  component
effects,  but,  where  relevant,  we  used  data  from  pair-wise  meta-
analysis to inform rating decisions.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no agreed best method for
evaluating certainty in CNMA. Therefore, we evaluated certainty for
the  component  effect  estimates  by  drawing  upon  the  principles
set for GRADE evaluations for network meta-analysis (Puhan 2014),
with adaptations to assessment of some GRADE domains to better
suit CNMA.

• We  assessed  risk  of  bias  by  evaluating  whether  the  sensitivity
analysis  removing  studies  at  high  risk  of  bias  meaningfully
altered  the  effect  estimate,  by  evaluating  the  risk  of  bias  in
studies  that  included  the  component  of  interest,  and,  where
relevant,  in  the  context  of  findings  from  pair-wise  meta-
analyses.
• We  assessed 

individual
imprecision  using  the  CrIs 
components  and  number  of  events  in  studies  including  that
component.  We  used  predefined  thresholds  in  which  point
estimates  or  CrIs  greater  than  0.95  and  less  than  1.05  were
judged to indicate no clinically significant difference.

for 

• We  assessed  inconsistency  by  considering  and  comparing
data  from  the  original  reviews  which  conducted  pair-wise
comparisons with the estimates from the CNMA.

• We  assessed  indirectness  by  considering  data  from  both  pair-
wise comparisons (as per the reviews included in the overview)
and the CNMA, as well as considering the impact of covariates on
component effect estimates.

• We assessed publication bias using judgements from the pair-
wise  meta-analyses  in  the  original  included  reviews,  where
possible.

Incorporating economic evidence

We  developed  a  brief  economic  commentary  to  summarise  the
availability  and  principal  findings  of  trial-based  and  model-
based  full  economic  evaluations  that  compared  the  behavioural
interventions  of  interest  for  smoking  cessation  in  this  overview
(Shemilt  2020).  The  commentary  focuses  on  the  extent  to
which principal findings of eligible economic evaluations indicate
that  a  behavioural  intervention  for  smoking  cessation  might
judged  favourably  (or  unfavourably)  from  an  economic
be

perspective when compared with other behavioural interventions
for smoking cessation (which could include comparisons between
interventions  of  a  similar  intensity,  or  between  interventions  of
different intensities), when implemented in different settings.

Following  Cochrane  guidance,  a  single  author  screened  and
selected eligible studies and classified them by type and analytic
framework  (Higgins  2011).  We  extracted  data  on  the  analytic
perspective,  time  horizon,  main  cost  items  (classified  into  health
sector  costs,  other  sector  costs,  patient  and  family  costs,  and
productivity  impacts),  and  setting,  as  well  as  on  the  principal
findings (verbatim text on conclusions drawn by the author of each
evaluation, and text summarising uncertainty surrounding authors'
principal conclusions). We used these to inform the development
of  the  brief  economic  commentary,  which  we  included  in  the
Discussion  section  of  the  review.  We  did  not  critically  appraise
any of the identified economic evaluations, as we did not attempt

to  draw  any  firm  or  general  conclusions  on  the  relative  costs  or
efficiency of the included interventions.

Description of included reviews

Reviews  included  from  one  to  104  studies  of  smoking  cessation
interventions,  with  a  range  of  615  to  over  110,000  participants.
In  total,  the  reviews  included  981  studies,  with  almost  600,000
participants.  However,  this  included  some  double-counting  (see
'Representation of and overlap between reviews').

Four reviews investigated several health behaviours, with smoking
as  one  of  them  (Hollands  2010;  Huibers  2007;  Marteau  2010;
Vodopivec-Jamsek  2012).  We  only  considered  the  studies  and
analyses from these reviews that focused on smoking cessation.

Reviews typically searched a combination of the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase,
PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical
Trials  Registry  Platform  (ICTRP),  with  the  most  recent  updates
typically searching just the Register and clinical trial registries. The
dates of the most recent searches ranged from November 2005 to
August 2019.

Population

Reviews included studies of people who smoked tobacco cigarettes
without  restrictions  on  demographic  information  or  motivation
to  quit.  Livingstone-Banks  2019b  also  included  studies  of  recent
quitters,  but  these  studies  were  not  eligible  for  the  CNMA.  Five
reviews  focused  on  a  wider  range  of  health  behaviours  beyond
smoking, and hence included non-smokers (though we were only
interested  in  the  smoking  studies  within  them).  Chamberlain

2017  focused  on  pregnant  women  who  smoked,  Maziak  2015
focused on people who smoke tobacco using waterpipes, Thomsen
2014 focused on smokers soon to undergo surgery, Behbod 2018
focused on adult smokers responsible for caring for children, and
Cahill  2014  focused  on  employees  who  smoked.  These  reviews
were  not  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  CNMA  as  the  interventions
they  tested  were  not  considered  'jointly  randomisable'  (e.g.  a
non-pregnant  person  could  not  be  randomised  to  receive  an
intervention  designed  for  pregnant  people;  someone  without
caring responsibilities could not be randomised to an intervention
designed to protect children under their care from environmental
tobacco exposure).

Interventions

We grouped the review interventions into four categories.

Intervention type/modality

Sixteen reviews investigated intervention modality. Three reviews
looked  at  the  effects  of  presenting  smokers  with  test  results
that  demonstrated  exposure  to,  or  damage  from,  smoking,  or
genetic  disposition  to  risk  from  smoking-related  disease  (Clair
2019;  Hollands  2010;  Marteau  2010).  Four  reviews  investigated
the  effects  of  smoking  cessation  counselling,  delivered  face-to-
face (Lancaster 2017; Stead 2017), via telephone (Matkin 2019), or
via  video  call  (Tzelepis  2019).  Four  reviews  investigated  self-help
materials, including printed self-help materials (Livingstone-Banks
2019a),  resources  and  reminders  provided  using  mobile  phone
messages  or  apps  (Vodopivec-Jamsek  2012;  Whittaker  2019),

or  websites  (Taylor  2017).  Two  reviews  investigated  the  effects
of  rewarding  smokers  for  quitting,  through  either  guaranteed
financial  incentives  (Notley  2019),  or  entry  into  competitions
(Fanshawe 2019). Other intervention types included exercise-based
interventions  (Ussher  2019),  and  hypnotherapy  (Barnes  2019).
Hajek 2001 investigated the effect of aversive smoking on cessation.

Intervention provider

Five  reviews  focused  on  interventions  delivered  by  specific
providers. The providers were general practitioners (Huibers 2007),
physicians (Stead 2013), nurses (Rice 2017), community pharmacy
personnel (Carson-Chahhoud 2019), and dental professionals (Carr
2012).

Theoretical basis

Two  reviews  investigated  interventions  based  on  a  specific
theoretical  basis.  Lindson  2019a

motivational interviewing (MI). Cahill 2010 included studies testing
interventions based on the stages of change model.

Other focus

Ten  reviews  investigated  other  intervention  focuses.  Livingstone-
Banks  2019b  investigated  interventions  intended  to  prevent
relapse 
in  smokers  who  had  successfully  quit,  or  as  an
addition  to  cessation  interventions  in  current  smokers.  Faseru
2018  investigated  smoking  cessation  support  that  incorporated
a  partner  support  component.  Hollands  2019 
investigated
behavioural  interventions  intended  to  improve  adherence  to
pharmacotherapy. Lindson 2019b investigated smoking reduction
as  a  method  of  quitting  smoking.  Hartmann-Boyce  2019
investigated  the  effect  of  behavioural  interventions  provided
in  addition  to  cessation  pharmacotherapy.  Chamberlain  2017
investigated  behavioural 
interventions  for  pregnant  women
who  smoke.  Maziak  2015  investigated  behavioural  interventions
for  people  who  smoke  tobacco  using  waterpipes.  Thomsen
2014  investigated  behavioural  interventions  for  smokers  soon

interventions  targeting  adult  smokers  responsible  for  caring  for
children,  with  a  goal  of  reducing  the  children's  exposure  to
environmental tobacco smoke. Cahill 2014 investigated workplace
interventions designed to help employees quit smoking.

Comparators

Comparators  in  the  included  reviews  included:  no-intervention,
usual  or  standard  care,  less  intensive  versions  of  the  tested
interventions,  and  alternative  interventions  (of  equal  or  lower
intensity,  potentially  with  a  different  theoretical  basis  or
intervention provider).

Outcomes

All reviews measured tobacco use abstinence, in most cases at six
months or longer. Eleven reviews measured some form of adverse
events. Some reviews included other outcomes, such as short-term
abstinence, number of quit attempts, and quality of life measures.
All  additional  outcomes  are  reported  in  S1  Characteristics  of
included studies.

Study types

All reviews included randomised controlled trials, with some also
including quasi-randomised studies. Vodopivec-Jamsek 2012 also

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

included controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series
with at least three time points before and after the intervention.

Excluded reviews

We  excluded  four  potentially  relevant  reviews  at  the  full-text
screening  stage.  Two  reviews  had  ineligible  interventions:  one
focused on preventing weight gain rather than smoking cessation
(Farley 2012), and the other only included one study that addressed
smoking,  but  this  was  as  part  of  a  multi-behaviour  intervention
(Dale  2008).  One  review  focused  on  an  ineligible  population  (i.e.
adolescents only) (Fanshawe 2017), and one review was withdrawn
from  the  Cochrane  Library  (Cahill  2008)  because  it  had  been
superseded by another review included in this overview (Fanshawe
2019). We list reasons for exclusion in Table 1.

Description of included studies

Three-hundred  and  thirty-five  randomised  controlled  trials  from
26  reviews  met  the  initial  inclusion  criteria  for  our  CNMA  (see
PRISMA  diagram:  Figure  1).  Twenty-three  of  these  studies  were
excluded because participants were randomised to interventions
which  did  not  differ  on  the  components  of  interest  (see  Table
2).  Therefore,  312  studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  final
analyses,  representing  845  study  arms  and  250,563  participants.
Characteristics  of  these  studies  are  summarised  below.  S2
Details  of  included  studies  contains  further  details  on  study  and
intervention  characteristics  as  they  related  to  our  analysis,  as
well  as  information  on  the  review  from  which  initial  data  were
extracted  ('Primary  review'  column).  Seventeen  eligible  studies
were  identified  from  excluded  studies  lists  of  included  reviews;
further  contextual  information  on  these  studies  can  be  found  in
S3  Additional  characteristics  of  previously  excluded  studies.  For
contextual  information  on  characteristics  of  all  other  included
studies, readers are encouraged to refer to the original review from
which the study was identified.

Population

Most studies took place in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies
took place in healthcare settings and 195 in community settings.
The median number of study participants per arm was 173 (range
7  to  3357).  The  median  age  of  study  participants  was  42  years
(range 18 to 63) in the 277 studies which reported it; the median
percentage  of  women  was  54%  (range  0%  to  100%).  Of  the  179
studies  that  reported  it,  109  enrolled  a  population  where  the
majority of participants were of high SES according to our criteria.
Of the 668 studies which reported data on pre-existing conditions,
51 were judged to be 'healthy' as per the methods set out above. No
studies mentioned including pregnant people; 65 explicitly stated
that they excluded this group. In the 237 studies which reported it,
the median number of cigarettes smoked per day at baseline was 20
(range 3.5 to 37). Thirty-six studies recruited people already seeking
help  to  quit,  an  additional  104  were  restricted  to  participants
motivated to quit, eight explicitly recruited people who were not
interested in quitting smoking, and the remainder did not report
selection based on motivation.

Interventions and comparators

We considered comparator groups to also represent interventions,
and  hence  descriptions  here  apply  to  all  study  arms.  Sixty-one
studies  had  control  arms  which  included  no  smoking  cessation
support  whatsoever  (i.e.  no  behavioural  components,  and  no

pharmacotherapy) ("minimal interventions"); this category is used
as the reference group in the CNMA. Components are summarised
in  Table  3  and  Figure  2.  Of  the  603  study  arms  that  reported
intervention  duration,  the  median  duration  was  eight  weeks
(range  zero  to  104).  Of  the  350  arms  where  length  of  session
was  relevant  and  reported,  the  median  length  was  18  minutes
(range  eight  to  180).  In  the  602  arms  where  number  of  sessions

was  relevant  and  reported,  the  median  number  offered  was
four  (range  zero  to  64).  We  restricted  studies  to  those  where
pharmacotherapy was equivalent across arms: 71 studies offered
nicotine  replacement  therapy,  seven  offered  bupropion,  two
offered  varenicline,  26  offered  other  pharmacotherapies  or  a
combination  of  pharmacotherapies,  and  the  remainder  did  not
involve pharmacotherapy.

component is shown. app: mobile phone application; audio: audio recording; IVR: interactive voice response; SMS:

Outcomes

The  mean  length  of  follow-up  for  included  studies  was  10.5
months  (range  six  to  34).  One  hundred  and  sixty-eight  studies
biochemically validated smoking status. Two-hundred and eighty
studies reported how abstinence was defined; of these, 149 used
point prevalence and the remainder used a measure of sustained
(56  studies),  prolonged  (23  studies),  or  continuous  (52  studies)
abstinence.

Excluded studies

Of  the  2770  studies  included  in  or  listed  as  excluded  from  the
included  reviews,  2433  were  ineligible  for  our  CNMA.  Following
deduplication  (removal  of  230  studies)  and  removal  of  1171

studies  identified  as  irrelevant  based  on  information  reported  in
the  reviews,  the  primary  reasons  for  exclusion  were  ineligible
population (526 studies); ineligible intervention (300 studies), and
ineligible outcomes (77 studies). Further details can be found in S4
Excluded studies.

Representation of and overlap between reviews

Many trials were included in two or more of the included reviews.
This is illustrated by the 337 studies which met our inclusion criteria
for our CNMA. Of these, 94 were included in two reviews and 19 were
included in three reviews.

The  number  of  eligible  studies  included  in  the  CNMA  from  each
review can be seen in Figure 3.

reviews) confidence in review results because of at least one critical
weakness. Nine reviews were rated moderate and four rated high.

Of  the  critical  domains,  18/33  reviews  had  accessible  protocols.
An  additional  14  reviews  reported  a  protocol  publication  date
with  or  without  discussion  of  protocol  deviations  which  also
suggests  an  a  priori  protocol  was  followed.  All  reviews  used  a
comprehensive  literature  search  strategy,  but  some  reviews  only
partially  adhered  to  this  standard  because  the  authors  did  not
report searching the reference lists of included studies or did not
consult  content  experts  in  the  field,  or  both.  All  review  authors
provided a list of excluded studies with justifications for exclusions,
and  most  reviews  reported  an  appropriate  method  for  statistical
combination  of  results  when  meta-analyses  were  performed.
Thirteen reviews reported satisfactory techniques for assessing risk
of  bias  in  individual  studies.  This  standard  was  partially  met  by
an  additional  15  review  authors  who  did  not  assess  for  selective
reporting. Thirty-one reviews discussed the impact of risk of bias in
individual studies, but only 14 reviews adequately investigated and
discussed the impact of publication bias on review findings.

Of the non-critical domains, the majority of reviews included the
components  of  PICO  in  their  research  questions  and  inclusion
criteria,  although  only  one  review  provided  an  explanation  for
their  selection  of  study  designs  (which  in  most  cases  was  solely
randomised  controlled  trials).  Most  reviews  performed  study
selection  and  extraction  in  duplicate,  but  six  reviews  provided
inadequate  descriptions  of  the  study  settings,  population  or
comparator  (or  both)  groups  of  included  studies.  When  meta-
analysis  was  conducted,  most  review  authors  investigated  the
potential  impact  of  risk  of  bias  in  individual  studies  on  results
and  satisfactorily  explained  any  heterogeneity  observed.  Thirty
of  the  33  reviews  reported  on  sources  of  conflict  of  interest  and
adequately discussed how this was managed, when necessary.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Risk of bias in included studies

Risk  of  bias  ratings  for  the  studies  eligible  for  the  CNMA  can
be  found  in  S2  Details  of  included  studies.  Reasons  for  these
judgements  as  they  apply  to  individual  studies  can  be  found  in
the  primary  reviews  from  which  the  studies  were  identified.  A
subset of studies was listed in included reviews but did not have
full  risk  of  bias  assessments;  reasons  for  risk  of  bias  judgements
for  these  studies  can  be  found  in  S3  Additional  characteristics
of  previously  excluded  studies  and  in  S6  Additional  risk  of  bias
domains  for  the  two  reviews  (Rice  2017;  Stead  2013),  which  did
not  originally  assess  all  core  domains  as  set  out  above.  Overall,
50/312  included  studies  were  judged  at  low  risk  of  bias  (low  risk
across  all  domains),  125  were  judged  at  high  risk  of  bias  (high
risk in at least one domain), and 137 were judged at unclear risk
of  bias.  A  summary  of  the  risk  of  bias  judgements  for  individual
domains  can  be  found  in  Figure  4.  Most  studies  were  at  unclear
risk of selection bias due to inadequate reporting of methods for
random sequence generation or allocation concealment (or both).
The  domain  contributing  the  most  'high  risk'  judgements  was
blinding of outcome assessment; in 72 studies, detection bias was
a potential issue to differential amounts of support between study
arms and self-reported outcome measures, introducing the risk of
differential misreport, though the majority of studies were still at
low risk in this domain (216/312 studies). The majority of studies
(221/312) were also at low risk of attrition bias, 55 did not provide
sufficient  information  with  which  to  judge,  and  36  were  at  high
risk due to substantial attrition overall or substantial differences in
attrition rates by study arm. We only assessed 'other risk of bias'
when we suspected it to be present.

Effect of interventions

Below we report information on the effects of the interventions on
cessation (reviews and CNMA) and adverse events (reviews only).
Additionally, findings from the primary analyses in each included
review as they relate to the outcomes and interventions of interest
for  this  overview  can  be  found  in  S7  Details  of  primary  analyses
from included studies. Where reviews reported multiple outcomes
or comparisons of relevance to our research questions, we focused
on  the  main  findings  from  the  individual  reviews  as  identified
in  their  'Summary  of  findings'  tables.  If  'Summary  of  findings'
tables  were  not  available,  we  completed  the  table  using  findings
reported in the review abstracts. Some reviews reported findings
beyond  those  reported  in  their  'Summary  of  findings'  tables.  In
these instances, the review findings summarised below go beyond
those reported in table S7 Details of primary analyses from included
studies.

Effect(s) detected

Livingstone-Banks 2019a found moderate-certainty evidence that
when no other support was available, printed self-help materials
helped more people to stop smoking than no intervention (RR 1.19,
95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  1.03  to  1.37;  I2  =  0%;  11  studies,  n
= 13,241). However, there was no evidence that printed materials
increased  cessation  compared  with  not  providing  them  when
participants also received advice from a health professional or use
of  nicotine  replacement  therapy  (RR  0.99,  95%  CI  0.76  to  1.28;
I2  =  32%;  11  studies,  n  =  5365).  They  found  moderate-certainty
evidence that tailored self-help materials were more effective than
no intervention (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.51; I2 = 0%; 10 studies,
n = 14,359). However, when compared with non-tailored materials
delivered with the same amount of contact, there was no evidence
of  benefit  (RR  1.07,  95%  CI  0.89  to  1.30;  I2  =  50%;  10  studies,  n  =
11,024).

Stead 2017 reported a benefit of group counselling compared with
self-help (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.33; I2 = 0%; 13 studies, n = 4395;
moderate-certainty evidence), and brief support (RR 1.25, 95% CI
1.07 to 1.46; I2 = 60%; 16 studies, n = 7601; low-certainty evidence).
However,  they  found  no  evidence  of  a  difference  between  group
and individual counselling (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33; I2 = 0%; 5
studies, n = 1523; moderate-certainty evidence).

Lancaster  2017  found  high-certainty  evidence  that  individually
delivered  smoking  cessation  counselling  can  assist  smokers
to  quit  compared  with  usual  care,  brief  advice,  or  self-help
materials  (RR  1.57,  95%  CI  1.40  to  1.77;  I2  =  0%;  27  studies,
n  =  11,100).  They  also  reported  smaller  relative  benefits  when
counselling  was  provided  as  an  adjunct  to  pharmacotherapy
compared with pharmacotherapy plus usual care, brief advice, or
self-help materials (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.51; I2 = 0%; 6 studies,
n  =  2662;  moderate-certainty  evidence),  and  of  more-intensive
counselling compared with less-intensive counselling (RR 1.29, 95%
CI  1.09  to  1.53;  I2  =  48%;  11  studies,  n  =  2920;  high-certainty
evidence).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Taylor 2017 found evidence that interactive and tailored Internet-
based  interventions  provided  increased  abstinence  compared
with non-active controls, both when as an adjunct to behavioural
support (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.18; I2 = 60%; 5 studies, n = 2334;
moderate-certainty  evidence),  or  without  additional  behavioural
support (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30; I2 = 58%; 8 studies, n = 6786;
low-certainty evidence). However, compared with another smoking
cessation  intervention,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  benefit  from
Internet-based interventions with additional behavioural support
(RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, n = 2769; moderate-
certainty evidence), or without additional behavioural support (RR
0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.09; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, n = 3806; moderate-
certainty evidence). They also found no evidence of a benefit when
comparing tailored and interactive interventions with non-tailored
non-interactive  comparators,  for  Internet  programmes  (RR  1.10,
95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; I2 = 0%; 7 studies, n = 14623; moderate-certainty
evidence) or Internet messaging (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.41; I2 =
57%; 3 studies, n = 4040; low-certainty evidence).

Notley 2019 reported high-certainty evidence that, compared with
no incentives, guaranteed financial incentives improved smoking
cessation rates in general-population smokers (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.28
to  1.73;  I2  =  33%;  33  comparisons  from  30  studies,  adjusted  n  =
20,097),  and  moderate-certainty  evidence  of  benefit  in  pregnant
people who smoked (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.69; I2 = 41%; 9 studies,
n = 2273).

Whittaker  2019  reported  moderate-certainty  evidence  of  benefit
from  automated 
text  message-based  smoking  cessation
interventions compared with minimal support (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19
to 2.00; I2 = 71%; 13 studies, n = 14,133). They also found moderate-
certainty evidence of benefit from text messaging interventions as
an adjunct to cessation support compared with cessation support
alone  (RR  1.59,  95%  CI  1.09  to  2.33;  I2  =  0%;  4  studies,  n  =  997).
However,  they  did  not  detect  a  benefit  from  smartphone  apps
compared with less-intensive support (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52;
I2 = 59%; 5 studies, n = 3079; very low-certainty evidence).

Matkin  2019  found  moderate-certainty  evidence  that,  compared
with  self-help  materials  or  brief  counselling  at  a  single  call,
proactive telephone counselling aided smokers who sought help
from quitlines (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.16; I2 = 72%; 14 studies,
n  =  32,484),  and  moderate-certainty  evidence  of  benefit  in  other
settings  (RR  1.25,  95%  CI  1.15  to  1.35;  I2  =  52%;  65  studies,  n
=  41,233).  Subgroup  analysis  investigating  potential  variation  in
effect  from  differences  in  the  number  of  contacts,  type  or  timing
of  telephone  counselling,  or  when  telephone  counselling  was
provided as an adjunct to other smoking cessation therapies, found
no evidence of a difference between subgroups (P = 0.21, I2 = 33%).

No effect detected/effect very uncertain

None  of  the  three  reviews  testing  risk  assessment  feedback
detected clear evidence of an effect. Clair 2019 found no evidence
of a benefit of biomedical risk assessment feedback for smoking
cessation  compared  with  standard  care  or  minimal  intervention.
They  found  moderate-certainty  evidence  narrowly  missing  a
benefit of spirometry and carotid ultrasound test results to show
the  harm  of  smoking  (RR  1.26,  95%  CI  0.99  to  1.61;  I2  =  34%;
11  studies,  n  =  3314).  There  was  moderate-certainty  evidence  on
the effect of feedback on smoking exposure by carbon monoxide
monitoring (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.21; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, n = 2368).

There was low-certainty but no evidence of benefit from feedback
on smoking-related risk by genetic marker testing (RR 0.80, 95% CI
0.63 to 1.01; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, n = 2064). Hollands 2010 pooled three
studies  testing  visual  feedback  and  explanation  of  individuals'
medical imaging results compared with mixed control conditions
and  detected  a  benefit  (OR  2.81,  95%  CI  1.23  to  6.41;  I2  =  0%;  n
= 214; GRADE evaluation not performed). However, they reported
that  due  to  limited  available  evidence,  no  strong  statements
could be made about the effectiveness of communicating medical
imaging results to change health behaviour. Marteau 2010 did not
detect  a  benefit  from  communicating  DNA-based  disease  risk
estimates for smoking cessation when compared with non-DNA-
based  disease  risk  estimates  or  no  estimate  (OR  1.03,  95%  CI
0.66  to  1.61;  I2  =  50%;  5  studies,  n  =  2166;  GRADE  evaluation  not
performed).

Fanshawe 2019 found no evidence of a benefit from performance-
based  eligibility  competitions  (RR  1.16,  95%  CI  0.77  to  1.74;
I2  =  57%;  6  studies,  n  =  3201;  very  low-certainty  evidence),  or
from performance-based reward competition (5 studies, unable to
pool due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity) compared
with no intervention or non-competition-based smoking cessation
interventions.

Ussher  2019  found  no  evidence  that  adding  exercise  to  smoking
cessation  support  improved  abstinence  compared  with  support
alone (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22; I2 = 0%; 21 studies, n = 6607; low-
certainty evidence).

Barnes 2019 found no evidence of a benefit from hypnotherapy for
smoking cessation compared with attention-matched behavioural
support (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, n = 957;
low-certainty evidence), brief advice (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69;
I2 = 0%; 2 studies, n = 269; very low-certainty evidence), or intensive
behavioural support (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.18; I2 = 0%; 2 studies,
n  =  211;  very  low-certainty  evidence).  They  did  detect  a  benefit
when hypnotherapy was compared with no treatment (RR 19, 95%
CI  1.18  to  305.88;  1  study,  n  =  40;  very  low-certainty  evidence).
However, this was based on a single study of which they judged the
certainty of evidence to be very low.

Hajek  2001  did  detect  a  statistical  benefit  from  aversive  rapid
smoking for smoking cessation compared with attention-matched
placebo  (OR  2.01,  95%  CI  1.36  to  2.95;  I2  =  0%;  12  studies,  n
=  536;  GRADE  evaluation  not  performed).  However,  despite  this,
the  authors  recommended  interpreting  this  result  with  caution
because  of  suspected  publication  bias  and  serious  problems
with  study  methods  that  the  authors  deemed  likely  to  lead
to  spurious  positive  results.  They  concluded  that  there  was
insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of rapid smoking.

Stead 2013 reported that brief advice from a physician, compared
with  usual  care  or  no  advice,  increased  cessation  rates  (RR  1.76,

Rice  2017  reported  moderate-certainty  evidence  that,  compared
with  usual  care  or  minimal  intervention,  behavioural  support  to
motivate and sustain smoking cessation delivered by nurses could
lead  to  a  modest  increase  in  the  number  of  people  who  achieve
prolonged  abstinence  (RR  1.29,  95%  CI  1.21  to  1.38;  I2  =  50%;  44

Carson-Chahhoud  2019  reported  that  community  pharmacists

Carr  2012  reported  that,  compared  with  usual  care,  no  contact,
or less-intensive treatment, oral health professionals providing a
behavioural  intervention  to  support  tobacco  cessation  alongside
oral  care  may  increase  tobacco  abstinence  rates  among  both
cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users (adjusted OR 1.71,

Huibers  2007  only  found  two  studies  of  the  use  of  psychosocial
interventions  by  general  practitioners  for  smoking  cessation,
and  were  unable  to  pool  results  because  of  statistical  and
methodological  heterogeneity.  Both  tested  a  more-intensive
intervention against a single contact control, and each favoured the
intervention.

Cahill  2010  found  that  stage-based  counselling  interventions
were effective for promoting smoking cessation compared with any
standard self-help materials (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.59; I2 = 28%;
6  studies,  n  =  5947;  GRADE  evaluation  not  performed),  but  were
neither  more  nor  less  effective  that  non-stage-based  counselling
interventions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, n =

a benefit from stage-based self-help materials compared with non-

No effect detected/effect very uncertain

Two  other  reviews  examined  methods  of  offering  behavioural
support for cessation, finding no evidence of effectiveness, but with
substantial imprecision due to small numbers of included studies.
Tzelepis  2019  found  no  evidence  of  a  difference  between  video
counselling and telephone counselling for assisting people to quit
smoking  (RR  2.15,  95%  CI  0.38  to  12.04;  I2  =  66%;  2  studies,  n  =

only one study of preventive healthcare mobile phone messaging
interventions  for  smoking  cessation  compared  with  usual  care,
which favoured the intervention.

Lindson 2019a found insufficient evidence to determine whether MI
helps people to stop smoking compared with no intervention (RR

Hollands 2019 reported that, in people who were stopping smoking
and receiving behavioural support, enhanced behavioural support

Chamberlain 2017 reported a benefit from psychosocial smoking

Thomsen 2014 reported that providing behavioural support prior
to  planned  surgery  increased  abstinence  at  the  time  of  surgery
compared  with  no  cessation  support  or  brief  advice  to  stop.  The
effect appeared larger for intensive support (RR 10.76, 95% CI 4.55

than brief support (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46; I2 = 75%; 7 studies,

from multiple workplace interventions (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.13;
I2 = 30%; 6 studies, n = 5018; moderate-certainty evidence). They

Maziak  2015  found  three  studies  of  behavioural  support  for
waterpipe  smoking  cessation  compared  with  usual  care  or  no

Behbod  2018  examined  the  effect  of  behavioural  support  for
smoking cessation in parents and carers where the motivation was
to reduce environmental tobacco smoke exposure in children. They
did not pool studies due to heterogeneity of intervention type and
trial methods, but judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to
very low. They judged that there was insufficient evidence to make
any conclusions on whether this support was more effective than
usual care or minimal intervention.

Faseru  2018  found  no  evidence  of  a  benefit  from  interventions

Component network meta-analysis

Note:  throughout  this  section,  when  discussing  SD,  we  were
referring to the median of the posterior SD.

Main analysis

Figure  5  shows  results  from  our  CNMA  including  all  eligible
studies  before  any  adjustment  for  covariates.  This  main  analysis
did  not  include  trials  where  arms  varied  only  in  intensity,  and
hence included 284 studies and 659 study arms. There was some
variability  between  studies  which  was  not  fully  explained  by
the  components  (median  between-trial  SD  0.337,  95%  CrI  0.281
to  0.398).  We  chose  to  present  this  model  (without  covariates)
as  our  primary  model  as  it  was  the  most  parsimonious  (DIC
4137),  and  adding  in  the  covariates  (as  described  below)  did  not
substantially  improve  model  fit  (i.e.  did  not  significantly  reduce
DIC). Components were grouped by component type, with minimal
intervention  as  the  reference  category.  Point  estimates  for  the
effect of each component, with 95% CrIs and the numbers of trials,
arms, and participants contributing data, can be seen in Figure 5.
Trace  plots  indicated  good  convergence.  For  some  components,
CrIs  were  wide,  but  for  three  components,  the  point  estimate
suggested  clinically  important  benefit,  and  the  CrI  excluded  no
clinically important difference:

A further four components had point estimates suggesting clinically

• a focus on 'how to quit';
• intervention content including motivational techniques;
• tailoring;
• delivery in a group setting.

All  other  components  had  CrIs  where  the  lower  bound  included
meaningful  reductions  in  the  likelihood  of  achieving  abstinence.
Delivery by a stop smoking advisor had a point estimate indicating
a  reduction  in  cessation,  though  the  CrI  included  no  clinically
significant difference. Two components (delivery by a dentist, and
'other'  delivery  mode)  were  represented  by  a  very  small  number
of  comparisons  and  are  not  displayed  in  the  forest  plot  as  the
CrIs were too wide to be represented graphically along with other
more  precise  component  effects,  or  contribute  any  meaningful
information; this was also apparent from the posterior density plots
for these components.

This analysis assumed that component effects were additive and,
therefore,  combinations  of  them  could  easily  be  calculated  by
multiplying  component  effects.  For  example,  the  effect  of  group
face-to-face  counselling  could  be  calculated  by  multiplying  the
effects of delivery of an intervention to a group (OR 1.16, 95% CrI
0.96 to 1.40), by the effect of face-to-face delivery of an intervention
(OR  1.04,  95%  CrI  0.86  to  1.25),  by  the  effect  of  counselling  (OR
1.44, 95% CrI 1.22 to 1.70), that is 1.16 × 1.04 × 1.44 = 1.74, which
means  the  odds  of  smoking  cessation  are  74%  greater  for  group
face-to-face counselling compared to minimal intervention (note,

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

behavioural  and  motivational  components  based  on  programme
content  or  provider  components  (or  both),  could  also  be  added
in,  further  impacting  the  estimate).  Similarly,  the  effects  of  one
component  versus  another  one  could  be  calculated  by  dividing
the  effect  of  one  component  by  the  other.  For  example,  the
effect  of  group  face-to-face  counselling  versus  individual  face-
to-face  counselling  could  be  calculated  by  dividing  1.16/0.90
=  1.29,  which  means  the  odds  of  smoking  cessation  are  29%
greater for group versus individual face-to-face counselling. With 37
estimated component effects, one could calculate more than one
billion combinations of component effects (237), although only 437
different combinations of two or more components were observed
in contributing studies. Combinations of two components and their
frequencies  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  In  our  protocol,  we  did  not
prespecify combining specific components; we plan to explore this
in a subsequent publication. Readers should note the assumption
of additivity is at this point only an assumption, and may not hold
for certain components.

Excluding studies at high risk of bias

We  ran  a  prespecified  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  studies  at
high  risk  of  bias  (Figure  6),  which  did  not  substantially  alter  the
median  between-trials  SD  (from  0.337  to  0.315).  CrIs  were  wider
for all component effects, as would be expected from the reduced
sample size, and one component (e-mail) no longer had any studies
contributing  data.  With  the  exception  of  substantially  decreased
point estimates for delivery by physicians and pharmacists, there
were no clinically significant changes to point estimates.

Investigating variability

We  created  a  contour  plot  displaying  deviance  residuals  and
leverage  by  study  arm  (Figure  7;  Appendix  2).  We  used  this  plot
to  identify  studies  contributing  higher  than  expected  residual

deviance;  of  the  17  studies  for  which  this  was  the  case,  all  were
either  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias  (10/17),  had  an  arm  or
multiple arms with very low smoking cessation event rates or no
events (8/17), or had unexpectedly high smoking cessation event
rates (13/17). To investigate the impact of variability on component

effect estimates, we ran three post hoc analyses. In the first of these,
as arms with no events emerged as important contributors to total
residual  deviance,  we  first  applied  a  continuity  correction  of  0.5
to  these  studies.  In  model  2,  we  excluded  arms  with  no  events.
In  model  3,  we  ran  a  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  arms  with  a
contribution to overall DIC greater than 3. Model 1 slightly reduced

SD (from 0.337 to 0.333). Model 2 also only slightly reduced SD (to
0.313). Model 3 had the most impact on variation, reducing the SD
to  0.237.  None  of  these  models  substantially  altered  component
effect estimates, though in some cases CrIs narrowed. In model 3,
CrIs for delivery by email and delivery by recorded audio no longer
included no difference.

Intensity covariates

In  the  subset  of  92  studies,  we  first  fitted  a  model  without
the  intensity  components,  then  included  all  three  components
together.  The  SD  decreased  (from  0.314  to  0.276)  and  made  a
modest difference to the DIC (from 1408 to 1411).

For  all  three  intensity  variables,  CrIs  included  no  difference,  but
each point estimate suggested that increasing intensity increased
the  odds  of  smoking  cessation.  In  the  model  including  all  three
variables:

• each additional week of an intervention was associated with an
increase in odds of smoking cessation of 1.003 (95% CrI 0.997 to
1.009);

• for  mean  length  of  individual  sessions,  each  additional  10
minutes  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  odds  of  smoking
cessation of 1.040 (95% CrI 0.963 to 1.122);

• each additional session was associated with an increase in odds

of smoking cessation of 1.016 (95% CrI 0.997 to 1.036).

Because of likely collinearity between duration of intervention and
number  of  sessions,  we  also  fitted  these  independently  of  one
another,  which  increased  the  effect  estimates  and  reduced  the
bounds of the CrIs:

• the effect of duration of the intervention increased to OR 1.051
(95% CrI 0.990 to 1.116) after excluding number of sessions;
• the effect of number of sessions increased to OR 1.019 (95% CrI

1.000 to 1.037), after excluding duration.

Thus,  an  additional  40-minute  increase  in  length  per  session
increased the odds of cessation by 1.17 (95% CrI 0.86 to 1.59), or
adding five extra sessions of behavioural support gave an OR of 1.08
(95% CI 0.99 to 1.19).

Study-level covariates

Table  4  gives  estimates  of  the  effect  of  characteristics  of  the
population  or  co-intervention  with  pharmacotherapy  on  the
component  effects  in  the  model.  Overall,  there  was  no  evidence
that characteristics of the population or the duration of the study
moderated  the  component  effects.  All  interaction  terms  showed
convergence.

The  provision  of  pharmacotherapy  was  associated  with  slightly
weaker (1.5% weaker) component effect sizes (OR 0.985, 95% CrI
0.975  to  0.996)  and  slightly  reduced  heterogeneity  (SD  reduced
from 0.337 to 0.330; DIC from 4137 to 4135). This is a multiplicative
effect that was calculated as a mean across all components.

None  of  our  prespecified  population  covariates  significantly
moderated  component  effects  or  improved  model  fit.  Length  of
study  follow-up  (i.e.  the  last  time  point  at  which  an  assessment
of cessation was made) also appeared to have no impact, neither
did  quit  rate  in  the  control  arm.  All  interaction  terms  between
covariates  and  component  effects  included  the  null  effect,  and
estimates were very precise (very narrow CrIs for covariates).

behavioural support for smoking cessation. A summary of relevant

Summary of main results

Evidence from existing Cochrane Reviews and from CNMA showed
that behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase
quit  rates  at  six  months  or  longer,  but  effectiveness  varies  based
on the characteristics of the behavioural support provided (Table
6; Table 7; Table 8). Two elements of interventions consistently and
with high certainty demonstrated benefit when taking into account
both  data  from  pair-wise  meta-analyses  and  findings  from  our
CNMA, namely: the provision of guaranteed financial incentives (as
per Notley 2019) and the provision of counselling (as per Lancaster
2017  and  Stead  2017).  In  absolute  terms,  our  analyses  suggest
that  the  inclusion  of  financial  incentives  in  a  programme  may
lead  to  an  additional  3  per  100  people  quitting,  compared  to  a
background quit rate of 6 per 100 people. The effect of counselling
was similar (Table 6). These estimates are incremental for individual
components,  and  none  of  these  components  would  be  delivered
independent of other components; the anticipated absolute effect
should not be misinterpreted as an intervention effect, but as the
independent effect of one of the components of said intervention.

Our  CNMA  showed  moderate-certainty  evidence  of  benefit  for  a
further  four  components  of  behavioural  support.  For  three  of
these, CrIs also encompassed no clinically significant differences:
intervention  content  focused  on  how  to  quit  (no  relevant  pair-
wise  meta-analysis);  inclusion  of  content  related  to  motivation
(no  relevant  pair-wise  meta-analysis);  and  tailoring  behavioural
support  to  individual  characteristics  (supported  by  evidence
from  pair-wise  meta-analysis  in  Livingstone-Banks  2019a  and
Taylor  2017).  There  was  also  moderate-certainty  evidence  of
benefit  for  text-message  delivery,  with  CrIs  excluding  one,  and
supported  by  moderate-certainty  evidence  from  pair-wise  meta-
analysis  in  Whittaker  2019;  however,  certainty  was  downgraded
due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in the pair-wise meta-
analysis.  There  were  no  data  to  suggest  an  increase  in  harms
in  groups  receiving  behavioural  support  for  smoking  cessation.
There were also no data to suggest that population characteristics
influenced  component  effectiveness,  but  data  here  were  limited
due  to  some  trials  not  reporting  these  data,  and  the  absence
of  evidence  should  not  be  interpreted  as  evidence  of  absence.
Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through
number  of  contacts,  duration  of  each  contact,  and  length  of
programme,  was  associated  with  modestly  increased  chances  of
success,  though  effect  estimates  included  no  difference,  and  the
analysis assumed a constant increase in chances of cessation with
every unit of intensity component. In a CNMA meta-regression, an
interaction between pharmacotherapy and the component effects
suggested  that  the  component  effects  may  be  slightly  weaker
in  studies  where  all  participants  were  given  pharmacotherapy  to
support cessation; this is consistent with data from a contributing
review  which  found  high-certainty  evidence  that  behavioural
support  increased  quit  rates  in  people  given  pharmacotherapy
for  smoking  cessation,  but  that  the  magnitude  of  effect  was
smaller than in studies in which no pharmacotherapy was offered
(Hartmann-Boyce 2019).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Thirty-three  Cochrane  reviews  and  312  randomised  controlled
trials  contributed  data  to  this  review;  a  further  23  analyses
were  covered  in  our  brief  economic  commentary  (see  below).
We  believe  that  makes  this  the  largest  review  to  date  within
this  subject  area,  and  hope  this  will  make  it  particularly  helpful
to  decision  makers.  Despite  the  volume  of  data  reviewed,
many  contributing  reviews  and  component  effect  estimates
would  be  strengthened  by  further  data,  as  imprecision  was  an
important  issue  affecting  certainty  (see  Quality  of  the  evidence)
and  some  unexplained  variability  between  studies  remains.
There  are  recognised  issues  with  under-reporting  of  intervention
content  in  this  area  (de  Bruin  2020),  and  we  were  missing
data  from  many  of  the  included  studies,  with  quantitative  data
on  intervention  intensity  and  certain  population  characteristics
(e.g.  SES)  particularly  poorly  reported.  Due  to  variation  and
lack  of  reporting  regarding  population  characteristics,  we  were
unable  to  determine  with  any  certainty  whether  population
characteristics  influence  the  comparative  effectiveness  of  the
interventions  and  components  evaluated.  Individual  participant
data (particularly for population characteristics) meta-analysis or
network  meta-analysis  using  original  datasets  may  be  the  best
way  to  investigate  this  in  the  future.  This  may  be  of  particular
importance when evaluating the impact of interventions on groups
bearing  disproportionate  smoking-related  burdens,  for  example
less-advantaged communities and people living with mental health
disorders. As in most areas of research, the majority of studies were
set  in  higher-income  countries  and  usually  in  higher  SES  groups
within those countries. We have no reason to believe that the effects
of behavioural support would vary across countries, but no data to
support this either, so it is unclear whether cultural responses to
behavioural support moderate its effectiveness.

Following  the  approach  taken  in  Cahill  2013,  we  restricted  this
overview to Cochrane Reviews, and the CNMA to studies identified
through those reviews. Due to the sheer volume of literature and
the need to make pragmatic decisions regarding resource, we chose
this  approach  as  both  feasible  and  minimally  compromising  the
completeness of the data, because these reviews cover almost all
common components of behavioural support and are considered
the  gold-standard  in  this  area.  For  all  reviews  contributing  data
to  the  CNMA  and  not  judged  stable  or  updated  within  the
past  three  years,  we  ran  new  searches  and  published  updates
to  capture  recent  studies  and  ensure  our  CNMA  was  as  up-to-
date  as  possible.  We  are  very  grateful  to  the  individual  author
teams  contributing  to  these  updates.  Despite  these  efforts,  we
may  have  missed  relevant  reviews  and  trials  existing  outside
of  these  Cochrane  Reviews.  We  may  have  particularly  missed
studies  comparing  different  interventions,  though  some  reviews
included these in their analyses and all others should list them as
excluded;  for  the  latter  we  included  these  studies.  We  have  also
inevitably missed some recently published trials, particularly those
published  in  2019  and  2020;  this  is  the  case  with  all  systematic
reviews  and  particularly  those  of  this  size,  but  is  perhaps  more
of  a  pronounced  issue  given  our  approach  to  identifying  studies
through relevant Cochrane Reviews. For intervention components
such  as  counselling,  the  lack  of  recent  trials  is  unlikely  to  make
a  meaningful  difference  to  the  effect  estimate,  as  the  body  of
literature  here  is  large  and  has  remained  consistent  over  time.
For components with fewer studies contributing data, particularly
those  incorporating  emerging  technologies  (e.g.  real-time  video

review over the coming years.

significant proportion of studies included in our CNMA were at high
risk  of  bias,  sensitivity  analyses  removing  these  studies  provided
reassurance in most cases.

When  considering  the  applicability  of  the  effect  estimates
presented,  it  is  important  to  note  that  each  component  effect
estimate  is  for  the  contribution  of  that  component  to  an
intervention.  None  of  our  components  could  be  delivered
independently of other components tested. The analysis presented
here  assumed  additivity,  but  this  needs  to  be  tested  further.  For
example, the evidence from the contributing review of individual
counselling  for  smoking  cessation  shows  high  certainty  evidence
of a benefit when compared to minimal support (RR 1.57, 95% CI
1.40  to  1.77;  Lancaster  2017).  Our  component  effect  estimate  for
individual  mode  of  delivery  of  an  intervention  was  OR  0.90  (95%
CrI  0.90  to  1.07).  Though  at  first  glance  this  seems  incongruent,
in  reality  the  effect  estimate  from  the  pair-wise  comparison
represents  a  combination  of  components.  For  example,  a  study
contributing to this pair-wise meta-analysis may be a combination
of individual delivery (OR 0.90, 95% CrI 0.90 to 1.07); counselling
(OR  1.44,  95%  CrI  1.22  to  1.70);  and  is  likely  to  focus  on  how  to
quit (OR 1.19, 95% CrI 1.01 to 1.41); motivation (OR 1.08, 95% CrI
0.96  to  1.22);  self-regulation  (OR  1.05,  95%  CrI  0.91  to  1.22);  be
delivered  by  a  psychologist/counsellor  (OR  1.02,  95%  CrI  0.85  to
1.22); with face-to-face delivery (OR 1.04, 95% CrI 0.86 to 1.25), and
delivered  over  two  sessions  (for  each  session  increase,  OR  1.016,
95% CrI 0.997 to 1.036). If we assume additivity, then multiplying
these effect estimates results in an illustrative OR of 1.88, which is
not incongruent with the observed effect estimate from the pair-
wise meta-analysis (ORs are typically higher than RRs in studies of
smoking  cessation).  Of  note,  the  latter  is  an  illustrative  estimate
only and does not consider the imprecision as indicated by the CrIs
or  how  to  assess  certainty  across  combinations  of  components;
we  intend  to  explore  methods  for  combining  component  effect
sizes  and  measures  of  precision  in  more  depth  in  a  subsequent
publication,  but,  in  the  meantime,  hope  this  worked  example
demonstrates the way in which the effect sizes for an intervention
with  specific  component  combinations  could  be  estimated.  That
said, our model assumed additive effects and we have not tested
for  departure  from  this  assumption.  It  is  possible  that  effect  of
some  components  is  lowered  by  the  presence  of  other  effective
components, as appears to be the case for the effect of behavioural
support when used with pharmacotherapy.

Quality of the evidence

Of  the  included  reviews,  the  majority  (20/33)  were  rated  as  low
or  critically  low  using  the  AMSTAR  2  tool.  For  19  of  these,  the
critical weakness in question was a failure to discuss the possible
impact of publication bias on review findings. This was typically the
case in reviews which did not have sufficient studies contributing
to  any  meta-analyses  to  test  for  publication  bias  using  a  funnel
plot, and which did not mention publication bias in the results or
discussion sections. The other critical weakness impacting some of
the reviews for which a first version was published over a decade
ago, a protocol was not accessible. Importantly, we did not judge
these  weaknesses  as  likely  to  impact  the  contribution  of  these
reviews to our CNMA, as we judged these weaknesses as unlikely to
impact study identification or data extraction for the contributing
reviews. However, they do highlight the need for Cochrane Reviews
in  this  area  to  address  these  oversights  moving  forward;  new
reporting standards should go some way to rectifying this. Though a

judgements  and  reasons 

GRADE 
(where
applicable) for each component can be found in Table 6 ('Summary
of  findings  table:  behavioural  and  motivational  components
of  behavioural  interventions  for  smoking  cessation'),  Table  7
('Summary  of  findings  table:  person  delivering  behavioural
interventions  for  smoking  cessation'),  and  Table  8  ('Summary  of
findings  table:  mode  of  delivery  of  behavioural  interventions  for
smoking cessation'). Of the 37 components evaluated, we judged
evidence  to  be  of  high  certainty  for  two  (guaranteed  financial
incentives,  counselling).  This  means  that  the  remainder  of  our
component  effect  estimates,  particularly  those  judged  to  be  of
low  or  very  low  certainty,  should  not  be  overinterpreted.  The
majority of our component effect estimates were downgraded one
or  two  levels  due  to  imprecision,  with  CrIs  spanning  no  effect
and clinically significant increases or reduction in the likelihood of
abstinence. In reality, this represents both issues with imprecision
and inconsistency as defined by GRADE, as in our model statistical
heterogeneity also widened CrIs. Therefore, though in the footnotes
we described downgrading based on imprecision in instances with
wide  CrIs,  such  'downgrades'  actually  may  capture  issues  with
both domains. Inconsistency, risk of bias, and publication bias also
reduced certainty for some components.

GRADE judgements made in the contributing reviews highlighted
similar issues to those in our component GRADE judgements, with
imprecision  and  risk  of  bias  the  main  reasons  for  downgrading
certainty in the evidence, and inconsistency and publication bias
also  reducing  certainty  in  some  cases.  As  seen  in  S7  Details  of
primary  analyses  from  included  studies,  of  the  74  analyses  on
which GRADE judgements were made within contributing reviews,
effect estimates from only 10 were judged to be of high certainty.
This  included  five  comparisons  which  directly  aligned  with  high-
certainty  evidence  from  component  effect  estimates  from  our
network  meta-analysis  (two  comparisons  relating  to  guaranteed
financial  incentives,  three  comparisons  related  to  counselling).
Evidence was also judged to be of high certainty, showing evidence
of a benefit across multiple studies, for:

• behavioural  interventions  as  adjuncts  to  pharmacotherapy

versus pharmacotherapy alone;

• self-help interventions delivered in the workplace compared to

less intensive or no support;

• brief behavioural interventions for people awaiting surgery;
• behavioural support for pregnant women who smoke, including
a subgroup of studies evaluating social support interventions.

Certainty was judged to be moderate for a further 33 comparisons,
and low or very low for the remainder.

Potential biases in the overview process

We  followed  Cochrane  methods,  which  are  considered  best
practice.  However,  potential  biases  in  our  processes  remain.  As
described above, we restricted this overview to Cochrane Reviews;
some relevant reviews and trials will have been missed as a result,
and we consider implications of this above (Overall completeness
and  applicability  of  evidence).  Our  approach  may  also  have
run  the  risk  of  propagating  data  extraction  errors  from  original
reviews. In addition, there may have been differences in the ways

review  authors  assessed  certainty.  Though  review  authors  will
have  all  used  the  same  guidelines  for  assessing  certainty,  and
though  Cochrane  editors  will  have  checked  assessments,  there
could  still  be  variability  in  judgements  between  author  teams,
including  for  example  in  what  was  considered  'null  effect'  or  'no
evidence  of  clinically  significant  difference'.  In  some  cases,  there
was significant overlap between reviews, which means that some
studies will be over-represented in our summary of findings across
reviews. However, each study only contributed once to our CNMA.
Additionally, some of the authors of this overview are authors of
included  reviews;  authors  of  included  reviews  were  not  involved
in  data  extraction  or  quality  assessment  for  their  own  reviews  to
attempt to mitigate any impact of this.

CNMA remains a relatively new method. We are not aware of any
established  or  agreed  way  to  judge  certainty,  present  'Summary
of  findings'  tables,  or  evaluate  publication  bias  within  CNMA.
We  therefore  consulted  with  experts  within  Cochrane  and  made
informed decisions about our approach to each of these areas (see
Methods); we are very cognisant that better methods may emerge
over  time,  and  hope  to  incorporate  them  in  the  future.  In  the
meantime, our approach means there may be some considerations
we  have  been  unable  to  fully  take  into  account.  In  regards  to
publication bias, where contributing reviews highlighted possible
or  suspected  publication  bias,  we  took  this  into  account  in  our
evaluation of certainty. It may be that, when comparing individual
components  to  one  another,  publication  bias  is  less  of  an  issue
as  studies  across  the  spectrum  will  represent  a  range  of  these
components, but it could be that effect estimates overall are more
positive  than  they  would  have  been  if  publication  bias  was  not
present. Furthermore, with CNMA a pragmatic decision had to be
made  regarding  which  components  to  include.  This  decision  can
have important implications for analyses and findings (Melendez-
Torres 2015). Our decisions were made a priori with support from
an advisory team and after reviewing relevant literature, but there
are other ways to subdivide interventions in this area, including by
behaviour change techniques (see Agreements and disagreements
with  other  studies  or  reviews).  It  would  be  difficult  to  conceive
a  meaningful  CNMA  that  would  include  our  37  components  and
the  93  behaviour  change  techniques  identified  by  Michie  and
colleagues (Michie 2013), so we hope that our approach can serve
as a companion approach to analyses using different frameworks
to characterise these interventions.

In  evaluating  the  impact  of  covariates,  some  important  caveats
should be reiterated.

• The  data  collected  on  population  characteristics  was  limited
to  the  extent  that  some  preplanned  variables  could  not  be
evaluated  (i.e.  baseline  motivation  to  quit)  and  some  had  to
be  more  crudely  defined  than  would  have  been  done  had
more  detail  been  available  (i.e.  SES),  meaning  that  absence
of  evidence  for  these  covariates  should  not  be  considered  as
evidence of absence.

• Our  analysis  of  intensity  variables  (duration  of  intervention,
mean  length  per  session,  number  of  sessions)  assumed
linearity. In reality, the relationship between these variables and
intervention  effectiveness  is  very  unlikely  to  be  linear,  as  at  a
certain  point,  for  example,  people  are  likely  to  not  continue
to  attend  sessions  (it  is  difficult  to  imagine  that  300  sessions
would  be  more  effective  than  200,  for  example).  In  a  previous
review (Hartmann-Boyce 2019), we had tried modelling intensity

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

using a non-linear method but the data did not support such an
approach, hence the assumption of linearity used in our present
model.

• Covariates were averaged across participants in the study, rather

than measured at the individual level.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

The nature of this review means results from our CNMA have been
compared to those from individual Cochrane Reviews as an integral
part  of  our  approach.  Where  applicable,  our  component  effect
estimates were consistent with those from relevant pair-wise meta-
analyses.

We are unaware of another directly comparable review. Worldwide,
guidelines recommend the use of behavioural support for smoking
cessation.  2008  US  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  (currently  in
the  process  of  being  updated  (Clinical  Practice  Guideline  2008)
include  many  of  the  reviews  covered  in  this  overview  (albeit
older versions) and recommend the provision of counselling with
practical  problem-solving  and  skills  training  components  (which
could  be  conceptualised  as  'how  to  quit'  and  'self-regulation'
components in our analysis). Like us, the Clinical Practice Guideline
2008  identifies  a  dose-response  relationship  regarding  session
length  and  number  of  sessions,  and  does  not  find  evidence  of  a
clinically significant difference in effect between face-to-face and
telephone support. In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidelines from 2018 recommend commissioners
ensure  behavioural  support  (defined  as  scheduled  face-to-face
meetings between someone who smokes and a counsellor trained
in  smoking  cessation,  typically  over  four  weeks)  and  very  brief
advice are available for adults who smoke, and that text-messaging
be  considered  as  an  adjunct  to  behavioural  support  (NICE  2018).
Both  US  and  UK  guidelines  recommend  quitlines,  but  both  the
Cochrane Review pair-wise meta-analysis and our CNMA found no
evidence  that  this  form  of  support  increased  abstinence  (Clinical
Practice Guideline 2008; NICE 2018). However, data in this area were
sparse  and  this  intervention  is  perhaps  better  evaluated  outside
of randomised controlled trials. Two reviews of smoking cessation
interventions  in  primary  care  supported  the  use  of  behavioural
interventions,  but  found  high  levels  of  statistical  heterogeneity
(Martín  Cantera  2015;  Papadakis  2010).  Martín  Cantera  2015  also
found  some  evidence  of  a  dose-response  effect  and  evidence  of
substantial heterogeneity.

The  above  guidelines  and  reviews  cover  multiple  areas  beyond
behavioural  support,  and  therefore  do  not  focus  on  intervention
components  in  the  same  level  of  detail  as  we  do  here.  The
most  relevant  work  we  are  aware  of  in  this  field  that  takes  such
in-depth  approach  is  a  systematic  review  evaluating  behaviour
change  techniques  used  in  randomised  controlled  trials  of
smoking  cessation  interventions.  Black  2020,  which  restricted
included  trials  to  those  that  were  biochemically  validated  and
used  a  date  restriction,  included  over  100  trials  and  found  that
techniques  targeting  associative  (cues  to  prompt  behaviour)  and
self-regulatory processes were associated with success in person-
delivered interventions, and that interventions including rewards
were  associated  with  success  in  written  interventions.  Mode  of
delivery  was  found  to  moderate  intervention  effects.  We  also
found  delivery  mode  was  associated  with  intervention  effects,
and  our  effect  estimate  for  self-regulation  content  suggested

benefit.  We  did  not  explicitly  evaluate  whether  interventions
addressed associative processes, though in Black 2020 associative
processes included rewards. Guaranteed financial incentives could
be  considered  a  form  of  reward,  and  we  found  high-certainty
evidence supporting their use.

Brief economic commentary

To  supplement  this  overview  and  CNMA,  we  sought  to  identify
economic  evaluations  which  compared  interventions  of  interest

to one another. A supplementary search for economic evaluations
(see  Search  methods  for  identification  of  reviews)  identified  23
relevant  studies  of  health  economic  evaluations  comparing  at
least two different behavioural interventions for smoking cessation
(see  Figure  8).  The  majority  of  studies  were  published  from  2010
onwards (range 1996 to 2019), were model-based, and came from
the US (see Table 9). The vast majority of comparisons were based
on  delivery  mode;  we  summarised  the  evidence  by  intervention
type below.

Eleven  studies  investigated  individual  face-to-face  counselling
(hereafter  individual  counselling).  Five  compared  individual  to
group  face-to-face  counselling  (hereafter  group  counselling):  two
found  individual  counselling  more  cost-effective  than  group
counselling  (Barnett  2013;  Cromwell  2001);  one  found  group
counselling more cost-effective than individual counselling (Bauld
2011),  and  two  found  individual  counselling  to  be  dominated
by  group  counselling  (i.e.  group  counselling  was  more  effective
and  less  costly)  (Boyd  2009;  Healey  2019).  Individual  counselling
delivered  by  community  pharmacy  personnel  was  more  cost-
effective  than  group  counselling  in  one  study  (Bauld  2011),  but
dominated by group counselling in another study (Boyd 2009). Two
studies compared individual counselling to telephone counselling
(An  2010;  Feenstra  2005).  Telephone  counselling  was  more  cost-
effective than individual counselling in one US study (An 2010), and
dominated by individual counselling in one Dutch study (Feenstra
2005). An 2010 also found individual counselling to be more cost-
effective  than  a  worksite  intervention  and  a  website,  and  Begh
2011 found a community-based outreach intervention to be more
cost-effective than individual counselling. Three studies compared
different  intensities  (minimal,  brief,  and  intensive)  of  individual
counselling  (Cromwell  2001;  Feenstra  2005;  Nohlert  2013).  Two
studies suggested intensive more cost-effective than minimal/brief
individual counselling (Cromwell 2001; Feenstra 2005), and another
study found low-intensity individual counselling to be dominated
by  a  high-intensity  individual  counselling  (Nohlert  2013).  In
two  studies  comparing  nurse-delivered  individual  counselling  to
telephone  counselling,  the  counselling  provided  by  the  nurses
was less effective and more costly (Berndt 2016; Tosanguan 2016).
Ruger  2008  compared  MI  delivered  via  individual  counselling  to
brief advice and found MI to be less effective despite being more
expensive.

Beyond comparisons with individual counselling, four comparisons
investigated  group  counselling.  Two  studies  comparing  group
counselling  with  print-based  self-help  materials  found  group
counselling more effective, but were inconsistent regarding relative
costs  (McGhan  1996;  Mudde  1996).  Calhoun  2016  found  group
counselling  combined  with  telephone  counselling  was  more
effective and less costly than an internet-based intervention. Dino
2008,  conducted  in  teenagers,  found  that  a  multi-component
same-gender  group  counselling  intervention  was  cost-effective
compared  with  a  mixed-gender  brief  group  counselling  and  self-
help intervention.

Outside  of  comparisons  with  face-to-face  interventions,  seven
comparisons  evaluated  telephone  counselling.  Three  found
telephone  counselling  more  effective  than  internet  or  website
interventions,  but  costs  were  higher  for  telephone  counselling
in  two  of  these  studies  (An  2010;  Javitz  2011),  and  surprisingly
lower in Calhoun 2016, in which telephone counselling was used in
conjunction with group counselling. Shearer 2006 found telephone
counselling dominated brief physician advice, while Feenstra 2005
found  the  opposite.  Lal  2014  found  more  intensive  telephone
counselling  to  be  effective  and  cost-saving  compared  to  brief
telephone counselling.

Three  remaining  studies  did  not 
involve  comparisons  with
counselling. Gilbert 2017 and Wu 2018 compared tailored against
standard  self-help  materials;  neither  found  tailored  self-help  to
be  cost-effective  in  the  short  term,  but  both  agreed  it  may  be
cost-effective in the long term. Popp 2018 provided evidence that

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

multiple  contests  were  cost-effective  when  compared  to  a  single
contest.

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  we  did  not  subject  any  of  the
23  identified  economic  evaluations  to  critical  appraisal  and  do
not  attempt  to  draw  any  firm  or  general  conclusions  regarding
relative  costs  or  efficiency  of  these  interventions  compared  to
one another. Because smoking is extremely costly (see Description
of  the  condition),  it  is  widely  acknowledged  that  any  effective
smoking cessation intervention will also very likely be cost-effective
(West 2007). However, evidence collected here did not consistently
suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation
was  more  cost-effective  than  another.  End  users  will  need  to
assess the extent to which methods and results of these economic
evaluations may apply to their own setting.

Implications for practice

• Behavioural  support  for  smoking  cessation  can  increase  quit
rates  at  six  months  or  longer.  The  evidence  is  strongest
for  counselling  and  guaranteed  financial  incentives.  Effect
estimates provided in our main analysis are based on delivery
of individual components; in practice any given intervention will
include multiple components which may increase effectiveness.
• There  is  moderate-certainty  evidence  suggesting  that  text-
message-based interventions and tailoring programme content
to  individuals  may  further  increase  quit  rates.  Interventions
focused  on  how  to  quit,  interventions  involving  motivational
content, delivery by a lay health advisor, and delivery via email
and audio recording were also associated with modest evidence
of benefit, again of moderate certainty.

• Behavioural  support 

increases  quit  rates  regardless  of
concurrent  use  of  smoking  cessation  pharmacotherapies,
though the effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation
is  slightly  less  pronounced  when  people  are  already  receiving
smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.

• There  is  no  evidence  of  an  excess  of  adverse  events  or  other
harms from behavioural interventions for smoking cessation.

Implications for research

• Despite  over  30  systematic  reviews  and  300  randomised
controlled  trials  contributing  data  to  this  review,  evidence  is
still  uncertain  in  some  areas.  This  is  particularly  the  case  for
emerging  technologies  (e.g.  text-message,  mobile  phone  app,
real-time video counselling).

• Future studies need to be well-conducted and well-described,
including adequate randomisation and allocation concealment.
Biochemical  validation  should  be  used  where  possible,  and
particularly  when  differential  levels  of  support  are  provided
between  intervention  and  comparator  arms.  Continuous  or
prolonged  abstinence  should  be  measured  where  feasible.
Interventions and comparators should be described in sufficient
detail  to 
identify  their  behavioural  content;  the  person
delivering  the  intervention;  and  the  length,  duration,  and
number of sessions provided. Populations should be described
in respect to key variables, including socioeconomic factors and
health  status.  More  studies  are  also  needed  in  lower-income
settings.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Cochrane Reviews in this area could be improved by ensuring all
key risk of bias domains are covered and that publication bias is
discussed and assessed where possible.

• Component network meta-analysis is a relatively new method,
and  consensus  needs  to  be  reached  on  best  ways  to  manage,
evaluate,  and  present  data  from  these  analyses,  particularly
within the framework of Cochrane Reviews. This should include
methods  for  assessing  certainty  and  presence  of  possible
publication bias.

are grateful to all of those who contributed their time, particularly
during the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous

authors  of  individual  reviews  which  were  eligible  for  inclusion
updated their reviews in tight timelines such that they could feed
in the most up-to-date information into this work; we are grateful
to them for doing so and for graciously responding to our frequent
requests for progress updates.

We thank Lee Bromhead and Sandra Wilcox for providing patient
and public perspectives on this work and the reviews contributing
to  this  work.  We  thank  Luke  Vale  from  the  Cochrane  Economics
Methods Group for advising on the methods planned for our brief
economic  commentary  and  members  of  the  Cochrane  Editorial
Team  for  their  support  on  methods  and  formatting  of  this  non-
standard and considerably larger than usual review. Thanks also go
to Andy McEwen from the National Centre for Smoking Cessation

No studies indicated that adverse events were related to the competition com-
ponent of the intervention.

No adverse events were considered plausibly related to the behavioural com-
ponent of the intervention.

11 studies reported the number of participants who reported adverse events
or serious adverse events during the prequit period, and 7 studies reported
prequit withdrawal symptoms. For serious adverse events, either none were
reported or rates were low and well-balanced between trial arms. Adverse
events were measured in studies where nicotine replacement therapy was
used prequit and appeared to be those usually attributed to these medica-
tions. Data on withdrawal and craving were sparse and conclusions varied
making it impossible to draw conclusions. No studies reported adverse effects
of behavioural support, however.

—

Some evidence on the likelihood of the participants 'gaming' to receive un-
merited rewards.

Review authors gave no indication that these adverse events were related to
Internet-based smoking cessation interventions.

Vodopivec-Jamsek 2012

Study looked for differences in finger and joint pain and car crashes resulting
from texting. They reported no difference between study groups.

Network meta-analysis 'Summary of findings' table definitions

*Estimates are reported as odds ratio. Results are expressed in credibility interval as opposed to the confidence intervals since a Bayesian analysis has been conducted.

**Anticipated absolute effect compared two risks by calculating the difference between the risks of the intervention component with the risk of the minimal intervention
comparator (assumed to be 60 per 1000 based on mean quit rate in minimal intervention arms).

CrI: credibility interval; OR: odds ratio; RCT: randomised controlled trial.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.

Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.

Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

aDowngraded one level due to imprecision: CrIs encompassed no difference as well as clinically significant benefit.
bDowngraded two levels due to imprecision: CrIs encompassed clinically significant benefit as well as clinically significant harm.
cDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: 5/11 studies at high risk of bias, and pair-wise meta-analyses from original review highlight key issues with risk of bias (Barnes 2019).
dDowngraded one level due to possible publication bias as highlighted by funnel plot in original review (Ussher 2019).
eDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: majority of studies at high risk of bias; and original review highlighted risk of bias as key issue (Fanshawe 2019).
fDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: highlighted as important issue in original review (Fanshawe 2019).

Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

aDowngraded two levels due to imprecision: CrIs encompass clinically significant benefit as well as clinically significant harm.
bDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: pair-wise meta-analyses indicated substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity (Rice 2017).
cDowngraded one level due to imprecision: CrIs encompass no difference as well as clinically significant harm.
dDowngraded one level due to indirectness: coding of 'stop smoking advisor' was based on author descriptions in individual studies and includes large level of variability across
different settings.
eDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: majority of studies contributing data judged to be at high risk of bias; removing these reduced the point estimate.
fDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: removing studies at high risk of bias clinically significantly decreased point estimate.
gDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: risk of bias downgraded 1 level in pair-wise comparison (Carson-Chahhoud 2019); removing studies at high risk of bias changed
direction of point estimate in component network meta-analysis.
hDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: component effect estimate could not be computed in risk of bias sensitivity analysis due to so few studies at low/unclear risk of bias
contributing data for this component.
iDowngraded one level due to risk of publication bias: authors of original review consider literature at risk of publication bias (Carr 2012).
jDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: original review highlights substantial issues regarding risk of bias (Barnes 2019).
kDowngraded one level due to possible publication bias as highlighted by funnel plot in original review (Ussher 2019).

(–4 to 93)

Network meta-analysis 'Summary of findings' table definitions

*Estimates are reported as odds ratio. Results are expressed in credibility interval as opposed to the confidence intervals since a Bayesian analysis has been conducted.

**Anticipated absolute effect compared two risks by calculating the difference between the risks of the intervention component with the risk of the minimal intervention
comparator (assumed to be 60 per 1000 based on mean quit rate in minimal intervention arms).

CrI: credibility interval; OR: odds ratio; RCT: randomised controlled trial.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.

Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.

Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

aDowngraded one level due to imprecision: CrIs encompassed no difference as well as clinically significant benefit.
bDowngraded one level due to risk of bias: 26/75 trials contributed data at high risk of bias, and pair-wise meta-analyses downgraded based on risk of bias issues (Stead 2017).
cDowngraded two levels due to inconsistency: component effect estimates not consistent with high- and moderate-certainty evidence from pair-wise meta-analyses suggesting
clinically significant benefit of face-to-face and individual delivery modes (Lancaster 2017; Stead 2017).
dDowngraded one level due to imprecision: CrIs encompassed no difference as well as clinically significant harm.
eDowngraded two levels due to imprecision: CrIs encompassed clinically significant benefit as well as clinically significant harm.
fDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: substantial unexplained heterogeneity detected in pair-wise comparison (I2 = 52%) (Matkin 2019).
gDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: pair-wise meta-analyses indicated multiple analyses with substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity (Taylor 2017).
hDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: substantial unexplained heterogeneity detected in pair-wise comparison (I2 = 71%) (Whittaker 2019).
iDowngraded one level due to inconsistency: pair-wise meta-analysis indicated substantial heterogeneity (Whittaker 2019).
jDowngraded two levels due to inconsistency: component effect estimates not consistent with evidence from pair-wise meta-analysis (two trials) suggesting clinically significant
benefit of quitline access (Matkin 2019).

Appendix 2. Contour plot

Figure 7 displays a contour plot. Each point represents an individual study arm. Leverage is mapped on the y-axis; studies with higher
leverage are those with more extreme values for contributing covariates. Deviance residuals are plotted on the x-axis. Points in red are from
studies at high risk of bias, points in yellow are from studies at unclear risk of bias, and points in green are from studies at low risk of bias.
Studies with larger deviance residuals indicate larger differences between predicted and actual values, with studies on the right having
lower quit rates and studies on the left having higher quit rates than would be predicted. We used this plot to identify studies contributing
the most deviance, and performed a sensitivity analysis removing these studies.

The  methods  section  was  updated  to  clarify  the  following  regarding  inclusion  criteria  for  studies  in  the  network  meta-analysis:  we
excluded interventions tailored to specific population groups as these violate the assumption of joint-randomisability; excluded historical
interventions  which  would  not  plausibly  be  offered  in  the  present  day  (i.e.  aversive  smoking);  excluded  interventions  which  targeted
multiple lifestyle changes (e.g. dietary change as well as smoking cessation); and excluded interventions targeted at smoking outcomes
other than abstinence (i.e. smoking reduction).

We had originally planned to create GRADE ratings for reviews that did not contain these; we later deemed this inappropriate due to our
limited knowledge of the evidence base within these reviews.

We had originally planned to use the CINeMA tool to assesses certainty in our network meta-analysis findings, but were unable to do so as
this tool is not yet designed to be compatible with component network meta-analyses (cinema.ispm.ch/).

We had originally stated we would run sensitivity analyses excluding studies in which cessation was not biochemically validated. As this
is taken into account in our risk of bias assessments, for which we have run a prespecified sensitivity analysis, we did not run a separate
sensitivity analysis looking just at this variable.

We conducted three post hoc analyses to explore the impact of reducing possible causes of variation in our network meta-analysis.
