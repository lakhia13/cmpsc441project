Abstract
Purpose of Review Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a com-
mon mental health threat among adolescents. This review
aims to present the current literature on epidemiology, etiolo-
gy, and therapeutic approaches with a focus on the period of
adolescence.
Recent Findings NSSI is widespread among adolescents both
in community as well as in clinical settings with lifetime prev-
alence rates between 17 and 60% in recent studies. It is influ-
enced by multiple factors including social contagion, interper-
sonal stressors, neurobiological background, as well as emo-
tional dysregulation and adverse experiences in childhood.
Summary There is still a lack of studies regarding the psycho-
therapeutic as well as the psychopharmacological treatment of
NSSI in adolescence. Furthermore, sufficient evidence for
prevention programs is missing.

excludes accidental and indirect self-injurious behaviors (e.g.,
disordered eating or drug abuse), suicidal behaviors, as well as
socially accepted behaviors like tattooing, piercing, or religious
rituals. The most common methods endorsed in are cutting,
scratching, hitting or banging, carving, and scraping [2].
NSSI is particularly present in mid-adolescence [3] and there-
fore presents a major concern for child and adolescent psychi-
atrists and psychotherapists, youth welfare workers, teachers,
and other professionals working with adolescents, as well as for
families of affected youth. In recent years, the body of research
on NSSI has rapidly grown. The following review provides an
overview of current literature concerning the epidemiology,
etiology, risk-factors, and functions of NSSI. It also presents
recent findings and recommendations for the treatment of NSSI
in adolescence. In the last chapter of this review, the ongoing
discussion of including NSSI as an independent disorder in the
DSM-5 [4] is reflected on.

Epidemiology

Introduction

Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the intentional,
self-inflicted damage to the surface of the body without suicidal
intent, which is not socially sanctioned [1]. This definition

The first study on the prevalence of NSSI in a school sample
of adolescents was published in 2002 [5], which found a prev-
alence of “self-mutilation” of around 14%. Although there is
only little knowledge about the prevalence of NSSI before the
early 2000s, prevalence rates have been rather stable across
publications from different countries within the past 15 years
[6(cid:129)(cid:129)] when controlling for methodological differences.
Methodological differences associated with differences in
prevalence rates were for example assessment tools, definition
of NSSI, and incentives for participation. International life-
time prevalence rates in adolescents of 17–18% for at least
one incidence of NSSI were found in two independent sys-
tematic reviews [6(cid:129)(cid:129), 7]. Rates of adolescents meeting DSM-5
criteria (see below) are lower and range around 1.5 to 6.7% in

child and adolescent community samples [2]. In adolescent
psychiatric samples, prevalence rates of NSSI have found to
be as high as 60% for one incident of NSSI and around 50%
for repetitive NSSI [8]. NSSI not only can occur in the broad
context of psychiatric disorders (affective disorders, BPD,
substance abuse, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disor-
ders) but can also occur without comorbid psychiatric diagno-
sis [9–11]. To date, only few studies on the longitudinal de-
velopment of NSSI exist. One Australian longitudinal study
was able to show that self-harming behaviors (including sui-
cidal behaviors) significantly decrease from adolescence
(around 15 years of age) to young adulthood (around 29 years
of age) [12(cid:129)]. A systematic review on longitudinal studies on
NSSI showed that prevalence rates of NSSI peak around mid-
adolescence (around 15–16 years) and decline towards late
adolescence (around 18 years) [3].

Although NSSI decreases significantly in late adolescence,
adolescents with repetitive NSSI seem to be at high risk to be
continuing dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, even
after cessation of NSSI. One recent study [13(cid:129)(cid:129)] was able to
show that adolescents with ceased repetitive NSSI were very
likely to show high levels of substance misuse. Furthermore,
NSSI is a significant risk factor for suicide attempts [14] and
suicides [15]. A recent study reported increased risk of suicide
in individuals cutting themselves on other body areas than
arms or wrists [16(cid:129)]. An association of earlier age of onset
with an increased risk of developing BPD later on in life
was found in a follow-up study in young adults who had
engaged in NSSI as adolescents [17].

In summary, NSSI is very present internationally in adoles-
cent populations both in community as well as in clinical
samples. Even though NSSI seems to cease in late adoles-
cence or early adulthood in most affected persons, the behav-
ior has high clinical implications due to the various long-term
risks involved.

Etiology and Risk Factors

The following sections describe specific risk factors that have
been identified regarding the development of NSSI and are
part of its etiology. In a recent meta-analysis on risk factors of
NSSI, overall risk factors with the strongest effects (OR > 3.0)
included a former history of NSSI, cluster B personality dis-
orders, and hopelessness. Associations for an OR > 2 were
found for prior suicidal thought/behaviors, exposure to peer
NSSI, patient prediction (self-reported likelihood of engaging
in NSSI in the future), and abuse [18]. However, the overall
weighted mean ratio was rather low (OR = 1.56 and OR = 1.16
after adjusting for publication bias) and confidence intervals
(especially for cluster B personality disorders) were quite
high. Furthermore, these results were moderated by NSSI
measurement, sample age and type (clinical or general

population), and prediction case measurement (binary or con-
tinuous). Therefore, results of the meta-analysis have to be
interpreted with care and the authors call the need for stan-
dardized NSSI measurements in longitudinal studies on NSSI.

Demographic Factors

As described above, NSSI most commonly occurs in early to
mid-adolescence and commonly ceases in young adulthood.
Adolescence is a vulnerable phase for developing NSSI, as
elevated levels of impulsivity and emotional reactivity are
present due to brain developmental processes [19]. Apart from
age, female gender has been identified as a risk factor for
NSSI. A recent meta-analysis [20(cid:129)] reported that female ado-
lescents and adults were more likely to engage in NSSI than
males. This difference was larger in clinical populations as
compared to studies conducted in the general population.
Female participants are also more likely to engage in cutting
as a method of NSSI, as are males [21(cid:129)]. In addition, Barrocas
and colleagues [22] found cutting to be the most common
method for girls and hitting against a wall to be the most
common method for boys. Regarding cognitive factors, in a
study including 4810 adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, higher
IQ was associated with a higher risk of engaging in NSSI [23].

Social Factors

In a prospective longitudinal study across 2.5 years, Hankin
and colleagues [24] were able to show dysfunctional relation-
ships to be a significant risk factors for NSSI. In the same line,
bullying has been shown to be a risk factor for the develop-
ment of NSSI repeatedly. Lereya and colleagues [25] found
being bullied by peers in childhood and early adolescence to
be a greater risk for self-harm in adulthood than being
maltreated by parents in two large longitudinal samples
(Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children in the
UK (ALSPAC) and Great Smoky Mountains Study in the
US (GSMS)). A large European study (N = 12,068 adolescents
from 11 countries) found bullying to be highly associated with
engaging in self-harming behaviors [26]. NSSI being associ-
ated to social contagion was found in 16 studies in a system-
atic review [27]. However, five of the studies conducted in this
review had been published more than 20 years ago, with major
methodological flaws. Results from this review suggest that
particularly the initial engagement in NSSI might be highly
influenced by social contagion (i.e., friends or acquaintances
engaging in NSSI, or being exposed to NSSI in the media,
especially the internet), while the maintenance of NSSI is very
likely rather be related to intrapersonal functions (see below)
which develop over time. In the line of social influences, iden-
tifying with a certain youth subculture (i.e., gothic or emo) has
shown to increase the risk of engaging in NSSI [28, 29].
Another aspect of social influences is the sexuality of a person

Curr Psychiatry Rep  (2017) 19:20 

Page 3 of 8  20 

in association with norms and values the person has internal-
ized or is common in society. A number of studies have shown
non-heterosexual orientation to be strongly linked to the risk
of engaging in NSSI [30].

Media Influence

Regarding the worldwide spread of NSSI, internet use and
especially the use of social media has been of increasing
interest to researchers to understand dissemination of
NSSI content. It has been shown that NSSI-related search
terms were sought 42 million times per year on Google
[31]. The top 100 YouTube videos with an NSSI content
were viewed over two million times, with 90% of non-
character videos showing NSSI photographs and 28% of
character videos showing NSSI action [32]. In an analysis
of the “Yahoo! Answers” database, it was shown that
most questions related to NSSI (30.6%) were posted with
the intent of seeking validation for NSSI [33], thus pro-
viding a possible explanation for the reasons of posting
NSSI content. This notion is further supported by a recent
study, stating that one third of youth (14 to 25 years) with
a history of NSSI reported online help-seeking for NSSI
[34]. Therefore, the online activity regarding NSSI can be
viewed as beneficial (e.g., decreasing social isolation, re-
ceiving encouragement for recovery, reducing urges to
self-injure) or potentially harmful (e.g., triggering urges
to self-injure, social reinforcement of NSSI) [35]. Future
research will have to explore which measures need to be
taken in order to use the beneficial potential of online
resources while restricting harmful consequences.

Adverse Childhood Events

The risk for engaging in NSSI seems to be elevated by the
experience of adverse childhood events like parental neglect,
abuse, or deprivation [36, 37]. However, recent research pro-
vides more differentiated findings on the experience of ad-
verse childhood events. In a study by Thomassin et al. [38],
only child emotional abuse remained significantly associated
with NSSI, when different types of adverse childhood experi-
ences were analyzed simultaneously. This is in line with a
review and a meta-analysis, finding the experience of sexual
abuse to be only moderately linked to the development of
NSSI [39, 40]. In another study, only indirect childhood mal-
treatment (i.e., witnessing domestic violence) was significant-
ly associated with NSSI, and direct forms of maltreatment
(physical or sexual abuse) were not. However, emotional
abuse was not assessed in this study. Furthermore, a strong
association of increased parental critique or parental apathy
has been shown repeatedly [8, 41].

Neurobiological Factors

Research on neurobiological factors regarding the develop-
ment and continuation of self-injurious behaviors has mostly
been conducted in adults with borderline personality disor-
der [42–44]. However, some studies have focused on neu-
robiological alterations in adolescents engaging in NSSI.
However, since none of those studies are longitudinal stud-
ies, results should be interpreted with care and rather repre-
sent correlates with NSSI than risk factors. As NSSI is often
associated with stressful events or situations (see below),
and the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis is
involved in coping with stressful situations [45], studies test-
ing a relationship between NSSI and the HPA axis have
been conducted, all showing an altered pattern of HPA axis
regulation. A recent study measured salivary and hair corti-
sol in 26 adolescents with NSSI and compared them to
healthy controls. Although no alterations were found with
regards to hair cortisol, individuals with NSSI showed
higher cortisol awakening responses [46]. In another recent
study, the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was used
to evaluate HPA axis response in adolescent girls with de-
pressive symptomatology, half of whom showed a history of
NSSI. Individuals with NSSI showed lower post DST corti-
sol levels, indicative of an efficient negative feedback loop
[47]. One study by Kaess et al. [48] found decreased levels
of cortisol in adolescents with NSSI in response to the Trier
social stress test, which could point towards a hypo-
responsiveness of the HPA axis in adolescents with NSSI
in acutely stressful situations. Another study focusing on
socially stressful situations investigated differences in the
neural processing of social exclusion using functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, Groschwitz
et al. [49(cid:129)] found differentiated processing of social exclu-
sion in depressed adolescents with NSSI as compared to
adolescents with mere major depression and healthy con-
trols. Those differences were mainly prevalent in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (vlPFC), which might point towards adolescents with
NSSI being more affected by social exclusion. These studies
add further evidence to the link between interpersonal
stressors and NSSI, which was also addressed in one of
the few studies searching for genetic factors in NSSI. A gene
× environment interaction was shown in two independent
adolescent community samples. Adolescents, who carried
at least one short allele of the transporter-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR) of the SLC6A4 gene coding for the
serotonin transporter and were exposed to severe interper-
sonal stress, showed an elevated likelihood of engaging in
NSSI [50]. In another study applying fMRI in adolescents
with NSSI, differentiations in the limbic system as compared
to healthy controls were found when processing emotional
stimuli [51].

Regarding the perception and processing of physical pain,
results from adolescent samples have so far shown rather
inconsistent results. One study in adolescents with BPD
showed elevated pain thresholds [52]. In another study in
youth (aged 16–24) with comparable rates of BPD in both
the NSSI and the clinical control group, no differentiation
with regard to pain threshold or processing of physical pain
was shown [53]. However, differences during pain offset
were shown in behavioral data (higher reported feelings of
relief), as well as in neuroimaging data (in reward-related
areas [53]). Pain offset relief (i.e., the removal of physical
pain) has been associated with a simultaneous beneficial
effect on emotions [54]. This could point towards pain offset
playing an important role in the automatic negative rein-
forcement of NSSI (see below). On a neurobiological level,
differentiations in the processing of physical pain might be
related to decreased levels of β-endorphin and Met-
enkephalin in the liquor cerebrospinalis, which in turn might
be related to deficits in the reaction to external stressors in
patients with NSSI [55(cid:129)].

In summary, adolescent age, female gender, social or me-
dial contact with NSSI, bullying, and adverse childhood ex-
periences like emotional abuse or neglect seem to be major
risk factors for the development of NSSI. Findings from neu-
robiological studies point towards abnormalities in the HPA
axis, the endogenous opioid system, as well as the neural
processing of emotionally, socially, or physically adverse
stimuli.

Functions of NSSI

The four-factor model [56] is often referred to when describ-
ing functionalities of NSSI. This model describes intraperson-
al (“automatic”) as well as interpersonal (“social”) processes,
which can both be positively and negatively reinforcing the
behavior. For example, in the line of automatic negative rein-
forcement, NSSI serves the function of diminishing negative
feelings or thoughts (i.e., anger, tension), while automatic pos-
itive reinforcement describes the experience of pleasant or
positive feelings or thoughts during or after engaging in
NSSI (i.e., feeling alive). Social positive reinforcement de-
scribes reinforcing social interaction (i.e., getting attention or
sending a message to others), while social negative reinforce-
ment describes NSSI as a means to escape unpleasant social
interactions (i.e., ending an argument, not attending sports
class).

Most studies have found automatic negative reinforcement
to be the most common function when endorsing in NSSI [17,
57, 58]. Studies using economical momentary assessment
(EMA) have shown increased feelings of loneliness, sadness,
and feeling overwhelmed before engaging in NSSI [59]. In a
systematic review, Hamza and Willoughby [60] found the

administration of physical pain to be associated with a de-
crease in negative affect in all studies.

Therapy for NSSI in Adolescence

Surgical Treatment

In more severe forms of NSSI, a surgical treatment of
wounds can be necessary. In those cases, a good cooper-
ation between different professions is very beneficial (giv-
en the consent of the patients and their caregivers).
Furthermore, negative emotions towards NSSI or the pa-
tient should not be displayed. For example, one study [61]
showed that negative reactions of adults towards NSSI of
an adolescent can lead to avoidance of help-seeking in the
future.

Psychotherapy

Even though the number of publications on treatment spe-
cifically designed for NSSI is rather low, there is steadily
growing evidence of the effectiveness of psychotherapeu-
tic treatments for NSSI in adolescents. A recent systemat-
ic review mainly identified dialectical behavioral therapy
for adolescents (DBT-A), cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT), and mentalization-based treatment for adolescents
(MBT-A) to be effective for the therapy of NSSI in ado-
lescence [62(cid:129)]. In a recent randomized controlled study
[63], reduction of NSSI was found to be steady 1 year
after DBT-A. The reduction was significantly larger than
the reduction of NSSI in a control condition. Significant
reduction of NSSI was also shown in a pilot study on
DBT-A [64]. A study on a CBT group treatment (“cutting
down”) showed significant reduction of NSSI [65]. This
program is also currently being evaluated in a larger ran-
domized controlled trial in Germany [66]. MBT-A also
showed significant reduction of self-harming behaviors
[67] after 12 months of treatment.

In total, no specific treatment showed to be superior to
others, or can be recommended as primary option at this stage,
as the number of published studies is very small [62(cid:129)]. The
recently developed German clinical guidelines for the treat-
ment of NSSI [68, 69] therefore defined core elements of
psychotherapeutic treatment of NSSI in adolescence.
Treatments should include the following: establishment of
treatment motivation, psychoeducation, identification of fac-
tors which trigger or maintain NSSI, conveying alternative
behavioral skills to NSSI and conflict resolution strategies,
and adherence to guidelines for treating comorbid mental
health issues.

Treatment with Psychiatric Medication

The evidence of psychiatric medication used for the treat-
ment of NSSI in adolescents is still insufficient [70].
Therefore, no such treatment can be recommended.
However, sedative medication might be used when a pa-
tient is presenting with very high tension in an inpatient
setting.

are a number of diseases that are listed in classification
systems (e.g., certain types of cancer), for which no ef-
fective treatments have yet been developed.

Overall, despite some risks involved with defining
NSSI as independent disorder, and criteria still being in
need of further validation, this definition could lead to
enhancements in communication, research, prevention,
and intervention.

NSSI as Independent Diagnosis

Conclusion

To date, NSSI is only defined as a symptom of borderline
personality disorder (BPD) or as “intentional self-injury
with a sharp object” (X78) in the classification system
of the World Health Organization (ICD-10). In the
DSM-5 [4], NSSI has been suggested as possible indepen-
dent diagnostic entity (NSSID) in section 3, condition for
further study. The repetitive nature of NSSI (at least five
times within the last year), as well as its functionalities
(i.e., to reduce negative emotional states), is included in
this definition. Furthermore, the definition clearly distin-
guishes NSSI from suicidality, and therefore also from the
definition of “deliberate self-harm” (DSH), which in-
cludes all self-injurious acts, despite their intention (sui-
cidal or non-suicidal). In recent years, a number of studies
have tried to validate NSSID criteria (e.g., [9, 10, 58,
71–73]. However, validation of NSSID is still in progress
and has led to an ongoing discussion. Some researchers
support the inclusion of NSSID, as NSSI can lead to im-
pairment without comorbid psychiatric disorders [9, 74]
and results of several studies suggest that it might occur
independently of BPD in a large number of adolescents
(e.g., [10]). Defining NSSID could lead to enhanced de-
velopment and evaluation of specific treatments for NSSI,
as well as monetary means to treat NSSI without comor-
bid psychopathology in health insurance systems of many
countries [75, 76]. However, other researchers (e.g., [77,
78]) criticize the defined dichotomy between non-suicidal
and suicidal behaviors. An alternative suggestion is to
view NSSI and suicide on a continuum of self-harming
behaviors. The argument is that with a dichotomous per-
ception, practitioners might underestimate the risks in-
volved with NSSI [78]. Furthermore, they see a risk of
stigmatizing a large number of adolescents as “mentally
ill,” even though NSSI ceases in late adolescence in most
cases. Furthermore, it has been argued that also non-
suicidal self-poisonings do exists, which would not be
adequately addressed in the recent DSM-5 definition of
NSSID [79]. Another criticism of NSSID is that there is
still no sufficient evidence of effective treatments, and it
could be problematic to define a disorder without specific
treatments in place. However, one could argue that there

Epidemiological studies have shown that NSSI is a major
concern in adolescence. Despite its cessation in late adoles-
cence to early adulthood, the risk for long-term mental health
issues, suicidality, and engaging in risk-taking behaviors is
elevated in individuals, who engaged in NSSI during their
adolescent years repeatedly. While a number of studies sup-
port bullying, negative social interactions, and emotional
childhood abuse to be risk factors for NSSI, childhood sexual
and physical abuse show much weaker evidence.
Neurobiological findings point towards alterations in the
HPA-axis and the endogenous opioid system, as well as the
neural processing of emotional stimuli. Therapy for NSSI has
greatly been derived from therapy approaches for BPD.
Despite DBT-A, MBT-A, and CBT showing good effective-
ness, more studies are necessary to validate those findings. So
far, there is no sufficient evidence for pharmacological treat-
ments for NSSI in adolescents.

In summary, while to date there is good international
evidence on the prevalence of NSSI in adolescence, as
well as the functionalities of NSSI, much research is still
needed on the etiology (especially the neurobiological as-
pects) and treatment of NSSI in adolescence, including
possible short-term interventions for less severe NSSI
symptomatology. The ongoing debate of including NSSI
as independent disorder in the DSM-5 has sparked new
research and could significantly improve knowledge about
the etiology, phenomenology, and treatment of NSSI.
