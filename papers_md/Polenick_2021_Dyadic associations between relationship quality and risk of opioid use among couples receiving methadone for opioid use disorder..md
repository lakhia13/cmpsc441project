Abstract

Background: Social relationships may serve as both protective factors and risk factors for opioid 
use (nonmedical prescription opioid or illicit opioid use) among patients receiving methadone for 
opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet little is known about how relationship quality is linked to 
outcomes among couples receiving methadone. We evaluated the links between relationship 
quality and risk of opioid use among couples in which both partners received methadone.

Methods: Participants included 53 heterosexual married or cohabiting couples aged 18 and older 
who were drawn from two opioid treatment programs in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Both 
members of the couple completed a self-administered survey assessing their sociodemographic 
information, relationship and treatment characteristics, and risk of opioid use.

Results: Roughly half of women (47.2%) and men (52.8%) had a moderate to high risk of 
nonmedical prescription opioid use and almost two-thirds (64.2%) had a moderate to high risk of 
street opioid use. Risk of street opioid use was highly correlated within couples. Actor-partner 
interdependence models revealed that when women reported higher positive relationship quality,

they had a lower risk of nonmedical prescription opioid use and their partners had a lower risk of 
street opioid use. Negative relationship quality was not significantly linked to risk of opioid use.

Conclusions: Couples in which both partners receive methadone for OUD may be at risk of 
return to use, and positive partner relationships may play a role in lowering this risk. Women’s 
perceptions of relationship quality might be a particularly important target for clinical care and 
interventions.

Introduction

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major public health concern in the United States, with an 
estimated 130 Americans dying from an opioid overdose each day (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2018). Methadone is an evidence-based agonist therapy for treating 
OUD delivered through opioid treatment programs. Although methadone is effective, it is 
often stressful and may place a strain on patients and their close relationships (Amato et al., 
2015; Fei et al., 2016; Wittenberg et al., 2016; Yee et al., 2016). Relationships with spouses 
or romantic partners can lower or increase substance use (e.g., Fairbairn and Cranford, 2016; 
Heinz et al., 2009; Tracy et al., 2005). However, little is known about the link between 
partner relationship quality and risk of opioid use among couples receiving methadone for 
OUD. Understanding how partner relationships are associated with couples’ risk of return to 
use would inform clinical care and interventions. In this study, we evaluated the links 
between partner relationship quality and risk of nonmedical prescription opioid and street 
opioid use among heterosexual couples in which both partners received methadone.

According to interdependence theory (Rusbult and Van Lange, 2008), members of a couple 
affect one another’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Consistent with this perspective, 
spouses or romantic partners are a prominent source of health-related influence across 
multiple contexts, including substance use (Derrick et al., 2019; Meyler et al. 2007). Specific 
to methadone treatment, partners tend to be similar in their use of illicit opioids (Gogineni et 
al. 2001; Powers and Anglin, 1996) and methadone dose (Huang et al., 2018). Receiving 
methadone through opioid treatment programs can also have a negative impact on both 
partners’ well-being and quality of life (Wittenberg et al., 2016). This treatment can be 
highly demanding and long-term, often requiring years of methadone dispensing and 
laboratory testing for illicit substance use (World Health Organization, 2009). Additionally, 
methadone presents a host of obstacles that are psychological (e.g., perceived stigma, 
persistence to continue treatment) and behavioral (e.g., drug-free lifestyle changes, sexual 
dysfunction as a side effect), which impact the everyday lives of patients and their partners 
(Teoh et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2016; Wittenberg et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2017). Partners 
who receive methadone for OUD at the same time may also differ in their motivation and/or 
ability to remain drug-free (Cavacuiti, 2004; Simmons and McMahon, 2012; Simmons and 
Singer, 2006), and this may increase stress and make treatment adherence more difficult. 
Given the interdependence within couples, it is important to consider the role of both 
partners’ views of partner relationship quality (i.e., positive and negative aspects of partner

relationships) in opioid use risk among couples receiving care through opioid treatment 
programs. Partner relationship quality may be especially important when both partners 
receive methadone because they serve as a critical source of support or strain that shapes the 
course of treatment and recovery (Cavacuiti, 2004; Simmons and McMahon, 2012; 
Simmons and Singer, 2006).

Positive aspects of the partner relationship may promote treatment adherence and drug 
abstinence (De Maeyer et al., 2011; Derrick et al., 2019; Heinz et al., 2009). For example, 
previous research has found that greater relationship closeness is linked to a lower 
percentage of cocaine-positive and heroin-positive urine samples over a 35-week period 
among married individuals in treatment (Heinz et al., 2009). By contrast, negative 
components of the partner relationship might exacerbate substance use and raise the risk of 
return to use (Derrick et al., 2019; Fairbairn and Cranford, 2016; Tracy et al., 2005). For 
instance, intimate partner violence has been associated with increased drug use among 
individuals receiving methadone for OUD (de Dios et al., 2014), and arguments with 
partners about drug use are a common source of strain that may contribute to the 
perpetuation and maintenance of illicit opioid use patterns (Cavacuiti, 2004; Simmons and 
McMahon, 2012; Simmons and Singer, 2006). OUD may also hinder communication 
patterns in close relationships, which in turn exacerbates feelings of social isolation 
(Crowley and Miller, 2020). Taken together, this research highlights the importance of 
considering both partners’ views of positive and negative relationship quality and their links 
to opioid use risk among couples receiving methadone for OUD.

To provide targeted clinical care and interventions, it is important to consider potential 
gender differences in the dyadic links between perceptions of relationship quality and opioid 
use risk among couples receiving methadone for OUD. Compared with men, women 
typically encounter more interpersonal strain (Birditt and Fingerman, 2003; Mohr et al., 
2003) and are more likely to seek social support in the context of substance use (Bonin et al., 
2000; Rahimi et al. 2019). Among patients receiving methadone for OUD, women are also 
faced with greater challenges that are socioeconomic (e.g., unemployment, lower incomes), 
health-related (e.g., more comorbidities), and interpersonal (e.g., less partner and family 
support) relative to men (Bawor et al., 2015; Grella et al., 2003; Puigdollers et al., 2004; 
Riehman et al., 2003; Vigna-Taglianti et al., 2016). These heightened challenges and the 
more central role of interpersonal relationships among women suggest that partner 
relationship quality may be more likely to mitigate or intensify opioid use risk during 
methadone treatment for OUD among women than men in heterosexual couples.

The present study adds to the literature by evaluating the association between partner 
relationship quality and risk of using opioids among couples in which both partners receive 
methadone. We hypothesized that own and partner reports of more positive partner 
relationship quality would be linked to lower risk of nonmedical prescription opioid and 
street opioid use. We also hypothesized that own and partner reports of more negative 
partner relationship quality would be linked to higher risk of nonmedical prescription opioid 
and street opioid use. We further predicted that these links would be stronger for women 
than for men.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Sample and Procedures

Page 4

A total of 144 patients were recruited from two large Opioid Treatment Programs in Rhode 
Island (n = 84) and Massachusetts (n = 60). Clinical staff assisted in the recruitment of 
married or cohabiting partners who were both currently receiving methadone (i.e., 72 patient 
dyads). All patients in these programs also received at least one other group, individual, or 
couple therapy. Individuals under age 18 or not fluent in English were excluded. Both 
partners typically came together for methadone dosing, and clinicians shared fliers with 
couples who were interested in the study. Although response rates were not collected for this 
convenience sample, we estimate that at least 80% of these couples agreed to participate. 
Couples in which both partners consented to participate were enrolled. During scheduled 
clinic visits, participants were asked to complete an in-person self-administered survey and 
an informed consent document. Survey completion was monitored by the principal 
investigator (B.P.C). Couples completed the surveys at the same time in separate rooms. 
Both partners were asked to keep their responses confidential. There was no identifying 
information included on the survey. After survey completion, each participant received a 
$20.00 gift card. On average, the survey took 20–30 minutes to complete. This study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Rhode Island.

Figure 1 depicts the selection of the analytic sample. Six individuals in three same-sex 
couples were removed to allow for testing of gender differences within couples and because 
the small number of same-sex couples did not permit a meaningful comparison with 
heterosexual couples. Of the remaining 138 individuals in 69 couples, one had missing data 
on partner negative relationship quality; two had missing data on relationship type and 
relationship duration; 15 had missing data on nonmedical prescription opioid use risk; and 
14 had missing data on street opioid use risk. The analytic sample included 106 individuals 
in 53 couples with complete data on study variables (see Table 1). Relative to individuals 
who were removed because of missing data, individuals in this study did not significantly 
differ in their reports on study variables (partner relationship quality and risk of opioid use), 
age, education, or work status; however, individuals in this study were less likely to be 
homeless, χ2(1, N = 137) = 5.11, p = .024, and were less likely to be racial/ethnic 
minorities, χ2(1, N = 112) = 4.55, p = .033.

2.2.  Measures

2.2.1.  Risk of opioid use.—The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Modified – 
ASSIST was used to assess risk of opioid use (WHO ASSIST Working Group, 2002). This 
validated and reliable 8-item measure is widely used to detect and manage substance use in 
general medical care settings (Humeniuk et al., 2008). ASSIST calculates a Substance 
Involvement (SI) score for tobacco, alcohol, and 7 classes of drugs, and combines illicit 
opioid use and nonmedical use of prescription opioids into a single category. We 
distinguished between nonmedical prescription opioid use (fentanyl, oxycodone 
[OxyContin, Percocet], hydrocodone [Vicodin], methadone, buprenorphine, etc.) and street 
opioid use (heroin, opium, etc.) by separately calculating participant scores. For each

substance, scores of 0–3 indicate lower risk, scores of 4–26 represent moderate risk, and 
scores of 27 or higher reflect high risk.

2.2.2.  Partner relationship quality.—Participants were asked about the relationship 
with their partners using items from the Health and Retirement Study (Smith et al., 2017). 
Positive relationship quality was captured using three items. On a scale ranging from 1 (a 
lot) to 4 (not at all), participants reported how much their partner: really understands the way 
they feel about things; can be relied upon if they have a serious problem; and how much they 
can open up to them if they need to talk about their worries. Negative relationship quality 
was assessed with four items. On a scale ranging from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all), participants 
reported how much their partner: makes too many demands on them; criticizes them; lets 
them down when counted upon; and gets on their nerves. Prior research indicates that these 
measures produce valid and reliable responses (Bertera, 2005; Schuster et al., 1990; Walen 
and Lachman, 2000). The items were reverse coded and averaged such that higher scores 
represented greater positive relationship quality (women: α = .82; men: α = .75) and greater 
negative relationship quality (women: α = .87; men: α = .79).

2.2.3.  Covariates.—We controlled for relationship type (1 = married, −1 = cohabiting) 
and relationship duration (1 = 5 years or longer, −1 = less than 5 years). In post hoc tests, we 
also controlled for treatment duration. To account for differences in risk of opioid use among 
patients in treatment long enough to be stable on methadone (Ward et al. 1998), we 
examined whether patients received treatment for two or more years (1 = 2 years or more, −1 
= less than 2 years).

2.3.  Analytic Strategy

In preliminary analyses, we used paired t-tests and McNemar tests to consider gender 
differences in background characteristics and scores on study variables among couples. The 
main analyses were estimated using actor-partner interdependence models (APIM; Kenny et 
al., 2006) with the MIXED procedure in SPSS version 27. The APIM combines a conceptual 
model of interdependence in social relationships with statistical procedures that allow for the 
evaluation of mutual influences. Models allowed for correlated errors between women and 
men within couples using a heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH) covariance structure. 
Actor effects in this study refer to the extent to which one’s own reports of relationship 
quality are associated with risk of using opioids. Partner effects in this study refer to the 
extent to which partners’ reports of relationship quality are associated with risk of using 
opioids.

Models for positive and negative relationship quality were conducted separately. Model 1 
tested the associations between own and partner perceptions of relationship quality and risk 
of nonmedical prescription opioid use and risk of street opioid use. Model 2 added 
relationship type and duration as covariates. A distinguishing variable (1 = woman, −1 = 
man) was used to estimate separate intercepts and slopes for women and men within couples 
(Kenny et al., 2006).

3.  Results

Page 6

Table 1 shows participant characteristics and scores on key study variables for the 53 
married or cohabiting couples (106 individuals). On average, women and men were in their 
late 30s to early 40s and had been together for 8.56 years (SD = 8.96, range = 0.17 to 35.0). 
Most participants were non-Hispanic White, had a high school education or less, and lived in 
their own homes; but almost one in twelve were homeless. About one in four of couples 
were married. Among women and men, about 6 in 10 had been in treatment for two years or 
longer. There were few gender differences within couples. Compared with their male 
partners, women were significantly younger and were significantly less likely to be 
employed full- or part-time but did not differ on any other background characteristics or 
study variables. We found that approximately half of women (47.2%) and men (52.8%) had 
SI scores for prescription opioid use that reflected moderate risk (scores of 4–26) or high 
risk (scores ≥ 27). Similarly, almost two-thirds of women and men (64.2%) had SI scores for 
street opioid use that indicated moderate or high risk. Women and men had SI scores for 
prescription opioids, street opioids, cannabis, and cocaine that indicated moderate risk of use 
on average. Most participants in the moderate risk category for prescription opioids had an 
SI score of 6 among both women (58.3%) and men (69.6%). Similarly, the most frequent SI 
score in the moderate risk category for street opioids was 6 among both women (48.3%) and 
men (57.7%).

APIM parameter estimates for the positive relationship quality model are presented in Table 
2 (nonmedical prescription opioids) and Table 3 (street opioids). Partial intraclass 
correlations (ICCs) showed high within-couple correlations for risk of street opioid use (ICC 
= 0.64, p < .001 in Model 1 and ICC = 0.66, p < .001 in Model 2); but not nonmedical 
prescription opioid use (ICC = 0.08, p = .580 in Model 1 and ICC = 0.05, p = .708 in Model 
2). Negative partner relationship quality was not significantly linked to risk of nonmedical 
prescription or street opioid use; therefore, the estimates for these models are shown in 
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

3.1.  Links Between Relationship Quality and Risk of Nonmedical Prescription Opioid Use

3.1.1.  Women’s risk of opioid use.—Table 2 (Model 1) shows that there was a 
significant actor effect for women. When women perceived higher positive relationship 
quality, they had a significantly lower risk of nonmedical prescription opioid use (b = −2.56, 
p = .018). This link remained significant after controlling for relationship characteristics in 
Model 2 (b = −2.34, p = .039). Thus, for each one-unit increase in women’s perceived 
positive relationship quality, their SI score for prescription opioids decreased by nearly 2.5 
points. Partners’ reports of positive relationship quality were not linked to women’s 
nonmedical prescription opioid use risk.

3.1.2.  Men’s risk of opioid use.—There was a marginally significant partner effect 
such that when their partners reported higher positive partner relationship quality, men had a 
lower risk of nonmedical prescription opioid use in Model 1 (b = −3.41, p = .062) but not in 
Model 2 after accounting for relationship characteristics. Men’s own perceptions of positive

partner relationship quality were not associated with their risk of using nonmedical 
prescription opioids.

3.2.  Links Between Relationship Quality and Risk of Street Opioid Use

3.2.1.  Women’s risk of opioid use.—As shown in Table 3, there was a marginally 
significant actor effect for women. When women reported higher positive relationship 
quality, they had a lower risk of street opioid use in Model 1 (b = −3.49, p = .059) but not in 
Model 2 after controlling for relationship characteristics. Partners’ views of positive 
relationship quality were not associated with women’s risk of using street opioids

3.2.2.  Men’s risk of opioid use.—In Model 1, there was a significant partner effect for 
men such that when their partners reported higher positive partner relationship quality, men 
had a lower risk of street opioid use (b = −4.62, p = .034). In other words, for each one-unit 
increase in their partners’ perceived positive relationship quality, men’s SI score for street 
opioids decreased by slightly more than four and a half points. This link became 
nonsignificant in Model 2, however, after accounting for relationship characteristics. Men’s 
own perceptions of positive relationship quality were not associated with their risk of using 
street opioids.

3.3.  Post Hoc Tests

We estimated models controlling for own and partner reports of treatment duration in a 
reduced sample of 50 couples with complete data on these variables. The findings did not 
change in these models.

4.  Discussion

This study builds on the literature by demonstrating that positive qualities of partner 
relationships are associated with lower risk of opioid use among couples receiving 
methadone. In particular, women’s views of positive relationship quality appear 
consequential to both their own and their partners’ risk of using opioids. Among this sample 
of women and men in heterosexual couples, we found that about half had a moderate to high 
risk of prescription opioid use and nearly two-thirds had a moderate to high risk of street 
opioid use. Moreover, risk of street opioid use was highly correlated within couples, 
suggesting strong interdependence. These findings indicate that married or cohabiting 
couples in which both partners receive methadone for OUD may be at a substantial risk of 
return to use. Strategies to promote positive relationships may enhance the ongoing clinical 
care and treatment of these couples.

When women reported a more positive relationship, they had a lower risk of nonmedical use 
of prescription opioids. Consistent with our hypothesis, women who perceive more positive 
qualities in their partner relationships may be more resilient during methadone treatment for 
OUD. Relative to men, women with OUD have higher rates of receiving a physician 
prescription for opioids (Nosyk et al., 2014), are at greater risk of nonmedical use of 
prescription opioids (Marsh et al., 2018), and are more likely to use nonmedical prescription 
opioids to cope with negative emotions (McHugh et al., 2013). Among patients receiving

methadone for OUD, women have also been found to be more likely than men to use illicit 
opioids in the past month when they have severe levels of loneliness (Polenick et al., 2019). 
In highly positive relationships, women might feel greater support and understanding from 
their partners that facilitates adaptive, drug-free ways to manage psychosocial stress. 
Notably, this finding held even when controlling for relationship characteristics and 
treatment duration in post hoc tests, which indicates that the link between women’s views of 
positive partner relationship quality and their risk of nonmedical prescription opioid use is 
robust. Partners’ views of positive relationship quality were not linked to women’s opioid 
use risk, suggesting that their own perceptions likely play a more prominent role.

Among men, their partners’ perceptions of positive relationship quality seemed to be most 
consequential. In line with our hypothesis, when their partners reported more positive 
relationship quality, men had a lower risk of street opioid use. This association became 
nonsignificant after controlling for relationship characteristics, however, which suggests that 
other aspects of the partner relationship may be more important for men. Of note, being 
married (versus cohabiting) was significantly linked to men’s lower risk of using street 
opioids. One possibility is that the presence of a committed partner relationship is protective 
for men receiving methadone for OUD, beyond the quality of that relationship. Marriage has 
been found to benefit men’s well-being more than women’s in a variety of ways, such as 
reducing engagement in health-risk behaviors (e.g., August and Sorkin, 2010; Umberson, 
1992). Men often inject street opioids and other drugs with drug-using friends or relatives 
(e.g., Liu et al., 2018; Young et al., 2014), but these behaviors may be less likely to occur 
when men are in committed partner relationships and when their partners view these 
relationships more positively. Men’s own views of positive relationship quality were not 
associated with their risk of nonmedical prescription or street opioid use, indicating that 
their partners’ evaluation may matter more.

Contrary to our hypothesis, negative partner relationship quality was not associated with 
opioid use risk among women or men. These findings contrast with prior research showing 
that negative qualities in the partner relationship are linked to adverse outcomes including 
higher rates of return to use in substance use disorder treatment (e.g., Fairbairn and 
Cranford, 2016; Mattson et al., 2010; Tracy et al., 2005). Although more research is needed, 
the present study indicates that positive relationship quality may play a stronger part in 
shaping outcomes among heterosexual couples receiving methadone for OUD. It is worth 
noting, however, that this sample reported low overall levels of negative relationship quality. 
As such, negative relationship quality may be significantly linked to opioid use risk among 
more distressed couples.

We acknowledge several limitations. First, causal associations cannot be determined in a 
cross-sectional study. For instance, women may have reported more positive relationships 
partly because they and their partners are less likely to use opioids. Second, the self-selected 
sample could introduce bias. It is plausible, for example, that couples who participated have 
better relationships and a lower risk of opioid use than couples who did not participate. 
Third, given that the rates of missing data in the larger sample were 10.9% and 10.2% for 
the nonmedical prescription and street opioid measures, respectively, individuals with higher 
scores may have been less likely to respond. Fourth, we lacked data on past substance use,

methadone dose, and treatment performance (e.g., attendance, ratio of positive opioid 
responses in the urine samples). Fifth, the findings may not apply to couples in which only 
one partner receives methadone treatment or in which one or both partners receive different 
OUD treatments. Sixth, the sample was heterosexual and primarily non-Hispanic White, and 
so the results may not generalize to same-sex couples or racially/ethnically diverse couples. 
Finally, the sample size was small but similar to those of previous studies with one or both 
partners in substance use disorder treatment (e.g., Kelley et al., 2016; Flanagan et al., 2018; 
Schumm et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the present study has a number of important strengths 
including data from both members of the couples, the use of reliable and valid measures of 
relationship quality and opioid use, and statistical procedures to permit the assessment of 
mutual influences between partners.

Additional studies are needed to examine how partner relationship quality is associated with 
risk of opioid use over time among couples receiving methadone. Future research should 
also consider potential mechanisms that account for the current findings. For example, 
positive partner relationships may be a central source of social support and reinforcement for 
engaging in healthy, non-drug activities. Partners in more positive relationships may also 
have more supportive communication about OUD and may influence one another’s attitudes 
toward opioid use (e.g., whether street opioid use is acceptable) in ways that lower their risk 
of return to use. Identifying potentially modifiable pathways through which positive partner 
relationships are linked to a lower risk of opioid use might help to reward abstinence and 
sustain recovery.

3.1.  Conclusions

In summary, this study indicates that positive partner relationships may have important 
implications for risk of opioid use among couples in which both partners receive methadone 
for OUD. The findings underscore the value of considering mutual influences within these 
couples. Couples receiving methadone for OUD likely face considerable obstacles to long-
term recovery, including a shared history of opioid use that may complicate their response 
and adherence to treatment (Simmons and McMahon, 2012; Simmons and Singer, 2006). 
Prior research indicates that couple-based treatment is associated with improvements in 
relationship functioning as well as reductions in substance use (McCrady et al., 2016; 
Powers et al., 2008). Consequently, approaches to strengthen and expand on positive 
qualities in their relationships may maximize treatment outcomes among this particularly 
vulnerable subgroup of patients.
