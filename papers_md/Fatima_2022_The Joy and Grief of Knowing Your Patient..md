The Joy and Grief of Knowing Your Patient

ABSTRACT
During medical school and residency, we are taught to always keep boundaries with our 
patients. I took this lesson to heart and considered my patients merely as “diseases” during 
training. As I transitioned into the role of an early career attending physician, I realized my 
lack of meaningful patient relationships, and the concomitant burnout that it had caused. 
I hence changed my perspective and started listening to patient stories. These stories give 
me a purpose and gratitude in medicine that I had never felt before. On the flip side, I also 
gained insight that these stories come with a cost. There is so much joy, but grief exists 
simultaneously. Bad outcomes and patient losses are more heartbreaking than ever before. 
In this essay I reflect upon my journey of finding a path to the humanistic side of medicine 
and highlight my struggle to find the balance between the joy of connecting to patients 
and the vulnerability to pain and loss that accompanies it.

R ounds were routine that day; I was racing against time to finish by 11:30 AM 

and ticking the checkbox for noon discharges. As an early career pediatric 
hospitalist, my goal was to give each patient enough time but not more than 

what would sacrifice efficiency. After a chaotic morning, we had finally made it 
to the room of one of our patients with a chronic illness, who was well known to 
our team. A 3-year-old girl with a life-limiting illness that was progressing faster 
than expected. As we were going through the numbers, I could hear sounds of 
discomfort humming in my ear. I walked in the room and found the patient’s hair 
covered in vomit. Her eyes open and looking around asking for help, not having 
the words to say it. The sound of the children’s TV show CoComelon buzzing in 
the background, uplifting the wary mood that pervaded. As I finished my routine 
exam, I was told that the nurse needed time before she could come help this patient. 
I started walking out, but then got pulled back in by a distinct unease grasping my 
heart. I took a pause, grabbed wipes and started cleaning the vomit from the sheets 
and clothes. I played with her for a little bit, not wanting to leave her alone. She 
blew me a kiss. It warmed my heart, but somehow, I also felt fear. My analytical 
factual brain knew that my patient’s time in this world was limited. It was predicting 
heartache and pain as I was creating a bond with her. The nurse finally made her 
way in, and I left the room with that harrowing thought in mind. I continued to go 
about my day as usual and the many days after. I got the news 2 months later that 
she had died.

Medical school and residency teach us to always keep our boundaries with the 
patient. Do not get to know them too well. Do not create a place for them in your 
heart. It can muddy the water of clinical care and hurt when bad outcomes happen. 
Before starting med school, I was bright-eyed, with the passion and fire in me to 
create impactful relationships with patients. But the grind, the demand for perfec-
tionism, and the assumption that the fittest would survive slowly changed my trajec-
tory. I learned this new lesson to heart and followed it. Transitioning into residency, 
most days were spent behind the electronic health record (EHR). In the patient 
room, I focused on the disease and the plan. Despite seeing hundreds of patients 
in a month, I did not know a single story, nor did my patients know mine. For me, 
they were just diseases. I remember standing outside the room of a young girl dying 
of cancer, her grieving heartbroken mother holding her tight in her arms saying 
goodbye. Somehow, I felt nothing. I remember seeing the faces of anxious parents 
and terrified children, and only thinking of the tasks that I had to get done that day.

It got to a point where I realized the work that I had been 
doing was of no meaning to me. I felt no purpose in help-
ing patients. Everything that I was doing was so methodical, 
there was no room for emotion. In the quest of avoiding grief 
and appearing strong, I had become a robot.

Approaching the end of residency, I started reflecting 
on the meaningful moments I had collected along the way. 
To my utter disbelief, my mind felt blank and hollow. In the 
aftermath of this rude awakening, I decided to take a step 
back and changed the way I worked. I started listening. Every 
time I walked into the room; I learned a story. The story 
about the red watch. The story of the brown Labrador pet. 
The story of loving the color yellow. The story of the ambi-
tious brother. The story of the new mom with no support. 
The story of the parent who had lost a job. The story of a 
parent who was struggling with their own chronic illness. 
The story of the parent who was fighting a custody battle. 
The story of the mom who had lost another child. And as 
I began to collect these stories, I started to recognize the 
patients. They were not just diseases anymore. They were 
children, mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings. People liv-
ing whole lives. These stories helped me find purpose back in 
my work. The memory of the mom who gave me my first hug 
in the hallway is still fresh in my mind as if yesterday. The 
smiles, laughter, and tears that I have shared with my patients 
are my happy memories for a bad day.

My journey of transitioning from a robot to an empath 
came with its struggles. Soon enough, I had a realization that 

often stories come with a cost. Recognizing patients beyond 
their diseases humanized them, and often struck too close to 
home. There was so much joy, but grief existed simultane-
ously. When things did not go so well, there was sorrow, 
there was pain. Losing patients was much harder when I 
knew the dreams they had for if they had lived in this world. 
Envisioning the casket for a child who was once able to blow 
kisses to me was one of the toughest moments of my early 
career. I was unable to think of it as only “a difficult day at 
work”; it was much more than that—there were pieces of my 
heart that I had lost along the way. 

The memory of that patient’s kiss is etched in my mind. 
It makes me smile, but also breaks my heart. Should I have 
taken a step back that day? Would it have saved me from 
the pain? Is there a perfect balance to the humanistic side of 
medicine? As physicians, where do we draw the line? What 
is the secret sauce to love your patient, but just not enough 
to break your heart? Should I fear learning stories again? The 
lines are blurry in my mind, but I guess that is what being 
human is about. For now, I continue to listen as I wonder: is 
the joy worth the grief?
