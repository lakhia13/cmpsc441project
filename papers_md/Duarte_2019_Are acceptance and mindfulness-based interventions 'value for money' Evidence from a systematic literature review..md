Objectives. Acceptance and mindfulness-based interventions (A/MBIs) are recom-
mended for people with mental health conditions. Although there is a growing evidence
base supporting the effectiveness of different A/MBIs for mental health conditions, the
economic case for these interventions has not been fully explored. The aim of this
systematic review was to identify and appraise all available economic evidence of A/MBIs
for the management of mental health conditions.

Methods. Eight electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &
Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Web of Science, NHS Economic Evaluation
Database (EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) database, and EconLit) were searched for relevant economic
evaluations published from each database’s inception date until November 2017. Study
selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were carried out according to published
guidelines.

Results. Ten relevant economic evaluations presented in 11 papers were identiﬁed. Seven
of the included studies were full economic evaluations (i.e., costs and effects assessed), and
three studies were partial economic evaluations (i.e., only costs were considered in the
analysis). The A/MBIs that had been subjected to economic evaluation were acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy (MBCT), and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). In terms of
clinical presentations, the evaluation of cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs has been more focused
on depression and emotional unstable personality disorder with three and four economic
evaluations, respectively. Three out of seven full economic evaluations observed that A/MBIs
were cost-effective for the management of mental health conditions. Nevertheless, the

heterogeneity of included populations, interventions, and economic evaluation study types
limits the extent to which ﬁrm conclusions can currently be made.

Conclusion. This ﬁrst substantive review of economic evaluations of A/MBIs indicates
that more research is needed before ﬁrm conclusions can be reached on the cost-
effectiveness of A/MBIs for mental health conditions.

Practitioner points
(cid:1) The ﬁndings of the review provide information that may be relevant to mental health service
commissioners and decision-makers as all economic evidence available on acceptance and mindfulness-
based interventions for mental health conditions is summarized.

(cid:1) Evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness and cost-saving potential of acceptance and mindfulness-
based interventions is focused mainly on depression and emotional unstable personality disorder to
date.

(cid:1) Heterogeneity in the speciﬁc forms of acceptance and mindfulness-based interventions may limit

generalizability of the ﬁndings.

(cid:1) The number of health economic evaluations relating to acceptance and mindfulness-based

interventions remains relatively small. Further research in this area is required.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have developed over the last 30 years with the
intention of averting the negative psychological impacts that arise from a range of medical
and psychological disorders. The origins of mindfulness can however be traced back at
least 2,500 years to the emergence of Buddhist traditions (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). The term
‘mindfulness’ has been derived from the Pali word ‘sati’, which derives from the verb
‘Sarati’, which translates ‘to remember’. The development of MBIs has been likened to a
process whereby ‘Buddhist meditation has been lifted from its traditional setting in
Buddhist doctrine and faith and transplanted in a secularised culture bent on pragmatic
results’ (Bodhi, 2011, p. 35). A range of deﬁnitions of ‘mindfulness’ have been proposed
(An(cid:1)alayo, 2016). However, a widely cited description suggests that mindfulness involves
‘paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-
judgmentally’ (Kabat-Zinn, 1994, p. 4). Reﬂecting on the clinical application of
mindfulness, an operational deﬁnition describing a two-component model of a mindful-
ness intervention has been proposed (Bishop et al., 2004). The ﬁrst component, self-
regulation of attention, focuses on building a participant’s capability of feeling fully
present in the moment over a prolonged period of time. The second component is an
orientation to experience, which facilitates a participant to engage in an active process of
acceptance, whereby all emotional and physical symptoms of distress are seen as relevant
and to be observed, with the ultimate aim of reducing their impact, due to the subjective
change in their meaning.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) are commonly used mindfulness interventions. An overview of systematic review
and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) found that MBSR and MBCT
signiﬁcantly improved depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and physical functioning for
patients with cancer, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, somatic diseases, and
depression when compared to waiting list control and to treatment as usual (Gotink
et al., 2015). Another meta-analysis which reviewed a range of studies that included these
conditions, and also hyperactive disorder, personality disorders, multiple sclerosis, and
irritable bowel syndrome, suggested that MBCT is more effective in treating psychological
disorders than medical or physical conditions, and is moderately effective in pre–post

comparisons, waiting list controls, and comparisons with other active treatments (Khoury
et al., 2013). Whilst the importance of mindfulness practice is explicitly centred within
the practice of MBSR and MBCT, other forms of interventions incorporate mindfulness-
informed acceptance strategies as a key component in a wider package of care.
Examples of such interventions include dialectical behavioural
therapy (DBT)
(Linehan, 2014) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (Hayes, Pistorello,
& Levin, 2012). A meta-analysis indicated that DBT was effective in reducing self-
destructive behaviours and enhancing the extent to which participants adhered to
treatment (Panos, Jackson, Hasan, & Panos, 2014). Similarly, a meta-analysis of ACT
studies concluded that ACT offers promise to reduce distress associated with a range of
physical and mental health difﬁculties (A-tjak et al., 2015). In the research literature
acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions (A/MBIs) are considered together in
systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g., Cavanagh, Strauss, Forder, & Jones, 2014;
Veehof, Trompetter, Bohlmeijer, & Schreurs, 2016; Vøllestad, Nielsen, & Nielsen,
2012). As with other forms of complex intervention, A/MBIs are complex psycho-social
treatment packages with interrelated components that have a synergizing effect
(Demarzo et al., 2015).

The most established evidence base for the effectiveness of A/MBIs is centred on
patients with depression. Several studies have found MBCT to be effective for recurrent
depression compared with usual care and maintenance antidepressants (Kuyken et al.,
2008, 2016; Ma & Teasdale, 2004; Piet & Hougaard, 2011; Teasdale et al., 2000). MBCT as
an approach to prevent depressive relapse among patients with three prior episodes of
depression is recommended in the United Kingdom (NICE 2009). However, an
assessment of the uptake of MBCT in the United Kingdom showed that despite the
available evidence and NICE guidance, a relatively low number of mental health services
had systematically implemented the recommendation (Crane & Kuyken, 2013). These
ﬁndings suggest that the role of MBCT in the management of depression has not yet been
fully implemented in routine practice.

To support the implementation of A/MBIs, economic evaluations are required to
provide a means by which to assess both the costs and consequences of an intervention
relative to an alternative course of action (Drummond, Sculpher, Torrance, O’Brien, &
Stoddart, 2005). Whilst there are clear insights into the effectiveness of A/MBIs, the
evidence base on the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is sparse (Edwards,
Bryning, & Crane, 2015). Such evidence is important in order to ensure that scarce
resources are committed to interventions that represent value for money. This
systematic review aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs for the
treatment of mental health disorders. To do so, this work sets out to (1) consider
what type(s) of A/MBIs have been subject to economic evaluation, (2) discern which
mental health conditions these interventions have been focussed on treating, (3)
evaluate the methodological limitations and strengths of the identiﬁed studies, (4)
identify knowledge gaps that exist relating to the cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs, (5)
determine whether A/MBIs represent a cost-effective use of resources for different
mental health disorders, and (6) appraise the implications of the review ﬁndings for
policy, research, and service delivery.

Methods
This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009)

and the good practice recommendations for narrative summary of health economic
studies outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews (Shemilt et al., 2011).

Study identiﬁcation
Systematic searches were conducted to identify relevant economic evaluations of A/
MBIs for the management of mental health conditions as described in the DSM-5
(American Psychiatric Association 2013). The searches were carried out using the
following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-
Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Web of Science, NHS Economic Evaluation Database
(EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) database, and EconLit. The reference lists of relevant systematic
reviews and eligible studies were hand-searched to identify additional potentially
relevant studies.

The search strategies were based on terminology linked to A/MBIs and mental
health disorders. A search ﬁlter designed by NHS EED to identify economic evaluations
was applied (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 2017). No language restriction
was applied in the searches. Details of the search strategy for MEDLINE are presented
in see Appendix S1. All electronic databases were searched on 22 November 2017. The
results of the search strategy were uploaded to and managed using Endnote X8
software.

Study selection
Full economic evaluations (i.e., cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-
beneﬁt analyses, cost-consequence analyses, or cost-minimization analyses) and partial
economic evaluations (i.e., cost analyses or cost-description studies) of A/MBIs for
participants with mental health disorders as described in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association 2013) were considered for inclusion in this systematic review. To identify and
deﬁne A/MBIs, the review drew upon Baer’s (2003) empirical review of mindfulness
training as a clinical intervention and deﬁnition of the key operational characteristics of A/
MBIs as proposed by Bishop et al. (2004). The following A/MBIs were identiﬁed: MBCT,
MBSR, DBT, ACT, mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), and other mindfulness
meditation and mindfulness training.

Two reviewers independently assessed all records based on their title and abstract
according to the inclusion criteria (Table 1). Publications that met the inclusion criteria,
as well as articles for which an exclusion or inclusion decision could not be made based on
their title and abstract alone, were retrieved and judged on the basis of their full text.
Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion, and, if necessary,
through consulting a third reviewer.

Data extraction
Relevant data from the full-text papers eligible for inclusion were extracted using a data
extraction form designed for the purposes of this study. Such data included bibliographic
information (author[s] and year of publication); general information (country, condition,
intervention, and comparator[s]); methodological characteristics (type of economic
evaluation, perspective, time horizon, discount rate, key cost categories, year of valuation,
and key outcomes), and main ﬁndings. One author extracted the data, and a second author

checked the data for accuracy. Disagreements were resolved through discussion between
reviewers and, when necessary, by seeking the opinion of a third reviewer. A narrative
synthesis was used to interpret, summarize, and present the information provided in the
selected articles.

Quality assessment
The methodological quality of the economic evaluations identiﬁed was assessed using the
Consensus on Health Economic Criteria checklist (CHEC-list) (Evers, Goossens, de Vet,
van Tulder, & Ament, 2005), which is recommended for appraising the methodological
quality of economic evaluations (Higgins & Green, 2011). The CHEC-list comprises 19
questions to be answered as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘unclear’, or ‘not applicable’. Negative answers to
the CHEC-list do not necessarily indicate poor practice or result in bias (i.e., it may relate to
absence of information rather than methodological issues). Quality assessment was
carried out by one reviewer and checked for agreement by a second reviewer.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion between reviewers and, when
necessary, by seeking the opinion of a third reviewer.

Results
A total of 1,727 records were retrieved, of which 1,726 were identiﬁed through searches
of electronic databases and one was identiﬁed through supplementary searches, that is
hand-search of reference lists (Figure 1). Following removal of 475 duplicate records, the
title and abstract of 1,252 unique articles were screened. Title and abstract screening of
these articles led to the exclusion of 1230 records. The 22 potentially relevant studies
were retrieved, and their full text was assessed for eligibility. Consideration of these
studies against the selection criteria led to the exclusion of a further 11 references (Bota,
Hazen, Tieu, & Novac, 2016; Fjorback et al., 2012, 2013; Holmes et al., 2007; Lengacher
et al., 2015; Luciano et al., 2017; McDaid & Park, 2012; Murphy & Bourke, 2014; Pots
et al., 2016; Prioli et al., 2017; Van Roijen, Sinnaeve, Bouwmans, & Van Den Bosch,
2015). The remaining 10 studies presented in 11 articles formed the ﬁnal set of reviewed
evidence (Amner, 2012; Finnes et al., 2017; Knight, Bean, Wilton, & Lin, 2015; Kuyken,
et al., 2008; Kuyken, et al., 2015a,b; Pasieczny & Connor, 2011; Priebe et al., 2012; Shawyer,
Enticott, Ozmen, Inder, & Meadows, 2016; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2014).

Overview of included studies
The included studies consider the health economic impact of A/MBIs across a range of
mental health conditions. Characteristics of the 10 studies are presented in Table 2. Seven
of the studies were conducted in Europe (four in the United Kingdom, and one in each of
Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany), two in Australia, and one in Canada. All of the
studies were published after 2008. Seven of the included studies investigated the cost-
effectiveness of A/MBIs being delivered for emotional unstable personality disorder
(EUPD) and depression (three or more previous major depressive episodes), whilst three
studies explored different conditions (i.e., mental health disorders and medically
unexplainable symptoms).

Five of the 10 studies explicitly described the intervention as being ‘mindfulness-
based’. Four of these ﬁve studies assessed MBCT, and one study evaluated MBSR. A
combination of MBCT with antidepressant tapering/discontinuation support or depres-
sive relapse active monitoring was employed in the three studies evaluating MBCT for
major depressive disorder. The remaining ﬁve studies integrated mindfulness as a key
component with other psychotherapy approaches. Four of these ﬁve studies evaluated
DBT, and one study investigated ACT. All of the 10 studies indicated that mindfulness
practice was a fundamental aspect of the intervention provided.

Rui Duarte et al.

Seven studies stated that the A/MBIs were compared to a form of usual care, including
enhanced usual care (deﬁned as such because all participants received a psychiatric
interview and the GP was explicitly informed about the psychiatric diagnoses resulting
from the interview). Two other studies can be considered to use usual care as the
comparator to the A/MBIs since participants in the control group just continued to
receive antidepressant treatment. One study evaluated ACT versus ACT combined with
another intervention (i.e., workplace dialogue intervention [WDI]), WDI alone, and
usual care.

Assessment of methodological quality
Overall, the majority of the studies appeared to meet the majority of the quality checklist
criteria as detailed in Evers et al. (2005). The economic evaluations assessing A/MBIs for
depression (Kuyken, et al., 2008; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015; Shawyer et al., 2016) met most of the criteria. The three
studies meeting the least number of criteria were Amner (2012), Knight et al. (2015), and
Wagner et al. (2014). It should be noted that the studies meeting the least number of the
criteria (Amner, 2012; Knight et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2014) were partial economic
evaluations with outcome data derived from either a before and after study design (Amner,
2012; Wagner et al., 2014) or a matched-control database study (Knight et al., 2015). The
assessment of the methodological quality of the 10 economic evaluations is presented in
Appendix S2.

Characteristics of the included economic evaluations
A summary of the design characteristics of the 10 economic evaluations included is
presented in Table 3. Seven of the 10 included studies were full economic evaluations, with
the remaining three representing partial economic evaluations. Of the seven full economic
evaluations, two were cost-effectiveness analyses (Kuyken et al., 2008; Priebe et al., 2012),
two were cost-utility analyses (Finnes et al., 2017; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013), one was a
cost-consequence analysis (Pasieczny & Connor, 2011), and two economic evaluations
included both a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis (Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng,
Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng,
Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015; Shawyer et al., 2016). The three
partial economic evaluations were cost comparisons (Amner, 2012; Knight et al., 2015;
Wagner et al., 2014). No economic models evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of A/
MBIs were identiﬁed. The resource use and effectiveness data that informed the economic
evaluations were derived from single studies.

Seven of the 10 studies adopted a societal perspective, in which all costs and beneﬁts
associated with the interventions in question were taken into account, irrespective of
what entity they accrued to (Finnes et al., 2017; Kuyken, et al., 2008; Kuyken, Hayes,
Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes,
Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015; Priebe et al., 2012;
Shawyer et al., 2016; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2014). Two studies
carried out their analysis from a health and social care perspective (Amner, 2012;
Pasieczny & Connor, 2011), whilst one study adopted a third-party payer perspective
(Knight et al., 2015). Five of the seven studies conducted from a societal perspective also
presented results speciﬁc to a health and social care perspective (Finnes et al., 2017;

The cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs: a systematic review 199

Kuyken, et al., 2008; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins,
Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins,
Morant, et al., 2015; Shawyer et al., 2016; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013).

Six of the 10 studies had a study time horizon > 12 months, and two of the studies
(Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015;
Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015;
Shawyer et al., 2016) had speciﬁcally discounted the value of the costs accruing in the
future at a rate of 3.5% and 3.0% per annum, respectively. The study by Kuyken, Hayes,
Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al. (2015) was the only study
to have reported discounting the effects, as well as the costs, both at a rate of 3.5% per
annum.

Sensitivity analyses feature in four of the full economic evaluations as a way of dealing
with uncertainty associated with a range of parameters (Finnes et al., 2017; Kuyken,
Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken,
Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015; Shawyer
et al., 2016; van Ravesteijn et al., 2013). This was also the case in two of the three partial
economic evaluations (Amner, 2012; Wagner et al., 2014).

Results of the included economic evaluations
The results of the economic evaluations are summarized in Table 4 and discussed below
according to the conditions addressed by the studies.

Depression
One of the three studies assessing the impact of MBCT on depression (i.e., three or more
previous major depressive episodes) yielded a positive result with regard to cost-
effectiveness, with Shawyer et al. (2016) reporting a 83% probability of MBCT being cost-
effective compared to usual care, from a mental health care perspective, whilst Kuyken
et al. (2008) reporting a 42% probability of MBCT plus antidepressant tapering being cost-
effective based on a society’s willingness to pay (WTP) of zero to prevent an additional
relapse/recurrence. The authors report that there was a higher probability of cost-
effectiveness, if the WTP threshold to prevent an additional relapse/recurrence was set at
a minimum of $1,000. However, Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Brejcha, et al. (2015), Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Morant, et al. (2015) study into the cost-effectiveness of MBCT compared to
antidepressant treatment, found the costs in the intervention group to be higher and the
effectiveness smaller than in the comparator group (i.e., dominated), and reported the
probability of MBCT being cost-effective as no greater than 43%.

Emotional unstable personality disorder
All of the four studies that reviewed the health economic impact of A/MBIs on
participants with EUPD assessed DBT as the intervention. The partial evaluation by
Amner (2012) found that DBT had a positive impact on cost with an average saving per
patient of £1,741 based on the year prior to intervention and the year following DBT. The
cost comparison by Wagner et al. (2014) observed a reduction in societal cost-of-illness
in the year after the intervention. However, these studies (Amner, 2012; Wagner et al.,
2014) were partial economic evaluations and met a lesser number of criteria in the

quality assessment than the other studies assessing DBT for EUPD. The remaining two
(full) evaluations obtained positive results with Priebe et al. (2012) reporting a modest
incremental cost of £36 to achieve a one percentage point reduction in the incidence of
self-harm; however, no explicit statement on the probability of cost-effectiveness was
reported. Pasieczny and Connor (2011) adopting a CCA approach reported a positive
impact of DBT on both cost and outcomes, with a mean saving of AUS $5,927 per patient
over a 6-month period and mean reduction in suicide attempts of 1.34 per patient,
respectively.

Remaining conditions
The remaining three studies assessed the economic impact of A/MBIs for medically
unexplainable symptoms and mental health disorders without specifying these disorders.
The study investigating the impact of MBCT for participants with medically unexplained
symptoms reported a 57% probability of cost-effectiveness against a WTP threshold of
EUR 80,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (van Ravesteijn et al., 2013). ACT for
mental health disorders was found to have a probability of being cost-effective of 75% at a
WTP of $14,000 per unit health gain (Finnes et al., 2017). An assessment of MBSR also for
mental health disorders observed a reduction in mean insurance costs per case treated
(Knight et al., 2015). However, the study by Knight et al. (2015) was a partial economic
evaluation and met a lesser number of criteria in the quality assessment than the full
economic evaluations.

Discussion
There is growing evidence supporting the effectiveness of A/MBIs in ameliorating distress
associated with a range of mental health conditions. However, to date there have been no
published systematic reviews that seek to synthesize and evaluate data relating to the cost-
effectiveness of A/MBIs. The present systematic review investigated whether A/MBIs for
the management of mental health conditions represent a cost-effective use of limited
resources across the diverse settings in which the interventions have been applied. As
such, this review aimed to investigate the extent to which A/MBIs had been evaluated
from a cost-effectiveness perspective, to examine the types of mental health conditions
these interventions had focussed on treating, and to appraise the strengths and limitations
of these evaluations from a methodological perspective.

A total of 10 economic evaluations of A/MBIs were included in this review. Not all
studies presented an incremental analysis, and those that did present an incremental
analysis used different WTP thresholds per QALY gain or improvement in outcomes
assessed; therefore, the results from this systematic review need to be interpreted with
caution. Three studies (Finnes et al., 2017; Shawyer et al., 2016; and van Ravesteijn et al.,
2013) considered A/MBIs to be cost-effective when compared to the respective
comparator treatments. However, van Ravesteijn et al. (2013) used a WTP of €80,000
per QALY gained, which is higher than the WTP per QALY gained in other countries.
Three partial economic evaluations (Amner, 2012; Knight et al., 2015; Wagner et al.,
2014) with inherent quality limitations observed cost-savings with the use of A/MBIs. In
the study by Kuyken et al. (2008), the use of MBCT was considered to be justiﬁed but only
if the WTP for improvements in the proportion of patients who relapse was $1,000 or
above and results were considered inconclusive. One study concluded that MBCT was not
cost-effective (Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha,

Main ﬁndings

DBT results in a cost-saving of £36,551 between Years 1 (prior
to DBT) and 3 (after DBT) as a result of reduced health service
use
Mean cost saving per participant overall was £1,741 (median:
£1,059, range: £46,264–£55,461)
Health care perspective: ACT results in an ICER of $33,579 per
additional QALY gained compared with the ‘null comparator’
ACT+WDI results in an ICER of $158,500 per additional QALY
gained compared with ACT

There is a 60% probability of ACT being more cost-effective than
doing nothing when WTP per unit health gain is $6650, which
increases to 75% if WTP is $14,000. For ACT+WDI compared
with ACT, the probability of cost-effectiveness reaches a
maximum of 50% at a WTP of $11,000 per unit health gain
Societal perspective: ICER for ACT was $88,122, followed by
ACT+WDI with an ICER of $653,500 per QALY gained
WDI and UC were dominated in both health care system and

societal perspectives

The mean OHIP cost for the cases dropped by $244 to $279,
whilst the mean costs for the controls increased between $3
and $18

Health care system perspective: ICER $439 per relapse/recurrence

prevented; ICER $23 per depression-free day

Societal perspective: ICER $962 per relapse/recurrence

prevented; ICER $50 per depression-free day

The probability of MBCT being the more cost-effective of the

two options increases as the WTP for preventing an additional
relapse/recurrence increases, suggesting that MBCT has a
higher probability of being more cost-effective than has
maintenance antidepressant treatment for WTP levels of
approximately $1,000 and above for preventing an additional
relapse/recurrence
Health care system perspective: ICER £4955 per unit reduction in
the % of patients who relapse
Societal perspective: ICER £17,930 per unit reduction in the % of
patients who relapse

The probability of MBCT being more cost-effective to prevent
relapses than maintenance antidepressant treatment does not
rise above 43%

In terms of QALYs, costs were higher in the MBCT group and
outcomes slightly worse, suggesting that MBCT was dominated
by maintenance antidepressant treatment

The probability that MBCT is more cost-effective than

maintenance antidepressant treatment does not rise above
52%

et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant,
et al., 2015), and the remaining two studies (Pasieczny & Connor, 2011; Priebe et al.,
2012) presented inconclusive results as to the cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs. In keeping
with A/MBI transdiagnostic credentials (where promoting non-judgemental openness to
experience, and not eradicating symptoms, is the key aim), the studies focused on a range
of conditions. Nevertheless, the current review did yield three economic evaluations,
which focussed on MBCT for major depressive disorder and four studies evaluating the
cost-effectiveness of DBT for EUPD. As such, presenting the ﬁndings of this review by
condition type provides an opportunity to examine the relative congruency of results,
particularly for these two speciﬁc conditions.

The three studies assessing the impact of MBCT on patients with major depressive
disorder yielded a variable set of cost-effectiveness results. The study by Kuyken et al.
(2008) produced an inconclusive result regarding cost-effectiveness, whilst the more
recent study by Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha,
et al. (2015) reported that the MBCT group resulted in more costs and less effectiveness
than maintenance antidepressant treatment group. The ﬁndings also indicated either
marginal borderline evidence that MBCT reduced the risk of relapse of a depressive

episode relative to the comparator treatment (Kuyken et al., 2008), or no difference at all
(Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015;
Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, the evaluation by Shawyer et al. (2016) into MBCT combined with
depressive relapse monitoring yielded a strong result with regard to cost-effectiveness of
this integrated approach versus the comparator treatment of depressive relapse
monitoring alone. Indeed, participants in the intervention arm of the trial spent less
time, on average, in a major depressive state and as result incurred less DALYs relative to
the comparator treatment (Shawyer et al., 2016). The studies by Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett,
Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al. (2015) and Shawyer et al. (2016)
are similar in terms of the criteria met in the quality assessment; however, the study by
Shawyer et al. (2016) did not discount the outcomes as recommended it should be done
in economic evaluations with a time horizon longer than 12 months. In summary, the
results arising from the three studies fail to provide conclusive evidence that MBCT is a
cost-effective treatment for depression.

The review identiﬁed four studies that evaluated the health economic impact of DBT
on patients with EUPD. None of these studies provided convincing evidence to support a
hypothesis that A/MBIs are a cost-effective treatment, due in part to economic evaluation
design and uncertainty around results. For example, whilst both the studies by Amner
(2012) and Wagner et al. (2014) reported that the cost of treating participants with EUPD
reduced after DBT intervention when compared with treatment prior to DBT, there was
no assessment of health outcomes and pre-intervention data were collected retrospec-
tively. Furthermore, given the small sample sizes, limited scope of cost, and a broad
approach to sensitivity analysis, the results can be viewed as uncertain.

Whilst Pasieczny and Connor (2011) did not conduct an incremental analysis of DBT,
the study revealed that participants consumed fewer health and social care resources on
the DBT arm of the trial and beneﬁted from better health outcomes on the back of reduced
incidence of suicide attempts. However, the results relating to cost have a degree of
uncertainty, as the mean reduction of AUS $5,927 per patient on the DBT arm related
speciﬁcally to a 6-month time horizon, and the authors reported the intervention group to
be more costly than the comparator treatment group for those patients who continued to
receive the intervention for a further 6 months.

Similarly, the study of Priebe et al. (2012) evidenced a reduction in self-harm in
participants receiving DBT intervention arm compared to the treatment as usual arm, and
the mean cost per patient of the DBT intervention was higher than the comparator, albeit
not statistically signiﬁcant. The level of uncertainty around the cost impact of the
intervention led the authors to conclude that whilst DBT was shown to be effective in
reducing the incidence of self-harm, there was a possibility for higher treatment costs
overall. So whilst the incremental cost to achieve a one percentage point reduction in the
incidence of self-harm was relative low, the small sample size and lack of statistical power
to yield a statistically signiﬁcant difference in cost create a level of uncertainty around cost-
effectiveness, which was not explored by the authors.

It is difﬁcult to draw any direct comparisons between the remaining three studies that
evaluated the impact of A/MBIs on non-speciﬁc mental health conditions. Nevertheless,
the study by van Ravesteijn et al. (2013) evaluating MBCT for the treatment of medically
unexplained symptoms reported that the probability of cost-effectiveness was 55%
assuming a WTP of €80,000 per QALY gained. Finnes et al. (2017) reported a 75%
probability of ACT being cost-effective when compared to doing nothing at a willingness-
to-pay threshold of $14,000 per QALY gained.

Methodological considerations
Whilst this review contributes to the knowledge base of what is known about the
economic impact of A/MBIs, there are a number of methodological issues to be considered
when assessing the internal and external validity of the identiﬁed studies. A/MBIs are
considered to be psycho-social interventions targeting the psychological effects of a range
of mental health conditions. As such, we contend that it is appropriate to adopt a wide
perspective when quantifying all relevant costs, despite NICE guidance (NICE 2013)
recommending the adoption of a narrower health and personal social care perspective for
the purposes of decision-making within the context of the NHS. Seven of the papers
included in this review adopted a societal perspective, and ﬁve of the studies included
presented a set of results from both a societal and a health and personal social care
perspective. Indeed, it is noteworthy that two of evaluations focusing on MBCT’s effect on
depression (Kuyken, et al., 2008; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis,
Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015) presented results in this way, thus strengthening their
external validity from this perspective.

Closely allied to the issue of perspective is the method by which all relevant costs are
sourced and measured. The current review indicated that there was large variability across
the studies to how successful this had been executed. For example, Amner (2012), due
primarily to data availability issues, only included mental health service resource use.
There were, however, a number of studies in the current review that adopted a robust
approach to deﬁning all relevant costs. For example, the three studies that focused on the
cost-effectiveness of MBCT for the treatment of depression had a comprehensive set of
costs assumed within the analysis (Kuyken, et al., 2008; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng,
Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al., 2015; Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng,
Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Morant, et al., 2015; Shawyer et al., 2016).

In relation to beneﬁts, the identiﬁed studies employed a variety of measures to capture
positive changes in mental health outcomes and improved health-related quality of life,
with the latter being translated into QALYs. QALYs offer a generic measure of quality of life
(QoL) that can facilitate comparisons across areas and conditions, including mental health
problems (Brazier, 2008). There is evidence supporting the use of generic QoL measures
to evaluate interventions for common mental health problems (e.g., depression and
anxiety), but for other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, a preference-based
measure focused on the impact of mental health should be considered (Mulhern et al.,
2014). However, the merits of using QALYs over, arguably, narrower measures of
outcomes need to be balanced against the fact that such a generic measure, at least in its
current form, may be insensitive to changes in mental health. For example, empirical
evidence suggests that psychological well-being and social
interaction are salient
elements for people with mental health problems, though such elements are not
included in prominent generic measures of QoL, which instead focus on domains such as
usual activities, physical mobility, and pain (Chisholm, Healey, & Knapp, 1997).
Additional shortcomings of expressing changes in mental health through generic QoL
measures relate to the valuation and nature of care required. Taken together, these issues
suggest a need for caution when using generic measures for the evaluation of mental
health conditions.

It is positive that nine of the ten studies had a study time horizon of 12 months or more,
with two of the three studies assessing MBCT for depression having a 24-month follow-up.
Given the multi-dimensional nature of an A/MBI, the time horizons adopted in these
studies provided a useful base to capture the effect of the A/MBI, congruent with Medical

The cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs: a systematic review 205

Research Council guidance (Craig et al., 2008). With the exception of the Kuyken, Hayes,
Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al. (2015) and Shawyer et al.
(2016) studies, the economic evaluations in the current review were dependent on the
results of relatively small trials, which may affect the internal validity of the results.
Furthermore, whilst six of the ten studies were reported to have undertaken sensitivity
analysis to test various parameter uncertainties, the data and methods used to characterize
the level of uncertainty were either not described or not clearly detailed.

Strengths and limitations of the review
Each part of the review, including study identiﬁcation, selection, quality assessment,
and data extraction, was carried out in line with PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) and Centre
for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines (NHS CRD 2009). No constraints were set on
the economic study type and limited criteria on the population of interest. The study
parameters were therefore wide in scope, which successfully facilitated a search of
literature to inform the knowledge base of cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs. Consistent with
previous reviews that have evaluated the efﬁcacy of A/MBIs, the studies included in the
current review focused on a range of conditions (Gotink et al., 2015; Khoury et al.,
2013) and interventions (Cavanagh et al., 2014; Veehof et al., 2016; Vøllestad et al.,
2012). Although this is in keeping with the transdiagnostic aspirations and credentials of
A/MBIs, the heterogeneity of included populations,
interventions, and economic
evaluation study types limits the extent to which ﬁrm conclusions can be made in
relation to different clinical conditions. An additional potential source of heterogeneity
was the inclusion of economic evaluations assessing diverse forms of A/MBIs including
MBCT, ACT, and DBT. This approach is, however, consistent with other systematic
reviews and meta-analyses of A/MBIs that have also included studies evaluating MBCT,
ACT, and DBT (Fuchs, Lee, Roemer, & Orsillo, 2013; Godfrey, Gallo, & Afari, 2015;
Wanden-Berghe, Sanz-Valero, & Wanden-Berghe, 2010). Although these approaches
have different theoretical bases, each advocates for mindfulness practices as key
components to the interventions. It is important to note that DBT was only assessed in
relation to EUPD. As the results are presented separately by mental health condition, the
health economic evaluation for DBT can be easily disaggregated from the analyses
relating to other forms of A/MBIs.

Future research and policy implications
This is the ﬁrst review to systematically synthesize research evidence relating to the cost-
effectiveness of A/MBIs. As such, the review makes an important contribution to guiding
future research and decision-making relating to service design and delivery. Firstly, whilst
there were a number of technical issues with the three studies examining the cost-
effectiveness of MBCT on depression, there was a relatively high level of internal and
external validity across these studies. NICE (2009) recommended MBCT as a treatment for
people who are currently well but had experienced three or more previous depressive
episodes. This decision was made based on one cost-effectiveness analysis (Kuyken et al.,
2008), which produced an inconclusive result. This has been superseded by the study of
Kuyken, Hayes, Barrett, Byng, Dalgleish, Kessler, Lewis, Watkins, Brejcha, et al. (2015),
which found the intervention not to be cost-effective. Given the relatively poor
implementation of MBCT for depression (Crane & Kuyken, 2013), the ﬁndings of the
review provide information that may be relevant to decision-makers responsible for

206

implementation of this NICE guideline. Two recent reviews of MBIs have highlighted that
there is a need to better monitor the quantity and quality of between-session mindfulness
practice, which is purported to be an important process of change (Lloyd, White, Eames,
& Crane, 2017; Parsons, Crane, Parsons, Fjorback, & Kuyken, 2017). Moving forward, it
may be that if greater standardization is brought to the quality and quantity of the practice,
then the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs may be increased.

Conclusion
This systematic review provides an evaluation of the current evidence base on the health
economic impact of A/MBIs for a range of mental health disorders. The available economic
evaluations varied in terms of study population, intervention type, and the economic
evaluation methods. The fact that a range of A/MBIs across different types of mental health
disorders has been evaluated from a health economic perspective is positive, especially in
the light of the limited understanding of what type of economic evidence existed before
the review. The included economic evidence presented limitations, and therefore, the
results should be interpreted with some caution. The results of the included economic
evaluations varied with one study suggesting A/MBIs not to be cost-effective whilst other
studies were inconclusive. Three out of seven full economic evaluations suggest A/MBIs
to be cost-effective, whilst the three partial economic evaluations considered A/MBIs to be
cost-saving versus a range of comparator interventions. More research is needed before
ﬁrm conclusions can be reached on the cost-effectiveness of A/MBIs for mental health
conditions.
