Abstract
Background: The aspects of marriage and relationship and their effect on couples’ satisfaction are essential and
critical aspects to be explored in this globalized and contemporary world. Since there are no reported meta-analysis
and systematic reviews conducted in the last two decades in this area, we aimed to investigate the effect of
marriage and relationship programs (MRP) on couples’ relationship satisfaction (CRS) and couples’ relationship
communication (CRC) and also to determine the gender differences if any.

Method: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between 2000
and July 26, 2019, were retrieved from several online electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, ProQuest, and
Cochrane Library. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed using the PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, Outcome) framework of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses).
The mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The reported summary statistics
were calculated as random effects models based on the heterogeneity between the studies model. Funnel plots
and the Egger regression test was used to confirm the presence of any publication bias.
Results: Of the total 12 intervention studies included, five (5) are education/communication skills programs, three
(3) enrichment programs, and four (4) therapy programs. The impact of these programs was investigated on CRS
and CRC. Therapy programs had a larger effect than other programs (pooled MD: 0.53 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.71, I2 =
71.5% p = 0.0001) and had a larger effect size on wives (pooled MD: 0.53 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.80, I2 = 74.1% p =
0.0001) than husbands RS (pooled MD: 0.26 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.76, I2 = 72.4% p = 0.0001). In RC (relationship
communication) area, the Enhancement programs showed the small to large effect on CRC (pooled MD: 1.31 (95%
CI = 0.13 to 2.50, I2 = 94.7% p = 0.0001)) and educational programs showed small to medium effect (pooled MD:
0.32 (95% CI = 0.13 to 0.50, I2 = 74.5% p = 0.0001) on women and no effect on men.

Conclusion: Due to the high effect of the therapy programs on CRS and enhancement program on CRC in the
current meta-analysis, the priority of their utilizations in interventions, especially by psychologists and mental health
professionals, should be emphasized. Therefore, mental health planning in communities to develop MRP and care for
couples’ health should be given special attention to men’s health. Due to the high heterogeneity of the results and
with scanty literature in this specific domain, we are uncertain about their actual effect. However, well-designed RCTs
with a larger sample size would be beneficial in closely examining the effect of MRPs on CRS and CRC.

Keywords: Couple satisfaction, Marriage programs, Relationship programs, Systematic review and meta-analysis

Background
Globally, one of the most significant transitions in the
human life course in almost every country is either de-
nial from marriage and/or delays in marriage with an in-
crease in cohabitation, divorce rate, remaining single,
plus a combination of any of these [1]. Among these fac-
tors, marital conflict and subsequent divorce can have
adverse consequences for the family and the community
[2]. Divorce always is painful and damaging, especially
for the divorcing parents and children [3]. There is ex-
tensive research evidence that suggests that growing up
with single parents is associated with an elevated risk of
involvement in crime by adolescents and face the most
significant barriers to success in school and the work-
force [4–6]. As Heintz suggests, many interventions
might prevent divorce and toxic marriage duration, such
as compassionate support, encouragement and training,
assisting through their difficulties, and developing the
skills needed to create and maintain happy and success-
ful marriages [3].

Recent studies in this area indicated that married
adults could benefit more than single ones [7, 8]. Mar-
riage offers a certain degree of economic and social sta-
bility with improved health and greater satisfaction that
unmarried adults do not feel [8]. Besides, it was found
that married women are happier than those who were
single and have more psychological wellbeing [7, 9].
However, studies by Jackson et al indicated the mental
health benefits of being married extend equally to men
and women [10, 11]. This issue’s importance is seen in
the debate over whether men and women differ in their
mental health response to change in marital satisfaction
and communication. Though the research results were
statistically significant in this study, the gender differ-
ences in marital satisfaction between wives and hus-
bands were minimal, with wives slightly less satisfied
than husbands; however, this dissatisfaction was found
to be higher among wives in marital therapy than the
wives in the general population [10]. However, there
were no significant gender differences among couples in
the general population as per the study findings of Jack-
son et al and Gager et al. [10, 12].

Various types of marriage and relationship program
and

to increase marriages

currently

exist

(MRP)

relationships, including education/communication skills,
enrichment, premarital, counseling, and therapy pro-
grams [13]. A meta-analysis published in 2005 has
shown the effect of MRP on couples’ relationship satis-
faction and communication [13]. Also, the recent litera-
ture and the meta-analysis by Jackson et al.
indicates
that there has been a substantial shift in the distribution
of power in marital relationships over the last few de-
cades [10]. According to our knowledge, no recent sys-
tematic meta-analysis or study has investigated the
impact of MRP on couple satisfaction. Although there
were some studies conducted between 2000 and 2019,
they have investigated/ reviewed only one specific pro-
gram such as marriage education [14] or focused only
on a particular outcome, such as sexual function [15].
Furthermore, as mentioned above, there is a contradic-
tion among moderator variables crucial to practitioners
and policymakers, e.g., participants’ gender differences.

Our meta-analysis exercise aimed to conduct a com-
prehensive review of articles published in the last 20
years that investigated the effect of MRP on couples’ re-
lationship satisfaction (CRS) and couples’ relationship
communication (CRC) and also to determine any gender
differences.

Methods
Search strategy
The current meta-analysis was conducted according to
recommendations and standards set by the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses
[16]. A
systematic literature review was performed in all major
databases for interventional studies that examined the
efficacy of MRP interventions and used CRS and/or
CRC as an outcome. Both published and unpublished
studies were searched by a health sciences librarian in
the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, ProQuest,
and Cochrane Library up to July 26, 2019. Besides, a
hand search was performed by selecting seemingly rele-
vant articles from the reference list of each included
study. To access the concepts of satisfaction, communi-
cation, relationship/marriage program, couple and inter-
vention, and numerous text word phrases, using both
and truncation to reach the
adjacency operators

variations in spelling and phrasing, were utilized. Syn-
onymous phrases were first composed with the Boolean
“OR”. The five concepts (i.e., satisfaction, communica-
tion, relationship/marriage program, couple, and inter-
vention) were then composed with the Boolean “AND”.
As detailed in Fig. 1, this search resulted in 5701 non-
duplicated records.

Inclusion criteria
We developed inclusion and exclusion criteria using the
PICO framework. Population: heterosexual couples who
had an intimate relationship were included. Couples
were excluded if they had an alcohol addiction, a history
of suffering from mental
illness or cancer and other
chronic diseases, being infertile or pregnant; Interven-
tion: marriage and relationship programs. Therapeutic
interventions were excluded from providing a clear de-
psychoeducational
scription of

effects

the

of

a

intervention. Therapeutic interventions generally have
more substantial results than psychoeducational
inter-
ventions. Studies that aimed to increase sexual function-
ing were also excluded. Comparison: marriage and
relationship programs versus no-treatment / waiting list
control group; Outcomes: measures of CRS and/or CRC
with sufficient information to calculate standardized ef-
fect sizes and weights.

Studies reported both wife and husband outcome data
trials
separately. Studies include randomized control
(RCTs) design and/or
studies using randomization
method, random assignment to intervention and control
group, and having a control group. The experimental
studies were excluded if they had no control group. To
be included, a study must have been published between
2000 and 2019 as a full research article and included all
the data required to calculate intervention effects with
no language barrier.

Study selection process
The study selection process began with a title and ab-
stract screening by two independent reviewers (ZJ and
SA). The selection was based on the inclusion criteria.
Articles passing the initial screen were then retrieved
and reviewed by ZJ and SA. Reasons for exclusion are
listed in Fig. 1. Any disagreements in regard to the selec-
tion of articles were resolved by discussion among the
four reviewers after reaching an agreement (Zj, HA, MA,
and SA). The selected articles were managed by END-
NOTE X9 software. Duplicate studies were excluded. Al-
though two papers were in the Korean language [17, 18],
the most important parts, such as tables, were available
in English, and therefore the other required contents
were translated using Google translator (Google, 2019).

Outcome measures
We coded measures of relationship quality that assessed
two main domains: Relationship satisfaction/dissatisfac-
tion and Relationship communication. All studies (n =
12) used standardized measures included the following:
Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) [19] (n = 4), Couples
Satisfaction Index (CSI) [20] (n = 2), Enrich Marital Sat-
isfaction Scale (EMSS) [21], Kansas Marital Satisfaction
Scale (KMSS) [22], Index of Marital Satisfaction (IMS)
[23], Quality of Marriage Index (QMI) [24], Enriching
Relationship Issues, Communication and Happiness [21],
and Partnership Questionnaire (PQ) [25] for assessing
relationship satisfaction (RS). For the area/domain of
RC, Communication Skill Test (CST) [26] (n = 2), Mari-
tal
[27]; Marital
Communication Inventory (MCI) [28], Prepare/Enrich
Assessment [20] (n = 2), Communication Deterioration
Factors tool (CDF) [29], and Partnership Questionnaire
(PQ) [26] were used.

Interaction Coding System (MICS)

We examined both immediate post-assessments and
follow-up assessments, reporting these separately to re-
improvement (or deterioration) during the time.
veal
Timing of
follow-up for experimental studies ranged
from 3 to 48 months; Einhorn (2010) and Carson (2004)
follow-up assessments hold after three (3) months and
six (6) months, respectively. Only Haldfor (2000) evalu-
ated the effects of their transition to Self-Regulatory Pre-
vention and Relationship Enhancement Program (Self-
PREP) greater than 12 months of
intervention at 12
months and 48 months post-assessment. Considerably,
most other studies had only post-assessments without
any follow-up.

Data extraction
We classified interventions according to the type of pro-
gram defined by each article’s author(s), including En-
richment, Education/Communication skills, Counseling
and Therapy programs. Other relevant information such

as the authors’ names, publication year, the country
where the trials were conducted, characteristics of a
couple (distressed or un-distressed), study design, type
of intervention, the measurement scales, and outcomes
were extracted as shown below (Table 1).

Risk of bias
The risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane Collab-
oration tool [38], which included six domains, as shown
in Fig. 2. Accordingly, each domain was assessed as hav-
ing a low, unclear, or high risk of bias.

Generation of effect sizes and data analysis
The mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) were calculated using Stata Corp Stata 16 soft-
ware. The MD divided by the study’s standard deviation
was used to create an index, the standardized MD that
would be comparable across the studies. This is the ap-
proach suggested by Cohen [39] to describe the magni-
tude of statistical power analysis effects.

All the studies had provided quantitative data and the
weighted mean difference with 95% CI. Heterogeneity
was assessed through I squared (I2) statistics, and the
criterion of significance was I2 > 50%. The reported sum-
mary statistics were calculated as random effects models
based on heterogeneity between the studies model. The
chi-square test for heterogeneity was performed to de-
termine whether the results’ distribution was compatible
with the assumption that inter-trial differences were at-
tributable to chance variation alone. The level of statis-
tical significance was set at 0.05 a priori. The presence
of publication bias was examined using funnel plots and
the Egger regression test. To reduce heterogeneity and
test the results’ robustness, both the subgroup analysis
and sensitivity analysis were performed.

Results
The literature search from various databases has identi-
fied 6847 publications up to July 26, 2019, of which 1146
were excluded as they were duplicates. Around 4400 ti-
tles and 1160 abstracts were excluded during the initial
screening for the titles and abstracts, and 162 articles
were considered for the retrieval of the full texts. Finally,
after a detailed assessment, 130 studies were included.
An additional eleven studies were obtained by cross-
referencing making a final total of 141 studies at this
stage. Of the total 141 articles that could be retrieved,
thirteen articles were excluded due to a lack of a control
group. And among the remaining 116 full-text articles,
71 were excluded due to the lack of statistical informa-
tion and not receiving email replies from the authors.
Additionally, another 45 articles were excluded as they
have not reported the effect size for both wife and hus-
band separately (n = 45). Finally, 12 articles remained

Description of studies
The basic characteristics of the studies are shown in
Table 1. According to the type of programs mentioned
above, this review contained 76 evaluations of therapy
programs, 35 education/communication skills programs,
twenty (20) enrichment programs, and ten (10) counsel-
computation and
ing programs. However, during

reporting of effect sizes, among the 12 studies that
remained for meta-analysis for RS, five (5) were educa-
tion/communication skills programs, three (3) enrich-
ment programs, and four (4) therapy programs. Among
the eight studies that remained for meta-analysis for RC,
five (5) were education/communication skills programs,
two (2) were enrichment programs, and the last one be-
ing a therapy program. Usually, therapy and counseling
programs happen in a clinical setting with a trained
psychologist providing treatment. These programs can
be based upon a variety of different treatment formats.

Risk of bias
The risk of bias was assessed for clinical trials. The bias
such as the unclear risk of selection bias (due to lack of
information on the method of randomization n = 11 and
concealment, n = 12), performance bias (due to lack of
information on blinding of participants and personnel, n
= 12), and detection bias (blinding of outcome assess-
ment, n = 12) were observed. The risk of bias for the in-
cluded studies was low for reporting bias, attrition bias,
and other sources of bias (Fig. 2).

Effects of interventions (meta-analysis results)
Of the total 12 interventions, the impact of five (5) edu-
cation/communication skills programs, three (3) enrich-
ment programs, and four (4) therapy programs were
investigated on RS among couples.

The pooled MD was 0.28 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.49, I2 =
79.3% p = 0.0001), 0.24 (95% CI = − 0.12 to 0.60, I2 =
78.7%, p = 0.855), 0.53 (95% CI = 0.35 to 0.71, I2 = 71.5%,
p < 0.0001 0.000) respectively. As a result, the therapy pro-
grams showed the medium to large effect on CRS and
educational programs showed small to medium effect. But
the heterogeneity among studies was high. Enhancement
programs showed no effect on CRS (Fig. 3A). In the area
of RC, the enhancement programs showed small to large
effect on CRC (pooled MD 1.31 (95% CI = 0.13 to 2.50, I2
= 94.7% p = 0.0001)) similar to the educational programs
which also showed small to medium effect (pooled
MD 0.32 (95% CI = 0.13 to 0.50, I2 = 74.5% p =
0.0001). However,
the heterogeneity among these
studies was high (Fig. 5A).

Subgroup analysis
The subgroup analysis conducted for following variables:
gender differences (men, women), number of sessions (1:
fewer 5 sessions, 2: between 5 and 10 sessions, 3: more
than 10 sessions and workshop), total hours of interven-
tions (1: fewer 10 h, 2: between 10 and 15 h, 3: more than
15 h), distress
(distressed and non-distressed),
program type (therapy, enrichment, education/communi-
cation skills, and counseling). These variables were consid-
and
ered
communication effects based on previous literatures [10,
13, 14]. Subgroup analyses show that effect sizes are differ-
ent for different subgroups of studies in current study.

In the RS area, the gender-based subgroup analysis
showed the therapies had a more significant effect size
on wives than husbands, and education was only effect-
ive for wives and enhancement programs with no effect
for both couples (Fig. 3B). The subgroup analysis based
on the number of sessions showed the between 5 and 10
sessions had a medium to large effect on CRS, and more
than ten (10) sessions and workshops had small
to
medium effect but with high heterogeneity. Moreover,

Focused Marital Therapy (SFMT). Education and com-
munications skills programs tend to be didactic and sup-
port both distressed and non-distressed couples.
Enrichment programs are usually limited to normal and
healthy couples.

Most (n = 9) studies were conducted in high-income
countries where seven (7) studies are from the USA, one
(1) from Germany, and one (1) from Australia. Further-
more, only seven three were conducted in upper- and
lower-middle-income countries: 2 from Korea, one (1)
from China. The studies included in the meta-analysis
had data from 4565 participants (2460 cases and / 2105
controls). All of
entered studies have used
randomization methods, random assignment to inter-
vention and control group, and had a control group.
However, three (3) studies have reported their study de-
sign was a quasi-experimental study [17, 30, 32].

the

The educational method for Li (2015), Einhorn (2010),
and Allen (2011) studies were a weekend workshop; for
Alvaro (2001) study, it was held as a seminar, and Doss’s
(2016) study ran online calling and chatting. Others used
the trained psychologist or trainers for the operation of
programs in defined sessions. Kong (2005) and Halford
(2000) studies evaluated relationship satisfaction pro-
grams with five (5) sessions; Young-Ran (2012), Carson
(2004), and Kroger (2017) were between 5 and 10 ses-
sions (6, 8, and 9 sessions perceptively); Hrapczynski
(2008) had ten (10) and Shapo (2001) had 12 sessions.
For communication skill programs, Alvaro (2001), Allen
(2011), and Kroger (2017) have included less than five
sessions (4, 4, and 3 sessions perceptively), and Kong
(2005), Hrapczynski (2008), Einhorn (2010), Young-Ran
(2012), and Li (2015) have held more than five sessions
(5, 10, 5, 6, and 6 sessions respectively). Most of the ses-
sions in these studies have lasted for 10 h and above.
From the 12 studies, five (5) studies assessed distressed
couples, six (6) studies contained non-distressed couples,
and one (1) study contained both distressed and non-
distressed couples.

fewer than five (5) sessions did not affect couples’ rela-
tionship satisfaction (Fig. 3C). The subgroup analysis
based on both the number of sessions and gender
showed between 5 and 10 sessions had a larger effect
size on husbands than wives. However, the workshop
had no impact, and more than ten (10) sessions had the
same effect on husband and wives (Fig. 3D). The sub-
interventions
group analysis based on total hours of
showed fewer than 10 h of intervention had a medium
to large effect on CRS while the more than 10 h had a
small to medium effect (Fig. 4A). The subgroup analysis
based on both hours and gender showed fewer than 10 h
of intervention had a larger effect on wives’ relationship
satisfaction than husbands. In contrast, between 10 and
15 h of intervention were effective only for husbands
(Fig. 4B).

distressed couples showed interventions had small to
medium effects on both distressed and non-distressed
couples but with high heterogeneity (Fig. 4C). The sub-
group analysis based on both distress/non-distressed and
gender showed the interventions had a small to medium
effect on both distressed wives and husbands but no ef-
fect on both non-distressed wives and husbands (Fig.
4D). As well, subgroup analysis based on distressed level,
program type, and gender showed the only therapy pro-
grams were effective for both distressed wives and hus-
bands and merely for non-distressed husband with small
to larger effect without heterogeneity. Therapies and
educational/communication skills were non-effective for
both distressed and non-distressed wives and husbands.
Sensitivity analysis did not apply to these results due to
non-existing outlier data.

In the RC domain, the gender-based subgroup analysis
showed that “education” was effective only for wives
(Fig. 5B). The subgroup analysis based on the “number
of sessions” showed that more than 5 sessions had a
small to medium effect and less than 5 sessions had
small to large effect on couples’ relationship communi-
cation (CRC) but with high heterogeneity (Fig. 5C). The
subgroup analysis based on both the “number of ses-
sions” and “gender” showed that less than 5 sessions had
a small to medium effect on husbands with no effect on
wives. Conversely, more than 5 sessions had a small to
large effect on wives with no effect on husbands (Fig.
5D). The subgroup analysis based on “total hours of in-
terventions” showed a small to large effect on CRC for
interventions between 10 and 15 h (Fig. 6A). The sub-
group analysis based on both “hours of intervention”
and “gender” showed a small to larger effect on both
husband and wives’ relationship communication for
interventions between 10 and 15 h. In contrast, more
than 10 h of
intervention were effective only for
wives (Fig. 6B).

The subgroup analysis based on “distressed” and “non-
distressed” couples showed that interventions had “small
to medium” effects on distressed couples and “small to
large” effect among non-distressed couples but with high
heterogeneity (Fig. 6C). The subgroup analysis based on
both “distress/non-distressed” and “gender” showed that
the interventions had “small to medium” effect among
the distressed wives and “small to large” effect on non-
distressed wives with no effect on distressed and non-
distressed husbands (Fig. 6D).

Publication bias
Funnel plot 12 studies showed no evidence suggestive
of publication bias, and also, the results of the Egger
test were insignificant for publication bias (p = 0.460)
(Fig. 7).

Discussion
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate
more critically the effects of recently two past decade
MRP on CRS and CRC. Our analyses provide simple
and clear evidence that MRPs have a “small to moder-
ate” effect size in the overall improvement of both the
CRS (0.22 to 0.50) and CRC (0.30 to 0.73). However, in
our study it was found that the effect size was similar for
both wives and husbands. The previous meta-analysis
[13] had shown a moderate to larger effect size (0.54 to
0.82) on CRS while it was found to be small to medium
effect on CRC (0.06 to 0.45) without any analysis on the
gender differences. These variations may be due to dif-
ferences in inclusion criteria, types of studies, and differ-
ences in included studies’ methodological characteristics.
Furthermore, the findings from the vast literature indi-
cate that there has been a substantial shift in the distri-
bution of power in marital relationships over the last few
decades [10].

Looking at differences in effect sizes across character-
istics of programs discloses some similarities and differ-
ences between this study and previous meta-analyses. In
our study, while comparing the program types (therapy,
enrichment, education/communication skills, and coun-
seling), any study that contained counseling program did
not meet our eligibility/inclusion criteria. In contrast,
the previous meta-analyses included all program types
and counseling had the more effect size. Consistent with
Anderson’s study, therapies were most effective com-
pared to education and enrichment programs. The
meta-analysis by Hawkins et al. [14] on marriage and re-
lationship education on relationship quality has shown
small effect sizes (0.30 to 0.36) similar to our study (0.01
to 0.40). In this study, the type of RC programs was in
coherence with Anderson’s study that assessed therapy,
enrichment, and education/communication skills for im-
proving CRC. In this meta-analysis, although all program

types were effective in improving couples’ communica-
tion, in Anderson’s study only education/ communica-
tion skills programs were found to be effective with
“small to large” effect. Reasons for this difference may be
related to the advent of modern techniques in couple
therapy compared to the past.

Due to the high effect of the therapy programs on CRS
and enhancement program on CRC in the current meta-

analysis, the priority of their utilizations in interventions
by psychologists and mental health professionals should
be emphasized. Besides, our finding showed that therapy
programs in improving RS and educational programs for
RC are found to be more effective for women than men.
The probable reason could be that
the dissatisfied
women are more likely to go to clinics and seek treat-
ment to improve their condition [10], so that the early

treatment may have a greater impact on them compared
to men. The meta-analysis by Jackson et al. [10] showed
that the dissatisfaction is higher among wives who were
referred to marital therapy than the wives in the general
population. Also, the wives who were referred to marital
therapy were less likely to be satisfied with their marital
relationship than the husbands.

Because of the small effect of educational programs on
CRS and CRC, the same as the previous meta-analysis
[13], future researchers should implement high quality
with innovative strategies developed by psychoeduca-
tional professionals and researchers for enhancing the
effectiveness. In support of the findings from Anderson’s
meta-analyses, the enhancement programs were non-

effective in CRS but a large effect on CRC. As enhance-
ment programs are usually developed for non-stressed
couples, they might not be very serious about leaning
programs and practicing with a partner. Moreover, con-
sistent with our study, previous studies showed that
MRP was less effective for RS of non-distressed couple
samples than the distressed sample [13, 14]. Although
this study indicated MRPs are effective on RC of both
distressed and non-distressed couple, previous studies
showed that MRP had no effect on RC of “non-dis-
tressed couple” samples compared to the “distressed
couple” sample.

Surprisingly, MRP had more effectiveness for RS of
distressed women than did for men and in case of RC of
both distressed and non-distressed women, MRP had ef-
fectiveness, while it was non-effective for men. There-
fore, mental health planning in communities to develop
MRP and care for couples’ health should be given special
attention to men’s health. Future
should
prioritize special MRPs to improve RS of distressed men
and RC of distressed and non-distressed men.

studies

The polled effect size for RS programs with 5 to 10
sessions had a larger effect than programs with more
than 10 sessions, while for RC programs with 5 to 10
sessions had a larger effect than programs with less than
5 sessions. Anderson’s study has indicated 5 or more
sessions of RS program and RC program are more ef-
fective than fewer ones. However, in both studies, less
than 10 h of RS and RC programs were more effective
than 10 h and above. It seems that in addition to hours
and sessions, other factors might be related to increasing
effectiveness in MRP. In other words, the longer session
or hours might not guarantee the effectiveness of MRP;
using beneficial and practical content might be more ef-
fective than the number of hours and sessions.

Further studies are needed to examine factors that can
enhance the effectiveness of MRP. It is considered that

the fewer sessions and hours were more effective for
husbands than wives, but with increased sessions and
hours, both had the same output in RSP. However, the
longer sessions and hours were more effective for wives
than husbands in RCP. The other aspect to highlight is
that the compact sessions such as seminars and work-
shops were not effective for the husbands in RSP. That
means the husbands might need fewer sessions and
fewer hours through consecutive sessions,
instead of
compact ones such as a workshop, to enhance the RS.
Therefore, it would be more interesting if future studies
examine the effect of the number of sessions and hours
of MRPs between couples and their differences among
wives and husbands separately.

In the present study, most studies have been con-
ducted in developed countries such as the USA. Such
programs are negligible/ not popular in developing
countries due to their poor socio-economic and political
conditions. So, providing and supporting opportunities
for utilization MRPs and conducting high-quality re-
search in developing countries will play a considerable
role in narrowing this gap and increasing their CRS and
CRC and family psychological well-being [7, 40].

The level of heterogeneity in our results was high. This
finding is not surprising as the reviewed studies were
used different scales in different cultures with differences
in the sample size. The minimum sample size was esti-
mated to be 29, and the maximum was 461 participants.
The duration of interventions varied from a 1-day sem-
inar to 12 weeks. The duration for the majority of the in-
terventions ranged from 5 to 10 weeks. Therefore, the
heterogeneity of effect size cannot be linked to the stud-
ies’ duration as there is no evidence of an association be-
tween the duration of intervention and effect size.

Delimitations and limitations of the study must be ac-
knowledged. Different types of interventional programs
and the pooling of various treatments together may be
considered as we found other factors for the heterogen-
eity in our study findings. By applying the random effect
model, we have tried to control heterogeneity to account
for various studies’ variations. We also conducted a sub-
group analysis to decrease heterogeneity and sensitivity
analysis to assess the soundness of the results. However,
no substantial reduction was detected in the observed
heterogeneity. Variation in the tools applied to measure
the change in MRP was recognized as a main limiting
factor.

Additionally, a few numbers of measures were not val-
idated. The nocebo effect is a substantial problem in
psychosocial interventions [41]. In psychosocial studies,
the absence of blinding and the failure in adjusting for
the nocebo effect in the analysis were regarded as limita-
tions in determining the true intervention effects. Due to
the high heterogeneity of the results and with scanty

for men,

Conclusion
Our finding showed that for women, therapy programs
are more effective in improving RS and educational pro-
grams for RC than men. Surprisingly, MRP had more ef-
fectiveness for RS of distressed women than did for men,
and RC of both distressed and non-distressed women,
MRP had effectiveness, while,
it was non-
effective. Therefore, planning mental health for commu-
nities to develop MRP, care for couples’ health and
men’s health should be given special attention. Due to
the high effect of the therapy programs on CRS and en-
hancement programs on CRC in this meta-analysis, the
importance of their utilizations through the interven-
tions, especially by psychologists and mental health pro-
fessionals,
Furthermore,
psychologists and mental health professionals should
consider developing programs with fewer sessions and
instead of
fewer hours through consecutive sessions,
compact ones such as workshops to enhance men’s RS.
Additional research exploring the gender differences and
the gaps between developed and developing countries is
warranted as there are very few studies from developing
countries. It would also be helpful to examine more
closely the long-term effects of MRPs on CRS and CRC
through well-designed RCTs with larger sample size.
Lastly, it would be important to examine possible gender
differences in marital satisfaction and communication
among non-heterosexual couples as well.
