Abstract

Background and Objectives: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) enhances psycho-
logical flexibility by fostering acceptance of thoughts and emotions, promoting mindfulness
practices, and encouraging engagement in value-based actions. These processes have been
associated with improvements in mental health and social functioning, with accumulating
evidence supporting ACT’s efficacy across various psychiatric disorders. This systematic review
aimed to evaluate current evidence on ACT interventions for reducing psychiatric symptoms
and enhancing social functioning and interpersonal relationships in adults with psychiatric
conditions. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed,
Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies published between 2014 and 2024.
The review protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF; registration ID:
2ZAGT). Results: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria; however, the evidence base
remained fragmented, with most psychiatric diagnoses represented by only one or two studies.
The reviewed studies exhibited several methodological limitations, including small sample
sizes, lack of randomization and blinding, high risk of bias, reliance on subjective outcome
measures, and inadequately designed or absent control groups. Despite these limitations, ACT
was associated with beneficial effects in conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
insomnia, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorder, particularly in reducing experiential avoid-
ance, enhancing mindfulness, and promoting long-term improvements in emotional regulation
and life satisfaction. Conclusions: Due to the limited number of studies per diagnosis, significant
methodological weaknesses, and the lack of high-quality controlled trials, this review cannot
provide strong evidence for the efficacy of ACT in improving social functioning among adults
with psychiatric disorders. The heterogeneity and overall low quality of the available literature
highlight the urgent need for further large-scale well-controlled studies.

biological factors contribute to their development, environmental factors, such as stress and
interpersonal relationships, play a crucial role in determining their course as risk factors
or protective factors [2,3]. A common consequence of many psychiatric disorders is social
impairment, characterized by difficulties in building and maintaining interpersonal con-
nections, which often exacerbates the underlying condition [4,5]. Social functioning is the
ability to effectively engage with and adapt to social and environmental demands [6]. This
complex integration of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes is often impaired
in conditions such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and chronic pain [7–10]. These
impairments are frequently overlooked until the psychiatric condition has fully developed,
compounding the challenges faced by affected individuals. Addressing social reintegration
is, therefore, a critical component of effective therapeutic approaches, as social relationships
play a fundamental role in overall well-being [11,12]. Traditional treatments for psychiatric
disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and social skills training, have fo-
cused on improving social functioning by restructuring maladaptive thought patterns and
enhancing social interaction skills [13–17]. However, there is a growing interest in innova-
tive approaches that address the psychological flexibility underlying social impairments.
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), developed by Hayes, Wilson, and Strosahl, is
a behavioral therapy based on psychological flexibility. ACT emphasizes accepting rather
than avoiding difficult emotions and thoughts, mindfulness, and engaging in behaviors
aligned with personal values [18,19]. This approach encourages individuals to engage
more fully with the present moment, enabling them to navigate life’s challenges with
greater adaptability while fostering long-term well-being [20]. A core element of ACT is
acceptance, which involves developing an open stance toward distressing emotions and
thoughts. Rather than suppressing or avoiding these experiences, individuals are encour-
aged to acknowledge them without judgment [21]. This approach reduces the energy in
fighting emotions, allowing individuals to focus on meaningful pursuits [22]. Acceptance
promotes resilience by helping individuals view discomfort as a natural part of life rather
than a barrier to progress. To complement acceptance, ACT introduces cognitive defusion,
a strategy aimed at changing the individual’s relationship with their thoughts [23–25]. In
ACT, thoughts are not seen as commands or truths but as fleeting mental events. Techniques
such as visualizing a troubling thought as a leaf floating down a stream or repeating it aloud
until it loses its emotional weight help individuals disentangle themselves from unhelpful
cognitive patterns [26,27]. This process empowers individuals to respond to their thoughts
with flexibility and creativity rather than reacting out of fear or habit. Mindfulness further
strengthens psychological flexibility by promoting present and focused non-judgmental
awareness [28–30]. By encouraging individuals to fully experience the present moment
(whether through observing their breath, noting bodily sensations, or attentively engaging
with their environment), ACT helps cultivate clarity and calmness. Mindfulness fosters
an ability to pause and reflect, enabling individuals to respond thoughtfully rather than
impulsively to challenging situations [31,32]. Central to ACT’s efficacy is its focus on value
clarification, which involves helping individuals identify the principles and aspirations that
matter most to them. This process guides individuals in uncovering what gives their life
meaning, whether it is fostering relationships, pursuing professional goals, or contributing
to a cause [33,34]. Once these values are identified, ACT supports individuals in taking
committed action, encouraging them to persist in value-driven behaviors despite obstacles
or discomfort. This alignment of actions with deeply held values often leads to a renewed
sense of purpose and fulfillment [35,36]. ACT offers a holistic approach that enhances
social connections and personal growth. It helps individuals shift from a cycle of avoid-
ance and fear to one of acceptance and meaningful engagement, promoting resilience and
adaptability in the face of life’s challenges [37]. Studies also highlight its impact on altering

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

behaviors and enhancing well-being in individuals recovering from conditions like colorec-
tal cancer [38–40]. By addressing psychological and behavioral patterns underlying social
impairments, ACT promotes interpersonal growth and fosters stronger connections within
diverse populations [41,42]. However, despite growing evidence for traditional treatments
such as CBT and social skills training, these approaches often fall short in addressing the
experiential avoidance and psychological inflexibility that contribute to long-term social
dysfunction. Social impairments are often multifaceted and resistant to symptom-focused
interventions, highlighting the need for therapies that integrate cognitive, emotional, and
behavioral change mechanisms. The primary objective of this systematic review is to
evaluate the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in improving
social functioning among adults with psychiatric disorders. Secondary objectives include
assessing the impact of ACT on psychological flexibility, emotional regulation, and the
quality of interpersonal relationships, and evaluating whether ACT demonstrates differ-
ential efficacy across various psychiatric diagnoses. This systematic review examines the
evidence supporting ACT’s effectiveness in improving social functioning among adults
with psychiatric disorders. By focusing on ACT’s unique processes, this review aims to
highlight its potential as a therapeutic tool for addressing social impairments and guiding
clinical practice and future research.

2. Materials and Methods

This review focused on evaluating the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy
(ACT), rather than its effectiveness, to provide a clearer understanding of the interven-
tion’s potential under controlled experimental conditions. Given the primary aim of this
work—to assess the core psychological processes targeted by ACT and their association
with specific psychiatric outcomes—we prioritized studies designed to test causal mecha-
nisms, typically conducted in structured research settings. While some included studies
that reflect real-world implementations, the emphasis on efficacy was necessary to reduce
variability introduced by contextual and delivery factors and to better isolate the theoretical
components of ACT responsible for change. This approach allows for a more rigorous as-
sessment of ACT’s therapeutic impact across psychiatric diagnoses, laying the groundwork
for future investigations into its effectiveness in routine clinical practice.

2.1. Inclusion Criteria

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patients affected by psychiatric disorders (e.g.,
depression, psychosis, PTSD, anxiety); (ii) randomized clinical trials (RCT), pilot studies,
and observational studies; (iii) studies published between 2014 and 2024; (iv) studies
using ACT as the main therapeutic intervention; (v) studies assessing social functioning or
related domains (e.g., social support, psychological flexibility, interpersonal functioning);
(v) English language; and (vi) published in a peer-reviewed journal.

2.2. Exclusion Criteria

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies that combined ACT with other
treatments without isolating ACT-specific effects; (ii) studies involving mixed or heteroge-
neous populations not limited to individuals with psychiatric diagnoses; (iii) studies with
insufficient design to determine causal efficacy (e.g., retrospective, case reports, narrative
reviews); (iv) studies focused on non-psychiatric populations (e.g., chronic medical illnesses
without psychiatric diagnosis); (v) studies involving psychiatric disorders in children and
adolescents (age < 18 years); (vi) studies that reported insufficient methodological detail to
assess efficacy or outcome relevance.

2.3. PICO Evaluation

We utilized the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) model to es-
tablish our search terms. The population focused on adults diagnosed with psychiatric
disorders, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia, psychosis (including early and
complex presentations), autism spectrum disorders, and treatment-resistant or comorbid
conditions. The intervention included all studies using the ACT approach, delivered in in-
dividual, group, or digital formats. The comparison involved analyzing psychotherapeutic
interventions based on ACT and other conventional treatments, such as CBT, psychoe-
ducation, communication training, and treatment-as-usual. The outcomes included any
measurable improvements in psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, hallucina-
tions), as well as data on social functioning, quality of life, interpersonal relationships, and
psychological flexibility. Table 1 provides a visually and organized summary of the PICO
framework and study inclusion criteria.

This table summarizes the core components of the PICO framework (population, intervention, comparison,
outcome) used to structure the search strategy and define eligibility criteria. It outlines the target population,
the type of interventions included, comparator conditions, and relevant outcomes. The inclusion criteria were
designed to ensure methodological transparency and support the clinical relevance of the findings.

2.4. Search Strategy

This systematic review employed a structured search strategy based on the PICO
framework and was conducted between the 5 June 2024 and the 31 July 2024. The search
was limited to studies published between 2014 and 2024 in order to capture the most
relevant and recent evidence on the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
in improving social functioning among adults with psychiatric disorders. The studies
were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase
databases. These platforms were selected for their complementary scope and method-
ological rigor: PubMed was added because it has the broadest and most comprehensive
indexing of biomedical and psychological literature, which is particularly pertinent for
identifying studies of mental health interventions and clinical outcomes. Web of Science
was selected because of its multidisciplinary access and its strong citation indexing capac-
ities, which enable research that is shaping and being shaped by both the psychological
and psychiatric fields to be identified. The Cochrane Library was chosen because of its
focus on high-quality systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, which provide
the best evidence on the efficacy of treatment interventions. Finally, we searched Embase

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

5 of 24

(due to its depth in clinical, drug, and psychiatric research content) to ensure a complete
search across peer-reviewed studies on ACT and psychosocial functioning. Although the
search strategy did not undergo a formal PRESS review, it was internally peer-reviewed by
two authors with experience in systematic reviews and database searching to ensure clarity,
comprehensiveness, and methodological soundness. The full Boolean search string used in
PubMed was as follows:

(“mental disorders”[MeSH Terms] OR (“mental”[All Fields] AND “disorders”[All
Fields]) OR “mental disorders”[All Fields] OR (“psychiatric”[All Fields] AND
“disorder”[All Fields]) OR “psychiatric disorder”[All Fields]) AND (“acceptance and
commitment therapy”[MeSH Terms] OR (“acceptance”[All Fields] AND “commitment”[All
Fields] AND “therapy”[All Fields]) OR “acceptance and commitment therapy”[All
Fields]) AND (“social interaction”[MeSH Terms] OR (“social”[All Fields] AND
“interaction”[All Fields]) OR “social interaction”[All Fields] OR (“social”[All
Fields] AND “functioning”[All Fields]) OR “social functioning”[All Fields])

Equivalent search terms were adapted to the syntax requirements of each database.
Core terms included variations of psychiatric disorders, ACT-based interventions, and
outcomes related to social functioning and interpersonal relationships. A summary table of
the core keywords used across databases is provided in the Supplementary Material. This
multistep approach ensured a comprehensive, reproducible, and methodologically robust
identification of relevant studies assessing the impact of ACT on psychological symptoms
and social outcomes in psychiatric populations. Table 2 provides the PICO elements and
the keywords/terms used for the search stategy.

upon request.

2.4.1. Data Extraction

Validated search strategies were independently developed and internally peer-
reviewed by 2 reviewers (DL, GM) to warrant methodological rigor and transparency
in the analysis of the efficacy of ACT on social functioning in adult psychiatric partici-
pants. The latter underwent iterative refinement, which included the addition of Boolean
operators (AND, OR), keyword synonyms, and controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH) fields,
with the goal of achieving balance between sensitivity and specificity, given the target
of our review towards ACT-specific mechanisms. The selection procedure followed the
PRISMA approach (identification, screening, eligibility, and composition) and is presented
in Figure 1. Title, abstract, and full-text screening against eligibility criteria for studies
related to ACT’s effect on social functioning was completed by both reviewers. Further-
more, independent data extraction and cross-validation were performed to minimize bias
(publication, language, and time-lag bias). Data extracted were study design, number

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

of participants, demographic characteristics of the participants, psychiatric disorders, in-
tervention description, and outcomes specifically related to social functioning, such as
psychological flexibility, acceptance, defusion, mindfulness, and value-based behavior
change. To guarantee that applicable, extractable, and analyzable data could be found
during the screening and data extraction process, a multi-step inter-rater reliability protocol
was applied. All titles, abstracts, and full texts were reviewed independently by both
reviewers. In addition to the Kappa statistic, with >0.61 being considered substantial agree-
ment, raw percentage agreement was also determined to yield a broader perspective of
agreement. For each stage, a calibration exercise was performed on a sample of the articles
before the screening itself started to align interpretations of the eligibility criteria. We con-
ducted regular consensus meetings during both attenuation and extraction to reconcile any
differences in study inclusion or data extraction. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer
(RSC) served as an adjudicator to reach a final decision. This procedure guarantees that all
propriety decisions were transparent, clearly documented, and methodologically appro-
priate. Data extraction was also conducted in duplicate and cross-validated to minimize
bias (e.g., publication, language, and time-lag bias). Data were systematically recorded
using a custom-designed Excel template to ensure consistency with inclusion/exclusion
criteria and enable tagging, sorting, and resolution of discrepancies. A thematic synthesis
approach was employed to structure the final dataset, with an emphasis on therapeutic
components relevant to ACT’s impact on social connectedness and recovery.

Extracted data included study design and methodology; sample size and demographic
characteristics; psychiatric diagnosis; detailed ACT intervention characteristics; outcomes
related to social functioning, including psychological flexibility, acceptance, cognitive
defusion, mindfulness, and value-based behavioral change. This review has been registered
on Open OSF (n) 2ZAGTand adheres to PRISMA-S 2021 reporting guidelines. A completed
PRISMA-S checklist and the full search strategies for all databases are available in the
Supplementary Material.

2.4.2. Data Synthesis

Themes were inductively generated using a thematic synthesis approach, identifying
recurring patterns across psychiatric diagnoses, ACT intervention characteristics, and tar-
geted psychological mechanisms. This method enabled the extraction of key therapeutic
domains, including acceptance, cognitive defusion, mindfulness, and values-based ac-
tion. Considering the heterogeneity in study designs, patient populations, and outcome
measures related to social functioning in psychiatric disorders, a narrative synthesis was
employed to integrate findings across diverse methodologies. This combined magnification
model allowed for the evaluation of ACT’s overall effectiveness by aggregating data from
varied research designs and diagnostic groups. The narrative synthesis facilitated the iden-
tification of core psychological processes underpinning ACT-related change, specifically
acceptance, defusion, mindfulness, and value-driven action. Studies were systematically
coded by psychiatric diagnosis, intervention features, and measured outcomes related to
both social and psychological domains. This framework enabled a nuanced examination of
how different ACT components influence interpersonal functioning. Themes were devel-
oped by mapping recurrent ACT mechanisms (e.g., acceptance, values) to social functioning
outcomes across diagnostic categories. The quality of evidence was assessed using pre-
defined criteria, with studies categorized by methodological rigor, sample characteristics,
and the degree to which outcome measures aligned with ACT’s theoretical framework.
A multidisciplinary team of reviewers independently analyzed and interpreted the data,
engaging in regular consensus meetings to minimize interpretative bias. The trustwor-
thiness of thematic interpretations was enhanced through this collaborative and iterative
process. Overall, the synthesized findings offer balanced and multidimensional insights
into the potential of ACT as a recovery-oriented intervention to improve social functioning
in psychiatric populations, while also outlining key directions for future research and
clinical application.

2.5. Subgroup and Sensitivity Considerations

Due to the heterogeneity of study populations, intervention formats, and outcome
measures, a formal subgroup or sensitivity analysis was not statistically feasible. However,
we performed a structured narrative comparison across diagnostic groups (e.g., psychosis,
PTSD, GAD), ACT delivery formats (individual, group, digital), and levels of methodologi-
cal quality (low vs. moderate vs. high risk of bias). The synthesis highlights how ACT’s
effects on social functioning may vary depending on psychiatric diagnosis and intervention
characteristics. Additionally, results from high-risk studies were interpreted cautiously and
did not substantially alter the overall thematic conclusions. This narrative triangulation
approach served as a form of implicit sensitivity analysis to enhance the robustness of
our findings.

3. Results

A systematic literature search in four electronic databases, PubMed (n = 33), Web of
Science (n = 46), Cochrane (n = 2), and Embase (n = 11), resulted in a total of 92 records.

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

At prescreening, 54 records were excluded (17 as duplicates, 20 through automated tools,
and 17 for other reasons). This resulted in 38 papers being selected for review according
to titles and abstracts. Eight of these were rejected because they were not relevant or the
methodology was not appropriate. Thirty reports were identified and retrieved, seven of
which could not be found with exhaustive searches (e.g., emailing corresponding authors,
consulting libraries, exploring open-access sources, checking institutional resources, and
using research networks). Based on the screening phase (23 articles), 6 studies were
excluded (3 combined ACT with other therapies, 2 did not report ACT as the primary
intervention, and 1 enrolled subjects without a clinical diagnosis of mental disorders). A
total of 17 studies satisfied the predefined inclusion criteria and were incorporated in the
final synthesis of this systematic review and are summarized in Table 3.

Effect Size and Certainty of
Evidence

Effect size: The sample size
calculation is based on detecting an
effect size of d = 0.55 or greater for
between-group differences in
overall mental state, with
80% power and α = 0.05. Previous
trials reported effect sizes around d
= 0.60.
Certainty of evidence: moderate.

Effect size: Both ABBT and AR led
to large reductions in interpersonal
problems (pre-post effect sizes:
ABBT d = 0.98, AR d = 0.84). There
were no significant differences
between treatment groups in
primary or secondary outcomes
(e.g., pre-treatment GAD severity
F(1,79) = 0.37, p = 0.55;
pre-treatment interpersonal
problems F(1,77) = 0.24, p = 0.62)).
Certainty of evidence: moderate.

Effect size: Within-group effect sizes
for primary and secondary
outcomes were small to moderate
(ACT d = 0.31, CBT-TAU d = 0.06).
A significantly higher proportion of
ACT participants showed reliable
improvement on the primary
outcome compared with CBT-TAU
(χ2 = 4.800, p = 0.029).
Certainty of evidence: low.

for recovery.

Effect size: Significant reductions in
number of cigarettes smoked per day
were observed, F(3, 54) = 20.12, p < 0.001,
with a 62% reduction at end of treatment
and 43% at three-month follow-up.
PTSD symptoms also significantly
decreased over time, F(3, 54) = 10.43,
p < 0.001, remaining reduced at one- and
three-month follow-up (p = 0.001).
Smoking urges related to both pleasure
and negative effect significantly decreased
from baseline to post-treatment and
follow-up (all p < 0.05).
Certainty of evidence: low.

Effect size: Significant reductions in
depression severity were observed
(mean BDI-II decreased from 30.8 to
20.0), with a time effect of b = 10.52,
p < 0.001. Patients with suicidal ideation
at baseline had a greater reduction in
depression severity after adjusting for
acceptance and mindfulness (interaction
effect b = 2.81, p = 0.001).
Certainty of evidence: moderate.

Effect size: PTSD clinician-rated
symptoms: d = 0.79; PTSD self-report
symptoms: d = 0.96 post-treatment,
d = 0.88 at follow-up; alcohol outcomes:
mean d = 0.91 (range: 0.65–1.30); quality
of life: d = 0.55–0.56; functional
disability: d = 0.35 (post), d = 0.52
(follow-up); depressive symptoms:
d = 0.50 (post), d = 0.44 (follow-up).
Certainty of evidence: low.

3.1. Assess Quality of Included Studies—Risk of Bias

The risk of bias in controlled studies was assessed using a revised Cochrane risk of
bias (RoB 2) tool [60], which comprises the following five domains: (i) bias arising from the
randomization process; (ii) bias due to deviations from the intended intervention; (iii) bias
due to missing outcome data; (iv) bias in the measurement of the outcome; and (v) bias in
the selection of the reported result (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Risk of bias (RoB) in included RCT studies [43–45,47,49–51,53–57].

The risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool [61]
comprises the following seven domains: (i) bias due to confounding; (ii) bias in selection
of participants into the study; (iii) bias in classification of interventions; (iv) bias due to
deviations from intended interventions; (v) bias due to missing outcome data; (vi) bias in
measurement of the outcome; and (vii) bias in the selection of the reported results (Figure 3).

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

Further, the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of exposures (ROBINS-E) tool [62]
comprises the following seven domains: (i) bias due to confounding; (ii) bias arising from
measurement of the exposure; (iii) bias in selection of participants into the study (or into
the analysis); (iv) bias due to post- exposure interventions; (v) bias due to missing data;
(vi) bias arising from measurement of the outcome; and (vii) bias in the selection of the
reported result (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Cochrane risk of bias in non-randomized studies of exposures (ROBINS-E) [58].

We identified only 4 studies with a low risk of bias, 11 with a moderate risk of bias,
and 2 with a critical/high risk of bias and weak methodologies. Studies at low risk of
bias were randomized control trials [43,50,53,56] that resulted in robust results due to the
clear randomization process. The control of deviations from the intended intervention
had an impact on studies analyzed due to the effectiveness and safety of the planned
intervention and ensuring the internal validity of the studies. Strict adherence to the
protocol enhanced motivation, understanding, and access to intervention to ensure the
compliance of participants. Finally, analyses included all participants in the study, as
originally assigned. Moderate risk of bias studies [44,46,47,49,51,52,54,55,57–59] were
randomized control trials and non-randomized control trial studies. The common sources
of bias identified among the 11 studies with a moderate risk were confounding factors.
Most studies had limits due to insufficient strategies for controlling confounding factors,
which could have influenced the outcomes. Some studies [44,49,51,54] presented their
data in different ways, which raised concerns about transparency or completeness, and
others used analytical methods that might introduce bias. Variability in data collection
methods, such as inconsistent measurement tools, introduced bias. Even if these studies
provide useful insights, their findings should be interpreted with caution, particularly
where limitations about bias might influence the results, e.g., two critical/high-risk bias
studies. The first was a non-randomized study of interventions [48] and the other was a
randomized control study [45]. In Chakhssi’s study [45], the lack of random allocation
of participants to groups provided a significant risk of bias. Without randomization, the
groups being compared were not equivalent. This imbalance could influence the outcomes
and lead to confounding; the effects observed may be due to casual differences rather
than the intervention or exposure of interest. Moreover, missing outcome data can lead
to biased estimates of the effect. In non-randomized studies, missing data could arise
from loss to follow-up, non-response, or incomplete records. The extent and reasons for
missing data should be carefully assessed, and appropriate methods such as multiple
imputation or sensitivity analyses should be employed to address this bias. The study
should also report the proportion of missing data and consider how its absence may impact
the study’s conclusions [45]. Finally, Meyer’s study [48] presents a risk of bias in the
selection of reported outcomes based on their statistical significance or the direction of
results rather than a pre-specified analysis plan. This could be particularly problematic
in non-randomized studies if the analysis plan is not registered or if selective reporting
occurs, where only favorable results are reported. To minimize this risk, it is critical to
predefine the outcomes and analysis methods in a protocol and to transparently report

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

16 of 24

all results, including those that are non-significant or adverse. The consistency between
the planned and reported outcomes should be documented [48]. These results are highly
susceptible to bias, which significantly limits their credibility and the extent to which
their findings can inform conclusions. While in Meyer’s study [48], there was no clear
randomization process, the randomization process minimized selection bias. Even if this
process is performed correctly, the risk of bias can still arise if the process is not adequately
blinded or if the allocation sequence is not random. In the study, outcome data was missing,
and the data analysis was not complete. This led to biased estimates of the treatment effect.
It is important to assess the extent of missing data, the reasons for it, and the methods used
to handle it in the analysis to determine the potential impact on the study’s findings.

3.2. Efficacy of ACT in Improving Social Support

Low social support is a critical determinant of both physical and mental health out-
comes. Research consistently shows that individuals with low social support face higher
risks of mortality, depression, and suicidal ideation, as well as poorer physical health due
to the neglect of health-related behaviors like diet, exercise, and adherence to medical
advice. By enhancing social connections, ACT demonstrates significant potential in ad-
dressing these challenges and improving overall well-being. Studies have shown that
ACT interventions are effective in increasing social support across various populations.
For example, in veterans with PTSD, ACT improved feelings of connection and reduced
depression and suicidal ideation, helping individuals reconnect with strained social net-
works [47,54]. Similarly, ACT reduced self-stigma and increased psychological flexibility
in individuals with chronic psychosis, leading to better social functioning and stronger
support systems [58]. These findings highlight how ACT addresses psychological barriers
to social engagement, allowing individuals to rebuild meaningful relationships. In patients
with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), ACT has been shown to improve interpersonal
relationships through enhanced mindfulness and reduced interpersonal difficulties. Par-
ticipants in an ACT-based therapy reported improved social ties, stemming from their
increased ability to manage anxiety and engage more actively in social relationships [44].
Similarly, ACT-based interventions for psychosis and trauma demonstrated improved
emotion regulation, enabling participants to sustain and enhance their social connections.
This suggests that ACT helps individuals better manage emotional challenges, thereby
fostering more robust social support systems [49]. The neural mechanisms underlying
ACT’s impact on social functioning have also been explored. A study on individuals with
social anxiety disorder (SAD) found that changes in brain connectivity, particularly in
response to affect labeling, correlated with improved social support outcomes. Participants
who developed better emotional regulation skills were able to form more meaningful and
supportive relationships, suggesting that ACT promotes social functioning by enhancing
both emotional and neural flexibility [51]. 20 By reducing avoidance, fostering acceptance,
and promoting mindfulness, ACT equips individuals to navigate their social worlds with
greater empathy and attentiveness. This leads to stronger social bonds, improved emotional
resilience, and better psychological well-being, making ACT a valuable intervention for
enhancing social support across diverse mental health populations.

3.3. The Role of ACT in Improving Psychiatric Symptoms

ACT has shown significant potential in reducing psychiatric symptoms across a wide
range of mental health disorders. This therapeutic approach builds psychological flexibility,
allowing individuals to accept their thoughts and emotions without judgment and engage in
value-driven actions. Studies demonstrate that ACT not only reduces the severity of symptoms

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

17 of 24

such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis but also enhances patients’ ability to manage their
mental health effectively, promoting better overall well-being [43–48,50–54,56–59,63].

3.4. Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD

ACT is recognized for its efficacy in treating anxiety and depressive disorders by
addressing maladaptive patterns such as avoidance and rumination. For depression, ACT
fosters acceptance and values-based engagement, helping individuals regain motivation
and purpose. Similarly, for anxiety disorders and PTSD, ACT reduces distress by promoting
psychological flexibility, allowing individuals to confront trauma related thoughts and
emotions without avoidance. For example, a randomized study on veterans with PTSD
and alcohol use disorder demonstrated that ACT significantly reduced symptoms in both
areas, promoting healthier coping strategies [48]. Additionally, ACT’s utility in veterans
with PTSD extends to smoking cessation, with participants reporting reduced PTSD-related
symptoms and improved control over intrusive thoughts [46].

3.5. Psychotic Symptoms

ACT has been extensively studied in the context of psychosis. In inpatient settings,
it has been shown to reduce the distress associated with psychotic symptoms such as
delusions and hallucinations. A randomized trial found that ACT enabled participants to
develop a new relationship with their symptoms, reducing interference with daily life and
promoting psychological flexibility [56]. Similarly, Thomas et al. [43] demonstrated that
ACT improved general functioning and reduced distress from psychotic symptoms. These
findings suggest that ACT is an effective intervention for managing severe psychiatric
symptoms, particularly when integrated into recovery-oriented group interventions [59].

3.5.1. Complex and Early Psychosis

ACT has also shown promise in addressing early psychosis and complex cases. A
qualitative study of individuals at risk of developing psychosis highlighted significant
improvements in managing distressing thoughts and hallucinations, with ACT fostering
acceptance and reducing symptom severity [58]. Additionally, a randomized trial inves-
tigating ACT for early psychosis in daily life found that it effectively reduced symptom
intensity and frequency, improving quality of life [53]. The potential of ACT in early in-
tervention is further supported by its flexibility in remote formats, as demonstrated by
an online ACT program that reduced hallucinations and delusions while enhancing daily
functioning [57].

3.5.2. Resistant and Comorbid Conditions

In cases of treatment-resistant conditions, such as personality disorders or co-occurring
mental health challenges, ACT has proven efficacious. A study on patients with personality
disorders reported significant reductions in symptoms of emotional instability, anxiety,
and depression, with ACT enabling better acceptance of negative emotions and improved
overall functioning [45]. Similarly, ACT has been shown to effectively address symptoms
in individuals with co-occurring PTSD and trauma, improving emotional regulation and
reducing symptom severity, even in those with severe trauma histories [50]. In summary,
ACT’s focus on psychological flexibility and acceptance proves highly effective in ad-
dressing diverse psychiatric symptoms. By equipping individuals with tools to manage
distress and engage in meaningful actions, ACT facilitates symptom reduction and fosters
long-term resilience, even in complex or treatment-resistant cases.

4. Discussion

Some studies showed that ACT was used for reducing some psychiatric symp-
toms as well as delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and psychological inflexi-
bility, while simultaneously enhancing psychological flexibility, emotional regulation, and
mindfulness [54,64,65]. However, these findings are not actually consistent to define the
treatment effective due to limitations of diagnosis heterogeneity, small sample sizes, high
risk of bias, and absence of control group treated by another therapy in comparison to define
a greater efficacy. These findings have important clinical implications. Improvements in
social functioning are not merely ancillary benefits but core outcomes that can significantly
enhance the prognosis of psychiatric conditions. Enhanced social connectedness has been
linked to reduced symptom severity, increased treatment adherence, and improved overall
quality of life. By fostering psychological flexibility and reconnecting individuals with
their social environments, ACT contributes to a more comprehensive recovery model that
prioritizes not only symptom relief but also social reintegration and functional autonomy.
This underscores the value of integrating ACT into routine clinical practice for individuals
facing social withdrawal or interpersonal dysfunction across diagnostic categories. ACT’s
role in enhancing social support is particularly noteworthy. Notably, enhanced social
functioning is associated with a wide range of clinical benefits, including reduced symptom
burden, improved quality of life, lower relapse rates, and stronger therapeutic engagement.
It reconnects individuals with their social networks and strengthens their capacity for
meaningful relationships by fostering mindfulness and emotional regulation. For instance,
Xu et al. [64] demonstrated that mindfulness, a core component of ACT, enhanced social
functioning and emotional resilience in adolescents with depression and trauma, while
Wharton et al. [66] observed improvements in psychological functioning and emotional
regulation following ACT interventions. Compared with traditional cognitive behavioral
therapy, ACT exhibits unique advantages. While a meta-analysis found no significant
differences in individual treatment outcomes, group-based ACT demonstrated superior
success rates and lower dropout rates, particularly in the treatment of somatic and psychic
conditions [67]. However, ACT’s mindfulness-based strategies may present challenges for
individuals who struggle with abstract concepts or find difficulty engaging in metaphors,
a limitation that CBT may address more effectively in certain cases [68,69]. Despite the
promising findings, several gaps in the literature merit discussion. Many studies rely on
small sample sizes or single-site interventions, which limit the generalizability of their
findings. For example, while Kelly et al. [54] and Khoramnia et al. [65] demonstrate ACT’s
efficacy in enhancing social functioning and emotional regulation, these studies focus on
specific populations, such as veterans or individuals with social anxiety, and may not
fully capture the therapy’s broader applicability across diverse cultural and socioeconomic
contexts. Furthermore, reliance on self-reported outcomes in many studies introduces
potential bias, underscoring the need for objective measures and multi-method approaches
in future research [66]. The long-term durability of ACT’s benefits also requires further
exploration. While Xu et al. [64] and Ferreira et al. [67] report sustained improvements
in social functioning and symptom reduction, longitudinal studies with extended follow-
up periods are necessary to confirm these outcomes and identify factors that influence
treatment retention and effectiveness over time. Additionally, while ACT has been shown
to be effective for a range of conditions (including psychosis, autism, and substance use
disorders) it is unclear whether its efficacy varies significantly across different psychiatric
profiles or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, such as trauma-focused CBT
or medication [70,71]. Expanding studies to include diverse cultural and socioeconomic
populations would improve the generalizability of findings and identify any cultural
adaptations needed for ACT’s efficacy. Additional research into the neural and cognitive

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

19 of 24

mechanisms underlying ACT’s effects would provide a deeper understanding of how it
promotes psychological flexibility and reduces psychiatric symptoms [64,69]. Beyond the
clinical insights, it is essential to reflect on the methodological rigor and limitations of the
current evidence base, which may influence the interpretation and generalizability of our
findings. The overall quality of the included studies varied, with only a limited number
rated as low risk of bias. These higher quality studies contributed more robust evidence,
whereas those with moderate or high risk presented limitations such as inadequate ran-
domization, confounding, and missing outcome data. Although studies were coded by
methodological quality, no formal subgroup or sensitivity analyses were conducted to test
whether study quality affected outcome patterns—this represents a key area for future
reviews. Moreover, the review was limited to English-language peer-reviewed articles,
potentially introducing language and publication bias. The lack of formal PRESS peer
review of the search strategy also represents a methodological constraint. While internal
peer checking was conducted, future systematic reviews would benefit from externally
validated search protocols. Lastly, although the synthesis was guided by the thematic
clustering of ACT mechanisms across studies, further work is needed to expand the gran-
ularity of synthesis and strengthen causal inferences. An important consideration when
interpreting the results is the variability across study populations and intervention char-
acteristics. Included studies differed in diagnostic categories, age groups, clinical settings
(e.g., inpatient, outpatient, community-based), and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, the
implementation of ACT varied in terms of delivery format (group vs. individual), session
duration and frequency, and therapist training or fidelity monitoring. These differences
may have contributed to heterogeneity in treatment outcomes and limit the extent to which
findings can be generalized across contexts. Future research should aim to systematically
compare these variations and explore their moderating effects to identify for whom and
under what conditions ACT is most effective. Finally, it is important to note how study
quality may have influenced the observed findings. In our synthesis, studies rated as
low risk of bias more consistently reported improvements in both social functioning and
psychological outcomes, while studies with higher risk presented more variable or limited
effects. Although we did not conduct a formal stratified analysis, this pattern suggests that
methodological rigor plays a key role in determining the strength of reported ACT effects.

4.1. Limitations

Moreover, several limitations may have affected the robustness of this review. First, by
including only English-language peer-reviewed publications, there is a potential for both
language and publication bias, as studies with non-significant or null results are less likely
to be published or indexed. Second, although internal quality control of the search strategy
was performed, the lack of external validation (e.g., PRESS review) may have introduced
search bias or missed relevant records. Third, the use of narrative synthesis, while appro-
priate given the heterogeneity of included studies, inherently limits the ability to draw
causal inferences or conduct statistical comparisons. Future reviews might benefit from
integrating meta-analytic components where feasible and adopting formal frameworks
(e.g., GRADE) to assess confidence in evidence across themes.

Also severe methodological and conceptual limitations were found. One of the pri-
mary limitations pertains to the highly heterogeneous nature of the studies, including
diagnosis, impact, and outcome. As the present review only contains one or two stud-
ies for each diagnostic category, it does not function as the synthesis of a broad body of
the literature on one disorder or treatment; rather, it represents the collection of a rela-
tively small number of isolated studies on various psychiatric illnesses. Therefore, such
wide variability of conditions limits the credibility of the cross-study comparisons and

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1587

20 of 24

significantly undermines the capacity for generalized conclusions about the efficacy of
ACT for a particular psychiatric population. In addition, most of the included studies
are underpowered due to the small sample size and lack of randomization and have a
high or moderate risk of bias when assessed through established tools. More specifically,
common methodological pitfalls of the identified studies relate to the non-randomized and
biased conditions, confounding, lack of blinding, and the use of subjective or self-reported
outcomes. The critical aspect of these limitations is the absence or inadequate control group
in most of the studies included. It means that any level of inference about the causality
of the observed association is precluded upon these studies, as the real efficacy of the
ACT cannot be adequately assessed. Therefore, the high risk of observation bias does not
discredit the reliability of the results but instead emphasizes the inability to interpret them
as causal evidence. For most studies, there is an inadequate number of blinding approaches
and no reporting of objective outcomes, or the outcomes are measured with established
scales or tests, and as such, their findings on social and psychiatric impacts lose credibility.
Moreover, such limitations as high attrition rates in several primary studies undermine
the robustness of the legitimacy of such claims. These limitations, in combination with
the lack of longitudinal data and limited representation of diverse or underrepresented
populations, significantly weaken the capacity of this systematic review to provide strong
actionable insights into the efficacy of ACT for improving social functioning in adults with
psychiatric disorders. Moreover, substantial variability in the tools used to assess social
functioning across studies may have affected the comparability and robustness of findings.
Therefore, this review should not be approached as the statement of the definitive
effect of ACT but rather as the broad and comprehensive mapping of the highly diverse
inconsistent literature. For the field of future research, the identified limitations strongly
suggest the need for larger control-group-based studies that will encompass homogeneous
sets of diagnoses and measure outcomes objectively, using established scales. Acknowledg-
ing these limitations is crucial for interpreting the present findings and for guiding future
research efforts toward more methodologically robust and inclusive investigations.

4.2. Strengths

Despite these limitations, the review offers valuable contributions to the literature.
A key strength lies in its specific emphasis on social functioning outcomes, an area often
overlooked in psychiatric research. By integrating both symptom reduction and func-
tional improvement, this review highlights the clinical relevance of ACT’s dual benefits,
supporting a more holistic model of recovery. Furthermore, the systematic approach
adopted—including a comprehensive search strategy and the application of validated risk
of bias assessment tools—enhances the methodological transparency and reliability of the
synthesis. While the findings must be interpreted with caution, they offer a critical mapping
of the current evidence base and outline key priorities for future more methodologically
rigorous investigations.

5. Conclusions and Future Directions

To conclude, this systematic review has documented and quantified considerable limi-
tations across the existing body of evidence. No firm conclusion can be drawn regarding
the efficacy of ACT on social functioning in psychiatric patients because of diagnosis het-
erogeneity, small sample sizes, and a high risk of bias. The poor operationalization lacking
robust control groups, the primary focus on self-reported outcomes, and the generally poor
methodological quality introduce an excessive risk of bias. In other words, our findings are
preliminary and descriptive, and their purpose is to illustrate the current state of evidence,
which is fragmented and marked with low quality, rather than provide evidence for or

against the use of ACT in this context. Larger, more representative, randomized, and
blinded trials that focus on more homogeneous diagnostic groups with objective outcomes
are needed. Without more robust research characterized by higher methodological rigor
and more homogenous study samples, the true efficacy and specific clinical utility of ACT
in the psychiatric patient population will remain unknown.
