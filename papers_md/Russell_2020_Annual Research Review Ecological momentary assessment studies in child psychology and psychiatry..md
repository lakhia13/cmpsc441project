Abstract

Background: Enhancements in mobile phone technology allow the study of children and 
adolescents’ everyday lives like never before. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) uses these 
advancements to allow in-depth measurements of links between context, behavior, and physiology 
in youths’ everyday lives.

Findings: A large and diverse literature now exists on using EMA to study mental and 
behavioral health among youth. Modern EMA methods are built on a rich tradition of idiographic 
inquiry focused on the intensive study of individuals. Studies of child and adolescent mental 
and behavioral health have used EMA to characterize lived experience, document naturalistic 
within-person processes and individual differences in these processes, measure familiar constructs 
in novel ways, and examine temporal order and dynamics in youths’ everyday lives.

Conclusions: EMA is feasible and reliable for studying the daily lives of youth. EMA can 
inform the development and augmentation of traditional and momentary intervention. Continued 
research and technological development in mobile intervention design and implementation, EMA­
sensor integration, and complex real-time data analysis are needed to realize the potential of 
just-in-time adaptive intervention, which may allow researchers to reach high-risk youth with 
intervention content when and where it is needed most.

Introduction

Children’s lives are a collection of moments, each involving transactions between children 
and their social and physical environments. These moments are a complex blend of the 
affective, behavioral, and physiological states of everyone present, along with features and 
activities of the home, school, or neighborhood. Understanding these moments–including 
how youth respond to, elicit, and otherwise participate in them–informs our understanding of

both typical and atypical developmental trajectories underlying risk for and protection from 
mental and physical health problems, and may suggest points for intervention.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) focuses on the moments of everyday life by 
capturing brief, repeated assessments in natural environments (Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 
2008). Traditionally, EMA studies relied exclusively on self-reports, but an increasing 
number of EMA studies are marrying these self-reports with wearable sensors, such as 
actigraphy sensors for sleep and accelerometers for physical activity (Trull & Ebner-Priemer, 
2013). In EMA, assessments are “ecological” because moods, behaviors, symptoms, and 
experiences are sampled in the natural environment, offering a high degree of ecological 
validity relative to laboratory based investigations (Shiffman et al., 2008; Trull & Ebner­
Priemer, 2013). Assessments are “momentary” in EMA because individuals are sampled 
frequently and asked to report on events and experiences at the current moment or recalled 
over short time spans (e.g., the past half-hour). EMA falls under the broader umbrella 
of ambulatory assessment, a term that encompasses both self-report and sensor-based 
measurement strategies designed to obtain repeated assessments in participants’ natural 
environments (Trull & Ebner-Priemer, 2013). As many investigators use the term EMA 
interchangeably with the terms experience sampling methodology (ESM), daily diary 
studies, and electronic diary (eDiary) studies, we use EMA to refer to any study that uses 
paper-and-pencil or mobile electronic devices to collect repeated self-reports in participants’ 
natural environments, with or without wearable sensors.

How is EMA employed?

Past EMA studies have used paper-and-pencil diaries, pagers, and personal digital assistants 
(PDAs); these technologies have been largely replaced by smartphones and tablets (Trull 
& Ebner-Priemer, 2013), allowing more seamless integration of sensors, such as global 
positioning system (GPS) sensors, actigraphy monitors for sleep and physical activity, and 
electrodermal activity (EDA) for physiological arousal via skin conductance (Trull & Ebner­
Priemer, 2013). EMA studies use intensive sampling schemes generally falling into one of 
two categories (see Shiffman et al., 2008). Time-based sampling schemes issue prompts 
at fixed or variable intervals and are often device-initiated, meaning that participants do 
not initiate surveys—they respond to device-based prompts. In a fixed-interval sampling 
scheme, participants receive prompts at fixed times aligning with their schedules (e.g., 
Russell, Wang, & Odgers, 2016). In a variable-interval scheme, participants receive prompts, 
for example, approximately every 30 minutes, with exact timing of prompts generated at 
random within this interval so that specific interval times vary and elicit more spontaneous 
self-reports (e.g., Whalen, Odgers, Reed, & Henker, 2011). Event-based sampling schemes 
base assessments on events of interest, often instructing participants to initiate reports 
when the event occurs. Events include consumption of alcohol or other substances (e.g., 
Miranda et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2018), self-injurious behavior (Kranzler et al., 2018; Nock, 
Prinstein, & Sterba, 2009), or a social interaction (Koro-Ljungberg, Bussing, Williamson, 
Wilder, & Mills, 2008).

Many EMA studies have been conducted with children and adolescents, summarized in 
two recent systematic reviews (Heron, Everhart, McHale, & Smyth, 2017; Wen, Schneider,

Stone, & Spruijt-Metz, 2017). Most EMA studies with children and adolescents have ranged 
in length from 2 to 42 days, involved two to nine survey prompts daily, used digital 
technology to collect self-reports, provided monetary incentives to encourage compliance, 
and trained young participants to operate EMA devices and/or respond to EMA survey 
questions before going into the field (Heron et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2017). The use of 
EMA is supported with children and adolescents as young as 7 years of age, as youth 
of different genders, racial/ethnic groups, nationalities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and 
mental or physical health conditions all have effectively and compliantly participated in 
EMA research (Heron et al., 2017). Heron and colleagues (2017) reported average EMA 
compliance rates–the proportion of prompts to which participants responded–of 76% across 
their selected studies, which is consistent with the 80% guideline offered in EMA studies 
with adults (Stone & Shiffman, 2002). Similarly, Wen and colleagues (2017) identified an 
average compliance rate of 78.3% across 42 studies using EMA with youth, noting no 
significant differences in compliance between clinical and non-clinical samples of youth 
(76.9% versus 79.2%, respectively, p = .29), nor when using EMA with a mobile survey 
platform only (77.4%) versus a mobile survey platform plus a wearable device (73.0%, p 
= .36), nor when comparing studies 2+ weeks in duration versus 1 week or less for both 
clinical (p = .85) and non-clinical samples (p = .27).

Why use EMA?

Traditionally, EMA is discussed as offering three general methodological advantages. 
First, EMA helps to reduce recall bias compared to retrospective self-reports through 
prospective assessment of symptoms and behaviors soon after they occur, which may be 
especially important when routine or mundane experiences are being studied (Bradburn, 
Rips, & Shevell, 1987; Shiffman et al., 2008). Second, EMA offers ecological validity 
by administering assessments in everyday life, as situations, interactions, and emotions 
are experienced, which supports inquiry that is relevant to real, everyday life as opposed 
to the laboratory (Russell & Odgers, in press; Shiffman et al., 2008). Third, EMA 
enables measurement and modeling of intraindividual or within-person variability, allowing 
comparisons of a participant to oneself across repeated measures (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 
2003), which facilitate causal inference relative to between-person comparisons because 
each individual is used as his or her own “control” across time, thus holding constant all 
characteristics of the individual that are stable during the intensive measurement period (e.g., 
sex, race/ethnicity, and genotype; Allison, 2005; Rutter, 2005).

In our review of the research literature using EMA to study the everyday lives of children 
and adolescents, we present a refined list of EMA’s methodological advantages. Specifically, 
we discuss the following six specific areas in which EMA offers advantages, each falling 
roughly within one or more of the more general advantages outlined in the previous 
paragraph. First, EMA allows us to richly characterize the “lived experiences” of youth 
in their everyday lives through contextually embedded assessments of affect, perceptions, 
and events. Second, EMA can help elucidate naturalistic, within-person processes, showing 
the contingencies that describe how symptoms, moods, and behaviors correspond with the 
shifting situations and contexts of everyday life. Third, through examining within-person 
processes across multiple individuals, one can learn how these within-person processes

vary between individuals or across contexts (such as home, school, or during free time) 
through what we are calling process-by-person or process-by-context interactions. Fourth, 
EMA facilitates novel measurement strategies that go beyond a sole reliance on self-reports. 
Through repeated measurements of momentary levels and changes in affect, for example, 
nuanced constructs such as affective lability or negative affective rumination can be 
estimated without relying on young children and adolescents to provide introspection. 
Fifth, repeated measurements facilitate examination of bidirectionality in predictor-outcome 
associations. Thus, we can “unpack” contemporaneous associations between anxiety and 
sleep, for example, in order to discover which “comes first”, or whether they mutually 
predict one another in a cyclical fashion, which may have important treatment implications. 
Sixth, through dense measurement of affect and behaviors over time, EMA allows 
elucidation of temporal dynamics, permitting nuanced examination of, for example, how 
and when mood shifts might signal future substance use, and how quickly and for how long 
negative affect increases after interpersonal conflict.

In the current paper, we review the literature featuring EMA applications in child and 
adolescent psychology and psychiatry in order to more fully demonstrate these six 
methodological strengths of EMA. We begin by briefly discussing historical and theoretical 
traditions informing EMA, highlighting the research tradition emphasizing intensive study 
of individuals (but note the much more comprehensive historical review of daily life 
research offered by Wilhelm, Perrez, & Pawlik, 2012). We echo Conner, Tennen, Fleeson, 
and Barrett’s (2009) description of EMA as a “modern idiographic approach,” and we 
discuss how it may inform child and adolescent psychology and psychiatry. Next, we review 
the international body of literature reporting on the use of EMA to examine mental and 
behavioral health in the day-to-day lives of children and adolescents. Articles for the current 
review were selected from the references of previously published reviews (Baltasar-Tello, 
Miguélez-Fernández, Peñuelas-Calvo, & Carballo, 2018; Heron et al., 2017; Wen et al., 
2017) and an updated literature search (from December 2017 to January 31, 2019) using 
PubMed and Google Scholar. Our review is not exhaustive; it is a narrative review in which 
we provide examples of how EMA may enhance discovery and individualized treatment 
of mental and behavioral health problems in youth. We discuss studies that used EMA to 
study mental (e.g., depression, anxiety) or behavioral (e.g., eating, exercise, sleep, substance 
use) health in clinical or non-clinical samples of children and/or adolescents (age 7 to 25, 
following Sawyer, Azzopardi, Wickremarathne, and Patton (2018)). Articles were grouped 
into themes based on the specific methodological strength (of the six identified previously) 
they most clearly or prominently exemplified. Each theme is discussed below, supported by 
a review of articles exemplifying the theme across mental and behavioral health outcomes 
in children and adolescents. Each section finishes with a summary of how research in the 
theme enhances our understanding of the causes, consequences, and treatment potential of 
child and adolescent psychopathology. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future 
research directions, limitations of EMA with children and adolescents, and concluding 
remarks.

Brief History and Ideological Underpinnings of Idiographic Research

The philosophy behind EMA and related ambulatory assessment methods borrows from 
the idiographic versus nomothetic tradition, first delineated by Wilhelm Windelband 
(1894/1998). Idiographic refers to research seeking to understand the nuances and 
idiosyncrasies of individuals, events, or time periods; and nomothetic refers to research 
seeking to understand general laws and principles that could generalize to a population. 
Gordon Allport (1937) introduced this distinction to psychologists, suggesting that they 
adopt idiographic approaches and avoid what was later called the nomothetic or ecological 
fallacy (Conner, Barrett, Tugade, & Tennen, 2007; Robinson, 1950), committed when one 
assumes that what is true for the “hypothetical average” individual is true for everyone. 
Concurrently with Allport’s writing, diaries as research records began to emerge in clinical 
science (Shiffman et al., 2008), and the idea of research designs sampling random moments 
from individuals’ daily lives to obtain an “ecology of situations” began to emerge in 
psychology (Brunswik, 1943). Cattell and colleagues (Cattell, 1943; Cattell, Cattell, & 
Rhymer, 1947) discussed the use of “temporal sequence studies,” wherein individuals were 
“measured on a collection of tests on a series of occasions” in order to discover “relative 
unique traits” that describe regularities across time for each individual (Cattell et al., 1947; 
p., 267–268).

Thinking from these areas influenced the development of the experience sampling 
method (ESM) (Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007), which offered an early 
glimpse into modern EMA studies through work assessing adolescents’ activities, moods, 
and experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, Larson, & Prescott, 1977; Larson, 1989; Larson & 
Csikszentmihalyi, 1978; Larson, Csikszentmihalyi, & Graef, 1980). Using pagers to signal 
25 adolescents at random moments, Csikszentmihalyi and colleagues (1977) documented 
adolescents’ activities and social contexts, noting that adolescents spent most of their time 
with peers or engaging in entertainment-related activities. They noted the affective and 
behavioral correlates associated with various activities and social contexts, showing that NA 
tended to prevail during activities characterized by socialization into adult roles. Following 
this, Stone and Shiffman (1994) introduced the term ecological momentary assessment as a 
direct descendant of ESM and outlining its application to behavioral medicine and related 
disciplines.

The intensive study of individuals in EMA and other ideographic methodologies necessitates 
multiple assessments over time. Thus, a central premise underlying idiographic research is 
that within-person variability, or moment-to-moment change in affect or behavior, is partly 
“real”–that is, it is not entirely due to measurement error, as might have been assumed 
previously (Nesselroade & Ram, 2004). While some within-person variability is due to 
measurement error, some reflects true variability or change over time, including cyclical 
or oscillatory temporal processes (e.g., diurnal affective cycles) and reversible changes 
representing situation-behavior associations (Nesselroade & Ram, 2004). Supporting the 
validity of this viewpoint, methodological developments in multilevel and latent variable 
modeling demonstrate the parsing of true change from measurement error in intensive 
longitudinal data (e.g., Nezlek, 2017; Schuurman & Hamaker, 2019); and between-person 
differences in affective and behavioral reactivity, defined by within-person changes in affect

or behavior across situations, add important information for predicting clinical and public 
health outcomes in adolescents and adults (e.g., Charles, Piazza, Mogle, Sliwinski, & 
Almeida, 2013; Fuligni, Arruda, Krull, & Gonzales, 2017; C. D. Mohr et al., 2013; Odgers 
& Russell, 2017; Piazza, Charles, Sliwinski, Mogle, & Almeida, 2013; Russell, Almeida, & 
Maggs, 2017).

Mischel and colleagues (Mischel, 2004; Mischel & Shoda, 1995; Shoda, Mischel, & Wright, 
1994) offer an important example supporting momentary within-person change. This work 
presents behavioral signatures: “if-then contingencies” between situation and behavior that 
describe individuals’ behavioral tendencies toward situations in their everyday lives. This 
idea integrated insights from both “sides” of the person-situation debate, suggesting that the 
trait-like consistency seen in personality assessments may emerge from one’s characteristic 
responses to situations (Fleeson, 2004; Mischel, 2004). Shoda et al. (1994) supported 
this idea in an intensive observational study of youth ages 7–13 visiting summer camp. 
They identified aggressive behavioral signatures for each child by observing them across 
situations, which enabled them to discover the presence of stable shifts in aggressive 
behavior associated with specific situations. Not only was the profile of situationally related 
aggressive behavior shifts different for each child (e.g., when approached by a peer, some 
children showed high verbal aggression but others showed low), but behaviors in these 
situations were stable across time, suggesting that situation-behavior transactions may 
indeed function as individual characteristics or tendencies (Shoda et al., 1994).

Review of EMA studies of child and adolescent mental and behavioral 

health

In this section, we review the international body of research literature applying EMA to 
study questions relevant to child psychology and psychiatry. Studies are organized according 
to the six specific themes identified previously.

Theme 1: Approaching ecological validity: Characterizing the lived experiences of youth 
with versus without psychopathology

One consistently leveraged feature of EMA studies is their ability to measure lived 
experience by mapping psychosocial experiences, contexts, and situations as they naturally 
occur. Through repeated assessments, we can obtain a richly detailed film (versus single­
assessment snapshot) of youths’ everyday lives (Shiffman et al., 2008). This richly detailed 
film offers researchers an assessment of everyday life as experienced as opposed to 
everyday life as remembered, the latter of which we typically obtain via static retrospective 
questionnaire assessments (Russell & Odgers, 2015). The repeated, contextually embedded 
measurement of situations, moods, and behaviors minimizes retrospective recall biases that 
tend to occur when mundane or routine experiences are recalled over long periods of 
time (Bradburn et al., 1987; Shiffman et al., 2008) and allows a more accurate picture 
of what typical day-to-day experience actually “looks and feels like” for youth with 
versus without mental and behavioral health problems (Russell & Odgers, 2015). Such an 
approach enables child psychology and psychiatry researchers to discover the psychological 
and socio-contextual mechanisms that underlie routine symptom experiences in everyday

life, potentially opening new avenues to contextually sensitive and situationally embedded 
treatment solutions.

The work of Carol Whalen, Barbara Henker, and their colleagues demonstrates how EMA 
can be used to characterize the contexts, behaviors, and symptom experiences of youth 
with versus without psychopathology (Henker, Whalen, Jamner, & Delfino, 2002; Whalen 
et al., 2009; Whalen, Henker, Ishikawa, et al., 2006; Whalen, Jamner, Henker, & Delfino, 
2001). Whalen, Henker, Jamner, et al. (2006) examined the day-to-day challenges of young 
adolescents (ages 8–12) with ADHD who were receiving a stable course of stimulant 
treatment. For one week, EMA reports were obtained via PDAs from parents and children 
every 30 minutes outside of work and school hours. Results showed that many day-to-day 
challenges remained present, even when youth with ADHD were receiving a stable course 
of stimulant medication. In families of children with ADHD, parents reported higher levels 
of anger when they were with the target child than parents in families of children without 
ADHD, where the pattern was reversed: higher levels of anger were reported when parents 
of children without ADHD were not with the target child. Parents of children with ADHD 
also reported themselves as having lower parenting effectiveness and quality of life. These 
studies highlighted the interplay between individuals and their environments, outlining the 
contextual triggers of provocation between parents and children with ADHD; Whalen, 
Henker, Ishikawa, et al. (2006) noted that transitional activities (such as when parents or 
children reported “getting ready”) were particularly contentious for children with ADHD 
and their parents. Further, they documented a negative-affective climate between parents and 
youth across situations in homes of children with ADHD, showing that maternal reports 
of anger were more likely to precede, co-occur with, and follow reports of spending time 
with the child in the homes of children with ADHD (Whalen et al., 2009). These insights 
illuminated the multifaceted nature of difficulties in families of children with ADHD 
and evidence of the situations and moods that are more prevalent in ADHD households. 
Similarly, Henker et al. (2002) examined everyday experiences of adolescents with high, 
medium, and low levels of anxiety at baseline. Following baseline assessment, youth 
completed EMA every 30 minutes for two periods of four consecutive days. Youth with 
high versus low anxiety at baseline showed higher levels of anxiety and stress and higher 
levels of anger, sadness, and fatigue, providing evidence that the everyday lives of youth 
with anxiety were characterized not merely by higher levels of anxious or tense affect.

EMA has been used to understand the lives of youth with high-functioning autistic spectrum 
disorder (ASD), although application of EMA with high-functioning ASD is still in its 
nascent stages relative to other disorders (but see Chen, Cordier, & Brown, 2015; Cordier, 
Brown, Chen, Wilkes-Gillan, & Falkmer, 2016; Khor, Gray, Reid, & Melvin, 2014 for 
examples of this work). Despite the small number of studies in this area, one study by 
Cordier and colleagues (2016) provides an example of the potential in using EMA to 
examine the day-to-day social lives of youth with high-functioning ASD. Six Australian 
boys (aged 8–12) with high-functioning ASD were randomly queried 7 times daily for 7 
consecutive days and asked to respond to a series of questions on their current situation 
(where they were, what they were doing, who they were with), their emotions, and their 
perceived quality of experiences. These youth reported being in the company of others 
often (90% of sampling occasions) but reported speaking with others on only 25% of

occasions. When spending time with friends, the youth identified more positive experiences 
and emotions than when they were with other company, suggesting that time with friends is 
rewarding to these youth, despite the limited frequency with which it happens. This provided 
an important nuance in our understanding of the psychosocial experiences of youth with 
ASD, suggesting that although they do not regularly seek social company, they do find it 
rewarding.

EMA studies have also investigated adolescents’ exposure to substance use media (Collins 
et al., 2017; Martino et al., 2016; Scharf, Martino, Setodji, Staplefoote, & Shadel, 2013), 
which is important given that advertising exposures so routine as to become mundane. As 
such, these experiences may be ineffectively recalled over long periods of time, suggesting 
value of EMA. Scharf and colleagues (2013) collected data on alcohol- and tobacco-related 
exposures among 20 middle- and high-school student via EMA. Seeking to answer questions 
such as when, how often, where, and with whom adolescents were exposed to substance 
use media, the authors reported that adolescents reported exposure to alcohol-related media 
more frequently than tobacco-related media; exposures tended to occur in the afternoon, at 
point of sale, and on days leading into the weekend; and exposures tended to occur in the 
presence of family members. A larger study collected self-reports of exposure to alcohol use 
advertisements as well as appraisals of these advertisements from nearly 600 adolescents 
aged 11–14, 24% of whom had reported trying at least a sip of alcohol (Collins et al., 2017). 
Exposure to alcohol advertisements was measured using self-initiated prompts. Adolescents 
were trained to initiate one of these surveys whenever they encountered an alcohol-related 
advertisement and provide the particular medium (e.g., TV, radio) and their appraisal of the 
advertisement. When adolescents saw ads that they appraised positively, they reported more 
positive attitudes about alcohol than when asked about their alcohol attitudes at random 
moments, suggesting the influence these advertisements may have on adolescents’ drinking 
risk.

Other studies have sought to examine adolescents’ everyday experiences with digital media. 
The ubiquity of digital technology in the everyday lives of youth and concern from the 
public about its possible detrimental influence on youth development (George & Odgers, 
2015) have spawned an emerging body of research using EMA to ascertain whether 
technology use is associated with mental health problems. Given that technology and 
media use are relatively routine, researchers have begun to apply EMA to measure the 
frequency and duration of its use, its affective and social contextual correlates in day-to­
day life, and its downstream associations with mental and physical health (e.g., Bickham, 
Blood, Walls, Shrier, & Rich, 2013; Bickham, Hswen, & Rich, 2015; George, Russell, 
Piontak, & Odgers, 2018; Scherer, Bickham, Shrier, & Rich, 2015). Emerging findings from 
these studies are intriguing and warrant further investigation. For example, Bickham and 
colleagues (2015) report on a sample of 126 adolescents (ages 13–15 years) who responded 
to 24-hour retrospective time use diaries and momentary EMA surveys (randomly signaled 
throughout the day over 2 weeks) focused on the types, duration, and frequency of media 
use. Higher amounts of television watching and mobile phone use were associated with 
increased depression at a one-year follow-up, adjusting for baseline depression level. No 
evidence was found for associations between video games, computer, and music-related 
media and later depression. Some evidence suggested that parental rules about TV reduce

the risk of depression, suggesting that parental regulation over adolescent media use could 
help mitigate negative relationships.

EMA has also been used to characterize the lived experience of adolescents who drink 
at risky levels. For example, Kauer and colleagues (2009) reported on work from two 
samples in Australia: a school-based sample with 18 ninth- and eleventh-grade students 
and a clinic-based sample of eight high-risk adolescent and young adult drinkers. Using 
the mobiletype program (see Reid et al., 2009), they documented the social contexts and 
activities that tended to occur more frequently on drinking versus non-drinking days for 
school-based youth: less time studying, more time sleeping/resting, and more time “hanging 
out.” In the clinical sample, they found links between alcohol use and increased negative 
mood and more time spent with boyfriend/girlfriend on drinking days, but the authors 
encountered difficulties in assessment: morning diary entries were rarely completed, and 
when alcohol use was assessed, reports on types and amounts were less complete than 
with the school-based sample. Similar difficulties were observed in a clinical sample of 
predominantly Latinx youth (n = 28) receiving outpatient treatment for substance use 
in the US. Compliance with EMA reports was high overall (above 80%) but decreased 
across the study period and was lower on days when alcohol use was retrospectively 
reported (Comulada, Lightfoot, Swendeman, Grella, & Wu, 2015). These studies suggest 
that additional care and tailoring may be necessary before deploying EMA strategies among 
youth with clinical levels of substance abuse.

Theme 1 summary.—Through repeated, contextually embedded measurement, EMA 
allows rich characterization of the lived experiences of children and adolescents with 
versus without psychopathology. Through the minimization of retrospective recall biases 
that can accompany assessments of routine experiences over long spans of time (Bradburn 
et al., 1987; Shiffman et al., 2008), EMA offers a more direct measurement of what is 
truly “typical” for each individual youth with regard to the quality of their environments, 
symptoms, moods, and behaviors, thereby providing greater accuracy in self-reports of these 
experiences (Shiffman, 2009) and getting us one step closer to daily life as experienced 
versus daily life as remembered, compared to retrospective self-reports (Russell & Odgers, 
2015). Such an approach will not only facilitate our scientific understanding of day-to-day 
experience for youth with versus without psychopathology, but may also provide real-world 
information that can inform optimization of interventions, such as a picture of the family 
challenges that may remain after a steady course of medication treatment among youth with 
ADHD, the specific areas in which the social lives of youth with high-functioning ASD 
may benefit from behavioral intervention, and the specific social and environmental contexts 
in which adolescents may need to be protected against advertisements promoting substance 
abuse.

Theme 2: Naturalistic within-person processes: Symptoms and behaviors as they co-occur 
with situations and events in everyday life

Many of the theoretical models in research on child and adolescent psychopathology specify 
naturalistic within-person processes: the contextual and situational conditions under which 
symptoms may be elevated or decreased compared to what is typical. These models are

concerned with when symptoms or behaviors are expressed, asking questions such as, “Are 
symptoms of anxiety elevated when adolescents witness interparental conflict, compared 
to themselves when they do not?” Through EMA, these questions can be answered by 
comparing adolescents to themselves across time, to see whether change in symptoms 
or behaviors co-occur with changes in context or situation. Through these within-person 
comparisons, such an approach uses each adolescent as his or her own control across 
time, holding constant all stable person-level characteristics, measured or unmeasured. In 
so doing, researchers can not only identify the scenarios under which problematic symptom 
change is more likely, but can also take a (small) step toward causal inference regarding the 
connection between situation and behavior. Studies using EMA to examine within-person 
processes span several domains in child psychology and psychiatry. Although the studies we 
review in this section differ considerably with regard to the specific within-person processes 
they examine, they share the approach of comparing youth to themselves across time and 
situation to better understand how changes in environments correspond to changes in well­
being, and they collectively provide a diverse set of examples for how these within-person 
associations may be informative for both etiological theory and clinical practice.

A small group of EMA studies has focused on within-person processes pertaining to 
physical activity and eating behaviors among children and adolescents. These health 
behaviors are notoriously difficult to measure accurately via retrospective reports (de 
Rezende et al., 2018), making them strong candidates for EMA. An example comes from 
Toumpakari, Tilling, Haase, and Johnson (2019), who asked 884 adolescents in the UK 
(ages 11–18) to complete 4-day food diaries via EMA, logging details of their eating 
occasions and their physical and social contexts. They found that adolescents consumed 
more high-fat, high-sugar foods when they reported being in “eateries” or at school, 
compared to when they were “at home,” and more high-fat, high-sugar food with social 
company than when alone. Similarly, Grenard and colleagues (2013) examined associations 
between snacking (salty and sweet snacks, sugared beverage consumption) and naturally 
occurring physical, social, and psychological cues in an EMA study of 158 adolescents (ages 
14–17). Adolescents were more likely to engage in unhealthy snacking and/or sweetened 
beverage consumption when they felt lonely or bored, were with friends, were at school (vs 
home), were exposed to food cues, and were watching TV.

Seeking to examine the daily life processes linking social environments and eating 
pathology, Vandewalle, Mabbe, Debeuf, Braet, and Moens (2017) used EMA to measure 
emotional eating, peer rejection, and parental rejection in 55 normal-weight Belgian 
adolescents (ages 11–15). Adolescents engaged in significantly more emotional eating on 
days when they experienced parental rejection than on days they did not. Peer rejection 
also had a marginally significant influence on emotional eating. Similarly, Ranzenhofer and 
colleagues (2014) examined affective and interpersonal correlates of loss of control over 
eating in a sample of 30 adolescent girls (M age=14.9) with overweight/obesity. Momentary 
ratings of interpersonal problems (e.g., conflict, rejection), affect, and loss of control over 
eating were measured for two consecutive weeks. Interpersonal problems were associated 
with increased risk for loss of control over eating at both between- and within-person levels.

The contextual and psychosocial conditions accompanying physical activity have also been 
studied via EMA, sometimes complemented with data from wearable accelerometers. For 
example, Dunton and colleagues conducted validation studies of children’s self-reports 
of physical activity and physical activity contexts collected in their day-to-day lives 
(Dunton, Intille, Wolch, & Pentz, 2012; Dunton, Liao, Intille, Spruijt-Metz, & Pentz, 2011). 
Children’s self-reports of vegetation and traffic in their physical activity environments 
corresponded with those obtained from their parents (Dunton, Intille, et al., 2012), and 
children’s reports of physical versus sedentary activity corresponded with accelerometer 
data (Dunton, Liao, Intille, Spruijt-Metz, et al., 2011). This group then investigated 
the contexts and social company in which youth engage in more physical activity and 
associations between physical activity and mood level and variability. Evidence suggests that 
children’s physical activity occurs both outdoors and indoors; accelerometer data indicated 
that mean steps were greater when youth were outdoors than when they were indoors 
at home or at someone else’s house (Dunton, Intille, et al., 2012; Dunton, Kawabata, 
Intille, Wolch, & Pentz, 2012; Dunton, Liao, Intille, Wolch, & Pentz, 2011). Studies also 
show that neighborhood characteristics, both perceived and objective, are associated with 
youth physical activity: children engage in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (as 
measured via accelerometry) in settings perceived as having less traffic (Dunton, Intille, et 
al., 2012).

EMA methods have also been used to examine within-person processes linking psychosocial 
and contextual factors with suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) thoughts and 
behaviors among youth (Nock et al., 2009). One study examined day-to-day variation in 
suicidal ideation among 34 adolescents (76% female; ages 13–17) hospitalized due to a 
last-month suicide attempt (Czyz, Horwitz, Arango, & King, 2019). EMA was administered 
for four consecutive weeks post-discharge and revealed significant same-day relationships 
between suicidal ideation ratings and risk factors associated with suicidal ideation. EMA 
has also clarified the role of daily NA and repetitive negative thinking in predicting NSSI 
thoughts and behaviors. A community sample of 47 adolescents and young adults (ages 
15–21) monitored affective and cognitive states related to risk for NSSI thoughts/behaviors 
by using an EMA app on a smartphone for 2 weeks (Hughes et al., 2019). Participants were 
more likely to experience NSSI when reporting higher levels of distress, but only within the 
context of experiencing high repetitive negative thinking.

EMA studies have also focused on the relationships between shifts in environmental 
exposures and health behaviors. For example, in a study of 151 youth at risk for early 
substance use, researchers examined the link between witnessing violence and obesogenic 
behaviors across 30 consecutive days using mobile phone surveys (Piontak et al., 2017). 
Compared to days youth did not witness violence, on days they witnessed violence, 
youth were more likely to consume unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, report 
feeling tiredness the next morning, and, intriguingly, report physical activity. Many of these 
findings were replicated in a large sample of youth from the southeastern US (replication 
findings reported in the same study). In a sample of 139 urban, primarily African-American 
adolescents, Mennis and colleagues (2016) found that a measure of relative disadvantage 
(difference between the neighborhood disadvantage of home neighborhood vs disadvantage 
of the space in which their current EMA report was provided), was associated with more

perceived stress and less perceived safety (measured via EMA), and average relative 
disadvantage was associated with more substance use involvement (reported at baseline). 
Momentary changes in relative disadvantage were strongly associated with momentary 
perceived stress among adolescents with more baseline substance use, which may reflect 
the reasons for which such adolescents travel to risky neighborhoods (i.e., to acquire 
substances).

Intriguingly, studies examining both within- and between-person relationships sometimes 
find vastly different results across levels of analysis: different results are sometimes found 
when we compare youth to each other (between-person) versus themselves across time 
(within-person), providing incentive to guard against the ecological fallacy. Goldschmidt 
and colleagues (2018) provide an example. They examined the correlates of overeating 
and loss of control over eating in 40 adolescents aged 8–14 with overweight/obesity in 
a two-week EMA. Goldschmidt and colleagues (2018) found that when adolescents were 
compared to themselves across time (within-person), they perceived greater loss of control 
over eating on occasions with more palatable compared to themselves on occasions with less 
palatable food. However, when adolescents were compared to each other (between-person), 
adolescents who tended to perceive food as less palatable showed higher loss of control over 
eating, on average, showing an opposite relationship to that observed at the within-person 
level.

Theme 2 summary.—Many hypotheses in child psychology and psychiatry refer to 
naturalistic within-person processes but fail to test them with designs that can measure them. 
EMA provides a way to directly test for processes linking contexts, situations, symptoms, 
and behaviors in everyday life, using each child as his or her own control across time, 
providing a powerful blend of external and internal validity. Evidence of within-person 
processes has been seen with regard to eating behaviors, physical activity, self-injury, stress, 
and substance use, with evidence in some cases showing that the within-person processes do 
not mirror between-person processes.

Theme 3: Process-by-person and process-by-context interactions

Another exciting feature of EMA studies is their ability to examine how within-person 
processes vary between individuals. This allows us to examine not only within-person 
processes, but also the between-person differences in these within-person processes (e.g., 
why an association is different for some youth). Between-person differences in these 
within-person processes can then be explained by several individual, familial, and contextual 
factors. These process-by-person or process-by-context interactions are central to many 
theoretical perspectives (Belsky & Pluess, 2009; Del Giudice, Ellis, & Shirtcliff, 2011; Ellis, 
Boyce, Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van Ijzendoorn, 2011; Moffitt, Caspi, & Rutter, 
2006; Monroe & Simons, 1991) and are tested in response to some of the most exciting and 
theoretically nuanced hypotheses about etiology and treatment of psychopathology. Testing 
these process-by-person/context interactions is possible using EMA and multilevel modeling 
(MLM).

In a study of 151 adolescents at risk for early substance use in the southwestern US, 
Russell and colleagues (2016) examined the whether adolescents showed higher odds of 
antisocial behavior on days they witnessed others using alcohol and drugs versus themselves 
on days they did not witness others’ substance use. They used MLM with random slopes 
to test this within-person association, while allowing the model to capture heterogeneity in 
the direction and strength of this relationship between adolescents. There was an average 
positive association, such that adolescents were more likely to engage in antisocial behavior 
on days they witnessed others’ substance use, compared to themselves on non-witnessing 
days. However, a significant random slope indicated that the relationship was stronger 
for some adolescents than others, and a genetic marker (DRD4-7R) was introduced as a 
between-person predictor of the random slope, to test a gene x environment interaction. 
Adolescents with the 7R allele showed significantly stronger increases in antisocial behavior 
odds across witnessing versus non-witnessing days than adolescents without the 7R allele, 
providing evidence of a gene-environment interaction.

In the same sample, Odgers and Russell (2017) examined links between witnessing violence 
in day-to-day life and experience of mental health problems across 30 consecutive days. 
Again, using MLM with random slopes, they found that on days adolescents witnessed 
violence, youth had greater odds of experiencing anger, depressive symptoms, irritability, 
conduct problems, and other health-risk behavior, compared to themselves on days they did 
not witness violence. Significant carryover effects were observed: witnessing violence was 
associated with increased depression and irritability the following day. A person-by-process 
interaction was also observed, as adolescents who experienced the highest levels of violence 
exposure showed lower levels of reactivity to violence at the within-person level, providing 
naturalistic evidence consistent with a violence exposure desensitization process observed in 
laboratory-based research with youth (Ouellet-Morin et al., 2011).

Allen and colleagues (2016) present a process-by-context interaction in the interaction 
between parental and child factors in shaping everyday emotional experiences among 
106 children with anxiety disorder (ages 9–14). They examined the intersection of 
parental autonomy granting–tendency toward validation of the child’s perspective and 
encouragement of independent problem solving–and children’s perceived control over 
events, via EMA. Child emotional reactivity to negative events and use of emotion 
regulation strategies in daily life were also assessed; these measures represented within­
person processes linking negative events and emotional experiences. Children with higher 
perceived control reported less nervousness in response to negative events and used more 
cognitive restructuring and problem solving strategies to regulate negative emotion. Results 
showed an interaction between autonomy granting and perceived control: higher autonomy 
granting was related to more somatic symptoms during negative events and lower likelihood 
of using acceptance for emotion regulation, but only among youth who had low perceived 
control. These findings show how within-person associations may vary as a complex 
interaction of individual- and family-level characteristics, and may help point the way 
toward effective individualization of treatment strategies.

Returning to physical activity processes, EMA studies have shown evidence that within­
person processes linking children’s perceptions and their physical activity depend on

individual, social, and neighborhood characteristics. For example, Salvy, Feda, Epstein, and 
Roemmich (2017) collected reports of sedentary activities, screen time, and social context 
using wearable accelerometers to collect physical activity data in the natural environment. 
Findings suggested a buffering influence of peers against contextual risk on physical 
activity: youth who reported fewer peer interactions showed less physical activity if they 
perceived their neighborhoods as less safe; this was not seen among youth who reported 
more peer interactions.

Theme 3 summary.—By measuring youth intensively across time, EMA facilitatse the 
discovery of process-by-person interactions: between-person differences in within-person 
processes that link situations with symptoms and behaviors in everyday life. In this way, 
we can answer questions such as, “Which youth appear most resilient to affective distress 
when exposed to violence?” or “In which contexts do youth show the greatest behavioral 
reactivity to risky situations?” Such questions have a rich theoretical tradition in personality 
and psychopathology (Belsky & Pluess, 2009; Del Giudice et al., 2011; Ellis et al., 2011; 
Mischel, 2004; Moffitt et al., 2006; Monroe & Simons, 1991), and answering them may 
inform tailored intervention strategies for individual youth.

Theme 4: Novel measurement strategies: Moving beyond a sole reliance on participants’ 
perceptions

Psychosocial constructs are typically measured and represented with self-report scales. 
These standard composites rely on participants’ self-awareness about the construct. 
Although standard composites such as these are used nearly as ubiquitously in EMA as they 
are in other observational studies, repeated, contextually embedded measurements of these 
composites allow researchers to create novel and interesting operationalizations without 
entirely relying on participants’ own self-knowledge. This represents a powerful way to 
capture complex constructs that participants, especially children and adolescents, may have 
difficulty introspecting and reporting on.

The construct of affective lability provides a key example. Broadly, affective lability refers 
to the extent to which a person’s mood levels, positively or negatively valenced, tend to shift 
away from what is typical for them (their intraindividual mean) or from their immediately 
previous value (Ram & Gerstorf, 2009). As such, affective lability is distinct from one’s 
affective intensity, or the level of positive or negative affect being experienced. Using 
repeated EMA, affective lability can be calculated from data, circumventing the need to 
ask youth to introspect about how often and how intensively their mood fluctuates. For 
example, in a study of 79 youth ages 7–17 years with and without MDD, Silk and colleagues 
(2011) operationalized two dimensions of affective experience using EMA data: affective 
intensity, or mean level of PA and NA experienced for each adolescent, and affective 
lability, the standard deviation of PA and NA for each adolescent across EMA reports (i.e., 
intraindividual standard deviation). Youth with MDD showed greater intensity and lability of 
NA than those without. Concerning specific affects, youth with MDD showed more intense 
and labile sadness, anger, and nervousness, suggesting potential deficits in ability to regulate 
and/or recover from these emotions versus youth without psychopathology.

Other studies have used model-based approaches to estimate affective intensity, lability, and 
their associations with outcomes. For example, in a study of 119 children ages 9–13 years 
who completed 8 days of 7-times daily EMA monitoring, Dunton and colleagues (2014) 
used mixed-effects location-scale modeling to examine associations between moderate­
to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; measured via wrist-worn actigraphy sensors) and 
affective intensity and lability. Mixed-effects location-scale modeling extends MLM to allow 
simultaneous multivariable modeling of the overall level, between-person heterogeneity, and 
within-person variability in time-varying outcomes such as affect (Hedeker, Mermelstein, 
& Demirtas, 2008). Using this technique to analyze temporally dense EMA, Dunton and 
colleagues (2014) went beyond reporting an association between MVPA and mood, adding 
that physical activity may stabilize mood, as youth with higher physical activity showed 
lower variability in PA and NA. Schmeer and colleagues (2019) used mixed-effects location­
scale modeling of level and variability parameters to study associations between sleep 
and family context. They combined survey and EMA data from 1,095 eleven-to-seventeen­
year-olds to test the hypothesis that adolescents living in a disadvantaged family context 
experienced lower average levels and less consistent sleep duration than non-disadvantaged 
peers. Adolescents who lived in unmarried-parent, low-SES, economically insecure, and 
high-caregiver-stress families showed greater sleep duration variability across days than 
adolescents from more economically secure and lower-stress families. Fewer associations 
were seen between family context and adolescents’ average level of sleep duration, meaning 
that the association between family context and sleep might have been missed if only 
traditional measures of sleep duration were used.

Waller and colleagues (2014) present another novel measurement example. Their EMA 
contained a sequence of questions to capture the complex construct of co-rumination—
a pattern of behavior characterized by “extensively discussing and revisiting problems, 
speculating about problems, and focusing on negative feelings” (Rose, 2002, p. 1830). 
Co-rumination was considered to be observed if affirmative responses to four questions were 
seen (Waller et al., 2014, p. 873–874): “Did a negative event with at least ‘a little’ distress 
occur in the past hour?” (if yes, then) “Were you with a social companion while reacting to 
the negative event?” (if yes, then) “Did you talk about the negative event with your social 
companion?” (if yes, then) “Were you unable to stop thinking about how you were feeling?” 
Using this branching sequence, the researchers found that adolescents (ages 11–17) with 
MDD engaged in co-rumination with peers roughly 3 times as often, and co-rumination with 
parents roughly 2 times as often, as youth without diagnoses.

Other studies examining risk processes for adolescent substance use in everyday life have 
used smartphones to pair GPS technology with EMA self-reports to draw inferences about 
the social, contextual, and temporal nuances of adolescent problem behavior. For example, 
EMA via smartphone surveys plus geospatial technology (e.g., GPS and geographic 
information systems) have spawned a subtechnique called geographic EMA (GEMA; 
Epstein et al., 2014; Kirchner & Shiffman, 2016), which shows high spatial accuracy 
and little evidence that adolescent characteristics or neighborhood features are associated 
with inaccuracy in geographic readings (Mennis, Mason, Ambrus, Way, & Henry, 2017). 
Using GEMA, Byrnes and colleagues (2017) examined links between spatial context and 
adolescents’ problem behavior among 170 youth ages 14–16 who completed EMAs on

weekends for a month on GPS-enabled smartphones. GPS-measured density of alcohol 
outlets was associated with adolescents’ alcohol use measured via EMA, but adolescents’ 
EMA reports of whether they could observe an alcohol outlet at the current moment were 
not. These findings suggest that sensor-based measures of physical context may complement 
self-reports and may enable researchers to detect relationships that cannot be measured 
through self-reports alone.

Theme 4 summary.—Through creative summaries of repeated assessments, advanced 
statistical modeling, and technological developments, EMA studies provide novel 
measurement capabilities that do rely exclusively reliance on youths’ self-awareness of 
their internal states. The studies discussed in this section are examples of ways in which 
constructs that may be difficult to measure via self-reports alone influence the development 
and expression of mental and behavioral health problems in youth.

Theme 5: The chicken, the egg, or both? Examination of bidirectional relationships

The repeated measurement of EMA studies allows examination of direction in situation­
symptom and situation-behavior processes. Often embedded in implicit causal models is 
a sense of whether the relationship is unidirectional or bidirectional. EMA studies allow 
examination of bidirectionality, as the timing and temporal precedence of a hypothesized 
predictor-to-outcome relationship can be revealed.

For some processes of interest, relationships may be inherently bidirectional, with the 
predictor spurring changes in the outcome and the outcome spurring changes in the 
predictor. For example, Dunton and colleagues (2014) reported on the bidirectional 
associations between physical activity, affective dynamics, and physical states. A sample 
of 120 youth aged 9–13 at risk for overweight or obesity completed self-report smartphone 
surveys 3–7 times daily, across two four-day spans 6 months apart and wore an actigraph 
while awake. Feeling more energetic and less tired was associated with increased moderate­
to-vigorous physical activity in the 30 minutes following an EMA report, and higher 
physical activity in the 30 minutes before an EMA report was associated with increased 
levels of PA, higher energy levels, and lower levels of NA. These findings suggested a 
positive feedback loop connecting momentary well-being and physical activity in youths’ 
day-to-day lives.

Associations between sleep and affect are also likely to be driven by underlying bidirectional 
processes, whereby poor sleep may lead to increased NA, and increased NA may lead to 
poor sleep. Cousins and colleagues (2011) examined the bidirectional processes linking 
daytime affect and nighttime sleep among youth ages 8–16, hypothesizing that the strength 
of these relationships might vary between youth with primary MDD (n=42), youth with 
anxiety disorder only (n=23), and youth with no psychiatric diagnosis (n=29). They provide 
evidence for affect as a mechanism linking mood disorder and sleep disturbances. EMA­
measured affect multiple times daily across two 4-day bursts, and wrist-worn actigraphy 
provided an estimate of the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle for five consecutive days. In youth 
with MDD, affect predicted sleep –greater daytime NA was associated with less time awake 
that night; more daytime PA and higher PA/NA ratios were associated with less time in bed

and less total sleep that night. However, affective dimensions did not predict sleep metrics 
for youth with anxiety disorder only, nor for youth without a psychiatric diagnosis, and 
higher NA during the day was associated with less time awake the following night for youth 
with MDD, and more time spent for youth with anxiety disorder. Relationships in which 
sleep predicted affect also differed by diagnostic groups. For example, longer sleep latency 
(longer time between going to bed and falling asleep) was associated with less PA and more 
NA the following day only for youth with MDD.

Sleep has also been tested for bidirectional relationships with cognitive performance and 
psychopathology symptoms. In a sample of 110 German children (ages 8–11), Könen, 
Dirk, and Schmiedek (2015) examined the link between self-reported sleep behavior and 
cognitive performance operationalized using a smartphone-based working memory task. 
Higher sleep quality the night before was associated with better working memory in the 
morning, with time in bed showing an inverted U-shaped relationship with working memory 
performance; performance decrements were seen on nights when adolescents slept less or 
more than their typical amount. Könen, Dirk, Leonhardt, and Schmiedek (2016) found that 
higher levels of EMA-measured sleep quality were associated with higher PA the next day, 
and a bidirectional cycle between affect and sleep was found, such that higher PA in the 
evening predicted better sleep quality that night. Hennig and colleagues (Hennig, Krkovic, 
& Lincoln, 2017; Hennig & Lincoln, 2018) examined associations between sleep measured 
via self-reports and actigraphy measures with various indicators of psychopathology and 
functioning in a sample of 61 German adolescents aged 14–17. Shorter sleep time (from 
actigraphy) and more dreaming the night before (from EMA self-reports) were associated 
with paranoid symptoms reported the next day, but the reverse path was not significant–
paranoid symptoms the day before did not predict sleep time (Hennig & Lincoln, 2018). 
Among the same sample, shorter sleep time via actigraphy predicted higher levels of 
inattention, whereas other sleep indicators (sensor-based sleep efficiency and wakefulness 
after sleep onset, EMA self-reported sleep satisfaction, positive affect upon wakening) did 
not (Hennig et al., 2017).

Theme 5 summary.—Many mental and behavioral health processes are inherently 
bidirectional; this may be especially true for sleep, physical activity, and substance use, 
which affect and are affected by multiple psychological and physical factors. Through 
repeated, temporally intensive measurement, EMA studies allow direct examination of 
feedback loops in bidirectional processes. Most studies examining bidirectional processes 
in child and adolescent psychopathology relate to sleep, but many additional applications 
are possible. A key challenge in this area is temporally aligning EMA items with the timing 
of the bidirectional process–if EMA items are spaced too closely or too far apart in time, 
the process will be missed (Hamaker, Ceulemans, Grasman, & Tuerlinckx, 2015). However, 
if aligned to the specific research question, EMA provides a powerful means to study the 
nuances of bidirectional relationships.

Theme 6: Temporal dynamics: Watching the ebb and flow of moods and behaviors in 
near-real time

EMA allows dense sampling of mood, behavior, and context before, during, and following 
an event, such as a substance use episode. For example, EMA may allow us to predict 
a hazardous or dangerous drinking event by noting when key risk factors such as NA 
or psychopathological symptoms are elevated. Additionally, it may allow us to observe 
the timing and duration of associated consequences after an event. Such temporally dense 
information is essential for refining our theoretical models of momentary causal process and 
developing parameters for timing and tailoring mobile interventions.

In the child and adolescent psychopathology literature, these types of investigations have 
been used primarily to study substance use. For example, Crooke and colleagues (2013) 
used EMA in a sample of 41 Australian adolescents (ages 14–17) to collect information 
on affect before and immediately following drinking episodes. Evidence supported affective 
dynamics as important for understanding momentary drinking risk. When adolescents drank 
at “intermediate” levels (5–9 drinks per occasion), differences in PA were seen before and 
after the drinking event, with PA being lower before drinking and elevated after. When 
adolescents drank at low (fewer than 5 drinks) or high levels (10+ drinks), shifts in PA were 
not seen before or after drinking events. Similarly, Ross and colleagues (2018) examined 
change in PA and NA before versus after marijuana use in naturalistic settings. Overall, 
NA was higher following marijuana use, but PA was relatively unchanged. Findings differed 
by motivation for use and levels of cannabis dependence. When marijuana was used to 
cope with stress, NA was highest following marijuana use but declined rapidly thereafter. 
PA was elevated following marijuana use only among those with higher levels of cannabis 
dependence.

Similarly, Miranda and colleagues (2014) applied respondent-initiated EMA with 22 
frequently drinking adolescents aged 15–19 using a sophisticated momentary sampling 
scheme to capture naturalistic drinking episodes and subjective responses to alcohol before 
and after each drink. Using “begin-drink” and “end-drink” surveys for each drink consumed 
(a drink-bracketing approach; Piasecki, 2019), adolescents indicated how many minutes 
had passed since they consumed any of their drink, the beverage type, ounces consumed, 
subjective intoxication, and affect. Estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) was 
calculated using standard formulas that show high correlation with actual BAC values 
(Hustad & Carey, 2005). As eBAC increased, adolescents’ stimulation decreased and 
sedation and “high” associated with alcohol increased. Compared to findings from adults 
ages 24–64 (61% alcohol dependent), adolescents showed stronger decreases in stimulation 
associated with increasing eBAC, suggesting important differences in responsiveness that 
may indicate a psychobiological mechanism through which alcohol intoxication may impart 
greater reinforcement to adolescents.

Theme 6 summary.—Although relatively nascent, the use of EMA to establish 
temporal patterns leading into and out of events represents a powerful approach to 
refining momentary causal models and informing development of context-sensitive mobile 
interventions by helping determine exactly when, among whom, and for how long risk is

present (Riley et al., 2011). Most applications have been in substance misuse, but potential 
applications include eating pathology, physical activity, and stress response (see Smyth et 
al., 2018; Smyth et al., 2007 for examples in adults).

Future Directions, Limitations, and Conclusion

Our review of the literature highlights themes describing the contributions of EMA to our 
understanding of the etiology and malleability of child and adolescent mental and behavioral 
health. Given the recent and sustained interest in EMA and wearable sensor research in 
behavioral science (Hamaker & Wichers, 2017) and accelerating technological development, 
the field will likely continue to advance in exciting new ways. Here, we outline three 
particularly intriguing areas.

Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI)

Digital technologies used in EMA studies of youth may facilitate the development of 
ecological momentary interventions (EMI), whereby intervention content is delivered to 
individuals in their naturalistic environments (Heron & Smyth, 2010). EMI falls under the 
umbrella of digital health interventions (Hollis et al., 2017). Digital health intervention 
is a growing area, with mobile applications targeting mental health among children and 
adolescents (Grist, Porter, & Stallard, 2017), and several reviews have focused on the 
evaluation of digital or “mobile health” (mHealth) interventions targeting mental and 
physical health among youth (e.g., Hollis et al., 2017; Seko, Kidd, Wiljer, & McKenzie, 
2014; Turner, Spruijt-Metz, Wen, & Hingle, 2015). These reviews note the promise of 
digital health interventions, including EMI, providing preliminary evidence for feasibility 
and acceptability (Hollis et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2015) and noting the potential of these 
interventions to reach youth who have traditionally been hard to reach.

Evidence for effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy to treat depression 
and anxiety has been found among adolescents and young adults, but the effectiveness 
of digital health interventions for other pediatric mental health conditions remains unclear 
(Hollis et al., 2017), and evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness and real-world feasibility 
of digital health and EMI approaches is needed. Research on EMI in psychology and 
psychiatry is nascent (Myin-Germeys, Klippel, Steinhart, & Reininghaus, 2016); rigorous 
evaluations are needed of the efficacy of digitally delivered intervention content, the 
feasibility of digital intervention approaches to service youth in under-resourced or difficult­
to-access contexts, and ethical considerations related to the delivery and storage of tailored 
intervention content and personal health information.

Deeper and broader integration of sensor technology

Expanding sensor technologies offer potential for more seamless integration with 
ambulatory self-reports. A trend is emerging trend toward deeper integration of EMA and 
wearable sensors via passive, context-sensing systems that may assist the development of 
adaptive assessment and intervention by learning to automatically detect–from self-reported, 
physiological, geographical, and other ambient contextual cues–moments when assessment 
or intervention are most beneficial. Embedding sensor technologies into EMA or EMI

may help realize the vision of “just-in-time” interventions, wherein an intervention need 
is passively sensed and cues delivery of digital intervention content (Nahum-Shani et al., 
2017).

Few applications of context-sensing assessment or intervention approaches with children 
and adolescents exist. The KNOWME network project is a context-aware just-in-time 
intervention with youth, aimed to decrease sedentary activity in ten overweight Hispanic 
youth (Spruijt-Metz et al., 2015). KNOWME integrated wearable sensors to detect 
sedentary activity, an actigraph, and a study-administered smartphone with a “sedentary 
analyzer” that collected, analyzed, and displayed visualizations of adolescents’ activity and 
sedentary behavior. Context sensing was used to determine moments when momentary 
intervention was warranted. When sensors detected that the adolescent reached two hours of 
consecutive sedentary behavior, the smartphone provided a “MOVE” message and alerted 
researchers. If the adolescent did not respond to the MOVE message within ten minutes, 
researchers initiated an SMS message motivational interviewing conversation with the goal 
of motivating the adolescent to engage in physical activity. Adolescents showed significantly 
fewer minutes (p<0.1) of sedentary behavior using KNOWME versus a baseline assessment 
period, and SMS messages were associated with increased physical activity in the following 
10 minutes (p<0.01).

Adolescent and young-adult alcohol abuse is an emerging area for integration of 
sensor technology and EMA. Sensor technology can measure alcohol intoxication 
passively through the skin, offering wearable, objective measurement for assessing 
alcohol intoxication (Barnett, 2015; Sakai, Mikulich-Gilbertson, Long, & Crowley, 2006). 
One relatively well-known device has been validated against field-standard measures of 
intoxication, such as breath alcohol concentration (BrAC; Greenfield, Bond, & Kerr, 2015). 
Approximately 1% of alcohol consumed is eliminated through the skin, allowing the sensor 
to calculate a transdermal alcohol concentration, which, compared with EMA self-reports 
of drinking within an episode, is as an objective “check” against estimated blood alcohol 
concentration derived from momentary self-reports (see, e.g., Barnett, Meade, & Glynn, 
2014). Moreover, because intoxication is measured in real time, researchers can examine 
dynamic features in the intoxication function over time, (i.e., peak level, area under the 
curve, instantaneous rates of change), allowing a nuanced characterization of naturalistic 
alcohol use episodes (Barnett et al., 2015; Clapp, Madden, Mooney, & Dahlquist, 2017). 
Despite the potential for scientific discovery, careful research is needed to address ethical 
and feasibility issues with using alcohol sensors in youth at risk.

Ultimately, sensing in ambulatory assessment studies may strive to become entirely passive 
to maximize just-in-time treatment potential while minimizing participant burden. The 
emerging field of passive sensing uses sensors that are native to mobile devices to infer 
traits and behavioral patterns about individuals and features or characteristics of the contexts 
they inhabit (D. C. Mohr, Zhang, & Schueller, 2017). A benefit of these passive sensing 
approaches is that the participant carries nothing extra, as opposed to the wearable sensors 
discussed previously; the sensors are embedded in mobile phones, which are carried 
habitually by most individuals (Poushter & Castillo, 2019). Passive sensing approaches use 
smartphones’ native sensing capabilities–including device usage data, microphones, ambient

light sensors, and GPS location–to infer context (e.g., crowded noisy bar, private room) 
and behavior (e.g., physical activity from GPS, sleep/wake times from phone usage) in 
real time, with the assistance of machine learning (Bishop, 2006). To date, passive sensing 
approaches have been used primarily with adults. Although passive sensing is costly and will 
require special data protections, this approach offers unique potential for discovery of the 
naturalistic processes linking environments, situations, and behaviors in youths’ everyday 
lives.

Modeling intensive longitudinal data: Moving beyond the multilevel model

As technological capabilities expand, allowing data to be gathered nearer to real-time, the 
temporal density of ambulatory assessment data will expand. Passive sensor technologies, 
GPS sensors, and streamlined mobile survey methods will enable the collection of 
increasingly intensive longitudinal data, providing challenges and opportunities for data 
analysis. Such temporally dense data contain information about complex temporal trends, 
temporal stability and volatility of symptoms and behaviors, and situation-behavior 
contingencies describing the coupling of symptoms and specific situational experiences in 
everyday life. These temporal characteristics likely differ for each individual, such that one 
solution is unlikely to apply to everyone.

MLM–the mainstay for analysis of intensive longitudinal data (including EMA and sensor 
data) in the social and behavioral sciences–has been successfully estimated temporal 
dynamics while allowing them to differ between individuals via random effects. Updates 
to the multilevel model, such as multilevel structural equation modeling and mixed-effects 
location-scale modeling, offer powerful analytic capabilities (Hedeker et al., 2008; Preacher, 
Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010). Although flexible and generative, MLM and its extensions 
are likely to encounter convergence issues when attempting to model both the temporal 
complexity in increasingly intensive or “big” longitudinal data while also allowing for 
heterogeneity in estimated parameters at the between-person level. For many intensive 
longitudinal datasets, especially those involving nearly continuously streaming sensor data, 
other analytic tools will likely be needed.

Alternative approaches to standard MLM may be able to handle this temporal complexity. 
Person-specific modeling approaches, typically employed in N-of-1 studies and modeling 
time series, can be used to estimate temporal and situational dynamics for each individual 
(Molenaar & Campbell, 2009; Ram, Brose, & Molenaar, 2013; Vieira, McDonald, Araújo­
Soares, Sniehotta, & Henderson, 2017; Wang, Hamaker, & Bergeman, 2012). Individualized 
estimates can be summarized and modeled as a function of between-person characteristics 
(e.g., baseline age, sex) in a two-step approach. Similarly, Bayesian multilevel models 
with time-series elements may allow simultaneous estimation of temporal complexity 
and heterogeneity (Depaoli & Clifton, 2015; Hamaker, Asparouhov, Brose, Schmiedek, 
& Muthén, 2018). Advances in dynamic modeling also offer strategies for handling 
complexities present in EMA designs, including models that can capture non-linear trends, 
decaying lag functions across continuous time, and state-space grids defining the dynamic 
behavior of a two-variable system (Hamaker et al., 2015). The increasing richness of modern 
ambulatory assessment paradigms makes a number of analytic applications possible, and the

increasing intensity with which individuals can be sampled will likely push these modeling 
innovations forward.

Limitations and unique considerations of EMA

Despite the power and potential of EMA, it has limitations. First, EMA self-report methods 
may be challenging among youth with severe psychiatric disorders. Evidence supports EMA 
feasibility in populations with severe mental disorder (Ben-Zeev, 2012; Wenze & Miller, 
2010), but adaptations may be required on a per-study basis. Second, EMA may introduce 
measurement reactivity–change in behavior and mood through the process of assessment 
(Shiffman et al., 2008). Reactivity generally only matters when participants show motivation 
to change (Shiffman et al., 2008), but more research is needed before we can claim an 
exact understanding measurement reactivity in the context of EMA. Third, EMA studies 
can be cost-, resource-, and labor-intensive, burdensome to participants; and require a high 
degree of technological literacy. These issues are especially important when working with 
marginalized, at-risk, or under-resourced youth (Simonich et al., 2004; Tyler, Olson, & 
Ray, 2018). Studies may benefit by tailoring assessment protocols to align with day-to-day 
lives to enhance compliance (Heron et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2017). Moreover, creative 
incentivization strategies may keep high-risk children and adolescents engaged. These 
include direct methods (e.g., clearly stated financial contingencies and bonus payments) 
and more indirect methods—for example, recent work suggests that gamification, defined 
as “the use of game design elements in non-game contexts” (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & 
Nacke, 2011), is associated with increased quantity and quality of data collected in EMA 
protocols with adults (Van Berkel, Goncalves, Hosio, & Kostakos, 2017). As the percentage 
of adolescents with a smartphone increases (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), EMA protocols 
will need to adapt to capture youths’ attention (Modecki, Goldberg, Ehrenreich, Russell, & 
Bellmore, 2019; Odgers, 2019).

These limitations notwithstanding, EMA and sensor technologies offer a powerful means 
of investigating and elucidating affective, contextual, and behavioral experiences in the 
everyday lives of youth. Through repeated intensive sampling in naturalistic environments, 
EMA helps reduce recall bias, enhance ecological validity, and articulate a wide variety 
of affective and behavioral dynamics characterizing the lived experience of children and 
adolescents. Wearable sensor data on contextual and physiological parameters provides a 
powerful means to elaborate on, enhance, and validate ambulatory self-reports from EMA. 
Continued research and technological enhancement related to integrations of EMA and 
passive context sensing and developments in complex intensive longitudinal data analysis 
will enable ecological momentary interventions to deliver intervention content to high-risk 
youth when and where it is needed most.

Key Points

•

•

•

•

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) represents a modern idiographic 
approach to studying the lived experiences of typically and atypically 
developing children and adolescents.

Research supports the feasibility and validity of EMA and wearable sensor 
measurement among youth with and without psychiatric diagnoses.

EMA studies facilitate novel measurement and allow investigation of lived 
experience, naturalistic within-person processes, individual differences, and 
temporal dynamics.

Continued research and technological development will foster enhancements 
in modeling, passive sensing, and ecological momentary interventions – 
allowing intervention content to be delivered to at-risk youth at the times 
and places it is needed most.
