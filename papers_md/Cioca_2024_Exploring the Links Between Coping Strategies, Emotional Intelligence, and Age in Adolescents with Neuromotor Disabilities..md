Abstract: Background/Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between
emotional intelligence and coping strategies used by adolescents with disabilities, on the one hand
to understand how emotional skills influence stress management and everyday challenges and, on
the other hand, considering that it could help specialists to develop interventions and educational
programs that support the improvement of emotional skills and coping strategies among adolescents
with disabilities. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 100 Romanian adolescents with
neuromotor disabilities aged 13 to 18 years (M = 15.2) divided into three groups according to the
stages of adolescence: Group 1 (13 years—46 respondents), Group 2 (14 to 17 years—26 respondents),
and Group 3 (18 years—28 respondents). They completed a questionnaire that assessed the emotional
intelligence of the adolescents (positive impression, interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management,
adaptability, and general mood) as well as another one that assessed the possible cognitive emotional
coping strategies (e.g., “blame self”, “acceptance”, “rumination”, “positive refocusing”, “refocus
on planning”, “positive reappraisal”, “putting into perspective”, “catastrophizing”, and “blaming
others”) that they may adopt in managing life situations related to their health problem. Results:
Group 3 has significantly higher scores than Group 2 on the Interpersonal subscale and also signifi-
cantly higher scores than Group 1 on the Stress management. Our analysis also revealed significant
correlations between adaptive coping strategies and emotional intelligence domains across all groups,
with positive associations between acceptance and stress management, as well as between positive
refocusing and adaptability. Regression analysis identified adaptive coping strategies as significant
predictors of emotional intelligence, explaining 29% of its variance. Conclusions: Our findings under-
score the critical importance of targeted interventions to enhance emotional regulation and adaptive
coping strategies in adolescents with neuromotor disabilities. By focusing on strengthening emotional
intelligence and tailoring interventions to developmental stages, these programs can promote better
emotional and social functioning, particularly in challenging situations.

1. Introduction

Emotional intelligence (EI) has attracted substantial scholarly and public interest
following its popularization by Goleman’s foundational work, with its theoretical roots
traceable to the 19th century [1].

EI pertains to a spectrum of competencies that empower individuals to effectively

The construct has been a subject of contention in the scientific community concerning
its classification, with some positing it as a facet of personality and others as a type of

intelligence. According to the prevailing ability model, EI constitutes a specific intelligence
that facilitates adaptive management of emotions, problem solving, and environmental
adaptation [3].

In their seminal work, Salovey and Mayer (1990) elucidated EI as the cognitive capacity
to perceive, comprehend, and regulate emotions within oneself and others, positing it as a
conduit between cognitive and emotional domains [4].

Bar-On further developed this framework with his emotional-social intelligence model,
which underscores the integration of emotional and social competencies, such as adaptabil-
ity and coping mechanisms, as indispensable elements [1]. The coping is a response that
reduces the emotional, bodily, and psychological suffering that is associated with difficult
life circumstances and everyday annoyances [5].

Despite the well-documented link between EI and stress [6], the interplay between EI
and coping strategies remains less clearly understood. While several studies have identified
significant correlations between these constructs [7–10], others have failed to discern a
consistent relationship [11,12]. Notably, scholarly inquiry into the intersection of EI and
coping strategies in individuals with disabilities is scarce, despite evidence suggesting that
children and adolescents with disabilities confront distinct challenges in the recognition
and regulation of emotions, often exacerbated by their physical or cognitive constraints.

From the earliest period of a child’s development, social, emotional, intellectual and

motor skills continuously improve [13].

Children with disabilities may have physical, cognitive or social limitations, impairing

their ability to recognize emotions [14].

Because physical or neurological limitations may make it more difficult for adolescents
with neuromotor disabilities to cope with stress, developing EI is essential to helping them
learn how to adjust to stress and improve their quality of life [15].

Disability can significantly contribute to anxiety in adolescence and their families,
as it often introduces a range of emotional, social, and practical challenges. Adolescents
with disabilities may face heightened levels of stress due to physical limitations, social
stigma, or difficulties in achieving independence, which are critical aspects of identity
development during this life stage. They may also experience anxiety stemming from peer
rejection, bullying, or fear of being perceived as different. For families, the presence of
a disability in an adolescent often brings additional concerns about their child’s future,
social integration, and the adequacy of available support systems. Parents and caregivers
may grapple with feelings of guilt, worry, and helplessness while managing the emotional
and financial demands of caregiving. This shared experience of anxiety within the family
unit underscores the need for holistic interventions that support both the adolescent and
their family, addressing not only the physical and developmental needs associated with
the disability but also the emotional and psychological wellbeing of everyone involved.
Anxiety and emotional intelligence (EI) play critical yet contrasting roles in treatment
adherence. Both highlight the importance of emotional factors in treatment adherence,
with high EI potentially buffering the negative effects of anxiety, fostering resilience, and
supporting better health outcomes. It is well-known that stress is an important factor that
affects everyone, and recent challenges such as the pandemic, bullying, migration, and
geopolitical instability serve as evidence of this [16–23].

Moreover, several studies [24–27] found that children’s emotional development and
expression are also closely connected to the parenting style practiced within the family. Self-
regulation and emotion management techniques, when used, support emotional stability
and give them the strength needed to face life’s challenges [13].

Greater attention from social policies toward people with disabilities would lead to
improved self-esteem, enhanced support from family, friends, and the school environment
and, simultaneously, facilitate the social inclusion of these individuals [28].

The aim of our study was to analyze the relationship between EI and coping strategies
used by adolescents with neuromotor disabilities based on the idea that young people with

Children 2024, 11, 1466

3 of 13

higher levels of EI may be better able to manage emotions and stress, which helps them to
choose more adaptive coping strategies.

Our study proposed the following hypotheses:

H1: The ability to form and maintain satisfying interpersonal relationships increases as adolescents
get older.

H2: The use of more adaptive strategies increases as adolescents get older.

H3: There is a significant positive correlation between the use of adaptive coping strategies and the
domains of EI among adolescents.

H4: Emotional regulation strategies predict EI.

2. Materials and Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted between April and October 2024 at a national
neurorehabilitation center specializing in neurorehabilitation for children and adolescents
with neuromotor disabilities. The center provides multidisciplinary services, including
medical, educational, and psychological support, for individuals aged 0 to 18 years. The
study included 100 adolescents with neuromotor disabilities, divided into 3 groups ac-
cording to the stages of adolescence [29] but adapted at the same time to the requirements
of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation questionnaire, which stipulates a lower age limit of
administration to the age of 13 years. Also, the maximum age for admission to the center is
18 years. Thus, the following groups were obtained: Group 1 (13 years—46 respondents),
Group 2 (14 to 17 years—26 respondents), Group 3 (18—28 respondents).

The participants were recruited using purposive sampling. The inclusion criteria were
as follows: a diagnosis of neuromotor disability, age between 13 and 18 years, and an
IQ score of 70 or above. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the neurorehabilitation center (protocol code 6057,
approval date 19 April 2024). To ensure participant confidentiality, all personal data were
anonymized. The study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki, ensuring that participants’ rights were respected throughout the research process.
The level of emotional and social functioning was measured using Romanian version
of the Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i:YV™) [30], a widely recog-
nized assessment questionnaire containing 60 items. The questionnaire is organized into
7 dimensions as follows [21]: Total EQ, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Adaptability, Stress
Management, General Mood, and Positive Impression. A 4-point Likert scale, ranging from
1 (“very seldom true or not true for me”) to 4 (“very often true of me or true of me”) was
used to record responses to each item [31].

A score greater than 130 suggests the presence of extremely well-developed emotional
and social skills while a score below 70 refers to the presence of severely underdeveloped
emotional and social abilities, highlighting the importance of focusing on improving and
growing such skills [32].

Cronbach’s Alpha ranged from a = 0.72 for the Positive Impression dimension to
a = 0.88 for the General Mood in the masculine’s sample, while internal consistency ranged
from a = 0.69 for the Positive Impression dimension to a = 0.89 for the General Mood in the
feminine’ s sample.

The conscious cognitive strategies of emotion regulation were analyzed using Cog-
nitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), a five-point Likert scale that ranged
from one (almost never) to five (almost always) [33–35]. Nine subscales (with 4 items each)
include the following strategies: “Blame self”, “Acceptance”, “Rumination”, “Positive
refocusing”, “Refocus on planning”, “Positive reappraisal”, “Putting into perspective”,
“Catastrophizing”, and “Blaming others” [36]. These strategies could be “adaptive” or
“maladaptive” [36,37]. Greater use of the strategy is reflected in higher scores.

Children 2024, 11, 1466

4 of 13

Cronbach’s Alpha ranged from a = 0.68 for the blaming others to a = 0.83 for the

rumination strategy [38].

Respondents’ intelligence coefficient (IQ) was measured using the Standard Progres-
sive Matrice (SPM), which is an assessment tool designed for evaluating intelligence in
individuals aged 6 to 80 years [39]. SPM has five series of 12 items each, and the complexity
of the items increases with each series. Every diagram has a missing piece, which the subject
has to find from the given response choices [40]. A score between 70 and 80 represents a
liminal intelligence and a score over 80 means normal intelligence [40].

All analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel and SPSS—version 22—soft. De-
scriptive statistics were used to summarize the socio-demographic characteristics, while
inferential statistics, such as the Kruskal–Wallis test, Spearman’s rho correlation, and linear
regression, were used to examine the relationships between age, coping strategies, and
emotional intelligence.

3. Results

The socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, including gender, age,
residence, and cognitive functioning, are summarized in Table 1 below. The mean age of
the participants was 15.2 years.

An analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of the data, and it was discov-

ered that the data did not follow a normal distribution (p < 0.05).

To determine how the scores for each group were distributed, we calculated the

EQ-i:YV™ questionnaire’s median and standard deviation.

According to the results, the groups are similar in medians on most EQ-i:YV™ sub-
scales; however, Group 3 tends to have higher median scores on Positive Impression and
Stress Management (Table 2).

We used the Kruskal–Wallis test on each subscale to search for significant differences
between groups, even when the medians were equal. This non-parametric test identifies
possible differences in the distributions of group scores even when measures of central
tendency, such as the median, are similar.

Post hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD was conducted for the variables exhibiting
statistically significant differences to identify the specific groups where these differences
were significant.

As shown in Table 4, Group 3 has significantly higher scores than Group 2 (p = 0.030)
on the Interpersonal subscale and also significantly higher scores than Group 1 (p = 0.003)
on the Stress management.

We also calculated the median and standard deviation of the CERQ to figure out
the distribution of scores for each group. According to the results in Table 4, Group 1
showed higher medians in comparison to Groups 2 and 3 for maladaptive coping strategies,
including Blame self, Rumination, and Blaming others, indicating an increased tendency
for this group to use these strategies compared to the others.

Group 2 has higher medians compared to Groups 1 and 3 across all adaptive coping
strategies, including Acceptance, Positive refocusing, Refocus on planning, Positive reap-
praisal, and Putting into perspective. This suggests that Group 2 uses these strategies more
frequently than the other groups (Table 5).

Furthermore, we evaluated whether the differences in medians among the groups

were statistically significant using the Kruskal–Wallis test.

The Kruskal–Wallis test (Table 6) revealed that the difference was statistically signifi-
cant at p < 0.05 (p = 0.003 for acceptance, p = 0.007 for positive reappraisal, p = 0.015 for
putting into perspective, and p = 0.011 for catastrophizing).

The post hoc analysis indicated that Group 1 had a higher mean difference for accep-
tance (p = 0.003), positive reappraisal (p = 0.007), and catastrophizing (p = 0.009) than Group
3 (Table 7).

An analysis of the relationship between the variables measured by the CERQ and
the EQ-i:YV™ was carried out in order to determine whether or not emotional regulation
strategies are associated with the level of EI.

Consequently, Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to examine relationships
between different dimensions of cognitive-emotional coping and EI for each group (Table 8).
In the analysis of Group 1 characteristics, weak to moderate, statistically significant
positive correlations were observed between all adaptive coping strategies and some EI
domains. Our findings included correlations between Acceptance and Stress management
(ρ = 0.302) and Total EQ (ρ = 0.312), as well as Positive refocusing and Adaptability
(ρ = 0.355).

Additionally, Refocus on planning was positively associated with Positive impression

(ρ = 0.511), Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.373), and Adaptability (ρ = 0.293).

Positive reappraisal demonstrated correlations with Positive impression (ρ = 0.415)
and Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.311), while Putting into perspective was corelated to Positive
impression (ρ = 0.296).

Moreover, two moderate statistically significant positive correlations were identified
between a maladaptive coping strategy, Rumination and both Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.518),
and Total EQ (ρ = 0.483).

In Group 2, we found moderate to high, statistically significant positive and negative
correlations between several maladaptive coping strategies and certain domains of emo-
tional intelligence. Thus, Blame self was associated with Positive impression (ρ = 0.414) and
Adaptability (ρ = 0.618), Rumination with Adaptability (ρ = 0.478), and Catastrophizing
with Stress management (ρ = −0.404).

Among adaptive coping strategies, three negative and three positive, moderate statis-

tically significant correlations were identified with EI domains.

Positive refocusing was negatively corelated with Intrapersonal (ρ = −0.557), General

mood (ρ = −0.517), and Total EQ (ρ = −0.524).

Refocus on planning correlated was positively correlated with Adaptability (ρ = 0.674),

while Putting into perspective with Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.467) and Total EQ (ρ = 0.420).

When analyzing the characteristics in Group 3, moderate to high statistically significant
positive and negative correlations were found between adaptive coping strategies and
various domains of EI, with three of the five adaptive strategies showing consistent positive
associations with domains of EI. Thus, Refocus on planning was positively associated
with Adaptability (ρ = 0.441), Positive reappraisal with Positive impression (ρ = 0.424),
Adaptability (ρ = 0.432), and General mood (ρ = 0.575). At the same time, Positive refocusing
was negatively corelated with Stress management ρ = −0.512).

Moreover, we identified moderate to high statistically significant positive and negative
correlations between all maladaptive coping strategies and certain domains of EI: Blame
self with Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.504), Rumination with both Intrapersonal (ρ = 0.520), and
Total EQ (ρ = 0.432), Catastrophizing with Stress management (ρ = −0.586), and Blaming
others with Stress management (ρ = −0.685) and Total EQ (ρ = −0.396).

To investigate the extent to which coping strategies influence the Total EQ, we con-
ducted a linear regression analysis (Table 9). This analysis allowed us to assess the specific
contribution of each coping strategy to the total EI score.

a Dependent Variable: Total EQ.

Model summary: R: 0.539, R2: 0.290, Adjusted R2: 0.219, F (df = 9, 90): 4.090, Sig.: 0.000.
The linear regression analysis reveals that specific coping strategies significantly pre-
dict Total Emotional Intelligence (EQ). The model explains 29% of the variance in Total
EQ (R2 = 0.290), with an adjusted R2 of 0.219. The overall model is statistically significant
(F = 4.090, p < 0.001). Among the coping strategies analyzed, Rumination (p = 0.034) and
Putting into perspective (p = 0.009) positively predict Total EQ, indicating that these strate-
gies are associated with higher emotional intelligence. Conversely, Positive refocusing
(p = 0.021) and Catastrophizing (p = 0.041) negatively predict Total EQ, suggesting that
maladaptive strategies like catastrophizing hinder emotional intelligence. Other strate-
gies, such as Self-blame, Acceptance, and Refocus on planning did not show significant
relationships with Total EQ in this model (Table 9).

4. Discussion

Exploring the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and coping strategies
in adolescents with neurodisabilities is crucial because it provides insights into how these
individuals navigate the unique emotional and social challenges they face.

The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between coping strategies and

EI of adolescents with neuromotor disabilities.

By understanding how EI influences the choice and effectiveness of coping strategies,
researchers and practitioners can identify pathways to strengthen resilience and emotional
wellbeing in this population.

Our analysis has demonstrated that there is a significant difference in the ability to
form and maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships among the three studied groups.
The results obtained indicate a clear hierarchy in the performance of the groups, with
Group 3 having the highest capacity, followed by Group 2 and then Group 1. This finding
confirms our first hypothesis, which assumed that interpersonal relationship increases as
adolescents get older.

Our results are in agreement with a study in the literature that appreciates the impor-

tance of EI in adolescent development with impact on effective social interaction [41].

The analyzed data do not confirm the hypothesis that as adolescents grow older, they
increasingly use adaptive coping strategies, as there is no progressive increase in the use
of adaptive strategies as adolescents age. The order of preferences for the adaptive strate-
gies Acceptance and Positive Reappraisal shows that adolescents in Groups 1 and 2 (i.e.,
younger ones) use these strategies more than those in Group 3. If the hypothesis had been

Children 2024, 11, 1466

10 of 13

confirmed, we would have expected Group 3 (older adolescents) to adopt adaptive strate-
gies significantly more often than the younger groups. Regarding Putting into perspective,
Group 2 uses it more than the other groups. Therefore, rather, we could appreciate that
the distribution of the use of adaptive strategies varies between groups, without speaking
of a clear trend of increase proportional to the age of adolescents, suggesting that this
relationship could be influenced by factors that could be further analyzed.

According to the findings, Group 1 showed the highest pattern of positive relationships
between adaptive strategies for coping and EI categories. For each adaptive strategy, Group
1 revealed statistically significant positive associations with various domains of EI, such
as Positive impression, Intrapersonal, Stress management, Adaptability, and Total EQ,
confirming our third hypothesis for this group.

Groups 2 and 3, on the other hand, demonstrate both positive and negative relation-
ships between adaptive strategies and EI domains. As an example, Positive refocusing has
a negative correlation with Intrapersonal, General mood, and Total EQ in Group 2 and
a negative correlation with Stress management in Group 3. These findings indicate that,
although EI domains and adaptive coping strategies are positively correlated, our third
hypothesis is not entirely supported for these two groups.

Regression analysis highlights how different coping strategies may affect EI. Data
from the linear regression analysis support our fourth hypothesis; Total EQ is predicted by
coping strategies, particularly by adaptive ones

Overall, results from the literature indicate a predictive relationship between emotional
regulation strategies and EI [6,10], with the trend toward the consensus that emotional cop-
ing strategies contribute positively to the development and enhancement of EI. Therefore,
we can reasonably support our fourth hypothesis.

Our study found that rumination—typically considered a maladaptive coping strategy—
was positively associated with Total EQ, which may seem counterintuitive. While rumina-
tion is generally linked to negative outcomes, this finding could reflect a more nuanced
relationship. It is possible that adolescents who engage in rumination might process their
emotions more deeply, potentially leading to greater emotional awareness and, conse-
quently, higher EI. This points to the complexity of emotional regulation and highlights the
need for further exploration of the role of rumination in emotional development.

Nonetheless, this could indicate a complex relationship where individuals who ru-
minate might engage in deeper emotional processing, potentially enhancing their emo-
tional awareness.

Integrating EI training into school curricula can equip adolescents with neurodis-
abilities with the tools to manage stress, build positive relationships, and navigate social
situations more effectively. Similarly, therapeutic interventions focusing on enhancing EI
may empower these individuals to adopt adaptive coping strategies, such as seeking social
support or problem solving, rather than maladaptive ones like avoidance or withdrawal.
On a policy level, understanding the interplay between EI and coping could lead to the cre-
ation of more inclusive educational environments that prioritize social–emotional learning,
foster peer acceptance, and reduce stigma.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the
findings. The sample size, though adequate for preliminary analysis, was relatively small,
which may limit the generalizability of the results and the statistical power of some of
our tests. A larger, more diverse sample would provide more robust data and allow for
more definitive conclusions. Additionally, the cross-sectional design of the study means
that causal relationships cannot be inferred. Longitudinal studies would be necessary
to examine how coping strategies and EI evolve over time and to better understand the
directionality of their relationship.

Another limitation is the lack of consideration of other factors that may influence
both EI and coping strategies, such as family support, social relationships, and gender

Children 2024, 11, 1466

11 of 13

differences. These factors could have a significant impact on emotional regulation and
coping mechanisms, and future research should aim to explore how these variables interact
with EI in adolescents with neuromotor disabilities. Furthermore, the study focused
exclusively on adolescents attending a specialized rehabilitation center, which may limit
the applicability of the findings to other populations of adolescents with neuromotor
disabilities, particularly those not receiving structured interventions.

5. Conclusions

Despite the limitations, our study has important practical implications. The findings
suggest that interventions aimed at improving adaptive coping strategies could help en-
hance EI in adolescents with neuromotor disabilities. Given the significant role of emotional
regulation in social interaction, academic performance, and overall wellbeing, enhancing EI
could have broad benefits for adolescents in this population. Specifically, targeting coping
strategies such as Acceptance, Positive Reappraisal, and Positive Refocusing may help ado-
lescents improve their emotional and social functioning, particularly in stressful situations.
Moreover, the variability observed in the use of adaptive strategies across different age
groups highlights the importance of tailoring interventions to the specific developmental
stage of each adolescent. For younger adolescents, focusing on strengthening adaptive
coping strategies and providing emotional support might be particularly beneficial, while
for older adolescents, interventions could focus on refining existing coping mechanisms
and promoting emotional resilience.

Exploring relationships between EI and copying strategies addresses both the emo-
tional and social dimensions of living with a neurodisability, promoting not only individual
wellbeing but also greater societal inclusion. This research can pave the way for evidence-
based programs that improve quality of life and long-term outcomes for adolescents with
neurodisabilities.
