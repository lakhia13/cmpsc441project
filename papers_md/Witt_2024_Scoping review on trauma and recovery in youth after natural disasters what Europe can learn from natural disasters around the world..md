Abstract
In the last decade, Europe has seen a rise in natural disasters. Due to climate change, an increase of such events is predicted 
for the future. While natural disasters have been a rare phenomenon in Europe so far, other regions of the world, such as 
Central and North America or Southeast Asia, have regularly been affected by Hurricanes and Tsunamis. The aim of the cur-
rent study is to synthesize the literature on child development in immediate stress, prolonged reactions, trauma, and recovery 
after natural disasters with a special focus on trajectories of (mal-)adaptation. In a literature search using PubMed, Psychinfo 
and EBSCOhost, 15 studies reporting about 11 independent samples, including 11,519 participants aged 3–18 years, were 
identified. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. There was also evidence for delayed or relapsing 
trajectories. The proportions of participants within each trajectory varied across studies, but the more favorable trajectories 
such as resilient or recovering trajectory were the most prevalent. The results suggested a more dynamic development within 
the first 12 months post-disaster. Female gender, a higher trauma exposure, more life events, less social support, and nega-
tive coping emerged as risk factors. Based on the results, a stepped care approach seems useful for the treatment of victims 
of natural disasters. This may support victims in their recovery and strengthen their resilience. As mental health responses 
to disasters vary, a coordinated screening process is necessary, to plan interventions and to detect delayed or chronic trauma 
responses and initiate effective interventions.

Background

Lately, Europe has seen a number of natural disasters. Only 
in 2021, Europe has faced large floods in Belgium and Ger-
many, and wildfires, especially devastating in Greece, Tur-
key, and throughout southern European countries. Natural 
disasters are defined as major adverse events resulting from 
natural processes of the earth [1]. They have the capacity to 
negatively impact large groups of individuals at once, often 
causing destruction and injuries, as well as mortality [2, 3].
While Europe has been less affected, but only come to 
face such events in the recent years, other regions of the

world have been affected more intensely. E.g., the U.S. faces 
a Hurricane and Tornado season each year and the country 
has been affected by devastating natural disasters such as 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But also, other regions of the 
world have been affected. To name one was the Indian Ocean 
Tsunami that hit the coasts of India, Indonesia, Maldives, 
Sri Lanka and Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Seychelles, 
Somalia, and the United Republic of Tanzania on Christ-
mas 2004. The consequences were 186,983 people killed. 
Hundreds of thousands of persons were displaced and over 
three million persons were affected, half of whom lost their 
sources of livelihood [4].

Due to climate change, environmental hazards are set 
to increase in Europe [5]. Therefore, for example, the area 
simultaneously affected in EU has grown by 50% in the past 
50 years [6], leading to an estimated fivefold increase in costs 
for flooding by 2050 [7]. Research from 2020 indicates that 
recent floodings have been exceptional and may be related 
to climate change [8]. This research has analyzed almost

10,000 river floods in Europe in the past 500 years and has 
shown that recent patterns of flooding are exceptional in 
extent. Previous flood-rich periods have often been linked 
to cooler average temperatures. Today’s flooding takes place 
in the context of warmer air and ocean temperatures. Also, 
with global warming, an increase in slow-moving storms 
which have the potential for high rainfall accumulations can 
be expected. This is very relevant to the recent flooding seen 
in Germany and Belgium, which highlights the devastat-
ing impacts of slow-moving storms. Research suggests that 
slow-moving rainstorms could be 14 times more frequent by 
the end of the century [9]. This study suggests that changes 
to extreme storms will be significant and cause an increase 
in the frequency of devastating flooding across Europe.

While some areas experience vast amounts of rain in 
short periods of time, other areas experience water shortages 
and droughts. Research indicates that climate change will 
substantially increase the severity and length of droughts in 
Europe by the end of the century [10]. And in turn, droughts 
further exacerbate the risk of wildfires [11].

Clemens and colleagues [12] have reviewed the mental 
health sequalae of climate change. They conclude that cli-
mate may affect children and adolescent in three ways: (1) 
Direct consequences, such as natural disasters; (2) Indirect 
consequences, such as loss of land, flight and migration, 
exposure to violence, change of social, ecological, eco-
nomic,  or  cultural  environment;  and  (3)  The  increasing 
awareness of the existential dimension of climate change 
can influence their mental health. Their results indicate that 
climate change represents a serious threat to mental health. 
They argue that children´s rights, mental health, and climate 
change should not be seen as separate aspects, but need to be 
brought together under one perspective to address the major 
challenges in the future of children and adolescents.

Youth are considered to be most affected by disasters 
(e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and droughts) around 
the  world  [13–15].  It  is  estimated  that  worldwide,  175 
million children are exposed to disasters including floods, 
cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes each year [15]. Youth 
exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic 
stress symptoms (PTSS) with greatly varying prevalence 
rates between 1 and 95% in children and adolescent sur-
vivors of natural disasters [16]. Longitudinal studies show 
rather persistent psychopathology over time and higher risk 
for psychiatric impairment in adulthood. However, not all 
who report initially elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms 
report persistent levels that last beyond the first three to six 
months after the event. It is therefore crucial to understand 
how youth develop after such events and why they differ in 
their adaptation patterns.

A growing body of literature documents heterogeneity 
among adults’ responses to potentially traumatic events [17, 
18]. Across studies, these trajectories are chronic, recovery, 

resilience, and delayed. In this context, the trajectories are 
described by the pattern they exhibit over the observational 
period. A resilient trajectory is usually defined as a stable 
trajectory  of  healthy  functioning  after  a  highly  adverse 
event [19]. In contrast, a chronic trajectory is characterized 
by a stable trajectory of psychopathology, usually higher 
posttraumatic  stress  symptoms,  or  maladaptation  after 
adverse events. Recovery connotes trajectories in which 
normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or 
sub-threshold psychopathology, usually for longer periods 
of at least several months, and then returning to pre-event 
levels [19]. A delayed trajectory is marked by the initial 
sub-threshold psychopathology or healthy functioning, fol-
lowed by an increase in psychopathology, mostly measured 
by an increase of posttraumatic stress symptoms at later time 
points during the observational period [13].

Less is known about the adaptation processes of chil-
dren and adolescents after natural disaster. In their litera-
ture review, Lai and colleagues [13] examined trajectories 
of posttraumatic stress symptoms and predictors among 
children after natural disasters. Their results indicate, that 
mostly three trajectories (resilient, recovery, and chronic) 
were identified. The resilient trajectory was the most prev-
alent. Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, 
and lack of social support were significant risk factors for 
chronic trajectories. However, different outcomes were not 
examined. Therefore, the aim of the present manuscript is to 
synthesize the literature on the psychological consequences 
and recovery after natural disasters and to update the review 
of Lai and colleagues [13] and to expand the review to out-
comes other than posttraumatic stress symptoms. Factors 
associated with more favorable developments, such as resil-
ient or recovery trajectories are examined. Based on the 
results implications for interventions after natural disasters 
are discussed.

Method

A literature search was conducted to examine trajectories 
of development in children following disasters. The search 
was broad, as not only trajectories of symptoms of posttrau-
matic stress disorders were included but also other indicators 
of psychopathology and adaptation after natural disasters 
(e.g., hurricanes, floods). Articles up to August, 2021 were 
included in the search. No start date was applied to allow 
inclusion of older studies. The literature search was con-
ducted using PubMED, PsychInfo, and all databases avail-
able through the EBSCOhost with Boolean operators. The 
following terms and synonyms were used: natural disasters 
and child* and adolescen* in combination with trajectory, 
trauma,  recovery,  resilience,  and  psychological  conse-
quences. Filters were used in each database to search for

manuscripts limited to participants up to the age of 18 years. 
In PubMED, the search included medical subject headings 
with Boolean operators using the terms noted earlier. To 
ensure search inclusivity, articles that cited studies found 
in our search were considered as well. Reference lists of 
identified articles were hand searched for additional relevant 
studies.

The literature search was conducted by the first author 
of the study. The titles and abstracts of each record were 
screened for eligibility by the first author. The full-text arti-
cles were independently reviewed by two researchers to 
identify records meeting our eligibility criteria. The extrac-
tion of data for the descriptive analyses was conducted by 
the first author. Quality of studies was not assessed system-
atically and was therefore not included in analyses.

Studies were included if they (1) were longitudinal, (2) 
examined trajectories of (mal-)adaption, (3) focused on 

development after natural disasters, (4) included partici-
pants up to the age of 18 years of age, (5) were written in 
English or German, (6) were quantitative studies, and (7) 
were published in a peer-reviewed journal. The identifi-
cation process of studies included in the present review 
according to the PRISMA statement [20] is presented in 
Fig. 1.

After an initial screening of the titles of all records, the 
abstracts and partly the methods section of each identified 
article were read to determine whether the record met the 
inclusion criteria, resulting in 15 articles for inclusion in 
this review. The type of natural disaster, age of the study 
population, time points of assessment, symptoms assessed, 
and number of trajectories and percent of the sample fol-
lowing each trajectory were noted. The primary goal was 
to evaluate trajectory patterns of (mal-) adaptation after 
natural disasters among children and adolescents.

Results

This review identified 15 empirical studies on youth tra-
jectories of (mal-)adaptation following natural disasters. 
In total, the studies included 11,519 (n = 141 to n = 4619) 
children aged 3–18 years. The characteristics of all iden-
tified and included studies are presented in Table 1. The 
largest proportion of studies used latent growth mixture 
modeling (GMM) to determine the number of trajectories 
following natural disasters. Only one study [21] used latent 
transitioning analysis (LTA) to determine the development 
of children and adolescents after natural disasters. The 15 
identified studies reported results from 13 different popula-
tions. Three articles [22–24] examined different outcomes 
of the same sample of 1573 children that experienced the 
Wenchuan Earthquake in China, and two articles [25, 26] 
examined different outcomes of the same sample of 391 chil-
dren and adolescents who also experienced the Wenchuan 
Earthquake in China.

Only studies examining populations from China and USA 
were identified. Most of the studies (n = 12) examined trajec-
tories following one event [21–32], but three studies exam-
ined trajectories after multiple events [33–35]. The main 
events examined were the Wenchuan Earthquake (n = 6), 
Hurricane Katrina (n = 5), Hurricane Andrew (n = 2), and 
Hurricane Gustav (n = 2). The studies had between two and 
five follow-up time points, and the follow-up period lay 
between one and 52 months after the disaster.

Trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms

All studies that assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms 
identified resilience and recovery trajectories. Only one 
study [25] did not identify a chronic trajectory, which was 
common in all other studies. The results for a delayed tra-
jectory identified in five studies [22, 25, 29, 34, 35] were 
mixed. Additionally, three studies identified a trajectory 
of low or moderate symptoms [28, 33, 35] and two studies 
identified a relapsing trajectory [22, 27]. The proportions 
of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across 
studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent tra-
jectory (34%–81.6%). Taken together, the majority of par-
ticipants either showed a resilient or recovering trajectory 
(51%–97%). In Fig. 2, the trajectories of posttraumatic stress 
symptoms identified in the literature are presented.

Trajectories of (mal‑)adaptation after natural 
disasters

Four studies focused on outcomes other than posttraumatic 
stress symptoms and examined trajectories of depression

[27], anxiety [23], and academic burnout [26] after natural 
disasters. Only one study [24] focused on an adaptive out-
come, such as prosocial behavior. For other mental health 
outcomes, such as depression or anxiety, a resilient trajec-
tory was the most prevalent and evidence for other trajec-
tories were mixed (see Fig. 3). The results from Qin and 
colleagues [24] focusing on prosocial behavior, indicate that 
a total of 74.4% of the sample show more adaptive trajec-
tories with high enhancing and high stable trajectories of 
prosocial behavior.

Short‑term development

Four studies [22, 27, 28, 31] included time points within 
the first 16 months post-disaster allowing to examine more 
short-term developments. Fan and colleagues [22] identi-
fied an increase of symptoms between 6 and 12 months 
after the event, a decrease of symptoms in the recovery tra-
jectory sets in after 12 months. Liang and colleagues [27] 
identified increases and decreases of symptoms within the 
first 16 months followed by a stable period. Then, after 
40 months, a more dynamic development can be observed. 
Another study [28] identified increases and decreases in 
symptoms within the first 12 months post-disaster, again 
followed by a rather stable period of symptom trajectories. 
La Greca and colleagues [31] identified a decrease in symp-
toms within the first 12 months post-disaster.

Long‑term development

Four studies [27,  28, 32, 34] reported about a follow-up 
period that exceeded 48 months post-disaster. With 6.6%–9% 
of chronic trajectories, they reported relatively high number 
of participants that showed adaptation in the aftermath of 
the disasters. When looking at the results no clear pattern 
of when changes in adaptation occur can be identified. For 
example, the results of Cheng and colleagues [28] suggest 
that changes especially occur within the first 12 months. 
After that symptoms either decline in the chronic trajec-
tory or remain stable within the other trajectories, while the 
results of Liang et al. [27] point in a similar direction, but 
suggest that changes may occur after 46 months post-disas-
ter. On the other hand, the results of Osofsky et al., [34] and 
McDonald and colleagues [32] rather point to less dynamic 
trajectories with more static increases, decreases, or stable 
trajectories.

Risk and protective factors

Except Lai and colleagues [33] all studies examined risk 
and protective factors. Therefore, predictors distinguishing 
between different trajectories, i.e., resilient vs. CHRONIC 
trajectories, were examined. The factors identified in the

studies examining trajectories of posttraumatic stress symp-
toms are presented in Table 2. Across studies female gender, 
a higher trauma exposure (i.e., suffering injury, perceived 
life threat), a higher number of life events, less social sup-
port, and negative coping were associated with less-favora-
ble outcome trajectories.

The four studies that examined trajectories of outcomes 
other than posttraumatic stress symptoms [23, 24, 26, 27] 
also examined predictors of trajectories. Liang and col-
leagues [27] identified an older age, and poorer parental 

relationship  to  be  associated  with  a  chronic  depression 
trajectory as compared to a resilient depression trajectory. 
For anxiety gender, injury of family members, negative life 
events, social support, and trait resilience were significant 
predictors of a resilient versus a chronic trajectory [23]. 
Zhou  and  colleagues  [26]  examined  the  role  of  specific 
posttraumatic stress symptom clusters on academic burnout. 
The results indicated that intrusive PTSD symptoms were 
more likely in the delayed trajectory, PTSD hyperarousal 
symptoms were more likely in the recovery and resilient

trajectory, and avoidance PTSD symptoms were more likely 
in the recovery trajectory. Qin et al. [24] found that male 
gender increased the probability of belonging to the stable, 
slightly declining and sharply declining trajectories of proso-
cial behavior relative to the enhancing trajectory. Addition-
ally, adolescents with a lower level of social support were 
more likely to fall in the stable and slightly decreasing trajec-
tory rather than the enhancing trajectory.

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to synthesize the literature 
on outcome trajectories in children and adolescents after 
natural disasters, and to identify risk and resilience factors 
for more favorable trajectories. Therefore, the results of 15 
studies, based on 11 distinct samples and 11.519 participants 
between 3 and 18 years of age were analyzed. For the most 
part, the results of Lai and colleagues 2017 on posttraumatic 
stress symptoms trajectories after disasters were replicated 
with largely varying prevalence rates for the distinct tra-
jectories. Across studies on trajectories of posttraumatic 
stress symptoms, a resilient, recovery, and chronic trajectory 
(except Zhou et al. [25]) were identified, with the resilient 
trajectory (37%–82%) being the most prevalent trajectory. 

Taken together, six of the eleven studies provided evidence 
for a delayed or relapsing trajectory. This indicates that a 
proportion of children (4%–18%) who experienced a natural 
disaster remain at risk underlining the need for a clinical 
follow-up.

The  evidence  for  trajectories  of  other  mental  health 
outcomes, such as depression, was limited with only four 
studies examining outcomes other than posttraumatic stress 
symptoms. All studies identified a resilient trajectory, but 
generally, the results for different trajectories was mixed. 
While the results for depression trajectories indicated more 
stable developments [27], the results for anxiety and aca-
demic burnout trajectories also indicated more dynamic 
developments  with  participants  recovering  or  showing 
delayed responses [23, 26]. Only one study examined tra-
jectories of more adaptive outcomes [24]. The results on 
the trajectories of prosocial behavior indicate that the devel-
opment of more adaptive outcomes, that may be part of a 
broader resilience concept, might look different than the 
usual resilience, recovery, delayed, and chronic trajectories 
that are expected for maladaptive outcomes [19], such as 
posttraumatic stress symptoms.

A second focus of the literature review was the identifi-
cation of risk and protective factors associated with more 
favorable trajectories. The results of Lai and colleagues [15] 

1 3662 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2024) 33:651–665

were largely replicated. Female gender, a higher trauma 
exposure  (i.e.,  suffering  injury,  perceived  life  threat),  a 
higher number of life events, less social support, and nega-
tive coping were associated with less-favorable posttrau-
matic stress symptom trajectories. However, these results are 
not unexpected as these factors represent well-established 
risk and resilience factors for posttraumatic stress disorders 
[36] and the cumulation of negative life events increases the 
risk of maladaptation [37–39]. Especially, the assessment of 
peritraumatic factors, such as trauma load, the suffering of 
injuries, witnessing traumatic scenes, to have a close person 
being killed or missing, etc. can be easy to assess variables 
that may help to identify at risk populations and to support 
those in dealing with their experiences. Newly occurring 
traumatic events or the experience of negative life events 
may be especially linked to delayed or relapsing trajecto-
ries, as research underlines the impact of newly occurring 
negative events on the psychosocial development of children 
[40]. Therefore, the delayed response (i.e., the relapse trajec-
tory) might rather represent a reaction to newly occurring 
and cumulation of events, rather than a delayed reaction to 
the initial event. This underlines the need for prevention 
measures of adverse life events.

Social support, and less negative coping, both being iden-
tified as protective factors [13, 41] could be relevant start-
ing points for interventions for affected populations. Group 
interventions could be implemented in schools where popu-
lations have been affected by the disaster and teach about 
effective coping strategies and solicit peer social support. 
Additionally, risk communication and disaster education are 
considered important aspects of disaster preparedness [42]. 
The literature suggests that schools are a suitable place for 
risk communication, and that adolescents should be involved 
and engaged in the communication strategies [42]. Due to 
the high risk of persisting psychological impairment in sur-
vivors of disasters, psychosocial interventions for children 
and adolescents have been developed over the past years. 
In their meta-analysis and systematic review, Brown and 
colleagues [43] have analyzed psychological interventions 
for children and adolescents after man-made and natural 
disasters. They found that overall treatments showed high 
effect sizes in pre–post-comparisons (Hedges’ g = 1.34) and 
medium-effect sizes as compared with control conditions 
(Hedges’ g = 0.43). These treatments were trauma-focused 
cognitive–behavioral  therapy  (tf-CBT),  eye  movement 
desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), narrative expo-
sure therapy for children (KIDNET), and classroom-based 
interventions, which showed similar effect sizes. Pfeffer-
baum and colleagues [44] expanded the results of Brown 
and colleagues [43] by also reviewing the type of interven-
tions (e.g., focused psychosocial support) and the settings 
(e.g., schools) or the context where the interventions were 
delivered. However, they identified an overall effect size of 

g = 0.57, indicating that interventions had a medium benefi-
cial effect on posttraumatic stress symptoms and enhancing 
daily functioning. Therefore, highly effective interventions 
for children and adolescents who experienced natural disas-
ter exist and should be made available for them.

As the results of the present review indicate a high het-
erogeneity in reactions to disasters, the question remains, 
how  and  when  interventions  should  be  delivered.  The 
results indicate a dynamic development of posttraumatic 
stress symptoms within the first year, potentially within 
the first 6 months [28], followed by a more stable develop-
ment afterward. However, longitudinal research that exceeds 
48 months post-disaster (e.g., [27]), though scarce, indicates 
that after a longer period, dynamic development in terms of 
relapses is possible. Considering the available data assum-
ing a dynamic development of symptoms within the first 
12 months post-disaster a screening process with multiple 
assessments of posttraumatic stress symptoms within the 
first year seems useful. Assessments should be conducted 
right after the event, after 3, 6 and 12 months post-disaster 
to identify high-risk populations. Additionally, a stepped 
care approach seems useful to address the needs of children 
exposed to natural disasters. This stepped care approach 
should  include  a  classroom-based  intervention,  which 
should be delivered within a short period after the event. 
This broad intervention could be delivered in classrooms 
to strengthen protective factors such as social support and 
should include psychoeducation about trauma and trauma 
reactions as well as negative and positive coping strategies to 
support resilience and recovery. However, schools might not 
always remain open after natural disasters; therefore, other 
modalities of delivering interventions should be considered. 
These may include online interventions and interventions in 
community places or shelters.

As the data indicate a dynamic development of post-
traumatic stress symptoms within the first 6 months post-
disaster the initial broad intervention should be followed 
by a phase of watchful waiting as suggested, for example 
by the NICE guidelines (National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE), [45]). Results indicate that a large 
number of children and adolescents affected show adapta-
tion in the aftermath of disaster. Those still exhibiting high 
levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms after a period of 
6 months post-disaster should receive treatments that have 
been proven to be effective in this context, such as trauma-
focused cognitive behavioral therapy [43].

Limitations

First, this review included 15 studies. However, the stud-
ies included to examine mental health outcomes other than 
posttraumatic stress symptoms only comprised four studies 
with varying outcomes, limiting the generalizability of the 

1 3European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2024) 33:651–665 

663

findings. Clearly, more research on trajectories of mental 
health outcomes, other than posttraumatic stress symptoms 
are needed. Second, studies included in this review only 
focused on samples from USA and China. Even though it 
can be expected that results may be generalizable to different 
cultural contexts, more culturally diverse research is needed. 
Third, retention rates for individual studies and missing data 
handling were different for individual studies. It is possible 
that certain trajectories (e.g., delayed or chronic) may show 
different retention rates. Therefore, attrition rates for trajec-
tories may influence our understanding of proportions of 
the different trajectory. Fourth, the studies included in this 
review used differing analytic strategies (e.g., Growth Mix-
ture Modeling (GMM) and Latent Transitioning Analysis 
(LTA)) which may have also impacted our understanding 
of proportions of trajectories as described before. Addition-
ally, an analysis on quality of the studies was not conducted. 
Fifth, risk and resilience factors have not been assessed pur-
posefully in the individual studies and not uniformly. There-
fore, more research on protective factors is needed to gain 
a more complete picture of factors influencing children’s 
development after natural disasters. Furthermore, a potential 
publication bias needs to be considered [46]. In the present 
review, only scientific literature that was published in peer-
reviewed journals, as well as literature published in Ger-
man or English was considered. Dissertations, other gray 
literature and literature in languages other than German or 
English were not included potentially leading to the fact that 
research on the topic might exist that is not being captured in 
the present manuscript. This might especially be the case in 
research including outcomes other than posttraumatic stress 
symptoms. However, the focus on peer-reviewed literature 
was due to the sophisticated statistical methods applied to 
assure the quality of the studies included in this review.

Conclusion

The  latest  natural  disasters  Europe  has  faced,  such  as 
devastating  wildfires  in  Greece  and  Turkey,  as  well  as 
floods in Germany and Belgium are harbingers of what 
Europe will have to face over the next decades, as due to 
climate change, natural disasters are expected to increase 
in Europe. Youth are especially affected by such disas-
ters.  Research  indicates  a  variety  of  responses  toward 
trauma exposure including resilience, recovery, delayed, 
and  chronic  trajectories.  More  favorable  responses, 
such as resilience and recovery trajectories are the most 
prevalent. However, a substantial proportion of children 
and adolescents experience chronic and delayed trauma 
responses. Most of the dynamic development of (mal-)
adaptation seems to take place within the first 12 months 

post-disaster. A broad screening process especially for 
posttraumatic  stress  symptoms  with  different  points 
assessments within the first year seems useful. Assess-
ments should be conducted immediately after the event, 
after 3, 6, and 12 months post-disaster to identify high-risk 
populations. Additionally, a stepped care approach seems 
useful to address the needs of children exposed to natu-
ral disasters. This stepped care approach should include 
a  classroom-based  intervention  shortly  after  the  event 
including psychoeducation and teaching adaptive coping 
strategies to strengthen protective factors and adaptation 
processes. In places where schools do not remain open, 
other modalities of delivering an initial intervention, such 
as online resources, should be considered. This should be 
followed by a period of watchful waiting including active 
assessment of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Those still 
exhibiting high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms 
after a period of 6 months post-disaster should receive 
effective  treatments,  such  as  trauma-focused  cognitive 
behavioral therapy (tf-CBT, [47]).
