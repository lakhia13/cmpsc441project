ABSTRACT: Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
for borderline
personality disorder and other problems underpinned by difﬁculties with emotional regulation.
The main components of DBT are skills training groups and individual therapy. The COVID-19
outbreak forced a rapid adaptation to online delivery, which largely mirrored face-to-face
programmes using videoconferencing technology. This study aimed to elicit and describe the
experiences and learning of therapists involved in providing high-ﬁdelity DBT programmes via the
Australian DBT Institute, which established an online delivery platform called DBT AssistTM prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report conforms with the consolidated criteria for reporting
qualitative research (COREQ). Seven therapists were interviewed. Data were transcribed and
analysed thematically. Delivering skills training online, either exclusively or in hybrid form (with
face-to-face individual therapy), was acceptable and even preferable to therapists and clients. It
was considered safe, the programme was associated with few non-completers, and it improved the
accessibility of DBT to those who might otherwise not be able to engage in a face-to-face
programme. Skills training utilized a ‘ﬂipped-learning’ approach which improved the efﬁciency of
online delivery. Other unique and helpful features of the online programme were described. The
best outcomes associated with online DBT are likely to be achieved through careful adaptation to
the online environment in accord with the principles of DBT rather than mirroring face-to-face
processes. Further research is required to determine the efﬁcacy of online therapy relative to face-
to-face, and who might be best suited to different modes of delivery.

Despite a limited evidence base (Harvey et al. 2019),
DBT is rapidly being accepted as a transdiagnostic pro-
gramme for clients presenting with difﬁculties with

and generalization in the spheres of distress tolerance,

sionals primarily in coaching rather than consultancy or
‘expert’ therapist roles. DBT has been adapted to pub-
lic health services where it is often provided by clini-
cians not otherwise engaged in or formally trained in
other forms of psychotherapy (Lakeman et al. 2021;
Lakeman & Emeleus 2020). For many people it is the
only treatment option available. The Australian DBT
Institute
(see: https://dbtinstitute.com.au/) provides
‘high ﬁdelity’ DBT programmes. That is, programmes
include all elements of a standard DBT programme,
therapists are accredited and highly qualiﬁed, and
there is scrupulous attendance to adherence to the
principles of DBT as described by Linehan (2015).
This project aimed to explore how therapists and skills
group facilitators have been providing DBT online in
high ﬁdelity programmes for several years.

BACKGROUND

The provision of psychotherapeutic services via tele-
health by general practitioners and some allied health
professions was supported by the Australian Federal
Government through subsidies via the Medicare Bene-
ﬁt Schedule (MBS) programme, ‘Better Access’ during
the pandemic
(Australian Government 2021). The
MBS is the primary means by which the Australian

funds services in primary care.

Government
‘Better
Access’ is a scheme established in 2006 which allows
some allied health professionals to provide subsidized
‘focused psychological strategies’ at the cost of over
$15 million dollars per week (Jorm 2018; Lake-
man 2021). Whilst there has been a rapid uptake of
telehealth initiatives in mental health, the evidence that
it
is or has been effective is assumed rather than
demonstrated by robust evaluations (Reay et al. 2020).
It is unclear whether more people have accessed pro-
grammes such as DBT during the pandemic. Treat-
ment of BPD is not subsidised under ‘Better Access’,
and DBT programmes delivered face-to-face in public
services were
(Lakeman &
Crighton 2021). Broadbear et al. (2021) reported on
the transition to tele-psychotherapy of a specialist psy-
chotherapy service for people diagnosed with BPD in a
metropolitan area in Australia (which included the pro-
vision of DBT) at the beginning of the COVID-19 pan-
demic. The majority of

attendance was regular and non-completion less com-

to people being restricted from working and travelling,

initially

A review of the adaption of DBT programmes in
response to COVID (Lakeman et al. 2022) found that
most published reports suggested that moving online
was safe, acceptable, and may have improved retention
in treatment. However, most accounts relating to adap-
tation of DBT in response to COVID-19 were reactive.
That is, they discussed essentially mirroring the face-
to-face process and content of the standard DBT pro-
gramme in an online environment
(using common
videoconferencing applications). Some commentators
reported concerns about maintaining group cohesion
and identity online, and ‘therapy interfering’ behaviour.
Some privately-run DBT programmes (which are often
funded directly by service users or subsidized by health
insurance) have already established online platforms to
support the delivery of DBT in novel ways. However,
to date, these programmes and adaptations have not
been evaluated.

The Australian DBT Institute is a private mental
health service established in 2004. The DBT Institute
was formed following a formal partnership with Marsha
Linehan’s training organization Behavioural Tech LLC.
Behavioural Tech LLC’s senior trainers travelled to
Australia between 2003 and 2008 providing the DBT
Institute’s clinical leadership with extensive mentoring

workshops to mental health practitioners. Currently,
the DBT Institute’s Australian based mental health
practitioners assist in developing approximately 1000
mental health practitioners annually through profes-
sional development workshops, clinical supervision and
mentoring throughout the Asia Paciﬁc region.

Several documented outcomes have been reported
following the DBT Institute’s professional and service
development
and McCaus-
contracts. Prendergast
land (2007, p. 32) reported outcomes from two DBT
groups at a local mental health service stating, ‘number
and length of hospital
stays decreased over both
groups, from 62 days to 19 days, saving the local hospi-
tal system $49 520 during the 6-month DBT program’.
These savings followed an intensive DBT training pro-
gram with the DBT Institute. Clinical staff in a ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) delivering youth-based
DBT services were required to attend Australian DBT
Institute training. The RCT employed a staggered,
parallel-group design in which 120 participants (aged
16–25 years, and scoring high on measured of emo-
tional dysregulation) were randomized into either an
intensive 16-week programme (which included weekly
individual therapy and group skills training), or an 8-
programme
week
(Davidson
group
only
et al. 2019). The trial
found improvements in both
those in the 16-week DBT programme
groups, but
showed signiﬁcantly greater improvement on measures
of
life, and suicidality risk’ (Davidson
et al. 2019, p. 19). In addition to service development
and professional development of mental health practi-
tioners, the DBT Institute facilitates eight DBT pro-
grammes each week through the telehealth service
DBT AssistTM.

DBT Assist

Developed in 2014, DBT Assist is an Australian DBT
Institute developed telehealth platform. DBT Assist
was initially developed to address the needs of some
clients who reported feeling uncomfortable participat-
ing in DBT group sessions. The requirement of face-
to-face attendance and participation in group skills
training has been proposed as a potential source of
social anxiety and a reason cited for non-completion in
some naturalistic evaluations of DBT programmes
the DBT Assist
(Lakeman et al. 2021). Since 2018,
platform has been expanded to an updated interactive
education portal for DBT group-speciﬁc content and
resources that clinicians and participants use during
telehealth based DBT groups and individual therapy.

The DBT Assist platform provides participants with
access
to skill-speciﬁc teaching videos, worksheets,
weekly reminders of group-based tasks, homework
tasks, mechanisms to review each DBT module, and
skill
from facilitators. DBT
Assist provides individuals with access to the DBT
resources at any time.

implementation support

The face-to-face DBT skills group follows a standard
format outlined by Linehan (2015). The skills group is
largely didactic in focus and provides an efﬁcient
means to teach skills (Linehan 1993). Skills are taught
in modules which explore emotional regulation, distress
tolerance,
interpersonal effectiveness, dialectics and
mindfulness. Modules may be abbreviated but typically
are of around 6 weeks duration and closed to new
referrals during each module. A typical group session
might last from 2 to 3 h and consist of a mindfulness
exercise, homework review,
the teaching of one or
more skills as outlined in a manual (Linehan 2015),
practice or role play, the setting of homework and clo-
sure involving further mindfulness practice. The DBT
Assist online skills training is run over 27 weeks and
aligned to the Queensland school term. This is divided
into three discrete, 9-week modules addressing distress
tolerance, emotional regulation and interpersonal effec-
tiveness. Each module commences with 2 weeks of
mindfulness training. The ﬁnal week reviews the entire
module (see Table 1). The philosophy of DBT and
associated skills such as dialectics and radical accep-
tance (which is sometimes incorporated as a discrete
module) is interwoven in each module.

This aim of the study was to elicit and describe the
experiences and learning of therapists involved in the
provision of high-ﬁdelity DBT programmes via the
Australian DBT Institute in the context of using DBT
Assist as needed or required during the COVID-19
pandemic.

METHODS

Ethics approval was obtained from the Southern Cross
University Human Research Ethics Committee (2021/
097) to undertake semi-structured interviews with key
informants and to subject these data to thematic analy-
sis. The report conforms with the consolidated criteria
for reporting qualitative research (Tong et al. 2007).

Contracted therapists at the Australian DBT Insti-
tute were sent an email inviting them to consider par-
ticipating in a brief survey and a recorded face-to-face
zoom meeting regarding their experiences of providing
DBT online. Participants were invited to ‘opt in’ by

clicking on a link to an on-line survey where the
informed consent procedure was outlined. They were
to provide basic
asked,
demographic information, as well as contact details and
preferred times for the interviews. This purposeful
sampling method (Palinkas et al. 2015) was chosen to
elicit participation from those who had the experience
of providing DBT online using this platform.

A semi-structured interview schedule was developed
based on questions arising from a review exploring the
provision of online DBT undertaken by the project
team (Lakeman et al. 2022). The interview schedule
(outlined in the Appendix S1) was used as a prompt
for topics to cover. These primarily addressed generic
in DBT programmes and how they were
issues
addressed in different modes of delivery. For example,
how content
is delivered differently, how safety is
maintained, how facilitating skills training differs when
delivered online and how therapy interfering behaviour
is addressed. The interviews were conducted by three
researchers via zoom (KC, JH, and RL) who had no
afﬁliation to the Australian DBT Institute and were not
known to respondents. All were experienced mental
health nurses with knowledge of the language used in
DBT, but assumed a na€ıve stance and asked open and
exploratory questions in order to elicit explanation from
participants. Interviews took place in late 2021 (a time
when COVID-19 social distancing mandates were
beginning to ease in Australia).

between 30 and 57 min (M = 46 min) and were audio
recorded and transcribed.

Interviews

The thematic analysis of the transcripts was under-
taken with the assistance of
the software package
NVIVO by the ﬁrst author (RL) using the inductive
approach outlined by Corbin and Strauss (2014). Such
an approach systematically derives
and
themes from readings of the raw data (in this case,

interview transcripts) rather than testing a theory (The
SAGE Dictionary
of Qualitative Management
Research 2008). This involved an initial reading of the
text clustering responses
into broad
themes relevant to the research aims. This was fol-
lowed by iterative process of re-reading, clustering and
recoding, until all responses were represented under
the broad themes. The interviewer reviewed the the-
matic structure and agreed that
it captured the
responses and issues which they discussed. The ﬁnd-
ings are presented as a narrative synthesis, representing
as much of the variance within responses as possible.

therapists for an average of 36 clients (and an average
of 10 exclusively online). The number of online skills
groups facilitated ranged between 1 and 53 (M = 18.4,
SD = 19.7). Two reported being extremely competent
and capable of facilitating and managing online DBT
skills training, and the remainder (n = 5) reported
being quite competent (4 on a ﬁve-point Likert scale).

FINDINGS

Differences between the standard DBT skills
group and the DBT Assist programme

With DBT Assist, therapists or facilitators have ﬂexibil-
ity as to how they run skills group. However, a key area
of difference from usual skills group procedures (which
emphasize teaching skills on the day and providing
handouts to take-away) is that participants are expected
to access the multimedia resources and handouts for
the week before attending the skills group:

Everybody gets ﬁve minutes to describe their home-
work from the previous week’s skill. The only differ-
ence is rather than teaching the skill like we used to
we have people watch videos in preparation for group
and we just review the videos. So we say, “how did you
go with watching the videos? Anything that you need
clarifying? Was the skill understandable?” Then we set
homework related to that skill. So basically, what hap-
pens is the online platform focuses more on the home-
[Therapist 1]
work review and clariﬁcation of the skill.

As a consequence of this ‘ﬂipped learning’ approach
of reviewing content before attendance, online sessions
were often shorter (90 min or less). A feature of the
platform is that a record of what and when participants
review online material is accessible to therapists. Par-
ticipants also upload worksheets and homework exer-
cises online and can engage in asynchronous discussion
forums about the skill or other issues. Not every thera-
pist monitored access to materials, but those that did
were often surprised by the level of engagement and
preparedness of participants:

My men. . . are in there. . . all the time, it’s really inter-
esting. . . they discuss or say, “I don’t get this, this
doesn’t make sense to me”. They post all their home-
work. . . They’re really engaged in the actual plat-
form. . . Young people, not so much. They’ll do their
homework, but they won’t engage with each other.

[Therapist 2]

Some reported the ‘ﬂipped learning’ model (rather
paradoxically) to have made the online skills group

sessions more interactive than would typically be expe-
rienced in face-to-face groups. Having researched the
skill, at least some participants wanted to explore the
application of that skill to their life in more detail than
therapists had come to expect in face-to-face groups.

. . .they preferred the sessions a lot more when they are
more interactive. I think that’s also just to sustain the
concentration. . ., and then also the energy levels too.

[Therapist 4]

Therapists noted differences between DBT pro-
grammes run in the public sector and those run by pri-
vate practitioners. Most respondents had worked in
both sectors. In the public sector, they noted that DBT
participants were often ‘followed up’ by other profes-
sionals, team members or administrative assistants who
would assist with scheduling. In their experience of the
private sector, ensuring follow-up was the individual
it was an impres-
therapist’s responsibility. However,
sion of all respondents that the Australian DBT Insti-
tute programme was more faithful to the principles of
DBT and included all programme components, which
were sometimes not provided in the public sector.
Often DBT practitioners in the public sector have mul-
tiple roles, which sometimes require working in ways
that conﬂict with the spirit of DBT:

. . .my experience is in DBT programs in the public sys-
tem, is that generally the clinicians don’t have time for
consult groups. . . I used to manage a DBT program . . .
so that was my experience. People get really wrung out
because they’re running caseloads at the same time.
DBT consequences start to be used as punishments,
and they’re not trauma informed. So, that’s why I think
people drop out. [Therapist 2]

Therapists noted that the programme, as well as
individual clinicians, were genuinely trauma-informed
and authentic. As one person noted, this manifested in
subtle ways such as ‘externalising the skills’ through ini-
tially learning them via videos or their favourite movie
characters rather than immediately applying skills to
their own lives. Some homework tasks involved partici-
pants ﬁnding and uploading media that demonstrated a
particular skill:

So, the ability to have the clips and the videos and it
allows you to be learning about people’s learning styles
as well. . . If I’m working with particularly adult men,
they really enjoy the videos, rather than this didactic
kind of teaching style. So, that’s good, you teach the
skill and then you use videos to [go] back to the skill,
back to a video. You still use the worksheets in groups
and in session. . . you’d just be ﬁlling them out together

DBT Assist provides

able to access resources on smartphones as well as via

ﬂexibly. There were various ways that access was incen-

including videos of

Preparing for online delivery

Online therapists, as well as programme participants,
require preparation to work successfully online. The
conﬁdence and competence of therapists using technol-
ogy varied considerably, although all
therapists per-
ceived that they had adjusted well.

Clinicians need more education and support in deliver-
ing online services. That’s the key. Clinicians have the
skills in teaching DBT. . . that’s not a problem. But the
anxiety around the platforms, the anxiety around Zoom
and a whole range of things, I think that that’s the
missing piece for online work is to have some educa-
tion about using this. . . [Therapist 1]

Programme participants often needed orientation to
work online, and in particular, before engaging in
groups. One experienced therapist emphasized the
importance of the ‘pre-commitment’ phase in DBT and,
during this time, introduced people to the platform and
discussed expectations about how to interact online.
Whilst, introductory videos were acknowledged as help-
ful for many, others required intensive coaching:

. . .I do intakes. I ask questions such as, “Do you have a
computer? Do you know how to use it? Have you
worked with Zoom before?”. . . Those are like screening
questions but from there until I can ensure that they

they were generally enthusiastic about

Acceptability of the programme and non-
completion

Whilst not everyone preferred this way of operating,
most therapists were highly impressed with the online
facilities but noted they needed to be prepared to
undertake online therapy. One therapist reported hav-
ing a well-resourced ofﬁce with four screens and a
whiteboard in camera view (preferring to use a real
whiteboard rather than an online virtual whiteboard).

I just think it’s wonderful, I’m a big fan. . .I’ve thrown
myself into it. . . if you’re someone that likes to be pre-
pared. . . it’s great. . . online requires preparation.

[Therapist 2]

I was absolutely amazed with how responsive the peo-
ple going through the skills were and collaborative in
general. Especially the sense of conﬁdence that you’d
see when they’ve picked up something really well. . .

[Therapist 7]

Most people reported few non-completers, espe-
cially in the hybrid group. When participants missed a
face-to-face group, they were able to catch up with
DBT Assist.

The concept of DBT Assist for my face-to-face groups
is they’ve got access to the videos at home. One thing
that I have always asked them is as part of when you
get the email for the next week, I want you guys to all
re-watch one of the videos just to cement that idea . . .
you’ve got access to it at home. . .
[Therapist 5]

The attrition from online groups surprised some. It
was suggested that this occurred due to a lack of cohe-
sion and identiﬁcation with others in the online group:

Surprisingly the youth groups that we have set up have
had quite a high attrition rate. It seems that young peo-
ple actually ﬁnd online more challenging than some of
our older participants, which is interesting. . .that’s pos-
sibly just the fact that it is much easier to tune out and
then drop out. Whereas when they are coming face-to-
face they kind of subconsciously build that connection

with the group once they have been a couple of times.
[Therapist 3]

are some unique potential and common problems
working online.

Other therapists noted high attrition in some groups
that they were involved with. One highly experienced
therapist suggested that some people did not feel as
committed to the online skills group and perceived that
they could more easily terminate their ‘membership’.
On the other hand, one therapist noted that attending
a face-to-face group and waiting in a therapy waiting
room can be enormously anxiety-provoking for some
people, and the online option reduced anticipatory anx-
iety considerably. Overall, it appears that the potential
increase in access to DBT online more than offset the
problem of potential premature termination:

We’re in the Gold Coast, and a lot of people we work
with are in Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, South Aus-
tralia, Western Australia, Northern Territory, and
to be able to access a DBT pro-
they’re grateful
gram. . .We have one person who’s a truckie and he’s
never been able to attend any groups because he’s
always on the road. But he can always pull over on the
road and perhaps spend 90 min. . . he joins in the
group in the back of his truck. . . I would say there’s
probably been about a 10 to 15 per cent of people who
have just said, ‘I prefer face-to-face groups’, and we’ve
had a little bit of dropout related to that. . .. So those
people will wait until the next time we’ve got face to
face groups. [Therapist 1]

Challenges and therapy interfering behaviour

The Australian DBT Institute enables some clients of
therapists who are external to the Institute to access
online groups. It was observed that some such clients
appeared less motivated, seemed less well engaged or
did not complete homework tasks as
regularly as
others. This was thought to be due to poorer adher-
ence, on the part of therapists, to the principles of
DBT:

So, people. . . have individual
therapists outside the
clinic. . . They present with more [therapy] interfering
behaviours than when the clinician is one of us at the
clinic because. . .it’s more difﬁcult to ensure that the
individual session follows all the structure of a DBT
session. . . and that’s the reason why they [the client]
don’t really come with homework. [Therapist 6]

Most potentially therapy interfering behaviours are
similar in online environments to face-to-face therapy
and are dealt with in the same way through responding
in accordance with DBT principles. However, there

behaviours. . . one from the clinicians including myself

on time, not wanting to talk, not wanting to do home-
work, there’s no difference there but there is the little
bit of the added thing of,
‘my computer’s not work-
ing’. . . [Therapist 1]

It was acknowledged that it was easier to disengage
online than in face-to-face groups. A co-facilitator was
deemed useful to respond to people in distress and
encourage participation via private chat so as not to
disrupt the group. It was noted that some people, for
various reasons, do not like seeing themselves on video,
or they feel uncomfortable being seen by others. This
was noted to be a particular problem for people with
gender dysphoria or body dysmorphophobia. It was
observed that if people turned their cameras off, then
that could lead to ‘camera contagion’ whereby other
people would also switch theirs off. Discussing expecta-
tions about camera use and if necessary, setting up the
device to minimize self-observation was considered
important in the pre-commitment phase of therapy.
Additionally, reinforcing expectations about being pre-
sent, dealing with distractions, maintaining the privacy
and not messaging people during group activities often
needs revisiting with the group from time to time.

As previously noted, people were often more inter-
active online, and this could potentially lead to over-
disclosure in online groups. One therapist noted that
people could interrupt others:

. . .another
therapeutic interruptive behaviour might
be. . . feeling quite conﬁdent to just interrupt someone
else’s participation. . . I think people are just more
brave or. . . impulse control can be quite challenging
for people. . .
the physical nature of having people
around you, helps you regulate those things. [Therapist
2]

A consequence of people engaging in online therapy
from an environment of their choosing is that there
interrup-
may potentially be background distractions,
tions, the presence of pets, children, and the ubiqui-
tous presence of mobile phones. Therapists suggested
that being distracted was okay but being disruptive was
not.

they’re distracted,

they’re welcome to be dis-
tracted, but if they’re being disruptive, I think that’s
really harmful to the rest of the group. That if someone

is not appropriate,

that

People cited examples of people appearing intoxi-
cated or smoking whilst in groups as being problematic.
At the same time, other behaviours such as eating or
messaging others sometimes might be seen as interfer-
ing. Facilitators need to be role models of appropriate
behaviour, ﬁnely attuned to the impact of behaviours
on individuals in the group and ready to sensitively and
assertively address therapy interfering behaviour:

How do I address that [therapy interfering behaviour?
I individually message people as we might be watching
videos or something like that. . . then they will know. . .
and then obviously their behaviours addressed at the
individual session to follow it up and do their chain
analysis. . .
[Therapist 2]

Maintaining safety online

Some therapists stated that they had experienced no
problems with any client they had been involved with.
This was credited to effective triage of people into the
programme and not
rushing the pre-commitment
phase, which included an orientation to online working
and the development of crisis plans. If clients do not
have an individual therapist directly employed by the
Australian DBT Institute, that person will have an ‘in-
take’ and ‘orientation’ with clinic staff, so they are
aware of expectations relating to group behaviour and
also to ascertain whether the online group will be a
‘good ﬁt’ for them. In response to the question about
safety concerns, one therapist stated:

the start,

. . . they were all seeing individual therapists, and noth-
ing really came up that sparked concern, or that
required us to do a suicide risk assessment or anything.
At
telehealth forms, which
include that they are in a safe space, that someone is
home, some details of who else that we could contact
[if we have concerns]. . . So, we did get all of that infor-
mation. . .
[Therapist 4]

they ﬁll out

The importance of having two facilitators in online
groups was emphasized as a means to respond to dis-
tressed clients. This had not always been the case:

. . . I have only had one sort of incident right back early
on. . . with a youth group. I had a young person who
wasn’t doing so well. . . and they turned their camera
off. Fortunately, I had somebody else in the clinic with

me and I was able to ask them, “can you go and phone
this young person for me and make sure that they’re
okay?” They were actually able to do that. So, another
safety component is to be able to access support from
another clinician if somebody . . . drops off and you’re
a bit concerned about them. . . and having somebody
there that can make contact. Usually that’s what the
second facilitator would be able to do. [Therapist 3]

All

therapists discussed the importance of being
genuinely trauma-informed as well as being aligned to
the principles of DBT. It was an expectation that all
therapists attend a weekly ‘consult group’ at which
therapists talk about anyone not attending, having trou-
ble with group content, or who might have engaged in
therapy interfering behaviour. It is at this meeting that
individual therapists hear about the progress that their
clients have made or any issues which need to be
addressed in individual therapy if they have not heard
via the group facilitator or client concerned.

. . .they don’t generally stay in group if they’re intoxi-
cated, they’ll jump off. But then I will follow up with
them, because I don’t want them to be dysregulated
and feel shame, I need to be able to make sure they’re
safe. So, linking in with them, might be a text message,
sorry you missed out on group tonight, let’s have a chat
about it with your individual therapist, let’s see how we
can do this better next week. That kind of stuff, just
validating what we need to validate, but address the
[Therapist 2]
behaviour and then carry on.

The ﬁndings in this paper are consistent with the ﬁnd-
ings of
reviews of online DBT (Lakeman
et al. 2022) and other therapeutic programmes, which
have mainly reported on rapid adaptation to online
provision due to COVID-19 and reported few difﬁcul-

for what makes a good ‘telemental’ health programme.
The sample size was purposefully chosen and small,
and given this and the inductive methodology, no
claims can be made that the experience or insights of
these therapists represent those of others who might
be providing DBT online in high ﬁdelity or well-
functioning adaptations of DBT. However, the views
and experiences of such therapists have not been sys-
tematically elicited and shared in this way before.

programmes and adaptations of DBT, and encourage
the DBT interested community to discuss how best to
deliver DBT to those who might most beneﬁt.

The therapists in this programme varied in the expe-
rience of providing DBT online, and for some, it was
not their preferred mode. However, these respondents
offer a unique perspective regarding online DBT, as
when the COVID-19 outbreak occurred,
they were
able to seamlessly adapt to online work using a bespoke
platform designed speciﬁcally for DBT. A distinctive
feature of the online platform that greatly enhanced its
acceptability was the ﬂipped learning approach. This is
rapidly becoming a preferred pedagogical approach in
teaching (Hwang et al. 2015), including in the educa-
tion of health professionals (Hew & Lo 2018). Until
now, how the principles of
the ﬂipped learning
approach have been applied to DBT skills training has
not been articulated. The unique approach of the Aus-
tralian DBT Institute in adopting a ﬂipped learning
approach has been to enable online participants to
access all the multimedia resources they need to learn
a skill in the week prior to the skills training group.
These resources have included videos by clinicians and
former program participants. Adapting the principles of
a ﬂipped learning to DBT skills training is likely to
improve in-session engagement while decreasing social
anxiety. Social anxiety has been noted as an impedi-
ment
to successful engagement in face-to-face skills
training (Linehan 2015, p. 30). It reﬂects a more
client-centred approach in which individuals feel
in
control of their therapeutic and learning processes.

A further noteworthy innovation is the completion
of worksheets, diary cards, and outcome measures
online. These tasks assist clinicians and patients in
information related to behavioural
maintaining visual
and cognitive changes over the course of treatment.
For instance, the completion of weekly diary cards,
providing numerical information (in Likert scales rang-
ing from 0 to 4) about the individual’s emotions, inten-
sity, urges and skills use (Linehan 1993). The use of
diary cards enables highly structured individual sessions
with speciﬁc targets according to the scores recorded
during the week. DBT participants are likely to attain
the most beneﬁt from the online programme when
they have an individual therapist who is attuned to the
progress of the person in the online skills group and
can utilize the individualized and targeted resources to
enhance the individual therapy sessions in keeping with
the principles of DBT (Bedics & McKinley 2020).

The use of self-reporting tools and standardized out-
come measures are widely promoted and reported in

Australian health services
(Brown & Pirkis 2009)
despite some unresolved controversy regarding their
usefulness (Lakeman 2004). In this online DBT pro-
gramme, the use of these tools are tailored speciﬁcally
to those with emotion regulation problems. This
appeared to be overwhelmingly positive for participants
and clinicians involved in their treatment. Participants
develop speciﬁc awareness of dimensions of emotion
regulation/dysregulation from the visual representation
of their changes in perception of emotions, impulsive
behaviour and ability to maintain focus on goals when
confronted with aversive situations
(Gratz & Roe-
mer 2004). This sustained focus on problems of con-
cern and relevance to the individual may partly explain
the low rates of reported incompletion in this pro-
gramme.

These therapists did not report problems with group
cohesion and identity, as has been noted as problem-
atic in some programmes (Lakeman et al. 2022). This
is likely to be due to a combination of factors, includ-
ing the availability of skilled facilitators, clear ground
rules, and an engaging platform. Moreover, the frame-
work of trauma-informed care (TIC), under which the
Australian DBT Institute works, ensures that clinicians
help participants function within the regulated zone.
This is particularly important as many participants
attending a DBT programme have some history of
trauma, so by following the principles of TIC (Kezel-
man & Stavropoulos 2012), participants’ needs can be
met in a safe, compassionate and collaborative manner
that minimizes the likelihood of re-traumatization.

Therapists also described scrupulous attention to the
principles of DBT (Linehan 1993) rather than slavish
adherence to treatment manuals or traditional ways of
operating. This orientation includes an emphasis on
preparing clients adequately and spending as long as
needed in the pre-commitment phase of therapy. It
also needs noting that participants pay for therapy (ei-
ther directly or via insurance schemes). In psychother-
apy,
there is a
relationship between paying for service, motivation,
and attendance (Carpenter & Range 1983).

it has long been appreciated that

The clients of this programme had access to techno-
logical resources (internet enabled devices). They were
on the equipped side of the digital divide,
in which
some people do not have access to technology and
which reinforces disparities in health outcomes (Brodie
et al. 2000). It is unclear how great that divide is in
Australia. One therapist, an Aboriginal health worker
who had previously coached Aboriginal people in DBT
skills, noted that he had encountered no Aboriginal

1414

people accessing the online programme. The reasons
were complex and not altogether about access to tech-
nology. Similarly, older participants appeared to not
have the same access as their younger counterparts
due to a lack of technological skills. Further research is
needed to explore programme adaptations needed for
groups who presently do not, or cannot access pro-
grammes such as DBT.

CONCLUSION

The therapists in this research have all been involved
in the provision of DBT online as individual therapists
or DBT skills group facilitators using a carefully crafted
delivery platform. Whilst the provision of individual
therapy via platforms such as zoom is no longer novel,
what is novel is the provision of online skills training
not directly mirroring face-to-face skills groups and
using a platform developed exclusively for that pur-
pose. The learning from the experience of these thera-
pists will be valuable to those who may wish to develop
or deploy high ﬁdelity DBT programmes online. The
experience of these therapists was that delivering skills
training online, either exclusively or in hybrid form (i.e.
providing online therapy as needed), was acceptable,
even preferable for many; was safe; was associated with
in face-to-face pro-
higher rates of completion that
grammes; and greatly improved the accessibility of
DBT to those who might otherwise not be able to
engage in a high-ﬁdelity DBT programme. Further
research is urgently needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings
that the online mode of DBT is as effective as face-to-
face and to determine who might beneﬁt most from
either mode of delivery.

Access to complex therapeutic programmes such as
dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a challenge to
many people who might beneﬁt. Traditionally DBT
has involved weekly skills training undertaken in a
group,
coaching as
required. Adapting all or some components of DBT
online can improve accessibility to DBT programmes
and associated positive health outcomes. This research
explored the provision of a carefully planned, online
