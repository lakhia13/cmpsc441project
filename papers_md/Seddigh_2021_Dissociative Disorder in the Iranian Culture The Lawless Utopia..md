Dissociative Disorder in the Iranian Culture: The Lawless Utopia 

Ruohollah Seddigh 

Abstract  

Epidemiologic  and  etiological  studies  of  dissociative  disorders  are  a  challenging  area  in  psychiatry.  These  challenges 
become more complex when noting that the existing theories cannot explain the differences observed in certain cases; 
for  example,  studies  in  Iran  have  reported  the  prevalence  of  dissociative  disorders  (dissociative  amnesia,  dissociative 
fugue, and depersonalization disorder) as less than 0.6%, and there has been no reported case of dissociative identity 
disorder (DID) in this country; meanwhile, the prevalence of all dissociative disorders in the general population of the US 
has  been  reported  as  18.3%,  and  the  prevalence  of  DID  as  about  1.1%.  Although  several  studies  indicate  the  high 
prevalence  of  dissociative  symptoms  in  many  Iranian  psychiatric  illnesses,  dissociative  disorders  as  a  stand-alone 
disorder have a very low prevalence in Iran. The present article attempts to propose a possible hypothesis for the answer 
to the above questions through a different cultural conceptualization and seeks to be of some help to future studies in 
this area. Certainly, this hypothesis requires a careful study to be validated.

"Dissociative  disorders  are  characterized  by  a 

in 

to 

lead 

disruption  of  and/or  discontinuity 
the  normal 
integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, 
perception,  body  representation,  motor  control,  and 
behavior.  These  disorders  include  dissociative  identity 
disorder, 
amnesia, 
dissociative 
depersonalization/derealization  disorder,  other  specified 
dissociative  disorder,  and  unspecified  dissociative 
disorder (1). " 
Dissociative  disorders  are  a  highly  challenging  area  in 
psychiatry,  a  challenge  that  is  observed  in  both  the 
substantial difference in the prevalence of the disorder in 
different  countries  (2,  3)  and  also  the  conceptualization 
of  their  etiology  (3).  These  challenges  are  exacerbated 
when  the  conceptualization  of  cultural  psychiatry  also 
makes  its  way  into  the  given  explanations.  From  the 
point of view of cultural formulation, the acceptance and 
types  of  dissociative 
conceptualization  of  certain 
disorders  by  a  given  culture 
the  higher 
prevalence  of  these  types  of  disorders  compared  to  the 
rest  of  dissociative  disorders.  For  instance,  dissociative 
trance  and  dissociative  possession  are  highly  prevalent 
in traditional societies, which are in contrast to Western 
societies,  and  dissociative  identity  disorder  (DID)  is 
seldom  witnessed  in  traditional  societies  (2-5).  This 
contradiction  in  the  prevalence  of  these  2  disorders 
(dissociative  trance  and  dissociative  possession  versus 
DID)  is  assumed  to  a  compensatory  nature  because  a 
reduction in  the prevalence of one exhibits itself  via an 
increase  in  the  prevalence  of  the  other.  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  these  2  disorders  are  different  definitions  of  the 
same  phenomenon;  this  may  be  because  there  is  a 
relationship  between  individuals’  interpretation  of  the 
causes  of  disease  (supernatural  vs  modernism)  in 
different cultures, and the dissociative symptoms of DID 
trance  and 
develop 
dissociative  possession.  In  the  first  (DID),  the  cause  of 
this personality change is assumed to be an intrapsychic 
phenomenon,  while  in  the  second,  it  is  an  extrapsychic 
and  supernatural  phenomenon,  and  both  of  them  are 
different  ways  of  dissociative  escape  (avoidance)  from 
accepting 
suppressed 
emotions,  managing  stress,  and  coming  to  terms  with 
trauma –ways that have been accepted by the society (4).  
From the perspective of cross-cultural conceptualization, 
the  traditional  society  has  accepted  that  a  patient  in  a 
changing state of consciousness is not responsible for his 
conduct, and this escape route for expressing suppressed 
emotions  has  been  accepted  in  this  society.  This 
acceptance  has 
trance  and 
possession,  while 
this  phenomenon  has  not  been 
accepted  in  Western  societies.  Meanwhile,  although  the 
modern  world  has  granted  man  no  cultural  license  to 
experience  trance  and  possession  as  a  dissociative 
experience,  the  Western  man’s  need  to  find  a  way  to 
escape  for  expressing  suppressed  emotions  persist  and 
he  has  therefore  found  another  way  out,  an  inner  route

for  experiencing  the  possession  of  part  of  oneself  by 
another part as a phenomenon that ultimately culminates 
in  DID  (4).  This  cultural  conceptualization  can  be  used 
in  both  the  trauma  model  and  the  fantasy  model  that 
explain  the  etiology  of  dissociative  disorders  (2,  3),  an 
approach  that  has  been  seriously  considered  in  the 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
5th Edition (DSM5) (6) and has added to the complexity 
of this field of psychiatry. 
However,  it  seems  that  this  compensatory  theory  to 
explain  the  difference  in  the  prevalence  of  dissociative 
disorders  cannot  justify  the  low  prevalence  of  all  types 
of  dissociative  disorders  in  Iran.  Studies  in  Iran  have 
the  prevalence  of  dissociative  disorders 
reported 
(dissociative 
and 
dissociative 
depersonalization disorder) as less than 0.6% (7, 8) and 
there has been no reported case  of DID in this country; 
meanwhile,  the  prevalence  of  all  dissociative  disorders 
in the general population of the US has been reported as 
18.3% and the prevalence of DID as about 1.1% (9, 10). 
Although several studies indicate the high prevalence of 
dissociative  symptoms  in  many  Iranian  psychiatric 
illnesses,  and  there  have  even  been  reports  of  culture-
related dissociative disorders in some parts of Iran (11), 
these culture-bound syndromes have still been associated 
with  a  low  prevalence  (12).  Overall,  it  seems  that 
dissociative  disorders  as  a  stand-alone  disorder  have  a 
very low prevalence in Iran (13-15). Explaining how all 
dissociative  disorders  have  such  low  prevalence  in  Iran 
is  a  delicate  job  that  has  not  been  completed.  If  the 
theory  of  a  compensatory  and  inverse  relationship 
between  the  prevalence  of  dissociative  disorders  is 
accepted, then how come the lack of DID in Iran has not 
compensated  itself  by  an  increase  in  other  dissociative 
disorders,  like  the  pattern  observed  in  other  traditional 
and  eastern  countries?  Cultural  psychiatry  states  that 
there  is  still  a  need  for  “dissociative  escape”  in  the 
modern world, but its form and method depend on each 
country’s distinct culture. For instance, the prevalence of 
dissociative possession alone reaches 4% of the  general 
population in India (9, 16, 17), or in Puerto Rico, 14% of 
people  experience  dissociative  trance  (called  Ataque  de 
nervios)  during  their  lifetime  (18).  If  the  cultural 
psychiatry  explanation  is  accepted  that  mankind  still 
needs  “dissociative  escape,”  then  why  are  all  forms  of 
dissociative disorders practically rare in Iran and why is 
there no dissociative escape in this country ? 
A popular answer that could explain the low prevalence 
that  Iranian 
of  dissociative  disorders 
is 
to  diagnose 
psychiatrists  and  psychologists  refuse 
anything  they  witness  in  their  patients  as  a  dissociative 
disorder and symptom (13). However, there are very few 
studies  corroborating 
the 
statistics on these disorders are the result of  nationwide 
studies  on  the  prevalence  of  psychiatric  disorders 
performed  under  the  supervision  of  Iran’s  Ministry  of 
Health,  Treatment,  and  Medical  Education  and  guided 
by  prominent  Iranian  specialists  (7,  8),  suggesting  the 

this  answer.  Given

disorders 
the 
questionnaire  used  in  one  of  these  national  studies  was 
GHQ_28(8),  which  could  not  accurately  examine  the 
dissociative  disorders,  and  this  could  be  a  justification 
for  the  low  report  of  the  prevalence  of  dissociative 
disorders in this study, but this objection is not included 
in another national study (7).  
 Moreover,  the  main  question  still  remains:  Given  the 
low prevalence of all dissociative disorders in Iran, if we 
accept that the Iranian people need to find a dissociative 
escape,  then  what  dissociative  outlets  or  routes  exist  in

emotions, 
responsibilities,  and  severe  stresses,  avoiding  mental 
exhaustion, and perhaps more important of all, tolerating 
the suffering of trauma? Outlets that are not recognizable 
by  DSM5  criteria.  Surely  it  is  somewhat  far-fetched  to 
think that there is no need for a dissociative escape route 
in Iran, a country in which the prevalence of psychiatric 
disorders  is  among  the  highest  in  the  world  (19). 
Investigating 
in  Iran  becomes  more 
important when we acknowledge that Iran is one of the 4 
most  traumatic-event-prone  countries  in  the  world  in 
terms of both natural and human traumas (20, 21).

Materials and Methods 
The present narrative review article attempts to propose 
a  possible  hypothesis  for  the  answer  to  the  above 
questions  through  a  different  conceptualization  and 
seeks  to  be  of  some  help  to  future  studies  in  this  area. 
Certainly,  this  hypothesis  requires  careful  study  to  be 
validated. 
A  search  was  conducted  on  these  disorders  in  English 
and  Persian  articles  and  books  published  between  1960 
and  2020  in  MEDLINE,  Web  of  Science,  EMBASE, 
PsychInfo, Google Scholar, and SID databases using the 
identity  disorder, 
following  keywords:  dissociative 
dissociative  amnesia,  depersonalization/derealization 
disorder,  other  specified  dissociative  disorder,  and 
unspecified  dissociative  disorder,  possession  state, 
culture-bound  syndromes,  Iranian  culture,  and  Iranian 
families. 
Utopia: The  term  “utopia”  is used to conceptualize and 
discuss the very low prevalence of dissociative disorders 
in  Iran,  as  this  concept  seems  to  be  the  missing  link  to 
the above questions: A heavenly city with ethereal laws 
that is free from the bitter experiences of loss, mourning, 
and trauma. The concept and elements of this utopia are 
frequently present in the Iranian culture (22, 23).  

Results 
In the Iranian culture, utopia has 2 different dimensions: 
religious  utopia,  which  indicates  a  city  based  on 
religious  principles  with  the  leadership  of  religious 
authorities;  and  philosophical-political  utopia,  which 
indicates  a  city  based  on  wisdom  and  knowledge  with 
the leadership of philosophical-political authorities (24).  

influenced  by 

The important point in the formation of the  idea of this 
utopia  in  the  Iranian  culture  is  that  this  idea  has 
generally  been  formed  in  encounters  with  external  and 
pervasive  traumas,  such  as  the  despotism  of  kings  and 
the  cruelty  of  religious  rulers  (22),  and  given  that  the 
Iranian  culture  is  a  hierarchical  and  authoritarian  one 
from  top  to  bottom  (25,  26)  and  that  the  concept  of 
“self”  against  the  concept  of  “other”  forms  a  small 
element  of  the  individual’s  identity  (27),  in  the  Iranian 
culture,  traumas  are  mainly  the  result  of  the  conduct  of 
“that authoritarian other,” which is political or religious. 
This issue has been frequently considered in studies, the 
best  of  which  are  articles  and  books  on  the  history  of 
crises in Iran (28). In studies conducted in Iran, the most 
important causes of stress and trauma in individuals have 
been  related  to  the  performance  and  decisions  of  the 
authorities  (29,  30).  Consequently,  traumas  are  mainly 
extrapsychic  rather  than  intrapsychic  and  are  often 
public  rather  than  personal.  The  experience  of  personal 
dissociation  therefore  seems  to  have  been  incapable  of 
responding  to  the  need  for  escaping  these  collective 
traumas  and  stresses.  Thus,  when  faced  with  traumas 
that  have  been  mainly 
the  ruling 
authorities’  conduct  (25),  Iranians  create  a  utopia 
through  a  collective  solution  assisted  by  different 
cultural  tools.  Although  other  countries  and  cultures 
certainly  face  similar  challenges  and  this  hypothesis 
cannot  be  made  specifically  for  Iran,  given  the  cultural 
differences between Iran and other countries (31, 32), it 
may be conceivable that solutions to Iranians in the face 
of  these  external  and  collective  stresses  are  slightly 
different  from  other  cultures.  However,  it  should  be 
borne  in  mind  that  the  effort  of  this  article  is  merely  a 
kind  of  theoretical  ideation  and  conceptualization  for 
future  studies.  The  very  low  prevalence  of  dissociative 
disorders  in  the  Iranian  culture  can  thus  perhaps  be 
summarized as such: Given the collective nature of these 
experiences  of  stress  and  trauma  in  the  Iranian  context, 
there has been a need for collective escape routes, so that 
individuals can support each other in a collective world 
parallel to the real world,  which is referred to as utopia 
in this article, and consequently, personal solutions such 
as  dissociative  disorders,  have  not  been  applicable  to 
these circumstances . 
Although  utopia  has  frequently  been  contemplated  in 
Iranian studies, an important and overlooked point is that 
there appear to be 2 utopias in this culture  for escaping 
external day-to-day traumas : 
1.  The  “ideal  utopia”:  A  city  based  on  religion  and 
the 
absolute  wisdom  whose  main  solution  for 
prosperity  and  happiness  of  its  people  is  to  set  up 
rational  and  religion-oriented  idealism  through  the 
integration of reason, feeling, and behavior, and total 
obedience  to  virtuous  authority.  This  utopia  forms 
itself  through  total  obedience  to  political-religious 
authority and with the least deviation from this path. 
The  path  to  prosperity  in  this  utopia  is  thus  the 
absolute acceptance of the proposed truth.

2.  The “lawless utopia”: A city with none of the  moral 
and logical  laws of the ideal utopia in  which people 
are  free  from  religious  and  moral  taboos  and 
constraints  and  whose  aim  is  to  disintegrate  and 
dismantle  the  conventional  structures  and  taboos, 
disobey  authority,  and  not  recognize  it  as  official 
without  actually  engaging  with  them.  While  in  the 
ideal  utopia,  this  parallel  world  and  new  reality 
appears  as  lawless,  it  is  indeed  very  lawful,  but  its 
hidden  and  metaphorical  laws  are  not  tangible  and 
open to judgment for the real world authorities. This 
arrangement  enables  the  expression  of  suppressed 
emotions  without  engaging  with 
the  dominant 
authoritarian  culture  and  could  perhaps  be  called  a 
dissociative  utopia,  a  dissociative  city  within  a  real 
city,  known  in  the  Iranian  culture  as  “Penetralia”, 
and  a  structure  that  is  most  explicitly  manifested  in 
Iranian  architecture  as  a  more  private  structure, 
hidden  from  the  eyes  of  that  stranger  “other,”  with 
totally different laws from those of the outside world 
(33).  

As  stated  above,  much  has  been  said  about  the  ideal 
utopia  and  the  laws  ruling  it,  but  there  are  very  few 
studies  on  the  lawless  utopia  and  its  strategies  and 
dominating  rules  and  it  seems  that  the  escape  routes  of 
the  Iranian  culture  that  have  reduced  the  experience  of 
dissociation  are  rooted  in  this  lawless  city.  These  2 
different utopias can be experienced in one day and even 
at  the  same  time  by  one  person.  For  this  reason,  it  is 
better  to  consider  the  Iranian  culture  a  “dissociative 
culture” that formally recognizes 2 identities at the same 
time,  one  identity  that  is  obedient  to  authority  and  one 
that  is  rebellious  and  disobedient  at  the  same  time,  and 
the  individual  maintains  this  dual  identity,  which  has  2 
sides  just  like  a  coin,  without  disintegration.  Thus,  it 
develops  no  need  for  a  dissociative  experience,  and  it 
suffices  for  him  to  turn  to  the  other  side  of  the  coin  to 
escape  any  taboos,  traumas,  and  painful  emotions,  and 
he can thus come to terms with any negative feelings and 
traumas by using the strategies and methods accepted by 
the  culture  of  this  lawless  city  without  needing  to 
dissociate  from  his  own  individuality.  Although  the 
concept of utopia does not belong exclusively to Iranian 
culture  and  it  can  be  considered  a  global  concept  and 
experience (34, 35), the concept of lawless utopia and its 
active mechanisms are less discussed. Although some of 
these  mechanisms  are  common  in  other  cultures,  we 
have  tried  to  pay  more  attention  to  the  differences 
between  these  mechanisms  in  Iranian  culture  and  other 
cultures.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  this  paper  is 
merely  an  attempt  to  provide  a  theoretical  cultural 
formulation  for  this  challenge,  and  all  propositions 
require more detailed studies in the future. What follows 
is some of the most common mechanisms and strategies 
of  this  lawless  utopia  for  coming  to  terms  with  the 
traumas  of  “that  authoritarian  other”  in  Iranian  culture. 
These strategies differ in the encounter with each of the 
political or religious authoritarian others and yet require 

Dissociative Disorder in the Iranian Culture  

solutions  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  citizens’ 
identity as well. These strategies have been useful for the 
social  conditions  of  Iran,  where  one  or  both  authorities 
have  always  been  dominant.  Meanwhile,  at  certain 
periods  in  time,  neither  of  these  authorities  have  been 
dominant, and different conditions have emerged during 
these  times  that  have  themselves  required  differing 
strategies (36).  
Given  the  above  conditions,  the  Iranian  people  have 
been  constantly  experiencing  4  different  sociocultural 
situations (36, 37). The principles of the “lawless utopia” 
in  dealing  with  these  4  situations  are  addressed  below

Gossip: Gossip is an old social behavior that seems to be 
thousands  of  years  old;  many  articles  have  dealt  with 
gossip and reported several functions for it, including the 
following (38, 39): 
  Reinforcement  or  punishment 

in  ethics  and 

accountability; 

  Showing passive rage toward others and isolating or 

harming others; 

  A means of formation and organization of society; 
  Building  and  maintaining  a  sense  of  community, 
based on common interests, information, and values ; 
  Creating a consultative setting to find the right half to

functions  based  on 

As  evident,  gossiping  is  a  complex  social  mechanism 
that  can  have  different 
the 
individual’s  power  in  the  community  (40,  41),  and  the 
concept  of  coping  with  authority  is  one  of  its  main 
elements,  and  the  function  of  gossip  in  preventing 
dissociation  experience  appears  to  be  similar  to  the 
function  of  “passive  rage”  against  authority,  a  strategy 
that  has  been  referred  to  in  Iranian  anthropology  books 
as  a  way  of  safely  dealing  with 
the  “political 
authoritarian other” (26, 42).  
Satire: In literary terms, satire refers to a specific kind of 
poetry or prose that challenges the undesirable aspects or 
errors of human conduct, sociopolitical corruptions, and 
even  philosophical  ideas  in  a  funny  way,  and  criticizes 
the  social  weaknesses and indoctrinations of the  human 
society  using  humor,  inversion,  anger,  and  parody  (43, 
44).  This  field  is  deeply  rooted  in  the  Iranian  culture 
(45), and studies on the relationship of satire with mental 
health  and  the  function  and  components  of  satire  have 
increased  (45,  46). The  main  challenge  in  satire  is  how 
to deal with political authorities, and for this reason, it is 
among  the  major  mechanisms  of  dealing  with  authority 
in the lawless utopia. 

from 

the  Religious 

Mechanisms  of  Dissociation 
Authoritarian Other: 
Witticisms or Facetiousness:  In the  literature,  “bawdry” 
refers to a writing that is linguistically and thematically 
vulgar  and  rude  and  that  openly  talks  about  sexual 
relationships  and  mainly  deals  with  cultural  taboos. 
Although  the  existing  books  suggest  that  this  kind  of 
narrative  has  a  long  history  and  has  been  of  interest  in 
Western  countries,  especially  during  the  Renaissance 
(47),  but  in  Iran,  its  relationship  with  health  (physical, 
mental,  and  social  health)  has  not  been  examined. 
Meanwhile, bawdry has been a highly common form in 
the Iranian culture, especially in the era of authoritarian 
religious  rulers,  when  it  was  even  taught  in  formal 
classes (48), and it appears to have been an informal way 
of  expressing  suppressed  emotions  and  has  even  been 
used for teaching people about the taboos . 
Rebellious  Mysticism:  Many  writings  in  this  field 
suggest  that  the  creation  of  new  mystical  sects  in  Iran 
has  been  associated  with  the  authoritarian  religious 
rulers  or  the  tyrannical  domination  of  certain  moral-
religious  tendencies  in  Iran.  Many  researchers  regard 
these  mystical  sects,  which  reveal  themselves  through 
the  violation  of  the  morals  and  principles  of  the 
dominating  religion,  as  a  reaction  and  a  way  to  escape 
the  tyranny  and  mental  pressures  of  the  “religious 
authoritarian  other”  of  the  era  (49,  50),  a  reaction  that 
persists even in today’s world (51).  
Music:  There  are  many  articles  on  the  effectiveness  of 
music on improving mental and even physical problems 
(52),  and  music  has  always  been  a  way  of  expressing 
suppressed  emotions  and  challenging  the  authorities 
(53).  This  protesting  approach  has  also  been  of  interest 
in  Iranian  music  (54).  Iranians  have  devised  7  different 
musical modal systems and each lets one into a different 

world and provides a different solution  for the person’s 
particular  mental  state.  In  other  words,  it  is  as  if  it 
dissociates one from the real world and takes one into a 
utopia whose rules are unbeknown and vague to the real-
world authorities and where emotions are allowed to be 
expressed. Of these 7 musical modal systems, 3, namely 
Sur, Segah, and Cahargah, are specific to Iranian music 
and do not exist in European music (55), which is itself a 
key issue. The following addresses the functions of these 
3 specific musical modal systems of Iranian music: 
  Sur:  Sur  is  considered  the  most  important  modal 
system  in  Iranian  music,  since  5  vocal  modes  have 
been  derived  from  Sur,  and  the  influence  of  Sur  is 
also  evident  in  other  modal  systems  such  as  Nava 
and  Segah.  This  modal  system  addresses  “the 
individual  dominated  by  sorrow”  (56-58),  as  if,  by 
accepting  the  individual’s  pain  and  suffering,  this 
modal system acts as a gate  and lets  the person into 
another world. 

  Segah:  This  modal  system  is  popular  in  almost  all 
Islamic  countries  and 
is  most  appropriate  for 
“expressing sadness and sorrow that turns into hope.” 
The  vocal  mode  of  Segah  is  very  sorrowful  and 
despairing  and  lets  the  suffering  person  express  his 
suppressed  emotions  while  infusing  him  with  hope 
(59).  

  Cahargah:  This  modal  system  suggests  the  rising  of 
the sun, the start of life, the radiation of light, vision, 
recognition,  and  knowledge,  and  it  is  as  if  the 
individual  can  find  his  integrity  and  return  to  life 
through  a  new  perception  and  identity  and  after 
passing  these  stages  (60,  61).  This  modal  system 
appears  to  refer  to  an  insight  into  the  language  of 
psychiatry  and  is  associated  with  a  sense  of  self-
esteem and acceptance. 

Iranian  music appears to  move the individual on a  path 
from grief, sorrow, and anxiety to acceptance, patience, 
anticipation,  and  wonder,  and  ultimately  prepares 
him/her for returning to the real world, and boasts a type 
of psychotherapy in this highly complex way.

ambiguity.  Under  these  conditions,  vulnerable  people 
exposed to traumas suffer dissociative symptoms. It is as 
if the laws of neither of these 2 utopias are applicable in 
these  instances,  and  the  bewildered  person  is  left  alone 
in  his/her  individuality  and  has  to  respond  to  all  his 
stresses and sufferings alone in a place that the concept 
of  “self”  against  the  concept  of  “other”  forms  a  small 
element  of  the  individual’s  identity  in  Iranian  culture 
(27). Therefore, in the absence of authoritarian other, his 
lessened  individuality  cannot  handle  these  stresses  and

where  one  is  forced  to  run  away  from  one-self  and  in 
such  circumstances,  one  may  experience  dissociation. 
This  hypothesis  can  perhaps  somewhat  explain  the 
increase  in  psychiatric  and  dissociative  disorders  in 
recent years in Iran when the country has been affected 
by several social and moral crises (62, 63). During these 
years,  both  political  and  religious  types  of  authority 
appear  to  have  been  challenged  and  weakened  in  the 
country (64), and that authoritarian other seems to have 
faded  and  the  bewildered  person  has  been  left  alone  to 
deal  with  stress,  a  situation  beyond  one’s  power. 
Therefore,  the  prevalence  of  dissociative  disorders  has 
had an ascending trend (13).  

this  coherence  despite 

Mechanism of Maintaining the Integrity of Identity:  
So  far,  the  functions  and  mechanisms  in  the  lawless 
utopia;  that  is,  the  other  side  of  the  coin  of  the  Iranian 
culture  have  been  repeatedly  discussed,  which  coexists 
and  functions  simultaneously  with  the  principles  of  the 
ideal utopia. Nonetheless, the important point is that the 
coexistence of these 2 utopian identities does not lead to 
a  dissociative  state  in  the  person,  and  his  integrity  is 
preserved.  To  explain 
the 
contradiction  in  these  2  utopias,  one  can  note  an  old 
Iranian art which, unlike the discussed cases, has exactly 
the same rules and principles in both of these 2  utopias, 
and this unity has preserved the coherence of this culture 
and its people against traumas: 
Calligraphy:  Although perhaps the only calligraphic art 
that has a prominent name in studies is the art of Chinese 
calligraphy,  and  its  effectiveness  have  been  studied  in 
various  studies,  especially  in  reducing  stress  (65), 
controlling  nervous  arousal  after  earthquakes  (66),  et 
cetera, and even review studies support the effectiveness 
of this type of complementary therapy (67). However, it 
seems that Iran’s history of calligraphy is also a turning 
point  in  this  culture.  Calligraphy  is  an  art  form  with 
which  all  the  existing  treasure  of  Iranian  culture  has 
been recorded and formed and which has been discussed 
in  articles  as  “the  finest  and  most  complete  art  form 
among  Iranians”  (68).  These  articles  describe  the 
that, 
transformation  of  Iranian  writing  and  quote 
following the arrival of Islam and the Arabs’ invasion of 
Iran, Iranians gave up their writing (cuneiform, etc), and 
began  to  develop  their  own  special  writing  over  the 
centuries following the arrival of Islam and reached the 
pinnacle  of  their  art  in  calligraphy  by  creating  the 
Nastaliq  hand  in  the  eighth  and  ninth  centuries  AH 
(Anno Hegirae) (69). This form of art began with one of 
the  biggest  adaptations  of  Iranian  culture  to  a  foreign 
culture, and after improving on the art of another culture 
and fully integrating it into their own culture, they turned 
it  into  one  of  the  greatest  arts  of  their  own  and  shined 
with  it  (69,  70).  This  phenomenon  suggests  the  utmost 
level  of  a  culture  coming  to  terms  with  an  external 
trauma  and  adapting  to  it  and  resolving  the  developed 
identity  crisis.  This  art  form  has  brought  together  and 
consolidated  the  components  of  Iranian  identity  like 
cement,  has  become  structured  through  the  thousand-

Dissociative Disorder in the Iranian Culture  

year  efforts  of 
this  country’s  geniuses,  and  has 
developed precise and very fine principles called the 12 
rules  of  calligraphy  (68).  In  other  words,  Iranian 
calligraphy  has  been  a  solution  for  treating  and  coping 
with  what  recent  studies  refer  to  as  identity  confusion 
and  identity  crisis,  and  many  studies  confirm  the 
effectiveness  of  this  art  form  in  the  treatment  of  the 
symptoms and problems resulting from trauma (52, 69), 
and  reports  indicate  that  neurological  mechanisms  are 
involved  in  this  effectiveness  (71).  In  contrast  with  the 
other coping mechanisms discussed, this art form has the 
same  rules  and  principles  in  both  utopias,  which  likens 
its  role  to  the  thread  holding  together  the  prayer  beads, 
and  thus  preserves  the  individual’s  integrity  of  identity 
by the frequent use of contradictory utopias or both sides 
of the coin.

Discussion 
In this review article, conceptualization and explanation 
of  the  possible  causes  of  the  low  prevalence  of 
dissociative  disorders 
the  Iranian  culture  were 
considered.  And  possible  intracultural  strategies  and 
mechanisms  that  could  somehow  create  outlets  for 
expressing  and  managing  repressed  emotions  and 
psychological  suffering  and  trauma  were  discussed. 
Outlets  that  make  the  need  to  experience  dissociative 
symptoms as noted in the DSM5 criteria less felt in this 
culture. 

Limitation 
There  were some  weaknesses in this article. One of the 
most  important  was  that  to  write  the  article,  selected 
sections  of  related  books  that  were  written  specifically 
about  Iran  were  selected,  and  it  was  better  that  the 
general view of the book was taken into account in these 
analyzes.  Another  problem  was  the  lack  of  access  to  a 
number  of  related  books  and  articles  due  to  restrictions 
on  their  purchase  or  outdated  copies.  But  despite  these 
problems, it seems that a relatively acceptable number of 
references used can be the strength of the article and to 
some extent compensate for these weaknesses.

Conclusion 
To  conclude, 
low  prevalence  of  dissociative 
the  Iranian  culture  can  perhaps  be 
disorders 
formulated in the presence of the lawless utopia; it is as 
if every Iranian  has 2 sides, just like a  coin, a side that 
seeks  the  ideal  utopia  and  thoroughly  follows  different 
rules and solutions compatible with the ruling authority, 
and another side that seeks the lawless utopia, which is a 
rebellious  and  taboo-dismantling  city.  The  challenge  is 
that  every  Iranian  possesses  and  experiences  both 
identities  at  the  same  time,  as  if,  in  the  face  of  the 
traumas, stresses and psychological pressures of one side 
of the coin, he/she quickly turns to the other side of the 
coin  and  lives  with  that  side.  Therefore,  this  individual 
appears to live each moment in a dissociative-like space,

but  a  space  that  is  coherent,  and  this  coherence  is 
maintained  by  cultural  elements  such  as  calligraphy. 
Nonetheless,  this  dual  coherent  identity  collapses  and 
dissociation  symptoms  appear  at 
times  of  social 
disorganization  caused  by  an  absence  of  “the

Therefore,  understanding  and  evaluating 
this  dual 
identity  and  space  is  a  challenge  that  cannot  be 
understood and measured through dissociative symptom 
questionnaires based on the Western culture, and for this 
reason,  studies  that  use  these  tools  report  a  low 
prevalence  for  dissociative  disorders  in  Iran.  Therefore, 
it  is  crucial  to  design  questionnaires  that  are  more 
adapted  to  the  Iranian  culture  (72,  73).  In  addition,  by 
carefully  examining  these  mechanisms,  it  may  be
