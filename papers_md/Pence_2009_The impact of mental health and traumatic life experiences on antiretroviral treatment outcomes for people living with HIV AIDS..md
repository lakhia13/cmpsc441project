research has demonstrated that
illness,
especially depression and substance abuse, as well as histories of traumatic experiences such as
childhood sexual and physical abuse. These psychosocial factors are highly prevalent in people living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and predict poor ART adherence, increased sexual risk behaviours, ART treat-
ment failure, HIV disease progression and higher mortality rates. The efﬁcacy of standard mental
health interventions, such as antidepressant treatment and psychotherapy, has been well-deﬁned, and
a small but growing body of research demonstrates the potential for such interventions to improve
ART adherence and reduce sexual risk behaviours. Despite this evidence, mental disorders in PLWHA
frequently go undiagnosed and untreated. Challenges to the provision of mental healthcare for PLWHA
in HIV clinical settings include time and resource constraints, lack of expertise in psychiatric diagnosis
and treatment, and lack of available mental health referral services. Future research should prioritize
the evaluation of mental health interventions that are cost-effective and feasible for widespread inte-
gration into HIV clinical care; the impact of such interventions on ART adherence and clinical out-
comes; and interventions to identify individuals with histories of traumatic experiences and to
elucidate the mechanisms through which such histories pose barriers to effective HIV treatment.

Introduction

The introduction of increasingly potent combination antiretro-
treatment (ART) regimens over the past 12 years has
viral
dramatically reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality in
wealthy countries, with the life expectancy of HIV-infected
patients on ART now approaching that of the general popu-
lation.1 With the transformation of HIV/AIDS from a practical
death sentence to a chronic illness, the objective of HIV clinical
care has increasingly focused on using ART to achieve sustained
suppression of HIV RNA plasma levels and thereby optimize
HIV health outcomes.

Health outcomes among people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA) on ART are heavily inﬂuenced by medication adher-
ence. The levels of adherence required to prevent viral mutation
and ART resistance are very high by the standards of other
chronic illnesses,2,3 and much research has focused on the deter-
minants of and barriers to ART adherence and optimal HIV
health outcomes. A large body of literature, recently summarized

in a set of comprehensive review articles,4,5 now demonstrates
the important role of psychosocial factors, including depression,
substance abuse, stress and traumatic life experiences, in inﬂuen-
cing ART adherence and treatment outcomes for PLWHA.

Depression, trauma and other types of psychosocial adversity
are highly prevalent in PLWHA.6 Mood and anxiety disorders,
particularly depression, are the most common psychiatric diag-
noses,7 – 10 and are 5– 10 times more common in PLWHA than
in the general population.11 In the USA, approximately half
of PLWHA have signiﬁcant depressive symptoms and 20% to
25% meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder.12,13
Depression is twice as common in PLWHA as in comparable
controls.14 The presence of multiple rather than a single psychia-
tric diagnosis (e.g. co-morbid depression and substance abuse) is
the norm rather than the exception.15

While depression is widely recognized as an important
concern for PLWHA, perhaps less appreciated are the prevalence
and consequences of past and ongoing traumatic experiences.16

prevalence of childhood sexual and physical abuse, exposure to
other traumatic experiences and subsequent post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) among both men and women living with HIV/
AIDS compared with nationally representative general population
samples (reviewed in Brief et al.17). This association between
trauma history and HIV status may indicate a causal relationship
(e.g. childhood sexual abuse has been linked to higher rates of
sexual and drug use behaviours that increase the risk of HIV
infection) or may reﬂect the concentration of HIV in marginalized
and disadvantaged populations at high risk of trauma exposure.17
implications for
patients’ success in HIV clinical care. Current mental
illness,
especially depression and substance abuse, predict lower ART
adherence,18 a greater likelihood of failing ART19 and increased
mortality.20 Similarly, patients with more lifetime trauma exposure
are less adherent to ART,21 have more emergency room visits and
hospitalizations22 and have faster rates of HIV disease progression
and mortality.23,24 These associations have generally shown
consistent dose–response relationships: the odds of ART non-
adherence21 and the incidence of opportunistic infections24 increase
with each additional lifetime traumatic experience, and PLWHA
with chronic depression over years of follow-up have higher
mortality rates than those with intermittent or no depression.20

The evidence linking depression to adverse HIV-related
behaviours and outcomes is striking in its strength and consist-
ency.5 The studies that have focused on trauma exposure and
PTSD in HIV, particularly as they relate to behaviours and
health outcomes, are relatively few in number.17 The deﬁnition
of the PTSD diagnosis has engendered much debate, especially
related to the ‘criterion A problem’ (which types of events
should be allowed as potential precipitators of PTSD),25 the
‘threshold problem’ (whether PTSD represents the upper end of
a continuous spectrum of psychological response to extreme
stress or a clearly bounded pathological state qualitatively dis-
tinct from non-pathological stress responses)26 and the veracity
of self-report.27 However, a broad consensus supports the exist-
ence of the PTSD diagnosis, and a number of psychometrically
sound instruments exist to measure both trauma exposure and
PTSD symptomatology.25,28

The pathways through which mental illness and lifetime trauma
inﬂuence HIV treatment outcomes have not been fully elucidated.
Greater severity of depressive symptoms was linked to faster CD4
decline even before the era of highly active ART,29 and some
studies have suggested a direct inﬂuence of depression on the
immune system,30 possibly mediated by diminished natural killer
cell counts.31,32 However, the effect of these psychosocial factors
on virological, immunological and clinical outcomes is presumed
to operate primarily through reduced ART adherence. Past trauma
may inﬂuence adherence through current mental health or substance
use, trust in the healthcare system, coping styles, social support or
self-efﬁcacy, although adjustment for measures of these constructs
in observational data has generally not explained the associations
between trauma, adherence and outcomes.21 Nevertheless,
the
evidence supporting the relevance of trauma history and mental
illness for HIV treatment outcomes is compelling.

improving coping skills.38,39

record,46 and one-third of

Despite the relevance of mental health disorders for HIV out-
comes and the availability of proven mental health interventions,
the available evidence indicates that mental disorders in PLWHA
frequently go undiagnosed and untreated. In a large cohort of
patients experiencing HIV care in the USA, nearly half of those
meeting criteria for major depression had no record of such a
diagnosis in their medical
those
needing mental health services were not receiving them.47 These
deﬁciencies in diagnosis and treatment likely reﬂect a number
of dynamics. In wealthier countries, HIV is primarily affecting
disadvantaged populations with limited interaction with the
healthcare system. For many HIV patients, therefore, their HIV
provider effectively serves as their primary care physician, and
HIV clinical care is the primary point at which a mental illness
could be identiﬁed and an intervention could be pursued.
Providers trained as infectious diseases specialists, however, may
perceive themselves as ill-equipped to look for and treat psychia-
tric illnesses and therefore may be reluctant to ﬁll such a role.
When a mental illness is identiﬁed, HIV providers may make a
referral to a mental health specialist, yet patients may fail to com-
plete the referral for a variety of reasons, including the stigma of
mental health services and ﬁnancial and time barriers.

such purposes,

How can mental health disorders be addressed more systema-
tically in HIV clinical care? First, to address the under-diagnosis
of such disorders, HIV clinics should screen all presenting
patients at regular intervals for mental health problems. Several
mental health screening instruments have been adapted success-
fully for
that were
designed for and validated in HIV patient populations.48 Such
instruments can usually be rapidly administered and scored by a
nurse, assistant or other clinic staff member as part of a standard
check-in process. This class of screening instruments generally
has relatively high sensitivity but somewhat lower speciﬁcity,
implying that positive screens require follow-up from a provider
with some level of mental health training, such as a licensed
social worker, to conﬁrm the presence of a diagnosis.

Mental health interventions that equip existing HIV clinic

staff with the tools
antidepressant treatment may be more readily scaled up into
widespread practice. One promising approach, known as
measurement-based care (MBC),51,52 is an evidence-based strat-
egy for providing depression treatment in non-psychiatric set-
tings by giving clinical coordinators the tools and supervision
needed to accurately identify and effectively manage depression.
In the MBC approach, the clinical coordinator provides decision
support to the treating non-psychiatric clinician, addressing the
lack of psychiatric expertise that is the norm in most HIV treat-
ment settings without requiring the on-site presence of a psy-
chiatrist. These clinical coordinators perform initial assessments,
monitor symptoms and side effects using standardized tools at
regular intervals and make dosing recommendations to the treat-
ing physician based on best-practices guidelines. The clinical
coordinator role can be effectively ﬁlled by a social worker or
nurse given appropriate training and supervision,53 giving this
model the potential to be replicated in a wide range of resource-
constrained HIV treatment settings. MBC has been shown to be
effective in treating depression in primary care settings54 and
has been successfully adapted to resource-constrained environ-
ments,53 although it has not previously been tested in HIV
patients. Such approaches parallel the recent efforts in chronic
disease models such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes care
to empower ‘care managers’ to safely and effectively implement
much of the day-to-day disease management with appropriate
oversight from specialty medical providers.

Future directions

Research has demonstrated the high prevalence of mental health
disorders as well as traumatic and severely stressful experiences
in the lives of PLWHA. Individuals with mental illness, particu-
larly depression and histories of traumatic experiences, are at
increased risk of poor HIV medication adherence, HIV treatment
failure and adverse clinical outcomes. While the need for
comprehensive, accessible and effective mental health services
for PLWHA is clear, the challenges are equally evident. At least
three areas suggest
themselves as high priorities for future
research. First, mental health interventions should be developed
and evaluated that are affordable, cost-effective and feasible for
widespread integration into HIV clinical care. Second, evidence
should be gathered on the effectiveness of such interventions
not only in improving mental health but also in impacting
HIV medication adherence and clinical outcomes so as to guide
limited
policy decisions on the appropriate allocation of
resources. Third, particular attention is warranted for interven-
tions to identify individuals in HIV clinical settings with his-
tories of traumatic experiences and to understand and address
the mechanisms through which such histories pose barriers to

effective HIV treatment. In this era of highly effective long-term
HIV treatment, addressing the mental health burdens of PLWHA
will be an essential component of strategies to achieve optimal
treatment response and health outcomes in HIV clinical care.
