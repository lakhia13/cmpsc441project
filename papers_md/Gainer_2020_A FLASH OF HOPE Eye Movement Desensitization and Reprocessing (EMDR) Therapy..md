EEye movement desensitization and 

reprocessing, or EMDR, is a type of 
psychotherapy geared toward mitigating post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. 
EMDR is an eight-step treatment modality 
that aims to distance patients with PTSD from 
the negative self-conception that can develop 
following traumatic events, while affirming 
and installing positive self-assessments.1 This 
is achieved by leading the patient through 
bilateral stimulation while talking through their 
traumatic memories and negative feelings, 
eventually introducing positive statements to 
replace the negative ones.1 Bilateral stimulation 
can occur in a variety of forms, including left-
right eye movements, tapping on the knees, 
using headphones, or with handheld buzzers, 
known as tappers.2 Patients are asked to rate 
their negative self-assessment on a Subjective 
Units of Disturbance scale (SUD), which 
ranges from 1 (no disturbance) to 10 (worst 
disturbance), at the beginning and end of EMDR 
treatment. Patients are also asked to rate their 
alternate positive self-assessment on a Validity 
of Cognition (VOC) scale of 1 to 7 (1=totally 
unbelievable,  7=totally believable) at the 
beginning, middle, and end of a session.3 The 
eight stages of EMDR are 1) patient history, 2) 
preparation, 3) assessment, 4) desensitization, 
5) installation, 6) body scan, 7) debriefing and 
enclosure, and 8) re-evaluation.1,4 EMDR has 
demonstrated significantly positive effects when 
examined scientifically under well-controlled 
environments.1,5,6

COMPOSITE CASE VIGNETTE 1

Miss M is a 26-year-old woman who presents 

for psychotherapy with Dr. A. She states that 
she has struggled with a lifelong battle of 
generalized anxiety symptoms, which were 
exacerbated by the global outbreak of COVID-19.

Dr. A: At your own pace, I’d like you to tell 

me a bit about your experience.

Miss M: I worked at a restaurant and was 
saving up to go to grad school. I was laid off 
within a week of the lockdown. I was living 
paycheck to paycheck as it was. I, um, couldn’t 
pay my rent that month. The landlord was a 
real jerk—he was always threatening to evict 
people who were late on payments. So, he...
he told us [Miss M and her roommate] that we 
were out of there if we couldn’t pay. We’d been 
behind a few times, so I guess it was our own 
fault.

Dr. A: That must have been really hard to 

deal with. 

Miss M: I took out a loan to pay the rent, 
but after another month of expenses I had 
[pause]...I had nothing. So, he… [pause]
Dr. A: It’s okay, just take your time. 
Miss M: He said we had to go. And long 
story short, I had to move in with my parents. 
That wasn’t easy. They mean well, but it was...
stifling. And I was useless—like, I couldn’t do 
anything but wait and rely on them. And then 
right when I got there, my grandma tested 
positive for coronavirus, and - [gets visibly 
upset]

ABSTRACT

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing 
(EMDR) is a specific treatment modality that utilizes 
bilateral stimulation to help individuals who have 
experienced trauma. This stimulation can occur in a 
variety of forms, including left-right eye movements, 
tapping on the knees, headphones, or handheld 
buzzers, known as tappers. This type of psychotherapy 
allows the individuals to redefine their self-assessment 
and responses to a given traumatic event in eight 
defined steps. While EMDR is relatively new type of 
psychotherapy, existing literature has demonstrated 
positive results using this form of therapy when treating 
patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
by utilizing eye movements to detract from negative 
conceptualizations as a response to a specific trigger, 
while reaffirming positive self-assessments. Research 
indicates that EMDR could be a promising treatment 
for mental health issues other than PTSD, including 
bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, and depressive 
disorders. In this article, the eight fundamental processes 
of EMDR are illustrated through a composite case 
vignette and examined alongside relevant research 
regarding its efficacy in treating PTSD.

Dr. A: [pauses and offers Miss M a tissue]. I’m 

so sorry.

Miss M: I can’t. I’m sorry - I don’t… I can’t 
talk about this. Please, just read my file. Please. 
I can’t talk about it.

Dr. A: It sounds as though you have been 
through a lot of traumatic experiences that 
are difficult for you to talk about. I wonder 
if we might try a specific type of therapy, 
called EMDR, to help you process some of the 
emotions and memories that you have.

Miss M’s grandmother passed away due 
to complications from the virus. Miss M is 
in considerable debt, has lost her financial 
and residential independence, and is deeply 
in the process of grieving for one of her 
primary childhood caregivers. For several 
weeks, memories of the illness have left her 
incapacitated by panic attacks, depression, and 
intrusive thoughts. She is unable to fully vocalize 
her experiences without being overcome with 
emotion. She agrees to learn more about EMDR 
and begin this type of therapy.  

HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL 
FOUNDATIONS OF EMDR

EMDR was originally created by Dr. Francine 
Shapiro, whose fascination with neurological 
pathways led to her explore catalysts through 
which to rebalance the nervous system.7 This, 
she posited, would cause a disruption in the 
information that is dysfunctionally stored in 
the nervous system.7 This link between neural 
disruption and dysfunctional information 
storage was inspired by Shapiro’s interest in 
Vietnam veterans afflicted with PTSD.7 Her aim 
was to find these patients a means by which to 
manage and mitigate PTSD symptoms without 
raising anxiety levels.7 Shapiro stumbled 
upon the eye movements that are integral to 
EMDR accidentally: she found that otherwise 
recurring troublesome thoughts were 
disappearing and held at bay when patients 
experienced saccadic eye movements.7

In Shapiro’s original 1989 study, she found 

that memories of traumatic occurrences, 
including the war itself, childhood sexual 
abuse, physical assault, and emotional abuse, 
went hand-in-hand with the presentation 
of PTSD in the form of intrusive thoughts, 
insomnia, flashbacks, and interpersonal 
issues.8 The dependent variables measured in 
her experiment were a patient’s anxiety level, 

perceived validity of positive self-statements, 
and presenting complaints. She obtained 
measurements of these at the first session, as 
well as at one- and three-month follow-ups.8 
Shapiro’s study (N=22) found that just one 
EMDR session helped desensitize the patients 
to their traumatic memories and shifted their 
cognitive perceptions of the circumstances. 
These outcomes were sustained at the three-
month follow-up visit.8

There are two prevailing hypotheses 
regarding EMDR’s efficacy. The first is that 
eye movements facilitate communication 
between the left and right hemispheres of 
the brain.9,10 When this happens, individuals 
are purported to be able to recall unpleasant 
events without negative psychological or 
physical ramifications.11 Under this hypothesis, 
it is not important which sensory channels 
incentivize communication between the left 
and right hemispheres but that there is an 
alternating and rhythmic left-right stimulus.12 
Left-right beeping, tactile simulation, or visual 
stimuli can potentially create interhemispheric 
communication.9

The second hypothesis is that EMDR places 

a stress on working memory during recall 
experiences.9 Working memory is "a function of 
short-term memory that provides temporary 
storage and manipulation of the information 
necessary for cognitive tasks such as language 
comprehension, learning, and reasoning,"13 
while long-term memory contains inactive 
memories and knowledge. While the capacity 
of long-term memory is extensive, that 
of working memory is limited.12 By taxing 
working memory, EMDR inhibits the negative 
effects of unpleasant memories on individuals 
with PTSD.14 

EMDR AS A TREATMENT FOR PTSD 
PSTD symptoms occur as a response to 
memories of traumatic occurrences.15 The 
use of behavior modification exposure 
practices, including flooding and systematic 
desensitization, is not a new phenomenon 
in treating these triggering memories.16,17 
However, clinical applications of these methods 
have indicated these practices can cause 
trauma or disturbance in patients, leading to 
the requirement of numerous sessions in order 
to make progress.15  

A 1998 study conducted by Carlson et al 
found that military veterans exposed to EMDR 

experienced a 77-percent remission in their 
PTSD diagnosis within 12 sessions.18 A meta-
analysis conducted by Van Etten and Taylor 
found that EMDR was just as, if not more than, 
effective as exposure therapy in its ability to 
minimize PTSD symptoms efficiently.19 Findings 
from a randomized EMDR trial conducted by 
Edmond et al that included adult sexual assault 
survivors indicated that EMDR was more 
effective than routine treatment of minimizing 
PTSD.20

Randomized clinical trials with EMDR and 

CBT for adult patients with PTSD indicate 
that EMDR was just as, if not more, effective 
as cognitive behavioral therapy in symptom 
mitigation, without requiring patients to 
complete “homework” in between psychiatric 
visits.21 

A review article evaluating EMDR as a 
group protocol indicated positive effects on 
236 children suffering from PTSD following an 
Italian plane crash.22 Two other 2006 studies 
served to further the scientific community’s 
understanding of the effects of EMDR among 
survivors of natural disasters: the first review 
article showed the positive effects of EMDR as 
a group protocol among children following a 
Mexican flood,23 and the second highlighted 
the efficacy of EMDR as an individual treatment 
among 1,500 adult earthquake survivors in 
Turkey.24

In a 2018 study by Gil-Jardiné et al, 
researchers evaluated individuals who 
visited an emergency room following a 
traumatic event.25 Their findings indicated 
that approximately 20 percent of the subjects 
would go on to have life-long post-traumatic 
stress symptoms that severely impacted their 
quality of life, including post-concussion like 
symptoms (PCLS).25 One-hundred abnd thirty 
subjects at high risk for PCLS were randomly 
placed into three groups: one group received 
EMDR, another received reassurance, and the 
last served as a control group. The study found 
that 65 percent of the control group, 37 percent 
of the reassurance group, and 18 percent of the 
EMDR group were found to have PCLS three 
months after their initial visit. The same study 
found that 19 percent of the control group, 
16 percent of the reassurance group, and only 
three percent of the EMDR group were found to 
have PTSD symptoms. This study supports the 
use of EMDR in an acute setting.25 

A 2020 study conducted by Proudluck and 

13

ICNS  INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE  July–September 2020 • Volume 17 • Number 7–9PSYCHOTHERAPY ROUNDS 
 
 
colleagues (N=72) found that the majority of 
the patients who had experienced at least one 
traumatic event needed less than 10 EMDR 
sessions to experience a return to a stable 
mental state, with no referral for additional 
psychological treatment.26 EMDR has also 
yielded promising results among female 
patients with cancer: In randomized, controlled 
trial published in 2018, researchers found 
that PTSD, anxiety, and depression rates were 
significantly lower among women with cancer 
who received EMDR than among a control 
group who did not.27 

One of the most positive findings of EMDR is 
that it does not necessarily need to be confined 
to an in-person, in-office setting in order to 
be effective.28 A study of the effects of varying 
EMDR formats on veterans with PTSD found 
that EMDR treatments were equally effective 
when done in weekly one-one-one sessions 
or in ntensive 10-day daily group sessions. 
In both cases, EMDR yielded significant 
treatment outcomes that were sustained at 
one-year follow-up.28 In summary, research 
has indicated that this treatment can yield 
beneficial results across various age groups and 
treatment formats.  

NEUROBIOLOGY INVOLVED WITH EMDR
A 2017 study by Bossini et al analyzing 
shifts in the brain following EMDR treatment 
found no changes in brain scans for controls 
after three months, while finding significant 
changes in brain scans of the EMDR patients.29 
These changes included increased grey matter 
volume (GMV) in left parahippocampal gyrus 
and a significant decrease in GMV in the left 
thalamus region. At the end of the study, 16 
out of 19 patients in the EMDR group no longer 
met criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, which was 
reflected as a significant improvement on the 
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale.29

Another study conducted by Santarnecchi 

and colleagues showed an increased 
connectivity between the right temporal pole 
and the bilateral superior medial frontal gyrus, 
as well as a decrease in connectivity between 
the left temporal pole and the left cuneus in 
patients following EMDR therapy.30 Findings of 
greater connectivity between temporal pole and 
prefrontal regions might indicate heightened 
control of trauma-related memories and 
thoughts, minimizing their intrusiveness during 
everyday scenarios.31 Generally speaking, this 

14

FIGURE 1. The 8 Phases of EMDR. 

indicates that mitigation of PTSD symptoms is 
not limited to the sphere of sensorial processing, 
but might actually encompass cognitive 
networks as well.30

Propper and Christman32 hypothesized 
that when both the right- and left-brain 
hemispheres are stimulated during EMDR, 
memory processing is improved through 
enhanced interhemispheric communication 
via the corpus callosum. Left and right saccadic 
horizontal eye movements have been shown 
to selectively stimulate the contralateral 
hemisphere.33 Christman et al conveyed that left 
and right saccadic horizontal eye movements 
decreased asymmetries in hemispheric 
activation, resulting in equal activation of both 
hemispheres.33 Additionally, interhemispheric 
electroencephalographic interactions increase 
significantly during rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep, and these interactions have been 
specifically linked to left and right saccadic 
horizontal eye movements.32 However, many 
studies have reported significant saccade-
induced enhancements  in memory retrieval 
in individuals who are strongly right- or 
left-handed, but not individuals who are 
mixed-handed.10 Individuals who are mixed-
handed have a larger corpus collosum, which 
might enhance the communication between 
hemispheres.10 

Though the exact mechanisms by 
which EMDR operates are unknown, the 
aforementioned studies suggest that EMDR 
does not place a “damper” on PTSD symptoms 
but that it helps to rewire cognitive processes, 
undoing the psychological damage caused 
by traumatic experiences and mitigating the 
presentation of PTSD.  

THE EIGHT PHASES OF EMDR

The overall goal of EMDR is to empower 
patients to process traumatic experiences and 
improve general quality of life.34 The process 
by which this is done is divided into eight 
major phases.5 First, individuals are asked 
to recall unpleasant or triggering memories 
for a predetermined amount of time, usually 
several seconds. They are then asked to rate 
these memories by vividness of recall and 
emotionality of experience (e.g., discomfort, 
unpleasantness, sadness). Next, the individuals 
are asked to recall these memories once again, 
but for a longer period (between 20 and 30 
seconds). While experiencing this second recall, 
the individuals might be left to do so without 
a dual task (known as “recall only”), or they 
might be directed to make eye movements 
during their recall period (“recall and eye 
movements”). After a break in recalls, which 
might last over a span of minutes or days, 
patients are asked to recall their memories 
under the same circumstances as the first time. 
Then they are asked to rate the experience once 
again in terms of vividness and emotionality.35  

PHASE 1: PATIENT HISTORY

Phase 1 occurs over the course of the first 
few sessions, but might extend throughout the 
rest of the process, especially if new trauma 
occurs.5 During this time, the therapist and 
patient discuss the problem that motivated 
the patient to seek treatment, as well as the 
behaviors and symptoms resulting from this 
problem.4 This is known as the “target event.”3 
The therapist will utilize standard intake 
questionnaires and diagnostic psychometrics. 
These initial conversations and questions will

that have led her to present for treatment. In the 
third session, the assessment phase begins.

Dr. A: As you focus on your experiences with 
COVID-19, what image or scene represents the 
worst part of it?

Miss M: Getting the phone call that my 
grandma was gone. We…[breaks off] we 
didn’t get to see her or say goodbye. We 
[through tears] couldn’t celebrate her life 
together. It was so fast, and my mom was just 
breaking down, and my dad was quiet, and 
I just...couldn’t feel anything. It’s like I was 
trapped in that horrible moment for months. I 
just kept seeing her there, dying alone without 
us, hooked up to all those tubes. And now, still 
being in that house where I learned she died, 
still not having moved forward [pauses]... I...
it’s all a really freaking bad image, honestly.
Dr. A: Holding that image in your mind, 
what words would you use to describe your 
negative belief about yourself now? 

Miss M: I - I don’t know. [Laughs] I guess 
that’s it. I don’t know anything. Lost. Useless. 
Inept. Disappointing. I’m useless, and I can’t do 
anything about it.

 Dr. A: That’s normal, Miss M. You’ve been 

through a trauma. When that happens, it’s 
completely natural for the brain to stick to 
negative thought patterns. The thought loops 
you’re experiencing are your brain’s natural 
way of processing trauma. There’s nothing 
wrong with you. I know it may be frustrating, 
but it’s not permanent. With the exercises we’ll 
be doing, we’re going to work on retraining 
your brain to get out of these negative thought 
patterns.

Miss M: I...Thank you, Doctor, but it just 

seems so hard to believe right now. 

Dr. A: And that’s OK. It’s OK for you to be 
hesitant to believe it, but even if you don’t 
believe it by now, the treatment will take its 
course. Your thoughts may be negative right 
now, but they will change. 

Miss M: Honestly, I’m willing to try 

anything. 

Dr. A: Let’s bring back that mental picture 

of the incident again. I want you to picture 
yourself on a train. Treat that memory as 
though it’s the scenery you’re watching from 
your window. It’s something you’re observing, 
not something you’re involved in. Like a movie. 
Just let it play out. [Pause] Now, when you 
think about it, what would you like to believe

help the therapist to identify three factors 
that will guide the remainder of the process: 
past events that created the problem, current 
situations that cause or exacerbate distress, 
and behaviors, coping mechanisms, and 
practices integral to future well-being.2

PHASE 2: PREPARATION

During Pase 2, the patient becomes 
acclimated to the treatment.5 First and 
foremost, it is imperative that the therapist 
create a safe space for the patient, making 
sure that the patient knows he or she is free 
to stop at any time.4 The therapist takes care 
to explain each step of the process and its 
purpose, allowing the patient to practice eye 
movements and other processes. Additionally, 
the therapist will teach the patient a number 
of relaxation practices that can be used by 
the patient when faced with an emotional 
disturbance.5 This might occur over the 
course of one or four sessions, depending on 
the patient’s needs and trauma levels. The 
overarching goal of this stage is to establish a 
foundation of trust between the therapist and 
the patient.5

the memory to them.

Then the patient is asked to vocalize a 
negative self-assessment or belief that is 
triggered by this memory (e.g.,  “I am weak 
and in danger.”).5 The patient will be asked 
to vocalize the emotions (e.g., fear, anger,  
insecurity) and physiological responses (se.g., 
sweating, shaking, clenched fists) that the 
patient experiences in conjunction with this 
negative self-statement. Following this, the 
patient is instructed to choose a positive self-
belief that is preferable, such as “I am strong 
and safe.” This positive statement should be 
rooted in truth and reflect what is happening 
in the present moment.5  

Finally, the patient is prompted by the 

therapist to rate how true the positive 
statement is to the patient in the moment 
using a Validity of Cognition (VOC) scale of 1 
(totally unbelievable) to 7 (totally believable).4 
The patient is also asked to rate the negative 
belief and its associated physio-emotional 
impact using the Subjective Units of 
Disturbance (SUD) scale, ranging from 1 (no 
disturbance) to 10 (worst disturbance) scale 
(Figure 2).4 

PHASE 3: ASSESSMENT

Phase 3 seeks to access the traumatic 
memories that are being targeted by EMDR.5 
It does not necessarily mean the patient will 
be required to relive or recall the memory in 
its entirety; rather, the patient may be asked 
to choose one evocative image that represents

(CONTINUED) 

During her second session, Miss M is able to 
vocalize her experiences during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Though it takes some time and she 
is coached through a series of self-relaxation 
exercises, she manages to articulate the events 

ICNS  INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE  July–September 2020 • Volume 17 • Number 7–9PSYCHOTHERAPY ROUNDSabout yourself, even if it’s not something you 
necessarily believe right now?  

Miss M: I...it feels heavy. It feels like a 9 on 

that SUD scale. 

Miss M: I...I don’t know. I guess I’d really like 

Dr. A: You’re doing great, Miss M. Keep 

to believe that I’m doing my best right now, 
and that my feelings are valid. That my desire 
to be happy and carefree is valid. But that 
just does not feel true. I let the circumstances 
around me kick my ass, and now I can’t get 
back on my own two feet. It’s pathetic. I’m… 
I failed.

Dr. A: Humor me for a moment, Miss M. 

Even if you don’t believe the phrase, “I’m 
doing my best, and my feelings are valid,” is 
it something you would like to truly believe 
about yourself, if you could? 

Miss M: I...I don’t deserve to believe my 

feelings are valid, Doctor. 

Dr. A: Close your eyes, Miss M. [Miss M. 
closes her eyes.] Now, I’d like for you to focus 
on your breathing. Good. Now, I’m going to 
ask you again—and I don’t want you to tell 
me how you judge your response. I just want 
you to tell me how you feel when I say the 
following sentence. [Pauses for a moment] 
“I’m doing my best, and my feelings are valid.” 
[Another pause] Now, regardless of whether 
you believe you deserve to or not, is that 
something that you would like to believe about 
yourself? 

Miss M: [Pause] Yeah. [Clears throat] Yeah, 
Doctor. I’d really like to be able to believe that. 
Dr. A: Good, Miss M. Thank you. Now, I’m 
going to say that statement again. I’d like you 
to rate it on the VOC scale according to how 
much you believe it. [Pause] “I’m doing my 
best, and my feelings are valid. 

Miss M: I...I have to give it a 1, Doctor. 
Dr. A: As you listen to that statement and 
assess it, what emotions do you feel? There are 
no wrong answers here. Just express yourself 
however feels most honest.

Miss M: I just feel so- so...ashamed, I 

guess. Yeah. I hear that and I feel such shame, 
because… well, I feel like I really do deserve 
to feel...the shame.

Dr. A: OK. Thank you, Miss M. You’re doing 

just fine. I want you to do something now: 
close your eyes and hone in on that feeling of 
shame. What is the SUD for that emotion? 
Miss M: It feels...heavy. Overwhelming. 
[Starts to breathe heavily.] Doctor, I don’t know 
if I can do this. This is so hard, I- I just feel so 
sad and helpless every time I think about it. 

breathing at the same pace- go with that. Keep 
letting yourself feel your emotion. Can you feel 
it somewhere in your body? Does it feel like it’s 
taking a physical root somewhere? 

Miss M: I- yeah. Yeah, I know exactly what 
you mean. I think about that statement, the 
positive one. And I just feel this...weight, 
this terrible heaviness - right here [points to 
sternum]. Like, right in the center of my chest, 
and the more I think about it, the more it 
radiates up, like a balloon, into my throat until 
I feel like I can’t speak.  

Dr. A: Thank you, Miss M. I know that was 
difficult, but you did very well. You focused on 
your breathing and let yourself sit with your 
emotion. This is a safe space. You are in control. 
If, at any moment, you’d like to stop, we will 
stop. All right? 

Miss M: Yes. Thank you. 

PHASE 4: DESENSITIZATION 

This phase of the process homes in on the 
patient’s negative self-perceptions and ensuing 
responses.4 This is the phase during which 
the therapist will lead the patient in a series 
of sounds, taps, or eye movements until the 
patient experiences either two positive or 
two neutral responses to their targeted event. 
Once two positive or neutral responses are 
experienced, the therapist will ask the patient 
to give the memory another SUD rating. This 
will be done for the targeted event, as well as 
for any other associated disturbances that may 
arise over the course of treatment.5

COMPOSITE CASE VIGNETTE 1 
(CONTINUED). 

At this point, the therapist begins the 
Desensitization Phase, asking the patient 
to think of the incident, the negative self-
assessment “I’m useless, and I can’t do anything 
about it”, and the body location. The patient 
is instructed to keep these in her mind while 
following your left-right hand movements with 
her eyes for a period of 30 seconds. 

Dr. A: [At the end of the eye movements].  
Okay, take a deep breath. Now, exhale and let 
it go. [Pause].  What do you notice now?
Miss M: I...I don’t know. I feel a little 

puzzled.

Dr. A: Go with that, Miss M

Dr. A: OK. Keep going with that. [Eye 

movements and silence.] Inhale - big, deep 
breath. Let it go. What do you feel now?”
[Note: The phrasing might be slightly 
different from this, and the therapist either 
keeps silent or provide minimal encouragement 
during the eye movements. This sequence 
repeats.22]

Miss M: My mom was just...weeping. Like 
I’ve never seen her before. And I didn’t even 
hug her. I just stood there, thinking about my 
grandma all alone without us and everything I 
lost in the last three weeks.

Dr. A:  [Eye movements and silence.] What 

about now? 

Miss M: I...I didn’t even want to hug 
my mom. Like, the thought didn’t register. 
[Through tears] It felt like something heavy 
and invisible was just sitting on my chest, and I 
couldn’t move.

Dr. A:  [Eye movements and silence.] “That’s 

it, just feel that.”

Miss M: My parents were there for me. They 

couldn’t give me money, but they welcomed 
me home after I got evicted. And I was feeling 
sorry for myself the whole time, and I couldn’t 
even comfort my mom when she lost her 
mother without being able to say goodbye. I 
could barely even feel sad myself, at first. Then 
it… then I felt sad all the time. Ugh, and I feel 
so guilty about all of it. 

Dr A: Miss M, now don’t stop following my 
movements with your eyes. Now, I want you to 
think back to the image you had in your mind 
at the beginning—of learning your grandma 
died. What SUD rating would you give it now? 
Miss M: I… I guess it doesn’t... paralyze me 

as much as it did when I first thought about. I 
mean, it still sucks. I still feel the weight of it, 
but...maybe a 2? 

Dr. A. Who determines the fate of an 

individual?

Miss M: I...I honestly don’t know.
Dr. A: But who doesn’t have a say?
Miss M: I know that I sure don’t.

A few sets of eye movements and responses 

follow, focusing on how it is not in Miss M’s 
power to prevent loved ones from dying, or to 
absorb others’ pain when tragedy occurs.

PHASE 5: INSTALLATION

During this phase, the emphasis is placed 

on the positive belief that the patient has 
already decided upon.5 Once the negative 

16

ICNS  INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE  July–September 2020 • Volume 17 • Number 7–9PSYCHOTHERAPY ROUNDSself-belief has been reprocessed as an illusion, 
this positive belief is reaffirmed as the truth. 
The positive cognition (i.e. “I am strong and 
safe”) is introduced and emphasized until the 
patient manages to rate it at a 7 on the VOC 
scale, indicating that they have accepted and 
internalized it as true.

COMPOSITE CASE VIGNETTE 1 
(CONTINUED) 

Miss M: It’s ridiculous. That something 
like that could just come out of nowhere and 
throw my life out of whack - and take the life 
of someone I loved. That there was nothing I 
could do to help anyone - not my loved ones, 
not myself. It wasn’t in my power.

Dr. A: It wasn’t in your power to prevent 
what happened. We cannot prevent tragedies 
from happening; all we can do is our best to 
take care of ourselves. [Eye movements and 
silence.]

Miss M:  I...I was doing my best to take care 
of myself. Even though I was numb. Day by day, 
I was getting up. Making breakfast. Looking for 
job posts. I was really trying to keep treading 
water, you know?

Dr. A: What would your grandmother tell 
you about how you’ve handled everything?
Miss M:  She...she would tell me to 
celebrate the small victories. She would say 
that I can’t control the bad things that happen, 
and that it’s OK to be upset when they do. She 
would say that I can control my ability to rise 
above. [Pause] She would say, “this too shall 
pass, but only if you let it.”

PHASE 6: BODY SCAN

Numerous studies have demonstrated 
that there is a strong correlation between 
unresolved negative thoughts and 
physiological responses.36,37 As a result, 
physical characteristics are monitored in order 
to help the therapist determine the extent to 
which a patient has successfully reprocessed 
their target event.

Once the installation stage has been 
completed, the patient is asked to think of 
the target event, and the therapist monitors 
them for physical signs of tension, distress, 
or discomfort.5 If any of these arise, they are 
specifically targeted for reprocessing through 
EMDR. This is done to ensure that the positive 
self-beliefs that were introduced have been 
adopted on both a physical and conceptual

Dr. A: OK, Miss M. Now I’d like you to think 
back to that first trigger memory, just like you 
did before. I’m going to give you a moment, 
and I’d like for you to just think about it. 

While Miss M. takes a moment to think 
about the trigger image, Dr. A. monitors her for 
physical signs of distress. After a minute, she 
speaks.

Dr. A: How do you feel, Miss M.?
Miss M: I miss my grandmother. I’ll always 

miss her. But...I don’t feel that disturbance, 
that weight when I think about her in the 
hospital.  

Dr. A: If you were to think about that phrase 
you articulated earlier - “I’m useless, and I can’t 
do anything about it” - do you feel that same 
heaviness in your chest? 

Miss M: I...I honestly can’t believe I’m 
saying this. But that pressure in my chest? It’s 
not there. Not even when I think about it. I… 
this is unreal, but...I really don’t feel it. 
Dr. A: And, how would you describe 

yourself, Miss M.? 

other obstacles during sessions that hinder 
their ability to reprocess a traumatic event. 
There are two types of closures: the first is 
a Completed Target Memory Session and 
the second is an Incomplete Target Memory 
Session.4 Incomplete sessions happen when 
a patient does not achieve two neutral or 
positive responses to the target event over 
the course of the session.5 In instances where 
this occurs, the therapist leads the patient 
through self-soothing relaxation exercises.3 
The therapist will also equip the patient with 
coping mechanisms and exercises that will 
help them feel in control outside of sessions. 
Patients are also given insights into what 
to expect between sessions, documenting 
these experiences, and how to remain calm in 
stressful or triggering situations in everyday 
life.4

feelings are valid. [Smiles.]

PHASE 7: CLOSURE

The purpose of every session is to leave 

the patient feeling better about their 
progress than they were before arriving 
at their appointment.5 This is particularly 
important when patients hit “roadblocks” or 

Miss M: Thank you, Doctor. Having these at 
my disposal feels really good. I just… I feel so 
grateful. To you, to my family members who 
have helped me through everything. Even to 
myself, for plucking up the courage to come 
and see you.

PHASE 8: RE-EVALUATION 

Every new session begins with re-evaluation, 

during which time the therapist reviews the 
client’s current emotional and psychological 
state, their responsiveness to treatment and 
self-relaxation techniques, and any memories or 
thoughts that have arisen since the last session.5 
The therapist works alongside the patient to 
determine what new techniques or treatments 
might be needed to address the issues they’re 
experiencing.

like to talk about after today’s session?

CONVENTIONAL PATIENTS WHO WOULD 
BENEFIT FROM EMDR

EMDR is particularly effective for individuals 
with PTSD, as demonstrated by a 2019 study of 
47 patients suffering from PTSD that found after 
EMDR (with a median of four EMDR sessions), 
40 percent of participants scored below the 
threshold required for a PTSD diagnosis.38 
Another study conducted in 2018, used two 
meta-analyses and four randomized-controlled 
trials to assess the effectiveness of EMDR. 
Its findings were that, regardless of patients’ 
cultural backgrounds, EMDR was more effective 
than other trauma treatments in improving 
PTSD diagnosis, reducing PTSD symptoms, and 
mitigating other trauma-related symptoms.39
Of 10 studies conducted on EMDR therapy, 
seven found it to be a faster and more effective 
treatment of PTSD than trauma-focused CBT.1 
Similarly, 24 randomized controlled trials report 
that EMDR therapy has a positive effect on 
the treatment of emotional trauma and other 
traumatic life experiences.1 12 randomized 
assessments of the eye movement component 

documented significant decreases in negative 
emotionality and vividness of troubling 
images during EMDR.1 Another analysis of 26 
randomized EMDR therapy trials for PTSD, all 
published between 1991 and 2013, found that 
EMDR has a significant impact on decreasing the 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.40 

SIMILAR TREATMENTS

Previous studies have focused on additional 

conventional therapies using memory 
reconstruction. Life review therapy is a memory 
reconstruction technique used in elderly and 
terminally ill patients where patients gradually 
evaluate their autobiographic memory and 
learn to come to terms with their past life. 
This technique leads to decreased depressive 
feelings and improves spiritual and psychosocial 
well-being.41 Decreased autobiographical 
memory recall is a common finding in patients 
with depression. Memory specificity training is a 
memory reconstruction technique that has been 
shown to improve recall of positive memories 
in patients who were depressed.42 Additionally, 
a technique called the multi-model memory 
restructuring (3MR) system has shown benefit in 
treating patients with PTSD. The 3MR system has 
patients create a timeline of their memories and 
use a diary to add visuals and text referencing 
the memories. A three-dimensional version of 
the memory is then created, and the patient is 
treated with an exposure approach.43 

OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF EMDR

The strong positive correlation between EMDR 

and the mitigation of PTSD symptoms signifies 
promising possibilities for other psychiatric 
conditions. In fact, initial evidence suggests 
that EMDR could be an effective measure to 
treat trauma-related symptoms among patients 
suffering from comorbid psychiatric disorders. 
There is also research indicating that EMDR could 
have positive results in treating trauma affective 
symptoms in patient with chronic pain, bipolar 
disorder, depression, substance use disorders, 
and intellectual disabilities.44

Bipolar Disorder. Though there are not 
many studies examining the impact of EMDR 
treatment on patients with bipolar disorder, 
EMDR has a strong positive impact on the 
amelioration of trauma affective symptoms, 
indicating that those struggling with bipolar 
disorder and PTSD might stand to benefit from 
EMDR methods.45 Specifically, EMDR has shown 

benefit in preventing relapse and treating 
trauma affective symptoms in patients with 
bipolar disorder as well as increasing treatment 
compliance and patient’s disease awareness.45
Depression and generalized anxiety 
disorder. In a study conducted by Wood et al, 
eight patients suffering from depression were 
exposed to EMDR. Of these, seven experienced 
clinically significant improvement on the 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression46 EMDR 
when combined with Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy (CBT) results in a lower number of 
remissions and additional benefit in patients 
with depression based on post-treatment Beck 
Depression Inventory II scores.47 Similarly, in 
patients with generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD), EMDR improved patients’ tolerance to 
uncertainty and allowed them to overcome 
their cognitive avoidance. Additionally, these 
factors continued to decline after one month of 
treatment.48 

Substance use disorders. In patients with 
substance use disorder, EMDR has the potential 
to create a safe environment for patients to 
access their emotions and shift their perspective 
to implement lifestyle changes.49 In a study 
exploring EMDR as an add-on treatment among 
patients with substance use disorders, those 
who received EMDR in addition to their usual 
treatment showed a significant improvement 
in PTSD and dissociation symptoms, as well as a 
reduction in general anxiety. Those who received 
their usual treatment without an EMDR add-on 
only experienced a clinically significant reduction 
in PTSD symptoms.50 

Intellectual disabilities. Success has also 

been shown in EMDR treating patients who 
are intellectually disabled and with a history of 
trauma.51 Karatzias et al conducted a study with 
29 adults with PTSD and intellectual disabilities 
and found that 60 percent of participants who 
received EMDR in addition to standard care were 
diagnosis-free at the end of treatment. At a 
three-month follow-up, 43 percent of patients 
were still diagnosis-free.52  

LIMITATIONS AND NEGATIVE SIDE-
EFFECTS OF EMDR

Though studies related to the efficacy of 
EMDR reveal promising results, they generally 
test small sample sizes of patients. EMDR is a 
relatively new phenomenon and, as such, still 
poses many questions regarding its long-term 
efficacy.

18

ICNS  INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE  July–September 2020 • Volume 17 • Number 7–9PSYCHOTHERAPY ROUNDS 
 
 
 
Some critiques of EMDR assert that it 
requires too many sessions in order to yield 
results, which could prove to become a 
financial obstacle for patients.53 Some authors 
posit that, just as eye movements and recall 
render negative memories less unpleasant, 
they could just as easily render positive 
memories less pleasant.53,54 

In addition, some ethical questions have 

arisen as a response to EMDR, related to 
whether it is ethically sound to experiment 
with patients’ re-exposure to their triggers and 
psychological traumas. Shapiro asserts that, if 
EMDR is not used appropriately, patients might 
be retraumatized or even left immobilized.7 
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of EMDR 
practitioners to adhere to the eight outlined 
steps of the process, mindfully adapting their 
practice to the needs of each patient. 

EMDR is effective for individuals with 
traumatic pasts by decreasing the associated 
distress associated with their disruptive 
memory.30 However, in a forensic setting, a 
witness’s statement could be disrupted due to 
their reconstructed memory.55 Additionally, 
many EMDR studies are measured by subjective 
measures and could be strengthened by 
including behavioral measures like improved 
sleep patterns and social validation procedures 
like ratings by significant others.56 The mean 
effect size for EMDR (d=.90) reported by 
Wilson et al is equal to the mean effect size 
reported in a meta-analysis conducted by Otto, 
Penava, Pollock, and Smoller57 of non-EMDR 
exposure treatments for PTSD.56 Individuals 
can be susceptible to false memories. A 
study conducted by Houben et al found that 
a majority of surveyed EMDR practitioners 
endorsed the idea of repressed memories.55 
Therefore, EMDR practitioners must be careful 
when suggesting the possibility of repressed 
memories particularly in those with vague 
memories.  

Some critics argue that EMDR contains many 

similarities to other forms of trauma-focused 
psychotherapy and exposure techniques.58,59  
These critics contend that the bilateral 
stimulation associated with EMDR is not an 
essential component, as Shapiro has asserted.8  
A meta-analysis conducted by Seidler and 
Wagner compared the efficacy of EMDR to 
trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy 
in the treatment of PTSD.60 This meta-analysis 
included seven studies and determined that 

neither form of treatment was found to be 
superior in efficacy. However, Lee and Cuijpers 
conducted another meta-analysis with 
15 clinical trials and compared traditional 
EMDR to EMDR without accompanying eye 
movements.61 The results of this meta-analysis 
indicate that the effect size for eye movements 
in a therapy context was moderate and 
significant. Although controversy related to 
the bilateral stimulation persists40 and more 
research is needed to elucidate its mechanism 
of action,62 EMDR remains an effective 
psychotherapy for PTSD.63 

CONCLUSION

EMDR is an effective method by which 
to mitigate PTSD symptoms, empowering 
individuals to redefine their relationship 
to their trauma and move forward with 
an improved quality of life. Other types of 
psychotherapy focus on directly altering the 
emotions, thoughts and reactions resulting 
from previous traumatic experiences, but EMDR 
therapy focuses directly on the memory. By 
changing the way that the memory is stored 
in the brain, the emotions associated with the 
memory become less intense throughout the 
course of the therapy. Since EMDR is still in its 
early stages of study and implementation, it 
is imperative that more studies be conducted 
with large sample sizes and other psychiatric 
conditions.
