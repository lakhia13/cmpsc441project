CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE

The Diagnosis and Treatment  
of Bipolar Disorder

Recommendations From the Current S3 Guideline

Andrea Pfennig, Tom Bschor, Peter Falkai, Michael Bauer

SUMMARY
Background: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness, characterized by 
 frequent recurrences and major comorbidities. Its consequences can include 
 suicide. 

Methods: An S3 guideline for the treatment of bipolar disorder was developed 
on the basis of a systematic literature search, evaluation of the retrieved publi-
cations, and a formal consensus-finding procedure. Several thousand publi-
cations were screened, and 611 were included in the analysis, including 145 
randomized controlled trials (RCT).

Results: Bipolar disorder should be diagnosed as early as possible. The most 
extensive evidence is available for pharmacological monotherapy; there is little 
evidence for combination therapy, which is nonetheless commonly given. The 
appropriate treatment may include long-term maintenance treatment, if indi-
cated. The treatment of mania should begin with one of the recommended 
mood stabilizers or antipsychotic drugs; the number needed to treat (NNT) is 3 
to 13 for three weeks of treatment with lithium or atypical antipsychotic drugs. 
The treatment of bipolar depression should begin with quetiapine (NNT = 5 to 7 
for eight weeks of treatment), unless the patient is already under mood-stabil-
izing treatment that can be optimized. Further options in the treatment of bipo-
lar depression are the recommended mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotic 
drugs, and antidepressants. For maintenance treatment, lithium should be used 
preferentially (NNT = 14 for 12 months of treatment and 3 for 24 months of 
treatment), although other mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotic drugs can 
be given as well. Psychotherapy (in addition to any pharmacological treatment) 
is recommended with the main goals of long-term stabilization, prevention of 
new episodes, and management of suicidality. In view of the current mental 
health care situation in Germany and the findings of studies from other coun-
tries, it is clear that there is a need for prompt access to need-based, complex 
and multimodal care structures. Patients and their families need to be ad-
equately informed and should participate in psychiatric decision-making. 

Conclusion: Better patient care is needed to improve the course of the disease, 
resulting in better psychosocial function. There is a need for further high-
quality clinical trials on topics relevant to routine clinical practice.

B ipolar  disorder  is  a  severe  psychiatric  disease 

with a lifetime prevalence of 3% (1), character-
ized by frequent recurrences and considerable psychi-
atric and somatic comorbidity. Suicidality is common, 
and  the  disease  has  substantial  consequences  both  for 
the individual and for health care spending (Figure 1).

The  project  to  create  the  first  German-language 
 evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for the diag-
nosis and treatment of bipolar disorders was initiated in 
2007  by  the  German  Society  for  Bipolar  Disorder 
(Deutsche Gesellschaft für Bipolare Störungen, DGBS) 
and the German Association for Psychiatry and Psycho-
therapy  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  für  Psychiatrie,  Psy-
chotherapie  und  Nervenheilkunde,  DGPPN),  with  the 
intention  of  providing  decision-making  support  for 
 patients,  their  families,  and  therapists. Assistance  was 
provided by the Association of Scientific Medical So-
der 
cieties 
 Wissenschaftlichen  Medizinischen  Fachgesellschaften, 
AWMF; www.awmf.org). The guideline was developed 
without  any  funding  from  manufacturers  of  pharma-
ceuticals or medical devices.

in  Germany 

Here we give a brief account of the development and 
essential  content  of  the  guideline.  The  full  version  of 
the guideline (2) is available (in German) at www.leitli
nie-bipolar.de.

Methods
A project group, a steering group, six different working 
groups  and  the  consensus  conference  all  participated 
actively  in  the  guideline  process  (Table  1).  The  ex-
tended review procedure also involved a review group 
and an expert panel. The participants are listed in full in 
the eSupplement.

Figure 2 outlines the guideline development process, 
and  an  overview  of  the  literature  search,  showing  the 
number of publications included and excluded, is given 
in  Figure  3.  Several  thousand  publications  found  in 
MEDLINE,  EMBASE,  PsycINFO,  CINAHL,  and  the 
Cochrane Library were screened, and 611 publications 
on the following topics were selected for inclusion:

● Treatment of mania
● Treatment of bipolar depression
● Randomized controlled trials (RCT; n = 145) on 

maintenance treatment.

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2013; 110(6): 92−100

All relevant studies identified (primarily randomized 
clinical trials referring to patients with bipolar disorder, 
or  presenting  separate  results  for  this  patient  group) 
were  critically  assessed.  The  end  points  regarded  as 
particularly relevant were: psychopathology or severity 
of symptoms; dropouts overall; dropouts owing to ad-
verse effects; important adverse effects; and quality of 
life.  Each  of  the  six  working  groups  included  both 
 hospital-based  psychiatrists  and  psychotherapists,  and 
psychiatrists and psychotherapists working outside the 
hospital  setting,  as  well  as  representatives  of  patients 
and  their  families.  Over  the  course  of  ten  consensus 
conferences,  232  recommendations  and  statements 
were discussed and approved in a nominal group pro-
cess involving representatives of 13 scientific medical 
societies,  professional  associations  and  other  organi -
zations together with five experts. The grades of recom-
mendation  assigned  in  the  S3  Guideline  are  listed  in 
Box 1.

Some  of  the  statements  and  recommendations  are 
given here in summarized and abridged form and thus 
deviate from the original wording.

Detailed  description  and  discussion  of  the  methods 

can be found in (2–4).

Diagnosis and documentation of disease 
course
Accurate diagnosis is the key to adequate treatment and 
best possible maintenance of the patient’s occupational 
and social function. ICD-10 demands identification of 
at  least  two  clearly  distinct  affective  episodes.  The 
validity  of  the  diagnosis  thus  increases  as  the  disease 
progresses.

Affective  episodes  can  be  characterized  by  manic, 
hypomanic, depressive, or mixed syndromes (Table 2).
In addition to classifying the disease, the diagnostic 
process  should  have  a  dimensional  aspect  describing 
the severity of the symptoms. Validated instruments are 
available  for  both  self-assessment  and  external  evalu-
ation of mania and depression (see the full version of 
the guideline). These instruments should preferably be 
applied more than once (recommendation grade: state-
ment).

One complicating factor in the diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder is that the disease often begins with episodes 
of depression; hypomanic symptoms are not perceived 
as bothersome. However, differentiation from unipolar 
depression  has  considerable  practical 
importance. 
The  following  risk  factors  and  predictors  may  assist 
differential  diagnosis  (recommendation  grade:  state-
ment):

● Positive family history of bipolar disorder
● Severe  melancholic  or  psychotic  depression  in 

childhood or adolescence

● Rapid onset or swift regression of depression
● Seasonal or atypical disease characteristics
● Subsyndromal  hypomanic  symptoms 

in 

the 

course of depressive episodes

● Development of (hypo)manic symptoms on expo-
sure to antidepressants or psychostimulants.

Screening instruments for bipolar disorder over the 
course  of  the  patient’s  life  to  date  (e.g.,  the  Mood 
 Disorders Questionnaire [5]) are advisable particularly 
in persons at high risk (such as patients with previous 
episodes  of  depression,  suicide  attempts,  substance 
abuse,  or  temperamental  anomalies).  If  screening 
yields a positive result, a psychiatrist should be brought 
in  to  ensure  the  diagnosis  (recommendation  grade: 
clinical consensus point [CCP]).

Valid diagnosis of a bipolar disorder requires careful 

exclusion of differential diagnoses (Table 3).

Bipolar  disorders  are  very  often  accompanied  by 
other psychiatric disorders. The most frequent of these 
are anxiety and compulsive disorders, substance abuse 
and dependence, impulse control disorders, eating dis-
orders, 
disorder 
/ADHD), and personality disorders (6).

deficit/hyperactivity 

attention 

Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit increased mor-
bidity  and  mortality.  Apart  from  suicide,  this  is  pre-
dominantly  attributable  to  cardiovascular  disease  and 
type  2  diabetes  (7,  8).  The  somatic  diseases  with  the 
greatest epidemiological significance are cardiovascu-
lar disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus, 
together  with  musculoskeletal  disorders  and  migraine 
(9).  Both  psychiatric  and  somatic  comorbidity  should 
be  carefully  diagnosed  at  the  outset  and  during  the 
course  of  the  bipolar  disease,  and  the  findings  should 
be taken into account when deciding on treatment (rec-
ommendation grade: CCP).

The individual course of bipolar disorder should be 
documented, with particular reference to the attainment 
of defined treatment goals. This can be achieved with 
the assistance of established external evaluation instru-
ments or by the patient keeping an ideally daily record 
of his/her moods (recommendation grade: CCP).

Treatment
The ultimate goal of treatment is to achieve as high as 
possible  a  level  of  psychosocial  function  and  health-
 related quality of life.

When planning the acute treatment of an episode of 
bipolar  disease,  the  possible  need  to  ward  off  recur-
rence  must  be  borne  in  mind.  Figure  4  provides  an 
overview of the components of treatment.

With regard to pharmacotherapy, details on mecha -
nisms of action, indications, contraindications, dosing, 
interaction profiles, and potential short- and long-term 
adverse  affects  are  given  in  the  full  version  of  the 
guideline. The recommendations in the full version al-
ways  include  reference  to  limitations  on  the  use  of  a 
given substance, e.g., major adverse effects, interaction 
potential, or lack of official approval for the indication 
concerned.  The  pharmacotherapeutic  combination 
treatments that are often used and even recommended 
in practice are unfortunately based on scant evidence.

A robust and enduring therapeutic relationship is im-
portant to the success of acute treatment and prevention 
(recommendation  grade:  statement).  Simple  psycho-
education should be the minimal aim of every medical, 
psychological, or psychosocial treatment (recommendation

grade:  statement).  Supportive  therapeutic  measures 
(such as relaxation and movement therapy, ergotherapy, 
art therapy, and music/dance therapy) should form part 
of the individual integrated treatment plan (recommen-
dation grade: CCP).

Assessment of existing international guidelines (DELBI*1)

Treatment of mania
The  foundation  for  the  treatment  of  mania—before 
pharmacotherapy—is  provided  by  the  professional 
formation of a relationship and the creation of a thera-
peutically  favorable  environment.  Pharmacotherapy 
then  often  has  a  central  role,  and  the  evidence  is 
relatively  extensive. Briefly, in the  absence of contra -
indications 
treatment  should  comprise 
 monotherapy  with  one  of  the  recommended  mood 
 stabilizers (lithium, carbamazepine,  valproate),  one  of 
the recommended atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, 
olanzapine,  quetiapine,  risperidone,  ziprasidone),  or 
haloperidol  (in  emergencies  and  for  short-term  treat-
ment) (recommendation grade: B).

initial 

the 

The effect sizes (numbers needed to treat, NNT) for 
lithium and the atypical agents for 3 weeks lay between 
3  and  13  for  a  response  greater  than  that  found  for 
placebo;  the  NNT  for  remission  were  comparable. 
 Asenapine  or  paliperidone  can  also  be  used  (recom-
mendation grade: 0). Benzodiazepines can be added for 
a  strictly  limited  period  of  time  (recommendation 
grade: 0). In the event of inadequate response, combi-
nations of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics 
are 
recommended.  Accompanying  psychotherapy 
 focuses  on  maintaining  contact;  behavioral-type 
 interventions  may  be  helpful  in  milder  episodes  (rec-
ommendation grade: 0).

In severe cases additional electroconvulsive therapy 

(ECT) can be carried out (recommendation grade: 0).

Treatment of bipolar depression
A problem in the treatment of bipolar depression is that 
in  clinical  practice,  treatment  strategies  are  often 
 carried  over  from  the  extensive  evidence  for  unipolar 
depression.  Depression-specific  pharmacotherapy  is 
only  exceptionally  indicated  in  mild  depressive  epi-
sodes,  which  are  usually  handled  with  psychoedu-
cation,  psychotherapeutic  interventions  in  the  strict 
sense,  advice  on  self-management,  and  self-help 
groups  (recommendation  grade:  CCP).  The  dose  and 
serum  level  of  any  existing  preventive  pharmaco -
therapy  should  be  optimized.  If  such  medication  for 
long-term maintenance treatment is not yet in place but 
on consideration seems indicated, it should be initiated 
immediately, during the acute depressive episode (rec-
ommendation  grade:  CCP).  Depression-specific  phar-
macotherapy  is  a  strong  option  for  the  treatment  of  a 
moderately  severe  depressive  episode  (recommen-
dation  grade:  statement).  A  severe  episode  should  be 
treated  pharmacotherapeutically 
(recommendation 
grade: CCP).

In summary, monotherapy with quetiapine should be 
started  unless  there  are  contraindications  (recommen-
dation  grade:  B).  The  NNT  for  8  weeks  lay  between

5 and 7 for a response greater than that found for placebo; 
again,  the  NNT  for  remission  were  comparable.  The 
mood  stabilizers  carbamazepine  and  lamotrigine,  as 
well as olanzapine, can be prescribed, or alternatively 
selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRI)  or 
 bupropion  (recommendation  grade:  0).  The  patient 
should  also  receive  psychotherapy  (family-focused 
therapy [FFT], cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], or 
interpersonal and social rhythm therapy [IPSRT] and/or 
sleep  deprivation  treatment  (not  in  mixed  episodes!) 
(recommendation  grade:  B);  light  therapy  can  also  be 
offered (recommendation grade: 0).

During  the  first  4  weeks  of  pharmacological  treat-
ment, patient and physician should meet at least once a 
week so that risks and side effects can be recognized, 
the success of the treatment measures evaluated, and the 
cooperation  between  physician  and  patient  improved. 
Thereafter,  the  period  between  appointments  can  be 
 increased to 2–4 weeks; after 3 months it can perhaps be 
extended further (recommendation grade: CCP).

After 3 to 4 weeks the effect of the treatment should 
be  carefully  assessed.  Depending  on  the  result,  the 
treatment strategy should be changed, adjusted, or left 
unaltered (recommendation grade: CCP).

ECT  can  be  considered  particularly  in  cases  of 
 treatment resistance and severe or even life-threatening 
situations.

Long-term maintenance treatment
Ideally,  long-term  maintenance  treatment  leads  to 
 complete freedom from depressive, manic, and mixed 
episodes, minimal if any interepisodic symptoms, and 

96 

therapy 

incorporating 

unimpaired enjoyment of life. In some cases, however, 
only  secondary  treatment  goals  are  achieved  (e.g., 
fewer,  shorter,  and/or  less  severe  episodes  or  milder 
 interepisodic  symptoms).  Partial  successes  may  be 
overlooked because of the long duration of treatment. If 
the  strategy  for  long-term  maintenance  treatment  is 
completely unsuccessful, it will probably be decided to 
try a different approach; in the case of partial success, 
combination 
the  previous 
 treatment is more likely (recommendation grade: state-
ment).  The  disease  course  should  be  systematically 
documented.  The  best  indicator  of  how  long  a  main -
tenance  treatment  strategy  should  be  pursued  before 
 deciding on its continuation or modification is the indi-
vidual  disease  course.  Clinical  experience  shows  that 
the efficacy of a strategy can be assessed after a time 
corresponding  to  twice  the  patient’s  average  disease 
cycle.  As  a  rule,  a  long-term  maintenance  treatment 
strategy  should  not  be  modified  in  the  event  of 
 recurrence within 6 months of its commencement (rec-
ommendation grade: CCP).

is  usually  an 

Pharmacotherapy 

indispensable 
 component of long-term maintenance treatment; in this 
regard,  long  clinical  experience  stands  in  contrast  to 
considerable deficits in the scientific evidence. Single-
agent  maintenance  treatment  should  be  the  goal.  In 
brief, monotherapy with lithium is recommended in the 
absence  of  contraindications  (recommendation  grade: 
A). The NNT for 12 months was 14 for an additionally 
prevented  episode  compared  to  placebo,  and  for  24 
months it was 3. If lithium is contraindicated, lamotri-
gine should be prescribed (recommendation grade: B). 
The mood stabilizers carbamazepine or valproate or the 
atypical  antipsychotics  aripiprazole,  olanzapine,  or 
 risperidone  can  be  recommended  as  well  (recommen-
dation  grade:  0).  It  must  be  noted  that—apart  from 
 lithium—the  indication  is  restricted,  e.g.,  to  patients 
who tolerate the substance well in the acute phase and 
have  responded  adequately,  or  to  prevention  of  only 
one pole of the disease.

In  the  case  of  inadequate  response,  compliance, 
dose, and serum level (if established) must be checked, 
and the dose or target serum level can be increased (if 
possible). If the response is still inadequate, pharmaco-
logical  combination  treatments  are  frequently  used 
 despite  the  paucity  of  evidence  from  controlled  trials. 
In summary, combinations of a mood stabilizer and an 
atypical  antipsychotic  or  combinations  of  two  mood 
stabilizers  can  be  given  (recommendation  grade:  0). 
The  goal  of  the  (accompanying)  psychotherapy  is  to 
maintain  the  improvement  or  remission  and  prevent 
new episodes of illness. As a rule the treatment begins 
after resolution of an acute episode. Contact is initially 
weekly (two or more times a week in times of crisis), 
and  treatment  continues  for  several  months  or  years. 
Extensive,  interactive  psychoeducation  should  be  of-
fered (recommendation grade: B); CBT, FFT, or IPSRT 
can also take place (recommendation grade: 0).

Clinical  experience  shows  that  creative  and  action-
oriented  measures  (e.g.,  ergotherapy,  art  therapy,  and

Possible components of treatment for bipolar disorder;
TCA, tricyclic antidepressants; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; SSNRI, selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors; 
MAOI, monoamine oxidase inhibitors; rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; VNS, vagus nerve stimulation

music/dance therapy) contribute to the mental and so-
cial  stabilization  of  bipolar  patients.  Relaxation  tech-
niques  (e.g.,  progressive  muscle  relaxation)  help  pa-
tients  to  achieve  stability  by  relieving  specific  symp-
toms  (e.g.,  tension  or  sleep  disorders).  For  none  of 
these auxiliary forms of therapy, however, are there em-
pirical studies of sufficient quality specifically focused 
on bipolar disorder.

Suicidality is common in bipolar disorder (the life-
time prevalence of suicide is 15%). For this reason, sui-
cidal ideation and behavior must be clinically assessed 
at  every  patient  contact;  this  may  require  precise,  de-
tailed questioning, and self-competence, social attach-
ment, and earlier suicidality should be evaluated (rec-
ommendation grade: CCP). Suicidal patients require a 
greater  commitment  in  terms  of  time  and  intensified 
therapeutic attachment (recommendation grade: CCP). 
In patients at risk of suicide, a robust therapeutic rela-
tionship  may  prevent  suicide  per  se  (recommendation 
grade:  CCP).  For  long-term  maintenance  treatment  in 
bipolar  patients  at  risk  of  suicide,  lithium  should  be 
considered  for  reduction  of  suicidal  behavior  (at-
tempted  suicide  and  suicide)  (recommendation  grade: 
A). Antidepressants  (recommendation  grade:  B),  anti-
psychotics, valproate, and lamotrigine are not suitable 
for  acute treatment of the target syndrome suicidality. 
Psychotherapy  focusing  initially  on  suicidality  should 
be considered.

For the treatment of specific groups of patients and 
advice on how to proceed in special situations, see (2) 
(in German). These specific treatment groups are:

● Women  of  childbearing  age,  pregnant  or  breast-

feeding women
● Elderly patients
● Patients with frequent psychiatric and/or somatic 

comorbidity

● Treatment-resistant patients, including those with 
rapid cycling (a special form of the disease with at 
least four episodes of changing polarity within a 
12-month period).

Trialogue, knowledge transfer, and self-help
The trialogue is particularly important for open, trust-
ing,  and  successful  cooperation  between  patients, 
family  members,  and  mental  health  professionals 
three 
 (recommendation  grade:  statement).  These 
 parties’ involvement in a participatory decision-making 
process should go beyond legally obligatory provision 
of information to include discussion of and joint deci-
sions on treatment strategies, their desired effects, and 
the potential risks (recommendation grade: CCP).

Appropriate information transfer is known to have a 
positive  influence  on  willingness  to  cooperate,  adher-
ence  to  treatment,  self-confidence,  and  quality  of  life 
(recommendation grade: statement). Patients and their 
relatives  should  thus  be  informed  about  handbooks, 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2013; 110(6): 92−100

self-help  manuals,  training  programs  (e.g.,  communi-
cation  training,  self-management  training),  advice  in 
the  literature,  and  any  relevant  upcoming  events  (rec-
ommendation  grade:  CCP)  and  encouraged  to  attend 
self-help groups. Direct integration of such groups into 
inpatient care or continuing cooperation with regional 
groups or contacts is advisable. This helps to stabilize 
the successful outcome of treatment (recommendation 
grade: CCP).

For further details and discussion see (2, 10).

Patient care and the care system
The  developers  of  the  guideline  take  the  view  that 
 improvements in the reality of patient care have great 
potential  for  bringing  about  a  more  favorable  disease 
course  and  better  psychosocial  functionality. The  par-
ties  with  the  most  influence  on  the  form  that  patient 
care  takes  are  the  patients  themselves,  their  relatives, 
and the medical and nonmedical therapists and carers. 
In many regions primary care physicians are indispens-
able  for  the  basic  care  of  bipolar  affective  patients. 
 Cooperation  between  primary  care  physicians  and 
 psychiatrists has proved valuable in rural areas (recom-
mendation grade: CCP).

Despite methodological difficulties in the evaluation 
of  evidence  from  complex  health  service  research 
studies  and  in  the  transferability  of  data  from  other 
health care systems, there is broad agreement on how a 
good  support  system  should  look.  Based  on  the  find-
ings of the studies by Simon et al. (11) and Bauer et al. 
(12, 13) and in view of the current health care system, 
access  to  and  availability  of  the  following  is  required 
(recommendation grade: statement):

● Prompt  qualified,  disorder-specific  psychiatric 

treatment

● Psychoeducation and psychotherapy
● Reliable help; if needed, by outreach programs 
● Crisis  intervention  treatment  (inpatient  ward  or 

psychiatric day care unit)

● Rehabilitation  facilities  with  disorder-specific 

 services

● Disorder-specific self-help groups.
The goal must be to overcome the fragmented organ-
ization and financing of the psychiatric care system in 
Germany.  Cross-sector  care  and  financing  models 
should be developed to cater for the needs of persons 
with  severe  psychiatric  diseases,  including  bipolar 
 affective  patients  (recommendation  grade:  CCP);  see 
(2, 14).

Prospect
For the treatment of bipolar disorder, the existing evi-
dence base requires consolidation through high-quality 
clinical studies on topics relevant to daily practice, e.g., 
treatment  of  bipolar  depression,  combination  treat-
ments, and specific health care strategies.

A follow-up survey of patients’ and relatives’ experi-
ence of care in Germany is planned, and comparison of 
the  results  with  those  of  the  first  survey  in  2010  (15) 
will reveal any differences following publication of the 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2013; 110(6): 92−100 

guideline. The  full  version  of  the  guideline,  complete 
with details such as discussion of its limitations, can be 
found (in German) at www.leitlinie-bipolar.de.
