SHORT REPORT

Evaluation of Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy Training for 
Psychologists Working with People  
with Multiple Sclerosis

Kenneth I. Pakenham, PhD; Theresa Scott, PhD; Michele Messmer Uccelli, MA, MSCS

Background:  Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  is  the  most  widely  used  and  researched  recent 
variant of cognitive behavioral therapy and has been shown to increase quality of life in people with chronic 
illnesses, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, few MS health practitioners are trained in ACT. This 
study evaluated a 2-day ACT training workshop for Italian psychologists working with people with MS. 

Methods: Data were collected via online questionnaires from 34 psychologists before the workshop, after 
the  workshop,  and  at  6-month  follow-up.  Two  sets  of  variables  were  measured  at  each  assessment:  pri-
mary outcomes (well-being, negative affect, positive affect, and job satisfaction) and ACT processes (values, 
mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and cognitive defusion). A separate online workshop evaluation ques-
tionnaire and an ACT knowledge examination were administered after the workshop.

Results:  Most  participants  (94%)  acknowledged  the  potential  beneficial  effects  of  the  workshop  on  their 
work. Almost all participants reported their intention to apply ACT clinically. More than 90% of partici-
pants indicated that the workshop was efficacious. All participants scored higher than 75% on the exami-
nation. Mindfulness increased from after the workshop to follow-up; however, there were no statistically 
significant changes in other variables. Correlations suggested beneficial associations between the ACT pro-
cesses and the primary outcomes.

Conclusions: Results suggest that ACT training is personally and professionally helpful for psychologists in 
the MS field. Int J MS Care. 2018;20:44-48.

Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)1 

is the most widely used and researched recent 
variant  of  the  well-established  cognitive 
behavioral  therapy.  ACT  is  based  on  mindfulness  and 
acceptance  processes  and  on  relational  frame  theory.1,2 
ACT  targets  experiential  avoidance,  which  refers  to 
intentional efforts to avoid private events experienced as 
aversive.2 ACT aims to increase psychological flexibility, 
which  involves  behaving  consistently  with  one’s  chosen

values  even  in  the  presence  of  intrusive  internal  experi-
ences  (eg,  unwanted  thoughts  and  feelings).1  ACT  uses 
six  interrelated  processes  to  cultivate  psychological  flex-
ibility: 1) acceptance—openness to experience; 2) cogni-
tive  defusion—observing  thoughts  rather  than  taking 
them  literally;  3)  present  moment  awareness  (mindful-
ness)—open and responsive awareness of the present; 4) 
self-as-context—flexible  self-awareness  and  perspective 
taking;  5)  values—freely  chosen,  personally  meaningful 
life directions; and 6) committed action—values-guided 
effective  action.1  Consistent  with  the  ACT  framework, 
these  processes  are  related  to  better  mental  and  physi-
cal  health.2  Regarding  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  greater 
acceptance and mindfulness are related to better adjust-
ment in patients and their caregivers.3,4

ACT  interventions  can  enhance  quality  of  life  and 
physical  health  and  can  decrease  anxiety  and  depression 
in  people  with  various  chronic  illnesses,  including  MS.5-8 
ACT  incorporates  mindfulness,  which  can  improve 
quality  of  life  and  mental  health  in  people  with  MS.9 
Importantly, ACT is a transdiagnostic treatment model 
that can provide relief for multiple life difficulties rather 
than for a particular disorder.

ACT  training  can  also  improve  well-being,  self-care, 
and  psychological  flexibility  in  health  practitioners.10,11 
These ACT training benefits are particularly relevant to 
psychologists given that they are at risk for burnout and 
that  self-care  and  psychological  flexibility  can  protect 
against burnout.12 ACT training typically involves expe-
riential exercises whereby trainees experience each of the 
ACT processes and acquire the skills for enhancing these 
in  their  own  lives,  which,  in  turn,  positions  them  for 
teaching these processes to clients.12,13

Owing to ACT being relatively new, few health pro-
fessionals serving people with MS are trained in it. The 
purpose  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  an  ACT  training 
workshop for psychologists who work with people with 
MS in Italy. It was expected that participants attending 
the ACT training workshop would show improvements 
after  the  workshop  in  personal  outcomes  (well-being, 
positive  and  negative  affect,  and  job  satisfaction)  and 
in  the  ACT  processes  (mindfulness,  psychological  flex-
ibility, cognitive fusion, and values). Consistent with the 
ACT  framework,  it  was  predicted  that  higher  levels  of 
mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and values and less 
cognitive fusion would be associated with better personal 
outcomes (higher well-being, positive affect, and job sat-
isfaction and lower negative affect).

Methods

Overview

Data  were  collected  at  three  time  points:  before 
the  workshop,  after  the  workshop,  and  at  6-month 
follow-up.  The  study  received  ethical  approval 
from  the  Regional  Ethics  Committee,  Liguria,  Italy 
(PR240REG2015).  Participants  were  informed  about 
the  study  at  workshop  registration,  and  informed  con-
sent was obtained from all the participants.

Measures

An  online  questionnaire  obtained  demographic 
information  and  contained  measures  of  the  primary 
outcomes and ACT processes. All the primary outcomes 
and  ACT  processes  were  measured  at  the  three  time 

ACT Training for Psychologists Working in MS

points,  demographic  information  was  obtained  before 
the  workshop,  a  separate  online  workshop  evaluation 
questionnaire was administered after the workshop, and 
a  paper  examination  was  completed  immediately  after 
the workshop. Well-established, psychometrically sound, 
Italian-validated measures of the primary outcomes and 
ACT processes were used as follows.

Primary Outcomes

The  primary  outcomes  were  well-being  (Mental 
Health  Continuum–Short  Form),14  positive  and  nega-
tive affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule),15 and 
job  satisfaction  (a  single  item,  “I  am  satisfied  with  my 
current  job,”  rated  on  a  5-point  scale  from  1  =  totally 
disagree to 5 = totally agree).16

ACT Processes

The  ACT  processes  were  psychological  flexibility 
(Acceptance  and  Action  Questionnaire–II),17  mindful-
ness  (Mindful  Attention  Awareness  Scale),18  and  values 
(Valued Living Questionnaire)19; the inverse of the ACT 
process of cognitive defusion was measured by the Cog-
nitive Fusion Questionnaire.20

Workshop Evaluation Questionnaire

Forced-choice questions asked about previous experi-
ence using ACT, intentions to use ACT, and workshop 
satisfaction. An open-ended question elicited suggestions 
regarding workshop changes.

ACT Knowledge Examination

A  paper  examination  with  42  multiple-choice  ques-

tions was administered at the end of the workshop.

ACT Workshop

The  2-day  workshop  was  offered  in  response  to 
requests  from  psychologists  collected  from  the  Italian 
MS  Society’s  annual  professional  development  survey 
and was delivered by one author (K.I.P.) on July 7 and 
8, 2015, in Genoa, Italy. The workshop was a modified 
version  of  a  university  ACT  training  course  for  trainee 
clinical  psychologists  developed  and  evaluated  by  the 
same  author.21  The  workshop  was  delivered  in  English 
and translated into Italian by two translators with expe-
rience  in  medical  and  related  fields.  Topics  included 
an  introduction  to  ACT,  illustrative  ACT-based  inter-
ventions  for  people  with  MS,  and  the  six  ACT  pro-
cesses.  The  workshop  concluded  with  a  demonstration 
role-play  with  a  participant  playing  the  role  of  a  client 
with  MS.  Experiential  exercises  and  self-practice  of  the 
ACT  processes  were  emphasized.  Resources  included

role-plays,  discussion,  and  audio-visuals.  The  applica-
tion  of  ACT  strategies  in  an  MS  clinical  context  was 
highlighted.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Participants  were  34  psychologists  (31  women  and 
three  men)  working  with  clients  with  MS  and  their 
families who are part of a program promoted by the Ital-
ian  MS  Society  that  provides  professional  development 
activity  in  MS.  All  but  one  participant  completed  the 
study  assessments.  The  mean  (SD)  age  of  participants 
was  41.82  (8.29)  years  (range,  30-60  years).  The  mean 
(SD)  number  of  years  of  professional  work  experience 
was 12.50 (7.03) years (range, 3-30 years). All the par-
ticipants had at least 1 year of experience working with 
people with MS; 60%, 5 years’ experience; and 37.5%, 
at least 7 years’ experience. All but two participants indi-
cated that their main psychology specialization was some 
form of psychotherapy; two participants indicated devel-
opmental and education and neuropsychology. No par-
ticipant  indicated  ACT  as  their  primary  psychotherapy 
approach. Most participants (69.4%) reported no previ-
ous  experience  with  ACT.  Most  participants  (77.8%) 
reported that they did not use ACT in their work.

Workshop Evaluation

Most  participants  reported  that  the  educational 
impact  of  the  workshop  was  “optimal”  (50.0%)  or 
“good”  (41.7%),  with  8.3%  indicating  “sufficient.” 
Most  participants  indicated  that  the  impact  of  the 
workshop  on  their  MS  work  was  “optimal”  (41.2%) 
or  “good”  (52.9%),  with  2.9%  indicating  “sufficient” 
and only one person indicating “very little.” The overall 
efficacy of the training was rated as “optimal” by 69.4% 
and  as  “good”  by  27.8%,  with  one  person  indicating 
“sufficient.”  Most  participants  (94.1%)  reported  that 
they would apply ACT in their MS work.

Only  eight  participants  provided  suggestions  for 
modifying  the  workshop.  Three  clear  themes  emerged 
from  their  responses:  timing  (more  time  for  practi-
cal  work,  viewing  of  videos,  breaks,  and  discussion), 
structure (using small groups, a range of presenters, and 
translators  who  have  ACT  knowledge),  and  content 
changes (more MS case examples).

above  the  minimum  required  (75%)  by  the  regulatory 
body to receive continuing education credits.

Changes in Primary Outcomes and ACT 
Processes

Wilcoxon  signed  rank  tests  of  significance  examined 
changes in the primary outcomes and ACT processes over 
time (Table 1). None of the primary outcomes changed 
statistically  significantly  over  the  three  assessments.  Of 
the ACT processes, only mindfulness changed statistically 
significantly.  As  expected,  mindfulness  increased  signifi-
cantly from after the workshop (mean, 4.12) to follow-up 
(mean, 4.27) (z score = –1.99, P < .05).

Correlations Between ACT Processes and 
Primary Outcomes

Correlations  between  the  ACT  processes  and  the 
primary  outcomes  are  summarized  in  Table  2.  As  pre-
dicted, higher psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and 
values and less cognitive fusion were significantly associ-
ated with greater well-being and positive affect and lower 
negative affect across most time points. Greater mindful-
ness and less cognitive fusion were significantly related to 
better job satisfaction at follow-up. Although some ACT 
processes  were  either  unrelated  or  only  weakly  related 
to  the  primary  outcomes  before  the  workshop,  most 
ACT  variables  were  statistically  significantly  associated 
with  the  primary  outcomes  at  follow-up.  Most  correla-
tions  between  the  ACT  processes  and  well-being  and 
negative and positive affect were statistically significant, 
with  the  mean  correlation  coefficient  for  each  outcome 
being  moderately  high  and  the  ACT  processes  sharing 
22% to 31% of the variance in these outcomes; correla-

Discussion

Most  participants  rated  the  workshop  positively  and 
acknowledged  the  beneficial  effects  that  the  workshop 
was  likely  to  have  on  their  work.  All  the  participants 
reported  their  intention  to  apply  ACT  clinically,  and 
most  indicated  that  the  workshop  was  efficacious.  All 
the  participants  demonstrated  adequate  mastery  of 
workshop  content  given  that  they  achieved  well  above 
the minimum examination score required by the regula-
tory  body  to  receive  continuing  education  credits.  The 
increases  in  mindfulness  suggest  personal  training  ben-
efits. Mindfulness actually increased after the workshop 
to follow-up, rather than from before to after the work-
shop, probably because of greater opportunities to prac-
tice mindfulness skills during the longer follow-up inter-
val.  The  trend  toward  stronger  beneficial  associations 
between the personal outcomes and the ACT processes 
after the workshop point to the potential for other train-
ing  benefits  that  should  be  explored  in  future  research. 
These findings are noteworthy given that the ACT pro-
cesses are associated with greater well-being and self-care 
in  health  practitioners  and  that  greater  mindfulness  is 
associated  with  better  personal  and  client  outcomes  in 
health professionals.12

Several  methodological  limitations  may  explain  the 
lack  of  statistically  significant  change  in  primary  out-
comes  and  ACT  processes.  First,  the  small  sample  size 
limited  power  to  detect  statistically  significant  change; 
prevention  research  typically  requires  large  samples 

to  detect  change.  Second,  given  that  the  sample  con-
sisted of psychologists, the lack of statistically significant 
changes  may  have  been  due  to  baseline  ceiling  effects; 
however, only job satisfaction and values evidenced ceil-
ing  effects.  Third,  the  brevity  of  the  workshop  is  likely 
to have limited the acquisition of ACT strategies, given 
data suggesting that longer ACT training workshops are 
more effective.13,21 Other limitations include the inabil-
ity  to  match  examination  scores  and  workshop  evalua-
tion  data  with  the  primary  outcome  and  ACT  process 
data, thereby limiting explorative analyses on issues such 
as  whether  those  who  had  previous  ACT  knowledge 
improved  more  than  those  without  such  knowledge. 
Finally, participants were not asked at the 6-month fol-
low-up whether they had used ACT in their MS work.

The  potential  benefits  of  the  workshop  were  further 
supported  by  numerous  written  anecdotal  reports  from 
participants.  The  workshop  also  prompted  one  partici-
pant to be awarded a funded fellowship to obtain train-
ing  in  an  ACT-based  resilience  intervention  for  people 

PRACTICE POINTS

• Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  is 
a  new  variant  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy 
and  is  associated  with  quality-of-life  benefits  for 
people with MS.

• Preliminary  evaluative  data  on  an  ACT  training 
workshop for psychologists shows promising pro-
fessional and personal benefits.

• Training  health  practitioners  in  ACT  is  likely  to 
increase possibilities for developing new innova-
tive psychological strategies for people with MS.

with MS and to translate it into Italian.5,22 Although few 
participants  suggested  changes  to  the  workshop,  several 
timing,  structural,  and  content  changes  may  improve 
training  outcomes.  These  preliminary  yet  promising 
findings have warranted the development of future ACT 
training  evaluation  projects  for  MS  psychologists  in 
Italy.  Training  health  practitioners  in  ACT  is  likely  to 
encourage the development of innovative contemporary 
psychological  interventions  for  people  with  MS,  as  has 
occurred in other chronic illness areas.8 o
