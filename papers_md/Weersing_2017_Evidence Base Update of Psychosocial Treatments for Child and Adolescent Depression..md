Abstract

Depression in youth is prevalent and disabling and tends to presage a chronic and recurrent course 
of illness and impairment in adulthood. Clinical trial research in youth depression has a 30 year 
history, and evidence-based treatment reviews appeared in 1998 and 2008. The current review of 
42 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) updates these reviews to include RCTs published between 
2008 and 2014 (N = 14) and re-evaluates previously reviewed literature. Given the growing 
maturity of the field, this review utilized a stringent set of methodological criteria for trial 
inclusion, most notable for excluding trials based in sub-clinical samples of youth that had been 
included in previous reviews (N = 12) and including well-designed RCTs with null and negative 
findings (N = 8). Findings from the current review suggest that evidence for child treatments is 
notably weaker than for adolescent interventions, with no child treatments achieving well-
established status and the evidentiary basis of treatments downgraded from previous reports. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for clinically depressed children appears to be possibly 
efficacious, with mixed findings across trials. For depressed adolescents, both CBT and 
Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) are well-established interventions, with evidence of efficacy in 
multiple trials by independent investigative teams. This positive conclusion is tempered by the 
small size of the IPT literature (N = 6) and concern that CBT effects may be attenuated in 
clinically complicated samples and when compared against active control conditions. In 
conclusion, data on predictors, moderators, and mediators are examined and priorities for future 
research discussed.

Worldwide, depression is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions and is the third 
leading cause of disability, surpassed only by diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections, 
in global burden of disease (Smith, 2014). Depression is associated with impaired family, 
peer, and romantic relationships, lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status, 
and increased risk of early mortality from suicide (Hammen, Brennan, & Keenan-Miller, 
2008; Weissman et al., 1999). Despite these lifespan sequelae, depression can rightly be 
considered a disorder of youth. Most adults with depressive illness recall their first episode 
as occurring in the teenage years, and prospective studies of youth suggest that first onset 
may be typical in early adolescence (Lewinsohn, Clarke, Seeley, & Rohde, 1994;

Merikangas et al., 2003). Prior to adolescence, rates of depressive disorders are substantially 
lower (Bufferd, Dougherty, Carlson, Rose, & Klein, 2012; Harrington, 2002); with the onset 
of puberty, prevalence of disorder doubles, and a significant gender imbalance emerges that 
persists until late adulthood (Merikangas, Nakamura, & Kessler, 2009). Furthermore, 
adolescent onset confers an especially high risk for chronic recurrence and poor functioning 
throughout the lifespan (Avenevoli, Knight, Kessler, & Merikangas, 2008; Zisook et al., 
2007). Taken together, these characteristics of depressive illness make clear the need for 
early, effective intervention to treat depression in youth.

Treatment research in youth depression dates back to the late 1980s (e.g., Reynolds & Coats, 
1986), as adult measures of depression symptoms were developmentally adapted to 
accurately assess and verify the existence of clinically-impairing disorders in children and 
adolescents (e.g., Kovacs, 1981). Early randomized trials in youth depression treatment 
relied heavily upon these self-reports of symptoms (a) to define samples of high-symptom 
youth in need of intervention and (b) as the primary method of outcome assessment. 
Diagnostic assessment, use of multiple reporters, blinded independent ratings, and measures 
of clinically significant change and remission entered the youth treatment literature over 
time, with “conventional” clinical trial designs not appearing until late 1990s (e.g., Brent et 
al., 1997). The treatments tested in these studies also represent developmental adaptations of 
adult depression treatment models, drawing primarily from cognitive and behavioral therapy 
techniques (CBT; Beck, 1967, 1976; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Lewinsohn, 1974; 
Lewinsohn, Hoberman, Teri, & Hautzinger, 1985) and, more recently, the strategies of 
Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT; Weissman, Markowitz, & Klerman, 2000, 2007) for 
depression.

The first evidence-based treatment (EBT) review in the area of youth depression was 
published by Kaslow and Thompson as part of the original 1998 special series in the Journal 
of Clinical Child Psychology. At that time, 14 studies were identified that focused on the 
treatment of symptoms of depression in children and adolescents and met basic 
methodological criteria. Of these, the vast majority focused on behavioral or cognitive-
behavioral interventions. One non-randomized, open trial probed the promise of 
Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A; Mufson et al., 1994) with depression, 
and one randomized trial of CBT for adolescent depression included family therapy and 
supportive therapy as control arms (Brent et al., 1997). Across this literature, the authors 
concluded that interventions for depressed youths generally outperformed control conditions 
(typically waitlists) and that effects did not seem to vary by group versus individual modality 
or by the involvement of parents in treatment. In evaluating the evidence for treatments, the 
authors focused in on specific manualized protocols (e.g., Adolescent Coping with 
Depression [CWD-A]; Lewinsohn, Clarke, Hops, & Andrews, 1990), rather than assessing 
the value of broader theoretical orientations (e.g., CBT). With this perspective, they 
determined that no treatments met criteria for well-established interventions and two 
treatment programs were probably efficacious (Self Control Therapy, Stark, Reynolds, & 
Kaslow, 1987; Adolescent Coping with Depression, Lewinsohn et al., 1990).

The youth depression literature was reviewed again in 2008 by David-Ferdon and Kaslow, 
and, in the intervening decade, 28 additional trials had been published (10 in child samples

and 18 with depressed adolescents). As in the 1998 review, the vast majority of studies 
tested the effects of CBT, although randomized trials of IPT also entered the literature. 
Methodological differences became increasingly apparent between RCTs in child versus 
adolescent samples. Studies of adolescents were far more likely to include diagnostic 
evaluations (12 studies) and recruit from help-seeking, clinical populations, rather than 
screening children in school for high symptoms. Adolescent studies were also more likely to 
be of higher overall quality, with 10 of 18 being coded as “Type 1” -- the highest level of 
methodological sophistication according to their review criteria (see Nathan & Gorman, 
2002). In contrast, none of the child studies passed this threshold due to a range of design 
flaws (e.g., small sample size, problems with randomization, unclear inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, lack of standardized assessment). The authors organized their EBT evaluation at the 
level of the specific program, and then moved outward from this level of analysis to evaluate 
the evidence in support of broader modalities and theoretical orientations. When adopting 
this broader perspective, they concluded that CBT as an overall theoretical approach was 
well-established, with child group and child + parent group being well-established 
modalities within CBT. Looking across trials, sufficient evidence also existed to classify 
child behavior therapy as probably efficacious as a stand-alone (not CBT package) 
intervention (Kahn, Kehle, Jenson, & Clark, 1990; King & Kirschenbaum, 1990; Stark et al., 
1987). Other orientations and modalities had been tested in youth at the time of the 2008 
review, but data were not available to identify any other treatments as more than 
experimental in nature, even when evidence was summed across trials. David-Ferdon and 
Kaslow (2008) further concluded that the adolescent literature also supported the 
designation of CBT as a well-established theoretical approach, with 14 valid studies 
indicating support for CBT across variations in demographic (e.g., Rosselló & Bernal, 1999) 
and clinical (e.g., with substantial comorbidity; Rohde, Clarke, Mace, Jorgensen, & Seeley, 
2004) characteristics, across stringent comparisons (e.g., compared to alternate treatment; 
Brent et al., 1997), and by multiple independent investigative teams. IPT, too, reached the 
level of well-established, with a strong, though smaller, evidence base of four randomized 
trials by two independent investigative teams testing three specific IPT programs (IPT-A, 
Mufson, Weissman, Moreau, & Garfinkel, 1999; Mufson, et al., 2004; IPT-AST, Young, 
Mufson, & Davies, 2006a; culturally-adapted IPT, Rosselló & Bernal, 1999).

The growing evidence-base for psychosocial interventions for youth depression, as 
documented in these EBT reviews, has unfolded against a backdrop of more troubling trends 
in the depression treatment literature. Several meta-analyses on depression treatment effects 
have been published in this same time frame, and these analyses have documented a 
substantial decline in effect sizes over time. Initially, effect sizes for the treatment of 
adolescent depression were amongst the largest in the literature (Reinecke, Ryan, & DuBois, 
1998; Lewinsohn & Clarke, 1999), but more recent analyses of youth depression (Weisz, 
McCarty, & Valeri, 2006) and adult depression (Johnson & Friborg, 2015) treatments have 
suggested effects may be quite modest and among the least impressive for evidence-based 
interventions for psychological disorders (Weisz et al., in press). In youths, this dramatic 
difference in the size of effects may be due in part to the growing maturity of the depression 
literature, with more recent studies including active control conditions (e.g., supportive 
therapy; Brent et al., 1997) and more clinically complicated samples (e.g., treatment of

depression and comorbid conduct disorder; Rohde et al., 2004) than in early reports. These 
hypotheses dovetail with findings from the largest adolescent depression trial to date, the 
Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS, 2004). The TADS trial targeted 
adolescents with persistent and impairing major depression and compared CBT as a stand-
alone intervention to antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), the combination of CBT and 
medication, and a placebo sugar pill. Contrary to investigator hypotheses, in this sample 
(clinically severe) and with this design (placebo control), stand-alone CBT fared very poorly, 
failing to separate from placebo in many analyses and posting a response rate substantially 
lower than previous CBT trials. Unique characteristics of the TADS treatment manual and 
design may have contributed to this poor showing for CBT (see Weersing, Rozenman, & 
Gonzalez, 2009), and combination treatment performed very well, providing some 
conceptual support for the value of psychosocial intervention. However, the TADS results 
provided a shock to the field. Interestingly, the literature on antidepressant medications in 
youth has followed a similar trajectory of promise and concern, with recent re-analyses 
undercutting the clinical value and safety profile of agents (Le Noury et al., 2015), meta-
analyses highlighting the poorer response to medication in more clinically severe samples, 
and indications that the size of treatment effects may be significantly impacted by 
methodological factors (e.g., number of study sites, response rates in control conditions; 
Bridge et al., 2007). Taken together, these findings suggest growing uncertainty on whether 
intervention effects for depression are truly reliable and if our treatments are effective in 
samples of clinically-impaired, depressed youth.

In this context, in the current review, we sought to provide a comprehensive EBT update for 
psychosocial treatments for child and adolescent depression, paying close attention to the 
clinical severity of samples, the strength of control conditions, and patterns of null and 
negative findings in addition to positive effects. Our specific aims were threefold; first, we 
aimed to provide a detailed review of published trials since the last EBT report in 2008, in 
order to deliver a snapshot of current findings in youth depression research. Second, we re-
evaluated the entire youth depression treatment literature, including studies from previous 
reviews, to weigh the cumulative evidence for different approaches and revise the status of 
treatments using updated methodological criteria and standards for evidence. As with both 
previous reviews, we considered treatment for depressed children and adolescents separately, 
and we included studies of youths with clinically elevated symptoms of depression, even if 
these studies were classified as prevention (versus treatment) by the original authors. In our 
analysis, we assessed the cumulative evidence for broader treatment approaches, rather than 
evaluating the effects of each specific brand-name program manual within every orientation. 
This perspective viewed specific manualized programs as operationalizations of broader 
theoretical systems (for rationale, see Southam-Gerow & Prinstein, 2014). Third, we 
commented on notable findings in the youth depression field in terms of predictors, 
moderators, and mediators of effects. This final commentary was designed to be a spur for 
further research and treatment development.

METHOD

Inclusion criteria and search process

Page 5

Our review was guided by the methods described by Southam-Gerow and Prinstein (2014) 
for the current special series of Evidence-Based Updates. Table 1 summarizes these criteria 
and notes three ways in which the current review criteria deviate. Namely, (a) we did not 
screen out low sample studies but instead highlighted in text times when small samples may 
have influenced results, and we utilized small sample correction for effect sizes calculated 
for the review of new studies (M.5); (b) we required all studies to be randomized, thus 
eliminating options 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2; and (c) more broadly, we considered the balance of 
evidence between positive and negative studies when mixed findings were present in the 
literature (e.g., positive results in one good experiment would not necessarily outweigh a 
pattern of mixed findings). Treatment quality was critically evaluated to assign one of the 
following designations: a well-established treatment, or Level 1 treatment, is one that has 
been shown to be superior to a placebo or another active treatment condition by at least two 
independent research teams. A Level 2 treatment, or probably efficacious treatment, is one 
that has been shown to be superior to a waitlist control group or active condition in at least 
two trials, but may lack independent replication by different research teams. A possibly 
efficacious treatment, or Level 3 treatment, is one that has been shown to be superior to a 
control group in at least one RCT. Given our requirement that all included studies have a 
randomized design, a Level 4 treatment, or experimental treatment, would be unlikely to 
occur as a function of positive effects hampered solely by a weaker design. Rather 
experimental interventions in our pool would be those with a equivocal record of support 
across RCTs (some positive but also a large number of negative or null findings). Last, 
treatments of questionable efficacy, or Level 5, are those that have not been shown to have 
any beneficial effect, when tested in a reasonable RCT design. Note that our classification of 
treatments is focused on immediate post-intervention outcomes. The durability of effects 
over follow-up is commented on separately at the end of the Status of Treatments section.

Included in the scope of this review are randomized controlled trials (RCT) of psychosocial 
treatments for depression in children and adolescents. Trials testing medication alone were 
excluded from this review; however, studies testing combination psychosocial-
pharmacotherapy treatments were included. A literature search was conducted to identify (a) 
new treatment trials published since the 2008 EBT review (January 2007 – December 2014) 
and (b) secondary analyses from included trial reports (e.g., re-analyses to test mediation or 
moderation). Search terms were taken from the 2008 EBT review to maintain a consistent 
literature pool. The search terms were separated into (a) subject and (b) treatment categories 
that were then searched in combination in the PsycINFO and PubMed databases: (a) 
adolescent depression, teen depression, bereaved youth, suicidal youth; (b) depression 
intervention, depression treatment (David-Ferdon & Kaslow, 2008). In addition, authors who 
previously had published randomized or open trials for youth depression were searched by 
name in the PubMed database (Asarnow, Bernal, Brent, Chu, Clarke, Curry, Ehrenreich-
May, Fristad, Lejuez, March, McCauley, Mufson, Richardson, Rohde, Rosselló, Shirk, 
Stark, Stice, Weisz, Young) to identify new RCTs and follow-up reports to their prior work.

The initial search process produced 4332 abstracts (3941 from search terms, 391 from 
author searches). These abstracts were screened by two authors (KTGS and CB) to delete 
duplicates and to confirm appropriate age range (mean age less than 18; M.3) and explicit 
use of a randomized design with at least two groups (M.1). Studies were then triaged with 
the full authorship team to confirm adequate measurement of depression for enrollment (M.
3) and as an outcome (M.4). For inclusion in this review, all youths in each study sample 
were required to evidence “clinically significant depression” defined as either (a) meeting 
diagnostic criteria for a unipolar mood disorder (Major Depressive Disorder [MDD] and/or 
Dysthymia) with a standardized diagnostic assessment procedure (e.g., the Kiddie-Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia [K-SADS], Kaufman et al., 1997), (b) being 
identified by a mental health provider as suffering from significant and impairing depressive 
symptoms (as in Rosselló, Bernal, & Rivera-Medina, 2008), and/or (c) demonstrating 
clinically elevated levels of depression symptoms according to a standardized youth 
depression symptom measure. Studies varied considerably on this last criterion, with 
investigators using a variety of symptom tools and a variety of cut-points to select high-
symptom samples. Given that the purpose of the current review was to evaluate the treatment 
effects of depression interventions (versus preventive effects), we defined a minimum 
clinically significant cut-point for all such measures used in our pool of studies. Our cutoff 
definitions were based on psychometric reports and published manuals for the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI ≥ 20; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), Children’s Depression 
Rating Scale (CDRS-R ≥ 40; Poznanski & Mokros, 1996), Children’s Depression Inventory 
(CDI ≥ 13; Kovacs, 1992), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D ≥ 
16; Rudolph & Lambert, 2007), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D ≥ 8; Cusin, 
Yang, Yeung, & Fava, 2009), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ ≥ 23; Wood, Kroll, 
Harrington, & Moore, 1995), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 ≥ 10; Kroenke, Spitzer, 
& Williams, 2001), and Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS ≥ 77; Reynolds, 
1987). For these measures, we strove to identify a comparable level of clinical severity; of 
course, the various assessment tools differed in their original design (e.g., screening versus 
diagnosis), format (e.g., youth-report versus clinician-rated), and typical populations and 
normative samples used for comparison (e.g., clinical populations versus primary care 
patients). As a result, the level of “clinically significant depression” from sample-to-sample 
in the included studies may differ in part due to variability in the tools used to define the 
sample. Throughout our report, we highlight when samples are particularly mild or severe or 
mild. Inclusion criterion for clinically significant depression was not met if the mean of a 
high-symptom subgroup was in the elevated range of a screening measure or the highest 
symptom youths in a study sample were selected (e.g., top 20%) without evidence that all 
such youths were above these minimum clinical cut-off scores. Studies in which a subset of 
the sample had elevated depressive symptoms (e.g., universal prevention trials) were 
included, only if the results were segregated such that efficacy of the intervention solely 
among youths with clinically elevated symptoms could be determined. At post-treatment or 
follow-up, studies were required to include measurement of depression at least at the 
symptom level (M.4; i.e., youths could be included on the basis of diagnostic criteria but 
were not required to have diagnostic outcome assessed at post-treatment or follow-up if 
depression symptoms were assessed by self-report). This process yielded a total of 14 novel 
RCTs.

In addition, we re-reviewed the literature included in the 1998 and 2008 EBT reports to 
apply these new criteria. As a result, a total of 18 studies that had been included in prior 
reviews were excluded from consideration in the current report. Table 2 identifies each of 
these excluded papers and the reasons for removal from the youth depression treatment 
evidence base. The most substantive reason for removal was our exclusion of studies 
targeting youths with subsyndromal levels of depression symptoms. Some of these 
investigations were described as treatment studies (e.g., Weisz et al., 1997), whereas others 
were explicitly focused on prevention and aimed to select youths with mild symptoms but 
who were not yet exhibiting disorder (e.g., Gillham, Hamilton, et al., 2006). This latter 
category also included prevention trials that enrolled youth at-risk for depression due to a 
variety of factors (e.g., family conflict; Jaycox et al., 1994), without evidence that all youths 
in the sample evidenced clinically elevated symptoms. Finally, our review process also 
identified eight studies published prior to 2008 that met inclusion criteria for the current 
report but had been excluded previously. These eight trials demonstrated null or negative 
findings for intervention at post-treatment; previous EBT definitions emphasized 
accumulation of positive findings and, thus, these studies were excluded from prior 
consideration. The 2008 EBT report included six of these eight investigations in the 
descriptive review of studies and in the outcome tables; they were merely excluded from 
consideration when categorizing the evidentiary status of treatments (e.g., as well-
established; Clarke, Debar, et al., 2005; Clarke, Hornbrook, et al., 2002; De Cuyper et al., 
2004; Goodyer et al., 2007; Liddle & Spence, 1990; Sanford et al., 2006). We do not re-
review these six trials in detail here but do consider their results when evaluating the 
summary status of treatment in the current report. However, two trials (Vostanis, Feehan, 
Grattan, & Bickerton, 1996a; Kerfoot, Harrington, Harrington, Rogers, & Verduyn, 2004) 
were omitted entirely from prior descriptive review and, for completeness, are included in 
the current report as if they were new trials published within our window. Citations for all 
primary outcome studies included in the current review are indicated in the reference list 
with an asterisk (*).

Study classification and coding

For review purposes, studies involving children below the age of 13 were considered “child 
studies”, while adolescents were defined as being between the ages of 13 and 24, with a 
mean age of less than 18 years. Studies including both children and adolescents were 
categorized by the mean age of the participants, with samples with mean ages greater than or 
equal to 13 categorized as adolescent trials. Treatments were categorized as CBT, behavior 
therapy, or IPT by the authors’ labeling of the intervention and the description of 
intervention components. In addition, a small number of trials included family-based 
interventions. This treatment category was quite varied, ranging from systemic and 
behavioral family therapy models (e.g., as in Brent et al., 1997) to family psychoeducation 
(Sanford et al., 2006). Our grouping of studies within this category was modeled on Hogue 
and colleagues’ (2015) EBT review of substance abuse treatments and emphasized the 
working with multiple family members in all or nearly all sessions as well as a focus on 
intrafamilial relationships and processes as mechanisms of change. Interventions that 
included supplemental sessions with parents that focused on coordinating or supporting 
treatment efforts focused on the child or adolescent (rather than family processes) were not

included in this category (e.g., Clarke, Rohde, Lewinsohn, Hops, & Seeley, 1999). 
Treatments were further classified by modality, including individual, group, technology-
assisted (both video and computer assisted), and bibliotherapy. Studies were not screened 
out on the basis of sample size, and the smallest sample in the included literature pool 
enrolled 10 participants per cell. The randomized trials published after the last review were 
then integrated with those cited in David-Ferdon and Kaslow’s review (2008) to create a 
complete, updated literature of psychosocial treatments for youth depression.

To supplement our narrative review of new trials, we populated Tables 3 and 4 with 
summary information on study design and results, including measures of effect size. Effect 
sizes for the primary dimensional outcome measure of each trial were calculated using 
Hedges g (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) to correct for small sample sizes and were based on the 
unadjusted means and standard deviations provided by each primary outcome paper (using 
Biostat Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.0). In the table, we also report response 
rates for each treatment and control group; if multiple response rates were given by an 
investigation, we chose the most common metric across studies (i.e., clinical response versus 
clinical remission). The exact definition of response used for each trial can be found in the 
tables. To provide a metric of clinically significant change, we calculated number-needed-to-
treat (NNT) from these response rates, rounding to whole patients, using 0.5 as the dividing 
point. The NNT is a metric common in evidence-based medicine that captures the number of 
treated patients needed, on average, to see a benefit of treatment relative to control (see 
Guyatt & Rennie [2004], p. 358–360, for discussion and definition of NNT). For comparison 
purposes, the NNT for antidepressants in adolescent depression has been estimated to be 10 
(Bridge et al., 2007), indicating that for every ten adolescents receiving antidepressants, we 
would expect one case to have achieved remission as a function of receiving the active 
intervention (versus due to natural remission or other such factors). When available, NNT 
and Hedges g were derived from the intent to treat sample. If multiple papers were published 
on the same root study, effect sizes were only calculated from the primary depression 
outcome data, ensuring that the effect size reflected the published and accepted data at the 
post-treatment time point. Note that while Hedges g and the NNT are standardized metrics 
designed to facilitate the comparison of results across studies, the magnitude of these effect 
sizes should be interpreted within the context of each study design. For example, a small g 
or high NNT may still be impressive in a study with an active control group (versus effect 
sizes calculated against a waitlist) or when calculated on a more clinically meaningful 
outcome (e.g., interviewer rated measures versus self-reports for g; remission versus 
response rates for the NNT). Our evaluation of the evidentiary status of treatments, thus, is 
informed by these descriptive metrics but also weighs other factors, such as the strength of 
study design and independent replication of effects.

In the following sections, we provide a (a) detailed update of the psychosocial treatment 
literature published since the last EBT review, (b) evaluation of the evidentiary status of 
treatments, (c) commentary on the durability of effects of interventions over follow-up, and 
(d) review of predictor, moderator, and mediator findings drawn from the pool of included 
RCTs. We conclude with a discussion of the results of the review and priorities of future 
research in child and adolescent depression treatment.

UPDATE OF THE PSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENT LITERATURE

Treatment research in youth depression (2008–2014)

Within the psychosocial treatment literature for youth depression, 14 new trials have been 
published since the last review (see Tables 3 and 4). The vast majority of trials (13 of 14) 
focused on adolescent samples, with one trial including both children and adolescents 
(Weisz et al., 2009). Several studies included populations historically underrepresented in 
the treatment literature, such as racial or ethnic minorities (Diamond et al., 2010; Rosselló et 
al., 2008; Weisz et al., 2009; Young, Mufson, & Gallop, 2010). The majority of new trials 
were conceived by authors as treatment trials (8) with a number of indicated prevention trials 
(6) occurring as well.

The majority of trials tested the effects of CBT (12); two trials tested the effects of IPT, one 
of which was a head-to-head comparison between CBT and IPT (Rosselló et al., 2008), two 
trials focused on family therapy. Modality varied by the severity of the sample. The majority 
of treatment (versus indicated prevention) trials were delivered in individual format (6 of 8). 
One additional treatment trial compared the efficacy of group and individual formats 
(Rosselló et al., 2008). In contrast, indicated prevention programs were usually delivered in 
a group format or a classroom setting (5 of 6 trials).

We next review these 14 new trials, grouped by developmental level (child, adolescent), 
treatment type (CBT, IPT, family-based), and treatment modality (individual, group, 
technology-assisted, bibliotherapy). As discussed previously, we also review two studies 
published prior to 2008 (Vostanis et al., 1996a; Kerfoot et al., 2006) that were omitted from 
detailed analysis in previous EBT reviews but met inclusion criteria for the current report 
(results of these trials are also included in Tables 3 and 4).

Review of Clinical Trials in Children

Individual CBT in children—Weisz and colleagues (2009) conducted an effectiveness 
trial of a CBT-based program in a predominantly child sample (M = 11.8 years). Primary 
and Secondary Control Enhancement Training (PASCET) is a structured protocol that 
focuses on teaching children how to improve depressed mood by changing objective 
conditions in their environment (primary control) and changing themselves to buffer 
environmental stressors (secondary control; see Table 3). The PASCET program had 
previously been found to be effective as a group-based CBT intervention for schoolchildren 
with depressive symptoms in a pilot study included in the 2008 review (Weisz, Thurber, 
Sweeney, Proffitt, & LeGagnoux, 1997).1 The 2009 trial utilized a revised version of the 
PASCET manual, consisting of 10 core individual sessions and 5 optional additional 
sessions, with the flexibility of going beyond these 15 sessions as needed. Weisz et al. tested 
the transportability of this protocol among a sample of community therapists by 
randomizing them to one of two conditions: 1) brief training on PASCET in conjunction 
with supervision, or 2) usual care (UC). Therapists treated a sample (N = 57) of diverse 
youths (67% racial minority) who met criteria for a DSM-IV depressive diagnosis, many of 

1Note that this initial efficacy trial was excluded from the current review of Status of Treatments, given the CDI cutoff for sample 
inclusion was 11 (below the CDI clinical cutoff of 13).

whom had multiple comorbid diagnoses. In this context, the percentage of youths who no 
longer met criteria for a depressive disorder post-treatment did not significantly differ 
between groups following intervention (see Table 3; NNT = −25); however, the time to 
response was significantly shorter for youths receiving PASCET (24 weeks) as compared to 
youths receiving UC (39 weeks).

In addition to this new trial, one study of individual CBT with children excluded from the 
prior review met inclusion criteria for our purposes. Vostanis et al. (1996a) examined the 
effect of a brief (9 session) cognitive behavioral treatment administered in a clinic setting. 
Sessions were designed to be administered biweekly; however, frequency of sessions was 
flexible, allowing a maximum of 6 months for delivery of all 9 sessions. The effect of brief 
CBT was compared with non-directive supportive therapy (NST) in which clinicians met 
with the child to review current problems and social activities, without providing 
interpretations or suggestions. Youths ages 8 to 17 (M = 12.7 years, N = 57) meeting criteria 
for a depressive disorder were recruited from outpatient clinic settings. High rates of 
recovery from depressive disorder were noted at post-treatment among youths randomized to 
receive CBT (87%) and NST (75%) with no significant difference between groups (NNT = 
8). High rates of response across groups were maintained at 9-month and 2-year follow-up. 
Given the high rates of response in both groups at post-treatment and over follow-up (see 
Table 3), the authors also suggested that non-specific therapeutic elements may have been 
important for both groups. Alternately, the length of the intervention window (6 months) 
introduces the possibility of natural remission of depressive episodes in both groups, a 
possibility enhanced by the low number of sessions attended (an average of 6 sessions 
[range 2–9] were attended over an average of 3.5 months [range 1–5]).

Review of Clinical Trials in Adolescents

Individual CBT in adolescents—Five new clinical trials were published testing the 
effects of individual CBT for adolescents. Additionally, we review one trial of individual 
CBT omitted from past reviews that met criteria for inclusion in this report.

Szigethy and colleagues (2014) examined the efficacy of the PASCET program in 
adolescents with depression and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Participants in this 
study were 217 youths ranging in age from 9 to 17 years (M = 14.3 years) with IBD, in 
addition to a diagnosed depressive disorder (see Table 4). Participants were randomized to 
receive 12 weeks of either CBT (PASCET-PI) or NST. PASCET-PI consisted of 9 modules 
that targeted depressive symptoms, particularly as they occur in the context of IBD (e.g., 
relaxation skills also were taught to help manage pain). At post-treatment, participants in 
both conditions had lower depression symptom scores as compared to baseline, but did not 
significantly differ from each other (NNT = 16). Similarly, rates of treatment response and 
remission did not significantly differ by condition.

Brent et al. (2008) examined the efficacy of adjunctive CBT in a sample of treatment-
resistant, depressed adolescents who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of a selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; age 12–18; N = 334). Adolescents were randomized to 
one of four conditions: switch to Venlafaxine, switch to another SSRI, switch to Venlafaxine 
and CBT, or switch to another SSRI and CBT. Significant differences were not detected

between switch to SSRI or Venlafaxine and, subsequently, cells were collapsed to (a) 
medication switch alone and (b) medication switch with CBT. Youths randomized to 
medication switch with CBT had significantly greater improvements and higher response 
(54.8%) compared to youths randomized to medication switch alone (40.5%; NNT = 7). 
Though the absolute response rate was slightly lower than typical for CBT for adolescent 
depression (see Table 4 for comparison), given the severity of depression in the sample, it is 
broadly consistent with the literature. Differences between combination therapy and 
medication switch alone diminished over time, with no significant difference in rate of 
remission at 3, 9, or 15 months post-treatment (Emslie et al., 2010; Vitiello et al., 2011).

Richardson et al. (2014) examined the effect of a collaborative care intervention for 
depressed adolescents (age 13–17; M = 15.3 years) based in primary care. Study inclusion 
criteria required youths to either (a) meet diagnostic criteria for MDD (60%), or (b) have 
elevated symptom scores at two time points. Eligible youth (N = 101) were randomized to 
either a collaborative care intervention with depression care managers or to UC. For teens in 
the collaborative care arm, the depression care manager conducted an initial engagement 
session in which the adolescent chose between brief CBT, medication, or combination 
treatments. Teen progress in collaborative care was monitored; youths who experienced less 
than a 50% reduction in symptoms at mid-treatment were given the option of changing or 
augmenting treatment (adding medication, increasing dose, changing medications, or 
receiving CBT). Overall, the majority of collaborative care youths elected to receive 
combination treatment (54%), with 38% of youths receiving CBT alone and a small minority 
of youths receiving medication alone (4%). At the 12-month assessment, collaborative care 
had a significantly higher response rate (67.6%) than usual care (38.6%) as defined by a 
50% reduction in symptoms, with a clinically impressive effect (NNT = 3; see Table 4).

Shirk et al. (2014) examined the efficacy of individually-based CBT when implemented in a 
sample of depressed adolescents with history of interpersonal trauma. The authors recruited 
adolescents (age 13–17; N = 43) who met criteria for a depressive disorder. Nearly half the 
sample (46%) also met criteria for comorbid PTSD. Youth were randomized to receive either 
adapted CBT or usual care. Adapted CBT consisted of 12 sessions delivered weekly in an 
individual format. The content of treatment consisted of core CBT strategies for depression, 
including identifying and challenging distorted thoughts and increasing level of activity. 
Modifications for this sample with trauma history included use of mindfulness exercises 
throughout the course of treatment and addressing cognitions related to the trauma 
experience. Youth seen in usual care received weekly treatment from therapists who 
primarily described their treatment style as eclectic. At the post-treatment assessment, no 
significant difference in level of depressive symptoms, as measured by the BDI-II, was 
found between groups (g = -.16). Response rates were similar across treatment arms with 
50% of youth in the experimental condition and 48% of youth in the control condition no 
longer meeting criteria for a depressive disorder (NNT = 50).

The final trial was a direct comparison of CBT and IPT manuals, both of which had been 
culturally adapted for Puerto Rican teens (Rosselló et al., 2008). Adolescents (age 12–18; N 
= 112) who met criteria for MDD (66%) or had clinically impairing depressive symptoms 
(34%) were randomized to one of four treatments: CBT in individual format, CBT in group

format, IPT in individual format, or IPT in group format. The investigators found no 
statistically significant differences across modality or theoretical orientation (see Table 4). 
Given the null findings in this trial, it is possible that youths in all conditions improved from 
baseline as a function of natural remission. However, all four arms had response rates 
comparable to the CBT and IPT literatures (62% and 57%, respectively; NNT = 20), albeit 
at the lower end of this range of substantial clinical response. Given these absolute response 
rates, it is also plausible that the interventions were efficacious but similar in impact.

In addition to these recently published trials, we included one trial excluded in the prior 
review. Kerfoot et al. (2004) examined the effectiveness of training community mental 
health workers in CBT. Therapists randomized to CBT, versus routine care, attended a 1-
week training that covered general information about adolescent depression, general CBT 
concepts (e.g., goal setting), and specific strategies in this CBT intervention for depression 
in adolescents (e.g., pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving). The CBT intervention 
was designed to last 8 sessions over the course of 8 weeks and had been shown to be 
efficacious in a prior trial (included in prior reviews; Wood, Harrington, & Moore, 1996). 
Following the initial 2 psychoeducational sessions, the manual allowed for flexible 
application of CBT strategies. In addition to initial training in this treatment, therapists had 
access to biweekly supervision. Therapists recruited adolescents with elevated depression 
symptom scores (see Table 4). At post-treatment, levels of depressive symptoms did not 
significantly differ between youths receiving CBT compared to those in TAU nor did youth 
receiving CBT have higher rates of response to treatment (NNT = 33). Notably, several 
outcomes from this trial suggest that youths randomized to the CBT condition may not have 
received a sufficient dose of this intervention. First, fewer than half of youths in the CBT 
arm (45%) completed 4 of the 8 CBT sessions. Second, therapists had a low level of 
attendance to supervision with a mean of 3 supervision sessions attended, and nearly one 
third of clinicians (8 of 25) attended 1 or fewer supervision sessions. Despite the lack of a 
significant treatment effect, therapists in the CBT condition reported significantly higher 
levels of confidence and perceived knowledge in working with depressed adolescents than 
those in TAU.

Group CBT in adolescents—Six trials testing the effects of group-based CBT have been 
conducted since the previous review. Three have examined the effects of variants of the 
Adolescents Coping with Depression (CWD-A) manual, a program identified in previous 
reviews as probably efficacious. Two of these three trials were based on the prevention 
version of this program, the Coping with Stress (CWS) variant of the CWD-A manual. 
Dobson, Hopkins, Fata, Scherrer, and Allan (2010) examined the efficacy of CWS in 
preventing development of depression and anxiety disorders in adolescents. Youths (age 13–
18, N = 46) with elevated depressive symptoms who did not meet criteria for a depressive 
disorder were randomized to either CWS or a group-based attention control condition. 
Consistent with prior trials of CWS (Clarke et al., 1995), the manual was implemented as a 
15-session group-based treatment primarily focused on teaching cognitive restructuring and 
behavioral activation. The attention control condition matched CWS in format and number 
of sessions. The content of this control condition focused on general topics relevant to teens 
(e.g., confidence, role models) without facilitators providing “expert advice.” No significant

difference in depressive symptoms was found between the CWS and control groups at the 
end of acute treatment or at the 3- or 6-month follow-up assessments. To better understand 
this result, the authors employed a benchmarking technique in order to compare outcomes in 
the current study with the original, positive CWS prevention trial (Clarke et al., 1995). In the 
current study, baseline levels of depression symptoms appeared to be substantially higher 
than in the original report, but post-intervention scores for CWS and control were lower than 
in the original study. The authors suggested that this pattern implied that both CWS and 
control were effective in reducing symptoms of depression, although CWS was not 
statistically superior at reducing symptoms compared to the attention control condition.

In a test of a manual adapted from CWS, Stice, Rohde, Seeley, and Gau (2008) also 
examined the effect of CBT in a sample of adolescents (age 14–19, N = 341) with clinically 
elevated depressive symptoms who did not currently meet criteria for a major depressive 
disorder. Youth were randomized to either CBT or one of three control conditions: group-
based non-directive supportive therapy, CBT bibliotherapy, or an assessment only control 
condition. The authors adapted the CWS manual, creating a group-based, 6-session protocol 
that continued to focus on behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring. Similarly, the 
non-directive supportive therapy group met for 6 weekly 1-hour sessions and consisted 
primarily of sharing feelings and listening. Youth randomized to the CBT bibliotherapy 
group were given Feeling Good (Burns, 1980), a self-help book designed to help address 
feelings of depression using CBT techniques. At the post-treatment assessment, youth 
randomized to CWS had significantly fewer depressive symptoms compared with all three 
control conditions, and the superiority of CBT to assessment only was maintained at 6-
month follow-up (NNT = 16; see Table 4). At more extended follow-up, the superiority of 
CBT over control as measured by depressive symptoms was not maintained, with the only 
significant pairwise comparison being between CBT and assessment only at 1 year post-
intervention (see Table 4). However, through the 2-year follow-up period youth randomized 
to CBT had significantly lower rates of onset of depressive disorder.

The final new test of the CWD-A manual examined the efficacy of the program in 
conjunction with family-based treatment for youth with comorbid depressive disorder and 
substance use disorder (SUD; Rohde, Waldron, Turner, Brody, & Jorgensen, 2014). The 
authors recruited adolescents (age 13–18; N = 170) with a current depressive disorder and 
substance use disorder (non-nicotine SUD). All eligible youth received CBT for depression 
(CWD-A) and a traditional treatment for substance use disorders, Functional Family 
Therapy (FFT; Alexander & Parsons, 1986). Youth were randomized to receive either FFT 
followed by CWD-A, CWD-A followed by FFT, or simultaneously coordinated FFT and 
CWD-A treatment. CWD-A was implemented as a group-based treatment for depression 
with some modifications to the treatment manual (e.g., shorter duration of 12 session, use of 
reward system for participation). FFT was implemented in individual, family-based format 
including 12 sessions over 10 weeks. At the post-treatment (20 week) assessment, there 
were no significant differences across treatment sequences, with 47% of youth experiencing 
a remission of depression (defined as CDRS-R ≤ 28). The post-treatment effects of this trial 
are difficult to interpret given the lack of an inert control arm and exposure to CBT in each 
treatment sequence. Notably, across all three intervention sequences youth experienced a 
significant decrease in depressive symptoms by the mid-point in treatment. This significant

decrease in depressive symptoms by week 10 was shown in both youth who had received 
CWD-A only within this timeframe, as well as youth who had received FFT only within this 
time frame. In contrast, an effect of sequencing was found on substance use outcomes. 
Youth randomized to FFT prior to CWD-A had lower levels of substance use following 
treatment compared with youth receiving coordinated treatment. Across conditions, youth 
depressive symptoms continued to improve at the 12-month assessment (60% achieved 
remission). Due to the exposure to CBT in each treatment arm, a post-treatment effect size 
and NNT could not be calculated for this study.

Since the last review, one set of investigators examined the effect of a modified version of 
the Penn Resiliency Program adapted for Dutch youth (Wijnhoven, Creemers, Vermulst, 
Scholte, & Engels, 2014). The investigators recruited adolescent girls (age 11–15; N = 102) 
with clinically significant depressive symptoms (CDI ≥ 16) from schools in the Netherlands. 
Eligible youth were randomized to either group-based CBT classes or an assessment only 
control condition. The CBT condition consisted of 8 classes lasting 50-minutes each. The 
focus of these classes was to learn the relationship between thoughts and feelings, identify 
negative thoughts, and challenge distorted cognitions. At the post-treatment assessment, 
youth receiving CBT had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms as measured by 
the CES-D (g = .59). A significant effect of treatment was also found at the 6-month follow-
up (g = .71); however, the difference between groups was not significant at the 1-month 
follow-up (g = .38).

Stallard et al. (2012) examined the effectiveness of a classroom-based depression prevention 
program. Though implemented as a universal prevention program, the authors presented data 
on youths with clinically elevated depression at baseline separately. Youths (age 12–16; 
Ntotal = 5030, nhigh risk = 1064) were randomized to either CBT, attention control, or usual 
school provision. The CBT program was implemented in the classroom setting over the 
course of 9 classes. Content of the CBT program included learning effective coping skills, 
building emotion-regulation strategies, and challenging distorted thoughts. The attention 
control condition included the usual school curriculum (e.g., health education) with the 
addition of two facilitators not trained in the CBT program. No significant differences were 
found in self-report of depression symptoms between the CBT, attention control, and usual 
school provision arms 12 months following study initiation. Youth receiving CBT did not 
have higher rates of response to treatment at the post-treatment assessment (NNT = −14).

Finally, as discussed in the previous sections, Rosselló and colleagues (2008) compared the 
effects of group to individually-based CBT and group to individually-based IPT. As noted 
above, these four active treatments did not differ significantly; however, response rates for 
these four treatment arms were similar in magnitude to those found in trials with significant 
effects of treatment relative to control. Across group and individual formats, CBT had a 
response rate of 62%.

Technology-assisted CBT in adolescents—Since the prior review, there has been one 
trial of technology-assisted CBT meeting our entry criteria. Merry and colleagues (2012) 
examined the effect of the Smart Positive Active Realistic X-factor Thoughts Program 
(SPARX) in a sample of depressed adolescents. The authors recruited adolescents (age 12–

19) who were seeking treatment for depression (N = 187; a clinically identified sample). 
Youth in this trial were randomized to either SPARX or TAU. The SPARX Program consists 
of seven 30-minute modules covering psychoeducation, relaxation, problem solving, 
pleasant activity scheduling, cognitive restructuring, and social skills training. The effect of 
SPARX did not differ significantly from TAU on either self-report measures or rates of 
response (NNT = 21). At 3-months post-treatment, youth randomized to SPARX continued 
to report mildly lower depressive symptoms that did not differ significantly from TAU.

Individual IPT in adolescents—In addition to these trials of CBT, two new trials of IPT 
have been conducted within our review window. One of these trials included individually-
based IPT in depressed adolescents; as discussed previously, Rosselló and colleagues (2008) 
examined the efficacy of group and individual CBT and IPT in a sample of adolescents who 
met criteria for MDD (66%) or had clinically impairing depressive symptoms. The 
conditions did not statistically differ, but response rates for IPT were comparable to trials 
finding a significant effect of treatment against less active controls.

Group IPT in adolescents—In addition to the trial by Rosselló and colleagues (2008), 
one additional trial of group-based IPT has been conducted since the 2008 review. 
Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) was tested in 
adolescents with clinically elevated symptoms of depression but whom did not yet meet 
criteria for a depressive disorder (N = 57; Young et al., 2010). Youth were randomized to 
either group-based IPT-AST or school counseling. Compared to youths in counseling, teens 
in IPT-AST evidenced fewer self-reported symptoms of depression at post-treatment. Effect 
of IPT-AST on self-report of depressive symptoms diminished over time with a trend 
towards significance at 6-month follow-up and no significant difference detected between 
groups at 12- and 18-month follow-up. Youth in IPT-AST had lower rates of onset of 
depressive disorder at the 6-month follow-up (0% compared with 19.1%; NNT = 5); 
however, no between group difference was found at the 18-month follow-up (see Table 4).

Family-based treatment for adolescents—In this review period, two new trials of 
family-based treatment for youth depression have emerged. Diamond and colleagues (2010) 
probed the efficacy of Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), a manualized program 
for depression tested originally in a smaller trial included in the 2008 review. In the ABFT 
model, disruptions in stable family relationships (e.g., from a period of neglect and an out-
of-home placement) are thought to influence adolescent depression both directly as a source 
of stress and indirectly through the impact of these events on adolescent’s individual 
emotion regulation skills and reluctance to use their caregiver as a buffer and support when 
coping with future stressors. Thus, the goal of ABFT is to strengthen the connection 
between the teen and their caregiver through relationship building activities and reduce 
depression as a function of this improved relationship. Efficacy of ABFT was examined in a 
sample of adolescents (age 12–17; N = 66) with clinically elevated depressive symptoms and 
significant suicidality (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire > 31; Reynolds, 1988). Youth were 
randomized to either 12 weeks of ABFT or enhanced UC, which included assistance with 
referrals and clinical monitoring. Adolescents randomized to ABFT had significantly lower 
depressive symptoms and superior treatment response (55%) compared with the UC

condition (31%; NNT = 4). While the difference between ABFT and control was statistically 
significant, these response rates for both treatment and control are on the lower end for the 
depression treatment literature. This is consistent with the severity of the sample in the trial 
(62% had history of suicide attempt), and the response rate of ABFT was on par with results 
of the Brent et al. (2008) study of treatment-resistant depression (54.8% adjunctive CBT; see 
Table 4).

As discussed above, one additional trial examined a family focused intervention in addition 
to group-based CBT for depression (Rohde et al., 2014). The authors in this trial recruited 
adolescents with comorbid depressive disorder and substance use disorder (age 13–18, N = 
170). All youth received group-based CWD-A and Functional Family Therapy, a family 
systems-oriented treatment for youth with substance use disorders (see Hogue et al., 2015). 
Youth were randomized to receive FFT followed by CWD-A, CWD-A followed by FFT, or 
coordinated treatment of FFT and CWD-A. Across arms, youth experienced a significant 
decrease in depression within the first half of treatment, with no significant effect of the 
sequencing of treatments. Due to the trial design and absence of an inert control condition, it 
is difficult to interpret these results. Across treatment sequences, the remission rate (47% as 
defined by CDRS-R ≤ 28) is consistent with other trials in severe or comorbid samples that 
have demonstrated significant effects favoring intervention relative to control (e.g., Brent et 
al., 2008; Rohde et al., 2004).

STATUS OF TREATMENTS

In the following section, we evaluate the evidentiary status of psychosocial treatments for 
depression in youth, guided by the criteria and categories summarized in Table 1. This 
evaluation is based on the entire published youth depression treatment literature and 
represents both an update on previous reviews and a reclassification of studies included in 
previous reports based on current EBT criteria. As discussed previously, this latter process 
resulted in the exclusion of 18 studies previously included in the depression EBT literature 
base and the inclusion of eight studies that had previously been omitted (see Table 2) in 
addition to the 14 new trials published since the last EBT report. In our current evaluation, 
we focus on the effects of interventions at post-treatment; durability of intervention effects 
over follow-up is described separately at the end of this section.

Treatments are organized within developmental level (child depression, adolescent 
depression), and evidence evaluated at the level of treatment type (CBT, behavior therapy 
[BT], IPT, family-based, other) and then within treatment type by modality (individual, 
group, technology-assisted, bibliotherapy). Status of treatments is summarized in Tables 5 
and 6.

Depression in Children

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—According to our current review criteria, there are a 
total of seven randomized trials testing CBT in children with clinically significant 
depression. One of these studies (Weisz et al., 2009) represents new findings in the literature 
(published since 2008), and six studies were published in the time windows of prior EBT 
reviews, including three studies previously excluded from consideration (De Cuyper et al.,

2004; Liddle & Spence, 1990; Vostanis et al., 1996a). In this pool of seven studies, one 
contained positive findings in favor of CBT over waitlist or psychologically inert controls 
(Kahn et al., 1990). Four studies had generally positive but more equivocal findings of CBT 
over a range of comparison conditions (De Cuyper et al., 2004; Nelson, Barnard, & Cain, 
2003; Stark et al., 1987; Weisz et al., 2009), and two studies had no significant findings 
between CBT and control arms (Liddle & Spence, 1990; Vostanis et al., 1996a). In no study 
was CBT statistically inferior to control. Given this pattern of effects, CBT as a broad 
intervention approach currently meets criteria as a possibly efficacious treatment modality in 
depressed children. This is a change from the previous classification of CBT as well-
established due to our inclusion of null findings and exclusion of some studies in 
subsyndromal samples with positive effects that had been included in previous reviews (see 
Table 2). In our current pool of studies, CBT has demonstrated positive effects over waitlist 
in one experiment, but these results have not been clearly replicated by another investigative 
team. CBT fails to obtain probably efficacious or well-established status in our estimation, 
given that the model has not statistically separated from an active control condition or 
alternate evidence-based intervention for child depression and that the pattern of CBT 
effects are quite mixed both across (cf. Liddle & Spence, 1990; Weisz et al., 2009) and 
within investigations (i.e., effects varied substantially across measures; Stark et al., 1987).

Individual CBT for children: Three studies of individual CBT in children met criteria for 
our review. One had a null finding (Vostanis et al., 1996a; described earlier), and two had 
equivocal results. Nelson and colleagues (2003) found that youths in individual CBT 
delivered through two different modalities (videoconferencing versus face-to-face) improved 
from baseline, with youth in the videoconferencing condition showing significantly 
accelerated results and greater improvement compared to individual face-to-face CBT 
(Nelson et al., 2003). Individual face-to-face CBT may have been efficacious in this trial (the 
absolute response rate was high, with 82% no longer meeting diagnostic criteria), but it is 
difficult to verify in the absence of a worse performing control condition. In the trial by 
Weisz and colleagues (2009; described earlier), individual CBT did not outperform UC on 
depression indices at the end of treatment. However, youth in the CBT condition improved at 
a faster rate than youth in UC. This mixed pattern of findings suggests that individual CBT 
in children is best conceived as experimental treatment, and additional evidence is needed to 
demonstrate that the modality can reliably and consistently separate from control. Of note, 
all three studies of individual CBT for depressed children in this review had active 
comparison conditions -- supportive therapy (Vostanis et al., 1996), an alternate version of 
CBT (video CBT; Nelson et al., 2003), or community treatment (Weisz et al., 2009) -- and 
failure to demonstrate unambiguously positive effects compared to such controls is both far 
less damning and far less surprising than if individual CBT for children had failed to 
separate from waitlist.

Group CBT for children: At the time of the 2008 review, the majority of child trials 
examined group-based CBT, and this form of intervention was deemed well-established for 
the treatment of depression in children. However, of the nine child studies included in 2008, 
seven failed to meet inclusion criteria for the current review. As can be seen in Table 2, a 
large proportion of the investigations included in 2008, but screened out of the current

report, focused on the treatment of subsyndromal depression symptoms (below our clinical 
cutoffs; e.g., Weisz et al., 1997) or on the prevention of depression in children at-risk for 
disorder, some of whom may have been asymptomatic at baseline (e.g., Jaycox et al., 2004). 
At the time of our current search, only four studies of group CBT in children appeared to be 
explicitly focused on the treatment of clinically significant depression. Of these, one study 
had positive findings in favor of group CBT (Kahn et al., 1990), two studies had a no 
difference finding between CBT group and control at post-treatment (De Cuyper et al., 2004; 
Liddle & Spence, 1990), and zero had negative findings. One additional trial had mixed 
results, with the cognitive-behavioral treatment arm outperforming the comparison group on 
one index of depression but not others (Stark et al., 1987). Overall, the pattern of results is 
more promising than that for individual CBT with children, with one clearly positive trial 
and some additional positive findings within more ambiguous trials. Group-based CBT in 
children, thus, currently meets criteria as a possibly efficacious treatment modality. Again, 
this designation represents a notable change from previous reviews, in which group-based 
CBT was listed as well-established, due in large part to our exclusion of group-based CBT 
studies in samples with sub-clinical depression symptoms (see Table 2).

Technology-assisted CBT: One study met criteria for our review that examined the use of 
technology in delivering CBT to depressed children. Nelson and colleagues (2003) found 
that CBT delivered through videoconferencing was superior to individual CBT delivered 
through more traditional face-to-face means. While this one study shows a positive effect of 
videoconference CBT over another active treatment condition, it is difficult to gauge the 
effectiveness of traditional face-to-face CBT in this trial. As noted previously, individual 
CBT for depressed children is not strongly supported in the research literature, and it is 
possible that the effects of this “active” intervention would not exceed a control condition if 
a third arm had been included in the design. Conservatively, individual CBT should operate 
at least as a control for the processes of natural remission; accordingly, CBT delivered 
through technology is designated as possibly efficacious at this time, having demonstrated 
superior effects to a control condition in a single trial.

Behavior therapy for children—In the 2008 review, behavior therapy was identified as a 
probably efficacious treatment on the basis of three studies (Kahn et al., 1990; King & 
Kirschenbaum, 1990; Stark et al., 1987). No new trials of behavior therapy meeting our 
inclusion criteria have been published in our review window, and one of the three trials 
previously included does not meet the more stringent inclusion criteria for our current report 
(see Table 2). The two remaining trials (Kahn et al., 1990; Stark et al., 1987) lack specific 
pairwise comparisons to clearly differentiate the behavioral treatment arms from waitlist 
(e.g., instead reporting overall treatment effects collapsing across several arms). As such, it 
is difficult to conclude that independent replication of the behavioral effect has been 
demonstrated. With the data available in these reports, behavior therapy would clearly meet 
criteria as a possibly efficacious treatment (as classified in Table 5). Also note, the three 
“behavioral” intervention arms included in these two studies do not share a core set of 
behavioral techniques but represent a diverse, non-overlapping set of behavioral strategies 
for reducing stress and treating depression (relaxation training, self-modeling, and 
behavioral problem solving/effective social activation). It becomes difficult to generalize

across treatment approaches when there is a high level of heterogeneity in treatment manuals 
within a modality. However, all three programs were based on behavioral principles of 
symptom change (versus alternate hypothesized mechanisms), supporting the decision to 
evaluate the evidence for these approaches together as a broader behavioral modality.

Other psychosocial interventions for children—One additional RCT by Trowell and 
colleagues (2007) met minimum methodological criteria for inclusion in this review. In this 
study, depressed youths (age 9–15) were randomized to receive either individual 
psychodynamic therapy or family therapy. Results of the study were equivocal, with both 
groups demonstrating significant change from baseline but failing to statistically separate at 
post-treatment in terms of diagnostic recovery and showing a mixed pattern of effects across 
dimensional measures. At 6-month follow-up, the individual psychodynamic therapy 
condition showed a marginally superior response rate for Major Depressive Disorder but not 
for other operationalizations of depression. Furthermore, the study suffered from differential 
attrition over follow-up, and the effect on MDD varied by how researchers handled missing 
data. The authors concluded that both treatments were effective, given significant change 
from baseline status; however, the design cannot rule out natural remission as an alternate 
explanation of “treatment” effects. As a result, we classified both individual psychodynamic 
therapy and family therapy as experimental treatments on the basis of this single 
investigation.

Depression in Adolescents

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—To date, 27 trials of CBT meeting our review entry 
criteria have been conducted. Of these trials, CBT has significantly separated from 
comparison conditions in 15 trials; 12 trials found no significant effect of CBT compared 
with control, and no studies reported CBT performing significantly worse than control. 
Twelve of the 27 studies were included in the prior reviews, 11 new primary outcome trials 
have been published since 2007, and four additional studies were included in our review that 
were screened out of previous reports. Across trials delivering CBT in group and individual 
formats, CBT meets criteria as a well-established treatment. Positive findings for CBT 
outweigh null reports, findings have been replicated across independent investigative teams, 
and CBT has outperformed active controls and alternate treatments in many (although not 
all) studies. Findings are presented in further detail in the following sections, by modality.

Individual CBT for adolescents: Fourteen trials of individual CBT for depression in 
adolescents met entry criteria for the current review. Included in this evidence base are six 
trials included in the previous reviews (Asarnow et al., 2005; Brent et al., 1997; Melvin et 
al., 2006; Rosselló & Bernal, 1999; TADS Team, 2004; Wood et al., 1996), five new trials 
published since 2007 (Brent et al., 2008; Richardson et al., 2014; Rosselló et al., 2008; 
Shirk, DePrince, Crisostomo, & Labus, 2014; Szigethy, Bujoreanu, et al., 2014), and three 
trials published prior to 2008 but not included in previous reviews due to null findings or 
misclassification as an open trial (Clarke et al., 2005; Goodyer et al., 2007; Kerfoot et al., 
2004).

Among trials delivering individually based CBT for depressed adolescents, seven trials 
found positive effects for CBT compared with control (Asarnow et al., 2005; Brent et al., 
2008; Brent, Holder, et al., 1997; Melvin et al., 2006; Richardson et al., 2014; Rosselló & 
Bernal, 1999; Wood et al., 1996). While one of these investigations compared CBT to a 
waitlist control (Rosselló & Bernal, 1999), the majority of trials found effects of CBT 
against more stringent control conditions, including alternative psychosocial treatment 
(Brent et al., 1997; Wood et al., 1996), medication (CBT versus SSRI, Melvin et al., 2006; 
CBT + medication switch versus medication switch, Brent et al., 2008), and usual care 
(Asarnow et al., 2005; Richardson et al., 2014).

While no trial found a significantly negative effect of CBT relative to control, in seven 
studies CBT did fail to statistically separate from comparison conditions (Clarke et al., 2005; 
Goodyer et al., 2007; Kerfoot et al., 2004; Rosselló et al., 2008; Shirk et al., 2014; Szigethy 
et al., 2014; TADS Team, 2004). In general, trials with null findings also tested CBT against 
stringent controls. Rosselló and colleagues (2008) examined CBT against an alternative 
evidence-based treatment found to be efficacious in a prior trial (IPT; Rosselló & Bernal, 
2009) as well as a similar CBT protocol delivered in a group setting. Clarke and colleagues 
(2005) examined the effectiveness of CBT with SSRI compared with SSRI alone. Several 
trials examined the effect of CBT compared with either non-directive supportive therapy or 
psychosocial TAU (Goodyer et al., 2007; Kerfoot et al., 2004; Shirk et al., 2014; Szigethy et 
al., 2014). Only one trial failed to find an effect of CBT compared with an attention-placebo 
control (pill placebo; TADS Team, 2004); however, CBT when used in combination with 
medication outperformed SSRI alone on some metrics in this study. Furthermore, several 
trials with null findings examined the effect of CBT in either severe samples or embedded 
within active clinical practice. For example, Goodyer and colleagues (2007) examined the 
effect of CBT in a sample of youth with moderate to severe depression also including youth 
with active suicidality and self-harm, psychosis, and conduct disorder. Similarly, Shirk and 
colleagues (2014) tested CBT in a sample of adolescents with history of interpersonal 
trauma and high rates of comorbid PTSD. As described in detail in the review of new 
studies, the trial by Kerfoot and colleagues (2004) examined the effectiveness of CBT 
among currently practicing mental health workers with no prior exposure to CBT and who 
had poor attendance to supervision.

In sum, individual CBT appears to be a reliably efficacious intervention in half of the studies 
(7 of 14) in a sizeable literature. CBT effects are less reliable in clinically complex samples 
and when compared against other active interventions, but individual CBT has not proven 
inferior to alternate treatment under these conditions and has on occasion been significantly 
superior. Thus, CBT delivered in an individual format to depressed adolescents meets 
criteria as a well-established treatment due to multiple, independently replicated findings 
supporting superiority of CBT to active controls and alternate treatments (e.g., family 
therapy, non-directive supportive therapy) and potential equivalence to other well-
established interventions (e.g., IPT) in studies by independent investigative teams.

Group CBT for adolescents: There have been 12 studies meeting criteria for the current 
review in which CBT for adolescent depression was delivered in a group format. Five of 
these trials were included in the prior review (Clarke et al., 1995; Clarke, Rohde,

Lewinsohn, Hops, & Seeley, 1999; Clarke et al., 2001; Lewinsohn et al., 1990; Rohde et al., 
2004) with one trial previously excluded due to null findings (Clarke et al., 2002). Since the 
prior review, there have been six new trials (Dobson et al., 2010; Stallard et al., 2012; Stice 
et al., 2008; Rohde et al., 2014; Rosselló et al., 2008; Wijnhoven et al., 2014). Among all 
trials of group CBT for adolescents, seven have shown positive effects of CBT, and five 
trials have shown null findings (Clarke et al., 2002; Dobson et al., 2010; Stallard et al., 2012; 
Rohde et al., 2014; Rosselló et al., 2008). As discussed above, one trial with null findings 
tested CBT in an individual format against group-based CBT and against group and 
individually-based IPT (with no inert control group; Rosselló et al., 2008). Similarly, a 
second trial with null findings tested group-based CBT in combination with family therapy 
(Rohde et al., 2014). As reported above, no control group was included in this study and 
three variations in sequencing of these two treatments did not result in statistically 
significant differences in depressive symptoms. Another trial with null findings was 
conducted in a particularly difficult-to-treat sample of currently depressed youth with 
currently depressed parents (Clarke et al., 2002). Both of the other trials with null findings 
were prevention studies in high symptom samples, with one trial specifically excluding 
youth meeting criteria for a depressive disorder (Dobson et al., 2010). This trial failed to find 
an effect of CBT when compared with non-directive supportive treatment; however, when 
comparing CBT to the control group in a similar depression prevention trial (Clarke et al., 
1995) the authors found a significant effect of CBT. The second prevention study failing to 
find an effect of CBT was conducted by Stallard et al. (2012). Poor rates of response in this 
trial may in part be related to low dose of intervention (11 sessions administered flexibly in 
the school curriculum).

In sum, given multiple trials finding group based CBT superior to active controls or 
potentially equivalent to alternate treatments (e.g., IPT) as tested by independent 
investigative teams, we find group based CBT to be a well-established treatment for 
depressed adolescents.

Technology-assisted CBT: No trials of technology-assisted CBT among depressed 
adolescents were available at the time of the last review. Subsequently, one trial of 
technology-assisted CBT meeting our review entry criteria has been conducted (Merry et al., 
2012). As discussed previously, the effects of technology-assisted CBT did not significantly 
differ from the outcomes of TAU consisting of individual psychosocial treatment or 
medication (Merry et al., 2012). TAU in this investigation may be an active treatment, but it 
is difficult to gauge the effects of this condition in the absence of a worse performing control 
group. Accordingly, technology-assisted CBT currently meets criteria as an experimental 
treatment.

Bibliotherapy CBT: Two trials have examined the effect of CBT bibliotherapy as a 
treatment for adolescent depression. One trial was available at the time of the last review 
(Ackerson et al., 1998), and one trial including a bibliotherapy condition has been published 
subsequently (Stice et al., 2008). CBT delivered as bibliotherapy was found to be superior to 
wait-list control in one trial (Ackerson et al., 1998). In the second trial, CBT bibliotherapy 
did not separate from assessment-only control at post but effects were present at 6-month

follow-up. Based on post-treatment findings, CBT delivered as bibliotherapy is considered a 
possibly efficacious treatment.

Interpersonal Psychotherapy—A total of six trials of IPT have been conducted in 
samples of depressed adolescents. Five of these trials had positive findings, with one trial 
showing no significant difference between CBT and IPT (Rosselló et al., 2008). Summing 
across evidence from group-based and individual formats, IPT meets criteria as a well-
established treatment. IPT has consistently separated from active controls, and IPT effects 
are similar in magnitude to the effects of CBT, another well-established intervention, in 
head-to-head trials (Rosselló et al., 2008).

Individual IPT for adolescents: Four trials meeting criteria for the current review have 
examined individually-based IPT in depressed adolescents. Three of these were included in 
the previous review (Mufson, Dorta, et al., 2004; Mufson, Weissman, et al., 1999; Rosselló, 
& Bernal, 1999). Among trials of IPT delivered in an individual format, three showed 
positive effects for IPT (Mufson, Dorta, et al., 2004; Mufson, Weissman, et al., 1999; 
Rosselló, & Bernal, 1999) across two independent investigative teams. These trials have 
tested efficacy of IPT against waitlist or clinical monitoring control conditions (Mufson et 
al., 1999; Rosselló, & Bernal, 1999), as well as efficacy of IPT when delivered by school 
counselors compared with TAU (Mufson et al., 2004). The only null finding for individual 
IPT comes from the Roselló study (2008) comparing individual IPT to group IPT and to 
individual and group CBT. As noted above, response rates for IPT in this trial were 
consistent with trials finding positive effects of treatment relative to control, albeit within the 
lower end of this range. Positive effects of individual IPT found by two independent teams 
suggest this model should be considered a well-established treatment.

Group IPT for adolescents: A total of three trials have examined group-based IPT in 
depressed adolescents, with one trial included in the last review (Young et al., 2006a) and 
two trials published subsequently (Rosselló et al., 2008; Young et al., 2010). Two of these 
three trials found positive effects of group IPT compared with school counseling for 
adolescents with elevated depression symptoms (Young, Mufson, & Davies, 2006a; Young, 
Mufson, & Gallop, 2010). As described in the review of new studies, the third trial found no 
statistically significant difference between individual and group versions of IPT and CBT in 
a sample of youths with clinically diagnosed depression (Rosselló et al., 2008). This latter 
null finding is somewhat difficult to interpret, given the absence of a worse performing inert, 
control condition in the design. Response rates for all four intervention arms in this study 
were within the range of the published literature for CBT and individual IPT, and, thus, the 
null finding could be construed as evidence of equivalence between group IPT and other 
well-established treatments. Conservatively, group IPT currently meets criteria as probably 
efficacious intervention (see Table 6), having shown positive effects compared to control in 
two studies by the same investigative team.

Family-based Treatment—Five trials of family-based intervention met entry criteria for 
the current review, with two new trials published in the review window (Diamond et al., 
2010; Rohde et al., 2014). In this pool, two trials found significantly superior effects of

family treatment compared with control (Diamond, Reis, Diamond, Siqueland, & Isaacs, 
2002; Diamond et al., 2010); two trials failed to find significant differences between 
treatment and control (Rohde et al., 2014; Sanford et al., 2006), and one investigation found 
that family therapy was significantly inferior to CBT and failed to separate from non-
directive supportive therapy (Brent et al., 1997).

A major challenge in interpreting the findings for this treatment modality is the diversity of 
family-based interventions, ranging from adjunctive family psychoeducation (Sanford et al., 
2006) to full courses of an established family therapy (Brent et al., 1997; Rohde et al., 
2014). Within this sample, only one manual, Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), 
was tested in more than one trial (Diamond et al., 2002; Diamond et al., 2010). As discussed 
in our review of behavioral therapy for child depression, it becomes difficult to generalize 
across treatment approaches when there is a high level of heterogeneity in treatment manuals 
within a modality. However, all included interventions were based on family process models 
of symptom change (versus, for example, being CBT treatments with adjunctive family 
sessions), supporting the decision to evaluate the evidence for these approaches together as a 
broader family modality. Taken together, the evidence supporting family-based therapy as a 
general approach to intervention falls within the criteria of a possibly efficacious treatment. 
Of note, if the current review had taken a manual-by-manual approach to evaluating the 
status of treatments, the two positive trials of ABFT would suggest the protocol was 
probably efficacious as a specific family therapy model.

DURABILITY OF EFECTS OVER FOLLOW-UP

In our evaluation of the status of treatments, we focused on the effects of interventions at the 
immediate post-treatment assessment. Here, we comment briefly on the effects of the above 
interventions over time. Follow-up data reviewed here were restricted to analyses preserving 
randomization. Analyses in which the control group received the intervention (e.g., 
Ackerson et al., 1998) or only included a subset of the sample (e.g., youth depressed at the 
end of acute treatment; Clarke et al., 1999) were not included in this review of follow-up 
reports.

Within the child depression literature, four original trials included in the current review 
reported follow-up data (De Cuyper et al., 2004; Kahn et al., 1990, Liddle & Spence, 1990; 
Trowell et al., 2007; Vostanis et al., 1996; Vostanis, Feehan, & Grattan, 1998). Latency of 
the final follow-up assessment from post-treatment varied substantially between trials 
ranging from 1 month (Kahn et al., 1990) to 2 years (Vostanis et al., 1998). Among trials 
with shorter follow-up windows (< 6 months), outcomes appear to be mixed. Two trials 
reported positive effects of treatment relative to control (De Cuyper et al., 2004; Kahn et al., 
1990), while another showed improvement in all groups across most measures (Liddle & 
Spence, 1990). Two studies included longer (≥ 6 months) follow-up windows. One found no 
effect of treatment group relative to control (Vostanis, Feehan, & Grattan, 1998; Vostanis, 
Feehan, Grattan, & Bickerton, 1996a), while another found improvement in both treatment 
arms across a 6-month follow-up (Trowell et al., 2007).

In contrast, the majority of trials in adolescents (22 of 34) reported follow-up data. In 
comparison with studies of childhood depression, trials in adolescent samples tended to 
report on longer follow-up periods with 12-month (Asarnow, Jaycox, et al., 2009; Clarke et 
al., 1995; Rohde et al., 2004; Rohde et al., 2014), 18-month (TADS Team, 2009; Vitiello et 
al., 2011; Young et al., 2010), and 24-month (Birmaher et al., 2000; Clarke, Hornbrook, 
Lynch, Polen, Gale, Beardslee, et al., 2001; Clarke, Hornbrook, Lynch, Polen, Gale, 
O’Connor, et al., 2002; Stice et al., 2010) post-treatment assessments not uncommon. Across 
CBT and IPT intervention studies, most youth randomized to both active treatment and 
control conditions recovered over time, with few findings of significant differences between 
groups. Intervention studies that did find significant treatment effects over follow-up tended 
to have very short assessment windows (maximum of 1 month post; Mufson et al., 2004). 
However, several indicated prevention trials (Clarke, Hawkins, et al., 1995; Clarke, 
Hornbrook, et al., 2001; Stice, Rohde, Gau, et al., 2010; Stice, Rohde, Seeley, et al., 2008; 
Young et al., 2006a; Wijnhoven et al., 2014) found significant effects of intervention on 
depressive symptoms and episodes for periods as long as 24 months.

Taken together, these results suggest only weak durability of specific treatment effects on 
depression over time, due in large part to continued improvement in depression in control 
conditions over follow-up (consistent with data on natural remission and the episodic course 
of untreated depression; Kovacs, 1996). In contrast, prevention studies with high symptom 
youth have a more promising profile of effects over time. Youths in these investigations are 
typically selected to have clinically-significant symptoms but not yet meet full diagnostic 
criteria for disorder, and interventions appear to be more successful in inoculating against 
negative outcomes over extended follow-up compared to control.

PREDICTORS, MODERATORS, AND MEDIATORS

We next turn from our review of primary outcome papers to examine data on the limits to 
and mechanisms of treatment response. As per Kraemer and colleagues (2002), predictors 
were coded as baseline characteristics of youths and families that were associated with poor 
response regardless of condition. Clinically, predictors serve as general prognostic variables. 
In terms of treatment development, identification of a predictor may highlight a new 
intervention target, outside the realm of currently investigated interventions. Conversely, 
moderators were identified as baseline variables associated with differential responses to 
intervention; moderators are useful in making clinical decisions about to whom an 
intervention should be provided. Moderators also may be useful in treatment development, 
as they help to identify areas of weakness in the mechanisms of action of specific 
interventions. We end with a summary and critique of the small literature exploring 
mediators of treatment response in youth depression. Mediation analyses serve as tests of the 
causal theories underlying treatment models (e.g., change in negative cognitive style causes 
change in depressive symptoms within CBT), and results of such analyses may guide efforts 
to refine and strengthen interventions.

To produce a pool of studies for this section, we reviewed all included primary outcome 
papers for relevant analyses within the original report and searched for secondary papers 
from the same datasets by following reference trails, conducting author searches, and

screening abstracts from our original primary outcome search. We limited our consideration 
to empirical investigations of post-treatment data in which treatment and control conditions 
were analyzed separately (versus pooled for analysis), and results were provided for primary 
depression outcomes versus alternative treatment targets (e.g., suicidality). As with the youth 
depression treatment literature at large, evidence on predictors, moderators, and mediators of 
treatment effects is largely based on samples of depressed adolescents and drawn from trials 
testing the effects of CBT. Throughout this section we highlight occasions where findings 
are demonstrated in child samples or with alternate interventions.

Predictors of Treatment Response

Table 7 summarizes results of predictor analyses from 19 publications representing six 
independent trials for adolescent depression (Brent, Emslie, et al., 2008; Brent, Holder, et 
al., 1997; Lewinsohn et al., 1990; Mufson et al., 2004; Rohde et al., 2014; TADS Team, 
2004); no child depression study included such analyses. We did not observe systematic 
variability by specific measures (e.g., the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale; Weissman & Beck, 
1978); thus, the table condenses results into broader constructs (e.g., cognitive processes). 
Results of studies including IPT treatment arms are indicated with bold font and italics; all 
other results represent findings from CBT trials. Studies of family-based interventions alone 
have not published predictor analyses, although family therapy was a control arm within 
Brent et al. (1997) and a treatment component within Rohde et al. (2014). Results are coded 
as indicating a significant positive association between the predictor and response, a 
significant negative association between the predictor and response, or a null/non-significant 
association between a tested predictor and response. Note that within the same study a 
predictor could be coded into multiple categories, if, for example, results varied by 
operationalization of depression (e.g., different findings for self-report of symptoms versus 
diagnostic remission).

Overall, predictor analyses indicate that demographic factors do not seem to play a 
substantial role in response to treatment. However, this conclusion is qualified by restriction 
of range issues. Age has only been tested within a sample of adolescents, not across the age 
range from childhood through adolescence, finding that treatment effects diminish as youths 
get older (Curry et al., 2006). Similarly, most investigations do not include large numbers of 
ethnic and racial minority youth, limiting power to detect effects. Comparing across trials, 
there is evidence that EBTs for depression can work well in both non-Hispanic White and 
diverse samples of children and adolescents (cf. Rosselló & Bernal, 1999; Weisz et al., 
1997), but direct tests of this association within trials are lacking.

In contrast to the null findings for demographic factors, indices of clinical severity and life 
stress are more reliably related to outcome. Of these factors, higher levels of depression 
symptoms, poor global functioning, high levels of suicidality, comorbid anxiety, cognitive 
distortions, hopelessness, and family conflict most consistently predicted poor response 
across treatment and control conditions. The remaining factors listed in Table 7 were 
infrequently tested or yielded highly inconsistent results, making it difficult to confidently 
draw generalizable inferences. Summary of these mixed results is provided in the table to 
guide additional research.

Moderators of effects

Page 26

Are our evidence-based treatments broadly applicable to depressed youth, or do these 
interventions work more or less well across demographic groups, with different types of 
depression, and in the presence of comorbid disorders? Table 8 summarizes results of 23 
publications reporting moderator analyses from eight independent trials for adolescent 
depression (Brent, Emslie, et al., 2008; Brent, Holder, et al., 1997; Diamond et al., 2010; 
Lewinsohn et al., 1990; Mufson et al., 2004; Rohde et al., 2014; TADS Team, 2004; Young 
et al., 2006a); no child depression study included such analyses. Again, effects did not 
appear to reliably vary by measure; therefore, categories have been collapsed for simplicity. 
Results of studies including an IPT treatment arm are indicated with bold and italic 
formatting, while results from analyses of family-based interventions are labeled with a +; all 
other results represent findings from CBT trials. Moderator results were coded in the table as 
indicating a significantly enhanced effect for the target treatment in comparison to control, 
significantly diminished effect for the target treatment relative to control, or a null/non-
significant moderating relationships (i.e., treatment and control appear to fare equally well in 
the presence of the moderator). Note that these results were necessarily study specific, in 
that relationship between treatment and control was enhanced or diminished relative to the 
main effect reported within the primary outcome analyses for that particular investigation. 
Also note that within the same study, a moderator could be coded in multiple categories if: 
(a) results varied by operationalization of depression (e.g., different findings for self-report 
of symptoms versus diagnostic remission; Clarke et al., 1992), (b) authors explored the 
moderating variable at different levels yielding differential effects on treatment (e.g., Gau et 
al., 2012), or (c) the action of the moderator was dependent on other higher order 
interactions (e.g., Amaya et al., 2010).

Moderators of CBT effects—Demographic factors as a whole were not strong 
moderators of CBT effects, with only a single positive finding suggesting that older age 
enhanced CBT efficacy (Asarnow, Emslie, et al., 2009). However, developmental level and, 
to a lesser extent, ethnicity and socioeconomic status suffered from problems with restriction 
of range, limiting the interpretation of these null effects (as noted previously). CBT also 
appeared to be generally robust in the face of clinical moderators. The modal moderator 
result for clinical factors was a null finding (see Table 8, final column); however, two studies 
found significant group differences in the direction of enhanced effects of CBT for 
participants with more severe depressive symptoms (Asarnow, Emslie, et al., 2009; cf. Curry 
et al., 2006). There is some evidence that CBT may separate more strongly from control in 
the face of comorbidity, with the possible exception of substance abuse. This positive 
moderation of CBT effects is present even for comorbid anxiety. Anxiety broadly predicted 
poorer outcome across conditions (see Table 7), but CBT seems to be less strongly impacted 
by the presence of anxiety, perhaps due to the common pathological processes underlying 
depression and anxiety and shared elements present in CBT interventions for depression and 
evidence-based treatments for anxiety (see Garber & Weersing, 2010).

CBT fared less well in the presence of significant life stress. Effects for parental depression 
are mixed, but, in one key analysis, maternal depression at the time of treatment 
participation functionally eliminated the superiority of CBT to alternate treatments (NST

and family therapy; Brent et al., 1998). Trauma exposure also may prove to be an important 
moderator, with positive effects from CBT more likely among youth without abuse histories 
(Asarnow, Emslie, et al., 2009; Barbe et al., 2004a; Shamseddeen et al., 2011). These 
findings align with the outcomes of the Shirk et al. (2014) investigation. Although the 
authors did not explore moderation, they found that the effects of CBT in a sample exposed 
to interpersonal trauma failed to separate from those of the control group, with an overall 
low response rate to CBT. Moderator results vary by investigation on the impact of type of 
trauma on CBT response, but sexual abuse appears to be most consistently related to a 
diminished CBT response and failure of the intervention to exceed control conditions (Lewis 
et al., 2010; Shamseddeen et al., 2011). At this time, it is unclear how these moderators 
operated, with author hypotheses ranging from negative impact on the therapeutic 
relationship and engagement in the tasks of therapy to impaired executive functioning 
(secondary to trauma) interfering with the uptake of cognitive interventions.

Moderators of IPT effects—Although sufficient evidence has accumulated to designate 
IPT as a well-established intervention for adolescent depression, little information is 
available on moderators of IPT effects. Similar to CBT, IPT may be more efficacious in 
older adolescents; however, generalizability across demographic factors remains largely 
unknown. Only depression severity and comorbid anxiety have been investigated as clinical 
moderators (see Table 8), with mixed results across studies. Additional data on the 
robustness of the model to these factors would seem to be a key step toward promoting the 
widespread adoption of IPT as a treatment option for depression in adolescents.

Some intriguing data are available on the impact of interpersonal variables in IPT response. 
As noted in Table 7, poor social functioning and heightened family conflict predicted poor 
response across both IPT and control; however, these variables also operated as moderators. 
The positive effect of IPT (relative to TAU within the school setting) was particularly strong 
for adolescents who reported at baseline higher levels of conflict with their mothers and 
more difficulties in their peer relationships (Gunlicks-Stoessel et al., 2010), providing 
indirect support for a compensation model of IPT response.

Moderators of family-based intervention effects—To date, there is no evidence for 
differential efficacy of family therapy, alone, as a function of moderating variables. Three 
trials examined demographic factors, symptom severity, lifetime suicidality, cognitive 
distortions, hopelessness, family conflict, family environment, and history of sexual trauma 
as potential moderators, but none of these analyses reached statistical significance (Barbe et 
al., 2004b; Brent et al., 1998; Diamond et al., 2012; Rohde et al., 2014).

Evidence of Mediation

Despite 30 years of clinical trial research in youth depression, we were able to find only six 
studies meeting our entry criteria (Ackerson, Scogin, McKendree-Smith, & Lyman, 1998; 
Kolko et al., 2000; Kaufman et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2009; Jacobs et al., 2009; Stice, 
Rohde, Seeley, & Gau, 2010) that formally tested whether the processes hypothesized to 
drive intervention effects statistically mediated the impact of intervention on depression 
outcomes. All five studies focused on CBT for depressed adolescents and relied on youth

self-report of cognitive (five studies), behavioral (two studies), and motivational (one study) 
processes, and, more often than not, the design or results of the mediation tests left 
directionality of effects unclear (i.e., failure to establish temporal precedence of changes). 
Furthermore, the six studies utilized different CBT treatment protocols that varied in their 
relative focus on cognitive versus behavioral techniques, involvement of family members, 
and number of sessions, and the trials had very different inclusion criteria in terms of level 
of severity and comorbidity.

It is not surprising that this limited pool of studies has not yielded a definitive set of results. 
Cognitive and behavioral change may be related to change in depression symptoms, but 
these findings are not consistent across studies or measures of processes. In a trial of 
cognitive bibliotherapy for teens with mild depression seen in primary care, Ackerson and 
colleagues (1998) found that change in dysfunctional attitudes (DAS), but not negative 
automatic thoughts (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire [ATQ]; Hollon & Kendall, 1980), 
significantly mediated the effects of the intervention on youth-reported depression 
symptoms only and not for other measures of depression (i.e., interviewer ratings). 
Conversely, Kaufman et al. (2005) found non-significant results for the DAS but small 
significant effects on the ATQ in a secondary analysis examining the process and outcome of 
CBT adapted for youth with depression and comorbid conduct disorder. In this trial, 
depressed teens involvement in pleasant activities improved in both CBT and the life skills 
tutoring intervention, and, thus, the mediating role of this behavioral process was not tested.

Stice and colleagues (2010) found stronger support for the mediating role of cognitive and 
behavioral change in an indicated prevention sample of high symptom adolescents. In this 
trial, the CB prevention program significantly lowered depression symptom scores compared 
to supportive therapy and bibliotherapy control conditions. Reduction in depressogenic 
thinking (ATQ) and increased involvement in pleasant activities statistically mediated CB 
intervention effects; however, using data from a mid-point assessment, it appeared that 
changes in depression symptoms temporally preceded change in the putative mediators. 
Furthermore, the CB condition also significantly impacted mediators that were designed to 
be theoretically specific to the supportive therapy control, undermining the hypothesis that 
CB “worked” through cognitive processes.

In the TADS trial, cognitive style (DAS perfectionism subscale) also statistically mediated 
superior effects of combination treatment over CBT and placebo on interviewer-rated 
depression symptoms (Jacobs et al., 2009). Although this finding is consistent with a 
mediating role for cognitive change in CBT effects, this conclusion is weakened by (a) the 
overall poor effects of CBT alone in TADS on both the outcomes and mediator, and (b) poor 
evidence of temporal precedence showing cognitive change before symptom outcome. Also 
within the TADS dataset, Lewis and colleagues (2009) examined changes in motivational 
factors as potential mediators of depression outcome. In their analysis, changes in “readiness 
to change” (self-report of action orientation) between baseline and the midpoint of treatment 
was significantly higher for youths in the COMB (CBT+SSRI) and CBT arms of the study 
compared to medication alone and placebo, and change in action orientation partially 
mediated the effects of COMB on depression symptoms at post-treatment. As with the 
analyses of Jacobs et al (2009), temporal change between action orientation and depression

symptoms was unclear. Further, data were not provided linking analyses across these 
mediator papers within the same trial.

Kolko and colleagues’ (2000) reanalysis of the Brent et al. (1997) comparative trial of 
cognitive, family, and supportive therapy aimed to test mediation using a different cognitive 
measure (Children’s Negative Cognitive Errors Questionnaire; Leitenberg, Yost, & Carroll-
Wilson, 1986). However, missing data across measures of mediators and outcome appeared 
to compromise power, and mediation analyses were cut short by the lack of a primary effect 
of treatment on depression symptoms (the main trial reported significant effects favoring 
CBT over alternate treatments). As in Stice et al. (2010), the Kolko paper also showed 
evidence of nonspecific effects of CBT. While mediation analyses were not completed, CBT 
did have a specific, superior effect on cognitive style compared to family and supportive 
therapy, but CBT also significantly impacted marital conflict and parental behavior control, 
both of which were designed to be theoretically specific to family therapy.

The field still awaits empirical data on the mechanisms of action of IPT and family-based 
interventions. Many clinical trials of these treatments have included measures of processes, 
such as interpersonal functioning, that may well function as mediators; however, these 
measures have only been evaluated as post-treatment outcomes, and statistical tests of 
mediation have not been conducted. In general, it appears that both IPT and family therapy 
significantly impact interpersonal and family variables at post-treatment (for review, see 
Weersing, Rozenman, & Gonzalez, 2009), but it is unclear if these effects are theoretically 
specific or whether change in these potential processes occurs as a result of change in 
depressive symptoms.

DISCUSSION

In this report, we sought to update and re-evaluate the empirical status of psychosocial 
treatments for depression in youth. Our methods were largely similar to past, foundational 
reviews in 1998 and 2008 with three key differences, namely: (a) adopting theories over 
manuals as the primary unit of analysis, (b) focusing on treatment of clinically significant 
depression rather than including a broader sample of depression prevention studies in at-risk 
and subsyndromal youth, and (c) considering the balance of positive, negative, and null 
findings when evaluating interventions and classifying their level of support. We applied 
these criteria when searching for new trials and 14 novel investigations met all entry criteria 
(also see Table 1). We also re-evaluated studies published during the window of previous 
EBT reviews, and both excluded a number of investigations reviewed previously (18; see 
Table 2) and included trials that had been previously omitted (8). As a result, the youth 
depression evidence base evaluated in this review differed considerably from past reports, 
varying by 40 primary outcome papers. In line with trends in effect sizes in the depression 
meta-analyses (see Weisz et al., 2006), results of the current review suggest the evidence 
base supporting depression treatments in youth is more modest than suggested by past 
reports. Our conclusions, however, were broadly in keeping with central messages of prior 
reviews. First, cognitive behavioral therapy continued to be the best-supported treatment 
model in the evidence base, and, second, evidence supporting treatments for depression in 
children was weak overall and notably worse than evidence for adolescent interventions.

CBT was clearly the dominant intervention model in the literature. Across individual and 
group formats, CBT met criteria as a well-established intervention for adolescents with 
depression, and group-based CBT reached possibly efficacious status for the treatment of 
depressed children (no child treatments were rated more highly than this level). This 
dominance rested largely on the number of CBT trials and replications rather than purely on 
the strength of individual trial findings. As a case in point, there were 27 CBT trials for 
depressed teens versus 6 trials of IPT; CBT had a larger absolute number of positive findings 
replicated across investigative teams, although the positive “hit rate” was higher for the 
smaller IPT literature (5/6 versus 15/27 for CBT). As a function of this larger primary 
outcome literature, CBT for adolescent depression also had substantially more evidence on 
moderators of effects, with data suggesting that the model has been broadly generalizable 
across demographic factors and robust to comorbidity (see Table 8). Data were less clear on 
whether CBT was robust to other forms of clinical complexity, and effects were attenuated 
in analyses probing teen trauma history (Asarnow, Emslie, et al., 2009; Barbe et al., 2004a; 
Lewis et al., 2010; Shamseddeen et al., 2011), concurrent maternal depression (Brent et al., 
1998; cf. Curry et al., 2006), high stressful life events (Gau et al., 2012), and low income 
(Curry et al., 2006).

These findings dovetail with poor results for CBT in many effectiveness studies when 
compared to other community interventions. CBT did not perform well when (a) delivered 
as a training intervention to community mental health workers and compared to their usual 
services (Kerfoot et al., 2004), (b) implemented in child guidance clinics and compared to 
usual community care (Weisz et al., 2009), (c) delivered in a health maintenance 
organization as a brief CBT+SSRI intervention and compared to SSRI alone (Clarke et al., 
2005), or (d) embedded in the National Health Service in the United Kingdom as a 
combined CBT+SSRI model and compared to SSRI alone (Goodyer et al., 2008). The 
exception to this troubling pattern of dissemination findings is the success of CBT for 
adolescent depression when delivered as part of a collaborative care model in primary care 
(Asarnow et al., 2005; Richardson et al., 2014). These primary care designs make it difficult 
to evaluate the effect of CBT relative to other components of the collaborative care package; 
however, difficulty in determining mechanisms of treatment action was not unique to 
primary care studies. Data on mediation processes in CBT was sparse and mixed (at best), 
and little appears to be known about which cognitive or behavioral processes might be 
responsible for the effects of the intervention model. Poor understanding of the mechanisms 
of CBT is problematic theoretically and links to the question of effectiveness. If the core 
processes of an intervention model are unknown, there is little scientific basis to guide 
improvements to the treatment when poor effects are observed in practice settings (e.g., 
community guidance clinics) or in the presence of a significant “real world” moderator (e.g., 
poverty, trauma exposure). Full discussion of these issues are beyond the scope of the 
current review but have been commented on extensively by others (e.g., Kazdin & Nock, 
2003; Weersing, Rozenman, & Gonzalez, 2009), and research on mechanisms of depression 
treatment action, including for models other than CBT, remains a critical area for additional 
research.

Additional research also appears to be sorely needed to shore up the evidence for child 
depression treatment. As in previous reviews, we found the child literature to be smaller,

methodologically weaker, and reporting notably poorer effects than the adolescent 
depression research base. Unsurprisingly, the child literature was strongly impacted by the 
more stringent inclusion criteria for the current review. Of the 18 studies included in prior 
reports but excluded from our review, 12 focused on children. As a result, no child 
depression treatment currently met criteria for well-established or probably efficacious, and 
the evidence base for individual child CBT became sufficiently thin that the modality was 
re-classified as experimental. This was due in large part to the exclusion of studies 
conducted in child samples that did not clearly meet criteria for having clinically significant 
depression (e.g., studies supporting the Penn Prevention Program). While these RCTs fell 
outside the scope of our review of treatment for depressed children, results from many of 
these sub-syndrome studies were promising, and these intervention models exist as a 
preventive resource and a potential base for future treatment development. However, the 
evidentiary status of child treatments was also strongly impacted by (a) the inclusion of null 
trials in clinical samples excluded from previous reports and (b) our decision to evaluating 
the balance of evidence (including mixed findings within trials) when evaluating the status 
of an intervention.

Given the mixed effects for extant treatments, it also may be worth debating whether child 
depression research should move forward in a straight path from its current foundation or re-
evaluate the models of intervention needed to successfully treat depression in pre-pubertal 
youth. There are data to suggest that childhood depression may not be of a piece with 
adolescent and adult mood disorder. At a gross level, total prevalence rates and prevalence 
by gender vary dramatically between childhood and later developmental periods; there is 
poorer continuity of childhood depression compared to the strong link between adolescent 
depression and recurrent mood disorder in adulthood, and genetic investigations have 
suggested lower heritability for childhood depression and stronger environmental influence 
(for review see Rutter, Kim-Cohen, & Maughan, 2006). The heightened environmental 
aspect of childhood depression and younger children’s greater dependence on caregivers for 
assistance with the basic tasks of treatment (such as completing therapy homework) may 
suggest value in investigating parent-mediated interventions; however, family-based models 
have not had a strong track record in the literature to date, with the exception of ABFT for 
teens. Outcomes are not yet available from a recent intriguing study of developmentally-
based intervention designed to teach pre-pubertal depressed youth (age 7–12) emotion 
regulation strategies, using parents as coaches and models for how to cope with 
environmental stress and disruptions in positive mood, adaptively reduce dysphoria, and 
return to a more stable mood state (Kovacs et al., 2012). New work adapting IPT for children 
also may prove fruitful in this regard. Preliminary studies of family-based IPT (FB-IPT) for 
preadolescents with depression suggest it is well tolerated by families, with high compliance 
with the tasks of treatment (Dietz, Mufson, Irvine, & Brent, 2008), and a recent trial 
suggests significant impact on depression outcomes compared to a supportive therapy 
control (Dietz et al., 2015).

Although this review explicitly adopted a model-based approach to evaluating interventions, 
we can imagine a productive move toward greater specificity in the next generation of 
depression treatment research. We do not envision this as being specific at the level of 
individual manuals but rather a greater focus on techniques, mechanisms, and processes of

disorder (and subtypes of disorder). The category of CBT includes a dizzying array of 
specific techniques targeting cognitive and behavioral processes, and CBT manuals may be 
implemented in such a way as to have very little overlap in the content covered (see 
Weersing, Rozenman, & Gonzalez, 2009). Conversely, it may well be that putatively distinct 
models, such as IPT, share active elements with some CBT approaches such as problem-
solving and coaching in social skills and assertiveness. Indeed, a component analysis of a 
multi-technique CBT manual has suggested that emphasis on the more generic skills of 
problem solving and social skills training may be associated with enhanced positive 
outcomes, even within the context of other active CBT elements (Kennard et al., 2009). 
Response rates for “active” interventions for depression in childhood and in adolescence are 
quite similar, and meta-analytic evidence on treatment effects in youth and adulthood 
suggest that a ceiling may have been reached with current depression treatments (or that 
early effects may have been over-estimates; Weisz, McCarty, & Valeri, 2006; Johnsen & 
Friborg, 2015; Driessen, Hollon, Bockting, Cuijpers, & Turner, 2015). As the field continues 
to mature, we see value in searching for these change mechanisms within treatments as a 
path for refining and strengthening the interventions available for child and adolescent 
depression.

The field would also benefit from additional research on (a) stepping or matching care to the 
clinical severity and complexity of depressed youths and (b) addressing long-term efficacy 
of interventions and prevention of relapse. Our analysis of the predictor and moderator 
literature was promising, but substantially limited by the small number of studies including 
such analyses. All data understanding variability in response come from studies of 
adolescents, which may be especially problematic given the pressing need to enhance effects 
within the child literature (new child treatment targets identified through such analyses 
would be a boon). Also of note, two of the eight trials providing moderator results were 
investigations that included medication and CBT+medication combination conditions 
(TADS, 2004; Brent et al., 2006). Throughout our review, we highlighted the effects of CBT 
in these studies given the overall focus of this report on psychosocial interventions. 
However, efficacy data from both trials provide solid support for the combination of CBT 
and antidepressant medication in the treatment of moderately to severely depressed youths, 
with the TORDIA trial analyses suggesting adding adjunctive CBT to medication 
management procedures may be especially valuable at higher levels of clinical severity 
(Asarnow et al. 2009). It is currently unclear at what threshold of severity would adoption of 
combination approach be justified versus selection of a well-established psychosocial 
treatment for adolescent depression. Further, the reduced response rates for CBT in the 
presence of serious comorbidity (e.g., Rohde et al., 2014) may call for enhanced 
interventions to adequately serve multi-problem youth for whom depression is one of many 
major, clinically impairing problems. The trial of combined FFT and CBT for teens with 
comorbid depression and substance abuse, suggested that depression outcomes were not 
particularly sensitive to the order of intervention components, but substance outcomes and 
retention may differ significantly depending on not simply the content but the order of 
interventions. Work by John Weisz and colleagues (Weisz et al., 2012) on modular 
approaches to treating multi-problem youths with depression, anxiety, and/or conduct 
problems has raised the intriguing possibility that community therapist may be able to

reliably deliver personalized treatment components, under supervision, and enhance 
outcomes compared to usual care, although results specific to youths with clinically elevated 
levels of depression have not been published. At the other end of the severity spectrum, CBT 
delivered as a component of collaborative care models within primary care was a stand-out 
in terms of treatment effectiveness (as was IPT in school-based clinics; Mufson et al., 2004). 
Better data on when, how, where, and to whom to guide specific depression treatments is 
necessary in order to move toward a public health approach to treatment matching and 
effective delivery.

It is also unclear what models of intervention would best serve depressed children and 
adolescents over the long-term. In this report we provided a brief summary of effects of our 
included trials over follow-up. For treatment (versus prevention) studies, significant 
differences between active intervention and control faded over follow-up, an unsurprising 
outcome given the cyclical nature of untreated depressive disorder (see Kovacs, 1996). The 
cyclical pattern of depression also suggests these youths will experience high rates of relapse 
and recurrence. While full discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of the current review, 
long-term, non-experimental follow-ups of treated youth suggest little to no protective effect 
of successful short-term acute treatments (see Birmaher et al., 2000), a difference between 
the youth and adult treatment literatures. Findings from the prevention literature are perhaps 
more promising. Within our pool of prevention studies targeting youth with clinically 
elevated symptoms (but not yet meeting criteria for disorder), interventions demonstrated 
significant effects as long as 24 months after baseline. Recent long-term data from the large 
Prevention of Depression (POD) trial focusing on the offspring of mood disordered parents 
suggest that CBT may be able to alter the developmental trajectory of at-risk adolescents, 
with differences in depression episodes and functioning observed six years after program 
implementation (Brent et al., 2015). Youths in the POD trial were especially likely to benefit 
when the intervention was given at “moments of wellness” -- when teens were high 
functioning, more hopeful, less anxious, and less exposed to their own parents’ depression 
(Weersing et al., 2015; Garber et al., 2015). The majority of youths in the POD trial had 
experienced previous episodes of depression, suggesting the lessons learned from this 
prevention study may be highly applicable to work on continuation models of treatment and 
relapse prevention (e.g., Kennard et al., 2014).

Overall, results of the current review are sobering in many respects, especially for the 
treatment of depression in children, and are in line with trends in the depression literature 
toward smaller effect sizes and less consistency in effects. Across all domains, much work 
remains to be done to develop, test, and implement effective interventions for depressed 
children and adolescents capable of producing enduring positive outcomes.

Review criteria for evidence base updates in Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology

TABLE 1

Methods Criteria

M.1. Group design: Study involved a randomized controlled design

M.2. Independent variable defined: Treatment manuals or logical equivalent were used for the treatment

M.3. Population clarified: Conducted with a population, treated for specified problems, for whom inclusion criteria have been clearly 
delineated

M.4. Outcomes assessed: Reliable and valid outcome assessment measures gauging the problems targeted (at a minimum) were used

M.5. Analysis adequacy: Appropriate data analyses were used and sample size was sufficient to detect expected effects*

Evaluation of Treatments

Level 1: Well-Established Treatments

Evidence criteria

1.1 Efficacy demonstrated for the treatment by showing the treatment to be either:

1.1.a. Statistically significantly superior to pill or psychological placebo or to another active treatment

OR

1.1.b. Equivalent (or not significantly different) to an already well-established treatment in experiments*

AND

1.1.c. In at least two (2) independent research settings and by two (2) independent investigatory teams demonstrating efficacy

AND

1.2 All five (5) of the Methods Criteria

Level 2: Probably Efficacious Treatments

Evidence criteria

2.1 There must be at least two good experiments showing the treatment is superior (statistically significantly so) to a wait-list control group

OR

2.2 One or more good experiments meeting the Well-Established Treatment level except for criterion 1.1.c. (i.e., Level 2 treatments will not 
involve independent investigatory teams)

AND

2.3 All five (5) of the Methods Criteria

Level 3: Possibly Efficacious Treatments

Evidence criteria

3.1 At least one good randomized controlled trial showing the treatment to be superior to a wait list or no-treatment control group

AND

3.2 All five (5) of the Methods Criteria

OR

3.3 Two or more clinical studies showing the treatment to be efficacious, with two or more meeting the last four (of five) Methods Criteria, but 
none being randomized controlled trials*

Level 4: Experimental Treatments

Evidence criteria

4.1 Not yet tested in a randomized controlled trial*

OR

4.2 Tested in 1 or more clinical studies but not sufficient to meet level 3 criteria.*

Level 5: Treatments of Questionable Efficacy

5.1 Tested in good group-design experiments and found to be inferior to other treatment group and/or wait-list control group; i.e., only evidence 
available from experimental studies suggests the treatment produces no beneficial effect.

Note:

*

The current review varied from these criteria in three ways: (a) adjusting for small sample sizes in effect size calculation rather than screening out 
low sample studies, (b) requiring all included studies to be randomized, thus eliminating criteria 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2, and (c) more broadly, considering 
the balance of evidence between positive and negative studies when mixed findings were present in the literature (e.g., positive results in one good 
experiment not outweighing a pattern of mixed findings.
