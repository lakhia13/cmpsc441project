Abstract: Globally, the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasing.
The treatment for ADHD is multifaceted and requires long-term care and support. Pharmacists are
capable of assisting patients and their caretakers in achieving desired outcomes. This work discusses
and summarizes pharmacists’ roles in ADHD care and their associated outcomes. Overall, pharmacists
are positioned to educate on ADHD, optimize medications in a collaborative practice model, manage
and monitor side effects, and provide remote and virtual pharmaceutical care. Pharmacists could
directly contribute to ensuring medication safety and increasing awareness regarding the optimal use
of ADHD medications. Patients with ADHD can benefit from pharmacist involvement in a variety of
ways, including, but not limited to, initial screening and referral, the provision of clinical consultation
and feedback, and the improvement of self-management and self-awareness of the illness. Pharmacists
also play a significant role in therapeutic decision making regarding the initiation, intensification, and
monitoring of ADHD treatment to ensure its effectiveness and quality of life improvement. Lastly,
pharmacists could help identify more cost-effective treatment approaches for ADHD patients based
on the clinical scenario that is encountered.

1. Introduction

Over the last few decades, there has been an exponential increase in the overall preva-
lence of mental disorders [1]. Globally, healthcare professionals use the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), as an ofﬁcial guide to classify
and diagnose mental disorders [2]. It provides a shared vocabulary for healthcare profes-
sionals to discuss with their patients and offers concise and precise criteria to objectively
assess symptom presentations in various clinical settings [2].

Patients with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may experience a va-
riety of adverse outcomes, and they are more likely to have children with ADHD due
to the genetic components of the condition [3]. There is also a genetic link that could
explain the co-existence of other neuropsychiatric disorders among cases of ADHD [4].
Furthermore, several factors related to parents, such as maternal polycystic ovary syn-
drome, were found to increase the odds of ADHD in their offspring, according to a recent
meta-analysis [5]. Moreover, the development of ADHD outcomes was affected by the
parenting stress that modulates adverse childhood experiences, especially among families
with low resilience levels [6].

ADHD has a chronic impact on patients’ social and functional abilities and their risk
of developing other comorbidities [7]. Adults with ADHD have a higher rate of unemploy-
ment and turnover, and they are more likely to have tried multiple careers before ﬁnding

one that suits them [3]. In addition, adults with persistent ADHD symptoms who have not
been treated with medication are at a higher risk of drug and substance dependence.

Because of their more frequent interactions with patients, pharmacists seem to be
among the ﬁrst healthcare professionals to encounter ADHD patients in their practice,
particularly in community settings [7]. Pharmacists are increasingly seeing patients with
neuropsychiatric illnesses; when properly trained, they feel more conﬁdent intervening
to improve the care delivered to these patients [8]. When patients of varying ages express
concerns about their prescribed ADHD pharmacotherapies, pharmacists should reassure
them regarding the role of pharmacotherapy in controlling their condition [7]. The con-
tribution of pharmacists to the clinical care of ADHD patients has been associated with
improvements in the quality of care [9]. Given the overall increase in ADHD prevalence
and the valuable care pharmacists could provide to ADHD patients, the purpose of this
paper is to discuss and highlight the most recent evidence supporting pharmacists’ roles in
the clinical care of ADHD patients and the outcomes associated with these roles.

2. ADHD Treatment

The goal of ADHD treatment is to enhance the patient’s functioning, learning, and
ADHD symptoms [10]. The treatment available for ADHD includes behavioral, dietary,
and pharmacotherapy interventions. In this section, essential information regarding the
different treatment approaches is presented.

2.1. Behavioral Approaches

Psychoeducation, a therapeutic ADHD-focused parent-training program that provides
information, support, and coping skills to the patient and their family, is recommended as
the ﬁrst-line intervention, particularly in children under ﬁve years [11]. In a randomized
control study by Daley et al. involving 57 children, parenting programs improved parenting
efﬁcacy and child social performance [12]. The dissemination of information about ADHD
is vital for spreading awareness and understanding the disorder, thereby overcoming
the stigma towards ADHD patients. Parents aware of ADHD are more likely to accept
and adhere to their child’s treatment [13]. In addition, by incorporating elements of the
theory of planned behaviors, psychoeducation was found to have a positive impact on
parents’ knowledge about ADHD and improve their intention to adhere to prescribed
pharmacotherapy [14]. For better clinical outcomes, evidence has shown that pharmacists
can adopt and design psychoeducational programs to improve medication adherence
among patients with mental disorders in the primary care setting [15].

Furthermore, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a behavioral therapy that recog-
nizes and targets speciﬁc maladaptive cognitions and behaviors that cause psychological
distress and dysfunction [16]. Psychoeducation, organizational/planning, distractibility,
adaptive thinking, procrastination, and relapse prevention are all covered in CBT sessions,
which should be led by qualiﬁed professionals [17]. A randomized controlled study in-
volving 26 adults with ADHD measured the efﬁcacy of CBT. The ﬁndings highlighted that
both younger and older adults receiving CBT showed signiﬁcant improvement regarding
inattention, executive dysfunction, and comorbidity [18]. The success of CBT in lowering
the severity of symptoms is probably because CBT teaches patients speciﬁc strategies to
tackle these thinking patterns and promote positive behavioral changes.

Neurofeedback, often known as “NF”, involves measuring an individual’s brain waves
and giving them a feedback signal to educate them on how to exercise self-control over their
brain activities [19]. A randomized controlled trial found that NF signiﬁcantly reduced
ADHD symptoms, which remained consistent at a six-month follow-up [20]. However,
there is insufﬁcient evidence to support the use of NF in the standard treatment of ADHD.

2.2. Dietary Approaches

Dietary modiﬁcation for ADHD is divided into elimination and supplementation
diets. The elimination diet excludes artiﬁcial food coloring, additives, sugar, and artiﬁcial

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2754

3 of 13

sweeteners, and the few-foods diet (FFD) relies on a small number of food items (two types
of meat, two sources of carbohydrates, two vegetables, two fruits, oil, and water) for
a deﬁnite period [21]. The evidence to support the long-term effectiveness of FFD is
inconclusive [11].

On the other hand, a supplementation diet involves the addition of amino acids,
essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. In a study that included 47 newly ADHD-
diagnosed children and investigated the impact of a 5-week dietary modiﬁcation program,
the ﬁndings showed that dietary modiﬁcations, including hypoallergenic foods, a wide
range of vegetables, and reduced carbohydrate and protein intake, were associated with
improvement in ADHD symptoms [22]. Despite these ﬁndings, there is a lack of evidence
to support the recommendation of speciﬁc dietary modiﬁcations as part of a standard
ADHD treatment plan.

Overall, with quality education and training related to dietary supplements, pharma-
cists could have a crucial role in supporting appropriate and safe dietary supplement use
among diverse groups of patients, including those with neuropsychiatric conditions [23].
However, this particular role has to be supported by clear professional responsibilities and
resources to guide pharmacists’ safe and practical involvement in dietary supplement use
in the community [24]. Table 1 outlines the overall treatment approaches for ADHD.

ADHD pharmacotherapy includes several therapeutic choices, including stimulants
such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, noradrenergic drugs such as atomoxetine, and
alpha-2A-adrenergic agonists such as guanfacine and clonidine (Table 2). For children aged
ﬁve years and older and young people with ADHD, methylphenidate is the ﬁrst line of
treatment [11]. In general, atomoxetine and methylphenidate have similar effectiveness
in improving social adjustment in youths with ADHD [25]. In another study by Roh and
Kim, it was found that patients tolerate the osmotic-controlled oral delivery system (OROS)
of methylphenidate better than extended-release methylphenidate, immediate-release
methylphenidate, or atomoxetine [26]. In addition, parents were also more satisﬁed with
the OROS methylphenidate formulation. The satisfaction was rated using the Satisfaction
with Medication Scale and detailed questions about symptom severity, dysfunction, and
quality of life. However, for patients who cannot tolerate methylphenidate or do not
respond after six weeks of treatment with methylphenidate, after alternative preparations

and adequate doses have been considered, atomoxetine can be used [11]. Table 2 shows

3. Pharmacists’ Roles

In general, clinical pharmacy gains more attention and characterizes pharmacists’
main role in providing services such as medication reconciliation, therapeutic education,
and taking part in multidisciplinary teams to help optimize pharmacotherapeutic decisions
for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders [28]. Concerning ADHD, pharmacists can play
various roles in providing pharmaceutical care to patients with ADHD of various ages
or at various stages of the disorder. Before conﬁrming the diagnosis, pharmacists could
notice potential ADHD symptoms through casual conversation or a more comprehensive
consultation with a patient or caretaker and then refer the patient to receive a more formal
evaluation from medical specialists. Following an ADHD diagnosis, the pharmacist can
be a valuable resource for the patient regarding information and support, particularly if
the patient or family struggles with a new diagnosis of ADHD due to the stigma linked to
mental disorders or the stigma associated with using ADHD medication [7]. Pharmacists
are also in the right place to provide medication management services for patients with
ADHD and their caretakers to help them maximize the clinical beneﬁt and manage the
anticipated adverse outcomes [7]. Figure 1 displays pharmacist’s major roles in treating
ADHD and its associated outcomes.

3.1. ADHD Education

Previous research has highlighted several knowledge gaps regarding ADHD and its
treatment and suggested that further education to raise awareness of ADHD is needed [29].
With sufﬁcient knowledge provided to patients with ADHD or their guardians, they
are more adherent to their medications and eventually help mitigate the symptoms of
ADHD [30]. Medication adherence is critical in controlling disease, resolving temporary
conditions, ensuring long-term health, and improving patients’ quality of life [31]. Ul-
timately, pharmacists could play a major role in educating the guardians or parents of
ADHD patients, answering the physicians’ inquiries in choosing the right agent to treat the
patient, and designing the pharmacotherapeutic regimen and monitoring plan [32]. ADHD
education by pharmacists can help patients to better understand ADHD management,
particularly in terms of medication side effects, the onset of action, the instructions on
administration, monitoring frequency, and requirements [9].

Educational interventions may come in a spectrum of forms and use varied plat-
forms [33]. In a study by Lavielle et al. (2018), educational interventions were classiﬁed
into two types: those through electronic platforms and those through hard copies of re-
sources [34]. An educational intervention that covers available treatment options for ADHD
and engages patients and caretakers in composing the treatment regimens is more likely to
improve the quality of ADHD care [30]. A lack of such engagement and shared decision
making could eventually increase concerns regarding the prescribed treatment and the
medication regimen burden [35].

A study carried out among Toronto pharmacists observed that the majority of phar-
macists were not very familiar with ADHD medications and management, indicating
that many pharmacists still need further support to equip them with the essential knowl-
edge and skills [36]. To build capacity among pharmacists to undertake this essential
educational role, it is critical to provide disease-speciﬁc training that includes the latest

evidence-based clinical guidelines [37]. As with other healthcare professionals, pharmacists
are required to take part in continuous professional development (CPD) and stay up to
date on disease-speciﬁc information and recommendations that help them provide optimal
patient care [38].

3.2. Optimization of Medications in a Collaborative Practice Model

The optimization of medicines assists patients in terms of medication adherence,
long-term management, multiple morbidities, and polypharmacy [39]. Examples of the
approaches used by pharmacists include (i) reviewing patients’ lists of prescribed medi-
cations, (ii) meticulously discussing every medicine with the patient, and (iii) reviewing
the patient’s medications together with their clinical medical records and discussing the
intended outcomes of the reviews [40].

Non-adherence to prescribed medications among ADHD patients is a multifactorial
issue, and one of the reasons is that patients are not fully aware of the optimal way to
manage the disease and the prescribed pharmacotherapy [41]. It is predicted that it takes
approximately four months for patients to discontinue their medications in children with
ADHD aged 12 to 18 years old, so targeted interventions and education need to be provided
to children and caregivers to promote adherence [42]. It is the role of pharmacists to be able
to provide knowledge to caretakers as well as patients about the negative consequences of a
missed dose, explaining the proper method of consuming prescribed medications and what
to avoid, especially the improper use of medications and potential overdose situations [43].
As for younger ADHD patients, a simpler explanation about their illness and the prescribed
medications is appropriate, while as they get older, a more complex explanation of the
essential aspects of monitoring and long-term medication management becomes critical to
helping them cope with their daily functional demands [37].

Pharmacists can collaborate with psychiatrists to provide independent follow-up in
ADHD clinics. Integrating clinical pharmacists into an ADHD specialty clinic improves
patients’ adherence to ADHD treatment [44]. Initially, pharmacists visited patients collabo-
ratively with a psychiatrist and then conducted independent follow-ups with the patients.
Over the three years of intervention, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the number of
appointments, an improvement in adherence to monitoring blood pressure and heart rate,
and more willingness to adhere to a clinic policy that required patients’ signatures for
stimulant medication.

Furthermore, the experience of a pharmacist-led interprofessional ADHD clinic in a
large integrated healthcare system found that the clinic has successfully shown improve-
ments in terms of cost and efﬁciency of operations, and a large portion of patients reported
positive outcomes in terms of fulﬁlling the ADHD clinic service, achieving a stabilization
point, and not being re-referred to the same facility within 1 year [45]. Patients’ experiences
were more likely to improve when they were involved in deciding on the best care for
themselves [46]. Moreover, it is encouraged to provide patients with a simpler regimen,
as it can promote better medication adherence [47,48]. Apart from that, the improvement
in patients’ medication adherence also helps to lower the treatment cost for patients due
to their increased reliance on relatively lower-cost ADHD medications. This is consistent
with the most recent NICE guideline, which states that pharmacists should devise a more
cost-effective medication regimen when optimizing medication use [39].

3.3. Management and Monitoring of Side Effects

Some individuals may develop unfavorable adverse effects, necessitating adminis-
tration, dose, or medicine modiﬁcation. Pharmacists may ﬁnd the ADHD rating scale
useful in closely monitoring the effects of medicine on the core symptoms of inattention,
hyperactivity, and impulsivity [49]. The side effects of pharmacological medicines used to
treat ADHD in children and adolescents ranged from sleeplessness and decreased appetite
to headaches, tiredness, sorrow, and euphoria [50]. Adults who used methylphenidate or
amphetamines typically had headaches, reduced appetite, and sleeplessness [51]. In the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2754

7 of 13

United Kingdom, a recent study of the prescribing trends for ADHD medications and the
reporting of the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR) revealed that guanfacine had the
greatest number of reports for serious or fatal ADR incidents. In contrast, methylphenidate
recorded the fewest severe or fatal ADR events in the same year [52].

From the pharmacists’ point of view, a Canadian study highlighted that about 67% of
pharmacists believe that psychostimulants are the most common cause of initial insom-
nia. Interestingly, community pharmacists had signiﬁcantly higher knowledge of ADHD
compared to hospital pharmacists, which might be caused by the lower number of ADHD
patients encountered by hospital pharmacists [36]. According to the Canadian ADHD Re-
source Alliance (CADDRA) recommendations, atomoxetine might beneﬁt ADHD individu-
als experiencing worsening sleep issues, although it could still induce early insomnia [53].
Melatonin was the non-prescription medication for sleep disorders most commonly recom-
mended by pharmacists [36]. Accordingly, the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG)
recommended providing melatonin above the normally dispensed range (up to 5–6 mg per
night) to help improve total sleep time [54].

A pharmacist must recognize how stimulants inﬂuence appetite and growth in chil-
dren with ADHD. Children using stimulants should have their height and weight assessed
regularly, such as semi-annually [45]. Both stimulants and atomoxetine cause rare but seri-
ous cardiovascular effects, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate [51]. Stimulants
should be used with caution in ADHD patients with pre-existing cardiac problems [53]. It is
important for pharmacists to the check blood pressure and heart rate at follow-up sessions,
examine medication adherence, evaluate adverse drug effects, assess mood changes, and
adjust the treatment plan, which may include ADHD, anxiety, and depression medica-
tions. Follow-up appointments were usually planned every two to four weeks until the
patient had reached a stable dosage, after which they were scheduled every one to three
months [55].

3.4. Provision of Remote and Virtual Care (Telepsychiatry Pharmacy Practice)

The use of technology in healthcare, including pharmacy practice, is well established
and covers many medical specialties [56]. The feasibility of an online intervention to help
parents take care of their children with ADHD has been proven [57]. It started to gain more
interest during the COVID-19 lockdown because it was associated with worsening ADHD
symptoms, including increased activity, irritation, and disruptive behavior [58]. As a result,
guidelines were issued to help healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, provide
ADHD pharmacotherapy services while adhering to strict measures during COVID-19 [54].
According to the EAGG guidelines, pharmacists are required to educate families
about the importance of reporting any symptoms related to the heart, such as palpitations,
shortness of breath, or chest discomfort, as soon as possible. Furthermore, the guidelines
recommend that all appointments involving initial assessments of children with ADHD
should continue, but they should be conducted remotely using videoconferencing or
telephone, in line with the telepsychiatry guidelines [54]. Table 3 provides an overview
of the recommendations made in the guidelines for the treatment of ADHD during the
pandemic, arranged in accordance with the management considerations highlighted in the
EAGG guidelines [54].

Telepsychiatry refers to using remote technology to assess and intervene while provid-
ing mental health services [59–61]. The “text message”-based intervention (three messages
per week for two weeks) was found to be acceptable for the management of ADHD patients
based on the participating parents’ responses [57]. In a review conducted to investigate the
usefulness of telepsychiatry in ADHD therapy, the ﬁndings suggested that telepsychiatry
might be a viable option for providing assessment- and evidence-based pharmacological
treatment for ADHD patients [62]. In addition, a randomized control trial evaluated the
feasibility of a telephone-assisted self-help intervention (TASH) for caregivers to manage
ADHD patients who were prescribed methylphenidate, and the ﬁndings showed that
caregivers were satisﬁed with the positive impact of the TASH intervention on medication

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2754

adherence and outcomes [63]. It is important to note that a pharmacist can follow the best
practices of videoconferencing for telemental health, which cover considerations about
technology settings, physical examinations, and telepsychiatry prescribing [64].

Non-adherence to medication usually occurs in late adolescence and is associated
with various adverse health outcomes, such as higher chances of injuries and emergency
department visits [65]. A telepsychiatry pharmacy practice can help increase medication
adherence among ADHD patients, especially those with transport problems. Currently,
this service is considered a novel service for ADHD treatment [45]. A study was conducted
to compare the outcomes of a pharmacist-led interprofessional ADHD clinic versus a
psychiatrist-led interprofessional ADHD clinic [45]. In the study, pharmacists started and
managed the patients’ medications via telephone until the patients were stable. After the
patients were stable, they were transitioned back into primary care and were not added to
the psychiatrist’s caseload. This innovative intervention yielded successful outcomes, with
only 3.7 telephone follow-ups needed per successful patient, with about one follow-up
every two weeks. In addition, this intervention was also cost-effective since the clinic saved
a huge amount of money and had more time to cater to more patients.

4. Associated Outcomes of Pharmacists’ Involvement in ADHD Care
4.1. Achievement of Clinical Outcomes

In a retrospective evaluation of introducing the collaborative model of pharmacists’
involvement in providing regular counseling and psychological services as a part of an in-
terprofessional team with psychiatrists, the ﬁndings showed improvements in adherence to
clinical monitoring and compliance with the medication-taking policy [44]. This initial eval-
uation highlighted that pharmacists could directly contribute to ensuring medication safety
and increasing awareness regarding the optimal use of ADHD medications. In addition,
pharmacists’ roles can help increase support for self-management and self-awareness about

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2754

the condition, initial screening and point of referral, and providing clinical consultation and
feedback to ADHD patients, thus helping them to achieve therapeutic outcomes [66]. It is
worth highlighting that telemental health consultations have been associated with greater
symptomatic and functional improvements and distress reduction compared to children
with ADHD receiving standard treatments [62]. This could be beneﬁcial when considering
the mode of engagement with ADHD patients and how it can affect the achievement of
clinical outcomes.

4.2. Improvement of Quality of Life

ADHD has a serious and negative impact on a child or adolescent’s health-related
quality of life (HRQOL). It has a moderate impact on the physical domain while having a
severe impact on the psychosocial domains, which include emotional, social, and school
interactions [67]. There is growing evidence to suggest that a successful and effective
treatment may be able to improve a patient’s quality of life [68]. Therefore, the role of
healthcare providers, including pharmacists, is critical in initiating, intensifying, and
monitoring ADHD treatment to ensure effectiveness and quality of life improvement.

4.3. Cost-Effectiveness

It is well established that patients with ADHD tend to have higher direct medical costs
compared to individuals without ADHD. According to one German analysis, the main
drivers of this increased cost are inpatient care, psychiatrists and psychotherapists, and
comorbidities such as anxiety, substance use disorders, and obesity [69]. In this scenario,
pharmacists are suited to provide pharmaceutical care services and follow-up to empower
patients to adhere to their medications, avoid medication-related harms, and manage the
comorbidities that may arise [7]. Furthermore, several analyses highlighted differences
in the cost-effectiveness of ADHD treatment modalities in different case scenarios [70,71].
Therefore, through their contribution to treatment decision making, pharmacists could help
guide the choice of cost-effective treatment plans for patients with ADHD.

5. Conclusions

In collaboration with other healthcare providers, pharmacists are ultimately respon-
sible for providing comprehensive ADHD education and support, selecting the most
appropriate treatment agent, optimizing the pharmacotherapeutic regimen, and devel-
oping a monitoring plan. Pharmacists’ involvement in ADHD care is associated with
better chances of achieving clinical outcomes, improving quality of life, and increasing the
chances of a cost-effective treatment plan. Though they are capable of performing these
responsibilities, it is imperative that they stay current on updates to the ADHD clinical
standards and recommendations.
