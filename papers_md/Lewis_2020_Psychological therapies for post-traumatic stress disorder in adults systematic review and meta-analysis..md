HIGHLIGHTS
(cid:129) This review informed the
latest ISTSS treatment
guidelines. It summarises
the current evidence-base in
relation to the effect of
specific therapies for PTSD.

ABSTRACT
Background: Psychological therapies are the recommended first-line treatment for post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous systematic reviews have grouped theoretically
similar
interventions to determine differences between broadly distinct approaches.
Consequently, we know little regarding the relative efficacy of the specific manualized
therapies commonly applied to the treatment of PTSD.
Objective: To determine the effect sizes of manualized therapies for PTSD.
Methods: We undertook a systematic review following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines.
A pre-determined definition of clinical importance was applied to the results and the quality
of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.
Results: 114 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of 8171 participants were included. There
was robust evidence that the therapies broadly defined as CBT with a trauma focus (CBT-T),
as well as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), had a clinically impor-
tant effect. The manualized CBT-Ts with the strongest evidence of effect were Cognitive
Processing Therapy (CPT); Cognitive Therapy (CT); and Prolonged Exposure (PE). There was
also some evidence supporting CBT without a trauma focus; group CBT with a trauma focus;
guided internet-based CBT; and Present Centred Therapy (PCT). There was emerging evi-
dence for a number of other therapies.
Conclusions: A recent increase in RCTs of psychological therapies for PTSD, results in a more
confident recommendation of CBT-T and EMDR as the first-line treatments. Among the CBT-
Ts considered by the review CPT, CT and PE should be the treatments of choice. The findings
should guide evidence informed shared decision-making between patient and clinician.

Terapias psicológicas para el trastorno de estrés postraumático en
adultos: revisión sistemática y metaanálisis
Objetivo: determinar los tamaños del efecto de las terapias manualizadas para el TEPT.
Métodos: Realizamos una revisión sistemática siguiendo las guías de la Colaboración
Cochrane. Se aplicó una definición predeterminada de importancia clínica a los resultados
y se evaluó la calidad de la evidencia utilizando el enfoque de calificación de recomenda-
ciones, evaluación, desarrollo y evaluaciones (GRADE).
Resultados: se incluyeron 114 ensayos controlados aleatorizados (ECA) de 8.171 partici-
pantes. Hubo evidencia robusta de que las terapias ampliamente definidas como TCC con
un enfoque de trauma (TCC-T), así como la desensibilización y reprocesamiento POR
movimientos oculares (EMDR), tuvieron un efecto clínicamente importante. Las CBT-Ts
manualizados con la mayor evidencia de efecto fueron la terapia de procesamiento cogni-
tivo (CPT); Terapia cognitiva (CT); y exposición prolongada (PE). También hubo alguna
evidencia que apoya la TCC sin un enfoque traumático; TCC grupal con enfoque en trauma;
TCC basada en Internet guiada; y terapia centrada en el presente (PCT). Hubo evidencia
emergente para una serie de otras terapias.
Conclusiones: Un aumento reciente en ECA de terapias psicológicas para el TEPT, da como
resultado una recomendación más confiable de CBT-T y EMDR como los tratamientos de
primera línea. Entre los CBT-Ts considerados por la revisión CPT, CT y PE deberían ser los
tratamientos de elección. Los hallazgos deben guiar la toma de decisiones compartida
informada por la evidencia entre el paciente y el médico.

1. Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common
mental disorder that can develop as a consequence of
(American
exposure to a serious traumatic event
Psychiatric
2013; World Health
Association,
Organisation, 2018). Diagnostic criteria for PTSD specify
the presence of symptoms including re-experiencing the
traumatic event; avoiding reminders of the trauma;
alterations in arousal and reactivity; and changes in cog-
nition and mood (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). PTSD is a debilitating disorder, which is com-
monly comorbid with other conditions such as depres-
sion, substance use and anxiety disorders (Kessler, 2000;
Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995).

Previous systematic reviews have converged on the
general finding that psychological therapies are effec-
tive for the treatment of PTSD (Bisson, Roberts,
Andrew, Cooper, & Lewis, 2013; Bradley, Greene,
Russ, Dutra, & Westen, 2005, Cusack, Grubaugh,
Knapp, & Frueh, 2006; Jonas et al., 2013, Watts et al.,
2013). Reviews to date have grouped psychological
therapies together based on similar theoretical under-
pinnings and overlapping techniques. A broad distinc-
tion has been made between therapies that focus on
the traumatic event and those that aim to reduce trau-
matic stress symptoms without directly targeting the
trauma memory or related thoughts, with the strongest
evidence for the effect of those with a trauma-focus
(Bisson et al., 2013; Bradley et al., 2005; Cusack et al.,
2006; Jonas et al., 2013). A further distinction has been
made based on the theoretical model from which
a therapy stems, for example, grouping those based
on cognitive behavioural principles. Despite the bene-
fits to the methodology in terms of detecting differ-
therapeutic
ences
approaches, categorizing interventions
for meta-
analysis has hindered the reporting of effect sizes for
specific manualized therapies.

broadly

A recent proliferation of randomized-controlled
trials (RCTs) has resulted in adequate data to move
beyond grouping therapies for meta-analysis, allowing
the estimation of effect sizes for specific manualized
therapies. In addition to the benefits of being able to
inform more detailed and precise treatment recommen-
dations, this approach may indicate the procedures
shared by the most effective interventions to inform
an understanding of the crucial components when

developing and modifying therapies. An in-depth
understanding is also required to aid patients and clin-
icians in the co-production of treatment plans. These
should take patient characteristics and preferences into
account, alongside the evidence-base for the many psy-
chological therapies currently available for the treat-
ment of PTSD in adults.

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review
and meta-analyses of RCTs of all psychological therapies
for PTSD. The aim was to determine effect sizes for
specific manualized therapies for PTSD and to apply
a pre-determined definition of clinically important effect
in order to inform a detailed understanding of the relative
efficacy of the specific psychological therapies commonly
applied to the treatment of PTSD. The review informed
the 2018 update of
the International Society for
Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) treatment guidelines
(ISTSS, 2018).

2. Method

2.1. Selection criteria

therapy aimed at

The review included RCTs of any defined psycholo-
gical
the reduction of PTSD-
symptoms in comparison with a control group (e.g.,
usual care/waiting list); other psychological therapy;
or psychosocial intervention (e.g., psychoeducation/
relaxation training). At least 70% of study partici-
pants were required to be diagnosed with PTSD
with a duration of 3 months or more, according to
DSM or ICD criteria determined by clinician diag-
nosis or an established diagnostic interview. This
review considered studies of adults aged 18 or over,
only. There were no restrictions based on symptom-
severity or trauma-type. The diagnosis of PTSD was
required to be primary, but there were no other
exclusions based on co-morbidity. Studies that con-
ducted secondary analyses of data already included in
the meta-analyses were excluded. Studies were also
excluded if a continuous measure of PTSD severity
post-treatment was not available.

2.2. Search strategy

This systematic review was undertaken alongside
a number of reviews for an update of the ISTSS
Treatment Guidelines (ISTSS, 2018). A search was

conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration, which
updated a previously published Cochrane review
with the same inclusion criteria, which was published
in 2013 (Bisson et al., 2013). The updated search
aimed to identify all RCTs related to the prevention
and treatment of PTSD, published from January 2008
to the 31 May 2018, using the search terms PTSD or
posttrauma* or post-trauma* or ‘post trauma*’ or
‘combat disorder*’ or ‘stress disorder*’. The searches
included results from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase
and the Cochrane database of randomized trials.
This produced a group of papers related to the psy-
chological treatment of PTSD in adults. We checked
reference lists of the included studies. We searched
the World Health Organization’s, and the U.S.
National Institutes of Health’s trials portals to iden-
tify additional unpublished or ongoing studies. We
contacted experts in the field with the aim of identi-
fying unpublished studies and studies that were in
submission. A complementary
the
Published International Literature on Traumatic
Stress (PILOTS) was also conducted.

of

2.3. Data extraction

Study characteristics and outcome data were extracted
by two reviewers using a form that had been piloted on
five of the included studies. In order to categorize
therapies, information on the protocol used was sought
from the methods sections of the included studies and
authors were contacted if there was uncertainty regard-
ing the type of therapy delivered. The outcome measure
for the review was reduction in the severity of PTSD
symptoms post-treatment using a standardized mea-
sure. When available, clinician-rated measures were
included in meta-analyses
the Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS); Blake et al., 1995).
If no clinician-rated measure was used or reported, self-
report measures were included (e.g.,
the PTSD
Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5); Weathers et al., 2013).
Study authors were contacted to obtain missing data.
Therapy classifications were agreed with the ISTSS
treatment guidelines committee.

(e.g.,

2.4. Risk of bias assessment

All included studies were assessed for risk of bias
using Cochrane criteria (Higgins et al., 2011). This
included: (1) sequence allocation for randomization
(the methods used for randomly assigning partici-
pants to the treatment arms and the extent to which
this was truly random); (2) allocation concealment
(whether or not participants or personnel were able
to foresee allocation to a specific group); (3) assessor
blinding (whether the assessor was aware of group
allocation); (4) incomplete outcome data (whether
missing outcome data was handled appropriately);

(5) selective outcome reporting (whether reported
outcomes matched with those
that were pre-
specified); and (6) any other notable threats to valid-
ity (for example, baseline imbalances between groups,
small sample size, or premature termination of the
study). Two researchers independently assessed each
study and any conflicts were discussed with a third
researcher with the aim of reaching a unanimous
decision.

2.5. Quality of evidence assessment

The quality of evidence for each comparison was
assessed using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
system (GRADE, 2018). Evidence was categorized as
high quality (indicating that further research is very
unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of
effect); moderate quality (indicating that
further
research is likely to have an important impact on
our confidence in the estimate of effect and may
low quality (indicating that
change the estimate);
further research is very likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect
and is likely to change the estimate) or very low
quality (indicating that we are very uncertain about
the estimate).

2.6. Data synthesis

Meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane’s
Review Manager 5 (RevMan) software (RevMan,
2014). Continuous measures of post-treatment PTSD
severity were analysed as standardized mean differences
(SMDs). All outcomes were presented using 95% con-
fidence intervals. Clinical heterogeneity was assessed in
terms of variability in the experimental and control
interventions; participants; settings; and outcomes.
Heterogeneity was assessed further using both the I2
statistic and the chi-squared test of heterogeneity, as
well as visual inspection of the forest plots. Data were
pooled using fixed-effect meta-analyses, except where
heterogeneity was present, when random-effect models
were used. Since combining waitlist and usual care in
a single comparison was a potential limitation of the
review, sensitivity analyses looked at the influence of
removing studies that adopted a usual care control
group from meta-analyses making this comparison.
To determine the impact of risk of bias within the
included studies on outcome, sensitivity analyses were
conducted by removing studies with high risk of bias in
three or more domains. Sensitivity analyses were only
conducted for meta-analyses including 10 or more stu-
dies, since it was unlikely that meaningful differences
would be determined among a smaller number of stu-
dies. A funnel plot was constructed for the meta-
analysis containing the largest number of studies and

visually inspected, with signs of asymmetry taken to
indicate publication bias.

2.7. Clinical importance

A definition of clinical importance, which was devel-
oped by the ISTSS treatment guidelines committee,
after consultation with the ISTSS membership, and
approved by the ISTSS Board, was applied to the meta-
analytic results (ISTSS, 2018). To be rated as clinically
important, an intervention had to demonstrate an
effect size of >0.80 for wait list control comparisons;
>0.5 for attention control comparisons; >0.4 for pla-
cebo control comparisons; and >0.2 for active treat-
ment control comparisons. If there was only one RCT,
an intervention was not rated as clinically important
unless
included over 300 participants. Non-
inferiority RCT evidence alone was not enough to
rate an intervention as clinically important.

3. Results

The original Cochrane review included 70 RCTs. The
update search identified 5500 potentially eligible stu-
dies published since 2008. Abstracts were reviewed
and full-text copies obtained for 203 potentially rele-
vant studies. Forty-four new RCTs met inclusion
criteria for the review. This resulted in a total of
114 RCTs of 8171 participants. Figure 1 presents
a flow diagram for study selection.

3.1. Study characteristics

Single

Study characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Twenty-
nine defined psychological therapies were evaluated.
Eight of these were broadly categorized as CBT-T deliv-
ered on an individual basis: Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy
(BEP); Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT); Cognitive
Therapy (CT); Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET):
Session CBT;
Prolonged Exposure
(PE);
Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories
(RTM);
Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRE). Twelve other
therapies delivered to individuals were evaluated: EMDR;
CBT without a Trauma Focus; Present Centred Therapy
(PCT); Supportive Counselling; Written Exposure
Integration
Therapy; Observed and Experiential
Interpersonal Psychotherapy; Psychodynamic
(OEI);
Psychotherapy;
REM
Desensitization; Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT);
(DET); Relaxation
Dialogical Exposure Therapy
Training; Psychoeducation; Guided Internet-based CBT
with a Trauma Focus. There were five different types of
group therapy: Group CBT-T; Group and Individual
CBT-T; Group
Therapy; Group
Interpersonal
Stabilizing Treatment; Group Supportive Counselling.
Couples CBT with a Trauma Focus was also evaluated.
It was decided a priori that therapies delivered in a group
format would be grouped, due to the small number of
studies.

The number of randomized participants ranged
from 10 to 366. Studies were conducted in Australia
(9), Canada (2), China (2), Denmark (1), Germany (5),
Iran (2), Israel (1), Italy (2), Japan (1), the Netherlands
(4), Norway (1), Portugal (1), Romania (1), Rwanda (1),
Spain (1), Sweden (3), Switzerland (1), Syria (1),
Thailand (1), Turkey (3), Uganda (2), UK (11), USA
(61). Participants were traumatized by military combat
(27 studies), sexual assault or rape (11 studies), war/
persecution (8 studies), road traffic accidents (6 stu-
dies), earthquakes (4 studies), childhood sexual abuse
(7 studies), political detainment (1 study), terrorism (2
studies), physical assault (2 studies), domestic violence
(4 studies), trauma from a medical diagnosis/emer-
gency (4 studies) and crime/organized violence (4 stu-
dies). The remainder (41 studies) included individuals
traumatized by a variety of different traumatic events.
There were 27 studies of females only and 9 of only
males; the percentage of females in the remaining stu-
dies ranged from 1.75% to 96%. The percentage with
a University education ranged from 4% to 90%.
Exclusion criteria varied across studies, with the most
common being: current or lifetime psychosis (69 stu-
dies); bipolar disorder (18 studies) or severe depression
(12 studies); substance use (63 studies); suicidal ideation
(55 studies). Participants were recruited from health or
social care settings (71 studies); from the general public

via advertisements (21); or through a combination of
the two approaches (7 studies).

3.2. Risk of bias

Risk of bias assessments for the included studies is
summarized in Table 2. Fifty-three studies reported
a method of sequence allocation judged to pose a ‘low’
risk of bias; four reported a method with a ‘high’ risk of
bias; the remainder reported insufficient details and
were, therefore, rated as ‘unclear’. Forty-one studies
reported methods of allocation concealment represent-
ing a ‘low’ risk of bias; one a method with a ‘high’ risk of
bias; with the remainder rated as ‘unclear’. The outcome
assessor was aware of the participant’s allocation in 12
of the included studies; it was unclear whether the out-
come assessor was aware of group allocation in 18
studies; with the remainder using blind-raters or self-
report questionnaires delivered in a way that could not
be influenced by members of
the research team.
Twenty-three studies were judged as posing a ‘high’
risk of bias in terms of incomplete outcome data; 80
studies were felt to have dealt with dropouts appropri-
ately (‘low’ risk of bias); it was unclear in the remaining
studies. The majority of studies failed to reference
a published protocol, resulting in an ‘unclear’ risk of
selective reporting for 78 studies; risk of bias was judged
as ‘high’ in five studies and low in the remainder.
Seventy of the included studies presented a ‘high’ risk
of bias in other areas, for example, in relation to sample
size, baseline imbalances between groups, or other
methodological shortfalls. We could not rule out poten-
tial researcher allegiance, since treatment originators
were involved in the evaluation of their own interven-
tion in many of the included studies.

3.3. Efficacy

Results of
the meta-analyses are summarized in
Tables 3 and 4. The strongest evidence of effect was
for the studies broadly categorized as CBT-T, and
EMDR. Meta-analyses of specific manualized CBT-
Ts found that CPT; CT; and PE had the strongest
evidence of effect. There was also some evidence
supporting the effect of NET (a variant of CBT-T);
CBT without a trauma focus; PCT; Group CBT-T
and guided internet-based CBT. There was emerging
evidence to support the effect of single-session CBT;
RTM; VRE (all variants of CBT-T); as well as Written
Exposure Therapy; combined group and individual
CBT-T; and couples CBT-T. There was insufficient
evidence to support the efficacy of BEP (a variant of
Group
CBT-T);
Interpersonal Therapy; Group Stabilizing Treatment;
Group Supportive Counselling; Group Interpersonal
Therapy; OEI; Psychodynamic Therapy; Relaxation
Training; or Psychoeducation.

Counselling;

Supportive

3.4. Sensitivity analyses

Four of the meta-analyses included 10 or more stu-
dies (CBT-T versus waitlist/usual care/minimal atten-
tion; PE versus waitlist/usual care/minimal attention;
EMDR versus waitlist/usual care/minimal attention;
and EMDR versus CBT-T). Sensitivity analyses that
removed studies with high risk of bias in three or
more domains gave similar SMDs and confidence
intervals. Sensitivity analyses that removed studies
with a usual care control group found that SMDs
and confidence intervals in the analyses of CBT-T
and PE, but evidence of improved effect in the case
of EMDR.

3.5. Heterogeneity

the studies;

There was evidence of substantial clinical heteroge-
neity across studies in terms of the inclusion and
exclusion criteria of
the populations
from which the samples were drawn; the nature and
duration of therapy; the qualifications and experience
of therapists; the predominant trauma type; the mean
age of participants; and the proportion of female
versus male participants. Considerable statistical het-
erogeneity was also evident in many of the pooled
comparisons. This
resulted in regular use of
a random-effects model.

3.6. Publication bias

All of the included studies were published. There was
evidence of some publication bias, demonstrated by
a funnel plot using data from the comparison of
CBT-T versus waitlist/usual care/minimal attention.

4. Discussion

4.1. Main findings

In agreement with previous reviews and in continued
support of existing treatment guidelines (American
Psychological Association, 2017; Australian Centre for
Posttraumatic Mental Health,
2007; National
Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2005; US
Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017), there was robust
evidence for the clinically important effect of the thera-
pies broadly defined as CBT-T, as well as EMDR.
A substantial increase in the number of RCTs published
in recent years resulted in a greater level of confidence
in these findings. This review went further, and we
conducted meta-analyses of specific manualized thera-
pies. By applying pre-determined definitions of clini-
cally important effect, we found that the CBT-Ts with
the strongest evidence were PE, CPT and CT. There was
also some evidence in support of NET; and emerging
evidence in support of other CBT-Ts, namely, single-
session CBT-T; RTM; VRE; and WRT. There was

it is
estimated pooled-effect of CBT-T or EMDR,
probable that further research will modify the evi-
dence base for therapies currently represented by
fewer studies. Although not as strong as the evidence
for CBT-T and EMDR, emerging evidence for inter-
ventions such as guided internet-based CBT and PCT
advances the field by providing a greater choice of
evidence-based therapies.

4.2. Strengths and limitations

The review followed Cochrane guidelines for the
identification of relevant studies; data extraction and
synthesis; risk of bias assessment; and interpretation
of findings (Higgins & Green, 2011). The review
moves the field forward, by estimating the effect of
specific manualized therapies when available data
allowed, rather than grouping similar approaches.

Despite the many strengths of the review, there were
inevitable limitations. The small number of studies
evaluating interventions delivered to a group or to
couples precluded analyses of these therapies, as was
previously the case for therapies delivered on an
individual basis. All included studies were published,
resulting in the possibility of publication bias.
A funnel plot constructed from the meta-analysis of
CBT-T versus waitlist or usual care found some evi-
dence of publication bias, indicating that the cur-
rently available evidence may overestimate the effect
of CBT-T. Several studies reported incomplete data
and although authors were contacted,
it was not
always possible to obtain missing information, result-
ing in the exclusion of otherwise eligible studies. The
majority of studies included in the review excluded
individuals with comorbidities of substance depen-
dence, psychosis, and severe depression; we are not,
therefore, able to draw any conclusions beyond the
efficacy of psychological therapies for relatively sim-
ple presentations of PTSD. Waitlist and treatment as
usual were included as a single comparison group in
meta-analyses, giving a more conservative estimate of
effect than reviews that have separated the two. It is
acknowledged that usual care, especially in more
recent studies, may have included evidence-based
therapies. This
sensitivity analyses, which
excluded studies with a usual care control group
from comparisons with more than ten studies,
revealed little difference in the outcome in two of
three eligible analyses. The methodological quality
of included studies varied considerably, and risk of
bias was high/unclear in several domains of many
studies. However, sensitivity analyses removing stu-
dies with high risk of bias in at least three or more
domains revealed little influence. Most of the trials to
date have been conducted on DSM-IV PTSD. We are
not therefore able to draw conclusions regarding the
performance of therapies on the additional cluster of
symptoms (alterations in mood and cognitions) that
was introduced by DSM-5. Data on the competence
of the therapists and the number of therapy sessions
was not extracted from the included studies and we
cannot therefore comment on these as factor that
may have impacted efficacy. Sample sizes were often
small; however,
the pooled comparisons included
data from 8171 participants.

specific subgroups of patients. We should also con-
sider the skills and therapeutic style of the therapist,
given the likelihood that some are better at delivering
certain types of therapy than others. Since there is
evidence for the effect of numerous psychological
therapies, the evidence-base should be used to guide
shared decision-making between patient and clini-
cian. There is a need for detailed assessment; followed
by discussion surrounding the evidence; resulting in
the co-production of treatment plans that consider
patient-preference (National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence [NICE], 2018). Although the stron-
gest evidence of effect was for CBT-T and EMDR,
there was also evidence in support of CBT without
a trauma focus and PCT. This indicates a role for
these therapies as alternatives to trauma-focused
intervention, if the latter are not available; if patient
preference dictates; or if exposure work is contra-
indicated, for example, if an individual is unable to
tolerate the treatment.

Despite the current review giving a good indica-
tion of the therapies most strongly supported by
the current evidence-base,
these are not always
widely available or accessible. There is growing
evidence in support of group and internet-based
therapies, which are potential avenues for widening
access to low-cost treatment and disseminating evi-
dence-based therapies more efficiently. At
least
a proportion of individuals are likely to respond
to these minimally intensive treatments and require
no further intervention, which fits well with the
principles of prudent healthcare. It is hoped that
future work will identify the characteristics of those
unlikely to respond to less intensive interventions,
allowing a more stratified or personalized approach
to treatment. Work is needed to develop optimal
clinical pathways that deliver appropriate evidence-
based therapies in the most efficient way possible,
whilst ensuring the acceptability of the approach to
patients. There are additional factors to take into
implications,
account when considering clinical
including rates of attrition from treatment; adverse
events; the acceptability of treatment approaches;
and cost-effectiveness. Considering these factors

this review, but

4.3. Clinical implications

The psychological therapies with the strongest evi-
dence of effect should be those prioritized for clinical
use when available and acceptable to the patient. It is,
however, unlikely that any given therapy is univer-
sally appropriate for all individuals with PTSD. There
is a need to consider predictors of outcome that may
indicate the suitability of particular therapies for

4.4. Research implications
Although we report effect sizes across a range of
therapies, further high-quality head-to-head RCTs of
the most effective interventions are necessary to
determine comparative efficacy among participants
drawn from the same population. We know little
about the predictors of outcome and acceptability of
psychological therapies, and a greater understanding
would enable targeted recommendation of particular

treatments to specific sub-groups of patients. PTSD is
a highly heterogeneous condition (DiMauro, Carter,
Folk, & Kashdan, 2014, Murphy, Ross, Busuttil,
Greenberg, & Armour, 2019) and work is needed to
develop more personalized approaches. We do not
have a sufficient understanding of the efficacy of
current therapies for those with a diagnosis of ICD-
11 complex PTSD (Dorrepaal et al., 2013, 2014;
Karatzias et al., 2019). Further research is needed to
evaluate existing therapies among those with complex
PTSD, and to modify or develop new therapies, as
appropriate. Work is also needed to determine the
efficacy of therapies in addressing the DSM-5 symp-
tom-cluster related to mood and cognition. Therapies
delivered in a group format and to couples have
shown promise, but there are currently an insufficient
number of studies to conduct meta-analyses beyond
those grouping interventions into broad categories.
There is a need for established standards for the
reporting of psychological therapy trials to ensure
that methods are transparent and any risk of bias
clear. This would also ensure a clearer definition of
control groups. In many studies, it was unclear what
constituted usual care and what intervention, if any,
was permitted in wait-list control groups. We know
very little about the acceptability of psychological
therapies for PTSD and more work should focus on
patient preference.
