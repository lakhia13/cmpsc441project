Abstract 
Background  Insomnia is a highly prevalent symptom occurred during and post‑chemotherapy. Acupuncture may 
have beneficial effects in the management of chemotherapy‑associated insomnia. This study was conducted to 
determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in improving chemotherapy‑associated insomnia in breast cancer 
patients.

Methods  This assessor‑participant blinded, randomized, sham‑controlled trial was conducted from November 2019 
to January 2022 (follow‑up completed July 2022). Participants were referred by oncologists from two Hong Kong 
hospitals. Assessments and interventions were conducted at the outpatient clinic of School of Chinese Medicine, the 
University of Hong Kong. The 138 breast cancer patients with chemotherapy‑associated insomnia were randomly 
assigned to receive either 15 sessions of active acupuncture regimen by combining needling into body acupoints 
and acupressure on auricular acupoints or sham acupuncture control (69 each) for 18 weeks, followed by 24 weeks of 
follow‑up. The primary outcome was measured using Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes included the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Actiwatch and sleep diary for sleep parameters, depression and anxiety, fatigue and 
pain, and quality of life.

Background
Breast  cancer  patients  are  at  significantly  greater  risk  of 
developing  insomnia  than  those  with  other  malignan-
cies and the general population [1, 2]. Individuals under 
chemotherapy  experienced  higher  incidence  and  more 
severe levels of insomnia than those who received other 
cancer  treatments  such  as  surgery  and  radiotherapy  [2–
4].  More  than  1/4  of  breast  cancer  patients  developed 
new-onset  insomnia  during  chemotherapy,  and  more 
likely to persist after the completion of cancer treatments 
than  those  without  chemotherapy  [5,  6].  The  develop-
ment  of  chemotherapy-associated  insomnia  in  breast 
cancer patients is associated with multiple factors which 
may trigger and even aggravate insomnia, mainly includ-
ing  psychological  stress  due  to  cancer  diagnosis  and 
treatments, direct effects of medications and chemother-
apy,  reduction  in  physical  activity,  disruption  in  circa-
dian, and somatic-cognitive-cortical hyperarousal [7–10]. 
The  presence  of  insomnia  not  only  increases  risks  of 
psychiatric  and  physical  comorbidities  [11,  12],  but  also 
reduces  patients’  willingness  to  complete  cancer  treat-
ments  and  decreases  quality  of  life.  Although  pharma-
cological  therapy  is  the  mainstay  of  the  management  of 
insomnia in cancer patients, it is generally recommended 
for  short-term  use,  as  sedative-hypnotic  medications 
often cause undesirable side effects, particularly depend-
ence  and  tolerance  [13].  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy 
may  be  efficacious  for  improving  sleep  quality  in  breast 
cancer  women  [14],  but  intensive  labour  requirements 
and  high  treatment  costs  have  limited  the  access  to  this 
non-pharmacological therapy [15, 16].

Over  the  past  two  decades,  acupuncture  has  gained 
increasing popularity in the treatment of insomnia, can-
cer  and  cancer-related  symptoms  [17–19].  Numerous 
clinical practice guidelines have recommended acupunc-
ture  as  an  effective  option  for  chemotherapy-induced 
side  effects  [17,  20]. There  have  been  a  large  number  of 
clinical  trials  that  demonstrated  promising  efficacy  of 
acupuncture for various types of insomnia [21, 22]. How-
ever, the effectiveness of acupuncture for chemotherapy-
associated insomnia remains for further evaluation. Our 
recent pilot-controlled trial has shown the potential ben-
efits of the combination of needling into body acupoints 
and  auricular  acupressure  in  30  breast  cancer  patients 
who underwent chemotherapy and experienced insomnia 

[23].  We  therefore  hypothesized  that  the  combination 
acupuncture  regimen  could  produce  better  outcomes 
than  sham  regimen  in  improving  chemotherapy-associ-
ated  insomnia.  To  test  this  hypothesis,  an  assessor-par-
ticipant  blinded,  randomized,  sham-controlled  trial  was 
designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  two 
regimens  in  breast  cancer  patients  with  chemotherapy-
associated insomnia.

trial.  The 

This  was  an  assessor-participant-data  analyst  blinded, 
randomized,  sham-controlled 
trial  was 
approved  by  Institutional  Review  Board  of  the  Univer-
sity of Hong Kong (HKU)/Hospital Authority Hong Kong 
(HK)  West  Cluster  (UW  19-045)  and  Research  Ethics 
Committee  of  HK  Sanatorium  &  Hospital  (REC-2019-
14).  The  trial  was  registered  in  www. clini caltr ials. gov 
(NCT04144309).  The  study  was  conducted  in  accord-
ance with Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clini-
cal Trials of Acupuncture and Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials statement [24, 25].

Recruitment and treatment occurred between Novem-
ber  2019  and  January  2022;  follow-up  assessments 
completed  in  July  2022.  Participants  were  referred  by 
oncologists  from  HK  Queen  Mary  Hospital  and  HK 
Sanatorium  &  Hospital.  Multiple  promotions  were  car-
ried  out  to  facilitate  recruitment,  including  advertising 
on  newspapers  and  Facebook.  Participants  gave  volun-
tary,  written,  informed  consent  after  study  procedures 
were fully explained. Assessments and interventions were 
conducted  at  the  outpatient  clinic  of  School  of  Chinese 
Medicine, HKU.

Participants

Patients were eligible if they were: (i) females aged 18–75; 
(ii)  had  a  diagnosis  of  stage  I–IV  breast  cancer;  (iii) 
underwent  or  had  completed  chemotherapy  no  more 
than 6 months; (iv) insomnia occurred at least 3 nights/
week and lasted at least one month, with the fulfilment of 
the diagnostic criteria for brief insomnia disorder of the 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders 
(5th Edition); and (v) the severity of insomnia reached at 
least 10 points of Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) over the 
past 2 weeks.

Patients were excluded if they had: (i) other sleep disor-
ders  (e.g.,  obstructive  sleep  apnoea),  irregular  sleep  pat-
tern, or shift work; (ii) severe hearing, visual or language 
defects; (iii) severe hematological dysfunction (e.g., hae-
moglobin  < 8  g/dL,  platelet  count  < 60,000/μL,  absolute 
neutrophil  count  < 1000/μL);  (iv)  pacemakers  or  other 
electronic  implants  that  might  interfere  with  electroa-
cupuncture;  (v)  had  acupuncture  treatment  in  the  past 
3 months; or (vi) participated in other clinical trials in the 
past 3 months.

Randomization

Permuted  block  randomization  (block  sizes  of  2/4/6) 
was  used.  After  baseline  assessments,  participants  were 
randomly assigned to two groups at a ratio of 1:1 accord-
ing  to  the  randomization  sequence.  The  randomization 
sequence  was  generated  by  an  independent  biostatisti-
cian using Microsoft Excel prior to study initiation. Indi-
vidual  randomization  code  was  sealed  in  sequentially 
numbered opaque envelopes and opened by acupunctur-
ist after participants completed baseline assessments.

Blinding and allocation concealment

Investigators and research staffs who performed screen-
ing,  assessments,  and  data  entry/re-entry/analysis  were 
blinded  to  group  allocation.  Participants  were  informed 
that they would have same chance of allocating to either 
group and would be blinded to allocation. Treatment was 
delivered  individually  in  a  separate  room  to  avoid  com-
munications  among  participants  about  treatment  expe-
rience.  Eye  mask  was  used  to  block  participant’s  vision 
during  treatment  so  that  she  was  unaware  of  acupunc-
ture  procedure.  Acupuncturists  were  instructed  not  to 
acquire participants’ information except group allocation. 
Interactions  between  acupuncturists  and  participants 
were kept to a minimum to avoid accidental disclosure of 
group allocation.

Intervention

Participants  continued  routine  care  and  symptom  man-
agement  during  study.  Acupuncture  treatment  was  car-
ried  out  by  registered  Chinese  Medicine  Practitioners 
(CMPs)  had  at  least  5-year  clinical  practice  experience 
and  completed  training  workshop  prior  to  study  ini-
tiation.  The  training  workshop  included  introduction  of 
treatment  protocol,  standard  procedures  of  active  and 
sham  acupuncture,  and  conversation  skills  with  partici-
pants. The treatment protocol [26] was developed based 
on  neuroanatomic  mechanisms  [27,  28],  CMPs’  experi-
ence  and  previous  clinical  trials  [21,  29].  Participants 
received a total of 15 sessions of treatments, with 12 ses-
sions given twice weekly as intensive treatment over the 
first  6  consecutive  weeks,  3  sessions  given  once  every 

4 weeks from 7 to 18 weeks to maintain treatment effects, 
and follow-up from 19 to 42 weeks.

Active acupuncture regimen

Active  acupuncture  regimen  consisted  of  electroacu-
puncture  on  body  acupoints  and  auricular  acupressure. 
Six fixed acupoints (EX-HN1, GV20, GV24, PC6, KI3 and 
SP6)  were  utilized  for  treating  insomnia  [30–33].  Four 
additional  acupoints  were  selected  based  on  comorbid 
symptoms (Table 1). Locations/therapeutic effects of acu-
points  are  summarized  in  Additional  file  1:  eTable  S1A. 
Details  procedures  are  listed  in  Additional  file  1:  eTa-
ble S1B. Auricular acupressure was conducted by embed-
ding  black,  hard  Vaccaria  seeds  on  surface  of  bilateral  3 
auricular points (Heart, Shenmen and Sympathetic).

Sham acupuncture regimen

Sham  points  that  are  located  at  1–2  cm  adjacent  to 
meridian-based  acupoints  were  used  for  sham  electroa-
cupuncture  [34].  Streitberger’s  non-invasive  retract-
able  needles  were  compressed  via  guiding  tubes  onto 
point  skin  [35].  For  sham  auricular  acupressure,  3  sham 
points in helix region (HX7, HX8, HX9) that are located 
remotely  from  inner  ear  area  and  their  effects  are  not 
indicated for insomnia were selected [36]. Soft stem piths 
of Medulla Junci were cut and dyed in black were used to 
mimic auricular acupressure [37].

Concomitant use of psychotropic medications

Psychotropic medications were allowed to be prescribed 
at  the  discretion  of  psychiatrists  and  general  physicians 
during  study.  The  proportion  of  participants  who  were 
prescribed  with  sleeping  medications  (sedatives,  hyp-
notics  and  anxiolytics),  dosage  and  weekly  frequency  of 
use  were  recorded.  The  dosage  used  was  converted  as 
diazepam  equivalent  dosage.  Four  mean  dosages  were 
obtained  by  averaging  across  a  2  week  duration  [38]: 
prior to entry, post-treatment 6 weeks and 18 weeks, and

medications was calculated.

to  principal  investigator  and  Ethics  Committee  within 
24 h of the occurrence.

Assessments
Primary outcome

Details of outcomes have been reported previously [26]. 
The  primary  outcome  was  defined  as  the  change  in 
ISI  score  at  6  weeks  of  treatment  from  baseline.  ISI  is  a 
7-item  self-rating  questionnaire  that  has  good  inter-
nal  consistency  and  construct  validity  in  differentiating 
insomnia severity in cancer patients [39]. ISI score ranges 
from  0  to  28.  The  higher  score  represents  more  severe 
insomnia, with 10 points indicative of subthreshold level 
of insomnia [40, 41].

Secondary outcomes

Secondary  outcomes 
sleeping  measures, 
included 
depression  and  anxiety,  fatigue  and  pain,  and  quality  of 
life.  Actiwatch  [42]  (Spectrum  Plus,  Philips  Respiron-
ics,  USA)  and  Sleep  Diary  [43]  were  used  to  record 
sleep  onset  latency  (SOL),  wake  time  after  sleep  onset 
(WASO),  total  sleep  time  (TST),  and  sleep  efficiency 
(SE). Participants were required to record for 2 sessions 
of  7  consecutive  nights  starting  at  baseline  and  starting 
after 6 week of treatment. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) was a 19-item questionnaire used to assess sleep 
dysfunction,  with  higher  score  indicating  poorer  sleep 
quality [44, 45].

The severity of depression/anxiety was measured using 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which is 
a  14-item  questionnaire  with  two  subscales  to  evaluate 
the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms [46, 47]. 
Fatigue  and  pain  symptoms  were  measured  using  Brief 
Fatigue  Inventory  (BFI)  and  Brief  Pain  Inventory-Short 
Form  (BPI-SF),  respectively.  BFI  is  a  9-item  self-rating 
scale designed to evaluate the severity and impact of can-
cer-related fatigue on daily functioning, with higher score 
corresponding  to  greater  level  of  fatigue  [48].  BPI-SF  is 
a  self-administered  questionnaire  developed  to  evaluate 
pain severity and pain interference on daily function over 
the past 24 h [49, 50]. Quality of life was measured using 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer 
(FACT-B). FACT-B is a 37-item self-reported instrument 
devised  to  assess  multidimensional  health-related  qual-
ity of life in breast cancer patients [51], with higher score 
indicating better quality of life [52]. Questionnaires were 
completed at baseline, week-3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 30 and 42.

Adverse events

Adverse  events  (AEs)  were  recorded  during  study. 
Whether an AE related to treatment was determined by 
acupuncturists.  Serious  AEs  were  immediately  reported 

Credibility, expectancy, adherence, and successiveness 
of blinding

The  credibility  of  treatment  was  assessed  using  the 
4-item, 6-point Credibility Rating Scale [53]. Expectancy 
for acupuncture outcomes was assessed using the 4-item 
5-point  Acupuncture  Expectancy  Scale  [54].  Greater 
scores  of  both  scales  represent  stronger  confidence  and 
higher expectancy to treatment. Adherence was assessed 
by  counting  the  number  of  completed  treatment  ses-
sions.  Participants  were  asked  to  guess  which  type  of 
acupuncture they had received after the third treatment 
[55]. James’ and Bang’s blinding index were calculated to 
evaluate successiveness of blinding [56].

Data security and monitoring

All  data  were  secured  in  compliance  with  HK  Personal 
Data  (Privacy)  Ordinance  (CAP  486).  A  data  and  safety 
monitoring board (DSMB) was established [57] and com-
prised  of  an  independent  biostatistician,  an  oncologist 
and a psychiatrist. They were not involved in the conduct 
of  the  trial.  DSMB  meetings  were  held  prior  to  the  ini-
tiation of recruitment and after the final analysis. To pre-
vent loss of follow-up, text messages were sent or phone 
calls  were  made  to  individual  participants  a  day  before 
scheduled visits. The research team held weekly meetings 
to  troubleshoot  issues  pertaining  to  patient  recruitment 
and retention.

Statistical analysis
Estimation of sample size

There  was  no  study  has  previously  been  conducted  in 
the  female  with  breast  cancer  experiencing  chemother-
apy-associated insomnia. The sample size was estimated 
based on anticipated changes of ISI score. Based on pre-
vious  trials  among  non-cancer  population  with  primary 
insomnia  [21,  58],  in  which  the  reduction  of  ISI  score 
was  between  2.3  and  5.0,  with  median  value  of  2.5  and 
pooled standard deviation of 4.7. The study was assumed 
to detect a 2.5 difference between groups in reduced ISI 
score, with a 95% level of significance and an 80% power. 
A  total  of  138  subjects  (69/group)  were  needed  in  the 
consideration of 20% dropout rate.

Data analysis

The  efficacy  was  analyzed  in  the  intention-to-treat  pop-
ulation,  defined  as  participants  who  completed  baseline 
assessments.  For  missing  data,  the  multiple  imputation 
method  was  used  under  the  missing-at-random  (MAR) 
assumption. The sensitivity of MAR assumption of miss-
ing data was tested with a pattern-mixture model [59], in 

Zhang et al. Breast Cancer Research           (2023) 25:49 

Page 5 of 15

which  the  robustness  of  the  analyzed  results  of  primary 
outcome was examined. The primary outcome and con-
tinuous  secondary  outcomes  were  compared  using  a 
mixed-effect  model  adjusted  with  baseline  values,  with 
time, group, and interaction between time and group as 
the  fixed  effects,  and  individual  subject  as  the  random 
effect.

Categorical  variables,  including  categorical  baseline 
variables, cessation rate of sleeping medications and inci-
dence of AEs, were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher’s 
exact tests. Unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was 
used  to  compare  continuous  variables  between  groups, 
including  baseline  variables,  changes  in  Actiwatch-/
diary-recorded  variables,  credibility  score  and  medica-
tion  dosage.  Statistical  analyses  were  performed  with 
SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and 
SAS  version  9.4  (SAS  Inc.).  Hypothesis  testing  was  car-
ried out at 5% (2-sided) significance level.

Results
Participant characteristics

Of  415  patients  screened,  166  eligible,  but  28  declined 
to participate (Fig. 1). The remaining 138 were randomly 
assigned to the active and sham acupuncture groups (69/
group). The proportion of participants who completed at 
least 12 treatments was 97.1% (67/69) in the active acu-
puncture  group  and  81.2%  (56/69)  in  the  sham  control 
group. The discontinuation rate was 10.9% (15/138) over 
the first 6 weeks and 16.7% (23/138) over the whole trial. 
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  of  the  active  acupunc-
ture was pronouncedly lower than that of the sham con-
trol [8.7% (6/69) vs. 24.6% (17/69), P = 0.012].

Demographic  and  baseline  variables  were  similar 
between groups. All participants were Asian women with 
mean (SD) age of 52.2 (9.0) years. The mean ISI score was 
17.1  (4.4)  points,  with  the  duration  of  insomnia  of  10.0 
(6.7)  months.  There  were  32.6%  (45/138)  participants 
who were taking sleeping medications at entry (Table 2).

Cessation rate and sleeping medications used

The  active  acupuncture  group  had  a  higher  cessation 
rate  of  sleeping  medication  during  18–20  weeks  than 
the sham control (56.5% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.011). Dosage of 
sleeping  medications  and  weekly  frequency  of  use  were 
not  significantly  different  between  groups  (Fig.  2,  Addi-
tional  file  1:  eTable  S2A).  Characteristics  of  participants 
use  sedatives,  hypnotics,  anxiolytics  in  two  groups  were 
similar (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: eTable S2B).

Primary outcome

The  ISI-measured  severity  of 
insomnia  strikingly 
reduced  from  baseline  over  the  42  week  course  in  two 
groups  (all  Ps < 0.001),  but  the  magnitude  of  ISI  score 

reduction  was  not  significantly  different  between 
groups  at  any  measurement  points, 
including  at 
6  weeks  with  a  0.4  difference  between  the  two  groups 
(95%  CI  − 1.8–1.1;  P = 0.609  (Table  3,  Fig.  3).  The  tip-
ping-point sensitivity analysis of shift ISI score showed 
that the non-differences were not reversed under miss-
ing at random with ISI score shifted from the minimum 
of 7 to the maximum of 28 (Additional file 1: eTable S3). 
Under the adjustment for baseline expectancy for treat-
ment  outcomes,  the  results  did  not  show  deviations 
(Additional file 1: eTable S4).

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes are summarized in Table 3. Within-
group  comparisons  revealed  that  both  groups  had  sig-
nificant  improvements  from  baseline  on  sleep  quality, 
wake time after sleep onset, anxiety, depression, fatigue, 
pain,  and  quality  of  life  (all  Ps < 0.05).  At  6  weeks,  the 
active  acupuncture  was  more  effective  than  sham  con-
trol  in  shortening  sleep  onset  latency  recorded  with 
Actiwatch  (P < 0.001)  and  diary  (P = 0.044),  increasing 
diary-recorded  total  sleep  time  (P < 0.001),  Actiwatch 
(P = 0.049)  and  diary-measured  (P = 0.005)  sleep  effi-
ciency.  Changes  in  PSQI  did  not  differ  between  two 
groups  over  the  whole  study.  The  active  acupuncture 
group had significantly greater effects than the sham con-
trol  in  reducing  severity  of  HADS-measured  anxiety  at 
10 weeks (P = 0.016) and both anxiety and depression at 
42  weeks  (P ≤ 0.001),  and  improving  FACT-B-measured 
quality of life at 14 (P = 0.024) and 42 weeks (P < 0.001).

Adverse events

Treatment-related AEs were mild (Additional file 1: eTa-
ble  S5).  Two  non-treatment-related  serious  AEs  (pneu-
monia)  were  reported  in  the  active  acupuncture  group. 
The  most  common  AE  observed  in  the  active  acupunc-
ture  group  was  bruising  [13.0%  (6/69)].  There  were  4 
sham  acupuncture-treated  participants  who  reported 
auricular  skin  allergic  reaction.  No  participants  discon-
tinued treatments due to AEs.

Credibility for treatment and blinding design

Credibility  score  for  treatment  was  not  significantly  dif-
ferent  between  groups  (Additional  file  1:  eTable  S6). 
James’  blinding  index  was  0.72  (95%  CI  0.65–0.78; 
P = 1.000),  and  Bang’s  blinding  index  was  0.13  (−  0.01–
0.27;  P = 0.038)  for  the  active  acupuncture  and  0.09 
(− 0.09–0.27; P = 0.150) for the sham control, indicating

Discussion
The main purpose of this trial was to determine whether 
the  active  acupuncture  regimen  could  produce  supe-
rior  efficacy  over  the  sham  control  in  improving  chem-
otherapy-associated  insomnia  in  breast  cancer  patients. 
Following  12  sessions  of  treatment,  participants  on  the 
active acupuncture regimen showed significantly greater 
improvements than sham control in sleep onset latency, 
total  sleep  time  and  sleep  efficiency,  which  were  exam-
ined  daily  with  the  objective  assessment  Actiwatch  and 
subjective  assessment  diary.  Likewise,  it  is  evidenced 
that  active  acupuncture  was  markedly  associated  with 
improvements  in  objective  sleep  parameters,  including 
increases  in  total  sleep  time  and  sleep  efficiency  [60]. 
The present study showed that two groups did not differ 
in changes in ISI and PSQI scores, which were measured 
biweekly  and  monthly,  respectively. The  reasons  for  this 
discrepancy are twofold: firstly, the short-term efficacy of 
acupuncture in alleviating insomnia may be more appar-
ent  than  long-term  efficacy.  Previous  studies  have  dem-
onstrated  robust  short-term  effects  of  acupuncture  for 

Fig. 2  Cessation rate over time. *P < 0.05, comparison between

insomnia  in  breast  cancer  survivors  and  adult  women 
[61,  62].  Secondly,  daily-based  sleep  parameters  from 
Actiwatch/diary seemed to be more sensitive in detecting 
improvements of insomnia than those assessed biweekly/
monthly.

Participants  on  the  active  acupuncture  regimen 
achieved  better  treatment  outcomes  than  those  on  the 
sham control in reducing comorbid anxiety and depres-
sion  and  improving  quality  of  life  during  treatment  and 
follow-up.  Similar  results  have  been  observed  in  recent 

in 

trial  that  demonstrated  the  superior  efficacy  of  active 
acupuncture  regimen 
improving  chemotherapy-
induced  cognitive  decline,  distress  caused  psychologi-
cal and somatic symptoms and social functions in breast 
cancer patients [29]. It is also consistent with numerous 
studies that confirm the effectiveness of acupuncture for 
anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  [63,  64].  Additionally, 
this  study  displayed  that  the  active  acupuncture  group 
had a much lower discontinuation rate compared to the 
sham  control.  One  common  reason  for  discontinuation

was lack of perceived efficacy. The current results affirm 
the  notion  that  active  acupuncture  regimen  is  not  only 
effective in improving insomnia and psychiatric disorders 
occurred  during  and  post-chemotherapy  in  breast  can-
cer patients, but such superior efficacy also could be well 
sustained over a follow-up period.

Moreover,  in  a  follow-up  period  of  18–20  weeks,  a 
much greater proportion of the participants in the active 
acupuncture  group  stopped  taking  sleeping  medications 
than the sham control group. Our previous study, none-
theless, displayed no difference in cessation rate in long-
term  benzodiazepine  users  between  electroacupuncture 
and  non-invasive  placebo  control  [65].  This  seemed 
mainly  due  to  the  fact  that  occurrence  of  insomnia  in 
this  study  was  directly  associated  with  chemotherapy, 
whereas  insomnia  in  previous  study  was  comorbid  with 
psychiatric  disorders  [65].  It  is  therefore  suggested  that 
the active acupuncture regimen could serve as a tapering 
approach to reduce and even replace the use of sleeping 
medications in breast cancer patients.

Similar  to  previous  studies  [63,  66],  this  study  pre-
sented  that  acupuncture  had  a  high  safety  profile  with 
well tolerability. There were only few mild adverse events 
reported  from  both  groups  and  no  participants  discon-
tinued  treatments  due  to  adverse  events.  In  this  study, 
while  acupuncture  therapy  earned  high  trustworthiness 
from most participants, there was no difference between 
groups  in  credibility  scores.  The  primary  outcome  was 
not  deviated  under  adjustment  for  baseline  expectancy, 
indicating that treatment outcomes were not confounded 
with participants’ expectancy.

Several  possible  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  to 
understand  the  effect  of  acupuncture  for  cancer-related 

insomnia.  First,  acupuncture  can  regulate  cerebral  neu-
rotransmitters  associated  with  sleep  regulation,  such  as 
gamma  aminobutyric  acid,  5-hydroxytryptamine,  dopa-
mine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, histamine and orexin 
[67, 68]. Second, acupuncture can reduce heart rate vari-
ability,  blood  pressure,  and  sympathetic  nerve  activity, 
which  are  frequently  dysregulated  in  individuals  with 
insomnia  [69].  Acupuncture  may  counterbalance  the 
over-excited sympathetic system, thus relieving insomnia 
symptoms.  Third,  the  anti-inflammation  of  acupuncture 
may contribute to its effect for chemotherapy-associated 
insomnia [70]. Finally, acupuncture relieves physical (i.e., 
fatigue,  pain,  hot  flushes,  neurotoxicity)  and  psycho-
logical (i.e., depression, anxiety) comorbidities related to 
cancer and cancer treatment, and hence to improve sleep 
quality  [71].  More  research  to  investigate  the  mecha-
nisms  of  acupuncture  for  cancer-related  insomnia  are 
warranted.

The efficacy of treatments might be affected by the pre-
cipitating or perpetuating factors of chemotherapy-asso-
ciated  insomnia  [7,  8].  Acupuncture  has  been  reported 
to  generate  an  8.3-point  reduction  in  ISI  score  among 
cancer  survivors  who  have  completed  active  treatments 
[33],  and  about  6-point  reduction  among  breast  cancer 
patients  undergo  or  post-chemotherapy  in  our  present 
and  previous  trial  [23].  Similarly,  behavioral  therapy 
produced  a  10.9-point  reduction  in  ISI  score  among 
cancer  survivors  [33],  and  around  6-point  reduction  in 
patients  with  breast  cancer  undergoing  chemotherapy 
[72].  Although  variations  in  treatment  procedures  and 
participant  characteristics  might  partially  explain  the 
differences in efficacy of acupuncture or behavioral ther-
apy  among  population  with  different  cancer  trajectory

phases, the multiple physical and mental challenges faced 
by patients undergoing chemotherapy must be taken into 
account when comparing the results of these studies.

The  sham  control  produced  greater  improvement  in 
ISI  score  after  6-week  of  intervention  than  other  sham-
controlled  acupuncture  trials  [21,  58],  consequently  led 
to  the  non-significant  between-group  difference  and 
smaller  effect  size.  The  heterogeneous  effects  of  sham 
acupuncture  in  different  studies  were  associated  with 
multiple  factors.  Firstly,  the  greater  effect  of  sham  acu-
puncture  in  the  present  study  might  be  associated  with 
longer treatment duration, more treatment sessions, and 
spontaneous  relief  of  chemotherapy-related  symptoms 
following  the  completion  of  chemotherapy.  Secondly, 
70%  of  participants  had  prior  acupuncture  experience, 
indicating participants had high expectancy in the effec-
tiveness of treatment, thereby might overoptimize treat-
ment  responses.  High  expectancy  might  be  related  to 
high response rate in sham control which makes it more 
difficult  to  detect  additional  “specific”  effects  of  active 
acupuncture over placebo [73]. Therefore, the tentatively 
non-inferiority  effect  of  sham  acupuncture  seen  in  this 
study should be treated with caution.

One  should  consider  the  following  limitations  of  this 
study.  Firstly,  although  Streitberger’s  retractable  placebo 
needles  have  been  widely  used  to  differentiate  specific 
effects  of  inserted  acupuncture  from  non-inserted  nee-
dles, it still could produce widespread modulatory effects 
at  multiple  levels  of  central  nervous  system  by  exciting 
mechanoreceptors  underneath  skin  via  pressure  from 
non-inserted  needles  [28].  Numerous  neuroimaging 
studies have demonstrated that there were no differences 
between “real” and “sham” acupuncture in neuromodula-
tion of functional brain networks [28, 74]. Caution should 
be exercised in interpreting the tentatively non-inferior-
ity effect of the sham acupuncture in this study. Recently, 
we  have  introduced  minimum  acupuncture  stimulation 
as  control,  in  which  acupoints  used  are  unrelated  the 
treated condition, number of acupoints used and stimu-
lation intensity are kept to a minimum at which patients 
were still aware of receiving active acupuncture [29, 75]. 
Secondly, the active acupuncture regimen is  a  combina-
tion of needling into body acupoints and acupressure on 
auricular  points.  It  is  unclear  whether  beneficial  effects 
of such combination were generated from two individual 
acupuncture modes in a synergistic manner. Finally, only 
Actiwatch  used  as  objective  measure  and  discrepancies 
between Actiwatch and sleep diary were observed. Addi-
tional objective measures, e.g., polysomnography, should 
be  considered  reciprocally  to  validate  the  results  from 
Actiwatch  and  clinical  instruments.  It  also  could  help 
gain a better insight into brain mechanisms of the thera-
peutic effects of acupuncture for insomnia.

Conclusion
The  active  acupuncture  regimen  produced  better  out-
comes  than  the  sham  control  in  improving  sleep  onset 
latency,  total  sleep  time  and  sleep  efficiency  in  breast 
cancer  women  with  chemotherapy-associated  insomnia, 
although  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  reduc-
ing  insomnia  severity.  Active  acupuncture  had  signifi-
cantly  greater  effects  in  improving  anxiety,  depression 
and quality of life. Participants of the active acupuncture 
group showed a markedly higher cessation rate of sleep-
ing  medications.  Active  acupuncture  regimen  could  be 
considered as an effective option for chemotherapy-asso-
ciated  insomnia  and  a  tapering  approach  to  reduce  and 
even replace use of sleeping medications in breast cancer 
patients.
