Abstract: Dogs may provide humans with a range of physical, mental and social beneﬁts. Whilst
there is growing scientiﬁc evidence of beneﬁts to humans, there has been less focus on the impact to
canine health, welfare and ethical considerations for the dogs. The importance of animal welfare is
increasingly acknowledged, indicating that the Ottawa Charter should be extended to include the
welfare of non-human animals supporting the promotion of human health. Therapy dog programmes
are delivered across a variety of settings including hospitals, aged care facilities and mental health
services, highlighting the important role they play in human health outcomes. Research has shown
that that there are biomarkers for stress in humans and other animals engaged in human–animal
interactions. This review aims to assess the impact of human–animal interactions on therapy dogs
engaged in providing support to human health. While challenging, it is paramount to ensure that,
within the framework of One Welfare, the welfare of therapy dogs is included, as it is a key factor for
future sustainability. We identiﬁed a range of concerns due to the lack of guidelines and standards to
protect the wellbeing of the dogs engaged in these programmes. Extension of the Ottawa Charter to
include the welfare of non-human animals with leveraging through a One Welfare approach would
promote animal and human health beyond current boundaries.

1. Introduction

Within Australia, it is estimated that 40% of households have a dog [1], and dogs
may provide humans with a range of physiological, psychological and social beneﬁts [2–5].
While there is growing scientiﬁc evidence of these beneﬁts to humans, the health and
welfare impacts on dogs and ethics of engaging dogs in these ways have been less ex-
plored [6–8]. Globally, there is a rapidly expanding ﬁeld whereby dogs are being engaged
to support humans in various therapy roles [9]. Currently, in Australia, therapy dog pro-
grammes are mostly unregulated. This means that uniform minimum standards or codes
of practice to ensure the safety and welfare of the dog are not present [9]. As there are
no existing registration or accreditation requirements, identifying and understanding the
current population of working therapy dogs within Australia is challenging.

The importance of a One Welfare [10] approach is increasingly acknowledged, indicat-
ing a need for the Ottawa Charter [11] to be extended from a human health focus to include
non-human animal welfare when supporting the promotion of human health. It takes into
account the physical, mental, and emotional health of humans and animals, as well as the
impact from, and of our actions on, the environment [12]. One Welfare [10] recognises that
our interactions with animals affect them as individuals, that different species interact with
each other and that humans are able to beneﬁt from these interactions [13]. One Welfare

is increasingly being acknowledged [12], indicating the need for the Ottawa Charter [11]
to be extended to include non-human animal welfare with respect to supporting the pro-
motion of human health [10]. The importance of understanding animal welfare and the
potential impact of physical and mental harm when working in therapy roles with people
is paramount to ensure the wellbeing of non-human animals for that work with humans to
be sustainable [7].

Therapy dog programmes are delivered across a variety of settings including hospitals,
aged care facilities, schools and tertiary education centres, mental health services, court-
houses and airports [14]. Outcomes that have been reported by people who are involved
in a therapy dog programme include: enhanced socialisation, improved mood, decreased
symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, increased independence, enhanced self-esteem
and decreased feelings of anger [15–17]. Deﬁnitions of therapy dogs and their roles vary
throughout the world [18]. Recently, over 70 global experts in the ﬁeld of anthrozoology
published deﬁnitions to clarify the terms and associated roles to limit confusion and clarify
deﬁnitions for animals who support people [19]. Given the historic variety of terminology,
the following deﬁnition of a therapy dog will be used for this review, based on Howell,
Nieforth [19]: ‘an animal who is included into the work of a qualiﬁed health professional in the
provision of a structured, goal-directed treatment’.

We undertook a literature review to assess the impact of human engagement on
therapy dogs enrolled in providing animal therapy support to human health. This is
paramount to ensure that, within the framework of One Welfare [12], the welfare of therapy
animals is included, as it is a key factor for future sustainability of such programmes [20].
Major literature databases, including but not limited to Cochrane, Scopus, Science Direct,
PubMEd and Google Scholar, were searched online. Search keywords included: “animal-
assisted therapy”, “animal-assisted interventions”, “regulations”, “legislation”, “therapy
dog”, “therapy canine”, “cortisol”, and strategies such as Boolean and snowball searching
were used. We address our ﬁndings by focusing on therapy dog issues related to welfare
and ethics, stress, and management of risks, health, and safety. All of these highlight the
need for mechanisms such as an extension of the Ottawa Charter [11] to address potential
issues by enabling an industry-engaged code of conduct to be developed to provide a
formalised One Welfare [12] approach to promote health for all. This paper proposes to
further link One Welfare and Health Promotion to strengthen the development of animal
welfare policies and practices that concurrently prioritise the wellbeing of both humans
and animals and promote their coexistence and vitality [21,22].

2. Why Are Welfare and Ethics Important to Therapy Dogs?

The welfare and ethical engagement of animals for health outcomes and beneﬁts to
humans, including therapy dog programmes, is a topic of community interest [23]. The
achievement of animal welfare protection is based on the ﬁve domains of animal welfare:
nutrition, physical environment, health, behavioural interactions, and mental state [24].
These domains serve as a structured and systematic means of assessing animal welfare,
considering both the positive and negative experiences that animals may encounter, which
are known as their affective states [24]. Additionally, these domains consider the impact
that humans have on these states [24]. This expands on animal welfare as being understood
as both a scientiﬁc concept and the lived experience of an animal. It is inﬂuenced by value-
based ideas (health and functioning, agency in behavioral interactions with people, other
animals and their environment, affective states and natural living) which are considered
important elements for an animal to experience a good life [25], where they experience
more positive feelings than negative ones. Measurement of welfare in therapy dogs needs
to be based on indicators arising from robust animal welfare science that demonstrate
not only an absence of pain and suffering, but also evidence of a positive and enriched
life [26,27].

The ethical challenge posed by dogs’ participation in therapy roles links to the tension
of humans engaging with animals to achieve their own goals without the dog having

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5801

3 of 11

autonomy to choose or reject its role [28]. The ﬁeld of therapy dogs lacks guidance pre-
sented in the ethical framework of other human–animal relationships [29]. In particular,
the ethical issues that arise in therapy dog programs is the potential exploitation of the
dog as a therapeutic tool [29]. There is a risk that dogs may be viewed solely as tools to
provide emotional or therapeutic support rather than as individuals with their own needs
and desires. This could lead to the neglect of the dog’s welfare, such as ignoring signs of
stress or overworking the dog. This then highlights the importance of daily interactions
and demands, such as feeding, grooming and travel, that must be appropriate and reason-
able to prevent injury or illness to the dog [7,23,28]. A recent study highlighted the wide
discrepancies in guidelines and standards held by organisations relating to therapy dogs in
Animal Assisted Interventions (AAI) in the United States [30]. These ﬁndings were consis-
tent with four key factors which have been raised throughout the literature [6,7,23,30–33],
including dog health and safety, welfare and ethics, handler training and education, and
dog behavioural selection. There is a clear need to ensure that the integration of therapy
dogs into therapy programmes upholds the highest degree of dog welfare [34]. This is
of particular importance given societal expectations and community attitudes towards
animals [20]. The welfare of therapy dogs has been identiﬁed as a key factor for the future
sustainability of these practices due to the connection between public expectations and
social license to operate [20,35].

People’s perception of dog welfare varies based on the role and context of the dog [20].
This may reﬂect an assessment of the perceived intrinsic and extrinsic signiﬁcance of the
dog’s role in society [36]. Canine welfare-related concerns in therapy programmes across
the USA which have been identiﬁed were limited access to water, high temperatures in
environments such as nursing homes, and extended periods for which dogs were involved
in therapy sessions [37]. Across the existing evidence base, concern for dog welfare has
traditionally focused on aversive and coercive dog handling techniques, such as the use
of choke chains, shock collars, loud reprimand, physical correction along with dogs being
unable to avoid social intrusions or seek refuge [7,23,38,39]. Our current knowledge of
the impact of therapy programmes on the welfare of dogs is limited [40]. This may be
due to funding prioritising the focus on human beneﬁts from such programmes, or a
lack of validated measures that are readily available to determine the canine welfare
experience [41]. Although a dog may not show signs of aggression during a therapy
programme, this does not mean that the animal is enjoying it [40].

3. What Is a Dog’s Stress Response and How Is It Measured?

When humans are faced with a stressful or unknown situation, the Hypothalamic–
Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis is activated and the steroid structured hormone cortisol is
released [42,43]. Like in humans, stress responses in dogs result in cortisol release from
the HPA axis [44]. Cortisol secretion may function as a coping mechanism in response
to an endogenous or exogenous threat [15]. This can result in elevated cortisol in acute
stress situations and reduced or dysregulated cortisol production over periods of chronic
stress as the HPA axis becomes exhausted, limiting the value of cortisol when used as
a sole measure of stress in dogs and other mammals [45]. Although stress as a state of
arousal can be considered positive or negative, sustained physiological stress can result in
long-term health issues, such as diseases of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urinary
and immune systems [6,15]. The role of assisting people as a therapy dog may result in the
dog experiencing detrimental stress that negatively impacts its welfare [15]. Interestingly,
studies in humans investigating stress biomarkers found that when people are engaged
with interacting or stroking a dog, sensory stimulation in both the human and the dog
can activate oxytocin and decrease cortisol levels in humans; however, it is important to
consider the role of other physiological systems [46–49], although an increase has been
observed at times in dogs [48,50]. However, the experience of dogs involved in a therapy
dog programme is dependent on the individual dog’s genetics, its training and previous

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5801

experiences, the handler, the environment, the type of therapy interaction, tasks undertaken,
duration, and also the patient when in a clinical therapy setting [40].

The main indicators of the stress response typically measured in therapy dogs are
physiological (e.g., salivary cortisol, heart rate and behavioral (e.g., observations of vali-
dated stress-related behaviours)) and/or indicated in handler reports, as shown in Table 1.
Salivary cortisol is a widely used indicator in dog research as reﬂected in Table 1, but varies
signiﬁcantly based on the individual dog, as well as the experimental and environmen-
tal conditions [45]. Additionally, since cortisol levels can respond to both negative and
positive stimulation, it is problematic to utilise it as a standalone indicator [51]. However,
there is a need for caution when interpreting salivary cortisol as a quantiﬁable measure of
welfare in isolation as its levels could be the reﬂection of a variety of reasons [6,45]. Best
practice for assessing animal welfare is a combination of multiple physiological measures
and behavioural observations [45,52]. This is rarely reported in the assessment of therapy
dog programmes.

Heart rate is a psychophysiological measure of affective and cognitive responses in
animals [52], but its use as a valid indicator to measure the stress response in dogs is varied,
with studies identifying little correlation to stress response [60,61]. No correlation between
stress-related behaviours (licking lips, yawning, grooming and withdrawal) and heart rate
was reported; however, only one dog participated in this study, highlighting a possible
study bias based on the behavioural traits of the dog involved [52]. In contrast, one study
identiﬁed an increase in therapy dogs’ heart rate on therapy days compared to control days
based on observations of four dogs [59].

It is also difﬁcult to compare results from the published studies of welfare indicators
in dogs during therapy due to variations in methodology. For example, the duration of
the therapy in reported studies varied from 20 min to 8 h, along with differing intervals
in session frequency varying from daily, weekly, biweekly, to sessions over an extended
period [15,44,51,53–59]. Furthermore, the behavioral observations and assessment to iden-
tify suitable dogs also varies across studies as there is no speciﬁc behavioural assessment
designed for recruitment into therapy programmes [51].

4. Factors Affecting Therapy Dogs’ Stress Responses
4.1. Handler

The importance of handlers has been highlighted in monitoring and assessing their
dog’s behaviour. This enables early intervention to help prevent stress responses that may
negatively impact the dog’s welfare [40,52,57,62]. One study has identiﬁed the potential
impact of a handler’s sex on the dog’s salivary cortisol concentrations [63]. In this study, a
female handler–male dog combination was observed to produce lower salivary cortisol
variability [63]. The effect of handler sex has also been identiﬁed in rodents, with female
handlers effecting a lower stress response in the animals than male ones [64]. Studies
have also noted that dogs displayed sensitivities and stress as a reﬂection of their owner’s
wellbeing, which speaks to the role of attachment between dog and handler and could also
suggest emotional contagion between the dog and its owner [27,62,63].

Handlers with higher levels of education were more aware of stress responses in dogs
than those with lower education levels [6]. Two studies also noted the Dunning–Kruger
effect, in that handlers without the required knowledge or training may not be able to
identify fear or stress reactions, or even unwittingly exacerbate them, and thus have a
detrimental effect on the dog’s wellbeing [7,51]. The importance of continuing education
and certiﬁcation in this ﬁeld is deemed signiﬁcant [65] and should be mandatory.

4.2. Recruitment and Selection

Seven standard behavioural dimensions have been outlined as a general test for
therapy dogs: reactivity, fearfulness, activity, sociability, responsiveness to training, sub-
missiveness, and problem behaviours [66]. Whilst dogs are assessed on their behavioural

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5801

6 of 11

responses in a range of different environments, one study argues that this does not guaran-
tee that the dog will not become stressed [44]. Furthermore, it has been argued that a test
used to assess a dog’s suitability for therapy programmes should be based on how suitable
and capable the dog is in performing the tasks associated to a particular role [67].

Canine personality is an underexplored area in the ﬁeld of successful therapy dog work.
Personality is a more stable indicator of reaction to show different behavioural responses to
a stimulus; while certain behavioral dimensions are used to assess the suitability of a dog
for therapy work, the variability or uniformity of personalities among dogs that excel in
therapy work has not been extensively studied [68]. Understanding the personality traits
that are most beneﬁcial for therapy work could aid in the selection and training of therapy
dogs [51,68,69]. It is possible that certain personality traits, such as high sociability and
low fearfulness, are more conducive to successful therapy work [6]. Further research is
needed to determine whether there are speciﬁc personality traits that are most important
for successful therapy work and to learn to identify these traits during the selection process.
In addition to personality traits, the attachment between the handler and the therapy
dog is also an essential factor that can inﬂuence the dog’s effectiveness [6,70]. A therapy
dog is not simply a tool that can be taken off the shelf and deployed equally in all situa-
tions [70]. Like other working dogs, such as military and police dogs, therapy dogs may
work differently depending on the people they work with [31]. The handler’s behavior,
tone of voice, and body language can all impact the dog’s behaviour and response. A
strong bond between the handler and dog can enhance the effectiveness of the therapy dog
and improve the overall experience for the individuals they are working with [70].

Therefore, it is crucial to not only assess the personality traits of a therapy dog but
also consider the ability of the handler along with the attachment between the handler and
the dog during the selection process. An assessment of the handler’s ability to read the
dog’s behaviour and respond appropriately is essential in ensuring the dog’s wellbeing
and effectiveness as a therapy dog [70].

4.3. Organisational Perspective

Each organisation has its own perspective and criteria for appropriate dog behaviour
and the identiﬁcation of canine stress, creating challenges such as organisational bias and
limited independent veriﬁcation [70,71]. Larger organisations utilising national recruitment
programmes identiﬁed the same challenges, whereas smaller organisations use their own
(often not evidence-based or validated) independent criteria [14]. This is in contrast to a
more recent study in the United States, in which most organisations, regardless of size,
were compliant with current guidelines requiring formal evaluation of dog behaviour and
temperament [30]. The adoption of common guidelines or protocols for recruitment of
dogs engaged in therapy programmes is paramount to ensure that welfare outcomes for
the dog are achieved [14,70,71].

5. Managing Risks, Health, and Safety

There are multiple issues raised in relation to the health risks which dogs present
in therapy dog programmes. Possible risks to humans include transmission of zoonoses,
participant allergies, ﬂeas, scratches and bites, but there has been little focus on the risk
to the health and safety of the dog [7]. Zoonotic infection can transmit both ways (human
to animal, animal to human), and it is possible for both human and non-human animal
participants within therapy dog programmes to be at risk [72]. Whilst it has been identiﬁed
that therapy dogs could act as reservoirs or carriers of infectious agents, the impact of
infections such as multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in animals is just as important,
particularly when deployed in environments such as hospitals [73]. Although rates of
infection did not change during therapy programmes, there is a lack of reporting and
validity regarding the surveillance methods used [73].

Feeding raw meat diets and the potential for subsequent zoonotic transmission is
also an important consideration. Although controversial, raw meat diets can be perceived

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5801

7 of 11

as nutritionally superior and providing health beneﬁts to dogs [74–76]. Participants in
contact with therapy dogs may be immunocompromised, thus the shedding of pathogens
by dogs poses an increased health risk [74,77]. Between 21% and 44% of raw meat diets
are contaminated with Salmonella spp., posing a risk to patients [74], and it has been
identiﬁed that Clostridium, Giardia, and Salmonella could also be isolated from therapy dogs
(n = 80/102) [78]. In an earlier study, dogs fed a raw meat diet experimentally contaminated
with Salmonella spp. were 11.4 times more likely to shed this pathogen within a week of
consumption [79]. Understanding the risks involved appears to be limited as only 13% of
smaller therapy organisations in the USA (n = 24) have a policy that prohibits the feeding
of raw meat diets [30].

The most common health-related protocols reported for therapy dog programmes
is the requirement for regular veterinary visits and vaccinations [80,81]. However, pro-
grammes exist which require several health assessments involving faecal and nasal cultures,
vaccinations including canine distemper, parainﬂuenza, parvovirus, hepatitis and rabies,
preventative treatments include ﬂea and tick control and heartworm [78]. There is vari-
ability in practice with only 63% of organisations requiring vaccinations, 75% requiring
negative faecal parasite result, 54% requiring ﬂea and tick preventative treatments, and
42% requiring the dog is bathed prior to the visit [30].

6. Future Directions for Research

Evidence-based standards of practice to ensure minimum protections for animals
engaged in animal-assisted interventions/programmes including animal-assisted therapy
have been developed internationally [82]. However, within Australia, at present, there are
no regulations or legal requirements to protect animals engaged within animal-assisted
interventions/programmes, which highlights an important area for future investigation
and intervention.

The Ottawa charter could be modiﬁed to advocate for animal-friendly policies to
enable the integration of animal-assisted therapy programs within the health setting in the
acute and community setting. Should this be achieved, it would be paramount to ensure
that the welfare standards of the animals involved to support health promotion outcomes
are a key outcome in safeguarding the animal.

7. Conclusions

The Ottawa Charter commits to health promotion through the promotion of health and
the collaboration and partnership among all sectors of society, through creating supportive
social and physical environments to enable people to achieve their full potential for health.
Therapy dog programs can beneﬁt a diverse group of individuals who may need emotional
support, companionship, and assistance in managing their health and wellbeing. Therapy
dogs offer a unique form of support that can complement traditional medical treatments
and provide individuals with increased control over their health and environment, enabling
them to make healthier choices. Per the Ottawa Charter, responsibility for health promotion
is shared between individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service
institutions and governments who must work together towards a health-care system
that contributes to the pursuit of health. The important role that therapy dogs play to
support and enhance the lives of humans has been well documented. This has led to
an increase in popularity of dogs engaged in different types of programmes, in various
environments, for a variety of support needs. A range of concerns due to the lack of
guidelines, certiﬁcation and standards to protect the welfare of dogs engaged in these
programmes has been identiﬁed. Ignoring these concerns and the risk to the dogs involved
may lead to inappropriate engagement of dogs within programmes, increased negative
behavioural responses from dogs and possible harm to both dogs and humans. To ensure
we can meet societal expectations and secure the future sustainability of therapy dog
programmes for those in need of such therapy, transparency and assurance of good animal
welfare is a key priority. Extension of the Ottawa Charter to include non-human animals

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5801

and their welfare, with leveraging through a One Welfare approach, would promote human
health beyond its current boundaries.
