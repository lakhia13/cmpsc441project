Summary

Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and 
binge-eating  disorder,  have  a  deep  social  impact,  concluding 
with  death  in  cases  of  severe  disease.  Eating  disorders  affect 
up to 5% of the population in the industrialized countries, but 
probably  the  phenomenon  is  under-detection  and  under-diag-
nosis.  Eating  disorders  are  multifactorial  disorders,  resulting 
from  the  interaction  between  environmental  triggers,  psycho-
logical  factors,  but  there  is  also  a  strong  genetic  component. 
In fact, genetic factors predispose for approximately 33-84% to 
anorexia  nervosa,  28-83%  to  bulimia  nervosa,  and  41-57%  to 
binge  eating  disorder.  Twins  and  family  studies  have  provided 
an  unassailable  proof  on  the  heritability  of  these  disorders. 

Other  types  of  genetic  studies,  including  genome-wide  associ-
ation  studies,  whole  genome  sequencing  and  linkage  analysis, 
allowed to identify the genes and their variants associated with 
eating disorders and moreover global collaborative efforts have 
led to delineate the etiology of these disorders. Next Generation 
Sequencing technologies can be considered as an ideal diagnos-
tic approach to identify not only the common variants, such as 
single nucleotide polymorphism, but also rare variants. Here we 
summarize the present knowledge on the molecular etiology and 
genetic determinants of eating disorders including serotonergic 
genes,  dopaminergic  genes,  opioid  genes,  appetite  regulation 
genes, endocannabinoid genes and vitamin D3.

Introduction

Eating disorders (EDs) are disorders characterized by an 
alteration  in  eating  habits  and  by  excessive  worry  and 
distorted  vision  of  one’s  own  body  weight,  associated 
with a high rate of morbility and mortality [1]. The main 
EDs recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manu-
al of Mental Disorders are anorexia nervosa (AN), that is 
characterized by distorted body image and weight loss, 
bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED) 
characterized by consume of large quantities of food in 
a  short  time  with  loss  of  control,  which  in  the  case  of 
BN can be followed by compensatory behaviors such as 
abuse of diuretics and laxatives and self-induced vom-
iting  [2]. About  70  million  people  across  the  world  of 
every gender, age and ethnic group have been reported 
an  eating  disorder.  The  etiology  of  eating  disorders  is 
influenced by developmental, social, and biological pro-
cesses [3].
By twin and family studies, it was extensively demon-
strated that eating disorders are heritable [4]. These stud-
ies had also demonstrated a high level of shared genetics 
between  AN  and  BN  [5-6].  Subsequent  genome-wide 
association  studies  (GWAS)  were  fundamental  to  un-
derstand  the  molecular  mechanisms  involved  in  eating 

disorders. In particular, genetic risk score from GWAS 
results can be very useful in clinical practice [7]. Cur-
rently,  there  are  especially  GWAS  results  on  anorexia 
nervosa  with  multiple  genetic  loci  identification,  sug-
gesting that several genetic variants are associated with 
AN disease risk [8]. 
The  role  of  rare  and  structural  variants  in  eating  dis-
orders  it  was  explored  by  studies  of  whole-exome  and 
whole-genome analyses. Instead, gene expression stud-
ies had offer insight into the genes and molecular mech-
anisms that influence phenotypes [4].
Several neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and hormones 
are  involved  in  eating  disorders.  The  complex  brain 
homeostatic  control  of  feeding  involves  neural  circuits 
located  in  the  hypothalamus  (hunger  signals,  initiating 
feeding  behavior)  and  the  brainstem  (satiation  signals, 
limiting meal size) [9]. Hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neu-
rons  produce  Neuropeptide Y  and Agouti-related  pep-
tide responsible for an orexigenic signal increasing the 
ACTH,  cortisol  and  prolactin  release  and  involved  in 
appetite regulation. These neuropeptides are associated 
to  high  food  intake  with  up-regulation  in AN  [10].  In-
stead, orexins are orexigenic neuropeptides involved in 
endocrine system regulation, with an important function 
in insulin, glucagon, and leptin secretion in response to

 OPEN ACCESS   glucose  [11]. Another  neuropeptide  involved  in  eating 
disorders is Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is an anorex-
igenic  peptide  at  the  hypothalamic  ARC  regulated  by 
leptin  [12].  Several  research  connect  also  the  peptidic 
hormone oxytocin signaling and eating disorders. Spe-
cific oxytocin receptor genes polymorphisms have been 
found [13].
Neurobiological  mechanisms  underlying  eating  disor-
ders might involve an overreaction of the immune sys-
tem, generating, in turn, a dysfunction of neuropeptide 
signaling. Also, the brain- gut-microbiota axis allows a 
bidirectional communication between gut microbes and 
the brain through endocrine, neural, immune, and meta-
bolic pathways [9].
Although  determining  the  cause  of  eating  disorders  is 
complex because there are both genetic and environment 
factors that can contribute to their development, there is 
growing scientific interest to identifying causal genes of 
eating disorders. 
Genetics  research  can  improve  knowledge  about  the 
heritability of eating disorders thanks to new molecular 
technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing [4].
Here,  we  focus  on  genetic  knowledge  summarized  in 
order of the type of eating disorder considering all the 
most recent genetic results.

Anorexia nervosa

The  genetic  mechanisms  underlying  AN  have  been  the 
most  investigated  and  studies  related  to  this  disorder  are 
those that have provided the most results. AN is a multifac-
torial disorder with a strong genetic component. The famil-
ial nature of AN has already been demonstrated for several 
decades, with a heritability range of 33-84% [14-15].
Several genetic studies have made it possible to identify 
many genetic loci involved in molecular pathways that 
might lead to anorexia [16]. 
•  Serotonergic genes: the serotonin or 5-hydroxytrypt-
amine  (5-HT)  system  is  involved  in  food  intake, 
mood, and body weight regulation [17]. It has been 
hypothesized that 5-HT activity is altered in the acute 
illness state of AN. Most positron emission tomogra-
phy studies of AN patients have targeted the 5HT1A 
and 5HT2A receptors and 5HTT [18]. In particular, 
important AN targets could be the 5-HT2A receptor 
gene  and  the  5HT-transporter-linked  polymorphic 
region  (5-HTTLPR)  [19]. An  increase  in  5-HT  re-
uptake  occurs  following  the  administration  of  es-
trogens  which  alter  the  mRNA  and  protein  levels 
of  some  markers  of  serotonin  [20].  Moreover,  AN 
patients may have HTR1D gene variations [21]. Re-
cently,  it  has  been  identified  a  positive  relationship 
between  the  serotonin  transporter  gene  SLC6A4 
methylation  levels  and  resting-state  functional  con-
nectivity  between  the  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex 
and the salience network in AN patients [22]. Any-
way, it is unlikely that this pathway is the only one 
involved in the onset of AN in a subject because it is 
associated with numerous psychiatric disorders and 

therefore cannot be considered a specific vulnerabil-
ity factor for AN [16-19].

•  Dopaminergic  genes:  The  dopaminergic  system 
modulates  thinking  processes,  reward,  emotional 
behavior,  substance  dependence,  feeding  and  mo-
tor activity. Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine that 
acts  primly  through  of  two  G  protein-coupled  DA, 
D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) receptors. DA has been im-
plicated in the pathophysiology of AN by preclinical 
and clinical evidence. A gene that plays an important 
role in the dopamine system is DAT1 that encodes a 
transmembrane  protein  that  regulates  dopamine  re-
uptake from synapses and possesses variable number 
of tandem repeats in its 3’-untranslated region. Poly-
morphisms in the number of repeats influence DAT1 
expression  (VNTR  10R/9R).  The  TaqIA  restriction 
endonuclease  site  in  DRD2  (rs1800497)  has  been 
shown to reduce the density of D2 autoreceptors in 
the striatum. Moreover, the rs6280 variant in DRD3 
increases the affinity for endogenous dopamine. Re-
cently,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  AN  patients 
carrying the homozygous variant Gly9Gly genotype 
in the dopamine D3 receptor have worse symptom-
atology [23].

•  Opioid genes: Opioid receptors are involved in food 
intake, reward sensitivity, pain, and vulnerability to 
addictive disorders. Several OPRD1 polymorphisms 
were associated with AN. In particular, OPRD1 vari-
ants were associated with AN restricting type [21].
•  Appetite Regulation Genes: The communication be-
tween  gut  and  hypothalamus  involves  a  huge  num-
bers  of  appetite  hormones.  After  stimulation,  an-
orexigenic peptides are released  while the levels of 
the orexigenic peptide ghrelin reduce. Ghrelin is an 
appetite stimulating hormone produced in the stom-
ach and pancreatic cells that is inversely associated 
with  body  mass  index  (BMI)  [24].  In  response  to 
prolonged starvation the level of ghrelin in the plas-
ma increases [25]. Leptin is a hormone produced by 
adipocytes and involved in the food intake and regu-
lation of energy balance [26]. In AN patients the level 
of plasma circulating leptin in cerebrospinal fluid is 
reduced  (hypoleptinemia)  [27].  The  serum  level  of 
leptin  is  significantly  decreased  in AN  patients  but 
only  moderately  increased  in  obese  patients  [28]. 
An increased concentration of NPY, which mediates 
leptin receptors, is associated to body mass deficien-
cy with high concentrations of leptin, suggesting de-
fects in the regulatory axis [29].
The pancreatic polypeptide (PP) peptide tyrosine-ty-
rosine  (PYY)  belongs  to  NPY  family  and  is  post-
prandially  secreted  in  ileum  and  colon  with  an  an-
orexigenic  role  [30].  Its  peripheral  administration 
decreases  appetite  along  with  weight  loss  through 
inhibition  of  the  arcuate  hypothalamic  nucleus  ex-
pression of NPY/AGRP [31]. Anyway, serum levels 
of PYY hormone are less diminished in AN as com-
parated to BN/BED [6].
Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptidic hormone of the 
gastrointestinal system that promotes satiety but has 

E298

K. DONATO ET AL.been also associated with anxiety [32]. CCK plasma 
levels  in AN  patients  and  control  group  are  similar 
both  prior  to  and  after  a  fooding  suggesting  a  hor-
monal adaptation. However, in older analysis, in AN 
patients CKK plasma showed a postprandial increase 
[33-34].
GLP-1  is  a  brain-gut  peptide  that  exerts  a  hor-
mone-neurotransmitter action increasing satiety and 
inhibiting  food  intake,  energetic  expenditure,  and 
insulin levels [35]. GLP-1 level decreases in AN pa-
tients,  while  insulin  and  glucagon  levels  increase, 
indicating an alteration in glucose homeostasis [36]. 
Oxyntomodulin (OXM), which acts through GLP-1 
receptor,  inhibits  food  intake,  and  reduces  plasma 
levels of ghrelin [24].

•  Endocannabinoid  genes:  endocannabinoid  system 
controls food intake through both central and periph-
eral  mechanisms.  CB1  and  CB2,  the  cannabinoid 
receptors,  are  expressed  in  multiple  brain  regions 
that  control  food  intake  [37].  Genetic  variants  in 
CNR1  and  CNR2  genes,  influence  food  intake  and 
body  weight  and  they  have  been  associated  to AN 
[38]. Systemic and local administrations in animals 
of both exogenous cannabinoids (i.e. THC) and en-
docannabinoids  (i.e. AEA,  2-AG)  increase  food  in-
take [39]. CB1 receptor antagonists are hypophagic 
and reduce body weight [40]. Cannabidiol, quite the 
opposite, can prevent the hyperphagic effect induced 
by  the  CB1  receptor  agonist  [41-42].  Genetic  vari-
ants in CNR1, which encodes the CB1 receptor, are 
related to the susceptibility to AN. The basis of the 
non-Mendelian  inheritance  of AN  could  be  associ-
ated  with  CNR1  (AAT)n  trinucleotide  repeats,  but 
functional studies are needed to prove the differential 
effect [43].
Anandamide,  also  known  as  arachidonoylethanol-
amine (AEA) plays a key role in feeding behaviour 
generating  pleasure  after  food  consumption  [44]. 
Plasma levels of this lipid mediator are downregulat-
ed in AN patients [45]. 
In fact, anandamide binds to CB1R and inhibits neu-
ronal differentiation [46]. 
Palmitoylethanolamide  (PEA)  binds  the  cannabi-
noid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. 
The anorectic action of exogenous PEA is mediated 
by transcription factor PPARα in the small intestine 
[47]. After a high-fat feeding in mouse the concen-
tration of PEA decreases [48]. Plasma PEA concen-
tration  increases  in AN  patients  after  exposure  to  a 
non-favorite meal [49]. 

•  Vitamin D3: Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone whose 
deficiency, that leads to defects in bone mineraliza-
tion,  has  been  associated  to  AN  [50-51].  Vitamin 
D3  modulates  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  re-
ceptor  gamma  (PPARγ),  involved  in  inflammation 
related  to  the  diet  [52].  The  role  of  vitamin  D3  in 
AN might be associated to its ability to regulate neu-
rotrophic  factors,  guaranteeing  neuroprotection  and 
neurotransmission control [53]. 

E299

By linkage and association studies on AN, chromosomes 
1,  2,  4,  and  13  were  identified  as  possible  regions  as-
sociated to AN. The analyzed genes were associated to 
neural signaling, either by neurotransmitters or by hor-
mones affecting the satiety regulatory system in subcor-
tical structures of the brain, such as the hypothalamus. 
However, the small sample size of these type of studies 
was a limit and meta-analyses gived disaccord evidence 
[5].
Several  GWAS  for  the  identification  of  genetic  vari-
ations  related  to  the  disorder  were  conducted  on  AN. 
Until 2019 a single genome-wide locus on chromosome 
12 (lead SNP: rs4622308) related to AN was identified 
in a region that regard also diabetes mellitus type 1 and 
autoimmune  disorders.  Interestingly,  successively  the 
Anorexia  Nervosa  Genetics  Initiative  (ANGI)  the  Ge-
netic  Consortium  for Anorexia  Nervosa  (GCAN),  and 
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium-3 (WTC-
CC-3) along with UK Biobank have detected eight chro-
mosomal  regions,  comprising  120  genes,  significantly 
associated  with  AN.  Analyses  in  silico  and  research 
by available large-scale in vitro data have revealed that 
four  of  the  genes  of  these  chromosome  regions  might 
be  more  likely  to  be  associated  to  the  AN  etiology: 
CADM1, MGMT, FOXP1, and PTBP2 [8, 16, 17]. Inter-
estingly, Hinney et al. (2017) [53] described three sig-
nificantly altered loci correlating AN risk with increased 
BMI. The genes associated to those loci are CTBP2, CC-
NE1, CARF and NBEAL1 [54]. In a large screening of 
152 candidate genes by GWAS rare variants associated 
to AN were identified in EPHX2 that encodes a protein 
involved in cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, variants 
in ESR2, encoding the estrogen receptor 2, can be asso-
ciated with AN in female [55].However, at the base of 
the limits of these studies there are several factors, such 
as the winner’s curse, small sample size, moderator vari-
ables explaining and lack of heterogeneity of the cohorts 
[4, 8]. Anyway, the results of these GWAS showed that 
AN is highly polygenic. 
By  whole  genome  sequencing  and  linkage  analysis  to 
analyze two families with recurrence of eating disorders, 
were detected a missense variant cosegregating with the 
affected  family  members  in  ESRRA,  and  a  potentially 
damaging variant in HDAC4 (histone deacetylase 4) that 
play a significant role in the estrogen system. transcrip-
tional  studies  revealed  that  expression  of  the  HDAC4 
deacetylase  repressed  the  transcription  of  ESRRA-  in-
duced target genes, whereas ESRRA and HDAC4 exhib-
ited interaction in both in vivo and in vitro studies. For 
which variants in ESRRA and HDAC4 cause a decrease 
in the activity of ESRRA and an increase in the likeli-
hood of AN onset [56].
By  familial  whole-exome  analysis,  were  been  identi-
fied  variants  of  NNAT  in  two  male AN  probands:  one 
nonsense variant (p.Trp33*) and one rare variant in the 
5′UTR. Moreover, by a large screening were identified 
11 NNAT variants in AN patients (40% male and 6% fe-
male) [57].
In an another whole-exome sequencing study were iden-
tified  genes  carrying  damaging  variants  belonged  to 

GENE VARIANTS IN EATING DISORDERS. FOCUS ON ANOREXIA NERVOSA, BULIMIA NERVOSA, AND BINGE-EATING DISORDER three pathways: (a) neuropeptide hormone signaling, (b) 
inflammatory  pathway,  and  (c)  cholinergic  neurotrans-
mission [58]. 
Recently, have been sequenced the whole exome of one 
family and found three ultra-rare deleterious variants of 
DRD4, NMS, and CCKAR, linked with the reward path-
way, in three affected members. In the other study, the 
authors identified de novo variants in CSMD1, CREB3, 
PTPRD  and  GAB1  involved  in  the  dopamine  pathway 
and neuron differentiation [59, 60].
Epigenetic  mechanism  may  help  initiate  and  maintain 
AN. Frieling et al. described higher levels of methylation 
in the promotors of DAT1 (dopamine active transporter 
1)  and  DRD2  (dopamine  receptor  D2)  in AN  patients. 
Other study linked AN weight loss to hypermethylation 
and reduced expression of POMC [61]. 

Bulimia nervosa

Twin studies have yielded heritability estimates for BN 
ranging from 28% to 83% [14, 15]. As for AN, specific 
biological systems are involved in BN.
•  Serotonergic genes: As with AN, BN patients devel-
op an egosyntonic personality and is associated with 
other  psychiatric  diseases,  moreover  medications 
acting over 5-HT pathways are efficacy over BN pa-
tients, so it is conceivable role of serotonergic system 
dysfunction  in  eating  disorders  onset  and  progres-
sion  [62]. Abnormalities  in  peripheral  5-HT  uptake 
have been observed in BN patients [63]. As with AN, 
most genetic studies of the 5-HT system in BN have 
focused on the 5-HTTLPR transporter gene and the 
5-HT2A receptor gene [64]. However, there are con-
flicting  results  on  the  involvement  of  this  route  on 
the BN [19].

•  Dopaminergic genes: The dopaminergic system has 
also been of interest in the pathophysiology of BN, in 
fact abnormalities in DA system have been observed 
through neuroimaging investigations [65]. Mesocor-
ticolimbic dopaminergic alterations correlate with an 
high physical activity in BN patients and can trigger 
a dopamine-dependent stress response. The dopami-
nergic system modulates thinking processes, reward, 
emotional  behavior,  substance  dependence,  feeding 
and  motor  activity.  Dopamine  (DA)  is  a  catechol-
amine that acts primly through of two G protein-cou-
pled DA, D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) receptors. DA has 
been  implicated  in  the  pathophysiology  of  AN  by 
preclinical  and  clinical  evidence. A  gene  that  plays 
an  important  role  in  the  dopamine  system  is  DAT1 
that encodes a transmembrane protein that regulates 
dopamine  reuptake  from  synapses  and  possesses 
variable  number  of  tandem  repeats  (VNTRs)  in  its 
3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR). Polymorphisms in 
the  number  of  repeats  influence  DAT1  expression 
(VNTR  10R/9R). The TaqIA  restriction  endonucle-
ase site in DRD2 (rs1800497) has been shown to re-
duce the density of D2 autoreceptors in the striatum. 
Moreover, the rs6280 variant in DRD3 increases the 

affinity  for  endogenous  dopamine.  Recently,  it  has 
been  demonstrated  that  AN  patients  carrying  the 
homozygous variant Gly9Gly genotype in the dopa-
mine D3 receptor have worse symptomatology [66].
•  Opioid genes: opioid peptides play a key role in feed-
ing behaviour generating motivation and pleasure in 
food consumption, so it is likely to believe that opi-
oid genes also play a decisive role in BN [43]. In fact, 
some  reward-related  brain  dysfunctions  have  been 
described also on rodent animal models of BN by af-
fecting also opioid levels [67]. The bulimia treatment 
with  naloxone  that  is  an  opioid  receptor  blocker  is 
very effective [68]. 

•  Appetite  Regulation  Genes:  Although  appetite  reg-
ulation  genes  are  genetic  candidates  to  BN,  studies 
thus far have been limited as compared to AN stud-
ies. Polymorphisms in ghrelin and its receptor GHS-
R1a are not associated with bulimia [69]. 

Although  leptin  modulate  reward-related  behavior  that 
has  a  relationship  with  BN,  currently  conflicting  re-
sults were obtained on the association of reward learn-
ing and plasma leptin levels in BN. However, a positive 
correlation of plasma leptin levels and BMI in subjects 
with  BN  has  been  described.  The  plasma  leptin  levels 
are restored in remitted BN patients and are a relevant 
factor for remission [70]. Finally, serum levels of PYY 
hormone  are  decreased  in  BN  patients  compared  with 
AN patients [71]. Anyway, basal plasma PYY levels in-
crease in the phases of abstinence from binge eating and 
vomiting to return to control levels after recovery in BN. 
However, fasting plasma PYY levels during symptomat-
ic phase of BN were unchanged. BN patients have im-
paired secretion of CKK that is a satiety factor and PYY 
secretion  inductor.  Hence,  depressed  PYY  levels  may 
result from reduced CCK secretion. Moreover, there is a 
negative correlation between PYY increase and ghrelin 
decrease. For which a pathway involving peripheral hor-
monal signals, such as ghrelin and PYY, may be related 
to  BN  [72].  GLP-1  secretory  decrease  was  detected  in 
BN patients being this concurrence limited to binge-eat-
ing and vomiting episodes [73].
•  Endocannabinoid  genes:  the  endocannabinoid  sys-

tem plays an important role in the control

•  of  BN  by  acting  via  central  and  peripheral  mecha-
nisms.  FAAH  and  CNR1  polymorphisms  have  been 
associated to BN, but not found a synergistic effect 
of the two polymorphisms in BN. An association of 
a CNR2 polymorphism with BN has also been iden-
tified [74].

•  Vitamin D3: BN patients can show severe hypovita-
minosis D3 responsible for lack of inflammatory re-
sponse and reduction in mood in patients with long-
term eating disorders. 

Many  linkage  and  candidate  gene  studies  of  BN  have 
been  conducted  but  have  provided  few  definitive  con-
clusions. Interestingly, in a linkage study of 308 families 
with BN a suggestive peak of linkage on chromosome 
10p13-12 already associated to obesity was been iden-
tified. This linkage value increased in families with BN 
and self-induced vomiting [75].

K. DONATO ET AL.By a GWAS three polymorphism for HTR2A have been 
associated  with  poor  treatment  response  in  BN  pa-
tients [76].

Binge-eating disorder

Twins’  studies  have  showed  that  the  heritability  of 
BED is 41-57% [15]. BED, obesity, and weight-related 
co-morbidities are genetically correlated [77].
Specific biological systems are involved also in BED.
•  Serotonergic Genes: Polymorphisms of three seroto-
nergic genes, 5-HTT, 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A have been 
investigated in BED [78]. In particular, important re-
sults were found by Monteleone et al., who analyzed 
the  5-HTTLPR  polymorphism  of  the  5-HTT  gene 
more frequent in obese people with BED [69, 78].
•  Dopaminergic genes: Several studies have been ex-
amined the role of polymorphisms of 6 dopaminer-
gic genes in BED: DRD2, ANKK1, OPRM1, COMT, 
DAT1,  and  DRD3  [76].  In  particular,  the  polymor-
phism Taq1A of DRD2 in BED patients is associated 
to higher reward sensitivity and obesity [78-80].
•  Opioid genes: The opioid antagonists treatment de-
crease  intake  of  fat  and  sucrose  diets  and  suppress 
palatable food intake [81]. Interestingly, in rat BED 
model, memantine treatment blocks the compulsivi-
ty associated with the intake of the highly palatable 
food [82].

•  Appetite  Regulation  Genes:  Serum  levels  of  PYY 
hormone are decreased in BED compared with AN 
[71].

•  Other  Genes:  Several  polymorphisms  of  8  other 
genes  in  BED  have  been  investigated:  GR,  MC4R, 
BDNF, prepro-NPY, prepro-GHRL, FAAH, FTO and 
CLOCK.  A  significant  association  was  found  be-
tween the polymorphism rs6198 within exon 9 beta 
of NR3C1and BED [78].

In a GWAS 15 polymorphisms in HTR2A, a gene impli-
cated in appetite process and satiety, have been analyzed 
in  BED  and  the  polymorphism  rs2296972  in  HTR2A 
has  been  associated  with  trend  level  of  less  likelihood 
of BED [76].
In  conclusion,  several  genetic  factors  contribute  to  the 
etiology  of  eating  disorders.  The  genetic  studies  show 
that  while  there  are  great  genetic  similarities  between 
AN,  BN  and  BED,  there  are  also  notable  differences. 
Anyway, it is important a correct diagnosis also genetic 
because eating-disorders have a deep social impact and 
an enormous cost to public healthcare systems [83]. An 
important  goal  for  clinical  care  of  eating  disorders  is 
obtaining  individual-level  genetic  information  for  im-
proving  management  of  the  patients.  Indeed,  a  precise 
genetic diagnosis of eating disorders is complicated by 
the fact that a complex and dynamic interplay between 
environmental  factors,  epigenetic  marks,  and  genetic 
predisposition  is  involved  in  the  development  of  these 
disorders.  Gene  variants  identification  in  known  genes 
and novel candidate genes identification are necessary. 
The  limited  success  of  genetic  studies  so  far  may  also 

E301

result from a focus on symptoms of the disorders, rather 
than the causes of them. Currently, it’s possible integrat-
ing  basic  scientific  understanding  of  the  role  of  genet-
ic risk in eating disorders into clinical practice and the 
ability to identify genetic markers of risk could allow for 
early screening in those at high risk. By genetic analysis 
can be obtained results to pursue to examine treatment 
response. Findings can also be included in multifactorial 
risk estimation algorithms that account for other genet-
ic factors, such as rare variants, and environmental risk 
factors to improve prediction. Moreover, the use of ani-
mal models to determine genetic influences on feeding 
can improve understanding of genes that might represent 
novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for eating disorders. 
It  is  clear  that  there  is  a  need  for  a  specific  and  com-
prehensive  molecular  diagnostic  test  with  optimal  per-
formance  for  the  diagnosis  of  eating  disorders.  In  this 
scenario,  the  usefulness  of  next-generation  sequencing 
technology arises. It would be useful to use a molecular 
test that may include genes that have been found to carry 
polymorphisms conferring a higher susceptibility to the 
onset of eating disorders, genes that have been found to 
carry rare variants in eating disorders patients for whom 
segregation analysis has been performed, genes associ-
ated with syndromes presenting eating disorders among 
their  main  features  and  genes  that  have  been  found  to 
carry polymorphisms conferring a higher susceptibility 
to  the  onset  of  disorders  of  food  intake  [16].  The  UK 
Biobank (ukbiobank.ac.uk) is a unique epidemiological 
resource to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment 
of psychiatric and somatic illnesses [84]. Recently, it has 
been  processed  the  Eating  Disorders  Genetic  Initiative 
(EDGI)  designed  to  expand  genomic  discovery  across 
the three major eating disorders, AN, BN and BED, that 
represents  the  largest  genetic  study  of  eating  disorders 
ever to be conducted and it builds on the Eating Disor-
ders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Con-
sortium (PGC-ED and ANGI) studies. The data that ED-
GI regard the genetic factors influencing stability versus 
fluctuation  of  eating  disorder  clinical  presentation  and 
precision-medicine questions regarding identification of 
optimal interventions informed by genotype [85]. There-
fore, ever new scientific efforts are underway to identify 
the genetic basis of eating disorders and to develop bet-
ter eating disorders patient management.
