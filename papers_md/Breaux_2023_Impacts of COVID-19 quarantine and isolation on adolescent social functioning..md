Abstract
This review discusses research conducted globally between
March 2020 and March 2023 examining the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent social functioning,
including their lifestyle, extracurricular activities, family envi-
ronment, peer environment, and social skills. Research high-
lights the widespread impact, with largely negative effects.
However, a handful of studies support improved quality of re-
lationships for some young people. Study findings underscore
the importance of technology for fostering social communica-
tion and connectedness during periods of isolation and quar-
antine. Most studies specifically examining social skills were
cross-sectional and conducted in clinical populations, such as
autistic or socially anxious youth. As such, it is critical that
ongoing research examines the long-term social impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and ways to promote meaningful social
connectedness via virtual interactions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, and its associated quarantine
and isolation measures, resulted in signiﬁcant disrup-
tions to in-person social interactions, which has placed
adolescents at risk for negative social development
outcomes [1]. In fact, it has been suggested that ado-
lescents are more affected than adults by the social
impact of the pandemic [2], and one of the most
frequently endorsed challenges by parents during the
pandemic includes the lack of social interaction for their
adolescents [3]. This social impact extends to adoles-
cent well-being. Speciﬁcally, research suggests that
isolation and loneliness were associated with
social
ideation
increased anxiety, depression, and suicidal
among youth [4], and that less in-person and digital
socialization, more social isolation, and less social sup-
port were associated with greater psychopathology
during the pandemic, controlling for pre-pandemic
symptoms [5]. The current article reviews COVID-19-
related research published globally between March
2020 and March 2023 and discusses the impact of the
pandemic on the lifestyle, extracurricular activities,
family social environment, peer social environment, and
social skills of adolescents.1 Results are summarized
below and in Figure 1. We end our review by providing
suggestions for how to support adolescents emerging out
of the current pandemic and during future periods of
quarantine and isolation.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
lifestyle and extracurricular activities
The overall lifestyle of adolescents has been drastically
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Speciﬁcally,
research suggests they had decreased access to quality
food, increased fast food consumption, reduced physical
activity, increased sedentary behavior, reduced driving
days/miles driven, and increased screen time for leisure
[6e11], with some evidence that adolescents were more
impacted than children [8] and adults [9]. Such lifestyle
changes have been linked to adolescent mental health
outcomes. For example, excessive media exposure
during the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to

anxiety symptoms [12], and low levels of physical ac-
tivity were associated with higher
levels of mood
disturbance [10]. However, not all studies found an as-
sociation between social technology use and adolescent
well-being [13,14]. This may be because adolescents
more frequently checked social media, used technology
before bed, and engaged in problematic internet use,
but also were more likely to engage positively with social
and use online communication for social support [13],
with positive online experiences mitigating feelings of
loneliness and stress [14].

also signiﬁcantly

COVID-19 pandemic, especially the ﬁrst year of the
pandemic [15,16]. Notably, artistic activities such as
music were the least impacted extracurricular activities,
followed by participation in scout, religious/spiritual,
academic (e.g., science), and athletic activities. Col-
lective sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, baseball) were the
most impacted, with an almost 90% reduction [15].

Limited research during the COVID-19 pandemic
explored the use of virtual interactions to support social
connectedness and engagement in extracurricular ac-
tivities during the COVID-19 pandemic. An example of
one such program, a telehealth school-based prevention
program for newcomer Latine immigrant youth found
that despite moving to a telehealth model, youth re-
ported feeling socially connected to each other through
the program [17]. Despite limited research on the topic,
there were countless examples of adolescents coming
together to conduct virtual choir concerts (see North
Allegheny Virtual Choir Baba Yetu, for an example) or
band performances (see Woodbury HS Virtual Band -
“The Mandalorian”, for an example) when classes were
moved virtually in March 2020 in the United States. It is
likely that such efforts helped foster social connected-
ness and improve student well-being during times of
isolation and quarantine.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family
social environment
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in adolescents
spending signiﬁcantly more time with family members,
with such time providing both beneﬁts and concerns.
Speciﬁcally,
increased family time and increased
parental understanding of youth learning needs were
cited as two of the main beneﬁts of the COVID-19
pandemic by parents [3]. There is also some evi-
dence of improved quality of family relationships and
play between siblings, particularly for older adolescents
[18e20]. However, research also highlights challenges
in this area. Some adolescents became caregivers when
parents were unavailable, with such experiences
disproportionately affecting low income families and
Black and Latine communities [20]. Despite some

studies ﬁnding improved family relationships, other
research suggests that the pandemic has resulted in
more negative relationship quality with parents,
increased family chaos and conﬂict, as well as risk for
child abuse and exposure to intrafamilial violence and
intimate partner violence [2,18,21,22]. Of note,
adolescent
relationship quality with parents was
directly related to their mental health during the
COVID-19 pandemic [18]. Additionally, the pandemic
has resulted in decreased parentechild intimacy, sib-
ling intimacy, and sibling disclosure for some young
people [22].

Importantly, research has sought to explore factors that
may predict risk versus resilience among families during
the pandemic. For example, even though family income
was not related to change in family organization (e.g.,
home is calm), families of lower socioeconomic statuses
had lower family organization at both timepoints [22].
Additionally, social isolation during the ﬁrst two weeks
of the pandemic was associated with an increase in
parents spanking or hitting their children [23]. In
contrast, practicing collective hobbies with family
members and assisting each other with household
chores strengthened family relationships during the
COVID-19 pandemic [24]. Interestingly, parenting
practices during the pandemic related to both family
and non-family social interactions [25], highlighting the
important role of parents and the family for adolescent
social functioning.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peer
relationships
As would be expected, peer relationships were also
impacted for many adolescents. In one study, 682
families in the United States from ﬁve Midwestern
states with two adolescent-aged children (89% girls;
Mage = 16 years) reported engaging in fewer in-
person/face-to-face interactions with peers and more
online interactions [26]. Despite this, they actually
reported higher quality of social interactions overall, and
more speciﬁcally, a higher quality of face-to-face in-
teractions with peers during the pandemic compared
to pre-pandemic. Authors speculated that this ﬁnding
may have resulted from adolescents being more se-
lective in the peers that they interacted with (e.g.,
closer friends, romantic partners), underscoring the
importance of high-quality social interactions rather
than just the number of socialization opportunities.
Interestingly, research suggests that adolescents who

However, research is mixed regarding observed peer
social dynamics and social impacts during the COVID-
19 pandemic. For example, Gadassi Polack and

4 Generation COVID: Coming of Age Amid the Pandemic

colleagues [19] found that in a sample of 139 youth ages
8e15 years in the US, younger adolescents experienced
signiﬁcant decreases
in negative and positive in-
teractions with friends, whereas older adolescents only
experienced signiﬁcant decreases in negative ones. With
regard to bullying, some research found reductions in
bullying/victimization among 49 children and adoles-
cents with neurodevelopmental disorders
in rural
Appalachia (US) ages 6e17 years and 272 adolescents in
the Midwestern US aged 10e15 years from a commu-
nity sample [27,28], whereas other research found that a
third of adolescents aged 11e17 years in the US
(N = 452; 55% female) indicated that cyberbullying
became more problematic during the pandemic [29].

Similarly, ﬁndings regarding the role of virtual social
interactions were mixed. For example, Canadian ado-
lescents (N = 1054) who reported spending more time
virtually with peers reported higher levels of depression
[30], and Lebanese adolescents (N = 178) who reported
spending more time on social media during the
pandemic had more social anxiety symptoms [31].
However, studies examining the speciﬁcity of these
virtual social interactions have actually uncovered that
messaging and video chatting with peers facilitated
social connectedness and closeness during social isola-
tion due to COVID-19, whereas social media did not
[31,32]. Therefore, it’s important for researchers and
families to distinguish between types of virtual social
interactions. More passive social technologies, like social
media, are not necessarily dependent upon strong
friendships and therefore, are less likely to be indices of
friendships/peer networks.

Certain subsets of youth may have had unique social
experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. For
example, certain clinical populations, such as youth with
social anxiety, were particularly likely to experience
loneliness/social isolation, with avoidance behaviors in
social anxiety being reinforced by social distancing [33].
Additionally, adolescents with marginalized identities
(e.g., gender nonbinary, LGBTQ-identifying, and Latine
or Asian adolescents) reported higher perceived friend
support from social media during the pandemic [34].
Greater impacts were also evident for youth from lower
socioeconomic status families: they were more impacted
in terms of increased social anxiety [31] and likelihood
to be working and thus exposed to the coronavirus [34].

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social
skills
Early in the pandemic, it was speculated that there
impact for youth [2,36].
would be signiﬁcant social
Although there is not widespread evidence of such
negative impact, research highlights a multitude of
factors that contribute to the impact of the pandemic on
youth social skills. First, masking may have impacted

children’s, particularly preschoolers, ability to read
emotions and develop social skills (e.g., trust attribu-
tions) from facial expressions [37]; however, it appears
that this impact was not present for adolescents [38]. At
the same time, youth with diagnosed disorders charac-
terized by social-communication deﬁcits,
such as
neurodevelopmental disorders, may be particularly
impacted due to lack of opportunity to practice. For
example, in a qualitative study, parents reported con-
cerns regarding lack of opportunities to practice social
skills, with regression in previously mastered social skills
being reported for autistic children and adolescents
aged 3e18 years [39]. In this vein, self-regulation and
cooperation skills of autistic children also decreased
during the pandemic [40]. However, a small subset of
parents of autistic youth indicated that reduced social
interactions resulted in less stress for their child [39].

Finally, parents’ functioning during the pandemic likely
had direct and indirect impacts on children’s social
functioning during this time. For example, parenting
practices and parent technology use have been linked to
youth social-emotional functioning during pandemic
such that unsupportive parenting practices were linked
to worse youth adjustment and more emotion dysregu-
lation [41] and parent use of technology was linked to
worse youth social competence [42]. Collectively these
ﬁndings suggest that social skills were impacted for at
least a portion of children and adolescents, and various
factors at the child and family level may explain differ-
ences during periods of quarantine and social distancing.

Conclusions and recommendations for
future times of quarantine and isolation
Social connection and belongingness with close others
are of crucial importance for adaptive development [43].
Social interactions are most valuable when they are
facilitating personally meaningful interactions with highly
valued social supports. For example, a qualitative study
with sexual minority adolescents identiﬁed that youth
engaged primarily in ﬁve self-care practices: relation-
ships, routines, body and mind, rest and reset, and
tuning out, with relationships (i.e., spending time with
others) being identiﬁed as the most important form of
self-care [46]. Of note, social interactions for today’s
youth often include virtual interactions [44]. Research
during the pandemic suggests that texting and video
chatting with peers can facilitate social connectedness
and closeness [31]. Such online communication has
likely served as a valuable placeholder when face-to-face
interactions were restricted, with this possibly being one
of the reasons why so many adolescents have remained
resilient throughout the pandemic. For example, Dvor-
sky and colleagues [45] found that coping with the
COVID-19 pandemic by using technology (e.g., talking
with online community over video games) and/or social
engagement (e.g., talking with friends, playing board

games with family) buffered against the negative im-
pacts on adolescent well-being. It is unclear whether it
is the engagement in interactive social technologies that
drives stronger friendship quality and social connections
[26] or if it is that youth with a solid social network and
social
support more generally feel more socially
connected and therefore engage in more frequent social
technology use. Regardless, current ﬁndings from the
COVID-19 pandemic suggest that it will be important
to emphasize continued efforts to build meaningful
social connections proactively and maintain these during
future periods

leveraging technology. Schools could consider smaller
virtual groups rather than large virtual classrooms,

Additionally, we would argue that beyond peer
connectedness, it is critical to focus on facilitating pos-
itive family social connections during times of isolation/
quarantine, since that is who adolescents are interacting
with most. Parents play a key role in facilitating social
support, building social functioning, and improving well-
being in youth [18,25]. Findings from this review un-
derscore that the role of parents and siblings shifted
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and parents
in
particular had to fulﬁll multiple roles. It is critical for the
ﬁeld to continue to explore how the quality and changes
in parentechild relationships may impact youth’s
broader
functioning and well-being in the
long-term.
