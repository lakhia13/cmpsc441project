Lamotrigine belongs to the group of antiepileptic drugs and mood stabilizers, and its action is based on the se-
lective blocking of voltage-deficient sodium channels. The effect of this mechanism is the stabilization of the 
presynaptic part of the neuronal membrane and subsequent inhibition of the secretion of the neurotransmit-
ters glutamate and aspartate into the postsynaptic part of the neuron.
Lamotrigine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the maintenance treatment of adults 
with bipolar disorder since 1994. In the field of psychiatry, this medicine is also used off-label in the treatment 
of acute bipolar depression. Studies show promising effects of the use of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder type 
II with rapid phase change. Bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric problem that most often affects young 
adults. Lamotrigine is most effective in bipolar disorder in preventing depressive episodes, which dominate the 
clinical picture of this disease. The latest research focuses on extending its action, to include manic episodes. 
Lamotrigine, through an unexplained mechanism, can affect the immune system, causing Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
syndrome. These are rare, life-threatening adverse effects that require urgent intervention in the form of drug 
discontinuation and immunosuppressive treatment. Strict contraindications to the use of lamotrigine include 
sensitivity reactions accompanied by systemic symptoms. Phenotype testing enables screening of patients pre-
disposed to serious hypersensitivity reactions. The aim of the article is to review the indications, contraindica-
tions, and adverse effects of lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar disorder and depression.

Introduction

Lamotrigine, as an anticonvulsant drug, was introduced in 1994 
in the United States, when it was approved for the treatment 
of  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  and  in  seizures 
caused by Lennon-Gastaut syndrome [1]. Over time, its great 
potential was noticed in the treatment of affective diseases, 
such as bipolar disorder type 1 with predominance of depres-
sive episodes, in maintenance treatment, and in rapid-cycling 
bipolar depression in adults [1]. Moreover, the results of sev-
eral studies do not exclude the effectiveness of lamotrigine in 
the treatment of an acute depressive episode in the course of 
bipolar disorder [2]. The problem remains the need to gradu-
ally increase the dose to reach an effective level (200-300 mg/
day), when a quick reaction is necessary in the acute phase 
of the disease [2,3]. In 2019, the proposed bipolar disorder 
treatment algorithm published by Giakoumatos and Osser in 
a Harvard study lists lamotrigine as one of the five treatment 
options for an acute episode of depression [2]. The authors re-
ported that the decision belongs to the specialist and depends 
on the individual approach to the patient’s profile, especially 
regarding the reaction to adverse effects and the risk of turn-
ing into mania [2]. Numerous studies have shown the effec-
tiveness and safety of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder, also in 
a pediatric population [4].

Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Course of 
Illness of Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is a chronic and disabling mental illness that 
affects  approximately  1%  of  the  general  population  world-
wide [5]. This is confirmed by bipolar disorder taking 46th place 
on the list of the most common causes of disability-adjust-
ed life years worldwide [3]. In the ICD-10 criteria, the follow-
ing conditions must be met for the final diagnosis of bipolar 
disorder. The current episode meets the criteria for hypoma-
nia, mania, a depressive episode. There has been at least one 
affective episode in the past (hypomanic, manic, depressive, 
mixed).  At  least  one  of  these  affective  episodes  was  other 
than depressive episode, and the episodes were not caused 
by the use of psychoactive substances or organic disorders. 
The average age of onset is usually 15 to 25 years of age [6].

This is a special group of patients, including people who are of 
reproductive age, are able to start a family, and are experienc-
ing the most important period of life in terms of professional 
and spiritual development [7]. It is crucial to provide appropri-
ate and safe treatment options that do not have a teratogen-
ic effect and or pose a significant burden on the metabolism, 
a description that best fits the mode of action of lamotrigi-
ne [7]. The onset of bipolar disorder is most often initiated 
by symptoms of depression, accounting for up to 75% of the 

symptoms presented during the development of the disease 
[6]. Between depressive episodes, patients experience recur-
rent episodes of mania or hypomania. Confirmed risk factors 
for the development of bipolar disorder include experiencing 
the first depressive episode at a young age (before the age of 
25 years), having a diagnosis of many depressive episodes (5 
or more) throughout life, and having a positive family history 
of bipolar disorder [8]. To detect the disease at an earlier stage 
in people with many risk factors, screening tools are used, in-
cluding the Mood Disorders Questionnaire and the Hypomanic 
Symptoms Questionnaire [8]. In more than half of patients with 
bipolar disorder, there is co-occurrence with another psychiat-
ric disease, including personality disorder, panic disorder, so-
cial phobia, and drug disorder [8]. Rapid cycling bipolar disor-
der (RCBD) is diagnosed with a minimum of 4 mood episodes 
meeting the criteria for depression, mania, or hypomania in the 
last 12 months [9]. According to the DSM-5, affective episodes 
must be separated by at least a 2-month period of complete 
or partial remission or a change to an episode of the opposite 
polarity [10]. It is estimated that RCBD affects up to 20% of 
people with bipolar disorder [9]. Treatment of patients in this 
group is more likely to be associated with a lower response 
to therapy with traditional mood stabilizers, a worse progno-
sis, and an increased risk of suicide [9]. Current guidelines for 
the treatment of bipolar disorder do not specify the specific 
treatment of RCBD [9]. Studies show promising effects of the 
use of lamotrigine as monotherapy in bipolar disorder type II 
with rapid phase change [11,12]. Increasingly, clinicians are ob-
serving the benefits of treating RCBD using polytherapy, with 
lamotrigine and lithium in more severe cases [9,12].

Indications for the Use of Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine, being a mood stabilizer, works by preventing the 
so-called “lows” [13]; therefore, in bipolar disorder type I it 
serves to prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes. On 
the other hand, lithium protects against the occurrence of ex-
cessive “highs” [13]. Numerous high-quality studies have re-
ported fewer days of hospitalization during lamotrigine treat-
ment than with other common methods of treating bipolar 
disorder [14]. The mood-balancing effect of lamotrigine was 
not observed to lead to euthymia, and consequently caused 
mood inversion and transformed into mania [13]. However, dur-
ing the initial stages of lamotrigine treatment, the occurrence 
of symptoms of increased mood that did not yet meet the cri-
teria for mania was associated with reduced effectiveness of 
the treatment in the future [13]. The latest Cochrane review 
extends the effect of lamotrigine, proving its bidirectional ef-
fect in also preventing mania in bipolar disorder, achieving a 
33% lower probability of mania in a placebo trial, with a con-
fidence interval of 0.51-0.87 [13]. This is undoubtedly an im-
portant topic to explore in the future.

Special Indication of Lamotrigine Treatment 
of Bipolar Disorder in Women of Reproductive 
Age

The treatment of bipolar disorder in women of reproductive 
age is a challenge for clinicians due to the teratogenic prop-
erties and adverse effects, including weight gain (especially 
with antipsychotics and valproate), of drug groups used in this 
disease [7]. This is a significant medical problem because of 
the fact that up to 50% of pregnancies in women with bipo-
lar disorder are unplanned [7]. Studies confirm an increased 
risk of disease recurrence in women discontinuing treatment 
during pregnancy compared with in women continuing main-
tenance treatment [7]. The use of valproate during pregnan-
cy is associated with the highest risk of congenital anomalies 
in the fetus [7]. Statistics describe the occurrence of serious 
congenital defects in 10% of fetuses, and up to 40% of chil-
dren born have neurodevelopmental disorders [7]. For this rea-
son, the use of valproate in the group of women of reproduc-
tive age with a bipolar disorder diagnosis should be limited to 
only women using concurrent contraception with proven high 
effectiveness [7]. Despite the common nature of these facts, 
in some places in the world there is still a higher percentage 
of use of valproate than of the safer lamotrigine in this group 
of patients [7]. The use of antipsychotic drugs is inextricably 
linked to metabolic dysfunction, causing weight gain [7]. This 
adverse effect is associated with discontinuation of treatment 
in young patients due to the deterioration of well-being and 
reduced attractiveness, which is so important in this age group 
[7]. Lamotrigine, compared with other mood stabilizers, is char-
acterized by a higher safety profile in terms of teratogenici-
ty and safety during breastfeeding [7]. Additionally, there was 
no negative effect found on the metabolic profile of patients, 
and it may even reduce body weight [2,7]. Finally, an impor-
tant aspect is the predominance of depressive symptoms in 
women in this age group, compared with manic/hypomanic 
symptoms in the course of bipolar disorder, which lamotrigi-
ne can prevent to the greatest extent [7].

Adverse Effects of Lamotrigine

The most common adverse effects of lamotrigine include nau-
sea and vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbances, and minor 
rash [15]. In the context of the safe use of lamotrigine, it is 
worth mentioning its weak inhibitory effect on dihydrofolate 
reductase [1], which can disturb the metabolism of folates nec-
essary for the development of the embryo, especially in the 
first trimester. One of the most well-known and documented 
serious adverse effects of lamotrigine is the dermatological 
and mucous membrane necrosis known as Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome (SJS), manifesting as a skin rash.

SJS is a serious adverse effect, as the mortality rate is up to 
10% [15]. The risk of occurrence of SJS is highest in the first 
weeks of treatment, and available statistics estimate the prob-
ability of its occurrence of 0.3% to 0.8% in children and 0.03% 
to 0.08% in adults [1]. Studies show a greater likelihood of ex-
periencing a life-threatening rash when doses are increased 
too rapidly [3] and in cases of polytherapy with valproate [2]. 
However, most rashes occurring after the use of lamotrigine 
are mild [2]. Discontinuation of drug use, which is crucial in 
this clinical situation, does not guarantee the interruption of 
the toxic effect of the drug and the avoidance of serious com-
plications [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly moni-
tor the evolution of changes occurring on the skin and mu-
cous membranes and report this fact to a specialist [2]. The 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draws attention to the 
increased risk of serious arrhythmias when using lamotrigi-
ne [16]. Lamotrigine can have class Ib antiarrhythmic effects 
at specific therapeutic concentrations [16], which is related to 
the drug’s blocking of sodium channels [16]. This risk increas-
es with concomitant heart disease and the use of drugs that 
affect  cardiac  conduction  [17].  However,  the  latest  FDA  an-
nouncement from 2021, which was issued after the re-assess-
ment of the safety profile of lamotrigine, withdrew the recom-
mendation to avoid it in the presence of certain heart diseases 
and arrhythmias and emphasizes the significant consequenc-
es of its discontinuation [16]. The article devoted to this phe-
nomenon focuses on lamotrigine as a drug with mainly anti-
epileptic properties; hence, it is necessary to conduct further 
research on lamotrigine as a drug used in bipolar disorder in 
the context of cardiac safety [16]. It is worth mentioning that 
the use of oral contraceptives is associated with an increase 
in drug clearance and reduced effectiveness [15].

Immunological Complications of Lamotrigine 
Use

We want to increase readers’ awareness of the occurrence of 
immune  system  disorders  during  therapy  with  lamotrigine. 
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a set of symp-
toms resulting from immunological imbalance due to the ex-
cessive  stimulation  of  lymphocytes  and  macrophages  [18]. 
The occurrence of HLH is predisposed to genetic factors (HLH 
families) and sporadic factors, including viral infection, can-
cer, rheumatological diseases, and some medications [18]. Its 
final stage is multi-organ failure, resulting in a mortality rate 
of up to 75% [18]. The pathomechanism explaining the corre-
lation between lamotrigine and the dysregulation of the im-
mune system is not yet known [18]. The literature describes 
8  cases  of  HLH  occurring  after  the  use  of  lamotrigine  [18]. 
Discontinuation of lamotrigine and the use of glucocorticoids 
together with other immunosuppressive drugs in the initial 
stage of HLH allowed for clinical improvement [18]. HLH is a

rare adverse effect, but it causes great diagnostic difficulties 
and a very unfavorable prognosis [18].

Another possible immune-related adverse effect of lamotrigi-
ne is drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 
(DRESS) syndrome [19], which is a life-threatening hypersen-
sitivity syndrome in response to various drugs, including la-
motrigine [19]. The most dangerous complication is fulminant 
liver failure, the incidence of which is around 10% [19]. It is 
estimated that DRESS syndrome is experienced by as many 
as  1  in  1000  to  10 000  patients  starting  antiepileptic  drug 
therapy [19]. The main symptoms include rash, swelling, and 
characteristic inflammation of the organs, including the liver, 
heart, and kidneys [19]. The mainstay of treatment is system-
ic glucocorticosteroids and discontinuation of lamotrigine [19].

Contraindications of Lamotrigine Use

The contraindication to the use of lamotrigine is the occurrence 
of rash with accompanying systemic symptoms, including gas-
trointestinal symptoms, fever, and headache [15]. The pres-
ence of a history of SJS associated with the use of lamotrigi-
ne is not an absolute contraindication to repeated use of the 
drug [15]. Studies have presented a patient profile support-
ing the decision to restart lamotrigine treatment: a mild rash 
in the initial stage and a break of at least 4 weeks after the 
onset of the syndrome [15].

Additionally, an increased susceptibility to SJS was found in pa-
tients with the phenotype HLAB*15: 02 coming from Asia [15]. 
Therefore, the FDA issued a warning that genetic testing should 
be performed to exclude or confirm an increased risk [15].

Future Directions

It is necessary to expand research on the possibilities of lamotrig-
ine therapy during acute depressive episodes in the course of 
bipolar disorder. The effect of lamotrigine on the prevention of 
manic episodes should be further explored, especially in patients 
who tolerate lamotrigine well, to avoid the need to switch to

drugs with a lower safety profile, such as lithum, a mood sta-
bilizer with a low therapeutic index. There are no studies de-
scribing the effect of lamotrigine on patients with a diagnosis 
of bipolar II disorder. Bipolar disorder with rapid phase chang-
es is a significant therapeutic challenge. A satisfactory effect 
of simultaneous therapy with lithium and lamotrigine has been 
demonstrated to minimize the number of cycles. More high-
quality research supporting this thesis is needed. The results 
of studies on the effect of lamotrigine on the occurrence of ar-
rhythmias and the severity of existing heart defects are not 
clear; therefore, it seems justified to conduct further studies 
confirming the direction of action of lamotrigine in this topic.

Conclusions

We wanted to emphasize the key position of lamotrigine, in 
comparison with other mood-stabilizing drugs, in the treatment 
of bipolar disorder. For this purpose, the indications, contrain-
dications, and adverse effects of lamotrigine have been pre-
sented. By preventing depressive episodes that dominate the 
typical picture of bipolar disorder, lamotrigine allows the effec-
tive achievement of a longer period of disease remission. The 
high safety profile of lamotrigine is not without significance, 
which translates so significantly into the use of this drug in 
the most frequently diagnosed age group, young adults. The 
negligible effect on the developing fetus and the maintenance 
of a stable metabolic rate make lamotrigine more frequent-
ly chosen by specialists for the treatment of bipolar disorder. 
However, we must not forget that lamotrigine is not indiffer-
ent to the immune system and in extreme cases it causes SJS, 
HLH, and DRESS syndrome. Physicians must be aware of the 
possibility of such systemic hypersensitivity reactions and that 
it is most important to react rapidly with immunosuppressive 
treatment. Reactions of HLH and DRESS syndrome will perma-
nently eliminate the possibility of using lamotrigine, and SJS 
will do so in most cases.
