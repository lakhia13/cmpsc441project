What is communicative competence and how can it be
acquired?

Abstract

The commentary deals with the question of what constitutes commu-
nicative competence (or communication skills) and to what extent
findings regarding motor and social skills are transferable to the domain
of communication. After a proposal for a definition, the commentary
considers how learners acquire communicative competence and what
needs to be considered from the trainers’ perspective in order to support
learners in their competence development.
The commentary does not claim to present all definitions of the concept
of competence or communicative competence in a comprehensive way.
Nor does it aim to present the current state of research. Our aim is to
provide teachers and interested individuals in medical education with
a pragmatic guide to how communicative competence can be taught
and learned based on a skills model.

1. Introduction

Communicative competence (or communication skills) is
one of the central prerequisites for successful medical
practice, of this there is probably no serious doubt [1].
However, there is less agreement whether and, if so, how
communicative competence can be acquired [2], [3]. The
answer to this question also depends on what we mean
by communicative competence. In the literature, there is
now a large number of explanatory models from various
disciplines (e.g. medicine, psychology, sociology, linguist-
ics, university didactics, communication sciences) that
attempt to answer this question. A complete presentation
of these explanatory models would go beyond the scope
of this commentary.
We believe that it makes sense, particularly with regard
to educational
issues, to understand communicative
competence as the situation-specific use of communicat-
ive skills [4]. Thus, the scientific findings on the teaching,
acquisition and testing of skills are also valid for the field
of clinical communication.

2. What is communicative
competence?

When we deal with the question of whether and how we
should teach communicative competence, we must first
define what communicative competence actually is. Un-
fortunately, as in the discussion about the concept of

competence in general, there is no uniform definition. In
the scientific literature, no systematic or clear distinction
is made between “Communication Competence” and
“Communication Skills”. For example, the standard work
by Silverman, Kurtz and Draper is entitled “Skills for
Communicating with Patients”, although it is probably the
aim of the book to promote the acquisition of communic-
ative competence even though the term “competence”
does not appear in the book [5]. Thus, for pragmatic
reasons it seems obvious and legitimate to use the
concept of skills when we search for a definition of com-
municative competence and to ask the question of
whether and, if so, what similarities exist between motor
skills, social skills and communication skills.
According to Owen Hargie, who has developed a compre-
hensive concept of communication skills, a motor skill is
an organised, coordinated, goal-oriented activity that in-
volves a sequence of sensory, cognitive and motor
mechanisms [6]. A skill can be learned, i.e. understanding
and behaviour are built up step by step through repeated
experience. A skill is also serial, i.e. there is an order and
coordination of different processes and activities in a
sequence.
However, perhaps a communication skill is less a motor
skill than an interactional or social skill. Hargie defines
a social skill as a process in which an individual applies
a set of purposeful, interconnected, situational appropri-
ate social behaviours that are learned and controlled [6].
Social skills include verbal and non-verbal behaviour, in-
volve appropriate prompts and responses that require

timing and control of specific behaviour, and are influ-
enced by contextual factors. Therefore, the process of
couple dancing is an apt metaphor for social skills [7]:
Each dancing partner brings with him/her own motives,
e.g. to impress the other or to build a relationship.
Couples complement each other in fluid, coordinated
patterns. This requires a coordinated interlocking of the
learned repertoire of both partners. Certain “moves” are
expected or anticipated. If one cannot dance or tries a
different dance step, it becomes difficult.
So where are the differences between motor and social
skills? Social interaction is related to other people, i.e.
one's own goals and the goals of others are included, and
rules and routines are less strictly defined. As far as social
skills are concerned, emotions and personal involvement
play a greater role (self-esteem, acceptance, etc.). Percep-
tion in the process plays a greater role, as it is not only
about the perception of the skill itself, but also about
one's own reactions and the reactions of others. And
personal factors also play a greater role (age, gender,
origin etc.). A first hypothesis at this point would be that
communicative competence is more similar to social skills
than to motor skills [6].
Let us now look at the competence definition. By now a
large number of definitions of the term competence do
exist. In the didactic context of higher education, refer-
ence is often made to the Weinert’s definition, who de-
scribes competencies as ”the cognitive abilities and skills
available to individuals or learnable by them to solve
certain problems, as well as the associated motivational,
volitional and social readiness and ability to use problem-
solving in variable situations successfully and responsibly”
[8]. Competences are therefore highly specific and can
best be understood from the requirements side: We ex-
perience and evaluate a person as competent when he
or she is able to solve certain tasks or meet certain re-
quirements. Skills, on the other hand, can be understood
as specific behavioral or action dispositions that must be
organized and used in a situationally appropriate manner
when solving a non-trivial task.

3. Proposal for a definition of
communicative competence

If one now tries to bring together the ideas on social skills
according to Hargie with the concept of competence ac-
cording to Weinert, one could define communicative
competence as follows:
Communicative competence is the ability to achieve
communicative goals in a socially appropriate manner.
It is organized and goal-oriented, i.e. it includes the ability
to select and apply skills that are appropriate and effect-
ive in the respective context. It includes verbal and non-
verbal behaviour. The application of communicative
competence is serial, i.e. different processes and activit-
ies are coordinated in a typical sequence and require
appropriate timing and control of specific behaviour. It is
influenced by the behaviour of the other person and by

the context and requires the preparedness and willing-
ness to communicate with the other person for the benefit
of all. Communicative competence can be acquired, i.e.
the necessary skills are built up step by step through re-
peated, reflected practice and experience [9], [10] quoted
from [6].

4. How can learners acquire
communicative competence?

When acquiring motor or cognitive skills, the prior exper-
ience of the learner is of central importance, because the
design of the learning environment must be based on it
[11], [12]. A learner with little experience must first get
an overview and then build up a knowledge base (e.g. by
reading, discussions etc.), while application initially plays
a subordinate role. More experienced learners at an in-
termediate level benefit from worked examples and can
focus more on specific problem solving [13]. In this way,
experience-based knowledge and heuristics are built up
and misconceptions can be corrected. High-level learners
with a lot of prior experience can improve the accuracy
and speed of their skills through repeated practice (Delib-
erate Practice) and transfer them to other contexts [14].
These considerations are also plausible against the
background of findings on the use of cognitive resources
(cognitive load) [15]: Since individual cognitive resources
are basically limited, learning tasks should be designed
in such a way that they are adapted to the level of expert-
ise of the learners [16]. This can be illustrated well by the
example of simulations, which are often used to train
communication skills. In order to take the patient’s history
in a patient-centred manner, a student must know what
to ask (the content of the history), listen attentively to the
patient and control his or her conversational behaviour
(e.g. ask open questions). At the same time however, he
or she must pay attention to the patient's behaviour in
order to notice emotional cues, for example, to which he
or she can then react empathically (which in turn requires
him or her to know how to do this). It is easy to imagine
that students with little prior experience are quickly
overwhelmed in such a situation because they have to
consciously process many tasks, while experienced stu-
dents at least partially have automated routines and can
thus free up more cognitive resources, e.g. to deal with
demanding content in a medical encounter (see [17]).
Other important findings on the acquisition of skills relate
to the transfer. First of all, it has been shown time and
again that learners find it very difficult to transfer skills
they have acquired in one context to another content
domain. In order to better understand what this transfer
is about, a distinction can be made between forward
transfer (anticipating clinical practice while learning) and
backward transfer (remembering learning when working
clinically). In the case of backward transfer, it must be
recognised that the current situation has similarities with
the situation that has already been successfully mastered
in the past [18]. Therefore, it is important to promote

forward transfer in studies by considering as many and
different application contexts as possible already during
learning, so that later backward recognition is easier. In
principle, a close transfer that involves similar content
(e.g., reacting empathetically to emotional reactions of
children and adults) is easier to achieve than a distant
transfer that involves different content areas: information-
giving in medical conversations for instance, may have
different requirements needing different skills in different
contexts (e.g., conversations regarding curative vs. palli-
ative treatment).
With regard to the above-mentioned matching of learning
environment and level of expertise, a further distinction
is useful: We speak of inward transfer when learning is
facilitated by what has already been learned. This is the
case, for example, when basic anatomical or biochemical
knowledge can be used to learn basic clinical concepts
(“Preparation for future Learning”) [19]. On the other
hand, an outwardly directed transfer occurs when learning
directly results in better problem-solving in clinical prac-
tice [20]. This distinction is important because, especially
with little prior knowledge or experience, an outward
transfer cannot be expected directly, but only indirectly
when the corresponding knowledge structures closer to
the problem have been established. Therefore, learning
contents should not be judged hastily only by their useful-
ness for outward transfer.
By now, there is also some evidence on how transfer-
promoting learning should look like [21]. First of all, a
skill that is better mastered can be transferred more
easily. For example, a student who has no difficulty
whatsoever in responding empathically to emotional cues
from his patients when taking a history will also be able
to do so relatively quickly in medical conversations fo-
cused on information-giving even if the content or other
requirements are very demanding. Of course, this presup-
poses that sufficient learning time was available to learn
the respective skill accordingly, which is often not the
case in the practice of medical studies. The context-bound
nature of skills can be counteracted by using contrasting
examples from different content areas from the outset
to illustrate deeper principles.

5. Conclusion

With the certainly incomplete considerations outlined
here, we want to make clear that the understanding of
communicative competence can benefit from understand-
ing it as the situation-specific use of specific skills. We
might then transfer what we already know about the ac-
quisition of motor and other skills to the domain of com-
munication, and this knowledge can help us to systemat-
ically train communicative competence. Of course, we
need more scientific evidence for this claim, for example
to check whether the transfer of knowledge postulated
here, e.g. from the domain of clinical reasoning or motor
skills, is actually permissible. We also need more applied
research on various teaching formats, for example with

regard to the longitudinal development and acquisition
of communication skills in both initial and continuing
education and training. In the age of experiential learning,
perhaps the question of what knowledge base is condu-
cive or even necessary for the acquisition of communic-
ative competencies has also been neglected. Even if this
is only a personal statement, it is worth considering
whether the learning environments that we are currently
creating provide optimal support for learners to develop
communicative competence in a sustainable way.

Zusammenfassung

Der Kommentar setzt sich mit der Frage auseinander, was kommunika-
tive Kompetenz konstituiert und inwieweit Erkenntnisse bezüglich mo-
torischer und sozialer Fertigkeiten auf die Domäne Kommunikation
übertragbar sind. Nach einem Vorschlag für eine Definition erfolgen
Überlegungen, wie Lernende kommunikative Kompetenz erwerben und
was dabei aus Sicht der Dozierenden zu beachten ist, um Lernende bei
ihrem Kompetenzaufbau zu unterstützen.
Der Kommentar erhebt nicht den Anspruch, sämtliche Definitionen des
Kompetenzbegriffs oder kommunikativer Kompetenzen umfassend
darzustellen. Es geht auch nicht um die Darstellung des aktuellen For-
schungstands. Unser Ziel ist eine pragmatische Handreichung für Leh-
rende und Anwender*innen in der medizinischen Ausbildung, wie –
basierend auf einem Fertigkeiten-Modell – kommunikative Kompetenz
vermittelt und gelernt werden können.

1. Einleitung

Kommunikative Kompetenz ist eine der zentralen Voraus-
setzungen für erfolgreiches ärztliches Handeln, daran
besteht vermutlich kein ernsthafter Zweifel [1]. Weniger
Einigkeit besteht dagegen im Hinblick auf die Frage ob
und wenn ja, wie man kommunikative Kompetenz erwer-
ben kann [2], [3]. Die Antwort auf diese Frage hängt auch
davon ab, was man unter kommunikativer Kompetenz
versteht. In der Literatur finden sich mittlerweile eine
Vielzahl von Erklärungsmodellen unterschiedlicher Diszi-
plinen (z.B. Medizin, Psychologie, Soziologie, Linguistik,
Hochschuldidaktik, Kommunikationswissenschaften), die
sich bemühen, diese Frage zu beantworten. Eine vollstän-
dige Darstellung dieser Erklärungsmodelle würde den
Rahmen dieses Kommentars sprengen.
Wir meinen, dass es gerade im Hinblick auf Ausbildungs-
fragen sinnvoll ist, kommunikative Kompetenz als den
situationsgerechten Gebrauch kommunikativer Fertigkei-
ten (Skills) zu verstehen [4]. Damit haben die wissen-
schaftlichen Erkenntnisse zu Vermittlung, Erwerb und
Prüfen von Fertigkeiten auch für den kommunikativen
Bereich Gültigkeit.

2. Was ist kommunikative
Kompetenz?

Wenn wir uns mit der Frage beschäftigen, ob und wie wir
kommunikative Kompetenz unterrichten sollen, muss
zunächst definiert werden, was kommunikative Kompe-
tenz eigentlich ist. Leider gilt hier, wie in der Diskussion
um den Kompetenzbegriff allgemein, dass es keine ein-
heitliche Definition gibt. In der wissenschaftlichen Litera-
tur wird weder systematisch noch trennscharf zwischen
„Communication Competence“ und „Communication
Skills“ unterschieden: So trägt das Standardwerk von
Silverman, Kurtz und Draper zum Beispiel den Titel „Skills
for Communicating with Patients“, obwohl es wahrschein-
lich das Ziel des Buches ist, den Erwerb kommunikativer
Kompetenz zu fördern und der Begriff „Competence“ im
Buch gar nicht vorkommt [5]. Insofern erscheint es auch
aus pragmatischen Gründen naheliegend und legitim,
auf der Suche nach einer Definition für kommunikative
Kompetenz auf das Konzept der Fertigkeiten (Skills) zu-
rückzugreifen und die Frage zu stellen, ob und wenn ja,
welche Gemeinsamkeiten es etwa zwischen motorischen
bzw. sozialen und kommunikativen Fertigkeiten gibt.
Owen Hargie zufolge, der ein umfassendes Konzept von
kommunikativen Fertigkeiten erarbeitet hat, ist eine mo-
torische Fertigkeit eine organisierte, koordinierte, zielge-
richtete Aktivität, die eine Abfolge von sensorischen, ko-
gnitiven und motorischen Mechanismen umfasst [6]. Eine

Fertigkeit kann gelernt werden, d.h. Verstehen und Ver-
halten werden Stück für Stück durch wiederholte Erfah-
rung aufgebaut. Eine Fertigkeit ist des Weiteren seriell,
d.h. es gibt eine Reihenfolge und Koordination verschie-
dener Prozesse und Aktivitäten in einer Sequenz.
Vielleicht ist eine kommunikative Fertigkeit jedoch weni-
ger eine motorische Fertigkeit, als eine interaktionale
bzw. soziale Fertigkeit. Hargie definiert eine soziale Fer-
tigkeit als einen Prozess, in dem ein Individuum eine
Reihe von zielgerichteten, miteinander verbundenen, si-
tuativ angemessenen sozialen Verhaltensweisen anwen-
det, die gelernt und kontrolliert werden [6]. Soziale Fertig-
keiten umfassen verbale und nonverbale Verhaltenswei-
sen, beinhalten angemessene Aufforderungen und Ant-
worten, die Timing und Kontrolle spezifischer Verhaltens-
weisen erfordern und werden von Kontextfaktoren beein-
flusst. Daher ist der Prozess des Paartanzens eine tref-
fende Metapher für soziale Fertigkeiten [7]: Jede*r
Tanzpartner*in bringt eigene Motive mit, z.B. den anderen
beeindrucken oder eine Beziehung aufzubauen zu wollen.
Paare ergänzen sich in flüssigen, aufeinander abgestimm-
ten Mustern. Dies erfordert ein koordiniertes Ineinander-
greifen des gelernten Repertoires beider Partner*innen,
bestimmte „Züge“ werden erwartet bzw. antizipiert. Wenn
einer nicht tanzen kann oder einen anderen Tanzschritt
ausprobiert, wird es schwierig.
Wo sind nun die Unterschiede zwischen motorischen und
sozialen Fertigkeiten? Soziale Interaktion ist auf andere
Menschen bezogen, d.h. eigene Ziele und Ziele anderer
fließen ein, und Regeln und Routinen sind weniger strikt
festgesetzt. Bei den sozialen Fertigkeiten spielen Emotio-
nen und das Einbringen der eigenen Person eine größere
Rolle (Selbstwert, Angenommensein etc.). Die Wahrneh-
mung im Prozess spielt eine größere Rolle, da es nicht
nur um die Wahrnehmung der Fertigkeit selbst, sondern
auch um eigene Reaktionen und die Reaktionen anderer
geht. Und auch persönliche Faktoren spielen eine größere
Rolle (Alter, Geschlecht, Herkunft etc.). Eine erste Hypo-
these wäre an dieser Stelle, dass kommunikative Kompe-
tenz eher den sozialen als den motorischen Fertigkeiten
zuzuordnen ist [6].
Kommen wir nun zum Kompetenzbergriff. Mittlerweile
gibt es eine Vielzahl an Definitionen des Begriffs Kompe-
tenz. Im hochschuldidaktischen Kontext wird häufig auf
die Definition von Weinert Bezug genommen, der Kompe-
tenzen bezeichnet als „die bei Individuen verfügbaren
oder durch sie erlernbaren kognitiven Fähigkeiten und
Fertigkeiten, um bestimmte Probleme zu lösen, sowie die
damit verbundenen motivationalen, volitionalen und so-
zialen Bereitschaften und Fähigkeiten, um die Problem-
lösungen in variablen Situationen erfolgreich und verant-
wortungsvoll nutzen zu können“ [8]. Kompetenzen sind
also in hohem Maße spezifisch und können am ehesten
von der Anforderungsseite her verstanden werden: Wir
erleben und bewerten eine Person dann als kompetent,
wenn sie in der Lage ist, bestimmte Aufgaben zu lösen
bzw. bestimmte Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Fertigkeiten
dagegen können als spezifische Verhaltens- oder Hand-
lungsdispositionen verstanden werden, die bei der Lösung

einer nicht trivialen Aufgabe organisiert und situationsge-
recht eingesetzt werden müssen.

3. Vorschlag für eine Definition
kommunikativer Kompetenz

Versucht man nun die Ideen zu den sozialen Fertigkeiten
nach Hargie mit dem Kompetenzbegriff nach Weinert
zusammenzubringen, könnte man kommunikative Kom-
petenz
folgendermaßen definieren: Kommunikative
Kompetenz ist die Fähigkeit, kommunikative Ziele in so-
zial angemessener Form umzusetzen. Sie ist organisiert
und zielgerichtet, d.h. sie beinhaltet die Fähigkeit, dem
Kontext angemessene und wirksame Fertigkeiten auszu-
wählen und anzuwenden. Sie umfasst verbale und non-
verbale Verhaltensweisen. Die Anwendung kommunikati-
ver Kompetenz ist seriell, d.h. verschiedene Prozesse und
Aktivitäten werden in typischer Abfolge koordiniert und
erfordert angemessenes Timing und die Kontrolle spezi-
fischer Verhaltensweisen. Sie wird durch das Verhalten
des Gegenübers und durch den Kontext beeinflusst und
erfordert die Bereitschaft und den Willen, mit seinem
Gegenüber zum Wohle aller zu kommunizieren. Kommu-
nikative Kompetenz kann erworben werden, d.h. die dazu
notwendigen Fertigkeiten werden Stück für Stück durch
wiederholte, reflektierte Übung und Erfahrung aufgebaut
[9], [10] zitiert nach [6].

4. Wie kann man kommunikative
Kompetenz erwerben?

Beim Erwerb motorischer bzw. kognitiver Fertigkeiten
sind die Vorerfahrung der Lernenden von zentraler Bedeu-
tung, weil sich die Gestaltung der Lernumgebung daran
orientieren muss [11], [12]. Ein Lernender mit wenig Er-
fahrung muss sich zunächst einen Überblick verschaffen
und dann eine Wissensbasis aufbauen (z.B. durch Lesen,
Diskussionen etc.), während die Anwendung zunächst
eine untergeordnete Rolle spielt. Erfahrenere Lernende
auf mittlerem Niveau dagegen profitieren z.B. von ausge-
arbeiteten Beispielen (Worked Examples) und können
den Fokus stärker auf die konkrete Problemlösung legen
[13]. Damit erfolgt der Aufbau von erfahrungsbasiertem
Wissen und Heuristiken, Fehlannahmen können korrigiert
werden. Lernende auf hohem Niveau mit viel Vorerfahrung
dagegen, können durch wiederholtes Üben (Deliberate
Practice) die Genauigkeit und Schnelligkeit ihrer Fertig-
keiten sowie den Transfer in andere Kontexte verbessern
[14]. Diese Überlegungen sind auch vor dem Hintergrund
der Erkenntnisse zur Inanspruchnahme kognitiver Res-
sourcen (Cognitive Load) plausibel [15]: Da die individu-
ellen kognitiven Ressourcen grundsätzlich begrenzt sind,
sollten Lernaufgaben so gestaltet werden, dass sie dem
Expertiseniveau der Lernenden angepasst sind [16]. Das

keiten eingesetzt werden: Um ein Anamnesegespräch
patientenzentriert durchzuführen, muss eine Studierende
z.B. nicht nur die Inhalte der Anamnese präsent haben,
dem Patienten aufmerksam zuhören und ihr Gesprächs-
verhalten steuern (z.B. offene Fragen stellen), sondern
gleichzeitig noch auf das Verhalten des Patienten achten,
um etwa emotionale Reaktionen zu bemerken, auf die
sie dann empathisch reagieren kann (wozu sie wiederum
wissen muss, wie man das macht). Man kann sich leicht
vorstellen, dass Studierende mit wenig Vorerfahrung in
einer solchen Situation schnell überfordert sind, weil sie
viele Aufgaben bewusst verarbeiten müssen, während
erfahrene Studierende zumindest teilweise bereits über
automatisierte Routinen verfügen und damit mehr kogni-
tive Ressourcen freimachen können, um z.B. auf an-
spruchsvolle Inhalte in einem Aufklärungsgespräch ein-
zugehen (vgl. [17]).
Weitere wichtige Erkenntnisse zum Erwerb von Fertigkei-
ten betreffen den Transfer. Zunächst hat sich immer
wieder gezeigt, dass es Lernenden sehr schwer fällt,
Fertigkeiten, die sie in einem bestimmten Zusammenhang
oder Kontext erworben haben, auf einen anderen Inhalts-
bereich zu übertragen. Um besser zu verstehen, worum
es bei diesem Transfer geht, kann man zum einen zwi-
schen vorwärts gerichtetem (im Studium die Praxis anti-
zipieren) und rückwärts gerichtetem Transfer (sich in der
Praxis an das Studium erinnern) unterscheiden. Beim
rückwärtsgerichteten Transfer muss erkannt werden,
dass die aktuelle Situation Ähnlichkeiten aufweist mit
der Situation, die im Studium bereits erfolgreich bewältigt
wurde [18]. Daher ist es wichtig, im Studium den vorwärts
gerichteten Transfer zu fördern, indem möglichst viele
und verschiedene Anwendungskontexte bereits beim
Lernen berücksichtigt werden, so dass das spätere
rückwärtsgerichtete Erkennen leichter fällt. Grundsätzlich
gilt dabei, dass ein naher Transfer, der ähnliche Inhalte
betrifft (z.B. empathisch auf emotionale Reaktionen von
Kindern und Erwachsenen zu reagieren) leichter gelingt,
als ein ferner Transfer, bei dem es um verschiedene In-
haltsbereiche geht: So stellen sich etwa bei Aufklärungs-
und Informationsgesprächen je nach Inhalt andere Anfor-
derungen, die möglicherweise andere Fertigkeiten erfor-
dern (z.B. Aufklärungsgespräch bei einer kurativen vs.
palliativen Behandlung).
Im Hinblick auf die oben bereits angeführte Abstimmung
von Lernumgebung und Expertiseniveau ist eine weitere
Unterscheidung sinnvoll: Von einem einwärts gerichteten
Transfer spricht man dann, wenn Lernen durch bereits
Gelerntes erleichtert wird. Das ist z.B. dann der Fall, wenn
anatomische oder biochemische Grundlagenkenntnisse
benutzt werden können, um grundlegende klinische
Konzepte zu erlernen („Preparation for future Learning“)
[19]. Von einem auswärts gerichteten Transfer dagegen
spricht man dann, wenn das Lernen direkt dazu führt,
dass Probleme in der Praxis besser gelöst werden können
[20]. Diese Unterscheidung ist deshalb wichtig, weil ins-
besondere bei wenig Vorwissen oder Vorerfahrung nicht
unmittelbar mit einem auswärts gerichteten Transfer
gerechnet werden kann, sondern erst mittelbar, wenn

die entsprechenden problemnäheren Wissensstrukturen
aufgebaut sind. Daher sollte man Lerninhalte nicht vor-
schnell nur nach ihrer Zweckmäßigkeit für den Auswärts-
transfer beurteilen.
Mittlerweile gibt es auch einige Erkenntnisse dazu, wie
transferförderliches Lernen aussehen sollte [21]. Zu-
nächst gilt, dass eine Fertigkeit, die besser beherrscht
wird, auch leichter transferiert werden kann. Ein Studie-
render, der z.B. keinerlei Mühe hat, in Anamnesegesprä-
chen auf emotionale Signale seiner Patienten empathisch
zu reagieren, wird das relativ schnell auch in Informati-
onsgesprächen umsetzen können, selbst wenn er dort
inhaltlich bzw. aufgrund der anderen Anforderungen stark
gefordert ist. Das setzt natürlich voraus, dass ausreichend
Lernzeit zur Verfügung stand, um die jeweilige Fertigkeit
dementsprechend gut zu lernen, was in der Praxis des
Medizinstudiums häufig nicht der Fall ist. Der Kontextge-
bundenheit von Fertigkeiten kann entgegengewirkt wer-
den, in dem von Beginn an kontrastierende Beispiele aus
verschiedenen Inhaltsbereichen herangezogen werden,
um tieferliegende Prinzipien zu verdeutlichen.

5. Fazit

Mit den hier skizzierten, sicherlich unvollständigen
Überlegungen wollen wir verdeutlichen, dass das Verständ-
nis von kommunikativer Kompetenz davon profitieren
kann, wenn man sie als den situationsgerechten Ge-
brauch spezifischer Fertigkeiten versteht. Dann nämlich,
lässt sich das, was wir bereits über den Erwerb von mo-
torischen und anderen Fertigkeiten wissen auch in die
Domäne der Kommunikation übertragen, und dieses
Wissen kann uns helfen, kommunikative Kompetenz
systematisch zu vermitteln. Natürlich brauchen wir dazu
noch mehr wissenschaftliche Evidenz, um etwa zu über-
prüfen, ob der hier postulierte Transfer von Erkenntnissen
z.B. aus dem Bereich des Clinical Reasoning oder der
motorischen Fertigkeiten tatsächlich zulässig ist. Außer-
dem brauchen wir mehr anwendungsbezogene Forschung
zu verschiedenen Unterrichtsformaten, z.B. im Hinblick
auf den longitudinalen Aufbau und Erwerb kommunikati-
ver Kompetenzen sowohl in der Aus- als auch in der Fort-
und Weiterbildung. Im Zeitalter des erfahrungsbasierten
Lernens kam vielleicht auch die Frage zu kurz, welche
Wissensbasis für den Erwerb kommunikativer Kompeten-
zen förderlich oder sogar erforderlich ist. Auch wenn dies
nur ein persönliches Statement ist, lohnt es sich darüber
nachzudenken, ob die Lernumgebungen, die wir aktuell
schaffen, die Lernenden optimal darin unterstützen,
kommunikative Kompetenz nachhaltig aufzubauen.
