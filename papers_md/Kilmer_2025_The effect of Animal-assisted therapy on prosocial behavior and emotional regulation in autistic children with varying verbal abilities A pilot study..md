The use of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has increased in the pediatric autism pop-

ulation. However, studies detailing differences in human-animal interaction between 

autistic children and animals along with the longevity of reported outcomes associ-

ated with AAT need further exploration. The purpose of this pilot study was to evalu-

ate these factors.

Methods

A quantitative research design with convenience sampling was used to categorize 

pediatric participants into two groups (nonverbal or verbal) based on their verbality. 

Two human-animal ethogram and two questionnaires were utilized to assess behav-

ior during and apart from AAT sessions. A total of 2,281 interactions and behaviors 

occurring during AAT sessions were examined.

Results

Both groups interacted well with the canine. The verbal group interacted mostly with 

commands while the nonverbal group showed more affectionate behaviors.

Conclusion

Mental health practitioners can use canines to enhance therapeutic outcomes in 

autistic children regardless of the child’s verbality.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition occurring in 
all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. It is associated with deficits in social 
interaction and repetitive interests/behaviors [1], increased morbidity and mortality 
[2], and deficits in speech-language, fine, and gross motor development [3]. Many 
autistic children display immature emotional regulation, defined as the ability to mon-
itor, evaluate, and change one’s emotional state to achieve a goal [1,4,5]. However, 
autistic children with greater receptive language abilities may demonstrate a more 
mature emotional regulation response [4], indicating a correlation between language 
ability and emotional regulation. Nonetheless, autistic children with average or above 
average cognitive and verbal abilities may also demonstrate deficits in functional and 
social communication [6]. Additionally, children with ASD may exhibit higher levels 
of involuntary emotional dysregulation behaviors, such as rumination and intrusive 
thoughts [7]. These behaviors underscore the importance of personalized interven-
tions and support strategies that can enhance social and emotional skills in autistic 
children while considering their unique verbal abilities and needs.

As the prevalence of ASD continues to increase [8], early intervention to address 
developmental delays, social deficits, and emotional regulation is recommended [2]. 
An increase in animal-assisted therapy (AAT) to address these skills is noted in the 
pediatric ASD population [9]. Animal-assisted therapy supports established therapy 
goals through direct and purposeful interaction with animals [10]. The formal utiliza-
tion of animals in healthcare specifically within therapy dates to the mid-to-late 20th 
century when Boris M. Levinson used canines to comfort children during therapy 
sessions [11–13]. Furthermore, Lev Vygotsky’s developmental theory supports inter-
action with an outside source, such as peers and adults, to develop self-regulation 
in children [14]. However, canines can be used as the outside source with which the 
child can learn emotional regulation [15]. Pediatric therapists have used AAT to pro-
mote verbal and nonverbal communication [14], increase prosocial behaviors [16,17], 
and promote emotional regulation in children with ASD both during and apart from 
sessions [17,18]. Positive verbal and nonverbal social behaviors and reduced isolat-
ing and aggressive behaviors have been noted during AAT sessions in children with 
ASD [19]. Moreover, AAT resulted in a statistical improvement in both communication 
and social interaction skills in a small sample of preschool-aged children diagnosed 
with ASD [20].

Canines show notable potential in providing unique treatment modality for autistic 

children with limited verbal abilities. The presence of a canine in therapy sessions 
specifically increased both the frequency and duration of positive social behaviors 
[16]. It also led to enhanced emotional regulation and attention, resulting in a calm-
ing effect during the session [18]. One possible explanation for these results is that 
children with ASD may perceive greater social reward from animal faces compared to 
human faces, which could indicate enhanced emotional arousal and regulation during 
AAT sessions [21]. Canines can be used to engage children in simple social activities 
that do not require verbal communication, such as playing fetch or walking the canine

on a leash [16]. Furthermore, autistic children with speech delay may understand canine nonverbal communication more 
than human verbal communication, which involves complex verbal and social cues that can be difficult to decode [22–24].
Canines trained in ASD tasks are the third most requested service animal in the United States due to their success in 
promoting socialization and emotional regulation. However, many families cannot afford to purchase or home a service 
canine [13]. Few, if any, studies have examined if a canine trained to serve multiple children could be as effective as a 
service canine trained for one child. Moreover, despite the increasing popularity of AAT in the therapeutic plan for autistic 
children, the usage of animals, specifically canines, with patients of varying verbal abilities has yet to be formally ana-
lyzed. For these reasons, this present study aims to investigate interactions within AAT sessions between a trained canine 
and children with ASD of varying verbal abilities to lay a foundational understanding of human-canine bonding. Further-
more, this study will examine if behavioral changes occur apart from AAT sessions, as seen in children with ASD who 
have service canines, to note if AAT could produce similar effects for families who cannot afford a service canine. This 
new information can guide mental health practitioners seeking to include canines in their clinical practice.

Materials and methods

Aim

This mixed-methods study aims to investigate interactions within AAT sessions between a trained canine and children 
with ASD of varying verbal abilities to lay a foundational understanding of best practice for AAT use. Evaluating proso-
cial behavior and emotional regulation occurring during AAT sessions between autistic children with varying verbality 
can ascertain if autistic children respond differently to animals based on their verbal abilities. Furthermore, investigating 
changes in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from AAT sessions provides new insight into the longevity of 
outcomes associated with AAT. This new information can guide mental health practitioners seeking to include canines in 
their clinical practice to enhance therapy sessions and meet therapeutic outcomes. The following research questions were 
established to attain these study objectives:

1. Do interactions between a trained therapy canine and autistic children differ depending on the child’s verbal abilities?

2. Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation in animal-assisted therapy sessions among children 

with varying verbal abilities?

3. Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from animal-assisted therapy sessions among 

children with varying verbal abilities?

Ethics

This study was approved by the internal review board at the university using protocol number 2201382953 and the insti-
tutional animal care and use committee prior to implementation. The clinical trial registration number is NCT06687850. 
Written informed consent was obtained at the start of the first session on all caregivers and pediatric participants ages 8 
years and older who were cognitively able to give consent.

Design

This present study used standardized instruments to investigate human-animal intervention (HAI) occurring during 
AAT sessions and prosocial behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated by participants outside of AAT ses-
sions. SPSS and Microsoft Excel were used to run the analysis. A total of 144 sessions were conducted, 84 of 
which were recorded and coded to analyze HAI during sessions. Independent t-tests were used to analyze the dif-
ferences in human-animal interaction among children with ASD with varying verbal abilities from the recorded ses-
sions. The homogeneity of the variance (HOV) assumption between two groups was checked using Levene’s test 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326085  July 1, 2025

for equality of variances in SPSS program before conducting the t-tests analysis. Results of t-tests with adjusted 
degrees of freedom value were reported if the HOV was violated. The null hypothesis was set to reflect no signif-
icant difference in HAI between verbal and nonverbal groups for the independent t-tests; therefore, a significant 
difference in the human-animal interaction behaviors regarding the children’s verbal abilities could be confirmed 
if the t-test results reject the null hypothesis. Cohen’s d was used to report the effect sizes of the independent 
t-tests since Cohen’s d is one of the most commonly reported effect sizes in group comparison analysis. Values up 
to 0.20 were interpreted as small, 0.50 as medium, and 0.80 as large effect sizes [25]. Due to the smaller sample 
size, descriptive statistics were utilized to compare prosocial behavior and emotional regulation occurring apart 
from AAT sessions between the two groups based on the self-report questionnaires completed by caregivers. This 
study was not registered as a clinical trial before enrollment; however, the authors confirm that ongoing trials for 
animal-assisted therapy will be registered.

Sample

Convenience sampling was used to recruit pediatric participants, ages 2 to 21 years, identified at risk for ASD by com-
munity healthcare providers and referred to an ASD program supported by the university for a diagnostic evaluation. The 
university has a clinic on campus where the AAT sessions were held. Eligible participants included children referred to  
the program for an ASD diagnostic evaluation and were not allergic to or afraid of canines. Caregivers were informed of the 
AAT study during the telehealth follow-up evaluation which occurred after the diagnostic appointment. See Fig 1 for the  
CONSORT Flow Diagram.

A total of 13 children, 12 males and one female, enrolled in the AAT study from June 2022 to August 2023.  

Seventy-seven percent (n = 10) were diagnosed with ASD, 15% (n = 2) were diagnosed with developmental delay and 
mixed receptive/expressive language disorder, and 8% (n = 1) were diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperac-
tivity disorder with expressive language disorder prior to enrollment. Seventy-seven percent (n = 10) of participants 
were non-Hispanic white (NHW), 15% (n = 2) were Hispanic (H), and 8% (n = 1) was biracial (B). Ages ranged from 
3 years to 10 years with a mean of 6 years. Participants were categorized into two verbal ability groups, verbal and 
nonverbal, based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale- 2nd edition definitions for preverbal, phrase speech, 
and fluent speech [22]. Participants in the verbal group could speak at a four-year-old level in functional expressive 
language or higher, while the nonverbal group were either nonverbal (no words), preverbal (single words up to incon-
sistent use of simple phrases), or used phrase speech (regular production of non-echoed phrases made up of three 
independent units). Seventy percent (n = 9) were categorized in the verbal group, which included eight NHW and one 
B participants with ages ranging from 4 to 10 years. Of these, 78% (n = 7) were enrolled in speech language therapy, 
78% (n = 7) were enrolled in occupational therapy, 56% (n = 5) were enrolled in physical therapy, 11% (n = 1) were 
receiving psychological therapy, 11% (n = 1) were receiving counseling, and 11% (n = 1) attended a developmental 
preschool. Twenty-two percent (n = 2) had received prior speech therapy, 22% (n = 2) had received prior occupational 
therapy, 11% (n = 1) had received prior physical therapy, 33% (n = 3) had received prior psychological therapy, 11% 
(n = 1) had received prior counseling, and 0% (n = 0) had priorly been enrolled in a developmental preschool. Thirty 
percent (n = 4) were categorized in the nonverbal group, comprised of two NHW and 2 H participants with ages 
ranging from 3 to 5 years. Of these, 75% (n = 3) were enrolled in speech language therapy, 50% (n = 2) were enrolled 
in occupational therapy, 25% (n = 1) were enrolled in physical therapy, and 25% (n = 1) attended a developmental 
preschool. None of the participants in the nonverbal group were receiving psychological therapy or counseling. The 
mean ASD severity per the Autism Diagnostic Scale, 2nd edition (ADOS-2), comparison score in the nonverbal group 
was 7.66 (SD = 0.88, range) and the median was 8. The mean ASD severity ADOS-2 comparison score in the verbal 
group was 6.78 (SD = 1.01, range) with the median of 7. See Table 1 for summary statistics of demographic data and 
Fig 2 for participants’ prior therapy histories.

Intervention

Demographic data; past, family, and social histories; and prior therapy evaluations were collected during the initial 
consultation for enrollment into the ASD program. Caregivers were given the option to enroll the child in the AAT study 
at the follow-up appointment after the diagnostic assessment was completed, or upon enrollment in the ASD program 
if the child had an ASD diagnosis. Three children who did not meet ASD diagnostic criteria were enrolled as they

had been diagnosed with developmental delays, speech disorders, and behavioral concerns. Each AAT study lasted 
between eight to 12 weeks, and caregivers had the option to re-enroll the child for the next study to continue address-
ing behavioral concerns. Animal-assisted therapy sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the age and ability 
of the participant. Sessions started with five to 10 minutes of free play with the canine, followed by sensory integration 
therapy based on the child’s identified sensory profile. Participants then entered the clinic room for 20 to 30 minutes of 
a seated activity in which the therapist, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner (CPNP), taught coping and socialization 
strategies to participants and caregivers. Sessions concluded with five minutes of play with the canine. Play activities 
include fetch, soccer, hide and seek, and puzzles. The canine was trained to lay under the table in the clinic room 
while the therapist was working with the participants. He would provide grounding, light pressure, and deep pressure 
therapy if the participant became anxious during the sessions. The seated work was recorded using two cameras to 
ensure visibility of the interactions between the participant and therapist, canine, and caregiver; participant vocaliza-
tions and verbalizations; and participant facial expressions. Importantly, the play time was not recorded; therefore, the 
data only represents interactions and behavior occurring during the seated work in the clinic room.

The canine is a male black Labrador Retriever who was between one to two years old during this study. His handler is 

his owner and the CPNP who oversees the A4A program at the university and is the therapist during AAT sessions. He 
is certified as both a therapy and service dog and completed almost 200 therapy sessions during the study period. He 
learned 60 different commands to facilitate interaction with pediatric participants and could detect the onset of anxiety 
and emotional dysregulation. The canine provided deep pressure therapy and comfort measures when participants were 
anxious, assisted in grounding the participant during sessions, and provided an outlet for tactile stimulation by allowing 
participants to pet and brush his fur. In addition, the canine had learned 10 American sign language signs to promote 
interaction with nonverbal participants.

Instruments

The Observation for Human Animal Interaction for Research (OHAIRE) Coding System from University of Arizona 
was used to note human bonding and prosocial behavior occurring during AAT sessions. Inter-rater (kappa = 0.81) 
and intra-rater (kappa = 0.87) reliability were obtained, and internal structure analysis demonstrated consistency 
with the OHAIRE tool and other social skill assessments [26]. Observable behavior categories captured by the 
OHAIRE Coding System include interactive behaviors (social communication and environmental interaction), 
emotional displays (facial and verbal), and interfering behaviors (aggression, overactivity, and isolation) [27]. Each 
member of the research team passed a certification exam to use the OHAIRE ethogram and interrater reliability 
was 0.773 and 0.775, comparable with moderate consistency between raters and close to strong consistency score 
of 0.817.

The second instrument used was the 3-AAT Observation ethogram, adapted with permission from Johns Hopkins 

University, which was used to code both canine and human interaction during AAT sessions. The revised ethogram 
appraises the frequency of six domains of human interaction (affection, play, care, communication, comfort, withdrawal) 
and 24 subdomains of human behavior that can occur in an AAT session as seen in Table 2. The ethogram assesses the 
frequency, intensity, and duration of the interactions between the canine and child. Frequency is measured by a tally count 
and duration is assessed by rounding either up or down to the nearest 30 second mark. Each interaction has a code for 
intensity from 0 (not intense) to 3 (the most intense), and the mode of the interaction was entered to run the analysis.

This table outlines the conceptual definitions for each domain and subdomain included in the 3-AAT (Animal-Assisted 

Therapy) Observation ethogram used to code human and animal interaction occurring during animal-assisted therapy 
sessions. Definitions are provided to clarify the behavioral and interactional constructs assessed during observation, sup-
porting consistency in coding and interpretation.

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item tool developed to assess five domains: Emotional 
Problems, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, and Prosocial. The SDQ is the most used instrument in mea-
suring therapeutic effect of interventions within the emotional state in children and adolescents ages 2–18 years, demon-
strating reliable internal consistency and validity [28]. The SDQ has two versions, one to be administered at the initiation 
of therapy and then a follow-up version that includes two additional questions examining the impact of the therapeutic 
intervention. Scores from four behavioral domains range from zero (“normal”) to 10 (“very high concerns”), while Prosocial 
domain scores are reversed so that 10 indicates “normal” behavior and zero signifies “very high concerns”. The SDQ also 
assesses the total, impact, internalizing, and externalizing scores to provide a complete overview of the child’s behavior 
during the past four weeks. Total scores are the sum of the behavior domains except the Prosocial domains and range 
from zero (normal) to 40 (very high). Impact scores range from zero (normal) to 10 (very high) and reflect overall distress 
and impairment interfering with daily social interactions. Internalizing scores reflect the Emotional Problems and Peer 
Problems domains, while Externalizing scores are the sum of the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity domains. Both the 
Internalizing and Externalizing domain scores range from zero (normal) to 20 (very high). The initial SDQ was adminis-
tered at the beginning of the study and the follow-up assessment was used subsequently every four weeks until the study 
concluded.

Lastly, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was administered weekly to measure therapeutic effects 
occurring in everyday life outside of the AAT session. The PANAS is a 20-item questionnaire utilizing a 5-point Likert scale 
to assess positive and negative affect occurring the week prior to administration. Each domain has 10 items with scores 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326085  July 1, 2025

9 / 21

ranging from 10 to 50, with lower scores reflecting lower levels of positive or negative affect and higher scores signifying 
higher positive or negative affect [29]. Total scores on each scale are obtained by adding the scores for each item. Analy-
sis of the PANAS demonstrates very good internal consistency reliability, with alphas ranging from 0.86 to 0.90 for Positive 
affect and from 0.84 to 0.87 for Negative affect [30,31]. The PANAS questionnaire is used for children over the age of 6 
years, therefore, six participants were excluded from the weekly analysis.

Results

RQ1. Human-Animal interaction

A total of 2,071 interactions were analyzed with the 3-AAT Observation ethogram to measure affection, play, communi-
cation, comfort, withdrawal, and care behaviors, and 210 interactions were analyzed using the OHAIRE assessment to 
measure social communication, interaction, overactivity, and interfering behaviors. Both assessments noted the same 
behaviors, strengthening the veracity of the analysis. However, as previously stated, the seated portion was the only part 
of the session able to be recorded, limiting some of noted interaction between participants and the canine.

The OHAIRE Social Communication category showed a significant difference between the groups (t(270)=−3.29, 

p = .002, d = −0.50). The verbal group (M = 3.96, SD = 2.14) demonstrated significantly more frequencies in social 
communication behaviors than the nonverbal group (M = 2.92, SD = 2.25) at α = 0.1 level. Specifically, the social com-
munications with the therapist were reported more in the verbal group (M = 3.75, SD = 2.15) than the nonverbal group 
(M = 2.03, SD = 1.92), which indicated the statistically significant differences between two groups (t(101.70)=−5.92, 
p < .001, d = −0.82). Conversely, the nonverbal group demonstrated more social communication with the caregiver 
(M = 1.86, SD = 2.19) than the verbal group (M = 1.00, SD = 1.35), which was statically significant (t(70.69)=2.90, 
p = .005, d = 0.55).

Analysis of the OHAIRE Environmental Interaction domain showed the verbal group (M = 3.56, SD = 2.38) interacted 
more with the environment, which includes the canine, more than the nonverbal group (M = 2.39, SD = 2.24). This differ-
ence is statistically significant (t(270)=−3.39, p < .001, d = −0.50). The interactions with the canine were reported more in 
the verbal group (M = 2.46, SD = 2.30) than the nonverbal group (M = 1.37, SD = 1.66), which was statistically significant 
(t(126.54)=−4.08, p < .001, d = −0.50). However, the average OHAIRE scores of interactions with objects in the room, such 
as other toys, were not statistically significantly different between the verbal and nonverbal groups.

Similar results were noted in the 3-AAT ethogram analysis. A total of 2,007 interactions were coded in the verbal group, 

compared to 64 coded interactions in the nonverbal group. The verbal group had significantly more interactions with the 
canine than the nonverbal group at α = 0.1 level, and this difference was also statistically significant (t(89.47)=5.03, p < .001 
with large effect size, d = 0.65). See Fig 2 for the frequency of canine interactions among groups. Notably, 50% of the 
interaction between the canine and the nonverbal group corresponded to the category of Affection when the child petted 
the canine while playing, compared to verbal group (10%), whose most used category of interaction was verbal Communi-
cation (53%). While 31% of the interaction among the nonverbal group corresponded to the Withdrawal category, analysis 
showed most of the withdrawal interaction occurred with one participant only who said “No!” frequently, even when he was 
not interacting with the canine, negatively skewing the results. See Fig 3 for interaction percentages among the 3-AAT 
Observation ethogram domains.

Hide and Seek, Puzzle, Walking, Name, Command, Verbal affirmation, Comfort-head, Comfort-face, Comfort-back, 
Comfort-belly, Comfort-ears, Hugs, Kiss, and Laying interactions were not observed in nonverbal group. Brush, Hides, 
and Crying interactions were not observed in either group, and Treat (N = 1) and Comfort-floor (N = 2) interactions did not 
occur frequently enough in the nonverbal group to be able to calculate a difference between the groups. Thus, the fre-
quencies of six interactions were analyzed (Laughing, Petting, Fetch, Comfort-Back, Floor, and Moves away) among the 
groups. A significant difference was noted between groups with the frequency of the Fetch interaction (t(46.95)=3.512, 
p < .001, d = 0.58), with the verbal group (M = 4.12, S.D. = 4.73) engaging in Fetch more than the nonverbal group (M = 1.50,

the 3-AAT (Animal-Assisted Therapy) Observation ethogram across different participant groups. The data highlights how each group engages with the 
canine, with percentages indicating the interaction level per domain. Differences among groups reflect potential variation in domain relevance or influ-
ence. The verbal group had more minutes of interaction (909.5 minutes) compared to the nonverbal group (31 minutes), as depicted in Fig 4, which was 
also statistically significant (t(2)=2.01, p = 0.0014, df = 46). Interestingly, the mode for intensity for both groups was 2, indicating all participants interacted 
with the same interest, concentration, and strength while interacting with the canine, even though the nonverbal group interacted with the canine less 
than the verbal group. See Fig 4 for the percentage of interaction duration between the two groups.

RQ2. Prosocial behavior and emotional regulation within session

The last two categories of the OHAIRE assessment (Emotional Displays, and Interfering Behaviors) were evaluated to answer 
RQ2. The Emotional Displays category contains two subsets (Facial Display and Verbal Display) with each having a positive and 
negative display, while the Interfering Behaviors category has three subsets (Aggression, Overactivity, and Isolation). However,

the categories of positive verbal display and aggression were excluded from the data analysis because of zero sample size. There 
was a significant difference in Overactivity between the two groups (t(66.81)=3.07, p = .003, d = 0.64). The verbal group (M = 0.21, 
S.D. = 0.74) showed less overactive behaviors than the nonverbal group (M = 0.80, S.D. = 1.42). Similarly, the verbal group 
(M = 0.91, S.D. = 1.59) showed less Isolation behaviors than the nonverbal group (M = 3.59, S.D. = 2.42), which was also statistically 
significant and had a large effect size (t(72.40)=8.06, p < .001, d = 1.49). However, the four subcategories of Emotional Display 
behaviors did not show any significant difference between verbal and nonverbal groups, as depicted in Table 4 and Fig 6.

RQ3. Prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from sessions

The monthly SDQ and weekly PANAS scores reflected the effect of AAT on behavior during daily life activities apart from 
AAT sessions. Unfortunately, caregivers of the four children in the nonverbal group and two in the verbal group did not 
complete the SDQ assessment consistently, rendering their results invalid. Likewise, the PANAS assessment is normed 
for children ages 6 years and older; therefore, it was not used to assess the weekly behavior of the four children in the 
nonverbal group. Therefore, the following aggregate data reflects the mean scores of the SDQ and PANAS for the verbal 
group only.

SDQ Total mean scores (range zero to 40) reflect overall prosocial behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated 
by participants for the preceding month. Lower scores indicate improvement in behavior. The SDQ mean scores show 
improvement in all areas by the midpoint of the study, with stabilization of behaviors noted in the last half of the study. See 
Fig 7 for SDQ Total scores.

Similarly, SDQ domain scores (range zero to 10) exhibited improvement by the midpoint of the study. See Fig 8 for 
SDQ domain scores. Since the Prosocial domain scores are inverse, an increase in scores reflects overall improvement 
in behavior while the other four domains should note a decrease in scores. Also, the Conduct Problems and Emotional 
Problems domains showed a slight increase in behaviors after the midpoint of the study.

SDQ Impact scores range from zero to 2 (not at all [0], only a little [0], a medium amount [1], a great deal [2]) to a total 

impact score of 10 and reflect the overall distress and impairment reported by caregivers for the preceding month. Dis-
tress and impairment are measured by whether they upset or distress the child, interfere with home life, friendships, class-
room learning, or leisure activities. The lower Impact scores indicate the child experienced less distress or impairment 
during the preceding month, which is noted in Fig 9.

Maladaptive behavior is depicted in the Externalizing and Internalizing domains. Scores range from zero to 20, with 
lower scores indicating less occurrence. Externalizing scores are comprised of the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity

during the week prior to AAT sessions at the beginning, middle, and end of the study. For all domains except Prosocial Behavior, lower scores indicate 
improvement. In contrast, higher scores in the Prosocial domain reflect positive behavioral change.

domains, while Internalizing scores are the sum of the Emotional Problems and Peer Problems domains. Fig 10 shows 
improvement in the Internalizing domain and a slight uptick in the Externalizing domain, most likely influenced by the 
Conduct Problems domain score.

Discussion

Results of this pilot study indicate that mental health practitioners can use trained canines to promote prosocial behav-
ior and emotional regulation and enhance therapeutic outcomes for children with ASD regardless of verbality. Both 
human-animal interaction ethograms demonstrated increased prosocial behavior and emotional regulation within the AAT 
sessions, while both the SDQ and PANAS mirrored this effect apart from the AAT sessions for the verbal group. Further-
more, the aggregate analysis showed a cumulative progression of desired behavior, supporting evidence for the long-term 
beneficial effects of AAT.

Social communication was apparent during the recorded sessions, with children in the verbal group communicating 
mostly with the therapists and children in the nonverbal group directing nonverbal communication and phrase speech 
toward their caregiver. Both groups interacted with the canine with the same intensity; however, children in the verbal 
group interacted with the canine more than the nonverbal group. This was mostly seen in verbal interaction noted on the 
OHAIRE ethogram. Yet, the 3-AAT Observation ethogram showed that children in the nonverbal group demonstrated 
more Affection behaviors that did not require verbalization with the canine, and both groups displayed Play and Comfort 
behaviors with the canine. Likewise, there were no differences in negative verbal displays and facial expressions between 
groups, indicating both groups enjoyed interacting with the canine.

The OHAIRE ethogram noted increased frequency in Overactivity and Isolation behaviors among the nonverbal group; 
however, there was not a difference in Interfering behaviors between the groups. These results concur with prior research 
noting the connection between verbality and emotional regulation [1,4]. Current recommendations for children with

Fig 10.  SDQ maladaptive behavior means among verbal group.  (A) This figure displays the mean scores for maladaptive behaviors, derived from 
relevant subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), among participants in the verbal group. Higher scores indicate greater levels of 
maladaptive behavior. Improvement in both the Externalizing and Internalizing domains was noted; however, more improvement was noted with Internal-
izing behaviors. Comparably, the means of the PANAS weekly score, as portrayed in Fig 11, reflect improvement in behavior and emotional regulation in 
the verbal group, with an increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect.

externalizing behaviors include addressing language deficits [4], and AAT may be an avenue to increase verbality among 
nonverbal children with ASD.

The SDQ scores reflected an improvement in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from AAT sessions 
in the verbal group with a noted plateau after the midpoint of the study. The Emotional Problems and Conduct Problems 
domains were identified as the most prevalent behavioral concerns at the of the study. These scores affected the Exter-
nalizing behaviors score, which demonstrated the same uptick at the midpoint of the study. However, the SDQ Impact 
scores decreased throughout the study, implying participants experienced less distress and impairment at home, school, 
with friendships, and in leisure activities. Moreover, the weekly PANAS scores reflected more positive behaviors and less 
negative behaviors at the end of the study, agreeing with the monthly SDQ assessments.

One focus of future research in AAT is to determine the influence of the canine on the therapeutic outcomes in par-
ticipants [32–34]. Also, possible placebo effects should be analyzed. In our study, RQs 1 and 2 possible placebo effects 
are minimal since these questions measure the child’s interaction and bonding with the canine. Further investigation of 
possible placebo effects for RQ3 is warranted, as the child may experience improvements in behavior due to the positive 
relationship with the therapist and not because the canine was present.

As previously stated, the nonverbal group was comprised of younger participants (ages 3to 5 years) while the verbal group 

contained a broader range of participants (ages 4 to 10). A larger sample size with older nonverbal children is recommended 
to see if nonverbal children of all ages have more interactions in the Affection domain than those who are verbal. Both groups 
were similar in that they had participants who were receiving speech language and occupational therapies at the time of the 
study and each contained one participant enrolled in a developmental preschool. None of the participants in the nonverbal

Fig 11.  PANAS Means Among Verbal Group. (A) This Figure presents the average scores for Positive Affect and Negative Affect, as measured by the 
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), within the verbal group. These scores represent participants’ self-reported emotional states. Higher 
Positive Affect scores indicate an increase in positive emotions and behaviors, while lower Negative Affect scores suggest a reduction in negative emo-
tions and behaviors. The data show improvements in both affect domains.

group had received prior psychological therapy or counseling due to their young age; however, they were enrolled in allied 
health therapies, giving them some experience in a therapeutic setting. Therefore, we consider the data for RQs 1 and 2 to 
accurately reflect behavior occurring within a typical therapy session. Likewise, one participant in the verbal group saw a 
school counselor during the school year, one other participant was seeing a psychologist at the time of this study, and one 
participant had seen a psychologist for therapy prior to enrolling in the study. Most of the participants in the verbal group had 
not seen a therapist to address behavioral concerns, equating their therapeutic experiences to those in the nonverbal group. 
Lastly, the mean ADOS-2 comparison score for the nonverbal group (7.66) and the verbal group (6.78) were similar, meaning 
participants from both groups displayed moderate to severe symptoms of ASD. However, due to the smaller sample size, we 
could not run an analysis to confirm there was not a statistical difference in ASD symptomology between the groups.

Future studies should enroll a large enough sample to conduct more advanced statistical models, such as using a 
structural equation modeling analysis to investigate significant differences in the interaction between therapy animal and 
autistic children, prosocial behavior and emotional regulation regarding child’s verbal ability, race, and/or cultural back-
grounds. Likewise, while our study expanded the outcomes to include effects experienced in-between AAT sessions, 
future studies should examine the lasting effect of AAT months after the sessions have concluded to compare results of 
AAT with the long-term outcomes experienced by participants receiving traditional therapy modalities. Furthermore, the 
possible influence of canine interaction on participants’ oxytocin levels should be assessed to see if the oxytocin levels 
increase during therapy and remain elevated after AAT has ended [35,36].

Other limitations of this study include omission of the PANAS and SDQ scores in the nonverbal group did not allow for 
comparison of the behavior apart from AAT sessions. The use of one canine is another study limitation. Also, not all AAT 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326085  July 1, 2025

sessions were recorded due to technical problems with the overhead camera and handheld camera. Interactions occur-
ring outside of the clinic room were not recorded and could not be coded or evaluated; therefore, interactions with the 
canine such as Hide and Seek and Walking were not included in the analysis.

Conclusion and recommendations

Results from this study indicate mental health practitioners can successfully incorporate canines into the plan of care for children 
with ASD to achieve therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, AAT may be an option for families who cannot afford a service canine 
of their own. Future research must investigate the impact of canines in AAT sessions, determining if canines only aid the therapy 
process or can be trained to perform activities to enhance health outcomes that cannot be attained without them. One hypothesis 
explaining the mechanism of action for AAT sessions indicates that the human-animal bond is a vital part of the therapeutic pro-
cess and desired outcomes would not be attained without the inclusion of the animal in therapy sessions [32,33]. This premise is 
supported by research demonstrating the use of live canines over plush toys or other objects [15]. The results also support further 
investigation into AAT activities to promote communication among autistic children with limited verbality, reduce emotionality, and 
increase socialization. Mental health practitioners can use canines as “transitional objects” in AAT sessions, allowing children with 
ASD to practice social skills in AAT sessions and later apply learned behavior in everyday settings [37]. Thus, activities to achieve 
desired outcomes must be investigated to standardize therapy sessions so all mental health practitioners obtain expected results. 
Furthermore, human-animal interaction must be investigated among ethnic groups, ages, genders, intellectual abilities, social 
motivation, developmental level, and verbal abilities to determine best practice for utilizing canines to assist the pediatric ASD 
population. Also, the ethical use of canines is an important subject for future studies and should investigate the number and 
duration of daily sessions, rest requirements between sessions, and the best canine temperament for this type of work. Lastly, 
the effect of canine interaction on human cortisol and oxytocin levels could explain the documented success of AAT [35,38], and 
merits further exploration. The canine was trained to provide comfort measures and deep pressure upon detecting the escalation 
of stimming behavior or anxiety in the participants as these techniques naturally increase human oxytocin levels. These interven-
tions could have resulted in improved socialization and emotional regulation, hypothesizing that AAT could be used to elevate 
endogenous serum oxytocin levels in children with ASD [38,36]. Nonetheless, current literature supports the incorporation of 
canines in mental health therapy sessions for pediatric patients with ASD to achieve therapeutic outcomes.
