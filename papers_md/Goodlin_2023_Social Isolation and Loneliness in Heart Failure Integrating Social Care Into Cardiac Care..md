EDITORIAL COMMENT

Social Isolation and Loneliness
in Heart Failure
Integrating Social Care Into Cardiac Care*

T he painfulness of loneliness has been a sub-

ject of poetry for thousands of years. Indeed,

in older adults, severe loneliness was associ-

—Psalm 25:16

ated with an increased subsequent report of pain,

fatigue, and depression, as well as with these 3 symp-
toms as a cluster.1 Its link with “social isolation” in
sociologic and medical publications over the past
several decades deﬁnes distinct concepts that varia-
bly interact with each other (one can be socially iso-

lated, but not lonely, or lonely even though one is

socially connected). Social isolation and loneliness

are prevalent among all ages; among older adults,

they are associated with increased health problems
and increased Medicare expenditures.2,3 Social isola-
tion and loneliness have increasingly been suggested
as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 4

In this issue of JACC: Heart Failure, Liang et al5
used a large publicly available database from the

United Kingdom to examine the relationships be-

tween social

isolation and/or

loneliness among

464,773 participants in the UK Biobank study, a

population-based cohort, with the development of

heart failure (HF) hospitalization or death over a
median of about 12 years. They identiﬁed higher rates
of HF hospitalization or death with increasing social

isolation or with loneliness, although the HRs for both

conditions were attenuated by socioeconomic status,

health conditions, and medications. More social

isolation, without loneliness, had a higher HR for HF

hospitalization or death. Similar results were previ-
ously identiﬁed in other databases, 6,7 but not in other
studies.4 The present study also evaluated genetic
risks for HF, ﬁnding that within each population ter-
tile of genetic risk, social isolation increased the HR

for development of HF hospitalization or death.

Others have studied the UK Biobank, and other

databases, to identify the association of social isola-

tion or loneliness with cardiovascular disease in

general, with coronary heart disease, myocardial

infarction,

stroke, and hospitalization or death

caused by myocardial infarction and death. In gen-

eral, there may be a positive association between the

social isolation and loneliness responses and hospi-

talization and death.

There is a well-documented, strong association

between social relationships, socioeconomic status,
and cardiometabolic disease.8 Some have suggested
that the mechanism for the association of social

isolation and/or loneliness with cardiovascular dis-

ease is activation of the sympathetic nervous system
and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis.9

Risk for loneliness and social
negative inﬂuences on health are associated with

A challenge in the published reports about social

isolation and loneliness is that these are concepts

with accepted measurement but no gold standard
measurements.4 In the current study, 2 questions

In the study by Liang et al,5 loneliness and social
isolation were more common in men and were asso-

ciated with adverse health behaviors and status, such

as tobacco use and obesity. That men are more often

What else can clinicians do to address social

isolation and loneliness? Because social determinants

of health are increasingly recognized as important

components of patient-centered health care, it may
be appropriate to incorporate speciﬁc interventions,
such as “social prescribing” into care.13 Addressing

What may be important from a preventative health

health care delivery to integrate social care. We sug-

standpoint is that the age of the population studied

was relatively low (mean age: 57 years), and the study
identiﬁed additional risk factors that might be inter-
vened on in population health and individual patient

care to reduce cardiometabolic disease and HF hos-

pitalization and death.

The relationship with social isolation and loneli-

ness is probably strongest in those persons at ex-
