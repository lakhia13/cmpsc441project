Abstract

Background. Given the widespread nature and clinical consequences of self-harm and
suicidal ideation among adolescents, establishing the efficacy of developmentally appropriate
treatments that reduce both self-harm and suicidal ideation in the context of broader adoles-
cent psychopathology is critical.
Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Dialectical Behaviour
Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) literature on treating self-injury in adolescents (12–19
years). We searched for eligible trials and treatment evaluations published prior to July
2020 in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library
databases for clinical trials. Twenty-one studies were identified [five randomized-controlled
trials (RCTs), three controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and 13 pre-post evaluations]. We
extracted data for predefined primary (self-harm, suicidal ideation) and secondary outcomes
(borderline personality symptoms; BPD) and calculated treatment effects for RCTs/CCTs and
pre-post evaluations. This meta-analysis was pre-registered with OSF: osf.io/v83e7.
Results. Overall, the studies comprised 1673 adolescents. Compared to control groups, DBT-
A showed small to moderate effects for reducing self-harm (g = −0.44; 95% CI −0.81 to
−0.07) and suicidal ideation (g = −0.31, 95% CI −0.52 to −0.09). Pre-post evaluations sug-
gested large effects for all outcomes (self-harm: g = −0.98, 95% CI −1.15 to −0.81; suicidal
ideation: g = −1.16, 95% CI −1.51 to −0.80; BPD symptoms: g = −0.97, 95% CI −1.31 to
−0.63).
Conclusions. DBT-A appears to be a valuable treatment in reducing both adolescent self-
harm and suicidal ideation. However, evidence that DBT-A reduces BPD symptoms was
only found in pre-post evaluations.

Self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts represent major mental health concerns for
adolescents around the world. Suicide is the leading cause of death for female adolescents and
the third highest cause of death for male adolescents in the western world (Collaboration
GBoDP, 2016; Hawton, Saunders, & O’Connor, 2012). In addition, meta-analyses estimate
that 22.9% of adolescents have engaged in self-harm whereby they deliberately and directly
damage their body tissue in the absence of suicidal ideation (Gillies et al., 2018). Although
there is ongoing debate about the nature of the relationship between self-harm and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (Hamza, Stewart, & Willoughby, 2012), the two are related (Gillies
et al., 2018). Meta-analyses of longitudinal studies estimate that people who engage in self-
harm have 4.27 greater odds of subsequently attempting suicide, and those who engage in
deliberate self-harm – regardless of suicidal intent – have 1.51 greater odds of subsequent
death by suicide (Ribeiro et al., 2016).

Adolescence represents a key developmental period for both self-harm and suicidality
(Wyman, 2014). Although suicide is uncommon before the age of 15, the prevalence of suicide
strongly increases from late adolescence to early adulthood (Bertolote & Fleischmann, 2002).
Self-harm also tends to begin during early adolescence around 13–15 years, with growing evi-
dence to suggest that earlier onset of self-harm increases the risk of a more severe trajectory
(Ammerman, Jacobucci, Kleiman, Uyeji, & McCloskey, 2018; Groschwitz et al., 2015;
Plener, Schumacher, Munz, & Groschwitz, 2015). Self-harm and suicidal ideation typically
present alongside other psychiatric disorders, such as affective and stress-associated disorders
(Nock, Joiner, Gordon, Lloyd-Richardson, & Prinstein, 2006), and among adults the most

well-established link is with borderline personality disorder (BPD;
Ferrara et al., 2012; Kaplan et al., 2016). Given the widespread
nature and clinical consequences of adolescent self-injury, estab-
lishing developmentally appropriate treatments that reduce both
self-harm and suicidal ideation in the context of broader adoles-
cent psychopathology is critical.
One treatment which has

is
Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A). DBT
was initially developed to treat women diagnosed with BPD at
high-risk for suicide (e.g. Chapman, 2006; Linehan, Heard, &
Armstrong, 1993) and is widely recommended as an established
therapeutic approach for people with BPD, particularly when
reducing
(APA, 2006; National
a priority
Collaborating Center for Mental Health, 2009). Subsequently, a
dialectical behavioral approach was adapted for adolescents,
which prioritizes self-harm and suicidal ideation as the primary
targets for therapeutic intervention (Miller, Rathus, & Linehan,
2017; Rathus & Miller, 2002). DBT-A is a manualized treatment
approach intended for outpatient settings comprised of weekly
individual therapy with concurrent participation in a skills-group
and which includes parental participation. In particular, DBT-A
focuses on developing mindfulness, distress tolerance, interper-
sonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation behavioral skills as
the main therapeutic tools for overcoming pervasive emotion dys-
regulation and suicidal ideation (Miller et al., 2017; Rathus &
Miller, 2015).

self-injury

is

To date, two reviews evaluating the efficacy of psychosocial
treatments for reducing adolescent self-harm and suicidal ideation
(Glenn,
have highlighted DBT-A as a promising treatment
Franklin, & Nock, 2015; Kothgassner, Robinson, Goreis, Ougrin,
& Plener, 2020). However, previous meta-analysis focused exclu-
sively on a small number (k = 3) of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs; Kothgassner et al., 2020), and the systematic review of con-
trolled clinical trials (CCTs, trials including a control group, but
which lack randomization) and pre-post evaluations only included
studies published prior to July 2013 (k = 5, no RCTs; Glenn et al.,
2015). Given both the clinical importance of responding effectively
to adolescent self-harm and suicidal ideation, and the limited num-
ber of DBT-A RCTs highlighted in previous reviews, we decided to
include all studies across different stages of clinical evaluation in
order to provide the most comprehensive synthesis of the current
evidence. In addition, although DBT has shown success in treating
BPD symptoms in adults, the efficacy of DBT-A for treating BPD
symptoms among adolescents who self-injure remains to be evalu-
ated (Cristea et al., 2017). Thus, in this review, we include RCTs,
CCTs, and pre-post evaluation studies to evaluate the efficacy of
DBT-A for reducing self-harm, suicidal ideation and BPD symp-
toms among adolescents, and conduct subgroup analyses to com-
pare the results for RCTs with those of less rigorous studies. The
greater heterogeneity in studies also allows us to assess whether
characteristics of the study (e.g. participant age, treatment duration)
moderate the meta-analytic effect of DBT-A on outcomes, in order
to better understand the parameters under which DBT-A is most
successful.

Method

Search strategy and inclusion criteria

We conducted a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Google
Scholar, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for clin-
ical trials for studies published from the beginning of database

‘Suicidal

‘Self-harm’ OR ‘Self-Injury’,

records until 31 July 2020 using the keywords ‘Dialectical
Behaviour Therapy’ OR ‘DBT-A’ and combinations of the key-
Ideation’, OR
words
‘Suicide’ with an age limitation. Studies were included in the
meta-analysis if
they reported an RCT or CCT comparing
DBT-A with a control intervention or a pre-post evaluation of
DBT-A and reported outcomes for self-harm and/or suicidal
ideation in adolescents aged 12–19 who had engaged in self-
injury at least once. We also excluded studies focusing solely on
pharmacological treatments. No limitations on language or pub-
lication status were invoked, and no other inclusion or exclusion
criteria were applied.

We analyzed the frequency of self-harm episodes and suicidal
ideation as primary outcome measures, with BPD symptoms as a
secondary outcome measure. The title, abstract, and main text of
each study were examined, with the exclusion of documents
occurring at each stage. The initial search generated 932 results.
Title and abstracts were screened for eligibility and full-text papers
were obtained where necessary to evaluate inclusion. After screen-
ing, 21 studies – all peer-reviewed journal articles in English –
were identified and included in our meta-analysis.

Data extraction and analysis

Data from included studies were entered into a spreadsheet inde-
pendently by two authors (ODK and KR). A third author (AG)
reviewed and discussed differences until consensus was reached.
We coded the sample and intervention characteristics of each
study included in the meta-analysis. For analyses of the efficacy
of DBT-A in RCTs and CCTs, the primary outcome was the stan-
dardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) between the DBT-A and
control interventions on self-harm and suicidal ideation measured
post-intervention. The secondary outcome was the standardized
mean difference (Hedges’ g) for BPD symptoms in the DBT-A
and control
interventions measured post-intervention. For
analyses regarding pre-post treatment effects, we computed the
standardized mean difference (Hedges’ g) based on means and
standard deviations (Dunlap et al., 1996) before and after
DBT-A intervention using
g = (Mpost-Mpre)/
SDpooled, where Mpost is the mean of the measure after the inter-
vention and Mpre the mean before the intervention, with SDpooled
as the standard deviation for both measurements, defined as
SDpooled = SQRT(SDpre

)/2 (Lakens, 2013).

Means, standard deviations, and sample sizes were retrieved
and inserted into a spreadsheet. If means or standard deviations
were not reported in studies or Supplemental materials, conver-
sions via Revman Calculator (Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) or
formulas (Card, 2012) were conducted. If self-harm episodes
were reported as proportions or odds ratios, they were trans-
formed to Hedges’ g via the formula provided in Lipsey and
Wilson (2001). Effect size calculations and meta-analyses were
conducted with the metafor package for R (Viechtbauer, 2010).
Following established conventions, an effect size of 0.20 was con-
sidered a small effect size, 0.50 a medium effect, and 0.80 a large
effect size (Cohen, 1988). Random-effects models were applied to

duration, gender composition, and participant mean age moder-
ated the effect of the DBT-A on each outcome. Egger’s regressions

were conducted to estimate publication bias (Sterne & Egger,
2005), with adjusted effect sizes calculated using trim-and-fill
analyses and, based on funnel plot asymmetry, numbers of
imputed missing studies (Duval & Tweedie, 2000). All data and
analysis code are available on the Open Science Framework
(doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/YZXPJ).

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias for each study was assessed using predefined criteria
based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality method
guide (see Supplement 1; Viswanathan et al., 2018). Each study
was assessed in regard to randomization, selection and attrition
bias, confounding bias, measurement bias, and statistical pro-
blems and received a rating of low, moderate or high risk of
bias. Low risk of bias indicates that the study was judged to be
valid, moderate risk indicates concerns that probably do not invali-
date the study’s results, and high risk of bias indicates significant
concerns that likely invalidate the study’s results. Two investigators
(KR and ODK) independently assessed the studies and differences
were reviewed until consensus was reached.

Results

In total, 21 studies were identified (see Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flow
diagram). Five studies were RCTs, three studies were CCTs, and
13 were pre-post evaluation studies (see Table 1 for an overview
of study characteristics). The study by Rathus and Miller
(2002) – originally included as a CCT – was included as a pre-
post evaluation study, given that data for the control intervention
was unavailable. In total, the 21 studies comprised 1673 adoles-
cents. Overall, 1063 participants received DBT-A interventions,
and 610 received control interventions. A sufficient number of
studies (k > 1; Pigott, 2012) were identified to calculate aggregate
effect sizes for self-harm and suicidal ideation outcomes in RCTs,
CCTs, and pre-post evaluations. However, only one controlled
study reported BPD symptoms as an outcome, and so this out-
come was solely assessed among pre-post evaluations. Across
studies, participants tended to be female (M = 82%) and 15.4
years old (S.D. = 1.3). An average of 7% of participants dropped-
out across studies (range: 0–40%) and 63% received concurrent
psychopharmacological intervention over the course of the inter-
vention (k = 11 studies did not provide sufficient data about
medication).

interventions,

First, we considered the overall efficacy of DBT-A, compared
for reducing adolescent self-harm.
to control
Seven effect sizes encompassing 1314 participants (DBT-A: n =
714, Control: n = 600, k = 7) were extracted. Meta-analysis
revealed a significant difference between groups (g = −0.44, 95%
CI −0.81 to −0.07, p = 0.021) with a high heterogeneity between
studies (I2 = 80.13%). That is, DBT-A interventions showed a
small-to-medium improvement in reducing self-harm compared
to control interventions. See Fig. 2 for a comparison of DBT-A
(relative to control interventions) by study type (RCT or CCT)
for reducing self-harm.

Next, we considered the overall efficacy of DBT-A, compared
to control interventions, for reducing adolescent suicidal ideation.
Five effect sizes encompassing 1159 participants (DBT-A: n = 604,
Control: n = 555, k = 6) were extracted. Meta-analysis revealed a
significant difference between groups (g = −0.31, 95% CI −0.52
to −0.09, p = 0.006), with moderate heterogeneity between studies
(I2 = 44.05%). That is, DBT-A was moderately more effective at
reducing suicidal ideation than control interventions. See Fig. 3
for a comparison of DBT-A (relative to control interventions)
by study type (RCT or CCT) for reducing suicidal ideation.

In terms of BPD symptoms, Mehlum et al. (2014) conducted
the only RCT which assessed the efficacy of DBT-A in reducing
BPD symptoms. They reported that both DBT-A (n = 39) and
‘enhanced usual care’ (non-manualized standard care provided
at least once weekly for the purpose of the trial; n = 38) reduced
BPD symptoms, but
found no significant group difference.
Given that only one RCT was eligible for inclusion in this review,
we did not conduct meta-analysis of the effect of DBT-A and con-
trol interventions on BPD symptoms.

Moving beyond group comparisons of treatment and control
interventions, we next considered within-subject changes in self-
harm, suicidal ideation, and BPD symptoms following DBT-A
intervention. Table 2 shows the effects of DBT-A across outcome
measures. Among participants who received DBT-A, pre-post
comparisons indicate large reductions in self-harm (g = −0.98),
ideation (g = −1.16), and BPD symptoms (g = −0.97).
suicidal
ideation
All effects were statistically significant, with suicidal
(I2 = 54.58) and BPD symptoms (I2 = 43.51) showing moderate
heterogeneity, and self-harm showing low-to-moderate hetero-
geneity (I2 = 0.00) across studies.

Next, in order to better understand the parameters in which
DBT-A is most effective, we assessed whether study characteristics
moderated the efficacy of DBT-A in reducing adolescent
self-harm and suicidal ideation. We conducted multiple meta-
regression to assess whether treatment duration (in months),
age (in years), or proportion of young women in the overall
sample (compared to young men) moderated the size of
meta-analytic effects between DBT-A and control interventions
(see Supplement 2 for all coefficients). Treatment duration was
negatively associated with the change in effect sizes for suicidal
ideation (b = −0.08, p = 0.012), but not self-harm (b = −0.06,
p = 0.379). That is, a longer duration of DBT-A led to a larger
reduction in suicidal ideation when compared to control interven-
tions. In contrast, gender composition and age of the sample
did not

influence the effect size of

We repeated these meta-regressions for the assessments of
effect sizes in pre-post evaluations (see Supplement 2 for all coef-
ficients). Again, treatment duration was negatively associated
with larger effect sizes for reducing BPD symptoms (b = −0.29,

p = 0.016), such that the longer the DBT-A treatment the larger
the reduction in symptoms from pre to post. No other moderating
effects of treatment duration were found. Similarly, gender com-
position and age of the sample did not influence any of the out-
comes in pre-post analyses.

We next consider the potential impact of publication bias in
the studies examined in these meta-analyses. For each outcome
(both in the effect as compared to control interventions and in
pre-post comparisons), visual inspection of funnel plots suggested
studies were symmetrically

four outcomes,

distributed. That is, we found no evidence for publication bias
in the studies assessing self-harm, suicidal ideation, or BPD symp-
toms included in the present meta-analyses. In addition, Egger’s
regression found no evidence for funnel plot asymmetry in the
analyses we conducted (all zs < 1.64, all ps > 0.100). Given that
no indication of publication bias was found, no adjustments
according to trim-and-fill analysis were conducted in any of the
analyses.

Finally, we evaluate the quality of the studies included in the
current review using predefined criteria based on the Agency

for Healthcare Research and Quality method guide (Viswanathan
et al., 2018). Overall, statistical problems were common with
57.1% of studies rated at ‘High’ risk of bias due to low sample
sizes. High risk of measurement bias (38.1%) and confounding
bias (33.3%) was also common, due to reliance on unvalidated
instruments or inadequately addressing potential confounds.
Taken together, quality assessments highlight the need for wide-
spread adoption of standardized measurement instruments and
well-powered replication studies (see Supplement 1).

Discussion

Given the scarcity of studies investigating the efficacy of DBT-A in
reducing adolescent self-harm and suicidal ideation, particularly
in the context of comorbid psychopathology such as BPD, we
conducted a systematic review of controlled trials to inform best-
practice clinical decision making. Our meta-analysis included 21
studies comprised of 1673 participants and provides evidence to
support the efficacy of DBT-A (compared to control interven-
tions) for reducing self-harm and suicidal ideation as primary
outcomes. The effect size for self-harm reduction in favor of
DBT-A was large for RCTs and small-to-medium when CCTs
were included. The effect sizes for suicidal ideation reduction in
favor of DBT-A were small-to-medium for both RCTs and
when all controlled studies were included in the analysis. The cur-
rent review identified an insufficient number of studies to evaluate
the efficacy of DBT-A in BPD symptoms.

A growing body of research demonstrates that therapeutic
interventions for self-harm and suicidal
ideation in general
show limited efficacy (Fox et al., 2020; Kothgassner et al., 2020),
highlighting the importance of isolating specific therapies which
show promise for further development. In a review of all pub-
lished RCTs targeted at reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors,
DBT showed a small treatment effect for self-harm, but had no
effect on suicidal ideation (Fox et al., 2020). Similarly, in a review
of controlled trials investigating the efficacy of DBT among adult
samples found a small effect in favor of DBT for reducing self-
injury, but no effect on suicidal ideation (DeCou, Comtois, &
Landes, 2019). Focusing specifically on children and adolescents,
our results reveal promising effects of DBT-A for both self-harm
and suicidal ideation for both RCTs and CCTs. Given that adoles-
cence is a key developmental period for both self-harm and sui-
cidal
future research is needed to
understand the underlying mechanism(s) of how DBT-A works
to improve self-harm and suicidal ideation.

ideation (Wyman, 2014),

Across all studies, our findings indicate that longer duration of
DBT-A may be crucial for greater efficacy, particularly for suicidal
ideation. Additionally, longer treatment duration was associated
with greater reductions in BPD symptoms in pre-post evaluations.
These findings correspond to the DBT-A treatment hierarchy in

which further BPD symptoms are addressed in later stages of
therapy, after an initial focus on establishing sufficient behavior
control. Since the therapeutic relationship can be considered as
a critical reinforcement for people with BPD (Bedics, Atkins,
Harned, & Linehan, 2015), a longer duration may mean a more
effective use of the therapeutic relationship in terms of contin-
gency management (Miller et al., 2017).

(Goldstein et

al., Mehlum et

We also found larger effect sizes for self-harm and suicidal
ideation in RCTs than in CCTs. This difference might be
explained by the fact that these study types differ by recruitment
setting. RCTs predominantly recruited adolescents receiving out-
patient
2014;
for McCauley et al.
Santamarina-Perez et al., 2020), except
(2018) who included adolescents recruited from both inpatient
and outpatient settings, whereas all CCTs reporting self-harm
and suicidal ideation outcomes consisted of participants recruited
from inpatient settings (Katz, Cox, Gunasekara, & Miller, 2004;
McDonell et al., 2010; Tebbett-Mock, Saito, McGee, Woloszyn,
& Venuti, 2020). Another potential explanation may lie in the dif-
ferent methodological quality of RCT and CCT studies.

al.,

No study accounted for the combined effect of pharmacological
treatment with DBT-A, despite the fact that psychopharmaco-
logical treatment for adolescents with BPD in general is common
(Cailhol et al., 2013), and over half of participants treated in the
included trials received additional psychopharmacological treat-
ment. Further, some studies reported reduction of medication or
adherence as an outcome variable (Katz et al., 2004; McDonell
et al., 2010; Tebbett-Mock et al., 2020). However, to date the effi-
cacy of a combined therapy approach remains unclear.

Critically, DBT-A targets both the adolescent and their family.
Typically, adolescents continue to live in the environment where
they acquired their dysfunctional patterns and so families are inte-
grated into therapy in order to address invalidating behaviors
within the family context. In terms of contingencies, this holistic
approach reinforces skills and helps to decrease maladaptive beha-
viors by addressing both the adolescent’s and parent’s behavioral
and communicative repertoire. Preliminary research provides tenta-
tive support for these mechanisms of change. In a non-randomized
pilot of DBT-A among a small sample of ethnic minority adoles-
cents, adaptive coping at pretreatment predicted subsequent
increased use of DBT skills at post-treatment (Yeo et al., 2020).
Secondary analysis of McCauley et al. (2018) revealed that adoles-
cents who reported higher emotion dysregulation at baseline, and
whose parents reported greater psychopathology and emotion dys-
regulation demonstrated greater reduction in self-harm following
6-months of DBT-A treatment (Adrian et al., 2019). In a longitu-
dinal study of adults with a recent suicide attempt who received
DBT treatment, participants with higher problem-focused coping
and poorer access to emotion regulation strategies were more likely
to reattempt suicide over the course of 2 years (Kuehn, King,

Psychological Medicine

Linehan, & Harned, 2020). However, future research is needed to
better establish mechanisms of therapeutic change, as well as iden-
tify who stands to benefit most from DBT-A.

Our review has several

limitations. First, only one RCT
(Mehlum et al., 2014) assessed the impact of DBT-A (compared
to control
interventions) on BPD symptoms, preventing us
from meta-analytically considering change in BPD symptoms as
a secondary outcome. Second, we reported a moderately high het-
erogeneity among studies assessing the efficacy of DBT-A on
self-harm. This heterogeneity might be due to the use of different
control interventions, with some studies using specific psychothera-
peutic control interventions (McCauley et al., 2018) and providing
enhanced usual care or additional propositions (Mehlum et al.,
2014; Santamarina-Perez et al., 2020). Alternatively, this heterogen-
eity may reflect differences in how self-harm was assessed; 58.8% (k
= 7) of studies used unvalidated clinical interviews, medical records,
daily diary cards, or instruments developed in-house to assess self-
harm. Moreover, our meta-analysis is limited by the low number of
effects available to be included which contributes to the wide con-
fidence intervals of some of the estimates. Finally, young women
made up 75% or more of the sample in most studies (81.0%, k =
17) included in this review. Thus, questions remain regarding the
efficacy of DBT-A in reducing self-harm and suicidal ideation
among young men and gender-diverse young people.

Despite these limitations, this review provides the most com-
prehensive analysis to date of the available evidence for the effi-
cacy of DBT-A in reducing self-harm and suicidal
ideation
among adolescents. Current evidence indicates that DBT-A is
interventions in reducing both self-harm
superior to control
and suicidal ideation among adolescents, with limited evidence
of efficacy for reducing BPD symptoms. Future research should
focus on improving the quality of evidence for the efficacy of
DBT-A for underrepresented populations such as young men
and gender diverse people, and for reducing BPD symptoms
among adolescents in general. Greater investigation is also needed
to understand the combined effect of DBT-A and psychophar-
macological interventions, as well as to establish the feasibility
and efficacy of DBT-A in teletherapeutic contexts in order to
improve accessibility for young people who require specialized
care for reducing their self-harm behavior and suicidal ideation.
