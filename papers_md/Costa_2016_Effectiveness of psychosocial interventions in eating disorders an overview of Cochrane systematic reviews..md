Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in eating 
disorders: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews
Efetividade de intervenções psicossociais em transtornos alimentares:  
um panorama das revisões sistemáticas Cochrane

Marcelle Barrueco Costa1, Tamara Melnik1

ABSTRACT
Eating  disorders  are  psychiatric  conditions  originated  from  and 
perpetuated  by  individual,  family  and  sociocultural  factors.  The 
psychosocial  approach  to  treatment  and  prevention  of  relapse 
is  crucial.  To  present  an  overview  of  the  scientific  evidence 
on  effectiveness  of  psychosocial  interventions  in  treatment  of 
eating disorders. All systematic reviews published by the Cochrane 
Database  of  Systematic  Reviews  -  Cochrane  Library  on  the  topic 
were  included.  Afterwards,  as  from  the  least  recent  date  of  these 
reviews  (2001),  an  additional  search  was  conducted  at  PubMed 
with sensitive search strategy and with the same keywords used. A 
total of 101 primary studies and 30 systematic reviews (5 Cochrane 
systematic reviews), meta-analysis, guidelines or narrative reviews 
of literature were included. The main outcomes were: symptomatic 
remission, body image, cognitive distortion, psychiatric comorbidity, 
psychosocial  functioning  and  patient  satisfaction.  The  cognitive 
behavioral  approach  was  the  most  effective  treatment,  especially 
for  bulimia  nervosa,  binge  eating  disorder  and  the  night  eating 
syndrome.  For  anorexia  nervosa,  the  family  approach  showed 
greater effectiveness. Other effective approaches were interpersonal 
psychotherapy,  dialectic  behavioral  therapy,  support  therapy  and 
self-help  manuals.  Moreover,  there  was  an  increasing  number  of 
preventive  and  promotional  approaches  that  addressed  individual, 
family and social risk factors, being promising for the development 
of positive self-image and self-efficacy. Further studies are required 
to evaluate the impact of multidisciplinary approaches on all eating 
disorders,  as  well  as  the  cost-effectiveness  of  some  effective 
modalities, such as the cognitive behavioral therapy.

RESUMO
Transtornos  alimentares  são  doenças  psiquiátricas  originadas  de  e 
perpetuadas  por  fatores  individuais,  familiares  e  socioculturais.  A 
abordagem psicossocial é essencial para o tratamento e a prevenção 
de  recaídas.  Apresentar  uma  visão  geral  das  evidências  científicas 
sobre a efetividade das intervenções psicossociais no tratamento de 
transtornos alimentares. Foram incluídas todas as revisões sistemáticas 
publicadas no Banco de Dados de Revisões Sistemáticas da  Cochrane 
Library. Posteriormente, a partir da data menos recente destas revisões 
(2001),  realizou-se  uma  busca  adicional  no  PubMed,  com  estratégia 
de  busca  sensibilizada  e  com  os  mesmos  descritores  utilizados 
antes. No total, foram incluídos 101 estudos primários e 30 revisões 
sistemáticas  (5  revisões  sistemáticas  da  Cochrane),  metanálises, 
diretrizes ou revisões narrativas da literatura. Os principais desfechos 
foram  remissão  de  sintomas,  imagem  corporal,  distorção  cognitiva, 
comorbidade  psiquiátrica,  funcionamento  psicossocial  e  satisfação 
do paciente. A abordagem cognitivo-comportamental foi o tratamento 
mais  efetivo,  principalmente  para  bulimia  nervosa,  transtorno  da 
compulsão  alimentar  periódica  e  síndrome  do  comer  noturno.  Para 
anorexia nervosa, a abordagem familiar demonstrou maior efetividade. 
Outras  abordagens  efetivas  foram  psicoterapia  interpessoal,  terapia 
comportamental  dialética,  terapia  de  apoio  e  manuais  de  autoajuda. 
Além disso, houve um número crescente de abordagens preventivas 
e  promocionais  que  contemplaram  fatores  de  risco  individuais, 
familiares  e  sociais,  sendo  promissoras  para  o  desenvolvimento  da 
autoimagem  positiva  e  autoeficácia.  São  necessários  mais  estudos 
que  avaliem  o  impacto  de  abordagens  multidisciplinares  em  todos 
transtornos alimentares, além da relação custo-efetividade de algumas 
modalidades efetivas, como a terapia cognitivo-comportamental.

INTRODUCTION

The eating disorders have specific diagnoses, including 
anorexia  nervosa  (AN),  bulimia  nervosa  (BN)  and 
binge  eating  disorder  (BED).(1)  However,  subclinical 
forms are more frequent across all age groups.(2-4) Along 
with subclinical forms, BED is more common than AN 
and  BN,  and  due  to  its  specific  clinical  manifestation 
and strong association with obesity, it is classified as a 
diagnostic category in fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-V).(1-3,5)  
The  prevalence  of  BED  in  the  United  States  within 
the period of 12 months is 1.6% for women and 0.8% 
for men.(1) The prevalence between genders in BED is 
more  similar  than  AN  or  BN,  which  predominate  in 
young  females.(1)  The  12-month  prevalence  of  AN  in 
these women is approximately 0.4%, and of BN varies 
from 1 to 1.5%.(1) 

AN is characterized by restriction of energy intake 
relative  to  requirements,  leading  to  a  significantly 
low body weight; intense fear of gaining weight or of 
becoming  fat,  or  persistent  behavior  that  interferes 
with weight gain; disturbance in the way in which one’s 
body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence 
of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent 
lack  of  recognition  of  the  seriousness  of  the  current 
low  body  weight.(1)  BN  is  characterized  by  repetitive 
episodes  of  binge  eating  (eating  an  amount  of  food 
that  is  definitely  larger  than  what  most  individuals 
would  eat  in  a  similar  period  of  time  under  similar 
circumstances with a sense of lack of control), followed 
by compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxative use, and 
excessive physical activity) in an attempt to undo the 
excessive intake of food, as well as a disturbance in the 
perception  of  shape  and  weight,  like  in  AN.(1) These 
episodes  occur  at  least  twice  a  week  for  a  minimum 
period of 3 months.(1) In BED, the same episodes occur 
with  similar  frequency  and  duration,  but  patients  do 
not  generally  have  regular  compensatory  behaviors 
to  combat  excessive  consumption  of  food  and  often 
present with overweight or obesity.(1) 

The other specified eating disorder category includes 
other  eating  symptoms  that  result  in  clinically  significant 
distress  or  impairment  in  social  functioning,  but  do 
not  meet  the  full  criteria  for  the  three  categories 
mentioned  above  (AN,  BN  and  BED).  This  category 
includes  atypical  AN  (all  criteria,  except  low  body 
weight); BN of low frequency and/or limited duration; 
binge-eating disorder of low frequency and/or limited 
duration;  purging  disorder  (compensatory  behaviors 
without binge eating); night eating syndrome (NES −  
recurrent  episodes  of  night  eating,  as  manifested  by 

eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food 
consumption after the evening meal).(1) The NES can 
be distinguished from BN and BED, mainly by the lack 
of compensatory behaviours associated in an attempt 
to counteract the excessive food intake that occurs in 
BN, and by the time of excessive food intake (night), 
unlike BED, in which binge eating episodes can occur 
at any time of the day.(1)

The  psychosocial  interventions  are  important  for 
effective  eating  disorders  treatments  in  the  long  run, 
since  they  address  psychological  and  social  factors 
involved in onset and maintenance of this disorders.(2,4)  
The  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT),  e.g.,  was 
accepted  as  one  of  the  main  treatments  for  eating 
disorders.(2-4)  There  is  strong  evidence  of  efficacy  for 
bulimic  symptoms  (binge  eating  and  compensatory 
behaviors) in BN and BED using some techniques, such 
as  cognitive  restructuring  and  regulation  of  feeding.(2)  
The  model  of  CBT  for  eating  disorders  is  based  on 
the  fact  that  dysfunctional  beliefs  (regarding  thinness 
and  dissatisfaction  with  the  physical  shape  and  body 
weight)  maintain  the  abnormal  eating  behavior  and 
related characteristics, such as purgation and abuse of 
laxatives, diuretics and diet pills.(2) The CBT approach 
is  multimodal  and  includes  nutritional  counseling, 
psychoeducation,  self-monitoring,  as  well  as  cognitive 
and  behavioral  interventions.(2)  The  analysis  of  the 
family  context  is  very  relevant,  especially  in  children 
and  adolescents  at  risk.  It  is  known  that  interventions 
that  aimed  at  fast  and  timely  improvement,  focusing 
only on nutritional counseling or medication, are often 
not  effective;  thus,  the  approach  of  individual,  family 
and social factors is required for both weight loss and 
regain  to  be  achieved  and  maintained,  depending  on 
the type of eating disorders.(2-4)

OBJECTIVE
The objectives of this article were to compile  findings 
of  relevant  scientific  papers,  such  as  randomized 
controlled  trials,  systematic  reviews,  meta-analysis, 
guidelines and narrative reviews of literature, in order to 
promote knowledge about effectiveness of psychosocial 
interventions in eating disorders along time, in addition 
to showing the need for further research in specific areas. 

METHODS
Type of study
Inclusion criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCT), systematic reviews  
(SR),  meta-analysis  (MA),  guidelines  and  reviews  of 

einstein. 2016;14(2):235-77Costa MB, Melnik Tliterature on effectiveness of psychosocial interventions 
in eating disorders, including patients of any age and 
sex,  with  any  chronic  condition  diagnosed  together 
with  eating  disorders,  according  to  Russell  criteria 
(1979),  the  DSM  and  the  International  Classification 
of Diseases (ICD). Other study designs were included, 
such  as  prevention,  cohort,  cost-effectiveness,  rapid 
response, pilot study, provided they were in accordance 
with  the  outcomes  examined  in  this  study.  The 
data  were  extracted  from  abstract  or  full  text,  when  
necessary. 

Other  study  designs,  such  as  guidelines,  cost-
effectiveness  ratio,  prospective  studies,  risk  factors, 
prevention,  predictors  and  moderators  of  response 
to  treatment  were  included  whenever  appropriate 
and  relevant  for  the  outcomes  analyzed  in  this 
research (eating disorders symptoms, personal and social 
functioning, psychiatric co-morbidities, cognitive distortion, 
body image, adherence, weight). 

The  tables  with  the  findings  observed  are  divided 
into subtypes of eating disorders, and one classification 
of  eating  disorders  in  general.  This  division  was  done 
in  order  to  facilitate  the  organization  of  research.  In 
the general table, there are studies with the three types 
(AN, BN and BED) and subclinical forms.

Exclusion criteria
Papers mentioned above that examined other types of 
interventions (neither psychological nor psychosocial), 
such as diets, exercise, and medication.

Types of intervention
Experimental group
Interventions  of  all  modalities  and  settings  including 
psychological  or  psychosocial  techniques,  and  their 
combinations among themselves or with medication. 

Control group
No treatment, waiting list, usual treatment (e.g. measuring 
weight and height, and nutritional counseling).

Type of outcomes
Primary outcome 
Symptomatic  remission:  according  to  Russell  (1979), 
DSM,  ICD  or  standard  scale  (e.g.  Eating  Disorder 
Examination  –  EDE  and  Eating  Disorders  Examination 
Questionnaire - EDE-Q). 

For  AN:  recovery  of  weight  within  the  normal 
range (body mass index − BMI) at the end of therapy; 

237

for  BN:  100%  withdrawal  from  binge  eating  at  the 
end  of  therapy,  mean  score  of  bulimic  symptoms  or 
frequency  of  binge  eating  at  the  end  of  treatment, 
weight  BMI.  For  BED/eating  disorder  not  otherwise 
specified  (EDNOS),  remission  of  bulimic  symptoms, 
weight BMI.

Body  image,  cognitive  distortion,  psychological 
symptoms (anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive 
symptoms),  psychosocial  functioning,  and  patient 
satisfaction.

Eating  disorder  symptom  measurements  using  any 
recognized  validated  eating  disorder  questionnaire  or 
interview schedule, e.g. the Morgan Russell Assessment 
Schedule (Morgan, 1988), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT; 
Garner,  1979),  Eating  Disorders  Inventory  (Garner, 
1983; Garner, 1991).

Secondary outcomes: adverse effects 
Search strategy
An initial search was made in the Cochrane Database 
of  Systematic  Reviews  (CDSR)  of  the  Cochrane 
Library.  The  keywords  used  were  “anorexia  nervosa”, 
“bulimia  nervosa”,  “binge  eating  disorder”,  “night 
eating syndrome” and “eating disorders”. All SR that 
included  psychological  or  psychosocial  interventions 
were included. 

Later, the same keywords were searched at PubMed 
with limits of date (2001 to October 2013), considering 
that 2001 is the least recent update of CDSR, and type 
of studies: RCT, SR and MA. All primary studies, SR, 
MA  and  literature  reviews  addressing  psychological  or 
psychosocial  interventions  were  included.  Then,  the 
literature  after  2001  was  searched  based  on  types  of 
eating disorders and outcomes, to provide an overview 
of evidence along time (before and after 2001), taking 
into  account  that  the  CDSR  conducts  an  extensive 
search  of  primary  studies,  including  unpublished 
literature,  ongoing  clinical  trials  and  conference 
proceedings.  Likewise,  the  PubMed  database  covers 
a considerable amount of scientific publications. Both 
searches allowed to have an overview of psychosocial 
techniques  for  eating  disorders,  based  on  studies 
published  over  time,  as  demonstrated  throughout 
this  article  and  especially  in  the  tables  of  findings 
(Appendix 1). 

We  searched  for  additional  data.  In  sources  of 
guidelines,  we  searched:  National  Institute  for  Health 
and  Clinical  Excellence  (NICE),  Scottish  Intercollegiate 
Guidelines Network (SIGN), Royal College of Physicians, 
Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College

Assessment  programme,  The  Cochrane  Library,  NHS 
Economic  Evaluations,  Health  Technology  Assessments, 
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health 
and  International  Network  of  Agencies  for  Health

The Cochrane Library, Central Register of Controlled 
Trials  and  MEDLINE  (with  RCT  filter).  Bandolier, 
Drug  &  Therapeutics  Bulletin,  TRIP  database  and 
Central  Services  Agency  COMPASS  Therapeutic 
Notes  were  sources  of  evidence-based  reviews  and 
evidence  summaries;  Department  of  Health  and  Health 
Management  Information  Consortium  (HMIC)  were 
sources of national policy.

Review selection
The two authors independently assessed the titles and 
abstracts found in the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews  of  The  Cochrane  Library  and  at  PubMed. 
Differences  were  resolved  by  discussion  to  reach 
consensus.

Data analysis
The  authors  used  the  data  extraction  tables  they 
prepared and analyzed each diagnosis of eating disorders 
separately,  whenever  possible,  since  the  analyzed 
outcomes  were  different  for  each  specific  diagnosis. 
Data on population, interventions and outcomes were 
independently  extracted  and  qualitatively  analyzed. 
Differences  were  resolved  by  discussion  to  reach 

consensus. Individual narrative review summaries were 
used  to  present  the  results.  A  brief  summary  of  the 
main  findings  was  included  in  the  discussion  section. 
For  more  information  on  psychosocial  techniques 
that are shown in the boxes, see the table of findings 
(Appendix 1). 

RESULTS
The Cochrane Library
We  identified  five  Cochrane  SR  on  the  treatment  of 
eating  disorders.(6-10)  The  data  of  the  last  update  and 
studies included in Cochrane SR are showed in table 
1.  The  updates  of  the  first  version  and  subsequent 
versions of each Cochrane SR are done from time to 
time and may change or not the results of the current 
version. The main characteristics of the Cochrane SR 
are shown in appendix 2. The psychosocial interventions 
evaluated in Cochrane SR were self-help  and  guided 
self-help  for  eating  disorders,  family  therapy  and 
individual  psychotherapy  for  AN,  antidepressants 
versus psychological treatments (and their combination) 
for  BN,  and  psychological  treatments  for  BN  and 
binging (binge eating). The results of the main outcomes 
analyzed  are  in  appendix  3.  The  results  of  these  five 
Cochrane SR are limited by their updates. 

Cochrane systematic reviews on anorexia nervosa 
Family  therapy  showed  reduction  of  symptoms  after 
intervention  in  two  short  studies  (lasting  less  than  12 
months)  as  compared  to  usual  care.  When  compared 
to  psychological  interventions,  as  cognitive  behavior 
therapy  (CBT),  cognitive  analytic  group,  ego-oriented 
psychotherapy,  individual  supportive  therapy,  no 
differences  were  found  in  four  trials,  as  shown  in 
appendix  3.  However,  in  one  study,  that  compared 
family  therapy  with  individual  supportive  therapy,  the 
participants  were  separated  by  age  and  duration  of 
disease;  significant  results  in  remission  of  symptoms 
were  found  in  younger  people  with  an  age  of  onset 
less than 18 years and less than 3 years of duration of 
disease  with  21  participants  (Group  1).  The  results 
were  also  significant  in  Group  1  for  weight  gain,  but 
these two results were not significant at 5-year follow-
up.  In  other  Cochrane  SR  of  psychotherapies  for  AN 
(not  family  therapy),  there  was  insufficient  evidence 
in  comparisons  to  seven  studies:  focal  psychoanalytic 
therapy,  interpersonal  psychotherapy  (IPT),  cognitive 
analytical therapy, cognitive therapy, CBT and behavioural 
therapy.

Cochrane systematic reviews on bulimia nervosa and 
on binge eating disorder 
Bulimia nervosa
When psychotherapy alone was compared to medication, 
there was better remission in five studies; the dropouts 
rates  were  higher  in  the  antidepressant  group  in 
four  studies  as  shown  in  appendix  3.  The  combined 
treatments  compared  to  medication  alone  showed  a 
better  remission  in  the  short  run  in  four  studies;  also 
in  combined  treatments,  the  dropouts  were  higher 
for  medication  alone  than  combined  treatments,  in 
four  studies.  The  combined  treatments  compared  to 
psychotherapy alone showed a better remission; however, 
in combined treatments, the dropouts were higher than 
psychotherapy alone in six studies. 

Bulimia nervosa and binge eating
The CBT (mainly CBT-BN) showed significant results in 
remission as compared to the waiting list/no treatment 
in  8  studies,  as  well  as  in  mean  bulimic  symptoms  in 
12  studies.  Besides,  CBT  showed  improvement  in 
depression symptoms as compared to the waiting list in 
seven  studies,  as  shown  in  appendix  3.  Comparing  to 

others  psychotherapies,  IPT,  behavioral  therapy  (BT), 
exposure  and  response  prevention,  hypnobehavioral 
therapy,  supportive  therapy,  behavioral  weight  loss 
treatment, CBT was favored for remission symptoms in 
ten studies. When only studies of BN were considered, 
the  difference  was  significant  in  seven  studies.  Moreover, 
when  comparing  CBT  to  others  psychotherapies  (all 
cited  above  plus  non-directive  counseling,  supportive-
expressive therapy, and weight loss therapy), CBT showed 
significant improvement in mean bulimic symptoms in 
15 studies. Other psychotherapies showed some benefits, 
mainly  IPT,  in  reducing  binge  eating  in  the  long  run 
as compared to no treatment. Self-help based in CBT 
approaches  also  resulted  in  some  benefits.  However, 
for weight variations, individual psychotherapy showed 
little or no reduction. Only BT for weight loss showed 
a trend in this direction in the subgroup of overweight 
patients and with BED.

Cochrane systematic reviews on eating disorder
In Cochrane SR about pure self-help and guided self-
help, the two types showed improvement as compared 
to waiting list for two studies about other eating disorder

PubMed database
The additional research was done at PubMed using the 
following MESH terms: “anorexia nervosa”, “bulimia 
nervosa”,  “binge-eating  disorder”,  “night  eating 
syndrome”  and  “eating  disorders”.  MA,  RCT,  SR  and 
data  range  2001-10/2013  were  used  as  limits.  A  total 
of  716  studies  were  found.  To  include  in  the  table  of 
findings (Appendix 1), we selected 101 studies and 30 SR, 
MA or literature review (5 Cochrane SR). The results 
of searches and the number of studies included in the 
table of findings are shown in tables 2 and 3. 

These tables include at total 101 studies and 30 SR, 

MA, guidelines, or literature review (5 Cochrane SR).

DISCUSSION
One  limitation  of  this  article  was  the  absence  of  a 
detailed  methodological  analysis  of  the  investigations 
mentioned,  due  to  the  large  amount  of  studies. 
Furthermore, it was necessary to summarize most results 
obtained.  The  complete  material  is  displayed  in  the 
appendices.

On  the  other  hand,  this  overview  of  scientific 
evidence on eating disorders provides a global approach 
of evidence along time (before and after 2001), taking 
into account that the CDSR include an extensive search 
of  primary  studies,  including  unpublished  literature, 
ongoing  clinical  trials  and  conference  proceedings.  The 
same applies to PubMed, a database with high reliability 
and  sensitivity.  Moreover,  since  a  mapping  was  done 
in  two  reliable  databases  -  The  Cochrane  Library  and 
PubMed, it is easy to perform an upgrade from the date 
of  the  search  of  studies  on  PubMed  (10/2013)  to  get 
the  update  of  new  psychosocial  techniques  for  eating 
disorders and learn about their progression over time.

Anorexia nervosa
The effective psychotherapy in AN was short-duration 
family therapy, mainly the Maudsley family therapy for 
adolescents.(11-21) In the Maudsley approach, the family 
plays  a  key  role  in  recovery  of  patients  with  anorexia.(12,13) 
For  adolescents  with  severe  obsessive-compulsive 
symptoms,  the  long-term  family  therapy  can  be  more 
effective.  When  the  parents  clearly  express  much 

241

criticism towards the eating behavior of adolescents, it 
is  recommended  to  avoid  their  presence  in  the  initial 
sessions.(19,20)  For  adults,  the  Maudsley  family  therapy 
should  be  better  adapted  in  new  studies.(17)  Some 
options  of  individual  psychotherapies  that  may  work 
for  AN  are  focal  psychoanalysis,  CBT  and  supportive 
psychotherapy.(18,21-24)  In  one  multicenter  study,  the 
focal  psychodynamics  and  CBT  were  compared  in 
outpatients’ setting.(25) Besides, the CBT may work for 
adults after hospital discharge to prevent relapse, and 
for  inpatients  with  severe  AN.(22-26)  The  combination 
of CBT plus fluoxetine may help patients that already 
achieved  a  normal  weight  to  maintain  it.(27)  The  best 
predictors  found  in  a  study  of  weight  maintenance  in 
weight-restored  AN  patients  were  the  level  of  weight 
restoration  after  concluding  the  acute  treatment 
and  avoiding  weight  loss  immediately  after  intensive 
treatment.(27,28)  In  acute  anorexia,  low-dose  antipsychotic 
medication may help, mainly for anxious and obsessive 
symptoms.(29) An exposure therapy specifically focused 
on meal consumption was tested, but further studies are 
required to confirm its effectiveness.(30)

Bulimia  nervosa,  binge  eating  disorder,  and  night 
eating syndrome
For  BN,  BED  and  the  subclinical  forms  of  these 
disorders,  CBT  is  the  most  effective  psychotherapy  in 
reduction of associated behaviors, such as binge eating 
and  purging.(9,31-33)  Adaptations  of  CBT  were  made 
especially for BN and BED (CBT-BN and CBT-BED).(9,31) 
These approaches were made for adults, but they may 
be applied to older adolescents.(15) 

The  IPT  is  also  effective  to  alleviate  symptoms, 
mainly  in  the  long  run.(9,31,33)  The  family  therapy 
approaches  showed  benefits  in  bulimic  adolescent 
patients,  although  they  seem  to  be  more  effective  in 
those  with  less  associated  psychopathology.(24) Moroever, 
fluoxetine  is  effective  to  ameliorate  of  BN  symptoms 
in  the  short  run.(8,24,32)  The  CBT  can  be  offered  in 
self-help  (guided  or  not),  and  also  can  be  addressed 
in  different  formats,  such  as  computer  software,  
CD-ROMs,  internet,  e-mail,  telemedicine,  telephone, 
short  message  service  (SMS).(34-41)  Some  strategies  have 
been developed to increase effectiveness of psychosocial 
interventions,  such  as  feedback  after  interventions, 
contact  via  SMS  and  text  messaging.(38,39)  Besides,  the 
dialectic  BT  is  also  effective  for  both  (DBT-BN  and 
DBT-BED).(24,42,43)  DBT  is  an  approach  that  aims  to 
reduce binge eating while improving adaptive emotion-
regulation skills.(24,42,43)

The  new  “enhanced”  version  of  the  treatment 
(CBT-E)  is  an  approach  developed  for  all  eating 
disorders and subclinical forms, drawn from the CBT-
BN and taking into account transdiagnostic perspective 
of these disorders.(2) This means that all eating disorders 
sharing  the  same  core  cognitive  psychopathology  −  
excessive value given to physical appearance and weight, 
which distinguishes them from other psychiatric disorders 
and  is  responsible  for  maintening  eating  disorders.(2)  
It  is  called  “enhanced”  because  it  broadly  describes 
strategies  to  increase  compliance  and  have  better 
treatment  outcomes,  dealing  with  some  issues,  such  as 
humor intolerance, perfectionism, low self-esteem, and 
interpersonal difficulties.(2) 

There is a growing number of studies addressing the 
association  between  weight  control  and  eating  disorders, 
especially  in  BED.(34)  Only  the  behavioral  weight  loss 
treatment  may  work  for  weight  loss.(9)  Patients  with 
BED  do  not  generally  have  regular  compensatory 
behaviors to combat excessive consumption of food, as 
BN patients do, and are often overweighted or obese.(1)  
Due  to  the  prevalence  among  eating  disorders  and 
strong association with obesity, BED is in DSM-V as a 
separate diagnostic category, and is no longer included 
in  the  EDNOS  section,  which  facilitate  its  identification 
and  treatment.(1)  The  combination  of  psychosocial 
interventions  and  medications  may  be  necessary  to 
achieve both weight loss and reduced binge eating, and 
possible  relief  of  depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms. 
Some  combined  treatments  include  the  following 
drugs: fluoxetine, topiramate, sertraline and orlistat.(29,44) 
These  combined  treatments  showed  a  reduction  in 
weight  loss  in  the  short  run,  although  there  may  be 
some side effects.(29) 

Furthermore, the new constellation of eating symptoms 
that shows sufficient data in order to be included as a 
clinical  condition  in  DSM-V,  and  that  presents  strong 
association  with  obesity  is  NES,  as  mentioned  in  the 
section of Feeding and Eating Conditions not Elsewhere 
Classified.(1)  NES  is  manifested  by  recurrent  episodes 
of  the  night  eating,  like  eating  after  awakening  or 
excessive  food  consumption  after  the  evening  meal.(1) 
Patients  are  aware  of  the  episodes  and  recall  them.(1) 
NES  is  positively  associated  with  stressful  events,  and 
the greater the degree of obesity, the greater the chance 
of  having  this  syndrome.(1)  There  is  also  indication 
of  a  significant  correlation  between  NES  and  sleep 
disorders,  anxiety  and  depression.  For  NES,  a  pilot 
study  of  CBT  may  work  in  decreasing  the  number  of 
nocturnal  ingestions  and  calorie  intake  after  dinner.(45) 
Behavioral  strategies  and  brief  relaxation  also  may 
work for reducing NES symptoms.(45) 

Eating disorders
Further  studies  about  eating  disorders  are  required, 
and  they  should  address  intervention  and  prevention 
techniques, in addition to risk factors, such as physical 
appearance,  weight  and  eating  concerns,  as  well  as 
body  image  disturbance  and  internalization  of  media 
patterns, including both sexes and all age groups, since 
the current studies enrolled very few men  and usually 
address older adolescents or adults.(4,15) 

Furthermore,  some  studies  were  found  on  the 
construction  of  positive  schemes  on  self-image  and 
general  aspects  in  female  adults  (and  children  and 
adolescents),  that  could  be  included  in  the  school 
syllabus to prevent the development of eating disorders 
and mental dysfunctions related to body, eating behaviors 
and self-efficacy.(4,15)

Finally, it is necessary to dissemination the effective 
interventions for eating disorders offered by healthcare 
professionals,  who  are  not  specialized,  aiming  to 
promote  multidisciplinary  care,  especially  in  primary 
health care. Many patients with eating disorders do not 
receive  appropriate  treatment  or  seek  intervention  for 
weight loss, in case of BN, BED and subclinical forms.(4,9)

CONCLUSION

The  studies  included  described  the  cognitive  behavior 
approach as the most effective modality of psychological 
intervention. Others interventions that showed effectiveness 
were dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, 
family-based interventions and supportive therapies. The 
manual-based self-help is an intervention often effective 
and can be provide in different ways for prevention and 
treatment of eating disorders. 

The  binge  eating  disorder  should  be  treated  as  a 
separate  category  of  eating  disorder,  according  to  the 
DSM-V,  and  the  night  eating  syndrome  as  a  group  of 
significant eating symptoms. 

The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for 
eating  disorders  may  vary  depending  on  the  clinical 
features of patients, such as the level of chronicity and 
the  biological  and  psychosocial  co-morbidities.  There 
is  an  increasing  number  of  interventions  that  include 
eating  disorder  symptoms  related  to  body  image, 
concern  about  appearance  and  weight,  self-esteem,  as 
well anxiety and depression symptoms, which enhance 
applicability of these results in the clinical practice. 

Taking  into  account  the  multifactorial  etiology  of 
eating disorders and the high prevalence of subclinical 
forms,  the  investigations  are  increasingly  addressing 
interventions  to  prevent  the  development  of  these 

einstein. 2016;14(2):235-77Costa MB, Melnik Tdisorders by considering the individual, family and social 
risk factors. Yet, approaches that aim to build positive 
self-concept and self-image must be fostered.

For  future  research,  it  is  important  to  report  on 
knowledge  about  cognitive  behavioral  intervention 
techniques  and  other  psychosocial  approaches  of 
eating  disorders  for  different  professionals,  in  various 
settings, in order to foster a multidisciplinary approach. 
Further  studies  analyzing  cost-effectiveness  of  cognitive 
behavioral therapy and behavioral weight loss therapy are 
necessary. Investigations on psychosocial interventions 
for night eating syndrome are requires, since there are 
significant clinical eating symptoms. And, the impact of 
the media should be investigated in future longitudinal 
studies.
