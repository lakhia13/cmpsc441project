Abstract

The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular non-human primate species 
for developing transgenic and genomic edited models of neurological disorders. These models 
present an opportunity to assess from birth the impact of genetic mutations and to identify 
candidate predictive biomarkers of early disease onset. In order to apply findings from marmosets 
to humans, a cross-species comparison of typical development is essential. Aiming to identify 
similarities, differences, and gaps in knowledge of neurodevelopment we evaluated peer-reviewed 
literature focused on the first six months of life of marmosets and compared to humans. Five major 
developmental constructs, including reflexes and reactions, motor, feeding, self-help, and social, 
were compared. Numerous similarities were identified in the developmental sequences with 
differences often influenced by the purpose of the behavior, specifically for marmoset survival. 
The lack of detailed knowledge of marmoset development was exposed as related to the vast 
resources for humans.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-human primates (NHPs) serve as valuable animal models of human disease. The 
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is an increasingly popular NHP species for 
developing models of neurological disorders (‘t Hart et al., 2000; Okano, Hikishima, Iriki, &

Sasaki, 2012; Tardif, Abee, & Mansfield, 2011). Conditions such as Parkinson’s disease 
(Ando et al., 2008; Ando et al., 2012; Gnanalingham, Smith, Hunter, Jenner, & Marsden, 
1993; Huot et al., 2012), Huntington’s disease (Kendall et al., 1998; Maclean, Baker, Ridley, 
& Mori, 2000), Alzheimer’s disease (Baker, Ridley, Duchen, Crow, & Bruton, 1993) and 
multiple sclerosis (‘t Hart et al., 2000; Genain & Hauser, 1997) have been modeled in 
marmosets mainly by neurotoxin administration. Advances in the role of genetics in these 
disorders, as well as in the tools to generate transgenic and genomic edited models, are 
moving the field towards a new generation of disease models.

Several characteristics of the common marmoset make the species attractive for genetic 
approaches. Marmosets frequently deliver twins or triplets and have a shorter gestation 
period than other primates. Additionally, marmosets living in captivity have a shorter 
lifespan than old world NHPs, an advantage in the study of age-related disorders. Finally, the 
smaller size and relatively easy temperament of marmosets facilitates their handling, 
housing, and care (Abbott, Barnett, Colman, Yamamoto, & Schultz-Darken, 2003; Schultz-
Darken, Braun, & Emborg, 2016; Tardif et al., 2003; Tardif et al., 2011; Tardif, Mansfield, 
Ratnam, Ross, & Ziegler, 2011).

Transgenic and genomic edited models present an opportunity to assess from birth the 
impact of genetic mutations and to identify candidate predictive biomarkers of early disease 
onset. In order to apply these findings from marmosets to humans, a cross-species 
comparison of typical development is essential. Prior research of typical marmoset 
development includes a combination of direct observation and retrospective recall of 
marmoset behavior (Braun, Schultz-Darken, Schneider, Moore, & Emborg, 2015; de Castro 
Leão, Duarte Dória Neto, & de Sousa, 2009; Kaplan & Rogers, 2006; Missler et al., 1992; 
Pistorio, Vintch, & Wang, 2006; Wang, Fang, & Gong, 2014; Yamamoto, 1993). Marmoset 
development has been based on distinct postnatal stages, though the definitions of these 
stages differ between research groups; thus, expression of marmoset age in weeks, as 
opposed to postnatal stage, can be used to avoid ambiguity. Most knowledge of typical 
marmoset development is concentrated within the first 16–24 weeks of life, prior to the onset 
of sexual maturity and adulthood.

Although the underlying theoretical perspectives of human development have changed over 
time, the typical sequence has been well studied and clearly outlined since the 1940s (Gesell 
et al., 1940; Gesell, 1945; Gesell & Amatruda, 1947). Current theories suggest a complex 
interaction of biological maturation, engagement, and environmental context explaining 
detailed progression across developmental constructs (Bronfenbrenner, 1994; Gibson, 1988; 
Schmidt & Lee, 1988; Wertsch, 2008). The majority of children achieve these developmental 
milestones in a similar order, often within similar timeframes. Due to the vast knowledge of 
human development, a multitude of developmental screenings and assessments provide 
standardized knowledge of pivotal milestones and skills (e.g., Bayley, 2006; Squires, 
Bricker, & Potter, 1999). These tools allow a means for identification of atypical 
development associated with various conditions which could eventually lead to the 
identification of predictors of disease to emerge later in life.

Using the vast preexisting data on human development and the emerging data on the 
common marmoset development, the purpose of this study is to identify similarities, 
differences, and gaps in knowledge of the neurodevelopment of the common marmoset as 
compared to humans. The typical development comparison will provide a foundation for the 
understanding of normal neurodevelopment and genetic models of child and adult 
neurological disorders while potentially identifying candidate predictive biomarkers of 
disease.

2 METHODS

A systematic search for peer-reviewed articles related to developmental timelines in the 
common marmoset and in humans was conducted in CINAHL and PubMed up to January 
2017. Academic databases were searched using key terms such as development, human, 
child, and marmoset as well as related terms such as reflexes, motor, feeding, social, and 
behavior. In addition, reference lists, textbooks, and standardized assessments were reviewed 
for relevant information. Searches were limited to the English language. We included both 
prospective and retrospective resources with developmental information as primary or 
secondary outcomes of the research. Limited quantity of relevant documents related to 
marmoset development were identified. However, a plethora of resources on human 
development were found, thus references were chosen subjectively based on quality and 
publication date.

Marmoset references were reviewed initially with identification of developmental milestones 
and age of skill attainment, primarily focusing on birth to approximately six-months as it is 
the most rapid period of development in primates (King, 1974; Tardif, 2002). Second, 
human development resources were reviewed and comparable milestones were identified 
along with age of skill attainment. In addition, foundation human developmental skills that 
were unmatched in the marmoset literature were noted. All marmoset and human resources 
were reviewed independently by at least two team members. Age of skill attainment for both 
species was rounded to weeks if reported in days. Occasionally, the average age of marmoset 
skill attainment differed among articles. In this case, the approximate age of attainment from 
an article based on direct observation of marmoset behavior was prioritized over information 
based on retrospective questionnaires. Furthermore, the approximate age of attainment for 
several marmoset skills was extended to reflect similar ranges from multiple articles. The 
approximate age of attainment for human skills remained fairly consistent across multiple 
sources.

Team meetings with experts in both marmoset and human development occurred over a 
period of several months in order to collaboratively identify and review comparable 
developmental skills in both species. In addition, essential marmoset and foundational 
human skills that were unmatched in the other species were agreed upon by all team 
members. Finally, identified skills were reviewed and grouped into major developmental 
constructs.

3 RESULTS

Page 4

The systematic search resulted in identification of seven peer-reviewed research articles 
related to development of the common marmoset. Six articles relied on direct observation of 
marmoset behavior, while one article used a retrospective questionnaire to describe 
marmoset development. Human development has been extensively studied and described. As 
a result, 27 resources related to human development were employed to complete this cross-
species comparison; they included peer-reviewed articles, standardized developmental 
assessments, and renowned textbooks. See Table I for detailed information about 
bibliography used.

Milestones gathered through the systematic search were organized into five primary 
developmental constructs, based on categories commonly cited in human developmental 
research. The constructs were reflexes and reactions, motor (gross and fine), feeding, self-
help, and social skills. Reflexes included automatic, involuntary responses to stimuli, while 
reactions encompassed automatic responses which function to keep the body upright. Motor 
skills were considered as large (gross) movements important in ambulation and small (fine) 
movements critical in precise manipulation of objects. Feeding skills consisted of behaviors 
to support the attainment of proper nutrition. Self-help skills supported independent 
functioning and self-reliance. Finally, social skills included behaviors that support 
communication (e.g., visual skills) and interaction with other members of the species (e.g., 
reproductive development).

Two important developmental constructs, vocalizations and cognition, are not reported in the 
results of this comparison. The first, vocalizations, is highly complex in marmosets; as a 
result, the topic was deemed too specific for this broad developmental comparison. The 
second, cognition, is not yet well studied or understood in the developing common 
marmoset. In contrast, cognition is highly developed, complex, and widely studied in 
humans.

Results presented in Tables II–VI, which are organized by developmental construct, 
identified marmoset skills and approximate age of skill attainment. Related human skills and 
approximate age of attainment are to the right of each marmoset skill. The bottom of each 
table includes essential marmoset skills and/or foundational human skills unmatched 
between species (either not present or not documented). Several skills can be found in more 
than one table, as their purposes meet criteria of multiple developmental constructs. For 
example, self-feeding and finger feeding are found in Tables IV and V, as they are important 
feeding and self-help skills.

Table II compares typical developmental reflexes and reactions in marmosets and humans. 
To date, the studied spectrum of reflexes and reactions in marmosets have been limited. 
Reflexes and reactions in marmosets have primarily been examined within the first month of 
life (Braun et al., 2015); as a result, the age at which these responses are inhibited has not 
been identified in our review. Of note, reflexes such as the palmar and plantar grasp and the 
rooting response are present in both species around birth. Further study of the sucking and

pharyngeal reflexes in marmosets would provide valuable insight into feeding similarities 
between the species.

Typical developmental gross and fine motor skills are outlined in Table III. Many similarities 
exist between gross motor development in marmosets and humans. Independent mobility in 
both species begins with crawling before advancing to walking and running. However, 
marmosets display jumping and climbing behaviors earlier in life than humans, likely due to 
the arboreal nature of the species. Figure 1 shows side by side marmoset and human 
climbing. In addition, while similarities exist between aspects of movement patterns such as 
geotaxis, their early emergence for survival in marmosets is essential. For example, early in 
life young marmosets must understand how to negotiate getting off and on their caregivers 
and proper physical positioning. Human infants do not develop that skill until they begin 
negotiating changes in positions, crawling, or climbing up stairs. Fine motor skills are 
important to independent feeding in both species. In marmosets, the ability to hold onto the 
carrier’s back is an essential survival skill, as this is the primary form of mobility in early 
life. Development of fine motor skills in humans is well outlined, as these skills are essential 
for playing, learning, and socialization. The same level of description is not available in 
marmosets at this time.

Table IV illustrates many similarities between the development of feeding skills in 
marmosets and humans. Both species nurse at birth in order to obtain essential nutrients for 
growth and survival. Similarly, both begin to eat solid foods during the weaning period, prior 
to cessation of nursing or bottle feeding. The ability to capture living prey is a feeding skill 
essential to marmoset survival, which is unmatched in human development. Another 
important unmatched skill for marmosets, particularly in the wild, is tree gouging. 
Marmosets use their incisors to chew holes through tree bark to feed on the sap or energy 
rich gum (Lacher, da Fonseca, Alves, & Magalhaes-Castro, 1981). Figure 2 shows examples 
of feeding behaviors in marmosets and human children.

Table V compares developmental self-help skills, many of which are similar in marmosets 
and humans. Both species display self-mouthing and self-calming behaviors relatively early 
in life. Physical independence is accompanied by spontaneous exploration of the 
environment and expression of the desire for autonomy in both species. Marmosets, 
however, display self-grooming behavior earlier in life than humans.

Typical developmental social skills are outlined in Table VI. Both species display visual 
orientation and visual following early in development to support a number of motor skills 
and allow engagement in social interactions. Marmosets and humans engage in solitary play 
before social play in groups. However, humans develop their ability to engage in quality 
social interactions with individuals and groups sequentially, while these types of individual 
and group social skills unfold simultaneously in marmosets. Scent marking in marmosets 
begins earlier in development than human protection of toys. The purpose of scent marking 
in marmosets is protection of space and feeding resources (i.e., tree gouging behavior) 
between family groups versus within a family. Social grooming is an important skill in 
marmosets that serves a primary social purpose versus hygiene, often beginning between a 
parent and infant. Although social grooming is not named in human dyads, early in life there

are many parent-child daily hygiene activities (e.g., bathing, diapering) that support social 
connection and bonding (O’Brien & Lynch, 2011) similar to marmosets. See Figure 3.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Marmoset vs. Human

The cross-species comparison of typical development in the marmoset and human allowed 
us to begin to understand their similarities and differences while identifying important gaps 
in knowledge. Currently, there is a dearth of information in the literature comparing these 
two species even though the knowledge could serve a pivotal role in early assessment of 
genetic mutations and identification of predictive biomarkers of early disease onset.

Although marmosets and humans share significant aspects of their genome, they have 
distinct anatomical and biological differences underlying their divergent evolutionary 
development. In 2014, the marmoset genome was mapped and sequenced which has 
facilitated comparison with humans and other species to explain the emergence of specific 
traits such as twinning, and small size of the species (Harris et al., 2014; The Marmoset 
Genome Sequencing & Analysis Consortium, 2014). With respect to neuroanatomy, 
marmosets like other non-human primates, have a lissencephalic brain, albeit smaller. The 
lateral or sylvian fissure, temporal lobes, internal structures and neuroanatomical 
organization of the marmoset brain is similar to other primate brains, including humans 
(Hashikawa, Nakatomi, & Iriki, 2015; Hikishima et al., 2013; Hikishima et al., 2011; 
Newman et al., 2009). However, marmosets are a unique NHP species in that they are 
distinguished by small body size, narrow dental formula, claws on all digits except a 
specialized nail (hallux) on the first digit of each foot, which is the only opposable joint, and 
specialized scent glands in the chest and genital areas (Garber, 1992; Magden, Mansfield, 
Simmons, & Abee, 2015; Natori & Shigehara, 1992). These adaptations reflect the arboreal 
lifestyle and tree exudate diet. The anatomical similarities and differences between the 
common marmoset and humans should be considered as development between the species is 
compared. Average global human lifespan is 71.4 years (World Health Organization, 2016) 
while the average marmoset lifespan in captivity is 5–7 years (Tardif et al., 2011) with a 
maximum lifespan in captivity of about 16 years (Schultz-Darken et al, 2016). In this 
context, marmosets have an accelerated developmental timeline and by four to seven months 
of age they are already considered juveniles (de Castro Leão et al., 2009).

In the following paragraphs, we discuss differences and similarities, purpose of behaviors, 
and unmatched skills within the five developmental constructs. We highlight specific 
marmoset and human behaviors that illustrate these points.

4.2 Reflexes and Reactions

Several reflexes and reactions which are essential to survival have been identified in the 
common marmoset that are equivalent in humans. Plantar and palmar grasp reflexes are 
essential to marmoset survival, as they play an important role in the ability to cling to the 
caregiver’s back. The rooting response, critical for nursing, is present early in life in both 
humans and marmosets. To date, limited studies of reflexes and reactions in the common

marmoset have been published. Knowledge of these responses is primarily limited to the 
first four weeks of life with limited information available regarding inhibition of reflexes in 
the common marmoset. Alternatively, human reflexes have been widely studied. Inhibition 
of reflexes is well-documented, as persistence of reflexes beyond a certain age is often a sign 
of neurological damage (Zafeiriou, 2004). Study of older marmosets would provide valuable 
information regarding inhibition of reflexes and reactions essential to survival. Furthermore, 
several important reflexes in human development, such as the pharyngeal reflex and 
asymmetric tonic neck reflex, have not been studied in marmosets. An expanded 
understanding of reflexes and reactions in the common marmoset would allow for a more 
comprehensive comparison between marmoset and human development.

4.3 Motor Skills

A number of important motor skills emerge relatively earlier in marmoset than human 
development, at least partially necessitated by their arboreal lifestyle. For example, 
marmosets are able to crawl, jump, climb, and run much earlier in life than humans. The 
arboreal nature of the marmoset requires these skills to develop at a young age to enable 
independent exploration of the environment and survival of the species. These motor skills 
usually emerge later in human development, as they do not play such an essential role in 
early survival. While the same skills are important in human development, they serve as 
building blocks to support other skill development, rather than survival mechanisms. One 
essential marmoset skill that is unmatched in human development plays a similar role to the 
aforementioned skills. The ability to hold onto the carrier’s back and use negative geotaxis 
to orient the body while being carried is present from birth in the marmoset and critical to 
survival. Several skills outlined in human development, such as the pincer grasp and 
transferring objects between hands, have not been documented in marmosets. While these 
skills are likely present in marmosets (with the caveat that the pincer grasp is only present in 
their feet) they do not represent the pivotal milestones they do in humans.

4.4 Feeding Skills

Development of feeding skills in marmosets and humans share many similarities. Both 
species obtain nutrition via nursing or breastfeeding prior to progressing to solid foods, with 
marmosets reaching those milestones slightly earlier. Of note, the ability to capture living 
prey is an essential survival skill in marmosets living in the wild that is unmatched in 
humans. The emergence of this skill at a young age of eight to nine weeks is a reflection of 
necessity for independent retrieval of nutrition early in life. In contrast, humans are not 
expected to independently obtain or prepare food until much later in life. One important skill 
in human development that has not been documented in marmosets is the recognition of a 
bottle by sight. However, marmosets do allow group members close proximity in feeding 
and share food without opportunity for reciprocity (Burkart, Fehr, Efferson, & van Schaik, 
2007), which allows younger animals the ability to identify and seek out proper food items 
from other group members.

4.5 Self-help Skills

Development of self-help skills in marmosets resembles human development in several 
ways. Both species display self-mouthing, or bringing the hands to the mouth, early in

development. This skill is an important precursor to the ability to self-feed, which is 
essential to independence from caregivers in both species. Auto-grooming, environmental 
exploration, and physical independence emerge relatively early in marmoset development, 
all of which contribute to the early independence observed in the species. The ability to 
capture living prey is an essential self-help skill in marmosets that is unmatched in humans. 
As previously discussed, the ability to independently obtain nutrition at a young age is 
required for marmoset survival in the wild, but is typically not necessary to human survival 
until much later in life. Refusal of excess food is an important skill in humans for 
appropriate growth and nutrition, which has not been documented in marmosets, though the 
skill is likely present in the latter species. Regarding self-help, a number of important human 
developmental skills such as spoon-feeding and dressing, are unmatched in marmosets as 
they are not relevant to the species.

4.6 Social Skills

Social development in marmosets and humans share many similarities, due to the tendency 
of marmosets to pair-bond, live in family groups with cooperative care of the young, practice 
food-sharing, and learn by imitation in a similar manner to humans (Miller et al., 2016). 
Both species display distinct cries indicating distress early in development. Furthermore, 
both species display consolability relatively early in development, reflecting the ability of 
young marmosets and human infants to regulate behavior based on caregiver responses. 
However, marmosets live in family groups allowing for a great number of family members 
to routinely respond to and regulate young marmosets. In human Western cultures, 
immediate family members, typically the parents, are often primary caregivers with 
extended family members helping less frequently.

Head cocking is an important social skill that emerges early in marmoset development; this 
skill is related to the visual tracking that emerges early in human development. Both skills 
are essential to early visual exploration and learning. Play follows a similar progression in 
both species, beginning with solitary play and gradually expanding to include social play 
with peers. The manifestation of agonistic behaviors differs significantly between marmosets 
and humans. Marmoset displays of agonism include scent marking, piloerection, and baring 
of the teeth (de Boer, Overduin-de Vries, Louwerse, & Sterck, 2013); these behaviors are 
often related to protection of food sources (Lazaro-Perea, Snowdon, & de Fátima Arruda, 
1999; Lazaro-Perea, 2001). Agonistic behaviors in humans, specifically physical aggression, 
may have evolved from similar territorial behaviors. Social grooming is another important 
developmental skill in marmosets. Although the unique behavior is unmatched in human 
relationships, parent-child dyads participate in many similar grooming type activities (e.g., 
bathing, diapering) that contribute to dyad bonding and support infant hygiene (O’Brien & 
Lynch, 2011). Caregiver recognition and joint attention are important human developmental 
milestones that have not been documented as such in marmosets. However, marmoset 
behaviors such as nursing, food sharing, and social grooming imply similar skill attainment 
early in marmoset development as well.

4.7 Limitations of this Study and Future Directions

The current paper offers a cross-species comparison of early development and underscores 
the limited knowledge about the developing marmoset compared to the extensive and 
detailed knowledge of human development. Although a direct comparison of monkeys 
versus humans could be more informative, for the purpose of this project we chose a 
literature review of marmoset development in order to 1) analyze current available 
knowledge in the literature, 2) expand data beyond one monkey colony, and 3) compare 
human vs marmoset development using similar data mining strategies.

Human development studies began in the nineteenth century. In comparison, the first general 
report of marmoset behaviors was published in 1976 (Stevenson & Poole), further 
highlighting the infancy of marmoset developmental studies. Overall, there continues to be 
limited opportunities for marmoset observation with only three National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) sponsored captive colonies (two National Primate Research Centers and one NIH 
intramural colony) in the United States (National Primate Research Centers, n.d.). A few 
additional scattered captive populations also exist within laboratories in the United States 
and around the world such as in Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, and Japan. Of the seven original 
research papers found in marmoset development, one foundational study was retrospective 
and based on a questionnaire, which should be taken into consideration when examining the 
results (Missler et al., 1992). The number of subjects per study was relatively small ranging 
from 9 to 24 marmosets; additionally, two studies did not report the specific number of 
subjects (de Castro Leão et al., 2009; Missler et al., 1992). A combination of novelty and 
opportunity has limited research, yet the unfolding of marmoset development has become an 
increasing priority for future work as researchers aim to assess whether neurodevelopmental 
challenges emerge early in neurodegenerative disorders and whether that can be compared to 
humans.

Many of the marmoset observations took place in captive or laboratory environments. The 
extent to which the context of the marmoset observation affects the animals’ unfolding 
development (e.g.: captive vs. wild; laboratory vs. natural environment) is not clear. 
However, we do know that certain behaviors such as feeding on and defending gum exudate 
trees or an equivalent behavior are only observed in wild populations (Lazaro-Perea, 2001). 
Other behaviors persist in laboratory environments; for example, marmosets housed in 
family groups in the laboratory naturally give rise to rich social interaction and most species-
typical behaviors (Stevenson & Poole, 1976). Future studies will need to assess how 
environmental affordances may shape early marmoset development.

For the goal of this article, the identification and characterization of the behaviors can be 
used as the foundation to understand normal behavior and cognition, evaluate novel genetic-
based models, and help in the detection of early developmental markers of disease. Future 
marmoset research should explore additional developmental constructs (e.g., cognition), age 
for extinction of reflexes, and extend the comparison into adolescent and adult age ranges. 
Similar to humans, the success of marmosets achieving neurodevelopmental milestones 
provides insight into the overall health and well-being of the animals. As such, marmoset 
studies aiming to fulfill gaps in knowledge will benefit animal care, investigations on genetic 
models and treatments, and ultimately, humans.

Figure 1. 
Early mobility skills in a marmoset and humans. (A) A young marmoset (~2 months) orients 
to begin moving up an inclined surface, as compared to (B) two young children (14 months) 
creeping up stairs. Marmosets begin orienting and moving up a plane at 4 weeks, while 
humans begin creeping up stairs at 14 months.

Figure 2. 
Eating behaviors in marmosets and humans. (A) A juvenile marmoset eats a cookie, as 
compared to (B) a young child (18 months). Self-feeding skill typically emerges in 
marmosets around 4–12 weeks, while finger feeding in humans begins around 7–9 months. 
(C) A young marmoset (~3 months) engages in tree gouging for exudate, as compared to (D) 
a young child self-spoon feeding (18 months). Marmosets begin tree gouging for exudate 
around 12–16 weeks, while humans begin self-spoon feeding around 12 months.

Figure 3. 
Social grooming in marmosets and humans. (A) A marmoset father is holding an infant (~1 
month old) while being groomed by another adult member of the group, as compared to (B) 
a human parent bathing an infant (1 week old). Marmosets begin social grooming around 
16–28 weeks. While not specifically labeled social grooming, humans frequently engage in 
dyadic activities related to grooming, such as bathing and diapering.
