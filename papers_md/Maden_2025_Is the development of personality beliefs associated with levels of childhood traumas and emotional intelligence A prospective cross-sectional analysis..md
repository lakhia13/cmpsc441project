associated with levels of childhood traumas 
and emotional intelligence? A prospective 
cross-sectional analysis

Abstract
Background  Personality disorders (PD) are associated with personality beliefs (PBs). Childhood traumas (CTs) and 
emotional intelligence (EI) are effective in the development of PDs. However, the relationships between CTs and EI 
and PBs are not well known. This study examined the effects of CTs and EI on PBs.

Method  Three hundred and eighty-seven university students who applied to the psychiatry clinic and did not 
receive any psychiatric diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM-5) diagnostic criteria were recruited for the study. We applied the Childhood Trauma Scale, BarOn Emotional 
Intelligence Scale, and Personality Beliefs Questionnaire-Short Form to the volunteers. According to scores from the 
childhood trauma subscale scores, the participants divided into two groups: those with childhood trauma (CT (+), 
n = 180) and those without childhood trauma (CT (-), n = 207). The results will be evaluated with the SPSS ver. 22.0 
program.

Results  EI and PB levels were higher in CT (+) than in CT (-). We found positive and significant relationships between 
the participants’ CT, EI, and PB levels. In all participants and also in CT (+), total levels of CTs and EI predicted paranoid, 
schizoid, antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, histrionic, dependent, avoidant, and passive-aggressive PBs other than 
obsessive-compulsive PBs. The subtypes of childhood trauma did not predict PBs in CT (+), while the EI-stress 
management subscale was linked to borderline, histrionic, avoidant, and passive-aggressive PBs, and the adaptability 
subscale was linked to dependent PBs.

Conclusion  This research provides important contributions regarding how CTs and EI affect PBs. Given the significant 
impact of CT on PBs, early intervention programs should focus on promoting personality belief relationships in 
children who have experienced trauma. Mental health professionals and psychotherapists should integrate EI-based 
and emotion-focused interventions when working with individuals with trauma histories. Therapy approaches such 
as dialectical behavior therapy and trauma-informed cognitive-behavioral therapy may be useful in both improving EI 
and relational functioning in trauma survivors.

Keywords  Childhood traumas, Emotional intelligence, Personality beliefs

Introduction
Personality can be described as the dynamic organization 
of psychobiological systems that are found in every per-
son and provide adaptation to the inner and outer world 
specific to the person. The concept of dynamics empha-
sizes  that  personality  has  a  structure  that  constantly 
changes and adapts to environmental factors [1]. Within 
the  scope  of  cognitive  theory,  personality  is  conceptual-
ized  as  a  stable  organization  of  modes.  Modes  are  pat-
terns  of  thinking,  feeling,  and  acting  that  work  together 
in  certain  situations,  helping  people  meet  their  basic 
needs  for  survival  and  reproduction  by  fulfilling  their 
desires and urges. The schemas that constitute the cogni-
tive component of modes consist of beliefs, attitudes, and 
expectations that determine the strategies to be used by 
the individual [2]. Otherwise, a personality disorder (PD) 
is indicated by a stable, unchanging personality organiza-
tion that differs greatly from the norms of the culture in 
which the individual lives.

Because  of  the  strong  positive  or  negative  personality 
beliefs  (PBs)  that  shape  the  schemas  linked  to  PDs  and 
lead to certain emotions and actions, normal modes are 
triggered, which then create unhealthy personality modes 
that  result  in  PDs.  When  a  person  exhibits  over-  or 
underdeveloped  behaviors  that  confirm  their  pathologi-
cal beliefs, they meet the cognitive and behavioral criteria 
for PDs.

The  cognitive  model  of  PDs  highlights  the  influence 
of  childhood  experiences  on  the  formation  of  patho-
logical  PBs.  Individuals  who  are  hypersensitive  to  rejec-
tion,  abandonment,  and  frustration  develop  negative 
self-beliefs  in  adulthood  when  they  experience  events 
that confirm  their vulnerabilities  in childhood  [2]. Since 
childhood  experiences  that  cause  pathological  PBs  tend 
to be repeated, the basic pathological beliefs of individu-
als  with  PDs  are  overgeneralized,  rigid,  and  resistant  to 
change [3].

The  link  between  childhood  traumas  (CTs)  and  PBs 
has  been  remarkably  supported  by  recent  research.  An 
adult  research  study  found  that  the  level  of  CT  signifi-
cantly  predicted  passive-aggressive,  schizoid,  paranoid, 
and  borderline  PBs  [4].  Another  study  found  that  CTs 
were associated with all PBs except obsessive-compulsive 
PBs [5]. In a study with 393 participants aged 18 to 65, it 
was found that emotional abuse and controlling behavior 
from  parents  during  childhood  increased  the  likelihood 
of avoidant personality behaviors [6]. 

The ability to make accurate judgments based on emo-
tions  and  to  use  emotions  and  emotional  knowledge  to 
develop  thinking  are  two  characteristics  of  emotional 

intelligence  (EI)  [7].  Based  on  the  BarOn  model,  EI  is  a 
collection  of  interconnected  social  and  emotional  com-
petencies  and  talents  that  affect  our  capacity  to  identify 
and  express  who  we  are,  comprehend  and  relate  to  oth-
ers, and handle life’s obstacles [8]. Individuals with high 
EI discover and describe their own and others’ emotions, 
develop  empathy  for  others,  express  and  control  their 
emotions accurately, can better adapt to challenging situ-
ations,  cope  with  environmental  factors  using  feelings, 
and  have  the  ability  to  establish  positive  relationships. 
Research  demonstrates  that  individuals  with  high  EI 
exhibit  greater  resilience  to  negative  childhood  experi-
ences in adulthood [9]. 

Personality is the characteristics that allow a person to 
become an “individual” by distinguishing them from oth-
ers. EI is the person’s awareness of their own and others’ 
emotions during this process and their ability to use their 
emotions  effectively  in  the  interactions  that  occur  [10]. 
There  is  an  interdependent  relationship  between  per-
sonality traits and EI. Studies show that personality traits 
have an impact on the development of an individual’s EI, 
and  EI  impacts  the  implementation  and  development 
of an individual’s personality [11–13]. Peter et al. (2018) 
identified  a  significant  inverse  correlation  between  bor-
derline PD and EI scores in their research [14]. A recent 
meta-analysis showed that EI ability explains 28% of the 
variance shared with personality traits, while EI explains 
41% of the variance shared with personality traits [15].

In light of this information, according to the cognitive 
model, PBs are a reflection of personality traits [2]. Previ-
ous  studies  have  suggested  that  CTs  have  an  impact  on 
personality development [16, 17]. Studies examining the 
effects  of  CT  on  PDs  [18–20]  and  PBs  have  yielded  dif-
ferent results [4, 6]. Investigations looking at the connec-
tion between EI levels and PDs [7, 13, 21] and personality 
traits [22, 23] have also yielded various results. However, 
the relationship between EI levels and PBs, as well as the 
interactive  effects  of  CTs  and  EI  levels  on  PBs,  remains 
unclear. When we evaluate all these factors together, it’s 
possible that CTs and EI levels influence PBs. This study 
aimed to examine the relationships among CTs, EI levels, 
and PBs and to investigate the interactions between these 
variables  in  individuals  with  childhood  trauma.  In  this 
context, the hypotheses of our study are as follows:

H1: EI levels and PBs differ according to CTs.
H2: CTs and EI levels affect PBs.
H3: In those with CT, CTs and EI total levels have an 
effect on PBs.

H4: In those with CT, the CT and EI subscales have 
an effect on PBs.

Method
This  current  research  was  designed  as  a  cross-sectional 
and  correlational  study.  The  study  involved  495  univer-
sity  students  who  applied  in  succession  between  July 
2017  and  June  2018  to  the  Mental  Health  and  Diseases 
outpatient  clinic  of  a  Training  and  Research  Hospital  in 
Istanbul.  G-Power  3.1.9.7  software  was  used  to  conduct 
power analysis to ascertain the bare minimum of partici-
pants needed for the analysis of the study data [24]. This 
software  (multiple  regression  option)  determined  that 
at least 295 participants were necessary for the analysis, 
taking  into  account  seven  factors  (gender,  age,  income, 
department, class, region of residence, and place of resi-
dence), with a 5% chance of error, 80% power, and enough 
statistical  strength  to  look  at  the  relationships  between 
these factors. The study sample was composed of univer-
sity  students  who  consented  to  participate  and  did  not 
have  chronic  physical  and  mental  illnesses,  mental  dis-
orders, or alcohol and substance use disorders using the 
convenience sampling method. Those who did not partic-
ipate in the study voluntarily, pregnant and breastfeeding 
women,  and  those  with  chronic  physical  and  mental  ill-
nesses, alcohol and substance use disorders, and mental 
disorders were excluded from the study.

Participants’  adherence  to  the  inclusion  and  exclu-
sion  criteria  was  assessed  post-interview  by  a  psychia-
trist  in  accordance  with  the  diagnostic  standards  of  the 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
Fifth  Edition  (DSM-5).  The  sociodemographic  data 
form, Childhood Trauma Scale (CTS), BarOn Emotional 
Intelligence  Scale  (EIS),  and  Personality  Beliefs  Ques-
tionnaire-Short  Form  (PBQ-SF)  were  administered  to 
the  participants  who  consented  to  the  study.  Forty-nine 
participants who responded “I strongly disagree” to item 
88 of the EI scale and 59 participants who filled out the 
forms incompletely were excluded from the study. Thus, 
the study included 387 participants. Figure 1 presents the 
research model.

Ethics

All  participants  were  enlightened  about  the  procedures 
and objectives of the study, and written informed consent 
was  obtained  from  each.  Ethical  approval  was  procured 
from  the  İstanbul  Haydarpaşa  Education  and  Research 
Hospital  Clinical  Research  Ethics  Committee  before  the 
study  (Ethical  Approval  No:  12.06.2017/487).  The  study 
was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  the 
1964 Helsinki Declaration. Ethical guidelines determined 
by institutional and national research organizations were 
followed during the study.

Data collection tools
Sociodemographic data form

This  is  a  form  created  by  the  researcher  based  on  the 
features  of  the  study.  It  is  used  to  record  the  sociode-
mographic and clinical traits of individuals, such as gen-
der, age, income, department, class, region, and place of 
residence.

Childhood Trauma Scale (CTS)

This scale, developed by Bernstein et al. in 1994, is a five-
point  Likert-type  scale  consisting  of  28  questions  [25]. 
It measures five types of CTs: physical abuse (PA), emo-
tional  abuse  (EA),  sexual  abuse  (SA),  emotional  neglect 
(EN),  and  physical  neglect  (PN).  After  reading  each 
question,  participants  choose  a  number  from  1  (never) 
to  5  (very  often)  that  best  reflects  their  experience.  The 
scale  can  help  assess  individuals  with  CTs  and  identify 
instances  of  trauma. The  validity  and  reliability  study  of 
the  scale  in  Turkish  was  conducted  by  Şar  et  al.  (2012) 
[26].  A  cut-off  point  of  5  points  has  been  suggested  for 
SA and PA, 7 points for PN and EA, and 12 points for EN 
[26], and these cut-off points were used in this study. In 
the  original  study,  Cronbach’s  alpha  values  ranged  from 
0.79  to  0.94.  The  current  study  revealed  that  the  sub-
dimensions  had  Cronbach’s  alpha  internal  consistency 
coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.87.

Personality beliefs Questionnaire-Short form (PBQ-SF)

The  scale,  created  by  Beck  and  others  in  1991  for  diag-
nosing  certain  PDs,  includes  statements  designed  to 
find  out  what  a  person  believes  about  themselves,  other 
people, and the world, based on psychological theory and 
clinical  observations  [27].  Every  item  on  the  scale  per-
tains to attitudes and beliefs associated with the paranoid, 
schizoid,  antisocial,  borderline,  narcissistic,  histrionic, 
dependent, obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and passive-
aggressive PDs as delineated in the DSM. The scale con-
sists of 65 items and is a five-point Likert-type scale. The 
borderline PD subscale, which was not included in previ-
ous studies, was added to the scale by creating common 
items  derived  from  other  subscales  [3].  The  abbreviated 
version  of  the  scale  was  created  by  Butler  et  al.  (2007) 
[28].  Participants  evaluate  each  statement  by  indicating 
its  relevance  to  them  from  zero  (I  do  not  believe  at  all) 
to  four  (I  completely  believe).  The  scale  is  applicable  in 
both the evaluation and therapy of individuals with PDs. 
Taymur  et  al.  (2011)  conducted  the  Turkish  validity  and 
reliability  study  for  the  short  Turkish  form  of  the  scale, 
which was created by selecting questions from the Turk-
ish long form, as in the original short scale [29]. The test 
assessment  omitted  items  64  and  65  and  lacked  a  cut-
off  threshold.  The  test  is  scored  by  adding  the  weighted 
score  of  the  participant’s  responses  to  each  subtest. The 
Turkish validity and reliability study of the short form of 

the scale with the borderline PD subscale was conducted 
by Bilge and Bilge (2019) [30]. While the total Cronbach 
reliability coefficient of the scale was 0.92, the reliability 
coefficients of the subscales ranged from 0.61 to 0.85. The 
test-retest study revealed correlation coefficients ranging 
from 0.66 to 0.87.

Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS)

The  scale  developed  by  Bar-On  (1997)  was  adapted  to 
Turkish by Acar (2001) [31, 32]. This scale is a five-point 
Likert-type  scale  that  includes  87  items.  The  ratings  are 
as follows: 1: I completely agree, 2: I agree, 3: I am unde-
cided,  4:  I  disagree,  and  5:  I  completely  disagree.  The 
questionnaires  of  those  who  answered  “I  strongly  dis-
agree” to the statement “I answered the above statements 
sincerely and accurately” in the 88th item of the scale are 
not  evaluated. The  scale  assesses  five  sub-dimensions  of 
EI: personal skills, interpersonal skills, adaptability, stress 
management,  and  general  mood.  Personal  skills  refer 
to the individual’s ability to understand and be aware of 
their  feelings  and  thoughts;  interpersonal  skills  refer  to 
the ability to understand and be mindful of others’ feel-
ings  and  emotions;  adaptation  refers  to  the  ability  to  be 
flexible and change their emotions according to changing 
conditions;  stress  management  refers  to  the  individual’s 
ability  to  cope  with  stress  and  control  their  emotions; 
and general mood refers to the ability to express, feel, and 
be  optimistic  about  positive  emotions.  Elevated  scores 
derived  from  the  overall  scale  and  its  subdimensions 
indicate an elevated level of EI. The total Cronbach reli-
ability coefficient of the scale was 0.92.

Determination of childhood trauma survivors

Participants were evaluated according to their CTS sub-
scale scores. It is suggested that giving 5 points to PA and 
SA, 7 points to PN and EA, and 12 points to EN can be 
considered  as  positive  reports  of  CT  [26].  Accordingly, 
those with at least one subscale score above the specified 
threshold  values    were  determined  as  those  who  experi-
enced  childhood  trauma  (CT  (+)),  and  those  with  each 
subscale  score  below  the  specified  values    were  deter-
mined as those who did not experience childhood trauma 
(CT  (-)).  According  to  these  evaluations,  participants 
were  divided  into  two  groups:  those  who  experienced 
childhood  trauma  (CT  (+),  n = 180)  and  those  who  did 
not experience childhood trauma (CT (-), n = 207).

Data analysis

Statistical  analyses  were  carried  out  using  SPSS  (ver. 
22.0,  Chicago,  IL,  USA)  software.  The  obtained  data 
were  moved  to  the  computer  environment.  Number, 
percentage,  mean  value,  and  standard  deviation  were 
used to describe the data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
was  used  to  examine  whether  the  data  showed  normal 

Maden BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:993 Page 5 of 18

distribution,  and  with  the  help  of  this,  it  was  chosen  to 
analyze  the  scale  scores  using  parametric  tests  due  to 
their normal distribution. The independent sample t-test 
was used to compare the scale scores of the sample group, 
while the associations between the scale scores were ana-
lyzed  using  the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient.  Multiple 
regression analysis was performed to determine the pre-
dictive  power  of  the  relationships  among  the  total  and 
sub-dimensions  of  childhood  traumas  (CTs),  emotional 
intelligence (EI), and personality behaviors (PBs). In sta-
tistical  interpretations,  p < 0.05  values    were  accepted  as 
significant at the 95% confidence interval.

Results
When  the  sociodemographic  traits  of  the  university 
students  were  examined,  it  was  determined  that  91.0% 
(n = 352)  were  male,  46.3%  (n = 179)  were  in  the  20–21 
age  group,  87.9%  (n = 340)  were  studying  in  engineer-
ing  faculties  (electrical-electronics,  computer,  machin-
ery,  mechatronics,  environment,  forestry,  etc.),  the 
others  were  studying  in  health  sciences  faculties  (nurs-
ing,  anesthesia,  medical  imaging,  laboratory,  etc.),  and 
79.6%  (n = 308)  had  a  middle  income  (Table  1).  Regard-
ing  sociodemographic  variables,  there  was  no  statisti-
cally  significant  difference  between  CT  (+)  and  CT  (-) 
(p > 0.05).

The students’ CTS, EIS, and PBQ-SF total and subscale 
scores are given in Table 2. In CT (+), paranoid, schizoid,

S.D.:Standard Deviation, t: Independent Sample t test value.

antisocial,  borderline,  narcissistic,  histrionic,  depen-
dent,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive  PBs  and  EI  total 
and  subscale  mean  scores  were  statistically  significantly 
higher (p < 0.05) than in CT (-). Based on the independent 
sample t-test results, the H1 hypothesis was accepted.

According  to  the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient,  the 
links  between  the  variables  in  the  research  model  are 
presented in Fig. 2. A statistically significant relationship 
was  found  between  the  participants’  mean  age  and  the 
mean  scores  of  schizoid  (r=−0.100,  p = 0.049),  antisocial 
(r=−0.168,  p = 0.001),  narcissistic  (r=−0.104,  p = 0.041), 
histrionic  (r = 0.107,  p = 0.035),  and  passive-aggressive 
(r = 0.109,  p = 0.033)  PBs.  There  was  no  significant  link 
between  the  participants’  mean  age  and  paranoid,  bor-
derline,  dependent,  obsessive-compulsive,  and  avoidant 
PBs  (p > 0.05),  while  there  were  statistically  significant 
relationships  between  the  mean  scores  of  CTs  and  the 
mean  scores  of  paranoid  (r = 0.124,  p = 0.015),  schizoid 
(r = 0.107,  p = 0.035),  antisocial  (r = 0.112,  p = 0.028), 
borderline  (r = 0.109,  p = 0.032),  narcissistic  (r = 0.104, 
p = 0.042),  histrionic  (r = 0.124,  p = 0.014),  dependent 
(r = 0.201,  p < 0.001),  and  passive-aggressive  (r = 0.157, 
p = 0.002)  PBs.  There  was  no  statistically  significant 
relationship  between  the  mean  scores  of  CTs  and  the 
mean  scores  of  obsessive-compulsive  and  avoidant  PBs 
(p > 0.05).  A  statistically  significant  relationship  was 
found between EI levels and the mean scores for paranoid 
(r = 0.206, p < 0.001), schizoid (r = 0.228, p < 0.001), antiso-
cial  (r = 0.158,  p = 0.002),  borderline  (r = 0.259,  p < 0.001), 
narcissistic  (r = 0.179,  p < 0.001),  histrionic  (r = 0.214, 
p < 0.001),  dependent 
(r = 0.412,  p < 0.001),  avoidant 
(r = 0.380,  p < 0.001),  and  passive-aggressive  (r = 0.387, 
p < 0.001) PBs. There was no statistically significant rela-
tionship  found  between  EI  levels  and  age  and  the  mean 
scores of obsessive-compulsive PBs (p > 0.05). There was 
a  statistically  significant  link  between  CTs  and  EI  levels 
(r = 0.350, p < 0.001) (Table 3).

In  CT  (+),  a  statistically  significant  correlation  was 
found  between  the  mean  scores  of  CTs  and  the  mean 
scores of dependent PBs (r = 0.157, p = 0.036). There was 
no  statistically  significant  link  found  between  the  mean 
scores of CTs and the mean scores of other PBs (p > 0.05). 
Statistically significant relationships were found between 
EI and the mean scores of paranoid (r = 0.218, p = 0.003), 
schizoid 
(r = 0.181, 
(r = 0.167,  p = 0.025),  antisocial 
p = 0.015),  borderline  (r = 0.281,  p < 0.001),  narcissis-
tic  (r = 0.234,  p < 0.001),  histrionic  (r = 0.226,  p = 0.002), 
dependent 
(r = 0.403, 
(r = 0.348,  p < 0.001),  avoidant 
p < 0.001),  and  passive-aggressive  (r = 0.322,  p < 0.001) 
PBs.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  correlation 
found  between  age  and  the  mean  scores  of  obsessive-
compulsive PBs (p > 0.05). There was a statistically signifi-
cant link between CTs and EI levels (r = 0.303, p < 0.001) 
Table 4.

Based  on  the  findings  of  multiple  regression  analysis, 
the  participants’  CTs  and  EI  total  scores  and  paranoid 
PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.213,  R2 = 0.045,  p < 0.001), 
schizoid  PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.230,  R2 = 0.053,

R2 = 0.029,  p = 0.004),  borderline  PBs  were  at  a  moder-
ate  level  (R = 0.260,  R2 = 0.067,  p = 0.001),  narcissistic 
PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.185,  R2 = 0.034,  p = 0.001), 
histrionic  PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.220,  R2 = 0.049, 
p < 0.001),  and  dependent  PBs  were  at  a  mode  rate  level 
(R = 0.416, R2 = 0.034, p = 0.001), and avoidant PBs were at 
a moderate level (R = 0.386, R2 = 0.149, p < 0.001), and pas-
sive-aggressive  PBs  were  at  a  moderate  level  (R = 0.387, 
R2 = 0.150,  p < 0.001),  and  showed  a  significant  relation-
ship.  CTs  and  EI  levels  explained  4.5%  of  the  change  in 
paranoid  PBs,  5.3%  of  the  change  in  schizoid  PBs,  2.9% 
of  the  change  in  antisocial  PBs,  6.7%  of  the  change  in 
borderline  PBs,  3.4%  of  the  change  in  narcissistic  PBs, 
4.9% of the change in histrionic PBs, 17.3% of the change 
in  dependent  PBs,  14.9%  of  the  change  in  avoidant  PBs, 
and 15.0% of the change in passive-aggressive PBs. When 
the  regression  coefficients  were  examined,  total  EI  lev-
els  were  found  to  be  a  significant  predictor  of  paranoid, 
schizoid,  antisocial,  borderline,  narcissistic,  histrionic, 
dependent,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive  personality 
traits.  Total  levels  of  CT  and  EI  did  not  predict  obses-
sive-compulsive  PBs  (p > 0.05)  (Table  5).  According  to 
the  results  of  the  multiple  regression  analysis,  the  H2 
hypothesis was accepted.

In  CT  (+),  total  scores  of  CT  and  EI  and  paranoid 
PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.218,  R2 = 0.047,  p = 0.014), 
antisocial  PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.183,  R2 = 0.033, 
p = 0.049),  borderline  PBs  were  at  a  low  level  (R = 0.283, 
R2 = 0.080, p = 0.001), narcissistic PBs were at a low level 
(R = 0.234,  R2 = 0.055,  p = 0.007),  histrionic  PBs  were  at  a 
low level (R = 0.226, R2 = 0.051, p = 0.010), dependent PBs 
were at a moderate level (R = 0.352, R2 = 0.124, p < 0.001), 
avoidant  PBs  were  at  a  moderate 
level  (R = 0.418, 
R2 = 0.174,  p < 0.001),  and  passive-aggressive  PBs  were 
at  a  moderate  level  (R = 0.324,  R2 = 0.104,  p < 0.001)  and 
showed a significant relationship. Total levels of CT and 
EI  explained  4.7%  of  the  variance  in  paranoid  PBs,  3.3% 
of the variance in antisocial PBs, 8.0% of the variance in 
borderline  PBs,  5.5%  of  the  variance  in  narcissistic  PBs, 

5.1% of the variance in histrionic PBs, 12.4% of the vari-
ance in dependent PBs, 17.4% of the variance in avoidant 
PBs, and 10.4% of the variance in passive-aggressive PBs. 
Total levels of EI were found to be a significant predictor 
of paranoid, antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, histrionic, 
dependent,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive  PBs,  while 
the total levels of CT and EI did not predict schizoid and 
obsessive  PBs  (p > 0.05)  (Table  6).  Based  on  the  findings 
of  multiple  regression  analysis,  the  H3  hypothesis  was 
accepted.

In  CT  (+),  CT  subscales  and  EI  subscales  showed 
a  moderate  and  significant  relationship  with  border-
line  PBs  (R = 0.327,  R2 = 0.107,  p = 0.033),  histrionic 
PBs  (R = 0.366,  R2 = 0.134,  p = 0.006),  dependent  PBs 
(R = 0.433,  R2 = 0.188,  p < 0.001),  avoidant  PBs  (R = 0.497, 
R2 = 0.247,  p < 0.001), 
and  passive-aggressive  PBs 
(R = 0.392,  R2 = 0.154,  p < 0.001).  Subscales  of  CT  and  EI 
explained 10.7% of the variance in borderline PBs, 13.4% 
of the variance in histrionic PBs, 18.8% of the variance in 
dependent  PBs,  24.7%  of  the  variance  in  avoidant  PBs, 
and  15.4%  of  the  variance  in  passive-aggressive  PBs.  It 
was seen that stress management, one of the EI subscales, 
was  a  significant  predictor  of  borderline,  histrionic, 
avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive  PBs,  while  adaptability 
was  a  significant  predictor  of  dependent  PBs  (Table  7). 
Based on the findings of the multiple regression analysis, 
the H4 hypothesis was accepted.

Discussion
This  study  examined  the  effects  of  CTs  and  EI  levels  on 
PBs.  EI  levels  and  PBs  were  compared  according  to  CT 
status.  At  the  same  time,  it  evaluated  the  effects  of  CTs 
and  EI  levels  on  each  PB.  According  to  our  literature 
knowledge, this study was the first study to evaluate the 
effects of CTs and EI levels on PBs.

One of the results of this study was that, with the excep-
tion of obsessive-compulsive personality beliefs, levels of 
paranoid,  schizoid,  antisocial,  borderline,  narcissistic, 
histrionic,  dependent,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive

personality beliefs were higher in CT (+) than in CT (-). 
Recent  studies  indicate  that  CTs  are  linked  to  paranoid, 
schizoid,  borderline,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive 
PBs [4–6]. CTs negatively affect personality development 
[15, 16] and cause the development of PDs in adulthood 
[18, 20]. According to cognitive theory, the more a patho-
logical belief cluster is adopted, the more likely it is to be 
seen in that PD and related behaviors [33]. These findings 
emphasize that CTs may be effective in the development 
of PBs.

Another result of this study is that EI levels are higher 
in  CT  (+)  than  in  CT  (-).  A  study  involving  university 
students  revealed  that  individuals  without  unpleasant 
childhood  experiences  exhibited  elevated  levels  of  emo-
tional  intelligence  (EI)  [34].  In  contrast  to  these  results, 
a  study  conducted  in  India  found  that  those  who  expe-
rienced  severe  CT  had  higher  levels  of  EI  and  empathy 
than  those  who  experienced  low  or  moderate  levels  of 
CT [11]. These results of the study explain that childhood 
traumatic experiences have a positive effect on the devel-
opment of EI.

Negative  significant  relationships  were  found  between 
the ages of the participants and schizoid, antisocial, nar-
cissistic, histrionic, and passive-aggressive PBs. In a study 
conducted on a group of employees and their families in 
a  public  institution,  significant  differences  were  found 
between  the  age  groups  with  avoidant,  obsessive-com-
pulsive,  histrionic,  schizoid,  and  paranoid  PBs  [35].  PDs 
are  more  common  in  young  adults  compared  to  older 
adults, whereas medical problems, cognitive decline, and 
changes  in  behavioral  patterns  over  time  in  older  adults 
affect  the  diagnostic  accuracy  of  PDs  [36,  37].  These 
results are an indication that there may be changes in PBs 
with increasing age.

Childhood  traumas  and  EI  levels  were  found  to  have 
positive  significant  relationships  with  PBs.  In  a  study 
conducted with 409 participants, it was reported that SA 
was  linked  to  paranoid,  schizoid,  borderline,  and  avoid-
ant  PDs;  PA  was  associated  with  antisocial  PD;  EA  was 
associated  with  paranoid,  schizotypal,  borderline,  and 
cluster  C  PDs;  and  EN  was  associated  with  histrionic 
and borderline PDs [18]. It can be stated that CTs and EI 
levels  have  a  positive  effect  on  the  development  of  PBs 
related to PDs.

In  CT  (+),  significant  relationships  were  observed 
between  CTs  and  dependent  PBs.  Recent  research  sug-
gests  that  childhood  maltreatment  may  significantly 
contribute  to  the  formation  of  narcissistic  personality 
structures  [19]  and  that  childhood  SA  is  the  strongest 
predictor  of  histrionic  personality  pathology  in  adult-
hood [20]. Similarly, CTs can cause psychological effects 
such  as  decreased  self-esteem  in  individuals  during 
adulthood,  developing  a  dependent  personality,  nega-
tive  self-evaluation  and  feeling  worthless,  disorder  in 

introversion, 

personal  relationships, 
incompatibility, 
anxiety, fatigue, and insecurity [38–40]. These traumatic 
experiences  can  cause  individuals  to  believe  that  they 
will  be  unsuccessful  in  adulthood,  will  not  be  able  to 
adapt in interpersonal relationships, and therefore will be 
unhappy.

A  substantial  and  meaningful  correlation  has  been 
identified  between  CTs  and  EI  levels.  In  a  study  con-
ducted  on  adults  aged  20–30,  a  negative  relationship 
was  found  between  CTs  and  EI  levels  [41].  Süslü  (2020) 
examined  the  effects  of  CTs  on  the  EI,  Life  satisfaction, 
and  interpersonal  communication  style  of  individuals 
aged  20–45  [42].  According  to  research  findings,  it  is 
stated that as individuals’ reports of CT increase, their EI 
scores decrease. Another study conducted with a sample 
of 227 young female participants from Croatia and Bos-
nia-Herzegovina  showed  that  individuals  who  had  trau-
matic experiences in their early lives were more likely to 
develop borderline PD symptoms and had lower levels of 
emotion regulation and empathy [43]. These study ’find-
ings  contradicted  the  findings  in  the  literature.  These 
results  indicate  that  the  fact  that  the  participants  were 
university students and their coping skills with stressors 
improved may have been effective in developing positive 
PBs by overcoming the negative effects of CTs. However, 
these results need to be confirmed in future studies.

According  to  the  multiple  regression  results,  it  was 
determined  that  the  participants’  global  CTs  did  not 
predict  their  PBs.  The  reasons  why  CTs  do  not  predict 
PBs may be that the possible post-traumatic growth that 
develops with CTs [44, 45] and individual factors may act 
as a protective factor against personality pathologies and 
dysfunctional PBs. The trigger required for the develop-
ment  of  post-traumatic  growth  is  the  perceived  threat 
related to the trauma. In the face of this threat, individu-
als  often  change  their  personal  belief  systems  and  the 
meaning  of  the  trauma  to  fit  their  new  or  restructured 
personal views and assumptions about life and the world 
[46].  According  to  the  post-traumatic  growth  model  of 
McElherance et al. (2012), it has been stated that children 
exposed to SA may exhibit post-traumatic growth [47]. In 
addition, it has been stated that girls exposed to SA may 
be  more  prone  to  post-traumatic  growth.  In  line  with 
these  findings,  these  protective  factors  may  prevent  the 
emergence of PBs by reducing the development of PDs.

Another finding of the study is that total EI levels pre-
dict  PBs.  A  study  conducted  with  university  students 
indicated that as EI levels increase, the personality traits 
of  extraversion,  agreeableness,  conscientiousness,  and 
openness to experience increase, while neuroticism levels 
decrease [48]. Another study conducted with individuals 
with  psychopathic  personality  traits  indicated  that  high 
psychopathic levels are associated with low EI levels [49]. 
Individuals  with  personality  problems  tend  to  have  low

EI levels, which may lead to the development of negative 
personality  traits.  On  the  contrary,  it  is  explained  that 
PBs develop positively in individuals with high EI levels. 
Moreover,  individuals  who  are  aware  of  their  emotions 
can  control  their  behaviors  and  have  positive  thoughts 
and beliefs.

In CT (+), EI levels predicted PBs other than schizoid 
and  obsessive-compulsive  personality  traits.  However, 
CTs did not predict PBs. The reason for this is that there 
is no relationship between CTs and PBs in CT (+). Schiz-
oid  individuals  have  a  limited  ability  to  feel,  distinguish, 
and  show  their  emotions.  They  experience  feelings  of 
loneliness  due  to  loss  of  emotion;  obsessive-compulsive 
individuals  are  unemotional,  critical,  and  judgmental  in 
their  interpersonal  relationships  [50].  It  is  obvious  that 
EI  characteristics  are  not  sufficiently  developed  in  indi-
viduals  with  schizoid  and  obsessive-compulsive  person-
ality  traits  and  that  they  are  not  aware  of  their  own  or 
others’  emotions.  Individuals  with  paranoid,  antisocial, 
borderline, histrionic, dependent, avoidant, and passive-
aggressive  personality  traits  may  differ  from  individuals 
with schizoid and obsessive-compulsive personality traits 
in terms of their EI levels, as they are aware of both their 
own and others’ emotions, whether positive or negative. 
Having  experienced  childhood  trauma  may  cause  these 

emotions to be revealed more, whether positive or nega-
tive, and the development of these PBs. However, there is 
a need for relational studies on this subject.

Another  result  of  our  study  is  that  in  CT  (+),  the  EI 
subscales  of  stress  management  predict  borderline,  his-
trionic,  avoidant,  and  passive-aggressive  PBs,  while 
adaptability predicts dependent PBs. The two main char-
acteristics  of  borderline  PD  are  instability/inconsistency 
and  impulsivity.  Sudden  mood  swings  or  violent  out-
bursts  can  be  seen  in  these  individuals  with  histrionic 
PD,  which  is  characterized  by  excessive  emotionality, 
attention-seeking,  seductive  or  provocative  behaviors, 
sudden  and  shallow  emotions,  and  using  appearance 
to  attract  attention  [51].  They  have  variable  emotions, 
tend  to  get  angry  easily,  and  have  difficulty  concentrat-
ing  [52].  Individuals  with  avoidant  PD  have  negative 
beliefs  about  themselves,  others,  and  unwanted  emo-
tional  experiences.  These  individuals  also  see  their  dys-
phoric  emotions  as  unbearable  and  avoid  situations  and 
environments that make them uncomfortable, as well as 
thinking about things that make them uncomfortable [2]. 
Individuals with passive-aggressive PBs hold external fac-
tors and other people responsible for the events that hap-
pen to them due to their aggressive feelings [53].

Emotional  intelligence  consists  of  stress  management, 
stress  tolerance,  and  impulse  control  skills.  In  people 
who  have  experienced  childhood  trauma,  high  levels  of 
stress  management  can  positively  affect  borderline  and 
histrionic personality beliefs through impulsivity control 
and  avoidant  and  passive-aggressive  personality  beliefs 
through stress tolerance.

Emotional  intelligence  adaptability  encompasses  the 
capacity  to  acknowledge  one’s  emotions,  acclimate  to 
one’s  feelings,  ideas,  and  behaviors  in  varying  circum-
stances,  and  recognize  issues  while  devising  effective 
remedies.  Individuals  with  dependent  PBs  need  others 
intensely  for  their  lives.  These  individuals  have  overde-
veloped help-seeking, trusting others, and people-pleas-
ing  behaviors,  while  self-expression,  self-confidence, 
and  healthy  separation  behaviors  are  underdeveloped 
[2].  A  high  level  of  EI  adaptability  may  affect  the  beliefs 
of  individuals  with  dependent  personality  traits  about 
having their feelings validated by others, exhibiting peo-
ple-pleasing behaviors, trusting others rather than them-
selves, and being accepted by them.

This research possesses considerable limitations. First, 
this research evaluates the CTs of university students. It 
is  not  known  whether  the  participants  had  other  trau-
matic  experiences  such  as  natural  disasters,  serious  ill-
nesses,  accidents,  etc.  In  addition,  researchers  do  not 
know  when  the  participants’  childhood  traumas  first 
occurred or whether the traumatic events are still ongo-
ing, and the time factor may also affect the study’s results. 
Future  research  can  include  studies  on  childhood  trau-
matic  experiences  and  time  factors  of  other  traumatic 
experiences  to  generalize  the  findings.  Secondly,  we 
designed this study using a cross-sectional design. It does 
not  compare  the  dynamic  change  trajectories  of  CT,  EI 
levels,  and  PBs  of  university  students.  Third,  only  one 
assessment method (i.e., PBQ-SF) was used to assess PBs. 
This  scale  was  designed  to  address  dysfunctional  beliefs 
associated  with  a  range  of  PDs.  This  method  does  not 
assess  dysfunctional  beliefs  related  to  schizotypal  PD. 
We should encourage future researchers to employ mul-
tifaceted  approaches  to  PBs,  such  as  self-report,  semis-
tructured  diagnostic  interviews,  and  clinical  interviews. 
In  addition,  methods  to  assess  schizotypal  PBs  should 
be  developed,  and  studies  should  be  conducted  within 
these  methods.  Fourth,  nonclinical  participants  were 
university-based,  and  the  majority  were  male  students. 
The results may not be representative of the larger popu-
lation. Future research should assess whether these find-
ings  can  be  replicated  in  a  clinical  setting  and  ensure  a 
balanced distribution of participants in terms of gender. 
Finally,  there  may  be  a  bias  in  the  compilation  of  the 
questionnaire  used  to  assess  early  trauma.  Given  these 
limitations,  we  need  to  conduct  future  studies  using 
a  longitudinal,  multi-method  design  to  examine  the 

effects  of  CT  exposure  on  both  EI  and  PBs.  Addition-
ally, it would be important to analyze different groups to 
see if there are variations in the types of CT experienced 
and how acceptable they are, as well as to investigate the 
impact  of  delayed  trauma  and  the  development  of  EI  in 
future studies.

This  research  possesses  multiple  strengths.  To  our 
knowledge,  this  research  was  the  first  to  evaluate  the 
effects  of  CTs  and  EI  levels  on  PBs.  This  enriched  the 
studies  in  the  field  of  psychological  trauma.  It  showed 
that EI levels have a positive effect on PBs in CT (+). This 
study  provided  several  clinical  implications  for  clinical 
psychological intervention. For those working on trauma, 
changing  the  individual  cognitions  of  clients  and  devel-
oping EI levels to help individuals evaluate the effects of 
their traumatic experiences may be beneficial in psycho-
therapeutic  interventions  targeting  dysfunctional  PBs. 
The  fact  that  this  study  was  not  conducted  on  a  clinical 
sample  can  also  be  considered  a  strength  of  the  study. 
The  evaluation  of  different  personality  pathologies  in  a 
non-clinical  sample  and  the  dimensional  nature  of  per-
sonality  disorders  increase  the  generalizability  of  the 
study results [54].

Conclusion
The  findings  obtained  in  this  study  show  that  there  is  a 
significant association between CTs and EI levels in indi-
viduals. CTs and EI affect the PBs of university students. 
At the same time, the EI of CT (+) affects their PBs. Con-
trary  to  expectations,  CTs  are  positively  associated  with 
EI  and  PBs.  In  other  words,  CTs  increase  EI  levels  and 
enhance the development of positive PBs.

The  results  of  this  study  hold  significant  significance 
for  mental  health  practitioners,  educators,  and  policy-
makers. Given the significant impact of CT on PBs, early 
intervention  programs  should  focus  on  promoting  per-
sonality  belief  relationships  in  children  who  have  expe-
rienced  trauma.  Schools  and  community  organizations 
can  combine  EI  training  programs  to  help  young  adults 
develop  better  emotional  regulation  skills,  which  can 
reduce the long-term effects of CTs. Additionally, mental 
health professionals should integrate EI-based and emo-
tion-focused interventions when working with individu-
als  with  trauma  histories.  Therapy  approaches  such  as 
dialectical behavior therapy and trauma-informed cogni-
tive-behavioral therapy may be useful in both improving 
EI and relational functioning in trauma survivors.

The  research  results  are  valid  for  students  who  apply 
to  the  clinic  within  the  scope  of  the  research.  Differ-
ent  results  may  be  obtained  in  other  samples  and  clini-
cal studies to be selected. However, it was evaluated that 
this  study  is  important  because  it  statistically  explains 
the  relationships  between  CTs,  EI,  and  PBs  within  a 

Maden BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:993 model and that it may offer certain perspectives to future 
researchers working in this field.

Although  this  study  did  not  examine  gender  differ-
ences, future research could investigate how CTs affect EI 
and  PBs  differently  between  men  and  women.  Longitu-
dinal  studies  could  provide  more  information  about  the 
long-term effects of CTs on emotional and relational out-
comes at different life stages.

In  conclusion,  this  study  provides  valuable  contribu-
tions  to  the  understanding  of  how  childhood  trauma 
and emotional intelligence affect personality beliefs. The 
findings  emphasize  that  although  childhood  trauma  sig-
nificantly  affects  emotional  intelligence,  the  effects  of 
childhood trauma types are only minimal on dependent 
personality  beliefs.  This  suggests  that  emotional  intelli-
gence plays a vital role in emotional well-being and that 
personality  beliefs  can  be  improved  through  targeted 
interventions.
