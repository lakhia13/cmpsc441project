Abstract
Background  Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex and severe mental health condition often 
accompanied by several co-occurring clinical problems. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most 
common co-occurring disorders, with prevalence rates of PTSD reported to be between 25% and 58% among 
persons with BPD. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the association of a PTSD diagnosis and 
different forms of childhood trauma with changes in BPD severity, PTSD severity, and frequency of suicidal behaviors 
among suicidal individuals with BPD undergoing 12-months of standard dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).

Methods  This was a secondary data analysis that included individuals with BPD (N = 120) in the 12-month DBT 
condition. Participants completed measures of childhood abuse, PTSD severity, BPD severity, and frequency of suicidal 
behaviors at baseline as well as at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to 
examine both study hypotheses.

Results  Results suggested that the presence of PTSD did not predict reduced rates of reduction in BPD severity, 
PTSD severity, or frequency of suicidal behaviors. Results also revealed that higher severity of childhood sexual and 
emotional abuse was associated with quicker reductions in BPD severity, whereas higher severity of childhood 
physical abuse was associated with slower reductions. Similarly, higher severity of emotional abuse was associated 
with quicker reductions in PTSD severity, while higher severity of physical abuse was associated with slower 
reductions in this outcome.

Conclusions  Standard DBT appears to be comparably effective for both individuals with BPD without PTSD 
and BPD + PTSD. The addition of a PTSD diagnosis did not significantly predict slower recovery among those 
with BPD + PTSD. In addition, different forms of childhood trauma significantly affect the trajectories of individual

Background
Co-Occurring borderline personality disorder and 
posttraumatic stress disorder

Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  complex, 
severe,  and  persistent  mental  health  condition  [1].  An 
estimated 75–95% of individuals with BPD have engaged 
in self-directed violence (i.e., suicide attempts [SA], non-
suicidal  self-injury  [NSSI]),  often  necessitating  hospital-
ization  and  medical  interventions  [1,  2].  Furthermore, 
approximately 91% of individuals with BPD have at least 
one  co-occurring  mental  health  condition  [3].  Among 
these, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the 
most  common  and  debilitating  co-occurring  disorders 
[4]. PTSD is estimated to present among 25–58% of indi-
viduals with BPD [4, 5]. Those with both diagnoses (BPD 
+ PTSD) exhibit poorer quality of life, higher rates of co-
occurring  disorders,  and  higher  prevalence  of  repeated 
childhood  trauma  [6]  when  compared  to  PTSD  or  BPD 
alone.

Notably,  individuals  with  BPD  +  PTSD  have  an  even 
higher  risk  of  engaging  in  suicidal  behaviors  than  those 
with  either  BPD  or  PTSD  alone  [7].  Findings  suggest 
that those with BPD + PTSD have a greater likelihood of 
lifetime suicide attempts (SA) [6] as well as a higher rate 
of  SA  when  compared  to  individuals  with  BPD  without 
PTSD (e.g., 79.5% vs. 66.8%) [8]. Other studies have sim-
ilarly  found  that  individuals  with  BPD  +  PTSD  have  an 
increased  risk  of  suicide,  higher  levels  of  impulsiveness, 
and a greater number of hospitalizations than those with 
either BPD or PTSD alone [9]. 

PTSD as predictor of outcomes in DBT

Dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT)  [10]  is  the  most 
empirically supported and widely practiced intervention 
for individuals with BPD [11]. A handful of studies have 
examined  whether  a  co-occurring  PTSD  diagnosis  is 
associated  with  outcomes  in  DBT  and  other  empirically 
supported  treatments  for  BPD,  including  generalized 
psychiatric  management  (GPM)  [12]  and  mentaliza-
tion-based  therapy  (MBT)  [13].  Some  data  suggest  that, 
over the course of treatment (DBT and GPM) and post-
treatment follow-up, the frequency of suicidal behaviors 
and severity of BPD among those with BPD + PTSD are 
comparable to those with BPD without PTSD [14]. Other 
findings,  however,  have  suggested  that  co-occurring 
PTSD  is  associated  with  significantly  less  reduction  in 

NSSI during DBT [4]. Barnicot and Crawford found that, 
among those with BPD + PTSD undergoing either MBT 
or  DBT,  heightened  severity  and  chronicity  of  PTSD  at 
baseline  predicted  higher  frequency  of  self-harm  (i.e., 
NSSI,  SA),  less  likelihood  of  abstaining  from  self-harm 
during  treatment,  and  greater  self-reported  BPD  sever-
ity  [7].  Furthermore,  Harned  and  colleagues  found 
that  suicidal  individuals  with  BPD  who  were  receiving 
12-months  of  DBT  showed  lower  rates  of  remission  of 
PTSD  (i.e.,  34.8%),  compared  with  mood  (i.e.,  67.6%), 
eating  (i.e.,  63.6%),  and/or  substance  use  disorders  (i.e., 
87.5%)  [5].  Taken  together,  these  findings  suggest  that 
the  presence  of  PTSD  may  be  associated  with  weaker 
treatment  response,  increased  emotion  dysregulation, 
and  a  slower  trajectory  of  change  in  suicidal  behaviors 
and  severity  of  BPD;  however,  given  the  inconsistencies 
among  previous  findings,  it  remains  unclear  how  the 
presence of PTSD impacts DBT outcomes, as measured 
by symptom severity and self-harming behaviors.

Childhood trauma in BPD

In  addition  to  the  above-noted  gaps,  very  few  studies 
have examined the association between different types of 
childhood  trauma  and  treatment  outcomes  among  per-
sons with BPD. Childhood trauma could include physical, 
sexual,  and  emotional  abuse,  neglect,  and  other  adverse 
childhood  experiences.  Findings  suggest  that  between 
81 and 91% of individuals with BPD report some form of 
childhood  trauma,  including  physical  (44–59%),  sexual 
(18–27%), or emotional abuse (66–73%) [15, 16]. Impor-
tantly,  studies  of  childhood  trauma  can  be  limited  by 
recall  bias  and/or  difficulty  accurately  assessing  differ-
ent trauma experiences; as well, historically, some stress-
ors that may not qualify as Criterion A events for PTSD 
(e.g.,  emotional  abuse),  have  not  been  as  consistently 
researched.

Several  studies  suggest  that  the  presence  of  co-occur-
ring  BPD  +  PTSD  is  associated  with  heightened  preva-
lence  and  severity  of  childhood  trauma,  complicating 
the  clinical  picture  of  this  group  and  potentially  leading 
to  difficulty  improving  in  treatment.  Indeed,  individu-
als  with  BPD  +  PTSD  experience  a  higher  total  number 
of  traumatic  childhood  events  than  those  with  either 
BPD  or  PTSD  alone  [6,  17,  18].  In  a  study  comparing 
rates of childhood physical, sexual, and emotional abuse 
between  individuals  with  BPD  only,  PTSD  only,  or  BPD 

Christensen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2025) 12:47 Page 3 of 13

+ PTSD, those with BPD + PTSD experienced the high-
est  rates  of  childhood  trauma  compared  to  either  dis-
order  alone  (i.e.,  50.8%,  35.4%,  and  81.5%  for  childhood 
physical,  sexual,  and  emotional  abuse,  respectively)  [9]. 
Further,  those  with  BPD  +  PTSD  are  exposed  to  child-
hood  trauma  at  significantly  younger  ages  than  those 
with PTSD only [19], and experience more types of child-
hood  trauma  (e.g.,  estimates  of  3.32  abuse  types)  than 
those with either BPD (e.g., estimates of 2.02 abuse types) 
or  PTSD  alone  (e.g.,  estimates  of  2.96  abuse  types)  [9]. 
Notably,  extant  data  also  suggest  that  childhood  sexual 
abuse, more so than other forms of abuse, may uniquely 
account for greater clinical impairment among individu-
als  with  BPD  +  PTSD.  For  instance,  among  those  with 
BPD + PTSD, childhood sexual abuse is associated with 
more  severe  clinical  presentations,  poorer  prognoses, 
lower remission rates of PTSD, lower health-related qual-
ity  of  life,  and  higher  rates  of  suicidality  and  NSSI  than 
other  forms  of  childhood  trauma  [20–22].  As  well,  ten-
year data from the McLean Study of Adult Development 
(MSAD)  showed  that,  among  those  with  BPD  +  PTSD, 
both the presence and severity of childhood sexual abuse 
predicted time-to-remission from PTSD such that those 
reporting childhood sexual abuse were only half as likely 
to experience remission from PTSD and, for each 5-point 
increase  in  childhood  sexual  abuse  severity,  the  likeli-
hood  of  remission  from  PTSD  decreased  by  21%  over 
the course of 10 years [22]. This suggests that those with 
childhood sexual abuse may experience heightened levels 
of emotion dysregulation, which could account for their 
differential treatment responses.

Taken  together,  these  findings  highlight  the  central 
role of childhood abuse in shaping both BPD and PTSD 
as  well  as  their  frequent  co-occurrence.  While  child-
hood  neglect  is  undoubtedly  harmful,  its  associations 
with  BPD,  PTSD,  and  NSSI  +  SA  tend  to  be  less  direct 
and  more  diffuse  [23,  24].  This  pattern  underscores  the 
importance  of  prioritizing  abuse  variables  in  studies  of 
cooccurring  BPD  +  PTSD,  while  also  acknowledging 
that  neglect  remains  an  important  dimension  for  future 
research.

Childhood trauma as a predictor of outcomes in DBT

Although  extant  literature  suggest  that  the  impact  of 
childhood  trauma  may  explain  variability  in  treatment 
responses  and  remission  rates  among  this  group,  very 
few studies have begun to examine how different forms of 
childhood trauma might impact the course of treatment 
for  individuals  with  BPD  with  or  without  co-occurring 
PTSD.  Previous  research  has  identified  that  different 
types  and  severities  of  childhood  trauma  predicts  dif-
ferential  treatment  outcomes  among  individuals  with 
BPD  undergoing  schema  therapy,  transference-focused 
psychotherapy  (TFP),  MBT,  and/or  DBT  [25–27].  For 

example,  Keefe  and  colleagues  found  that  DBT  was  a 
better  fit  than  GPM  for  individuals  with  higher  sever-
ity  of  emotional  abuse,  more  dependent  personality 
traits,  higher  social  maladjustment,  and  higher  severity 
of  depression  [27].  However,  despite  DBT’s  established 
efficacy  for  BPD  [28,  29]  as  well  as  emerging  evidence 
suggesting  various  treatment  moderators,  there  is  a  sig-
nificant dearth of research that has examined the moder-
ating role of specific forms of childhood trauma in DBT 
outcomes, despite its significant association with BPD.

Notably,  Euler  and  colleagues  recently  examined 
whether  childhood  sexual  abuse,  emotional  abuse  and 
neglect,  and  physical  abuse  and  neglect  predicted  out-
comes in a 4-week, shortened version of DBT (i.e., inten-
sive DBT [I-DBT]) [30]. I-DBT is an intensive outpatient 
program which follows the DBT framework and includes 
several  hours  of  individual  and  group  therapy  per  week 
[30].  In  this  study,  physical  neglect  was  associated  with 
smaller reductions in depression severity while emotional 
neglect was associated with greater reductions in depres-
sion  severity.  Euler  and  colleagues  hypothesized  that 
once  those  with  histories  of  emotional  neglect  received 
attention  and  care  during  their  treatment  course,  their 
depression improved, while those with histories of physi-
cal  neglect  may  not  have  been  as  sensitive  to  emotional 
support.  Finally,  higher  global  severity  of  childhood 
trauma  was  associated  with  greater  decreases  in  impul-
sivity  [30].  Therefore,  there  is  some  indication  that  cer-
tain  forms  of  childhood  trauma  may  affect  severities  of 
depression and impulsivity in DBT; however, findings are 
limited and mixed with respect to how and which types 
of  childhood  trauma  might  account  for  these  findings, 
especially  within  a  population  of  individuals  with  co-
occurring BPD and PTSD.

Current study

For the present study, we aimed to examine the associa-
tions  between  a  co-occurring  PTSD  diagnosis  and  dif-
ferent  forms  of  childhood  trauma  with  changes  in  BPD 
severity, PTSD severity, and frequency of suicidal behav-
iors (i.e., NSSI + SA) among self-harming individuals with 
BPD  undergoing  12-months  of  standard  DBT.  Based  on 
extant research on co-occurring BPD and PTSD evidence 
that  childhood  abuse  is  more  directly  associated  with 
PTSD  severity,  BPD  severity  and  NSSI + SA,  whereas 
neglect  tends  to  exert  broader  and  less  specific  effects 
[23,  24],  we  opted  to  examine  childhood  sexual,  physi-
cal,  and  emotional  abuse,  rather  physical  and  emotional 
neglect in our present analyses.

Given  research  suggesting  that  emotion  dysregulation 
among  those  with  PTSD  and  childhood  sexual  trauma 
is  a  potential  mechanism  to  explain  differential  treat-
ment  outcomes,  we  hypothesized  that,  when  compared 
to those with BPD without PTSD, the presence of PTSD 

Christensen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2025) 12:47 would  be  associated  with  a  reduced  rate  of  reduction 
in  BPD  severity,  PTSD  severity,  and  the  frequency  of 
NSSI + SA throughout the course of DBT (Hypothesis 1). 
We also hypothesized that a history of childhood sexual 
abuse  would  reduce  the rate of reduction  in  BPD sever-
ity, PTSD severity, and the frequency of NSSI + SA among 
individuals with BPD, when controlling for other forms of 
abuse (Hypothesis 2). Indeed, evaluating the moderating 
effects that childhood sexual abuse has on BPD severity, 
PTSD  severity,  and  frequency  of  NSSI + SA  among  indi-
viduals  with  BPD + PTSD  may  better  inform  for  whom 
DBT  treatment  may  be  best  and  least  suited  and  direct 
future intervention efforts for this population.

Method

This  study  was  a  secondary  data  analysis  from  a  multi-
site,  single-blind,  two-arm  randomized  clinical  trial  that 
compared  the  clinical  efficacy  and  cost-effectiveness  of 
6-month standard DBT to 12-month standard DBT [31, 
32].  Given  that  the  primary  hypotheses  of  the  current 
study  were  to  examine  the  unique  impact  that  different 
forms of childhood trauma have on standard DBT among 
those with BPD, only data from the 12-month condition 
were used.

Participants

In the parent trial, 240 participants were recruited from 
two  sites:  The  Centre  for  Addiction  and  Mental  Health 
(CAMH;  Toronto,  Ontario)  and  Simon  Fraser  Univer-
sity (SFU; Burnaby, British Columbia). See McMain et al. 
[31]  for  full  details  of  study  protocol.  Participants  were 
recruited  from  clinic  waitlists,  via  advertisements,  and 
by personal referrals. If eligible, participants were subse-
quently randomized to one of two treatment conditions. 
For the proposed study, only data from participants ran-
domized to the 12-month DBT condition (N = 120) were

included.  Forty-two  (35%)  of  the  120  individuals  in  our 
sample were considered treatment dropouts (i.e., missed 
four consecutive therapy sessions).

The  age  of  the  sample  ranged  from  18  to  56  years  old 
(M = 27.26; SD = 8.67), and 79.22% of participants (n = 95) 
identified as female, 14.20% of participants (n = 17) iden-
tified as male, and 6.70% of participants (n = 8) identified 
as  other.  Given  that  GEE  utilizes  the  highest  number  of 
participants in any timepoint that were assessed, Hypoth-
esis 1 included n = 118 and Hypothesis 2 included n = 105. 
See  Table  1  for  an  estimate  of  current  and  lifetime  co-
occurring disorders in the 12-month sample.

Inclusion criteria

Individuals were deemed eligible for the study if they met 
the following criteria: (1) between 18 and 60 years of age; 
(2)  met  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual-IV  (DSM-IV) 
criteria  for  BPD;  (3)  displayed  recent  suicidal  behaviors 
(i.e., two episodes of NSSI or SA in the past 5 years, with 
at least one episode in the past 8 weeks); (4) spoke Eng-
lish proficiently; and (5) had health insurance in the past 
year in British Columbia or Ontario.

Exclusion criteria

Individuals were excluded from the study for the follow-
ing reasons: (1) met DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic dis-
order,  bipolar  I  disorder,  or  dementia;  (2)  demonstrated 
an  IQ  ≤   70;  (3)  had  received  8+  weeks  of  DBT  within 
the last year; or (4) had plans to move out of Canada dur-
ing the study trial.

Procedure
Intervention

DBT  consisted  of  the  comprehensive  treatment  model, 
including  the  following  four  components:  (1)  weekly, 
60-minute  individual  therapy  sessions  aimed  at  increas-
ing  motivation  to  stay  in  treatment;  (2)  weekly,  2-hour 
DBT  skills  training  groups,  which  included  opportuni-
ties  to  learn  skills  related  to  mindfulness,  interpersonal 
effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance; 
(3) as-needed phone coaching on a 24/7-basis to support 
skill  implementation;  and  (4)  weekly  therapist  consulta-
tion  meetings  to  enhance  protocol  adherence  and  pro-
vide  therapist  support.  Individuals  who  missed  four  or 
more  consecutive  sessions  were  considered  treatment 
dropouts.

Therapists

Therapists  had  either  a  master’s  or  doctoral  degree  and 
had  at  least  2  years  of  experience  treating  patients  with 
BPD  and  receiving  supervision  in  DBT.  Adherence  to 
DBT  treatment  was  measured  via  the  University  of 
Washington  DBT  Adherence  Coding  Scale  [33]  by  12 
independent raters. A random selection of 336 individual 

Christensen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2025) 12:47 sessions  and  62  group  sessions  indicated  that  overall 
adherence  was  good  (DBT-12  individual  therapy  M[SD] 
=  4.15[0.21]).  Scores  ≥  4  are  considered  “adherent”  to 
DBT  on  the  University  of  Washington  DBT  Adherence 
Coding Scale.

Measures

In  the  larger  parent  trials,  participants  were  assessed 
at  the  following  intervals  throughout  the  course  of  the 
study:  baseline,  3,  6,  9,  and  12  months  into  treatment; 
and 15, 18, 21, and 24 months after treatment. Given that 
the primary aim of this study was to examine the impact 
of PTSD and childhood trauma over the course of DBT, 
outcomes  were  examined  throughout  the  treatment 
phase only (i.e., baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12-months).

Assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria

The  International  Personality  Disorder  Examination  – 
BPD  Module  (IPDE-BPD)  [34]  was  used  to  assess  BPD 
diagnosis.  The  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  the 
DSM-IV, Axis I (SCID-I) [35] was administered to evalu-
ate  for  the  presence  of  what  were  previously  known  as 
“Axis  I”  disorders.  The  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for 
the  DSM-IV,  Axis  II  (SCID-II)  [36]  was  administered  to 
evaluate for the presence of what were previously known 
as “Axis II” disorders. The Wechsler Test of Adult Read-
ing (WTAR) [37] was used to assess participants’ cogni-
tive functioning at the time of the study.

Predictor variables

PTSD  Diagnosis.  Participants  were  classified  as 
BPD + PTSD if they met criteria for a PTSD diagnosis on 
the SCID-I, which comprehensively assesses for the pres-
ence of current and lifetime PTSD symptoms, including 
the presence of a Criterion A traumatic event (i.e., expo-
sure  to  an  event  which  actual  or  threatened  death,  seri-
ous injury, or sexual violence).

Childhood  Abuse  Types.  To  assess  individuals’  experi-
ence  with  and  severity  of  childhood  trauma,  the  Child 
Trauma Questionnaire – Short Form (CTQ-SF) [38] was 
administered. For the current study, the Physical Abuse, 
Sexual  Abuse,  and  Emotional  Abuse  subscales  were 
included  in  the  statistical  analyses  given  their  stronger 
reliability  than  the  Neglect  subscales  [38].  The  CTQ-SF 
has demonstrated good criterion validity and high mea-
surement invariance across 4 diverse samples [38] as well 
as a good convergent validity with the Childhood Experi-
ences Questionnaire-Revised (CEQ-R) [39] among a clin-
ical sample of Danish individuals [39]. The CTQ-SF was 
administered at the 3-month time point given that it was 
designed to measure historical childhood trauma as well 
as to minimize participant fatigue at baseline.

Outcome measures

Total  NSSI  +  SA.  To  measure  the  total  frequency  of 
NSSI + SA throughout the course of treatment, the Sui-
cide Attempt and Self-Injury Interview (SASII) [40] was 
administered to participants every 3 months. The SASII 
demonstrates  high  interrater  reliability  with  intraclass 
correlations  (ICCs)  ranging  from  0.87  to  0.98.  Finally, 
convergent  validity  has  been  established  by  comparing 
data  from  the  SASII  to  a  variety  of  alternative  data  col-
lection  methods  (i.e.,  therapist  notes,  participant  diary 
cards,  and  medical  records)  [40].  The  internal  consis-
tency of the SASII for the current study’s sample was  α  
= 0.77.

BPD  Severity.  The  Borderline  Symptom  Checklist- 
23  (BSL-23)  [41]  was  administered  every  3  months  to 
monitor  the  severity  of  BPD  over  the  course  of  treat-
ment.  Bohus  and  colleagues  also  found  that  the  BSL-23 
had  moderate  to  high  convergent  validity  with  the  Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI; r = 0.83–0.87) and the global 
severity  index  of  the  Revised  Symptom  Checklist-90 
(SCL-90-R;  r=  0.48–0.89)  [42–44].  The  internal  consis-
tency of the BSL-23 for the current study’s sample was  α  
= 0.92.

PTSD  Severity. The  PTSD  Checklist  for  DSM-5  (PCL-
5) [45, 46] was administered every 3 months to monitor 
the  severity  of  PTSD  over  the  course  of  treatment.  The 
PCL-5 demonstrated convergent validity with the PTSD 
Checklist  (PCL;  r=  85)  [47],  the  Posttraumatic  Stress 
Diagnostic  Scale  (PDS;  r=  0.85)  [48],  and  the  Detailed 
Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS; r= 0.84) [49]. 
Furthermore,  the  PCL-5  demonstrated  discriminant

and Antisocial Personality Features (r = 0.39) subscales of 
the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) [46, 50]. The 
internal consistency of the PCL-5 for the current study’s 
sample was  α  = 0.92.

Data analytic plan

Data  was  analyzed  using  the  Statistical  Package  for  the 
Social Sciences 28 (SPSS 28) [51] with an intent-to-treat 
(ITT)  approach.  Given  the  dependencies  in  participant 
data over time, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) 
[52] was used to examine both study hypotheses, i.e., the 
moderating impact of (1) co-occurring PTSD and (2) dif-
ferent forms of childhood trauma on standard DBT out-
comes among a sample of individuals with BPD. GEE is a 
semi-parametric  derivation  of  generalized  linear  model-
ing (GLM) that indicates how the average of an outcome 
variable  changes  with  covariates  while  accommodating 
for repeated measures of the same participant over time. 
It  is  based  on  the  quasi-likelihood  theory  and  does  not 
make  assumptions  about  the  distributions  of  partici-
pant  responses  over  time. Thus,  GEE  can  accommodate 
skewed and non-normal data distributions. Further, GEE

retains  participants  with  missing  data  by  estimating  the 
working  correlation  and  using  the  all  available  pairs 
method (i.e., all non-missing pairs of data are used to esti-
mate the working correlation parameters) for maximum 
statistical power. The data in the current analysis met the 
aforementioned assumptions of GEE.

Furthermore,  the  quasi-likelihood  under  the  indepen-
dence  model  criterion  (QIC)  [53]  was  used  to  select  the 
preferred correlation structure and best fitting  model in 
each  GEE  analyses.  Unstructured,  autoregressive,  and 
exchangeable  covariance  structures  were  considered  for 
each GEE analysis. Covariance structures that evidenced 
the  lowest  QIC  value  were  retained  and  interpreted.  Of 
note,  GEE  only  requires  one  timepoint  per  participant 
to estimate the rest of their scores across time (i.e., the n 
used in the analyses is the highest number of participants 
at any timepoint that were assessed). For the full sample, 
the highest number of participant scores was n = 118.

To 

test  Hypothesis  1,  Diagnostic  Status 
(i.e., 
BPD + PTSD  vs.  BPD  without  PTSD)  and  Time  in  treat-
ment  were  entered  as  predictors.  Two-way  interactions 
between  Diagnostic  Status  (BPD + PTSD  or  BPD  with-
out  PTSD) × Time  were  entered  to  test  the  moderating 
effects  of  a  diagnosis  of  BPD + PTSD  on  BSL-23  total 
score,  PCL-5  total  score,  and  total  NSSI + SA  frequency 
throughout  pre-  to  post-treatment.  To  test  Hypothesis 
2,  Mean  Physical  Abuse,  Sexual  Abuse  and  Emotional 
Abuse CTQ scores, and Time in treatment were entered 
as  predictors.  Two-way  interactions  between  Physical 
Abuse × Time,  Sexual  Abuse × Time,  and  Emotional 
Abuse × Time were entered to test the moderating effects 
of  each  form  of  childhood  abuse  on  total  BSL-23  score, 
PCL-5  score,  and  total  NSSI + SA  frequency  throughout 
pre-  to  post-treatment.  In  this  study,  Time  was  consid-
ered a categorical variable.

Discussion
Individuals with BPD + PTSD have poorer treatment out-
comes when compared to those with other co-occurring 
disorders  with  BPD  [7].  Childhood  trauma,  commonly 
associated  with  both  BPD  [15]  and  PTSD  [54],  may 
also  explain  variability  in  clinical  outcomes  among  this 
uniquely  complex  population.  This  study  was  designed 
to  further  enhance  scientific  and  clinical  understanding 
of the influence of PTSD and childhood trauma on DBT 
outcomes by clarifying the specific impact a PTSD diag-
nosis  and  different  forms  of  childhood  trauma  have  on 
changes  in  BPD  severity,  PTSD  severity,  and  frequency 
of  NSSI  +  SA  among  a  sample  of  individuals  with  BPD 
undergoing 12 months of standard DBT.

In  contrast  to  our  hypotheses,  results  revealed  that 
there  were  no  significant  differences  in  changes  in  our 
clinical  outcomes  (i.e.,  BPD  severity,  PTSD  severity, 
NSSI + SA)  between  individuals  with  BPD + PTSD  and 
those  with  BPD  without  PTSD.  As  well,  in  contrast  to 
our  hypotheses,  severity  of  childhood  sexual  and  emo-
tional abuse predicted quicker rates of reduction in BPD 
and PTSD severity, while the severity of childhood physi-
cal abuse predicted slower rates of reduction in BPD and 
PTSD severity.

The effect of PTSD on change in clinical outcomes

 [18],Our finding that the presence of PTSD did not pre-
dict reduced rates of reduction in our outcomes suggests 
that  there  may  not  be  a  meaningful  difference  between 
the  benefit  achieved  by  those  with  BPD  without  PTSD 
and those with BPD + PTSD undergoing standard DBT. 

Christensen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2025) 12:47 Page 8 of 13

Although  both  groups  exhibited  reductions  in  our  out-
comes, there was not a significant difference in the rates 
of  reduction  between  the  two  groups.  To  date,  much  of 
the literature focuses on the adverse effect that co-occur-
ring PTSD has on treatment outcomes. Indeed, consistent 
with the current study’s hypothesis, various studies sug-
gest  that  individuals  with  co-occurring  BPD  and  PTSD 
demonstrate impaired outcomes when compared to their 
BPD-only counterparts [4, 18, 55]. While our hypothesis 
is  largely  consistent  with  much  of  the  literature  to  date, 
the lack of support for our hypothesis could possibly be 
due  to  differences  in  sample  characteristics,  assessment 
tools, and/or methodological approaches across multiple 
studies. Indeed, while the current study included individ-
uals  with  recent  and  chronic  NSSI  +  SA  as  well  as  who 
fully met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BPD [30], many 
previous studies have smaller sample sizes [4, 5, 18, 56], 
limited to no requirements for active NSSI + SA [4, 56], 
and  outdated  and/or  less  rigorous  diagnostic  methods 
[9]. Thus, it is possible that these studies may not specifi-
cally capture the clinical presentations of individuals with 
co-occurring  BPD  and  PTSD  as  conceptualized  in  the 
current study.

However,  consistent  with  current  findings,  other 
research  has  suggested  that  the  presence  of  PTSD  does 
not  have  an  adverse  effect  on  certain  psychodiagnostic 
outcomes  among  those  with  BPD  in  DBT,  GPM,  MBT, 
or residential treatment with a combination of DBT, TFP, 
and MBT [7, 14, 57]. It is possible that these studies align 
with  present  findings  due  to  largely  consistent  method-
ological  approaches  among  assessment  measures  and 
outcome data as well as similar sample characteristics.

Furthermore,  our  findings  are  derived  from  a  clinical 
sample  of  individuals  with  recent  and  chronic  suicidal 
behaviors. It is possible that among individuals with BPD 
with recent NSSI + SA, the additional “load” of co-occur-
ring  PTSD  did  not  further  increase  the  already  elevated 
clinical  severity  of  the  sample.  While  there  is  evidence 
that  more  persistent  and  severe  types  of  PTSD  predict 
poorer  outcomes  on  BPD  severity,  substance  use,  and 
self-harm frequency [7, 17, 18], the evaluation of specific 
subgroups of PTSD was outside the scope of the current 
study. Thus, it is possible that the additional diagnosis of 
PTSD did not have a large impact on the treatment out-
comes examined in the current study.

The effect of childhood trauma on change in clinical 
outcomes

Interestingly,  findings  from  our  second  aim  were  also 
inconsistent  with  our  hypotheses,  which  predicted  that 
childhood sexual abuse would predict a reduced the rate 
of reduction in our outcomes, when controlling for other 
forms of abuse. Rather, higher levels of childhood sexual 
and emotional abuse significantly predicted quicker rates 

of reduction in BPD severity, while higher levels of child-
hood physical abuse predicted a slower rate of reduction 
in  BPD  severity  over  the  course  of  DBT.  Consistently, 
higher levels of childhood emotional abuse similarly pre-
dicted a quicker rate of reduction in PTSD severity, while 
higher  levels  of  childhood  physical  abuse  predicted  a 
reduced  rate  of  reduction.  It  is  possible  that,  since  DBT 
focuses  on  the  invalidating  rearing  environment,  sexual 
and emotional abuse were more directly addressed than 
physical abuse.

Notably,  while  different  forms  of  childhood  trauma 
tend to co-occur, our findings suggest that different types 
of  abuse  predict  distinctive  treatment  outcomes.  Inter-
estingly,  childhood  physical  and  sexual  abuse  –  both 
consisting  of  acts  of  physical  violence  toward  a  child  – 
predicted  different  trajectories  of  change;  it  is  possible 
that these differential outcomes are due to differences in 
how  childhood  physical  and  sexual  abuse  are  measured 
on  the  CTQ-SF  [38].  For  example,  each  of  the  Physi-
cal  Abuse  items  on  the  CTQ-SF  inquires  about  physi-
cal  violence  perpetrated  by  a  family  member  (e.g.,  I  got 
hit so hard by someone in my family that it left me with 
bruises  or  marks),  while  all  Sexual  Abuse  items  inquire 
about sexual violence perpetrated by anyone (e.g., Some-
one  tried  to  touch  me  in  a  sexual  way  or  tried  to  make 
me  touch  them).  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  those  with 
caregiver-perpetrated  abuse  (i.e.,  those  with  childhood 
physical abuse in our sample) may have a more complex 
relationship with their trauma, and therefore, experience 
slower rates of improvement in DBT.

For  example,  research  has  found  that  children  with 
caregiver-perpetrated  abuse  tend  to  experience  abuse 
from an earlier age and for a longer duration of time than 
their counterparts with non-caregiver-perpetrated abuse 
[58]. Adding to the sheer complexity of this relationship, 
caregivers  who  abuse  their  children  may  attribute  dif-
ferent  meanings  to  their  abusive  behavior  [59],  thereby 
implicating  multiple  forms  of  abuse  when  directing 
physical  violence  toward  their  own  children.  Therefore, 
in our sample, individuals with childhood physical abuse 
may  have  had  attenuated  treatment  outcomes  given  the 
unique  implications  of  caregiver-perpetrated  childhood 
abuse.

In contrast, childhood sexual abuse predicted an accel-
erated  rate  of  reduction  in  BPD  severity,  but  not  PTSD 
severity, over time. It is possible that, within our sample, 
incidences of childhood sexual abuse are not as strongly 
linked  to  one’s  family  members  given  the  wording  of 
Sexual Abuse items on the CTQ-SF [38]. Perhaps without 
the  unique  complications  that  arise  from  caregiver-per-
petrated  abuse,  those  with  higher  levels  of  sexual  abuse 
may uniquely benefit from DBT (i.e., exhibit faster rates 
of  improvement  in  BPD  severity).  However,  given  that 
childhood  sexual  abuse  has  been  highly  associated  both 

Christensen et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation           (2025) 12:47 with  BPD  [20,  60]  and  PTSD  [54,  61],  it  was  somewhat 
surprising that childhood sexual abuse did not also influ-
ence  changes  in  PTSD  severity  overtime.  Perhaps  these 
findings  are  due  to  differences  in  other  clinical  features 
in this sample that may uniquely impact the trajectory of 
change in BPD severity versus PTSD severity. In addition, 
review  of  the  main  effects  in  Table  6  indicated  that,  in 
our  sample,  higher  baseline  childhood  sexual  abuse  was 
associated with higher BPD severity at baseline. Thus, it 
is  possible  that  the  accelerated  rate  of  improvement  in 
BPD  severity  was  due  to  a  ceiling  effect.  Indeed,  future 
research is needed to clarify and expand upon the factors 
that  affect  the  complex  relationship  between  childhood 
sexual abuse, BPD, and PTSD.

Finally,  childhood  emotional  abuse  significantly  pre-
dicted accelerated rates of improvement in both BPD and 
PTSD  severities  overtime.  Among  individuals  with  BPD 
and  PTSD,  childhood  emotional  abuse  is  a  highly  com-
mon  and  disruptive  experience  [15,  16],  which  is  impli-
cated  in  the  development  of  both  BPD  [10]  and  PTSD 
[62].  While  somewhat  surprising,  these  findings  are 
consistent  with  Linehan’s  [10]  biosocial  theory  of  BPD, 
which  states  that  BPD  is  an  outcome  of  the  combina-
tion  of  persistent  invalidating  experiences  in  childhood 
and  an  individual’s  biological  predisposition  to  develop 
emotion  dysregulation.  Indeed,  emotional  abuse  could 
be  considered  a  more  centralfeature  within  this  invali-
dating  rearing  environment  than  other  forms  of  abuse. 
These findings are also consistent with the threat/depri-
vation  model  [63],  which  posits  that  exposure  to  threat 
(i.e., emotional abuse) is associated with increased emo-
tional reactivity, thereby leading to higher levels of emo-
tion dysregulation. As such, those with emotional abuse 
may have an accelerated treatment response in DBT due 
to  potential  ceiling  effects  of  heightened  levels  of  threat 
in  one’s  environment.  Consistently,  and  as  noted  above 
for  childhood  sexual  abuse,  our  GEE  models  also  sug-
gested that higher levels of emotional abuse were related 
to higher baseline BPD and PTSD severity levels. This too 
may  explain  the  increased  improvement  of  symptoms 
over time as those with higher emotional abuse perhaps 
had more “room” for improvement. Therefore, within this 
model, it is possible that DBT is particularly effective for 
individuals with a history of emotional abuse.

Limitations and future directions

This study was among the first to examine the effects that 
childhood sexual, physical, and emotional abuse have on 
comprehensive  DBT  outcomes  among  a  sample  of  indi-
viduals with BPD. Utilizing a large sample size as well as 
repeated  assessments  across  5  timepoints,  our  findings 
offer  a  robust  look  into  the  ways  that  different  forms  of 
childhood  trauma  can  impact  important  clinical  out-
comes,  specifically,  BPD  severity,  PTSD  severity,  and

ent study addressed many of the limitations found in the 
methodology  of  prior  studies,  it  has  several  limitations 
to  note.  First,  one  methodological  limitation  of  the  cur-
rent study is that its sample is limited in generalizability. 
This sample was comprised of a suicidal, predominantly 
female group of individuals with BPD; therefore, replica-
tion of the present analyses with a larger, more represen-
tative BPD sample in terms of severity and self-reported 
gender is recommended.

Second,  our  analyses  neglected  to  account  for  other 
important  factors  that  could  have  influenced  our  find-
ings.  Since  gender  identity  has  been  associated  with 
clinically  meaningful  differences 
in  BPD  pathology 
between  males  and  females  [64],  accounting  for  gender 
as  a  moderator  when  replicating  data  analyses  is  war-
ranted. Relatedly, our study only controlled for the effect 
that co-occurring PTSD had on DBT outcomes among a 
BPD sample; however, participants within our study had 
several  other  co-occurring  diagnoses  which  were  unac-
counted for. Indeed, recent literature has identified differ-
ential  clinical  profiles  of  co-occurring  diagnoses  among 
BPD individuals with substance use disorders [65], eating 
disorders  [66],  and  bipolar  disorders  [66].  Thus,  future 
research should also delineate the potential role of other 
co-occurring  diagnoses  when  examining  the  effect  that 
co-occurring PTSD has on DBT outcomes. Relatedly, this 
study  did  not  examine  follow-up  periods.  As  such,  it  is 
unclear if treatment effects may have still been observed 
during follow-up phases. Future research should include 
follow-up periods to assess the continued impact of treat-
ment on outcome data.

Finally,  while  childhood  trauma  encompasses  abuse, 
neglect, and exploitation, the current study focused spe-
cifically  on  abuse  (emotional,  physical,  and  sexual). This 
decision was guided by prior research demonstrating that 
CTQ  abuse  subscales  show  stronger  psychometric  reli-
ability  and  clearer  associations  with  clinical  outcomes 
compared to neglect subscales [38, 67]. Recent work also 
highlights  that  abuse  dimensions,  in  particular,  robustly 
predict  trauma-related  psychopathology  [68].  In  addi-
tion, the present sample was only sufficiently powered to 
examine  abuse  variables,  limiting  our  ability  to  test  the 
unique effects of neglect. As such, our findings may not 
capture  the  full  range  of  childhood  trauma  experiences 
that could influence DBT outcomes. Future studies with 
larger  samples  should  expand  these  analyses  to  include 
neglect,  which  will  help  to  provide  a  more  comprehen-
sive  understanding  of  how  different  forms  of  childhood 
trauma shape treatment response and allow for more tai-
lored clinical interventions.

Clinical implications and conclusion

The findings from the current study offer several clinical 
implications. First, standard DBT appears to be compara-
bly effective for both individuals with BPD without PTSD 
and BPD + PTSD. The addition of a PTSD diagnosis did 
not  significantly  predict  slower  recovery  among  those 
with BPD + PTSD. Thus, while adapted DBT treatments 
such as DBT-PTSD [69–71] or DBT-PE [72] have accrued 
support in recent years, our study suggests that perhaps 
standard DBT may remain a viable treatment option for 
individuals  with  BPD  +  PTSD.  Indeed,  standard  DBT 
could be an appropriate alternative for those with BPD + 
PTSD who do not have access to disorder-specific treat-
ments for BPD + PTSD. Nevertheless, findings from this 
study  could  also  be  used  to  inform  adapted  treatments 
such  as  DBT-PTSD  [69–71]  or  DBT-PE  [72];  suggesting 
that  DBT-based  interventions,  with  or  without  adapta-
tions,  are  viable  treatments  for  individuals  with  BPD  + 
PTSD and/or those with emotional abuse or sexual abuse 
histories.

Second,  this  study  highlights  the  importance  of  com-
prehensively assessing for the presence of different types 
of  childhood  abuse,  particularly  when  evaluating  for 
trauma.  Although  PTSD  Criterion  A  events  are  often 
assessed  when  individuals  initially  present  to  treatment, 
other  significant  forms  of  childhood  trauma  (e.g.,  emo-
tional abuse and neglect, physical neglect) may be largely 
overlooked. Findings from our study suggest that, rather 
than  a  PTSD  diagnosis,  it  may  be  that  different  forms 
of  childhood  trauma  specifically  significantly  affect  the 
trajectories  of  individual  treatment.  Of  note,  our  find-
ings suggest that DBT interventions may be particularly 
beneficial for individuals with higher levels of emotional 
abuse.  Taken  together,  understanding  which  forms  of 
childhood  trauma  lead  to  better  or  worse  outcomes 
among  clinical  populations  may  allow  future  interven-
tions  to  become  more  individually  tailored  and  more 
strategically target the factors that significantly affect the 
trajectory of recovery over time.
