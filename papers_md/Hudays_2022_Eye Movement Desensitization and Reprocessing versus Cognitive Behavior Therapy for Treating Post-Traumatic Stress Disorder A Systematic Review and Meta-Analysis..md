Abstract: This meta-analysis review compared eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and
cognitive behavior therapy efﬁcacy in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and
depression symptoms. A systematic search for articles published between 2010 and 2020 was con-
ducted using ﬁve databases. The RevMan software version 5 was used. Out of 671 studies, 8 fulﬁlled
the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Three studies reported that eye move-
ment desensitization and reprocessing reduced depression symptoms better than cognitive behavior
therapy in both children, adolescents, and adults (SDM (95% CI) = −2.43 (−3.93–−0.94), p = 0.001).
In three other studies, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing were shown to reduce anx-
iety in children and adolescents better than cognitive behavior therapy (SDM (95% CI) = −3.99
(−5.47–−2.52), p < 0.001). In terms of reducing PTSD symptoms, eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing and cognitive behavior therapy did not demonstrate any statistically signiﬁcant
differences (SDM (95% CI) = −0.14 (−0.48–0.21), p = 0.44). There was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference at the three-month follow-up and at the six-month follow-up for depression (p = 0.31),
anxiety (p = 0.59), and PTSD (p = 0.55). We recommend randomized trials with larger samples and
longer follow-up times in the future.

1. Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common causes of psycho-
logical disorders around the world. PTSD is deﬁned as the exposure to several negative
factors that affect people’s conditions and mood which could be threatened or experienced
by a traumatic event [1]. The incidence rate of PTSD has been gradually increasing due to
population growth and resulting conﬂicts and the prevalence and distribution of PTSD-
related risk factors [2]. Individuals may be affected by PTSD in their lives due to natural
and human-made events, including natural disasters, accidents, war, sexual assault, and
serious illness [3].

Globally, PTSD affects nearly 4% of the population and is one of the most prevalent
psychological conditions [4]. Few studies compared the incidence rates of traumatic events
between different countries. The 3 countries with the highest rates are the Netherlands,
Colombia, and the United States, whereas Italy, Romania, and Spain had the lowest expo-
sure rates based on a comparison of 16 countries [5]. Moreover, different segments of the

world population are at risk of developing PTSD. For example, female, individuals lacking
social support, and the youth at exposure time have a high risk of developing PTSD [2]. A
survey conducted in the United States on males and females aged between 16 and 76 years
showed that more than 60% of the males experienced a traumatic event and more than 50%
of the females were exposed to a traumatic event [6].

Patients with PTSD may suffer from other disorders’ symptoms. For example, co-
morbidity between PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and nearly
half of PTSD patients also have a diagnosis of MDD [7]. In case PTSD and MDD co-occur,
the same treatment plan provided for patients with PTSD could also help those with both
disorders. PTSD patients could also have major distress disorder in response to a traumatic
exposure [7]. Thus, a similar treatment strategy would be applied. Another important fac-
tor affecting post-traumatic symptoms’ adaption is self-efﬁcacy. Post-traumatic symptoms
may have a negative impact on self-efﬁcacy, but self-efﬁcacy may ease recovery from these
symptoms over time [8].

Intentional and non-intentional traumas have been documented to have different
impacts on the prevalence levels of PTSD. The prevalence of PTSD increased over time
following an intentional traumatic event, whereas it decreased over time following a non-
intentional traumatic event [9]. Further, the experience of trauma-related disorders during
childhood not only inﬂuences one’s direct functioning but can have a long-term impact [10].
Traumatic symptoms resolve over time without any intervention in approximately 60% of
individuals [9]. Thus, in case PTSD has evolved in those individuals, different psychological
interventions such as self-help with support, counselling, psychoeducation, or selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used [11]. However, the most recommended
psychological interventions are eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) [11].

EMDR treatment is one of the psychological treatments and has been debated about
its efﬁcacy for treating PTSD patients [12,13]. In the last decade, several trials have been
conducted on this therapy and have been showing promising outcomes, though they
are yet to be generalized. EMDR is a psychotherapy technique that is experimentally
established for medical use to address the consequences of psychological trauma and
other unpleasant life experiences. It enables patients to process distressing memories and
replace them with new adaptive ones by focusing on past memories, present disturbances,
and future actions [14]. EMDR can be performed by an expert therapist through using
professional approaches, such as hand-tapping and audio simulation which aim to help
patients to remember the worst moment of the trauma, and then treat it in subsequent
sessions. This treatment is performed in eight phases [15], in which the patient continues
to engage until the memory no longer distresses him or her. These phases are: (1) taking
history and treatment planning, (2) preparing and explaining the treatment, (3) preparing
the memory for the target, (4) memory desensitization, (5) teaching the patient a relevant
positive belief, (6) identifying and processing residual disturbances related to the target,
(7) ending the course session, and (8) re-assessing the patient to ensure he or she will be
stable throughout the treatment and stay on track to meet his/her goals. Compared with
pharmacological treatment, EMDR has much fewer side effects, is safer, and is widely
regarded as a cost-effective and practical PTSD treatment [16,17].

CBT offers a fuller understanding of the processes that impact one’s emotional state
by focusing on the cognitive individuals’ processes [18,19]. It is a psychological treatment
that mainly use trauma-focused cognitive, behavioral, or cognitive-behavioral practices
and exposure approaches to therapy [19]. The consequential advantage of this therapy is
that results are visible quickly due to the effectiveness of the treatment. During extensive
sessions, therapists do their best to understand the problem and adequately develop
solutions. CBT also helps offer patients new insights into the world around them by
helping them gain a deeper understanding of what they perceive around them. Such
behavior therapy helps focus on the patient’s thoughts [19]. Recently, there have been
many new forms of CBT developed for treating PTSD, including prolonged exposure (PE),

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16836

3 of 17

brief eclectic psychotherapy, and cognitive restructuring [20]. The American Psychological
Association strongly recommends PE in its professional practice guidelines for PTSD
treatment. CBT has been proven as an effective treatment to reduce the negative thoughts
associated with PTSD [21] because it addresses patients’ memories, thoughts, or feelings
related to traumatic events [22]. Both EMDR and CBT include exposure and cognitive
components. However, a main characteristic of EMDR is that patients are instructed to
move their eyes quickly while concentrating on the distressing memory until the level of
distress lessens. Patients also perform a relaxation exercise to help visualize a safe place
and characteristics of the trauma and change negative ideas with positive thoughts. In
CBT, the exposure intervention focuses on play or artistic expression instead of a formal
written narrative [10].

Individuals with PTSD can also suffer from other psychological disorders such as
anxiety and depression. Due to the increasing number of people who suffer from PTSD,
effective treatments are desperately needed. Since no evidence is available about the
efﬁcacy of a speciﬁc treatment for both intentional and non-intentional traumas, EMDR
and CBT remained the best treatment options for certain PTSD patients [11]. However, the
efﬁcacy of EMDR in PTSD treatment has been investigated in fewer numbers of trials [12].
Limited research also supported CBT to reduce the negative impacts of PTSD. Further, there
is little research comparing EMDR with CBT for PTSD treatment. The effectiveness of both
EMDR and CBT needs further conﬁrmation to provide the best possible evidence. To our
knowledge, no prior systematic reviews have focused on the signiﬁcance of different PTSD
symptoms’ treatments among individuals at different ages. Therefore, this meta-analysis
review aimed to compare EMDR and CBT efﬁcacy in reducing post-traumatic, anxiety,
and depression symptoms among patients with PTSD. We also aimed to compare the
cost-effectiveness and safety of both treatments to provide helpful knowledge on some
factors related to both treatments.

Main Question

The main question of this review is: How effective is EMDR compared to CBT in

treating post-traumatic, anxiety, and depression symptoms among patients with PTSD?

2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy

An electronic database search occurred using the following databases: Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, PsychINFO, Global Health via
OvidSP (1910–present), and Scopus. The keywords included: “PTSD patients”, “traumatic
events”, “post-traumatic stress symptoms”, “Eye movement desensitization reprocessing”,
“Cognitive behavior therapy”, “treating PTSD symptoms”, and “reducing anxiety, stress, de-
pression symptoms”. To combine the search terms or keywords, Boolean operators “AND”
and “OR” were used. Incorporating the two operators and using different search terms
led to a focused search that generated relevant journals according to the research question.
A search limit was also applied to produce the appropriate studies through the applica-
tion of ﬁlters. As a method of ﬁnding relevant, scholarly, and peer-reviewed studies, the
ﬁlters included studies published between January 2010 and December 2020 for obtaining
up-to-date evidence. Journal articles were selected by establishing eligibility criteria.

2.2. Selection of Studies

The inclusion criteria for the studies were that they should be: (a) focused on children,
adolescents, and adults, (b) studies that stated a PTSD diagnosis, (c) studies that used
reliable and valid measures, (d) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EMDR and
CBT, (e) written in the English language, and (f) published between 2010 and 2020. Due
to the capacity to identify causation and lack of bias, RCTs are the focus of this review. In
the current review, only English publications were included, which can be construed as
bias [21]. Nevertheless, most Gulf health publications which are related to mental illnesses

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16836

4 of 17

and psychological therapies are published in English. A timeframe of ten years was judged
sufﬁcient to incorporate signiﬁcant publications and recent research. Studies were excluded
if their focus was on: (a) other treatments for PTSD symptoms, (b) descriptive articles,
(c) books, (d) opinion articles, and (e) unrelated language.

2.3. Search Outcomes

Using the aforementioned databases, a total of 671 articles were identiﬁed, which
were then selected based upon the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) ﬂow diagram [23]. Searching for grey literature and snowballing
occurred to ﬁnd any missing papers. As a ﬁrst step, all relevant records were gathered from
the ﬁve databases. After gathering all the records, the selection process began by eliminating
duplicates from the databases using EndNote X9 software. As a result, 79 duplicate articles
were identiﬁed. Afterward, non-relevant articles were removed after the initial review of
titles and abstracts. There were 53 full articles remaining, but 45 were excluded because
they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, eight articles were included in this
review and can be seen in the PRISMA diagram below (Figure 1).

for studies.

2.4. Quality Assessment

A quality assessment determines with precision the value of evidence and whether
it should be used in practice. Using critical appraisal tools provides researchers with the
ability to apply their knowledge to practice. Systematic reviews are used to review and
summarize the ﬁndings of the scientiﬁc evidence [23], although they cannot be assumed to
be equally valuable regardless of how the study was conducted. In assessing the quality of
the selected primary studies, the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used [24]. Since
this tool provides transparency to the evaluation of biases in internal and external validity,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, x 4 of 15   reliable and valid measures, (d) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EMDR and CBT, (e) written in the English language, and (f) published between 2010 and 2020. Due to the capacity to identify causation and lack of bias, RCTs are the focus of this review. In the current review, only English publications were included, which can be construed as bias [21]. Nevertheless, most Gulf health publications which are related to mental ill-nesses and psychological therapies are published in English. A timeframe of ten years was judged sufficient to incorporate significant publications and recent research. Studies were excluded if their focus was on: (a) other treatments for PTSD symptoms, (b) descriptive articles, (c) books, (d) opinion articles, and (e) unrelated language. 2.3. Search Outcomes Using the aforementioned databases, a total of 671 articles were identified, which were then selected based upon the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram [23]. Searching for grey literature and snowball-ing occurred to find any missing papers. As a first step, all relevant records were gathered from the five databases. After gathering all the records, the selection process began by eliminating duplicates from the databases using EndNote X9 software. As a result, 79 du-plicate articles were identified. Afterward, non-relevant articles were removed after the initial review of titles and abstracts. There were 53 full articles remaining, but 45 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, eight articles were included in this review and can be seen in the PRISMA diagram below (Figure 1).  Figure 1.

it was chosen for evaluating the eight RCTs. Due to the paucity of primary studies on this
topic, none of the studies included in this review were excluded from the review based on
a poor methodology, such as small sample sizes or insecure randomization.

2.5. Studies’ Appraisal

An appraisal has been performed for the included studies [3,25–31]. The aim was
to evaluate the potential sources of bias of the studies included. The modiﬁed Cochrane
tool measures the quality of different domains: selection, performance, detection, attrition,
and reporting biases [24]. According to the severity of risk for each domain, bias will be
assessed as ‘low risk’, ‘high risk’, or ‘unclear risk’. Only four studies gave an adequate
description of how the randomization process was secured and carried out in terms of
the randomization domain, which consists of two aspects: random sequence generation
and allocation concealment [3,27,28,30]. The blinding of participants was not applied
because of the kinds of interventions used, while the blinding of personnel was applied in
four RCTs [25,27,30,31]. However, in all RCTs, the outcome assessors had been blinded to
overcome the problem of detection bias.

Risk of attribution bias was not observed in any RCT due to adequate descriptions of
how the missing data (e.g., patients dropped from the study) were treated in the outcome
of the statistical analysis, which used intention to treat. Further, in the included studies,
there were two strategies described to use intention to treat, descriptive statistics and the
generalized linear model, which indicate a low risk of bias. Selective reporting bias was
not found in any of the included RCTs. This is because all trials were registered on the
ClinicalTrials.gov website before beginning to randomize participants. The second reason
is that all study outcomes were reported. All potential bias risks are summarized (see
Supplementary Table S1).

2.6. Data Analysis

We conducted meta-analyses assessing the differences of post-treatment and between
three and six months of follow-up on post-traumatic, depression, and anxiety symptoms
among patients with PTSD. Comparisons between included studies are presented in the
results (see Table 1 and Table 2). We also calculated the weighted mean difference and 95%
conﬁdence interval of the included studies. The RevMan software version 5 was used to
compare EMDR and CBT used in treating PTSD patients. Lastly, a review of the literature
regarding the cost-effectiveness and safety of EMDR and CBT was conducted.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Included Studies

There were eight studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, and
their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The studies have been organized by
date from oldest to most recent, as some studies were conducted by the same authors at
different times. The eight included studies were published from 2011 to 2020 and evaluated
the efﬁcacy of EMDR and CBT for the treatment of patients with PTSD comorbid with
other psychological disorders. Seven of them were from the Netherlands and one was from
Australia. Out of the eight RCTs, three studies addressed the efﬁcacy of EMDR treatment on
children and adolescents (4–18 years old), and ﬁve studies were on adults (18–65 years old).
This review is comprised of eight RCTs published between 2011 and 2020, with a
total of 780 participants including children, adolescents, and adults. The EMDR treatment
group (n = 385, mean age ± SD: 28.19 ± 10) and the CBT treatment group (n = 395,
mean age ± SD: 29.69 ± 10) were randomized to be included in the studies. It is important
to note that in this review, studies that utilized mixed interventions with these treatment
groups were excluded, as the study purpose was only to measure the efﬁcacy of two
treatment options with no other interventions.

In terms of the types of CBT variants covered in this study, there were a total of three
RCTs that looked at the effectiveness of EMDR therapy and PE therapy on PTSD [25,30,31].
The other two RCTs compared brief eclectic psychotherapy with EMDR treatment for
PTSD [28,29]. It is essential to highlight that Nijdam and colleagues conducted two RCTs,
one published ten years ago and the second was published four years ago. The ﬁrst study
examined the effectiveness and response pattern of a trauma-focused CBT modality in treat-
ing PTSD, while the more recent study investigated between brief eclectic psychotherapy
and EMDR for PTSD to determine how symptom improvements relate.

Further, another two RCTs were conducted by the same researchers in different time-
frames [26,27]. The ﬁrst study compared CBT to EMDR, while the second compared EMDR
to a variant of CBT called cognitive behavioral writing therapy. In another study [3], the
trauma-focused CBT modality was compared to EMDR to identify which one is more
effective in treating PTSD. In terms of the study design, this review solely includes RCTs,
ﬁve of which had two arms and three of which had three arms (see Table 2). Differences
between measures for PTSD assessment are also provided in Table 2.

3.2. PTSD Symptoms Post-Treatment

Pooling seven studies in a meta-analysis there was little to no evidence to suggest
that the difference in the mean level of post-traumatic symptoms from baseline to post-
intervention differed for those who received EMDR treatment compared to those who
received CBT (t6 = 0.77, p = 0.44). The difference is estimated at −0.14 fewer post-traumatic
symptoms (SDM (95% CI −0.48 to 0.21)). In this quantitative meta-analysis, the included
studies, however, had a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 75%) (Supplementary Figure S1).
The included studies had no asymmetry or bias in a funnel plot of publication bias.

3.3. PTSD at Three-Month Follow-Up

The meta-analysis of two studies at a three-month follow-up indicates that there is
little to no evidence that EMDR treatment reduces the post-traumatic symptoms in par-
ticipants with PTSD compared to CBT (t1 = 0.60, p = 0.55). The difference is estimated at
−1.09 fewer post-traumatic symptoms after the ﬁrst treatment than the second therapy
(SDM (95% CI −4.63 to 2.46)). However, the two studies had no level of heterogeneity
(I2 = 0%) (see Supplementary Figure S2). No asymmetry or bias in a funnel plot of publica-
tion bias was also found.

3.4. Depression Symptoms Post-Treatment

In this meta-analysis, depression symptoms were investigated through three stud-
ies. The meta-analysis showed that there is strong evidence that EMDR reduced the
depression symptom levels compared to CBT (t2 = 3.20, p = 0.001). The difference is
estimated at −2.43 lower depression symptom levels (SDM (95% CI −3.93 to −0.94)).
However, the three studies had a low level of incidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 22%) (see
Supplementary Figure S3). Further, the included studies had no asymmetry or bias in a
funnel plot of publication bias.

3.5. Depression Symptoms at Six-Month Follow-Up

At a six-month follow-up, the meta-analysis of one study showed that there was
little to no evidence that EMDR reduced the depression symptom level compared to CBT
(t = 0.54, p = 0.59). The difference is estimated at 5.10 lower depression symptom levels after
CBT than after the EMDR (SDM (95% CI −13.29 to 23.49)) (see Supplementary Figure S4).
However, the heterogeneity was not applicable because only one study measured the
follow-up at six months.

Parenting and children were involved in EMDR treatment
sessions in the form of group discussions. Every week, parents
share their observations about their child’s functioning 5 min
before and after each session. 1/week for six weeks (45 min per
session).
Psychoeducation, promoting healthy coping strategies, cognitive
restructuring, and writing narrative about a traumatic memory
were included during CBWT sessions. 1/week for six weeks
(45 min per session).

After randomization, participants received recurrent
appointments for six weeks, were advised they would be
randomly assigned to EMDR or CBWT (if necessary), and the
treatment began one week after allocation. In case of a crisis or
much worsening of symptoms, WL participants were provided
with a contact telephone number.

3.6. Anxiety Symptoms Post-Treatment

In this meta-analysis, 3 studies, which included 185 patients, revealed that there was
very strong evidence that EMDR reduces the level of anxiety symptoms in patients with
PTSD compared to CBT (t2 = 5.30, p < 0.001). The difference is estimated at −3.99 lower
anxiety levels (SDM (95% CI −5.47 to −2.52)). However, the three studies had no level of
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) (see Supplementary Figure S5).

3.7. Anxiety Symptoms at Three-Month Follow-Up

At a three-month follow-up, the meta-analysis of two studies showed that there was
little to no evidence that EMDR reduced the anxiety symptom level compared to CBT
(t1 = 1.01, p = 0.31). The difference is estimated at −3.49 lower anxiety symptom levels
(SDM (95% CI −10.28 to 3.30)). However, the two studies had a low level of incidence of
heterogeneity (I2 = 19%), as seen in Supplementary Figure S6. In addition, the included
studies had no asymmetry or bias in a funnel plot of publication bias

4. Discussion

This review was conducted to compare EMDR and CBT efﬁcacy in reducing post-
traumatic, anxiety, and depression symptoms among patients with PTSD. Both treatments
were found to be effective at alleviating PTSD symptoms. In terms of alleviating depression
and anxiety, EMDR treatment was found more effective. However, its effectiveness at
reducing these symptoms was only available in post-treatment interventions and not
evident at the follow-up.

4.1. PTSD Symptoms Post-Treatment

There are similarities and differences between the current meta-analysis ﬁndings and
other meta-analysis ﬁndings that compared our two treatment options. The current meta-
analysis results contradict a previous analysis [32], which did ﬁnd a slight reduction but a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in PTSD symptoms with EMDR and CBT. The difference
in results between studies might be explained by the inclusion of up-to-date papers in the
current analysis and the exclusion of inappropriate papers that might have substantially
contributed to the heterogeneity in the ﬁndings. In their meta-analysis, the heterogeneity
was signiﬁcantly evident, but the authors could not perform a further investigation due to
insufﬁcient studies. There is a statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity in our ﬁndings despite
that the current meta-analysis involved two RCTs that had never been published in any
review papers. The difference in results might also be attributed to the fact that the current
review and the other meta-analysis had a small number of participants.

There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in terms of the efﬁcacy of EMDR and
CBT in the ﬁndings, as two studies showed that both treatments are effective in treating
PTSD [33,34]. The difference found by Ho and Lee was similar to what was found in the
current analysis. However, the incidence level of heterogeneity in the current meta-analysis
was higher than Ho and Lee’s meta-analysis, which had low heterogeneity. The reason for
the inconsistency is likely due to different measures being used for PTSD. For example,
all studies in Ho and Lee’s analysis used identical measures for measuring PTSD, while
the current analysis included studies that used different measures. It is also important to
note that the studies included in Ho and Lee’s analysis were published up to 2006. On the
other hand, the current analysis included studies published between 2011 and 2020, which
is a major strength compared to the previous reviews. Moreover, EMDR treatment was
determined comparable to CBT in reducing PTSD symptoms [35], which is consistent with
the current meta-analysis.

4.2. Depression Symptoms Post-Treatment

Based upon the results of this meta-analysis, EMDR was signiﬁcantly more effective
than CBT at reducing depression symptoms post-intervention, which is incompatible with
other prior studies, in which the authors reported no signiﬁcant differences [35,36]. In

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16836

13 of 17

contrast, in terms of depression reduction, other authors found a statistically signiﬁcant
difference between EMDR and CBT [32,34], which is consistent with the current analysis
ﬁndings. There are some factors that play essential roles in the amelioration of depres-
sion, such as the length of the therapy session and the experience that therapists have in
conducting group therapy [32].

In the current meta-analysis, we found that a range of 4 to 16 treatment sessions were
used to treat post-traumatic, anxiety, and depression symptoms in patients with PTSD.
Those in the EMDR group received from 15 to 90 min per session, whereas those in the
CBT group received from 45 to 90 min per session and, thus, there is no consensus on how
many sessions both modalities should use to treat these symptoms. According to some
authors, between 12 and 20 sessions are required to see more lasting improvements in PTSD
symptoms [37], although it might differ reliant on trauma type, the intensity of symptoms,
and the client’s age. Psychological changes caused by trauma that took place over a longer
period of time within adolescents and adults are likely to require more intensive EMDR
treatment sessions [32]. This is similar to other authors’ recommendations that individuals
with multiple traumatic events should obtain an adequate number of sessions, which range
from 3 to 5 h per session, than those exposed to single event [37]. However, some studies
included in the current review concluded that 6 to 12 sessions (15 to 90 min each) of EMDR
were sufﬁcient for improvement.

4.3. Anxiety Symptoms Post-Treatment

Anxiety disorder is more likely to be presented in PTSD patients due to negative
experiences in the past, and they wish to avoid recalling those events. The current meta-
analysis of three studies on the effects of EMDR compared to CBT on anxiety revealed that
there is a signiﬁcantly difference in favor of EMDR sessions. This result is consistent with
analyses of another review [35], in which they reported the same result. It is important to
highlight that our meta-analysis found a heterogeneity level similar to the heterogeneity
level reported by Moreno-Alcazar et al. This shows that there is consistency among studies’
outcomes in the current and previous meta-analyses, which increases the conﬁdence in
recommendations about treatments for those diagnosed with PTSD anxiety symptoms.
Similarly, other authors showed that there was a reduction in subjective distress in patients
who had undertaken EMDR therapy in comparison to those awaiting treatment in a control
group [38]. Therefore, this therapy helps patients cope with subsequent trauma by reducing
anxiety and distress.

4.4. Cost-Effectiveness and Safety of Both Treatments

In light of the existence of the many treatments used for some mental disorders, it is
necessary to highlight the characteristics of the selected treatment in terms of its efﬁcacy,
cost, and wanted beneﬁts. It is becoming more common for policymakers, insurers, and
providers to consider the effectiveness, costs, and beneﬁts of different interventions when
choosing among possible alternatives [39]. Generally, and especially concerning EMDR
therapy, the costs and beneﬁts of interventions have not been extensively studied. This
therapy has been examined for its health and economic beneﬁts in two studies. However,
according to a research study conducted recently, individuals with PTSD and comorbid
psychosis who received the EMDR treatment in addition to their standard therapy had
more signiﬁcant savings than those who received CBT for each patient per 6 months [40].
Another study evaluated the beneﬁts and costs of PTSD treatment based on an analyt-
ical decision model provided by the British Mental Health Service [18]. Out of 11 different
interventions evaluated in the study, the authors found that EMDR treatment was con-
sidered the utmost cost-effective approach to treating PTSD in adults. Contrary to their
conclusion, CBT did not appear as cost-effective as other intervention modalities, such as
psychoeducation and self-help with support. However, to generalize assessments, similar
studies should be conducted in multiple different healthcare services.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16836

EMDR treatment has remarkable safety characteristics, as it has far fewer adverse
effects (such as light-headedness and vivid dreams) than pharmaceutical therapy [41] and
is often well-tolerated by PTSD patients [18]. However, clinical practitioners may combine
it with pharmacological therapies, such as sertraline and ﬂuoxetine, in the most severe
cases of generalized anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. It appears that the synergy
of pharmacological therapy combined with EMDR therapy is an effective and promising
way to treat psychopathological disorders such as anxiety and depression [42]. Similar to
treatment with CBT, PTSD from various traumas can be resolved using this type of therapy
safely and effectively [43].

4.5. Strengths and Limitations

This meta-analysis had a number of strengths. First, the current analysis included
up-to-date studies and the sample size of the included studies was larger than previous
studies. Second, the studies included a wide range of age groups. The included studies
also have good quality in design based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool, which might allow
the results to be generalized. Further, the review did not include different countries and
cultures. The non-diversity of countries may raise the generalizability of the ﬁndings. Some
weaknesses were found in this meta-analysis. Some of the studies vary in heterogeneity,
due to the lack of similarity in participants’ characteristics; thus, the validity of these results
may be lowered. Moreover, in some studies there was a small sample size, which may
restrict the ability to detect statistically signiﬁcant differences in our meta-analysis.

4.6. Answering the Main Question

Despite the focus on EMDR and CBT interventions in each of the eight studies, there
was also a comparison of different CBT approaches. This review included studies which
focused on a number of treatment outcomes; for example, treating anxiety and depression
alongside PTSD. Overall, EMDR treatment was found to be superior to CBT in treating
anxiety in children and adolescents, but not in adults, and in treating depression in children,
adolescents, and adults. In treating PTSD, however, no difference was found between the
treatments. There are recommendations in most studies which emphasize that further
research and larger sample sizes are needed for identifying the efﬁcacy of both treatments
in treating children and adolescents.

4.7. Implications

The level of awareness about PTSD has increased over the years, albeit not enough.
However, to help increase the public’s understanding about PTSD and its therapy, it is
suggested that some places, such as primary healthcare centers and public schools, could
help spread awareness about this disorder by using brochures and posters. In addition,
using reliable social media platforms might also be a powerful way of educating the general
public. Educating patients’ parents or guardians also plays an important role because it
helps them have a better understanding of the negative reactions that are caused by trauma,
thus helping them better understand their children’s situation. As the child learns that
these symptoms are related to PTSD, they will be reassured that their parents can provide
the right treatment for them.

Based on the current ﬁndings, it can be assumed that the therapies delivered by
qualiﬁed mental health professionals have been very effective in treating PTSD. EMDR
and CBT are among these therapies, and both are shown to be effective in dealing with
PTSD, according to the aforementioned results. Thus, researchers should use a bigger
sample size and conduct more RCTs to examine the impact of them on PTSD. In terms of
the management of anxiety and depression in PTSD, patients respond to EMDR better than
CBT. This implies that researchers found evidence on the efﬁcacy of the EMDR therapy for
treating anxiety and depression in those patients, unlike in another study [35], which did
not report any difference.

When it comes to EMDR therapy, some countries such as Saudi Arabia are still far
behind since this kind of intervention is still considered relatively new. In Saudi Arabia,
there is currently little to no study on using this therapy for treating psychological disorders,
which indicates underutilization. However, this study might help encourage and support
nursing staff and other healthcare professionals in evidence-based practice to learn more
about EMDR therapy, thus helping to provide more effective care for PTSD patients in
Saudi Arabia. In future studies, the effect of using such therapeutic intervention with a
broader range of patients should be studied. Moreover, the studies in the future should
pay more attention to the concerns of intervention costs.

5. Conclusions

The efﬁcacy of EMDR therapy in reducing PTSD symptoms is still up for debate.
Nevertheless, the research in this area has created huge interest between researchers
themselves and physicians. In the included studies that were scrutinized for the purpose of
the current study, it was found that the EMDR intervention has efﬁcacy in treating children
and adolescents with anxiety and is effective in treating children, adolescents, and adults
with depression symptoms in people with PTSD. However, due to the lack of studies, it was
not enough to give conclusive evidence about its efﬁcacy. Moreover, the EMDR treatment
was found to be as effective as CBT. It also has an advantage in time efﬁciency due to its
results appearing in fewer sessions compared to CBT.
