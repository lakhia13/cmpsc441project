Abstract
Adolescent suicide is a serious public health problem, and non-suicidal
self-injury (NSSI) is both highly comorbid with suicidality among
adolescents and a significant predictor of suicide attempts (SAs) in
adolescents. We will clarify extant definitions related to suicidality and NSSI
and the important similarities and differences between these constructs.
We will also review several significant risk factors for suicidality,
evidence-based and evidence-informed safety management strategies,
and evidence-based treatment for adolescent self-harming behaviors.
Currently, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for adolescents is the first and
only treatment meeting the threshold of a well-established treatment for
self-harming adolescents at high risk for suicide. Areas in need of future
study include processes underlying the association between NSSI and
SAs, clarification of warning signs and risk factors that are both sensitive
and specific enough to accurately predict who is at imminent risk for
suicide, and further efforts to sustain the effects of DBT post-treatment.
DBT is a time- and labor-intensive treatment that requires extensive training
for therapists and a significant time commitment for families (generally 6
months). It will therefore be helpful to assess whether other less-intensive
treatment options can be established as evidence-based treatment for
suicidal adolescents.

Introduction
Suicide  is  a  significant  public  health  problem  in  the  United 
States. Over the last 15 years, suicide rates have increased across 
all  age  groups;  however,  the  greatest  increase  has  been  found 
in  females  aged  10–14  (200%)1,2.  Suicide  is  the  second  lead-
ing  cause  of  death  among  10–24  year  olds3.  Despite  decades  of 
research  on  suicide  prevention  in  this  age  group,  suicide  rates 
among  10–19  year  olds  increased  by  56%  between  2007  and  
2016.  A  2017  national  survey  found  that  17.2%  of  high  school 
students  seriously  considered  making  a  suicide  attempt  (SA), 
13.6%  made  a  suicide  plan,  and  7.4%  made  one  or  more  SAs4. 
Historically,  males  are  more  likely  to  die  by  suicide;  however, 
incident  rate  ratios  comparing  deaths  by  suicide  between  adoles-
cent  males  and  females  have  been  decreasing  since  2007,  with 
findings  demonstrating  that  numbers  of  adolescent  female  sui-
cides  are  catching  up  to  those  of  their  male  counterparts2.  An  
alarmingly 
large  percentage  of  adolescents  experience  sui-
cidal  ideation  (SI),  and  SI  has  been  shown  to  confer  signifi-
cant  risk  for  future  SAs.  Adolescents  who  experience  SI  are  
12  times  more  likely  than  adolescents  who  do  not  experience  SI 
to  attempt  suicide  by  age  30,  with  86.1%  of  adolescents  making 
a  SA  within  12  months  of  SI  onset5.  More  than  one-third  of  
adolescents who experience SI go on to attempt suicide5.

Rates  of  non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI;  e.g.  scratching  or  
cutting  oneself;  see  below)  are  also  high,  particularly  among 
adolescents,  with  approximately  18%  of  high  school  students 
overall  and  24%  of  high  school  girls  in  the  U.S.  reporting  at 
least  one  episode  of  NSSI  within  the  past  12  months6.  While, 
by  definition,  the  purpose  of  NSSI  is  not  to  end  one’s  life  (see  
below),  NSSI  is  a  significant  risk  factor  for  future  SAs7,8.  We 
important  differences  and  similarities  among 
will  describe 
types  of  self-injurious  behaviors  (i.e.  NSSI  and  SA),  risk  
factors  for  self-injury  among  adolescents,  and  evidence-based 
management  and  treatment  intervention  strategies  for  these  
behaviors.

Definitions of self-injurious behaviors
SAs  and  NSSI  can  be  grouped  into  the  overarching  category  of 
self-harm  (SH).  SAs  are  potentially  self-injurious  behaviors  con-
ducted  with  some  intent  to  die  (i.e.  to  cause  one’s  own  death) 
as  a  result  of  the  behavior9.  NSSIs  are  self-injurious  behaviors 
performed  without  any  intent  to  die9  and  include  such  behav-
iors  as  scratching  the  skin,  cutting,  burning,  head  banging,  
hitting  oneself,  and  so  forth9.  The  purposes,  or  functions,  of 
NSSI  are  typically  to  reduce  or  distract  from  negative  emo-
tions,  punish  oneself,  and/or  reduce  feelings  of  numbness  or  dis-
sociation10.  While  some  studies  have  examined  SA  and  NSSI 
as  separate  outcomes,  differentiated  by  the  presence  (SAs)  or 
absence  (NSSI)  of  intent  to  die  as  a  result  of  the  behavior,  other 
studies  have  used  the  broader  category  of  SH,  in  part,  because 
of  the  challenge  of  accurately  determining  whether  or  not  SH  
included  an  intent  to  die11.  Inconsistencies  in  how  SH  and  
suicidal  behaviors  are  studied—as  an  overall  category  of  SH  
versus separate entities of NSSI and SA—has made it difficult to 
compare  outcomes  between  studies  and  has  therefore  hampered 
progress  in  furthering  our  understanding  of  these  constructs.  
See Table 1 for a list of terms, abbreviations, and definitions of SH 
used in this review.

Similarities and differences between suicide attempt 
and non-suicidal self-injury
Research  in  recent  years  has  focused  on  the  similarities  and  dif-
ferences  between  SAs  and  NSSI.  As  noted  above,  SA  and 
NSSI  are  similar  in  that  both  are  types  of  deliberate  SH.  While 
the  major  differentiator  between  NSSI  and  SAs  is  the  pres-
ence  or  absence  of  intent  to  die,  other  factors  differentiate  these 
behaviors  (e.g.  function, 
lethality,  medical  severity,  preva-
lence  rate,  and  frequency  of  the  behavior;  see  Table  1)12,13.  
SAs  and  NSSI  were  previously  addressed  in  the  Diagnos-
tic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM)  IV 
only  as  symptoms  of  other  mental  disorders,  such  as  major 
depressive  disorder  (MDD)  and  borderline  personality  dis-
order  (BPD)14.  DSM  514  includes  new  diagnostic  categories, 
NSSI  disorder  and  suicidal  behavior  disorder,  as  “condition[s]  
for  further  study”14.  The  inclusion  of  these  disorders  increases 
consistency  with  the  extant  treatment  literature,  which  generally 
holds  that  NSSI  and  SAs  must  be  targeted  directly,  rather 
than  as  secondary  to  other  diagnoses.  This  is  in  opposition  to 
views  that  NSSI  and  suicidality  are  symptoms  of  other  disor-
ders,  such  as  depressive  disorders,  that  will  remit  independently 
as depression is treated15.

there  are 

While 
important  distinctions  between  SAs  and 
NSSI,  the  relationship  between  these  behaviors  is  important. 
Research  shows  that  most  adolescents  engage  in  NSSI  and  SAs  
concurrently16.  In  fact,  the  majority  of  adolescents  who  have 
engaged  in  NSSI  have  also  attempted  suicide17,  and  NSSI  is 
a  robust  predictor  of  future  SA  among  youth  with  depressive  
disorders7,8.  Recent  findings  elucidated  a  temporal  order  to  SI, 
SAs, and NSSI, such that adolescents have already thought about 
suicide  prior  to  the  first  onset  of  NSSI,  and  NSSI  typically  pre-
cedes  the  first  SA13.  It  has  been  posited  that  NSSI  serves  as  a  
“gateway”  to  SA  by  way  of  eroding  natural  tendencies  of  
self-preservation and increasing comfort with SH16.

Risk factors for suicidal behavior in adolescents
the  American  Psychological  Asso-
In  November  of  2016, 
ciation  (APA)  released  a  statement 
titled,  “After  Decades 
of  Research,  Science  Is  No  Better  Able  to  Predict  Suicidal 
Behaviors”18.  This  was  based  on  a  meta-analysis  of  50  years 
of  research  on  risk  factors  for  suicidality  in  which  the  authors  
found  that  the  ability  of  identified  risk  factors  to  predict  suicidal 
thoughts  and  behaviors  was  only  slightly  better  than  chance19. 
At  this  time,  there  is  not  a  standardized  suicide  risk  assess-
ment  that  accurately  predicts  suicidal  behavior.  Currently,  any 
attempt to apply a standardized risk assessment to determine who 
is  at  imminent  risk  for  suicide  will  yield  a  high  number  of  false  
positives20.  This  is  because  many  of  the  risk  factors  for  sui-
cide  are  also  found  in  individuals  who  are  not  suicidal;  in  other 
words,  identified  risk  factors  and  warning  signs  for  suicide  are 
neither  sensitive  nor  specific  enough  to  accurately  predict  who 
is  at  imminent  risk  for  suicide21,22.  While  it  has  generally  been  
determined  that  risk  for  suicidal  behavior  increases  with  the 
number  of  risk  factors  present23,  it  is  also  not  yet  known  what  
combinations  of  risk  factors  are  most  likely  to  lead  to  sui-
cidal  behavior  and  death  by  suicide19.  While  a  full  review  of 
risk  factors  for  suicidality  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper, 
the  adolescent  literature  has  identified  several  risk  factors  for

suicidal  behavior,  many  of  which—but  not  all—are  listed  in  
Table 2.

In  recent  years,  research  has  aimed  to  elucidate  which  risk  
factors  are  modifiable24  (i.e.  can  be  changed)  and  when  they 
occur  in  time  prior  to  suicidal  behavior19.  With  this  informa-
tion,  clinicians  will  be  able  to  target  dynamic  risk  factors  
(e.g.  family  conflict)25  for  suicidal  behavior  more  accurately  in 
order  to  reduce  suicide  risk.  Furthermore,  identifying  proximal  
risk  factors  (e.g.  sleep  disturbance)26  will  help  clinicians  deter-
mine  who  is  at  immediate  risk  of  engaging  in  suicidal  behavior. 
Presently,  there  are  several  websites  with  lists  of  warning  
signs  (i.e.  behavioral  indicators  that  a  SA  is  imminent  or  likely 
to  happen  within  hours  to  days)27  for  adolescent  suicidal  behav-
ior; however, there is little research to support these as indicators  
of imminent suicidal behavior.

Strategies for managing suicidal youth in outpatient 
settings
There  are  several  strategies  that  can  be  used  across  diagnoses 
and  outpatient  treatments  to  manage  safety  concerns  when  
working with suicidal adolescents and their families.

Written safety plan
Because  patients  may  have  difficulty  identifying  and  implement-
ing  adaptive  coping  strategies  in  the  place  of  SH  when  they  are 
in  the  midst  of  a  suicidal  crisis  and  overwhelmed  by  strong  
negative  emotions,  the  written  safety  plan  helps  the  suicidal  
individual 
in  crisis  
to  select  and  use  coping  strategies 
situations28–31.  Safety  plans  have  been  used  in  the  context  of 
short-term,  empirically  supported  treatments  that  have  been 
found  to  reduce  suicide  risk,  such  as  cognitive  therapy31,32  and  
cognitive behavior therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP)30. It is 
critical  to  note  that  the  written  safety  plan  is  not  a  “no-suicide”  
contract,  which  has  been  shown  to  be  ineffective  in  preventing  
suicidal behavior and death by suicide33,34.

Means restriction
Means  restriction  includes  removing  or  limiting  access  to  poten-
tially  life-threatening  settings  or  objects,  such  as  firearms, 
tall  buildings,  bridges,  trains/traffic,  sharps,  and  any  medica-
tions  and  toxic  substances  that  could  be  used  to  overdose35.  It 
has  been  documented  that  removing  the  suicidal  individual’s 
access  to  lethal  means  is  a  highly  effective  suicide  prevention 
strategy  with  a  robust  empirical  basis36,37.  Access  to  firearms, 

in  particular,  is  a  significant  predictor  of  death  by  suicide,  inde-
pendent  of  all  other  factors38.  Of  note,  between  1996  and  2010,  
firearms  were  the  most  common  method  used  in  death  by  sui-
cide  in  the  U.S.  (51%)39.  This  statistic  is  underscored  by  find-
ings  demonstrating  that  limited  access  to  firearms  explains  the  
significantly  smaller  number  of  deaths  by  suicide  among  
on-campus college students, who have a nearly ninefold decrease 
in access to firearms when compared to age- and gender-matched  
controls40.  Furthermore,  psychological  autopsy  studies  of  ado-
lescents  who  died  by  suicide  in  the  absence  of  psychopa-
thology  have  suggested  that  access  to  a  loaded  firearm  is  a  
significant  risk  factor  for  death  by  suicide41.  In  states  within 
the  U.S.  and  other  countries,  greater  firearm  regulations  are  
associated with reductions in suicide deaths by firearms42.

Increased monitoring/supervision
Several studies have linked low parental supervision and monitor-
ing  (i.e.  physical  supervision  of  the  adolescent  as  well  as  aware-
ness  of  the  adolescent’s  activities  and  schedule)  to  increased 
risk  for  suicidal  behavior  among  adolescents43,44.  The  Ameri-
can  Academy  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  (AACAP)  
practice  parameter  for  suicidal  youth  recommend  that  suicidal 
children  and  adolescents  be  monitored  closely  by  a  trustworthy  
and supportive adult45.

Reducing risk factors
Reducing  malleable  risk  factors  related  to  adolescent  suicide, 
such  as  decreasing  family  conflict,  seeking  treatment  for  sleep 
problems,  and  addressing  peer  victimization  and  bullying  
with the school, requires parental involvement.

Working with parents
Strengthening  the  parent–teen  relationship  and  improving  fam-
treating  suicidal  youth31. 
ily  functioning  are  critical  when 
We  ultimately  want  the  adolescent  to  communicate  with  par-
ents  when  they  are  in  a  suicidal  crisis  so  that  parents  can  help 
keep  the  adolescent  safe  and  obtain  appropriate  help.  Addi-
tionally,  family  conflict  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  adolescent  
suicide  and  suicidal  behavior  while  family  cohesion  serves 
as  a  protective  factor  against  suicide  and  suicidal  behavior46. 
Finally,  parents  have  a  significant  role  in  implementing  strat-
egies  outside  of  treatment  to  try  to  prevent  the  adolescent 
from  making  a  SA,  such  as  removing  access  to  lethal  means,  
providing  supervision  and  monitoring,  and  seeking  emergency 
services when needed.

Treatment approaches
A  2015  meta-analysis  of  19  studies  of  therapeutic  interven-
tions  (TIs)  for  SH  behavior  in  adolescents  found TIs  to  be  supe-
rior  to  control  conditions  for  decreasing  SH. The  strongest  effect 
sizes  were  found  for  DBT,  mentalization-based  therapy  (MBT), 
and  CBT113.  As  noted  earlier,  working  with  parents  as  part  of 
the  treatment  of  teens  who  SH  is  of  critical  importance.  The 
same  meta-analysis  also  found  that  effect  sizes  were  greatest  for  
treatments  that  included  family-based  components53.  As  previ-
ously  mentioned,  family  conflict  is  a  significant  risk  factor  for 
suicidal  behavior  in  adolescents25,55–57  and  must  be  addressed 
when  working  with  suicidal  youth.  Additionally,  the  relation-
ship  between  the  suicidal  adolescent  and  parent  or  caregiver  is  
important  given  that,  as  discussed  above,  parents  play  a  crucial  
role in safety planning.

A  2018  systematic  review  examined  21  randomized  control-
led  trials  (RCTs)  and  assessed  18  distinct  treatment  interven-
tions,  five  of  which  reported  significant  results  in  reducing 
SH  or  SAs  when  compared  to  treatment  as  usual114.  These  five  
interventions  included  DBT  for  adolescents,  MBT,  safe  alter-
natives  for  teens  and  youth,  integrated  CBT,  and  developmen-
tal  group  psychotherapy  (DGP).  Two  replication  studies  of  DGP 

did  not  find  significant  results.  Common  elements  of  the  five 
interventions  with  significant  results  included  family  involve-
ment  or  support,  emotion  regulation  skills,  communication  
skills, and problem-solving skills114.

Dialectical behavior therapy
At  this  time,  DBT  is  the  first  and  only  “well-established”  treat-
ment  for  suicidal  and  SH  adolescents.  DBT  targets  both  SA  and 
NSSI  by  identifying  the  function  of  the  behavior  (e.g.  reduc-
ing  emotional  distress)  for  the  given  individual  and  finding 
ways  to  obtain  that  function  safely  using  DBT-based  coping  
skills.  Components  of  standard  DBT  are  the  same  for  adoles-
cents  and  adults  (see  Table  3),  with  the  exception  of  there  being 
parenting  and  family  sessions  with  the  individual  therapist  as  
needed and the skills class including both teens and parents117–119.

Mehlum  and  colleagues  (see  Table  4)120,121  completed  a  multisite 
RCT  in  Oslo,  Norway,  comparing  19  weeks  of  outpatient 
DBT  with  enhanced  usual  care  (EUC;  i.e.  any  non-DBT  
therapy  plus  suicide  risk  assessment).  DBT  was  superior  to 
EUC  in  reducing  the  frequency  of  SH  behaviors,  severity  of  SI, 
and  depressive  symptoms,  with  this  DBT  condition  showing  
large  effect  sizes  with  regard  to  treatment  outcome,  whereas  the 
EUC condition resulted in weak to moderate outcomes. At 1-year 
follow-up,  DBT  remained  superior  to  EUC  in  reduction  of 
SH  frequency;  however,  there  were  no  significant  differences 
between  treatment  conditions  for  SI,  hopelessness,  depressive  
symptoms, and BPD features120,121.

the  U.S.,  McCauley  and  colleagues 

(see  Table  5)122  
In 
conducted  a  multisite  RCT  with  adolescents  at  high  risk  for  
suicide (i.e., with a history of at least one lifetime SA and repeti-
tive  SH)  to  determine  whether  DBT  is  effective  in  reducing 
SAs,  in  addition  to  SH.  Participants  received  either  6  months 
of  comprehensive  DBT  or  individual  and  group  supportive  
psychotherapy  (IGST),  a  manualized,  client-centered  approach 
that 
Internal  
validity  was  enhanced  by  IGST’s  match  to  DBT  for  hours  of 
treatment,  modalities  (i.e.  both  individual  and  group  therapy), 
therapy  drop-out  policies,  therapist  expertise,  and  availability  of  
supervision123.  Results  demonstrated  that  youth  in  the  DBT  
condition  reported  significantly  fewer  SAs,  NSSI,  total  SH  and 
SI  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  than  youth  in  IGST.  While  both 
groups  continued  to  demonstrate  improvements  at  12-month  
follow-up,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  DBT  
and  IGST122.  Taken  together,  these  studies  support  DBT  as  the 
only  replicated  treatment  with  demonstrated  efficacy  at  reducing  
SH in adolescents.

time-  and 

In  the  McCauley  et  al.  (2018)  study,  DBT  was  not  superior 
to  control  at  12-month  follow-up  at  reducing  SA  and  SH122, 
suggesting  that  more  work  is  needed  to  determine  how  to  
sustain  significant  effects  of  DBT  after  active  treatment  has  
ended.  Additionally,  DBT 
labor-intensive  
is  a 
treatment.  It  generally  requires  a  4–6-month  commitment  from 
adolescents  and  families  and  includes  at  least  two  sessions  per  
week  (one  individual  session  and  one  multifamily  skills  group). 
Further,  DBT  is  a  complex  treatment  that  requires  significant  
provider  training.  Thus,  dismantling  studies  will  be  useful  in 
determining  what  aspects  of  DBT  yield  significant  effects,  and  
establishment  of  shorter,  less  training-intensive  treatments  for  
SH/suicidal  adolescents  will  be  particularly  useful 
for  
communities  where—based  on  access  to  training  or  financial  
is  not  an  option, 
resources—comprehensive  DBT 
and  for  those  families  who  are  unable  to  make  the  time  and/or  
potential financial commitment DBT requires.

Hospitalization
The  AACAP’s  Practice  Parameter  for  the  Assessment  and 
Treatment  of  Children  and  Adolescents  with  Suicidal  Behavior 
recommends 
that  psychiatric  hospitalization  be  considered 
if  an  adolescent  is  determined  to  be  at  high  risk  of  imminent  
suicidal  behavior45.  At  present,  however,  there  is  no  research  
supporting  the  effectiveness  of  hospitalization  at  reducing  future  
SAs18,117.  In  fact,  Chung  and  colleagues’  recent  meta-analysis 
reviewed  100  studies  of  patients  hospitalized  for  suicidality  and 
found  the  highest  rates  of  death  by  suicide  in  the  first  3  months 
after  discharge.  These  rates  are  100  times  the  global  suicide  
rate18.  Data  have  also  shown  that  rehospitalization  rates  are  high: 
13%  at  90-day  follow-up124,  38%  at  6-month  follow-up125,  and  
that  
30–43%  at  1-year 

follow-up126.  These  data  suggest

hospitalization  is  not  an  adequate  intervention  for  lowering 
risk  for  subsequent  suicidal  behavior29  and,  in  fact,  may  confer  
greater risk for future suicidal behavior.

Conclusion
Suicide  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  among  adolescents3.  
Not  only  is  NSSI  a  risk  factor  for  SAs  in  teens7,8  but  also 
recent  research  revealed  a  temporal  relationship  between  these 
behaviors,  such  that  NSSI  increases  the  likelihood  of  future 
SA,  and  SI  often  precedes  the  first  onset  of  NSSI13.  While,  
by definition, the intent of NSSI is not death, these findings under-
line  the  importance  of  taking  NSSI  seriously  and  performing  
ongoing assessment of, and intervention for, suicidal behavior.

There  are 
interventions 
in  adolescents  
(e.g.  written  safety  plan,  means  restriction,  and  increased  moni-
toring  by  a  parent  or  trusted  adult).  While  hospitalization  is  at 
times  unavoidable  for  individuals  who  are  unable  to  commit  
to  the  use  of  a  written  safety  plan  and  have  active  SI  with

intent  and  plan,  it  has  been  found  that  risk  for  suicide  increases  
significantly 
immediately  post-hospitalization.  Further  work 
on  how  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  hospitalization  and  to  
reduce  the  increased  risk  associated  with  it  is  a  critical  next  
step.

Overall,  there  is  a  small  number  of  empirically  supported  
treatments  for  decreasing  SAs  and  NSSI  in  adolescents.  DBT 
is  the  first  and  only  well-established  treatment  (i.e.  significant 
results  compared  to  control  in  at  least  two  RCTs  performed 
by  two  independent  research  groups)116  for  SH  adolescents 
at  high  risk  for  suicide127.  Replication  trials  are  needed  for  
several  other  treatments  that  have  shown  promise  in  decreasing  
SH  in  adolescents.  Common  elements  of  the  interventions  with  
significant results from at least one RCT included family involve-
ment  or  support,  emotion  regulation  skills,  communication 
skills,  and  problem-solving  skills;  however,  replications  and  
dismantling  studies  are  necessary  to  better  understand  the 
effects  of  these  interventions  and  their  components  on  reducing  
adolescent SH and SAs28.
