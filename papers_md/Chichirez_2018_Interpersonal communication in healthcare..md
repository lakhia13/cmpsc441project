Abstract 
Taking  into  account  that  the  medical  practice  and  health  systems  have  evolved  considerably  nowadays,  medical  establishments 
require the implementation of marketing guidelines to help maximize performance, with beneficial effects from the social, economic, 
and medical point of view, to differentiate from competitors. 
Communication  is  a  fundamental  clinical  skill  that,  if  performed  competently  and  efficiently,  facilitates  the  establishment  of  a 
relationship of trust between the medical staff and the patient-customer, a truly therapeutic alliance. 
In  addition  to  the  medical  personnel’s  competence  and  the  facilities  at  the  doctor’s  disposal,  the  willingness  manifested  during 
consultation,  kindness,  openness  and  attention  are  offered  to  patients-customers.  The  way  medical  personnel  responds  to  their 
needs and requests is an element that boosts performance, contributing to an increase in the prestige of the medical unit and the 
growing interest of patients-customers in it. 
Keywords: skills, communication, marketing, health 

Health  services’  marketing  includes  activities 
carried  out  for  the  purpose  of  development,  placement, 
pricing, or promotion of medical services. Communication 
is a very important component of the marketing mix. It is 
the instrument through which an entity participates in the 
exchange  of  information  with  the  various  components  of 
the  business  environment,  informs  about  their  presence 
and  the  services  offered,  to  create  a  favorable  attitude 
and  stimulate  consumers

Organizations 
personnel  (doctors  and  nurses)  and  auxiliaries  (nurses, 
administrative  staff,  security  guards)  are  a  distinctive 
element of the marketing mix, adding value in healthcare 
through the way they interact with customers. Besides the 
training of medical staff and medical advancements in the 
field of diagnosis and treatment, the human component is 
a very important factor, over 40% of the therapy's success 
being provided by the patient-doctor relationship [2].

In  health,  the  tools  of  the  communicational  mix 
are  based  on  an 
communication. 
interpersonal 
Interpersonal  (inter-human)  communication  was  the  first 
human spiritual tool of the socialization process [3] and is 
defined  by  Floyd  [4]  as  being  the  communication  that 
occurs  between  two  people  in  the  context  of  their 
relationship and that, as it evolves, helps to negotiate and 
define  the  relationship.  In  his  work  “The  psychology  of 
communication.  Theories  and  methods”,  Jean-Claude 
Abric  [5]  defines  communication  as  “the  ensemble  of 
processes  through  which  it  carries  out  exchanges  of

“the 
social 
communication cannot be conceived as a simple process 
of  transmission,  based  on  interaction,  being  always  a 
transition between speakers:  issuance and reception are 
simultaneous,  the  broadcaster  being  at  the  same  time 
broadcaster  and  receiver  and  firstly  broadcaster  and 
receiver (the mutual is also valid)”. In his work “Language 
as a means of social power”, Blakar [6] emphasizes that 
“the  broadcaster is a  creator who,  through  his message, 
provides  a  whole  set  of  information  with  respect  to  his 
own person, to his vision of the object of communication 
and  the  social  situation  he  wishes  and  perceives,  which 
will  be  perceived,  interpreted  and  evaluated  by  the 
interlocutor, causing reactions, commitment and blocking 
them”.  Certo  Samuel  [7]  recommends  the  receiver  “to 
to  people  who 
always 
communicate and be careful  not  to  convey  any  negative 
attitude  through  their  communication  behavior”  and,  as 
receivers,  they  should  try  to  take  into  consideration  the 
value of the message that they receive, without taking into 
account  attitudes  toward  the  source.  Otherwise,  many 
valuable  ideas  will  be  lost  if  they  allow  messages  they 
receive to be influenced by personal feelings.

It  should  be  considered  that  medical  system 
communication  takes  place  in  an  environment  that  is 
complex,  where  favorable  and  adverse  factors  coexist

medicine,  communication  has  many  forms  and  can  be 
seen  in  various  situations,  the  most  important  of  them 
undoubtedly  being  that  between  patient-doctor,  which

Interpersonal 
communication is born through the combination of verbal 
forms (an oral and written language), nonverbal (gestures, 
mimics, posture, movement, appearance) and paraverbal 
forms  (by  voice  attributes  accompanying  the  word,  such 
as intonation, the inflection of voice, tone, rhythm, verbal 
flow). It can be influenced by a number of factors [8]: 



the degree of closeness or spatial proximity;  
the  limits  and  the  extent  of  physical  contact 
in these relationships;  
the 
communication;   
the  exchange  of  glances  that  form  visual 
communication;  
 
the volume and pace of the interactions;  
 
the dynamics of reciprocal self-development. 
Taking  into  consideration  the  importance  of  the 
information  content  of  patient-doctor  communication  (the 
diagnostic  process,  treatment),  the  emphasis is more  on 
verbal communication in the medical system. Non-verbal 
and paraverbal forms are important from the perspective 
of their emotional effect and reliable capital formation and 
sympathy  that  must  exist  between  the  two  sides,  these 
forms being devoid of semantic and logical values.

In  their  works,  Cosman  and  Tudose  emphasize 
the elements of specificity of communication in medicine.

two  parts,  medical  personnel-patient,  is  much  more

level of the therapeutic level. The higher-level therapeutic 
communication  of  the  existential  type  is  involved  in 
medical  communication  because 
the  medical  act 
interferes with the patient's destiny, connected in turn by 
elements of uncertainty and individual instability [9].  
On  the  other  hand,  the  position  of  the  two  entities,

sometimes  with  magical  powers.  If,  for  the  former,  the

disease  is  a  scientific  and  objective  problem,  for  the 
patient it is an emotional and subjective problem [9]. 
Thus,  the  doctor-patient  relationship  becomes  a  role,  an 
asymmetric  and  consensual  relationship, 
the  doctor 
having a position of superiority, being the active element 
seeking a solution for the patient suffering from a disease, 
with the patient being the passive element that recognizes 
the authority of the doctor.   

Depending on the degree of involvement of each 
part,  Talcott  Parsons  [10]  distinguishes  between  three 
situations in the doctor-patient relationship:  

  activity-passivity, in which the doctor is active 

and the patient is passive;  

  managing-cooperation,  in  which  the  patient 

follows the medical advice;

the  doctor-patient  relationship  and 

George Ionescu [11] specifies that it is necessary 
to 
to  rebalance 
establish  a  communion 
through  a  mutual  effort  of 
understanding.  Thus,  the  doctor  will  have  to  understand 
the subjective condition of the person in front of them and 
treat the patient regardless of their state, as an existence 
with a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, the patient will 
have to understand the meaning of the therapeutic act, to 
accept  it  with  conviction  and  accept  its  efficiency  and 
usefulness. 

Under  the  given  circumstances,  the  relationship 
between  the  two  parts  must,  in  time,  become  a  special 
and  true  one,  because  the  glue  is  a  disease,  which 
determines a  particular  behavior.  The  way each  part  will 
play  their  role  can  create  the  premises  for  a  satisfactory 
and  efficient  relationship,  or  for  a  suspicious,  frustrating 
and disappointing one [12]. Communication facilitates the 
establishment of a doctor-patient trust relationship, a real 
therapeutic  alliance,  with  a  purpose  of  improving  the 
health  status  of  the  patient  and  the  doctor's  prestige, 
generally grown in the private and medical unit.  

Another feature of the communication within the 
doctor-patient relationship is the fact that this relationship 
is direct, being carried out face to face, without the need 
of  an  intermediary  and  a  meaningless  formalism.  The 
patient comes to the doctor with the hope that he will be 
understood  and  that  his  suffering  will  relieved,  that  the 
doctor  will  be  competent  and  will  deal  with  his  personal 
health. Between the two, there is a continuous exchange 
of  information,  which  will  lead  to  the  achievement  of  the 
objectives proposed and to finding out some answers on 
the  state  of  the  disease  and  its  evaluation,  the  therapy 
proposed  for  its  elimination  and  practical  intervention 
procedures.  This  type  of  connection  provides  a  real 
physical  power  over  the  medical  team  and  the  patient's 
psyche. [13].

Communication  in  the  medical  act  is  an  active 
process of transmission and reception of information, and, 
at least one of the partners of communication must have 
active listening skills, understanding of the message, and

towards 
improving  their  health.  The  quality  of  the  information 
obtained  by  the  doctor  during  consultations  is  closely 
linked  to  the  communication  skills  of  the  doctor  and  the 
patient.  In  literature,  it  is  mentioned  that  the  listening, 
explaining,  and  empathizing  skills  of  the  clinician  can 
have a profound effect on the patient’s health status and 
functioning,  as  well  as  on  their  satisfaction  regarding 
health care in the medical establishment [16, 17].

the 

In  the  communication  with  the  patient,  listening 
and  time  (availability)  are  elements  that  must  maintain 
attention to the speaker, regardless of the affective status, 
mode of cognitive operation. “Knowing to listen” is the first 
rule  of  the  dialogue  [18].  A  number  of  rules  have  to  be 
met  for  the  listening  to  be  efficient and  profitable  for  the 
doctors.  It  needs  to  be  active,  total,  empathic,  receptive 
and with a certain criticism [19]. 

First, the listening must be active, which involves 
besides mental participation (attention and concentration) 
also  a  physical  mobilization.  For  example,  a  too  relaxed 
body  posture  makes  memorizing  and  understanding 
difficult, while relatively uncomfortable positions generate 
a vigilant status propitious for good listening.  

At  the  same  time,  listening  must  be  total, 
meaning  that  in  addition  to  receiving  and  understanding 
the verbal message, particular attention must be given to 
the  non-verbal  component  (gesture  signals).  Thus,  if  the 
two partners of dialogue are positioned at the same level 
they will communicate better. In a dialogue, it is advisable 
to adopt an open, patient, and calm attitude amongst the 
conversation  partners.  Eye  contact  must  be  maintained, 
but not unnatural. Facial expression must be monitored so 
that  the  patient  does  not  feel  concerned,  frustrated,  or 
unmotivated. The listener must be empathic. Starting with 
self-awareness  and  continuing  with  other  sightings,  this 
cognitive  and  affective  process  allows  the  doctor  to 
understand  what 
to 
encourage  them  to  express  themselves  openly  and 
unrestrained. Empathy involves not just a mere sympathy 
or intuition of the patient's emotions, but identification with 
their  feelings,  with  their  biological  and  psychological 
status [20].

the  doctor  during

The  speaker  expects  a  verbal  message  to 
provide  a  solution  to  an  uncertainty  or  to  confirm  an 
expectation.  This  message  must  be  accurate,  fair,  and 
appropriate to the situation of communication, informative, 
clear and prompt, respectful, without being unnecessarily 
formal,  and  without  forgetting  that  the  tone  of  voice 
matters [19]. Thus, any information offered to the patient 
removes a certain degree of uncertainty, and clarity is an 
example of a healthy way of thinking, as well as a proof of 
respect and a way to assume responsibility. Tangled and 
confusing answers affect the relationship. Located in front 
of the patient, the doctor aims to define the disease and to 
organize all the stages of the establishment of diagnosis 
and  treatment.  The  oscillation,  hesitation,  or  excessive 
delay  in  offering  a  solution  has  a  negative  influence  on 
their relationship, the reaction being an essential condition 
of its effectiveness.

which  any  medical  act  becomes  stressful 
[22]. 
Communication with the patient must be suitable to their 
status,  insight  and  possibilities  associated  with  elements 
of  support  of  a  positive  relationship.  The  acquirement  of 
strong communication skills, necessary for the purpose of 
establishing

requires  profound  medical  knowledge  to  diagnose  and 
treat  disease,  the  ability  to  gather  information  from  the 
patient, interpersonal skills to respond to the feelings and 
concerns  of  the  patient  and  the  ability  to  create  and 
maintain a therapeutic relationship as a concrete offer of 
information and medical education [15].

The  good  philosophical  training,  psychological 
and  pedagogical  approaches  require  that  the  doctor  be 
able to analyze the multitude of information and feelings, 
mindsets and reactions so that they can diagnose not only 
the health state but also the patient's typology level, their 
cultural  and  mental  state.  At  the  same  time,  they  must

In the context of the communication relationship 
between  the  medical  staff  and  the  patient-customer, 
compliance  with  professional  ethics  is  required,  the  two 
parts being owed to their status of collaborators and not a 
distinction between the vanquished and the victors. In the 
first half of the twentieth century, the Spanish professor B. 
Masci  [23]  developed  the  most  elevated  moral,  medical 
document with the rules of medical ethics and deontology, 
which  will  always  be  respected  and  that  sums  up  as  it 
follows: 

1.  Honor your patient regardless of age. 
2.  Offer  the  same  gratitude  and  attention  to  the 

poor as to the rich. 

3.  Respect your noble mission, beginning with your 

very own person. 

their illness. 

6.  Never  forget  that  the  secret  entrusted  to  you 
about a disease is something holy that cannot be 
betrayed, offered to another person. 

7.  Do not see in your patients' worries a burden, a 

chore. 

8.  Never show incongruence at the success of the 

treatment on a sick person. 

9.  Not  only  benevolence  but  also  science 

is 

required in the care of the sick. 

10.  Do  not  discuss  medical  prescriptions  with  the 
patient  and  never  contradict  them.  You  take 
away  their  confidence  in  medicine;  you  destroy 
their hope of healing. 
The efficiency of communication is dependent on 
what  type  of  relationship  is  established between  the  two 
partners, and the type of relationship, in turn, depends on 
the  personality  of  each  one  of  them  [5].  The  doctors 
determine  their  personality  traits,  having  the  freedom  to 
choose their way of action so that the relationship with the 
patient  is  beneficial  for  both  sides.  In  the  healthcare 
system,  communication  becomes  increasingly  more  of  a 
therapeutic 
that  creates

fundamental relationships and that can provide benefits to 
those involved, considerations for which the appropriation 
of high communicative skills must be a priority for health 
professionals.
