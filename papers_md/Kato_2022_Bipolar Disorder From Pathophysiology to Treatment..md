　Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that involves a manic or hypomanic state and a depressive state, and was once called 
manic-depressive  disorder  and  was  considered  one  of  the  two  major  mental  disorders  along  with  schizophrenia.  Major 
depressive disorder, on the other hand, is a disorder in which only depressive states occur, and the two are sometimes referred 
to  together  as  “mood  disorders.  This  review  will  introduce  the  pathophysiology,  diagnosis,  epidemiology,  and  treatment  of 
bipolar disorder, focusing on the current situation in Japan.

Key words:  depression, mania, lithium, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants

Introduction

Symptoms

Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric disorder charac-
terized  by  recurrent  manic  or  hypomanic  and 
depressive states, and was formerly called “manic- 
depressive illness” and was considered one of two 
major  psychiatric  disorders  along  with  schizo-
phrenia. Major depressive disorder is a disorder in 
which only the depressed state occurs. The two are 
sometimes  referred  to  together  as  “mood  disor-
ders”,  though  DSM-5  discarded  this  category 
because bipolar disorder also shares some features 
with schizophrenia. One manic episode is sufficient 
for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, whereas at 
least one hypomanic episode and one major depres-
sive  episode  are  necessary  for  the  diagnosis  of 
bipolar II disorder. 

 In this review, pathophysiology, diagnosis, epide-
miology  and  treatment  of  bipolar  disorder  are 
summarized, and the current situation in Japan is 
also introduced.

Bipolar  disorder 

is  characterized  by 

two 
contrasting  mental  states,  that  is,  manic  or  hypo-
manic episodes and depressive episodes. Between 
these  episodes,  patients  experience  euthymic, 
remission states. 

Manic state

In the manic state of bipolar I disorder, a patient 
moves  around  without  sleeping  and  continues  to 
talk without rest, and because of this, the family is 
exhausted.  While  being  active,  the  patient  cannot 
focus on one thing and cannot work efficiently. In 
addition, it is common for a manic patient to make 
expensive purchases, make large amounts of debt, 
or cause legal problems. In many cases, they lose 
their social credibility by making unreasonable efforts 
that are likely to fail. It may develop into a gran-
diose delusion such as having supernatural powers.
In a manic state, the patient is often unaware of 
his or her changes and feels refreshed and in better 
shape  than  usual,  so  even  if  he  or  she  is  having

ness that he or she is in trouble or annoys others. 

Hypomanic state

On  the  other  hand,  in  the  hypomanic  state  of 
bipolar II disorder, the patient is energetic as if he 
or she has changed from the usual, becomes active 
in  human  relations,  moves  around  without  hesita-
tion  even  after  a  short  period  of  sleep,  and  looks 
clearly “high” to those around him or her compared 
to the usual. However, they do not cause trouble to 
the people around them as in a manic state.

Depressive state

While  the  manic  state  is  the  most  troubling 
symptom for the family, the depressive state is the 
most  painful  for  the  patient.  The  two  core  symp-
toms of depression are “depressed mood,” which is 
a  feeling  of  inexpressible  annoyance  that  lasts  all 
day, every day, and “loss of interest and pleasure,” 
which  is  a  loss  of  interest  in  everything  and  the 
inability  to  feel  happy  or  joyful  in  anything.  The 
presence of at least one of these two symptoms is 
considered necessary for diagnosis.

Including these two essential symptoms, depres-
sion  is  defined  as  the  daily  occurrence  of  five  or 
more  of  the  various  symptoms  of  depression  for 
two  weeks  or  more,  such  as  sleep  disturbance, 
decreased  or  increased  appetite  (and  weight  loss 
or gain), fatigue, psychomotor retardation (slowing 
down of movements), guilty feeling, loss of concen-
tration, and suicidal thoughts.

Clinical course

In bipolar disorder, there is often an interval of 
about five years between the first episode (depres-
sion or mania) and the next. During the remission 
state,  when  mania  and  depression  have  subsided, 
there are no symptoms, but if preventive therapy 
is not used, relapse will occur in most cases. If left 
untreated,  the  inter-episode  interval  gradually 
shortens  over  time1),  and  if  the  disease  shifts  to 
rapid cycling (four or more episodes per year), it 
becomes difficult to respond to pharmacotherapy.

Comparing the duration of the manic state and 
depressive  state,  the  duration  of  the  depressive 
state is longer, and the patient is often unaware of 
the  manic  or  hypomanic  state,  so  many  patients 
visit  the  clinic  in  a  depressed  state.  However,  in 

18

many cases, patients do not tell their doctors about 
their  previous  manic  or  hypomanic  states  at  the 
time of their visit, in which case they are diagnosed 
with major depressive disorder and do not receive 
appropriate treatment.

Bipolar  disorder  is  a  serious  illness  that  can  be 
life-threatening  in  its  depressive  state  due  to 
suicide  and  socially  life-threatening  in  its  manic 
state due to the consequences of its behavior. On 
the other hand, bipolar patients are also known to 
be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and 
cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death 
in bipolar patients2).

Epidemiology

Worldwide,  bipolar  I  disorder  is  considered  to 
affect  around  1%  of  the  population,  and  2-3%  if 
both bipolar I and II are included1).

On  the  other  hand,  in  Japan,  epidemiological 
studies  large  enough  to  estimate  the  prevalence 
have  not  been  conducted,  and  the  lifetime  preva-
lence  of  bipolar  I  and  II  patients  combined  is 
reported to be about 0.16 to 0.6%3-5), which is lower 
than in Europe and the United States. In the United 
States, the prevalence of bipolar disorder is lower 
in Asians compared with other ethnicities, suggesting 
that  different  genetic  backgrounds  may  underlie 
this difference5).

It is reported that 16% of patients who are being 
treated for the depressive state are bipolar disorder6), 
which is a higher percentage than the difference in 
lifetime prevalence (lifetime prevalence of depres-
sion  is  about  15%  worldwide  and  about  7%  in 
Japan). This may be because, unlike depression, in 
which about a half of the patients experience only 
a  single  episode  for  a  lifetime,  bipolar  disorder  is 
characterized  by  multiple  recurrent  manic  and 
depressive episodes.

Diagnosis

Bipolar disorder is classified into two categories 
based on the degree of mood elevation. The manic 
state is so severe that it interferes with family and 
work  and  requires  hospitalization;  On  the  other 
hand, the hypomanic state is a state of mood eleva-
tion  in  which  the  person  is  clearly  different  from 
the person as usual but is not so severe to require 
hospitalization.

Bipolar  disorder  with  a  manic  state  is  called 

Kato T: Bipolar Disorderbipolar  I  disorder.  Even  in  cases  where  the  only 
manic  state  is  observed,  a  depressive  state  often 
appears in the course of the disease, and the diag-
nosis  of  bipolar  I  disorder  is  made  even  when  no 
depressive state is seen7).

On  the  other  hand,  bipolar  disorder  with  both 
hypomanic  state  and  depressive  state  is  called 
bipolar II disorder.

If  left  untreated,  bipolar  I  disorder  can  lead  to 
multiple  cycles  of  manic  and  depressive  states, 
during  which  the  foundation  of  one’s  life,  such  as 
relationships,  social  trust,  work  and  family,  is 
greatly damaged. However, treatment and coping 
strategies  for  bipolar  disorder  have  been  formu-
lated, and in many cases, it is possible to control the 
illness and lead a social life.

When  a  depressive  patient  visits  a  clinic,  the 
criteria for a depressive episode are checked after 
ruling  out  depression  due  to  general  medical 
diseases or depression due to substances or drugs. 
In addition, the presence or absence of a history of 
manic or hypomanic states should be checked. To 
diagnose major depressive disorder, it is necessary 
to  confirm  the  absence  of  a  history  of  manic  or 
hypomanic states. However, it is not easy to accu-
rately diagnose past hypomania, and the diagnosis 
of  bipolar  II  disorder,  in  particular,  tends  to  vary 
among  doctors8).  The  depressive  state  of  bipolar 
disorder  is  characterized  by  a  family  history  of 
bipolar disorder, young age of onset (less than 25 
years old), and psychotic symptoms (e.g., auditory 
hallucinations, delusions)9), but these alone cannot 
be used to diagnose bipolar disorder, and there is 
still no test that can help differentiate between the 
two. In Japan, near-infrared spectroscopy (optical 
topography) is covered by insurance as an aid in 
the differential diagnosis of depression, but there is 
little  evidence  that  this  method  is  actually  useful 
for  differential  diagnosis,  and  worldwide,  this 
method is not considered to be useful for differenti-
ating depression from bipolar disorder10). Although 
many other biomarkers for differentiating depres-
sion and bipolar disorder have been studied, none 
have been confirmed in multiple studies and have 
established diagnostic significance11).

Both  manic  and  depressive  states  may  present 
with  psychotic  states  such  as  delusions,  auditory 
hallucinations, or catatonic states such as stupor.

When manic states first appear, it may be diffi-

cult  to  distinguish  them  from  schizophrenia  if 
psychotic symptoms are in the foreground. In addi-
tion,  patients  who  initially  present  with  a  short-
term psychotic disorder may subsequently develop 
bipolar disorder.

Treatment

Treatment goals

In the treatment of the major depressive disorder, 
the goal is to cure the depressive state, and in most 
cases, the treatment is terminated after about one 
year of recovery. On the other hand, in the case of 
bipolar  disorder,  the  manic  and  depressive  states 
will eventually be cured even if left untreated, but 
the  manic  and  depressive  states  recur  in  most 
cases, so the goal of treatment is to prevent these 
episodes,  and  the  key  to  treatment  is  how  to 
prevent the manic and depressive states after they 
are cured. If treatment is stopped after the manic 
state is ameliorated, relapse will occur repeatedly, 
resulting in significant social damage and may also 
cause cognitive dysfunction12).

It is not easy to continue medication for a lifetime 
in  a  state  of  remission  when  symptoms  have 
subsided,  and  a  combination  of  pharmacotherapy 
and psychosocial intervention that promotes accep-
tance  of  the  disease  is  necessary.  Patients  go 
through various stages before accepting the disease, 
such  as  doubting  the  doctor’s  diagnosis,  doctor 
shopping  searching  for  another,  better  diagnosis, 
self-stigma, and anxiety about relapse. Therefore, 
it is important to monitor how the patient perceives 
the disease and to provide psychotherapeutic treat-
ment according to the stage of the disease.

Pharmacotherapy

Medications  other  than  antipsychotics  used  in 
the treatment of bipolar disorder are called mood 
stabilizers.  The  mood  stabilizers  used  in  Japan 
include lithium and three antiepileptic drugs: lamo-
trigine, valproate, and carbamazepine13).

Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, olan-
zapine, and aripiprazole are also used. In addition 
to  these  drugs,  the  atypical  antipsychotic  lurasi-
done was approved in Japan in 2020 as an effective 
treatment  for  depressive  symptoms  in  bipolar 
disorder14). In addition, aripiprazole for long-acting 
injection has a new indication for the prevention of 
recurrent manic episodes in bipolar I disorder15).

Juntendo Medical Journal 68(1), 2022Lithium

Lithium is the basic drug used in the pharmaco-
therapy  of  bipolar  disorder  and  is  listed  as  the 
first-line drug in the treatment guidelines of many 
countries and it is included in the WHO Model List 
of  Essential  Medicines  (https://list.essentialmeds.
org/). In Japan, lithium carbonate is used. Lithium 
is  effective  in  improving  manic  and  depressive 
states, preventing recurrence of manic and depres-
sive states, and preventing suicide. However, lithium 
is associated with many side effects, and because of 
the proximity of the safe and toxic concentrations, 
regular measurement of blood levels is necessary. 
Blood levels should be measured at the beginning 
of treatment and once every two to three months 
after  stabilization.  The  effective  blood  level  is 
between 0.4 and 1.2 mM, and toxicity is more likely 
to occur when the level exceeds 1.5 mM.

Side  effects  such  as  diarrhea,  anorexia,  thirst, 
polydipsia,  and  polyuria  are  seen  when  lithium  is 
started. Hand tremor may persist even in the effec-
tive  concentration  range.  In  the  case  of  intoxica-
tion, various symptoms appear, such as cerebellar 
ataxia, gait disturbance, consciousness disturbance, 
and  vomiting.  Since  hypothyroidism  is  often 
observed,  TSH,  free  T3,  and  free  T4  should  be 
checked  regularly.  Even  if  hypothyroidism  is 
observed,  lithium  treatment  can  be  continued  by 
taking thyroid hormone.

Since  concomitant  use  of  non-steroidal  anti-in-
flammatory  drugs  may  increase  lithium  blood 
levels, attention should also be paid to concomitant 
medications. Lithium toxicity is more likely to occur 
during  dehydration.  Long-term  use  of  the  drug 
may  cause  renal  dysfunction  due  to  interstitial 
nephritis,  etc.  Therefore,  a  regular  check  of  renal 
function is necessary. Calcium levels should also be 
measured  periodically  while  taking  lithium,  as 
lithium may cause hyperparathyroidism.

Lithium is contraindicated in pregnancy in Japan 
due to the increased risk of cardiovascular malfor-
mations in the fetus when taken during pregnancy, 
but it has been reported that there is no significant 
increase in risk when the dose is 600 mg or less per 
day16),  and  revisions  to  the  drug  information  are 
expected.

Various  other  side  effects  have  also  been 
reported, but due to the limited availability of medi-

20

cations  for  the  treatment  of  bipolar  disorder,  we 
should not give up easily when side effects occur 
and consider measures to minimize them.

Anticonvulsants

Among the anticonvulsants used as mood stabi-
lizers, lamotrigine alone is indicated for the mainte-
nance treatment of bipolar disorder in Japan. It is 
effective in preventing relapses and recurrences of 
all episodes, but the main effect of lamotrigine is to 
prevent depressive episodes.

Valproic acid has been shown to be effective in 
manic states. Clinical trials of its prophylactic effect 
have  not  been  successful,  and  it  does  not  show  a 
significant prophylactic effect against placebo, and 
its prophylactic effect is reported to be inferior to 
that of lithium, but it is also used as a prophylactic 
drug  in  clinical  practice  because  meta-analyses 
suggest its efficacy. 

Carbamazepine  was  found  to  have  an  effect  on 
manic  states  in  Japan.  Some  small  trials  are 
suggesting a prophylactic effect, but the evidence 
is insufficient. 

Of  these  antiepileptic  drugs,  valproic  acid  and 
carbamazepine are indicated by insurance for the 
measurement  of  blood  levels  under  the  name  of 
manic-depressive illness.

Antipsychotics

For the manic state of bipolar I disorder, many 
atypical and typical antipsychotics have been effec-
tive, as well as lithium, valproate, and carbamaze-
pine.

For the depressive state of bipolar disorder, three 
atypical antipsychotics, quetiapine, olanzapine, and 
lurasidone, have been shown to be effective and are 
indicated in Japan.

Although not covered by insurance, prophylactic 
effects  have  been  shown  for  olanzapine,  aripipra-
zole,  and  quetiapine.  The  prophylactic  effect  of 
quetiapine is mainly for the prevention of depres-
sion. In addition, sustained injection of aripiprazole 
has  been  shown  to  prevent  relapses  and  recur-
rences  of  bipolar  disorder  and  was  covered  by 
insurance in 2020. The preventive effect of aripip-
razole is only for the prevention of manic states.

Psychotherapy

Psychotherapy alone is not effective in treating 

Kato T: Bipolar Disorderbipolar  disorder.  However,  psycho-education  is 
essential to help the patient understand the illness 
and  to  encourage  and  assist  acceptance  of  the 
illness by paying attention to the patient’s mental 
reactions  to  it17).  Psycho-education  aims  to  help 
patients understand the nature of the disease, the 
effects and side effects of medications, as well as to 
help them and their families understand and share 
what the first signs of relapse are. Therefore, it is 
important to discuss and confirm the initial signs of 
relapse  with  the  family  and  share  them  with  the 
patient  and  the  family.  It  is  also  meaningful  to 
predict in advance the stressors that are likely to 
trigger relapse and to learn how to cope with them.
It is also important to keep a regular life in the 
treatment  of  bipolar  disorder,  as  even  one-night 
sleep deprivation can trigger a manic state. Inter-
personal  social  rhythm  therapy  is  reported  to  be 
effective in preventing episodes in bipolar disorder. 
However, it is difficult to receive this treatment in 
Japan,  and  usually,  the  essence  of  social  rhythm 
therapy  is  included  in  psychoeducation;  e.g., 
avoiding staying up all night, get some sunlight in 
the morning, light exercise such as taking a walk in 
the morning, and avoiding excessive social stimula-
tion when the mood is unstable.

Cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT),  which  is 
widely used for depression, has also been reported 
to  be  effective  in  preventing  the  recurrence  of 
bipolar disorder. CBT is available at least in urban 
areas in Japan.

Etiology

Bipolar  disorder  has  a  higher  concordance  rate 
in  monozygotic  twins  than  in  dizygotic  twins,  so 
there is no doubt that genomic factors are involved18). 
On the other hand, even in monozygotic twins with 
almost  the  same  genome,  not  all  of  them  develop 
the  disease,  and  it  is  considered  that  non-genetic 
factors  such  as  environmental  factors  are  also 
involved19).  Perinatal  factors,  such  as  perinatal 
complications,  influenza  infection  during  preg-
nancy,  and  smoking  of  mothers,  are  reported  as 
environmental  factors  that  pose  a  risk  of  bipolar 
disorder. Early developmental adversity has been 
reported to have a negative impact on symptoms 
and course. Stress is said to trigger the onset and 
recurrence, but it cannot be said to be the cause.

Genome research

As  mentioned  above,  genome-wide  association 
studies (GWAS) have been conducted because of 
the  involvement  of  genetic  factors  in  bipolar 
disorder20).  Sixty-four  relevant  genomic  loci  were 
identified  in  a  GWAS  of  41,917  bipolar  patients21). 
Among  these,  FADS2  (Fatty  Acid  Desaturase  2) 
and FADS1, which were first found in a GWAS of 
approximately 3,000 Japanese patients22), are genes 
for enzymes involved in the metabolism of unsatu-
rated  fatty  acids,  and  their  reduced  activity  has 
been  associated  with  bipolar  disorder.  In  addition 
to  the  calcium  (Ca2+)  channel  gene  CACNA1C, 
which  was  one  of  the  first  genes  found  in  the 
GWAS for bipolar disorder, a new association was 
found  with  another  Ca2+  channel  gene,  CACNB2. 
The risk genes for bipolar disorder included many 
genes  involved  in  synapses,  Ca2+  signaling,  and 
neurogenesis.  In  addition,  many  genes  encoding 
target proteins of antipsychotics, antiepileptic drugs, 
and other drugs were included.

We performed exome analysis in 354 trio families 
(patients and their parents) of bipolar disorder and 
analyzed  de  novo  mutations,  i.e.,  mutations  that 
were not present in the parents23). As a result, we 
found that de novo mutations were more common 
in genes with few loss-of-function mutations in the 
general  population.  The  loss-of-function  de  novo 
mutations  were  more  common  in  genes  such  as 
presynaptic active zones and ion channels. In addi-
tion,  somatic  mosaic  mutations  were  frequently 
found  in  genes  that  cause  neurodevelopmental 
disorders,  indicating  that  the  presence  of  genes 
that  cause  neurodevelopmental  disorders  in  a 
somatic  mosaic  state  may  be  a  risk  factor  for 
bipolar disorder.

Neurobiological studies

Although  various  pathological  hypotheses  for 
bipolar  disorder  have  been  proposed,  the  calcium 
hypothesis, which has been previously reported to 
be  associated  with  high  intracellular  Ca2+  levels 
and has been found to be relevant in recent genomic 
studies, is the most likely. However, since intracel-
lular Ca2+ affects many cells, it is difficult to under-
stand the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder by itself11).
We  have  been  focusing  on  the  relationship 
between  mitochondria  and  bipolar  disorder  based 

21

Juntendo Medical Journal 68(1), 2022on the results of magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
in  bipolar  disorder  patients  showing  impaired 
energy  metabolism  and  high  levels  of  mitochon-
drial  DNA  (mtDNA)  mutations  in  postmortem 
brains of patients. It has been reported that patients 
with  mitochondrial  diseases  have  a  high  rate  of 
bipolar disorder (around 20%)24).

Therefore,  we  created  transgenic  mice  that 
express  a  mutant  of  polymerase  gamma  (Polg, 
mtDNA synthetase), one of the genes responsible 
for  mitochondrial  disease,  only  in  the  brain.  The 
mice exhibited recurrent hypoactive episodes that 
lasted about two weeks25). This condition occurred 
on  average  once  every  six  months,  and  detailed 
behavioral analysis showed that they met the diag-
nostic  criteria  for  a  depressive  episode  (loss  of 
interest, sleep disturbance, increased appetite, slow 
movements, fatigability, and impaired social behavior). 
During  lithium  treatment,  these  episodes  became 
less  frequent,  and  the  patients  showed  increased 
corticosteroids  during  the  episodes.  In  addition, 
tricyclic antidepressants caused manic-like behav-
ioral changes.

To  clarify  the  brain  region  responsible  for  this 
hypoactivity,  we  searched  for  brain  regions  with 
high accumulation of mtDNA mutations and found 
the  highest  accumulation  in  the  paraventricular 
thalamic  nucleus  (PVT).  When  we  manipulated 
the  neuronal  circuits  of  the  PVT  in  mice,  similar 
hypo-active  episodes  appeared,  suggesting  that 
the  depression  in  the  model  mice  was  caused  by 
dysfunction of the PVT.

The PVT receives strong projections from sero-
tonergic  neurons  and  is  a  brain  region  with  high 
serotonin concentration. It is unique in that it proj-
ects to both the amygdala, which is involved in the 
fear, negative emotion and the nucleus accumbens, 
which is involved in the reward, positive emotion26).
In another mouse model of mitochondrial disease 
(Ant1  mutant  mice),  serotonin  neurons  showed 
hyperexcitability27).  Hyperexcitability 
also 
suggested  in  a  study  of  neurons  derived  from 
induced  pluripotent  cells  of  patients  with  bipolar 
disorder28). Neurons in the PVT may also be hyper-
excitable in the mutant POLG mice described above. 
If  overexcitability  of  the  serotonin  neuron-PVT 
system  is  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  bipolar 
disorder, we may be able to understand the patho-
genesis of this disorder, which presents depressive 

is 

22

and manic states in which both negative and posi-
tive emotions are extremely enhanced.

These  findings  suggest  the  entire  picture  of 
bipolar disorder. Genomic factors result in impaired 
intracellular Ca2+ regulation, which leads to hyper-
excitability  of  emotion-related  neural  circuits, 
resulting in impaired emotion/cognition balance11).
The gene that regulates excitability in the PVT 
is a T-type Ca2+ channel, and valproic acid is known 
to be its inhibitor.

Among the serotonin receptors, serotonin 5-HT7 
receptors have a characteristic distribution of being 
abundant in the PVT29), and it is noteworthy that 
lurasidone is a blocker of serotonin 5-HT7 receptors.

Mechanism of action of therapeutic agents

The  most  common  theory  of  the  mechanism  of 
action of lithium is inhibition of inositol monophos-
phatase  (IMPase).  Inhibition  of  IMPase  causes 
intracellular depletion of inositol, resulting in dimin-
ished  agonist-stimulated 
inositol  phospholipid 
metabolism,  which  results  in  attenuation  of  intra-
cellular Ca2+ mobilization. It is also suggested that 
GSK-3β  inhibition  also  plays  a  role  in  lithium’s 
action. 

In a study that screened compounds that inhibit 
IMPase,  a  drug  called  ebselen  was  found,  and 
recently  it  was  suggested  that  ebselen  may  be 
effective  in  the  manic  state  of  bipolar  disorder30), 
which may support the theory that the mechanism 
of action of lithium is via IMPase inhibition.

On the other hand, for antiepileptic drugs, many 
attempts  have  been  made  to  search  for  common 
effects  with  lithium,  and  intriguing  results  were 
obtained. However, no consensus has been reached. 
Recent  genomic  studies  have  found  associations 
with  genes  involved  in  neuronal  excitability, 
including Ca2+ channels, and iPS cells derived from 
bipolar disorder patients28), as well as our studies in 
animal models, have indicated hyperexcitability of 
neurons. It makes sense to think that these antiepi-
leptic  drugs  are  acting  by  modulating  neuronal 
excitability, similarly to their action to epilepsy.

Most antipsychotics antagonize the dopamine D2 
receptor, which is thought to be the major mode of 
action  for  schizophrenia.  Most  antipsychotics  are 
also effective in manic states, and their effects on 
manic  states  are  also  thought  to  be  mediated  by 
dopamine  D2  receptor  antagonism.  Atypical  anti-

Kato T: Bipolar Disorderpsychotics  have  fewer  extrapyramidal  symptoms 
through  a  variety  of  mechanisms,  but  it  is  still 
unclear why some atypical antipsychotics are effec-
tive  for  depressive  states  in  bipolar  disorder  and 
others  are  not.  Olanzapine,  quetiapine,  and  lurasi-
done,  which  are  atypical  antipsychotics  effective 
for  depression  in  bipolar  disorder,  all  are  antago-
nists of serotonin receptors, which may be involved 
in their mechanism of action.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a treatment that 
normalizes  the  cognitive  patterns  that  predispose 
to  depression,  such  as  overgeneralization  and  all- 
or-nothing thinking. These characteristic cognitive 
patterns  are  the  very  characteristic  information 
processing  of  emotions,  and  cognitive  behavioral 
therapy  may  normalize  the  emotion/cognition 
balance. Currently, lithium, antiepileptic drugs, atyp-
ical antipsychotics, and cognitive-behavioral therapy 
are often used in combination in clinical situations, 
and they are thought to act at different points in 
the pathophysiological pathway of bipolar disorder.
