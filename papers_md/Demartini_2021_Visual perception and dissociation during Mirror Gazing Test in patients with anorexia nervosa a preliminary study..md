Abstract
Purpose  It has been widely shown that dissociative features might play a fundamental role in producing body image distor-
tions in patients affected by eating disorders. Here, we hypothesize that the Mirror Gazing Test (MGT), a task consisting 
in mirror exposure in a condition of sensory deprivation, would elicit dissociative symptoms in a group of patients with 
anorexia nervosa (AN).
Methods  Fourteen patients with AN and fourteen healthy controls (HC) underwent a 10 min MGT and completed the Strange 
Face Questionnaire and a short version of the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, along with a psychological 
assessment for eating disorders psychopathology, anxiety and depression.
Results  AN patients reported a higher number of strange-face apparitions and dissociative sensations than HC during the 
MGT. Dissociative identity (compartmentalization of two or more identities) and depersonalization (detachment of bodily-
self) were much higher in patients with AN than in HC. These findings were correlated with body dissatisfaction and disrup-
tion in interoceptive awareness.
Conclusion  Dissociation and body image dysfunction are strongly connected in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa. 
Future research should investigate the same aspects in other psychiatric conditions characterized by body image distortions, 
such as Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

Introduction

Body image is commonly defined as “the picture of our own 
body which we form in our mind” [1], as it appears when 
observed in a third-person perspective. It can be considered 
a multidimensional construct, implying both bottom-up (vis-
ual and proprioceptive information) and top–down facets 
(such as memory, mood states, affects, attitudes and beliefs 
concerning appearance). With respect to body image disrup-
tion, two facets are traditionally distinguished: perceptual 
distortion and body dissatisfaction [2, 3]. Perceptual distor-
tion is defined as the inability to accurately perceive one’s 
body size, and it is usually measured through visual tasks; 
body dissatisfaction represents the extent to which people 
are satisfied with their bodies’ size and shape and it is com-
monly measured by rating scales and questionnaires [4, 5]. 
Body image disruptions emerge in different neuropsychiatric 
disorders and conditions, such as Eating Disorders (ED) and

Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Signs of body image 
disruptions in ED frequently emerge during self-gazing: it is 
reported that when looking at their own body, women with 
anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa attended more 
to their self-identified most unattractive body part than to 
their self-identified most attractive body part, contrary to 
healthy controls (HC) [6]. Patients with ED, moreover, tend 
to present stronger negative affect than HC during the course 
of a mirror exposure [7–9]. Following this framework, the 
Allocentric Lock Theory tried to explain the body image 
disruption seen in patients with ED: ED might be explained 
as being locked on a negative body image (e.g., my body is 
fat). This might be the result of an updated percept stored in 
the short-term memory (egocentric), which does not reach 
the long-term memory to allow for a change in body image 
as perceived from the outside (allocentric). Thus, the ability 
to encode and use visual information from the environment 
is impaired. Consequently, the egocentric sensory inputs 
are not able to update the contents of the allocentric rep-
resentation of the body, and so the person is locked into 
this distorted perception [10, 11]. The distortion of body 
image in ED might also be linked to perceptual biases, such 
as the visual body image adaptation (due to a pre-existing, 
long-lasting adaptation to thin body shapes in ED) [12] or 
the so-called serial dependence (a phenomenon occurring 
when errors in perceptual judgements are consistent with the 
assimilation of features of a previously viewed stimulus with 
the current stimulus) [13]. Moreover, from a neurobiologi-
cal perspective, it has been hypothesized that body image 
distortion in patients with AN could derive from abnormal 
functioning of the insula, an area of the brain that integrates 
interoceptive awareness, involving the sensory process of 
receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals 
[14, 15]. In particular, the activity of the anterior insula, 
which may represent motivational tendencies, but is also 
part of the fear and emotional network, has been found to be 
diminished in anorexic patients [16].

In the last decades, the hypothesis that dissociation might 
play a fundamental role in body image distortion, has been 
explored. It has been even hypothesized that body image 
distortion is a kind of psychoform dissociation, where the 
patient perceives his/her body in dimensions that are not 
real and idealises and fantasises about a body that usually 
does not match the real one [17]. The presence of disso-
ciative symptoms in ED is now well-established and is not 
limited to AN: dissociative amnesia, depersonalization and 
derealisation are common characteristics of binge-eating 
episodes [18]; dissociative tendencies represent important 
mediators between childhood abuse and all subtypes of eat-
ing disturbances, including subclinical ones [19]; moreover, 
patients with AN show significantly higher rates of dissocia-
tive features than HC; finally, it seems that patients with AN 
with a binge-eating/purging subtype present higher levels of 

dissociative symptoms than patients affected by AN restric-
tive subtype and than HC when assessed via self-report clin-
ical questionnaires [20]. However, despite the link between 
body image disruption and dissociative symptoms in ED, 
other possible correlates of dissociation, such as traumatic 
experiences, have been considered: Van IJzendoorn and 
Schuengel, in their meta-analysis, concluded that, in some 
patients, childhood abuse experiences might lead to an ED 
as well as to a dissociative disorder [21]. Moreover, it has 
been hypothesized that the heightened attention towards his/
her most unattractive body part might be a reflex of patient’s 
selective attention towards threats due to the presence of dis-
sociative features [22, 23]. Furthermore, Mussap and Salton 
[24] believe that dissociative processes, known to determine 
a disconnection of one’s sense of self, might be responsible 
for the variability in body size estimates. This hypothesis is 
further sustained by the study of Fuller-Tyszkiewicz et al. 
[23], which found a significative correlation between body 
image perception (assessed via a computer-based task) and 
dissociative symptoms, investigated via self-report question-
naires such as the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire in 
a non-clinical sample (student sample). This finding was rep-
licated also in clinical samples: Beato and colleagues found, 
through the administration of self-report questionnaires, dis-
sociation to be associated to the degree of dissatisfaction 
towards their body in a sample of patients with ED [25]. 
Nevertheless, one of the main limitations of these previous 
studies was the lack of an objective assessment of disso-
ciation and its subcomponents, which were evaluated only 
through self-report scales and not by experimental tasks.

Here we implemented a specific task, the Mirror Gaz-
ing Test (MGT) [26, 27], to assess dissociative symptoms, 
elicited by mirror exposure, in a group of AN patients. Spe-
cifically, the participant is asked to steadily look at his/her 
face image reflected in a mirror, in a dimly lit room for ten 
minutes. It has been reported that, during the MGT, sev-
eral visual illusions occur (such as deformations of one’s 
own face, a relative’s face with some changed features or 
an unknown person’s face; an archetypal or an animal face), 
often accompanied by dissociative phenomena (i.e., the 
feeling that the reflected face did not belong to themselves 
anymore plus the feeling of being watched by “the strange 
other” from within or beyond the mirror) [28]. These sen-
sations physiologically occur in healthy subjects [26, 28], 
but seem to be strongly connected with psychopathological 
features, since they emerge more frequently in schizophrenic 
individuals [29] and in patients with functional neurologi-
cal disorders [30] and less frequently in depressed patients 
[31] when compared to HC. It has been hypothesized that 
strange-face apparitions might emerge during MGT, even 
in healthy subjects because of a disconnection of two fac-
ets of representations that are usually recruited together and 
allow self-recognition in the mirror: the one’s own embodied

self-representation (perceived through somesthetic, kines-
thetic, and proprioceptive signals) and the visual represen-
tation of one’s own face left–right reversed, as it usually 
appears in the mirror. During this unbinding process, the 
so-called “strange Other” (i.e., an alter- identity) appears 
in the mirror, watching the embodied self, thus producing a 
perception of dissociated self-identity [26]. Moreover, Shin 
et al. recently provided experimental evidences, with the use 
of the MGT on a sample of healthy individuals, for the short-
term alleviation (i.e., emotional numbing) of negative affect 
during acute dissociative states induced by the exposure to 
the MGT, which may serve as a coping mechanism for some 
individuals [31]. It is important to mention that self-identity 
dissociation during MGT is different from the kind of dis-
sociation found in patients suffering from dissociative iden-
tity disorder. In fact, during the MGT participants maintain 
embodied consciousness of themselves, while in patients 
suffering from dissociative identity disorder consciousness 
is lost and dissociative identity remains unconscious to the 
normal personality.

To summarise, the current study tested the presence of 
dissociative symptoms, elicited by mirror exposure via the 
MGT, in a group of anorexic patients. Given previous find-
ings showing that individuals with AN are characterized by 
body image disruption, that body image disruption is strictly 
linked to dissociative features and that dissociation, assessed 
by self-report questionnaires, is a common phenomenon in 
anorexic patients, we would expect patients with AN to pre-
sent an increased amount of strange face apparitions and 
dissociative sensations, elicited by the mirror exposure dur-
ing the MGT when compared to HC. Moreover, in the light 
of the well-established involvement of the insula function 
in the pathogenesis of AN, in this study we also tested the 
hypothesis that the increased amount of dissociative symp-
toms would be associated not only with body image disrup-
tions, but also with interoceptive awareness.

Methods

Participants

Fourteen out-patients with a diagnosis of AN were recruited 
from the Eating Disorder Outpatient Clinic of San Paolo 
General Hospital in Milan, Italy. Patients were enrolled in 
the study as soon as they came for the first evaluation and 
they did not previously receive any kind of treatment. They 
were compared with 14 HC, recruited from staff members, 
their friends and relatives, through advertisement and word 
of mouth. The HC “healthy state” was determined through 
a  specifically  designed  anamnestic  interview,  including 
questions on current medical history and the administration 
of the clinical interview Structured Clinical Interview for 

DSM-5 (SCID-5) [33]. Although some of the HC were staff 
members, none of them were aware of the study aim and 
protocol. Diagnosis of AN was made according to DSM-5 
diagnostic criteria. Other psychiatric, neurological or medi-
cal disorders were excluded through a complete anamnestic 
questionnaire and a clinical interview (SCID-5) [33]). Par-
ticipants of the two groups were Caucasian. The Body Mass 
Index (BMI) was calculated for every participant, with the 
following formula: weight/height2 kg/m2.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) age below 18 years 
and above 50 years; (ii) inability to understand the aim and 
the steps of the project due to cognitive impairment; (iii) any 
other serious psychiatric, neurological or medical illnesses; 
(iv) previous diagnosis of other ED (which might represent 
a confounding factor) for the patients with AN and of any 
ED for the HC; (v) a BMI > 18 for the patients with AN, and 
a BMI < 18 for the HC.

To take part in the study, all the participants signed an 
informed consent form with detailed study information. 
Every participant had the opportunity to ask for clarifica-
tion and explanation during each stage of the study and was 
free to interrupt and leave the experiment at any moment. 
The study was approved and registered by the ethics commit-
tee of ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Milan, Italy. The experi-
ment was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki.

Experimental protocol

MGT was conducted in a 5 m × 5 m room, with obscured 
windows. A mirror (0.5 m × 0.5 m) was mounted on a tripod 
in the centre of the room. Each subject seated in front of the 
mirror at a distance of 0.4 m; the only source of light of the 
whole room (a halogen light bulb, 20 W) was placed on the 
floor 1.2 m behind the subject (out of the participant’s visual 
field and of the mirror reflection). Illumination of the face 
(‘incident light’) was about 1 lx (measured with TES-1330 
A luxmeter). Each participant was instructed to keep staring 
into his/her own eyes for ten minutes. To double check that 
participants correctly performed the task, the experiment 
was seated in the room in a position, where he could see the 
participant, but where the participant could not see him. For 
further details about the procedure see Caputo et al. [29]. At 
the end of the session, participants completed the Strange 
Face Questionnaire (SFQ), an ad-hoc questionnaire assess-
ing anomalous sensation and anomalous perceptions they 
had looking in the mirror ([34]; for psychometric proper-
ties see [27]) and a short Italian version of the Clinician-
Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) [35]. The 
CADSS items were adapted to past-tense verbal sentences 
from the present tense of the original version.

The Strange Face Questionnaire is composed by 28 items 
describing  possible  sensations  or  perceptions  occurring 

1 31544

during the MGT, to be replied on a 5-point Likert scale 
(where 0 meant “I never experienced this sensation” and 4 
meant “I experienced this sensation almost always”). Item 
19 is a control item: thus, the questionnaire was considered 
valid only if the answer was 0, never. A total score, ranging 
from 0 to 108, was calculated by summing the answer to 
the other 27 items responses. The scoring procedure was 
as follows: firstly, number of answers “never” and number 
of answers ranging from 1 to 4 were counted, as an index 
of how many different apparitions and sensations occurred 
during the MGT (range: 0–27); secondly, a total score, rang-
ing from 0 to 108, was calculated. Finally, three subscales 
have been calculated and analysed: (i) Derealisation (sum-
ming items: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 16; total score ranging from 
0 to 32; example: “Did you seem to see that the face was 
deformed or some features of the face were deformed?”); 
(ii) Depersonalization (summing items: 14, 17, 18, 20, 22, 
23, 24; total score ranging from 0 to 28; example: “Did you 
seem to perceive a "presence" of something that does not 
physically exist?”); (iii) Dissociative Identity/Compartmen-
talization (summing items: 2, 7, 9, 12, 13, 21, 25, 26, 27; 
total score ranging from 0 to 36; example: “Did you seem 
to recognize another personality that you would not have 
expected?”). The three subscales of SFQ present good lev-
els of reliability and validity: SFQ-Derealisation (α = 0.73), 
SFQ-Depersonalization (α = 0.32), and SFQ-Dissociative 
Identity (α = 0.61) [27].

The short version of the Clinician-Administered Dissocia-
tive States Scale is composed by 19 items, to be replied on 
a 5-point Likert scale (0 being “never” and 4 being “almost 
always”). An overall total score, ranging from 0 to 76, was 
calculated by summing each single item’ response; moreo-
ver, the three following subscales were calculated and ana-
lysed: (i) Derealisation (summing items: 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19; total score ranging from 0 to 48; 
example: “did it seem like things were unreal, as if you were 
in a dream?”); (ii) Depersonalization (summing items: 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7; total score ranging from 0 to 20; example: “did 
it seem as if you were looking at things from outside your 
own body?”); (iii) Dissociative Amnesia (summing items: 
14, 15; total score ranging from 0 to 8; example: “did it seem 
like you were wandering with your own thoughts and/or los-
ing track of what was happening?”). The three subscales 
of CADSS present good levels of reliability and validity: 
CADSS-Derealisation (α = 0.64), CADSS-Depersonaliza-
tion (α = 0.62), and CADSS-Dissociative Amnesia (α = 0.33) 
[27]. Furthermore, participants completed the Eating Dis-
order Inventory-2 (EDI-2), assessing alimentary habits and 
clusters of symptoms deemed relevant for the understand-
ing and treatment of ED. The eight original subscales of 
the EDI-2 present high levels of reliability and validity (all 
α > 0.80). In particular, we selected and analysed the two 

subscales Body Dissatisfaction (α = 0.91) and Interoceptive 
Awareness (α = 0.84) [36, 37].

At the very end of the experiment we allowed the partici-
pants ten minutes to relax and ask questions before leaving 
the setting.

Data analysis

Data were analysed through the software SPSS (Statistical 
Package for Social Science), Version 25. Significance lev-
els were set at p < 0.05, two tailed. We did not have any 
missing data. First, reliability analysis was run to assess the 
internal consistency of each scale in our sample. Second, 
given the small sample size, non-parametric tests have been 
run. Specifically, Mann–Whitney U test was used to assess 
the differences between the two groups at the MGT ques-
tionnaires and at the psychological assessment. Categorical 
variables were analysed via Pearson Chi Square (χ2) test. 
To test the hypothesis that MGT-elicited dissociation would 
be associated with body image disruption and interoceptive 
awareness, a series of multiple linear regressions analysis 
was run, with the SFQ and the CADSS as dependent vari-
ables (DV) and with the following independent variables 
(IV): (i) the dichotomic variable Group, where 0 = HC and 
1 = patients with AN; (ii) BMI; (iii) the two EDI-2 subscales 
Body Dissatisfaction and Interoceptive Awareness. Given 
the involvement of 5 variables (1 DV, 4 IV), the lower limit 
of “two subjects per variable” for linear regression has been 
respected [38]; nonetheless, both R2 and adjusted R2 were 
reported.

Additionally, within the AN group only, Spearman’s cor-
relational analysis was run between the continuous variable 
Years of illness and the MGT variables to investigate pos-
sible covariations.

Results

Reliability analysis

Reliability analysis (Cronbach’s α) showed that the inter-
nal consistency within our sample of the MGT question-
naires was as follows: (i) SFQ Total Score: α = 0.787; (ii) 
SFQ Derealisation: α = 0.672; (iii) SFQ Depersonalization: 
α = 0.491; (iv) SFQ Dissociative Identity/Compartmentali-
zation: α  = 0.730; (v) CADSS Total Score: α  = 0.894; (vi) 
CADSS Derealisation: α = 0.758; (vii) CADSS Deperson-
alization; α = 0.828; (viii) CADSS Dissociative Amnesia: 
α = 0.444. Moreover, the internal consistency within our 
sample of the EDI-2 Total score was high (α = 0.973), as 
well as of both the EDI-2 subscales: (i) Body Dissatisfac-
tion: α = 0.891; (ii) Interoceptive Awareness: α = 0.895.

Demographic data

AN and HC samples were sex- (χ (1) = 3.360, p = 0.067) and 
age- (U (28) = 72,  p = 0.246) matched. Out of 14 patients 
recruited,  12  had  a  diagnosis  of  restrictive  subtype  AN 
and 2 of purging subtype AN. Disease duration was 11.73 
(± 11.17) years. Patients with AN and HC did not differ 
with respect to family psychiatric history (χ (1) = 0.622, 
p = 0.430). Analysis showed that, not only the current aver-
age BMI was different between the two groups (U (28) = 0, 
p < 0.001), but also the highest (U (28) = 29, p < 0.001) and 
the lowest BMI ever reached (U (28) = 0, p < 0.001). Demo-
graphic, experimental and psychological values are reported 
in Table 1.

Mirror Gazing Test (MGT)

The number of times participants had misperceptions by 
looking in the mirror, as assessed via the SFQ, differed 
between the two groups (U (28) = 166, p = 0.001) with AN 
patients having more strange-face anomalous perceptions/
experiences than HC. Patients with AN reported higher val-
ues than HC at the SFQ total score (U (28) = 166, p = 0.001); 
a significant difference between the two groups emerged at 
the SFQ subscale Dissociative Identity/Compartmentaliza-
tion (U (28) = 179.5, p < 0.001), with AN scoring higher than 

HC; a trend towards significance emerged also at the SFQ 
subscale Depersonalization (U (28) = 141, p = 0.050), again 
with AN scoring higher than HC, but no difference was 
detected at the Derealisation SFQ subscale (U (28) = 135.5, 
p = 0.085). Moreover, AN patients scored higher than HC at 
the CADSS total score (U (28) = 169.5, p < 0.001) and at all 
CADSS subscales: Derealisation: U (28) = 159, p = 0.004; 
Depersonalisation: U (28) = 177,  p < 0.001; Dissociative 
Amnesia: U (28) = 147, p = 0.024. Finally, patients with AN 
showed significantly higher values than HC at the EDI-2 
Total Score (U (28) = 193, p < 0.001) and at both the EDI-2 
subscales: (i) Body Dissatisfaction: U (28) = 177, p < 0.001; 
(ii) Interoceptive Awareness: U (28) = 193, p < 0.001.

Regression and correlational analysis

In  a  series  of  multiple  regressions,  neither  the  variable 
Group nor the variable BMI was associated with any of the 
MGT variables. The EDI-2 subscale Body Dissatisfaction 
was positively correlated to the SFQ subscale Derealiza-
tion (b = 0.299, t = 2.323, p = 0.029) and to the CADSS sub-
scale Dissociative Amnesia (b = 0.197, t = 3.297, p = 0.003). 
Additionally, a trend towards significance emerged for the 
relationship between the dependent variable Body Dissat-
isfaction and the independent variable SFQ Total Score 
(b = 0.582, t = 2.03, p = 0.054). Finally, the EDI-2 subscale

Interoceptive Awareness was positively correlated to the

the CADSS subscales Depersonalization (b = 0.37, t = 2.674, 
p = 0.014) and Dissociative Amnesia (b = 0.197, t = 3.297, 
p = 0.003). Further values are shown in Table 2. Duration of 
disease was not correlated with any of the MGT variables 
(all p > 0.05).

Discussion

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  assess  dissociative 
symptoms elicited by mirror exposure in a particular condi-
tion (sensory deprivation due to diminished illumination) 
through the MGT, in a group of patients with AN and a 
group of HC. Novel aspects of this study are mainly two: 
first, dissociation was evaluated both  through  a specific 
task and specific questionnaires (differently from previous 
studies, where only questionnaires were used); second, the 
instrument used here to trigger dissociative features involved 
the presence of a mirror, which is known to elicit body image 
disruption in patients with AN. Concerning this last point, 
it is worthwhile mentioning that here we compared the par-
ticipants only with the mirror image of their own face, while 
in previous cited studies participants viewed their full body 
in the mirror [6–9]. Although it is questionable whether this 
confrontation will elicit the same signs of body image distur-
bance like viewing the full body in the mirror, this is the first 
study using this kind of instrument to evoke dissociation. 
Concerning this point, in the MGT, it is expected that the 
participant stares directly at his/her own eyes reflected in the 
mirror, although apparitions can be elicited even staring at 
other points on the face (i.e., the forehead) [26]. Manipula-
tions of the MGT have been performed by asking couples of 
participants to stare into each other’s eyes, and strange-face-
illusions emerged as well [34]. The face is a complex stimu-
lus pattern, compared to the body, and moreover, it conveys 
a complete self-identity representation. Thus, the face, which 
is reflected in the mirror or perceived through the other’s 
gaze, is the ideal stimulus to investigate three different facets 
of dissociation (derealization, depersonalization, and disso-
ciative identity), as it was showed in a previous study [27]. 
Here, we decided to perform the MGT in its original version 
but, given the body image concern present in patients with 
AN, it will be arguably of interest to investigate the presence 
of illusions and dissociation even in a full-body MGT.

Our data showed a strong dissociation pattern for the 
AN group, contrary to the HC group. AN patients, in fact, 
presented a higher number of misperceptions by looking in 
the mirror, as assessed via the SFQ, and scored higher both 
at the subscale Dissociative Identity/Compartmentaliza-
tion of the SFQ and at the CADSS total score and at all its 
subscales (Derealisation, Depersonalization, Dissociative 

Amnesia). It must be noted that SFQ items associated to 
derealisation are specifically linked to visual perceptual 
deformations of facial features, and these anomalous vis-
ual perceptions resulted similar between AN and HC; on 
the other hand, CADSS derealisation items are generally 
linked to colour changes, tunnel vision, and anomalous 
auditory perceptions, and these resulted different between 
AN and HC.

As anticipated in the introduction, it has been hypoth-
esized that strange-face apparitions might emerge during 
MGT because of a disconnection of two facets of represen-
tations that are usually recruited together and allow self-
recognition in the mirror: the one’s own embodied self-
representation and the visual representation of one’s own 
face left–right reversed, as it usually appears in the mirror. 
According to data available in the literature, we might specu-
late that this disconnection is reached at different times by 
different groups of patients, in a way that is strongly linked 
to their own psychopathology: schizophrenic patients did 
not only dissociate their identity, but also identified them-
selves with the apparitions in the mirror, contrary to healthy 
individuals [29]; depressed patients, on the contrary, expe-
rienced a lower number of apparitions, probably because of 
their deficits in emotional facial recognition and expression 
[31]. Here, due to body image distortion (directly stimulated 
by looking in the mirror) [6–13] and the tendency to experi-
ence dissociation of patients with AN [17–21], we might 
think that they reach the threshold for a disconnection of the 
two over mentioned facets of representation before HC. This 
hypothesis is just speculative, since it was not directly exam-
ined in the present study, and therefore, it is difficult to con-
clude whether different results might be due to differences 
in timing (e.g., onset of the first anomalous experience in 
MGT, which was found to be much reduced in schizophrenic 
patients [29]) or some other aspects (e.g., the prodromal 
role of body image distortion on dissociative detachment 
of bodily-self); hence, we would suggest to conduct future 
studies to specifically examine this question. However, our 
hypothesis, although speculative, is further sustained by a 
recent study of our research group showing that patients with 
functional neurological disorders, a neuropsychiatric condi-
tion which shares several psychopathological features with 
AN [39], presented higher levels of dissociation than HC 
after the MGT exposure [30]. However, when controlling for 
other variables such as the BMI and the selected EDI-2 sub-
scales, the variable Group was not significantly associated 
neither to the SFQ nor to the CADSS, suggesting that the 
reason for the differences between the two groups should be 
found in other specific psychological features. Similarly, the 
BMI did not correlate with any of the MGT variables: this 
result is apparently in contrast with previous research find-
ings according to which AN symptoms can be exacerbated 
by being underweight or in a malnourished state [40]; here,

we might hypothesize that dissociative symptoms follow a 
different pattern, which is independent from BMI.

In this study, although we assessed only one facet of body 
image dysfunction (body dissatisfaction), we showed that 
the Body Dissatisfaction subscale of the EDI-2 was corre-
lated to the SFQ subscale Derealisation and to the CADSS 
subscale Dissociative Amnesia. Moreover, a trend towards 
significance emerged for the relationship between the sub-
scale Body Dissatisfaction and the Total Score of the SFQ. 
This result confirms the hypothesis according to which dis-
sociation and body image dysfunction are strongly linked in 
the pathophysiology of AN [17–20]. Our finding might also 
have some therapeutic implications, especially in psycho-
therapy setting, where techniques focusing on the treatment 
of dissociative symptoms should be encouraged. Concerning 
this aspect, the use of dissociation–induction procedures, 
combined with other therapeutic techniques, such as ground-
ing, emotion- or soma-focused attention training, should be 
considered as therapeutic tools to facilitate identification 
and management of dissociative symptoms in patients with 
AN [41]. As discussed above, body image disruption is a 
key pathophysiological feature also of Body Dysmorphic 
Disorder, a disorder characterized by the obsessive idea 
that some aspects of one’s own body part or appearance are 
severely flawed, and therefore, warrant exceptional meas-
ures to hide or fix one’s dysmorphic part on one’s figure. 
Recently some authors proposed a new diagnostic category 
that encompasses both diseases: the so-called “Body Image 
Disorders” [32]. BDD patients usually spend many hours 
in front of a mirror [43–46], where they perform “mental 
cosmetic surgery” to change their body image [47]. It has 
been speculated that BDD patients may achieve apparitional 
experiences and dissociation of identity during mirror gaz-
ing because of their pathological habit to modify their own 
body image in front of a mirror: the appearance of a strange, 
difference face could be felt as the result of the whole pack-
age of “safety behaviours” performed in front of a mirror 
[47], with the consequence of promoting a new dissociative 
identity [26]. Our data shows that this hypothesis should be 
extended to patients with AN as well. Dissociative identity 
(formerly called multiple-personality [48]) was triggered by 
MGT, hence indicating strong compartmentalization [49] 
of two or more identities in AN patients. The advantage of 
MGT as a therapeutic tool may be that patients can bring 
consciousness  on  their  alter-identities,  which  otherwise 
would remain unconsciously compartmentalized.

Finally, we found that the EDI-2 subscale Interoceptive 
Awareness was a correlated to the CADSS Total Score and 
to the CADSS subscales Depersonalization and Dissociative 
Amnesia scores; more specifically, the higher the difficulties 
in perceiving one’s own body inner states, the higher the 
tendency to dissociation. Given that, in our sample, body 
dissatisfaction and disruption in interoceptive awareness 

were both correlated to dissociation, we might speculate 
that our data also support the hypothesis of a link between 
body image distortion in patients with AN and an abnormal 
functioning of the insula, which integrates interoceptive sen-
sations [14, 15]. A recent study showed that mirror gazing 
can positively enhance aspects of self-processing: interocep-
tive accuracy, measured with a Heartbeat Detection Task, 
increased in healthy participants when they performed the 
task while directly looking at one’s own face in a mirror 
[50]. Given that it is well-established that AN patients have 
lower interoceptive accuracy than HC [51], mirror gazing 
condition might be optimal to increase body awareness in 
this population. This hypothesis might represent a possible 
neurobiological explanation for the frequent use of mirror 
exposure therapy (a clinical trial validated treatment com-
ponent that improves body image and body satisfaction in 
ED [52, 53]) during the treatment of patients with AN in 
psychotherapy setting.

Our study has the following limitations: first, the small 
sample size might limit the generalization of our findings 
and the reliability of statistical analysis, although restric-
tive non-parametric tests have been used and the limit of 
“two subjects per variable” in the multiple linear regression 
has been respected [38]; second, since men and women dif-
fer in their body image disturbances and in their exposure 
to traumatic events [54,  55], an all-female control group 
would have been preferable; however, in our sample, sex-
differences were not significant between the groups and 
when running the analyses without male participants, results 
remained the same; third, we assessed only one facet of body 
image disruption (body image dissatisfaction), but we did 
not assess perceptual distortion; fourth, although the instru-
ment used (MGT) is gaining more and more evidences of 
reliability in different clinical populations, our data would 
be stronger if confirmed by other experimental paradigms 
aimed to assess the process of dissociation; fifth, reliabil-
ity for the SFQ subscale Depersonalisation and the CADSS 
subscale dissociative amnesia were low; however, future 
studies focusing on the questionnaires’ validation will take 
this point into account; sixth, here participants, differently 
from previous studies [29], after the MGT were not first 
interviewed with open questions about their experiences, 
but immediately answered Likert-type questions about their 
experiences, which might be more prone to suggestibility; 
seventh, we used the EDI-2 to assess eating disorder psy-
chopathology and not the last version of the EDI (EDI-3); 
eight, we excluded patients with other comorbid psychiatric 
conditions to have a more homogeneous group; however, 
this might represent a bias of our results, since other psy-
chiatric comorbidities are common in AN. Finally, since we 
did not consider pre-mirror exposure dissociation symptoms 
or compare AN groups with and without mirror exposure 
on dissociative symptoms, we cannot interpret whether the 

1 3 
Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity (2021) 26:1541–1551 

1549

symptoms were elicited or altered by the task, as opposed 
to being pre-existing.

In conclusion, our study showed that patients with AN 
presented  more  dissociative  symptoms  than  HC,  when 
assessed through the MGT, a specific objective instrument. 
In addition, the increase of dissociative symptoms was cor-
related with body dissatisfaction and disruption in intero-
ceptive awareness. This study not only provides additional 
knowledge on the pathophysiology of AN, exploring dis-
sociative symptoms with a novel instrument, but also has 
important clinical and therapeutic implications, providing 
further evidence for the use of techniques focusing on the 
treatment of dissociative symptoms and for the use of mir-
ror exposure therapy during the treatment of patients with 
AN in psychotherapy setting. For this reason, it might be 
of interest to implement the MGT in a full-body session, 
where the participants are allowed to see their whole body 
reflected in the mirror.

Future researches in larger populations should expand 
our preliminary results. Moreover, replicating our results in 
patients affected by BDD would give an additional evidence 
to our findings.

What is already known on this subject?

Previous studies on patients with anorexia nervosa under-
lined a strong linked between dissociative symptoms and 
body image disruption. However, one of the main limita-
tions of these previous studies was the lack of an objective 
assessment of dissociation and its subcomponents, which 
were evaluated only through self-report scales and not by 
experimental tasks.

What this study adds?

Our study showed that patients with anorexia nervosa pre-
sented more dissociative symptoms than healthy controls, 
when assessed through the mirror gazing test, a specific 
objective instrument. In addition, the increase of dissocia-
tive symptoms was correlated with body dissatisfaction and 
disruption in interoceptive awareness. These findings might 
also have some important therapeutic implications.
