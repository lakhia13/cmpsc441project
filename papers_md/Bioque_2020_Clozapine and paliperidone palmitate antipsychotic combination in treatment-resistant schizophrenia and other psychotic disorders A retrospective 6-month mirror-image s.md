Abstract

Background: Around 30% of patients with schizophrenia are considered treatment resistant
(TRS). Only around 40% of TRS patients respond to clozapine. Long acting injectable antipsy-
chotics could be a useful augmentation strategy for nonresponders.
Methods: We conducted a multicenter, observational, naturalistic, retrospective, 6-month
mirror-image study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of clozapine and paliperidone
palmitate association in 50 patients with TRS and other psychotic disorders. Clinical outcomes
and side effects were systematically assessed.
Results: Six months after starting the combined treatment, participants showed a significant
relief of symptoms, decreasing the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score from 18.32 (cid:1) 7.71 to
7.84 (cid:1) 5.16 (p < 0.001). The number of hospitalizations, the length of hospital stays and the
number of visits to emergency services also decreased, while an increase of the functionality was
observed (Personal and Social Performance total score increased from 46.06 (cid:1) 118.7 to 60.86 (cid:1)
18.68, p < 0.001). There was also a significant decrease in the number and severity of side effects
with the combination therapy, decreasing the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser total score from
10.76 (cid:1) 8.04 to 8.82 (cid:1) 6.63 (p = 0.004).
Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that combining clozapine with paliperidone
palmitate in patients with TRS and other psychotic disorders could be effective and safe,
suggesting further research with randomized controlled trials of augmentation strategies for
clozapine nonresponder patients.
Policy Significance Statement: Patients with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia show a
variable response to antipsychotic treatments. Around 30% of patients are considered treatment
resistant, indicated by insufficient symptom control to at least two different drugs. In these
resistant cases, clozapine should be indicated, as it has shown to be superior to other options.
However, only 40% of patients respond to clozapine, being necessary to establish which treatments
could best potentiate clozapine action. Combining clozapine with long acting injectable antipsy-
chotics, and particularly paliperidone palmitate, could be a useful strategy. We conducted a
multicenter study of 50 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders comparing the efficacy and tolerability in the 6 month-period prior and after starting
the clozapine and paliperidone palmitate association. Our study suggests that this combination
could be effective and safer, laying the groundwork for future clinical trials with this combination.

Introduction

Pharmacological response to antipsychotic treatment for patients with chronic psychotic disor-
ders is heterogeneous, being mediated by two principal barriers: treatment resistance and
treatment nonadherence [1–3].

Recommendations after an inadequate first antipsychotic response include waiting for a
delayed response, dose adjustment and switching to a second antipsychotic [4,5]. Around 30% of

2

Miquel Bioque et al.

patients with schizophrenia are considered treatment resistant
(TRS), indicated by insufficient symptom control and low response
rates to at least two adequate antipsychotic trials [4,6–9]. In case of
treatment resistance, clozapine should be indicated, as it has shown
to be superior to other antipsychotics [10–12].

Besides, both chronic and first-episode patients with schizo-
phrenia show high treatment discontinuation rates [11,13]. Multi-
episodic courses linked to relapses may lead to poor outcomes and
negative effects on brain integrity, facilitating conditions that seri-
ously interfere with rehabilitation efforts [14,15]. Long-acting
injectable (LAI) antipsychotics were developed with intention to
improve schizophrenia patients’ long-term outcomes by reducing
the high rates of relapses and rehospitalizations due to treatment
discontinuation [16]. Their use has been associated to a 30% decrease
in mortality risk [17]. In concrete, paliperidone palmitate, either in
1-month or three-month formulation, have shown to be effective to
reduce the number of relapses related to treatment lack of adherence,
both in the short- and in the long term [2,18–21]. However, despite
LAI antipsychotics have documented their value for preventing
relapses, they are significantly underused due to different barriers
[16,22–26]. Interestingly Treatment Response and Resistance in
Psychosis (TRRIP) Working Group Consensus recommends the
use of LAI antipsychotics during at least 4 months before initiation
clozapine in order to differentiate treatment resistant-psychosis from
resistance to be treated [6].

Clozapine monotherapy is considered by most guidelines
and expert consensus the most effective medication for TRS
[27–30]. However, only 40% of people will meet response criteria,
being necessary to establish well evidenced-bases clozapine aug-
mentation strategies [31–33]. Recent systematic meta-review of
available evidence and international expert consensus point that
augmentation with second-generation antipsychotics and first-
generation antipsychotics can be beneficial, but the supporting
evidence is from low-quality studies [32,33]. A previous retrospec-
tive 1-year mirror-image study reported that clozapine and various

LAI antipsychotics (mainly first generation and risperidone) com-
bination was beneficial and safe in a cohort of 17 multi-episode
patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder
[3]. This previous study did not include paliperidone palmitate
augmentation, which could a priori be a suitable drug to enhance
the effect of clozapine as paliperidone presents a different receptor
profile. Besides, in a previous pilot data collection of patients
combining clozapine with oral, extended-release paliperidone, or
paliperidone palmitate, we had found interesting outcomes that
need to be studied more deeply [34]. Moreover, as other polyther-
apy regimens, this combination was already being used in the
clinical practice of the participating centers, so we identified the
need to study whether this combination was effective and safe.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability
of clozapine and paliperidone palmitate association in patients with
TRS and other psychotic disorders.

Subjects and Methods

Subjects

We conducted a multicenter, observational, naturalistic, retrospec-
tive 6-month mirror-image study to assess efficacy and tolerability
of
the clozapine and paliperidone palmitate combination in
patients with a treatment-resistant psychotic disorder by compar-
ing data relative to patients 6 months before and after initiating this
combination. The index date was defined as the starting date of the
clozapine and paliperidone palmitate combination (see Figure 1).
The duration of 6 months was prespecified, considering that pali-
peridone palmitate steady state may not be reached until 4–5
months after commencing treatment [35] and that other similar
mirror-image studies involving LAI antipsychotics also covered 6
months before and after initiating the studied strategy [36].

This retrospective observational study was conducted from
January 2017 to April 2019 in inpatients or outpatients’ services

of four public hospitals: Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Hospital
General de Granollers, Hospital de Mataró, and Hospital Universi-
tari Mútua de Terrassa. Because this was an observational retro-
spective study, patients were not required to provide informed
consent. The present study was approved and authorized by the
respective departments of psychiatry in which it was conducted and
performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in
the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Inclusion criteria were: (a) patients being followed-up in one of
the four participating centers during the recruiting period;
(b) patients ≥18 years of age and diagnosed of schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features according to The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria [37];
(c) patients that, according to the referring psychiatrist, could take
benefit of a change from the previous treatment (due to lack of
efficacy, poor adherence, side effects, or other reasons) after having
used under adequate dose of at least two different antipsychotics
during 6–8 weeks with at least one of them being a nonclozapine
atypical antipsychotic.

Psychopharmacological treatment

Being a naturalistic study, there were no specific guidelines for
treatments, so patients received the combination antipsychotic treat-
ment based on the clinician’s choice. Dosing, co-medications, or
treatment changes were based on clinical necessity. Clozapine mean
daily dose, plasma mean levels when available, paliperidone palmi-
tate formulation (monthly or quarterly), paliperidone palmitate
mean monthly dose, treatment starting dates, and coadjuvant anti-
psychotic, antidepressant, anxiolytic, mood stabilizer, anticholiner-
gic, or other psychopharmacological treatments were recorded.
Being a retrospective data collection, patients included did not lead
a different patient care that deviated from the regular treatment. In
participants with other diagnosis than schizophrenia, clozapine
represented an off-label treatment. This use was specified in each
participant’s medical file.

Clinical and tolerability assessment

Sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected
using a unique, homogenized electronic data notebook. Clinical
data regarding pre- and post-switch period were recorded, includ-
ing the number and length of hospitalizations and the number of
visits to emergency services. Main clinical outcomes were assessed
by means of the Bech’s version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS) [38,39], which was applied by trained raters in each of the
two visits to evaluate the psychopathological state of the patients.
The Bech’s version of the BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom
constructs to measure psychopathology severity, where each symp-
tom is rated 0–4 from absence to most severe [39].

In order to identify potential predictors of efficacy and following
Leucht et al. recommendations [40], we classified the sample in five
groups according to changes in BPRS total scores between index
date and the 6-month evaluation: participants with an increase in
the BPRS score (meaning clinical worsening) and participants with
<25%, 25–49%, 50–74% or >75% reduction, respectively. In order
to avoid multiple testing [40], we analyzed potential predictors
associated with a reduction of ≥25% of the BPRS score, considering
that this decrease could be associated with significant clinical
improvements in treatment-resistant patients. Thus, participants
with a BPRS reduction of 25% or more were considered

“responders,” while those with lower reductions or increases were
considered “nonresponders.”

Other recorded clinical data included Personal and Social Per-
formance (PSP) score [41]. The PSP scale was developed to evaluate
social and personal functioning and considers four areas (socially
useful activities; personal and social relationships; self-care; and
disturbing and aggressive behaviors). For filling it, the clinician
must assign an initial six-degree of severity to each area (from
absent over mild, manifest, marked, severe to very severe difficulties
in the given area). The final result is a single measurement from 0 to
100% where higher scores reflect better personal and social func-
tioning.

In order to assess in detail the adverse drug reactions, two
procedures were followed: (a) spontaneous reports of ADRs
Adverse Drug Reaction and (b) systematic assessment of the effects
targeted in the Scale of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser
(UKU) [42], a comprehensive rating scale designed to assess gen-
eral side effects of psychotropic drugs. Investigators also reported
any specific treatment or change in the prescription due to ADRs
appearance, including antipsychotic discontinuation, dose reduc-
tion or start of an anticholinergic drug. Those ADRs that made the
clinician change the usual practice by, for example, requesting a
blood test that was not previously scheduled, sending the patient to
the emergency room or hospitalizing them was considered as
serious.

Statistical analysis

Comparisons of clinical and treatment variables between the pre-
and post-switch period were performed. We have a priori deter-
mined that a sample size of 34 patients was required to detect a
difference of 0.5 ((cid:1) 1 standard deviation) in the mean number of
psychiatric hospital admissions and a difference of 5 ((cid:1) 10 standard
deviations) in the mean number of bed days with a power of 0.80
and a two-sided 0.05 significance level. Baseline characteristics were
summarized using descriptive statistics. Means and standard devi-
ations (SD) for continuous variables and counts and percentages for
categorical variables were calculated. Differences were tested for
statistical significance using Wilcoxon rank tests for non-normally
distributed variables, confirmed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
A McNemar’s test was used to asses significant changes in pro-
portions between the two periods observed. In each analysis, a
pairwise exclusion of missing was used.

We analyzed a set of potential predictors of response related to
the pre-index period through different tests. For categorical variables
(taking/not taking clozapine, taking/not taking paliperidone palmi-
tate, taking/not taking oral paliperidone or risperidone, being under
antipsychotic monotherapy vs polytherapy and diagnosis) we used a
Chi-square test for independence (with Yates Continuity Correc-
tion). For continuous variables (age at index date, age at disorder
onset, duration of disorder), we used a Mann–Whitney U test.

A value of p < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant in all
analysis. Data were managed and analyzed with the IBM SPSS
Statistics v.23.

The present study was reported following the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
statement (for STROBE checklist, see Supplementary Material).

Participants maintained the treatment combination for a mean
of 5.24 months ((cid:1)1.39). Thirty-seven patients (74%) remained with
the combined treatment all the 6 months of observation period after
associating treatments. See study flow chart in Supplementary
Material.

Table 2 shows a comparison of psychopharmacological treat-
ment between the 6 months preceding and the 6 months following
clozapine and paliperidone palmitate combination. During the 6
months before the association treatment, 32 subjects (64%) were
taking clozapine, 13 (26%) were taking paliperidone palmitate, and
5 (10%) did not take either of the two in the previous period.

During the 6 months after the association treatment, 3 of the
50 patients (6%) switched to the equivalent 3-month formulation of
paliperidone palmitate; the remaining patients were kept in the
monthly formulation.

The use of other antipsychotics decreased from 80% of the
participants in the precombination period to 18% during the 6
months postcombination period (p < 0.001). The most common
antipsychotics used during the precombination period were risper-
idone (n = 14), haloperidol (n = 7), oral paliperidone (n = 7), and
aripiprazole (n = 7). Five participants switched from other LAI
antipsychotics to paliperidone palmitate (three from risperidone
LAI and two from zuclopenthixol decanoate). There was also a
significant decrease in the proportion of participants taking ben-
zodiazepines (52% vs. 18%, p < 0.001), but not in the use of
anticholinergic drugs, antidepressants or mood stabilizers.

Main efficacy outcomes are presented in Table 3. In the popu-
lation studied, the combination of clozapine and paliperidone
palmitate showed a significant decrease in the number and length
of hospitalizations, number of visits to emergency services and in
the BPRS total score.

None of the potential predictors of response studied reached
statistical significance. Age at index-date showed a statistical ten-
dency (U = 70.5; p = 0.066), meaning that the group of responders

showed a nonsignificant tendency to be younger than nonre-
sponders (mean age at index-date: 24.1 vs. 35.75 years old).

A significant increase in the PSP total score was also detected,

with significant improvements in all sub-domains.

Finally, data regarding the combined treatment tolerance is
shown in Table 4. There was a significant decrease in the number
and severity of side effects with the combination therapy. The
decrease of the UKU total score was related to the psychiatric and
neurological domains. There was a nonsignificant elevation of
mean prolactin plasma levels. There was no evidence of an
increased risk of agranulocytosis with the combination therapy.

Discussion

In this multicentric 6-month mirror-image study, we found that
combining clozapine and paliperidone palmitate was an effective
and safe strategy to treat patients with TRS and related psychotic
disorders. After 6 months under this combination, participants
showed a significant relief of symptoms, decrease in the number
and length of hospitalizations, decrease in the number of visits to
emergency services and increase of the functionality compared to
the previous 6-month period. After an exhaustive search of side
effects, this combination of antipsychotics resulted in general well-
tolerated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
has studied this combination in such a large sample and with this
kind of mirror-image methodology.

Given that a relevant proportion of patients with a psychotic
disorder do not respond adequately to monotherapy with cloza-
pine, there is a need to know which coadjuvant treatments can be
more effective and safer [4,7,8,43–46]. The combination of cloza-
pine with LAI antipsychotics could be one of the strategies with
more potential [3,47], especially with the appearance of monthly or
quarterly second-generation antipsychotics.

To date, limited evidence is available about the combination of
clozapine and paliperidone palmitate. A potential interest could be
inferred from some short case-series which have already reported
good results from adding oral paliperidone to clozapine or chang-
ing from clozapine to paliperidone palmitate [48–50]. Also, from a
pharmacological point of view, the serotonin 5-HT2A antagonism
and dopamine D2 antagonism effects of paliperidone could
enhance clozapine antipsychotic action, without potentiating the
side effects associated with other receptors (muscarinic, histaminic,
etc.). Despite the fact that patients treated with clozapine have lower
treatment withdrawal rates compared to other oral antipsychotics
[10,51], part of the positive results of our study could be due to the
fact that an injectable formulation of paliperidone facilitates ther-
apeutic adherence in patients with partial compliance.

Other secondary benefit detected in this study was a significant
decrease in the proportion of patients with other antipsychotics and
benzodiazepines, an indirect sign of the psychopathology improve-
ment detected in the clinical scales. Although mean daily doses of
clozapine decreased with the addition of paliperidone palmitate, it
did not reach a significant statistical significance (from 330.47 to
265.50 mg/day; p = 0.062), despite its important clinical relevance.
The reduction of concomitant treatments (mainly other antipsy-
chotics and benzodiazepines, see Table 2 for details) and the
decrease in clozapine daily doses could be a potential mediator in
the detected decrease of number and severity of side effects, mainly
psychic and neurologic (see Table 4). Although the heterogeneity of
previous treatment regimens has not allowed us to do more con-
crete analysis, another potential reason of this findings could be
related to participants switching from haloperidol, zuclopenthixol

depot or even injectable risperidone to paliperidone palmitate as a
coadjuvant of clozapine.

None of the potential predictors of response studied reached
statistical significance. Age at index-date showed a statistical ten-
dency (p = 0.066), being mean age at
index-date lower for
responders than for non-responders (24.1 vs. 35.75 years old). A
bigger sample size of each group could have permitted to reach
statistical significance, indicating that this strategy could be more
useful if it is established soon.

This study has a number of limitations. First, the retrospective
and naturalistic design of this study and the consequent absence of a
control group is an important limitation of this observational study,
as well as the moderate sample size included. Second, in a mirror-

image study, each patient serves as his or her own control and
observed changes from pre- to post-association introduction may
reflect regression to the mean. However, this is the most used design
to compare two treatments in the same individual. Third, studying
last resort medications in treatment-resistant patients could gen-
erate expectation bias. Fourth, clozapine and prolactin blood levels
were not available in all the participants included in this study.
Fifth, the male versus female ratio of the sample included (74%
vs. 26%) could be confusing some of the outcomes, such as side-
effect incidence and intensity. Sixth, our results point that this
treatment combination is safe on the basis of the evaluated side
effects rates, but other side effects such as metabolic, that also could
have a major impact on the patients’ global well-being and are

associated to clozapine treatment in some subjects [52], were not
assessed in this study. Besides, being a naturalistic study in real-
world settings, the treatment regimen of the patients during the
precombination period was heterogeneous (for instance, while
10 patients were being treated with monotherapy during that
period, the rest were under diverse combination regimens). This
fact did not allow to perform specific subanalyses to determine
which previous treatment regimens could benefit most of changing
to this treatment combination, for instance, due to the reduction of
certain side effects. Finally, these results cannot be generalized to
other than the mentioned LAI antipsychotics.

Despite these limitations, we believe that our study provides the
first evidence that combining clozapine with paliperidone palmitate
in patients with TRS and other psychotic disorders could be effi-
cacious and safer. This augmentation strategy could help in
improving the functionality and prognosis of these severe disor-
ders, which deserve more attention in future research with ran-
domized controlled trials of clozapine augmentation strategies for
patients who failed to respond to clozapine.
