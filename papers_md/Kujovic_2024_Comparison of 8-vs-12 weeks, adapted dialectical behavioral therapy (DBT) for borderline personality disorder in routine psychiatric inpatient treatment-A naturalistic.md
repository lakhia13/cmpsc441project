Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is widely acknowledged as an effective treatment for individuals 
with borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, the optimal treatment duration within DBT 
remains a topic of investigation. This retrospective, naturalistic non‑randomized study aimed to 
compare the efficacy of 8 week and 12 week DBT interventions with equivalent content, focusing on 
the change of BPD‑specific symptomatology as the primary outcome and depressive symptoms as 
the secondary outcome. Overall, 175 patients who participated in DBT and received either 8 week 
or 12 week intervention were included in the analysis. Routine inpatient treatment was adapted 
from standard DBT with the modules: skill training, interpersonal skills, dealing with feelings, 
and mindfulness. Measurements were taken at baseline, mid‑point, and endpoint. The borderline 
symptom list‑23 (BSL‑23) was used for the assessment of borderline‑specific symptoms, while the 
Beck depression inventory‑II (BDI‑II) was used for the assessment of depressive symptoms. Statistical 
analysis was conducted using linear mixed models. Effect sizes were calculated for both measures. The 
results of the analysis indicated an improvement in both groups over time. Effect sizes were d = 1.29 
for BSL‑23 and d = 1.79 for BDI‑II in the 8 week group, and d = 1.16 for BSL‑23 and d = 1.58 for BDI‑II in 
the 12 week group. However, there were no differences in the change of BPD‑specific symptoms or the 
severity of depressive symptoms between the 8 week and 12 week treatment duration groups. Based 
on these findings, shorter treatment durations, like 8 weeks, could be a viable alternative, offering 
comparable therapeutic benefits, potential cost reduction, and improved accessibility. However, 
further research is needed to explore factors influencing treatment outcomes and evaluate the long‑
term effects of different treatment durations in DBT for BPD.

Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) was originally developed to treat chronically suicidal patients by Mar-
sha  Linehan1 and is regarded as the first choice evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder 
 (BPD2). BPD is a severe mental  illness3 and describes a pattern of emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and interper-
sonal dysregulation leading to marked distress as well as impairments in social and occupational  functioning1,4.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreportsFurthermore, BPD is characterized by self-harming behaviour, an increased risk of  suicide5 and high rates of 
axis-I comorbidities, with mood disorders being the most  prevalent6. In addition, high comorbidities are shown 
for eating disorders, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and personality  disorders7. While recent 
long-term studies show that remission of symptoms was sustained over time in almost one half of the affected 
individuals, social integration was significantly  worse7. According to population-based studies, the prevalence 
of BPD ranges from 0.7 to 4.5%8, with a lifetime prevalence of 5.9%9. This suggests that in Germany, there are 
an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals affected by this  condition10–12. Besides, BPD patients show a high 
prevalence among psychiatric (in-)patients4.

Furthermore, the outpatient and inpatient care situation for BPD in Germany can be considered  insufficient10. 
Thus, an estimated 700 inpatient places are  available11 and therapists in inpatient and outpatient care are often 
not specifically trained or may even refuse treatment in some  cases10. Furthermore, Iliakis et al.13 estimated a 
ratio of 1:1102 of specialized, certified therapists in relation to the annual number of BPD patients to be treated. 
Beyond the individual burden caused by BPD, the economic burden by means of high mental health care costs—
mainly driven by repetitive hospital  stays3,14,15—is immense. Direct and indirect costs are estimated to result in 
numbers of up to € 40.000 per case and year depending on factors included and  approach3. Accordingly, there 
is a need for specialized hospitals to conduct the complex management of chronic diseases as well as to provide 
the necessary resources.

According to several treatment guidelines for BPD, psychotherapy is considered first-line  therapy16,17. Con-
sidering the German guideline for  BPD16, DBT shows the best evidence and is recommended particularly when 
the treatment’s primary outcome is the reduction of severe self-harming behaviors (including suicidal behaviors). 
Furthermore, manualized disorder-specific psychotherapy programs such as DBT, mentalization-based psycho-
therapy (MBT)18 and schema  therapy19 have been found to be  effective20. Also,  Bohus7 stated that disorder-specific 
treatment in the case of BPD in comparison to unspecific treatment seems to lead to further improvements, e.g. 
lower suicide rates. DBT is a modularized, individual and group-based skills training consisting of four key ele-
ments: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation and interpersonal  competence1. Additionally, DBT has 
since been advanced to include other important components, such as self-esteem, as BPD is often associated with 
dysfunctional self-concepts21. The efficacy of DBT for BPD has been proven in several randomized controlled 
trials with different  designs22,23. These findings are supported by recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis 
showing that DBT is effective in reducing BPD specific symptoms and superior compared to treatment-as-usual 
(e.g.,23,24). According to Snoek et al.25, DBT offers a more favorable cost-effectiveness as compared to cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) or other treatments, such as weekly individual therapy or psychoeducational groups.
While many studies have investigated the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments, only a few have focused 
on the general framework or organizational conditions of psychotherapeutic treatment (such as the duration of 
treatment, or inpatient vs. outpatient setting) and their  effectiveness26. Knowledge about the influence of these 
contextual factors on therapy outcomes is still somewhat limited. Originally, DBT was developed as an outpa-
tient treatment as hospitalization might decrease patients’ ability to learn effective coping strategies for their 
daily  lives1. According to Van Swearingen and  Lothes27, the standard version of DBT within outpatient settings 
should require approximately 1 year. However, BPD patients often require more intensive care and show a high 
prevalence in inpatient  settings4. In addition, Bloom et al.28 argue that the outpatient setting cannot adequately 
be provided for all BPD patients as well as that outpatient treatment staff might be feeling overwhelmed when 
dealing with BPD. Consequently, DBT was adapted for inpatient  settings29.

One of the first studies to examine DBT in the inpatient setting was performed by Bohus et al.30, who adapted 
this type of DBT program by Swenson et al.31 for the inpatient setting in Europe. The treatment lasts about 
3  months30. Yet, inpatient treatment programs for BPD show variation in the duration and  content28. Compared 
to the 1 year DBT originally scheduled by  Linehan1, abbreviated inpatient and outpatient implementations of 
DBT were studied with different variations of duration, ranging from very short 5 day intensive group-based 
DBT-skills training to longer-term 6 month  programs26,32. Despite heterogeneity in the duration of inpatient 
treatment programs a survey by Richter et al.11 found that among 42 German hospitals and day clinics about 
half of the clinics set the treatment duration a priori to 12 weeks. Furthermore, Bloom et al.28 found the modal 
duration of inpatient DBT to be 3 months. Consequently, it can be assumed that 3 months (12 weeks) is the most 
common duration of inpatient DBT in Germany and can be seen as the standard duration in the inpatient setting.
Based on studies examining the effects of duration of DBT treatments in the inpatient setting, research has 
also suggested that even short versions of DBT could be (equally) effective in reducing BPD-specific symptoms. 
A study conducted in a German hospital found small to medium effect sizes regarding the reduction of BPD 
symptoms within a treatment duration between 8 and 12  weeks33. This is also one of the few naturalistic studies 
that has been conducted within routine  care26. Other studies have shown different beneficial effects for shorter 
treatment durations. For instance, 25% of patients seemed to refrain from self-harm within the first week of 
 therapy34. Additionally, Probst et al.35 showed that a 5 weeks inpatient DBT therapy showed a significant reduc-
tion in BPD specific symptoms and improved emotion regulation. In addition, results indicate that symptom 
and functional improvement for shortened therapies were stable at 5 year follow-ups with annual measurements 
and readmission rates remained low after treatment  completion26,27. Regarding other setting conditions, recent 
research suggests that DBT-inpatients may benefit more than outpatients regarding self-esteem, distress, and 
quality of  life26.

Although the evidence base is somewhat sparse and further research is urgently needed, it suggests that 
shorter (inpatient) DBT may be as effective as a longer treatment. Moreover, shorter treatment duration is associ-
ated with potentially different advantages like reduced dropout  rates26 or reduced health care and societal costs. 
A recent meta-analysis found that dropout rates in psychotherapies for BPD are generally high, ranging between 
20 to 30%36. According to Iliakis et al.36 main reasons for dropping out were treatment dissatisfaction, exclusion 
from treatment, insufficient motivation, as well as life events or changes in life situation. Likewise, Iliakis et al.36

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/suggest that abbreviated treatment programs could have an impact on patient motivation and satisfaction, thereby 
increasing adherence and commitment to therapy as well as reducing dropout rates. Furthermore, a shortened 
treatment duration enables an earlier treatment completion and should lead to a greater benefit for BPD-patients 
in general as more patients could participate in disorder-specific treatments within the same period and  facility26. 
Also beneficial is an earlier treatment response, e. g. faster reduction of self-harming behavior and earlier return 
to ‘real life’ leading to (earlier) occupational as well as leisurely activities.

Aims of the study
Consequently, we argue that an adequate adjustment of ‘standard’ DBT in terms of shortened treatment duration 
of 8 weeks compared to 12 weeks within inpatient setting might deliver significant benefits for patients with BPD 
while maintaining the efficacy of (longer) DBT-programs. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a shortened 8 week 
DBT is comparable regarding efficacy to the standard 12 week program (both with equal content) in routine 
clinical psychiatric inpatient treatment. The primary outcome of the study was the change in BPD-specific 
symptoms, while the secondary outcome was the change in depressive symptoms.

Methods
Procedures
The study was conducted between August 2019 and September 2021 at a specialized ward for patients with BPD 
at the LVR-clinics Dusseldorf, department of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Heinrich–Heine-university, 
Dusseldorf. Each potential patient receives a pre-admission interview prior to acceptance. After admission within 
routine clinical treatment, patients with BPD were offered a DBT program as obligatory to continue inpatient 
treatment. Generally, the treatment plan was scheduled for 8 weeks. From August 2020 to March 2021 an adapta-
tion was implemented to offer an extension of four more weeks (i.e. 12 weeks in total) to patients showing high 
commitment and motivation to deepen and improve knowledge and coping skills. The decision to extend was 
made during the sixth week by the clinical assessment of the treatment team. This applied to patients who were 
engaged and participated effectively in the program. Accordingly, patients who extended the treatment up to 
12 weeks had the opportunity to repeat and practice. Nevertheless, beyond time and treatment session extension, 
there were no differences regarding contents or skills training provided. The difference in treatment duration 
resulted in two separate samples of patients who received the same DBT treatment, but were treated for either 8 
or 12 weeks. For all patients, the routine clinical treatment also comprises occupational therapy, sports/physical 
activity therapy, music therapy, and psychiatric care including psychotropic drug treatment, which should be 
administered as low as possible. All data were collected within the routine treatment and analyzed post hoc. 
Assessments included in the analyses considered baseline (prior treatment), midpoint (after 4 or 6 weeks respec-
tively) and after treatment (week 8 or 12 respectively). Due to the routine care setting, both treatment conditions 
were provided by the same personnel. Initial assessments including diagnosis were blind to treatment condition, 
as group allocation took place in the sixth week of DBT-treatment at the earliest. Assessments after week 8 were 
not blind to treatment condition, however assessors i.e. patients (due to self-assessment instruments) as well as 
treating personnel were unaware of the hypothesis. Adherence (of therapists) to (DBT-) manual was not assessed. 
All participants have given informed consent to anonymized analyses as the standard procedure associated with 
inpatient treatment. Before retrospective data collection, an ethics vote was requested from the Medical Faculty 
Ethics Committee of Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, which was approved on 1 February 2022 (reference 
number: 2021-1693). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria and sample
All patients with a diagnosis of BPD according to DSM-5  criteria37, which was assured by SCID-II (meeting at 
least five criteria on the BPD  scale38,) and additionally confirmed by means of a clinical diagnosis according to 
ICD-1039 were included in the trial and analyses. Also, diagnosis of depression and further mental disorders were 
confirmed using Diagnostisches Kurzinterview bei psychischen Störungen (mini-DIPS  OA40,). Trained clinicians 
that were either psychotherapists or psychotherapists in training conducted the diagnostic process. Training in 
SCID-II assessments are part of the routine clinical management at our facility, however no formal reliability 
checks were conducted. Furthermore, patients had to be at least 18 years old, commencing DBT treatment and 
having at least baseline assessment in the borderline symptom checklist 23 (BSL-2341;). In the study, all comor-
bidities were allowed except for disorders within the schizophrenia spectrum and addiction disorders, which 
were considered exclusion criteria. Overall, 175 patients participated, 153 patients under an 8 weeks treatment 
condition and 22 patients under 12 week condition.

Primary outcome: BSL‑23
The BSL is a self-rating instrument for assessing typical symptoms associated with the  BPD41. The items address 
both diagnostic criteria, such as affective instability and self-harming behavior, as well as borderline-typical 
empirical findings regarding self-criticism, trust issues, emotional vulnerability, and feelings of shame, loneliness, 
and  helplessness42. The BSL is available in long and short versions. The long version consists of 95 items while 
the short version assesses the symptoms with only 23 items. The BSL-23 is used for measuring the borderline 
specific symptoms 1 week prior to the  assessment41. Participants’ ratings are given on a Likert scale from 0 (not 
at all) to 4 (very strong). BSL-23 has proven to have sufficient psychometric properties regarding validity and 
 reliability41. In the present study, the standardized percentile rank of the test was analyzed.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/Secondary outcome: BDI‑II
The revised Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure the severity 
of depression in  individuals43. The BDI-II consists of 21 items where individuals can rate the severity of their 
symptoms on a scale from 0 to 3, whereas higher scores indicate more severe depression. The BDI-II has high 
internal consistency as well as good  validity44.

DBT treatment
The offered modularized DBT program according to Linehan’s manual adapted for inpatient treatment in Ger-
many by Bohus and Wolf–Arehult45, contains the modules: skill training, interpersonal skills, dealing with feel-
ings, and mindfulness. The self-esteem module is not provided. The typical treatment comprises the following 
obligatory components: each patient receives individual psychotherapeutic sessions (1–2 per week), DBT-based 
skills training (group: 2 per week), mindfulness-based group therapy (1 per week), psychoeducation about DBT 
and BPD (1 per week), and “tools” group (consolidation of elements taught in DBT such as emotion analysis, 1 
per week). The program was designed for 8 weeks, accordingly all patients were provided with the opportunity 
to complete the four modules offered. Patients in the 12 week group were not provided with more content in the 
program, but were able to use the additional time to repeat the content. To ensure adherence to the DBT manual, 
all staff members in direct patient contact from various professional backgrounds, including medical personnel, 
psychotherapists, nursing staff, occupational therapists, and others, underwent training in all modules (basis- and 
skills-modules) provided by the Dachverband DBT e.V. Certified personnel from the DBT association conducted 
these training sessions consisting of six modules of a total of 96 h of instruction.

Statistical analysis
Routine data was analyzed post hoc. Group differences (8 vs. 12 weeks) in primary (BSL-23) and secondary 
(BDI-II) endpoints were analyzed by linear mixed models repeated measurement with group, time (baseline, 
mid- and endpoint) and group*time-interaction as fixed effects and patient as random effect to deal adequately 
with missing values (intention-to-treat analyses). In addition, baseline scores (BSL-23 or BDI-II respectively) 
were included as covariates. To control for potential ‘historical’ effects (prior March 2021, 8 week and 12 week 
DBT was offered, after March 2021 only 8 weeks DBT; thus, after March 2021 n = 52 patients, i.e. 34% of all 153 
patients with 8 weeks-DBT, were treated for 8 weeks whereas no patient for 12 weeks) all analyses were also 
conducted regarding a three-group comparison (8 weeks pre March 21 vs. 8 weeks post March 21 vs. 12 weeks). 
Effect sizes were calculated using the estimated means of the linear mixed model including baseline as covari-
ate divided by the pooled standard deviation of both groups at baseline. To test for pre-treatment differences, 
Chi-square-tests were conducted for categorical measures and t-tests (two-group comparisons) or ANOVAs 
(three-group comparisons) for metric measures. In addition, the potential confounding effect of group differ-
ences in routine treatment with psychotropic drugs was analyzed regarding the kind of drugs, amount of drugs 
in ‘days applied’ and percentage of hospital days with drugs (the patients of the 12 week group had naturally a 
significantly longer hospital stay, thus the percentage was calculated). Due to the computer based documenta-
tion system of the hospital, drug dose could not be assessed. Given the naturalistic and retrospective design of 
the study and especially the evolving divergent group sample sizes (n = 153 for 8 week vs. n = 22 for 12 week 
DBT) statistical requirements to examine a more appropriate non-inferiority hypothesis (especially balanced 
groups for sound parameter estimates) were unfortunately not given. All analyses were conducted using IBM 
SPSS statistics version 29.

Results
Descriptives
The mean age of the participants in the 8 week program was 28.3 (SD = 8.6), whereas participants in the 12 weeks 
program were on average 24.7 (SD = 7.1) years old. This difference was significant, t(173) = 1.9, p = 0.036. Regard-
ing sex proportions both samples showed no significant differences, Χ2(1) = 0.54, p = 0.58. The proportion of 
females in the 8 week group was 79.7% and 86.4% in the 12 weeks condition. While the cumulative days of 
inpatient treatment in the 8 weeks group averaged 55.6 days (SD = 12.5), individuals in the 12 week group spent 
an average of 75.5 days (SD = 12.2) in the hospital. Accordingly, the 12 week group showed a discrepancy in 
terms of the intended average duration. Table 1 shows the observed means of BSL-23 and BDI-II as well as their

not significantly different between treatment groups (p = 0.33 and 0.12 respectively). In addition, comorbidity 
with (other) mental disorders according to ICD-10 diagnosis was not significantly different between groups (see 
Table S1 in supplement).

Mixed linear models analysis
BSL‑23: primary outcome
In this study, we used mixed linear models to compare two groups (8 weeks vs. 12 weeks DBT) with respect 
to changes in BSL-23 as the primary outcome. Table 2 shows the estimated mean percentile ranks for BSL-23 
comparing 8 weeks against the 12 weeks treatment. Figure 1 depicts the observed and estimated mean percentile 
ranks for all three measurement time points comparing 8 weeks with 12 weeks of DBT. As Fig. 2 shows there 
is a decline in borderline specific symptoms over time, this main effect was significant, F(1, 120.11) = 19.45, 
p < 0.001. Therefore, borderline specific symptoms reduced significantly over time in both groups. The main effect 
of the group was not significant, F(1, 161.43) = 0.04, p = 0.85, as well as the interaction of group and time, F(1, 
120.09) = 2.66, p = 0.11. Accordingly, groups showed no differences regarding BSL-23 at any time nor in reduc-
tion over time. With respect to single time comparisons, only the comparison of mid to end was not significant 
for twelve weeks, p = 0.29. Likewise, the three-group-comparison (8 weeks pre March 21 vs. 8 weeks post March 
21 vs. 12 weeks) yielded comparable results.

BDI‑II: secondary outcome
Also for the secondary outcome regarding the BDI-II a linear mixed model was conducted. Table 3 shows the 
estimated means and 95% confidence intervals for BDI-II for 8 weeks and 12 weeks treatment groups. As can 
be seen in Fig. 2 BDI-II scores significantly improved over time, F(1, 121.06) = 31.42, p < 0.001. Likewise, as for

BSL-23, there was no significant main effect of the group on BDI-II, F(1, 161.39) = 0.08, p = 0.78, and no signifi-
cant interaction of group and time, F(1, 121.02) = 1.30, p = 0.26. Regarding single comparisons, all specific time 
effects were highly significant (p < 0.001) except for mid to end for the 12 weeks group, p = 0.040. Regarding 
the three-group-comparison (8 weeks pre March 21 vs. 8 weeks post March 21 vs. 12 weeks), besides a signifi-
cant time-effect (p < 0.001) and a non-significant group*time-interaction (p = 0.32), a significant group-effect 
(p = 0.006) evolved. However, as post-hoc comparisons indicate, the groups of ‘8 weeks pre March 21’ shows a 
significantly higher BDI-II reduction as compared to the ‘8 weeks post March 21’ at mid- as well as the endpoint, 
but both groups were not significantly different from the ‘12 weeks’ group (see Fig. S1 in the supplement).

Effect sizes
Effect sizes for overall symptom reduction were calculated for both BSL-23 and BDI-II values. Figure 3 shows 
the effect sizes for the BSL-23 and Fig. 4 for BDI-II. As can be seen the overall effect size of treatment on BSL-
23 and BDI-II were high (reduction greater than one standard deviation of baseline scores) for the 8 week and 
12 week group. Nevertheless, 95% CIs indicate that there were no significant differences between 8 and 12 weeks. 
Regarding the three-group-comparison (8 weeks pre March 21 vs. 8 weeks post March 21 vs. 12 weeks), 95% 
CIs likewise indicate a (significant) higher effect for the group ‘8 weeks pre March 21’ compared to the ‘8 weeks 
post March 21’ in BDI-II reduction, but again, both groups were not significantly different from the ’12 weeks’ 
group (see Fig. S2 in the supplement).

Table S2 in supplement) revealed only slight, however significant differences in treatment with mood stabilizers 
and sleeping drugs. Whereas the proportions of patients with such drugs was not significantly different, the mean

The current retrospective, naturalistic study examined the efficacy of an 8 weeks DBT inpatient treatment in 
comparison to a 12 weeks DBT treatment within routine care. We found no differences regarding the reduction 
in borderline specific symptoms as well as the severity of depressive symptoms between both groups. Further-
more, both treatment groups showed high effect sizes regarding BPD-specific symptoms as well as depressive 
symptoms. Therefore, we conclude that an 8 week treatment was as effective as a longer 12 weeks treatment.

The fact that we found no difference between the two groups is even more surprising given a possible selec-
tion bias for the 12 weeks group as the patients were marked as highly motivated and were therefore given the 
opportunity to deepen their DBT knowledge and skills for another 4 weeks. One possible explication was given 
by Seow et al.26, who found no difference between a (very) short intensive DBT skills program of 5 days and 
a 12 weeks DBT treatment. Based on the good-enough level  model46,47, it is argued that treatment is a mutual 
process between patients and practitioners, whereby therapy completes in case of sufficient  improvement26. A 
lower dose regarding overall treatment length could lead to a higher effort, commitment and adherence to achieve 
a symptom reduction in a shorter period of  time26. Thus, this would be a possible explanation, as in the current 
study the decision to extend to 12 weeks was made already in the sixth week of the treatment.

The overall reduction of borderline specific and depressive symptoms in inpatient settings using DBT is in 
line with Bloom et al.28, who suggested that inpatient DBT could facilitate the treatment of BPD. Moreover, a 
shorter DBT implementation than the most commonly used 12 week duration in the inpatient setting was equally 
effective in reducing borderline-specific symptoms. In comparison to the literature, the estimated effect sizes in 
the current studies were larger. Probst et al.35 found effect sizes between d = 0.38 and d = 0.47 for intention to treat 
analysis and completers using the BSL-23 while conducting a 5 week inpatient DBT treatment. Also, Probst et al.35 
compared their effect sizes with effects reported in previous studies. Those effect sizes varied between d = 0.13 
and d = 1.4035. In addition, Seow et al.26 also had lower BSL-23 values in the inpatient setting, as well as Herzog 
et al.33 found smaller effect sizes for BSL-95. One possible reason could be that severity of borderline specific 
symptoms was higher as the observed mean percentage ranks were M = 56.8 for 8 weeks and M = 62.5 for 12 weeks 
treatment, compared to a mean percentage rank of M = 43 which corresponds to the mean raw score of 1.9 found 
by Probst et al.35. Furthermore, we had a longer treatment duration than Probst et al.35; 5 weeks. Due to our 
results, a significant symptom reduction also evolved between week 4 and week 8. Nevertheless, as stated above, 
a longer duration must not always contribute to efficacy as we did not find higher effect sizes for the 12 weeks 
treatment and found higher effect sizes compared to Bohus et al.48 although we had a shorter treatment duration.
Although we found that even shorter 8 weeks of treatment showed a significant reduction in BPD symp-
toms, several studies have shown that there is variation in the duration and even content of inpatient DBT 
 treatments3,26,28. While 12 weeks was the most common duration of therapy, our results might indicate, that it 
does not seem necessary to use this duration. Especially since patients are out of their daily routine for a quar-
ter of a year, making it more difficult to pursue their goals in real life and thus prevent social and functional 
decline. This would be consistent with the argument to establish DBT therapy primarily in the outpatient  setting1, 
although this is not always  feasible28. For this reason, there is a need to focus on what duration of therapy is 
appropriate and to strike a balance between costs and benefits. On the one hand, both health care and individual 
including the social costs of the therapy have to be considered, on the other hand, the short and long-term 
efficacy of the therapy has to be in focus. In this regard, treatment adherence and dropout rates are essential fac-
tors contributing to efficacy. Several different results show that shorter treatment duration contributes to better 
adherence and lower discontinuation  rates36,49. As psychiatric therapy shifts to an individually adapted treatment 
(e.g. 33,50,), the duration of treatment might be considered also a variable parameter regarding personalization. 
Given the fundamental changes for diagnosis of personality disorders in ICD-11 which will the future (obliga-
tory) diagnosis system in German health care, the severity categorization might also be a relevant  parameter51. 
In addition, predictive models might be used to make personalized recommendations regarding the optimal 
 therapy33. Therefore, the optimal treatment duration length should be considered when designing further treat-
ment programs. Due to our results, 8 weeks of treatment seems (highly) effective, however, should be further 
evaluated in a larger prospective and randomized study with a longer observational period (e.g. 1–2 years) and 
long-term data.

Limitations
However, consistent with Bloom et al.28, results remain difficult to compare as studies to date have contrasted 
different implementations of DBT in the inpatient setting. The implementation (especially duration and content) 
has not been compared in a standardized way so far. In the future, a more standardized comparison would be 
recommended.

One major limitation is that our study was not a randomized controlled trial comparing 8 weeks versus 
12 weeks. Also, the current study lacks a control group like treatment-as-usual. Therefore, internal validity is 
limited. In addition, the 12 week treatment group sample was small (n = 22), therefore, conclusions are limited. 
Likewise, as the group allocation was not randomized a selection bias must be assumed regarding the 12 week 
period, as it was administered to particularly motivated patients. With respect to the observational design 
and routine data collected, another limitation arises; as described, there might be unaware influencing factors 
with respect to the therapy program during the period examined. Accordingly, an additional comparison was 
conducted controlling for time dependent influences, and the findings are presented in the supplement. Aston-
ishingly, we found some differences in the reduction of depressive symptoms in the three-group comparison, 
however only between the 8 week treatment prior vs. post March 2021. Since no differences in DBT or drug 
treatment as well as setting structure took place, we assume that this might be an effect of the COVID-19 pan-
demic in Germany leading to a (further) increase especially in depressive symptoms and psychiatric  patients52.

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/Also, we found minor differences regarding treatment with psychotropic drugs between the 8 week and 
12 week conditions. Treatment with sleeping drugs and mood stabilizers was slightly more often in the 8 weeks 
group however in an overall low amount (below 5% of days in hospital) and no differences in antidepressants 
and antipsychotics occurred. Thus, we do not assume that this has affected results.

Furthermore, the present study had a retrospective focus whereas a prospective design should also be pursued 
in future studies to ensure the treatment success of abbreviated inpatient DBT programs. This could also be used 
to conduct cost-sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion
In our retrospective, naturalistic study we showed that an 8 weeks DBT inpatient treatment yielded a significant 
reduction in BPD symptoms as well as depressive symptoms. No significant differences to a 12 weeks program 
with equivalent content were found. Accordingly, abbreviated treatments could have a positive effect on costs 
and benefits compared to the common implementation of 12 week therapy programs. In particular, treatment 
programs with shorter duration give the opportunity to treat more patients overall in a consecutive time period. 
This might contribute to better patient-centered care for patients with BPD.
