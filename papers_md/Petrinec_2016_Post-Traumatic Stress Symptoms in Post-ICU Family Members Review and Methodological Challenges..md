Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms in Post-ICU Family Members: 
Review and Methodological Challenges

Abstract

Family members of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at risk for symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) following ICU discharge. The aim of this systematic review is to examine 
the current literature regarding post-ICU family PTSD symptoms with an emphasis on 
methodological issues in conducting research on this challenging phenomenon. An extensive 
review of the literature was performed confining the search to English language studies reporting 
PTSD symptoms in adult family members of adult ICU patients. Ten studies were identified for 
review published from 2004–2012. Findings demonstrate a significant prevalence of family PTSD 
symptoms in the months following ICU hospitalization. However, there are several methodological 
challenges to the interpretation of existing studies and to the conduct of future research including 
differences in sampling, identification of risk factors and covariates of PTSD, and lack of 
consensus regarding the most appropriate PTSD symptom measurement tools and timing.

More than 6.5 million patients are admitted to the ICU each year in the United States, of 
whom 540,000 will die (Bion & Hall, 2007). Patients in the ICU are often intubated, 
sedated, or neurologically compromised, which precludes them from actively participating 
in the decision-making process (Ely et al., 2001; McNicoll et al., 2003). Approximately 95% 
of ICU patients rely on a substitute decision-maker, usually a family decision maker (FDM), 
to participate in communication and decision-making with the health care providers at some 
point during their ICU illness (Prendergast, Claessens, & Luce, 1998; Smedira et al., 1990). 
Burden and stress are universal and pervasive experiences of these FDMs (Braun, Beyth, 
Ford, & McCullough, 2008; Engstrom & Soderberg, 2004; Vig, Starks, Taylor, Hopley, & 
Fryer-Edwards, 2007). A complex and prolonged ICU course, the risk of loss of a loved one, 
and the difficulty of making end-of-life decisions may add to the anxiety and stress of family 
members (Hickman, Daly, Douglas, & Clochesy, 2010). In one survey, thirty-six percent of 
family members of ICU patients were taking anxiolytic or antidepressant drugs and over 
eight percent were taking psychotropic drugs on discharge or death of their ICU family 
member (Lemiale et al., 2010). In the months following the ICU experience, family 
members are at risk for significant psychological distress including symptoms of generalized 
anxiety disorder, depression, panic disorder, and complicated grief (Anderson, Arnold, 
Angus, & Bryce, 2009; Kross et al., 2011; Siegel, Hayes, Vanderwerker, Loseth, & 
Prigerson, 2008).

High levels of stress among family members of ICU patients is commonplace (Auerbach et 
al., 2005; Chui & Chan, 2007; McAdam, Dracup, White, Fontaine, & Puntillo, 2010; 
Paparrigopoulos et al., 2006; Pielmaier, Walder, Rebetez, & Maercker, 2011). Factors shown 
to be associated with higher levels of stress include female gender, length of ICU stay, lower 
educational levels, family member trait anxiety, and family member symptoms of anxiety 
and depression (Chui & Chan, 2007; McAdam et al., 2010; Paparrigopoulos et al., 2006; 
Pielmaier et al., 2011). Most recently, a significant prevalence of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) symptoms have been recognized in post-ICU family members (Schmidt & 
Azoulay, 2012).

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, PTSD is defined as a stress 
disorder occurring at least one month after exposure to a traumatic event (5th ed.; DSM-5; 
American Psychological Association [APA], 2013). The prevalence of PTSD in the U. S. 
population is estimated to be 6.8% with women demonstrating higher rates than men 
(Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005). First described in soldiers, PTSD follows 
exposure to many different traumatic events such as personal assault, sexual assault, 
confinement, and natural disasters (Javidi & Yadollahie, 2010). More recently, PTSD has 
been recognized as a consequence of many different acute and chronic illness experiences in 
patients and their family members (Alonzo, 2000; Berna, Vaiva, Ducrocq, Duhem, & 
Nandrino, 2012; Elklit & Blum, 2011; Kross, Gries, & Curtis, 2008; Nielsen, 2003). Alonzo 
(2000) cites sudden unexpected illness onsets, invasive medical therapies, and cumulative 
adversity as stressors that potentiate the onset of post-traumatic stress symptoms. PTSD is 
associated with substantial morbidity, diminished quality of life, high levels of medical 
utilization, and high economic costs (Kessler, 2000; Pace & Heim, 2011; Seedat, Lochner, 
Vythilingum, & Stein, 2006).

Early identification of PTSD risk may allow for tailored interventions in ICU family 
members during the illness in order to reduce acute stress as well as post-traumatic stress. 
However, there are a number of methodological issues pertaining to the study of post-
traumatic stress in family members of ICU patients that can influence the validity, relevance, 
and generalizability of research in this challenging population. The purpose of this paper is 
to review the relevant literature pertaining to post-traumatic stress symptoms in ICU family 
members and the methodological challenges that must be addressed in conducting research 
in this complex and difficult area.

The salient literature was searched using PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and PsycInfo 
electronic databases. The search was limited to English language studies with no year limits. 
Keywords used in the search included: “ICU family”, “ICU decision-maker”, “stress”, “post-
traumatic stress”, “post-traumatic stress disorder”, “PTSD”, “intensive care unit”, “critical 
care”, and “family burden”. Initially, 221 articles were identified in PubMed, 80 in in 
Medline, 38 in Cinahl, and 36 in PsycInfo. After duplicates were removed, abstracts were 
reviewed to identify articles concerned with post-ICU PTSD symptoms in adult family 
members of adult ICU patients. Finally, the reference lists of the articles identified in the 
initial search were reviewed for further pertinent literature. From this search strategy, ten

studies were identified that reported on prevalence of post-ICU PTSD symptoms in families 
of adult ICU patients. The following sections will review the findings of the studies and the 
methodological challenges influencing analysis of the current literature and planning of 
future research studies.

Results

Sample

To date, ten studies have described PTSD symptoms in ICU family members of adult 
patients following ICU discharge (Anderson, Arnold, Angus, & Bryce, 2008; Azoulay et al., 
2005; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Gries et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2004; Jones, Backman, 
& Griffiths, 2012; Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam, Fontaine, White, Dracup, & Puntillo, 
2012; Pillai et al., 2006; Pillai, Aigalikar, Vishwasrao, & Husainy, 2010; see Table 1).

Identification of a representative sample of ICU family members is critical to reliable and 
generalizable findings in PTSD symptom studies. More than half the studies examined 
PTSD symptoms in family members without identifying whether they served in the FDM 
role (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2006; 
Pillai et al., 2010). Azoulay et al. (2005) and Gries et al. (2010) evaluated PTSD symptoms 
in all available family members but identified and separately analyzed those family members 
that participated in decision-making. Anderson et al. (2008), Lautrette et al. (2007), and 
McAdam et al. (2012) examined PTSD symptoms in only FDMs. In most studies, samples 
have been generated using consecutive convenience sampling techniques, which may limit 
generalizability of study findings. The samples tended to be homogeneous and 
predominantly Caucasian (63–88%) although some French authors differentiated samples by 
whether family members were French or other nationality (Anderson et el., 2008; Garrouste-
Orgeas et al., 2012; Gries et al., 2010; Lautrette et al., 2007).

Enrollment of ICU family members into clinical studies early in the ICU hospitalization can 
be difficult. Initial consent refusal rates are not always published in studies but have been 
reported to range from five to thirty eight percent (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 
2005; Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2010). Reasons for refusal to 
participate can include high levels of acute stress, sensitive questions about PTSD 
symptoms, inability to understand the study, and disinterest in participating in research. In 
the author’s experience, the most common reason given by family members for refusal to 
participate is the feeling of being overwhelmed by the ICU experience. Participation in a 
study represents an added burden and responsibility at a time when personal resources are 
already seemingly stretched to their limit.

Setting

The type of ICU or ICU population (surgical, medical, trauma, etc.) may influence stress and 
prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Different types of ICU settings, which reflect different 
population characteristics, may be associated with varied sets of expectations based on the 
age of the patients, the suddenness of the illness, and the anticipated outcomes. Chui and 
Chan (2007) found that family stress levels were higher in families of ICU patients who

experienced an unplanned ICU admission compared to families of individuals who 
experienced a planned ICU admission (IESM = 26.2 vs IESM = 22.9, p = .03). Diagnosis at 
the time of admission did not influence stress levels. However, Azoulay et al. (2005) 
reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms in family members of ICU patients admitted for 
malignancy and hematologic disorders and lower levels in families of ICU patients admitted 
with chronic heart failure (p < .05). Pillai et al. (2010) demonstrated no difference in family 
PTSD symptom prevalence when comparing trauma and medical ICU families two months 
after the ICU illness.

The country from which the sample is taken can also influence the prevalence of PTSD 
symptoms. In general, French cohort studies have reported higher prevalence of PTSD 
symptoms than US, UK, or Indian cohorts, with a symptom prevalence of 33–82% (Azoulay 
et al., 2005; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Lautrette et al., 2007). The remaining cohorts 
report a symptom prevalence of 14–46% (Anderson et al., 2008; Gries et al., 2010; Jones et 
al., 2004, 2012; McAdam et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2006, 2010). Gries et al. (2010) suggested 
that cultural factors may explain some of the differences in PTSD symptom prevalence 
between French cohorts and US cohorts. The authors reported that discordance between 
decision-making preferences and actual decision-making role was associated with increased 
PTSD symptoms. The French medical system tends to be a more paternalistic system in 
which the physician has the final say in regard to decision making with variable amounts of 
input from family members (Pochard, Azoulay, Chevret, Vinsonneau, & Herve, 2001). This 
may impact the discordance between decision-making preference and actual decision-
making role.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patient—Characteristics of the patient and the patient’s ICU course can influence the risk 
of PTSD in family members. The majority of patients admitted to an ICU stabilize quickly 
and are discharged after a short ICU stay (Society of Critical Care Medicine, 2012; Wiencek 
& Winkelman, 2010). Most studies examining PTSD symptoms in ICU family members 
have excluded patients who stabilize quickly by only including patients with an ICU stay of 
at least 48 hours (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; 
Jones et al., 2004, 2012; McAdam et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2010). Intuitively, a short 
uncomplicated ICU stay would seem to be less likely to increase the risk of PTSD symptoms 
in family members when compared to families who experience a long and complicated ICU 
course. However, several studies have demonstrated no relationship between patient ICU 
length of stay and family member prevalence of PTSD symptoms (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 
2012; Jones et al., 2004; Lautrette et al., 2007).

The relationship between severity of ICU illness and family PTSD symptoms is also unclear. 
Azoulay et al. (2005) demonstrated a significant relationship between severity of illness and 
PTSD symptoms while other authors have found no association (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 
2012; Jones et al., 2004). Garrouste-Orgeas et al. (2012) reported a relationship between the 
patient need for mechanical ventilation and subsequent PTSD symptoms among family 
members. Furthermore, ICU hospitalization outcome (death or discharge of the patient) may 
also influence PTSD symptoms. Azoulay et al. (2005) and Pillai et al. (2010) identified

patient death as a risk factor for ICU family PTSD symptoms while Anderson et al. (2008) 
and McAdam et al. (2012) found no difference between bereaved and non-bereaved family 
members.

Family—In identifying the target sample for study of post-ICU family member PTSD 
symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria are clearly important. Investigating all family 
members available during a patient’s ICU stay would be one option for investigating PTSD 
symptoms (Azoulay et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2004). Other options would be to identify a 
“primary” family member using next of kin rules or identifying family members who are 
thought to be at higher risk of PTSD symptoms after ICU hospitalization (Anderson et al., 
2008; Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam et al., 2012). Several characteristics have been 
identified as risk factors in ICU family members.

Family decision-maker role: Family members are often called upon to make medical 
treatment decisions on behalf of their incapacitated critically ill loved one. Family surrogate 
decision makers experience many conflicting emotions and tension in the role (Schenker et 
al., 2012, 2013). Predictors of lower confidence in family decision-making role include lack 
of prior decision-making experience, lack of prior discussions with the patient about 
treatment preferences, and poor quality of communication with the ICU physician (Majesko, 
Hong, Weissfeld, & White, 2012). Azoulay et al. (2005) identified decision-making as a 
factor that increased the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in ICU family members. Higher 
rates of PTSD symptoms were noted among those who shared in decision-making (47.8%) 
with the highest prevalence of PTSD symptoms found in family members whose decisions 
involved end-of-life issues (81.8%). Lautrette et al. (2007), Anderson et al., (2008), and 
McAdam et al. (2012) also reported a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms among FDMs 
(69%, 35%, and 42% respectively). Several studies do not identify family members who 
participated in decision-making making comparisons among studies difficult (Jones et al., 
2004; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2006, 2010). Gries and colleagues (2010) 
reported a low overall prevalence of PTSD symptoms in ICU families (14%) but identified 
discordance between decision-making preferences and actual decision-making role as a risk 
factor for PTSD symptoms (p = .005). In a secondary analysis of the study population in 
Gries et al. (2010), Kross et al. (2011) described higher levels of PTSD symptoms in family 
members who participated in early family conferences, which may indicate discordance 
between actual and desired decision-making role or lack of time to mentally prepare and 
accept the impending death of a loved one.

Concordance between decision-making preference and actual decision-making role may be 
an important factor in the association between decision-making and PTSD symptoms. 
Variability in the clear identification of family decision-makers in the family ICU PTSD 
literature hampers comparisons between studies. Furthermore, some families prefer and 
utilize a shared decision-making approach, obtaining consensus among members of the 
family, while conflict between family members and lack of consensus during decision-
making can increase the stress of the decision-making role (Vig et al., 2007). Thus, the FDM 
role has variations in expectation and experience that may influence the risk of PTSD 
symptoms. Future studies on post-ICU family PTSD symptoms should clearly identify the

FDM and investigate other FDM variables such as role preference, decision-making style, 
and family concordance.

Family member gender: Some authors associate female gender with a higher risk of family 
member PTSD symptoms following critical illness (Azoulay et al., 2005; Gries et al., 2010). 
Other authors have not demonstrated this relationship (Anderson et al., 2008; Garrouste-
Orgeas et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2010). However, female gender has been identified as an 
independent risk factor for the development of PTSD in other patient populations such as 
combat, victims of crime, natural disasters, and motor vehicle accidents (Brewin, Andrews 
& Valentine, 2000; Javidi & Yadollahie, 2012).

Family member-patient relationship: Several authors have described associations between 
the nature of the relationship between family member and patient and PTSD symptoms 
(Azoulay et al., 2005; Gries et al., 2010; Kross et al., 2011). Azoulay et al. (2005) reported 
adult children of ICU patients having higher rates of PTSD symptoms compared to other 
familial relationships such as parent or sibling (p < .05). Gries et al. (2010) found that 
having a relationship with the patient other than spouse or adult child and knowing the 
patient for a shorter length of time was associated with higher prevalence of PTSD 
symptoms (p = .003). Kross et al. (2011) reported that family members of older patients had 
lower levels of PTSD symptoms and suggested that critical illness and death of younger 
patients may place family members at higher risk of psychological burden. Echoing this 
idea, Pillai et al. (2010) found a higher prevalence of PTSD symptoms in parents of ICU 
patients. Given the largely disparate findings in these studies as with other variables, a firm 
association between the FDM-patient relationship and PTSD symptoms is elusive.

Family member level of education: Pillai et al. (2010) described a higher prevalence of 
PTSD symptoms among family members who never completed high school. The authors 
suggest that this relationship may be due to lower social support and inadequate coping 
resources. The relationship between level of education and risk of PTSD symptoms has not 
been described in other ICU family populations but has been reported in other PTSD 
populations with lower levels of education being associated with a higher prevalence of 
PTSD symptoms (Brewin et al., 2000).

Family member psychological treatment history: Gries et al. (2010) noted medical care 
for psychological symptoms (medication use or outpatient counseling) in the year prior to 
ICU admission of a family member was associated with increased PTSD symptoms. 
Obtaining sensitive information on the psychiatric history of ICU family members can be 
difficult and may cause some to shy away from participating in a study of PTSD or refusal to 
answer particular questions about their psychological history. The influence of pre-
admission psychological issues is important because persons with a significant burden of 
PTSD symptoms also have an increased risk for concomitant depression, anxiety, and 
complicated grief (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 
2012; Gries et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2004; Lautrette et al., 2007; Siegel et al., 2008).

Attrition—Although ICU family members are usually identified for participation in PTSD 
symptom studies during the ICU hospitalization, the measurement of PTSD symptoms is

typically performed at a time point after the ICU experience. Attrition of participants can 
decrease the power and generalizability of the findings. In post-ICU PTSD symptom studies, 
attrition rates have been reported of 14 percent to 57 percent (Anderson et el., 2008; 
Azoulay et al., 2005; Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Gries et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2004; 
Jones et al., 2012; Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2006; Pillai et al., 
2010). Although it is difficult to know, family members suffering the most from PTSD 
symptoms may also be the most likely to decline continued participation in a study 
following the ICU illness. Cross sectional study designs may decrease attrition rates when 
compared to longitudinal designs but limit the ability to determine causal and sequential 
relationships or changes in variables over time. One possible strategy to limit attrition is 
provision of an incentive for family members to complete the study, but there is no evidence 
that this is effective.

Measurement

Measurement of the phenomenon is central to the validity of any study. In the case of PTSD 
symptoms, there have been a variety of instruments and interpretations of scales. The 
instruments reflect the diagnostic criteria of PTSD and are intended to measure the 
prevalence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Therefore, an understanding of PTSD 
diagnostic criteria is essential in selecting an instrument that effectively measures PTSD 
symptoms.

PTSD Diagnostic Criteria—PTSD was first recognized as a psychiatric disorder with the 
publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-III) of the APA (3rd ed.; 1980). The diagnostic criteria for PTSD were further refined 
in the DSM-IV-TR (4th ed.; text rev.; APA, 2000) and recently published DSM-5 (5th ed.; 
APA, 2013). The tools used to measure post-traumatic stress symptoms in post-ICU family 
members were developed to reflect the diagnostic criteria enumerated in the DSM-III and 
DSM-IV-TR. The following section will briefly discuss the diagnostic criteria of PTSD as 
described in the DSM-IV-TR, the tools used to measure PTSD symptoms, and the changes 
in PTSD diagnosis recently proposed in the DSM-5.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be characterized as a prolonged stress response 
syndrome (Wilson, 2004). According to the DSM-IV-TR, PTSD occurs after exposure to a 
stressor in which the person experiences or witnesses events that threaten death or serious 
harm to the individual or others (APA, 2000). The individual experiences feelings of fear, 
helplessness, or horror during exposure to the stressor. The exposure to the stressor results in 
three symptom clusters that must be present for at least a month after exposure to the 
stressor: intrusive recollections, avoidant/numbing symptoms, and hyper-arousal symptoms. 
The symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in personal, social, or occupational 
functioning.

Several important changes to the diagnostic criteria of PTSD can be found in the DSM-5 
(APA, 2013). First, PTSD is no longer classified as an anxiety disorder but is described in a 
new section identified as trauma and stress related disorders. In the most recent guidelines, 
the traumatic event is delineated as exposure to actual or threatened death of self or a loved

experienced by police officers or first responders is specifically included. The DSM-5 
expands the three symptom clusters from DSM-IV-TR to four symptom clusters: re-
experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and arousal. Similar to the DSM-IV-
TR, the symptoms need to be present for more than a month after removal of the traumatic 
stressor. However, the designation of chronic PTSD for symptoms that persist greater than 
six months has been removed. For individuals with prominent dissociative symptoms, a 
dissociative subtype of PTSD has been added. See Table 2 for a summary of differences 
between DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5.

Measurement Tools—Several tools have been used in studies examining post-ICU PTSD 
symptoms. Decisions about which measurement tool is best suited for studying PTSD 
symptoms in ICU family members are important when discussing reliability and 
generalizability of study findings.

Impact of Event Scale (IES): The Impact of Event Scale (IES) is an instrument for 
detecting symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Horowitz, Wilner, and Alvarez (1979) 
proposed the original IES. The scale provides information on both the presence of stress 
related symptoms and their severity. The 15-item instrument has two subscales: intrusion 
and avoidance. The items are scored on a four point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = rarely, 3 = 
sometimes, 5 = often). The total score ranges from 0 to 75 with higher scores indicating 
higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. The scale has been used in many different 
populations to measure PTSD symptoms and following many different stressors (Sundin & 
Horowitz, 2002). The IES has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity across a range 
of traumatic events and outcome studies. The scale is simple, versatile, and can be 
administered over the phone.

Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to measure PTSD symptoms in four studies 
(Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2004; Lautrette et al., 2007). Three 
groups of investigators used scores greater than 30 to identify individuals with significant 
PTSD symptoms and high risk for PTSD (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; 
Lautrette et al., 2007). Jones et al. (2004) used IES scores greater than 19 to identify 
individuals whose symptoms were concerning for PTSD. The cutoff scores are not used to 
identify individuals with PTSD but to estimate the risk of having PTSD. Horowitz (1982) 
initially described scores above 19 as representative of high symptom levels. The difference 
between using 19 or 30 as a cutoff score significantly impacts the ability to make 
comparisons between studies.

Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R): Weiss and Marmar (1997) released a revised 
version of the IES with three subscales corresponding to the three symptom clusters 
described in the DSM-IV-TR. The IES-R is a 22-item instrument scored using a 5-point 
scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for each item. Total scores may range from 
0–88 with higher scores indicating higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Three 
mean sub-scores may also be computed: the intrusion subscore (seven items), the avoidance 
subscore (eight items), and the hyperarousal subscore (seven items). The intrusion score 
reflects how persistently thoughts and impressions associated with the event reappear. The

avoidance score assesses behaviors designed at avoiding people, places, or activities that act 
as reminders of the stressful event. The hyperarousal score reflects physiologic symptoms 
such as insomnia, irritability, and hypervigilance.

Several authors have reported reliability for the IES-R. Creamer, Bell, and Falilla (2003) 
reported a Cronbach’s α of .96 in a sample of Vietnam veterans with and without confirmed 
PTSD. High levels of internal consistency for the subscales have been reported: intrusion 
(Cronbach’s α = .87 – .94); avoidance (Cronbach’s α = .84 – .87); hyperarousal 
(Cronbach’s α = .79 – .91; Creamer et al., 2003; Weiss & Marmar, 1997). Test-retest 
reliability across a six month interval ranged from .89 to .94 (Weiss & Marmar, 1997). Beck 
et al. (2008) examined the psychometric properties of the IES-R in a sample of motor 
vehicle accident survivors. The authors reported Cronbach’s α for the total scale (.95) as 
well as the three subscales: intrusion (.90), avoidance (.86), and hyperarousal (.85). Creamer 
et al. (2003) reported concurrent validity with a correlation of .84 between the IES-R and the 
PTSD Checklist. Creamer et al. (2003) also reported good discriminative validity of the IES-
R for the diagnosis of PTSD. Scores above 33 were highly predictive of the diagnosis of 
PTSD with a sensitivity of .91 and a specificity of .82. Beck et al. (2008) reported lower 
sensitivity and specificity for correctly predicting PTSD at 77.6 and 61.9 respectively. 
McAdam et al. (2012) used the total IES-R score of 33 (reported as a mean score of 1.5) 
recommended by Creamer et al. (2003) to represent high risk of PTSD symptoms. 
Garrouste-Orgeas et al. (2012) used IES-R scores above 22 while Pillai et al. (2006, 2010) 
used IES-R scores above 26 to identify individuals with significant symptoms of PTSD. 
Variability in the cutoff scores used to identify individuals with “high” levels of PTSD 
symptoms using the IES and IES-R makes comparisons between studies difficult and may 
explain inconsistent findings.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C): The PCL-C is a 17-
item self-report rating scale to assess symptoms of PTSD (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, 
& Keane, 1994). The items are scored on a five point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little bit, 3 = 
moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely). The 17 items are divided into three subscales that 
correspond with the three symptom clusters of PTSD described in the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 
2000). The PCL-C can be scored two different ways. The total score can range from 17 to 85 
with higher scores indicating higher PTSD symptom severity. Weathers et al. (1994) 
suggested a cutoff score of 50 and above as a predictor of PTSD risk in male military 
veterans. Blanchard, Jones-Alexander, Buckley, and Forneris (1996) found a cutoff score of 
44 and above to have better diagnostic efficacy in a sample of motor vehicle and sexual 
assault victims with a sensitivity of .94 and a specificity of .86. Each individual item can 
also be scored dichotomously with scores of three or greater considered a symptom while 
scores of one or two are not. Significant risk for PTSD requires one intrusive symptom, three 
avoidant symptoms, and two arousal symptoms. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .94 with 
test-retest correlation coefficients of .92 at immediate retest, .88 at one week retest, and .68 
at two weeks retest in a sample of university students (Ruggiero, Del Ben, Scotti & Rabalais, 
2003). The authors reported good convergent validity with other PTSD symptom scales and 
discriminant validity with a diagnosis of PTSD. Similar psychometric properties have been 
demonstrated by other authors (Dobie et al., 2002; Walker, Newman, Dobie, Ciechanowski,

& Katon, 2002). However, Gries et al. (2010) is the only study that used PCL-C in 
examining post-ICU family PTSD symptoms.

Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome 14-Question Inventory (PTSS-14): Jones et al. (2012) 
utilized the PTSS-14 in a United Kingdom (UK) family member PTSD pilot study. The 
PTSS-14 was developed in the UK as a simple and easy to administer screening tool for 
PTSD symptoms incorporating diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV-TR (Twigg, Humphries, 
Jones, Bramwell & Griffiths, 2008). The structure of the instrument is based on the PTSS-10 
which was reflective of the diagnostic criteria of DSM-III (Holen, Sund, & Weisaeth, 1983). 
The PTSS-14 is composed of two parts. Part A consists of four yes/no questions about 
memories that relatives may have from the time of the critical care illness (e.g., nightmares, 
breathlessness, anxiety). Part B consists of 14 questions about PTSD symptoms scored on a 
one to seven scale (1 = never, 7 = always). Total score can range from 14 to 98 with higher 
scores indicating more severe PTSD symptoms. Although psychometric testing in ICU 
patients has been sparse, one study by Twigg et al. (2008) demonstrated good internal 
consistency, test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity.

Summary of PTSD measurement tools: A complete discussion of the measurement tools 
available for assessing PTSD symptoms in all populations is beyond the scope of the current 
discussion. Only the tools used to date in studies examining PTSD symptoms in post-ICU 
family members have been discussed. The tools used to measure PTSD symptoms reflect the 
symptom clusters delineated in the DSM manual. It should be noted that none of the scales 
are intended to make the diagnosis of PTSD but to indicate the degree to which PTSD 
symptoms are being experienced or as a screening tool for individuals who may benefit from 
more formal testing for PTSD. The lack of standardization in measurement tools for 
assessing PTSD symptoms in post-ICU family members not only makes comparison of 
studies difficult and explain some of the variation in the prevalence of PTSD symptoms, but 
also raises questions of validity. To date, there is no strong consensus about which 
instrument or cut-off values correlate best with the diagnostic gold standard, a full 
psychiatric assessment by a mental health professional.

Timing of Measurement—The time after ICU admission at which PTSD symptoms were 
measured is another source of variation among the studies. Measurements of PTSD 
symptoms occurred from 2 months to several years after ICU discharge. Studies measuring 
PTSD symptoms within six months of the ICU illness reported a prevalence of PTSD 
symptoms from 33% to 69% (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2004; 
Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam et al., 2012; Pillai et al., 2010). Prevalence of PTSD 
symptoms measured greater than six months after ICU death or discharge varied widely. 
Garrouste-Orgeas et al. (2012) described a prevalence of PTSD symptoms measured at 12 
months after ICU discharge to be 68–80%. Gries et al. (2010) reported a prevalence of 
PTSD symptoms of 14% measured at least six months and up to four years after ICU death. 
Pillai et al. (2006) measured PTSD symptoms two years after ICU discharge reporting a 
moderate severity symptom prevalence of 12–14% and severe symptom prevalence of 4–5%.

Measurement of PTSD symptoms at a certain time point after ICU discharge is somewhat 
arbitrary, especially when the patient survives the ICU illness. Death of the patient is a clear

event to determine an appropriate later time point (at least one month after death) to measure 
PTSD symptoms. However, the magnitude of the PTSD symptoms arising from the loss of a 
loved one are difficult to separate from the symptoms resulting from the ICU experience. 
When the patient survives, discharge from the ICU or from the hospital does not necessarily 
remove ongoing stressors. Some patients may be discharged to a long term care facility with 
persistent chronic medical issues. Other patients may experience a long hospital course 
following transfer out of the ICU prior to hospital discharge. Patients who are discharged 
home may require significant care giving from their family members. Family members may 
feel ill-prepared to care for a chronically ill family member (Schmidt & Azoulay, 2012). The 
phenomenon of caregiver burden is well described in other populations and may contribute 
to ongoing stress in family members following hospital discharge (Chenier, 1997; Etters, 
Goodall & Harrison, 2008; Grunfeld et al., 2004). In a study of caregivers of long-term 
ventilator patients, Douglas and Daly (2003) demonstrated a drop in physical health scores 
and elevated caregiver overload scores as significant contributors to symptoms of depression 
in family member caregivers. A continuum of ongoing stressors arise or persist after the ICU 
hospitalization that can significantly impact the levels of PTSD symptoms experienced by 
family members. Furthermore, controlling for these various stressors in a research setting 
can be difficult.

Discussion

The demand and use of ICU services has increased steadily since the middle of the 20th 
century and the growth is expected to continue with the aging population. The psychological 
impact of critical care illness can continue to affect the patient and family long after the ICU 
illness is over. Family members provide support and decision-making during and after the 
ICU illness. Often, they are also providing direct care after discharge from the hospital. 
Symptoms of PTSD in this vulnerable group can be significant and can impact their ability 
to function in society. A better understanding of the experience of ICU family members, the 
risk factors for developing PTSD symptoms, and opportunities for intervening in the stress 
response may provide opportunities to provide family centered care in the ICU environment.

As has been noted earlier, there are several methodological challenges in studying PTSD in 
post-ICU families. Obtaining an adequate sample can be challenging and is influenced by 
enrollment procedures and attrition rates. Variables to consider in obtaining a representative 
sample include type of ICU, patient diagnosis, and cultural factors. Although the data 
establishing risk is not strong, focusing on family members who are likely to be at higher 
risk for PTSD symptoms, decision-makers and families of patients at risk for a prolonged 
ICU course, may be the most efficient approach to identify modifiable factors that influence 
the severity and prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, obtaining an accurate 
psychological history of ICU family members also appears to be important in assessing 
PTSD symptom risk. Symptoms of complicated grief, anxiety, and depression are commonly 
reported along with PTSD symptoms (Anderson et al., 2008; Azoulay et al., 2005; 
Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Gries et al., 2010; Lautrette et al., 2007; McAdam et al., 
2012; Pillai et al., 2010)

Measurement challenges include choice of measurement tool and timing of PTSD symptom 
measurement. The IES-R and PCL-C instruments have been used previously in ICU family 
members and demonstrate adequate psychometric properties. Standardization of the 
measurement instrument used in PTSD research for ICU families would help limit 
variability in prevalence and severity of symptoms reported in the literature. The IES-R has 
been most widely used, and at this point, enables the greatest amount of comparison among 
studies. However, recent changes in the diagnostic criteria of PTSD in DSM-5 will almost 
certainly prompt further revisions in the measurement tools for PTSD symptoms, given the 
history of changes that occurred after publication of previous editions of the DSM manual. 
With the recognition of post intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F) by the Society of 
Critical Care Medicine and increasing research in studying the experience of post-ICU 
family members, some recommendations about the best tool for assessing PTSD symptoms 
may be forthcoming to help guide future investigations (Needham et al., 2012). Additionally, 
reporting PTSD symptom prevalence is clearly influenced by measurement time frame. 
Family members experiencing early symptoms of PTSD (three to six months after ICU 
discharge) should be reported separately from individuals experiencing symptoms one or 
several years after the ICU illness.

A better understanding of the post-ICU factors that promote PTSD symptoms is essential to 
understanding the phenomenon. Longitudinal studies examining the trajectory of family 
PTSD symptoms following ICU hospitalization are needed. Examination of coping 
strategies used by ICU family members may help elucidate the dynamic relationship 
between the stress of the ICU experience and the adaptation or maladaptation experienced 
afterword. Additionally, the influence of caregiver burden and ongoing post-ICU stressors 
have received little attention to date. While some intervention studies have demonstrated a 
reduced prevalence and severity of PTSD symptoms, better understanding of the mechanism 
of these interventions is needed to guide further refinement in identification and support of 
at risk family members (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Lautrette et al., 
2007). It is clear that ICU families struggle during and after the ICU experience. Further 
studies are necessary to understand their experience and to tailor interventions that may have 
a beneficial effect in reducing stress and PTSD symptoms.

Summary of Changes to PTSD Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5

Table 2

Stressor

DSM-IV-TR

DSM-5

The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which 
both of the following have been present:

•

•

The person has experienced, witnessed, or 
been confronted with an event or events that 
involve actual or threatened death or serious 
injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of 
oneself or others.

The person’s response involved intense fear, 
helplessness, or horror.

Similar language to DSM-IV-TR in regard to event or 
stressor with specific language specifying repeated 
prolonged exposure to stressful situations (e.g. police 
officers or first responders)
The response of intense fear, helplessness, or horror has 
been removed since it did not have utility in predicting 
PTSD

Symptom Clusters

3 Clusters:

4 Clusters:

•

•

•

Intrusive recollections

Avoidance

Hyperarousal

•

•

•

•

Re-experiencing

Avoidance

Negative cognitions and mood

Arousal

Duration

Subtypes

Duration of symptoms is more than 1 month

Duration of symptoms is more than 1 month

Chronic- symptom duration of greater than 3 months
Delayed onset-symptom onset greater than 6 months after 
stressor

Chronic and delayed subtypes removed
Preschool subtype-children younger than 6 years
Dissociative subtype-prominent dissociative symptoms

PTSD = Post-traumatic stress disorder; DSM-IV = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR;DSM-5 = Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5
