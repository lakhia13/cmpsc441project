Background

A B S T R A C T

Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a
range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden
experienced  is  associated  with  characteristics  of  the  caregiver,  such  as  gender,  and  characteristics  of  the  person  with  dementia,  such
as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to
residential care for people with dementia.

Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge
about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve
feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous,
varying  in  their  theoretical  framework,  components,  and  delivery  formats.  Interventions  that  are  delivered  remotely,  using  printed
materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services
because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment
measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such
circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life
of informal caregivers of people with dementia.

Search methods

We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other
databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers
and published trials.

Selection criteria

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who
were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's
community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could
not  involve  any  face-to-face  contact  with  professionals.  We  categorised  intervention  components  as  information,  training  or  support.
Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive
role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in
practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy.

Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were
caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and
quality of life of the person with dementia.

Data collection and analysis

Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors.
We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses
using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect
estimates.

Main results

We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without
information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the
same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants).

We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of
bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not
always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty.

In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental
interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD)
-0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or
health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result
in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53).

In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions
may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in
a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no
difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in
an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20).

Authors' conclusions

Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden
and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual
treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving
training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The
efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.

Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia

Review questions

We were interested in remotely delivered interventions involving information, training and support for family caregivers of people with
dementia. By remotely delivered, we meant that they were provided over the telephone or on a computer or mobile electronic device.
We asked whether these kinds of intervention helped caregivers more than doing nothing, and also whether interventions that included
elements of training and support worked better than simple provision of information about dementia.

Background

Caring  for  a  family  member  or  friend  with  dementia  can  offer  positive  experiences,  but  often  also  has  negative  consequences  for  the
caregiver.  These  negative  consequences  may  be  emotional,  physical,  social  and  financial,  and  are  sometimes  described  as  caregiver

'burden.' Many interventions have been developed to try to help caregivers in their caring role. Often, these interventions involve several
components. In this review we divided the intervention components into information (increasing caregivers' knowledge about dementia),
training (helping them to practice important skills for successful caring) and support (providing an opportunity to share experiences and
feelings with other people). We chose to review only interventions delivered remotely, in part because we were writing during the COVID-19
pandemic, when many countries required people to remain in their homes. However, remotely delivered interventions may also be useful
in many other kinds of situations when it is difficult for caregivers to access services in person.

Study characteristics

We  searched  up  to  April  2020  for  randomised  controlled  trials  that  addressed  our  review  questions.  We  found  12  studies  with  944
participants that compared groups of caregivers receiving usual care, or some non-specific contact with researchers, with other groups
receiving remotely delivered interventions that involved information with training, support or both. We found another 14 studies with
1423 participants that compared simple information provision with more complex interventions that involved training or support. The
interventions lasted an average of 16 weeks. Three studies took place in China; all the others were from North America or Europe. About
half used the telephone and about half used the Internet to deliver the interventions.

What are the main results of our review?

Compared with the usual services provided for caregivers where the studies took place, or with non-specific contact with the researchers,
we  found  that  the  information,  training  and  support  interventions  probably  had  no  important  effect  on  caregivers'  overall  burden,
depressive symptoms, or quality of life. Caregivers in both groups may have been equally likely to drop out of the studies for any reason.
Compared to information only, interventions which included training and support may result in a slight reduction of caregiver burden,
probably reduce depressive symptoms, may have little or no effect on quality of life, and probably make it more likely that caregivers
drop out of the studies. We did not find any obvious effects of different intervention components, but we were not able to draw any firm
conclusions about this. There was no evidence on whether the interventions improved the quality of life of the people with dementia who
were being cared for. We did not find any studies that reported harmful effects of the interventions or the additional burden they might
add to the caregiver's life. We do not know how the interventions would perform in countries where few health and social care services are
available for people with dementia and their families, or in situations where caregivers are unable to access usual services.

How reliable are these results?

We found that most studies were well-conducted, but because most outcomes were subjective, there was a risk that the expectations of
the caregivers and researchers could have influenced results. For some outcomes, there were inconsistent results among studies. Overall,
our confidence in our findings was moderate or low so the results could be affected by further research.

Description of the condition

It  is  estimated  that  worldwide,  about  50  million  people  have
dementia,  and  there  are  nearly  10  million  new  cases  every  year
(WHO  2020).  Many  people  with  dementia  are  being  cared  for  at
home  by  an  unpaid  informal  caregiver,  who  is  usually  a  female
family  member,  often  a  spouse  or  daughter.  It  is  estimated  that
family caregivers spend five to 20 hours per day and an average of 60
hours per week caring for the person living with dementia (Marziali
2006).

As  a  consequence  of  their  role  as  caregiver  of  a  person  with  a
progressive  and  irreversible  disease,  the  informal  caregiver  may
experience  a  range  of  physical,  emotional,  financial  and  social
harms (Collins 2011). This situation has been widely described in
the  literature  and  is  known  as  caregiver  burden  (Dillehay  1990;
George 1986). Caregiver burden is associated with characteristics
of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person
with dementia, such as behavioural problems, stage of dementia
and the presence of neuropsychiatric disturbances (Haley 2004). It
is a strong predictor of a move from home care to residential care
for people with dementia (Eska 2013).

Description of the intervention

A  variety  of  psychosocial  interventions  have  been  suggested  to
prevent  or  to  reduce  the  negative  consequences  of  dementia
care on informal caregivers (Cooke 2001; Etters 2008; Pusey 2001;
Selwood  2007).  The  interventions  are  generally  heterogeneous
regarding  (i)  their  theoretical  framework,  (ii)  the  focus  and  the
type  of  interventions  reported  (e.g.  behavioural  intervention,
stress  management,  education  about  the  disease),  and  (iii)  the
administration format (group or individual, generic or tailored to
specific needs, telephone- or Internet-based).

Interventions that are delivered remotely using written materials,
the telephone or Internet may be particularly suitable for caregivers
of  people  with  dementia  who  can  struggle  to  access  face-to-
face  services  because  of  their  own  health  problems,  poor  access
to  transport,  or  difficulties  finding  substitute  care.  At  the  time
of  writing,  measures  used  by  many  countries  to  contain  the
COVID-19  pandemic  require  that  most  people,  including  people
with  dementia  and  their  family  carers,  are  confined  to  their
homes,  isolating  themselves  from  direct  contact  with  others.  In
such  circumstances,  there  is  no  alternative  to  remote  delivery  of
interventions.

There  are  also,  however,  significant  barriers  to  remote  delivery
of interventions, particularly for older caregivers. They may have
sensory  impairments  or  other  disabilities  that  make  use  of  the
necessary  technologies  difficult.  They  may  also  lack  confidence
with  the  technologies  involved  and  may  particularly  value  direct
contact with others, being less familiar than many younger people
with the experience of finding support in online communities.

This  review  assesses  the  efficacy  and  acceptability  of  remotely
delivered interventions that aim to offer information, training and
support,  or  a  mixture  of  these,  to  informal  carers  of  people  with
dementia.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Information

We considered information interventions to have two key elements:
(i)  they  involve  the  provision  of  standardised  information  whose
contents are determined by the professional; and (ii) the participant
has a passive role (i.e. there is no interaction with the professional
or  active  practice  of  skills).  The  intervention  can  address  various
aspects: issues related to the person with dementia (e.g. signs and
symptoms, natural history, treatments and care alternatives), their
care  (e.g.  activities  of  daily  living,  nutrition,  communication  with
the person with dementia), the difficulties derived from their care
(behavioural  problems,  role  incompatibility,  use  of  drugs,  sleep
disturbances), or resources available in the community (Gallagher-
Thompson 2010). The format of implementation can vary: leaflets,
manuals,  lectures  or  audio-visual  presentations.  The  nature  of
these interventions makes them relatively easy to deliver remotely.

Training

The key element of training interventions is to provide caregivers
with the practical skills to manage the burden of care. Caregivers
will  play  an  active  role  in  the  program  (e.g.  through  supervised
practice,  or  role  playing).  The  training  may  relate  to  the  care  of
the  person  with  dementia  (e.g.  recognising  behavioural  triggers,
communicating  more  effectively,  tailoring  tasks  to  patients'
capabilities)  or  to  management  of  the  caregiver's  psychological
stress.  Training  can  be  classified  into  the  following  categories:
(i)  meeting  patients'  basic  care  needs,  (ii)  managing  behavioural
problems,  and  (iii)  managing  and  coping  with  caregiver  stress
(Losada  Baltar  2004;  Martin-Carrasco  2014).  Delivery  of  these
elements remotely is likely to be more challenging than the simple
provision of information.

Support

The key element of support interventions is the participants' active
role in discussing and sharing feelings, problems or issues related
to care with other caregivers and professionals (Winter 2006). This
category  could  include  two  types  of  support:  (i)  peer  support
(e.g. participation in a caregivers' group that is not professionally
facilitated), and (ii) professional support (e.g. receiving counselling
from a health professional) (Mittelman 2004). Peer support groups,
in particular, are usually face-to-face, but as technologies develop,
it is increasingly possible for these to take place online.

How the intervention might work

Interventions for caregivers of people with dementia may work in a
variety of ways depending on the content. Broadly speaking, they
are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease
and its care (Ducharme 2011; Liddle 2012); to increase their sense
of  competence  (Laakkonen  2012)  and  their  ability  to  cope  with
difficult situations (e.g. behavioural disturbances, communication
problems) (Cheng 2012); and to relieve feelings of isolation, as well
as to allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical
needs (Roth 2009).

Why it is important to do this review

Throughout  the  world,  the  majority  of  care  for  people  with
dementia  is  provided  by  family  members.  Anything  that  can  be
done to ease the burden of this care will be good for the caregivers
and  for  the  people  they  care  for.  It  may  also  ease  the  burden
on  health  and  social  care  systems,  for  example  by  improving
caregivers' health and by delaying institutional care for the person

with dementia. All health and care systems are struggling with the
magnitude of the problem presented by dementia. Remote delivery
of interventions to support caregivers, if acceptable and effective,
offers  the  opportunity  to  reach  more  people  than  conventional
services, potentially at lower cost.

Development  of  remotely  delivered  interventions  acquired  a
new  urgency  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The
strain  on  family  caregivers  who  are  isolated  with  a  person
with  dementia  is  hugely  magnified.  Not  only  are  they  cut  off
from  their  usual  community  and  professional  supports,  but  so
is  the  person  with  dementia,  whose  behaviour  may  be  more
challenging  as  a  result.  Because  of  their  age  and  vulnerability,
these groups may experience more prolonged periods of isolation
than other members of the community. Identification of effective
interventions  for  caregivers  that  can  be  delivered  remotely  is
needed more than ever.

This review aims to collate the best evidence about the efficacy and
acceptability of these interventions to facilitate decision-making by
those designing, delivering and receiving services.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

included  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs) 

We 
in  which
caregivers  were  randomly  assigned  to  remotely  delivered
psychoeducational  interventions  that  included  information  with
support or training, or to a control condition. The control condition
could be simple provision of information or waiting list, usual care
or a non-specific intervention serving as an attention control.

We excluded all non-randomised studies and also RCTs with a cross-
over design, due to the high risk of carryover effects.

Types of participants

Eligible trials included informal caregivers of people with dementia
receiving  care  at  home.  The  dementia  of  the  cared-for  person
could be of any type. We accepted clinical diagnoses or diagnoses
reached  using  formal  diagnostic  criteria  such  as  the  Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the International
Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD),  the  National  Institute  on  Aging  -
Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) or the Alzheimer's criteria of the
National  Institute  of  Neurological  and  Communicative  Disorders

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

and  the  Alzheimer's  Disease  and  Related  Disorders  Association
(NINCDS-ADRDA). Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives, or
members  of  the  person's  community;  18  years  of  age  or  older),
of  either  sex,  and  of  any  ethnic  or  geographical  origin.  Studies
that  included  caregivers  of  people  with  mixed  diagnoses  were
included only if data on caregivers of people with dementia could
be extracted separately.

Types of interventions

We  included  trials  that  assessed  remote  delivery  of  structured
interventions involving training, support, information provision, or
combinations of these elements, and that only targeted informal
caregivers.  We  considered  an  intervention  to  be  structured  if
there  was  a  clear  description  of  a  standard  set  of  components
and  how  they  were  implemented.  They  could  be  delivered  using
paper,  the  telephone,  the  Internet  or  a  mixture  of  these,  but  did
not  involve  any  face-to-face  contact  with  professionals  or  other
caregivers. These interventions had to be compared with a control
condition,  which  could  be  provision  of  information  alone  or  a
waiting  list,  usual  care  or  any  non-specific  intervention  serving
as  an  attention  control.  Participants  in  waiting  list  groups  were
offered  the  experimental  interventions  once  the  study  finished.
Participants in attention control groups received a similar amount
of contact with professionals to those in the experimental group,
but  the  content  of  the  contact  involved  no  specific  information,
training or support related to dementia.

The following interventions were excluded:

• interventions aimed at healthcare professionals;
• interventions aimed at the people with dementia;
• respite care interventions;
• interventions  for  caregivers  that  are  individually  tailored  and

whose components are not well defined; and

• interventions 

for 

caregivers 

that  are  predominantly
psychotherapy,  including  interventions  based  entirely  on  the
cognitive behavioural model (CBT). However, interventions that
included  elements  of  CBT  as  part  of  a  larger,  multimodal
intervention were eligible for inclusion.

We used the following criteria to identify information, support and
training.  Information  interventions  include  two  key  elements:  (i)
they provide standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver plays
a passive role. Support interventions promote caregiver interaction
with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions
are  structured  interventions  intended  to  train  caregivers  in
practical  skills  in  order  to  prevent  or  alleviate  the  negative
consequences of care giving.

We  used  the  following  operational  criteria  to  categorise  the
interventions:

• Professional support (e.g. having counselling from a health profes-

sional).

Training

Structured interventions intended to empower caregivers with
practical skills to manage the issues related to care.

The skills to be acquired may relate to the care of the person with de-
mentia, or to the management of the caregiver's psychological stress,
according to the following categories:

• Fulfilling basic care needs.
• Management of behavioural problems.
• Stress management and coping style.

The participant has an interac-
tive role talking, discussing or
sharing their feelings, problems
or contents related to the care
provided with other caregivers
or professionals.

Caregivers play an active role
(e.g. through supervised prac-
tice, role playing, etc.) in the in-
tervention provided.

We  compared  (1)  all  interventions  involving  training,  support  or
both, with or without information provision, with usual treatment,
waiting list or attention control and (2) all interventions involving
training,  support  or  both,  with  or  without  information  provision,
with  provision  of  information  alone.  We  used  the  Template  for
Intervention  Description  and  Replication  (TIDieR)  checklist  to
describe the interventions tested in each included trial, to obtain
a detailed account of the assessed interventions, and to improve
comparability among studies (Hoffmann 2014).

Types of outcome measures

We focused on outcomes that have been identified as relevant to
evaluate  effectiveness  of  psychosocial  interventions  in  dementia
care (Moniz-Cook 2008).

Primary outcomes

• Caregiver  burden,  measured  by  validated  questionnaires  such
as the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) or the Sense of Competence
Questionnaire (SCQ 27).

• Caregiver  mood  or  psychosocial  well-being,  measured  by
validated questionnaires such as the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies  Depression  Scale  (CES-D),  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and
Depression Scale (HADS), or the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ).

• Caregiver  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL),  measured  by
the EuroQoL Group's instrument (EUROQOL), the 36-Item Short
Form  Health  Survey  (SF-36)  or  the  World  Health  Organization
(WHO) Quality of Life assessment tool (WHOQOL).

• Acceptability  of  the  intervention:  we  used  dropouts  for  any
reason as a surrogate for the acceptability of interventions.

Secondary outcomes

• Caregiver knowledge and skills.
• Use of health or social resources.
• Admission of the person with dementia to institutional care.
• QoL  of  the  person  with  dementia,  measured  by  validated
questionnaires such as the specific Quality of life in Alzheimer's
disease  (QOL-AD)  instrument,  the  Dementia  Quality  of  Life
(DQOL) instrument, or the generic EQ-5D instrument.

1. Monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases:

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and LILACS;

2. Monthly  searches  of  a  number  of  trial  registers:  ISRCTN;
UMIN  (Japan's  Trial  Register);  the  World  Health  Organization
International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  (WHO  ICTRP)
portal  (which  covers  ClinicalTrials.gov;  ISRCTN;  the  Chinese

To view a list of all sources searched for ALOIS, see About ALOIS on
the ALOIS website (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois).

We  also  ran  additional  searches  in  MEDLINE,  Embase,  PsycINFO,
CINAHL,  and  CENTRAL.  We  searched  two  international  trials
registries,  ClinicalTrials.gov  at  the  US  National  Institutes  of
Health,  and  the  WHO  ICTRP,  to  ensure  that  the  search  was  as
comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible. We have presented
the search strategies used and the number of results retrieved in
Appendix 1.

The most recent search for this review was done on 10 April 2020.
Before that date, we had run searches in December 2015, July 2016,
May 2017, May 2018 and May 2019.

Searching other resources

We  complemented  this  search  with  manual  searches  of  the
bibliographies  of  relevant  review  papers  and  published  trials  to
locate additional relevant studies.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Pairs  of  review  authors  (two  of  EGF,  JRR,  JB)  independently
examined  the  titles  and  abstracts  of  citations  obtained  by  the
searches  to  identify  studies  that  may  meet  the  inclusion  criteria.
We  retrieved  the  full-texts  of  all  potentially  eligible  articles  and
examined these against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, again
independently and in duplicate. Studies excluded and reasons for
exclusion  are  reported  in  the  Characteristics  of  excluded  studies
table.

Data extraction and management

Pairs  of  review  authors  (two  of  EGF,  JRR,  BS,  JB)  independently
extracted data using a standardised data collection form. In case
of  disagreement,  another  review  author  (IS)  was  consulted  and
consensus  sought.  For  each  study,  extracted  data  included:  trial
registry  identification,  funding  and  potential  conflicts  of  interest,
main methodological characteristics, results. We described the key
characteristics  of  each  trial  in  tables,  paying  special  attention  to
the characteristics of the interventions assessed. We described the
interventions according to the TiDieR checklist (Hoffmann 2014).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We  assessed  the  risk  of  bias  in  included  studies  by  following
the  guidance  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews
of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011).  Pairs  of  review  authors  (two
of  EGF,  JRR,  JB)  extracted  the  appropriate  information  and
independently rated the risk of bias for each study and outcome.
In case of disagreement, another review author (IS) was consulted
and  consensus  sought.  We  assessed  the  following  sources  of
bias:  selection  bias  (including  random  sequence  generation
and  allocation  concealment);  performance  bias  (blinding  of
participants  and  personnel);  detection  bias  (blinding  of  outcome
assessments);  attrition  bias  (incomplete  outcome  data);  and
reporting bias (selective reporting).

Using 'Risk of bias' tables, we rated the risk of bias in each domain
as either "low risk," "unclear risk" or "high risk" and provided an
explanation for each rating. We considered trials with inadequate
randomisation  and  lack  of  blinding  (for  outcome  assessment)  as
being at overall "high risk of bias."

Measures of treatment effect

We  used  the  risk  ratio  (RR)  with  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)
as the measure of treatment effect for dichotomous data and the
mean difference (MD) with its 95% CI as the measure of treatment
effect  for  continuous  data.  We  used  the  SMD  with  its  95%  CI
for continuous outcomes only if similar outcome constructs were
measured by different rating scales.

Unit of analysis issues

The  unit  of  analysis  was  the  individual  allocated  to  a  treatment
group.  We  did  not  identify  any  eligible  cluster-randomised  trials.
If  a  trial  reported  outcomes  at  more  than  one  time  point  (e.g.
weekly  or  monthly  outcome  measures;  end-of-trial  and  follow-
up outcome measures), we extracted the measure closest in time
to  the  end  of  treatment  and  used  this  as  a  measure  of  the
acute  effect  of  the  intervention.  If  a  trial  included  more  than
one  control  or  experimental  group,  we  followed  the  guidance
of  the  updated  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of
Interventions  (  Higgins  2020).  When  managing  several  eligible
experimental  interventions  versus  a  unique  control,  we  split  the
control  sample  to  avoid  over-counting  participants.  Where  there
was  more  than  one  control  group,  we  combined  these  if  it  was
conceptually reasonable to do so.

Dealing with missing data

We  used  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  data  where  this  was  reported.  If
an  included  study  imputed  missing  data,  we  reported  the  data
imputation method.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  considered  heterogeneity  in  study  characteristics  to  decide  if
combining the results would be clinically meaningful. If we judged
the studies to be too heterogeneous, then we did not conduct meta-
analyses,  but  reported  individual  results.  We  assessed  between-
studies  heterogeneity  in  meta-analyses  using  the  I2  statistic,
complemented with the examination of overlapping 95% CI.

Assessment of reporting biases

We assessed small study bias using funnel plots where there were
10 or more studies in a comparison.

In  the  bibliographic  searches,  if  we  found  any  RCT  included  in
any  clinical  trial  register  that  we  considered  could  have  been
completed,  but  for  which  we  had  not  been  able  to  locate  any
results, we contacted the authors to request information about the
status of the trial, and the trial results, if it had been completed.

Data synthesis

If  we  considered  trials  to  be  sufficiently  similar  that  it  was
appropriate  to  pool  data,  we  conducted  meta-analyses  using  a
random-effects model for two main comparisons:

1. a comparison of all interventions involving information, training
or  support  versus  usual  treatment,  waiting  list  or  attention
control;

2. a comparison of all interventions involving training or support

(with or without information) versus information alone.

Where there were sufficient data, we stratified the analyses by type
of intervention.

We conducted all analyses in Review Manager version 5.3 (Review
Manager 2014).

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Depending  on  availability  of  data,  we  intended  to  conduct
subgroup analyses according to:

• the intensity/length of the intervention provided;
• the mode of delivery of the intervention: telephone-only versus

Internet with or without telephone;
• the characteristics of participants; and
• the outcome scales used to score each construct of interest.

Sensitivity analysis

If  feasible,  we  intended  to  perform  sensitivity  analyses  to  assess
the  influence  of  studies  at  higher  risk  of  bias,  and  the  impact  of
attrition  on  the  robustness  of  the  pooled  results.  However,  the
small number of included studies by group comparison precluded

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

reliable  sensitivity  analyses.  Another  form  of  sensitivity  analysis,
the leave-one-study method, did not identify any specific study as
highly influential on the combined results.

'Summary of findings' tables

We  summarised  the  review  findings  in  a  'Summary  of  findings'
table  using  the  online  GRADEpro  GDT  application  (GRADEpro
GDT).  In  the  table,  we  reported  the  estimated  treatment  effects
for  the  review's  primary  outcomes  and  for  resources  use
and  institutionalisation.  For  each  effect  estimate,  we  used  the
GRADE  approach  (Schünemann  2013)  to  rate  our  confidence
that  the  estimate  is  correct  (high,  moderate,  low  or  very  low
certainty).  GRADE  ratings  take  account  of  study  limitations,
imprecision  of  effect  estimates,  inconsistency  among  studies,
indirectness  of  evidence  and  publication  bias.  When  assessing
imprecision,  we  considered  that  an  absolute  value  of  SMD  0.50
probably represented an important between-group difference. We
considered inconsistency to be substantial enough to downgrade
our confidence in the effect estimate if we found I2 to be greater
than 60%.

Results of the search

After  a  first  assessment  by  the  CDCIG  information  specialist,  we
assessed  the  remaining  2,010  potentially  relevant  records.  Of
these,  264  records  remained  after  first  assessment  by  the  author
team,  and  after  more  detailed  screening  of  titles  and  abstracts,
we  retrieved  94  full-text  articles  for  assessment.  We  excluded  52
articles, recording the reasons for exclusion. We included 26 studies
(39  references)  in  the  qualitative  synthesis  and  25  studies  in  the
quantitative  synthesis.  Three  studies  are  awaiting  classification
because they may be eligible, but there is not enough information
in  their  registry  protocols  to  make  an  eligibility  decision  (see
Studies  awaiting  classification).  Another  13  studies  are  ongoing
studies  that  have  not  yet  reported  results  (see  Ongoing  studies).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Included studies

We identified 26 studies with 2367 participants for inclusion in the
review (see Characteristics of included studies).

Setting and participants

Included studies were conducted or published over 25 years (from
1995  to  2020).  Most  studies  were  from  the  US  (15  studies,  58%).
China and the Netherlands contributed three studies each, France
two studies, and Canada, Spain and the UK one study each. Studies
had  a  median  sample  size  of  67  participants  (interquartile  range
(IQR) 49 to 110) and a median duration of 16 weeks (IQR 12 to 24).
Only six studies (23%) provided data for a continuation follow-up
after the end of the intervention (median of 24 weeks).

Most caregivers were female (72%) with a median age of 63 years
(range 51 to 72 years) . Care recipients were mainly diagnosed with
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (83%), had a median age of 78
years (range 62 to 81 years) and had been treated for dementia for
a median of 38.5 months (range 30 to 53 months).

Interventions

We examined the descriptions of the experimental interventions in
the included studies to look for elements meeting our definitions
of information, training and support. Almost all of the experimental
interventions  specified  provision  of  information  to  caregivers  as
a  component  of  a  more  complex  intervention.  We  considered
this  element  was  not  present  in  only  three  studies:  Davis  2004
and  Dowling  2014,  which  we  considered  to  be  relatively  pure
training  interventions,  and  Winter  2007,  which  we  considered
to  be  a  relatively  pure  support  intervention.  However,  even  in
these  cases,  it  was  possible  that  some  provision  of  information
did  occur  during  the  course  of  delivery  of  the  other  elements.
Therefore,  we  constructed  three  subgroups  of  experimental
intervention based on the predominant components: training with
or without information, support with or without information, and
interventions  including  both  support  and  training  elements.  We
considered these groups to be exploratory, recognising that all the
interventions were complex in nature and that there is inevitably
some overlap among the categories.

We  classified  the  experimental  intervention  in  12  studies  as
training  or  training  with  information  (Au  2015;  Au  2019;  Blom
2015; Czaja 2013; Davis 2004; Dowling 2014; Gant 2007; Kajiyama
2013;  Martindale-Adams  2013;  Metcalfe  2019;  NCT00056316;
NCT03417219),  in  eight  studies  as  support  or  support  with
information (Brennan 1995; Hattink 2015; Hayden 2012; Kwok 2013;
Mahoney 2003; Nunez-Naveira 2016; Torkamani 2014; Winter 2007),

and  in  six  studies  as  involving  both  training  and  support  with
information  (Cristancho-Lacroix  2015;  Duggleby  2018;  Gustafson
2019; Huis in het Veld 2020; Tremont 2008; Tremont 2015). Fourteen
studies  delivered  the  remote  intervention  by  telephone  and  12
using the Internet.

Eight studies included usual treatment (Brennan 1995; Cristancho-
Lacroix 2015; Mahoney 2003; Nunez-Naveira 2016; Torkamani 2014;
Tremont 2008) or waiting list (Hattink 2015; Metcalfe 2019) as the
control  condition.  Four  studies  provided  some  form  of  attention
control  during  the  treatment  period,  with  or  without  socially
supportive  telephone  calls  (Davis  2004;  Dowling  2014;  Hayden
2012;  Tremont  2015).  Eight  studies  provided  specific  information
on  dementia  and  related  problems  (Blom  2015;  Duggleby  2018;
Gustafson  2019;  Kajiyama  2013;  Kwok  2013;  Martindale-Adams
2013;  NCT03417219;  Winter  2007)  in  the  control  condition.  Six
further studies provided both information and some form of control
attention (Au 2015; Au 2019; Czaja 2013; Gant 2007; Huis in het Veld
2020; NCT00056316).

The TIDieR checklist for included studies is reported in Additional
tables (Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6; Table 7;
Table  8;  Table  9;  Table  10;  Table  11;  Table  12;  Table  13;  Table  14;
Table 15; Table 16; Table 17; Table 18; Table 19; Table 20; Table 21;
Table 22; Table 23; Table 24; Table 25; Table 26 ).

Outcome measures

Caregiver  burden  and  caregiver  mood  were  the  most  frequently
reported outcomes across studies.

Caregiver  burden  was  reported  in  17  studies  using  four  different
scales: the Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI, versions of 22-item and 12-
item; 12 studies, 65%); the 24-item Revised Memory and Behavior
Checklist (RMBPC, four studies, 23%); the 10-item Burden Scale for
Family Caregivers (BSFC, one study) and another 6-item scale (one
study).

Caregiver  mood  was  reported  in  17  studies  using  five  different
scales:  the  Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies-Depression  (CES-D,
versions of 20-item and 10-item; 12 studies, 71%); the 21-item Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI, two studies, 12%); the 30-item Geriatric
Depression  Scale  (GDS),  the  8-item  Patient  Health  Questionnaire
(PHQ), and the SF-12 v2 Mental Component Summary (MCS) (one
study each). For 16 of these studies, the scale measures depressive
symptoms; therefore in the interests of accuracy, we describe the
outcome simply as depressive symptoms.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Caregiver  HRQoL  was  reported  in  four  studies  with  four  different
scales:  the  19-item  Perceived  Quality  of  Life  Scale  (PQoL),  the
EuroQol-5D  Visual  Analogue  Scale  (EQ-5D  VAS),  the  EuroQol-5D
5-level  (EQ-5D-5L),  and  the  36-item  Short-Form  Health  Survey
(SF-36).

Two studies (Duggleby 2018; Huis in het Veld 2020) reported results
for caregiver knowledge and skills as mean differences that could
not be pooled with the raw effects extracted from the rest of studies.
Both studies are included in their respective comparisons and the
results reported accordingly.

Caregiver knowledge and skills was reported in eight studies using
six  different  scales;  the  Revised  Scale  for  Caregiving  Self-Efficacy
(RSCSE with 15- and 19-item versions; three studies, 37%); the 10-
item  General  Self-Efficacy  Scale  (GSES),  the  30-item  Alzheimer's
Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS), the 32-item Trust in Own Abilities
(TOA), the 4-item Caregiver Competence Scale (CCS), and a Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) (one study each).

Care recipient QoL was not reported in any of the included studies.

Because  studies  used  so  many  different  measures  with  different
metrics to report conceptually similar outcomes, we used the SMD
for continuous outcomes as the measure of effect size.

Funding

All studies but one reported being funded by public grants. Funding
source was not stated for Kwok 2013.

Excluded studies

We  excluded  52  studies  with  reasons  (see  Characteristics  of
excluded studies).

Risk of bias in included studies

We performed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for each included trial.
Our  judgements  regarding  the  overall  risk  of  bias  in  individual
studies are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Allocation

All  included  studies  were  reported  to  be  randomised.  However,
many  studies  did  not  describe  the  randomisation  procedure  in
sufficient detail to assess risk of bias, and we considered the risk to
be unclear. We asked authors for additional information, which we
included, if available, in the 'Risk of bias' tables.

We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias for allocation
concealment because of insufficient information. We asked authors
for additional information, which we included, if available, in the
'Risk of bias' tables.

Blinding

Due to the characteristics of interventions included in this review,
blinding of participants and personnel was, in general, not feasible.
We rated all studies but Au 2019 and Blom 2015 as being at high
risk of bias. Both studies asserted that participants did not know
whether the intervention they received was the experimental or the
control,  and  the  data  were  all  collected  via  the  Internet  with  no
intermediary interviewer.

We  judged  most  studies  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias  for  blinding  of
outcome assessment because most outcomes were subjective and
assessed  with  participant  self-report  scales.  We  considered  five
studies to be at low risk of bias in this domain (Au 2015; Au 2019;
Blom 2015; Huis in het Veld 2020; Tremont 2015).

Incomplete outcome data

We  judged  most  studies  to  be  at  low  or  unclear  risk  of  bias  in
this  domain.  We  rated  the  risk  as  high  in  10  studies  because
they  did  not  provide  data  about  the  flow  of  participants  over
the  study  period  or  presented  high  attrition  rates  or  differential

attrition rates by intervention (Blom 2015; Czaja 2013; Davis 2004;
Duggleby  2018;  Gustafson  2019;  Kajiyama  2013;  Mahoney  2003;
NCT03417219; Nunez-Naveira 2016; Tremont 2008).

Selective reporting

About 50% of the studies did not report the availability of a protocol
or  clinical  trial  registry  entry.  We  asked  authors  for  additional
information,  which  we  included,  if  available,  in  the  'Risk  of  bias'
tables.  We  rated  most  studies  as  being  at  unclear  risk  of  bias  for
lacking information on prespecification of outcomes at the protocol
stage  and  whether  they  were  primary  or  secondary  outcomes.
We  judged  one  study  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias  for  reporting  only
statistically significant results (Davis 2004).

Other potential sources of bias

We judged two studies to be at high risk of bias (Au 2015; Winter
2007). The Au 2015 study broke randomisation by adding further
data  to  a  pilot  study  already  published;  the  Winter  2007  study
found,  after  randomisation,  a  relevant  imbalance  of  prognostic
factors at baseline.

1 Any intervention involving training, support or both (with or
without information) versus usual treatment, waiting list or
attention control

Primary outcomes

1.1 Caregiver burden

Based  on  moderate-certainty  evidence  from  nine  randomised
studies  including  597  participants,  we  found  that  remotely

delivered  interventions  involving  training,  support  or  both  (with
or  without  information)  probably  do  not  affect  caregiver  burden
(SMD  -0.06,  95%  CI  -0.35  to  0.23;  I2  =  60%).  Negative  values
indicate  less  burden  in  the  experimental  intervention  group.  The
range  of  SMD  values  includes  no  effect  and  small  effects  in
favour of either experimental intervention or control. There is no
evidence of important differences in effect estimates among types
of interventions (Analysis 1.1; Figure 4).

Based  on  moderate-certainty  evidence  from  eight  randomised

evidence of important differences in effect estimates among types
of interventions (Analysis 1.2; Figure 5).

suggests that the experimental interventions may not affect the

suggests that the experimental interventions may not affect the
risk of dropping out for any reason (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.04)
(Figure 7, middle panel). The risk of dropout in the experimental

Secondary outcomes

1.5 Caregiver knowledge and skills

Based  on  low-certainty  evidence  from  four  randomised  studies
including 223 participants (Cristancho-Lacroix 2015; Hattink 2015;
Metcalfe  2019;  Nunez-Naveira  2016),  the  evidence  suggests  that
remotely  delivered  interventions  involving  training,  support  or
both (with or without information) may make little or no difference
to caregiver knowledge and skills (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.50;
I2  =  21%).  Positive  values  favour  the  experimental  intervention
group.  The  range  of  SMD  values  includes  no  effect,  a  moderate
effect in favour of the experimental interventions and a negligible
effect in favour of the control interventions. There is no evidence
of  important  differences  in  effect  estimates  among  types  of
intervention (Analysis 1.5).

or  no  difference  in  caregiver  knowledge  and  skills  (SMD  0.18,
95% CI -0.18 to 0.54). The range of SMD values includes no effect,
a  moderate  effect  in  favour  of  the  experimental  interventions
and a small effect in favour of the control interventions.

• Training/information  or  training  interventions  versus  control
interventions:  based  on  low-certainty  evidence  from  one
randomised  study  including  54  participants,  the  evidence
suggests that the experimental intervention may make little or
no difference to caregiver knowledge and skills (SMD -0.12, 95%
CI -0.65 to 0.42). The range of SMD values includes no effect and
moderate effects in favour of either the experimental or control
intervention.

• Interventions  including  both  training  and  support  elements
versus  control  interventions:  based  on  low-certainty  evidence
from  one  randomised  study  including  49  participants,  the
evidence suggests that the experimental intervention may result
in an increase in caregiver knowledge and skills (SMD 0.61, 95%
CI 0.04 to 1.18). The SMD values range from a negligible to a large
effect in favour of the experimental intervention.

1.6 Use of health and social resources

Based on moderate-certainty evidence from one randomised study
including  250  participants  (Tremont  2015),  a  remotely  delivered
intervention  involving  training,  support  or  both  (with  or  without
information)  probably  results  in  little  or  no  difference  in  use  of
health and social resources (Rate Ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19)
(Analysis 1.6).

1.7 Admission to institutional care (nursing home placement)

Due  to  very  low-certainty  evidence  from  one  randomised  study
including  34  participants  (Hayden  2012),  the  evidence  is  very
uncertain  about  the  effect  of  a  remotely  delivered  interventions
involving training, support or both (with or without information) on
institutional care (nursing home) placement (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.11
to 3.11) (Analysis 1.7).

1.8 Care recipient QoL

We found no studies that examined the QoL of the cared-for person
with dementia.

2 Any intervention involving training, support or both (with or
without information) versus information alone

Primary outcomes

2.1 Caregiver burden

Based  on  low-certainty  evidence  from  nine  studies  including  650
participants,  remotely  delivered  interventions  involving  training,
support or both (with or without information) may result in a slight
reduction in caregiver burden (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04; I2
= 62%) compared to a control condition of information provision
alone. Negative values indicate lower burden in the experimental
intervention group. The SMD values range from a moderate effect
in favour of the experimental interventions to a negligible effect in
favour of the control interventions (information provision). There
is no evidence of important differences in effect estimates among
types of interventions (Analysis 2.1; Figure 8).

2.4 Dropouts for any reason

Based on moderate-certainty evidence from 12 randomised studies
including  1266  participants,  remotely  delivered  interventions
involving  training,  support  or  both  (with  or  without  information)
probably  result  in  an  increase  in  dropouts  for  any  reason  (RR
1.51,  95%  CI  1.04  to  2.20;  I2  =  37%).  The  risk  of  dropout  from

the  experimental  interventions  was  196  per  1000  (95%  CI  135  to
286) versus 130 per 1000 for the control interventions (information
alone). There is no evidence of important differences in risk among
types  of  interventions  (Analysis  2.4;  Figure  11).  We  detected  no
small study effects, which can indicate publication bias (analyses
not shown).

2.5 Caregiver knowledge and skills

Based  on  low-certainty  evidence  from  two  randomised  studies
including  70  participants,  the  evidence  was  inconclusive  about
any  effect  of  remotely  delivered  interventions  involving  training,
support  or  both  (with  or  without  information)  on  caregiver
knowledge  and  skills  compared  to  a  control  condition  of
information alone (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.65; I2 = 0%). Positive
values indicate better caregiver knowledge and skills score in the
experimental intervention group. The range of SMD values include
no effect, a large effect in favour of the experimental interventions

and  a  moderate  effect  in  favour  of  the  control  interventions
(Analysis 2.5).

Interventions involving training, support or both (with or
without information) versus information alone

Another  two  studies  (Duggleby  2018;  Huis  in  het  Veld  2020),
whose  results  we  were  unable  to  include  in  the  meta-analysis,
also  reported  data  on  this  outcome.  Evidence  from  Duggleby
2018  including  199  participants  suggests  that  the  experimental
intervention  has  little  or  no  effect  on  caregiver  knowledge  and
skills  assessed  with  the  10-item  GSES  (MD  0.22,  95%  CI  -0.78  to
1.22). Evidence from Huis in het Veld 2020 including 54 participants
also suggests little or no effect of the experimental intervention on
caregiver knowledge and skills assessed with the 32-item TOA (MD
-2.16, 95% CI -6.86 to 2.53).

2.6 Use of health/social resources

We did not find any studies that examined the use of health and
social resources.

2.7 Admission to institutional care (nursing home placement)

Based on very low-certainty evidence from one randomised study
including 32 participants (Gant 2007), the evidence is very uncertain
about the effect of the experimental intervention on admission to
institutional care (nursing home placement) (RR 2.67, 95% CI 0.12
to 60.93) (Analysis 2.6).

We did not find any studies that examined the QoL of the cared-for
person with dementia.

Summary of main results

Our review included 26 studies with a total of 2367 participants. We
conducted two comparisons:

• Interventions  involving  training,  support  or  both  (with  or
without  information)  versus  usual  treatment,  waiting  list  or
attention control;

• Interventions  involving  training,  support  or  both  (with  or

without information) versus information alone.

Interventions involving training, support or both (with or
without information) versus usual treatment, waiting list or
attention control

Primary outcomes

In this comparison, we found that the experimental interventions
probably  make  little  or  no  difference  to  caregiver  burden  (nine
studies,  597  participants),  caregiver  depressive  symptoms  (eight
studies,  638  participants)  or  caregiver  HRQoL  (two  studies,  311
participants), and probably have little or no effect on dropouts for
any reason (eight studies, 661 participants).

Secondary outcomes

We  found  that  the  experimental  interventions  may  have  little  or
no  effect  on  caregiver  knowledge  and  skills  (four  studies,  223
participants), or on use of health and social resources (one study,
250  participants).  We  found  that  the  evidence  is  very  uncertain
about their effect on admission to institutional care (nursing home
placement). We did not find studies that examined the QoL of the
care recipient.

Primary outcomes

In this comparison, we found that interventions including training
or  support  compared  to  information  alone  may  result  in  a  slight
reduction  in  caregiver  burden  (nine  studies,  650  participants),
probably  result  in  a  slight  reduction  in  caregiver  depressive
symptoms  (11  studies,  1100  participants),  may  make  little  or  no
difference to caregiver HRQoL (two studies, 257 participants), and
probably result in a large increase in dropouts for any reason (12
studies, 1266 participants).

Secondary outcomes

We  found 
ino  evidence  of  an  effect  of  the  experimental
interventions on caregiver knowledge and skills and very uncertain
evidence  about  the  effect  on  institutional  care  (nursing  home
placement) (one study, 32 participants). We did not find studies that
examined the use of health and social resources or the QoL of the
cared-for person with dementia.

We  believe  that  we  are 
studies  that  address  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  remotely
delivered psychoeducational interventions for caregivers of people
with  dementia.  Our  search  for  evidence  was  extensive,  using
the  Specialised  Register  of  the  CDCIG,  as  well  as  running
complementary  searches  in  appropriate  electronic  databases,
clinical  trials  registries,  and  hand-searching  references  from
included studies.

The average characteristics of caregivers (mostly females over 60
years of age) and care recipients (83% Alzheimer's diagnosis) are
representative  of  the  patient-caregiver  dyads  that  usually  access
community health and social care facilities.

There  was  significant  diversity  in  the  outcomes  measured  in  the
included  trials.  Of  our  primary  outcomes,  caregiver  burden  and
caregiver  mood  were  most  frequently  assessed,  but  assessment
of mood in most studies relied on scales of depressive symptoms.
Few  studies  used  validated  measures  of  caregiver  anxiety,  which
would also be of interest. Caregivers' HRQoL was assessed in only
four  trials.  We  did  not  find  explicit  reporting  of  adverse  effects
of  the  interventions  and  the  additional  burden  they  might  add
to the caregiver's life. Although acceptability is a complex, multi-
dimensional construct, it is difficult to measure and we were only
able to approximate it using measures of overall dropout from the
studies as a surrogate.

Ten  studies  reported, 
if  not  acceptability,  quality  control
indicators  associated  with  uptake  of  the  interventions,  fidelity
of  implementation  or  user  satisfaction  with  the  programs.  As
described  below,  these  indicators  and  assessment  areas  varied
very widely across studies and so we did not attempt to combine
them.  Au  2019  assessed  program  fidelity  using  an  unblinding
rating  system  after  the  end  of  each  session.  Brennan  1995
assessed  service  use  by  counting  service  contacts.  Cristancho-
Lacroix  2015  assessed  the  percentage  of  participants  finishing
the protocol. Davis 2004 assessed treatment implementation with
audiotaped  sessions  and  weekly  caregiving  logs,  among  other
treatment  delivery  and  receipt  checks.  Duggleby  2018  assessed

ease  of  use,  computer  self-efficacy  and  behavioural  intentions.
Nunez-Naveira  2016  assessed  the  feasibility  of  the  intervention
with three self-completed questionnaires developed for the study.
Torkamani  2014  assessed  the  web  platform  with  satisfaction
questionnaires.  Tremont  2015  assessed  the  intervention  with  a
treatment satisfaction questionnaire.

There  are  two  issues  that  may  compromise  the  applicability  of
results  from  this  review:  its  reliance  mostly  on  populations  from
high-income  countries  with  distinct  health  and  social  services  at
community level, and the limitation of the available evidence to the
acute effects of interventions, assessed at a median of 16 weeks.
Little  evidence  comes  from  studies  conducted  in  non-Western
countries (only three studies conducted in China), and most studies
were  conducted  in  the  United  States  (15  of  26)  which,  unlike
European countries (eight studies), lacks a universal public health
system. We also lack sufficient information to determine whether
results apply over longer follow-up periods, or if effects could be
delayed in time, as the developed skills and coping strategies might
help caregivers as the dementia progresses. In fact, very few studies
(six  of  26)  presented  data  to  assess  effects  over  time  after  the
end of the experimental interventions (median follow-up time 24
weeks).  These  studies  describe  per  protocol  results  (completers
only) rather than intention-to-treat results. These missing data limit
the applicability of our review.

Quality of the evidence

We  used  GRADE  methods  to  rate  the  overall  certainty  of  the
evidence for each outcome. All results were downgraded for study
limitations.  The  most  widespread  risk  of  bias  was  the  risk  of
performance  bias  due  to  self-rating  of  subjective  outcomes  by
participants who were not blind to the treatment. Randomisation
methods were not always reported in sufficient detail to allow risk
of bias to be assessed. In some studies, there was a risk of attrition
bias. We also downgraded some results for inconsistency between
studies.

For  the  comparison  of  any  intervention  versus  usual  treatment,
waiting list or attention, we consider the certainty of evidence to
be  low  to  moderate.  Evidence  certainty  is  low  for  dropouts  for
any  cause,  and  moderate  for  caregiver  burden,  caregiver  mood
(depressive symptoms), and caregiver HRQoL (Summary of findings
1).

For the comparison of any intervention versus control information,
we  consider  the  certainty  of  evidence  to  be  low  to  moderate.
Evidence certainty is low for caregiver burden and caregiver HRQoL,
and  moderate  for  caregiver  mood  (depressive  symptoms)  and
dropouts for any cause (Summary of findings 2).

Potential biases in the review process

We  conducted  this  systematic  review 
in  accordance  with
Cochrane's  current  standards.  However,  the  following  potential
limitations in the review process deserve mention:

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• The  complexity  and  heterogeneity  of  the  interventions  in
our  review,  and  their  incompletely  documented  methodology
and  results,  present  notable  disadvantages  when  trying
to  summarise  the  evidence  of  complex  interventions  on
caregiver  well-being  (Belle  2003;  Gaugler  2017).  We  have
used  the  TIDieR  template  (Hoffmann  2014)  to  describe
interventions,  and  following  consultation  with  the  Cochrane
Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, we have classified
experimental interventions into three groups for the purposes
of  subgroup  analyses  (support  alone  or  with  information,
training alone or with information, and interventions including
both  support  and  training).  This  was  because  all  but  three
studies  that  provided  support  or  training  also 
included
provision  of  information.  Further,  we  have  classified  control
interventions  in  two  categories  (one  grouping  together  usual
treatment,  waiting  list  and  attention  control,  and  the  other
including information provision only). Pooled analyses for each
comparison  grouped  together  all  experimental  interventions
in  an  overall  category  labelled  'any  treatment'.  This    inclusive
category  does  not  present  misclassification  bias.  However,
subgroup  analyses  by  type  of  experimental  intervention  may
present  misclassification  issues,  which  usually  tend  to  bias
effects to the null hypothesis of no difference.

• This review has examined efficacy at a median time of 16 weeks.
There is no information on longer effects of the interventions.
Only six studies reported any data for longer follow-up (median
of  24  weeks).  However,  these  studies  form  a  selected  subset
of  all  included  studies  and  present  data  for  completers  only,
which  may  introduce  additional  bias  because  of  attrition  and
missing information. Therefore, we have not conducted a follow-
up analysis.

• We  contacted  study  authors  of  the  included  trials  where  the
publicly  available  information  for  methodological  aspects  of
the  studies  and/or  reported  results  was  unclear  or  missing.
We  received  responses  from  some  authors  (acknowledged  in
Characteristics  of  included  studies),  but  many  others  were
impossible  to  locate  or  did  not  respond  to  our  information
requests.

An  unexpected  finding  of  this  review  is  that,  contrary  to  what
might have been anticipated, psychoeducational interventions for
caregivers  seem  to  show  slightly  more  efficacy  on  decreasing
burden  and  improving  mood  of  caregivers,when  compared  with
a  control  intervention  that  involved  the  simple  provision  of
structured  information  about  dementia,  than  when  compared
with  usual  treatment,  being  on  a  waiting  list,  or  having  non-
specific attention. It is possible that the differential dropout rates
we  have  found  in  the  comparison  of  experimental  interventions
with information alone might contribute to this unforeseen result.
Since  most  studies  reported  outcomes  for  completers  only  and
experimental  interventions  were  associated  with  a  higher  risk
of  dropout,  especially  in  the  studies  using  an  information-only
control,  it  is  conceivable  that  attrition  bias  might  have  inflated
effect sizes in favour of interventions in this comparison.

Since  most  studies  have  been  run  in  high  income  countries  with
developed  health  and  social  care  systems,  it  is  also  possible
that  usual  treatment  control  groups  had  access  at  least  to  basic
information and support as part of standard care services or from
other community sources (charities, self-help groups). If this were
the case, usual treatment might represent a level of care that could
be  efficacious  enough  to  narrow  the  differences  with  any  other

intervention. In support of this argument, it is worth noting that in
the first comparison, most studies included usual treatment (n = 6)
or  attention  controls  (n  =  4),  and  only  two  studies  (Hattink  2015;
Metcalfe 2019) included a waiting list control group.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

Other  recent  reviews  have  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of
interventions  including  information  and  support  or  training,  is
relatively  small  with  absolute  average  effects  of  about  SMD
0.20  on  caregivers'  burden  (  Abrahams  2018;  Williams  2019a),
caregivers'  mood-depression  (Abrahams  2018),  and  caregivers'
QoL  (Abrahams  2018).  These  effect  sizes  are  slightly  higher  than
those  previously  reported  for  remotely  delivered  interventions
(Internet-based or telephone-based), but well within the range of
variability  for  effect  sizes.  Reviews  addressing  caregiver  burden
in  dementia  (Deeken  2019)  and  dementia  among  several  other
chronic  conditions  (stroke  survivors,  non-small  cell  lung  cancer
and  brain  injury)  (Ploeg  2018),  and  reviewing  technology-based
and  Web-based  interventions  respectively,  report  effect  sizes  of
SMD -0.13 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.02) in favour of any intervention and
SMD  0.03  in  favour  of  control  (95%  CI  -0.31  to  0.36).  Our  values
overlap  with  those  results:  SMD  -0.06  (95%  CI  -0.35  to  0.23)  for
comparison versus usual treatment, waiting list or attention control
and SMD -0.24 (95% CI -0.51 to 0.04) for comparison versus control
information. For caregiver mood (mainly assessed with depression
questionnaires), Deeken 2019 (in dementia caregivers) and Sherifali
2018  (in  other  chronic  condition  caregivers)  report  effect  sizes  of
SMD  -0.20  (95%  CI  -0.31  to  -0.10)  and  SMD  -0.19  (95%  CI  -0.43  to
0.05) in favour of any intervention, and our values also agree with
those results: SMD -0.05 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.12) for comparison versus
usual  treatment,  waiting  list  or  attention  control  and  SMD  -0.25
(95% CI -0.43 to -0.06) for comparison versus control information.
For  caregiver  QoL  in  chronic  conditions  (mostly  dementia  but
also  stroke,  lung  cancer  and  brain  injury),  Sherifali  2018  reports
a  negligible  effect  size  of  SMD  0.01  in  favour  of  any  intervention
but  with  a  very  wide  confidence  interval  that  covers  a  moderate
effect in both directions, in favour and against intervention (95% CI
-0.49 to 0.51). Our results are also compatible: SMD 0.10 in favour of
any intervention (95% CI -0.13 to 0.32) for comparison versus usual
treatment, waiting list or attention control and SMD -0.03 (95% CI
-0.28 to 0.21) for comparison versus control information. We have
not found effect sizes from other reviews dealing with the outcome
of dropouts for any reason.

Two  qualitative  reviews  (Egan  2018;  Hopwood  2018)  indicate
positive  responses  to  the  use  of  Internet-based  interventions
by  caregivers,  and  that  they  might  be  efficacious  to  improve
mental  health  and  reduce  caregiver  burden.  However,  they  also
highlight problems with determining the effectiveness of Internet
interventions: the marked methodological diversity across studies
(Egan 2018), and the need for high-quality studies to increase the
quality of evidence (Hopwood 2018).

An earlier Cochrane Review that partially overlaps with ours (Lins
2014)  found  that  telephone  counselling  for  informal  carers  of
people  with  dementia  was  efficacious  for  decreasing  depressive
symptoms (SMD -0.32; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.01) and caregiver burden
(SMD  -0.45;  95%  CI  -0.90  to  0.01).  These  results  are  the  most
favourable  we  have  seen  reported  for  any  remotely  delivered
intervention. The review is restricted to a comparison of telephone
counselling  with  no  treatment,  usual  care,  or  friendly  calls  for

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

chatting. It is worth noting that all but one of the studies included
in that review are also included in ours. For depressive symptoms,
Tremont  2008  and  Winter  2007  overlap  with  ours,  as  well  as
Davis 2004, Tremont 2008, and Winter 2007 for caregiver burden.
However, we did not include another study that Lins 2014 included
for both outcomes (Finkel 2007). Hence, the reviews are not entirely
comparable.

In summary, given the large variability of effect sizes reported by
other  reviews,  our  results  seem  consistent  with  those  previously
published for caregiver burden, mood and QoL. We cannot compare
our  results  for  acceptability  of  interventions  (dropouts  for  any
cause) with other reviews, which did not study this outcome.

Implications for practice

Remotely delivered, complex interventions involving information,
support or training for informal caregivers of people with dementia
may  slightly  reduce  caregiver  burden  and  depressive  symptoms
when  compared  with  provision  of  information  alone,  but  not
when  compared  with  usual  treatment,  waiting  list  or  attention
control.  In  settings  where  social  and  health  resources  are  well
developed  and  available  to  caregivers  of  people  with  dementia,
these  interventions  may  not  add  significantly  to  usual  care.  We
cannot comment on the efficacy of these interventions in settings
with less-developed health and social care systems or in situations
when usual care services cannot be accessed.

Implications for research

Overall,  remotely  delivered  interventions  involving  training  or
support  seem  to  be  less  acceptable  than  control  interventions,
as  assessed  by  the  number  of  participants  dropping  out.  This
might limit their applicability in community settings. It is therefore
important  to  investigate  causes  for  dropouts,  including  any
difficulties related to the delivery of the interventions, such as the
use  of  online  platforms,  or  the  nature  of  learning  materials.  It  is
also  important  to  investigate  adverse  effects  as  possible  causes
for  dropouts,  including  the  additional  burden  they  might  add
to  a  caregiver's  life.  Our  results  for  important  outcomes  such  as
caregiver quality of life and improvement in caregiver knowledge
and  skills  were  very  imprecise,  at  least  in  part  because  few
studies  measured  them.  These  outcomes  should  be  included  in
future studies, without neglecting core outcomes such as caregiver
burden  and  mood,  including  both  depression  and  anxiety.  Mixed
methods  study  designs,  incorporating  qualitative  elements,  may
be  particularly  useful  for  these  complex  and  heterogeneous
interventions in order to aid interpretation of quantitative data on
efficacy and acceptability or dropout. Given the rapid increase in
the  numbers  of  people  with  dementia  in  low-income  countries,
research  into  interventions  to  improve  the  situation  of  family
caregivers in these settings would be very valuable.

Study characteristics

Methods

Design: Multicentre, parallel randomised study.

No. of participating centres: Two centres (United Christian Hospital; Prince of Whales Hospital; Hong
Kong, China)

Study dates: Not reported.

Participants

Inclusion criteria: Informal caregivers aged 25 or older, caring for a familiar diagnosed of Alzheimer's
disease for at least 3 months.

Exclusion criteria: Participants who showed signs of severe intellectual deficits, demonstrated suici-
dal ideation, exhibited evidence of psychotic disorders, or could not read or speak fluent Chinese/Can-
tonese.

No. of participants randomised to interventions:

- PsyED with BA (n = 51).

- PsyED only (n = 45).

Baseline characteristics:

- Caregivers: Mean age for participants was 56.2 years (SD = 10.6). Most caregivers were females (76 of
93, 82%), spouses or children of AD patients (85 participants of 93, 91%). The mean time for caring was
10.4 hours/day (SD = 8.9). The mean CES-D score was 13.5 (SD = 8.0).

- Care recipients: Mean age was 80.9 years (SD = 6.6). There were 60 females of 93 (64.5%) and 33 males
of 93 (35.5%). Mean MMSE was 15.7 (SD = 5.6).

Experimental: Psychoeducation with telephone-assisted behavioral activation (PsyED-BA). All partic-
ipants received a psychoeducation program via telephone for 4 weeks. Then, the experimental group
received eight biweekly telephone follow-up calls of BA practice focused on pleasant event scheduling
and improving communications.

Control: Psychoeducation only (PsyED). All participants received a psychoeducation program via tele-
phone for 4 weeks. Then, the control group received eight biweekly telephone follow-up calls of gener-
al discussion of psychoeducation and related information.

Length of intervention: 4 months.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Interventions

Caregivers: Mean age for participants was 61.6 years (SD = 11.6). Most caregivers were females (32 of 49,
65%), spouses or daughters/sons of AD patients (47 participants of 49, 96%). The mean self-perceived
stress (PSS-14) was 24.3 (SD = 7.9).

Care recipients: The mean time since onset of symptoms was 4.4 years (SD = 3.3). The mean MMSE
score was 18.7 (SD = 5.0).

Experimental: Usual care plus the Diapason program. Twelve thematic sessions were sequentially and
weekly unblocked once the previous one was entirely viewed. Each session included theoretical and
practical information, videos of health professionals, and a practice guide for applying the session’s
content in real life. Participants could access different website sections (i.e., relaxation training, forum)
for as long as they wished at any time. Intervention targeted (1) caregivers’ beliefs about illness and the
caregiving role, (2) caregivers’ skills to manage daily life difficulties, and (3) caregivers’ social support
and help-seeking behavior to obtain respite or financial support, and to meet and discuss with peers
through a forum.

Control: Usual care. Information about the illness during their semiannual follow-up with their geriatri-
cian. The control group participants were given access to the Diapason program at the end of the study.

Lenght of intervention: 3 months.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes:

- Perceived stress of caregivers, measured by the item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), (score range 0 to
56, higher scores indicate higher stress levels).

Secondary outcomes:

- Self-efficacy, measured by the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy (RSCS), (3 self-efficacy do-
mains with a score range from 0 to 100 each one, higher scores indicate a higher degree of confidence
for each situation: obtaining respite, responding to disruptive behaviour, and controlling upsetting
thoughts).
- Perception and reaction to cognitive or behavioral symptoms, evaluated with the Revised Memo-
ry and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC), (score range 0 to 96, higher scores indicate greater per-
ceived burden).
- Subjective burden, evaluated with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), (score range 0 to 88, higher scores
denote greater burden).
- Depressive symptoms, measured with a version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), (range score
0 to 63, higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms).
- Self-perceived health, measured with the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), (range score 0 to 100, low-
er scores indicate less QoL).

Outcomes assessment: At 3 months (final assessment), and 6 months (follow-up assessment).

Notes

ing activities for less than an average of 8 hours/week.

No. of participants randomised to interventions:

- iCare protocol (ICC) (n = 75).

- Education/Information-Only Condition (EOC) (n = 75).

Baseline characteristics:

Caregivers: Mean age for participants was 56.1 years (SD = 11.4). Most were female (83%) , spouse, part-

ing similar navigational features, but with content focused on information about dementia. In addition,
links to video-taped information were provided. Written materials from various health agencies were
also provided in a booklet format. Thus, extensive information using ‘state-of-the-art’ media strategies
was made available to these participants, but without a format designed to enhance the development
of specific skills to deal with stress from caregiving.

Lenght of intervention: 3 months.

Primary outcomes:

- Caregiver stress, assessed by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (range scores 0 to 40, higher
scores denote more perceived stress.

Secondary outcomes:

- Caregiver level of bother due to disruptive behaviours, assessed by the Revised Memory and Behavior
Problems Checklist (RMBPC) (range scores 0 to 96, higher scores denote more perceived stress).

- Caregiver level of depression, assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) (range scores 0 to 30, higher scores denote more depressive symptoms).

Baseline characteristics:

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Caregivers: Most caregivers were female (71%), and spouse or child of patients (89%), 60% of caregivers
presented an age between 31 and 50 years.

Care recipients: Most patients were female (74%).

Interventions

Experimental: A 12-session psychoeducation program delivered by registered social workers over the
telephone (approximately 30 minutes per session, one session per week).

Control: DVD with educational information about dementia caregiving.

Lenght of intervention: 12 weeks.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes:

- Caregiver burden, measured by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), (score range 0 to 88, higher scores in-
dicate greater burden).

- Caregiver self-efficacy, measured by the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-efficacy, (continuous scale
from 0% to 100%, higher scores indicated greater sense of self-efficacy).

Secondary outcomes:

- Care recipients stage of dementia, indexed by the Global Deterioration Scale, (7 stages from 1 = no
cognitive decline, to 7 = severe dementia).

- Care recipients cognitive functioning, assessed by the Abbreviated Mental Test.

- Behavioral problems of care recipients, measured by the participants using the Cohen–Mansfeld Agi-
tation Inventory (scores range 29 to 203, higher scores indicate greater agitated behaviours).

Interventions

Experimental: ALADDIN, a computerised information platform to offer support and information to the
carer, and to manage distant monitoring with caregivers and clinicians.

Control: Assessment at 3 time points without any further contact or intervention.

Lenght of intervention: 6 months.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes:

- Caregiver burden, assessed by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), (score range 0 to 88; higher scores de-
note greater burden).

- Caregiver depression, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; score range 0 to 63, higher
scores denote more depressive symptoms) and the Zung Depression Self Rating Scale (ZDSR, score
range 20 to 80, higher scores represent more severe depression).

- Caregiver quality of life, assessed by the EuroQoL (EQ5D, summary index value of 0-1, lower scores
represent poorer QoL), and the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS, score range 16 to 112, higher scores indicate
better QoL).

BRIEF NAME

Psychoeducation with behavioral activation (PsyED-BA).

Psychoeducation only (PsyED).

WHY

Based on the Gallagher-Thompson’s program Coping with Cargiv-
ing. The aim is to enhance the use of coping skills via behavioral
activation (BA), since it would be more acceptable and helpful
than change dysfunctional thoughts, overcome barriers to treat-
ment access and train paraprofessionals to deliver some modules
of the program.

General discussion about the psy-
choeducation program and infor-
mation packet.

cerning local organizations, com-
munity resources, and social and
mental issues related to dementia.

Participants were contacted by tele-
phone within the same week of the
baseline assessment to start the
psychoeducation program. There
were a total of four weekly interven-
tion telephone calls, each lasting
about 30 minutes.

Participants had eight biweekly
telephone sessions over the follow-
ing 4 months. Each session consist-
ed of a telephone call lasting 15 to
20 minutes:

- Participants were asked to go
through the materials of the psy-
choeducation program and the in-
formation package. For each of the
telephone session, the participants
were asked to select their own top-
ics for general discussion. If the
caregiver selected pleasant event
scheduling or communications,
general discussion would be carried
out without any BA procedures.

Finally, social work services were
available upon requests in outpa-
tient departments in which the care
recipients received their regular fol-
low-up.

Participants were contacted by telephone within the same week
of the baseline assessment to start the psychoeducation program.
There were a total of four weekly intervention telephone calls,
each lasting about 30 minutes.

- In the first week, all participants were taught about the symp-
toms and associated behavioral changes of dementia and the pos-
sible effects on the caregivers. Participants were also invited to
share their caregiving experiences.

- In the second week, participants learned about the physical, so-
cial, and psychological consequences of stress and being aware of
their own stress. They were invited to talk about their own stress.

- In the third week, they learned about the principles of identifying
and scheduling pleasant events for themselves.

- In the fourth week, participants learned about communication:
communicating their own needs to seek support from their fam-
ily members. They also learned about the characteristics of vari-
ous different types of communications: passive, aggressive, and
assertive.

Participants had eight biweekly telephone sessions over the fol-
lowing 4 months. Each session consisted of a telephone call last-
ing 15 to 20 minutes.

The first four sessions focused on pleasant event scheduling and
the other four sessions on effective communication. The tasks in-
volved in each of the four sessions were as follows:

1. Activity monitoring: how is the participant spending time/ com-
municating now?

2. Activity scheduling: schedule pleasant event/effective commu-
nications

3. Reinforcing or modifying the pleasant event and communica-
tion based on feedback or self-evaluation

4. Activity rescheduling/revision based on changes after modifica-
tion.

Finally, social work services were available upon requests in out-
patient departments in which the care recipients received their
regular follow-up.

BRIEF NAME

Psychoeducation with behavioral activation (TBA).

General Monitoring (TMG).

WHY

Behavioral activation (BA) focuses on constructing reinforce-
ment contingencies that increase functional behavior and
self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to the person’s beliefs about
the abilities to exercise control on the events affecting their
lives. The intervention was adapted from the Chinese Ver-
sion of the Coping with Caregiving.

General discussion about the psychoedu-
cation program and information packet.

WHAT materials

Written information, including the forms for pleasant event
scheduling, was mailed to participants before the program
started.

Information packet.

PROCEDURES

Four weekly sessions of psychoeducation and eight sessions
of behavioral activation.

Themes of the psychoeducation component were as follows.

Session 1 (week 1):

· Symptoms and associated behavioral changes in dementia

· Stages in dementia

· Caregiving roles and demands

· Effects on caregivers

Session 2 (week 2):

· Physical, social and psychological consequence of stress

All TGM participants received four week-
ly psycho-education sessions over the
phone with the same contents as in the
TBA group.

These caregivers were then assigned to
eight bi-weekly sessions of general mon-
itoring with no BA intervention. Each of
these sessions started with checking in
with the caregiver through inviting them
to update their caregiving situation. Care-
givers were then guided to discuss one
of the following topics at each session in
this order:

1. caregiver’s health

2. care-recipient’s needs

3. caregiver’s routines

4. social support.

As there were a total of eight sessions,
the last four sessions repeated the order
of the first four. While some caregivers
might report on attempts they made
on their own initiative to improve their
scheduling and communication, no spe-
cific attempt was made to ask them to re-
view these attempts.

HOW WELL planned

The program fidelity was assessed by a rating system built into recording form. At the end of each session,
all interventionists, including the paraprofessionals, were asked to rate to what extent they were able to
follow the protocol for each of the four PE sessions (3 = fully; 2 = adequately with at least 60% of the mate-
rial covered; 1 = slightly; 0 = not at all). A similar procedure was adopted for each of the 8 sessions for both
TBA and TGM. In addition, 10 cases from TBA and 10 cases from TGM were audiotaped. Interventionists’
adherence to the intervention protocol was assessed by two graduate students who had received eight
hours of training on the coding scheme. The sessions were coded with reference to four core TBA strate-
gies (activity planning, review to improve on scheduling, develop new help-seeking communication skills
and review to improve on communications) and four core TGM strategies (updating on caregiving situa-
tion, health and needs of the caregiver and the care-recipient, daily routines and family communications).

BRIEF NAME

Mastery of dementia (MoD).

WHY

A guided self-help Internet course ‘Mastery over Dementia’ (MoD) de-
signed to reduce caregivers’ symptoms of depression and anxiety.
MoD included a combination of psycho-education with active partic-
ipation of the caregiver, management of behavioral problems, teach-
ing coping strategies, components of cognitive behavioral therapy
(cognitive reframing: changing non-helpful into helpful thoughts), and
increasing social support.

WHAT materials

Internet contents.

PROCEDURES

The Internet course consists of 8 lessons and a booster session with
the guidance of a coach monitoring the progress of participants and
evaluating the homework. Each lesson has the same structure and
consists of information (text material and videos), exercises, and
homework, with an evaluation at the start and end of each session.
The elements of the course were presented in the following order:

· coping with behavioral problems (problem solving)

· relaxation

· arranging help from others

Minimal Intervention (e-bul-
letins).

No applicable.

E-bulletins (digital newsletters).

Caregivers received a minimal
intervention consisting of e-bul-
letins (digital newsletters) with
practical information on provid-
ing care for someone with de-
mentia. The bulletins were sent
by email according to a fixed
schedule (every 3 weeks) over
nearly 6 months. The topics of
the bulletin, which did not over-
lap with the content of MoD,
were:

· changing non-helping thoughts into helping thoughts (cognitive re-
structuring)

· driving

· communication with others (assertiveness training).

The booster session was provided a month after participants finished
the eight lessons, and provided a summary of what was learned.

· holiday breaks

· medication

· legal affairs

After every lesson, participants sent their homework to a coach via a
secure application. The coach sent electronic feedback to caregivers
on their homework within three working days. The feedback had to
be opened before the next lesson could be started. Participants were
automatically reminded to start with a new lesson or to send in their
homework if they were not active for a fixed period of time. All par-
ticipants in this study received feedback from the same coach, a psy-
chologist employed by a health care agency with additional training in
cognitive behavioral therapy and experience in the field of dementia.

BRIEF NAME

Named "intervention condition".

Two control conditions which were
combined: attention control and infor-

WHY

The intervention condition was modelled after the REACH II in-

No described.

WHAT materials

A videophone (CISCO IP 7900) was installed in the caregivers’
homes and connected to a Digital Subscriber Line and to a se-
cure server at the host site. Participants in this condition also
received a caregiver notebook with basic information about
caregiving and community resources.

Caregivers in the attention condition
were provided with a notebook with
information related to nutrition.

The information condition group re-
ceived educational materials with ba-
sic information about dementia, safe-
ty, and community resources.

PROCEDURES

The intervention included education and skills training. It was
designed to address five caregiver risk areas (safety, social sup-
port, problem behaviours, depression, and caregiver health).
The intervention was standardized with respect to the treat-
ment domains and strategies used within the treatment do-
mains but individualized with respect to the amount of empha-
sis within a treatment domain based on a risk assessment ad-
ministered at baseline. Certified interventionists taught prob-
lem solving strategies to deal with the care recipients’ prob-
lem behaviours and training on stress management, healthy
behavior strategies, community resources, and communica-
tion strategies. The intervention included six 1-hour monthly

Attention condition: participants re-
ceived two 1-hour in-home sessions
and four videophone sessions. They al-
so participated in five telephone sup-
port group sessions, which were inter-
spersed with the individual interven-
tion sessions. The support groups fol-
lowed the same format as those for the
intervention group. The content for the
attention control condition was struc-
tured around nutrition and healthy
eating.

sented serially; a new video appeared monthly beginning in
month 2 of the intervention.The intervention also included five
videophone support group sessions, which were interspersed
throughout the intervention period. The support groups were
structured and included up to six caregivers and a certified

Telephone training or in-home training (this review only includes evidence
from telephone training).

Friendly, socially support-
ive, telephone calls.

The study was grounded in the stress, appraisal and coping theory of
Lazarus. The premise for the caregivers skill training intervention was that
improvements in caregiver's outcomes could be addressed by expanding
caregiver's repertoire of effective appraisal and coping strategies through
telephone training strategies

WHAT materials

Caregivers received a standardized, loose-leaf notebook with suggestions
for managing frequently encountered Alzheimer’s disease situations. They
had to fill out a weekly log on problems they had managed over the past
week.

Socially supportive friendly
telephone calls.

· Session 2: Mindfulness – Teach concepts of mindful attention and
non-judgment. Homework: (a) practice awareness of breathing and
meditation for 10 minutes daily and (b) once a day take the time to
enjoy something that you usually hurry through, do one thing at a
time, and pay attention to it. Participants were encouraged to con-
tinue the breathing exercise through the remaining weeks of the in-
tervention and to continue the gratitude journal.

· Session 3: Positive Reappraisal – Discuss the meaning of positive
reappraisal and how to apply it to everyday occurrences. Homework:
each day think of one negative or stressful thing that happened.
Practice positive reappraisal – why it may not be as bad as initial-
ly thought or something good that might come of it. Participants
were encouraged to write about their experience reappraising at the
end of each day and to continue their gratitude journal and mindful
breathing exercises.

· Session 4: Personal Strengths and Attainable Goal – Generate a list
of personal strengths that can be used in everyday life. Define attain-
able goals and practice setting one related to self-care. Homework:
achieve attainable goal. Participants were encouraged to write about
their goals at end of day and to continue their gratitude journal and
mindful breathing exercises.

· Session 5: Altruistic Behaviors/Acts of Kindness – Doing for Others –
Discuss the positive impact of doing for others. Homework: do some-
thing nice for someone else each day. Participants were encouraged
to write about their acts of kindness at end of day and to continue

BRIEF NAME

My Tools 4 Care (MT4C).

WHY

The aim of the intervention, based on transition theory, was to support car-
ers through transitions and increase their self-efficacy, hope, and health re-
lated quality of life. The intervention had multiple components and includ-
ed choice, as the carers could choose which sections they would like use,
and when. User-generated content is encouraged throughout the interven-
tion as participants may write in sections, add stories, pictures, music etc.
Sections include:

· About Me

· Common Changes to Expect

· Frequently Asked Questions and Resources

· Important Health Information (about person they are caring for).

WHAT materials

An online version of the Toolkit entitled My Tools 4 Care (MT4C) (https://

WHY

No described.

WHAT materials

PROCEDURES

Caregivers in the video condition received a 10-session
video series, a workbook from the Dementia Caregiving
Skills Program, and weekly telephone calls from a trained
coach.

Participants received by mail a 37-page
booklet, Basic Dementia Care Guide and
phone calls.

The intervention used primarily behavioural strategies: be-
havioural activation, behavioural management, and stress
reduction through relaxation training. The workbook pro-
vided didactic and experimental materials to reinforce in-
formation presented in each video session. Participants re-
ceived 12 weekly phone calls by trained research staff who
served as coaches. The first 10 calls reinforced each of the
video sessions, the last 2 calls served as follow-up for fur-
ther application of concepts. Coaches followed a coach
manual that provided a script for reviewing didactic ma-
terials and assignments with caregivers, and for assisting
them in the application of intervention concepts to their
problems. During the coaching calls caregivers reported
the specific behavioural strategies that they devised, writ-
ten down, used, and evaluated, based on the behaviour
management module that they learned to apply to their sit-
uations.

Intervention included information on de-
mentia and suggestions for dealing with a
variety of caregiving challenges. In a cov-
er letter, procedures for maximizing the
benefits of this educational booklet were
provided. Caregivers then received approx-
imately 7 biweekly telephone calls by a
trained staff member. In these calls, the
staff member checked on the safety of the
caregiver and family member, discussed
the caregiver’s use of the suggestions from
the guide, and responded to questions by
referring the caregiver to appropriate sec-
tions in the guide. A standardized script
was used for calls to participants in this
comparison condition.

· advising based upon personal health risks

· agreeing on a realistic set of goals

· assisting in anticipating barriers and developing a specific action plan

· arranging follow-up.

WHAT materials

Emails, online videos, e-bulletins.

PROCEDURES

The major intervention arm consists of the following elements:

· 3 personal email contacts with a nurse specialized in dementia care

· provision of 6 online videos about how to manage behavior changes in a rel-
ative with dementia and to improve self-efficacy in managing with this be-
havior

· provision of e-bulletins with practical information about different types of
behavior changes and how to manage them

The nurse gave feedback on assignments and gave feedback on the plan that
the family caregiver came up with in the assignments.There were 6 videos
about different types of behavior changes that occur frequently (dependent
behavior, aggressive behavior, suspicious behavior, apathy or indifference,
nighttime restlessness, and masking behavior). Family caregivers chosen the
number of videos they watch and the accompanying assignments that they
do themselves, depending on their own needs and the behavior changes that
occur in their relative with dementia. The behavior changes covered in the
bulletins were the same as in the videos. The e-bulletins involve assignments
to help caregivers translate the generic information to their own situation
and to reflect on possible causes of the behavior changes, how they want to
influence the behavior, and how they want to cope with it.

Education/Information-On-
ly Condition (EOC).

The EOC served as a control
for the purpose of obtaining
new information about de-
mentia and what to expect
in caring for dementia pa-
tients. It also controlled for
the involvement with rele-
vant information on the In-
ternet and for the general
cognitive and experiential
capacity required to ‘nav-
igate’ in complex Internet
materials.

Caregivers assigned to the
EOC were exposed to a web-
site containing similar navi-
gational features, but with
content focused on infor-
mation about dementia, ob-
tained from reputable na-
tional sources. In addition,
links to certain video-taped
information were provided.

BRIEF NAME

iCare Stress Management e-Training Program (ICC).

WHY

The iCare program is an adaptation of the psycho- educational program
‘Coping with Caregiving’ (CwC) developed by Gallagher-Thompson and
colleagues that aims to teach a set of core coping skills to caregivers for
stress management. These include: relaxation training; learning to in-
crease everyday pleasant activities (including if possible some pleasant
activities with the person with dementia); cognitive restructuring (of un-
duly negative appraisals regarding caregiving and themselves); and im-
proved communication skills on how to ask for help effectively from family
members and relevant community and medical institutions.

WHAT materials

Website and video-recordings.

PROCEDURES

Educational modules had a hierarchical structure. Participants were en-
couraged to practice specific assignments in each module over a 7-to-10-
day interval before moving to the next one. The iCare program consists of
the following modules:

· information segment about what ‘dementia’ means and what are com-
mon problems associated with it

· components on dealing with stress including techniques for relaxation,
stress management, and challenging unduly negative thoughts about
caregiving

· behavioral activation (increasing everyday positive activities for oneself
and the patient with dementia)

· communication skills to improve help-seeking with family and communi-
ty institutions as well as improving ability to relate to the patient with de-
mentia

· managing difficult behaviours of the patient with dementia

· review of ‘healthy habits’ (nutrition and exercise) for the caregiver along
with information on national resources they can consult for further on-go-
ing assistance

At the end of each module, CGs were asked to create their own individ-
ual ‘action plans’ in the workbook requiring them to describe what they
had learned by completing the module and relevant assignments and how
they planned to use the information from that specific module in the fu-
ture in their daily lives.

Content and structure of the intervention were based on the 6-month REACH
II intervention of 12 individual in-home and telephone sessions and five tele-
phone support group sessions.

Session materials consisted of a Caregiver Notebook and commercially avail-
able pamphlets. The Notebook comprised 29 behaviour – management chap-
ters of five to eight pages each (i.e., bathing, repeated questions), and 17 care-
giver stress/coping chapters (i.e., assertiveness, communication, grief) based
on research and practice, written in large print and at a fifth-grade reading lev-
el.

Control caregivers re-
ceived pamphlets on
dementia and safety as
well as telephone num-
bers for local resources.

Like REACH, the multi-component intervention targeted caregiving risks, in-
cluding risks associated with emotional and physical well-being, safety, bur-
den, social support, and patient behaviour management. The first six sessions
covered all Caregiver Notebook chapters that were standardized to include
the following topics:

Control caregivers re-
ceived pamphlets on
dementia and safety as
well as telephone num-
bers for local resources.

· introduction

· basic information about dementia and financial and legal issues

· safety

· caregiver health and well-being

· communication

· problem solving

The sessions were semi-structured telephone calls with education, skills-build-
ing, and support. Each session began with a relaxation exercise, caregiver up-
dates, review of strategies tried from the preceding session’s topic, and the
group leader’s presentation on a behaviour management or stress and cop-
ing topic.The rest of the session included discussion and practice by the entire
group on the session’s topic, selection of individual strategies to try, selection
of the next session’s topic, and closure, including another signal breath relax-
ation exercise.

PROCEDURES

ALADDIN is a computerized platform designed to offer avenues of support and infor-
mation to the carer. It also manages and communicates information related to the pa-
tient with dementia and their carers from their home to the clinicians, facilitating dis-
tant monitoring. ALADDIN has four key features:

· ‘ALADDIN TV’ provides information and educational material about dementia, as well
as musical entertainment and relaxation and exercise techniques

· The ‘SOCIAL NETWORKING’ feature provides a forum for carers using ALADDIN to
communicate with each other

· ‘MY TASKS’ is the distant monitoring feature of ALADDIN, where carers complete
questionnaires about their own and their relatives’ health. Their responses can subse-
quently generate clinical alerts based on set parameters, comparing new responses to
previous data, resulting in the immediate detection of change by the clinicians moni-
toring the system

· The ‘CONTACT US’ feature allows the carer to alert the clinical site and/or generate a
request for contact

WHAT materials

Treatment manual and interventions guide. Telephone.

PROCEDURES

Telephone calls included an initial call (orientation and psychoeducation), weekly calls
for six weeks, 12 additional contacts every two weeks, and four monthly termination
calls. Initial contacts lasted approximately 60 minutes, and follow-up contacts lasted
about 15–30 minutes.

No applicable

No applicable.

The calls focused on providing emotional support, directing caregivers to appropriate
resources, encouraging caregivers to attend to their own physical, emotional and so-
cial needs, and teaching caregivers strategies to cope with ongoing problems. The in-
tervention did not provide case management, serve as a question-and-answer hotline,
or provide psychotherapy over the telephone.

The FITT method consists of two stages:

· The initial stage, Orientation and Psychoeducation, involved providing caregivers
with a rationale for the FITT, an introduction to educational and resource materials, a
description of what would happen during future phone contacts and an assessment
of key areas thought to be instrumental in addressing caregiver burden and mental
health (i.e., caregivers’ health, functioning, mood, thinking and family life). The psy-
choeducation component of this initial stage involved reviewing information about de-
mentia and common psychological, emotional, psychosocial and medical effects of
caregiving

· The second stage, Follow-up, involved weekly and bi-weekly contacts in which new
problems were identified, positive and negative changes in caregivers or care recipi-
ents were discussed, and psychoeducational information was reviewed and applied for
particular situations. The final four follow-up calls (monthly) addressed issues of termi-
nation by allowing caregivers to anticipate FITT contacts coming to an end and to fos-
ter reliance on the support network established during the intervention.

WHO provided

Two master’s level therapists who were trained in the FITT-D procedure delivered the

BRIEF NAME

Family Intervention: Telephone Tracking-Caregiver (FITT-C).

Telephone Support (TS).

WHY

The theoretical framework of FITT-C is based on psychoso-
cial transition, transactional stress and coping, and a systems
view of family functioning. The three underlying theories of
FITT-C are geared toward enhancing coping within the care-
giver through active problem solving and facilitating positive
changes within the family system.

The control condition was designed to
account for nonspecific therapeutic fac-
tors, such as interpersonal contact and
relationship. The approach was based
on a nondirective control condition.

WHAT materials

Telephone.

Telephone.

PROCEDURES

Focused on providing dementia education, emotional sup-
port, directing caregivers to appropriate resources, encourag-
ing caregivers to attend to their physical, emotional, and so-
cial needs, and teaching caregivers strategies to cope with on-
going problems. The FITT method consisted of an initial ori-
entation and psycho- education call that involved providing
caregivers with a rationale of FITT, an introduction to the re-
source materials, a description of future telephone contacts,
and education about dementia and effects of caregiving. The
remaining contacts identified changes since the last call, as-
sessed key areas for the caregiver (i.e., health, functioning,
mood, social support, and family life), and provided inter-
ventions and psychoeducation to help caregivers solve prob-
lems and use family resources. The focus of the final two calls
changed to identifying helpful aspects of contacts and how
these functions could be met after termination. After the fi-
nal call, the therapist prepared a letter briefly highlighting the
progress during the intervention and encouraged the caregiv-
er to continue to develop and use adaptive coping strategies.

The primary goal of this condition was
to provide nondirective support for
caregivers through empathic and reflec-
tive listening and open-ended question-
ing. The role of the therapist was to pro-
vide unconditional positive regard to
caregivers and to establish a supportive
relationship. Therapists were discour-
aged from providing directive strategies,
such as education, problem-solving, ad-
vice-giving, or task directives. However,
education was not withheld if the care-
giver had the wrong information.

WHO provided

Individuals recruited to serve as therapists had experience working with dementia patients and/or care-
givers or psychotherapy experience working with adults. Therapists were required to be master’s level
and received training in dementia and caregiving. FITT-C therapists received additional training in the in-
tervention method.

HOW delivered

Telephone.

WHERE occurred

At home.

WHEN and HOW MUCH

16 telephone contacts over 6 months. Although initial telephone contacts had standardized durations
(approximately 60 minutes), follow-up contacts varied depending on the severity of caregiver problems
(15–30 minutes).

TAILORING

Interventions were comprehensively designed, not tailored to cover individual or unmeet needs.

MODIFICATIONS

None described.

HOW WELL planned

Quality control was implemented by weekly supervision of both the FITT-C and TS therapists. All tele-
phone contacts were audiotaped, and a subset was reviewed during supervision sessions to ensure ad-
herence and to better guide therapists’ intervention strategies. Any deviations from the treatment proto-
col were brought to the therapist’s attention for remediation.

PROCEDURES

The primary goal was to enhance caregiver ability to manage daily stressors by pro-
viding emotional support and validation. Initially, facilitators focused on developing
group cohesion. As groups progress, disclosure of intimate problems and personal
conflicts emerge. Caregivers express emotions and share coping strategies including
cognitive reframing and practical approaches to organizing care routines. They also as-
sist each other in problem solving and share educational resources. The mutual sup-
port and validation provided by group members normalize experiences and provide a
supportive social network, core to the service model.

All review authors (EGF, JB, JRR, BSZ, IS, JM) contributed to the design, development, and drafting the protocol.

Pairs  of  review  authors  (EGF,  JB,  JRR,  GM,  BSZ,  JM)  screened  the  studies  for  eligibility,  obtained  full  text  studies  and  performed  data
abstraction.

Pairs of review authors (EGF, JB, JRR, IS) assessed the risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence (GRADE).

JB and BSZ conducted data analysis; EGF, JRR and JM assisted with data interpretation.

• In a significant change from the published protocol on which this review was based, we amended the criteria for eligibility of studies
in order to focus on remotely delivered interventions. This change was made in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic for reasons
explained more fully in the Background section.

• We moved the outcome 'number of dropouts for any reason,' as a surrogate for intervention acceptability, from secondary to primary
outcomes before data analysis in consultation with the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG). This was done
because  Cochrane  recommends  that  primary  outcomes  should  include  at  least  one  harm-related  outcome.  We  did  not  anticipate

that harms would be reported in many included studies, but considered that reasons for dropout would be likely to include some
'harms' (such as unacceptable additional burden of the intervention), among other reasons.

• The published protocol did not specify the exact comparisons to be made. After reviewing previous literature, communicating with
experts  in  the  field  and  discussion  with  the  CDCIG,  we  defined  two  main  comparisons.  Because  many  studies  of  interventions  for
caregivers use an information-only intervention as a comparator for a more complex intervention, these comparisons were of complex
interventions  versus  either  (i)  waiting  list,  usual  care  or  a  non-specific  intervention  serving  as  an  attention  control,  or  (ii)  a  simple
information intervention. Because almost all complex interventions include an element of information-provision (i.e. there are very few
pure training or pure support interventions), we then defined the following subgroups within the complex interventions: support or
support and information, training or training and information, and multicomponent interventions including support and training with
or without information. These decisions were made prior to data analysis.

• We did not proceed to additional subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses as planned in the original protocol because of insufficient
