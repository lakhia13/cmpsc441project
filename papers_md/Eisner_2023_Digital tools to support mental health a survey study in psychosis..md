Digital tools to support mental health: 
a survey study in psychosis
Emily Eisner1,2, Natalie Berry1,2 and Sandra Bucci1,2* 

Abstract 
Background  There is a notable a gap between promising research findings and implementation of digital health 
tools. Understanding and addressing barriers to use is key to widespread implementation.

Methods  A survey was administered to a self-selecting sample in-person (n = 157) or online (n = 58), with questions 
examining: i) ownership and usage rates of digital devices among people with psychosis; ii) interest in using technol-
ogy to engage with mental health services; and iii) facilitators of and barriers to using digital tools in a mental health-
care context.

Results  Device ownership: Virtually all participants owned a mobile phone (95%) or smartphone (90%), with Android 
phones slightly more prevalent than iPhones. Only a minority owned a fitness tracker (15%) or smartwatch (13%). 
Device ownership was significantly lower in unemployed people and those without secondary education. Device 
cost and paranoid ideation were barriers to ownership.

Technology and mental health services: Most participants (88%) said they would willingly try a mental health app. 
Symptom monitoring apps were most popular, then appointment reminders and medication reminders. Half 
the sample would prefer an app alongside face-to-face support; the other half preferred remote support or no other 
mental health support.

Facilitators: Participants thought using a mental health app could increase their understanding of psychosis gener-
ally, and of their own symptoms. They valued the flexibility of digital tools in enabling access to support anywhere, 
anytime.

Barriers: Prominent barriers to using mental health apps were forgetting, lack of motivation, security concerns, 
and concerns it would replace face-to-face care. Overall participants reported no substantial effects of technology 
on their mental health, although a quarter said using a phone worsened paranoid ideation. A third used technol-
ogy more when psychotic symptoms were higher, whereas a third used it less. Around half used technology more 
when experiencing low mood.

Conclusions  Our findings suggest rapidly increasing device ownership among people with psychosis, mirroring 
patterns in the general population. Smartphones appear appropriate for delivering internet-enabled support for psy-
chosis. However, for a sub-group of people with psychosis, the sometimes complex interaction between technology 
and mental health may act as a barrier to engagement, alongside more prosaic factors such as forgetting.

Background
Over  the  past  decade,  countless  digital  health  tools  for 
people  with  severe  mental  health  problems  (SMI)  have 
been  developed  and  tested  worldwide  [1–5].  Numerous 
studies have demonstrated high rates of engagement with 
digital  health  tools  among  people  with  schizophrenia-
spectrum  psychosis  (hereafter  shortened  to  ‘psychosis’), 
including  samples  at  high  risk  of  relapse  [6–9],  and  evi-
dence  of  efficacy  and  effectiveness  is  rapidly  accumu-
lating  [10,  11].  Such  advancements  could  help  address 
challenges  that  services  and  service  users  face  in  deliv-
ering  and  receiving  time-sensitive  healthcare.  However, 
there is a notable a gap between promising research find-
ings  and  implementation  of  digital  health  tools  in  ser-
vices. Compared with other mental health groups, people 
with psychosis are often excluded from accessing digital 
health technologies [12].

A  range  of  barriers,  including  very  practical  barriers 
(e.g. owning a device), can hinder successful implementa-
tion of digital tools. Research in psychosis samples exam-
ining implementation barriers and facilitators is ongoing 
[13].  Although  several  studies  have  examined  device 
ownership in samples with psychosis, the evolving land-
scape of ever-increasing ownership, globally, means these 
figures need updating regularly.

A  meta-analysis  of  studies  published  2009–2015 
showed  an  overall  mobile  phone  ownership  rate  among 
people with psychosis of 66.4% [14]. In a scoping search, 
we found ten studies [15–24], published since this meta-
analysis  [14],  that  reported  device  ownership  among 
people  with  psychosis:  four  from  the  US,  two  from  the 
UK (London only), and four from elsewhere (Spain, Por-
tugal,  Australia,  Canada).  We  calculated  that  the  aver-
age  mobile  phone  ownership  rate  among  these  studies, 
weighted by sample size, was 82% (range 60%-98%), with 
the  weighted  average  for  smartphone  ownership  being 
62%  (range  54%-84%).  Evidently  there  was  a  marked 
increase in device ownership in the intervening years.

Even studies published the same year as the meta-anal-
ysis  [14]  report  substantially  higher  usage,  emphasising 
how  rapidly  this  increased.  For  example,  Gay  and  col-
leagues  [15]  reported  82.9%  mobile  phone  access,  54% 
smartphone  access  and  89%  computer  access,  and  a  UK 
study [16] reported 54% smartphone ownership. The lat-
ter study also reported that only 18% of the sample were 
digitally excluded in 2016, compared to 30% in 2011.

As smartphone and other device ownership rates con-
tinue  to  increase,  and  often  vary  geographically,  little  is 
known  about  current  rates  of  device  ownership  and  use 
among  people  with  psychosis  in  the  UK,  and  how  indi-
viduals with psychosis interact with and feel about digi-
tal  devices.  Understanding  and  addressing  barriers  to 
device  use,  in  order  to  close  the  ‘digital  divide’,  is  key 

to  widespread  implementation  and  adoption  of  digital 
health strategies.

The  aims  of  this  survey  study  are  to:  i)  understand 
digital  device  ownership  and  usage  rates  in  a  sample  of 
people with psychosis; ii) explore interest in using tech-
nology  to  engage  with  mental  health  services;  and  iii) 
understand  facilitators  of  and  barriers  to  using  digital 
tools in the context of mental healthcare.

Methods
Setting and participants

The  survey  was  conducted  between  April  2018  and  Sep-
tember  2020.  Individuals  enrolled  in  a  digital  health  trial 
in  secondary  care  services  in  the  Northwest  of  England, 
Actissist2  (Bucci  S:  Effects  of  Actissist,  a  digital  health 
intervention for early psychosis: a randomized clinical trial, 
in  preparation),  or  who  responded  to  online  advertise-
ments, were invited to take part in this survey study. Inclu-
sion  criteria  were:  i)  schizophrenia-spectrum  diagnosis 
(determined by a clinician, if recruited through Actissist2, 
or self-reported if recruited online) or meeting criteria to 
receive care for a psychosis-related disorder from second-
ary care mental health services; ii) aged > 16 years; iii) able 
to provide consent; iv) English speaking.

The  survey  was  administered  in  paper-based  format 
or via online survey software. Paper-based surveys were 
completed  in  a  researcher’s  presence,  with  support  if 
required  (e.g.  reading  items  if  poor  eyesight  or  reading 
difficulties).  The  online  version  was  administered  via 
REDCap  [25,  26].  Advertisements  were  posted  in  men-
tal  health  service  waiting  areas,  on  mental  health  char-
ity websites, University research pages, and social media 
(e.g.  Twitter).  The  survey  took  approximately  20  min  to 
complete  and  was  approved  by  the  relevant  ethics  com-
mittee.  Participants  received  written  information  about 
the study, indicated consent before proceeding and could 
enter a prize draw (£50 prize).

Survey design and development

Data  were  collected  through  a  cross-sectional  survey 
gathering  information  about  participants’  use  of  and 
views  about  digital  technology  (see  Additional  file  1), 
alongside  basic  demographic  information.  We  reviewed 
and  included  survey  items  from  other  studies  [16,  27–
32] and included our own items informed by qualitative 
study  findings  [33–36].  Items  were  generally  rated  on 
Likert  scales  reflecting  level  of  agreement  or  frequency 
of  use.  Patient  and  public  contributors  reviewed  survey 
items for acceptability and relevance.

Data analysis

Descriptive  statistics  explored  technology  ownership/
usage,  interest  in  mental  health  apps,  and  attitudes

technology.  Relationship  between 
responses  and  demographic  variables  were  examined 
using  Mann–Whitney  U  test  (non-normally  distrib-
uted  continuous  variables),  Chi  squared  test  (categori-
cal  variables)  or  Fisher’s  exact  test  (categorical  variables 
with expected cell counts < 5 [37]; i.e., mobile ownership, 
smartphone ownership).

We excluded 26 participants who consented but com-
pleted  no  survey  items.  In  presenting  data  from  the 
remaining  participants,  we  dealt  with  missing  data  by 

excluding  cases  listwise.  Analyses  were  conducted  using 
Stata  Version  14.0  [38].  Statistical  tests  were  considered 
statistically  significant  at  P < 0.05.  Where  possible,  boot-
strapping produced 95% confidence intervals.

demographic  characteristics  for  the  two  sub-samples 
and  overall  sample.  Most  participants  had  a  psychosis/
schizophrenia diagnosis (psychosis: 131/215, 61%; schiz-
ophrenia: 29/215, 13%). Slightly over half were male and 
the  median  age  was 26  years. Quarter  were  from ethnic 
minority  groups,  most  had  completed  secondary  edu-
cation,  and  slightly  under  half  were  in  paid/voluntary 
employment or education.

The  two  subsamples  differed  significantly  in  gender 
(χ2(2) = 25.50, P = 0.001; Actissist2 subsample more male), 
ethnicity  (χ2(5) = 17.45,  P = 0.004;  Actissist2  more  ethni-
cally  diverse),  relationship  status  (χ2(4) = 27.47, P = 0.001; 
Actissist2  more  single)  and  diagnosis  (χ2(3) = 18.21, 
P = 0.001;  Actissist2  sample  more  schizophrenia/psycho-
sis diagnoses). Subsamples did not differ in age (z = -0.304, 
P = 0.76), education (χ2(2) = 3.83, P = 0.15) or employment 
status (χ2(3) = 3.83, P = 0.28).

Device ownership and use
Mobile phones

Almost  all  participants  owned  a  mobile  phone  (95%) 
and  most  (90%)  had  smartphones  (of  which:  55%  were 
Android,  44%  iOS,  1%  other;  Fig.  1).  Of  11  participants 
without  their  own  phone,  nine  had  occasional  access 
to  someone  else’s  (5  Android,  2  iOS,  1  unknown,  1 
non-smartphone).

Unemployed  people  were  significantly  less  likely  to 
own  any  type  of  mobile  phone  (unemployed  92%;  oth-
ers  98%;  P = 0.046),  and  significantly  less  likely  to  own  a 
smartphone  specifically  (unemployed  89%;  others  97%; 
P = 0.016), than people in paid/voluntary work, who were 
a student/apprentice, or who had household/caring duties. 
Similarly,  people  whose  highest  education  was  primary 
school  were  less  likely  to  own  any  type  of  mobile  phone 
(primary  education  75%;  secondary  96%;  tertiary  95%; 
P = 0.07), and less likely to own a smartphone specifically 

Fig. 1  Breakdown of mobile phone ownership by device type. 
Starting from the centre, the three circles represent the whole 
sample (N = 215, pink), mobile phone owners (n = 204, purple) 
and smartphone owners (n = 194, turquoise), respectively

(primary 63%; secondary 94%; tertiary 95%; P = 0.02), than 
those  with  secondary/tertiary  education,  although  this 
only reached statistical significance for smartphone own-
ership. Mobile phone and/or smartphone ownership rates 
were  not  significantly  associated  with  any  other  partici-
pant characteristics (gender, ethnicity, relationship status, 
diagnosis  or  age).  However,  Actissist2  participants  were 
significantly less likely to own a mobile phone than online 
participants  (Actissist2  93%;  online  100%;  P = 0.04),  but 
there was no significant difference in smartphone owner-
ship (Actissist2 91%; online 97%; P = 0.25).

Regarding  paying  for  phone  use,  34%  had  a  Pay-As-
You-Go  phone,  59%  a  monthly  contract  (37%  phone-
plus-SIM  contract;  22%  SIM-only),  and  7%  reported 
that someone else paid for their phone use. Around 42% 
(90/212)  endorsed  at  least  one  barrier  to  owning/using 
a  mobile  phone,  including:  feeling  paranoid/suspicious 
about  mobile  phones  (n = 42),  struggling  to  afford  one 
(n = 29),  repeatedly  losing/damaging  them  (n = 28),  not 
knowing how to use certain phone features (n = 15), lack 
of interest (n = 10) or need (n = 7) for a mobile phone, and 
not knowing how to use one (n = 3).

Figure 2 shows the percentage of participants reporting 
using specific features of their mobile phone (or one they 
had access to). The features most respondents used were 
making  phone  calls  (95%),  sending  text  messages  (94%), 
internet  (87%),  camera  (86%)  and  alarm  (86%).  Most 
respondents  also  used  a  mobile  phone  for  email  (80%), 
apps  (77%),  music  (74%),  and  the  calendar  (70%),  while 
only a small proportion (22%) used a phone for the radio.

Wearable devices

A  minority  (21%)  owned  a  wearable  device  (15%  fitness 
tracker;  13%  smartwatch),  with  an  additional  3%  report-
ing  access  to  a  fitness  tracker  (not  owned).  Unemployed 
people were significantly less likely to own a fitness tracker 
(unemployed  7%;  others  23%;  P = 0.001)  or  smartwatch 
(unemployed  7%;  others  19%;  P = 0.02).  People  with  a 
schizophrenia/psychosis  diagnosis  were  less  likely  to  own 
a  fitness  tracker  (schizophrenia/psychosis  12%;  other  29%; 
P = 0.02)  or  smartwatch  (schizophrenia/psychosis  10%; 
other  26%;  P = 0.02).  Ownership  rates  for  fitness  trackers, 
but not smartwatches, were significantly lower among single 
people (10% owned a fitness tracker) than people in a rela-
tionship  (23%  owned  one;  P = 0.02)  and  among  the  online 
sample  (31%)  than  the  Actissist2  sample  (9%;  P = 0.001). 
Gender, ethnicity, education and age were not significantly 
associated with ownership rates of either device.

Frequency of phone and other device use

As  Fig.  3  shows, > 80%  of  respondents  used  a  mobile 
phone/smartphone and the internet (via mobile phone/
tablet)  multiple  times  a  day.  Around  two-thirds  also

used apps and/or social media multiple times a day, with 
most  using  these  features  at  least  once  a  month.  Over 
half of respondents used a laptop at least once a month 
(59%),  with  only  a  third  using  laptops  daily.  Most  used 
fitness trackers infrequently, with a very small minority 
using a fitness tracker (11%) or smartwatch (9%) multi-
ple times a day/daily/a few times a week.

App and social media use
App use

Figure  4  shows  frequency  of  smartphone  app  usage. 
Most  respondents  used  instant  messaging  and  social 
media  apps  multiple  times  a  day.  Around  a  third  used 
entertainment  apps  at  least  daily.  Less  frequently  used 
apps were gaming, video calling and health-related apps.

Fig. 4  Frequency of smartphone app use

Figure  5  illustrates  the  apps  participants  listed  in 
response  to  the  instruction  “If  you  have  ever  used  men-
tal  health/wellbeing/mindfulness  app(s),  please 
indi-
cate  which  apps  these  were”.  Headspace  was  the  most 
listed health app, with other frequently listed health apps 
including  Mindfulness,  Calm,  and  Mood  Tracker.  Par-
ticipants  also  listed  more  general  apps  in  response  to 

this  question,  including  social  media  apps,  presumably 
because  they  used  these  to  support  their  mental  health. 
Of app use reported in response to this question, 49% was 
current use (51% past), with 44% at least daily, 34% at least 
monthly  and  22%  less  than  monthly.  Slightly  under  half 
(46%) of this app use was judged helpful/very helpful, with 
43% neutral and 11% “unhelpful – made me feel worse”.

Social media use

Overall, 85% reported using social media at some point. 
Unemployed  people  were  significantly  less  likely  to  use 
social media than others, but no other demographic vari-
ables were associated with use (Table 2). Figure 6 shows 
frequency  of  using  specific  social  media  sites.  Facebook 
was the most popular (71% used a few times a week), fol-
lowed  by  Instagram  (43%),  Snapchat  (31%)  and  Twitter 
(21%).  Very  few  ever  used  LinkedIn  (21%),  Google  Plus 
(15%) or MySpace (3%).

Nearly  half  (48%)  of  social  media  users  would  like  to 
participate  in  a  social  media  group  of  others  with  psy-
chosis.  Demographic  characteristics  did  not  distinguish 
those  who  would  vs  would  not  like  to  participate.  Less 
than  a  third  of  participants  had  previously  posted  on 
social media about their physical health (29%) or mental 

health  (31%).  There  were  several  statistically  significant 
associations  with  demographic  characteristics  (Table  2), 
including:  gender  (females  posted  most),  ethnicity 
(white  and  mixed  race  people  posted  most),  employ-
ment  (employed/volunteers/students  and  people  with 
household/caring  duties  posted  most),  relationship  sta-
tus (people in a relationship posted most) and diagnosis 
(people with a schizophrenia/psychosis diagnosis posted 
least). Finally, online participants were significantly more 
likely to have posted about physical or mental health than 
Actissist2 participants.

Technology and engagement with services
Interest in mental health app

Most  (88%)  would  try  a  “mobile  phone  app  for  men-
tal  health”  if  offered  (8%  unsure).  Actissist2  participants

Fig. 6  Frequency of using social media sites

were  significantly  more  likely  to  want  to  use  one  (93% 
would  use)  than  the  online  sample  (71%  would  use; 
P = 0.001).  Of  participants  expressing  interest  in  using 
one, around half (53%) would want to use a mental health 
app  in  conjunction  with  face-to-face  support,  14%  with 
remote mental health support and 32% on its own with-
out other mental health support. Support preferences did 
not  differ  significantly  between  Actissist2  participants 
and  online  participants  (P = 0.24).  Around  half  of  inter-
ested  participants  (47%)  would  not  be  willing  to  pay  for 
a mental health app; 24% would pay up to £0.99 and 28% 
would pay more than £0.99 for such an app.

Symptom monitoring apps

As  with  a  more  general  “mental  health  app”,  most  par-
ticipants  (86%)  would  use  a  phone  app  to  record  their 
symptoms over time. Of those interested, 67% were will-
ing for symptom data to be automatically transferred to 
the  care  team,  17%  would  want  to  choose  which  infor-
mation  was  transferred,  and  10%  would  like  to  show 
the  care  team  their  app  responses  directly  during  an 
appointment.  Only  6%  would  not  want  their  care  team 
to see the app-reported symptom information. Actissist2 
participants  were  more  interested  in  automatic  trans-
fer  (75%  endorsed  this  option)  than  online  participants 
(36%;  P = 0.001).  Regarding  how  the  app  asks  symptom 
questions, 46% preferred app-generated reminders, 19% 
preferred  to  answer  when  they  chose,  and  35%  would 
like  a  combination.  Actissist2  participants  were  signifi-
cantly  more  likely  to  want  reminders  (49%)  than  online 

participants (36%; P = 0.04), who tended to prefer a com-
bination of reminders and free choice.

Text messaging vs. apps

Fewer  participants  (59%)  were  interested  in  receiving 
text messages from their care team asking about “symp-
toms, medication side effects or other problems” (Fig. 7) 
than were interested in phone apps for a similar purpose 
(described  above).  Regarding  preferences  for  receiving 
smartphone  app  alerts  or  text  messages  from  their  care 
team (Fig. 7), appointments reminders were popular (71% 
interested in receiving app alerts; 85% text messages) and 
medication reminders less popular (52% interested in app 
alerts; 39% interested in text messages).

Perceived barriers to mental health app use

As Fig. 8 shows, the most frequently endorsed barriers (rated 
“agree” or “strongly agree”) to using a mental health app were 
forgetting (54% of participants) or lacking motivation (50%) 
to use an app. These were followed by data security concerns 
about  who  would  access  the  information  (46%)  or  the  app 
being  hacked  (42%),  and  concerns  that  mental  health  apps 
might replace face-to-face support (39%). Other barriers were 
endorsed by less than 35% of participants. The least endorsed 
were  smartphone  technology  skills  (14%),  reading  difficul-
ties (11%) and physical problems (9%). A content analysis of 
free-text responses (n = 36) yielded several additional barriers, 
including lack of time to use an app due to work/life commit-
ments  (n = 7),  additional  costs  such  as  app  subscription  or 
electricity (n = 4), and poor phone battery (n = 3).

Perceived advantages of mental health apps and suggested 
additional content

As  Fig.  9  shows,  two  frequently  endorsed  advantages 
(rated  “agree”  or  “strongly  agree”)  of  mental  health  apps 
related  to  increasing  one’s  understanding  of  one’s  own 
symptoms (87%), and of psychosis more generally (85%). 
Participants  also  agreed  particularly  strongly  that  an 
app’s flexibility was an important advantage: being able to 
access the app at any time (86%) and in any location (83%).
Almost  all  statements  about  potential  advantages  of 
mental  health  apps  were  endorsed  by  the  majority.  The 
one exception was that an app would be “less stigmatising 
than therapy”.

Participants  could  state  “other  reasons  why  you  might 
want to use a mental health app” (n = 59 responded) and 

“ideas  for  any  other  content  you  would  like  to  see  in  a 
mental health app” (n = 34) via free-text response. A con-
tent  analysis  is  provided  in  Table  3.  Some  of  these  free 
text  responses  elaborate  on  perceived  advantages  pre-
sented  in  Fig.  9.  For  example,  "recording  symptoms  in 
the moment" and "it can remind someone to check their 
mental health regularly" both highlight key advantages of 
app-based self-monitoring.

Current/previous use of technology for managing mental 
health

As  Fig.  10  shows,  many  participants  already  used  tech-
nology  (mobile  phone,  smartwatch  or  computer/tab-
let)  to  help  manage  their  mental  health.  The  most 
popular strategies were using a calendar for appointment 

 Eisner et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:726 

Page 10 of 18

Fig. 9  Perceived advantages of mental health app use

reminders  (60%  “often”  or  “very  often”)  and  listening  to 
music  to  block  or  manage  voices  (54%  “often”  or  “very 
often”).

Many  participants  used  technology  to  find  informa-
tion about mental health problems (46% “often” or “very 
often”;  79%  at  some  point)  or  physical  health  problems 
(40% “often” or “very often”; 79% at some point). Regard-
ing sharing information with their care team (not shown 
in Fig. 10), 35% had shared online information about psy-
chiatric  medications,  and  26%  had  shared  online  infor-
mation about psychological therapy with their care team.
At  least  half  of  participants  had,  at  some  point,  used 
technology  to  set  reminders  about  medication,  support 
others,  identify  coping  strategies,  monitor  symptoms, 
or  connect  with  others  with  lived  experience  of  men-
tal  health  problems.  Only  a  minority  used  technology 
for  reality  testing,  e.g.,  by  photographing  or  recording 
objects/voices that they see/hear that others do not.

Beliefs and attitudes about technology
Attitudes/enthusiasm towards technology

Although  two-thirds  of  participants  were  “enthusiastic” 
about electronics and digital devices, less than half (42%) 
frequently  looked  for  new  software  or  apps,  and  only  a 
third  would  be  described  by  friends  as  “into”  the  latest 
technology (Fig. 11). On the other hand, only a minority 
(20%) find technology frustrating.

Perceived effects of mental health on tech use

Most  participants  (71%)  said  their  technology  use  gen-
erally  remains  constant.  Nevertheless,  some  reported 
changes  in  technology  use  depending  on  their  mood  or 
psychotic  symptoms  (Fig.  11).  Around  half  (53%)  used 

technology  more  during  low  mood,  whereas  19%  used 
technology  less.  Regarding  psychotic  symptoms,  31% 
used technology more when experiencing symptoms and 
33% used technology less.

Impact of mobile phone use on socialising, mental health 
and wellbeing

As  Fig.  12  shows,  a  clear  majority  reported  that  using  a 
mobile phone helped them to socialise with people out-
side their home (76% “agree” or “strongly agree”) and to 
feel  connected  (73%).  Whilst  almost  half  of  participants 
(46%)  agreed  or  strongly  agreed  that  “using  a  mobile 
phone makes me happy”, nearly as many (39%) felt neu-
tral  about  this  statement  (only  15%  disagreed).  Opin-
ions were divided on the idea that “using a mobile phone 
makes me compare myself with others”, with 39% agree-
ing and 39% disagreeing (22% neutral); social media users 
were  significantly  more  likely  to  agree  (44%)  than  non-
social media users (13%; P = 0.001).

Generally,  participants  did  not  believe  that  using  a 
mobile  phone  has  a  substantial  effect  on  their  mental 
health.  Almost  half  (49%)  responded  neutrally  to  the 
statement  “using  a  mobile  phone  helps  with  my  overall 
mental health and wellbeing”, with the rest split roughly 
evenly  between  agrees  (29%)  and  disagrees  (21%).  Simi-
larly, only a minority (13%) found using a mobile phone 
unhelpful  for  their  overall  mental  health  and  wellbeing 
and  only  a  minority  endorsed  statements  asserting  that 
their  mobile  phone  use  made  specific  symptoms  worse 
(paranoia: 26%; voices: 10%; depression/anxiety: 14%) or 
better (voices: 18%). Few participants (21%) worried that 
people  would  find  out  about  their  mental  health  if  they 
used a mobile phone.

Impact of social media use on socialising, mental health 
and wellbeing

A  similar  pattern  was  seen  regarding  participants’ 
beliefs  and  attitudes  about  the  impact  of  social  media 
use  on  their  social  life,  mental  health  and  wellbeing 
(Fig. 13). As with mobile phones, most participants felt 
that  social  media  helped  them  socialise  with  people 
outside their home (68%), to feel connected (70%), and 
to interact with family and friends (74%). The correla-
tions between the equivalent mobile phone and social 

media  variables  were  0.64  for  socialising  (95%  Confi-
dence  Interval  (CI):  0.54–0.75)  and  0.59  for  connect-
edness (95% CI: 0.49–0.70).

As  with  mobile  phones,  the  next  two  most  endorsed 
statements  were  around  whether  social  media  makes 
participants  compare  themselves  with  others  (endorsed 
by 48%), and whether it makes them happy (endorsed by 
34%). Correlations with the equivalent mobile phone var-
iables were 0.60 for comparisons (95% CI: 0.48–0.71) and 
0.62 (95% CI: 0.51–0.72) for happiness.

Fig. 11  Attitudes towards technology, and perceived effects of mental health on technology use

Participants  did  not  generally  perceive  an  effect  of 
social  media  on  their  mental  health  and  wellbeing,  with 
only  20%  “agreeing”  or  “strongly  agreeing”  that  social 
media was helpful, and 16% “agreeing” or “strongly agree-
ing” that social media was unhelpful. Similarly, regarding 
specific  symptoms,  very  few  participants  endorsed  the 
idea that social media made voices better (13%) or worse 
(10%), and a third or less thought it made them paranoid 

(33%),  or  depressed  or  anxious  (29%).  As  with  mobile 
phones  (correlation  coefficent  0.59;  95%  CI:  0.47–0.70), 
few  participants  (27%)  were  worried  people  would  find 
out about their mental health if they used social media.

Technology ’addiction’

Items adapted from the Internet Addiction Test indicated 
that more than half of participants (57%) stayed online or

Fig. 13  Participants’ beliefs and attitudes about the impact of social media use on socialising, mental health and wellbeing

on  their  mobile  phone  longer  than  intended  frequently, 
often, or always (Fig. 14). Similarly, 53% found themselves 
saying  “just  a  few  more  minutes”  when  online  or  using 
their  phone  frequently  (or  more).  Although  the  impact 
of late night technology use on sleep was less of an issue, 
over  a  third  (38%)  reported  this  happened  frequently 
(or  more).  Only  30%  had  frequently  (or  more)  tried  and 
failed  to  cut  down  the  time  they  spent  online  or  using 
their mobile phone.

Other technology
Digital pills

Slightly  under  half  of  respondents  (43%)  were  “unsure” 
how  helpful  digital  pills  might  be  for  people  with  psy-
chosis  (45%  “helpful”;  12%  “unhelpful”).  Similarly,  45% 
were  “unsure”  whether  they  considered  digital  pills  for 
psychosis to be acceptable (35% “acceptable”; 20% “unac-
ceptable”).  Nevertheless,  40%  would  be  “likely”  or  “very 
likely” to use digital pills if they were offered them, with 

 Eisner et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:726 

Page 14 of 18

22% “unsure” (20% “not at all likely”; 12% “unlikely”; 7% 
not applicable as not taking medication). Of participants 
who might consider using digital pills, most (86%) would 
be willing to authorise at least one other person to track 
their digital pill consumption, with 58% saying this would 
be  their  care  co-ordinator,  44%  their  psychiatrist,  41% 
selected  family  member(s),  30%  their  partner,  26%  their 
psychologist and 14% selected friend(s).

Artificial agents

A quarter of participants (25%) had communicated with 
an  artificial  agent  (e.g.  iPhone  Siri,  Microsoft  Cortana, 
Amazon  Alexa)  about  their  mental  health.  Most  often, 
this  was  to  find  information  about  local  services  (8%), 
followed  by  “To  feel  like  I’ve  spoken  to  someone  about 
how  I  am  feeling”  (6%),  to  find  mental  health  resources 
(5%)  or  other  reasons  (3%).  Of  those  who  had  commu-
nicated  with  an  artificial  agent,  61%  found  the  response 
helpful whereas 33% found it irrelevant and 5% found it 
upsetting.

Discussion
This  paper  describes  findings  from  a  UK-based  survey 
exploring ownership and usage rates of digital technolo-
gies  among  a  self-selecting  sample  of  people  with  psy-
chosis, and barriers, facilitators and willingness to engage 
with services using digital technologies.

Device ownership

As anticipated, device ownership was higher in our sam-
ple  (95%  mobile  phones;  90%  smartphones)  than  previ-
ous  studies  of  people  with  psychosis  (weighted  averages 
across  ten  previous  studies:  82%  mobile  phones;  62% 
smartphones;  [10–18,  23])  or  SMI  more  generally  (87% 
mobile  phone  ownership;  70%  smartphone  ownership; 
[28,  39–47]),  likely  reflecting  the  rapid  increase  in  own-
ership  over  time  and  our  sample’s  relatively  young  age 
(median  26  years).  Supporting  this,  a  recent  general 
population  survey  [48]  reported  100%  mobile  phone 

ownership  and  96%  smartphone  ownership  among  US 
adults  aged  18–29.  The  higher  prevalence  of  Android 
phones  than  iPhones  in  our  sample  is  consistent  with 
most  previous  studies  of  clinical  samples  [28,  40,  44], 
excepting Bell and colleagues’ survey of Australian young 
people [47]. Wearable device ownership rates (21%) were 
comparable  to  recent  reports  from  young  people  with 
other  mental  health  diagnoses  [47],  and  the  propor-
tion  owning  fitness  trackers  (15%)  versus  smartwatches 
(13%) mirrored rates observed in the general population 
approximately two years ago [49].

Taken  in  the  context  of  previous  surveys,  our  find-
ings  suggest  that  overall  device  ownership  has  rapidly 
increased  among  people  with  psychosis,  reflecting  pat-
terns  in  the  general  population.  Yet,  as  others  have 
reported  for  general  mental  health  samples  [45,  47,  50], 
technology  ownership  in  people  with  psychosis  appears 
to lag slightly behind the general population. Socio-eco-
nomic factors may explain this difference. In the general 
population,  device  ownership  rates  tend  to  increase  in 
line  with  salary  and  education  [48].  Given  that  employ-
ment  and  education  rates  are  lower  among  people  with 
schizophrenia  spectrum  psychosis  than  in  the  general 
population  [51–53],  it  follows  that  device  ownership 
might be lower. Indeed, device ownership in our sample 
was significantly lower in unemployed and less educated 
people,  with  device  cost  an  oft-cited  barrier  to  owner-
ship. This said, overall rates of smartphone ownership in 
our  sample  were  high,  implying  considerably  less  digital 
exclusion than has been previously suggested.

Engagement with services using digital technologies

Most  participants  (88%)  would  be  willing  to  try  using 
a  mental  health  app,  which  is  higher  than  the  interest 
reported  in  previous  psychosis  samples  (weighted  aver-
age  62%  interested;  [17–19,  24,  54])  or  more  general 
mental health samples (72% interested; [42, 44, 47]). The 
barriers and facilitators for engagement with digital men-
tal  health  apps  in  our  sample  echoed  those  reported  in 
reviews  of  general  mental  health  apps  (e.g.  forgetting,

confidentiality  [13])  and  digital  tools  for  psychosis  spe-
cifically (e.g. lack of motivation, accessibility [55]).

Attitudes and beliefs about technology

Users’ attitudes and beliefs about technology are crucial 
implementation factors [55]. Overall, participants in our 
sample  said  technology  and  social  media  helped  them 
feel  connected  to  others  and  the  majority  reporting  no 
substantial negative effects. Nevertheless, in response to 
more  detailed  questions,  a  third  said  technology  wors-
ened  their  paranoia,  a  third  increased  their  technology 
use when feeling unwell, and a third used it less at such 
points. Thus,  it  is  important  to  consider  that,  for  a  sub-
group of people with psychosis, the sometimes complex 
interaction  between  technology  use  and  mental  health 
may be a barrier to engagement. Other studies have high-
lighted  this  complexity.  In  examining  the  relationship 
between  social  media  use,  mood  and  paranoia,  Berry 
and colleagues [56] reported that different types of social 
media use (e.g. posting about feelings vs. daily activities) 
had  different  effects  on  mood  and  paranoia.  Similarly, 
in  a  sample  with  bipolar  disorder,  technology  use  was 
related  to  symptoms  and  differed  between  manic  and 
depressive episodes [32].

Although,  as  other  surveys  report  [44],  participants 
only  rarely  used  health  related  apps  at  present,  many 
already  used  other  smartphone  apps  to  help  manage 
their  mental  health  to  some  extent  (e.g.  using  music/
audio to block voices, calendar for appointment remind-
ers,  social  media  for  support).  Regarding  social  media 
use,  people  who  were  female,  of  white/mixed  ethnicity 
and in a relationship posted most, with unemployed peo-
ple and people with a schizophrenia/psychosis diagnosis 
posting  least.  This  echoes  findings  from  a  large,  nation-
ally  representative  US  survey  that  female  gender,  higher 
education, not being divorced/windowed/separated, and 
being  employed  were  associated  with  greater  likelihood 
of posting about health on social media [57]. Around half 
of social media users would like to participate in a social 
media group of others with psychosis. A recent survey of 
Australian young people reported similar levels of inter-
est  for  connecting  with  peers  about  mental  health  via 
social media [47].

Clinical implications and future research

We  found  high  smartphone  ownership  rates  and  high 
interest  in  mental  health  apps,  suggesting  that  smart-
phones are a viable platform for delivering mental health 
support. Since participants tended to access the internet 
using  a  smartphone  or  tablet  more  often  than  a  com-
puter/laptop,  we  recommend  that  mental  health  tools 
are  optimised  for  these  formats.  Participants  generally 
found  the  idea  of  mental  health  professionals  receiving 

information  about  their  symptoms  acceptable,  sup-
porting  the  integration  of  self-reported  mental  health 
data within an individual’s health care record to provide 
opportunities  for  early  detection  of  relapse.  Neverthe-
less,  despite  high  ownership  rates,  42%  of  participants 
endorsed  at  least  one  barrier  to  phone  ownership,  most 
commonly  paranoia  about  phones,  cost,  and  repeatedly 
losing  or  damaging  phone  handsets.  Clinicians  should 
be  mindful  of  these  barriers  when  considering  digital 
tools  as  part  of  the  support  they  provide  to  individuals 
with psychosis, particularly in the context of the current 
cost-of-living  crisis  [58],  which  may  impede  continued 
increases in device ownership [59].

The  fast-paced  rate  of  development  and  innovation 
in the digital mental health field means that researchers 
are  now  exploring  novel  ways  of  providing  time-sensi-
tive  mental  health  support,  such  as  ‘passive  sensing’  via 
smartphones/wearables  [60].  Some  participants  in  our 
study reported that their technology use changed in rela-
tion  to  their  mental  health.  As  others  note  [61],  such 
changes  in  technology  use  may  serve  as  important  bio-
markers for relapse, and could be integrated with further 
digital data to create a “digital phenotype” for relapse pre-
diction,  detection  and  prevention.  Prospective  research 
in large samples is needed to identify specific changes in 
technology  use  (and  other  passively  collected  data)  that 
predict  relapse  with  high  sensitivity  and  specificity  [62]. 
Given  our  finding  that  certain  sub-groups  reported  dia-
metrically opposite changes in technology use when psy-
chotic symptoms were high (a third increased use; a third 
decreased), analyses of such passively collected data must 
take into account variation between individuals.

Only a minority of participants owned a fitness tracker 
or  smartwatch.  Unlike  smartphone-based  digital  health 
tools, it seems unlikely that passive sensing using wear-
ables  would  be  widely  adopted,  at  present,  without  a 
mechanism  to  provide  users  with  such  devices.  Never-
theless,  it  is  likely  that  wearables  will  become  cheaper 
and  more  widely  owned  in  future;  hence,  research  test-
ing  the  potential  value  of  passive  sensing  using  weara-
bles  is  warranted.  As  well  as  large-scale  cohort  studies 
examining  clinical  correlates  of  specific  types  of  pas-
sively  gathered  data  [62],  studies  gathering  detailed 
views  from  stakeholders  will  be  important  to  acceler-
ate  future  implementation  [55].  It  will  be  important  to 
weigh  up  potentially  competing  considerations  such 
as  the  quality  of  data  provided  by  specific  wearables 
(research-grade  devices  provide  the  highest  data  qual-
ity [63]) versus acceptability of the device to people with 
psychosis (consumer grade devices may be most accept-
able  [64]).  Finally,  we  recommend  that  research  studies 
or clinics testing passive sensing using wearable devices 
should  ensure  they  have  a  dedicated  budget  to  provide

wearable  devices  to  participants  to  allow  more  repre-
sentative samples to be included.

Limitations

Additional file 1. Survey.

There  were  some  limitations.  First,  some  participants 
were  recruited  in  the  context  of  taking  part  in  a  digital 
health  trial,  and  others  took  part  in  response  to  online 
advertisements; this self-selected sample may have been 
more familiar, interested and comfortable with using digi-
tal tools than is typical; additionally, those who self-select 
to  take  part  in  research  are  often  more  engaged  with 
services.  Nevertheless,  the  Actissist2  participants  were 
recruited from across Early Intervention Services, inclu-
sion criteria for taking part were intentionally wide, and 
participants were lent a phone to use in the study if they 
did  not  have  one  themselves. The  demographic  makeup 
of the Actissist2 sample was characteristic of a psychosis 
sample recruited from the North West of England. Com-
pared  to  the  online  sample,  the  Actissist2  sample  was 
more male, more ethnically diverse, and more likely to be 
single than the online sample. Second, participants from 
the online sample self-reported their diagnosis. Although 
commonly used as a recruitment strategy, this may mean 
that  some  participants  who  took  part  did  not  meet  full 
diagnostic criteria for a psychosis-related disorder. Third, 
the  survey  closed  in  September  2020.  As  availability  of 
digital  devices  becomes  more  widespread,  and  in  light 
of the Covid-19 pandemic which accelerated digital tool 
use, data presented here might not fully reflect how indi-
viduals  with  psychosis  currently  access  and  use  digital 
tools.  Finally,  the  current  survey  did  not  gather  detailed 
information on the acceptability of newer developments 
such  as  passive  sensing  using  smartphones/wearables. 
Our  research  group  is  currently  gathering  up-to-date 
mixed methods data addressing this question.

Conclusions
We  found  high  mobile  phone  ownership  rates  and 
high  levels  of  interest  in  using  a  mental  health  app. 
Participants  thought  using  an  app  could  increase  their 
understanding of psychosis generally, and of their own 
symptoms. They valued the flexibility of digital tools in 
enabling  access  to  mental  health  support  anytime  and 
anywhere.  Nevertheless,  some  barriers  to  phone  own-
ership  (e.g.  cost,  paranoia)  and  mental  health  app  use 
(e.g.  forgetting,  lack  of  motivation,  security  concerns) 
were reported.
