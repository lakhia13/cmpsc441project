Abstract

Background—Individuals with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) events. This study aimed to assess endothelial function and wave reflection, a risk 
factor for CVD, as measured by finger plethysmography in bipolar disorder to investigate whether 
CVD risk was higher in bipolar disorder and altered during acute mood episodes. We hypothesized 
that that EndoPAT would detect a lower reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and higher augmentation 
index (AIX) in individuals with bipolar disorder compared with controls. Second, we predicted 
lower RHI and higher AIX during acute mood episodes.

Methods—Reactive hyperemia index and augmentation index, measures of microvascular 
endothelial function and arterial pressure wave reflection respectively, were assessed using the 
EndoPAT 2000 device in a sample of 56 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I 
disorder with 82 measures spanning different mood states (mania, depression, euthymia) and 
cross-sectionally in 26 healthy controls.

Results—RHI and AIX were not different between adults with and without bipolar disorder 
(mean age 40.3 vs. 41.2 years; RHI: 2.04 ± 0.67 vs. 2.05 ± 0.51; AIX@75 (AIX adjusted for heart 
rate of 75): 1.4 ± 19.7 vs. 0.8 ± 22.4). When modeled in linear mixed models with a random 
intercept (to account for repeated observations of persons with bipolar disorder) and adjusting for 
age and sex, there were no significant differences between those with bipolar disorder and controls 
(p=0.89 for RHI; p=0.85 for AIX@75).

Conclusions—Microvascular endothelial function and wave reflection estimated by finger 
plethysmography were unable to detect differences between adults with and without bipolar 
disorder or changes with mood states. Future research is necessary to identify more proximal and 
sensitive, yet relevant, biomarkers of abnormal mood-related influences on CVD risk or must 
target higher risk samples.

INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular mortality is known to be one of the leading cause of excess mortality in 
bipolar disorder [1]. Large, contemporary population-based studies suggest an elevated risk 
of cardiovascular disease mortality with estimated standardized mortality ratios ranging 
from 1.6 to 2.7 [2–4]. Traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease such as smoking, 
obesity, inflammation, glucose homeostasis, and diabetes mellitus are more prevalent in the 
population of people with bipolar disorder [5–9]. Overall, adults with bipolar disorder in the 
US population have a 5-fold increased risk of CVD as well as 14 year earlier onset of CVD 
compared to adults without mood disorders [10]. In a nationally representative sample, the 
association between bipolar disorder and vascular disease, at least in women, was found to 
be independent of age, urbanicity, marital status, race, employment, family history of heart 
disease, obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes [11].

In its classic form, bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and 
depression [12]. The individual course of illness can vary considerably with regards to the 
propensity for and persistence of mood episodes [13]. The specific mechanisms by which 
the risk of cardiovascular disease in bipolar disorder have not been fully elucidated [14], 
although there is some evidence that those with a greater symptom burden or a more 
persistent course of illness are at greater relative risk, suggesting that mood symptom burden 
may contribute to risk in a dose-dependent fashion [15–18]. In a meta-analysis of 27 studies 
with 2,161 patients with bipolar disorder and 81,932 controls, CRP levels were moderately 
elevated during episodes of depression and euthymia, and greatly elevated during manic 
episodes [6], suggesting mechanisms beyond traditional risk factors may be involved.

Through the process of deposition of lipids and smooth muscle cells, inflammatory 
infiltration, plaque formation, continued remodeling, and eventual destruction of vessel 
lumen, endothelial dysfunction is a useful marker for poor vascular health [19, 20]. 
Furthermore, chronic endothelial dysfunction may have a shared inflammatory mechanism 
between insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and severe mental disorders that result in 
poor vascular health [7]. To investigate mechanisms by which mood states can influence 
cardiovascular disease events or mortality, intermediate physiological measures reactive 
hyperemia index (RHI) and augmentation index (AIX) were collected as surrogate outcomes

for CVD. There have been no prospective studies of endothelial function across mood 
episodes in bipolar disorder. Two prospective studies in those with depressive episodes have 
demonstrated changes in endothelial function, as measured by finger plethysmography with 
EndoPAT, corresponding to onset of depressive symptoms. The first demonstrated worsening 
endothelial function in adolescent and young adult females who developed depressive 
symptoms, which did not persist when depression resolved [21]. Similarly in a study of 
medical interns, worsening depressive symptoms over follow-up were inversely associated 
with endothelial function [22]. EndoPAT, which measures volumetric changes in the 
fingertip, quantifies microvascular endothelial function with a reactive hyperemia index [23, 
24]. A cuff occludes blood flow through the brachial artery, and nitric oxide-mediated 
vascular dilation results when the cuff is deflated as a result of elevation in blood flow and 
shear stress [23, 25]. Additionally, augmentation index, a value derived from the timing and 
amplitude of pressure wave reflection, is a strong independent risk marker for coronary 
vascular disease in some studies [26]. EndoPAT has several advantages over other methods, 
which include being non-invasive, correlated to multiple traditional risk factors for cardiac 
events, and predictive of cardiovascular events [27, 28].

Previous studies utilizing EndoPAT have identified peripheral endothelial dysfunction in 
patients during depression episodes [21, 22]. This current study is the first to utilize 
EndoPAT to evaluate endothelial function in clinically diagnosed sample with bipolar 
disorder and does so across different mood states. In a sample of individuals with diagnosed 
bipolar disorder and healthy controls, we tested the hypothesis that RHI would be lower and 
AIX adjusted for heart rate of 75 (AIX@75) would be higher in individuals with bipolar I 
disorder compared with controls. In addition, we predicted lower RHI and higher AIX@75 
during acute mood episodes compared with normal mood state.

METHODS

A total of 82 unique volunteers participated in this study, consisting of a group of 56 
participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and a group of 26 healthy control 
participants, balanced by age and sex (Table 1). Community diagnosis was confirmed by a 
semi-structured, one-hour clinical interview by a study psychiatrist (JGF), using a template 
ensured that DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder was met and also specifically screened 
for tobacco, alcohol and drug use/abuse/dependence as well as common comorbidities such 
as psychosis, obsessions, compulsions, and panic attacks. Participants with bipolar I disorder 
were in either a manic episode (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) ≥ 20), a depressive 
episode (Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) > 20), or a euthymic 
state (YMRS ≤ 12 and MADRS < 10) during the assessment. Some participants were 
evaluated repeatedly in different mood states. Healthy control participants had no history of 
psychiatric illness (DSM-IV Axis I or Axis II), confirmed using a telephone screener and the 
semi-structured clinical interview administered by a research assistant. Participants were 
recruited through advertisements, referrals from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics 
(outpatient and inpatient), and a research registry. Controls were recruited through 
advertisements in the same media. The sample was primarily recruited for a neuroimaging 
study in bipolar disorder that prospectively imaged individuals across discrete mood 
episodes, identified by either participants themselves or intermittent compensated research

assistant follow-up calls [29–32]. Exclusion criteria included history of brain damage, 
neurological problems such as seizure disorder, syncope, or migraine with aura, cardiac or 
respiratory diseases, alcohol or drug dependence, amphetamine use, or any contraindication 
to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants provided written informed consent for 
this study, which was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board.

Trained research nurses confirmed that participants fasted for at least 12 hours and had not 
smoked for at least 2 hours prior. They then measured vital signs, height (without shoes to 
nearest 0.1 cm), and weight (without shoes in light clothing to the nearest 0.25 kg). A 
member of the research team then obtained a health and psychiatric history, and 
administered psychiatric rating scales, MADRS and YMRS. Basic assessments of clinical 
and demographic data were acquired. Information regarding cardiovascular risk factors 
including family history, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking history was collected by 
trained health professional.

RHI and AIX, which are measures of microvascular endothelial function and pressure wave 
reflection, respectively were gauged using the EndoPAT 2000 device (Itamar Medical Inc., 
Caesarea, Israel) on study visits between 5/15/2012 and 5/13/2016, during which 87% of 
participants from the imaging study completed EndoPAT assessments. Subjects were 
positioned in a quiet, temperature-regulated room. The subjects were instructed to remain 
still during the measurement period consisting of 5 minutes of baseline measurement, 5 
minutes of occlusion measurement, and 5 minutes of post-occlusion measurement. 
Endothelial function was measured by the reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry 
index. Finger probes comprising of latex air cuffs connected to the inflating device 
controlled through a computer algorithm were placed on the index finger of each subject’s 
hand. A blood pressure cuff on the test arm was inflated to 200 mmHg with increases in 
pressure when necessary to assure occlusion of arterial flow, this confirmed by reduction of 
PAT tracing to zero for five minutes. After the five-minute occlusion, the cuff was deflated 
and the PAT tracing was recorded for at least five more minutes. The ratio of the PAT signal 
after the cuff was released compared to baseline was calculated through computer algorithm 
that normalized the baseline signal and index to the contralateral arm (RHI value). Higher 
RHI values indicate greater dilatation in the finger arteries, which reflects greater nitric-
oxide-mediated vasodilation of these vessels and, thus, better local endothelial function. AIX 
was adjusted for a heart rate of 75 beats/min. Higher AIX@75 values correspond to greater 
pressure wave reflection.

Data analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All statistical 
tests were two-tailed with an α=0.05. We hypothesized there would be a lower RHI value in 
the bipolar disorder group, particularly during abnormal mood states of mania and 
depression. We secondarily assessed differences in arterial pressure wave reflection as 
measured by AIX@75. To account for repeated assessments across mood states for some 
participants, linear mixed models (LMM) included a random intercept for individual 
participant with fixed effects for age (linear, continuous) and sex (dichotomous). Models for 
the full sample assessed for the impact of bipolar disorder (vs. controls) and models 
restricted to those with bipolar disorder assessed mood state, depression or mania with 
euthymia as the reference category. Based on the assumptions of an independent samples t-

test, with 56 cases (without repeated observations) and 26 controls, this sample would have 
80% power to detect an effect size of 0.67 SD at an α=0.05 and only greater power with 
repeated, correlated observations.

RESULTS

The sample included 26 healthy controls and 56 participants with bipolar I disorder with 
sample characteristics as detailed in Table 1. The 56 participants with bipolar I disorder had 
a total of 82 EndoPat measurements, 38 during periods of euthymia, 24 during episodes of 
depression (mean (SD) MADRS 30.6 (5.1)), and 20 during episodes of mania (mean (SD) 
YMRS 25.4 (4.3)). The 26 repeat assessments occurred a mean (SD) of 32 (22) weeks after 
the prior assessment. Those with repeat assessments were more likely to be depressed or 
manic at the first visit (χ2=10.7, df=2, p=0.005).

The mean (SD) RHI for assessments of persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder was 2.04 
± 0.67 and for controls was 2.05 ± 0.51. When modeled in LMM and adjusting for age and 
sex, there were no differences between those with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and 
controls (p=0.89), even after adjusting for age (p=0.78) and sex (p=0.45). In analogous 
models, restricted to those diagnosed bipolar disorder, there were no significant effects of 
mood state (p=0.79). The values for the primary outcome, RHI, by group are illustrated in 
Figure 1.

The mean (SD) AIX@75 was 1.4 ± 19.7 for persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 0.8 
± 22.4 for controls. When modeled in LMM and adjusting for age and sex, categorical 
diagnosis of bipolar disorder was not associated with AIX@75 (p=0.85). Higher AIX@75 
values were seen with increasing age (p<0.0001) and in females (p<0.0001). In analogous 
models restricted to those with bipolar disorder, there were no significant effects of mood 
state (p=0.83).

DISCUSSION

Despite the strong associations between bipolar disorder and cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality, our sample failed to demonstrate significant differences in both RHI and 
AIX@75. We also did not observe any effects of mood on RHI-inferred endothelial function 
by mood state. In contrast, a prior analysis of a sub-sample of this cohort demonstrated 
robust differences across an array of cytokines between abnormal mood states and normal 
mood [31]. This suggests that perhaps measures of small vessel endothelial function, as 
measured by EndoPAT, may not be as sensitive to acute changes in mood.

Per systemic review from Matsuzawa et al. 2015, that pooled six clinical studies including 
1602 participants that examined reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry found that 
0.1 increase in Ln_RHI correlated to a relative risk of 0.79 [0.71–0.87], P<0.001 [33]. 
Furthermore, from a prognostic standpoint: 1 SD increase or decrease is associated with 
approximately half or double the risk of cardiovascular events, respectively [33]. In general, 
there has been found to be an inverse relationship between endothelial function by RHI and 
risk factors known to cause cardiovascular disease (BMI, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking) 
[27]. A value of less than 1.67 is suggestive of endothelial dysfunction per studies of

populations at risk for ischemic heart disease [34, 35]. Official references values are not 
available, but higher values above 2 are a normal response ((Endo-PAT2000 product 
information; Itamar Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel)). When measured by EndoPAT, the 
intraindividual variability in AIX (coefficient of variation 37%) was found to be a less stable 
measure than RHI (coefficient of variation 13%) [36].

The negative results of the current analysis stand in contrast to two prior studies in that 
demonstrated an inverse relationship between changes in depressive symptoms and 
endothelial function [21, 22]. While our current study focuses specifically on bipolar 
disorder, it seems unlikely that measures that can detect the vascular changes associated with 
unipolar depression would not similarly have the sensitivity to detect changes in bipolar 
disorder. The duration of follow-up for the other studies was 1 to 2.5 years [21, 22]. In the 
current analysis, the mean time between repeat assessments across mood states for those 
with bipolar disorder was 32 weeks. These over-estimates the time from the last mood state, 
as the transition may have occurred at any point in between the two assessments. If any 
change in endothelial function related to mood state occurs, it may persist following the 
episode for an unknown period. There is some cross-sectional evidence that the 
inflammatory marker C-reactive protein following depression remains elevated for 1–6 
months following an episode [37]. There is a need for studies to elucidate the time course for 
physiological changes associated with mood episodes.

Residual effects of mood state, however, do not explain the lack of differences between 
those diagnosed with bipolar disorder and controls. A review of prior studies of vascular 
function in bipolar disorder showed detectable association between vascular measures of 
endothelial function and CVD risk factors among adolescents diagnosed with BD. However, 
this study was limited by small sample size, was unable to derive the effects of mood, and 
lacked a control group [38]. Studies that failed to demonstrate an association between 
bipolar disorder and endothelial dysfunction have consisted of younger participants with 
mean age of 32 years and 33 years [39, 40]. Positive studies came from samples of mixed 
mood disorders with an older mean age of 43 to 72 years [41–43]. The mean age of this 
current analysis, although older than prior analyses of bipolar disorder, falls between these 
age ranges. Our sample also excluded those with a history of heart disease and if individuals 
with bipolar disorder are more likely to have cardiovascular disease in this age range may 
have introduced a selection bias toward the null hypothesis.

This analysis represents the largest study of vascular function in bipolar disorder conducted 
to date and one of a few studies of vascular function with a prospective component. 
However, possible limitations of this study include repeat assessments on a minority of the 
sample, the data presented herein remains largely cross-sectional. Endothelial function has 
been primarily studied through flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery as measured by 
high resolution ultrasound and this measure has been prospectively associated with vascular 
outcomes [44]. This technique, however, carries considerable variability within individual 
measures and is sensitive to acute stimuli that alter autonomic nervous system tone [45]. The 
use of a semi-structured rather than a structured interview to confirm diagnosis represents 
another limitation. The availability of other measures of vascular function, such as flow-
mediated dilation, would have been useful in clarifying whether the null result reflected the

lack of differences between groups compared or was due to the surrogate outcome selected. 
Controls were recruited through advertisements, in attempt to overlap as much as possible 
with the secondary study base for recruitment of cases. The secondary study base was likely 
broader than that sampled for controls, which may subsequently not have been fully 
representative of the population from which the cases arose [46].

The EndoPAT evaluates peripheral arterial tone through measurements of plethysmographic 
pressure changes caused by arterial pulses. The changes in vascular tone after occlusion of 
the brachial artery reflect the magnitude of an endothelial mediated hyperemic response, 
which is a measurement of arterial endothelial function [36]. However, this may be 
unsuitable to detect early vascular changes. Although previous studies have demonstrated 
alterations in reactive hyperemia to be sensitive to changes with mood [21, 22], those studies 
were prospective and over a long duration, while the current analysis had a relatively short 
time frame between prospective assessments, when even available. Reproducibility of this 
measure in those with known coronary artery disease is moderate and suboptimal 
reproducibility could also negatively impact sensitivity to change with mood [47]. Future 
prospective studies investigating changes in vascular function in bipolar disorder should 
include adequate duration and enroll older adults or those who have had a longer course of 
affective illness. This sample was recruited from a single academic medical center and may 
not be generalizable.

Given the substantive risk conveyed mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, in the 
development of cardiovascular disease, there is great need to understand the most relevant 
mechanisms by which risk is mediated [48]. Considering the present findings and the 
existing literature, the use of measures of endothelial function to distinguish risk related to 
mood states appear to require longer term follow-up (years). The cumulative effects of 
symptom burden are more likely to be identified in those later in life and in proportion to 
lifetime symptom burden. Future studies informed by these design considerations are needed 
to understand how mood episodes influence cardiovascular risk.
