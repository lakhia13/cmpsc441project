CURRENTOPINION Review of the burden of eating disorders: mortality,

disability, costs, quality of life, and family burden

Daphne van Hoekena and Hans W. Hoeka,b,c

Purpose of review
To review the recent literature on the burden of eating disorders in terms of mortality, disability, quality of
life, economic cost, and family burden, compared with people without an eating disorder.

Recent findings
Estimates are that yearly over 3.3 million healthy life years worldwide are lost because of eating disorders.
In contrast to other mental disorders, in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa years lived with disability
(YLDs) have increased. Despite treatment advances, mortality rates of anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa remain very high: those who have received inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa still have a
more than five times increased mortality risk. Mortality risks for bulimia nervosa, and for anorexia nervosa
treated outside the hospital, are lower but still about twice those of controls. In people with an eating
disorder, quality of life is reduced, yearly healthcare costs are 48% higher than in the general population,
the presence of mental health comorbidity is associated with 48% lower yearly earnings, the number of
offspring is reduced, and risks for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are increased.

Summary
People with a current or former eating disorder are at risk of increased mortality, high YLD rates, a reduced
quality of life, increased costs, and problems with childbearing.

INTRODUCTION
’Eating disorders are disabling, deadly, and costly
mental disorders that considerably impair physical
health and disrupt psychosocial functioning’, as Trea-
sure et al. [1] state. This makes effective treatments the
more important. For bulimia nervosa [2,3] and binge
eating disorder (BED) [4], there are effective psycho-
logical treatments, especially cognitive behaviour
therapy (CBT). However, for anorexia nervosa, a recent
meta-analysis could not establish its efficacy over an
active control condition [5]. For the most severe and
enduring cases of anorexia nervosa, there is a paucity
of evidence-based treatments [6].

The efficacy of treatment (or lack thereof) is
reflected in illness duration and remission rates. A
series of publications on very long-term (10–20
years) follow-up studies of inpatients with an eating
disorder showed that, respectively 64% of persons
previously diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, 53% of
those previously diagnosed with bulimia nervosa,
and 30% of those previously diagnosed with BED,
still met diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder at
follow-up; a further 6% for anorexia nervosa, 9% for
bulimia nervosa and 31% for BED had remaining

eating disorder symptoms [7,8&&,9]. Higher recovery
rates of anorexia nervosa were reported in two
smaller long-term ((cid:2)20 years) follow-up studies of
adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa; one on an out-
patient sample [10], the other on a community
sample [11&&]. In both studies, around 65% of the
cases were in complete remission at follow-up. Thus,
across eating disorders, a considerable 62–70% of
people who had received inpatient treatment and

KEY POINTS

(cid:3) The mortality risk for people followed up after inpatient
treatment for anorexia nervosa is over five times higher
than for age-matched and gender-matched people in
the general population

(cid:3) In people followed up after treatment for bulimia

nervosa, or after outpatient treatment for anorexia
nervosa, the mortality risk is around two times that in
the general population.

(cid:3) Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and BED have

substantial negative consequences for the number of
years lived in good health (delayed recovery, and
persistence of partial/full eating disorder pathology)
and for quality of life.

(cid:3) Yearly costs for healthcare use are almost 50% higher
for patients with an eating disorder compared with
noneating disorder controls.

(cid:3) Eating disorders carry risks for fertility and health risks

in pregnancy and newborns.

35% who had received outpatient treatment, still
met full diagnostic criteria or had remaining eating
disorder symptoms at long-term follow-up.

Protracted eating disorder pathology means that
eating disorders have a great impact on the present
and future health and quality of life of affected per-
sons, their caregivers and society. In this journal in
2016, Erskine et al. [12] described the inclusion of
eating disorders in the Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) study in 2010 as a watershed in the recognition
of these disorders in the wider global health commu-
nity, and presented findings on the burden of eating
disorders from the GBD 2013 database. Here we
review current GBD data on eating disorders. Further-
more, we widen the scope of burden to address some
of the limitations of the GBD concept of burden as
‘within-the-skin’ health loss: as Erskine et al. [12]
noted, the impact of eating disorders on families
and other support systems is neither reflected in
the GBD burden estimates nor do they represent
the future adverse impact of an eating disorder on
an individual’s psychological and economic well
being. And as only anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa have so far been included for burden quan-
tification, the GBD data only pertain to a subset of
eating disorders. This review addresses eating disor-
der-related mortality, disability, economic cost, and
other individual, caregiver and family burden.

METHODS
This review is based on a literature search using Med-
line and Pre-Medline, Medline Epub ahead of print

and in-process and other nonindexed citations,
and Embase psychiatry resources (via OvidSP), using
several key terms relating to eating disorders and
burden (terms on request available from the first
author). We supplemented the results with Google
Scholar searches for specific combinations of terms.
The search was conducted up to 8 May 2020. We
limited the search to publications in English from
2018 onwards and to studies reporting on formal
eating disorder diagnoses [anorexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, BED, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake
Disorder (ARFID)]. The titles and abstracts of 1234
unique listings were screened by the first author for
relevance. Studies in which eating disorders were
comorbid with other health conditions (e.g. diabetes)
were excluded, as well as studies on fewer than 25
subjects. In order to put information in perspective,
we focussed on studies that used population-based
metrics or that compared people with an eating
disorder to noneating disorder controls.

GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE STUDY
A major global effort to gather, combine, and compare
information on the burden associated with a large
range of disorders, both somatic and mental, is the
ongoing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which
started in 1990. Information is regularly updated
and available online through the Global Health
Data Exchange (GHDx) site of the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation (Seattle, Washington, USA):
http://ghdx.healthdata.org/. Anorexia nervosa and
bulimia nervosa have been included since the GBD
2010 study.

The burden of disease is defined as the gap
between current health status and an ideal situation
in which everyone lives into old age free of disease
and disability. Causes of the gap are premature
mortality, disability, and exposure to certain risk
factors that contribute to illness. An important met-
ric to express this gap is the disability-adjusted life
year (DALY). One DALY expresses one lost year of
‘healthy’ life. The burden of a disease is the sum of
DALYs for this specific disease across a population.
DALYs are calculated as the sum of the years of life
lost (YLL) because of premature mortality and the
years lost due to disability (YLD), thus incorporating
both mortality and morbidity information. Using
DALYs, the burdens of various diseases can be com-
pared, from those that cause premature death but
little disability to those that cause disability but
not death.

For mental health disorders, YLD are the main
contributors towards DALYs. Table 1 shows the GBD
2017 data on YLD for eating disorders, all mental
disorders (substance use disorders not included), all

noncommunicable diseases (of which mental disor-
ders are part), and all causes [13&,14].

It was estimated that in 2017, worldwide over
3.3 million healthy life years were lost to eating
disorder-related disability, amounting to an age-
standardized YLD rate of 9.4 for anorexia nervosa,
and 33.8 for bulimia nervosa, per 100 000 popula-
tion. YLD rates for eating disorders contributed 2.8%
to the overall YLD load of mental disorders. Whereas
from 2007 to 2017, YLD rates remained constant or
decreased slightly for all causes, noncommunicable
diseases, and mental disorders overall, for anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa these rates increased
by 6 and 10%, respectively.

Challenges to the estimation of eating disorder
burden were noted by Erskine et al. [12] in 2016, for
instance that ‘the representativeness of the available
eating disorder prevalence data, measured as ‘cover-
age’, is poor’ where ‘no or limited data results in
large uncertainty intervals around prevalence esti-
mates and subsequently burden estimates’, and
these still hold. Thus, GBD data on eating disorders
and other mental health disorders must be inter-
preted with caution.

In the following two sections we look into the
basic parameters for burden of disease, mortality
and disability, in persons with an eating disorder as
compared with persons without an eating disorder.

Mortality
Studies are reviewed that have been published since
the review by Smink et al. [15] in 2013 in this
journal, and which report mortality rates for eating
disorder relative to a reference population: either an
age-matched and sex-matched control group (death
hazard ratio), or relative to expected death rates in

the age-matched and sex-matched general popula-
tion as a whole (standardized mortality ratio: SMR)
or in the subset of the general population that has
no eating disorder (mortality rate ratio: MRR).
Another commonly used measure of mortality,
the crude mortality rate (CMR), represents the rate
of mortality within the study population (e.g. eating
disorder) over a specified period. As it does not allow
for comparison across study populations like the
age-matched and sex-matched controlled studies
do, it is not reviewed here.

In users of secondary mental healthcare services
an SMR of 5.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8–
7.0) was reported for anorexia nervosa and atypical
anorexia nervosa according to ICD-10 criteria [16].
Also using ICD-10 criteria, Suokas et al. found
a hazard ratio of 6.5 (95% CI: 3.5–12.3)
for
people with anorexia nerv-osa and atypical anorexia
nervosa treated in tertiary care [17]. These rates were
comparable to the SMR for anorexia nervosa of
5.9 (95% CI 4.2–8.3) calculated in a landmark
meta-analysis of worldwide eating disorder mortal-
ity rates published in 2011 [18], but higher than the
relative risk of 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1–2.3) for mortality
of mental disorders versus controls, pooled over
148 studies [19].

One recent study, linking data from primary and
secondary care, reported mortality rates for anorexia
nervosa comparable to the mortality risk pooled for
various mental disorders [20&&]: the HR for anorexia
nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa (diagnosed
according to ICD-10 or Read Version 2 primary care
diagnostic criteria) was 2.3 (95% CI 1.9–2.8); both
genders combined. Female patients had the highest
hazard ratio 2.5 (95% CI 2.1–3.1). The majority of
the patients had not been referred to a hospital, and
thus the eating disorders may on average have been

less severe than those in previous studies, which
included cases identified mainly through hospital
records or eating disorder treatment facilities. In the
same study, a hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI 1.1–1.8)
was reported for bulimia nervosa and atypical
bulimia nervosa, diagnosed according to ICD-10
criteria [20&&]. This rate is similar to the SMR of
1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.0) of DSM-IV defined bulimia
nervosa reported by Fichter and Quadflieg [21]
and the SMR of 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.6) in the meta-
analysis by Arcelus et al. [18].

In their review, Smink et al. identified one study
that reported an SMR for BED of 2.3 (95% CI 0.0–
5.5) [9]. Since then, two follow-up studies have
reported relative mortality rates for BED: in Finnish
inpatients the hazard ratio was 1.8 (95% CI 0.6–5.3)
[17], and in German inpatients, the SMR was 1.5
(0.9–2.4) [21]. None of the mortality rates for BED
were significantly higher than in controls.

For the combined category of anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, and other eating disorders (ICD-10
code F50), in a study linking data from the Danish
Psychiatric Central Research Register (containing
information on inpatient treatment and outpatient
and emergency room visits) with the Danish Regis-
ter of Causes of Death, an overall MRR of 2.9 (95% CI
2.6–3.1) was reported [22&].

Finally, in one male-only, 30-year follow-up
study of inpatients, SMRs were 5.9 (95% CI 3.6–
9.2) for anorexia nervosa, 1.9 (95% CI 0.9–3.6) for
bulimia nervosa, and 3.4 (95% CI 1.4–7.0) for
EDNOS; all diagnoses according to DSM-IV [23].
These results are largely in line with previous studies
reporting mortality in male patients with an
eating disorder.

Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a
framework for measuring functioning and disability
in relation to health conditions [25]. The WHO
Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) is
the associated measuring instrument and looks into
psychosocial activities and participation. In DSM-5,
the WHODAS 2.0 has been put forward to replace
the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale
used in DSM-IV [26]. The original version is patient-
based. However, for patients with severe mental
illness who lack insight into their health problems,
Koopmans et al. [27]. advocated the use of the proxy
version by a caregiver or well informed health pro-
fessional.

Despite the fact that DSM-5 has been introduced
in 2013, the WHODAS 2.0 has not so far been widely
adopted in mental health research and practice.
Although Edlund et al. [28] indicated that eating
disorders ‘might be highly disabling’,
in their
nationally representative population surveys using
the WHODAS 2.0, the authors did not include eat-
ing disorders because of their relatively low preva-
lence. The two studies that did assess a patient-
reported version of the WHODAS in patients with
an eating disorder either did not have a noneating
disorder control group [29] or did not report sepa-
rately on patients with an eating disorder [30]. As
yet, no study has used the proxy version of the
WHODAS 2.0 in people with an eating disorder.
For anorexia nervosa, in particular, the proxy infor-
mation may be warranted, as patients with anorexia
nervosa often deny that they are ill. Furthermore,
parents are an important source of information on
children and adolescents, as anorexia nervosa shows
a peak incidence between 12 and 19 years old [31].

Disability and functioning
Erskine et al. [12] extended the GBD context for
disability from time lived with loss of health to a
broader concept capturing deficits in other areas and
the impact on caregivers and the community. This
was reflected in disability weights derived from pop-
ulation surveys where respondents make pairwise
comparisons of health conditions as to which of
the two they consider the most ‘unhealthy’. On a
scale of 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death), disability
weights for anorexia nervosa were calculated at
0.224 and for bulimia nervosa at 0.223. These are
worse (higher weights) than, for example, for chronic
state kidney disease (0.104) or severe heart failure
(0.179), but better than for schizophrenia (0.778),
which had the highest disability weight among 301
acute and chronic diseases and injuries [24].

Disability and functioning are two sides of the
same coin. The WHO International Classification of

Quality of life
A report commissioned by a UK national charity
indicated that, according to both patients with an
eating disorder and their caregivers, eating disorders
had a significant impact on patients’ participation
and productivity at education and work, overall well
being, and quality of life, and on social and family
life for both patients and their caregivers [32].

Several recent studies have reported problems in
quality of life for current and former patients with
an eating disorder. A general population cohort
study in the USA revealed that those with a lifetime
history of eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, BED, and other eating disorder diagnoses
combined) had a significantly lower quality of life
(as measured with the EQ-5D-5L) than noneating
disorder controls [33]. In a review of residual eating
disorder symptoms and clinical features in patients
who were in remission or had recovered, Tomba

et al. [34&] reported that former eating disorder
patients had a significantly lower quality of life
and reduced capabilities in several areas of social
functioning compared with noneating disorder con-
trols, and that psychological well being did not
improve up to the level of healthy controls. De
Vos et al. [35] reported that patients with anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, BED or Other Specified
Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED) had signifi-
cantly worse scores than the general population on
overall, emotional and psychological well being;
social well being was significantly lower only for
patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
They also looked at ‘the other side’ of the spectrum
of mental health states and found that some of
those with an eating disorder reported they were
flourishing; ranging from 9.3% (anorexia nervosa)
to 24.6% (BED) compared with 36.8% in the general
population.

Comorbidity is common in eating disorders and
may increase the burden of disease. A 2019 review in
this journal by Rijkers et al. [36] indicated that the
prevalence of PTSS in eating disorders ranged from 9
to 24%. Patients with an eating disorder (n ¼ 6560)
were reported to experience higher levels of person-
ality disorders (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 10.8; 95% CI 6.6–
18.6), alcohol dependence syndrome (OR ¼ 6.0, 95%
CI 3.9–9.4), and depressive disorders (OR ¼ 5.9; 95%
CI 4.8–7.4) than a group of age-matched and sex-
matched controls [20&&]. The impact of eating
disorders on well being may already be visible in
health service use data prior to diagnosis as indicated
by increased general practitioner prescriptions for
in
central nervous
the 2 years before the diagnosis of an eating
disorder [20&&].

system and dietetic drugs

Economic cost
Another way to look at illness burden is to consider
the costs to the individual and to society. In 2005,
Simon et al. [37] reviewed the health service use and
cost of patients with an eating disorder. They con-
cluded that much less was known about this topic
in eating disorders than in many other mental
disorders. This was still found to be the case as
recently as 2019 [38]. Mental illnesses, in general,
reduce the chances of completing school, getting
and keeping a full-time job, and earning high
wages [38]. The long-term costs of an illness may
be higher when the peak age at incidence is rela-
tively low and chronicity is high, such as in eating
disorders.

Disease costs of eating disorder involve treat-
ment costs, and direct financial burden and loss of
earnings for both patients and caregivers. The BEAT

report calculated direct yearly costs of eating disor-
ders in Wales at £1500 for patients and £2800 for
caregivers, and the average costs for treatment per
patient at £8850 per year [32]. Yearly costs of time
off work and education were found to be £650 for
patients with an eating disorder under 20 years old,
£9500 for those over the age of 20, and £5950 for
caregivers. The loss of earnings was reported to
extend beyond the average treatment period of 6
years. How these costs related to healthcare costs for
people without an eating disorder was not assessed.
A review by Agh et al. [39] analysed 17 studies
reporting healthcare costs of eating disorders; none
of these compared costs with those of noneating
disorder controls. Samnaliev et al. [40] reported that
people with an eating disorder in the USA had yearly
healthcare costs that were on average 48% higher
than in the general population, and that within
those with an eating disorder who were employed,
the presence of mental health comorbidity was
associated with an almost 50% reduction of yearly
earnings. Another study found that healthcare use
and associated costs in the year prior to a diagnosis
of BED were already higher than for controls [41].

Family burden
Finally, eating disorders may not only impact the
person with an eating disorder, but also affect rela-
tives, in particular caregivers (parents) and offspring
as well. There are very few studies that address care-
giver’s burden in eating disorders, let alone compare
these to other health conditions or noneating
disorder controls. A comparison by Martı´n et al.
between caregivers of patients with an eating disor-
der, with depression or with schizophrenia, indi-
cated that the caregiver’s burden (worrying, tension,
urging) was higher for carers of patients with an
eating disorder [42]. In a study on anorexia nervosa,
negative perceptions of
the consequences of
anorexia nervosa for young people also negatively
regardless of
impacted the caregiver’s burden,
anorexia nervosa symptom severity [43].

In a small-scale longitudinal study, Martini et al.
[44] found that at 6 months postpartum, mothers
with current and past eating disorder reported
higher concerns about their child being or becom-
ing overweight, and were less aware of hunger and
satiety cues in their child, compared with healthy
controls. A systematic literature review of studies
comparing mothers with and without an eating
disorder and their children revealed a range of differ-
ences that indicate an impact of maternal eating
disorder on the child’s psychological, cognitive,
and eating development, such as more behavioural
difficulties regarding feeding and eating, more

Eating disorders

socioemotional difficulties, and possibly an increased
risk for the development of eating disorder in the
child [45]. Reports of children’s difficulties by moth-
ers with an eating disorder may be biased and need to
be considered with caution.

In women from Utah, USA, with a previous
eating disorder, age at first birth (anorexia nervosa:
26.4 years; bulimia nervosa: 25.7 years; EDNOS 25.6
years) was significantly higher than in matched
controls from the general population (24.1 years)
[46]. Taking marital status into consideration, fertil-
ity rates for anorexia nervosa were 18%, for bulimia
nervosa 23.3%, and for EDNOS 18.6%, compared
with 48.3% in age-matched general population con-
trols. This indicates that women with an eating
disorder history may experience delay or disruption
of their reproduction because of their previous eat-
ing disorder. In Sweden, a large birth register study
revealed increased risks for adverse pregnancy and
neonatal outcomes, such as preterm birth and
microcephaly, both for women with a current eating
disorder as well as those with an eating disorder in
remission [47&].

CONCLUSION
Long-term studies showed considerable rates of per-
sisting eating disorder pathology. This protracted
eating disorder pathology means that worldwide,
each year an estimated 3.3 million healthy person-
years are lost to disability. Also, anorexia nervosa
and bulimia nervosa are accompanied by signifi-
cantly increased mortality rates. Patients with
anorexia nervosa who have received inpatient treat-
ment have higher rates than average for mental
disorders. Eating disorders also negatively affect
years lived with disability, the individual’s quality
of life, economic costs for patients and their care-
givers, and childbearing and parenting. Only a few
studies compare disease burden between people
with and without an eating disorder, or use stan-
dardized rates for relevant data. Further eating dis-
order research is needed on patients’ functioning as
measured with the WHODAS 2.0 introduced by
DSM-5.
