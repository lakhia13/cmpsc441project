Abstract
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment for adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD). Exist-
ing evidence on the efficacy of TMS in adolescent MDD awaits quantitative synthesis. A systematic literature search was 
conducted, and data from eligible studies were synthesized using random-effects models. Treatment-covariate interactions 
were examined in exploratory analyses of individual-patient data (IPD). Systematic search of the literature yielded 1264 hits, 
of which 10 individual studies (2 randomized trials) were included for quantitative synthesis of mainly uncontrolled studies. 
Individual patient data (IPD) were available from five trials (all uncontrolled studies). Quantitative synthesis of aggregated 
data revealed a statistically significant negative overall standardized mean change (pooled SMCC = 2.04, 95% CI [1.46; 
2.61], SE = 0.29, p < .001), as well as a significant overall treatment response rate (Transformed Proportion = 41.30%, 95% 
CI [31.03; 51.57], SE = 0.05; p < 0.001), considering data from baseline to post-treatment. Exploratory IPD analyses sug-
gests TMS might be more effective in younger individuals and individuals with more severe depression, and efficacy might 
be enhanced with certain treatment modality settings, including higher number of TMS sessions, longer treatment durations, 
and unilateral and not bilateral stimulation. Existing studies exhibit methodological shortcomings, including small-study 
effects and lack of control group, blinding, and randomization—compromising the credibility of the present results. To date, 
two randomized controlled trials on TMS in adolescent depression have been published, and the only large-scale randomized 
trial suggests TMS is not more effective than sham stimulation. Future large-scale, randomized, and sham-controlled trials 
are warranted. Future trials should ensure appropriate selection of patients for TMS treatment and guide precision medicine 
approaches for stimulation protocols.

Introduction

Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) presents a 
serious and oftentimes life-threatening disorder, with the 
potential to disrupt normal development, and to impede 
the quality of life of affected individuals and their fami-
lies [1, 2]. It has been recognized that MDD is a leading 
contributor to the burden of disease in young individu-
als aged 10–24 years [3], yet, currently available options 
for the treatment of MDD in adolescents remain unsat-
isfactory.  In  the  past  2  decades,  pharmacological  and 
psychological interventions have been widely used in the 
treatment of MDD in adolescents. Compared to other psy-
chiatric disorders in young individuals, such as anxiety, 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or conduct-related 
problems and disorders, mean effects for the treatment of 
MDD are, however, modest [4]. Antidepressants, except 
for fluoxetine, may not offer a clear advantage over placebo 
for a large percentage of individuals [5, 6]. Of concern, 
one-third  of  MDD  patients  who  undergo  treatment  do 
not achieve remission after having gone through various 
treatment options, which can lead to treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD; [7–9]).

Increasingly, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
has been used to both study and treat neuropsychiatric and 
neurological disorders. TMS is a technique employed for 
transcranial stimulation of the brain using a magnetic coil 
positioned on the surface of the head usually tangential 
to the scalp, and is based on the principle of electromag-
netic induction [10]. A brief, high-current pulse is pro-
duced in the magnetic coil, resulting in a magnetic field, 
passing perpendicularly to the plane of the magnetic coil, 
inducing an electric field perpendicularly to the magnetic 
field on the surface of the cortex, depolarizing neurons 
or their axons [11, 12]. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) involves 
modalities to deliver multiple pulses of stimulation in a 
short interval of time and at various stimulation frequen-
cies (e.g., 1, 5, or 10 Hz). As compared to single-pulse 
or paired-pulse TMS protocols, rTMS produces longer-
lasting changes in neural activity [13] and is most com-
monly used in clinical settings. rTMS has been suggested 
to modulate brain network functioning [14,  15]. Theta 
burst stimulation (TBS) involves the application of 50 Hz 
bursts at theta (5 Hz) frequency. This patterned stimula-
tion can deliver a high number of pulses and is thought 
to confer neurophysiological and therapeutic effects in a 
shorter time as compared to standard TMS (i.e., in about 
40 s to 3 min compared to about 30 min in, e.g., 10 Hz 
rTMS [16, 17]). The intensity of TMS is generally deter-
mined relative to the resting motor threshold (RMT) of 
the individual patient. RMT is assessed via the primary 
motor cortex and serves as a proxy for the activation of 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:1501–1525

other cortical regions [18, 19]. Typically, TMS is applied 
with intensities ranging from 80 to 120% of RMT, and the 
efficacy of stimulation (besides the state of the receiving 
brain) generally strongly depends on the stimulation pro-
tocol (i.e., dose) [20, 21]. Magnetic stimulators equipped 
with figure-eight coils have obtained regulatory approval 
for  clinical  use  in  many  countries,  and  are  most  com-
monly used in clinical therapeutic settings. Figure-eight 
coils induce electric fields in the target area with greater 
focality compared to coil types shaped differently (i.e., 
concentric coils), also minimizing the potential risk of side 
effects caused by stimulation of surrounding areas (for a 
discussion of geometric variations of figure-eight coils and 
implications for therapeutic use, see, e.g., [22]).

In 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) cleared the first TMS device for therapeutic clinical 
use in adult MDD [23, 24]. To date, multiple meta-analyses 
have demonstrated that TMS applied to the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (DLPFC) is effective, specifically for cases 
of TRD [25–27]. In a number of existing reviews, TMS has 
also been ascribed potential as a safe and effective treat-
ment for MDD in adolescents [28–32]. However, findings 
thus far have been mixed, and quantitative syntheses are cur-
rently lacking on TMS in adolescent MDD. Thus, it remains 
unclear under what conditions and to what extent TMS is 
effective for the treatment of MDD in youth.

During the neurodevelopmental period of adolescence, 
aberrations from normative neuro-maturational processes 
potentially  underlie  the  pathophysiology  of  depression 
[33]. Specifically, drastic changes in structural and func-
tional brain architecture may lead to imbalances in excita-
tion and inhibition, changes in cortical plasticity and con-
nectivity, and less effective information exchange between 
brain regions that are critical to the processing of emotion 
[34–36]. Of note, it has been suggested previously that neu-
rodevelopmental processes in adolescence might contribute 
to the currently inconsistent results between studies investi-
gating rTMS in adolescent MDD [37].

A range of further patient-related factors are likely to 
influence how rTMS is received and processed in the brains 
of adolescents and adults alike, and in turn, the influence of 
individual-patient factors on TMS treatment outcome needs 
to be investigated in adolescent samples. Of note, meta-ana-
lytic evidence in adults suggests age to present one of the 
most important predictors of TMS treatment response, with 
young age presenting a good prognostic factor [38–40]—
which is also in line with psychotherapeutic and psychophar-
macological treatment studies in children and adolescents, 
suggesting younger patients to be more likely to respond to 
treatment [41, 42]. Besides patient demographics, stimula-
tion-parameter settings are likely to influence effect size. 
In a previous meta-analysis of adult patients, stimulation 
intensity, frequency, and site of stimulation, as well as the 

1 3 
European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:1501–1525 

1503

course of treatment, were identified as moderators of the 
treatment outcome [43]. Furthermore, the efficacy of TMS 
might strongly depend on accurate targeting of the region to 
be stimulated, while localization of the cortical target region 
currently lacks standardization. In many, and particularly in 
earlier studies, the DLPFC as a target site has been approxi-
mated from measurements on the scalp, using the so-called 
“5-cm rule” involving measurement to a location about 5 cm 
anterior to the Motor Threshold location in the anterior–pos-
terior plane [44, 45]. A further scalp-based targeting method 
that has found wide application is the Beam F3 method, 
which additionally accounts for head size and shape [46]. 
More recently, studies have started to use structural or func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) combined with neuro-navigation sys-
tems to target specific regions of interest [47–49]. Critically, 
targeting of specific brain regions by imaging and neuro-
navigation seems to result in larger effect sizes as compared 
to scalp-based approaches [49–51].

Especially  in  more  recent  years,  consensus  has  been 
reached that TMS might be a valuable treatment option 
for MDD in youth. This same conclusion has been drawn 
repeatedly from a number of existing systematic literature 
reviews on the topic ([28–32, 37, 52]), two of which [31, 
52] also include a systematic assessment of study quality 
and risk of bias, respectively. Crucially, among the cur-
rently existing studies examining efficacy of TMS treatment 
in adolescent depression, there are only two randomized, 
double-blind sham-controlled trials [53,  54]—and, what 
is more, the largest and as of yet best-designed study [54] 
found no additive effect of rTMS compared to sham stimu-
lation considering the reduction of depressive symptoms 
in adolescents. Most probably based on the current lack of 
large-scale, high-quality, randomized studies, a quantitative 
synthesis of the existing evidence on the efficacy of TMS 
treatment in adolescent MDD is lacking from the literature, 
and potential moderators of treatment outcome have not yet 
been meta-analytically examined.

Thus, to tackle these respective gaps, the current system-
atic review and meta-analysis aims to first summarize the 
currently existing data on efficacy (defined as pre- to post-
treatment change and response rate) of TMS treatment in 
adolescent MDD on a study level, and second, in exploratory 
analyses on the level of individual-patient data (IPD), to 
examine patient- and treatment-related factors which poten-
tially influence the efficacy of TMS in adolescent MDD.

Methods

The present study protocol was pre-registered through a 
web-based protocol on the International Prospective Register 
of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; e.g., [55]), available 

from https:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/ prosp ero/ displ ay_ record.  
php? ID= CRD42 02021 0008. Updates to the current review 
will be posted to the protocol. Throughout the meta-analytic 
process, we followed the current recommendations from 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses statements (PRISMA; PRISMA-IPD; [56, 
57]), and consulted the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
Reviews of Interventions providing gold-standard advice in 
conducting systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare 
interventions [58].

Search strategy

For the identification of studies investigating TMS in adoles-
cent depression, a systematic search was conducted, drawing 
on the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and Web 
of Science with the search terms (TMS OR transcranial 
magnetic stimul* OR TBS OR theta burst stimul*) AND 
(child* OR teen* OR adolescen* OR kid* OR juvenile* OR 
pediatric OR early onset OR early-onset OR youth) AND 
(depress* OR MDD OR mood OR affect* OR dysthym*). 
Publications up to 30 October 2020 were included in the 
search. In addition, we searched the bibliographies of pub-
lished reviews on TMS treatment in adolescent depression 
[29–59]. A systematic search of the clinical trial registers 
of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (ClinicTrials.gov) 
and the World Health Organization (International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform) was conducted to identify poten-
tial unpublished trials. The authors of primary studies were 
contacted to obtain unpublished data.

Study selection

Article screening was performed using the Rayyan screen-
ing software [60], which allowed transparent documenta-
tion on decisions concerning included and excluded stud-
ies. Any uncertainty over the eligibility of particular studies 
was resolved through discussion of the review authors until 
agreement was reached. Based on titles and abstracts screen-
ing, studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) 
studies investigating TMS or TBS treatment in (2) adoles-
cent samples with a mean age range of 12–21 years (3) with 
a clinical diagnosis of depression, (4) written in English or 
German language. We endorsed no restrictions on the study 
design and included controlled or uncontrolled multi-subject 
trials as well as case reports. Of note, we included any study 
irrespective of statistical significance of reported treatment 
effects (i.e., no selection criteria were applied with regard to 
statistical significance of study results). We included jour-
nal articles, conference abstracts and letters to the editor. 
Studies were excluded if they met the following criteria: 
(1) studies investigating non-human subjects (e.g., rats or 
mice), (2) studies only investigating adults, (3) studies using 

1 31504

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:1501–1525

neuro-stimulation techniques different from TMS or TBS 
(e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation or electrocon-
vulsive therapy), (4) studies investigating clinical diagnoses 
other than depression (e.g., epilepsy, cerebral palsy, schizo-
phrenia, autism, Tourette syndrome, and attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder), and (5) studies where the severity 
of depressive symptoms had not been assessed using stand-
ardized measures. In addition, published study protocols and 
clinical trial registrations—not reporting empirical data—
were excluded from further synthesis.

Primary and secondary outcome measures

Our primary aim was to synthesize existing evidence on the 
efficacy of TMS in adolescent depression and to identify, in 
an exploratory approach, respective moderators on both the 
study and individual-patient levels. Based on the population 
of primary studies available, efficacy, on the study level, 
was defined as standardized mean change (SMCC) between 
pre- and post-treatment assessments, considering the sever-
ity of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we considered 
response rate, measured as the raw percentage of responders 
at treatment termination, as a secondary outcome measure 
of efficacy. Response rate was defined as the percentage of 
individuals within a study sample in which a reduction of at 
least 50% in depressive symptoms from baseline to treatment 
termination was observed. At the level of individual patients, 
we examined patient- and treatment-level characteristics as 
potential moderators of pre- to post-treatment change as well 
as treatment response (as described in further detail in sta-
tistical analysis below).

Data extraction and preparation 

To obtain aggregated data on the study level, the following 
information was systematically extracted from each included 
study in tabular format: (1) authors, publication year, title, 
and name of the journal where the study had been published, 
(2) aims and objectives of the study, (3) study design, (4) 
sample characteristics (e.g., sample size, sex distribution of 
the sample, mean age and age range, diagnosis, any other 
relevant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics), (5) 
methodological aspects (e.g., treatment realization, measure-
ment of variables, and conduction of analysis), (6) stimula-
tion protocol (i.e., coil location, number of TMS sessions, 
number of pulses per session, session duration, TMS fre-
quency and intensity, (7) main outcomes (i.e., depression 
severity and response rates), (8) additional outcomes (i.e., 
adverse events), and (9) potential strengths of the study and 
its limitations. Missingness was recorded, and following 
data extraction, the study authors were contacted to gather 
missing data on the trials. In case data were presented for 
subgroups  of  the  sample  only  (e.g.,  presenting  data  for 

responders vs. non-responders), the respective means and 
SDs were combined by decomposing the mean and SD (Hig-
gins et al., 2021). To obtain IPD, we sent data requests to all 
corresponding study authors (e.g., we gathered patient ID, 
sex, age, and severity of depressive symptoms at pre- and 
post-treatments, as well as information on applied stimula-
tion protocols, such as frequency or intensity). If the study 
authors could not be reached via data requests, IPD was 
extracted from published articles, if available. We combined 
IPD into a single, consistent data set, while any data issues 
(e.g., invalid, or out-of-range scores) were resolved in col-
laboration with the primary study authors, if manageable. 
Data preparation was conducted using Stata/SE version 17.0 
(StataCorp, 2019).

Statistical analyses

We first conducted a meta-analysis of aggregated data gath-
ered from primary studies addressing the efficacy of TMS 
treatment  in  adolescent  depression.  Two  separate  meta-
analyses were conducted, considering Standardized Mean 
Change  Score  (SMCC)  and  response  rate,  respectively. 
Second, IPD meta-analysis, contemporaneously regarded 
as the gold standard of meta-analysis, was conducted on a 
subsample of studies for which IPD were available. Again, 
two different types of analyses were conducted, considering 
treatment efficacy as well as response. IPD meta-analysis 
allowed us to examine potential treatment interactions with 
the patient- and study-level characteristics.

Meta‑analysis of aggregated data

To conduct a meta-analysis of existing studies on the effi-
cacy of TMS treatment in adolescent depression, based on 
aggregated data from each primary study, we calculated 
SMCC and the accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI) 
between pre- and post-treatment depression scores. To cal-
culate SMCC, information on total sample size, pre- and 
post-treatment means, standard deviations, and the strength 
of association (correlation coefficient) between pre- and 
post-treatment values are required [61, 62]. Thus, if the cor-
relation coefficient between pre- and post-treatment scores 
had not been reported and could not be calculated directly 
over IPD data, as was the case for many studies, the respec-
tive correlation was estimated over available summary sta-
tistics (e.g., pre- and post-treatment means and SD, SMD). 
Individual effect size estimates from primary studies were 
subsequently pooled using a random-effects model [63]. We 
used restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) 
where effect size and heterogeneity estimates are achieved 
iteratively, as generally recommended [64, 65]. Heterogene-
ity between primary studies was tested for significance using 
the Cochrane Q statistic, testing the null hypothesis that all 

1 3 
European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:1501–1525 

1505

variation in effect size estimates across studies is due to sam-
pling error [66]. The amount of true heterogeneity across 
studies was further estimated via the I2
 statistic, indexing 
the proportion of heterogeneity across studies not due to 
random error. Following widely used conventions [67], we 
interpreted an I2
 statistic of 25% as small, 50% as moderate, 
and 75% as to signify high levels of heterogeneity. We next 
applied the conventional Egger’s regression test [68, 69] to 
explore the likely presence (Egger’s regression test: p < 0.1) 
or absence (Egger’s regression test: p ≥ 0.1) of small-study 
effects [70]. Furthermore, different variants of the funnel 
plot as a diagnostic tool widely applied in meta-analysis 
were created. Specifically, we created traditional funnel 
plots, which allowed us to examine whether smaller stud-
ies inherent of larger standard errors and associated lower 
analytic power tended to yield larger ES (examination of 
small-study effect): scatter plots of the effect size estimates 
from primary studies against their standard errors were plot-
ted, including a funnel centered on the summary effect size 
[68, 71]. Then, to more closely examine the distribution of 
studies with regard to statistical significance, we also created 
contour-enhanced funnel plots centered on zero, including 
contours that represent conventional levels of statistical sig-
nificance (i.e., ≤ 0.01, ≤ 0.05, ≤ 0.10, and ≤ 1.00) as a graphi-
cal aid for interpretation [72]. Finally, in addition to sum-
marizing effect sizes over all primary studies, we conducted 
sensitivity analyses in the form of subgroup meta-analysis: 
first, we summarized a subgroup of studies based on applied 
frequency and target location (i.e., including only studies 
where high-frequency stimulation was applied unilaterally 
to the left DLPFC), secondly, subgroups of studies were 
summarized based on the method used to localize the target 
region (i.e., studies using scalp-based methods vs. neuro-
navigation techniques), and third, subgroups of studies were 
summarized based on study design (i.e., randomized sham-
controlled trials vs. uncontrolled studies).

To obtain a measure of aggregated response rate, for each 
primary study, the absolute number of responders in each 
study sample was converted to a measure of raw propor-
tions. Measures of the raw proportion of treatment respond-
ers obtained for each primary study (as available) were fur-
ther synthesized using a random-effects model and REML, 
resulting in the summary estimate of Transformed Propor-
tion [62]. Model diagnostics, heterogeneity measures, and 
sensitivity analyses (subgroup meta-analysis) were applied 
as described above.

Meta‑analysis of individual‑patient data 

Following traditional meta-analysis, we performed explor-
atory  one-stage  IPD  meta-analysis,  exploring  treatment 
effects on the patient-level and in interaction with patient- 
as well as treatment-level characteristics. One-stage models 

might be particularly suitable if only a few or small stud-
ies are subjected to IPD meta-analysis, as they generally 
improve the statistical power to detect treatment by covari-
ate interactions [57, 73, 74]. With regards to our primary 
outcome,  we  used  mixed-effects  linear  regression,  con-
sidering separately each depression scale deployed in at 
least two independent primary studies for which IPD were 
available (which included the Hamilton Depression Rat-
ing Scale, HDRS; Beck Depression Inventory-II, BDI-II; 
and the revised version of the Children’s Depression Rat-
ing Scale, CDRS-R). In the respective models, accounting 
for clustering of measurements within individuals clustered 
within trials, we explored pre-treatment to post-treatment 
change in depression scores (commonly used formula: out-
come ~ 1 + time + (1 | lab) + (1 | participant)). Furthermore, 
we examined treatment interactions with the patient-level 
characteristics age (in years), sex (0, male and 1, female), 
and pre-treatment (baseline) depression scores, and with the 
trial-level characteristics ‘laterality’ (unilateral or bilateral 
stimulation applied), total number of sessions, treatment 
duration (in days), and the TMS modality applied (stand-
ard rTMS or TBS). Each of these moderators or treatment-
covariate interactions were tested one at a time (commonly 
used formula: outcome ~ 1 + time * covariate + (1 | lab) + (1 | 
participant)). Considering treatment response (0, 1; binary), 
mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for 
clustering of individuals within trials, were computed, while 
we examined the potential influence of the above patient- 
and trial-level covariates in predicting treatment response 
vs. non-response, again considering each covariate at a time 
(commonly  used  formula:  response ~ 1 + covariate + (1  | 
lab)). Of note, given the exploratory nature of these second-
ary analyses, no corrections for multiple comparisons were 
applied.

Results

Search results

In Fig. 1, the study selection process is illustrated based 
on current versions of the PRISMA and PRISMA-IPD flow 
diagrams [56, 57]. After the identification of potentially 
eligible studies, all duplicates were removed. We screened 
a total of 1237 titles and abstracts from original articles, 
resulting in 82 studies forwarded to full-text assessment, 
including records from additional sources. From the initial 
pool of potentially eligible studies, 11 studies were retained 
for qualitative synthesis. All corresponding study authors 
were contacted to retrieve further information on the respec-
tive data, and to gather IPD. During this stage, one study 
[75] was excluded because the respective sample entirely 
overlapped with the sample from a more recent publication

with a larger sample size [76]. As follows, N = 10 individual 
study samples were subjected to the quantitative synthesis 
of aggregated data [53, 54, 76]–[82]. Upon contacting the 
study authors of all primary studies, IPD was provided for 
three studies via the author correspondence [48, 76, 78]. 
Moreover, for two studies, IPD could be extracted from pub-
lished research articles [77, 79]. Considering the remaining 
studies, IPD could not be retrieved because either, the cor-
responding authors did not respond to our initial as well as 
several repeated follow-up data requests (n = 3; [53, 81, 82]), 
or because the respective study data could not be shared due 
to industry sponsorship and respective regulations (n = 2; 
[54, 80]).

Included studies

In Table 1, summary characteristics of each study included 
in the present quantitative analyses are presented. In total, 
the 10 studies identified included N = 247 participants, with 
a mean number of N = 25 (SD = 15) participants per study, a 
mean age of 17.45 (mean SD = 1.99) years, and on average, 
samples included 63.47% females. Sample sizes ranged from 
N = 8 to N = 48 participants. Of all studies included, two 
reported on the ethnicity of their included sample. Three 
studies had been conducted in China, three studies in the 
US, two in Canada, one in Australia, and one study had been 
conducted in Israel. Considering study design, two studies 

adopted a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled 
design, while the remaining eight studies were open-label 
studies, without a control group. Considering primary out-
come measures, the number of deployed depression scales 
ranged from one to five (see further Table 1). Participants in 
all studies were under antidepressant treatment while receiv-
ing TMS, including antidepressant medication alone (seven 
studies) or a combination of antidepressants and psychother-
apy (three studies; please see Table 1). Considering TMS 
treatment regimen, nine studies applied standard rTMS, and 
in one study, a combination of continuous and intermittent 
TBS (cTBS and iTBS) was used. Eight studies applied uni-
lateral stimulation, of which six targeted the left DLPFC, 
one stimulated the left PFC, and one study targeted either the 
left or the right DLPFC. Of the remaining two studies, one 
applied bilateral stimulation, targeting both the left and right 
DLPFC, and in one study, either the right DLPFC was stimu-
lated or stimulation was applied bilaterally (left and right 
DLPFC). Four studies localized the target region(s) based 
on a neuro-navigation technique, while five studies applied 
scalp-based localization using the 5-cm-rule (in one study, 
this was 6 cm). One study did not report on the localization 
of the target region. Mean treatment duration was 3.5 weeks 
(SD = 1.73; range: 1–6), and on average, treatment sessions 
lasted for 35 min (SD = 7.42; range: 20–40). Considering 
stimulation-parameter settings, number of pulses per session 
ranged from 1800 to 6000, with stimulation of 2–5 s per

10 Hz except for TBS at 50 Hz (one study), and stimulation 
intensities ranged from 80 to 120 RMT (one study used the 
‘active motor threshold’; AMT).

Meta‑analyses on aggregated data

Pre‑ to post‑treatment change

Synthesis of all 10 studies examining pre- to post-treatment 
change in depression scores resulted in a significant pooled 
effect size estimate (pooled SMCC = 2.04, 95% CI [1.46; 
2.61], SE = 0.29,  p < 0.001), implying a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in depression scores measured at post-
treatment compared to respective pre-treatment (baseline) 
scores. Individual and summary effect size estimates as 
observed are depicted in a forest plot (Fig. 2). The resulting 
Chi-square Q statistic exceeded the level of statistical sig-
nificance, suggesting significant between-study heterogene-
ity (Q10 = 56.17, p < 0.001). The estimate I2 suggested that 
84.49% (95% CI [65.76–96.20]) of the variance in estimates 
of effect size was due to true variation between primary 

studies  rather  than  mere  sampling  error,  conventionally 
regarded as a large amount of heterogeneity between studies.
The corresponding funnel plots of individual observed 
estimates of effect size against their standard error (A) and 
the respective contour-enhanced version (B) are shown in 
Fig. 3. Visual inspection of the funnel plots A and B (Fig. 3) 
suggested likely presence of small-study bias, which was in 
accordance with the results from Egger’s regression test of 
funnel plot asymmetry (z = 2.06, p = 0.039). Furthermore, 
five studies seemed to be outliers as by visual inspection of 
funnel plot A (Fig. 3), and in all but one study, which fell in 
the range of p values between 0.01 and 0.05, p values were 
located in the range between 0.001 and 0.01.

Considering sensitivity analyses, synthesis of a subgroup 
of seven studies applying high-frequency stimulation solely 
to the left DLPFC (as opposed to the remaining three studies 
where high- and/or low-frequency stimulation was applied 
uni- and/or bilaterally) resulted in an overall significant 
pooled effect size estimate (pooled SMCC = 1.99, 95% CI 
[1.26; 2.72], SE = 0.37, p < 0.001), suggesting a statistically 
significant reduction in depression scores. Second, synthe-
ses of two subgroups of studies based on localization of the 
target region resulted in an overall significant pooled effect

Fig. 3   Funnel  plots  of  individual  observed  effect  size  estimates  of 
standardized  mean  change  (SMCC)  between  pre-  to  post-treatment 
depression scores against the corresponding standard errors (i.e., the 
square  root  of  the  sampling  variances)  on  the  y-axis,  and  of  Trans-
formed Proportion of treatment responders against the corresponding 
standard  errors  on  the  y-axis,  to  aid  assessment  of  potential  small-
study  bias.  A,  C:  Traditional  funnel  plots  centered  at  the  observed 
summary  effect  (SMCC  and  Transformed  Proportion,  respectively). 

B, D: Contour-enhanced funnel plots centered at zero including grey-
shaded regions that indicate various levels of statistical significance: 
the  unshaded  region  in  the  middle  of  the  funnel  corresponds  to  p 
values  greater  than  0.10,  the  dark  grey-shaded  region  corresponds 
to p values between 0.10 and 0.05, the light grey-shaded region cor-
responds  to  p  values  between  0.05  and  0.01,  and  the  region  outside 
of the funnel (light blue) corresponds to p values below 0.01 (group 
comparison and correlational meta-analysis, respectively)

size estimate for the subgroup of studies where a scalp-based 
method had been used (k = 5, pooled SMCC = 1.97, 95% 
CI [0.83; 3.10], SE = 0.58, p < 0.001), as well as the stud-
ies where a neuro-navigation technique had been applied 
(k = 4, pooled SMCC = 1.87, 95% CI [1.47; 2.28], SE = 0.20, 

p < 0.001). Third, syntheses of two subgroups of studies 
based  on  study  design  resulted  in  an  overall  significant 
pooled effect size estimate for the subgroup of randomized 
controlled trials (k = 2, pooled SMCC = 1.54, 95% CI [0.53; 
2.55],  SE = 0.52,  p = 0.003),  as  well  as  the  subgroup  of

uncontrolled studies (k = 8, pooled SMCC = 2.18, 95% CI 
[1.50; 2.86], SE = 0.34, p < 0.001).

Response rate

By pooling seven individual observed estimates of the raw 
proportion of treatment responders, we found a significant 
summary estimate (Transformed Proportion: 0.41 (41.30%), 
95% CI [0.31; 0.52], SE = 0.05; p < 0.001), implying a sta-
tistically significant treatment response rate. A forest plot 
depicting individual and summary estimates of response rate 
is illustrated in Fig. 4. The Chi-square Q statistic was non-
significant (Q7 = 10.80, p = 0.095), suggesting that variation 
in ES estimates might be due to sampling error rather than 
true between-study heterogeneity. Nonetheless, the estimate 
I2 suggested 47.06% (95% CI [0.00; 88.94]) of the variance 
in estimates of effect size to be due to true variation between 
primary studies rather than mere sampling error, conven-
tionally regarded as a moderate amount of heterogeneity 
between the studies.

Visual inspection of the funnel plots C and D (Fig. 3), 
and in accordance with the results from Egger’s regression 
test of funnel plot asymmetry (z = 0.93, p = 0.354), did not 

clearly indicate the presence of publication bias. One study 
was identified as outlier as by visual inspection of funnel 
plot C (Fig. 3). Again, in all but one study, which fell in 
the range of p values between 0.01 and 0.05, p values were 
located in the range between 0.001 and 0.01. Considering 
sensitivity  analyses,  synthesis  of  a  subgroup  of  5  stud-
ies applying high-frequency stimulation solely to the left 
DLPFC (as opposed to the three remaining studies where 
high- and/or low-frequency stimulation was applied uni- 
and/or bilaterally) resulted in an overall significant pooled 
effect size estimate (Transformed Proportion: 0.46 (45.52%), 
95% CI [0.36; 0.55], SE = .0.05, p < 0.001) suggesting a sta-
tistically significant treatment response rate. Second, syn-
theses of two subgroups of studies based on localization 
of the target region resulted in overall significant pooled 
effect size estimates for both the subgroup of studies where 
a scalp-based method had been used (k = 4, Transformed 
Proportion: 0.40 (39.72%), 95% CI [0.31; 0.49], SE = 0.05, 
p < 0.001) and the studies where neuro-navigation had been 
applied (k = 3, Transformed Proportion: 0.44 (44.12%), 95% 
CI [0.18; 0.70], SE = 0.13, p < 0.001). Third, syntheses of 
two subgroups of studies based on study design resulted in 
an overall significant effect size estimate for the subgroup

erally  to  the  left  DLPFC  are  highlighted  in  gray.  CDRS-R  Revised

of randomized controlled trials (k = 1, Transformed Propor-
tion = 0.42, 95% CI [0.28; 56], SE = 0.07, p =  < 0.001), as 
well as the subgroup of uncontrolled studies (k = 6, Trans-
formed Proportion = 0.42, 95% CI [0.29; 54], SE = 0.07, 
p =  < 0.001).

Meta‑analyses on individual‑patient data 
(one‑stage models)

In total, N = 5 independent datasets from uncontrolled stud-
ies  were  subjected  to  IPD  meta-analysis.  Data  included 
various depression scales. We conducted IPD meta-analysis 
individually for each depression scale, if at least two inde-
pendent datasets included the respective scale as primary 
outcome  measure.  Accordingly,  we  conducted  separate 
analyses including data on the HDRS (as provided for 3 
studies, N = 61), CDRS-R (provided for 4 studies, N = 51), 
and BDI-II (provided for 3 studies, N = 61). Correlation 
coefficients between pre- and post-treatment scores from all 
three measures are provided in Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Materials.

Pre‑ to post‑treatment change

Considering pre- to post-treatment change in depression 
scores, exploratory mixed-effects linear regression analy-
sis, accounting for repeated measures within individuals 
clustered within trials, revealed a statistically significant 
pre- to post-treatment change considering each of the three 
depression scales examined (HDRS: B = – 8.72, β = – 1.23, 
t59 = – 10.62,  p < 0.001;  BDI-II:  B = – 11.63,  β = – 0.92, 
t60 = – 7.73,  p < 0.001;  CDRS-R:  B = – 0.72,  β = – 1.26, 
t59 = – 10.62, p < 0.001). Respective intra-class correlation 
coefficients (ICC) suggested that on average, about 26% of 
variance in outcome was due to clustering on the person-
level (HDRS: 27%; CDRS: 15%; BDI-II: 37%). Trial level 
clustering on average accounted for another 26% of the vari-
ance (HDRS: 19%; CDRS: 36%; BDI-II: 24%). For the pur-
pose of visualization, Standardized Individual Differences 
(SID; HDRS mean SID = 1.46, SD = 1.0, range: – 0.67 to 
3.59; CDRS-R mean SID = 1.77; SD = 1.48, range: – 0.70 
to 5.76; BDI-II mean SID = 1.01, SD = 1.01, range: – 0.89 
to 3.21) were plotted using histograms (Fig. 5).

Results from moderator analyses, that is, mixed-effects 
linear regression models examining treatment interactions 
with the patient- and treatment-level characteristics, while 
accounting for repeated measures and trial-level clustering, 
are summarized in Table S2. Based on available IPD from 
studies reporting on the HDRS, the patient-level character-
istics age and severity of depression at pre-treatment (base-
line) significantly moderated pre- to post-treatment change 
in depression severity. Specifically, younger age and higher 
severity  of  depression  at  baseline  were  associated  with 

significantly higher reduction in HDRS scores between pre- 
and post-treatment measurements, as compared to higher-
aged individuals and those with lower baseline depression 
scores. Considering treatment-level characteristics, pre- to 
post-treatment change in HDRS scores was significantly 
associated with ‘laterality’ (i.e., whether uni- or bilateral 
stimulation had been applied), the total number of stimu-
lation sessions participants received, and the TMS modal-
ity applied (i.e., standard rTMS vs. TBS). With unilateral 
as compared to bilateral stimulation, a higher reduction in 
HDRS scores was observed, as with a higher number of ses-
sions, and with standard rTMS compared to TBS. Of note, 
additionally controlling for the number of sessions when 
considering rTMS modality as a potential moderator did not 
significantly affect the respective results. Considering poten-
tial covariates of pre- to post-treatment change in CDRS-R 
scores, total number of sessions as well as treatment duration 
was identified as significant moderators. Both a higher num-
ber of sessions and a higher duration of treatment (higher 
number of days) were associated with significantly higher 
reductions in CDRS-R scores from pre- to post-treatment. 
Finally, considering BDI-II scores, pre- to post-treatment 
change was significantly associated with patient age, while 
the covariates ‘laterality’, number of TMS sessions, and 
TMS modality were trend significant. In addition, here, 
lower age was linked with significantly higher reductions 
in BDI-II scores at treatment termination. Interpretations of 
significant treatment-covariate interactions were examined 
visually by interaction-plots, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Treatment response vs. non‑response

Considering exploratory IPD meta-analysis of treatment 
response vs. non-response, in total and on average, 30.26% 
of patients were considered as treatment responders (mini-
mum 50% reduction from pre- to post-treatment). Based 
on HDRS scores, 42.62% of patients were considered as 
treatment responders, while 15% of variance in treatment 
response vs. non-response was explained by study-level 
clustering. Considering CDRS-R scores, only 13.73% of 
patients were treated as responders, and study-level cluster-
ing accounted for 61% of variance in treatment response. 
Regarding  BDI-II  scores,  34.43%  of  patients  were  con-
sidered treatment responders, with study-level clustering 
accounting for 11% of variance in treatment response. Rates 
of treatment response vs. non-response by outcome measure 
and trial are depicted in Fig. 7.

Results from mixed-effects logistic regression models 
accounting for clustering within trials and examining the 
potential influence of patient- and treatment-level char-
acteristics  on  treatment  response  vs.  non-response  are 
summarized  in  Table  S3.  Based  on  available  IPD  and 
HDRS as well as the BDI-II scores, age was identified as

significant patient-level covariate of treatment response, 
with a higher likelihood of treatment response linked with 
younger age. Considering treatment-level characteristics 
as potential covariates, ‘laterality’, the total number of 
stimulation sessions, and TMS modality, were identified 
as to significantly influence treatment response measured 
over both the HDRS and BDI-II scores. With unilateral as 
compared to bilateral stimulation, a higher likelihood of 
treatment response was observed, as with a higher number 
of treatment sessions, and standard rTMS compared to 
TBS. Of note, when considering CDRS-R scores, none of 
the covariates examined was found to significantly moder-
ate treatment response.

Discussion

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was con-
ducted with the primary aims of quantifying efficacy of 
TMS in the treatment of adolescent depression and explor-
ing respective patient- and trial-level moderators while con-
sidering the data currently available on a study (aggregated 
data) and patient-level (IPD), respectively. As a secondary 
aim, we also synthesized available data on rates of treat-
ment response (aggregated data), and explored respective 
moderators (IPD).

First, meta-analysis of aggregated data suggested TMS 
to significantly reduce depression severity in adolescent

patients,  which  was  further  in  line  with  significant 
response rates. However, analyses of aggregated data also 
suggested potential biases, such as small-study effects. 
Indeed, the studies included were characterized by small 
sample sizes and large standard errors, respectively. Of 
note, all studies reported a statistically significant mean 
change in depression severity under active rTMS treat-
ment from baseline to post-treatment, providing strong 
indications  for  potential  publication  bias—which  was 
also suggested by visual inspection of funnel plots and 
formal  testing  of  funnel  plot  asymmetry,  respectively. 
Collectively, the present studies were also very hetero-
geneous with respect to dosing protocols for  TMS. Of 
note, only two out of 10 studies included in the present 
synthesis applied a double-blind, randomized, and sham-
controlled study design, and there have been considerable 
concerns about open-label trials to inherently inflate effect 

sizes and to be prone to several further biases, including 
regression to the mean, investigator biases, and, critically, 
confounding of active treatment with placebo effects [37, 
83]. Sham stimulation in rTMS trials can be considered 
in analogy to pill placebo in pharmacological trials [37], 
and respective trials suggest larger response rates to pill 
placebo in adolescent as compared to adult depression [84, 
85]—with reported rates of placebo response in adoles-
cents ranging between 22 and 59% [86–93]. Considering 
rTMS treatment, there is only one large-scale randomized 
controlled study currently available that would inform on 
the response rate to sham stimulation in adolescent depres-
sion, suggesting a sham response rate of 36.4% [54]—
which falls well within the range of response rates reported 
for pill placebo. As a comparison, meta-analytic studies 
suggest response rates to sham rTMS in adult patients with 
depression to be at around 10 or 11% [25, 94].

Based  on  IPD  from  five  individual  study  samples, 
accounting for repeated measures within individuals clus-
tered within trials, and considering three different depression 
scales (i.e., HDRS, CDRS-R, and BDI-II), we found treat-
ment efficacy as well as response to be associated with cer-
tain patient and trial-level characteristics. Most consistently 
observed was the influence of patients’ age, with younger 
individuals  exhibiting  a  higher  reduction  in  depression 
scores as well as a higher likelihood of treatment response 
compared to individuals of older age. This finding some-
what aligns with existing meta-analytic evidence on TMS 
in adult patients suggesting young age to present a good 
prognostic factor [39], as well as with findings from an evi-
dence synthesis of several short-term randomized controlled 
trials of antidepressants, reporting higher placebo response 
rates in younger as compared to older adolescents (after 
the exclusion of one large fluoxetine trial) [93]. Of note, 
presently, most studies included samples of older-aged ado-
lescents (mean age of 17.45 ± 1.99 years), with only one 
study including relatively younger adolescents between 12 
and 14 years. However, based on the present findings as 
well as growing evidence which points towards a favorable 
safety profile of TMS for the treatment of adolescent depres-
sion [52], future studies should also consider younger indi-
viduals with MDD. Furthermore, although only observed 
when considering HDRS but not CDRS-R or BDI-II scores, 
depression severity was a significant moderator of pre- to 
post-treatment change after TMS. This finding also aligns 
with a considerable amount of evidence in adults, suggest-
ing TMS to be particularly valuable in severe cases of adult 
MDD, and in patients with TRD [25, 27, 95]. TMS applied 
to the DLPFC in adolescent MDD might reverse some of 
the aberrant functional connectivity between prefrontal and 
subcortical regions, which, during the period of adolescence 
that is characterized by peak PFC plasticity, might result in 
long-term clinical improvement, especially in severe cases 
of depression [37]. Considering the present variability of 
results based on the outcome measure considered, several 
potential explanations for this finding exist. First, the pre-
sent findings based on IPD analyses in general might simply 
present spurious associations that might have occurred based 
on a multiple testing situation, and future studies with pre-
planned hypotheses testing will be needed to confirm the 
observed associations. Furthermore, there might be poor 
concordance between different instruments, i.e., clinician-
rated (such as the HDRS or MADRS) and patient-reported 
(BDI-II) outcome measures of symptoms of depression [96]. 
Furthermore, specifically considering the CDRS-R, which 
currently presents the most commonly used scale in adoles-
cent depression research, existing studies on the psychomet-
ric properties of this instrument when used in adolescents 
(but which was originally developed for use in children aged 
6–12 years) are of low methodological quality, and thus it 

currently remains unclear whether the CDRS-R appropri-
ately measures depressive symptom severity in adolescent 
MDD [97]. Finally, differences in IPD analysis results con-
sidering different measures might also go back to under-
lying sample characteristics, which presently has not been 
explored further but should be considered in future antide-
pressant trial. Besides patient factors, several trial-specific, 
TMS-related factors were identified to significantly moder-
ate treatment efficacy as well as the likelihood of treatment 
response. These included the laterality of stimulation, the 
specific TMS modality applied, treatment duration, and the 
number of stimulation sessions applied, respectively. Con-
cerning the latter, greater efficacy of TMS has also been 
previously reported for protocols applying a higher number 
of stimulation sessions, as well as a greater number of pulses 
per session [98–100]. In the five studies included in IPD 
meta-analysis, the number of sessions ranged from 10 to 
30 sessions, with a treatment duration of 14–42 days. It has 
been previously suggested that increasing the number of ses-
sions per day from one to multiple might increase efficiency 
[37]. Yet, as presently observed, a longer treatment dura-
tion might also increase efficacy (although potentially con-
founded by the number of sessions applied). Consequently, 
future studies should investigate the relative importance of 
the number of TMS sessions and overall treatment duration 
considering treatment efficacy to determine a session/dura-
tion ratio that optimizes stimulation protocols for both effi-
cacy and efficiency. Concerning laterality of stimulation, the 
present finding of greater efficacy observed with unilateral 
compared to bilateral stimulation is in line with results from 
a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled study in 
adults with TRD [101]. In the respective study, only unilat-
eral stimulation was significantly more effective compared 
to sham stimulation at treatment termination and was cor-
related with a higher percentage of patients who showed 
remission. Further, unilateral but not bilateral TMS showed 
higher antidepressant efficacy compared to sham stimulation 
in the respective study. However, these and the present find-
ings are somewhat contradictory to existing meta-analytic 
evidence, suggesting that bilateral stimulation might not be 
statistically significantly different from unilateral stimulation 
in adult MDD [102–104]. Given potential neurodevelop-
mentally driven differences between the pathophysiology of 
MDD in adolescents compared to adults, it is important that 
future studies further investigate whether unilateral com-
pared to bilateral stimulation might be differentially effec-
tive in adolescent MDD. Similar, standard rTMS compared 
to TBS was associated with greater treatment response. Of 
note, only one of the included studies used TBS. Primary 
studies addressing the comparative efficacy of rTMS versus 
TBS are warranted.

The present results must be interpreted within the con-
straints of considerable limitations inherent to this evidence

synthesis. First, given the current lack of randomized con-
trolled trials considering TMS treatment in minors with 
depression,  we  failed  to  conduct  a  synthesis  of  results 
from  rigorous  randomized  controlled  trials  comparing 
active rTMS treatment with sham stimulation. Instead, we 
conducted a quantitative synthesis of results from mainly 
uncontrolled studies. While non-randomized studies are 
increasingly recognized as a potential source of insights into 
real-world performance of novel therapeutics, and thus are 
certainly of value for healthcare decision making especially 
in the case of novel and innovative treatments [105], high-
quality, randomized controlled trials unequivocally provide 
the most reliable evidence on the relative efficacy and safety 
of medical interventions. The present results must therefore 
be considered highly cautiously. As a further critical limita-
tion, individual-patient data were retrieved only for half (i.e., 
five out of ten) of the studies that were included in the pre-
sent meta-analysis, and most critically, we failed to include 
IPD data from randomized controlled trials—which cer-
tainly would have significantly improved the quality of the 
data included and allowed us to also consider effects of sham 
stimulation in IPD meta-analysis. Barriers to obtaining IPD 
on the one hand were encountered due to a lack of respon-
siveness of the corresponding authors even to repeated data 
requests. Furthermore, barriers were also encountered in the 
form of data sharing policies of study sponsors from the 
industry. Either problem is strongly impeding on the quality 
of meta-science, and endeavors to further ameliorate and 
facilitate practices of data sharing are warranted (for a scop-
ing review and practical guide on the matter, we refer the 
reader to, e.g., [106]).

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis is the first to synthesize existing 
evidence, consisting of mainly uncontrolled trials, for the 
use of TMS in adolescents with MDD. We found that TMS 
might be an efficient treatment for adolescents with MDD, 
in particular for those of younger age. Several treatment 
modality settings were identified that significantly influence 
treatment outcomes. Given the methodological limitations 
of primary studies included in the present meta-analysis, 
these should be interpreted with caution but—in the current 
absence of better evidence—may inform clinical practice in 
the application of TMS in youth with MDD.
