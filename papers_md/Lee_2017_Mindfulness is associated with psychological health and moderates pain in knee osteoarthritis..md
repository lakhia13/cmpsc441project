Abstract

Objective—Previous studies suggest that higher mindfulness is associated with less pain and 
depression. However, the role of mindfulness has never been studied in knee osteoarthritis (OA). 
We evaluate the relationships between mindfulness and pain, psychological symptoms, and quality 
of life in knee OA.

Method—We performed a secondary analysis of baseline data from our randomized comparative 
trial in participants with knee OA. Mindfulness was assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness 
Questionnaire. We measured pain, physical function, quality of life, depression, stress, and self-
efficacy with commonly-used patient-reported measures. Simple and multivariable regression 
models were utilized to assess associations between mindfulness and health outcomes. We further 
tested whether mindfulness moderated the pain-psychological outcome associations.

Results—Eighty patients were enrolled (60.3±10.3 years;76.3% female, body mass index:
33.0±7.1kg/m2). Total mindfulness score was associated with mental (beta=1.31,95% CI:

0.68,1.95) and physical (beta=0.69,95% CI:0.06,1.31) component quality of life, self-efficacy 
(beta=0.22,95% CI:0.07,0.37), depression (beta=-1.15,95% CI:-1.77,-0.54), and stress 
(beta=-1.07,95% CI:-1.53,-0.60). Of the five facets, the Describing, Acting-with-Awareness, and 
Non-judging mindfulness facets had the most associations with psychological health. No 
significant association was found between mindfulness and pain or function (P=0.08-0.24). 
However, we found that mindfulness moderated the effect of pain on stress (P=0.02).

Conclusion—Mindfulness is associated with depression, stress, self-efficacy, and quality of life 
among knee OA patients. Mindfulness also moderates the influence of pain on stress, which 
suggests that mindfulness may alter the way one copes with pain. Future studies examining the 
benefits of mind-body therapy, designed to increase mindfulness, for patients with OA are 
warranted.

Introduction

Mindfulness is the ability or practice of maintaining a non-judgmental state of heightened 
awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.1, 2 
The last fifteen years have seen a surging interest in mindfulness as a therapeutic modality 
that may foster improved health outcomes for patients with chronic pain.3-10 Previous 
studies have found that higher levels of mindfulness in chronic pain patients were associated 
with lower self-reported pain7, 9, 11-13 and better pain coping perceptions.3, 14-20 In addition, 
a recent meta-analysis revealed that interventions promoting mindfulness significantly 
reduced pain intensity and pain disability in chronic pain patients.3 Mindfulness has recently 
been characterized as a multidimensional construct of five distinct facets: Observing, 
Describing, Acting with awareness, Non-judging, and Non-reacting. By analyzing 
mindfulness at the singular facet level, researchers attempt to further examine psychological 
mechanisms through which mindfulness specifically contributes to improved health.2, 14, 21 
In chronic pain patients, however, only a few studies have utilized this multidimensional 
approach to assess mindfulness.22-24

Whether mindfulness plays a role specifically in non-surgical patients with symptomatic 
knee osteoarthritis (OA) has never been examined. Knee OA is the most common cause of 
disability and joint pain in adults,24, 25 and is primarily characterized by chronic pain which 
is exacerbated by central sensitization,26, 27 and reduced physical functioning. In addition, 
patients with OA often suffer from comorbid depression 28 and anxiety, and significantly 
worse quality of life.29, 30 Although interventions that promote mindfulness skills have 
repeatedly resulted in improved psychological outcomes for other chronic pain patient 
groups,7, 12, 13, 31 the underlying mechanism of change remains unclear, and no studies have 
yet assessed the way mindfulness relates with parameters of physical and psychological 
health in patients with knee OA. In order to examine the disease-modifying mechanisms of 
mind body medicine treatments in this population, it is important to understand how 
mindfulness associates with various, relevant health outcomes. This type of knowledge is 
also important for optimizing the clinical decision-making process for knee OA patients.

The goal of this study is to examine how mindfulness and its facets are associated with pain, 
physical, and psychological health measured with commonly-used outcome tools in a 
chronic pain population with symptomatic knee OA. We further investigate for evidence of 
pain coping effects using interaction analyses of mindfulness on pain-psychological health 
associations. We hypothesize that higher total mindfulness and 1 or more individual facets of 
mindfulness will be associated with less pain, less depression, less stress, better self-efficacy 
and quality of life. We also hypothesize that mindfulness can moderate the influence of pain 
on psychological health.

Method

Study design

This study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis performed on baseline data that was 
collected for a single-center, 52-week, randomized comparative effectiveness trial of Tai Chi 
vs. standard physical therapy for adult patients with knee OA. Detailed description of the 
recruitment and enrollment criteria for this trial has been previously published.32

Participants were recruited from the Greater Boston metropolitan area through 
advertisements using print media, social media, and the rheumatology clinic patient database 
at Tufts Medical Center. Inclusion criteria included: 1) age ≥ 40 years, 2) fulfillment of the 
American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee OA, and 3) Western Ontario and 
McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score ≥ 40. Exclusion criteria included: 1) 
prior experience with complementary medicine or physical therapy programs for knee OA 
within the past year, 2) severe medical limitations precluding full participation, 3) intra-
articular steroid injections or surgery in the past three months, 4) intra-articular hyaluronic 
acid injections in the past six months, 5) Mini-Mental Status examination score <24, or 6) 
inability to walk without an assistive device. All participants signed an informed consent 
form before enrollment, and the study was approved by the Tufts Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board.

Outcome measures

The collection of FFMQ data was formally implemented in the study protocol after subject 
recruitment and data collection had already begun. Therefore this study only reports data 
from the portion of enrolled participants who completed the FFMQ at baseline.

The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a self-report survey measuring total 
mindfulness and five different facets of mindfulness. The FFMQ was derived from 
exploratory factor analysis of the combined item pool of five independently-developed 
mindfulness assessment tools. It consists of 39 five-point Likert scale (1=never or very 
rarely true to 5=very often or always true) questions, where higher scores reflect higher 
mindfulness. Total mindfulness scores range from 39-195, and total facet scores from 7-40. 
The FFMQ has been validated in both meditating and non-meditating samples, and was the 
highest rated mindfulness patient-report assessment tool for construct validity and internal 
consistency.21

Five individual facets of mindfulness

1) The Observing facet (8-item, range 8-40) measures the ability to attend to or notice 
internal and external stimuli, such as sensations, emotions, cognitions, sights, sounds, and 
smells.2, 33 2) The Describing facet (8-item, range 8-40) measures noting or mentally 
labeling observed stimuli with words.33, 34 3) The Acting-with-Awareness facet (8-item, 
range 8-40) measures attending to one's current actions, as opposed to behaving 
automatically or absentmindedly. 4) The Non-judging of experience facet (8-item, range 
8-40) measures refraining from evaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions as 
negative, unacceptable, or intolerable.2, 33, 34 5) The Non-reactivity to experience facet (7-
item, range 7-35) measures the ability to allow thoughts and feelings to come and go, 
without getting caught up in or carried away by them.

The WOMAC is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 3 subscales used to assess pain, 
stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis.35 The pain 
subscale consists of 5 items asking about pain during rest or activity, and can score from 
0-500. The physical function subscale consists of 17 items asking about ability to perform 
daily activities, and can score from 0-1700.

The Six-minute Walk Test (6MW) is a measure of functional exercise capacity.36 
Participants are asked to walk as far as possible within a six-minute period, and the distance 
covered at the end is noted and recorded.

Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), a generic measure of health 
status with well-documented psychometric properties.37 The SF-36 consists of 36 questions 
related to eight dimensions of quality of life. The questions are transformed into a point 
scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better perceived health status. 
Scores were combined to obtain two aggregate scores: the Physical Component Summary 
(PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score.

Beck Depression Inventory, second edition, (BDI) is a 21-question, validated, self-report 
instrument that measures the severity of depressive symptoms.38 Total scores range from 
0-63, and higher scores reflect greater depressive symptoms. BDI scores ranging from 0-13 
represent minimal depressive symptoms; scores from 14-19 are mild; scores from 20-28 are 
moderate; and scores from 29-63 represent severe depressive symptoms.

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely-used instrument for measuring the level of 
experienced stress, defined as the degree to which situations in one's life over the past month 
are appraised as unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming.39 It consists of 10 items, 
and higher scores reflect a greater degree of perceived stress.

Self-efficacy is the belief that one can successfully take action to produce a desired outcome, 
and was assessed using the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale-8 (ASES-8).40 The ASES-8 is a 
modified version of the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale that has been validated for patients with 
chronic pain. The patients rated each belief on a 10-point Likert scale, where 1 = very 
uncertain and 10 = very certain, to indicate the level of certainty that patients can perform a

task; higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy. The total score was derived by taking the 
average of all responses.

Statistical analysis

All data were first examined visually and statistically for normality of distribution and 
values are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Pearson's 
correlation coefficients were calculated to determine association between FFMQ and 
physical and psychological outcomes. A priori, we identified a list of commonly-used, 
confounding variables from previous studies of mindfulness in chronic pain populations, and 
we also considered plausible confounding factors that could conceptually or biologically 
affect both the independent (mindfulness) and dependent (health outcomes) variables. The 
potential confounding variables we selected were age, sex, race, educational background, 
body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) grade, and Community Healthy 
Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) activity level, and were used in all 
multivariable models. Six separate models were conducted to determine the influence of 
each of the mindfulness measures (total and facet) on the measures of physical and 
psychological health. Finally, multiple regression models were used to test the hypothesized 
moderating effects of mindfulness (moderator) on the relation between pain (predictor) and 
psychological health (dependent variable). Interaction models were run for all FFMQ facets 
and all psychological outcomes. We calculated high, medium, and low variable levels as one 
SD above the mean, within 1 SD of the mean, and below 1 SD of the mean respectively. 
Model assumptions and appropriateness were examined both graphically and analytically 
using scatterplots, studentized residuals, and Cook's distance test. Data were analyzed using 
SAS statistical software (Version 9.4). ModGraph-I was used to create the moderation 
plot.41 A p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics

Table 1 summarizes demographic and clinical participant characteristics. The analysis 
included data obtained from 80 participants who had a mean age of 60 years and an average 
BMI of 33 kg/m2, were predominantly female (76%), white (50%), and college graduates 
(50%). The mean WOMAC pain and function scores were respectively 259 and 916 and 
similar to those from previous knee OA studies. The mean BDI score was 8.0, which 
represents minimal depressive symptoms.38

Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics for each item in the Five Facet Mindfulness 
Questionnaire. The mean for total mindfulness was 142.8 with a standard deviation of 16.6. 
The Non-reacting facet had the lowest mean score of 22.9, whereas the other four facets had 
similar mean scores. Mindfulness facet score distributions showed modest variability with 
standard deviations ranging from 4.7 to 6.6.

Associations between FFMQ total and facet scores and health outcomes

Table 3 illustrates the associations between the FFMQ (total and facet scores) and health 
outcome measures. All significant associations were in the anticipated direction; that is,

higher mindfulness was associated with higher quality of life, and lower depressive 
symptoms and stress. The correlation analyses revealed a pattern in which mindfulness was 
predominantly associated with outcomes of psychological health more so than with 
outcomes of pain or physical health. Higher total mindfulness score was associated with 
higher self-efficacy (r = 0.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.06 to 0.47) and greater 
mental and physical component quality of life (SF-36 MCS: r = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.61; 
SF-36 PCS: r = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.43). Higher total mindfulness was associated with 
lower depressive symptoms (r = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.62 to -0.27) and lower stress (r = -0.51, 
95% CI = -0.65 to -0.32). Mindfulness was not significantly correlated with pain, physical 
functioning, or mobility.

Of the five facets, the Describing facet was significantly associated with five outcome 
measures (SF-36 MCS, PCS, BDI, ASES, and PSS), and both the Acting-with-Awareness 
and Non-judging facets were significantly associated with 3 outcome measures (SF-36 
MCS, BDI, and PSS). These three facets were the facets found most frequently associated 
with psychological outcome measures. The Observing facet, however, did not have any 
significant associations with health outcomes in this population.

Table 4 summarizes the associations between mindfulness measures and health outcomes 
after controlling for confounding variables. The results revealed a similar pattern from the 
unadjusted correlation analyses wherein the total mindfulness score was associated with 
outcomes of psychological health more so than with measures of pain or physical health. Of 
note, the association between the Acting-with-Awareness facet and self-efficacy (beta =0.10, 
95% CI= 0.01 to 0.18) was only evident on multivariable analysis. The association between 
the Non-reacting facet and depressive symptoms was only evident on the unadjusted 
correlation analysis.

Moderation Effects

To illustrate the nature of this moderation effect, associations between high, medium, and 
low levels of the predictor (i.e. pain) and dependent outcome (i.e. stress) were tested at high, 
medium, and low levels of the moderator (i.e. mindfulness, Acting-with-Awareness [Figure 
1]). This figure shows that mindfulness has a direct relationship with stress. All participants 
with low mindfulness have a higher level of stress, regardless of their level of pain. The 
differences in stress levels are greatest between high and low mindfulness at lower levels of 
pain; therefore as pain increases, the difference in stress decreases. The Acting-with-
Awareness facet significantly moderated the relationship of WOMAC Pain on Perceived 
Stress (beta = 0.002, P = 0.02). No significant moderation was found with the other 
moderators (i.e. FFMQ- total, Describing, Non-judging, and Non-reacting) or dependent 
health outcomes (i.e. BDI, SF-36 PCS and MCS, and ASES-8) investigated.

Discussion

This is the first study to report that mindfulness is associated with relevant health outcomes 
among non-surgical participants with symptomatic knee OA. Overall, we found that 
mindfulness is directly associated with depression, stress, self-efficacy, and health-related 
quality of life in knee OA patients. Specifically, participants reporting higher mindfulness

tended to have lower depressive symptoms and perceived stress, as well as higher self-
efficacy and health-related quality of life. Contrary to our hypothesis, mindfulness is not 
directly associated with pain, but it does moderate the influence of pain on stress, which 
suggests that mindfulness may alter the way one copes with pain. Of the 5 mindfulness 
facets, 3 (Describing, Non-judging, and Acting-with-Awareness) were more frequently 
found to be associated with psychological health outcomes than others. In particular, the 
Acting-with-Awareness facet moderated the pain-stress relationship. Among participants 
with higher mindfulness, pain intensity had less of an impact on perceived stress. This 
suggests that although mindfulness may not alter the severity of pain, it may influence the 
psychosocial effects of chronic pain. The pattern of facet associations found in our study 
identifies unique elements of mindfulness that may be of particular importance in optimizing 
treatment for those with knee OA.

Our results extend the field of mind-body medicine research that found that mindfulness is 
associated with psychological outcomes in patients with chronic OA pain and gives credence 
to the conceptualization of OA as a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting the health of 
the entire body.42 Most strengths of association from our results were of similar magnitude 
with those reported in previous chronic pain studies,4, 33 which often included patients with 
fibromyalgia, low back pain, or a heterogeneous mixture of various chronic pain conditions. 
The similar patterns of association found from our study may indicate commonalities of pain 
processing that exist in different types of chronic pain diseases. Some of our study results, 
however, did differ from those of chronic pain samples previously reported. For example, 
two correlational studies found a significant direct association between mindfulness and pain 
intensity,33, 43 which was inconsistent with our study results. Because these studies included 
participants with a variety of chronic pain disease types, our disparate results may reflect 
how knee OA incorporates or expresses pain processing mechanisms in different ways.27 
Despite these differences, we speculate that the consistent pattern of association between 
mindfulness and psychological outcomes in our study imply that knee OA patients may 
benefit from mind-body interventions.

Similar to the results of other studies, of the five facets the Acting-with-Awareness,44 
Describing, and Non-judging facets showed the most significant associations with 
psychological outcomes for participants. One way that mindfulness may improve health is 
by improving the ability to be aware of the presence of pain, to be able to describe or 
mentally label observed stimuli with words, and react with less self-judgment, which can 
lead to positive pain coping habits.45, 46 However, the Observing facet was not directly 
associated with any of the outcomes investigated. This finding is consistent with previous 
research that found that the Observing subscale of the FFMQ may only be sensitive to 
changes in those who have experience in mindfulness training,33, 47 and therefore implies 
that its lack of association with health outcomes may reflect a psychometric flaw inherent in 
the FFMQ rather than a diminished role for Observation as a relevant component of the 
mindfulness construct. The differential associations found in our facet analyses support the 
assessment of mindfulness as a construct composed of related, but distinct facets. Further 
research is needed to improve and calibrate measurement tools to more accurately 
operationalize the facets of mindfulness. A greater understanding of how these facets relate

with health outcomes may inform the optimization of mind-body interventions to amplify 
the positive effects that mindfulness may have in patients with chronic pain.

In addition to its direct association on stress, the Acting-with-Awareness facet had a 
moderation effect wherein higher mindfulness was associated with lower stress at each of 
the three levels of pain. The relationship between pain and stress was weaker for those with 
higher mindfulness. Across all three levels of mindfulness, pain intensity increased as stress 
increased, but stress remained highest among those with lower levels of mindfulness. This 
finding implies that acting with awareness, or being able to attend to one's current actions, 
may attenuate the influence that chronic pain often has on stress. Because mindfulness 
appears to produce its strongest buffering effect between pain and stress when pain levels are 
low, it is possible to infer that as pain intensifies, this buffering effect decreases. Results 
from moderation analysis fall in accordance with the theory that mindfulness changes the 
relationship between a person and their pain, and agree with a cross-sectional study that also 
found that mindfulness moderated the influence of pain on psychological stress in a sample 
of 201 rheumatoid arthritis patients.48 Importantly, we speculate from our results that the 
documented consistent benefits of mind body therapies for chronic pain patients may 
partially result from improved mindfulness49, 50 Our moderation results underscore the 
importance of understanding how treatments affect the interaction of chronic pain with 
psychosocial health. By reducing the impact of pain on psychosocial health or improving 
pain coping abilities, novel treatments may indirectly treat chronic pain patients without 
necessarily reducing actual levels of pain.

The limitations of our study included the use of a cross-sectional design through which we 
are unable to make definitive conclusions about causality between mindfulness and 
parameters of health. In addition, our study sample was not an epidemiological 
representative of all chronic pain or knee OA patients, which limits generalizability. Because 
this study was a secondary analyses of data which were not collected with the primary 
purpose of addressing our investigative questions, our results should be confirmed in studies 
explicitly designed to evaluate the associations between mindfulness and health outcomes in 
knee OA patients. Another limitation may be that our usage of multiple comparisons, 
without adjusting the cutoff point for statistical significance, may have yielded false 
discoveries (Type I error). Despite these limitations, our representative sample included knee 
OA patients who are routinely seen in the clinical setting. In addition, based on the strong 
degree of significance in the associations found in our results, the potential limitation of 
calculating false statistical discoveries would not have changed our primary result: that 
mindfulness was predominantly associated with psychological outcomes in our knee OA 
patient population.

In conclusion, the results of this first study support the associations between mindfulness 
levels and psychological health outcomes for knee OA patients. The Describing, Acting-
with-Awareness, and Non-judging facets may be the most contributory elements of 
mindfulness toward affecting health outcomes, which may inform how mind-body 
interventions could enhance their health benefits in knee OA patients. Importantly, the 
moderation effect of mindfulness implies a valuable role for improving pain coping skills,

are affected by intervention, and how they should be incorporated in treatment.

Figure 1. Mindfulness (Acting-with-Awareness facet) Moderates the Influence of Pain on Stress
As pain intensity increases, stress increased across the three levels of mindfulness, but stress 
remained highest across those with lower levels of mindfulness. This finding shows that 
mindfulness may help buffer from increased perceived stress from chronic pain.
