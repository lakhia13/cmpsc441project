Abstract

Purpose:  The  aim  of  this  systematic  literature  review  was  to  describe  patient- 

reported  outcomes,  mental  health  and  caregiver  burden  in  patients  with  neo-

vascular  age- related  macular  degeneration  (nAMD)  treated  with  anti- vascular 

endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents in routine clinical practice.

Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in Embase and MEDLINE accord-

ing to pre- defined criteria.

Results: Of 856 records identified, 63 met inclusion criteria. Depression or depres-

sive symptoms were reported in up to 42% of patients with nAMD. Of 25/63 (40%) 

studies evaluating quality of life (QoL) and using various tools, eight studies re-

ported composite National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire scores 

following anti- VEGF treatment. Of these, seven reported a statistically significant 

improvement at the earliest time point measured (Month 3– 12) and approximately 

50% reported sustained QoL benefits at 12 months. In studies comparing the at-

tributed or different regimens, the most important factor from the patient's per-

spective was the likelihood that a particular regimen would maintain vision. There 

was a preference towards treat and extend, which was associated with a perceived 

reduction in patient and caregiver burden, compared to fixed dosing.

Conclusions:  A  coordinated  holistic  approach  to  patient  care  is  key  to  optimiz-

ing patient well- being as well as visual outcomes. Further research regarding the 

patient- reported impact of nAMD management outside the trial setting (particu-

larly  international  longitudinal  studies)  is  warranted.  Standardization  of  QoL 

studies  would  assist  in  establishing  whether  sustained  QoL  improvement,  rather 

than prevention of QoL decline, should be a realistic expectation of treatment of 

nAMD in the longer term.

Randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  are  the  gold 
standard  in  establishing  the  efficacy  of  a  clinical  in-
tervention;  however,  the  associated  protocols  often 
necessitate  more  involved  interactions  between  pa-
tients  and  clinical  and  administrative  staff.  This  can 
impact  the  patient  experience  compared  with  the 
interactions  that  occur  normally  in  routine  clinical 
practice (Mattson et al., 1985; Tolmie et al., 2004). It is 
also well known that real- world studies explore the ef-
fectiveness of treatments in more diverse patient pop-
ulations than are studied in RCTs (Talks et al., 2019) 
and different populations may have different perspec-
tives  of  their  disease  and  its  management.  Thus,  ex-
periences  of  patients  and  patient- reported  outcomes 
(PROs)  evaluated  in  non- interventional  studies  may 
be more similar to those in clinical practice than those 
reported in RCTs and a better reflection of real- world 
patient perspectives.

Randomized  controlled  trials  have  established  the 
efficacy  of  anti- vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)  agents  in  various  retinal  conditions,  includ-
ing  neovascular  age- related  macular  degeneration 
(nAMD),  with  an  overwhelming  improvement  in  the 
prognosis of patients affected by this chronic progres-
sive disease (Schmidt- Erfurth et al., 2014). Differences 
have  emerged  between  real- world  evidence  and  RCTs 
regarding  the  magnitude  of  functional  and  anatomic 
improvements  achieved  with  anti- VEGF  agents. 
These  have  largely  been  attributed  to  undertreatment 
in  routine  clinical  practice  (Kim  et  al.,  2016;  Okada 
et al., 2020). The recommended standard is three initial 
monthly doses, followed either by monthly dosing until 
maximum visual acuity is achieved in the case of ran-
ibizumab, or dosing every 2 months for intravitreal af-
libercept. However, in the first year of treatment, >70% 
of  treatment- naïve  patients  with  nAMD  received  ≤6 
injections  of  ranibizumab  in  the  global  LUMINOUS 
study  (Holz  et  al.,  2020)  and  approximately  70%  of 
treatment- naïve  patients  with  nAMD  received  <7  in-
jections  of  intravitreal  aflibercept  in  the  German 
PERSEUS study (Framme et al., 2018).

While  some  RCTs  have  demonstrated  that  overall 
vision- related (VR) quality of life (QoL) improves more 
often in patients treated with an anti- VEGF agent than 
in  control  groups  (Solomon  et  al.,  2019),  QoL  is  less 

commonly assessed in non- interventional studies. In an 
earlier  systematic  literature  review  (SLR)  of  real- world 
studies  (conducted  prior  to  July  2018),  only  four  real- 
world studies exploring the impact of anti- VEGF agents 
on patients' VRQoL were identified (Finger et al., 2020). 
The aim of this SLR was to expand upon, and update, 
the  previous  search  criteria  to  specifically  describe  pa-
tient experiences regarding their perceived management 
of nAMD, including anti- VEGF therapy in routine clini-
cal practice. This was assessed in terms of PRO measures 
associated  with  QoL,  the  psychosocial  and  psychologi-
cal impact of disease, and treatment burden. We aimed 
to  consolidate  information  regarding  patient  perspec-
tives  and  sought  to  explore  whether  the  improvement/
maintenance of visual acuity achieved with anti- VEGF 
agents indirectly improves patients' QoL, depression and 
anxiety.

Searches were conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed) 
and  Embase  on  27  October  2020  for  publications  up 
to that date (no other date limit). The search strategy 
and associated terms were pre- defined (Appendix S1), 
based  on  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  for  the  patient 
population,  interventions,  outcomes  and  study  de-
sign  (PICOS;  Table  1)  as  recommended  by  Cochrane 
(Higgins & Green, 2011). English full- text articles and 
non- English  articles  with  an  English  abstract,  where 
the full  text could be translated with an online transla-
tion tool, were included. A manual review of proceed-
ings from major ophthalmology conferences was also 
conducted (Appendix S1).

Results of all searches were compiled into a common 
Excel database, which was used to filter those papers that 
would be excluded as they did not meet the pre- specific 
inclusion criteria. Initially, titles and/or abstracts of re-
trieved articles were screened independently by two re-
viewers to identify those meeting inclusion criteria and 
the full texts of identified articles were then assessed in 
detail.  Disagreement  over  a  report's  eligibility  at  either 
stage  was  resolved  by  discussion  with  a  third  reviewer. 
Results are reported in line with the Preferred Reporting 
Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analyses 
(PRISMA) (http://www.prism a- state ment.org) reporting 
requirements where applicable.

The search identified 856 records. After removing du-
plicates from PubMed/Embase searches, 810 titles and 
abstracts were examined and 134 articles were selected 
for full- text review. A further 76 records were excluded 
(per exclusion criteria) on evaluation of full text. Four 
conference  abstracts  from  2018  onwards  were  identi-
fied  from  Embase  searches  and  supplemented  with  a 
further  five  conference  abstracts  identified  through 
manual  searches.  Thus,  this  systematic  review  inte-
grated the findings from a total of 54 full- text articles 
and nine conference abstracts (Figure 1; Table S1).

The  articles  mostly  reported  research  from  single- 
centre  studies  (>50%)  and  the  majority  of  studies  were 
conducted in Western Europe, North America, Australia 
or Japan. The majority of reports focused on either QoL 
(n  =  25)  or  mental  health  (n  =  13).  Key  PRO  measures 
used  are  summarized  briefly  in  Table  S2.  In  addition, 
there  were  12  articles  (3  conference  abstracts)  report-
ing  relevant  patient  perspectives  that  were  not  specifi-
cally  focusing  on  our  research  topics  of  interest.  They 
included,  for  example,  reasons  for  non- persistence  on 
therapy, which have been reviewed extensively elsewhere 
(Ehlken  et  al.,  2020),  and  qualitative  descriptive  stud-
ies. The studies are cited in Table S1, but not discussed 
further.

3.1 

|  QoL and VRQoL

Of  the  25  articles/abstracts  evaluating  QoL  (Table  S1), 
10  did  not  report  longitudinal  data  on  the  poten-
tial  effects  of  anti- VEGF  treatment  on  QoL  (Casten 
et  al.,  2010;  Muzyka- Wozniak  et  al.,  2011;  Matamoros 
et  al.,  2015;  Wang  et  al.,  2015;  Bertelmann  et  al.,  2016; 
Gohil et al., 2016; Pentek et al., 2017; Bobykin et al., 2018; 

Dougherty et al., 2018; Spooner et al., 2018). Of the re-
maining 15 studies, only four (Finger et al., 2013; Finger 
et al., 2014; Inoue et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2017) had been 
identified in the previous SLR (Finger et al., 2020).

3.2 

|  National Eye Institute VFQ- 25

Of the 15 reports evaluating QoL before and after anti- 
VEGF  treatment,  12  used  the  National  Eye  Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ- 25), a 25- 
item  questionnaire  representing  11  vision- related  sub-
scales, plus an additional single- item general health rating 
question (Table S2). Two studies did not report change in 
composite NEI VFQ- 25 score, and Schroeder et al only 
reported  composite  score  change  after  >3 years'  follow-
 up (Schroeder et al., 2017). For the other nine reports of 
eight study populations, all except one (Bian et al., 2020) 
described  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in 
composite NEI VFQ- 25 score at the earliest time point 
measured  after  baseline:  1  month  (Finger  et  al.,  2013); 
3  months  (Frennesson  et  al.,  2010;  Inoue  et  al.,  2014; 
Jelin et al., 2018; Jelin et al., 2019) and 6 months (Rakic 
et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017; Gomi et al., 2019). In three 
studies, the early improvement in composite NEI VFQ- 
25  score  was  maintained  during  longer- term  follow- up 
at 12 months (Inoue et al., 2014; Gomi et al., 2019; Jelin 
et  al.,  2019);  in  two  other  studies,  it  was  not  (Finger 
et al., 2013; Rakic et al., 2013).

Bian et al. found that both visual acuity in the treated 
eye and overall best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA) cor-
related  significantly  with  the  NEI  VFQ- 25  composite 
score at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months (Bian et al., 2020). 
This  was  consistent  with  previous,  smaller  studies, 
which  reported  better  visual  function  scores  associ-
ated with higher NEI VFQ- 25 scores (Inoue et al., 2014; 
Wang et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017). In one of the larger

Japanese studies (N = 576), Gomi et al. showed no signif-
icant differences between subgroups in improvements in 
NEI VFQ- 25 scores according to male/female sex, lesion 
subtype, unilateral/bilateral disease, disease duration or 
treatment history (Gomi et al., 2019).

Inconsistent improvements in one or more of the NEI 
VFQ- 25 subscales were reported across various studies 
(Table  2).  Changes  in  the  NEI  VFQ- 25  mental  health 
subscale are included in the section ‘Effect of anti- VEGF 
treatment on anxiety and depression’. For the other sub-
scales, no clear trends were observed.

3.3 
QoL measures

The  Impact  of  Visual  Impairment  (IVI)  and  Macular 
disease  Dependent  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire 
(MacDQoL) also assessed QoL in patients with nAMD 
treated with anti- VEGF agents (Table 3).

The IVI was evaluated in two studies (Finger et al., 2014; 
Fenwick  et  al.,  2018).  Fenwick  et  al.  showed  a  positive 
effect  of  anti- VEGF  treatment  on  the  three  subscales 
of  the  measure  (Reading  and  Accessing  Information, 
Mobility  and  Independence,  and  Emotional  Well- being) 
from baseline to 12 months (n = 116). Finger et al. did not 
demonstrate  a  significant  change  from  baseline  at  6  or 
12 months for the IVI subscales in their overall population 

of  treatment- naïve  patients  (n  =  169);  however,  patients 
who lost >2 lines reported significantly worse VRQoL at 
12 months  on  the  Accessing  Information  and  Mobility 
subscales and those who gained >2 lines reported signifi-
cantly better VRQoL on the Accessing Information and 
Emotional Well- being subscales.

Macular  disease  Dependent  Quality  of  Life 
in  one  study 
Questionnaire  score  was  evaluated 
(Marakis et al., 2018). In this study, there was a signifi-
cant increase in Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire  score  after  12 months'  anti- VEGF  treat-
ment,  which  showed  significant  correlations  with  the 
MacDQoL  score,  as  well  as  the  score  of  the  generic 
health measure, the 12- Item Short Form Health Survey. 
A summary of the limited findings assessing QoL with 
other generic measures is included in the Appendix S1.

3.4 

|  Mental health

The  systematic  literature  review  identified  eight  pub-
lished  articles  reporting  results  of  the  mental  health 
subscale on the NEI VFQ- 25 in patients receiving anti- 
VEGF  treatment.  Thirteen  published  articles  and  four 
conference  abstracts  evaluating  mental  health  were  as-
sessed  using  other  tools  or  methods  (Table  4).  Most 
studies  were  cross- sectional,  reporting  the  prevalence 
of  anxiety  and  depression  according  to  various  tools/

measures,  and  the  association  between  anxiety/depres-
sion and other patient/disease characteristics.

|  Prevalence of anxiety and depression 

3.5 
in nAMD

In a recent large (n = 547) Australian multicentre study of 
patients with nAMD receiving anti- VEGF agents, 42% of 
individuals had depressive symptoms, as assessed by the 
Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression 10- point 
scale and 32% had depressive symptoms as assessed by 
the Mental Health Index component of the 36- item Short 
Form Survey (Vu et al., 2021). Furthermore, data from 
Jaffe et al. show wide variation in the prevalence of self- 
reported anxiety and depression in the European Union 
(15%  and  8%  respectively)  compared  with  the  United 
States  (26%  and  18%  respectively)  (Jaffe  et  al.,  2018). 
These two studies highlight the importance of the assess-
ment tool being used and that incidence data are likely 
impacted  by  regional  and  cultural  influences,  respec-
tively, indicating that anxiety and depression prevalence 
data should not be compared across studies in different 
regions or using different tools/measures.

The  prevalence  of  depression  assessed  using  the 
Geriatric  Depression  scale  was  26%  in  patients  with 
nAMD  receiving  anti- VEGF  treatment  in  Korea  (Lee 
et al., 2013); 20% of patients in the United States had clin-
ically significant depressive symptoms according to the 
Patient Health Questionnaire 9, which combines scores 
for  each  of  the  nine  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual 
of Mental Disorders criteria (Casten et al., 2010); and, in 
the  United  Kingdom,  17%  and  12%  of  patients  showed 
clinical levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, as 
evaluated  using  the  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression 
Scale (HADS) (Senra et al., 2017).

|  Anxiety and depression risk factors 

3.6 
in nAMD

While  there  was  a  lack  of  consistent  evidence  as  to 
whether depression was a predictor of NEI VFQ- 25 total 
scores  (Casten  et  al.,  2010;  Bian  et  al.,  2020),  positive 
correlations between depression scores on the Geriatric 
Depression  Scale  and  age,  visual  acuity  of  either  the 
treated or better eye, duration of nAMD and the num-
ber of previous treatments for nAMD have been found 
(Lee et al., 2013). In several studies, the major sources of 
anxiety for patients with nAMD were related to fear of 
losing eyesight because of disease activity and/or prog-
nosis,  or  concerns  about  the  effectiveness  of  treatment 
(Droege et al., 2013; Senra et al., 2017; Giocanti- Auregan 
et al., 2018; Yiallouridou et al., 2020). In a German study, 
>60% of patients were anxious about examination results 
regarding disease activity (Droege et al., 2013) and in a 
UK  study,  30– 40%  of  patients  reported  fears  relating 
to  disease  progression  and/or  vision  worsening  (Senra 
et  al.,  2017).  When  evaluated,  anxiety  scores  did  not 
seem to be affected by employment status (Kayikcioglu 
et  al.,  2017);  however,  conflicting  results  have  been 
seen for the impact of sex on anxiety (Segal et al., 2016; 

Kayikcioglu et al., 2017). Kayikcioglu et al. did not find 
a difference between the state and trait anxiety scores of 
men and women with nAMD in Turkey, whereas Segal 
et al. found that, in Israel, women were statistically more 
anxious than men, as evaluated using a visual analogue 
scale.

In some studies, a minority of patients— <10% (Muller 
et al., 2017), 16% (Casten et al., 2010) and 19% (Droege 
et  al.,  2013)— reported  some  anxiety  or  stress  related 
to  the  injection,  and  in  others,  there  were  higher  rates 
(~50%) of anxiety reported (Kandula et al., 2010; Senra 
et  al.,  2017).  When  evaluated,  the  level  of  anxiety  ap-
peared to be linked to intravitreal injection pain (Segal 
et al., 2016; Mbekeani et al., 2020) and disturbed sleep as-
sociated with injections has also recently been suggested 
as  affecting  some  patients  (Yiallouridou  et  al.,  2020). 
A  survey  of  ophthalmologists  proposed  that  treat- and- 
extend (T&E) dosing may allow the patient to better pre-
pare mentally for injection appointments, versus pro re 
nata (PRN) regimens (Iida & Ishii, 2016), as their injec-
tion schedule is determined months ahead.

Despite  the  interventional  nature  of  an  intravitreal 
injection,  qualitative  studies  report  that  patients  ex-
pressed  willingness  to  continue  treatment  and  recog-
nized injections as their only option to preserve eyesight 
(Yiallouridou et al., 2020). Chua et al. evaluated patient 
perceptions  immediately  before  and  2 weeks  after  anti- 
VEGF  therapy,  reporting  that  patients  found  intravit-
real injections less fearful than they expected and >90% 
were not anxious having had their first injection (Chua 
et  al.,  2009).  However,  other  studies  have  shown  that 
anxiety levels were generally similar between treatment- 
naïve and previously treated patients (Segal et al., 2016; 
Kayikcioglu et al., 2017).

|  Effect of anti- VEGF treatment on 

3.7 
anxiety and depression

There was a paucity of data that specifically evaluated 
whether treatment with anti- VEGF agents had any indi-
rect impact on the aspects of mental health. Data were, 
however, reported for the mental health subscale of the 
NEI VFQ- 25 (Table 2) in eight studies (Rakic et al., 2013; 
Rung & Lovestam- Adrian, 2013; Inoue et al., 2014; van 
Asten et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017; Gomi et al., 2019; Jelin 
et al., 2019; Bian et al., 2020). Two of these studies (van 
Asten et al., 2015; Bian et al., 2020), one of which reported 
a stabilization of BCVA, but not statistically significant 
improvement (van Asten et al., 2015), did not show a posi-
tive improvement in the mental health subscale. All other 
studies  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement, 
as  early  as  Month  3  (Rung  &  Lovestam- Adrian,  2013; 
Inoue  et  al.,  2014),  at  Month  6  (Rakic  et  al.,  2013;  Zhu 
et  al.,  2017;  Gomi  et  al.,  2019)  and/or  Month  12  (Inoue 
et al., 2014; Gomi et al., 2019; Jelin et al., 2019).

Only two other studies (Kato et al., 2018; Kuwayama 
et al., 2019; Bian et al., 2020) assessed whether treatment 
with anti- VEGF agents had any indirect impact on symp-
toms of anxiety and depression using instruments other 
than the NEI VFQ subscale (both used HADS; Table 4).

symptoms was 42% and 32% per the CES- D- 10 
and MHI scales respectively.

Poor self- rated health was associated with 
increased odds of depressive symptoms 
(multivariable- adjusted OR: 3.00 [95% CI 
1.90– 4.73] for CES- D- 10; OR: 2.67 [95% CI 
1.67– 4.28] for MHI).

Impaired activities of daily living (multivariable- 
adjusted OR: 2.62 [95% CI 1.56– 4.38] for 
CES- D- 10; OR: 3.59 [95% CI 2.10– 6.15] for 
MHI) and a visual function score within the 
two lowest quartiles were also associated with 
increased odds of depressive symptoms using 
both scales.

HADS: Prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety and 
depression were 17% and 12%, respectively, per 
the HADS.

Depression levels, but not anxiety, were 

significantly higher in patients who received 
up to three injections compared with patients 
who received between four and 12 injections 
(p = 0.027) and compared with patients who 
received more than 12 injections (p < 0.001).
Patients' main concerns and sources of anxiety 

related to anti- VEGF treatment were: fear of 
the injection/needle causing damage (39%), 
fear of disease/vision getting worse (37%), 
anxiety waiting in the clinic prior to the 
appointment (35%) and fear of the unknown 
in relation to treatment outcomes and disease 
progression (30%). Anxiety regarding injection 
pain was infrequently raised (3%).

<10% of patients definitely agreed with the 
statement ‘I am afraid of intravitreal 
injections’ or ‘I am afraid of the risk of 
infection due to intravitreal injections’; ~30% 
of patients definitely agreed with the statement 
‘I was afraid of examination results regarding 
disease activity’.

|  Impact of different regimens on patients' 

3.8 
experiences

Three  studies  (one  each  from  Germany,  Japan  and  the 
United  States)  reported  patients'  perspectives  of  differ-
ent  regimens  (Droege  et  al.,  2014;  Bhagat  et  al.,  2020; 
Joko et al., 2020), one Japanese study reported the phy-
sicians'  understanding  of  patient  perspectives  (Iida  & 
Ishii 2016) and another Japanese study reported caregiv-
ers' perspectives (Hanemoto et al., 2017).

The earliest study was conducted in 2014 and identi-
fied two separate groups of patients; one that preferred 
dosing PRN and the other that preferred fixed monthly 
dosing  (Droege  et  al.,  2014).  The  preference  for  a  reg-
imen  was  not  correlated  with  parameters  investigated 
(number  of  injections,  therapy  duration,  age  or  sex). 
More  recently,  in  a  discrete- choice  experiments,  most 
patients preferred T&E because of its higher chance of 
2- year maintenance of visual acuity (Joko et al., 2020). 
Indeed, while patients preferred a less frequent injection 
schedule  (Bhagat  et  al.,  2020;  Joko  et  al.,  2020)  some 
patients were willing to accept less desirable treatment 
attributes,  such  as  increased  cost  (Bhagat  et  al.,  2020) 
and/or  injection  frequency  (Bhagat  et  al.,  2020;  Joko 
et al., 2020) in order to achieve superior vision outcomes.
Iida and Ishii assessed ophthalmologists' perspectives 
of T&E vs PRN dosing for the patient (Iida & Ishii, 2016). 
Concerns regarding T&E regimens were increased finan-
cial  burden  (when  number  of  injections  increases)  and 
worry about complications (risk of infections). Benefits 
of T&E compared with PRN from the patient/caregiver 
perspective, as understood by the treating  ophthalmol-
ogist, were ability to tangibly experience treatment effi-
cacy  through  injection  interval,  decreases  in  emotional 
burden  associated  with  receiving  intraocular  injections 
and decreases in patient/caregiver time.

3.9 

|  Caregiver burden

Seven  studies  reported  disease- associated  burden  di-
rectly from the caregivers themselves (Gohil et al., 2015; 
Varano  et  al.,  2015;  Varano  et  al.,  2016;  Hanemoto 
et al., 2017; Muller et al., 2017; Senra et al., 2017; Spooner 
et al., 2018; Gopinath et al., 2019) and two studies report-
ing  caregiver  burden  from  the  perspectives  of  patients 
(Varano et al., 2015; Joko et al., 2020). However, none of 
the studies provided insight into caregiver burden before, 
compared with during or after, anti- VEGF treatment.

The largest study identified was the international wet 
AMD  Patient  and  Caregiver  Survey  conducted  in  nine 
countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy,  Japan,  Spain  and  the  United  Kingdom)  (Varano 
et  al.,  2015;  Varano  et  al.,  2016).  This  cross- sectional 
survey  included  910  patients  with  an  existing  nAMD 
diagnosis  who  received  current  or  prior  anti- VEGF  in-
jections,  and  890  caregivers  (mainly  child/grandchild 
[47%] or partner [23%] of the patient) and used a 29- item, 
self- administered  questionnaire  to  assess  the  impact  of 
caregiving on several domains, including psychological 
well- being,  social  activities  and  retirement  plans.  Most 
caregivers  always  attended  appointments  (>60%)  and 
were  involved  in  discussions  about  treatment  (>80%); 
many caregivers (>30%) were able to reduce the level of 
domestic  assistance  provided  after  the  patient  started 
treatment;  however,  up  to  30%  of  caregivers  reported 
that  frequent  appointments  were  inconvenient  (Varano 
et al., 2015). Although the study reported on the impact 
of the disease, rather than any impact (positive or nega-
tive) of anti- VEGF treatment, it does highlight the vari-
ation in burden of disease which will invariably impact 
the need for caregiver support. For example: depending 
on  the  population,  patients  who  could  not  drive  any-
more ranged from ~10% to ~50%; patients who reported 
difficulties in reading ranged from ~40% to ~80%; and 
the  need  for  help  with  reading  (directly  from  the  care-
giver  perspective)  ranged  from  ~25%  to  ~80%  (Varano 
et al., 2016).

Other insights are gained from smaller studies. In one 
study  in  the  United  Kingdom  (n  =  250),  burden  evalu-
ated  on  the  Caregiver  Reaction  Assessment  Scale  was 
similar  to  individuals  caring  for  patients  with  atrial 
fibrillation  who  require  regular  hospital  monitoring

of  thromboprophylaxis  (Gohil  et  al.,  2015).  In  another 
(n  =  100  caregivers),  approximately  75%  of  caregivers 
reported  little  or  no  burden  associated  with  support-
ing  patients  with  nAMD,  as  evaluated  on  the  Burden 
Assessment  Scale  (Senra  et  al.,  2017).  Patient's  visual 
acuity  in  the  better  eye  was  identified  as  impacting 
caregiver burden (Gohil et al., 2015); however, as ~50% 
of the patients in this study had visual acuity of 74 let-
ters (Snellen 6/12) or better in the better- seeing eye, the 
authors  suggested  that  either  visual  acuity  score  is  not 
an accurate measure of visual morbidity, or that visual 
acuity is not the most significant factor in determining 
caregiver burden.

The  need  to  attend  hospital  appointments  was  iden-
tified in various studies as an important contributor to 
caregiver burden (Gohil et al., 2015; Varano et al., 2015; 
Spooner  et  al.,  2018).  Approximately  two- thirds  of  pa-
tients  required  an  accompanying  person  for  travel  to/
from the clinic (Droege et al., 2013; Varano et al., 2015; 
Muller et al., 2017). A caregiver's inability to accompany 
the  patient  to  an  appointment  was  also  reported  to  be 
a  contributor  to  non- adherence  (Varano  et  al.,  2015). 
Compared with PRN dosing, a T&E regimen was asso-
ciated with a reduction in caregiver burden, in part due 
to the time and costs associated with fewer hospital visits 
(Hanemoto et al., 2017).

The importance of patient- focussed research has become 
increasingly recognized in recent years; however, previ-
ous  research  has  shown  that,  in  RCTs  in  patients  with 
nAMD, investigators rarely measure and report patient 
perspectives  such  as  the  effects  of  anti- VEGF  agents 
on  QoL  or  other  patient- reported  outcome  measures 
(Solomon et al., 2019). The findings of this extensive liter-
ature review in non- interventional studies are consistent 
with this; patient perspectives are poorly represented in 
the published literature on nAMD studies. We therefore 
highlight the ongoing paucity of evidence in this impor-
tant area and encourge further initiatives to address the 
research gaps identified.

In  terms  of  VRQoL,  this  systematic  review  expands 
on  that  published  in  2020,  which  included  four  studies 
(Finger  et  al.,  2020)  and  includes  the  findings  of  a  fur-
ther  14  reports.  The  manner  in  which  data  related  to 
patient- relevant  outcomes  were  collected  and  reported 
was  highly  heterogenous.  Various  tools  were  used  and, 
in  most  cases,  these  tools  have  not  been  specifically 
validated for use in patients with nAMD. The most ap-
parent  finding  was  that  QoL,  as  measured  by  the  NEI 
VFQ- 25,  appeared  to  improve  from  baseline  early  in 
patients treated with anti- VEGF agents and that better 
visual  acuity  was  associated  with  higher  NEI  VFQ- 25 
total scores. Longer- term gains compared with baseline 
were not consistently observed, but data interpretation is 
complicated by the lack of a control group.

Here,  we  identified  the  primary  challenge  when  at-
tempting to assess the effect of a treatment intervention 
on QoL in routine clinical practice: in non- interventional 
studies, the comparison for our treatment arm can only 

come from other published studies of similar populations 
without  the  treatment  of  interest.  Historical  controls 
from MARINA with sham injections show that QoL de-
creases  over  a  2- year  period  (Bressler  et  al.,  2010),  and 
so it could be argued that, beyond Year 1, maintainance 
of  baseline  QoL  levels  (rather  than  sustained  improve-
ments  in  QoL)  may  be  a  more  appropriate  anti- VEGF 
treatment goal for patients with nAMD.

One of the major challenges when investigating qual-
ity of life in any condition is how well the tool being used 
performs  in  the  population  of  interest.  Generic  mea-
sures  may  not  focus  sufficiently  on  the  aspects  of  the 
disease  that  are  impacting  the  patient  and  specifically 
the  performance  of  the  EQ- 5D  health- related  assess-
ment instrument has been shown to be poor in patients 
with  nAMD  (Tosh  et  al.,  2012).  In  terms  of  therapy- 
area  specific  tools,  the  NEI  VFQ- 25  was  developed 
over  20 years  ago  and  is  generally  considered  the  best 
validated  of  the  tools  for  use  in  ophthalmic  conditions 
(Finger  et  al.,  2008).  However,  Marella  et  al  have  sug-
gested that the NEI VFQ- 25 questionnaire items may ac-
tually be measuring two different underlying constructs, 
one related to visual functioning and another to socio- 
emotional  status  (Marella  et  al.,  2010).  This  is  import-
ant, as it would suggest that the single composite score is 
not reliable and larger subscales or summated subscales 
should be used. It was hoped that disease- specific QoL 
instruments might better describe important dimensions 
of VRQoL in nAMD. However, developing such tools is 
not without its complications and, like the NEI VFQ- 25, 
the  MacDQoL  questionnaire  is  also  undesirably  multi- 
dimensional (Finger et al., 2012).

Optimal  patient  management,  in  any  condition, 
should  take  a  holistic  approach.  However,  there  is  rel-
atively  scarce  information  as  to  what  this  should  com-
prise specifically in an individual with nAMD. There is 
little  in  the  medical  literature  advocating  a  multidisci-
plinary approach despite evidence that >80% of patients 
have  five  or  more  comorbidities  (Zlateva  et  al.,  2007). 
Communication  and  co- created  treatment  goal- setting 
is  obviously  key,  but  can  be  complicated  by  hearing 
and/or cognitive impairment in this elderly population. 
Additionally,  while  several  recent  studies  have  investi-
gated the effect of the COVID- 19 pandemic on treatment 
regimens and vision in nAMD (Arruabarrena et al., 2021; 
Bulut et al., 2021; Weng et al., 2021), we should also re-
member the impact of the recent pandemic on the mental 
health of our patients and our ability to provide the re-
quired level of physician– patient interaction.

There  is  increasing  acceptance  that,  despite  new 
pharmacologic  treatments,  depression  and  anxiety  are 
common  in  patients  with  nAMD.  However,  from  the 
published  data,  there  is  no  clear  or  strong  evidence  of 
positive or negative changes in the extent of depression 
or  anxiety  in  patients  with  nAMD  treated  with  anti- 
VEGF agents. It could be proposed that positive effects 
of  anti- VEGF  treatment  on  visual  acuity  would  result 
in  indirect,  positive  effects  on  depressive  symptoms. 
However, the data do not consistently support this, pos-
sibly because of various confounding factors impacting 
patients' mental health. One of the major factors impact-
ing a patient's mental health appears to be the emotional 

GALE et al. 
 
burden  associated  with  the  chronic,  progressive  nature 
of the disease and chronic nature of the treatment. This 
is exemplified by a German study (Droege et al., 2013), 
where >60% of patients were anxious about examination 
results  regarding  disease  activity,  whereas  <20%  were 
afraid of intravitreal injections. Although patients would 
prefer not to have intravitreal injections, the impression 
from  the  data  is  that  this  is  a  burden  that  patients  are 
willing to accept to optimize visual outcomes. As long as 
vision is maintained with anti- VEGF treatment, studies 
indicate  that  patients  prefer  a  T&E  regimen  due  to  the 
reduced burden and increase in the certainty of the in-
jection schedule.

The  perception  of  caregiver  burden  appears  to  be 
influenced  by  cultural/geographic 
‘norms’  though 
there are no data measuring  the effects  of  anti- VEGF 
treatment  on  caregiver  burden  over  time.  This  lack 
of  longitudinal  data,  therefore,  means  that  the  find-
ings  described  show  only  a  point- in- time  assessment. 
Additionally,  we  did  not  find  any  studies  comparing 
the perspectives of the patient with either those of their 
carer or physician. Since a disconnect between patient 
and physician perspectives has been identified in vari-
ous other therapy areas (such as neurology, respiratory 
medicine and rheumatology [Husni et al., 2018; Maher 
et al., 2018; Hermanowicz et al., 2019]), it would be in-
teresting  for  research  efforts  to  investigate  this  topic 
further in ophthalmology.

The main strength of this literature review is its com-
prehensiveness, driven by broad search terms, without 
a  limit  on  dates.  Despite  this,  many  of  the  evaluated 
studies  did  not  meet  the  search  criteria,  demonstrat-
ing the paucity of data to address the specific research 
questions.  Consequently,  all  studies  were  included, 
without  eligibility  criteria  based  on  study  size,  or  an 
assessment of quality of controls for biases. Thus, one 
of  the  limitations  of  our  review  is  that  the  findings 
are  based  mostly  on  single- centre  studies,  which  were 
often  relatively  small  (<100  patients).  Also,  evidence 
was geographically limited— mainly to North America 
and Western Europe, with some studies from Australia 
and  Asia  (primarily  Japan).  Indeed,  data  on  patient 
perspectives  from  observational  studies  in  countries, 
such  as  those  in  Africa,  Central/Eastern  Europe  and 
South  America,  are  particularly  needed.  It  is  highly 
likely  that  patient  experiences  regarding  the  manage-
ment of nAMD in lower- income countries are likely to 
be impacted by additional factors related to access to 
treatment,  healthcare  organization  and  general  infra-
structure considerations.

In conclusion, we find that the heterogeneity of how 
QoL and other patient- relevant concepts were evaluated 
highlights  the  need  for  a  standardized  approach  if  evi-
dence is to be consolidated and results from individual 
studies  in  patients  with  nAMD  are  to  be  more  easily 
compared.  There  is  relatively  consistent  evidence  sug-
gesting  that  intravitreal  anti- VEGF  injections  result  in 
improved QoL following treatment in clinical practice of 
patients with nAMD. Some QoL improvements are sus-
tained  at  1  year;  however,  it  remains  to  be  established 
whether sustained improvement in QoL should be a re-
alistic expectation of anti- VEGF treatment, particularly

in the longer term. In nAMD, it appears that depression 
and  anxiety  have  complex  and  nuanced  origins,  rather 
than  being  simply  related  to  anti- VEGF  injections  or 
poor vision alone. Overall, more robust research in each 
of  these  areas  is  warranted  and  a  coordinated,  holistic 
approach to patient care and patient/physician dialogue 
is key to optimizing the likelihood of patient well- being, 
as well as improvements in visual outcome.
