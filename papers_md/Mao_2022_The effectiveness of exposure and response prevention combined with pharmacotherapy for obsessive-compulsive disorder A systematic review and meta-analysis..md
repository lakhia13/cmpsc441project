Objective: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of exposure and
response prevention (ERP) combined with medication on obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD).

Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane, Embase, and Science
Direct databases were searched to include randomized controlled trials of
ERP combined with medication for OCD that met the criteria. The Yale Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Scale was used as the primary outcome indicator, and
Depression scales were used as secondary outcome indicators. An evaluation
of bias risk was conducted to identify possible sources of bias based on
methodological and clinical factors. Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 16.0
software was used to perform meta-analysis of the extracted data.

Results: A total of 21 studies with 1113 patients were included. Meta-
analysis showed that ERP combined with medication therapy was signiﬁcantly
better than medication therapy alone including selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, clomipramine and risperidone (MD = –6.60, 95% CI: –8.35 to –4.84,
P < 0.00001), but D-cycloserine (DCS) drugs do not enhance the effect of ERP
intervention in patients with OCD (MD = 0.15, 95% CI: –0.87 to 1.17, P = 0.77).
There is more signiﬁcant maintenance by combined treatment method of
medication plus ERP than medication treatment alone during the follow-up
period (MD = –7.14, 95% CI: –9.17 to –5.10, P < 0.00001). DCS drugs did not
enhance the effect of ERP intervention on depression in patients with OCD
(SMD = –0.08, 95% CI: –0.31 to 0.15, P = 0.50). ERP combined with drug
improved patients’ depression levels signiﬁcantly better than providing drug
alone (SMD = –0.40, 95% CI: –0.68 to –0.11, P = 0.006).

Conclusion: Patients with OCD have signiﬁcant improvement in symptoms
of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression when ERP is combined
with medication, however, not enough to prove that DCS can enhance
ERP effectiveness.

Introduction

Selective

including ﬂuoxetine, paroxetine,

in a timely manner is crucial
serotonin reuptake

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychological
disorder characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts and
repetitive behaviors, which is frequently accompanied by
anxiety or depression and has a lifetime prevalence of 2–
4% (1). OCD is commonly detected at a late stage, and the
longer untreated obsessive-compulsive
symptoms persist,
the less eﬀective treatment and relapse prevention become
(2). Therefore, ﬁnding an eﬀective treatment and receiving
for
appropriate treatment
inhibitors
OCD patients.
(SSRIs)
and
ﬂuvoxamine are the ﬁrst-line pharmacological
treatments
for OCD (3). However, only 40–60% of patients treated
with SSRIs experienced a reduction in their obsessive-
compulsive symptoms (4). Although tricyclic drugs (e.g.,
Chlorpromazine, Clomipramine, etc.) have better eﬃcacy
than SSRIs, their side eﬀects are more pronounced and less
endurable (5). Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is
the ﬁrst-line psychotherapy for OCD, and research indicates
ERP-based therapy has comparable eﬃcacy to SSRIs (4).
Notwithstanding, the eﬃcacy of ERP for OCD is highly variable,
with approximately 25% of patients dropping out, 60% of
patients recovering, and 25% of patients being successfully
treated and cured (6).

sertraline,

In the clinical treatment of OCD, choosing medication
or psychotherapy based on time and ﬁnancial costs is a
decision that patients need to consider. In order to achieve
the best treatment outcome, it is more eﬀective to combine
psychotherapy and medication. For patients with mild or
moderate symptoms, cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT)
including ERP or SSRIs can be used alone, whereas CBT
combined with SSRIs is recommended for patients with
more severe or resistant conditions (7, 8). CBT combined
with medication has
in the
shown better
clinical treatment of OCD, with all combined eﬀect sizes
at moderate to high levels (9). However,
it has also been
found that the eﬃcacy achieved with the combination of

interventions

tuberculosis

sertraline and CBT was not sustained long-term, and that
at 52 weeks, sertraline monotherapy was the most eﬀective
and cost-eﬀective treatment (10). D-cycloserine (DCS) is a
partial N-methyl-D-aspartic acid agonist
that was initially
utilized to treat
(11). Researchers began to
wonder whether DCS enhances exposure-based CBT based on
the positive eﬀects observed in animal studies investigating
the fear-elimination paradigm. However, results were mixed
(11). It is unclear whether DCS, as a novel clinical trial
drug, will enhance the eﬀectiveness of ERP treatment for
patients with OCD.

Current

studies have

examined CBT combination
pharmacotherapy for OCD (4, 12, 13). However,
these
studies have actually evaluated the eﬀects of mixed forms
therapy,
including cognitive therapy, behavioral
of CBT,
and the combination of ERP and cognitive therapy. The
study by Ost et al. (13) included 7 cognitive treatments with
no components of ERP and 13 combinations of cognitive
therapy and ERP. Nevertheless, ERP and cognitive therapy
are essentially diﬀerent theoretical underpinnings (7). Some
variants of ERP include informal cognitive techniques (for
instance, cognitive restructuring during exposures) and some
forms of cognitive therapy include informal exposures (e.g.,
behavioral experiments that test the validity of the patient’s
obsessional beliefs), blurring the distinction between these
treatments (14). Cognitive therapy focuses on correcting
dysfunctional beliefs about the existence or signiﬁcance of
intrusive thoughts, and its behavioral experiments were used
to identify and modify patients’ irrational beliefs, rather than
repeatedly confronting anxiety-provoking situations, as in ERP
(15). As previous Meta-analyses have primarily focused on
any form of CBT combination therapy rather than speciﬁcally
ERP, their ﬁnal eﬀect sizes may be attributable to therapy
overlaps. Moreover, major depressive disorder is the most
common comorbid diagnosis of OCD (16). In this study, a
Meta-analysis was therefore conducted on the intervention
eﬀects of ERP combined with pharmacological treatment on
obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptoms in patients with
OCD, providing a foundation for future clinical application.

Methods

Search

PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane, Embase,
and Science Direct were searched from build to May 1,
2022. The search term 1 was (exposure response prevention
OR exposure and ritual prevention OR ERP OR EXRP)
AND (obsessive-compulsive disorder OR obsessive compulsive
disorder OR OCD). Search term 2 was (exposure OR ERP
OR EXRP) AND (obsessive-compulsive disorder OR obsessive
compulsive disorder OR OCD) AND (Randomized OR RCT OR
RCTs OR random).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion, screening, and exclusion criteria for the articles
were developed in accordance with the PRISMA statement
and PICOS principles. Inclusion criteria: (i) Study design
(S): randomized controlled trials (RCT) (ii) Study Population
(P): studies involving patients with comorbid disorders were
considered as long as the primary diagnosis of OCD was present.
(iii) Interventions (I): the experimental group received ERP
combined with pharmacological intervention. (iv) Comparison
(C):
the control group received ERP or pharmacological
intervention alone. (v) Outcome indicators (O): The Yale
Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score was used
as the primary outcome indicator, and the secondary outcome
indicators included Depression scales.

Exclusion criteria:

(i) duplicate publications,

(ii) not
empirical research, (iii) not ERP interventions, (iv) no control
groups, (v) not OCD, (vi) review article, (vii) conference
abstract, (viii) not RCT, (ix) missing data, (x) not ERP combined
with pharmacological
intervention, (xi) not Y-BOCS, and
(xii) reused data.

Risk of bias and data extraction

The risk of bias evaluation of ﬁnal included studies was
conducted by two psychology master students according to the
Cochrane Handbook version 5.0.1. The assessment included
following 7 aspects: (i) random sequence generation; (ii)
allocation protocol concealment; (iii) blinding of participants
and trial personnel; (iv) blinding of outcome assessment; (v)
completeness of outcome data; (vi) selective reporting of results;
(vii) other biases. The evaluators judged the above 7 aspects as
“low bias,” “high bias,” and “unclear,” respectively, and asked a
third psychology master student to discuss the evaluation when
there was a dispute.

Data were extracted from the ﬁnal included articles, mainly
including (i) the ﬁrst author, year of publication, and nationality

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.973838

of
the articles, (ii) the sample size, gender, and age of
the experimental and control groups, (iii) the interventions,
intervention duration and follow-up time of the experimental
and control groups, and (iv) Mean (M) and Standard Deviations
(SD) used for the outcome indicators.

Statistical analysis

the ﬁxed-eﬀects model assumes that

Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 16.0 software was used
to conduct Meta-analysis on the extracted data. Firstly, the
size of heterogeneity among the studies was judged. In Meta-
analysis,
the studies
are homogeneous, while the random-eﬀects model assumes
heterogeneity between studies (17). I2-statistic reﬂects the
proportion of the heterogeneity component in the total variance
of the eﬀect size, and I2-statistic > 50% indicates relatively
substantial heterogeneity (18). If P ≥ 0.1 and I2-statistic < 50%,
the ﬁxed-eﬀect model was used; if P < 0.1 and I2-statistic ≥ 50%,
the random-eﬀect model was used; when the heterogeneity
was more obvious, Sensitivity analysis, Meta-regression analyses
and Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the source of
heterogeneity. Statistical analyses were performed using Mean
Diﬀerent (MD) if the outcome indicators were measured with
the same instrument, and Standardized Mean Diﬀerent (SMD)
if the measurement instruments were diﬀerent. The outcome
indicators were statistically analyzed using 95% Conﬁdence
Interval (95% CI) and P < 0.05 indicates that the diﬀerence is
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

Article screening process and results

The search yielded 4,697 relevant articles, and 21 RCT
studies were ﬁnally included after duplication, reading of titles
and abstracts, and further reading of the full text to eliminate
articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The article
inclusion process and results are shown in Figure 1.

Risk of bias

The included articles were all RCT studies, and there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between experimental groups
and control groups at baseline. Nineteen studies reported
the reasons and numbers of participants who dropped out,
and 15 studies were blinded to outcome assessment. Due
to the speciﬁcity of psychotherapy, a double-blind design
was not possible, and the risk of performance bias was
high in all studies. Nine studies described the method of

The risk of bias report
means “low bias,” “-” means “high bias,” and “?” means
“unclear.”

Basic characteristics of included
articles

The 21 articles included in this study all centered on
ERP combined with medication intervention, with 7 studies
in children and adolescents and 13 studies in adults. For
the control group interventions, nine were pharmacological
and twelve were ERP interventions under placebo conditions.
Twelve studies reported follow-up data for primary outcome
indicators ranging from 1 to 12 months. In addition, 10 studies
reported no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between mixed intervention
and psychological
intervention, 2 studies reported mixed
intervention was better than psychological intervention. Six
studies reported mixed intervention was better than medication,
and 2 studies reported no diﬀerence. Basic characteristics of the
included studies are shown in Table 1.

Meta-analysis

Effect of combination therapy on
obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients
with obsessive-compulsive disorder

A total of 1,113 participants were included in the 21
studies that measured the eﬀectiveness of ERP combined with
pharmacotherapy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms as post-
treatment data. As shown in Table 2, Meta-analysis showed that
the heterogeneity I2-statistic was 86% (P < 0.00001), there were
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the combination treatment group
and the control group (MD = –3.18, 95% CI: –4.97 to –1.40,
P = 0.0005).

Publication years, intervention measures, and sample ages
were examined as potential moderators of eﬀect size. Meta-
regression analyses revealed no signiﬁcant moderation by
publication years (t = –1.09, P = 0.29) and sample ages (t = –
0.84, P = 0.41). However, intervention measures signiﬁcantly
moderated eﬀect size (t = –3.34, P = 0.004), indicating that the
type of intervention measures was the source of variation.

For heterogeneity,

the studies were classiﬁed into 2
subgroups according to the interventions in the control groups.

Effect of combination therapy on
obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients
with obsessive-compulsive disorder during
follow-up

A meta-analysis of 12 studies reporting follow-up data on
primary outcome indicators found a total of 588 subjects with
I2-statistic 80% heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.00001).
The combination treatment group had a greater eﬀect than
the control group with a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
(MD = –3.17, 95% CI: –5.66 to –0.67, P = 0.01).

For heterogeneity,

the studies were divided into two
subgroups of DCS and drug treatment, according to the control
group interventions. Subgroup analysis showed heterogeneity
between studies in the DCS group with I2-statistic = 0%
(P = 0.69). There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
long-term eﬃcacy of providing ERP treatment alone versus
combined DCS treatment in improving obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (MD = –0.30, 95% CI: –1.79 to 1.18, P = 0.69).
Heterogeneity between studies in the drug treatment group
was I2-statistic = 43% (P = 0.14). There is more signiﬁcant
maintenance of treatment eﬀects on the combined treatment
than on drug treatment alone during the follow-up period
(MD = –7.14, 95% CI: –9.17 to –5.10, P < 0.00001). There
was heterogeneity between subgroups (I2-statistic = 96.5%,
P < 0.00001), indicating that the type of control group was one
of the sources of heterogeneity in this subgroup, see Figure 4.

Effect of combination therapy on depression in
patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder

12 studies with a total of 730 subjects were included,
with heterogeneity I2-statistic = 86% (P < 0.00001). With

regard to heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis found that I2-
statistic decreased to 1% (P = 0.44) after excluding one study
(37). The diﬀerence between the combination treatment group
and the control group was signiﬁcant (SMD = –0.21, 95%
CI: –0.38 to –0.04, P = 0.02). The studies were divided into
2 subgroups of DCS and drug treatment, according to the
control group interventions, and two unclassiﬁable studies were
excluded. Subgroup analysis showed that the heterogeneity
between studies in the DCS group was I2-statistic = 0%
(P = 0.63). DCS drugs did not enhance the eﬀect of ERP
intervention on depression in patients with OCD (SMD = –
0.08, 95% CI: –0.31 to 0.15, P = 0.50). Heterogeneity between
studies in the drug treatment group was I2-statistic = 34%
(P = 0.21). ERP combined with drugs improved patients’
depression levels signiﬁcantly better than providing medication
alone (SMD = –0.40, 95% CI: –0.68 to –0.11, P = 0.006),
see Figure 5.

Analysis of article publication bias

The Egger test indicated that there was a possible publication
bias (t = –2.52, 95% CI: –4.12 to –0.38, P = 0.02) for ERP

with reduced basolateral amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal
cortex functional connectivity in the resting state (40). The
amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the underlying structures
involved in fear conditioning and regression, and could predict
outcomes from ERP. SSRIs are currently the most common
drugs used internationally to treat OCD (3). The reduction
of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients treated with
SSRIs medications is associated with reduced metabolic levels
in the right caudate nucleus, bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, and
bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and with increased activation
in the left thalamus and right insula (41). Nevertheless, if SSRIs
medication fails, prompt psychological interventions, such as
CBT, behavioral therapy, and ERP, are all acceptable measures,
and vice versa (42).

It has been suggested that some patients in studies
using ERP-based CBT therapies entered the trial under the
condition of continuing their antidepressants, whereas in
fact they received the combined treatment (43). The result
that CBT’s eﬀect was greater than SSRIs and clomipramine
may be attributed to the combined eﬀect of
the two
treatment modalities (8). Subgroup analysis revealed that
ERP combination medication was signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than providing SSRIs or clomipramine medication alone,

with statistically signiﬁcant changes in Y-BOCS scores before
and after treatment, which is consistent with the ﬁndings
of previous studies (24, 32, 39).
In OCD patients with
limited beneﬁt from SSRI treatment, combined ERP treatment
with risperidone was more beneﬁcial, conﬁrming the ﬁndings
focusing on individuals with refractory
of prior
OCD (25, 33). Although it appears that a combination of
pharmacological and psychological treatment is eﬀective, there
is no convincing evidence that ERP alone is more eﬀective
than combination treatment. A systematic review comparing
behavioral and pharmacological therapies similarly stated that
combination therapy had little beneﬁt over behavioral therapy
in an outpatient setting, but that it was at least superior to
pharmacological therapy (12).

Regarding the long-lasting mechanism of treatment eﬀects,
one study reported no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between drug
and combination therapy groups (25), while others found
that combination therapy was signiﬁcantly better than drug
therapy (31, 39). The results of Subgroup analysis revealed
that the majority of OCD patients maintained modest eﬃcacy
during the follow-up period after ERP combination medication
therapy. The follow-up duration included in this study was,
however, relatively short, and some of the articles did not oﬀer

the majority of OCD patients are chronic, more follow-up
statistics on long-term treatment are required to determine the
duration of symptom improvement without relapse following
combination therapy.

Hitherto, the results of clinical studies of DCS enhanced

However, Subgroup analysis revealed that DCS does not
have a mechanism for enhancing ERP eﬃcacy and did not
signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the placebo group, which is in line
with prior ﬁndings (19, 21, 29). Nevertheless,
it has been
suggested that antidepressants may block the eﬀect of DCS
in promoting fear extinction, with a higher percentage of
symptom improvement in the DCS group among patients

and roughly two-thirds suﬀer from a lifetime comorbidity
(16). When compulsions are accompanied by a depressive
mood,
it can interfere with the completion of homework
assignments and the development of therapeutic habits during
ERP treatment. Combining antidepressants and psychotherapy
for OCD patients who have signiﬁcant depressive symptoms
may be more eﬀective than monotherapy (50). In particular,
for patients with severe obsessive-compulsive co-morbid
depression who do not respond well to therapy alone, a
combination of CBT involving ERP and SSRIs is frequently
recommended (8).

Recent research evaluated the eﬃcacy and tolerability of
three commonly used atypical antipsychotics (risperidone,
paliperidone, and aripiprazole) as
reinforcing treatments
for OCD, which are more likely to be used clinically as
augmentation agents to treat patients when SSRIs and ERP
have limited treatment eﬀect (51). In addition, ketamine
plays an important
role in the cortico-striato-thalamo-
cortical loop as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor
antagonist and glutamatergic modulator. Given the limitations
of current OCD treatment and the new evidence that
glutamate may improve depression and play a role in OCD
pathophysiology, ketamine has emerged as an alternative drug
in this ﬁeld (52).

Conclusion

This study conﬁrmed the feasibility of ERP combined with
medication in improving obsessive-compulsive symptoms and
depressive mood in patients with OCD, but was insuﬃcient
to demonstrate that DCS enhances the eﬃcacy of ERP. The
inclusion of data from 10 countries worldwide further enhances
the generalizability of the results, but there are some limitations.

Due to the presence of compulsions and counter-

Furthermore,

precondition that patient actively confronts the stimulus
or situation (45), which may aggravate the patient’s anxiety
during ERP treatment. Compulsion is associated with a
large number of psychiatric comorbidities, with anxiety
and mood disorders being more common (46). Therefore,
patients with comorbidities were not excluded from this study,
and several included papers reported co-morbid anxiety or
depression in some patients (19, 21, 22, 30, 33–35, 39). The

to be related to emotion
processing, and its dysfunction may aﬀect patients’ sensitivity
to uncomfortable emotions or anxiety, as well as be responsible
for exacerbating the co-morbidity of obsessive-compulsive and
anxious emotions (47). A Meta-analysis found that neither
ERPs nor SSRIs signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety and depressive
