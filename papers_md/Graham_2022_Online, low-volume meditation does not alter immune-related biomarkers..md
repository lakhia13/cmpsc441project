Objectives: Prior studies of mindfulness meditation have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects but whether meditation courses delivered 
online can exert similar effects is poorly understood. Barriers to large scale implementation of traditional mindfulness meditation programs has created an increased 
interest in the effect of less time- and resource-intensive online meditation courses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 6-week online mindfulness 
program with low time demands on nurses would lead to changes in gene expression, cytokine profiles, telomerase activity, and cortisol profiles. 
Methods: This was a randomized, parallel pilot study comparing an online mindfulness-based stress management program to an active control group from December 
2018 to May 2019. Healthy nurses with above average levels of perceived stress were randomized to receive a 6-week online mindfulness-based stress management 
program including ≥5 min daily meditation practice or listen to relaxing music for ≥5 min daily as the control arm. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 
after 6 weeks, and various self-reported measures of stress, physical and emotional health were collected at baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks. Whole 
transcriptome mRNA sequencing of whole blood at baseline and after 6 weeks was performed along with measurement of plasma IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and telomerase activity was measured. Diurnal salivary cortisol profiles were assessed at baseline and after 6 
weeks. The primary outcome was change over time in a pre-determined set of 53 genes representative of the immune-related changes seen with stress, which was 
analyzed using a mixed linear model. Secondary outcomes included all other self-reported measures and biomarkers mentioned above. 
Results: A total of 61 nurses were randomized, with 52 having sufficient data to include in the final analysis. After 6 weeks, nurses in the control group reported 
significant reductions in stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale while those in the mindfulness group did not. However, after 12 weeks, the mindfulness 
group also showed a significant reduction in stress. When compared to the control group, no significant changes in RNA gene expression or any other biomarkers 
were observed in the nurses who participated in the mindfulness program. 
Conclusions: Our study found that this brief online mindfulness-based intervention was effective in reducing stress in nurses, albeit with a delayed effect compared to 
listening to relaxing music. Regarding immunoregulatory effects, there were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in transcriptomic or 
other tested biomarkers of immune function. This study provides evidence for a floor effect of mindfulness on transcriptional and circulating biomarkers of immune 
function.   

1. Introduction 

Mindfulness-based interventions have repeatedly demonstrated both 
mental and physical health benefits in a wide variety of populations and 
using a variety of specific techniques (Gotink et al., 2015; Crowe et al., 
2016; Grossman et al., 2004; Pascoe et al., 2017). A growing body of 
evidence suggests that these observed benefits are rooted in reproduc-
ible neural and molecular signatures. In brain imaging studies medita-
tion  practice  is  associated  with  changes  in  the  morphology  and 

activation  patterns  in  areas  of  the  brain  responsible  for  attention, 
automatic thoughts, self-referential thinking, and emotional regulation 
(Marchand, 2014; Fox et al., 2014; Muehsam et al., 2017). In studies 
evaluating physiologic and blood biomarkers, meditation reduces heart 
rate, blood pressure, cortisol, CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 and exhibits other 
positive immunologic effects (Pascoe et al., 2017; Meyer et al., 2019; Ng 
et  al.,  2020;  Creswell  et  al.,  2009,  2016;  Black  and  Slavich,  2016). 
Furthermore,  recent studies  have  shown a  consistent pattern  of  alter-
to  mindfulness-based 
ations

Graham et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

interventions, mostly in immune-related and inflammatory pathways. In 
particular,  mindfulness  meditation  appears  to  reduce  expression  of 
pro-inflammatory genes and NF-κB while upregulating  interferon and 
anti-viral response genes (Muehsam et al., 2017; Buric et al., 2017). This 
is  in  direct  contrast  to  the  gene  expression  signature  associated  with 
chronic  stress  and  suggests  that  mindfulness  meditation  may  directly 
counter some of the toxic effects of chronic stress on a molecular level 
(Cole, 2013, 2014; Irwin and Cole, 2011). 

Previous  reports  describing  significant  changes  in  gene  expression 
analysis  as  primary  outcome  have  largely  been  derived  from  studies 
using  either  multi-day  residential  retreats  or  time-intensive  in-person 
interventions.  Given  the  increasing  popularity  of  digital  mindfulness 
applications and programs as well as their obvious benefits in terms of 
accessibility,  it  is  important  that  these  interventions  be  as  rigorously 
studied as other modalities. Several recent meta-analyses have demon-
strated the potential for online mindfulness programs to reduce stress, 
improve  mental  health  and,  possibly,  reduce  self-reported  physical 
complaints (Jayewardene et al., 2017; Toivonen et al., 2017; Spijkerman 
et al., 2016). Unexplored, however, is the question of what the lower 
limits of the mindfulness dose-response curve are in terms of its capacity 
to modulate immune function. No study to date has assessed the effects 
of  an  online  mindfulness  program  on  gene  expression  and  other 
immune-related  biomarkers.  This  study  was  designed  to  explore  the 

question  of  whether  lower  frequency,  online  mindfulness  instruction 
and practice over a short period of time would impact perceived stress 
and/or  immune-related  biomarkers.  We  chose  to  specifically  recruits 
nurses for this study given the high rates of burnout and mental health 
disorders  among  this  group,  especially  exacerbated  by  the  recent 
pandemic (McHugh et al., 2011; Letvak et al., 2012; Al Maqbali et al., 
2021). 

2. Methods 

2.1. Study design and participants 

This  was  a  single-center,  single-blind,  randomized,  parallel  pilot 
study comparing a 6-week online mindfulness-based stress management 
program to an active control that involved listening to relaxing music for 
at  least  5  min  daily  (See  Fig.  1).  Participants  were  enrolled  and  ran-
domized  in  a  1:1  ratio  on  a  rolling  basis  using  a  random  number 
generator. The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional 
Review  Board  and  registered  in  clinicaltrials.gov.  Study  participants 
were recruited from among male and female nurses and nursing assis-
tants  at  the  Cleveland  Clinic  main  campus  in  Cleveland,  Ohio  from 
December 2018 to May 2019 through self-referral in response to posted 
flyers  and  department-wide  informational  emails.  To  be  eligible  to

participate  they  had  to  speak  English,  be  able  to  provide  informed 
consent,  and  score  above  average  (≥7)  on  an  abbreviated  4-question 
version of the Perceived Stress Scale. Participants were excluded from 
enrollment  if  they  smoked,  were  pregnant,  had  any  major  chronic 
medical condition, currently used antidepressants or any other psychi-
atric  medication,  currently  used  hormone  replacement  therapy  or 
immunosuppressive  medication,  or  engaged  in  regular  meditation 
practice either at the time of enrollment or previously. 

2.2. Mindfulness and control interventions 

Stress Free Now for Healers is an online stress management program 
developed by the Cleveland Clinic designed to reduce stress by fostering 
the  development  of  mindfulness.  The  program  includes  weekly  in-
troductions of concepts, guided meditations (5–20 min each) available 
on the website or via the Stress Free Now for Healers iPhone app, daily 
articles and tips for how to manage stress or incorporate mindfulness in 
daily activities, and a place to record your progress. This program was 
modeled on a very similar online program not specifically designed for 
health care workers, which has been shown in a previous study to reduce 
self-reported stress levels over an 8-week time frame but remains un-
studied in terms of biomarker analysis (Schneiderman et al., 2005). Each 
participant was instructed to complete as many of the daily readings, 
tips, and activities as possible with a particular emphasis on the medi-
tation recordings. They were counseled that this was the key aspect of 
the  program  and  that  they  should  listen  to  at  least  one  of  these  re-
cordings in a quiet place without distractions every day for the next 6 
weeks.  The minimum  frequency  necessary  to  reap the  benefits  of  the 
program  was  more  than  four  times  per  week  based  on  prior  studies. 
Additionally, each participant in the intervention group was assigned an 
e-coach  that  emailed  the  participant  at  least  weekly  with  advice  and 
motivation and who responded to the participant’s questions and con-
cerns. At the second in-person study visit (week 6), participants in this 
group were told they continue to engage with the online program and 
meditate  if  they  desired  but  were  not  required  to  do  so.  E-coaching 
stopped after week 6. 

The control group was given a link to a website where they could 
download 27 digital recordings of relaxing music as well as flash drive 
containing  the  same  recordings  and  were  instructed  to  quietly  listen 
while doing nothing else to one or more of the recordings for at least 5 
min every day for 6 weeks. At the second in-person study visit (week 6), 
participants in this group were told they could continue to listen to the 
relaxing music if they desired but were not specifically instructed to do 
so. 

All  participants,  whether  assigned  to  the  intervention  or  control 
group, received free life-time access to the Stress Free Now for Healers 
program at the conclusion of the study. 

2.3. Monitoring adherence 

Participants  in  both  groups  were  emailed  weekly  with  a  link  to 
complete  a  1-min  online  questionnaire  regarding  either  their  level  of 
participation in Stress Free Now for Healers for Healers (intervention 
group)  or  the  frequency  and  time  with  which  they  listened  to  the 
relaxing music (control group). Additionally, website login activity for 
each participant enrolled in Stress Free Now for Healers for Healers was 
monitored and participants in the intervention group could record the 
number of minutes spent doing relaxation practices on the website. 

2.4. Sample size determination 

Estimates  sample  size  needed  was  calculated  for  the  primary 
outcome of change over time in gene expression between the treatment 
and control groups. Assuming the log of the gene intensity for each gene 
follows a normal distribution with (1) a mean depending on the gene, 
time (pre, post) and treatment (treated, control) and (2) variance equal 

to the coefficient of variance (cv = sd/mean) of the raw gene intensity 
value depending on the gene but constant across time and treatment, 
and  assuming  15,000  genes  are  tested,  we  calculated  the  minimum 
detectable fold change between treated and control groups of 10 sub-
jects per group. For these calculations, we used a desired power of at 
least 80% and an alpha (type-I) error rate per gene of 0.002215, which is 
equivalent  to  having  a  false  discovery  rate  of  0.05  when  5%  of  the 
15,000 tested genes are truly different between the treated and control 
groups. Assuming the correlation between pre and post gene intensity 
for each participant is 0.8, and the average coefficient of variation of 
gene intensity across all genes is 0.3, we determined that we had power 
to detect a minimum fold change of 1.27 between treated and control 
groups if we enrolled 10 subjects in each group. 

Previous  studies  of  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  and  gene 
expression have successfully demonstrated >20–25% changes in more 
than 60 genes with around 20 subjects in each group (Chida et al., 2008; 
Leserman  et  al.,  2002).  Based  on  this  data  and  our  calculations,  we 
planned  to  enroll  30  subjects  in  each  group  with  sufficient  power  to 
detect a 20% minimum change in transcript level while accounting for a 
10–25% dropout rate. A total of 61 subjects were ultimately enrolled 
with 9 of these not returning for their follow-up study visit, which is a 
dropout rate of about 15%. 

2.5. Data and sample collection 

2.5.1. Study visits 

All  participants  were scheduled  for  two  in-person study  visits  6–9 
weeks apart, each between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m. after opportunity 
for a full night of sleep. At each of the 2 study visits the participants had 
their  vitals  measured  (height,  weight,  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and 
temperature)  followed  by  a  fasting  blood  draw.  They  were  then 
administered a series of questionnaires on the computer: Global physical 
activity questionnaire (GPAQ), PrimeScreen (a dietary screening tool), 
Sleep Habits Questionnaire (4 items from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
regarding  average  sleep  quantity  over  the  past  2  weeks  + Insomnia 
Severity  Index),  Perceived  Stress  Scale  (PSS),  Connor-Davidson  Resil-
ience  Scale,  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory  –  Human  Services  Survey, 
RAND 36 - Emotional Well-Being subscale, PROMIS Global Health (SF), 
PROMIS Anxiety (Computer adaptive test), PROMIS Depression (Com-
puter adaptive test), and PROMIS Fatigue (Computer adaptive test). 

2.5.2. Salivary cortisol/DHEA test 

At  both  Study  Visit  1  and  2  participants  were  provided  with  the 
Adrenocortex Stress Profile with Cortisol Awakening Response kit from 
Genova Diagnostics and told to collect 6 saliva samples at home over the 
course of a single day according to the provided instructions within one 
week  of  their  study  visit.  They  then  mailed  these  samples  directly  to 
Genova Diagnostics for analysis using a prepaid envelope. 

2.5.3. 12-Week follow up 

12 weeks following the initial study visit participants were emailed a 
link to complete some of the same questionnaires they completed at the 
two prior study visits. 

2.5.4. Laboratory procedures 

All  blood  samples  were  kept  at  room  temperature,  except  for  the 
EDTA tube, which was kept on ice and immediately taken for processing, 
which included freezing PAXgene RNA tubes, aliquoting and freezing 
plasma  separated  from  EDTA  tubes,  and  isolation  and  freezing  of 
mononuclear cells in CPT tubes. An aliquot of these cells was also lysed 
and frozen for the telomerase assay. 

After collecting all blood samples, stabilized RNA was extracted from 
the  PAXgene  tubes  (performed  by  CCF  Genomics  Biorepository)  and 
sequenced  using  Next  Generation  Sequencing  (NGS)  technology  (per-
formed by CCF Genomics Core). Concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF- 
α, and IFN-γ  in the plasma samples were measured using a multiplex

immunoassay run in duplicate with all appropriate controls and stan-
dards  through  the University  of  Maryland  Cytokine Core.  Telomerase 
activity was measured in PBMCs previously prepared with CHAPS lysis 
buffer using a Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay, 
which was performed by UCSF’s Telomere Core. 

2.6. Statistical methods 

2.6.1. Demographics and subject characteristics 

Categorical  variables  were  summarized  using  counts  and  fre-
quencies,  and  were  compared  using  Fisher’s  exact  tests.  Continuous 
variables were summarized using median and inter-quartile range (IQR), 
and were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. 

2.6.2. Self-reported outcomes, cytokine levels, and telomerase activity 

For  the  Perceived  Stress  Scale,  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory,  and 
Connor-Davidson  Resilience  Scale,  scores  at  each  visit  and  the  differ-
ences  of  scores  between  the  two visits  (Week  6  –  Week  0) as  well  as 
between Week 12 and each visit (Week 12 – Week 6, Week 12 – Week 0) 
were  summarized  using  medians  and  IQR  and  were  compared  using 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. 

For  the  PROMIS  Global  Health,  Depression,  Anxiety,  and  Fatigue 
Scales, scores at each visit and the differences of scores between the two 
visits (Week 6 –  Week 0), as well as between Week 12 and each visit 
(Week 12 – Week 6, Week 12 – Week 0), were summarized using means 
and standard deviations and compared using t-tests. 

For cytokine and telomerase activity data, values at each visit and 
the difference between the two visits (Week 6 – Week 0) were summa-
rized using medians and IQR and were compared using Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum tests. 

2.6.3. Diurnal cortisol patterns 

For the cortisol and DHEA data, all measures were summarized using 
medians and IQR at baseline and follow-up, and the difference between 
these  measures  for  each  subject  were  calculated  and  then  averaged 
across the intervention and control groups. These differences were then 
compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. See supplementary data for 
details about the specific measures analyzed. 

2.6.4. CTRA gene expression 

While changes in the expression of individual genes in response to 
stress is highly variable, recent studies using genome-wide expression 
methods have been able to detect a reliable transcriptional signature in 
circulating  immune  cells  that  is  consistent  across  studies.  Mostly 
through the work of Steve Cole and colleagues at UCLA, this signature 
has  been  extensively  studied  and  defined  as  the  conserved  transcrip-
tional  response  to  adversity,  as  it  appears  to  be  conserved  across 
different types of stressors and even across species. It is characterized by 
an  upregulation  of  pro-inflammatory  genes  and  pathways,  a  down- 
regulation  of  interferon,  antibody,  and  antiviral-related  genes  and  a 
down-regulation of glucocorticoid signaling. 

After preprocessing and assessment of read quality, RNA sequences 
were aligned to GRCh38 using RNA STAR version 2.7.9a using Gencode 
version 38 gene annotation. Raw count data was log transformed and 
normalized in DESeq2. The data was then analyzed using a mixed linear 
effect  model  (using  package  lme4  version  1.1–27.1)  to  determine 
whether there was an interaction between the subject group (interven-
tion vs. control) and change in expression of the CTRA gene set at the 6- 
week compared to baseline visit, treating the 53 indicator transcripts as 
a single variable, with the downregulated components of the CTRA (30 
interferon-related and 3 antibody synthesis genes) being sign-inverted. 
Associations were adjusted for potential confounding factors including 
age, sex, race, and BMI. See supplementary data for a detailed descrip-
tion of methods and R output. 

3. Results 

3.1. Demographics 

A total of 61 nurses were enrolled in the study with 30 randomized to 
the  control  group  and  31  randomized  to  the  intervention  group.  Of 
these,  there  were  25  in  the  control  group  and  27  in  the  intervention 
group that completed the study. The majority of these nurses were white 
and female with the majority having obtained at least bachelor’s degree. 
The median age was 33, and the median BMI was 26. See supplementary 
data for additional characteristics of the sample population. There were 
no major differences with regards to any of these characteristics between 
the groups. 

3.2. Questionnaires 

The  only  statistically  significant  changes  over  the  study  period 
among all the administered questionnaires was in the PSS. The initial 
decrease in the PSS from Week 0 to Week 6 was larger for the control 
group (p < 0.001). However, from Week 6 to Week 12 the intervention 
group showed a large decrease, while the scores in the control group 
remained relatively stable, leading to a marginally significant (p = 0.04) 
larger total decrease in perceived stress from Week 0 to Week 12 in the 
intervention group. No significant differences were observed between 
groups at Week 0, Week 6, or Week 12 nor were any of the changes over 
time  significant  for  either  group  for  any  of  the  other  self-reported

outcomes (See Tables 1-2, Fig. 2). 

3.3. CTRA gene expression 

Mixed  linear  analysis  of  the  CTRA  gene  set  showed  no  significant 
interaction between time point, baseline vs 6 weeks, and group, inter-
vention  vs  control  (β  = 0.067  [0.0092,  96.0],  P  = 0.89).  Secondary 
genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed no association between 
group,  PSS,  or  average  weekly  time  spent  meditating  and  changes  in 
gene expression. 

3.4. Cytokines, telomerase activity, and cortisol 

At both the first and second study visits (Week 0 and Week 6), all 
participants had blood drawn for measurement of plasma concentrations 
of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CRP and telomerase activity within 
isolated PBMCs. Among all these measures, no statistically significant 
differences were observed between the intervention and control groups 
over the studied time period (See Fig. 3). Salivary cortisol levels over the 
course of one day was also measured in all participants shortly after the 
first and second study visits. Analysis of this data showed no difference 
between  the  intervention  and  control  groups  in  terms  of  change  in 
cortisol  awakening  response,  cortisol  slope,  cortisol  AUC,  or  dhea: 
cortisol ratio (See Table 3). 

3.5. Associations between subject compliance and outcomes 

To better understand the observed results and determine whether the 
level of participant engagement could account for some of these obser-
vations, self-reported measures of subject compliance were summarized, 
and  linear  regression  between  the  change  in  PSS  scores  at  each  time 
point  and  compliance  (measured  in  average  weekly  minutes  spent 
meditating or listening to music) was performed with compliance*group 
as an interaction term. Furthermore, a subset analysis of the CRP data 
was performed on just those subjects with an average participation of 
four  or  more  times  per  week.  Measures  of  compliance  were,  overall, 
similar between groups with the median practice frequency being 4 and 
5 times/week and the median time spent being 30 and 35 min/week in

the mindfulness and control groups respectively. The one exception was 
in regards to the percentage of subjects averaging four or more times per 
week of practice, with only 46% achieving this in the mindfulness group 
versus 76% in the control group. 

Multivariate  regression  of  change  in  PSS,  group,  and  compliance 
showed  no  relationship  between  compliance  and  change  in  PSS  (β  =
0.012,  P  = 0.70),  nor  was  there  a  significant  interaction  between 
compliance and group (β = (cid:0) 0.088, P = 0.21). 

3.6. Associations between self-reported improvements in stress and 
outcomes 

Finally,  to  determine  whether  subjects  reported  stress  levels  were 
related to changes in their CRP or IL-6 levels, linear regression between 
the  change  in  PSS  between  Week  0  and  Week  6  and  the  respective

reduction  in  stress  and  the  genomic  and  immunologic  biomarkers  of 
chronic  stress  in  a  group  of  healthy,  but  stressed,  nurses.  To  our 
knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of an online 
mindfulness program on immune-related biomarkers and gene expres-
sion. Contrary to our hypothesis, the blood of those who completed the 
course showed no change in RNA expression of the CTRA gene set as a 
whole,  nor  was  there  a  significant  change  in  the  expression  of  genes 
regulated by NF-κB, CREB, AP-1, IRF-1 or IRF-2 as shown in previous 
studies of mind-body interventions (Black et al., 2013; Irwin et al., 2014, 
2015; Morledge et al., 2013). Our study data are clinically important to 
help define a lower limit of engagement with an online mediation mo-
dality using standard meditative practices for beginners in terms of its 
ability to influence immune function as measured by gene analysis and 
other assays of inflammatory pathways. 

Despite failing to provide support for our primary hypothesis, this 
study  did  demonstrate  a  significant  reduction  in  levels  of  perceived 
stress  in  both  control  and  intervention  groups,  possibly  indicating  a 
placebo or Hawthorne effect, but more likely indicating both listening to 
relaxing music or engaging in mindfulness practices on a regular basis 
can reduce stress (de Witte et al., 2022). Interestingly, while a significant 
reduction in stress was seen after 6 weeks in the relaxing music group, 
the same was not observed until the 12-week time point in the mind-
fulness group. Speculating as to why this might have occurred, it could 
be that the mindfulness program required learning and practicing new 
skills that lead to a delayed effect on stress compared to the more im-
mediate  effects  of  listening  to  relaxing  music.  It  is  also  possible  that 
being  asked  to  participate  in  the  mindfulness  program  was,  itself, 
perceived as another source of stress by at least some of the participants 
in the mindfulness group, and that after the stress of required partici-
pation  was  removed  at  week  6,  the  stress-alleviating  effects  could  be 
seen. Interestingly, when analyzing overall changes in perceived stress 
between week 0 and week 12, there was a marginally significant bigger 
reduction in the mindfulness group compared to the control. However, 
these results should be interpreted with caution due to the high dropout 
rate and limited available data at week 12. In fact, it is conceivable that 
those who responded to the emailed questionnaires at week 12 were less 
stressed, possibly biasing the results. It should also be pointed out that 
the initial median PSS in the mindfulness group was statistically higher 
than in the control group. However, our statistical analysis focused on 
the  relative  change  over  time,  subtracting  each  subject’s  later  scores 
from his/her initial scores and comparing the medians of these differ-
ences  in  each  group,  which  should  minimize  any  potential  problems 
caused by this baseline difference in stress levels. It could still be argued, 
however,  that  these  higher  baseline  stress  levels  were  also  more  re-
fractory to treatment, possibly making the mindfulness program appear 
less effective. 

In terms of the capacity for mindfulness meditation practice to in-
fluence immune function as assessed by changes in gene expression and 
alter inflammation, the vast majority of studies demonstrating such ef-
fects  have  used  either  longer  or  more  time-intensive  in-person  in-
terventions. In a large study by Chandran et al. (2021) these included 
daily 45-min practice sessions plus longer, in-person weekend classes in 
mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR),  week-long  retreats  with 
over  10  h  of  daily  meditation,  and  concurrent  dietary  and  lifestyle 
change.  With  the  growing  popularity  of  easily  accessible  online  mo-
dalities for meditation practice which allow greater individual auton-
omy in terms of practice schedule and engagement, it is important to 
understand  the  dose-response  relationship  and  influence  of  such  mo-
dalities on immune function at the molecular level. 

With regards to previous studies of meditation that have served to 
define a lower limit of practice that have demonstrated statistical change 
in  gene  expression,  Black  et  al.  (2013)  were  able  to  demonstrate  a 
change in NF-κB and IRF1-associated gene expression with a similarly 
low-dose  intervention  that  consisted  of  only  12  min  a  day  of  yogic 
meditation, but they do not provide information on the level of adher-
ence.  This  makes  it  impossible  to  determine  whether  the  level  of

4. Discussion 

In this small pilot study, we set out to determine whether an online, 
6-week mindfulness-based stress management course would result in a 

Brain,Behavior,&Immunity-Health26(2022)1005316B. Graham et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

participation was comparable to our study. Furthermore, it is unknown 
whether mindfulness practices using standard basic techniques such as 
focused  attention  are  equivalent  to  a  mantra-based  practice  such  as 
Yogic-meditation as employed by Black et al. (2013) 

In an effort to explain the lack of any meaningful change in immune 
function  as  measured  by  gene  expression  and  the  immunologic  and 
neurohormonal assays used in this study, several possibilities must be 
considered.  First,  the  intensity  of  the  practice  as  measured  by  the 
number of sessions and committed time may have been inadequate to 
effect  change.  Multiple  previous  studies  of  mindfulness  interventions 
have demonstrated the importance of treatment adherence and practice 
time in affecting both psychological and biological outcomes (Creswell 
et al., 2009; Carmody and Baer, 2008; Parsons et al., 2017). Given the 
low level of adherence in our study, with a median weekly practice time 
of only 30 min in the mindfulness group and less than half the partici-
pants completing the recommended minimum of four meditation prac-
tices per week, it is possible the participants in our study did not reach 
the minimum amount of instruction or practice required to reduce stress 
or  inflammation.  A  previous  study  utilizing  a  highly  similar  program 
incorporating  the  same  mindfulness  practices  demonstrated  that  a 
weekly meditation frequency of 4.07 ± 1.59 was effective at reducing 
stress after 8 weeks. While the current study failed to detect a change in 
stress after 6 weeks, by 12 weeks there did seem to be a reduction in 
stress levels, indicating the intervention in this study may have been too 
low  volume  to  see  an  effect.  Interestingly,  though  this  prior  study 
showed a weak but significant association between the level of partici-
pation  and  reductions  in  stress  levels,  we  did  not  see  the  same  here 
(Morledge et al., 2013). However, our study was also underpowered to 
detect such associations. 

Another possibility is that the duration of the intervention and the 
time  point  selected  (6  weeks)  resulted  in  sampling  too  soon  to  see  a 
biologic  effect.  As  noted  above  the  documented  change  in  perceived 
stress in the active arm occurred at 12 weeks but not at 6 weeks, when 
the patients underwent laboratory assessment. This could have limited 
our capacity to detect change. Comparatively, the majority of similar 
studies have used interventions that are at least 8 weeks long. In addi-
tion to reducing the total dose of mindfulness training, it also reduced 
the time for changes in biomarkers to occur. Moreover, most studies, 
even the ones that showed significant changes in gene expression, have 
not been able to demonstrate a reduction in protein-based markers of 
inflammation (Muehsam et al., 2017; Buric et al., 2017). Those that have 
shown reductions in biomarkers like CRP and IL-6 have collected follow 
up  samples  about  4–9  months  from  baseline  (Meyer  et  al.,  2019;  Ng 
et al., 2020; Creswell et al., 2016). Though changes in RNA expression 
generally occur much faster than changes in circulating levels of protein 
biomarkers, more time may have been required to see a difference be-
tween the control and intervention groups, especially since changes in 
perceived stress levels in the mindfulness group did not change until the 
12-week time point, after blood samples had been collected. 

A  third  possibility  is  that  our  study  population  was  not  stressed 
enough and/or too healthy to detect a change in the selected outcomes. 
While we did screen for individuals experiencing higher than average 
levels of stress, the participants on the whole were healthier and younger 
than  in  other  studies  and  not  necessarily  experiencing  any  particular 
major life stressor. This would give them a low baseline level of systemic 
inflammation from which it would be difficult to show significant re-
ductions over a short time frame. It would be reasonable to repeat this 
study in a population with higher baseline levels of inflammation such as 
those with a chronic disease or mental health disorder. 

One of the strengths of this study is that we used an active control 
group rather than a wait-list control as in many prior studies, and we 
showed  that  both  listening  to  relaxing  music  and  participating  in  an 
online mindfulness program reduced perceived stress of nurses, though 
with a delayed effect in the mindfulness group, confirming the results of 
a prior study of this program (Morledge et al., 2013). Although these 
changes  did  not  correlate  with  changes  in  circulating  biomarkers  of 

inflammation, reducing the stress of healthcare professionals has merit 
in its own right given the prevalence of burn out and the greater need for 
resilience  in  the  current  pandemic.  Additionally,  this  study  provides 
evidence for a floor effect of mindfulness on transcriptional and circu-
lating biomarkers of immune function and suggests that online programs 
and apps may not have all the same beneficial effects as more robust, 
in-person  mindfulness  programs  and  techniques.  Future  studies  of 
mindfulness should focus on determining not only whether mindfulness 
produces psychological and biological changes but also the minimum 
effective dose required to produce these changes.
