Studying  Flourishing  is  important  to  understand  wellbeing.  The  current  study 
aimed  to  determine  the  psychometric  properties  of  the  Spanish  version  of  the 
Flourishing Scale (FS) in the Honduran population. The primary sample consisted 
of 422 residents of the Central District of Honduras; this included 275 (65.17%) 
women  and  147  men  (34.83%).  Their  average  age  was  28.18  years  (SD  =  10.58). 
Findings from the Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis 
support  a  unidimensional  factor  structure.  The  FS  achieved  a  high  internal 
consistency with McDonald’s ω  =  0.89, 95% CI [0.86, 0.91]. The average inter-item 
correlation was 0.48, 95% CI [0.43, 0.53]. Using Student’s t-test for paired samples, 
results indicate that none of the FS items varied significantly between baseline and 
post-test. Additionally, Spearman’s rho was used to correlate test–retest scores; 
this yielded a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.66. The Flourishing 
Scale  had  adequate  convergent  validity  with  the  Subjective  Happiness  Scale 
(r  =  0.70) and the PANAS-Positive Affect Subscale (r  =  0.70) (p  <  0.001). In contrast, 
it  correlates  inversely  with  the  PANAS-Negative  Affect  Subscale  (r  =  −0.34)  and 
the PHQ-9 (r  =  −0.51). Strict measurement invariance for sex was supported. The 
results indicate that the Flourishing Scale has robust psychometric properties for 
the Honduran population. Practical implications for public policy are discussed.

1. Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, health is a holistic state of physical, psychological, 
and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of disease (World Health Organization, 1946). This 
conceptualization transcends the reductionist pathology-based approach focused on the negative 
aspects of wellbeing. Focusing on both positive aspects of wellbeing (such as Flourishing), as well as 
negative facets, such as psychopathology, allows for a more complete understanding of an individual’s 
overall psychological health (Antaramian et al., 2010; García-Álvarez et al., 2020; Barragán and 
Ramsés, 2021). In this regard, the field of positive psychology is particularly important. Positive 
psychology focuses on the qualities and other facets that allow people to live a happy, productive life; 
to grow personally; and to develop the different capacities and skills that are considered important 
to promote wellbeing, for example, autonomy, physical health, and self-determination, among others 
(Diener, 1984; Hernández Rincón et al., 2022). Another facet that is considered essential for wellbeing 
is Flourishing.

Flourishing refers to positive traits and states such as purpose, 
hope, resilience, self-esteem, and positive relationships (Diener et al., 
2010). The combination and interaction of the five elements of the 
PERMA  model  (Positive  Emotions,  Engagement,  Relationships, 
Meaning, and Accomplishments) may lead to Flourishing and are key 
to experience wellbeing (Seligman, 2018). These elements constitute 
a source of intrinsic reward and thus motivate people to do things and 
to  continue  doing  them,  further  allowing  the  person  to  achieve 
optimal psychosocial functioning (Butler and Kern, 2016). In this 
sense, Flourishing is understood from a humanistic and eudaimonic 
perspective of wellbeing (Choudhry et al., 2018).

Recent  research  has  provided  insights  into  the  importance  of 
Flourishing. For instance, people with high levels of Flourishing tend 
to  have  more  resourceful  coping  mechanisms  against  adverse  life 
events (Prizmić-Larsen et al., 2020). Flourishing also protects against 
unhealthy 
lifestyles,  risky  behaviors,  and  psychopathological 
symptoms.  As  such,  research  suggests  that  Flourishing  should 
be  considered  an  essential  element  in  public  health  interventions 
(Sofija  et  al.,  2020;  Kelly-Hedrick  et  al.,  2022),  and  be  an  explicit 
objective of public policy as it relates to critical elements of social 
welfare and connectedness with others and the surrounding world 
(Seaford, 2019).

Although several questionnaires are used to measure Flourishing, 
this study focused on the Flourishing Scale (FS) (Diener et al., 2010). 
Originally  conceptualized  as  a  unidimensional  measure,  the  FS 
considers  the  following  constructs:  purpose/meaning  in  life,  life 
satisfaction,  optimism,  competence,  perceived  engagement  in 
activities, positive relationships, contributing to others’ happiness, and 
being respected by others. The scale’s validity, factor structure, and 
reliability were supported in studies conducted in other countries 
(Hone et al., 2014; Villieux et al., 2016).

To  this  day,  research  on  Flourishing  in  Spanish-speaking 
populations  is  sparse,  including  the  validation  of  measures  of 
Flourishing (Waigel and Lemos, 2023). To our knowledge, the FS has 
not yet been validated in the Honduran population. It is important 
that scales are validated for the populations in which they will be used, 
as  cultural  and  social  factors  can  influence  how  Flourishing  is 
experienced in different populations. Using a scale that has not been 
validated for specific countries or cultural groups may inaccurately 
reflect  the  experiences  of  Flourishing  of  such  a  population.  The 
current study focuses on the Honduran population, who suffers from 
high levels of poverty, political instability, and violence (Gindling and 
Terrell, 2010; Landa-Blanco et al., 2020), that may have a negative 
impact on their mental health (Knifton and Inglis, 2020; Foell et al., 
2021). As such, this population may be in need of interventions aimed 
at promoting their well-being (including Flourishing) and, in turn, 
appropriate  measures  to  assess  the  need  for  intervention  and  the 
effectiveness of such interventions.

Consequently, this study aims to validate the Spanish version of 
the  FS  for  the  Honduran  population  (Diener  and  Biswas-Diener, 
2009).  Based  on  prior  validation  studies  of  the  FS,  the  following 
hypotheses were tested:

Hypothesis 2: The FS has adequate internal consistency and test–
retest  reliability.  The  original  validation  of  the  FS  reported  a 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87 and a test–retest reliability of 0.71 at a 
one-month follow-up (Diener et al., 2010).

Hypothesis 3: The FS has convergent validity with the scales that 
assess positive affect and subjective happiness. Validation studies 
have  found  a  positive  correlation  between  the  FS  and 
measurements  of  self-reported  happiness  and  positive  affect 
(Diener et al., 2010; Hone et al., 2014).

Hypothesis 4: The FS has divergent validity with measurements that 
screen for depression symptoms and negative affect. This hypothesis 
was supported in the original validation of the FS, in which the 
scale had significant negative correlations with measurements of 
negative affect (Diener et al., 2010). More recent validations have 
found that the FS has an inverse correlation with measurements of 
depression symptoms (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016).

Hypothesis 5: The FS has configural, metric, scalar, and strict 
measurement  invariance  regarding  participants’  sex.  Prior 
research  validating  the  FS  in  the  Latin  American  context, 
specifically in Colombia, has supported the notion that the scale 
shows  invariance  at  the  configural,  metric,  and  scalar  levels, 
regarding respondents’ sex (Martín-Carbonell et al., 2021).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Participants

The  primary  sample  consisted  of  422  residents  of  the  Central 
District of Honduras. Participants’ ages varied between 18 and 69 years 
(M = 28.18;  SD = 10.58).  Most  participants  were  women  (n = 275; 
65.17%),  while  men  accounted  for  34.83%  (n = 147)  of  the  total 
sample. Participants were included if: (1) 18 years or older, and (2) 
living in the Central District of Honduras. They were selected through 
convenience,  non-probabilistic  sampling;  recruitment  was  made 
through emails and social media.

A  second  subsample  of  40  students  was  included  solely  to 
determine test–retest reliability, including undergraduate (n = 20) and 
postgraduate  (n = 20)  students.  They  were  selected  through 
convenience,  non-probabilistic  sampling.  Most  respondents  were 
women (n = 35; 87.50%), while men accounted for 12.50% (n = 5) of 
the subsample. Participants’ age in the second sample ranged between 
18 and 47 years (M = 25.60; SD = 8). All data were collected through 
online surveys using Google Forms.

2.2. Instruments

2.2.1. The Flourishing Scale

Hypothesis  1:  The  FS  has  a  unidimensional  structure  with 
adequate factorial validity. Previous validation studies have 
found the FS to be a one-factor measurement with adequate 
fit indices (Diener et al., 2010; Ramírez-Maestre et al., 2017; 
Choudhry et al., 2018).

The Flourishing Scale (FS) (Diener et al., 2010), that measures 
Flourishing on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly 
agree)  to  7  (strongly  disagree)  is  a  brief  8-item  self-report 
questionnaire. The item content of the FS relates to different aspects 
of  Flourishing  (optimism,  positive  relationships,  competence,

meaning  in  life,  being  respected  by  others,  and  life  satisfaction). 
Summative total scores range between 8 and 56; greater scores indicate 
a  higher  self-reported  Flourishing.  A  Spanish  version  of  the  FS  is 
available from the authors of the original scale (Diener and Biswas-
Diener, 2009); this version was used in the current study.

Previous research made in Spain regarding the Spanish version of 
the  FS,  has  supported  a  one-factor  solution,  which  correlated 
positively with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (r = 0.521; p > 0.001) and 
PANAS-Positive Affect subscale (r = 0.422; p > 0.001), and inversely 
related with PANAS-Negative Affect subscale (r = −0.270; p > 0.001). 
The mentioned research also concluded that the Spanish version of the 
FS  had  adequate  internal  consistency  (α = 0.846)  and  temporal 
reliability (r = 0.749; p > 0.001) (Checa et al., 2018).

2.2.2. The subjective happiness scale

The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 
1999), is a 4-item Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) 
to  7  (totally  agree).  Total  summative  scores  range  from  4  (low 
subjective happiness) to 28 (high subjective happiness). The original 
validation of the SHS reports a single-factor structure with adequate 
reliability  (α = 0.86)  and  convergent  validity  with  other  happiness 
measures (r = 0.62, p < 0.01) (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999). Based 
on the data collected in the current study, the SHS has an adequate 
internal consistency, ω = 0.75, CI 95% [0.71, 0.78]. A CFA yielded the 
following fit indices for the single-factor model: χ2(2) = 1.162; p = 0.559; 
CFI = 0.999, GFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.999; RMSEA = 0.001; SRMR = 0.008. 
The SHS was included to test Hypothesis 3.

have  found  that  the  PHQ-9  has  adequate  reliability  (α = 0.80) 
(Martínez-Martínez et al., 2021). Data from the current study further 
supports such internal consistency, ω = 0.90, CI 95% [0.88, 0.91]. A 
CFA  yielded  the  following  fit  indices  for  the  single-factor  model: 
χ2(27) = 71.680;  p < 0.001;  CFI = 0.974;  GFI = 0.981;  TLI = 0.965; 
RMSEA = 0.063;  SRMR = 0.028.  The  PHQ-9  was  included  to  test 
Hypothesis 4.

2.3. Ethical considerations and procedures

The research was done in accordance with the principles stated in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and the Code of Ethics of the Honduran 
Psychologist.  This  study  was  approved  by  the  Research  Ethics 
Committee  of  the  Faculty  of  Social  Sciences  (UNAH)  under 
registration  CEIFCS-P1-2023.  The  informed  consent  form  was 
presented to all potential participants recruited via email and social 
media. After reading the document, respondents were presented with 
closed (yes/no) questions that assessed whether: (1) they agreed to the 
informed consent, (2) they gave permission to collect their data, and 
(3) they participated voluntarily. Agreeing to the three questions was 
mandatory  to  start  the  online  survey.  The  survey  did  not  collect 
personal information to ensure anonymity. Data were collected from 
February  to  March  of  2023.  Test–retest  follow-up  was  set  at  the 
one-month mark, following the original validation of the FS (Diener 
et al., 2010).

2.2.3. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule

2.4. Data analyses

The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a widely 
used questionnaire that evaluates positive and negative affect (Díaz-
García  et  al.,  2020).  It  consists  of  20  items,  of  which  10  measure 
positive affect (for example: interested, excited, strong) and the other 
10 measure negative affect (for example: distressed, upset, scared), as 
experienced during the last week. Each item is rated on a 5-point 
Likert-type  scale,  ranging  from  1  (very  slightly  or  not  at  all)  to  5 
(extremely).  Higher  scores  indicate  a  higher  affect  intensity.  The 
original validation study of the PANAS reported adequate internal 
consistency coefficients for the Positive Affect subscale (α = 0.88) and 
the Negative Affect subscale (α = 0.87) (Watson et al., 1988). Based on 
the  current  study,  the  PANAS  achieved  an  overall  high  reliability, 
ω = 0.85, CI 95% [0.83, 0.87]. A CFA yielded the following fit indices 
for  the  two-factor  model:  χ2(169) = 674.864; p < 0.001;  CFI = 0.873; 
GFI = 0.971; TLI = 0.857; RMSEA = 0.084; SRMR = 0.070. The PANAS-
Positive Affect subscale was included to test Hypothesis 3, while the 
PANAS-Negative Affect subscale was necessary to test Hypothesis 4.

2.2.4. Patient Health Questionnaire-9

The  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9)  is  a  9-item 
questionnaire used to screen for symptoms of depression (Kroenke 
and Spitzer, 2002). The scale asks participants to rate the presence of 
specific  symptoms,  as  experienced  during  the  last  2 weeks,  on  a 
4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every 
day).  Total  summative  scores  range  between  0  (low  symptom 
prevalence) to 27 (high symptom prevalence). A validation of the 
PHQ-9  in  a  Latin  American  country  -Peru-  has  supported  a 
unidimensional  model  and  high  reliability  (ω = 0.87)  (Villarreal-
Zegarra et al., 2019). Prior studies made in the Honduran population 

All data was collected online through Google Forms. All answers 
were mandatory; therefore, the dataset does not contain missing data. 
Later, where applicable, negatively worded items were reverse scored, 
and  summative  totals  were  obtained  for  each  scale. The  statistical 
analyses were run on JASP (JASP Team, 2020). Descriptive measures 
for  the  FS  include  mean  scores  (M),  standard  deviations  (SD), 
skewness, and kurtosis. A one-sample z-test was used to compare the 
mean  scores  of  the  FS  in  the  Honduran  sample  with  those  of  the 
original validation study in the American population (Diener et al., 
2010). FS mean score comparisons by sex were made using Student’s 
t-test  for  independent  groups;  effect  size  was  estimated  through 
Cohen’s d. All testing was done at a 95% confidence level.

Later, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory 
Factor Analysis (CFA) were used to assess the scale’s factorial validity 
(Hypothesis 1); Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was also reported. The 
following fit indices for EFA and CFA were reported and analyzed 
using the following acceptability thresholds (Parry, 2017): Root Mean 
Square  Error  of  Approximation  (RMSEA)  <0.08,  Comparative  Fit 
Index (CFI) > 0.90, and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) >0.95. A general 
CFA assessment was made with no-group comparisons. Goodness of 
Fit (GFI) was also reported for the CFA, with scores >0.95 suggesting 
adequate fit (Parry, 2017).

Test–retest  reliability  was  determined  through  a  dependent 
sample  t-test  and  Spearman’s  rho  at  a  one-month  follow-up 
(Hypothesis 2). The internal consistency of the FS was estimated using 
McDonald’  ω;  scores  higher  than  0.75  are  considered  adequately 
reliable (Coolican, 2019). Then, convergent validity was investigated 
through  Pearson’s  r  correlation  coefficients  between  the  FS,  the

The sample consisted of 147 men and 275 women; df = 420. Significant p-values (p < 0.05) are marked in bold. Standard deviation = SD; t = Student’s t-test; d = Cohen’s d effect size estimator;

Subjective Happiness Scale, and the Positive Affect subscale of the 
PANAS (Hypothesis 3). On the other hand, divergent validity was 
obtained by correlating the FS with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
and the Negative Affect subscale of the PANAS (Hypothesis 4).

Finally,  invariance  measurements  were  obtained  for  multi-
group comparisons based on the respondents’ sex (Hypothesis 5). 
A  four-stage  approach  was  used,  consisting  of:  (1)  configural 
invariance (no equality constraints), (2) metric invariance (loading 
equality constraints), (3) scalar invariance (loadings and intercept 
equality constraints), and (4) strict invariance (loadings, intercept, 
residual and residual covariance equality restraints). Changes (Δ) 
in  CFI,  Standardized  Root  Mean  Square  Residual  (SRMR),  and 
RMSEA  scores  were  evaluated  to  determine  measurement 
invariance. Using a similar methodology as recent validations of the 
FS (Romano et al., 2020), the following thresholds were identified: 
ΔCFI ≤ −0.010, ΔSRMR ≥0.030, or ΔRMSEA ≥0.015. At least two 
coefficient  changes  had  to  fit  the  thresholds  to  consider 
measurement invariance.

3. Results

3.1. Description of the Flourishing Scale 
items

The overall FS score was 46.65 (SD = 8.05); this is higher than the 
score in the original validation of the FS (M = 44.97; SD = 6.56), as 
Diener et al. (2010) reported. A one-sample z-test determined this 
difference was statistically significant (p > 0.01). Total FS scores had a 
skewness  of  −1.34  and  a  kurtosis  of  2.06.  Individual  items’  mean 
scores ranged between 5.47 (SD = 1.43; Item 2) and 6.20 (SD = 1.22; 
Item 5). Overall, the total FS score did not vary significantly between 
men  (M = 47.37;  SD = 7.50)  and  women  (M = 46.26;  SD = 8.32), 
p = 0.18. However, men scored significantly higher in Item 1 and Item 
7, see Table 1.

3.2. Factorial validity

FS.  Bartlett’s  Test  of  Sphericity  yielded  a  statistically  significant 
coefficient (X2 = 1536.75, df = 28, p < 0.001), suggesting the correlation 
matrix  is  suitable  for  factor  analysis.  EFA  analysis  suggests  a 
unidimensional structure, see Table 2. All items show a high factor 
loading (>0.50), with a maximum likelihood method General MSA of 
0.90. The rotated solution achieved a proportion variance of 0.49; 
X2(20) = 92.63; p < 0.001. According to the EFA, the unidimensional 
model  achieved  adequate  fit 
indices:  CFI = 0.95;  TLI = 0.93; 
SRMR = 0.042, RMSEA = 0.09. Additionally, the global CFA results 
suggest  further  evidence  in  favor  of  the  unidimensional  factor 
structure of the FS (CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.09; GFI = 0.99); 
this supports Hypothesis 1.

3.3. Reliability of the Flourishing Scale

The  FS  achieved  a  high  internal  consistency  with  McDonald’s 
ω = 0.89, 95% CI [0.86, 0.91]. The average inter-item correlation was 
0.48, 95% CI [0.43, 0.53]. Using Student’s t-test for paired samples, 
results indicate that none of the FS items varied significantly between 
baseline and post-test, see Table 3. Additionally, Spearman’s rho was 
used  to  correlate  test–retest  scores;  this  yielded  a  statistically 
significant correlation coefficient of 0.66 (p < 0.001). These findings 
suggest the FS has adequate temporal reliability at the one-month 
follow-up, supporting Hypothesis 2.

3.4. Convergent and divergent validity

Using  Pearson’s  r  coefficient,  the  FS  had  adequate  convergent 
validity with the Subjective Happiness Scale (r = 0.70; p < 0.001) and 
the  PANAS-Positive  Affect  Subscale  (r = 0.70;  p < 0.001),  thus 
supporting Hypothesis 3. Coherently, it correlates inversely with the 
PANAS-Negative Affect Subscale (r = −0.34; p < 0.001) and the PHQ-9 
(r = −0.51;  p < 0.001),  supporting  Hypothesis  4.  Altogether,  these 
findings provide support in favor of the validity of the FS.

3.5. Measurement invariance

Based on the differences in CFI, SRMR, and RMSEA, the results 
suggest  that  the  FS  has  metric,  scalar,  and  strict  measurement 
invariance with regard to the respondents’ sex (Hypothesis 5), see 
Table 4.

4. Discussion

The results support the unidimensionality of the Spanish version 
of the FS. The one-factor model has also been supported in other 
studies within the Latin American context (Da Fonseca et al., 2015). 
The  FS  also  has  adequate  test–retest  reliability  at  the  one-month 
follow-up, with a rho of 0.66, constituting a large effect size (Cohen, 
1992).  Additionally,  the  FS  achieved  a  high  internal  consistency 
(McDonald’s ω = 0.89).

Regarding validity, scores on the FS are positively related to 
scores on the SHS and the PANAS-Positive Affect subscale. This 
is in line with the theoretical dynamic between such variables, as

happiness  and  positive  feelings  are  core  components  of 
Flourishing (Weele and Tyler, 2017). Additional support for the 
validity  of  the  FS  was  found  when  determining  its  inverse 
relationship  with  scores  on  the  PHQ-9  and  PANAS-Negative 
Affect  subscale.  Previous  research  has  also  concluded  that 
Flourishing  is  a  protective  factor  against  poor  mental  health 
outcomes  (Burns  et  al.,  2022).  The  data  supports  the  metric, 
scalar, and strict measurement invariance of the Spanish version 
of the FS concerning the respondents’ sex.

Measuring Flourishing is helpful for several reasons. Firstly, it 
allows  researchers  and  policymakers  to  understand  the  factors 
contributing  to  wellbeing  and  happiness  among  individuals  and 
communities (Weele and Tyler, 2017). Through an evidence-based 
approach, this understanding can be used to develop policies and 
programs that are more effective in promoting human development 
and reducing poverty and inequality. Such an approach may inform 
strategic decisions for developing programs and public policies aimed 
at preventive aspects of mental health promotion (Trudel-Fitzgerald 
et al., 2019).

Secondly, measuring Flourishing can help identify populations at 
risk of poor wellbeing and needing intervention (Roche et al., 2019). 
The effectiveness of existing policies and programs can be evaluated 
through  measurements  of  Flourishing. This  information  can  then 
be  used  to  improve  the  design  and  implementation  of  future 
interventions based on population needs. Flourishing measurements 
can  provide  a  benchmark  for  the  progress  of  society  and  the 
government’s efforts to improve the wellbeing of its citizens. It is a way 
to track the progress and adjust the policies accordingly, ensuring that 
society is moving toward social development (Landa-Blanco, 2021). 
Measuring Flourishing can also provide valuable insights into the 
impact  of  certain  events,  such  as  natural  disasters,  economic 
downturns,  or  pandemics,  on  the  wellbeing  of  individuals  and 
communities. Considering many of these events are unpredictable, 
having  a  Flourishing  baseline  readily  available  through  universal 
screenings may be useful; as measuring Flourishing before and after 
these events, researchers and policymakers can understand the event’s 
impact  and  develop  interventions  to  mitigate  any  adverse  effects 
on wellbeing.

However,  the  present  study  has 

limitations  that  must 
be considered. Firstly, the non-probabilistic sampling selection limits 
the generalization of the results. Future studies should aim to include 
more  representative  samples  from  Honduras  and  other  global 
populations. Secondly, data were collected online. Therefore, people 
without  access  to  the  internet  or  technological  devices,  such  as 
computers  or  mobile  phones,  could  not  participate  in  the  survey. 
Thirdly, no linguistic validation of the FS was done; this could have 
provided insights into respondents’ interpretation of individual items. 
Fourthly, replications and further studies are needed to understand

the  FS  functioning  in  low-and-middle-income  countries,  as  the 
overall  research  production  of  the  global  South  is  still  limited 
(Albanna et al., 2021); this has led to a significant gap in the literature 
regarding  Flourishing  in  Spanish-speaking  countries  (Waigel  and 
Lemos, 2023).

In conclusion, the current data support the one-factor structure 
of the Spanish version of the FS in the Honduran population. The scale 
also  had  high  internal  consistency  and  temporal  reliability  at  the 
one-month follow-up. Convergent and divergent validity has been 
established,  as  well  as  metric,  scalar,  and  strict  measurement 
invariance  concerning  the  respondents’  sex.  Validating  the  FS  in 
specific populations, like Honduras, is essential to ensure the scale is 
appropriate and relevant for the contexts and cultures in which they 
will be used. It can also be used to better understand Flourishing in 
the Honduran and other global populations, which, in turn, can also 
facilitate  the  development  of  interventions  and  programs  that 
promote wellbeing.
