Abstract
Gender differences in mental health emerge as early as in childhood and adolescence, highlighting the potential need for 
gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care. However, it is unclear how gender-specific child and adolescent 
mental health care is implemented and whether its’ approaches are useful. Therefore, this study reviews gender-specific 
interventions and their effectiveness for child and adolescent mental health. Five databases were searched for articles pub-
lished between 2000 and 2021. In total, 43 studies were included. Most interventions were conducted in school (n = 15) or 
community settings (n = 8). Substance-related disorders (n = 13) and eating disorders (n = 12) were addressed most frequently. 
Most interventions targeted girls (n = 31). Various gender-specific aspects were considered, including gender-specific risk 
and protective factors (n = 35) and needs (n = 35). Although most interventions yielded significant improvements in mental 
health outcomes (n = 32), only few studies reported medium or large effect sizes (n = 13). Additionally, there was a lack of 
strong causal evidence derived from randomized controlled trials, calling for more rigorous trials in the research field. Nev-
ertheless, our findings indicate that gender-specific mental health care can be a promising approach to meet gender-specific 
mental health needs.

Introduction

Gender,  referring  to  the  psychological,  behavioral  and 
sociocultural aspects associated with sex [1], is an impor-
tant  determinant  for  mental  health  outcomes  and  care. 
Several studies have revealed gender differences in terms 
of prevalence and clinical presentation for various mental 
health problems in children and adolescents such as eat-
ing disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct problems, and

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [2, 3]. For 
example, internalizing problems such as anxiety disorders 
occur more often among girls than boys [4], whereas exter-
nalizing problems such as conduct problems are more com-
mon in boys than in girls [5]. Furthermore, there are gender 
differences regarding coping strategies, symptomatology 
and medication [6–9]. There are also gender differences in 
child and adolescent mental health care regarding the fre-
quency of service use [10], the age at referral [11], as well 
as in the willingness to use mental health care [12]: Com-
pared to girls, boys are referred at a younger age [10, 11], 
whereas girls are more likely to obtain treatment in early 
adulthood [11]. Furthermore, adolescent boys are less will-
ing to use mental health services than girls [12]. For vari-
ous mental health problems, such as depressive symptoms 
[13, 14], substance use/abuse [15] or eating disorders [16], 
different risk and protective factors have been identified 
for girls and boys. Additionally, research on the etiology 
of mental health problems points towards the existence of 
gender-specific processes in their development [17, 18]. For

example, rumination seems to contribute to the development 
of depression in girls, but not in boys [18].

In addition to this predominantly binary (girls vs. boys) 
and heteronormative view of gender differences, existing 
research demonstrates that transgender, gender variant or 
non-binary youth experience mental health problems, such 
as depression, suicidality and eating disorders, at an elevated 
rate compared to the general population [19–21]. Sexual and 
gender minorities (SGM), an umbrella term for individu-
als who do not identify as heterosexual or cisgender (e.g., 
transgender), face high levels of stigmatization and discrimi-
nation, and often adverse mental health outcomes [22].

Mental  health  problems  emerging  in  these  early  life 
stages account for a large proportion of the global burden 
of disease [23], have economic long-term consequences 
[24], and often persist into adulthood [25, 26]. Additionally, 
research suggests that the persistence differs by gender, for 
instance, girls show a more persistent course of mood and 
anxiety disorders than boys [25]. In summary, there are sev-
eral gender differences in mental health outcomes and care. 
Hence, considering gender aspects in child and adolescent 
mental health care is crucial for developing effective pro-
grams and thereby addressing gender-related mental health 
disparities early.

Programs that acknowledge gender roles and norms and 
consider and account for specific gender-related needs can 
be described as “gender-specific” [27, 28]. Furthermore, 
heteronormativity  is  an  important  gender-related  aspect 
that should be addressed in gender-specific care [28], high-
lighting the need to consider not only aspects related to 
gender (e.g., female, transgender, etc.) but also to sexual 
identity (e.g., heterosexual, bisexual, etc.). Rationales for 
gender-specific interventions comprise (1) responding to 
gender-specific psychological aspects (e.g., gender-related 
needs and experiences), (2) providing a safe space and a 
supportive, empowering environment, (3) assuming a greater 
effectiveness of gender-specific compared to gender-non-
specific interventions, and (4) thereby addressing gender 
disparities and contributing to the achievement of social 
justice [29]. Importantly, approaches that address one sex 
without addressing gender-specific aspects (mere single-sex 
interventions) are non-gender-specific programs [28].

Child and adolescent mental health care programs can 
also vary in the timing of intervention. A common distinc-
tion is made between prevention (before the onset of any 
disorder, focus on reducing risk factors and enhancing pro-
tective factors) and treatment programs (treating an already 
existing disorder) [30]. There are universal programs (target-
ing a whole population) and selective programs (targeting 
individuals or subgroups with a significantly higher risk of 
developing mental health problems) [31].

The development of gender-specific prevention programs 
for substance abuse began when substance abuse among 

girls increased in the mid-1990s, and studies showed that 
girls did not benefit from existing programs [15,  32]. A 
frequently addressed gender-specific aspect of these early 
programs was the focus on family relationships (a specific 
risk factor for girls) [15]. At this same time, the first gender-
specific aggression interventions for girls were developed 
[32]. These treatment programs often focused on the differ-
ent expression of aggression in girls vs. boys (relational vs. 
physical aggression) [32].

Despite these early developments, there are a few reviews 
of gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care 
for certain disorders (e.g., substance use/abuse [15]), set-
tings (e.g., school [32]), and populations (e.g., SGM [33, 
34]). However, a comprehensive review of gender-specific 
child and adolescent mental health care programs, without 
focusing on one specific mental health problem, setting, or 
population is lacking to better understand how their imple-
mentation and effectiveness might differ. Therefore, the pur-
pose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of 
gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care by 
collating and critically appraising the existing research. It 
aims (1) to summarize and evaluate various gender-specific 
mental health care programs, (2) to identify the gender-spe-
cific aspects commonly addressed in these programs and (3) 
to synthesize their effectiveness, in order to derive implica-
tions for clinicians and health care providers. Further objec-
tives are to identify gaps in knowledge and research, in order 
to make recommendations for future research.

Methods

Eligibility Criteria

To meet inclusion criteria, publications had to: (1) be pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals or books; (2) be written in 
English or German (due to limited language, time and finan-
cial resources); (3) be published between January 2000 and 
May 2021; (4) describe or evaluate interventions for children 
and adolescents (M ≤ 21 years, to include also late adoles-
cence [35], and a minority of adults, to ensure the focus 
on children and adolescents and simultaneously acknowl-
edge the fact that adolescent mental health care sometimes 
comprises young adults); (5) describe or evaluate a spe-
cific gender-specific intervention (any kind of intervention 
addressing gender-specific aspects; Fig. 1); and (6) address 
mental health care in different settings (e.g., child and ado-
lescent psychiatric, psychological or psychotherapeutic care; 
school settings). Furthermore, articles were excluded if they: 
(1) were news, editorials, commentaries, reviews or case 
reports; (2) described or evaluated a non-gender-specific 
intervention (Fig. 1); (3) described or evaluated a gender-
affirming intervention; or (4) did not focus on mental health.

Search Strategy

The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [36]. 
We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Social Sci-
ence Citation Index, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX and Cochrane 
Library. Databases were searched by combining relevant 
text words and medical subject headings. We adapted the 
search strategies to each database (Appendix A). The search 
strategies covered the following topics: gender specificity, 
mental health care, and children and adolescents.

Electronic searches were complemented by reference list 
screening, citation tracking and hand searches in Google 
Scholar. Additionally, reviews with various focuses were 
screened  [15,  16,  32–34,  37–46]  to  find  gender-specific 
interventions  which  were  not  specifically  described  as 
“gender-specific” or with related terms and therefore not 
retrieved via electronic database search.

Study Selection

After removing the duplicates (with EndNote and manual 
checking), we transferred the records to Rayyan [47], an 
online software for the screening process. We identified 
potentially relevant articles by reviewing the titles, abstracts 
and keywords of all retrieved records. Three reviewers (LG, 
LH, MG) performed the title-abstract screening, wherein 
one  reviewer  (LH)  screened  all  titles  and  abstracts  and 

two reviewers (LG, MG) each additionally screened 10% 
with substantial agreement ( 𝜅 = 0.62–0.73) [48]. The full-
texts were screened by three reviewers: One reviewer (LH) 
assessed each full-text and two reviewers (LG, MG) each 
additionally  assessed  13%  with  moderate  to  substantial 
agreement ( 𝜅 = 0.48–0.72) [48]. Discrepancies between the 
raters were discussed until consensus was reached.

Data Extraction

One reviewer (LH) extracted data from the included studies 
using a data extraction table with the following headings: 
author(s) and year of publication, country, setting, interven-
tion type, description and components, gender specificity, 
target group, participants, age, study design, main outcome 
measures, main outcomes, and rating of study quality. Two 
reviewers cross-checked the data extraction (LG, MG).

Critical Appraisal

The included studies were critically appraised using the 
Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATQS) 
[49]. In previous evaluations the QATQS was found to be 
valid and reliable [50]. The QATQS rates methodologic 
study quality based on six criteria: selection bias, study 
design,  confounders,  blinding,  data  collection  method, 
and  withdrawals  and  drop-outs.  Each  study  receives  a 
global rating as weak, moderate, or strong. Three authors

independently evaluated the studies. Discrepancies were 
discussed and resolved through consensus.

Results

Synthesis of Effectiveness

Effect sizes were extracted and transformed to Cohen’s d. 
Several studies reported data on different mental health out-
comes. In these cases, the effect sizes were averaged within 
each study. Effect sizes were transformed with the Psycho-
metrica online calculator [51]. Studies that reported non-sig-
nificant results (without giving additional information) were 
set to an effect size of d = 0.00, a procedure which yields 
conservative effect sizes [52]. If effect sizes were reported as 
small, medium or large without specifying which effect sizes 
were computed, we applied the lower limits of d according 
to Cohen’s conventions [53].

Searches yielded 3,627 records, of which 157 articles were 
potentially relevant for inclusion in this review (Fig. 2). 
After full-text screening, 50 publications were included, 
covering a total of 43 studies (Appendix B).

Study Characteristics

The included 43 articles were published between 2001 and 
2020 (Table 1). Almost all studies (n = 41) were conducted 
in  North  America  or  Europe.  The  interventions  were 
mostly carried out in school (n = 15) or community settings 
(n = 8). Most of the studies assessed either universal pre-
vention programs (n = 18) or treatments (n = 16). The most 
commonly targeted mental health problems were related to 
the DSM-5 [54] diagnostic categories “Substance-Related 
and Addictive Disorders” (n = 13) and “Feeding and Eat-
ing Disorders” (n = 12). Target groups were predominantly 
girls (n = 31) and adolescents (age ≥ 12,  n = 35). In total,

ences
b Some of the included interventions targeted more than one age group
c There was one intervention targeting adult staff working with adoles-
cent females

19 studies were clinical controlled trials (i.e., experimen-
tal  clinical  studies  without  randomization),  12  cohort 
studies (i.e., one-group pretest–posttest), six randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), four cohort analytic studies (i.e., 
two-group pretest–posttest), one interrupted time series, 
and one mixed-methods study. The study designs were 
classified according to the QATQS dictionary [55]. Sam-
ple sizes ranged from 7 to 2516 participants (M = 380).

Study Quality

For  two  studies  the  study  quality  could  not  be  rated 
because several criteria of the QATQS were not appli-
cable. The study quality among the remaining 41 studies 
was heterogeneous: 14 studies (34.1%) received a weak, 
19 studies (46.3%) a moderate and eight studies (19.5%) 
a strong rating.

Implementation of Gender‑Specific Aspects

We grouped the studies depending on their targeted men-
tal health problem as the interventions for each diagnos-
tic category had similar gender-specific approaches. Study 
details and references of each intervention are presented in 
Appendix B.

1 31492

Mood Disorders

In total, we identified three studies in the field of mood dis-
orders [56–58], all studies (n = 3) targeted SGM youth of 
diverse sex and gender. One study each was conducted in 
a community [56], family [57] and individual setting [58]. 
All interventions were treatments for depression/suicidality 
[56–58].

Gender-specific aims of all treatments (n = 3) were to 
meet the mental health needs of depressed/suicidal SGM 
youth. Treatment programs attended to common issues and 
situations, such as invalidating reactions or bullying due to 
SGM identity [56–58]. Furthermore, most treatments (n = 2) 
addressed gender-specific risk and protective factors (e.g., 
family support) [56, 57], used gender-specific role models 
and facilitators (e.g., SGM community members) [56, 58], 
and provided future support and resources (e.g., allies) [56, 
57].

One example is “Rainbow SPARX”, a computerized cog-
nitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, adapted to 
the needs of SGM youth [58]. The gender-adapted version 
provides the option to create gender non-conforming avatars 
and addresses relevant situations (e.g., coming out) and chal-
lenges (e.g., harassment) for SGM individuals [58].

Trauma‑ and Stressor‑Related Disorders

Five studies reported interventions for trauma- and stressor-
related  disorders  [59–63].  The  target  populations  were 
mainly girls (n = 4) [59–62]. Most interventions (n = 4) were 
community-based [60–63] and all interventions were treat-
ments for sexually abused or traumatized youth [59–63].

All treatments (n = 5) aimed to meet gender-specific men-
tal health needs of sexually abused or traumatized youth 
[59–63], for example by considering the heightened risk 
for a history of sexual abuse among incarcerated girls [59]. 
Additionally, most treatments (n = 4) addressed common risk 
(e.g., guilt and shame) and protective factors (e.g., skills and 
individual strengths) of these youth [59–61, 63].

One example is “Project Kealahou”, providing a gender- 
and culturally-responsive system of care to meet the mental 
health needs of traumatized girls [62]. Girls can participate 
in prosocial activities and girls groups. The treatment, which 
is mainly delivered by female staff, aims to provide a safe 
space for this vulnerable population [62].

Feeding and Eating Disorders

We found 12 studies for eating disorders [64–79], of which 
most were for girls (n = 10) [65–75, 78, 79] and delivered in 
school settings (n = 10) [64–71, 76–79]. Two interventions 
addressed mixed-gender groups (girls and boys) [64, 76, 77]. 

Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2024) 55:1487–1501

Four studies evaluated universal interventions [64, 66, 68, 
69] and eight prevention programs [65, 67, 70–79].

First, all universal interventions (n = 4) targeted the body 
image by reflecting on female beauty ideals and myths, 
which are considered risk factors for the development of 
eating disorders [64, 66, 68, 69]. Additionally, most uni-
versal interventions (n = 3) taught body acceptance [64, 68, 
69]. One example is “Happy Being Me”, a gender-adapted 
intervention for both girls and boys. The intervention reflects 
both  female  and  male  beauty  ideals  and  promotes  body 
acceptance [64].

Second, prevention programs (n = 8) focused on female 
beauty ideals and the sociocultural pressure to be thin as 
gender-specific risk factors [65, 67, 70–79]. One example 
is the universal prevention program “PriMa” that addresses 
several risk and protective factors for anorexia nervosa in 
girls, such as female beauty ideals, media literacy and body 
images [78, 79]. The program targets only adolescent girls, 
given the need for effective prevention programs in this 
high-risk population [78, 79].

Disruptive, Impulse‑Control, and Conduct Disorders

Five studies evaluated interventions for aggression or con-
duct problems [80–84]. All interventions were treatments 
for girls and were delivered in residential facilities (n = 3) 
[80–82] or community settings (n = 2) [83, 84].

The gender-specific focus of all treatments (n = 5) was 
to attend to gender-specific issues since aggression is often 
expressed differently in girls compared to boys [80–84], 
with relational aggression being more pronounced among 
girls [80, 82]. Additionally, most studies (n = 4) evaluated 
programs that were explicitly developed or gender-adapted 
due to the lack of treatments for aggression in adolescent 
girls [80–82, 84].

One example is the intervention “A Girls’ Relationship 
Group” [80,  82]. The treatment takes risk and protective 
factors (e.g., experiences of violence and coping strategies), 
relational aspects of aggression, gender-specific conflicts 
and situations, and gender-role socialization into account. 
Furthermore, participating girls are empowered and positive 
self-images are promoted [80, 82].

Substance‑Related and Addictive Disorders

In total, 13 studies investigated interventions for substance 
use/abuse [85–100]. Most interventions (n = 10) targeted 
girls [85–87, 90–96, 98–100]. The settings were heteroge-
neous, with most studies conducted in school (n = 4) [85, 86, 
88, 89, 92], family (n = 4) [87, 93–95] or individual (n = 3) 
[96–99]  settings.  The  studies  comprised  12  prevention 
[85–89, 91–100] and one treatment study [90, 91].

1 3 
Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2024) 55:1487–1501 

1493

First, most prevention programs (n = 11) addressed gen-
der-specific risk and protective factors for substance abuse, 
such as stress or the mother-daughter relationship [85–89, 
91,  93–100].  Furthermore,  most  studies  aimed  to  meet 
gender-specific needs (n = 10) [85–89, 91, 94–96, 98–100]. 
One example is the internet-delivered prevention program 
for Asian American girls that addresses specific risk and 
protective factors (e.g., depressive moods and self-efficacy) 
to meet the mental health needs of this underserved minority 
group [87]. Additionally, the program aims to strengthen the 
mother-daughter relationship and addresses other common 
issues (e.g., body image) [87].

Second,  we  identified  one  treatment  program  named 
“HEART” which is a residential substance abuse treatment 
for girls [90, 91]. It focuses on the multifaceted needs, issues, 
and risk factors (e.g., other mental health problems, peer 
influence, abuse history) of these girls, considers sociocul-
tural influences, feminist perspectives and aims to empower 
the participants [90, 91].

Personality Disorders

We found one study describing a treatment for personality 
disorders: “ACTiv” is a gender-adapted version of the dia-
lectical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) [101]. It 
is tailored to the needs and issues of adolescent boys with 
borderline symptoms by considering the elevated aggres-
siveness and impulsiveness in boys compared to girls, and 
by using a more action-oriented approach than the original 
DBT-A [101].

Other Mental Health Problems

Two interventions [102, 103] targeted other mental health 
problems: Hampel et al. [102] evaluated a school-based uni-
versal stress prevention program for girls and boys. Gender-
specific needs, coping strategies, role models, situations and 
gendered stereotypes are important aspects of the program 
[102]. The other intervention named “Progress” is a com-
munity-based treatment program for adolescent girls with at 
risk-behavior. The program addresses developmental tasks 
and issues of adolescent girls [103].

Mental Health Care Setting

We found two studies addressing gender-specific aspects in 
the mental health care setting [104, 105]. Crable et al. [104] 
evaluated a trauma-informed training curriculum for staff 
members working with adolescent girls in residential care. 
The goal of the training is to increase the staff’s knowledge 
and awareness of the girls’ mental health needs and risk and 
protective factors [104]. Guss et al. [105] developed and 
added gender-related questions to clinic intake forms that 

included the correct name, pronouns, gender identity and 
birth-assigned sex. The intervention aims to better identify 
transgender adolescents in order to support them properly 
and meet their mental health needs.

Summary of Gender‑Specific Aspects

In  summary,  gender-specific  risk  and  protective  factors 
(n = 35; e.g., female beauty ideals), mental health needs 
(n = 35; e.g., of sexually abused youth) as well as tasks, 
challenges and issues (n = 27; e.g., developmental tasks of 
adolescent girls) were the most commonly addressed gender-
specific aspects in the included studies (n = 43; see Table 2 
for more details on gender-specific aspects).

Effectiveness of Gender‑Specific Interventions

For an overview of the effectiveness of gender-specific inter-
ventions, see Table 3. In total, 39 studies provided data on 
the effectiveness of the interventions regarding mental health 
outcomes. The applied methodology differed substantially. 
First, most studies that used control groups (n = 29) applied 
no-intervention control conditions (n = 17), and one single 
intervention a gender-neutral program as control condition 
[92]. Second, the duration between baseline and follow-up 
ranged from post-treatment to 8-year follow-ups. Lastly, the 
studies utilized various mental health measures.

Most of the interventions (n = 32) yielded significant 
improvements in mental health outcomes at post-treatment 
or follow-up. However, only 29 studies reported effect sizes. 
The effects sizes were heterogeneous: Seven studies yielded 
no effects (24.1%) and nine small (31.0%), four medium 
(13.8%) and nine large (31.0%) effect sizes. The mean effect 
size was medium (d = 0.55). When looking only at controlled 
studies (e.g., RCTs, n = 22), six studies yielded no effects 
(27.3%) and nine small (40.9%), three medium (13.6%), and 
four large (18.2%) effect sizes. The mean effect size among 
controlled studies was small (d = 0.37).

Most studies that yielded no effects assessed school-based 
universal prevention programs targeting eating disorders 
(n = 4). Although most of the programs (with no effects) 
yielded improvements on the short-term (n = 4), the effects 
could not be maintained at follow-up.

Large effect sizes were especially found for interventions 
targeting mood, trauma- and stressor-related, and personal-
ity disorders (n = 4). Interventions with these targets also 
showed large mean effect sizes (d = 1.26–1.75), whereas 
interventions targeting feeding and eating disorders yielded 
on average small effect sizes (d = 0.26). Especially treatment 
programs yielded large effects (n = 5). Treatment programs 
also yielded larger mean effect sizes (d = 1.10) than uni-
versal interventions (d = 0.39) and selective and universal

prevention programs (d = 0.44 and d = 0.31). With regard 
to the settings, large effect sizes were especially yielded 
in clinical settings and the juvenile justice system (n = 2, 
d = 0.80–1.32).  Additionally,  uncontrolled  studies  such 
as cohort studies yielded more often large effects (n = 5) 
and on average larger effect sizes than controlled studies 
such as RCTs (d = 1.07 vs. d = 0.37). One example for an 
intervention yielding large effects is the culturally modified 
trauma-focused CBT for posttraumatic stress symptoms in 
war-affected adolescent girls with a history of sexual abuse 
evaluated by O’Callaghan et al. [60]. At the 3-month fol-
low-up, posttraumatic stress symptoms had significantly 
decreased, and psychosocial functioning improved (for more 
details, see Appendix B, page 2). Limitations of this RCT 
include a small sample size (n = 52) and the fact that the 
intervention group could not be compared to the waitlist-
group at follow-up as the waitlist-group had already received 
treatment at this point in time [60].

Discussion

This systematic review provides an overview of gender-
specific child and adolescent mental health care. It aims at 
summarizing and evaluating gender-specific child and ado-
lescent mental health care programs, identifying gender-
specific aspects commonly addressed in these programs and 
synthesizing their effectiveness.

In  total,  we  identified  43  studies.  Most  interventions 
were conducted in school or community settings which is 
in line with previous research showing that most youth with 
mental health problems are seen in non-healthcare settings 
[106, 107]. Furthermore, nearly half of the studies assessed 
prevention programs. We find it intriguing that gender-spe-
cific concepts play a role in the development of preventive 
interventions, but less so in treatment programs. Further 
light should be shed on whether this is a conceptual gap or 
whether actual gender-specific approaches are not labeled as 
such in the realm of treatment.

In our review, most interventions targeted substance-
related and addictive disorders as well as eating disorders. 
Additionally, over 70% of the studies evaluated interventions 
exclusively for (mostly adolescent) girls. Taken together, 
these findings are not surprising since girls/women have 
traditionally been neglected in substance treatment which 
has resulted in the development of female-specific treat-
ments in the last decades [15]. Regarding eating disorders, 
adolescent girls have been the focus of prevention programs 
for a long time because they are at particularly high risk 
[108]. This trend has contributed to the exclusion of male 
and SGM individuals from eating disorder prevention pro-
grams even though (particularly pre-adolescent) boys and 
SGM individuals have high risks, too [109]. Only two of 
43 studies (one yielding a large effect, one with no effect) 
focused exclusively on boys, indicating a large research gap. 
Reasons for this research gap include the lack of awareness 
of male or non-female disordered eating and the emphasis in

most research on anorexia nervosa, as binge eating disorders 
are more prevalent among males [109]. Furthermore, the 
focus on a small number of mental health problems provides 
important directions for future research.

Gender specificity was implemented differently depend-
ing on the targeted mental health problem and population. 
For instance, addressing family support and minority stress-
ors seemed to be an important aspect in treating mood dis-
orders among SGM youth [56, 58], whereas eating disorder 

1 3 
Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2024) 55:1487–1501 

1497

interventions mainly targeted girls’ beauty ideals and body 
acceptance [64–79].

Most of the interventions addressed several gender-spe-
cific aspects, highlighting that gender-specific interventions 
should consider multiple factors and experiences that inter-
sect with each other. For example, gender norms and ideals 
(e.g., “thin ideal”), developmental tasks (e.g., puberty and 
related body changes), and resulting gender-specific men-
tal health needs (e.g., effective prevention of eating disor-
ders) are interconnected. On the one hand, a specific gender 
involves not only experiences on biological, psychological, 
and sociocultural levels, but also individual experiences that 
differ in gender groups without being specifically related to 
gendered roles (e.g., the role of rumination in girls’ depres-
sion) [110]. On the other hand, addressing several gender-
specific aspects at once may indicate a lack of an appropriate 
etiological basis, otherwise required by experts in the field 
[32].

When looking at both controlled and uncontrolled studies, 
as we did in the present review, our findings indicate that 
most gender-specific interventions led to an improvement in 
mental health outcomes (particularly in mood, trauma- and 
stressor-related, and personality disorders). However, only 
29 of the 43 studies reported effect sizes and only few stud-
ies (n = 13) yielded medium or large effects. Additionally, 
the outcomes regarding the effectiveness were heterogene-
ous and a comparison between programs was challenging 
because they differed in modality, duration, and setting. The 
studies yielded on average medium effect sizes with treat-
ment studies yielding larger effects than universal interven-
tion and prevention programs. This is in accordance with 
other reviews reporting a “hierarchy in  effect  sizes” for 
different intervention types with treatment studies yielding 
larger effects than prevention studies [111]. Assuming that 
most participants in prevention programs or universal inter-
ventions do not have severe symptoms, a reduction of symp-
toms or significant effects may be harder to find in these 
populations. This may also partially explain why universal 
body image programs and eating disorder prevention pro-
grams often yielded small or no effects.

However, the results regarding the effectiveness must be 
interpreted cautiously due to methodological deficits for 
some studies including lacking control groups, small sam-
ple sizes, short-term follow-ups and poor study quality. 
For instance, when examining only controlled studies, the 
average effect size was small (d = 0.37), and 27% yielded 
no effects. Thus, by including uncontrolled studies (for 
the purpose of a comprehensive review of gender-specific 
programs in this field), the reported improvements may 
be attributed to other factors. In summary, strong causal 
evidence (derived from RCTs) is lacking, calling for more 
RCTs in this research field.

Two  other  limitations  concern  our  search  strategy. 
We did not include terms related to sex and gender (e.g., 
“boy”/“girl”  or  “transgender”)  as  adding  these  terms 
would have led to more than 20,000 additional results only 
in PubMed. With a more comprehensive search strategy, 
additional publications that do not include terms refer-
ring  to  “gender-specific”  or  “sex-specific”  could  have 
been detected. However, we were aware of this limitation 
and decided to use our search strategy primarily for two 
reasons: First, we wanted to know how gender-specific 
aspects are considered and thus also how “gender-specific” 
is currently understood in child and adolescent mental 
health  care.  Secondly,  we  conducted  pilot  searches  to 
ensure that our search was specific, but not overly sensi-
tive. These pilot searches revealed that adding sex- and 
gender-related terms produced a lot of noise and few rel-
evant records. To counter this limitation, we also screened 
impactful reviews and reference lists. We found it intrigu-
ing that gender-specific interventions very often addressed 
mental health problems that are more prevalent in another 
gender group (e.g., female-specific interventions for sub-
stance disorders). We believe this could be symptomatic 
in areas in which regular interventions largely point to a 
specific gender group, maybe even with a gender-specific 
approach, but fail to label the interventions as gender-
specific. These limitations might be addressed in future 
studies, for example by analyzing and comparing interven-
tion manuals of single-gender and mixed-gender interven-
tions. Additionally, we restricted our search to English and 
German publications due to limited language, financial 
and time resources. Consequently, publications in other 
languages were excluded and the samples of the included 
studies  were  mostly  drawn  from  Western,  Educated, 
Industrialized,  Rich,  and  Democratic  (WEIRD)  coun-
tries—highlighting the dearth of studies from more diverse 
countries that impacts many different research fields [112].
Another  limitation  resulting  from  time  constraints  is 
that the screening process was primarily conducted by one 
author, while two other authors could only screen 10–13% 
each in the given time. However, the authors were in con-
stant exchange and additionally consulted with the research 
group.

We identified only a single study comparing a gender-
specific to a non-gender-specific intervention. Consequently, 
this review does not allow any conclusions regarding the 
comparative effectiveness of gender-specific vs. non-gender-
specific interventions. On the one hand, this underlines an 
important research gap. On the other hand, it highlights that 
possible superior effectiveness is not the only rationale for 
gender-specific care. For instance, from a consumer perspec-
tive, a safe space where youth can be empowered and sup-
ported by peers and where they can share and explore their 
gendered experiences is also important [113].

Our review focused on gender in child and adolescent 
mental health care. Moreover, other social indicators, such 
as ethnicity and socioeconomic status, have an important 
impact on child and adolescent mental health outcomes and 
care [114, 115]. For this reason, we reported the ethnic/racial 
diversity for the included studies (Appendix B). Since these 
different social indicators interact with each other and shape 
individual experiences and health outcomes (intersectional-
ity) [116], future research should assess how other (intersect-
ing) social indicators are addressed in gender-specific care.
There are many approaches to advance the research on 
gender-specific care derived from this review. Researchers 
and mental health professionals can

few mental health problems. To further advance the field 
of gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care, 
researchers  and  mental  health  professionals  are  called 
upon to develop and evaluate gender-specific interventions 
targeting other mental health problems and populations, in 
order to foster gender equity in mental health.

behavior or thinking.

Summary

In conclusion, this systematic review provides a compre-

many studies was limited and the effectiveness heterogene-
ous. Additionally, gender-specific interventions focused on
