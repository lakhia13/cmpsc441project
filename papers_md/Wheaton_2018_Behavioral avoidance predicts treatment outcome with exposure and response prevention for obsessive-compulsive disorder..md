Abstract

Background: Many individuals with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) display behavioral 
avoidance related to their obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviors. However, how these 
avoidance behaviors impact treatment outcomes with exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) 
remains unclear. We examined pretreatment avoidance behaviors as predictors of EX/RP 
outcomes.

Methods: Data came from a randomized controlled trial of augmentation strategies for 
inadequate response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors comparing EX/RP (N = 40), risperidone (N = 
40), and placebo (N = 20). Baseline avoidance was rated with the avoidance item from the Yale–
Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Primary analyses examined avoidance behaviors 
as predictors of EX/RP outcomes. To test specificity, we explored whether avoidance also related 
to outcomes among patients receiving risperidone and placebo.

Results: More than half (69%) of the full sample had moderate or severe avoidance behaviors at 
baseline. In EX/RP, controlling for baseline severity, pretreatment avoidance predicted 
posttreatment YBOCS symptoms (β = 0.45, P < .01). Avoidant individuals were less likely to 
achieve remission with EX/RP (odds ratio = 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] range 0.01–0.28, P 
= .001). Baseline avoidance was also associated with degree of patient adherence to between-
session EX/RP assignments, which mediated the relationship between baseline avoidance and 
EX/RP outcomes (P < .05). Baseline avoidance did not predict outcomes or wellness among 
patients receiving risperidone or placebo.

Conclusions: These results suggest that avoidance behaviors are an important clinical factor in 
EX/RP outcomes and indicate that assessing avoidance may provide an efficient method for 
predicting EX/RP outcomes. Avoidance may be particularly relevant in EX/RP as compared to 
medication treatment, though future replication of these initial results is required.

INTRODUCTION

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) affects about 2% of the population and can be 
disabling when severe (Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010). Cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) consisting of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) is a recommended treatment 
for adults with OCD (Koran & Simpson, 2013; Koran et al., 2007; NICE, 2013). Yet, not all 
patients are fully helped by EX/RP. For example, clinical trials show that although 75–80% 
of randomized patients respond, only up to 40% achieve minimal symptoms (Foa et al., 
2005; Simpson et al., 2008, 2013). Many studies have examined predictors of EX/RP 
treatment response with the aim of maximizing outcomes. However, the literature on EX/RP 
predictors is replete with mixed results and small effect sizes (Keeley, Storch, Merlo, & 
Geffken, 2008; Olatunji, Davis, Powers, & Smits, 2013), with one notable exception: patient 
adherence to EX/RP treatment procedures robustly predicts EX/RP outcomes (Abramowitz, 
Franklin, Zoellner, & Dibernardo, 2002; Simpson et al., 2011; Tolin, Maltby, Diefenbach, 
Hannan, & Worhunsky, 2004; Wheaton et al., 2016). This paper investigated another 
potential EX/RP predictor that has been understudied in the extant literature: pretreatment 
avoidance behaviors.

Avoidance behaviors are often a prominent feature in OCD, as patients attempt to avoid 
situations and stimuli that provoke obsessions, distress, and time-consuming rituals 
(McGuire et al., 2012). For example, an individual with contamination fears might actively 
plan his day to avoid having to use public restrooms to prevent feeling contaminated and 
having to complete onerous washing rituals. This type of avoidance has been conceptualized 
as a form of compulsive ritual, in that avoidance behaviors also reduce distress and are 
performed in order to prevent feared consequences (Storch et al., 2010). Avoidance 
behaviors appear to be common in OCD with estimates suggesting that up to 59.7% of 
patients engaging in OCD-related avoidance (Starcevic et al., 2011). Avoidance may also 
complicate treatment with EX/RP, which requires patients to eliminate avoidance patterns 
and instead confront their fears and distress (i.e., conduct exposures). In particular, patients 
with more extensive avoidance patterns might struggle to comply with between-session 
EX/RP homework, which requires the patient to confront feared situations and restrict rituals 
without the therapist present.

Although there have been many studies investigating predictors of EX/RP outcomes (for 
review see Knopp, Knowles, Bee, Lovell, & Bower, 2013), how pretreatment avoidance 
might impact EX/RP outcomes has received very little attention. In an early trial, Cottraux,

Messy, Marks, Mollard, and Bouvard (1993) administered a behavioral avoidance test (BAT) 
at the baseline assessment of a trial that compared behavior therapy, fluvoxamine, and pill 
placebo (total N = 60). Across the complete sample, performance on the BAT significantly 
predicted treatment response, with highly avoidant patients less likely to respond. 
Subsequent studies have suggested that avoidance in BATs improves following EX/RP 
(Cottraux et al., 2001; Steketee, Chambless, Tran, Worden, & Gillis, 1996). Further, in a 
reanalysis of Cottraux et al. (2001), Olatunji et al. (2013) reported that decreased BAT 
avoidance was mediated by reductions in OCD symptoms through treatment. However, these 
subsequent reports did not specifically investigate whether pretreatment avoidance predicts 
therapy outcome.

One potential reason that avoidance has been understudied in OCD treatment trials is that it 
is difficult to quantify and reliably measure, and there is no consensus method for assessing 
OCD avoidance. BAT tests have been criticized for being difficult to translate into clinical 
practice and have not been widely used in clinical trials, which often employ clinical rating 
scales because of their brevity and reliability (McGuire et al., 2012). Moreover, the “gold 
standard” OCD symptom measure, the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS; 
Goodman et al., 1989a, 1989b), does not include direct consideration of avoidance in the 
calculation of its total score of OCD severity, causing some to propose revising the scale 
(Storch et al., 2010).

However, the original YBOCS does include an assessment of avoidance behavior among its 
auxiliary items (which are often overlooked in research; Reid, Storch, & Murphy, 2011). For 
this avoidance assessment, raters ask patients to rate the extent to which they have been 
avoiding places, situations, or people because of obsessional thoughts or the need to perform 
compulsions. Although frequently overlooked in research, this YBOCS avoidance item has 
demonstrated good test–retest reliability and converges with avoidance behavior during BAT 
performance (Woody, Steketee, & Chambless, 1995). To our knowledge, only one study (De 
Araujo, Ito, & Marks, 1996) investigated this item as a potential EX/RP predictor. However, 
it was included among a set of 20 predictors. These were reduced via principal components 
analysis, with the avoidance item grouped with other YBOCS items, and this combined 
factor did not predict therapy outcomes.

To address this gap in the literature, the present study investigated the ability of pretreatment 
avoidance (as assessed by the YBOCS auxiliary item) to predict EX/RP outcomes. We 
capitalized on existing data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of augmentation 
strategies for inadequate response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) that compared 
EX/RP, risperidone, and pill placebo. Patients were evaluated with the YBOCS and its 
auxiliary avoidance item by independent evaluators. Based on the above review, we 
hypothesized that pretreatment avoidance would predict EX/RP outcomes (posttreatment 
symptoms). We also hypothesized that pretreatment avoidance would predict wellness, a 
clinically important end state in which patients achieve minimal OCD symptoms and 
improved quality of life and functioning. As in previous studies, wellness was defined by 
attainment of posttreatment YBOCS ≤ 12 (Farris, McLean, Van Meter, Simpson, & Foa, 
2013). To test the specificity of avoidance effects, we also explored whether the avoidance 
item related to outcomes among patients randomized to risperidone and pill placebo.

Finally, we explored how avoidance might impact EX/RP outcomes. As mentioned above, 
substantial previous research suggests that the degree to which patients adhere to treatment 
procedures (and specifically to between-session assignments to conduct exposures and 
refrain from rituals, hereafter referred to as patient adherence), predicts EX/RP outcomes 
(Abramowitz et al., 2002; Simpson et al., 2011; Tolin et al., 2004). Thus, we hypothesized 
that individuals with behavioral avoidance tendencies also avoid therapy homework and 
thereby benefit less. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether patient adherence 
mediates the relationship between pretreatment avoidance and EX/RP outcomes.

2 ∣  METHOD

2.1 ∣  Overview

The study was conducted at two academic outpatient clinics specializing in OCD treatment: 
The Center for OCD and Related Disorders at the New York State Psychiatric Institute/
Columbia Psychiatry in New York City and the Center for the Treatment and Study of 
Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Institutional Review Boards at 
both sites approved the study protocol, and patients provided written informed consent. For 
full description of study procedures, see Simpson et al. (2013).

2.2 ∣  Participants

Participants were adults with OCD who participated in an RCT of augmentation strategies 
for individuals who remained at least moderately symptomatic (YBOCS ≥ 16) while taking 
a stable dose (12 ≥ weeks) of an SRI. To be eligible participants had a primary diagnosis of 
OCD as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First, Spitzer, 
Gibbon, & Williams, 2001) and remained symptomatic despite receiving an SRI at a 
maximally tolerated dose for at least 12 weeks. Exclusion criteria included: (1) diagnosis of 
bipolar or psychotic disorder; (2) substance abuse or dependence in the past 3 months; (3) 
clinically significant suicidal ideation; (4) severe depression (≥25 on the 17-item Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale [HDRS; Hamilton, 1960]); (5) primary hoarding symptoms; or (6) 
previous trial of SRI augmentation with either risperidone or EX/RP (≥ 8 sessions over 2 
months).

2.3 ∣  Study procedures

Full study details are provided elsewhere (Simpson et al., 2013). In brief, eligible 
participants were randomized to one of three treatments: (1) 17 sessions of EX/RP (N = 40), 
pharmacotherapy with risperidone (N = 40), and pill placebo (N = 20). EX/RP was delivered 
according to a manualized protocol (Kozak & Foa, 1997) and included two introductory 
treatment planning sessions followed by 15 exposures; all sessions were 90 min long. 
Treatment also included between-session homework assignments (self-directed exposures 
and response prevention) and phone call check-ins. Therapists were doctoral-level clinicians 
(PhD or PsyD) who received weekly group supervision in order to standardize treatment 
delivery across sites.

Risperidone and pill placebo were dispensed by study psychiatrists in identical capsules with 
the same dosing schedule (first week: 0.25 mg/d for 3 days and then 0.5 mg/d; subsequent

weeks: increases of 0.5 mg per week to a maximum of 4.0 mg/d). Psychiatrist visits 
occurred weekly for the first 4 weeks and then biweekly. Initial psychiatrist visits lasted 60 
min and subsequent visits were 30 min.

Assessments were made by independent evaluators (blinded to treatment condition) who 
assessed patients’ OCD symptoms at baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 4), and 
posttreatment (week 8).

2.4 ∣  Measures

2.4.1 ∣  Yale–Brown obsessive–compulsive scale (YBOCS; Goodman et al., 
1989a, 1989b)—The YBOCS is a semi-structured clinician-administered assessment of 
OCD severity. The YBOCS includes 10 items quantifying the severity of obsessions and 
compulsions in the past week, each of which is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no 
symptoms, 4 = extreme). Total scores range from 0 to 40. The YBOCS has good internal 
consistency (acceptable in the present study, alpha = 0.73), excellent inter-rater reliability, 
and good test–retest reliability (Goodman et al., 1989a, 1989b). The YBOCS also includes 
auxiliary items that are not included in the total score, including ratings of avoidance, 
insight, and respondent reliability. For the avoidance item, the clinician rates the extent of 
the patient's OCD-related avoidance behaviors on a 4-point ordinal scale (constituting no 
avoidance, mild avoidance, moderate avoidance, and extreme avoidance). In the present 
study, these ordinal categories were grouped to compare those with mild or no avoidance to 
those with moderate or extreme avoidance prior to beginning EX/RP.1

2.4.2 ∣  Patient EX/RP adherence scale (PEAS; Simpson et al., 2010)—The 
PEAS is a clinician-administered measure used to quantify the degree to which patients 
adhere to EX/RP procedures between therapy sessions. The PEAS is completed by the 
therapist at every session that was preceded by assigned exposure practices (i.e., sessions 4–
17 in the present study). It consists of three items: (a) the quantity of exposures (percentage 
of assigned homework exposures that were attempted), (b) quality of attempted exposures, 
and (c) degree of success with response prevention. The therapist rates each item on a 7-
point Likert-type scale. Mean PEAS total scores were calculated by averaging the scores for 
each session and then across sessions. In the present sample, mean PEAS ratings had good 
internal consistency (alpha = 0.89).

2.5 ∣  Statistical methods

To test whether pretreatment avoidance predicts EX/RP outcomes, we used the YBOCS 
avoidance item to divide the sample into participants with and without a significant 
avoidance problem at baseline. This avoidance rating variable was then used as the 
independent variable in two regression models (each of which was computed in both the 
completer samples and followed up with sensitivity analysis in the intent-to-treat [ITT] 
sample using Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] to account for missing data due to 

1YBOCS avoidance was examined as a dichotomous variable to ease interpretation of the comparison between patients with and 
without significant avoidance in the mediational analysis (which would have required comparison of the significance of the difference 
at the threshold for each ordinal category). The same pattern of results was obtained with the untransformed YBOCS avoidance 
variable, which significantly predicted outcomes and wellness in EX/RP but not risperidone or placebo.

drop out). The first model used linear regression to predict posttreatment YBOCS scores. 
The second used logistic regression to predict posttreatment wellness (a state characterized 
by remission of OCD symptoms as indicated by YBOCS ≤ 12). Both models controlled for 
baseline YBOCS severity because the YBOCS avoidance item is positively associated with 
overall severity (Reid et al., 2011). To test the specificity of the avoidance–outcome 
relationship to EX/RP we reran these analyses in the risperidone and placebo groups 
separately.

We also explored the associations between pretreatment avoidance and patient adherence to 
between sessions EX/RP assignments (PEAS scores), including a mediational model in 
which avoidance scores relate to posttreatment symptoms through patient adherence. SPSS 
was used for all analyses. We employed the SPSS macro provided by Preacher and Hayes 
(2008) to test mediation as in other studies (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011). 
Overall significance was set at alpha < 0.05.

3 ∣  RESULTS

3.1 ∣  Sample description and EX/RP outcomes

The full sample (N = 100) was 48% female and 90% of participants were non-Hispanic 
White. Participant age ranged from 18 to 67 (M = 33.9; SD = 11.4). In the full sample, 69% 
of participants had moderate or severe avoidance behaviors at baseline (i.e., significant 
avoidance). The remaining 31% of the sample had mild or no avoidance at baseline. 
Proportion with significant avoidance did not differ by treatment group (EX/RP, RIS, 
Placebo), χ2 (2) = 3.18, P = .15. Pretreatment avoidance was positively and significantly 
associated with baseline YBOCS severity (rs = 0.22, P = .03).

Of the 40 patients assigned to EX/RP, 37 completed treatment. In EX/RP mean scores on the 
YBOCS decreased significantly from baseline (M = 27.03, SD = 3.98) to posttreatment (M = 
13.0, SD = 6.09, t(36) = 12.0, P < .001). Avoidance was moderately and significantly 
negatively correlated with PEAS scores (rs = −0.49, P = .002), indicating that those with 
significance avoidance adhered less to EX/RP procedures in treatment.

3.2 ∣  Baseline avoidance predicts EX/RP outcomes

The first regression predicted posttreatment YBOCS symptoms among EX/RP patients. 
Controlling for baseline YBOCS in Step 1 of the regression did not significantly account for 
variance in posttreatment YBOCS scores (R2 = 0.002, P = .772). In Step 2, pretreatment 
avoidance explained 18% of the variance in posttreatment YBOCS scores, beyond baseline 
YBOCS (Δ R2 = 0.18, P = .01). As shown in Table 1, avoidant patients had higher 
posttreatment YBOCS in EX/RP (β = 0.43, P = .01). Sensitivity analyses in the LOCF 
sample show the same pattern of results (Table 1). To test the specificity of these effects to 
EX/RP, the same analyses were conducted in the groups assigned to risperidone and pill 
placebo. As shown in Table 1, baseline avoidance did not significantly predict outcomes in 
either of these two conditions.

The second set of analyses used multiple predictor logistic regression to predict 
posttreatment wellness (i.e., YBOCS ≤ 12) with EX/RP, entering baseline YBOCS severity

and pretreatment avoidance as predictors. A test of the full model against a constant only 
model was significant, indicating that the set of predictors reliably distinguished individuals 
who achieved wellness from those who did not (χ2 (df = 2) = 13.83, P = .001). Overall 
prediction accuracy was 78.4% (70.6% for wellness, 85% for failure to achieve wellness). 
As Table 2 illustrates, the Wald criterion demonstrated that pretreatment avoidance 
significantly contributed to the prediction whereas baseline YBOCS severity did not. The 
odds ratio for avoidance indicates that individuals with more severe avoidance at baseline 
were significantly less likely to achieve wellness with EX/RP. Sensitivity analyses in the 
EX/RP LOCF sample show the same pattern of results (Table 2). Specificity analyses were 
conducted in the risperidone group.2 As shown in the table, baseline avoidance did not 
significantly predict wellness with risperidone in either the ITT or completer samples.

3.3 ∣  Mediational analysis with patient adherence

Figure 1 presents a model in which patient adherence mediates the association between 
pretreatment avoidance and posttreatment OCD symptoms with EX/RP. As shown, the 
significant direct association between avoidance and posttreatment YBOCS (c path) was 
reduced in magnitude and nonsignificant once the mediator was accounted for (c′ path). In 
line with current recommendations (Preacher & Hayes, 2004, 2008) we tested for mediation 
by bootstrapping the indirect effect (taking the mean of 5,000 bootstrapped resamples from 
the data). The point estimate for the indirect effect was 2.52 (SE = 1.11). The bias-corrected 
bootstrapped 95% confidence interval did not contain zero (95% CI = 0.88–5.72), indicating 
the mediation effect was significant, P < .05. To estimate the effect size of the mediation 
effect we calculated the proportion of the total effect that was mediated (1 – (c/c′)). This 
showed that 48.89% of the relationship between pretreatment avoidance and EX/RP 
treatment outcome was mediated by patient adherence.

4 ∣  DISCUSSION

This study examined the relationship between pretreatment avoidance and treatment 
outcome via secondary data analysis of an RCT comparing augmentation strategies for SRIs 
(EX/RP, risperidone, and placebo). Consistent with our hypotheses, among those receiving 
EX/RP, behavioral avoidance predicted severity of OCD symptoms at posttreatment and 
attainment of posttreatment wellness, even after controlling for baseline OCD severity. We 
also found that reduced patient adherence to EX/RP tasks mediated the relationship between 
avoidance and poor EX/RP outcomes. These results appeared to be specific to EX/RP, as 
avoidance did not predict outcomes in the risperidone or placebo groups. Although these 
initial results require confirmation in independent samples, it might be that behavioral 
avoidance has a greater effect on behavioral therapy (i.e., EX/RP) as compared to 
medications.

These results have several clinical implications. First, they suggest that assessing 
pretreatment avoidance might help treating clinicians to identify patients at risk for 
suboptimal EX/RP outcomes. These patients may benefit from additional clinical support 

2The placebo group was not included in the logistic regression analyses because only one of 20 placebo patients achieved wellness.

and encouragement to complete outside of session EX/RP tasks. Second, our results also 
may have implications for refining how OCD is measured with the YBOCS. As was 
previously reported on in this sample (Wheaton, Rosenfield, Foa, & Simpson, 2015), 
baseline severity as measured by the YBOCS total score did not predict EX/RP outcomes, 
which is consistent with some previous studies (Foa et al., 1983; Maher et al., 2010; Rufer, 
Fricke, Moritz, Kloss, & Hand, 2006). The present results suggest that accounting for the 
avoidance facet of baseline severity might improve the predictive power of the YBOCS. For 
example, some authors have proposed including the avoidance item in the YBOCS total 
scores (Woody et al., 1995), and others have offered a revision to the YBOCS that more 
fully incorporated rating avoidance (Storch et al., 2010). Our results suggest that these 
alternative measures may help clarify the relationship between baseline OCD severity and 
EX/RP outcomes, which has mixed results (Olatunji et al., 2013).

Although the present report focused on EX/RP for OCD, these results may also have 
implications for other forms of pathological anxiety, including phobias, social anxiety 
disorder, panic disorder, and PTSD (APA, 2013), which also respond to exposure-based 
CBT treatments that aim to decrease avoidance behaviors. Thus, avoidance can be 
conceptualized as an important transdiagnostic factor, in line with the NIMH's research 
domain criteria (RDoC) initiative to move beyond diagnostic boundaries (Cuthbert & Insel, 
2013). Moreover, severity of pretreatment behavioral avoidance might predict CBT 
outcomes for a range of conditions. At the same time, cognitive neuroscience work has 
begun to explore different facets of avoidance behaviors. For example, LeDoux et al. (2017) 
differentiate between adaptive active avoidance (typically a form of active coping) and 
maladaptive passive avoidance (often a habitual response that is automatically emitted). 
Some research suggests that active avoidance behaviors that yield control over threat may 
attenuate Pavlovian conditioned responses (Boeke, Moscarello, LeDoux, Phelps, & Hartley, 
2017). These results suggest heterogeneity among avoidance behaviors, highlighting the 
need for further study of avoidance in relation to exposure-based psychotherapy.

Our results should be interpreted within the context of study limitations. First, our study was 
a secondary data analysis of a prior study and as such our analyses were not preplanned and 
limiting us to the measures included in that trial. Thus our assessment of behavioral 
avoidance was restricted to the avoidance item on the YBOCS, which does not allow us to 
parse different aspects of avoidance (Storch et al., 2010) and which also was used as the 
outcome measure (though avoidance is not included in the YBOCS severity score). Future 
studies should use prospective designs and more thorough and rigorous assessments of 
avoidance. These could include both BATs as well as cognitive neuroscience paradigms 
designed to assess the neural correlates of avoidance (Boeke et al., 2017). In addition, the 
sample sizes in each treatment condition were relatively small (which may have limited 
power). The sample also consisted exclusively of individuals also taking SRI medications 
throughout the trial who were mostly non-Hispanic White. Thus, future research with larger 
sample sizes (optimally including nonmedicated and more diverse samples) is warranted to 
confirm these initial results.

5 ∣  CONCLUSIONS

This secondary data analysis provides preliminary evidence that pretreatment avoidance 
behaviors predict subsequent EX/RP outcomes in adults with OCD. Avoidant patients 
experienced poorer EX/RP outcomes, accounting for baseline symptom severity. These 
results appeared to be specific to EX/RP as compared to risperidone and placebo. The 
present results add to a growing body of recent work focused on the importance of 
avoidance behaviors in anxiety-related conditions (Beckers & Craske 2017; LeDoux, 
Moscarello, Sears, & Campese, 2017). Future research is needed to replicate these findings 
and might also seek to explore heterogeneity in different forms of avoidance and how 
specific facets of behavioral avoidance might represent transdiagnostic factors relevant to the 
effectiveness of exposure-based psychotherapies. This research could potentially improve 
future treatments, as additional interventions might help avoidant patients improve their 
adherence to treatment procedures and thereby maximize therapeutic outcomes.
