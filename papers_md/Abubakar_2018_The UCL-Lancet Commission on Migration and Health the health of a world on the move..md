The UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health has been an international collaboration spanning multiple continents. The 
Commission was chaired and led by IA, with support from the steering group (RWA, RB, DD, MO, and CZ). The Commission was 
coordinated by MO, with research assistance from RI for the first year and RB for the last year of the Commission work. The work 
for the Commission was undertaken in six subgroups and all commissioners met in person on three occasions: in London, UK (2016), 
London, UK (2017), and Bellagio, Italy (2017). The first draft of the manuscript was written by RWA and DD, the second draft was 
compiled by IA, DD, MO, and CZ. TM and LR provided sections on law; MK, NG, and BK provided sections on culture, society, 
and racism; AM and CZ provided sections on labour migration and trafficking; KS, DM, and PD provided sections on health systems; 
ST and RWA provided sections on data; PSa provided sections on the environment; MK provided sections on human rights; and NG 
provided sections on disabilities. All authors read and critiqued the manuscript and approved the final version of the report.

Declaration of interests 
IA, DD, and RWA undertook paid consultancy work in support of the Doctors of the World 2017 Observatory report—Falling through 
the cracks: the failure of universal healthcare coverage in Europe. MO reports personal fees from WHO Regional Office for Europe,

Executive summary

With one billion people on the move or having moved in 2018, migration is a global reality, which 
has also become a political lightning rod. Although estimates indicate that the majority of global 
migration occurs within low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the most prominent 
dialogue focuses almost exclusively on migration from LMICs to high-income countries (HICs).

Nowadays, populist discourse demonises the very same individuals who uphold economies, 
bolster social services, and contribute to health services in both origin and destination locations. 
Those in positions of political and economic power continue to restrict or publicly condemn 
migration to promote their own interests. Meanwhile nationalist movements assert so-called 
cultural sovereignty by delineating an us versus them rhetoric, creating a moral emergency.

In response to these issues, the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health was convened 
to articulate evidence-based approaches to inform public discourse and policy. The Commission 
undertook analyses and consulted widely, with diverse international evidence and expertise 
spanning sociology, politics, public health science, law, humanitarianism, and anthropology. The 
result of this work is a report that aims to be a call to action for civil society, health leaders, 
academics, and policy makers to maximise the benefits and reduce the costs of migration on 
health locally and globally. The outputs of our work relate to five overarching goals that we thread 
throughout the report.

First, we provide the latest evidence on migration and health outcomes. This evidence challenges 
common myths and highlights the diversity, dynamics, and benefits of modern migration and how 
it relates to population and individual health. Migrants generally contribute more to the wealth 
of host societies than they cost. Our Article shows that international migrants in HICs have, on 
average, lower mortality than the host country population. However, increased morbidity was 
found for some conditions and among certain subgroups of migrants, (eg, increased rates of mental 
illness in victims of trafficking and people fleeing conflict) and in populations left behind in 
the location of origin. Currently, in 2018, the full range of migrants’ health needs are difficult 
to assess because of poor quality data. We know very little, for example, about the health of 
undocumented migrants, people with disabilities, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, or intersex 
(LGBTI) individuals who migrate or who are unable to move.

Second, we examine multisector determinants of health and consider the implication of the current 
sector-siloed approaches. The health of people who migrate depends greatly on structural and 
political factors that determine the impetus for migration, the conditions of their journey, and their 
destination. Discrimination, gender inequalities, and exclusion from health and social services 
repeatedly emerge as negative health influences for migrants that require cross-sector responses.

Third, we critically review key challenges to healthy migration. Population mobility provides 
economic, social, and cultural dividends for those who migrate and their host communities. 
Furthermore, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, regardless of location 
or migration status, is enshrined in numerous human rights instruments. However, national 
sovereignty concerns overshadow these benefits and legal norms. Attention to migration focuses 
largely on security concerns. When there is conjoining of the words health and migration, it 
is either focused on small subsets of society and policy, or negatively construed. International 
agreements, such as the UN Global Compact for Migration and the UN Global Compact on 
Refugees, represent an opportunity to ensure that international solidarity, unity of intent, and our 
shared humanity triumphs over nationalist and exclusionary policies, leading to concrete actions to 
protect the health of migrants.

Fourth, we examine equity in access to health and health services and offer evidence-based 
solutions to improve the health of migrants. Migrants should be explicitly included in universal 
health coverage commitments. Ultimately, the cost of failing to be health-inclusive could be more

expensive to national economies, health security, and global health than the modest investments 
required.

Finally, we look ahead to outline how our evidence can contribute to synergistic and equitable 
health, social, and economic policies, and feasible strategies to inform and inspire action by 
migrants, policy makers, and civil society. We conclude that migration should be treated as a 
central feature of 21st century health and development. Commitments to the health of migrating 
populations should be considered across all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in the 
implementation of the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact on Refugees. This 
Commission offers recommendations that view population mobility as an asset to global health by 
showing the meaning and reality of good health for all. We present four key messages that provide 
a focus for future action.

Introduction

Nearly one-seventh of the world’s population is now living in a location different from the 
one in which they were born.1 A migrant is someone who has moved across an international 
border or within her or his own country away from their habitual place of residence. 
Migration is not a new phenomenon. People have migrated throughout human history and 
population mobility continues to benefit many individuals and communities, contributing to 
social and economic advancement globally.

Despite the long history of human migration, international dialogue has recently become 
more prominent, although only rarely has attention been paid to migration as a core 
determinant of health. When individuals migrate, they enter new environments that have 
different health risks.2 Studies indicate that morbidity patterns among migrants are diverse 
and dynamic because of numerous interacting influences, such as an individual’s pre-
departure health, socioeconomic and environmental conditions, local disease patterns and 
risk behaviours, cultural norms and practices, and access to preventive or curative therapies 
throughout the migration process.3

Health outcomes in migrants are heterogeneous, but evidence consistently shows the 
disproportionate health, social, and economic burdens of forced migration.4 Despite 
widespread recognition of the numerous migration related health risks, mobile populations
—even forced migrants who are fleeing for their lives—are often met with punitive border 
policies, arbitrary detention, abuse and extortion, and are commonly denied access to care. 
Governments that introduce immigration policies legalising exclusion and rights abuse 
frequently cite national security concerns to justify migration controls that extend beyond 
their own borders. These policies can go as far as criminalising migrant status, and deterring 
asylum seekers by detaining them; even separating children from their parents, as seen in 
US Government immigration policies in 2018.5 All too often, government policies prioritise 
the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter 
them.

Our current global political economy is driven by high-income industrial powers that draw 
on natural and human resources in LMICs. Moreover, laws and regulations that encourage

unrestricted trade in goods, services, and capital are simultaneously being used to control 
labour mobility to further the political and economic interests of the wealthy, while often 
leaving poor communities behind. Global trade and pro-business policies in lower-income 
countries have drained natural resources, contributed to environmental degradation, and 
pushed people into hazardous, exploitative work to meet consumer demands for cheap goods 
such as so-called fast fashion.6

International conventions are in place to guide policy to support safer and more inclusive 
migration and can be used to counter some of these negative forces. As for all human 
beings, migrants are equally entitled to universal human rights without discrimination. All 
migrants thus have the right to the "highest attainable standard of health" according to 
international law.7 All migrants are entitled to equal access to preventive, curative, and 
palliative health care.8 They also have rights to the underlying social, political, economic, 
and cultural determinants of physical and mental health, such as clean water and air and 
non-discriminatory treatment.8 Human rights treaties entitle migrants to due process of law 
in border practices and freedom from arbitrary detention and restrictions on movement. 
These rights do not merely impose legal obligations on governments but are essential 
preconditions for social and economic integration, prosperity, social cohesion in any society, 
and wellbeing in the modern world.9 The substantial gap between the international legal 
requirements guaranteeing the human rights of migrants and the implementation of these 
laws by states provides important context for this Commission report.

In 2016, at the UN General Assembly, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular 
Migration, and a further Compact to respond to acute and chronic refugee situations were 
initiated in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development target 10.7 (to facilitate 
safe, orderly, and responsible migration).10,11 Yet, these essential multilateral processes 
appear to be heading in a precarious direction, as exemplified by the US Government’s 
withdrawal from the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in 2017,12 the 
creation of potential internment camps termed migrant centres,13 and the reluctance of some 
EU countries to accept an equitable redistribution of migrants.

Our Commission’s journey

Worldwide mobility is our future—regardless of laws and walls. Our Commission 
was developed in light of the opportunity to realise the SDG commitments "to leave 
no one behind" and "to reach first those who are furthest behind",14 in the context 
of states’ guarantees to protect the human rights of migrants. We brought together 
20 Commissioners with equal gender representation and wide geographical spread to 
generate transdisciplinary evidence, contemporary thought, and global expertise that draws 
on multiple scientific perspectives. To achieve this aim, Commissioners were drawn 
from a range of scientific backgrounds including sociology, policy, public health, law, 
humanitarianism, and anthropology.

We initially structured our work with working groups around key themes including health 
systems, labour migration, forced migration, vulnerabilities, law, human rights and politics, 
sociocultural factors and identity, and data and health outcomes. We undertook a series of 
rapid systematic reviews to identify key literature in each area and build on these, as well

as two formal systematic reviews and meta-analyses that informed the Commission and are 
published in detail alongside the report.15,16 Our work was done over a 2-year period with 
two London based authors’ meetings and a week-long in-person review of the first draft 
of the Commission at the Rockefeller Foundation, Italy, in November, 2017, along with 
extensive collaborative work online and by phone.

The principles that underpin our report are equity and inclusion of migrants in access to 
health and health enhancing resources and opportunities. The Commission settled on five 
goals for in-depth examination, which provide a focus throughout the four sections of the 
final report. First, we review evidence on migration and health, challenge common myths, 
describe the composition and characteristics of population mobility, and assess uses and 
limitations of migrant categories. Second, we examine multisector determinants of health 
and consider the implication of current sector-siloed approaches, such as the dichotomous 
goals of the health sector versus the security sectors. Third, we critically review key 
challenges to healthy migration by analysing health and migration in relation to culture 
and identity, rights, legal issues, and environmental hazards and climate change. Fourth, we 
examine equity in access to health and health services and offer evidence-based solutions 
to improve the health of migrants. Fifth, we look ahead to consider how our evidence can 
contribute to synergistic, ethical policies and feasible strategies to inform and inspire action 
by governments, international agencies, and health professionals to promote health in global 
mobility.

To tackle this complex subject, we developed a Migration and Health Determinants 
framework to consider the interactions between migration and the individual, population, 
and global health (see appendix, supplementary figure 1). The framework highlights key 
factors influencing the health of mobile populations, including legal, social, and health 
structures and systems; service access and support; exposures and behaviours particular to 
migrants; and the epidemiological changes (positive and negative) related to population 
mobility. These health influences are generally relevant for each stage of a migration 
process. Our Commission thus offers evidence on how various factors might benefit or be 
detrimental to individual and population health throughout a journey—including at origin, 
transit, destination, and return.

Migration and health is a diverse topic with an extensive existing literature. Although 
we began with a broad and ambitious remit, it is not possible to cover all aspects of 
migration and health, nor give an overview of all groups of migrants and the conditions 
they experience. There are many other facets of migration and health that were beyond 
the specific remit or bounds of the five main goals of this Commission, but we plan to 
do more in the post-Commission phase in collaboration with others across sectors who are 
working in this space. Recognising the Lancet Series on Health in Humanitarian Crises, 
and the Syria Lancet Commission, we have not presented substantive amounts of reference 
to policy documents, examples of best practice, or deeper analysis in the field of refugee 
studies. We feel these areas, and wider collaboration on forced migration, will be key for 
the post-Commission phase in achieving further research, policy, and operational impact. 
In addition, although we cite on the ground case studies, we were unable to systematically

Section 1  The case for action: what do we know about migration and 

health

Migration is a dynamic process

Migration seldom involves a single long journey from one place to settle in another. 
The diversity and complexity of migration patterns include people travelling long and 
short distances, within and across borders, for temporary or permanent residency, and 
often undertaking the journey multiple times. A clear delineation or rigid categorisation 
of different types of migration is rarely possible. The categorisation process attempts to 
classify a large, heterogeneous population according to limited criteria, which are not 
generally suited to capture the complex social dynamics of human mobility or necessarily 
the perspectives or needs of the people who are moving. Terms such as voluntary or forced 
migration, and categories such as refugees, asylum seekers, and international and internal 
migrants can partly help to understand migration dynamics. These same terms can also be 
used to "other" and discriminate against migrants, as well as generally being administrative 
definitions used to classify migrants for protection, assistance, or research—rather than 
a true representation of individual circumstances. Legal categories are instrumental for 
migration control and management by states and international agencies providing support, 
but might not fully explain an individual’s circumstances. However, for the purposes of the 
evidence presented in this report, we often use existing definitions (see supplementary table 
1 in appendix), which enable us to draw on up-to-date migration literature and data sources. 
At the same time, throughout the report we will highlight the complex drivers of migration 
and the difficulties and potential dangers of assigning singular or narrow definitions. 
Migrant categories are not necessarily objective or neutral; distinctions frequently reflect 
the assumptions, values, goals, and interests of the parties who assign these labels.

It is also difficult to categorise people in relation to their reasons for migrating. A myriad of 
negative drivers and positive aspirations (push or pull factors) exist that motivate people 
to migrate. Individuals, families, and groups often have mixed motives for migrating, 
and their reasons can change over the course of a single journey. For instance, people 
seeking safety from conflict can be classified as refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented 
migrants, or internally displaced persons. However, before and during transit, especially in 
protracted conflicts where aid resources are insufficient, migration decisions can also relate 
to livelihoods and employment. Distress migration or migration due to entrenched poverty, 
food insecurity, and household economic shock (eg, illness, debt), is common worldwide. 
Distress migration is linked to local unemployment, household financial crises, poor crop 
production, and in some instances, forced evictions. Evictions can be linked to rising real 
estate prices, large development projects, and land confiscation.

Regardless of migration motives, economic contributions, or people’s rights, populist 
rhetoric has morphed all people who move as migrants, condemning them, irrespective of 
whether they are refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, or low wage workers.

The catch-all term of migrant obscures the net social, political, and economic benefits of 
migration for destination communities and obscures a migrant’s contribution to their place 
of origin, supporting families and supplementing development aid, which, in turn results in 
greater global health.

Health throughout the migration process

Migration trajectories involve various phases (figure 1) including, pre-departure 
circumstances at places of origin; short-term or long-term transit, which might involve 
interception by authorities, non-governmental groups, or criminal gangs; destination 
situations of long-term or short-term stay; and return to places of origin for resettlement 
or for temporary visits before remigration.3 In each phase of a person’s journey, potential 
health risks and possible health protective factors exist that can have a short-term or long-
term effect on their wellbeing. As previously noted, the journeys are often diverse and 
rarely singular. It is common for labour migrants to undertake circular migration, transiting 
back and forth between their place of origin and destination, or remigrating to a new 
destination. When people are transiting between locations, their health and safety depends 
on the forms of transport (air travel, on foot across deserts, hidden in trucks) and the 
pathogenic or environmental exposures (malaria, tuberculosis, violence, heat exhaustion, 
dehydration) along the transit routes.17 Return migration also poses health risks and benefits. 
For instance, communities of origin could benefit from new skills or improved health 
behaviours gained by returning migrants,18 but conversely, individuals who are injured 
or disabled during their journey might return to locations with few services or support 
mechanisms. Importantly, policies to protect migrant and public health will be most effective 
if they take advantage of opportunities to address people’s health needs at the multiple 
phases of the migratory process.3 Maintaining the mental health and wellbeing of migrants 
and the families they might leave behind is particularly important. Even in the best possible 
conditions, migration is stressful and most people move in ways that are far from ideal; the 
stress of migration, travel conditions, and the causes that prompted migration in the first 
place, can all adversely affect mental health.

Migration, gender, and health

Both population mobility and the health implications of migration are highly gendered. 
That is, women, men, and sexual minorities are likely to encounter different health risks 
and protection opportunities at each phase of a migration journey—a journey they might 
have undertaken to flee gender-based violence. The risks begin before departure, when 
women and children could be at risk of violence and discrimination. Among those who 
are forcibly displaced, there is a particular risk of sexual violence, coercion, and sexual 
exploitation at all stages of their migration journey, such as accounts of the widespread rape 
of Rohingya women and girls forcibly displaced from Myanmar in 2016–17,19 or when 
moving along irregular and dangerous routes ending in official and unofficial detention 
centres as seen in the ongoing situation in Libya.20 Even when reaching zones of apparent 
safety, women and children have been exploited by humanitarian workers. This problem 
remains widespread suggesting that women and children might need protection from 
their so-called protectors.21 A systematic review of women and girls in conflict-affected 
settings indicated their extraordinary vulnerability to various forms of human trafficking

and sexual exploitation, frequently occurring as underage or forced marriage and forced 
combatant sexual exploitation.22 Women and children are especially at risk when they 
migrate without the protection of family or social networks. Unaccompanied girls and 
boys who move in ways that are not readily detected by potential support mechanisms 
are particularly vulnerable to neglect, trafficking, abuse, and sexual exploitation. Examples 
include unaccompanied and separated children who resort to sex work to survive and shelter 
in parks and makeshift camps in Greece.23 Child marriages appear to increase among 
displaced populations,24 as parents are often forced to make impossible choices about 
their daughters based on their fear of sexual violence by armed forces or combatants and 
economic hardship.25 Sexual minorities might be among the most neglected and at-risk 
populations in circumstances of migration. The stigma associated with being LGBTI can 
subject individuals to bullying and abuse or force them to remain invisible. There appears to 
be little training for health and humanitarian aid professionals currently to meet the health 
needs of sexual minorities.

Challenging myths

In the current political climate, the term migrant raises a litany of myths and inaccurate 
stereotypes. While often used for political gain, falsehoods about migrants have frequently 
become publicly accepted. Here, we respond to common myths by offering data driven facts.

Are HICs being overwhelmed by migrants?—Discussions about migrants often 
centre around absolute numbers of migrants crossing international borders into HICs. This 
rhetoric tends to ignore findings that there has been little change in the percentage of the 
world’s international migrants, which has only risen from 2·9% to 3·4% from 1990 to 
2017 globally, with diversity in geographical location of migrants (figure 2A). Although 
HICs have seen a greater rise in the percentage of migrants arriving from 7·6% to 13·4% 
(1990 to 2017), it is important to note that the percentage of the total population that were 
individuals who have been displaced and are currently living in HICs is considerably smaller 
than in LMICs. Furthermore, the figures for all international migrants in HICs include, for 
instance, students who pay for their education and often return to their countries of origin,28 
and labour migrants who are net positive contributors to the economy. Previous waves of 
migration as a percentage of the global population (eg, Europeans colonising the Americas 
and Australasia) have been vastly greater in number than these recent trends. Similarly, 
the percentage of the world’s population that were refugees generally declined between 
1990 and 2011. Subsequently, all countries saw an increase, but this was highest in LMICs 
(figure 2B). HICs had very little change in their refugee population, and it was low-income 
countries that had fluctuations from 1·3% to 0·4% (figure 2B). These data show that despite 
popular discourse to the contrary, changes in migration are more complex than the simple 
narrative of a rise in numbers. Overall, mobility patterns are highly regional and context 
specific, with less wealthy nations hosting disproportionate numbers of forcibly displaced 
populations.

Are migrants a burden on services?—Macroeconomic analysis on the effect of 
asylum seekers in Europe concluded that they have a positive effect on host countries’ 
economies.29 Nowadays, rather than burdening systems, migrants in HICs are more likely

to bolster services by providing medical care, teaching children, caring for older people, 
and supporting understaffed services. Migration provides much needed high skilled and low 
skilled workers for economic growth. The way health-care markets are constructed, from 
both the supply and demand sides, is inextricably connected with human mobility. Hospitals, 
residential homes, child-care centres, and domestic and professional cleaning services are 
often staffed by migrants. Migrants constitute a considerable portion of the health-care 
workforce in many HICs and contribute to a substantial so-called brain gain in net-migrant 
receiving countries.30 For example, 37% of doctors in the UK gained their medical 
qualification in another country.31 Health-care workforce migration from poorer to wealthier 
countries has been the subject of extensive study. Health professionals migrate because of 
low remuneration, poor working conditions, work overload, and insufficient opportunities 
for professional advancement in their home countries.32 Higher-income countries reap the 
benefits. It is LMICs, such as Syria and Turkey, who host a higher proportion of displaced 
people, where it is challenging to deliver services for the poorest members of society. 
Although many migrants can access the labour markets, there are also many who might not 
have this same access with immediate and long-term consequences on livelihoods, social 
security, education, and health. Our systematic review and meta-analysis16 of global patterns 
of mortality however, provides evidence that international migrants, particularly those in 
HICs who are more likely to have actively chosen to migrate (such as economic, student, 
and family reunion migrants), are more likely to live longer compared with host populations 
across the majority of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 categories.

Are fertility rates among migrants higher than among host populations?—
Despite populist rhetoric that migrants have many more children than host populations, 
the growth and decline of migrant populations in a country is affected by birth and death 
rates and inward and outward migration from a country. Using large scale longitudinal data 
from six countries (France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK), researchers 
found that migrants have lower first-birth rates than non-migrants with the exception of 
migrant Turkish women.33 Moreover, birth rates among migrants were barely at the level 
of population replacement (a total fertility rate below 2·1 births per woman) and often 
falling. Access to contraception also influences differences in fertility rates. Poor access 
to contraception among migrants is often related to inconsistent policies, guidelines, and 
provision of services. In the EU, migrants appear to have inadequate access to sexual and 
reproductive health care, including family planning services.34

Evidence about fertility and its association with internal migration in LMICs is scarce. With 
Demographic and Health Survey data for the use of modern contraception by an individual’s 
migration category in five LMICs (Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania), we show 
that in each country internal migrants used modern contraception methods more often than 
non-migrants (figure 3). These results could be explained in substantial part by a person’s 
educational and socioeconomic status, supporting evidence that migrants have lower first-
birth rates than non-migrants—and dispelling negative views about fertility among migrants. 
However, these data might not represent patterns among more marginalised groups such as 
undocumented migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, or displaced populations in humanitarian

crisis situations. For these marginalised groups, in whom sexual assault is common, there is 
an even greater need for readily accessible sexual and reproductive health care.40

Are migrants damaging economies?—An overwhelming consensus exists on the 
positive economic benefits of migration, which is insufficiently acknowledged. In settings 
that offer universal access to minimum economic benefits, there has been much debate 
as to whether migrants receive more in social assistance than they contribute in taxes. 
The evidence examining this issue generally suggests that migrants make greater overall 
contributions, except in countries with a high proportion of older migrants.41 In advanced 
economies, each 1% increase of migrants in the adult population increases the gross 
domestic product (GDP) per person by up to 2%.42 Migrants increase income per person and 
living standards through greater contributions to taxes, which are of greater economic worth 
than the social or welfare benefits they receive.41 Furthermore, in the EU and some other 
European countries, free movement has been shown to address imbalances in the labour 
market43 by serving as an equilibrating force through the provision of labour where and 
when needed. These benefits are not just accrued by the wealthiest in society. Moreover, 
the World Bank Group estimated that migrants sent a total sum of US$613 billion to their 
families at origin in 2017.44 Approximately three-quarters of these remittances were sent 
to LMICs—an amount more than three-times larger than official development assistance—
and these remittance flows have been growing steadily since 1990.44 In countries such as 
Liberia, Nepal, and Tajikistan, up to one-third of GDP comes from international remittances. 
Globally, these sums of money are large and can transform the lives of non-migrants.44

Are migrants disease-carriers that pose risks to resident populations?—
Suspicion against migrants as carriers of disease is probably the most pervasive and 
powerful myth related to migration and health throughout history.45 Although historical 
examples exist of the introduction of disease into new settings through human mobility 
(eg, the spread of infection from European colonial settlers), the risk of transmission 
from migrating populations to host populations is generally low. For example, studies on 
tuberculosis suggest that the risk of transmission is elevated within migrant households and 
migrant communities, but not in host populations.46,47 Nonetheless, several HICs screen 
migrants for tuberculosis as part of pre-migration visa application checks.48 Although 
tuberculosis screening systems could benefit individuals through early detection, screening 
is often stigmatising and can spur xenophobic media messages,49 despite the negligible 
risk of transmission in countries with functioning public and universal health systems.46 
Migrant populations might come from countries with a high burden of disease50 and it 
is not uncommon for disease outbreaks to be found in situations of conflict, which can 
disrupt already weak public health systems. Illness and infection can also be acquired or 
spread via transit routes and transport means. For example, air travel can facilitate the 
rapid geographical spread of infections. However, even risk of air travel related outbreaks 
is low–modest if the destination setting has strong surveillance and inclusive public health 
services.51 These services are also crucial to prevent pandemics, whether associated with 
population movement or not.52 Epidemiological patterns and related risks are readily 
addressed by assessing the infectious disease burden among populations and with use of 
data to design targeted interventions to contain outbreaks and prevent new infections through

immunisation. However, because of the prejudice and unfounded fear that can be generated 
by misuse of surveillance data, caution is required when releasing potentially stigmatising 
disease prevalence figures for public consumption. We revisit this issue throughout the 
report and discuss the misuse of data.

Composition of mobile populations

Understanding the health of people on the move requires clarity about who is moving, 
why, and where, and the potential positive and negative effects. Here, we offer an overview 
of international migrants, internal migrants, labour migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, 
internally displaced persons, and climate refugees (an emerging group that is likely to 
increase in number). Data will be presented with use of the most widely applied migration 
categories—despite our previously stated reservations about the weaknesses of these 
categories—reviewing numbers and their associated limitations, geographical distribution, 
age and sex characteristics, and key issues for each group.

International migration—In 2017, there were an estimated 258 million international 
migrants, which accounted for 3·4% of the world’s population.53 Notably, most data for 
international migration between 1960 and 2017 did not classify migrants by subgroup. 
Estimates by the International Labour Organization indicate that labour migrants constituted 
65% of all international migrants in 2013.54 However, 2013 was the only year for 
which global data were available on labour migration (figure 4). In 2017, Asia had the 
largest number of international migrants (80 million), closely followed by Europe (78 
million), and North America (58 million).55 Globally, the largest number of international 
migrants were in the 30–34 age group and 48% were female.55 To date, data come 
primarily from population censuses, population registers, and nationally representative 
surveys, often with use of place of birth to establish international migrant status. For 47 
countries, place of birth is not available so country of citizenship is used instead. This 
can potentially lead to overestimation of international migrant numbers. Conversely, these 
data can also underestimate migrant numbers by inappropriately excluding people born 
abroad with local citizenship. Data collection for international migration would benefit from 
better information on subgroups and categories of migrants with little data (eg, labour, 
undocumented, and trafficked) in order that these groups are not omitted from needs 
assessments and budget allocations for responses.

Internal migration—Although international migration receives the most political and 
public attention, most movement globally is internal migration. In 2009, the number of 
people who moved across the major zonal demarcations within their countries was nearly 
four-times greater (740 million) than those who moved internationally.56 Approximately 
40% of urban growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America results from internal migration 
from rural to urban areas.57 In many LMICs, rural-rural internal migration to work in the 
agricultural sector still accounts for the largest number of people on the move.58 Previously, 
evidence suggested that internal migration was dominated by single men, however, recent 
trends show increases in women moving for work and to seek freedom from discriminatory 
social and cultural norms.59 From 2014 to 2050, the proportion of people living in urban 
areas, largely because of migration from rural areas, is expected to increase from 48% to

64% in Asia, and from 40% to 56% in Africa.57 Producing global estimates on internal 
migrants is methodologically challenging and routine data are rare.60

There are considerably more internally displaced persons because of conflict and natural 
disasters than asylum seekers and refugees globally. However, they also receive substantially 
less attention than asylum seekers and refugees, primarily because of the importance 
attached to national borders and citizenship, as well as the availability of better data 
collection for refugees. In 2017, there were 30·6 million newly internally displaced people 
associated with conflict and disaster.61 East Asia and Pacific was the region with the highest 
number of internally displaced people due to disasters and sub-Saharan Africa was the 
highest due to conflict and violence. Between 2008 and 2017, the number of individuals 
displaced because of conflict and violence was fewer than those resulting from disasters 
(figure 5).61

Labour migration—The International Labour Organization estimates suggest that in 
2013 there were 150·3 million international migrant workers in the world.54 Although 
official figures indicate that the largest proportion of international labour migrants is in 
North America and northern, southern, and western Europe, these figures are perhaps 
misleading. Regional labour migration in LMICs often goes uncounted because of regional 
and bilateral labour and trade agreements, as well as undocumented or irregular border 
crossing.54,62 LMICs are estimated to host roughly 25% (37·9 million of 150·3 million) of 
total labour migrants globally.54,63 Moreover, it is important to note that these figures will be 
underestimates as they exclude undocumented international migration between neighbouring 
countries and workers in the informal economy. Among labour migrants globally, 2013 
figures indicate that more migrant workers are male (56%) than female (44%).54 Women 
more commonly work in service jobs (74%) and less often in manufacturing and 
construction work (15%).54 Increases in the migration of women could be due in part to 
shifts in gender, social, and migration norms, and in other part by remittances they will 
receive,64 which create greater opportunity for women to migrate. Adolescent girls also 
migrate for work, driven by financial incentives,65,66 and hopes for greater freedom and 
empowerment. However, recognition is growing of the number of young women who end 
up in exploitative work.67 Comparative national data are very poor for the patterns and 
prevalence of internal labour migration, especially for harder to monitor forms, such as 
seasonal and often circular migration.

Forced migration—As of 2018, two billion people live in countries affected by civil 
unrest, violence, or ongoing conflict.68 In 2017 there were a total of 25·4 million refugees 
globally, with 19·9 million refugees under the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ 
mandate and 5·4 million Palestinian refugees under the UN Relief and Works Agency’s 
mandate. Monitoring historical refugees numbers that fall under the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees’ mandate reveals the percentage of international migrants who were refugees to 
have remained less than 11·4% following a peak in 1990 (figure 4). Consistent with the trend 
in percentage of refugees in relation to all international migrants, the number of refugees 
falling under the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ mandate decreased from 17·8 
million to a low of 8·7 million from 1992 to 2005, followed by an increase to 19·9 million

in 2017 (figure 6). Africa had the highest percentage of refugees under 18 years in terms 
of the countries of origin and countries of asylum application in 2015 (see supplementary 
figure 2 in the appendix). Further details on the regional variation in the number of refugees 
are provided in the supplementary figures 3 and 4 in the appendix. Previously, most forcibly 
displaced people lived in camp-like settings, however, now refugees are more likely to 
live outside of camp settings in developing regions; 85% of the world’s refugees reside 
in developing regions and 58% live in urban areas, as reported in the 2017 Global Trends 
Report. Forced displacement from long-term conflicts, such as the Syrian conflict, have 
resulted in a protracted refugee situation for millions of refugees, who often reside in urban 
and peri-urban settings without formal refugee status. For example, less than one-fifth of 
refugees in Jordan live in camps.69

There were an estimated 1·9 million claims for asylum in 2017 and a total of 3·1 million 
asylum seekers whose refugee status was yet to be determined.70 The number of asylum-
seekers with pending claims increased by 28% by the end of 2017, compared with 2016 
according to the 2017 Global Trends Report. Asylum-seekers are increasingly experiencing 
longer periods with pending claims. There is enormous variation in the total number of 
asylum seekers by country of origin (see supplementary figure 5 in the appendix) reflecting 
proximity to source countries, and the proportion successfully securing refugee status. In 
other categories of forced migrants, the numbers of individuals who are undocumented and 
often the most vulnerable, are not available as they are often not in contact with authorities.

Resettlement is a considerable challenge. Refugees with acute health and medical needs 
are among the top priorities for consideration for resettlement referral by the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, and some resettlement countries expedite consideration of 
refugees facing acute health risks. In 2018, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
established that about 1·2 million refugees around the world needed resettlement.71

Human trafficking and modern slavery—Human trafficking, forced labour, and forced 
marriage, now referred to collectively as modern slavery, is estimated to affect 40·3 million 
people globally, according to 2017 estimates from the International Labour Organization.72 
These new figures indicate that there were 25 million people in forced labour and highlight 
that there are also 15 million people in forced marriage. This number equates to 5·4 people 
for every 1000 individuals in the world.73 Regionally, Asia appears to have the largest 
number of modern slavery cases, with 62% of all enslaved people, followed by Africa at 
23%. Women and girls are disproportionately affected, accounting for 71% of cases, as 
are children, with one in four individuals who are trafficked under the age of 18 years. 
Women and girls are commonly trafficked for sex work, domestic service, and as brides. 
Men and adolescent boys are more likely to be recruited, often deceptively, for various 
forms of strenuous manual labour, including commercial fishing and construction.74 Sexual 
minorities who are trafficked are often subjected to forced sex work.

Climate change refugees—Global climate change is driven by anthropogenic 
atmospheric and oceanic warming, and has global effects causing rising sea levels, shrinking 
of the cryosphere, and ocean acidification. Climate change has the potential to affect and 
disrupt well known drivers and mechanisms of migration in the future to an unknown

but potentially striking degree. The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change,75 
discusses the potential effects on migrants including the effect on urban health, extremes 
of heat, and the social effect of population redistribution as a result of only people from 
some demographics having the resources to move. A 2018 study suggested that by 2070, 
the combined effects of climate change and the vast expansion of irrigated agriculture could 
result in deadly heatwaves. Such heatwaves could make large parts of northern China, with a 
population of 400 million, uninhabitable.76 Climate change will also increase the frequency 
and intensity of hydrometeorological hazards.77

According to a 2018 report by the World Bank, climate change has the potential to force 
more than 143 million people to move within their country by 2050.78 The messages are that 
internal climate migration could be a reality, but not necessarily a crisis, and that migration 
can be a sensible climate change adaptation strategy if managed carefully and supported 
by good development policies and targeted investments. The effects of climate change 
on migration are largely uncertain because migration is driven by complex multicausal 
processes, which also include social, economic, political, and demographic dimensions. 
These dimensions impact on each other and can be driven by the effects of climate change. 
The uncertainty is compounded by the fact that refugees fleeing conflict, war, or persecution 
are protected by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 
Protocol.79 By contrast, no international law recognises climate refugees, who are mostly 
seen as searching for better economic conditions. The World Bank report is confined to 
internal displacement, which limits its scope. For Bangladesh, a country considered to be at 
the front line for climate change effects, the World Bank projects that by 2050 there will be 
13·3 million climate migrants (surpassing the number of other internal migrants).78 In panel 
1, this projection is tested with use of detailed census data from 2001 to 2011. Migration 
attributed to hydrometeorological hazard risks from all causes are projected up to 2050, 
exceeding the World Bank figure of 13·3 million internal climate migrants. Therefore, as 
with northern China, the combination of global climate change and local anthropogenically 
driven environmental degradation could trigger substantial increases in migration. In our 
analysis, there was no automatic assumption for Bangladesh that climate change will cause 
mass migration, but rather that mass migration is occurring now and will increase, projected 
from current trends with large scale census data.

Political, cultural, environmental, and structural determinants of migration and health

Political determinants of health—Migration has become highly politicised, especially 
as some politicians try to curry electoral favour by migrant-blaming and undermining 
the welfare state. Stigmatising rhetoric has meant that the rights of migrants are under 
attack by the same structures and processes that are supposed to protect them. This 
occurs both in their country of origin, potentially leading some to move, and during their 
migration journey. The views, words, and actions of individuals in power both instigate 
discrimination and restrict access to education, work, justice, and health. The term fake 
news has recently been used to describe inaccurate information deliberately created or used 
to mislead. In a world of social media and populist discourse, fake news is used against 
migrants to undermine trust and divide communities. A previous Lancet Commission on 
Global Governance80 outlined the major influences and governance deficits that affect

health and the power disparities governing health inequity. This previous Commission 
highlighted how the goals of the health sector, which are inclusive towards better health 
for all, commonly come into policy conflict with the interests of influential global actors 
such as states and transnational corporations who prioritise national security, sovereignty, 
and economic goals.80 When considering the health of migrants in light of the Global 
Governance report, the convergence of health and migration is situated at the heart of these 
opposing governance goals. For example, the Global Governance Commission highlighted 
democratic deficits, or the insufficient participation of civil society, health experts, and 
marginalised groups, in the decision making process.80 Migrants often experience exclusion, 
and despite their participation as workers, consumers, and investors in the economy, they 
are frequently left out of democratic processes. The previous Commission report80 also 
indicated that these democratic deficits are compounded by weak or absent government or 
public accountability mechanisms to fix the failings in this exclusionary system. Moreover, 
the authors point out the leadership vacuum on health, which is particularly true for migrant 
health.80 For instance, in the UN system, these global concerns cross thinly through many 
UN mandates with no clear leadership or coordination with all relevant external actors (eg, 
civil society, philanthropic organisations, the media, business, and academia). With these 
profound governance gaps, voices are few and far between to combat the highly charged 
political rhetoric that demonises migrants.

Culture, ethnicity, and identity—Understanding issues of culture, ethnicity, and identity 
is crucial for achieving equity in health, including migrant health.81 Past and present 
migration dynamics have contributed substantially to the cultural and ethnic diversity of 
many societies, highlighting the importance of the cultural dimensions of health and medical 
care. Culture can be outlined as a linked group of customs, practices, and beliefs jointly held 
by individuals, social networks, and groups. These factors help define who they are, where 
they stand in relation to those within and beyond the group, and give meaning and order 
to life. Anthropologists describe culture as “a process through which ordinary activities and 
conditions take on an emotional tone and a moral meaning for participants”;82 this definition 
includes perceptions, beliefs, and practices related to health, suffering, and disease. Culture 
is thus never static but evolves in relation to a range of social, economic, and political 
factors, and experiences of individuals and groups.

Both migration and culture are processes that define an individual’s identity and are dynamic 
in nature. Migration and living as a migrant in transit or in a host community entails multiple 
occasions and stimuli for cultural adaptation and change, on individual and collective levels. 
Identity can initially be based on one’s place of origin (eg, ethnicity, nationality). As a 
migrant, aspects of oneself are regularly reshaped as new identities emerge and new labels 
are imposed (eg, migrant, foreigner, undocumented). New locations raise challenges and 
individuals develop strategies to respond to opportunities or constraints, including how 
they care for their own health and that of their family, and how they interact with health 
systems. On arrival at a destination, assimilation and acculturation could alter their risk 
profile to mirror patterns of local residents or their fellow migrants. Independent of specific 
ethnicity or country of origin, this change in risk profile could mean higher morbidity due to 
the deleterious interaction of multiple adverse structural factors, including marginalisation,

poverty, the effect of immigration laws and legal status, and poor access to care.83 Analysing 
the dominant discourse in host countries around migrants helps us to understand how these 
populations tend to be othered. The questioning by the general population and governments 
of the deservingness of some groups of migrants for health care has eventually supported 
actual practices and structures of exclusion.84 Such measures are both fuelled by and 
contribute to the anti-migration environments, which make individuals feel uncertain about 
their future, their safety, and the security of their family.

At all stages of the migration process, individuals and groups could be affected by the 
toxic consequences of social exclusion and discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, race, 
nationality, or migrant status. For some migrants, ethnic discrimination or persecution is 
their reason to leave their place of origin. Subsequently, in transit or in receiving countries, 
migrants are often subject to pejorative discourses fed by cultural stereotypes and racism. 
The creation of group identity through distinct cultural artefacts, language, and an assumed 
common origin or history is an essential feature of culture. However, this diversity can be 
used as a tool for discrimination, which can be created or increased by individuals who 
seek to divide communities. Divisive discourse has detrimental consequences, including 
the impact of raising unfounded fears of increased infectious diseases, violence, and 
demands on health resources within the host group, a situation well known from past and 
recent history. Migrants’ burden of discrimination is often doubled as they carry group 
characteristics that might be associated with additional prejudice and exclusion, for example 
related to intersectionality with gender or disabilities.

Discrimination towards migrants is commonplace and often conflated with racism. Anti-
migrant discrimination and racism overlap, sharing features of prejudice against the other, 
which are forms of xenophobia but distinct entities. Racism is based on the belief that one 
race or ethnicity is superior, justifying discriminatory actions. Anti-migrant discrimination 
is directed against migrants and tends to be a combination of prejudice against the other 
with fear over the loss of something to the migrant (eg, a job, a service). Crucially, 
discrimination against migrants is usually racism; that is, it is directed towards people 
who appear physically or culturally different. This racism can occur not only between the 
migrant and host community but also between one migrant group and another.85,86 Why 
is this distinction important? In political discourse, racism is usually socially prohibited 
and sometimes illegal. Discrimination against migrants, however, is considered acceptable 
for many and is commonly used in populist rhetoric. Anti-migrant language is a tool that 
provides the opportunity to divide populations on ethnic grounds to advance the majority 
view and to mobilise fear and hatred. For example, in September 2015, in an interview 
to Jornal Opção, the now elected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro described migrants 
from Bolivia, Haiti, Senegal, and Iran as "the scum of the world and their children 
are arriving in Brazil, as if we didn’t have enough problems to solve".87 When Viktor 
Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, was speaking about migrants in 2018 he stated 
that, "we do not want our own colour, traditions and national culture to be mixed with 
those of others".88 In the USA, anti-immigrant policies are associated with higher amounts 
of perceived discrimination in migrant and non-migrant Latino groups, providing a basis 
for the unequal treatment of both migrant and ethnic minority groups.89 A further study 
from the USA showed the effects on health; areas with higher anti-immigrant prejudice

were associated with increased mortality generally among minority ethnic groups, but 
the migrants themselves had lower mortality.90 This could also have intergenerational 
consequences. A prominent raid against Latino migrants, in which 900 agents of the US 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 389 employees in a meat-processing plant 
in Iowa in 2008, was associated with subsequent poorer perinatal outcomes (increased 
risk of low birthweight) among members of the Latino community.91 An example from 
the UK is the so-called hostile environment towards migrants created by the Conservative 
government leading to migrants and British citizens being denied health care. This hostile 
environment was recently highlighted in the Windrush scandal in 2018, in which British 
citizens who came to the UK from the Caribbean more than 45 years ago were deported, 
denied re-entry, lost jobs and accommodation, and were denied rights and benefits.

The sociopolitical context that leads to inequalities in health creates an accumulation of 
disadvantage throughout the lifecycle, and potentially over generations. Migrant related 
discrimination is a profound determinant of health, especially mental health and social 
wellbeing. Studies have shown the substantial mental health implications of living in a state 
of persistent unpredictability and uncontrollability over one’s future.92 Fear of deportation, 
discrimination, and targeted condemnation can influence a migrant’s willingness to seek 
care and maintain follow-up appointments, including to receive medical test results and 
follow treatment regimens. Studies indicate that the wider consequences of discrimination 
are substantial. It is estimated that Australia lost 3·02% of GDP (AUS$37·9 billion) over the 
period 2001–11 as a result of individuals experiencing some form of racial discrimination.93

Various countries have implemented interventions to address discrimination. For example, 
Canadian schools have implemented cross-cultural youth leadership programmes and anti-
racism courses to equip students and staff to deal more effectively with racism.94 In 
South Africa, the Roll Back Xenophobia programme used community radio to help combat 
negative stereotypes of migrants and promote social inclusivity.95 However, efforts to raise 
awareness of and support the needs of particularly at-risk migrant communities have an 
uphill battle against nationalist forces, exclusionary systems, parsimonious resourcing, and 
service-level biases.

Environmental influences and hazards—Extreme environmental events and ensuing 
disasters can cause displacement of populations. These could be naturally occurring hazards, 
such as tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions; pandemics of infectious 
diseases; or conflict and disaster, all of which form a complex driver of both internal and 
international migration. Importantly, the most substantial components of risk in a disaster 
are the vulnerability and exposure, rather than the environmental hazard itself.96 In this 
context, vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of an individual or population to the 
adverse effect of the hazard; the components of which are physical, social, economic, or 
environmental. Although disasters can result in an increase in vulnerability, they are also a 
consequence of the underlying vulnerability of communities, infrastructure, and processes 
because of poor preparation and mitigation.

The increase in extreme weather events has been linked to anthropogenic climate 
change,75,97 but global disaster deaths have reduced as a proportion of the population.

This reduction is attributed to progress in Disaster Risk Reduction actions98 reducing 
the vulnerability of communities, infrastructure, and health-care systems, and through the 
establishment of early warning systems. Reactive policies to a crisis that fail to address 
vulnerability can amplify the social, economic, and environmental drivers that turn natural 
hazards into large scale disasters.99 The majority of disaster deaths occur in fragile and 
conflict-affected states where Disaster Risk Reduction is almost absent.100 Disaster Risk 
Reduction aims to increase resilience and reduce the risk of disasters.

Large disasters typically cost between 0·2 and 10·0% of annual GDP depressing the 
economy101 and these costs could be considerably higher for the lowest income countries. 
Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, economic losses equalled GDP.102 Large disasters 
can exacerbate economically driven migration trends, in the medium to longer term from 
rural to urban areas103 and internationally.104 However, for localised disasters, where 
effective aid equals disaster losses, there might be no net migration.105 Evidence from a 
longitudinal study over 15 years in Indonesia showed that mostly permanent migration 
generally did not occur in response to disasters, with the exception of landslides.106 
However, there is contrasting evidence from the Caribbean islands, which had substantial 
post-disaster international migration, and tsunami affected Japan where large numbers of 
local working-age people and families from the Tohoku coast have permanently relocated 
to Tokyo and other large cities.107 Rising sea levels are likely to cause permanent migration 
of coastal populations in developing countries with the lowest likelihood of protection 
(eg, coastal defences), however the people living in these settings have strong abilities 
and desires to make their own mobility decisions.108 Evidence also shows migration into 
disaster areas after the disaster in response to government programmes to create jobs or as 
a result of economic migrants filling the jobs of displaced people. These inward migrants 
have heightened susceptibility to environmental conditions owing to lower social capital and 
poorer disaster awareness.

Slow-onset changes in land use and availability due to sea level rise, coastal erosion, 
precipitation, or agricultural degradation and sector loss will influence the pre-existing 
economic drivers of permanent migration.109 These changes might be caused by human 
interference, for example overuse of land or deforestation that renders the land infertile. 
Drought is a common cause of migration. For example, the drought in Odisha, India in 2001 
resulted in 60 000 people migrating, mostly to the adjoining state of Andhra Pradesh in 
search of employment.110 Migration involves substantial costs and the people with fewest 
resources have the least capacity to move away, and so are the most vulnerable to harm. 
Furthermore, environmental change has the potential to even further diminish people’s 
resources, exacerbating the vulnerability of a population. A resulting sub-section of the 
population, with the least ability to move, can become trapped.111 This non-migration 
influenced by environmental change is of great humanitarian concern.

It is essential for areas at high risk of natural disasters to develop strong Disaster Risk 
Reduction actions to mitigate future potential hazards and minimise mortality. An example 
of where Disaster Risk Reduction is important are the Rohingya settlements in Bangladesh. 
The Rohingya are the world’s largest stateless population, stripped of citizenship in 1982 
by the government of Myanmar. In late August 2017, renewed violence by the military

of Myanmar spurred a rapid mass exodus of Rohingya (655 000 people in 3 months) 
to the south-eastern region of Bangladesh.112 These locations, such as Cox’s Bazar and 
Bandarban, are very susceptible to cyclones, flash flooding, and rainfall-induced landslides. 
This risk coupled with the temporary, makeshift shelters often created by cutting into 
mud hillsides render the Rohingya highly vulnerable to environmental disasters. There 
is an urgent need to conduct multihazard vulnerability mapping of the refugee camp 
and surrounding areas, conduct mapping of human mobility patterns, improve drainage 
capacities of refugee settlement areas, develop evacuation and relocation processes, examine 
resilience of existing health-care centres to potential hazards, and generate a post-disaster 
plan.113

Education for migrant children and adolescents—Education is essential for 
children and adolescents and is a determinant of future health and wellbeing. Education 
includes formal schooling, and acquisition of cognitive, social, and other soft skills 
that foster intellectual and social growth. Migration disrupts a child’s formal education, 
including difficulties accessing school. These difficulties have the potential to result in lost 
generations of educated adults, particularly for irregular child migrants and unaccompanied 
children. In a study of access to public schools in 28 developed and developing countries 
across the world, 40% of developed and 50% of developing countries did not allow 
immediate access to irregular migrant children.114 Migrant children might also be excluded 
from school in some countries because they have not undergone health screening,115 or 
they might miss school days because of their poor access to services to treat even simple 
illnesses. Migrant children in school can have poor educational attainment or decide to drop 
out because of language barriers, unsuitable materials, or teachers who are inadequately 
trained to support student integration. For migrant children with disabilities, obtaining 
an education can be especially challenging because few countries will prioritise adapting 
education and school structures or providing the necessary staff to ensure that children 
with disabilities can obtain a good education.116 Migrant students are more likely than 
native students to be placed in groups with lower curricular standards and lower average 
performance levels.117 An analysis of Demographic and Health Surveillance data from 
Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania on the association between mean number 
of years of education and internal migration status indicates that, on average, migrants 
have more years of education than non-migrants, with the exception of rural-rural migrants 
(figure 7). The differences in the educational attainment of female migrants and male 
migrants is notable among all groups, with males more likely to stay in school longer, 
especially among urban residents.

Internal migration in China is subjected to the Hukou system, which is a household 
registration system that establishes service entitlements by internal divisions on the basis of 
residency.118 These regulations can mean that internal Chinese migrants do not have access 
to their own public education system, or other services, because the child is not registered in 
the region that they live.119

However, where migration is managed well, children can integrate quickly into a new 
system with younger children assimilating particularly well. All children and adolescents, 
regardless of their status, should have access to education. According to the UN Convention

on the Rights of the Child,120 states are responsible for making primary and secondary 
education available and accessible to all children, regardless of migration status. Primary 
education should be free and compulsory, and states should take progressive steps to make 
secondary education free as well. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities121 also requires that governments ensure equal access to basic services including 
education for people with disabilities. A practical example of the inclusion of child migrants 
is the Reaching All Children with Education programme in Lebanon, which sought to 
integrate large numbers of migrant Syrian children into its public school system, while 
simultaneously improving access for Lebanese children.122 The programme increased the 
number of school places, waived fees, and provided education grants with encouraging 
results emerging.122

Health and safety of labour migrants—Migrant workers’ earnings can sustain 
households and influence entire economies. For some labour migrants (primarily highly 
skilled individuals with sufficient education, employment, financial, or citizenship 
credentials), migration poses few risks. In these circumstances, migration is generally 
advantageous for livelihoods, health, and wellbeing. However, the majority of labour 
migrants are less well situated, often originating from LMICs and seeking work in response 
to financial or safety needs.

Distress migration or economic migration puts migrant workers at particular risk of unsafe 
transit and pressures, sometimes with coercion to engage in unsafe work conditions. Low 
wage labour migration is closely linked to globalisation and supply and demand, especially 
for cheap labour. Migrant workers in these jobs are often among the most invisible of 
migrant populations. Not only are they likely to work in informal or even illegal sectors 
but they are also less likely to take part in the formal economy, engage with the local 
community, or use official resources. Their safety is also often hindered by poor social, 
economic, or legal status to assert their rights.

Labour migrants rarely migrate on their own without the assistance of labour intermediaries, 
which includes both formal agencies and informal migrant networks. Labour brokers have 
a fundamental role in linking individuals to jobs, however it is not unusual for recruiters 
to charge exorbitant fees, causing migrants to incur substantial debt. Recruitment agents, 
including from a migrant’s own social network, often facilitate third-party contractual 
arrangements, day labour, piece-work, and similar precarious employment and pay 
arrangements. These arrangements lead to long hours, exhaustion, and serious health 
hazards. For example, Bolivian migrant workers have been led to seek jobs in harsh working 
conditions in textile workshops in Argentina through their social networks.123

Although labour migration has served to advance global markets and offer greater livelihood 
opportunities, there is growing recognition of the often exploitative and hazardous nature 
of many work sectors and their adverse effects on health and wellbeing, particularly in 
emerging economies. The health and wellbeing of migrant workers is directly related to their 
working and living conditions and influenced by broader social conditions (table). Harmful 
labour situations are not uncommon for many migrants, especially individuals in low 
wage sectors. Employment destinations frequently involve hazardous working arrangements,

dangerous tasks, and unsafe or unhygienic living conditions. For example, commercial 
fishing is considered to have some of the most hazardous work conditions—especially 
in situations of exploitation or so-called sea slavery. A study among trafficking survivors 
in the Thai fishing industry reported higher injury rates than non-trafficked fish industry 
workers. Additionally, in the fishing industry more trafficked workers were subjected to 
severe violence, compared with non-trafficked workers (table).124

As for all migrants, health protections such as health entitlements or health insurance, 
occupational safety and health regulations, and reliable social support are often not easily 
accessible, particularly for low wage sectors and informal work. In addition to the common 
barriers to care for migrants, migrant workers worry about missing work to seek medical 
care. Especially when workers are paid by piecework or are struggling to pay off debts, 
missing work is very difficult. Moreover, if the medical recommendation for injuries or 
illness is rest and time off, day-wage workers are unlikely to heed this advice. In locations 
where there are regional accords for cross-border labour migration, it is still not unusual 
for workers to avoid seeking medical care for fear of being dismissed for injury, illness, 
or for missing work. Migrant workers might be covered by insurance in some instances. 
However, even individuals who are insured might not understand that they are insured or 
that they have the right to seek care without paying. For example, in a study of Bangladeshi 
domestic workers in Singapore,125 72% did not know if they had received information about 
company-paid insurance, and of those individuals that had received information, 68% did 
not receive it in their native language.

The diverse group that comprise labour migrants encounter major health risks often related 
to employment policies, which are inadequate to ensure worker health and safety. Most 
low wage sectors are poorly regulated or inspected for protections against occupational 
hazards and stressors, including fair wages, financial insecurity, poor psychosocial work 
environments, exploitation, and verbal or physical abuse.126,127

Migrant workers’ health has been included in international frameworks such as WHO 
Healthy Workplaces: a model for action: for employers, workers, policy makers and 
practitioners.128 However, migrants often do not qualify for medical subsidies and are 
frequently not covered by the health-care financing schemes that protect citizens.129 Where 
such entitlements do exist, work to date suggests that interventions should be directed 
towards improving migrant workers’ knowledge of workplace health and safety and about 
their health-care entitlements to improve their uptake.130 There have also been questions 
about whether the welfare state is a driver of migration. Research in the USA found little 
evidence for a link between welfare generosity and internal migration across states.131

Migrant workers’ human rights to health are often severely restricted. Three UN agencies 
jointly found that "migrant workers are among the most vulnerable workers in the world, 
often subject to exploitation, discrimination, and abuse, lacking access to mechanisms for 
remedy and redress and in constant fear of deportation".132 Only a small minority of migrant 
workers globally who sustain occupational injuries receive medical treatment.133 A report on 
the ten most notable human rights violations affecting global business included recruitment 
of migrants and refugees into forced labour, a near-absence of information on labour

practices deep within the supply chain, and inadequate oversight of suppliers.134 From a 
human rights stand-point, the right to health requires states to ensure occupational health 
and safe working conditions in accordance with the International Labour Organization 
occupational health conventions 155 and 161, and regardless of immigration status. SDG 
8, on decent work and economic growth, calls on governments to “protect labour rights 
and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant 
workers…”,135 and the UN General Assembly has called for adequate workplace health and 
safety and protection against violence and exploitation of migrant workers.136 Nonetheless, 
states with substantial numbers of migrant workers often obstruct migrant worker freedoms 
and safety. For example, in the Gulf Cooperation Council member states, the kafala or 
sponsorship system restricts workers’ ability to change or leave their job without their 
employer’s permission, or challenge any unfair treatment by the employer (see access to 
health systems section and supplementary table 2 in the appendix).137 These restrictions 
have allowed private sector employers to pay exploitative wages, engage in unprotected 
hazardous work, and force workers to live in crowded, squalid, and unhygienic living 
quarters.

Section 2  Achieving safe and healthy migration

A strong case for action on migration and health exists, and evidence indicates that 
safeguarding the health of migrants will have positive effects for global wealth and 
population health. Countries have a moral and legal obligation to respect the human rights 
of migrants, although these obligations are not always respected by states. Over the past 
century, multilateral agencies and nation states have moved the migration and health agenda 
forward through various notable instruments and events (figure 8). One of the key challenges 
in progress on advancing the migrant health agenda is the cross-cutting nature of the 
migration health topic, which demands sustained multisectoral and intersectoral partnerships 
and policies for meaningful action. Policy developments at global, regional, and national 
levels since 2008, when the first World Health Assembly resolution 61.17 on the Health 
of Migrants was adopted, have shown evidence based practices on how to overcome such 
challenges. Successes have occurred through whole-of-government and whole-of-society 
approaches. Examples of these successes can be seen in national migration health policy 
development by countries such as Chile and Sri Lanka, multi-stakeholder coordination 
platforms including civil society and academia (eg, the Joint UN Initiative on Migration, 
Health and HIV in Asia and the Joint Initiative on the Health of Migrants and their families 
in Central America and Mexico), and implementation of comprehensive refugee responses 
(eg, in Uganda where provision of comprehensive health care to refugees is integrated within 
health facilities also serving host communities).

Most of these instruments include important principles supporting the health of migrants 
and propose several measures for consideration by member states and stakeholders to 
achieve health for all migrants. It is time for the health community to strongly advocate 
for all individuals who migrate to ensure safety and access to health for all and to hold 
governments accountable to the migration policy instruments and conventions.

In section 2, we review these policy instruments and conventions and the mechanisms by 
which states can be held accountable for a migrants’ right to health. We then explore how, 
in addition to these conventions, health services can be developed to protect and improve the 
health of migrants.

Strengthening respect for migrants’ rights

Migrants’ right to health—The right to the highest attainable health extends to all 
individuals who migrate, regardless of their circumstances of migration or their legal status. 
International human rights treaties, most notably the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, guarantee “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health”.78

States are obligated to respect the right to health by not interfering in its realisation, such 
as through policies that exclude some people from health programmes. They should also 
protect the right to health by ensuring that third parties do not interfere with this right, 
such as by discriminating against migrants. Also, states should fulfil the right by ensuring 
the provision of health services that meet essential elements of availability (economic, 
physical, and geographical, non-discriminatory accessibility, cultural, and other forms of 
acceptability) and adequate quality. However, these rights do not necessarily translate into 
entitlements and often states are implicit in this discrimination.138

For refugees, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol guarantees 
the right to “the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded 
their nationals” (Article 23), which has been interpreted to mean access to health services 
equivalent to the host population.139 However, health care for refugees is often poor because 
of inadequate resource allocation by front-line refugee-hosting countries and because states 
with large numbers of refugees, such as Jordan and Lebanon, are not signatories to this 
treaty. Difficulties can also arise for refugees resettling in non-signatory states where the 
law does not guarantee their right to access health care, social services, education, or 
employment.

For internally displaced persons and irregular migrants, access to health care is often 
severely restricted. Many states grant irregular migrants access only to emergency care, 
a practice that is both overtly discriminatory and is inconsistent with good public health 
practice for the host population and for migrants. In Europe, some states have shown that a 
humane response to migrant health is possible140 and expanded access to health services for 
migrants, especially for asylum seekers and children without regular documentation status. 
However, there remain major disparities in entitlements to access to health care on the basis 
of legal status (see supplementary table 3 in the appendix).

Ensuring limits to health-related restrictions on entry—According to UNAIDS, as 
of June 2015, 35 countries have imposed some form of travel restriction on people with 
HIV.141 Of these, five countries completely bar the entry of people who are HIV-positive, 
four countries require proof of HIV-negative status even for short-term stays, and 17 
countries deport people who are found to be HIV-positive (see supplementary table 4 in the 
appendix). States impose other health-related restrictions on entry on the basis of infectious

disease, communicable disease, drug dependency, mental illness, pregnancy,142 or cost of 
care, and permit deportation on these grounds (see supplementary table 5 in the appendix).

These restrictions on entry or deportation for diseases with low risk of casual transmission, 
such as HIV and AIDS, leprosy, and hepatitis C, are impermissible on both public health and 
human rights grounds.143,144 The policies violate migrants’ right to health and the ability of 
migrants with disabilities to enjoy the right to freedom of movement, choice of residence, 
and nationality on an equal basis with others.121,145 Linking health status to migration 
enforcement reinforces distrust of the health system and limits migrants’ ability to access 
health care on a non-discriminatory basis.8,146

In practice, health-related enforcement regimes can pressure health workers to act as 
immigration control agents. This practice violates their professional ethical requirements 
as practitioners, an issue that has been taken up by civil society organisations like 
Docs Not Cops in the UK. Deportation can interrupt medical treatment, and deportation 
on the grounds of pregnancy also violates women migrant workers’ rights to privacy, 
bodily autonomy, and reproductive choice; as well as their right to equal treatment, equal 
employment rights, and freedom of movement.7,8,145,147 Protection of the public is often 
invoked as a basis for these policies. However, if public health is invoked as a basis for 
denial of entry or deportation, the Siracusa principles relating to limitations on civil and 
political rights demand that the policy be necessary to protect public health, be based on 
evidence, be the least restrictive means available to accomplish the public health objective, 
and be applied without discrimination.8,148 Further, screening for highly contagious diseases 
should be done voluntarily and with informed consent, include pre-test and post-test 
counselling, and be confidential.149 Mass screening at entry for HIV, pregnancy, and 
disability is never permissible.149 Care should be taken that where pre-entry screening 
programmes operate, they do not represent a barrier to individuals seeking to migrate.

Several HICs impose residence restrictions on the basis of claims of high treatment 
costs, especially for migrants with particular chronic diseases or disabilities. For example, 
according to Australia’s Migration Act and Regulations grant, the Minister for Immigration 
and Border Protection can use their discretion to reject permanent residency applications if 
an applicant has a health condition for which treatment is “likely to result in significant 
health care and community service costs to the Australian community”.150 However, 
applicants for specific visas (including particular humanitarian, family, and skilled work 
visas) can apply for a waiver of the requirement.150,151 The five most common reasons 
for rejection on health grounds are intellectual impairment, functional impairment, HIV, 
cancer, and renal disease.152 As described earlier in relation to infectious diseases, these 
restrictions violate the rights of people with disabilities to liberty of movement and choice of 
residence.121 As such, the implementation of the law should be reasonable and proportionate 
to achieve a legitimate end. All too often, cost based restrictions are applied in an arbitrary 
manner across the board without individualised determinations. Also, they often do not 
adequately consider the potential economic, social, and cultural contributions that migrants 
with disabilities make to their host communities and countries, instead considering them 
only in terms of cost to the state.153

Protection of refugees and asylum seekers—The 1951 Refugee Convention and 
Protocol79 provides specific protections to refugees. Its centrepiece is Article 33, prohibiting 
non-refoulement, or the return of a refugee to a country where his or her life or freedom 
would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
social group, or political opinion. The Convention and Protocol also prohibit states from 
penalising refugees seeking protection for unauthorised entry or presence, whether through 
criminal prosecutions, arbitrary detention, or the imposition of other penalties, so long as 
they present themselves to authorities and show good cause for entry.79 States may not 
discriminate against refugees on account of race, religion, or country of origin. Equivalent 
protections apply to internally displaced persons, including freedom of movement and the 
right to leave a country and seek asylum elsewhere. Although 43 states have neither signed 
nor ratified the Convention and Protocol—including countries such as Bangladesh, Jordan, 
and Lebanon, which host sizeable refugee populations—these states are indirectly obligated 
to respect the principle of non-refoulement and other rights of asylum seekers and refugees 
through other relevant international instruments like the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.145

Among other rights guaranteed by the Convention, Article 17 requires receiving states to 
provide refugees with the same right to wage earning employment as nationals of a foreign 
state in the same circumstances, and the non-discrimination provisions of human rights laws 
do not permit distinctions in work based on nationality or migrant status. However, only half 
of the signatories to the Convention and Protocol grant refugees the right to work.154 As a 
result, refugees have to work unlawfully, if at all, which means they often encounter other 
rights violations and are at an increased risk of trafficking.

Gaining adherence to the requirements of the Refugee Convention and Protocol has been 
challenging, as a mechanism is not included for reviewing state compliance, so there is no 
or little accountability. Further, to avoid their duties to refugees and asylum seekers under 
the Convention, states often erect barriers to asylum seekers crossing into the country. These 
include providing incentives to neighbouring states to prevent asylum seekers travelling 
through those states from reaching the border, detaining asylum seekers for long periods of 
time, and criminalising unauthorised entry. Another strategy, adopted by the EU through the 
EU-Turkey deal, has been the return of refugees, who are fleeing the conflict in Syria, to 
Turkey; this has been on the grounds that Turkey is a safe third country. Yet, Turkey does 
not recognise all rights of Syrian refugees under the Convention. These barriers to entry 
often increase the health risks facing asylum seekers, leave them in difficult and dangerous 
situations, and push them to turn to irregular travel. The UN Global Compact on Refugees 
should address some of these concerns by strengthening support for immediate and ongoing 
refugee needs and offer incentives for good practice through assistance to national and local 
institutions and communities receiving refugees. However, the Compact on Refugees does 
not ensure strengthened enforcement or accountability.

Human rights of children in forced migration—Migration enforcement policies 
directed at adults, including detention and deportation, inevitably affect children.155 
Children of parents who have been deported experience increased emotional and 
psychological symptoms.156 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child120 guarantees

civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights to all children, irrespective of migration 
status or citizenship. The Convention requires that states act in the best interests of the 
child.120 Identifying the best interests of the child requires a comprehensive review of 
the child’s circumstances and ability to exercise basic rights, such as to education, health, 
and family unity. Children’s rights to life, survival, and development (Article 6) provide a 
framework for migrant and refugee children’s rights in host countries. States should ensure 
equal opportunity, access to services, and the chance for all children to thrive and reach 
their potential.120 As in other dimensions of international migration, however, national laws 
affecting child migrants often do not adhere to human rights requirements, treating children 
and adolescents as foreigners first, and often prioritising immigration enforcement policies 
over children’s rights.157

Immigration detention, human rights, and health—States are increasingly treating 
unauthorised border crossing as a criminal offence and detaining immigrants, regardless of 
circumstances. In 2018, the USA announced a zero tolerance policy for unauthorised border 
crossings, announcing that it would prosecute 100% of such crossings as crimes, regardless 
of whether the migrants included family groups with children. As a result, migrants have 
been arrested and jailed, and children, including very young children, have been separated 
from their parents.158

Evidence repeatedly shows the range of negative health consequences associated with 
detention, especially for children and adolescents. We systematically reviewed 38 peer-
reviewed studies on the effects of immigration detention on health outcomes (Ramos et al, 
unpublished data). We found that most of the studies concerned male adults originating 
from Middle Eastern countries who were detained in Australia (38%) or the UK (22%). All 
studies showed negative health outcomes attributable to detention, especially mental health 
disorders. However, these studies are often limited by methodological constraints.

Detention poses clear violations of one of the most important international agreements, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,145 which states that “everyone 
has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary 
arrest or detention”. The 1951 Refugee Convention and Protocol79 established protections 
prohibiting penalising refugees because of entry without documented permission or presence 
and restrictions on movement other than those that are necessary, such as to verify identity 
or protect national security.159 Detention is only warranted when persuasive evidence exists 
that the individual poses a danger to the community, or is likely to flee to avoid further 
immigration proceedings, and must be of short duration.160 For children, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child120 permits states to use detention “only as a measure of last 
resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time”.The UN Committee on the Rights of 
the Child found that immigration detention of children is never in the best interests of the 
child.161

However, throughout the world, detention of irregular migrants, including asylum seekers, 
is often used routinely, arbitrarily, and for an indefinite period.162 Conditions in detention 
facilities are often substandard, failing to meet needs for adequate food, clean water, health 
care, light, space, safety, and sanitation with consequences for health.163,164 Detainees,

especially children, are commonly subjected to violent victimisation, including abuse 
and rape.165 Detention also impairs immigrants’ access to other human rights that can 
have profound and long-lasting effects on health, such as obtaining housing, education, 
employment, and pursuit of claims for asylum. Numerous human rights and health experts 
have called for gradual abolition of immigration detention because of its arbitrariness, 
detrimental effect on health, and flimsy justification.166

Gender, law, and health—As noted, health and migration are both highly gendered, 
affecting women, men, and sexual minorities differently. Discriminatory laws frequently 
sustain or foster health inequalities by gender, rather than protecting individuals, especially 
for women and girls and sexual minorities. For example, host countries are often governed 
by plural legal systems that severely limit women’s and girls’ rights to access contraception 
and abortion, avoid early marriage, and escape violence. Additionally, in humanitarian aid 
settings, implementing agencies often apply host country laws rather than international 
standards to determine the scope of access and rights of migrant women and girls. Examples 
of discriminatory laws in countries with very high numbers of displaced people are 
described in panel 2.

Some promising programmes and interventions exist to enhance gender justice for forcibly 
displaced people. For instance, the UN Development Programme, the UN Population Fund, 
and local partners launched a project to protect female migrants in refugee settlements in 
Iraq from exploitation, human trafficking, forced and underage marriages, and sexual and 
gender based violence.176 This project offers novel opportunities for female Syrian refugees 
to receive free and long-term legal assistance in addition to counselling and psychosocial 
support.176 The work of the Rights in Exile Programme, formerly known as the Fahamu 
Refugee Programme, is also notable for consolidating resources to support migrant legal aid 
advisers and advocates,177 and has gathered resources for legal advisers providing support 
for LGBTI migrants.178 Gender responsiveness, which focuses on respecting human rights, 
is referred to in 12 of the 23 objectives in the Global Compact for Migration.

Access to justice—Poor access to justice can lead to adverse health outcomes. People 
who migrate, for whatever reason, have the same rights to access justice as all other 
people under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.145,179 Yet, migrants 
encounter numerous obstacles to justice systems, (eg, for violations of workplace rights 
and fair adjudication of asylum claims). Access to justice is frequently stymied by poor 
information, employer intimidation, lack of access to legal counsel, language barriers, and 
unfamiliarity with procedures. Individuals in refugee camps or settlements face difficulties 
accessing justice180 because camps are often located in remote areas where courts are 
absent, legal representation is scarce, and judicial systems might be weakened by civil 
unrest and war. Frequently, people are also unfamiliar with formal legal systems and further 
hindered by poor education, language barriers, and previous reliance on informal, local 
justice systems.181

Health services for mobile populations

Universal and equitable access to health care before, during, and after 
migration—One of the most promising measures to address health inequities is access to 
health care through universal health coverage. Migrants have a right to health and universal 
health coverage is a key strategy for the realisation of that right. Universal health coverage 
is a structural intervention under which “all people and communities can use the promotive, 
preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufficient 
quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose 
the user to financial hardship”.182 Making universal health coverage truly universal will 
promote SDG 3.8, which recommends “financial risk protection, access to quality essential 
health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines 
and vaccines for all”. Creating such systems that integrate migrant populations will benefit 
entire communities with better health access for all and positive gains for local populations. 
Therefore, this coverage should be championed by politicians and health-care leaders. To 
examine the potential role of this coverage to improve health in relation to global migration, 
we focus first on the health system and access for migrants, building on published work183 
on transforming health systems towards SDG 3 targets and our conceptual model (see 
supplementary figure 6 in the appendix) to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for 
all at all ages. We build on established health system analytic frameworks by addressing 
governance, health financing policy, health information systems, and the health workforce 
with a focus on migration.

Equitable access to health systems—A health system is the collection of people, 
institutions, and resources that aim to improve, protect, maintain, and restore health.184 How 
health systems are conceptualised and structured is primarily linked to nation states and their 
constituent units. Migration can create challenges for health systems due to people crossing 
between system boundaries. That is, health systems are generally delimited by geopolitical 
borders, which has made it difficult to assess how they might be strengthened to become 
migrant-inclusive. This difficulty is particularly found in situations of conflict that result in 
the spatial reorganisation of health systems within and across borders. These transformations 
can complicate the inclusion of displaced populations into health systems.185 Considerations 
for a health system that aims to be inclusive cover addressing heterogeneity in service 
delivery, ensuring cross-jurisdictional networking and interoperability, and protecting the 
rights of individuals and communities to access health services. Indeed, analysing health 
systems requires people-centred frame-works that are sensitive to individual and population 
care needs rather than determined by jurisdiction.

Level of access varies globally with published data providing some examples of good 
practice (see supplementary table 3 in the appendix). We did a secondary analysis of data 
from the Migrant Integration Policy Index (see supplementary panel 1 in the appendix), 
which complemented our analysis of access to health care in European countries (Law and 
human rights section). In our Migrant Integration Policy Index analysis, Italy received the 
highest rating of all countries, having a notably inclusive system that provides for asylum 
seekers and legal migrants under the same system as nationals. In Italy, undocumented 
migrants have access to wide health coverage, which is specified in the country’s law.

Countries that scored poorly required migrants to pay for specific insurance when the 
national population was not required to, did not provide any exemptions for migrants, and 
detained undocumented migrants identified by health-care systems.

Drawing on the patient centred access framework by Levesque and colleagues,186 we 
developed a new people-centred health systems framework for migrants’ access to health 
and social protection (figure 9). Our framework is underpinned by concepts of equity to 
emphasise human rights and equal access to health care regardless of status. The framework 
explicitly defines health and social protection by highlighting both the supply side, or 
accessibility of services and determinants of health, such as water, nutrition, and sanitation; 
and the demand side, or the ability to access services. Both the demand and supply side are 
influenced by geographical, economic, and institutional factors, including law. These supply 
side and demand side factors exist within the broader context of how governance institutions 
define and protect the rights of people (including migrants and other marginalised groups 
equitably) to access and use health services and determinants.187 Guided by this framework, 
we reviewed the health system accessibility as it relates to migration.

Overcoming barriers to health services—National regulations, private employer’s 
provision of health, or legal status coverage all interact with accessibility and create barriers 
to health services. Some countries, such as Kenya, have national treaties or constitutions that 
assert the right to health care for every person. Despite such legal protections, compared 
with Kenyan patients, migrants often continue to encounter obstacles including harassment, 
cost differentials, administrative issues, and language barriers.188 Differences between189 
and even within190 countries in the rights of migrants to access health services are striking.

Unaffordable health services remain a substantial barrier for many migrants (eg, among 
Syrian refugees in Jordan, cessation of free access to health care is taking a negative toll on 
the health of refugees).191

Fear of deportation is of importance to undocumented migrants or unsuccessful asylum 
seekers, especially in locations where public health workers have a so-called duty to 
report undocumented migrants. These mandates contradict the fundamental ethics of health 
workers to do no harm, can hinder individual and public health, and result in further 
criminalisation of migration. Data from Doctors of the World’s European clinics suggest 
that the contradictions between health and immigration goals are considerable and growing 
across Europe.192 As a result, individuals with irregular status or who are displaced without 
a regular residence often avoid making themselves known to formal services.

Logistical challenges to provision of health services compound these hindrances, including 
transportation, job commitments, waiting times, or poor knowledge of how to navigate the 
medical system.193 Migrant workers who are paid by piecework or by the hour can rarely 
afford to sacrifice the time and income to seek medical care until it is urgent. To overcome 
these issues, health and social services might need to be taken closer to people, be available 
in more places, and be more mobile to achieve good access. As a result, various services 
have come to understand that medical care and health promotion campaigns need to be 
mobile to reach vulnerable migrant populations who are at the greatest risk of harm, which

encorporates human rights approaches and equal access. Panel 3 outlines examples from the 
USA of mobile health services and other examples including mobile clinics such as the La 
Caravana de la Vida (The Life Caravan), which reaches artisanal gold miners in Madre de 
Dios, Peru.200

An understanding is emerging on the ways health needs in conflict-affected settings can 
be supported by telemedicine with digital health technology, such as cellular technology 
or cloud-based solutions.201 However, these technologies require rigorous assessment and 
monitoring during roll-out with particular attention paid to possible intervention induced 
inequalities. Implementation should be undertaken with evidence-based models, but if 
successful, such systems could help achieve SDG 3 indicators and foster better data 
collection among populations that are especially likely to be left behind.

Governance and leadership of universal health-care systems—Governance and 
leadership in the development of universal health-care systems that facilitate safe and 
successful migration processes have been absent until now. The current focus on provision 
of universal health coverage is therefore an exciting opportunity for this leadership vacuum 
to be filled. Such leadership commitment, as shown by the current WHO Director General, 
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, needs to be followed by concrete actions and be inclusive of 
migrants, in all countries and globally through better coordinated leadership across the UN 
system.

The importance of migrant health was emphasised by the World Health Assembly 
(resolutions 61.17 in 2008 and 70.15 in 2017). WHO Europe then created a “strategy 
and action plan for refugee and migrant health in the WHO European Region”.202 This 
document sets out various actions for inclusion of migrants into health systems. We 
specifically call for member states to take positive action in this respect, particularly 
through: appointing a government migration and health focal point that can engage multiple 
sectors; integrating migrants into existing national health structures and health systems; and 
providing inclusive health and social care that appropriately meet migrants’ needs.

These calls to action and strategic frameworks have not been implemented by many 
countries and more work is urgently needed to ensure existing policies and guidelines 
around migration and health are fully implemented. Exceptions to the lack of progress 
include how Switzerland has shown leadership in the provision of open health systems 
for all migrants, and countries such as China (panel 4) have made substantial progress in 
improving access for internal migrants.

Financing universal health coverage for all stages in the migration journey—
When a universal system does not exist, migrants are often unable to access even basic 
standards of health care for several reasons, one of the most important of which is cost. Well 
designed health financing systems can prevent any individual or family from experiencing 
catastrophic costs due to ill health, but this is unfortunately not the case in many countries. 
To address such issues, the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution 58.33 set out a 
series of statements with regards to sustainable health financing, universal coverage, and 
social health insurance, and urged member states to “ensure that health-financing systems

include a method for prepayment of financial contributions for health care, with a view 
to sharing risk among the population and avoiding catastrophic health-care expenditure 
and impoverishment of individuals as a result.206 If implemented, policies such as those 
recommended by resolution 58.33 would ensure that no migrant is subject to financial 
hardship for health care. However, prepayments are particularly challenging for migrants, 
particularly if they become unexpectedly unwell shortly after, or during the migration 
process—a point at which any prepayment is unlikely to be sufficient to cover costs.

Several countries have managed to achieve impressive changes in coverage and financing 
of their health systems, including pro-poor pathways towards universal health coverage 
and specific coverage for labour migrants.207 These examples show how countries 
have managed to provide coverage with limited budgets, while being inclusive of 
migrants, but tend to focus on labour and other forms of documented migration. A 
systematic review identified six ways to improve coverage including adjusting eligibility 
criteria, improving awareness, reducing insurance costs to improve affordability, improving 
enrolment processes, strengthening delivery of health care, and improving the organisational 
delivery of insurance schemes.208

Health insurance schemes exist in many countries but do not cover migrants. A study of 
access to health services among migrants (including labour migrants) in the Greater Mekong 
Region (Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam)209 identified substantial 
diversity in the capacity of health systems to address the needs of migrant populations. 
Thailand, for example, has sought to improve migrant health coverage. This improvement 
has included developing migrant health programmes, migrant worker agreements, and 
the implementation of migrant health insurance schemes. In Vietnam, health coverage is 
provided to migrant workers. However, in the Greater Mekong Region overall, access to 
high quality health care remains very poor, particularly for migrant workers and especially 
individuals with insecure legal status.

In addition to health insurance and general taxation mechanisms to fund universal health 
coverage for documented migrants, innovative ways of financing might be particularly 
helpful for individuals who are undocumented and individuals temporarily transiting through 
a country. Several examples of such mechanisms exist. Foreign exchange transaction taxes 
have considerable potential for fundraising and are also a way of migrants indirectly 
financing the coverage themselves, given their likelihood of using such services. A 
new intergovernmental bond scheme administered either through a newly created global 
organisation similar to the Global Fund to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis and Malaria or a 
regional entity should also be explored. Such mechanisms can also be administered through 
existing regional bodies where they exist such as the EU or African Union. Such a fund will 
allow nation states to provide care to settled and transient populations; this might be possible 
by drawing on funding from various sources including governmental donors, charitable 
sources, and taxation of or contributions from beneficiaries where they are able to work or 
wish to purchase additional cover. These forms of regional and global support and solidarity 
are necessary to enable less wealthy countries to make progress that will be to the benefit of 
host and destination populations.

Ensuring the provision of migration-appropriate health information systems
—Health information systems are the cornerstone of efficient and effective health-care 
provision and are used for assessing needs, delivering care, assessing quality of services, 
and accounting and financing. At present, most health information systems do not collect 
routine information about the migratory status of individuals.210 Risks are associated with 
collecting this information (panel 5) although these are often outweighed by the wider 
overall benefits once mitigated. Health information systems that do not collect data for 
migration are unable to provide useful data to monitor differences in risk factors, morbidity, 
and mortality between migrant and non-migrant populations, an essential step in monitoring 
and improving equity of service provision to this group. When health information systems 
are misused, civil society, academia, and health-care workers—including through the 
creation of so-called sanctuary hospitals and sanctuary doctoring213—can play an important 
and essential role in standing up against the data misuse. Human rights law can reduce 
the risk as it requires respect for confidentiality and other protections against misuse of 
information. Finally, information governance and encryption procedures can be built into 
health information systems so that while data can be produced on migrants, they remain 
anonymous.

The health-care providers of many refugees have developed bespoke information systems 
based on such a system’s ability to disaggregate populations by refugee status, enabling the 
monitoring of services, and humanitarian standards. It was therefore proposed that these 
systems remained separate and specific to the situation but would feed into the national 
infrastructure.214 Despite the advantages of such an approach, there are risks associated with 
developing a completely separate system for refugees and other migrants. Separate systems 
make comparisons between the host population and migrants much more challenging as the 
data collection processes and outcomes typically vary. Instead, national health information 
systems should be adapted, with only minor additions, to collect information on migrants 
that will provide public health and policy makers with better, more accurate data. A truly 
universal system requires joined up and universal health information systems. For these 
reasons we argue that wherever possible, these information systems should be adapted to 
include data for migration, rather than separate systems being used.

Cultural competence—The health sector cannot fully assess and support health needs, 
including health promotion, surveillance, and service provision, without understanding 
users’ backgrounds and perspectives and the mechanisms for exclusion. Approaches to 
tackle such challenges, however, need to be rooted in an understanding of the cultural 
context and its intersection with the environment. Yet too often, assumptions about the 
health risks and behaviours of individuals from cultural or ethnic minorities stem from 
misunderstandings, stereotypes, or racism, as described in section 1. These misjudgments 
and prejudice can obscure relevant individual, social, structural, economic, or political 
factors.82

Health-care provision should be culturally appropriate and sensitive to the individual’s 
understanding of health. Racism at social and institutional levels, as well as in the case 
of individual health providers, must be recognised, confronted, and avoided; this includes 
less obvious forms of racism enclosed in stereotype assumptions regarding health risks or

health related concepts, beliefs and behaviours held by members of particular ethnic or 
migrant groups. The acceptability of health services for migrants depends on the ability 
and preparedness of health professionals to provide culturally informed care,215 which 
includes cultural humility: an understanding of and reflexivity about their own culture 
in order to foster non-paternalistic clinical encounters.216 To balance the awareness for 
culture with the need to address other relevant factors, and to avoid cultural stereotypes, 
structural competence (eg, training in medical education to understand the broader structural 
forces that influence health outcomes) is also needed.217 This need is reflected in an 
anthropological study of irregular Mexican farm workers in the USA, which showed that 
in contrast to the physician’s assumptions, the migrants’ culture was not the primary barrier 
to health access.218 Instead a range of structural issues, including farm schedules, economic 
pressure, absence of insurance coverage, and the mobility of farm workers determined use of 
local health resources.

Cultural competence is thus not just a technical skill that can be acquired through specific 
courses or training, although such training is an important starting point; it should be 
an ongoing commitment to "awareness of the cultural factors that influence another’s 
views and attitudes" regarding health and disease.81 Cultural competence supports the 
health-care provider in approaching the patients’ understanding of the illness, and how 
she or he “understands, feels, perceives, and responds to it”.82 This includes notions and 
practices commonly identified as traditional medicine, that for many reasons might be of 
great importance for the patient and his or her family and peers. Systematic reflection of 
the health providers’ own assumptions, beliefs, conventional understandings, and values 
regarding medicine, health, and their own culture or ethnic heritage is also essential. 
Understanding organisational culture, how medical institutions and professional groups 
function in particular settings (eg, non-governmental organisations providing humanitarian 
assistance), are also important factors to consider in providing effective health care for 
migrant populations.81

An additional domain when considering migrant health is the provision of adequate 
translation services and culturally appropriate health related support services to migrants 
to increase their understanding of health and how to access services.219 High quality 
interpretation and cultural mediation are among the most important factors in best practice 
delivery of health services to migrants.220 The use of family members as translators when a 
professional interpreter is not available is, by contrast, highly problematic. It is problematic 
for issues of confidentiality, quality of the translation, problems related to discussing 
sensitive topics, and the psychological burden (eg, for children when translating serious 
health issues for their parents). Moreover, it is important to consider that interpreters and 
individuals providing support services from the same country of origin or ethnicity might 
belong to socially and politically different parts of society, which can lead to associated 
challenges in effective provision of care.

Section 3  Burden of disease and migration

International migration and mortality

For many years, researchers pursued the theory of a healthy migrant effect, which has 
been described as "an empirically observed mortality advantage of migrants from certain 
countries of origin, relative to the majority population in the host countries, usually in the 
industrialised world".221 However, not surprisingly, this theory is now considered to be 
reductionist because it neglects the diversity and complexity of migration-related factors 
that influence people’s health and how these affect individuals at different stages of the life 
course.222 It also disregards that the health benefits of being a migrant tend to reduce over 
time.

To complement the Commission’s work, a systematic review and meta-analysis on 
mortality outcomes in migrants was undertaken.16 96 studies, mostly from research done 
in HICs, were included. The meta-analysis provides evidence of a mortality advantage of 
international migrants in high-income settings. There were only two ICD-10 categories for 
which there was evidence of increased standardised mortality ratios, infectious disease and 
external causes. As detailed in the Article,16 our results point to the need for improved 
data collection and reporting in migrant health research. The results of this analysis will be 
representative of international migrants in HICs, but not forced migrants in low-income and 
middle-income settings, for which better data is urgently required. Our systematic review16 
highlights the heterogeneity of standardised mortality ratios by country of origin,223 which 
is consistent with other studies. Moreover, other evidence indicates the importance of age at 
migration, type of migrant, year of migration, social class, and policies towards promoting 
health in the receiving country.224

Internal migration and mortality

To explore internal migration and mortality, we did a case study with novel analysis 
of Health and Demographic Surveillance System data from sub-Saharan Africa (panel 
6). Findings indicate that in half of the study sites, migrant mortality was 50% higher 
than non-migrants. These findings are strengthened by results from a study of internal 
migration and AIDS, tuberculosis, and non-communicable disease mortality in four Health 
and Demographic Surveillance System sites in South Africa and Kenya, which showed that 
in-migrants (from within the same country), and return-migrants even more so, had a higher 
mortality risk attributed to both non-communicable and infectious disease.227,228

Migration and morbidity across the life course

Here, we describe the health effects of migration on selected morbidity outcomes to show 
varying effects through the life course and in different migrant groups and, if available, 
we summarise evidence of effective interventions. Migrant health at different periods of 
life varies in important ways in comparison to non-migrants, and can lead to longer-term 
or intergenerational effects. There is paucity of evidence comparing migrant groups with 
the population in the location of origin and, unless otherwise stated, the studies relate to 
international migrants, with the comparison group being the host population. This paucity 
of evidence makes it difficult to ascertain whether migration itself improves or worsens

health. The reality is that it would improve and worsen different risk factors for health at an 
individual and population level. The health risk profiles of migrants are determined by their 
pre-migration status and is a complex combination of biological and socioeconomic factors 
developed over their lives. Moving to a new location will change someone’s risk profile, 
with some determinants of health improving and others worsening. As people usually move 
to improve their lives, many risk factors will lessen, resulting in better overall health than 
they might have had in their previous location; however, a comparison to the host population 
only might make it appear that their morbidity is higher.

Perinatal health

An umbrella review (including 19 systematic reviews) of perinatal outcomes among 
migrants and refugee women compared with the host population generally found worse 
outcomes among migrants for maternal mortality, maternal mental health, preterm birth, 
and congenital anomalies.229 A meta-analysis of 18 million pregnancies in Europe showed 
that migrant populations had an increased risk of perinatal mortality (odds ratio [OR] 
1·50, 95% CI 1·47–1·53), preterm birth (OR 1·24, 1·22–1·26), low birthweight (OR 1·43, 
1·42–1·44), and congenital malformations (OR 1·61, 1·57–1·65). Importantly, these risks 
were significantly lower in countries with policies promoting social participation and 
active integration with the host population (Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden).230 In contrast to the umbrella review, a further large meta-analysis including more 
than 20 million pregnant women moving to high-income industrialised countries, found that 
children of migrants generally fared better in terms of perinatal outcomes. For subgroups of 
migrants from Asia and Africa, there were increased rates of preterm birth and mortality, but 
Latin American migrants were at a lower risk of preterm birth.231 The reasons for adverse 
birth outcomes included underlying conditions in the mother that could be exacerbated by 
migration, such as heart disease or HIV, poor access to and interaction with the health 
service, communication problems, socioeconomic deprivation, and the stress of migration.

Migration is also commonly associated with stressors that can have substantial effects on 
maternal mental health and post-partum depression. In a meta-analysis of perinatal mental 
disorders among women from LMICs living in HICs, 31% had symptoms of any depressive 
disorder and 17% had symptoms of major depressive disorder.232 Estimates suggest that 
within the first year after childbirth, the risk of post-partum depression is 1·4–2·2 times 
higher in immigrant versus non-immigrant women.233 Risk factors included a shorter period 
of residence, lower amounts of social support, difficulties adjusting to the new country, and 
perceived insufficient household income.229

Child and adolescent health

Children and adolescents who migrate generally adapt and integrate well into new 
environments. They do well especially when supported by families and when engaged in 
quality education with access to health services. The risk factors for health in the location 
of origin can be profound (eg, huge health benefits result from escaping trauma or conflict 
settings). Healthy development in infants, children, and adolescents occurs in the context 
of stable and caring relationships. The extent to which migration can alter these social 
determinants of health is immense and migration during sensitive developmental phases,

especially when exposed to stressors, can determine later health outcomes and the health 
of the next generation. Migration can break up and alter family units, and loss of parents 
and carers can lead to emotional and psychological harm. However, migration can also 
bring families together and new family and social networks form over time. Maintenance 
of secure family structures and functions during the migration journey can help protect 
children and adolescents from some of the most adverse influences, while continued 
access to learning environments is essential for all children and adolescents. Migration 
can also disrupt the provision of health care such as immunisation schedules, threaten early 
childhood development, and limit access to schooling.234

Overall, far less evidence is available on adolescents compared with young children, 
despite adolescents constituting a larger proportion of migrants (figure 4). As children 
mature through adolescence (10–24 years) they become more directly exposed to social 
determinants of health beyond the family (eg, education, gender norms, racism). During 
puberty, brain maturation results in increased sensitivity to real and perceived differences 
related to migration. Beyond simply feeling different, the experience of stigma and social 
exclusion by bullying can contribute to emotional distress, anxiety and depression, and 
self-harm, including suicide.235 Some of these effects can be intergenerational. For example, 
migration of the mother as an adolescent or young adult was associated with lower 
sociability and problem-solving skills in her children at 4 years of age compared with 
children born in the country or children born to mothers who migrated when below the age 
of 12 years.236

Mental health—A systematic review of mental health outcomes in economic migrants 
found ambiguous results, varying by migrant group and host country.237 A meta-analysis 
of internal migration in China showed that migrant children have a greater risk of 
internalising (eg, depression, anxiety, loneliness) and externalising problems (eg, aggression, 
hyperactivity) in public schools, but not in migrant-specific schools.238 Among forcibly 
displaced children in HICs, higher rates of psychological morbidity have been recorded. 
Only a small number of studies have looked at migration itself with inconclusive results, 
but evidence shows that pre-migration factors, such as exposure to violence, were predictors 
of mental illness. Comparison studies with left-behind children are rare. Factors, such as 
support from families and friends and a positive school experience, can be protective. There 
is also evidence of increased mental illness239 and autism240 in second generation migrants, 
potentially mediated via epigenetic mechanisms and, in mental illness more generally, by 
their parents’ reactions to stress.

Nutrition—Rapid transitions associated with migration can lead to substantial changes in 
diet, exercise, and infectious disease exposure, all of which can affect nutritional status. 
Improving access to quality food by migrating would improve health, but changes in 
lifestyles, shrinking social networks, and the adoption of a diet high in fat, sugar, or 
processed foods can lead to obesity.241 Poor nutrition, particularly during fetal stages and 
infancy, coupled with rapid weight gain in a new environment can lead to an increased 
long-term risk of non-communicable diseases. In addition to under-nutrition, migration can 
lead to rapid weight gain, with evidence that timing of migration alters obesity rates.242

Children affected by migration can experience both being undernourished and overweight. 
For example, a Swedish study found an association between maternal migration and lower 
body-mass index in children less than 5 years old but higher body-mass index in older 
children.243 Apart from promoting breastfeeding, most other nutrition interventions vary 
according to the context and health outcome.244

Unaccompanied minors—Unaccompanied minors are typically 15–18 year olds who are 
“separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult 
who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so”.245 They are particularly at risk, both 
from the circumstances that have rendered them unaccompanied (eg, war, parental death) 
and the risks that can arise when offered less protection by close family. The group is 
diverse and includes victims of trafficking or modern slavery, individuals reuniting with 
family, and people seeking a better life. Less experienced than older adults, and generally 
impoverished, they are at great risk of exploitation. Unaccompanied minors can be subject 
to disputes over their age (panel 7). The younger the age of the unaccompanied minor, 
the greater the risks are to them. Unaccompanied young adults are also likely to be 
at greater risk than those protected by their immediate family. Health risks result from 
exposure to substances and unsafe sexual behaviours, and greater risk of early school 
completion and unsafe employment. Unaccompanied girls are particularly at risk of sexual 
violence and unwanted pregnancy.249 The accumulation of risks can result in complex health 
needs, especially mental health problems, which can then be compounded by issues around 
residency status.250

Left-behind children—Children might be left behind when parents migrate, usually for 
work. Though there are no global estimates for the number of left-behind children, estimates 
indicate 61 million in China alone. The effects of parental migration on the health of 
left-behind children are mixed. In some settings there is evidence of a beneficial effect (eg, 
through receipt of remittances), but in others, children encounter adverse consequences. 
We undertook a systematic review of the literature in any language, including in Chinese, 
across key areas of child and adolescent mental and physical health.15 We identified 
111 observational studies with outcomes for mental health, nutrition, infectious diseases, 
injuries, and key determinants of health. Most studies addressed children of internal 
migrants in China and showed no difference or worse outcomes in left-behind children 
or adolescents, compared with those of non-migrant parents. The meta-analyses showed an 
increased risk of anxiety (relative risk [RR] 1·85, 95% CI 1·36–2·53), depression (RR 1·52, 
1·27–1·82), substance use (RR 1·24, 1·00–1·52), suicidal ideation (RR 1·70, 1·28–2-26), 
stunting (RR 1·12, 1·00–1·26), and wasting (RR 1·13, 1·02–1·24) among left-behind children 
and adolescents. No differences were found in the risk of being overweight or obese or 
experiencing abuse. In all the meta-analyses heterogeneity was high, however the results 
were robust to sensitivity analyses; removing low quality studies and subgroup analyses 
of internal and international migration showed little difference. Parental absence and lack 
of supervision can lead to unhealthy risk behaviours in left-behind adolescents. Given the 
very large population of left-behind children globally, the increased risk of mental disorders, 
substance use, and malnutrition represent a major concern.

Women, men, and sexual minority health

The health and morbidity patterns among adult migrants are associated with a combination 
of pre-existing factors, their new environment and lifestyles, and exposures during their 
journey. This combination of factors results in a great deal of variation in morbidity. 
Commonly, differences also exist between specific health conditions among recently 
migrated populations versus long-term residents. In this section, we review the latest 
evidence in this area.

Mental health—In general, prevalence rates of mental illness vary widely. First generation 
international migrants tend to have higher prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and 
post-traumatic stress disorder compared with the host population, with an increased risk in 
asylum seekers and refugees.251 Men appear to have a higher risk than the host population 
for mood disorders (RR 1·29, 95% CI 1·06–1·56), but no difference has been observed 
between host and migrant women.239 Risks of psychosis and schizophrenia are consistently 
higher among migrants, approximately double the risk compared with the host population, 
and these effects are carried over into the next generation.252,253 The reasons for the 
differences in mental health outcomes and the variation between individuals and groups 
is multifaceted. They reflect real differences in precipitating risk factors, for example 
exposure to violence and traumatic events, time in the new setting, and, importantly, 
methodological variation. Discrimination is also implicated across a range of mental health 
outcomes including depression, psychological distress, anxiety, and wellbeing.254 Perceived 
discrimination has also been linked to specific types of physical health problems, like 
self-reported poor health and breast cancer, and potential risk factors for disease, such as 
obesity, hypertension, and substance use.255

Mixed results were found in mental health status in Chinese rural-urban internal migrants 
compared with urban non-migrants, but no difference or worsening mental health status 
was observed compared with rural residents. Social and economic exclusion were both 
important determinants of mental illness.256 Research on the mental health of migrants 
typically focuses on refugees, asylum seekers, and torture survivors. Systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses often indicate intersurvey variability. A review and meta-analysis of 181 
surveys from 40 countries, comprising 81 866 refugees and people affected by torture and 
conflict found that the unadjusted weighted prevalence rate was 30·6% (range 0–99%) for 
post-traumatic stress disorder, and 30·8% (0–86%) for depression.257 Compared with labour 
migrants, refugees had approximately double the prevalence of depression and anxiety.258 
Mental health interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy259 and trauma-focused 
therapy260 have some efficacy in treating post-traumatic stress disorder, and community-
based mental health services have been consistently shown to improve outcomes.261

Communicable diseases—Control measures for infectious diseases have long been 
established, including processes such as quarantine of visitors and animals at ports of 
entry. The true risk of transmission arising through migration is, however, a function of 
multiple factors. Risk varies according to the route of transmission of the pathogen, its 
transmissibility, the degree of mixing between the infectious and susceptible population, 
and the available control measures in place to mitigate transmission risks. Outbreaks of

infectious diseases can be sustained by population movement. For example, during the west 
African Ebola outbreak, population movement within and between countries contributed 
to sustaining transmission.262 An important risk in relation to the spread of infections is 
the emergence and subsequent transmission of antimicrobial resistant strains that emerge 
in one part of the world and spread to other regions.263 However, the spread of such 
resistant pathogens is not due to migration, but driven by international travel and tourism 
and the movement of livestock.263 The public health burden of infectious disease in 
migrant populations remains high in many settings. Strong preventive services, including 
immunisation and screening programmes, and curative services to ensure early detection 
and treatment of infections in migrants are needed. Where screening programmes are 
established, they need to be evidence-based and culturally acceptable. Ultimately, the self-
interest approach (improving global health security is designed to help the migrants but it is 
also good for the host population) is to strengthen global health security by supporting the 
establishment of sustainable health infrastructure and systems in all countries that are more 
mobility aware.

Physical disability—For people of any age with a range of disabilities (eg, individuals 
with mobility, visual, hearing, intellectual, or mental health impairments), the process 
of leaving home and travelling elsewhere can be physically challenging, stressful, and 
confusing, especially in times of crisis. These difficulties also often lead to later departure 
in times of economic stress or humanitarian disaster, placing them at additional risk. 
Furthermore, migration can disrupt existing social and medical support networks. People 
with disabilities are frequently and incorrectly assumed to be less able or competent, leading 
to an inability to find work or find enough work in a new community to cover their expenses 
or contribute to their households. Although the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities121 guarantees equal access across borders to all, people with disabilities 
experience discrimination during the immigration process, struggling to pass immigration 
tests and understanding oaths of alliance, or meeting minimum income requirements. People 
with disabilities in all societies are substantially more likely to be victims of violence.264

Non-communicable diseases—Increasingly people are moving with established non-
communicable diseases and often combined with a double burden of communicable 
diseases. The interruption of care during transit—due to barriers to health access, 
documentation, absence of health-care providers, or disrupted health systems—prevents 
the continuous treatment necessary for the effective management of many chronic health 
conditions.265 The absence of effective prevention, screening, and continuity of care in 
migrant populations result in higher burdens of non-communicable disease morbidity and 
mortality. Evidence has shown that migrants undergo rapid changes in environmental risk 
factor profiles. When compared with the native Danish population, migrants from Africa, 
Asia, and the Middle East had 2·5 times the incidence of diabetes.266 This difference 
could be due to various factors such as poor health literacy and language barriers leading 
to difficulties accessing services, shift in socioeconomic status, decreased amounts of 
physical activity, and changes in diet. A systematic review of 37 studies of migrants to 
the EU found lower morbidity due to any malignancy in migrants compared with the host 
populations. For specific cancers some exceptions existed (eg, liver cancer), and incidence

varied by the region migrants moved from.267 Consequently, more effective integration of 
non-communicable disease care into health systems and humanitarian responses is essential.

Tobacco and alcohol use—Although tobacco and alcohol use in migrants has been 
shown to be heterogeneous and context-dependent, various underlying risk factors were 
identified including unemployment, poor working conditions, language proficiency, level of 
integration, number of traumatic experiences, and community cohesion. Studies suggest that 
migrant smoking prevalence is dependent on the prevalence in the country of origin and in 
the host country. For example, Ghanaian migrants in Europe were more likely to smoke than 
both rural and urban dwellers in Ghana, but still smoked less than the host population.268 
Several studies in HICs and for internal migrants in China have shown that migrants are less 
likely to smoke than non-migrants,269,270 while male migrants from Europe, North Africa, 
and the Middle East in Australia were found to smoke more than Australian born men.271 
A study in Kazakhstan showed that international labour migrants reported higher rates of 
hazardous alcohol consumption compared with internal migrants and the host population.272 
Conversely, in Peru, the prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking was the same for 
rural-urban internal migrants as their rural and urban counterparts.273

Occupational health outcomes in labour migrants—Rates of fatal and non-fatal 
injuries are higher in labour migrant populations compared with non-migrant populations. 
This difference is in part due to the type of employment (eg, construction, fishing, and 
metal-working); however, even within these sectors, occupational morbidity and mortality 
is higher among migrants than native-born workers (table).274 Occupational harms differ 
by sector and include injuries, exposure to weather or pesticides, respiratory conditions, 
depression and anxiety, and infectious diseases. As part of a new analysis done for 
this Commission (Hargreaves et al, unpublished data) we did a systematic review and 
meta-analysis focused on international labour migrants (originating from 24 LMICs). This 
analysis found a reported prevalence of 47% of migrants documenting at least one morbidity 
(7260 migrants, 95% CI 29–64, I2=99·7%), including predominantly musculoskeletal pain 
and dermatological conditions, and a prevalence of reported injury and accidents in 22% of 
migrants (3890 migrants, 95% CI 7–37, I2=99·4%).

However, other studies have shown no difference for migrant and non-migrant health in 
some sectors. In general, men are more likely than women to endure workplace injuries, 
illness, and fatalities.275 Migrant workers operating in many of the most hazardous work 
sectors might not be aware of, or have access to, occupational health and safety training or 
personal protective equipment.274

To date, few studies have explored the mental health of migrant workers. A review that 
compared labour migrants to refugees found that refugees had approximately double the 
prevalence of depression and anxiety. Importantly, the authors suggested that financial 
stress is a substantial risk factor and that a higher gross national product in the country of 
immigration was related to lower symptom prevalence of depression or anxiety (or both) in 
labour migrants but not in refugees.258 Examples of the consequences of financial pressures 
on mental health in trafficked migrants are described in panel 8.

Sexual and reproductive health—Addressing sexual and reproductive health needs 
can be particularly challenging because of the risks of sexual abuse and exploitation,277 
especially among children and adolescents. Cultural practices can also increase health risk 
for girls and women, such as early or forced marriage,22 genital cutting, and historical and 
cultural norms, including unfamiliarity with or restricted use of gynaecological and obstetric 
care.

Sexual violence or threat of abuse exacerbates reproductive health problems and can deter 
women and young people from seeking care. Importantly, it is not uncommon for sexual 
abuse among boys to be overlooked, nor is it unusual for professionals to be ill-equipped 
to detect and treat men and boys who have been sexually abused. Traditional practices and 
beliefs can also be a point of contention, as new migrant populations call on local health 
services and social support organisations. Female genital mutilation or cutting is a human 
rights violation, with substantial mental and physical health implications. At least 200 
million girls and women have been subjected to genital cutting in 30 countries.278 Health 
systems in locations where the practice is uncommon need to be able to manage the resulting 
morbidity in migrant women and girls. Health-care practitioners are well positioned to detect 
and address the negative effects of female genital mutilation or cutting among pregnant 
women. They can also help prevent the practice in girls in high risk families through 
provider training and guidelines, culturally appropriate information, and engagement with 
self-help groups for the communities concerned.279 Similarly, for migrant sexual minorities 
or LGBTI groups, appropriate and sensitive sexual services can be difficult to find. For 
example, in urban centres in China, approximately 70% of HIV infections are among rural 
Chinese residents, of whom 80% are 16–29 year old men, a portion of whom are so-called 
money boys or individuals who engage in transactional same-gender sex.280

Forcibly displaced women and adolescent girls might have facilitated access to much-needed 
sexual and reproductive health services if they enter well equipped humanitarian aid settings. 
Without such targeted services in place, migrant women and adolescent girls can be 
more vulnerable to poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including unwanted 
pregnancy, pregnancy complications, sexually transmitted infections, and unsafe termination 
options.281,282 Humanitarian aid agencies have established an agreed set of essential 
services to respond to reproductive health needs in humanitarian crises. The Minimal Initial 
Service Package includes preventing and managing the consequences of sexual violence, 
reducing HIV, and preventing maternal and neonate mortality and morbidity.283

Violence—Migration can be a movement away from physical or structural violence. For 
people fleeing from violence, whether by crossing an international border or moving within 
their own country, migration allows people to move away from circumstances in which their 
life and freedom were at risk.284 However, mobility and relocation can create substantial 
risk factors for various forms of gender-based violence, including rape, intimate partner 
violence, sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. Systematic reviews on health and 
human trafficking indicate that trafficking survivors are exposed to multiple physical and 
psychological abuses, sexual violence, confinement, occupational hazards, and poor living 
conditions.285 The physical, mental, social, and financial consequences of these extreme 
forms of exploitation are multiple, severe, and often enduring, especially psychological

consequences.285 A meta-analysis of studies in humanitarian settings suggested that 21% 
of female refugees or displaced women in complex humanitarian emergencies experienced 
sexual violence, a probable underestimation.286 Despite the prevalence of gender-based 
violence in refugee populations, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of prevention 
programmes, interventions, and strategies.287

Mobility can increase or decrease these health and safety risks among LGBTI migrants, 
depending on the comparative amounts of discrimination and stigma in origin, transit, 
and destination locations. Research in LGBTI migrants suggests that these individuals 
are especially likely to have mental health disorders as a result of cultural or even state-
sponsored persecution and violence. Many LGBTI migrants report emotional, physical, 
and sexual violence committed by their families, leaving them without a familial support 
network and even more susceptibility to violence upon migrating.288 Service providers in 
Nairobi have shown that LGBTI services for refugees need to be accessible and highly 
confidential to prevent further harassment or violence.289

Migrants with disabilities are substantially more likely to be victims of violence and are 
less likely to be able to report such violence. This can be because of barriers such as 
not being believed or an inaccessibility of reporting mechanisms. Additionally, a scarcity 
of employment options because of stigma, prejudice, less access to education, and less 
job-related skills training result in many people with disabilities being at increased risk 
of poverty and consequently increased risk of sexual violence and forced participation in 
prostitution and household slavery.290

Older people

Evidence is scarce on the health effects of migration on older people (generally aged older 
than 60 or 65 years, but variable by region), particularly from LMICs. Older people might 
have additional health risks due to multimorbidity, for example from interruptions to the 
continuity of care that contribute to clinical decompensation and declines in their health 
status. Despite lower mortality, morbidity is thought to be higher among older migrants. 
Analysis of population data from Belgium, England and Wales, and the Netherlands of 
healthy life expectancy at age 50 years (HLE50, expected number of remaining years in good 
health) found higher life expectancy in migrants compared with non-migrants, but HLE50 
was lower. This difference was particularly so for migrants not from HICs (ie, not from 
Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, or USA).291 Multicountry studies from 
across Europe show higher self-reported morbidity in older migrants compared with native 
people of the same age.292,293 A study from Sweden found an increased risk from 50% 
to 80% in cardiovascular determinants, such as physical activity, smoking, and body-mass 
index in older migrants.294

Studies of mental health in migrants across Europe found an increased risk of illness. 
Increased ORs of 1·6 in men295 for depression were found in older migrants, despite lower 
rates of other chronic diseases. Research in forced migrants also points to an increase 
in depression risk but evidence is insufficient to support this claim.296 The diagnosis 
and management of dementia is a particular concern among all migrants. With ageing 
populations, dementia is becoming more common globally. Migrant or ethnic minority

Section 4  Knowledge to address future migration and health challenges

This Commission argues for a paradigm shift in research on migration and health, with 
a deliberate effort to enhance the funding mechanisms and networks supporting this 
change. Collaborative work is needed that links academia, policy, and front-line health and 
humanitarian workers. Research in migration and health has traditionally been difficult to 
do, partly because of the high mobility of migrants.298 In this section, we outline how we 
can generate better knowledge to meet the needs of people on the move through better data 
collection, research, research funding, and ethics (panel 9).

Meeting the health needs of a mobile world

Research undertaken in migration and health has to respond to the whole population need. 
This includes not only the migrants themselves but also the other groups affected by 
migration, such as families left in countries of origin and host communities. To enable 
this response, the migrant population themselves should be viewed as an asset and a 
participatory approach encouraged, in which migrants and local communities are included in 
all stages of the research process. Further, mixed methods and qualitative research, including 
anthropological and sociological work, is needed to understand sociocultural factors of the 
migration experience, how to reduce barriers to health care, and how the determinants 
of health might affect migrants differently, with gender analyses throughout. This should 
be done alongside systems level work to develop processes to mainstream and normalise 
migration.

We used data from our systematic review on mortality16 to systematically examine which 
disease areas have been the focus of historical research. Our data suggest that despite being 
the only ICD-10 disease categories with evidence of increased mortality, infectious and 
parasitic diseases was the fifth most studied group and external causes of mortality was the 
third most studied group in international migrants. These data also suggested that labour 
migrants have been understudied relative to the size of this population globally.

These data can be used to inform future funding priorities, but the current lack of evidence 
is compounded by the fact that migration has not been a priority among health funders. 
Review of the mission statements and strategies of the main global health funders (including 
the Global Fund, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Bank, The Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, the European Commission, United States Agency for International 
Development, United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, Wellcome 
Trust, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Medical Research Council, and National 
Institutes of Health) suggest that only two, the Global Fund and the European Commission, 
prioritise migrant health. Some funding streams exist that focus on research in humanitarian 
settings,299 but generally opportunities in migration and health are poor. Research funding 
agencies (eg, national government entities, charitable foundations, and multilateral funding 
organisations) should prioritise specific calls to address these gaps.

Data collection, technology, and innovation

Traditional cohort studies are important to understand the life course and intergenerational 
effects of migration. However, these are expensive and can be inefficient when studying 
populations with high levels of loss to follow-up. Existing studies have therefore had 
sub-national coverage on migrants who have already moved.300 One efficient way to 
produce health data for migrants might be the use of electronic health records with national 
coverage.301,302 However, in most countries, migrants are not identifiable within these 
datasets. Big data, such as that collected from wearable devices, mobile phones, the internet, 
and electronic health records has the potential to provide new sources of information on 
migration and health and improve uptake and follow-up rates for migrant populations.303 
Progress in genomics, spatial models, and mathematical models, including mechanistic 
approaches that are driven by information from satellites, human behaviour data, and 
pathogen characteristics, will allow better elucidation of outbreaks and global mapping of 
infectious transmission.304,305

A difficulty in migration research is understanding internal migration flows with no border 
controls. A new method to map internal migrants is to use mobile phone data whereby 
each time a mobile phone is used, the location of the individual is logged. Anonymised 
mobile phone call detail record data can allow inferences about the movement patterns 
of individuals to be made, enabling tracking of the movement of populations at scale, 
even in remote areas. These data were used in 2016, when a monsoon in Nepal caused 
severe flooding and triggered a series of landslides. Using mobile phone call detail records, 
researchers were able to show that the monsoon resulted in large movements of people, 
examine the number of people who spent time outside their home area, identify where these 
areas of movement were, and identify individuals that were most affected.306

These new techniques are not without risks, ethical issues, and logistical problems. If 
personal health records or mobile data can be used to track where people have been, 
migrants might be reluctant to use them. In the case of the Dublin Regulation in the 
EU, this might mean that a migrant could be sent back to their first country of entry 
in Europe identified using such tracking technology. The acceptability of mobile health 
records therefore needs to be assessed further and any implementation of this method should 
undergo routine monitoring and assessment of the effects to include qualitative perspectives. 
Health professionals should recognise the need to protect the data and safeguards, including 
firewalls should be used to separate who can access the data. New technologies, such as 
the use of blockchains, can help to keep the data secure but might not be possible in low 
resource countries.

Intervention research

Although this Commission found ample evidence on differences in physical and 
mental health morbidity between migrants and host populations, information on specific 
interventions to improve the delivery of services or alter diagnosis and treatment pathways 
to better cater for migrants was scarce. To complement our understanding of health 
consequences, resources should be directed to find the best ways to improve health, from 
clinical and behavioural to health systems studies. Evidence on interventions outside the

health system and focused on improving social, political, and economical determinants of 
health are also essential. Outside of the humanitarian setting and in populations who have 
previously migrated, robust interventions to improve the health of migrants are uncommon, 
particularly for neglected groups, such as older people left behind when their families 
migrate or LGBTI migrants. If evidence of effectiveness exists, for example talking-based 
therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder in refugees,259,260 data are needed on how to 
scale up and assess them. There might also be scope for adaptation and evaluation of 
interventions that work in other marginalised groups.

Understanding the best treatment regimens and modifications in mobile populations to 
ensure continuity of care is urgently needed. Advances in digital technology allow diagnosis 
and monitoring of treatment for infections to be undertaken remotely; removing the need for 
a clinic visit allows the prospect of remote-management and self-management for mobile 
populations.

In populations that have been traumatised by violence, either at the individual or community 
level, research on pathways to prevent or improve management of both physical and 
mental health are needed. Schools have been suggested as important sites for mental health 
intervention research for both child refugees and their families, although studies done thus 
far have been small and difficult to replicate.307 Moreover, intervention implementation 
should include routine monitoring and evaluation of programmes to strengthen migration 
health interventions long term.

Health policy and systems research

Our analysis of health systems and migration concludes that current thinking on health 
systems could well have a migration problem. Mainstream views of a health system 
tend to be of a jurisdiction defined by geopolitical boundaries within which services are 
provided, rather than—more appropriately and justly—a societal response to people’s needs 
regardless of their official status. Contemporary advances in trans-disciplinary health policy 
and systems research can partly address this problem. Health policy and systems research 
is concerned with answering evaluative, explanatory, and exploratory questions focused 
on bringing change in health systems and the policy processes that shape and underpin 
them.308 Multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, 
and public health, contribute towards this change. Of late, there has been a turn towards a 
people-centric approach to the design and process of reasearch, with the recognition that 
changes in health systems are not focused on one thing but are driven by different people at 
different levels of the system, including service users and communities.309 As such, health 
policy and systems research has the potential to include migration in relation to health 
system research questions. Under the umbrella question of how we can make existing real-
world health systems more responsive to human mobility, thereby improving individual and 
population health outcomes, there is a range of valuable lines of inquiry. More qualitative 
research focusing on the experience of health care from the perspectives of migrant service 
users and providers can broaden and enrich our understanding of their needs in different 
settings. Finally, and essentially, implementation research on existing migration-friendly 
initiatives can help to identify bottlenecks and enablers, and which approaches work in

which contexts and for whom, and translate those insights to other contexts. As we have 
described above, all aspects of migration and health are gendered and thus implementing 
gender analyses in all research is strongly recommended.

Research ethics

Migration should be an essential component of public health ethics, particularly in relation 
to social justice. Migration is a good example of when ethical issues related to health and 
determinants of health exist across state boundaries. Many important ethical issues exist, 
including the prioritisation of services, the detention and deportation of migrants, and the 
labelling of and discrimination against migrant groups. However, literature is scarce on 
migration and public health ethics beyond issues of access to health care.

Compliance with standards of research ethics is essential and can be particularly challenging 
in vulnerable and mobile populations. The social, cultural, legal, and political aspects of 
migration status are often associated with higher amounts of susceptibility. Because of this 
inferior social position of many migrants and the risks from encountering deprivation of 
rights and dignity, researchers have to be highly sensitive and responsive to unintended 
and possibly harmful consequences of their work. The particular vulnerability to abuse and 
discrimination of disadvantaged groups demands the inclusion of the social and historical 
contextualisation of research. Systematic reflection on ethical questions thus should be a 
part of all steps in the research process. When defining the research question, it is crucial 
to reflect on whether the research is likely to produce valuable data to improve living 
and health conditions. Data collection can cause fear and distrust in populations with 
experiences of exclusion and persecution, and trigger traumatising events in the case of 
victims and witnesses of torture, sexual abuse, and other types of violence. Communication 
of research results should be sensitive to the risk of directly or indirectly sustaining or 
promoting stereotypes and stigma. The principle of first do no harm thus applies to all 
steps of the research process, while issues of confidentiality and informed consent especially 
apply to data security and the risk of abuse of medical and personal data (eg, migration 
routes reflected in the medical record) by migration authorities. Little is known about 
whether migrants are willing to share their data and the perspectives they might have 
on this. Research activities should be sensitive to systematically include ethical reflection 
and accountability in the research process and be responsive to findings that encourage a 
reconsideration of research questions and methodological and moral challenges. Institutional 
review board approval is mandatory for all research activities, yet not sufficient, as it lacks 
the required flexibility and responsiveness. A key process to ensure that the research is fit 
for purpose is to engage with the public on migration and health. This engagement is in 
the design of the research, participatory methods in the conduct of the research, and in the 
dissemination and discussion of the results.

Conclusion

Migration should be urgently treated as a core determinant of health and wellbeing and 
addressed as a global health priority of the 21st century. Migration and global health are 
both defining issues of our time. How the world addresses human mobility will determine

public health and social cohesion for decades to come. Our work for this Commission aimed 
to provide robust evidence on migration and health to examine the structures, systems, 
and contexts at the intersection of human mobility and individual and population health. 
By systematically presenting evidence on what is known about health and migration, it 
has been our intention to dispel populist myths about a perceived "other" and to suggest 
promising strategies for a highly mobile world. Amid international dialogues about safer, 
healthier migration, substantial gains can be achieved towards multiple SDGs by resisting 
the turbulence of nationalist xenophobic discourse.

In summary, our findings highlight that modern migration is a diverse and dynamic 
phenomenon, and the health of people who migrate generally reflects the circumstances 
of migration. Our evidence indicates that, with sufficient political will, the international 
community, states, and local providers have the knowledge and resources necessary to 
ensure that individuals who are most vulnerable to harm are not health-marginalised. But, 
at the same time, our findings suggest that attitudes, misperceptions, and cynical political 
motivations can hinder rights-based approaches to health for migrants, especially for people 
seeking safety and economic security for themselves and their family. We must ensure that a 
migrant’s equal right to health is respected and implemented.

Our multiple analyses also contradict myths about who is migrating where and the health 
burden of migration on recipient locations. Data for migration tell us that more people from 
LMICs are migrating within their own countries and region than across HIC borders, even if 
vocal political rhetoric implies otherwise. Additionally, migrants are, on average, healthier, 
better educated, and employed at higher rates than individuals in destination locations. 
However, many men and women who migrate are subjected to laws, restrictions, and 
discrimination that put them at risk of ill health. Particular mobile subgroups are especially 
likely to be exposed to migration-related harm and excluded from care, such as trafficking 
victims, irregular migrants, low wage workers, and asylum seekers. These highly vulnerable 
migrant subgroups are also frequently individuals who have been forced to move because 
of global economic and political forces well beyond their control. These global economic 
and political forces also apply to the populations left behind, when family members migrate 
for work or groups who are unable to flee from conflict areas or environmental dangers. 
The evidence indicates that through targeted rights-based laws; inclusive, migrant-friendly 
health systems; and mobile medical services, it is possible to reduce migration-related risks 
and increase peoples’ access and use of health services. Migration-informed laws, services, 
and public perceptions can increase determinants of good health. These determinants 
include social inclusion, safe employment with fair wages, good nutrition, decent housing 
and hygiene, and universally accessible health systems that do not result in potentially 
catastrophic costs for families.

Moreover, multiple opportunities exist to intervene to address health throughout the phases 
of a migrant’s journey. We believe that now is the time to call on our humanity and to 
take advantage of worldwide mobility to secure global health, especially for migrant groups 
who are most at risk of exclusion. We have the evidence, tools, and potential international 
political will via the UN Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on 
Refugees, and the SDGs.

The Commissioners have reviewed a mass of data collected by researchers from around the 
world. These data describe the scale and nature of migration and the many threats to the 
health of men and women and their families who are migrating. However, it is impossible to 
capture the entire distressing picture on the pages of a scientific journal. That would require 
the many individual accounts of tragedy, of children drowning in parents’ arms or dying by 
the wayside, or of individual heroism of people who risk their own lives to rescue them. 
For such stark realities, we can look to the few journalists and humanitarian organisations 
who have recorded these accounts, such as the now unforgettable picture of the lifeless 
body of Alan Kurdi being lifted from a Turkish beach. Anyone viewing these images should 
surely ask why the international community has done so little to live up to its commitments 
to advance the health of migrating populations, and especially individuals who have been 
forced to migrate. How can we explain this inertia?

There are no simple answers to these questions, but one indisputable reality is that, in the 
discourse on migration, health is far down the list of priorities. International meetings on 
migration are instead dominated by other considerations, such as domestic politics, national 
security, international trade, and commerce—especially when politicians ruthlessly exploit 
migration for their own purposes. These considerations almost always take precedence over 
the health needs of migrants. Indeed, if health is discussed at all, it is often unjustifiably 
framed as the migrant posing a threat to the population in the destination country, either 
as a vector for infections or a terrorist risk. Health and migration have competing, if not 
conflicting, policy goals. Health goals are inclusive (eg, better health for all, the Hippocratic 
oath) and international migration policy goals are exclusionary (secure borders, national 
trade). The other key challenges include financial issues and leadership.

Investing in the health of populations and individuals is generally an expensive long-term 
commitment, such as providing medical services over lifetimes. However, for state budgets, 
protecting borders and arranging deportation can seem a lesser investment for greater 
political gain often contrary to the more positive actual and perceived contributions of 
migrants by the public. Health leadership in the realm of migration policy making often 
seems to be considered as less important than other policy interests. Why are health leaders 
absent from the top table, engaging proactively in high level debates on migration? Instead, 
the health sector is often left to pick up the pieces of migration policies that leave the 
lives of migrants in tatters. Additionally, because the health sector will remain dedicated to 
these humanitarian ideals, policy makers can continue to prioritise security, exclusion, and 
trade, while discriminatory rhetoric reenforces the neglect and abuse of migrants. A second, 
much simpler question is why do some migrants have better health and health services than 
others? The answer is quite obviously related to the individual’s social and economic status 
and the power this wields. Therefore, perhaps the greatest challenge to achieving health 
equity for disadvantaged migrating populations will be promoting rights and empowerment 
that enable individuals to assert their own rights to health. The publication of the two 
UN Global Compacts with numerous references to health in the context of migration and 
for refugees presents an unprecedented opportunity that should be leveraged for specific 
action. Investments should be shifted towards empowering migrants through, for example, 
migrant worker insurance schemes or regional health and social accords. We present our 
recommendations for maximising the health of migrants in panel 10.

The post-Commission phase

The Commission hopes to inspire action, building on the health and health determinant 
aspects of the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact on Refugees, through 
various key initiatives. There is considerable momentum in the migration and health 
community to move from recommendations to action. We plan to engage at multiple levels 
of public life to raise the profile of migration and health. This engagement would be 
at the community level with the public, including migrants themselves and populations 
at all stages of the migration process. Secondly, we plan to support the establishment 
of an inclusive global mechanism that will bring together civil society with researchers, 
non-governmental bodies and charities, and multilateral organisations including WHO, 
International Organization for Migration, and the UN Refugee Agency to establish a 
distributed observatory to develop agreed indicators and a monitoring framework that has 
local, regional, and global reach. A distributed observatory is a model where several regional 
partners contribute to this global initiative following a common set of international agreed 
standards. The governance, reporting, and advocacy efforts will include the use of reports, 
media, and the arts to challenge elected officials and will support research to generate new 
evidence on implementating best practice. We expect the observatory to report annually 
and liaise with regional stakeholders for adapted versions of the report to allow local and 
interregional action on migration and health.

Key messages

We call on nation states, multilateral agencies, non-governmental 
organisations, and civil society to positively and effectively address the 
health of migrants by improving leadership and accountability. First, we 
urge the UN to appoint a Special Envoy on Migration and Health and 
national governments to have a country-level focal point for migration and 
health. This would enable much needed coordination and also ensure that 
migrants are included in all decisions about their health. Second, we propose 
that a Global Migration and Health Observatory is established to develop 
evidence-based migration and health indicators to ensure better reporting, 
monitoring, transparency, and accountability on the implementation of the 
Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees.

International and regional bodies and states should re-balance policy 
making in migration to give greater prominence to health by inviting 
health representatives to high level policy making forums on migration. 
Health leaders and practitioners should fully engage in dialogues on the 
macroeconomic forces that affect population mobility and participate in 
multisector budgeting and programme planning for migrants.

Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero tolerance approach. 
Public leaders and elected officials have a political, social, and legal 
responsibility to oppose xenophobia and racism that fuels prejudice and 
exclusion of migrant populations. Health professionals’ and organisations’ 
awareness of racism and prejudice should be strengthened through regulatory 
and training bodies including accreditation, educational courses, and 
continuous professional development. Civil society organisations should hold 
leaders to account to ensure the implementation of these obligations.

Universal and equitable access to health services and to all determinants 
of the highest attainable standard of health within the scope of universal 
health coverage needs to be provided by governments to migrant populations, 
regardless of age, gender, or legal status. Solutions should include input from 
migrants and be specific to the diverse migrant populations. For those exposed 
to disaster or conflict, or both, mobility models and Disaster Risk Reduction 
systems should be integrated. Targeted interventions to improve the rights 
of migrant workers, their knowledge of workplace health and safety, and 
entitlement to health care are needed.

Panel 1

Projection for internal migrant numbers for Bangladesh by 2050

The 2050 projection for internal migrants in Bangladesh was driven by 
hydrometeorological hazard risks under certain assumptions of social and political 
developments. Three different scenarios based on the combination of two development 
pathways and two climate trajectories were modelled by the World Bank.78 The 
modelling included three environmental variables: water stress, crop failure, and sea 
level rise, with a gravity model based on distance and attractiveness of the destination 
compared with the source area. The report defines climate migrants as people who have 
moved from their place of origin for at least 10 years and travelled over 14 kilometres 
within country because of climate change. The report aims to present a plausible range of 
outcomes rather than precise forecasts. The projection is based on a single model but has 
positive aspects such as the inclusion of socioeconomic factors, the choice of slow onset 
climate change variables, the use of whole globe decadal changes, and that downscaling 
can easily be achieved. The modelling was calibrated by the highest resolution population 
census data available at that time. The World Bank report projects that by 2050 there will 
be 13·3 million climate migrants in Bangladesh based on a pessimistic-realistic reference 
scenario with high emissions and unequal development.

To test the World Bank projection, the 2011 population and housing census data 
were collected from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. This database was prepared 
from household surveying in Bangladesh with a questionnaire that covered the 
respondents’ household characteristics, demography, migration details, and economic 
activities among others. 50 districts of 64 in Bangladesh were identified as vulnerable to 
hydrometeorological hazard risks: flooding and river erosion (23 districts); cyclones and 
storm surges (19 districts); and drought and groundwater depletion (8 districts). Some 
districts are affected by multiple hazards. Subsequently, the total number of life-time 
(greater than 10 years) and inter-district migrants (travelled more than 14 kilometres 
away) was identified in each district. The migrants constitute about 9%, 12%, and 5% of 
district-wise total population categorised according to flooding and river erosion, cyclone 
and storm surge, and drought and groundwater depletion as reasons to migrate. They 
were then filtered by selecting only people migrating from rural areas, on the basis of 
an assumption that the adaptive capacity to climate change is lower in rural communities 
in Bangladesh because of a lack of development and poverty. They constitute about 8%, 
11%, and 4% respectively. After applying these filters, it is possible to assess the number 
of internal migrants attributed to hydrometeorological hazard risks in Bangladesh and 
whether this figure is compatible with the local context. This assessment is made by 
analysing primary data collected through actual field surveying under the supervision of 
the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

4·07 million internal migrants were identified for the period of 2001–11, migrating 
because of these hydrometeorological hazard risks. They represented about 4% of the 
country’s total population and 41% of the total migrant population of flooding hit 
districts, 42% of the total migrant population of cyclone hit districts, and 31% of the 
total migrant population of drought hit districts. By considering Bangladesh’s population

growth rate (varying between 0·22–1·00%) and a similar scenario (without new climatic 
and development interventions) up to 2050, it can be estimated that the total number 
of internal migrants attributed to hydrometeorological hazard risks will be 19·4 million, 
which will surpass the World Bank projection of 13·3 million internal climate migrants 
by 2050. However, it cannot be confirmed that these hydrometeorological hazard risks 
(eg, river erosion and groundwater depletion), and their frequency and intensity are 
attributed to climate change.77 While our analysis of primary data suggests that a greater 
number of people will potentially be affected than the World Bank report projects, it does 
not validate their projections for internal climate migrants.

Gender, law, and health: a four-country analysis

Rape, sexual servitude, child marriage, and sex trafficking lead to substantial risks 
of transmitted infections, poor maternal health outcomes, and enduring mental health 
problems. However, access to protections, medical treatment, and legal recourse, 
especially for women, are often dictated and constrained by laws and customs. An 
in-depth legal analysis of four countries in which migrants form a substantial portion 
of the population, Chad (519 968 total migrants), Jordan (3 112 026 total migrants), 
and especially in Lebanon (1 997 776 total migrants) and Turkey (2 964 916 total 
migrants), shows the highly gendered, and sometimes contradictory, nature of the laws 
and customs governing the rights and safety of women and girls (see supplementary table 
6 in appendix). Among Syrian refugee communities, for example, rates of child marriage 
are high.167 Although many countries have established a legal minimum age of marriage, 
the practice of early and forced marriage prevails because of weak law enforcement, 
cumbersome marriage registration laws, and cultural norms. In Jordan, for example, the 
legal age of marriage is 18 years, yet children can be married with the approval of a 
Sharia court judge from age 15.168 Although Chad criminalises child marriage under the 
age of 18 years, the child marriage rate was 68% between 2004 and 2017.

Although countries might sign conventions and draft legislation against gender-based 
violence, migrant women are often unable to access justice because of cultural norms, 
language barriers, and poor legal representation. Countries often have plural legal 
systems that provide complete defences or reduced sentences for honour crimes. In 
Chad, for example, adultery is a criminal offence and murders committed because 
of adulterous behaviour are considered excusable. Women inhabiting migrant camps 
have faced months-long detentions on the grounds of adultery, while men rarely face 
punishment for rape and sexual assault.169 In both Jordan and Lebanon, perpetrators can 
avoid prosecution by marrying their victims170 as marital rape is not a crime in many host 
countries.

For unmarried and displaced adolescent girls, failing health systems, few providers, 
and poor domestic legal frameworks are substantial barriers to reproductive health 
service access. Individuals under the age of 18 years must obtain parental consent 
before receiving or undergoing any sort of medical treatment,171 including receiving 
contraceptives, in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey; in Jordan, spousal consent is also 
required.172 Migrant women also have poor access to abortion in the four countries 
reviewed. In Chad, Jordan, and Lebanon abortion is not legal in cases of rape.

Globally, intimate partner violence affects one in three women,173 and displacement 
appears to exacerbate conditions of abuse,173,174 triggered by destabilisation of gender 
norms and roles, men’s substance use, women’s separation from family, and rapid 
remarriages and forced marriages. Laws are often insufficient to protect women from 
sexual abuse. For example, among the migrant-recipient countries analysed, only Turkey 
has legislation against marital rape and only Chad allows termination to save the 
life of the mother, even in cases of rape. Countries are often reluctant to make

Page 72

commitments to protect women. Only Chad has signed and ratified without reservations 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women147 
and its accompanying Optional Protocols. Although international instruments such as 
these and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child120 exist to protect women and 
children, implementation is often poor, especially during humanitarian crises. Dismantled 
or ineffective justice systems result in weak protections and responses for sexual and 
gender-based violence.175 Additionally, even when laws are in place, migrants who have 
a tenuous legal status or are not aware of their rights, are much less likely to benefit from 
health protections and medical treatment.

Health care for migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the USA: improving 
access and cultural competence

A high proportion of migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the USA are uninsured 
or underinsured, due to both eligibility issues and very low incomes. It is estimated 
that at least 75% of farmworkers, and up to 90% of their children do not have health 
insurance.194 Many of these individuals do not qualify for government provided or 
subsidised insurance (eg, Medicaid) because they are undocumented.

There are positive examples of programmes that have been established to address the 
health needs of these populations. At a national level, the Health Resources and Services 
Administration funds 137 migrant health centres and 955 community health centres 
across the USA aimed at improving access to services for marginalised groups such 
as farm workers. This assistance includes a voucher programme enabling farmworkers 
to obtain care from community centres, and funding non-profit organisations such as 
Migrant Health Promotion, and Farmworker Health Services.194 However, a substantial 
gap in the literature exists in terms of robust assessments of the effectiveness or 
acceptability of such programmes. There are also numerous local programmes in the 
USA focused on accessible, culturally appropriate health assessments. Mobile outreach 
clinics for migrants exist for uninsured farmworkers who are considered to be working 
in a hazardous industry and are mostly foreign migrants. There are also clinics targeting 
farmworkers in the USA,195 and the Migrant Health Outreach programme (federally 
funded) mobile clinic for farmworkers staffed by nurses, which seems to be a successful 
approach.196 Outreach services offer the benefit of going to the locations where migrants 
are working, living, going to school, or to houses of worship,197 reducing many of the 
main access barriers. In the USA, for example, an estimated 1500 mobile clinics exist, 
receiving 5 million or more annual visits nationwide, which are becoming an integral 
component of the health-care system to serve vulnerable populations. Findings from a 
study on outreach to migrants and seasonal farmworkers in the USA shows that workers 
and their families make very restricted use of clinic-based services because of their 
mobility (constant residential changes), work hours, and poor knowledge of the US 
health system (almost 40% of the population is new each year). A majority prefer to seek 
care in Mexico, even individuals who have US health insurance; however, clinic outreach 
programmes are overcoming many of these barriers. Nevertheless, research suggests that 
mobile clinics for migrants have been more often disease-focused, to offer testing and 
treatment (eg, for HIV, especially for sex worker populations).197,198 Evening cluster 
clinics targeting migrant workers were considered by migrants themselves to be excellent 
or good.199 Six characteristics were believed to contribute to the successful delivery of 
health care and education through cluster clinics, including provision of both direct and 
referral services for this underserved population, comprehensive delivery of services in 
a single setting, collaborative delivery of services, access-driven delivery of services, 
delivery of culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate services, and evidence-based

targeting migrant workers are relatively rare.

Panel 4

Leadership in migrant population accessibility and affordability of health-
care services

China

Since the launch of the new round of medical reform in 2009, China has almost achieved 
full coverage of its medical insurance system for urban and rural residents, with a stable 
coverage rate of above 95% for the whole population. The medical insurance system 
mainly consists of three types of schemes, including urban employee basic medical 
insurance, urban resident basic medical insurance, and the new rural cooperative medical 
scheme. Among these, the number of people participating in the new rural cooperative 
medical scheme reached 670 million, with a coverage rate of 98·8%. However, despite 
the high coverage rate achieved, there is a definite difference among the coverage scope 
of the three medical insurance schemes, with a higher insurance level provided by urban 
employee basic medical insurance and urban resident basic medical insurance than by the 
new rural cooperative medical scheme. In addition, because the off-site medical expense 
settlement information system for new rural cooperative medical scheme has not been 
fully established, medical expenses of migrant populations cannot be directly deducted 
when they seek medical care in urban areas. Many migrants have to pay medical 
expenses first out of pocket then return to rural areas for reimbursement. Besides, the 
reimbursement review procedures are quite cumbersome and usually take a long time, 
resulting in a considerable number of migrants being without definite insurance security.

Faced with the demand of nearly 200 million migrants, in 2016, the Chinese Government 
distributed a relevant document on off-site medical expense settlement under basic 
medical insurance schemes. This document clarified the responsibility of all levels of 
government in ensuring the migrant population’s right to medical insurance and defined 
the unified management requirements for locations providing medical treatment. At the 
same time, the off-site medical expense settlement information system was established 
and improved. With distribution of social security cards, the migrant population can 
equally enjoy the convenient services of medical expense settlement across provinces. 
Through these policies and measures, the accessibility and affordability of health-care 
services for the migrant population have been greatly enhanced. Meanwhile, to promote 
the health of migrant workers working outside, the National Health and Family Planning 
Commission in migrant-sending areas also established a health education group on 
WeChat (a Chinese social media app), sending them health education messages and 
keeping track of their health status for better health management.

Switzerland

According to Peter Saladin, "similar to all other areas of corporate governance, diversity 
policies need assertiveness by the highest management level".203 The economist and 
former president of the H+ Swiss Hospital Association headed the Swiss Migrant-
Friendly-Hospitals-project implemented in 2003–07, as part of the confederation’s 
strategy on migration and public health.204 According to the 2015 report of the Migration 
Integration Policy Index Health Strand, an international comparative study on health

systems’ responsiveness to immigrants needs, the endeavour was successful. Switzerland 
scored second out of 38 nations, and has established a world-leading migration and health 
programme.205

On the political level, Switzerland chose to turn health into a priority area of its 
integration policy. Legal entitlements and access to coverage within the insurance based 
Swiss health-care system is nearly identical for nationals, legal migrants, asylum seekers, 
and undocumented migrants. Health-care providers are informed by the Federal Health 
Office or non-governmental organisations (eg, the Swiss Red Cross) about immigrant’s 
entitlements to health care and migrant patients are provided access to relevant health 
information in multiple languages.205 Data collection and funding for relevant migrant 
health data is well developed, as is training of health professionals in transcultural 
competencies. The actual adaptation and responsiveness of health services, however, 
varies between regions (cantons) and institutions. The implementation of federal policies 
and provisions depend on political and institutional structures, priorities, and leadership 
on the regional and local level. Interpreters and cultural mediators, for example, are 
available only at some health centres, mainly large and university hospitals. As costs 
are charged on hospital budgets, a negative incentive for use of interpreting services still 
exists. Specific services and support for undocumented migrants are also only available 
in a small number of cantons, and political and administrative barriers to the actual 
realisation of formally granted rights are still prevalent.

Inappropriate health data sharing for immigration enforcement in the UK

On Jan 1, 2017, an MOU between the UK Home Office and NHS Digital was signed.211 
The MOU formalised existing processes and data sharing that had occurred between 
NHS Digital and the Home Office.212 The MOU described how any data shared had to 
comply with the legal obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights 
Act 1998, and the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Requests were used by the Home 
Office to track down migrants for the purposes of immigration enforcement.

On publication, the MOU generated substantial media interest, particularly as it became 
apparent that there had been an increasing use of these requests since 2010. The report 
led to a request for clarification about the issue from the Health Select committee, 
which received several responses from NHS Digital, the Home Office, the National Data 
Guardian, Public Health England, and the UK General Medical Council.212 In their 
responses, NHS Digital and the Department of Health outlined the basis by which the 
MOU had been written and the impact and equity considerations that had been reviewed. 
NHS Digital confirmed that no privacy impact statement had been undertaken, but that 
instead a public interest test was done in each individual tracing request.

In their response to the Health Select committee, Public Health England stated they 
were unable to find statistical evidence about the effect of knowledge of data sharing 
on deterring immigrants from accessing health-care treatment and agreed to undertake 
a full review within 2 years. However, in their testimony, Public Health England 
experts working in the field of communicable diseases stated that “sharing of personal 
information by NHS commissioners or healthcare providers, which has been provided to 
them by patients on an understanding of absolute confidentiality, with other government 
departments, law enforcement agencies or immigration enforcement authorities risks 
undermining public confidence in the public health system and could have unintended 
and serious consequences affecting the health of individuals and the risk to the public 
health of the wider community”.

The General Medical Council, the governing body for UK doctors, only permits 
clinicians to share patient information “if failure to disclose may expose others to a 
risk of death or serious harm“. Suspected immigration offences do not fall under this 
category. In the General Medical Council’s response to the committee, they stated that, 
“the memorandum of understanding sets out clearly the public interest in maintaining 
effective immigration controls. It does not however reflect the public interest in there 
being a confidential health system, or consider how those two public goods should be 
weighed against each other”.

The National Data Guardian, Dame Fiona Caldicott, also expressed her concerns about 
this issue stating, “any perception by the public that confidential data collected by 
the NHS is shared for a purpose that they had not anticipated or without appropriate 
controls may well lead to a loss of people’s trust" and that "trust would have been better 
maintained had there been more public debate about where the balance should be struck 
between the public interest in maintaining an effective immigration service and the public

interest in a confidential health service before an agreement was made between NHS 
Digital, the Home Office, and the Department of Health. This would have allowed more 
scrutiny of the reasoning and factors which led to the policy position which has been 
taken”.

During a parliamentary debate in May, 2018, about new data protection regulations, a 
member of the UK parliament Conservative party and chair of Health Select committee, 
Dr Sarah Wollaston, tabled an amendment to end the data sharing arrangement between 
NHS Digital and the Home Office. During the debate, the Government announced a 
reversal of policy and accepted Dr Wollaston’s amendment, which substantially narrowed 
the scope of the MOU in order that it only covered sharing in cases in which a person was 
suspected of serious criminality.

Internal migration and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa

Our analysis of all-cause mortality in 25 Health and Demographic Surveillance System 
sites in sub-Saharan Africa uses data representing a mix of rural and urban settlement 
types, from the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations 
and Their Health (INDEPTH) iShare platform.225 The datasets include individual level 
information on all movements into or out of a surveillance area for durations of more 
than 6 months. From these data, we can identify in-migrants (new residents) and return-
migrants (former residents returning) to an area. After 5 years of residence, a migrant is 
considered a permanent resident, as previous analyses of the effect of duration following 
migration show that the mortality of migrants converges with that of permanent residents 
(non-migrants) after this length of time.226 For each migration category (non-migrant, in-
migrant, return-migrant), premature mortality is estimated by the probability of mortality 
before 60 years of age if a person is alive at 15 years of age (45q15). The percentage 
difference in 45q15 between migrants and non-migrants was estimated by sex for each of 
the 25 Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites from the year 2000.

The analysis reveals that in sub-Saharan Africa, the distribution of the difference in 
premature adult mortality between migrants and non-migrants is substantial (ie, in half 
of the sites migrant mortality was 50% higher than non-migrant mortality). Differences 
in adult health probabilities (45q15) by migrant status in 25 sub-Saharan Africa Health 
and Demographic Surveillance Systems are presented in supplementary appendix figure 
7. These analyses indicate that in half the sites, migrant mortality was 50% higher than 
non-migrant mortality.

These results suggest that internal migrants in the sub-Saharan Africa subdistricts have a 
health disadvantage relative to the resident, non-migrant population. A study of internal 
migration and AIDS, tuberculosis, and non-communicable disease mortality in four 
Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites in Kenya and South Africa affirmed 
these findings. In the Agincourt study population in rural South Africa, in-migrants 
and, even more so, return-migrants had a health disadvantage in terms of mortality 
risk attributed to both non-communicable and infectious disease.227,228 These findings 
suggest that relative to non-migrant mortality, the experience of migrants is demonstrably 
worse in many sub-Saharan settings, with poor access to health care a probable 
determinant along with poor social integration or inadequate living conditions. Further 
research into the circumstances at migrant destinations is a priority going forward.

The same method was used to examine child mortality (the probability of death in 
under 5 year olds) by migrant status, in which child migration status was considered 
independently of the migration status of their parents (see supplementary figure 8 in the 
appendix). The results present a striking contrast to that found in adults. Both in-migrant 
and return-migrant children of both sexes have lower all-cause mortality on average than 
non-migrant children. These results present an important direction for further research

outcomes for adults and children.

Panel 7

Age assessment, an unresolved challenge for unaccompanied minors and 
refugee children

Although migration to Norway is not a new phenomenon, the number of refugees that 
came to Norway in 2015 was unprecedented. Over 30 000 sought asylum, of which 5000 
were unaccompanied minors. This latter group is at increased risk of child trafficking, 
abuse, and violence, and requires guardianship and protection. However, instead of 
focusing on their rights and obligations to this group of children and adolescents, 
regrettably governments often seek to avoid these obligations.

Age determination has been a substantial challenge and source of debate among child 
rights groups and immigration officials. Though universally agreed definitions of a 
child exist, there are no agreed methods regarding the assessment to determine the 
age of a child. Unaccompanied minors often have no reliable information about their 
age or date of birth. Authorities deploy techniques and investigations that are, at best, 
approximations.246 The consequences of these approximations can be devastating for this 
group of children. In Norway, if the age assessment shows that someone is less than 18 
years of age, they will be cared for by the Norwegian Child Welfare Services. The Child 
Welfare Services statutory obligation is "to ensure that children and youth who live in 
conditions that may be detrimental to their health and development receive the necessary 
assistance and care at the right time". In addition, non-resident minors are entitled to 
receive the same help from these services as any other Norwegian child. By contrast, if 
the assessments conclude that a person is over 18 years old, they will be treated as an 
ordinary adult asylum seeker, with few such rights.

Thus, unsurprisingly, the techniques to determine the age of a child are controversial. In 
Norway, the measurement of age by x-rays of the hand (bone age) and teeth are routinely 
used, despite long-standing dispute about these techniques. The x-rays assess ossification 
and presence of molar teeth and can be used to estimate age. However, they are not an 
accurate method and unnecessarily expose the adolescent to radiation. In response to the 
gravity of concerns expressed by the Norwegian Medical Association in the context of 
importance of these procedures, the responsibility for conducting these was transferred 
from the private sector to the Oslo University Hospital from January, 2017.

Age assessments, when necessary, should integrate clinical history and physical 
assessment, taking into account the person’s development (physical, cognitive, and 
emotional). A report on age assessments247 concluded that "there is evidence that 
radiography (x-rays) of bones and teeth, which is increasingly relied upon by 
immigration authorities, is imprecise, unethical and potentially unlawful, and should 
not be used for age assessment". Despite this report, x-rays are perpetuated as the gold 
standard. As this method of age assessment jeopardises the current and future situation 
of unaccompanied minors, many have no alternative but to resort to other even more 
dangerous choices of living. This might include living as undocumented minors on 
the streets of other European cities, exposing and endangering them to further perils. 
Moreover, substantial evidence suggests that even individuals over the legal age for

Panel 8

Case study: labour trafficked migrants, mental health, and financial 
security

A study among male, female, and child trafficking survivors in the Greater 
Mekong Subregion found that 48% encountered physical or sexual violence, 43% 
reported symptoms of depression, and 40% reported post-traumatic stress disorder.276 
Employment is closely associated with mental health, with job insecurity and financial 
insecurity closely linked to anxiety and depression. Most data for employment and 
health come from high-income settings and studies on higher wage jobs, with very 
little research on migrant workers in low-income and middle-income countries. The 
study on trafficking, exploitation, and abuse in the Mekong276 documented forms of 
labour exploitation and health outcomes among men, women, and children using post-
trafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. High rates of symptoms of 
depression and anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation 
were found. These symptoms were associated with sexual and physical violence and 
threats during trafficking, poor living and working conditions, excessive overtime, and 
restricted freedom.

Being deprived of wages was also a major stressor for formerly trafficked people, many 
of whom felt guilt and shame from failing to fulfil income expectations. In the Study on 
Trafficking, Exploitation and Abuse in the Greater Mekong Subregion (STEAM), most 
trafficked migrants (62%) reported being cheated of their wages. Among the few who 
were paid for their work, domestic workers (US$0·40), agricultural workers ($0·70), 
and fish industry workers ($1·10) received the lowest daily wages. Unsurprisingly, 
domestic workers (76%) and fish industry workers (71%) more frequently expressed 
financial concerns. The majority (82%) of domestic workers reported depression, anxiety, 
or post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (or combinations of the three), similar to 
individuals trafficked for construction work (79%). Individuals who had been cheated 
over their wages or had financial concerns were approximately 1·5 times more likely to 
be symptomatic of a mental health disorder.

Studies often overlook the significance of income security to a migrant’s psychological 
wellbeing because research on migrants’ mental health frequently focuses primarily on 
past events versus current stressors. Especially for those who migrated to improve their 
family’s economic circumstances and were unsuccessful, mental health support will need 
to include job training and placement or small business grants. Moreover, for migrants 
who have been exploited, cheated of their wages, or injured on the job, legal aid should 
be provided to help with wage recovery and compensation for abuses, and injuries, 
including long-term disability support.

Panel 9

Research recommendations and priority research questions

To address the health needs of migrants, high quality data collection for migration 
and health should:

•

•

•

•

Add migration related questions to regularly administered surveys such 
as Demographic and Health Surveys, health and population surveillance 
systems, and censuses

Examine the multiple interactions between migrant populations and between 
migrant and non-migrant groups

Include health outcomes of migrants that are more closely aligned with 
the drivers of migration and the geographical region of origin of migrants, 
internal migrants, and the interaction with aging to better understand health 
needs

In addition to comparisons with the host population, conduct research 
that makes comparisons with the population at origin to ascertain the 
consequences of migration on health, ideally with use of longitudinal data 
collection methods

To provide an evidence base for health-related drivers and outcomes of migration, 
it is essential to focus on the processes and implementation of migration and health 
research through:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Engagement with the population using participatory approaches to ensure that 
migration and health research meets their needs and does not result in harm

Undertaking research that responds to the population need, including through 
increased focus on the health effects across the lifecycle and genders

Analysis of best treatment regimens and modifications to these treatments 
required by mobile populations

Implementing evidence-based health interventions, with a focus on data 
collection, assessment of cost-effectiveness, and analysis of intervention 
impact and effectiveness

Increasing the evidence base describing the consequences of discrimination 
against migrants and racism, and ways to prevent this

Considering the health of migrant groups in all areas of research

To provide and use better data to reduce inequities, changes in the migrant health 
research process and methods are needed, through:

•

Use of globally accepted definitions to guide similar data collection and 
disaggregation, with a recognition that the categories used in human mobility 
and health are not static but fluid

•

•

Viewing the migrant population themselves as an asset and encouraging a 
participatory approach, in which migrants and local communities are included 
in research prioritisation, policy making, and the decision process

Including qualitative, adaptive, and context sensitive approaches to 
understand sociocultural factors of migration, the barriers to health care, and 
how the determinants of health might affect migrants differently

To provide evidence for health policy and systems research, the following questions 
should be considered:

•

•

•

•

What financing models are most effective in extending access equitably to 
migrants?

How can prevailing jurisdiction based health governance and citizen 
participation approaches be made more sensitive to the needs of migrants?

How can health-care providers be equipped with the necessary multicultural 
competencies for migrant care?

How can information systems be made more portable and interoperable while 
still preserving patient rights and privacy?

To produce ethical research, there should be incorporation of ethics, data 
protection, monitoring, and evaluation into all stages of the research process. The 
following questions should be considered:

•

•

•

•

Does the research meet the needs and priorities of the research population, 
and goals like equity, integration, health protection, and universal health 
coverage?

When defining the sample and the distinguishing categories of migrants, what 
are the sources of information that these definitions rely on and how do these 
categories resonate with the individual’s self-perception?

Does the research deal with the challenge to understand social boundaries by 
providing scientific evidence of differences between and homogeneity within 
social groups and populations?

To what extent does the research reflect social, structural, and political 
determinants of health and their implications on social gradients, historical 
power relations, and probably stigma?

To provide adequate funding and appropriate research, health funders should:

•

•

•

Make migration and health a priority research area

Ensure that funded research always endeavours to include migrants within it

Support capacity development among migration and health researchers and 
institutions in the Global South through specific funding initiatives and 
support of research networks

Panel 10

Recommendations

The Commission makes the following recommendations that aim to maximise the health 
of people on the move and societies more broadly. We call for urgent action to raise 
migration and health on the political agenda in an objective and humane manner, increase 
multi-stakeholder action, and create robust accountability and monitoring mechanisms.

1.

Dedicate political capital, financial, and human resources to fulfil global 
commitments to secure healthy migration and improve the security and 
wellbeing of mobile groups, especially the most marginalised.

•

•

•

•

•

States need to commit strong leadership to meet their commitments 
to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and fulfil the health 
objectives of the Global Compact for Migration, the Global Compact 
on Refugees, and other relevant global agreements. We advocate 
for clarity in leadership at the global level and for support to 
national actors (public health workforce and civil society). We 
urge the Secretary General of the UN to appoint a Special Envoy 
on Migration and Health, regional bodies to appoint a regional 
representative, and national governments to have country-level focal 
points for migration and health.

International and regional bodies need to use existing agreements, 
such as the Global Compacts and the WHO Action Plan, to prioritise 
the health, rights, and security of migrating populations. Decision 
makers should allocate sufficient funding to create equitable health 
protection mechanisms for mobile groups, such as joint health 
insurance or social safety net schemes, mutual health accords, and 
other mechanisms to integrate these groups into health systems.

Multilateral funding organisations should have clear mechanisms to 
include migrants into national and regional proposals. Ultimately the 
inclusion of migrants into existing health systems, within the scope 
of universal health coverage, should improve such systems to benefit 
nationals and migrants.

States and the international community should urgently develop 
policy links that recognise the integral connections between 
environmental conditions and anthropogenic climate change, 
migration, and health. Decision makers should join forces to predict 
and respond to the effects of climate change on population mobility. 
Investments are needed in sustainable health infrastructure models 
that respond to migrants’ health protection needs, including Disaster 
Risk Reduction mechanisms.

States should go beyond rhetoric to tackle modern slavery by 
recognising the exploitation of migrant workers, especially in

informal labour, and trafficking of individuals and families displaced 
by conflict, natural disasters, and environmental degradation.

2.

Re-balance policy making in migration, trade and environment, and 
foreign affairs to give greater prominence to health. Foster cross-sector, 
complementary decision making that integrates health considerations 
across policies and services that determine the health of migrants.

•

•

•

International and regional bodies and states should create a 
prominent place for health representatives at high level policy 
making forums for migration-related sectors (eg, immigration, trade, 
labour, environment, security, education). Health leaders should 
assert their rights to participate in these policy forums. Conversely, 
high level representatives from other sectors should be encouraged 
to participate in similar health policy making forums.

Health leaders and practitioners should fully engage in policy 
dialogues that affect migration, including the macroeconomic 
forces that affect population mobility. They should participate in 
multisector budgeting and programme planning for migrants.

Migrants and their advocates should have a voice in strategies that 
affect their health and safety.

3.

Confront urgently, vigorously, and persistently divisive myths and 
discriminatory rhetoric about migrants.

•

•

Political leaders and elected officials should resoundingly and 
consistently condemn misinformation and disinformation about 
migrants, especially xenophobia proffered by divisive and populist 
voices. Fact-checking, promoting truth, and vociferous objections 
should not be left to migrants and their advocates alone.

Governments, international agencies, and civil society should stay 
ahead of developments in social media and digital technology to 
shut down anti-migrant abuse and promote fact-based portrayals of 
global migration, particularly the widespread reliance on migrants 
for economic development, health services, educational institutions, 
and cultural richness.

4.

Advocate for and improve the rights of migrants to ensure safe and 
healthy educational and working conditions that includes freedom of 
movement with no arbitrary arrest.

•

States, regional bodies, and the international community should use 
policies, laws, and resources to improve the rights of migrants. 
States and businesses should ensure workplace health and safety 
measures, employment conditions, and implement inspections and 
monitoring tools targeted to protect migrant workers. Migrants 
should be assured easy-to-access, equitable health care and worker

compensation entitlements. Transparent reporting using an agreed 
upon framework should occur.

Policy makers should guarantee migrants’ rights and inclusion 
across sectors that affect the health of migrants, including workers, 
internally displaced people, asylum seekers, and refugees, and 
empower migrants to assert their rights to the underlying social, 
political, economic, and cultural determinants of physical and 
mental health.

Social and health sector leaders and educational institutions should 
offer training to promote cultural competency, cultural mediation, 
and migrant-sensitive services, including outreach programmes for 
hard-to-reach individuals and groups.

States should abolish arbitrary arrest and the detention of all 
migrants, especially children and adolescents. They should remove 
health restrictions on entry, stay, and residence and the deportation 
of individuals with specific health conditions. These measures 
should be codified in international agreements and included in 
national law.

5.

There is an urgent need to ensure adequate monitoring, evaluation, and 
research to support the implementation of the Global Compacts.

•

•

•

States, coordinating with the global community and relevant local 
professionals (eg, health, refugee services, labour, civil society), 
should put into place robust monitoring frameworks and independent 
reporting mechanisms to ensure accountability in the delivery 
of the Global Compact for Migration and Global Compact on 
Refugees. Strategies should include transparent and easy to compare 
monitoring frameworks and mechanisms to report how regions and 
countries are adhering to the policy principles and implementation 
components on migration and health.

The Commission, therefore, recommends that a Global Migration 
and Health Observatory is established to develop evidence-based 
indicators and measurement methods, and to ensure improved 
reporting, transparency, and accountability on the implementation 
of the Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on 
Refugees. The Observatory should also monitor the progressive 
inclusion of migrants within universal health coverage country plans 
and achievements.

Specific recommendations for research are outlined in greater detail 
in panel 9 and were reached through a consensus approach by 
Commissioners.

Low wage labour sectors and associated occupational hazards among migrant workers (see appendix for full 
list of references)

Table

Examples of occupational hazards and harm

Migrant health study findings

Sex work

Construction

Poor condom negotiation or use can cause sexually 
transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy; sexual 
violence and confinement can cause anxiety disorders and 
depression

Migrant female sex workers in Benin, Ethiopia, and 
Kenya are at greater risk of HIV than non-migrant sex 
workers and higher risk of acute sexually transmitted 
infections in all settings

Work at heights can cause fatal falls and disabilities; 
heavy lifting can cause musculoskeletal problems; poor 
personal protective equipment can cause respiratory disease, 
dermatitis, and eye injury

In the USA, Latino construction workers were nearly 
twice (1·84, 95% CI 1·60-2·10) as likely to die from 
occupational injuries as their non-Latino counterparts

Manufacturing 
(eg, textiles)

Repeated bending and fixed postures can cause 
musculoskeletal damage and pain; sharp instruments can 
cause puncture wounds; dust particles can cause silicosis

In Malaysia, 64% of migrant workers had 
musculoskeletal pain caused or worsened by work 
compared with 28% of Malaysian non-migrant 
manufacturing workers

Commercial 
fishing

Agriculture

Domestic work

Mining and 
quarrying

Forestry

Leather and 
tanning

Brick kilns

Environmental exposures (sun, cold, rain) can cause skin 
cancer, dehydration, frostbite; long hours and weeks with no 
break can cause exhaustion and pneumonia; unstable fishing 
vessels and inadequate life vests can cause drowning; fishing 
net and knife hazards can cause deep cuts and lost limbs

Survivors of trafficking working in the Thai fishing 
industry reported higher injury rates (47%) than non-
trafficked fish industry workers (21%); 54% of trafficked 
fish industry workers experienced severe violence versus 
10% of non-trafficked fish industry workers

Pesticide exposure can cause toxicity; environmental 
exposures (heat, cold, mosquitoes) can cause dehydration, 
kidney failure, headaches, and malaria; heavy lifting and 
bending can cause repetitive injury syndromes

In one greenhouse in Oman, 95% of workers were 
migrants; poor practices related to pesticide use resulted 
in numerous health problems, such as skin irritation 
(70%), headaches (39%), and vomiting (30%)

Physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, and social isolation can 
cause depression, anxiety, and suicide; extensive working 
hours and food deprivation can cause exhaustion; repeated 
lifting, bending, and reaching can cause musculoskeletal 
strain; chemical cleaning agents, cooking, ironing, and knives 
can cause skin damage and burns

Mercury extraction, lead exposure, and mineral dust can 
cause mercury poisoning (gold-mining), neurotoxic disorders, 
and pneumoconiosis; heavy lifting, falls, and falling rocks 
can cause fatalities, traumatic injuries, and disabilities; 
heavy equipment, long hours, and repetitive lifting can 
cause noise-induced hearing loss, long-term fatigue, and 
musculoskeletal injuries; remote locations can cause malaria 
and put individuals at risk of venomous snake bites

Environmental exposures (heat, cold, mosquitoes) can cause 
dehydration, malaria, and infection with parasites; falls, sharp 
tools, and machinery can cause fatalities, broken bones, and 
lacerations; repetitive motions and long hours can cause pain, 
strains, and long-term fatigue

Chemical exposure (ie, chromium, benzene dyes, 
formaldehyde) can cause respiratory illness, ocular damage, 
cancer, ulcers, toxicity, dermatological diseases (rashes), and 
chronic or allergic bronchitis pulmonary tuberculosis

A 2-year study in Kuwait found that hospital admission 
rates for domestic workers (93% from India, Philippines, 
and Sri Lanka) were 1·86 times higher than for Kuwaiti 
women (non-domestic worker control group); stress-
related disorders were more common (49% vs 22%) 
in housemaids (of whom a majority are migrants) than 
Kuwaiti women

China’s Ministry of Health reports that 87% 
of occupational disease is pneumoconiosis (black 
lung disease), with a mortality higher than 20%; 
pneumoconiosis is a chronic lung disease that often 
affects miners, sandblasters, and metal grinders, 
occupations undertaken primarily by internal migrant 
workers

A study of Burmese migrants found 87 (83%) of 105 
rubber plantation workers had a suspected case of malaria 
in the past year; workers had poor access to care because 
of their working hours and poor transportation

Higher morbidity rates were found in tannery workers 
(40%) than the control group (20%) in northern India

Unsanitary environments and air pollution can cause 
bronchitis, asthma, silicosis, and respiratory toxicity; very 
high heat can cause burns and fatalities; high rates of child 
labour resulting in developmental problems for those children

Migrant brick kiln workers in south India had higher 
prevalence of chest symptoms (9%) versus general 
population rates (5%) related to occupational hazards and 
poor health-care access
