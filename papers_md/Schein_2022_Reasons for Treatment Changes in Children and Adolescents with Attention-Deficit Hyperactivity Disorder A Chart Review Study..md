ABSTRACT

Introduction: This study aimed to examine the
reasons underlying treatment changes among
pediatric patients with attention-deﬁcit/hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD).
Methods: Data were obtained through online
medical chart abstraction (08/2021–09/2021).
Eligible patients with ADHD had initiated a
treatment regimen at ages 6–17 and within

1–5 years of chart abstraction. Reasons con-
tributing to treatment changes were analyzed
for a randomly selected treatment episode.
ADHD/treatment-related complication rate was
also described. Results were reported overall and
among children (ages 6–12) and adolescents
(ages 13–17), separately. Physicians’ perspective
on adherence among their child, adolescent,
and adult patients was assessed through an
online survey.
Results: A total of 156 physicians abstracted
434 patient charts (235 children ? 199 adoles-
cents). Mean patient age was 11.3 years, and
Inadequate/suboptimal
68.7% were male.

disturbances being the most common (9.7%).
Among patients with C 1 complication, 75.5%
reported the experience/fear of complications
had a negative impact on their
treatment
adherence. Results were similar among children
and adolescents. Physicians reported taking
actions toward patients’ non-adherence by fur-
ther educating patients, closer monitoring, and
changing the prescribed ADHD medication.
Conclusion: Lack of effectiveness and ADHD/
treatment-related complications are important
reasons for treatment changes among children
and adolescents with ADHD, highlighting the
need for more effective and tolerable treatments
to mitigate the burden of ADHD.

Key Summary Points

Why carry out this study?

Pediatric patients with attention-deﬁcit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been
shown to have frequent treatment
changes and poor adherence to ADHD
medications.

Limited information exists on the reasons
underlying different types of treatment
changes, the rate of complications
experienced by patients treated with
prescription ADHD medications and
physicians’ perspective on patients’
adherence to treatment.

Understanding the reasons behind
treatment changes among pediatric
patients and overall poor adherence
exhibited by patients with ADHD
(including child, adolescent, and adult
patients) may help identify potential
strategies to improve ADHD care.

What was learned from the study?

This panel-based chart review study found
that overall, the lack of effectiveness and
ADHD/treatment-related complications
are important reasons for treatment
changes among children and adolescents
with ADHD.

ADHD/treatment-related complications
are common, prompting many patients to
have treatment changes and suboptimal
adherence to their treatment; both factors
may lead to lower effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION

Attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is one of the most common neurodevelopmental
disorders of childhood, with an estimated
prevalence of 10.0% among children and 6.5%
among adolescents in the USA [1–3]. The man-
agement of ADHD often involves medications
(i.e., stimulants, non-stimulants) and/or non-
pharmacological approaches
(e.g., behavioral
parental and classroom training). Stimulants
remain the most common ﬁrst-line pharmaco-
logical treatment for school-aged patients with
ADHD owing to their efﬁcacy in reducing ADHD
core symptoms [3, 4].

Treatment outcomes in ADHD rely on sev-
eral factors, including the type of treatment
used as well as adherence and persistence to
treatment [5, 6]. However, previous studies have
shown poor adherence to ADHD medications
[7–9] and frequent treatment changes among
pediatric patients [10–12]. For instance, a recent
analysis on ADHD treatment pattern using US
claims data [13] found that approximately two-
thirds of children and adolescents experienced a
treatment change (including discontinuation,
switch, add-on, and drop) over a 12-month
period, suggesting the presence of an unmet
treatment need. Notably, the potential negative
consequences of frequent treatment changes
and poor adherence may have an impact on
multiple aspects of the children and adoles-
lives, such as poor academic perfor-
cents’
mances [14], impaired quality of life [15], and
increased ﬁnancial burden [13].

Knowledge on the reasons underlying treat-
ment changes among pediatric patients with
ADHD is necessary to delineate speciﬁc areas of
unmet need in patient care and help develop
strategies to minimize treatment changes and
improve adherence; this may in turn improve
symptom management and mitigate the burden
of ADHD. Although previous claims-based
studies have demonstrated frequent changes of
ADHD medications among children and ado-
lescents, the reasons for treatment changes were
not captured in these studies because of the lack
of clinical information in claims data. Addi-
tionally, previous studies have mostly focused

on discontinuation [7, 9]. Meanwhile, multiple
factors may affect patients’ overall treatment
satisfaction (e.g., inadequate symptom control
or experience of complications), which may
also have an impact on other treatment changes
and adherence. However, there is a paucity of
comprehensive reports on the reasons underly-
ing different types of treatment changes and the
rate of complications experienced by patients
treated with prescription ADHD medications in
the US [16]. Furthermore, limited information
exists on physicians’ perspective on patients’
adherence to treatment, which may be impor-
tant for understanding treatment decisions and
potential strategies to improve adherence.

To address the abovementioned knowledge
gaps, this study aimed to identify reasons for
treatment changes in pediatric patients with
ADHD in the US, assess the proportion of

METHODS

Study Design and Data Source

This was a retrospective panel-based chart re-
view study of pediatric patients (children [ages
6–12] and adolescents
[ages 13–17]) with
ADHD. Online medical chart abstraction was
completed by the treating physicians from
August 27, 2021,
to September 16, 2021.
Physicians were recruited from the panel of M3
Global Research, one of the largest panels of
healthcare providers in the US that is represen-
tative of the American Medical Association
Masterﬁle. An invitation was sent to the panel
of physicians who treat patients with ADHD.
Eligible physicians who were willing to partici-
pate in the study provided their written
informed consent. Physicians were then asked
to provide clinical information on 1–3 patients
with ADHD. The physicians ﬁlled in the infor-
mation of their randomly selected pediatric

5490

Adv Ther (2022) 39:5487–5503

patients corresponding to a randomly selected
treatment regimen initiated between 1 and
5 years prior to the date of chart abstraction via
an electronic case report form designed speciﬁ-
cally for this study. To reduce potential selec-
tion bias, physicians were asked to compile a list
of eligible patients and enter information for all
ADHD treatments received in the previous 1 to
5 years for an individual patient whose last
name began with a letter randomly generated
by the survey. The survey then randomly
selected one ADHD treatment regimen from
among the treatment regimens entered for each
selected patient. A randomly selected treatment
regimen spanned from initiation of the treat-
ment regimen until the earliest of treatment
discontinuation, treatment add-on, treatment
switch (i.e., switching C 1 agent in combina-
tion therapy), death, or the date of chart ab-
straction. The index date was the date of the
initiation of the randomly selected treatment
episode.

Participating physicians were also asked to
complete an online survey on their general
perspectives on adherence to ADHD treatment
for their child, adolescent, and adult patients.
This study was conducted in accordance with
the applicable ethical regulations; it was exempt
from full review and approved through an
expedited review by the Western Copernicus
Group Institutional Review Board (work order:
1-1458776-1). Participating physicians were
compensated for completing the study.

Study Population

Physicians meeting the following eligibility
criteria were included in the study: (1) practice
medicine in the US; (2) prescribed treatment
to C 1 child or adolescent patient with ADHD;
to patient medical charts,
(3) had access
including information on ADHD treatment,
reasons for treatment changes, and ADHD/
treatment-related complications.

Patients meeting the following eligibility
criteria were included in the study: (1) aged
6–17 years inclusively at the index date; (2) had
a diagnosis of ADHD prior to the index treat-
(3) had C 1 medical visit
in the
ment;
12 months prior to data collection; (4) initiated
an ADHD treatment between 1 and 5 years prior
to data collection.

Study Measures and Outcomes

(e.g.,

Physician demographics and practice charac-
teristics (e.g., specialty, practice setting, practice
size) were collected. Patient characteristics,
including demographic (e.g., age, gender) and
type and severity of ADHD,
clinical
comorbidities) variables were also collected.
Information on the index treatment, including
the type of treatment (e.g., stimulants, non-
stimulants, combination therapy [i.e., multiple
stimulants, multiple non-stimulants, or combi-
nation of
stimulants and non-stimulants]),
duration of treatment, adherence to planned
schedule, and concomitant medications, were
summarized.

Treatment changes and modiﬁcations related
to the index treatment episode were assessed. Key
treatment changes at the end of index treatment
included treatment discontinuation, add-on, or
switch. Data collected included reasons for
treatment change, duration of treatment, and
ADHD/treatment-related complications
that
contributed to the end of treatment episode.
Data were also collected for treatment modiﬁca-
tions,
including treatment interruption/drug
holiday and dose increase or decrease that
occurred during the index treatment but did not
constitute the end of the selected treatment epi-
sode. The reasons for treatment modiﬁcations
and ADHD/treatment-related complications
that occurred during the treatment were descri-
bed. Additionally, the degree of negative impact
of ADHD/treatment-related complications or
fear of potentially experiencing ADHD/treat-

Adv Ther (2022) 39:5487–5503

ment-related complications on patients’ adher-
ence to ADHD treatment as well as the reasons for
continuing treatment despite the presence of
ADHD/treatment-related complications were
described.

Data on physicians’ perspective on adher-
ence among child, adolescent, and adult
patients and physician strategies to manage
non-adherent patients collected through the
online survey were summarized.

RESULTS

Sample Size

A total of 156 physicians abstracted 434 patient
charts, including 235 for child patients and 199
for adolescent patients with ADHD. The average
number of charts abstracted per physician was
2.8.

Physician Characteristics

The characteristics of participating physicians
are presented in Table 1. Most physicians were
psychiatrists (62.8%), followed by pediatricians
(20.5%) and family medicine practitioners
(16.0%); 84.6% of physicians were in practice
for [ 5 years; 75.6% practiced in private or
community settings, and 56.4% of the physi-
cians practiced in a suburban setting. Physicians
from across all US census regions were included.

Patient Characteristics

The characteristics of patients in the overall
sample are presented in Table 2. The mean
patient age was 11.3 years; 68.7% were male,
71.4% were White Caucasian, and 15.9% were
Black or African American. Regarding insurance
coverage, 70.3% had commercial insurance and
21.9% were Medicaid beneﬁciaries. Patients
were from across all US census regions. The
most common type of ADHD recorded was
combined presentation (56.2%), followed by

Adv Ther (2022) 39:5487–5503

and emotional

inattentive type (32.5%) and hyperactive type
(10.6%); 86.4% of patients had moderate or
severe ADHD. The most frequently recorded
ADHD-associated comorbidities were anxiety
(19.1%), depression (12.2%), learning disability
(12.2%),
impulsivity/mood
lability (12.0%). Notably, in the child and ado-
lescent subgroups, some differences in the fre-
quencies of ADHD-associated comorbidities at
baseline were observed. For example, the pro-
portion of patients with recorded anxiety or
depression was higher among adolescents than
among children (Supplementary Table S1).

Prior to the index treatment, 48.2% of patients
in the overall sample had received pharmaco-
logical therapy and 77.0% had received non-
pharmacological therapy. For the index treat-
ment, the majority of patients (83.2%) received
stimulants alone, followed by non-stimulants
alone (11.3%) and combination therapy (5.1%)
(Table 3). The average duration of the index
treatment was 23.3 months. The majority
(94.9%) of patients were prescribed to take their
index medication on a regular schedule, yet
48.3% of these patients had \ 80% adherence
to their pre-deﬁned treatment schedule, as
documented in their medical chart completed
by the treating physician. At index treatment
initiation, 28.8% of patients were also receiv-
ing C 1 other prescribed medication; common
medications received included antidepressants
(12.4%), antianxiety medications (8.8%), and
sleep aids (excluding over-the-counter; 6.7%).

Reasons for Treatment Changes
and Modiﬁcations

Among patients in the overall sample who dis-
continued index treatment at
the time of
chart abstraction (N = 83), the average time to
discontinuation was 13.8 months. The most
common reasons for treatment discontinuation
were inadequate/suboptimal management of
symptoms (60.2%), patient attitude/dislike of
the medication (30.1%), and the presence of
ADHD/treatment-related complications (25.3%;

Among patients who initiated on combina-
tion therapy and later had a treatment switch
(N = 4), the average time to the switch was
8.2 months. The most common reason for
treatment switch was parent/family attitude/
dislike of the medication (75.0%).

Additionally,

some patients experienced
treatment modiﬁcations that did not lead to a
treatment change. Among patients with treat-
ment interruption/drug holiday (N = 67), the
majority (80.6%) reported having treatment
interruptions/drug holidays sometimes or fre-
quently, mostly driven by not taking medica-
tion during
and/or
holidays from school or work (71.6%; Fig. 1b).
Meanwhile, the most common reason for a dose
increase was inadequate/suboptimal manage-
ment of symptoms (189 of 237 patients [79.7%];
Fig. 1c) and that for a dose decrease was pres-
ence of ADHD/treatment-related complications
(12 of 30 patients [40.0%]; Fig. 1d).

The reasons

treatment changes and
modiﬁcations were generally similar among the
child and adolescent subgroups (Supplementary
Table S2).

ADHD/Treatment-Related Complications
During Index Treatment and Impact
on Adherence

Overall, 42.4% of patients experienced C 1
ADHD/treatment-related complication (Fig. 2a).
The most common ADHD/treatment-related
complications were insomnia and other sleep
disturbances (9.7%), decreased appetite/weight
loss (9.4%), and anorexia (9.2%). Among patients
with C 1 ADHD/treatment-related complication
(n = 184), 75.5% reported the experience or fear
of ADHD/treatment-related complications had a
negative impact on their adherence to treatment
(Fig. 2b), and 66.8% remained on treatment
despite experiencing complications. The most
commonly reported reasons for remaining on
treatment included that the ADHD/treatment-
related complications were tolerable (60.2%),
patient or family preference (33.3%), other
available treatment options were not as effective
to manage ADHD symptoms (25.2%), and other
available treatment options would also be

associated with ADHD/treatment-related com-
plications (22.8%). Results were generally similar
among the child and adolescent subgroups
(Supplementary Figure S3 and S4).

Physicians’ Perspective on Adherence
Among Child, Adolescent, and Adult
Patients with ADHD and Management
Strategies

reported that

Based on the physician survey, 23.8% of the
their
participating physicians
child patients missed a dose of their ADHD
treatment about half the time or more; this
proportion was 27.7% for adolescent patients
and 15.4% for adult patients (Fig. 3a). The
physicians’ perspective on the top reasons for
patient skipping or missing planned doses of
ADHD treatment were forgetting to take it,
problems with obtaining prescription, weekend,
vacation or special events, and experienced or
to avoid potentially experiencing adverse events
(Fig. 3b).

Regarding management strategies for non-
adherent patients with ADHD, the most fre-
quent actions taken by physicians to manage
patients who reported regularly skipping or
missing planned doses of ADHD treatment were
patient education, closer monitoring, and
change prescribed ADHD medication (i.e., dis-
continuation, add-on, switch) (Fig. 3c).

DISCUSSION

The current panel-based chart review study of
pediatric patients with ADHD found that treat-
ment-related factors were key reasons for treat-
ment changes among children and adolescents
with ADHD in the US, despite the multiple US
Food and Drug Administration-approved phar-
macological treatment options available [17].
While many of the available treatments are
associated with favorable efﬁcacy proﬁles [18],
the beneﬁts of treatments can only be realized if
patients receive the treatment and adhere to the
planned schedule. However, prior real-world
evidence has shown that more than a third of
children and adolescents with ADHD in the US
are not receiving pharmacological treatments

2Adherence level was assessed among patients whose
treatment was expected to be taken regularly, according to
a pre-deﬁned schedule

[19]; among those who do receive treatments,
treatment changes are frequent and adherence
tends to be low [8, 9, 13]. Thus, it is crucial to
understand the challenges
faced by these
patients to improve patient care; however, there
is a paucity of studies that provide context to
interpret these observations. Through analyzing
the reasons underlying treatments changes
among pediatric patients with ADHD, this study
revealed that inadequate/suboptimal manage-
ment of symptoms was the most common reason
for treatment discontinuation (60.2%), and more
than one-fourth of patients discontinued medi-
cation such as ADHD/treatment-related compli-
cations such as sleeping and eating disorders
commonly associated with ADHD medications
[20, 21]. Furthermore, inadequate/suboptimal
management of symptoms and ADHD/treat-
ment-related complications were also among the
main reasons for other treatment changes and
including treatment add-on,
modiﬁcations,
treatment switch, and dose increase. Over 40% of
pediatric patients treated for ADHD experienced
at least one complication during treatment.
Additionally, adverse events were a common
reason for poor adherence among patients, as
reported in the physician survey. Overall, physi-
cian-perceived patient adherence found in this
study appeared to be higher than actual patient
adherence reported in the literature [10, 22].

Together, ﬁndings of this study ﬁll the gap of
existing studies and allow us to better understand
the reasons underlying the frequent treatment
changes and poor adherence in pediatric ADHD
management from the physicians’ perspective.
Future studies including patients’ and parents’
perspectives are warranted for a more complete
understanding on the challenges associated with
ADHD management. Results from these studies
may help identify potential solutions to alleviate
some of the burdens in ADHD care in the long
term.

The current chart review study provides a
contemporary and comprehensive assessment
on the reasons for various types of treatment
changes in ADHD and has revealed that the
reasons for changes remain mostly treatment-
related within the context of the current land-
scape in the US. This study did not impose
speciﬁc criteria on patient treatment history
(e.g., it did not exclude patients with other
psychotropic medications) so that the patient
samples could more closely reﬂect the patient
population encountered in real-world routine
clinical practice. Comprehensive studies in the

US evaluating reasons underlying different
types of treatment changes to ADHD medica-
tions have been limited, and most studies have
focused on treatment discontinuation [9, 23].
Nonetheless, ﬁndings in the current study are in
line with those found in a systematic literature
review that included 31 international studies on
reasons for treatment discontinuation among
children and adolescents with ADHD. The
review found that the most frequently reported
reasons for discontinuing ADHD medication in
these populations were treatment ineffective-
ness/suboptimal response and adverse effects
(both reported in 21 of 31 studies). Addition-
ally, poor adherence, parent’s decision to dis-
continue, and patient attitude were also
reported as reasons for discontinuation [9].

a medication is

It is of note that parent/family and patient
attitude/dislike of medication were among the
frequently documented reasons for treatment
changes in the current study. The negative
attitude
likely
attributable to myriad reasons, which may be
treatment-related (e.g.,
lack of effectiveness,
treatment complications) and/or parent/pa-
tient-related factors (e.g., children not feeling
like themselves, parents concern about long-
term effects) [24, 25]. Prior single-center studies
on parent/patient attitude toward stimulant
treatment for ADHD based on interviews and
questionnaires suggested that a major cause of
parents’ negative attitude toward stimulants
was the concern about adverse and long-term
effects of stimulants on their children. Mean-
while, many child and adolescent patients with
ADHD felt that stimulant treatment led to
changes in their sense of self and depressed
mood, and they would choose to discontinue
treatment if they could [24, 25]. Future large-
scale parent or patient surveys may provide
additional insights to the reasons underlying
the dislike of medication. Nonetheless, hints
from prior studies may point to the potential
improvement
attitude
toward the medication through advancing
ADHD treatments with a better safety proﬁle
and less negative impact on the lives of child/
adolescent patients with ADHD.

tantly, the current study has provided context
to the ﬁndings of the abovementioned claims
study by showing the lack of effectiveness and
tolerability issues are important reasons for
treatment changes among pediatric patients
with ADHD, demonstrating the need for effec-
tive and tolerable medications
to improve
patients’ treatment experience. Future prospec-
tive studies may be conducted to evaluate
whether
treatments with more
favorable efﬁcacy and safety proﬁles could lead
to reduced treatment changes, for example,
through following sequential patients who were
started on different types of ADHD medications.
Frequent treatment changes or dosage adjust-
ments not only entail additional efforts by both
physicians and patients/families (e.g., addi-
tional monitoring and clinic visits), but the
number of treatment changes has also been
shown to be associated with increased health-
care costs among patients with ADHD [13, 26].
Therefore, improved medication may not only
reduce the need for treatment change but may
also mitigate both the clinical and ﬁnancial
burden associated with ADHD.

This

treatment change or

study found that many patients
remained on treatment despite experiencing
complications because of the lack of better
alternatives. It is also notable that if treatment
changes were not observed in some patients, it
would be unclear how these complications
might impact adherence or patients’ attitude
toward the treatment; these factors may lead to
an eventual
reduced
adherence and ultimately hinder the effective-
ness of ADHD management. These ﬁndings
highlight that existing evidence on the frequent
treatment changes and poor adherence among
pediatric patients with ADHD likely only rep-
resents a small portion of the true unmet needs
in this population. As staying on treatment and
being adherent while treated are crucial for
successful treatment outcomes [25, 27], more
tolerable ADHD treatment options are war-
ranted to address some of the management
challenges in pediatric ADHD.

Meanwhile, the current survey found that
their
physicians
patients with ADHD adhered to the dosing

believed * 75%–85% of

schedule more than half of the time; however,
this relatively high physician-perceived patient
adherence appears to be inconsistent with actual
patient adherence reported in the literature. In
previous claims-based analyses in the US that
assessed adherence based on how frequently
patients
reﬁlled their ADHD prescriptions,
adherence among children and adolescents ran-
ged between 30 and 60% [10, 22], which was
lower
than the physician-perceived patient
adherence found in the current survey, high-
lighting the need for enhanced physician–pa-
tient communication. While future studies are
needed to further explore different avenues for
improving ADHD management, we believe the
reasons underlying treatment changes identiﬁed
in the current study (e.g., adverse event experi-
ence, patients forgetting to take the medication)
can be translated into practical clinical solutions
to alleviate some of the management challenges.
For instance, physicians should spend more time
explaining to their patients and parents/families
how the efﬁcacy and safety of the treatments may
impact the treatment journey and factor these
considerations into the treatment decisions (e.g.,
can a less effective but more tolerable option be
appropriate for some patients to minimize the
risk of subsequent treatment changes or lack of
adherence?). Physicians should also initiate dis-
cussion on adherence or use tools such as Pre-
scription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) [28]
to monitor prescription ﬁlls, to ensure they have
a good knowledge of patients’ adherence to their
ADHD treatment.
pediatric
patients and their parents/families should be
educated early on during treatment planning to
ascertain their understanding on the importance
of receiving treatment and being adherent to the
treatment schedule. Ongoing discussions should
also be conducted to tailor the speciﬁc challenges
faced by ADHD patients at different develop-
mental stages. Altogether, raising awareness
among physicians and pediatric patients as well
as their parents/families on the importance of
treatment and potential strategies to improve
adherence, along with efforts to advance treat-
ment development to minimize the need of
treatment changes, would be necessary to alle-
viate the burden of pediatric ADHD.

Furthermore,

Adv Ther (2022) 39:5487–5503

The ﬁndings from the current study should be
considered in respect to certain limitations. First,
information captured was limited to that avail-
able in the patients’ medical records held by the
physicians participating in the study. Thus,
information on healthcare services received
outside of the physicians’ care settings that were
not recorded in the medical charts was not
available for this study. Second, the study inclu-
ded only physicians accessible through the panel
of M3 Global Research who wished to participate
in this study; accordingly, the sample may not be
representative of the US physician population
treating children and adolescents with ADHD.
Third, although participating physicians were
instructed to select patients at random, selection
bias may still exist (e.g., selection of patients
recently seen or with certain outcomes). Fourth,
the current survey did not differentiate whether
the ADHD/treatment
complications were
adverse event- or comorbidity-related. Finally,
certain ﬁndings on treatment patterns and
ADHD/treatment-related complications may be
limited by the small sample size available.

CONCLUSIONS

This chart review study found that overall, the
lack of effectiveness and ADHD/treatment-re-
lated complications were important reasons for
treatment changes among children and adoles-
cents with ADHD. Furthermore, ADHD/treat-
ment-related complications were
common
among child and adolescent patients, prompting
many to have treatment changes and suboptimal
adherence to their treatment; both factors may
lead to lower effectiveness. These ﬁndings high-
light the need for more effective and tolerable
treatments to mitigate the burden of ADHD.
