Abstract
Relationship standards are beliefs about what

is

important in a satisfying couple relationship, which
vary considerably between cultures, and might mean

that what couples seek from couple therapy differs
across cultures. We assessed the standards of n = 49
Pakistani couples and whether those standards pre-

dicted couple satisfaction. To provide referents for the
Pakistani standards, we also assessed selfreported
relationship standards in n = 33 Western couples and
n = 30 Chinese couples. Pakistani couples endorsed
couple bond standards (e.g., expressions of love) as

similarly important, and family responsibility (e.g.,
extended family relations) standards as more impor-

tant, than Western or Chinese couples. In Pakistani
couples, Couple Bond predicted couples' relationship

satisfaction, but

family responsibility and Religion

predicted only wives' satisfaction. Modest sample sizes
necessitate caution in interpreting results but suggest

existing couple therapies might need modification to
the distinctive relationship standards of
address

Pakistani couples.

JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY

Couple relationship satisfaction is the extent to which someone's relationship meets their standards
of what a quality relationship should be like (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020). The importance of
standards like relations with extended family, adherence to traditional gender roles, and the role of
religion in the relationship vary substantially between culturally diverse countries (Hiew et al., 2015a;
Iqbal et al., 2019; Skellern et al., 2021). These different relationship standards might mean different
standards predict relationship satisfaction in different cultures, and possibly that the goals couples
seek to achieve from couple therapy might differ across cultures. The current study assessed the
relationship standards of Pakistani couples, who were culturally distinctive from previously studied
samples of couples. We compared the Pakistani couples' relationship standards with those of
Australian couples of European or Western heritage (hereafter referred to as Western couples) and
Chinese couples. We also tested the association of relationship standards with relationship
satisfaction in the Pakistani couples.

Relationship standards

Epstein and Baucom (2002, p. 72) defined couple relationship standards as: “…personal beliefs about
the characteristics an intimate relationship … should have.” Most research on couple relationship
standards has been done within Western cultures (e.g., Baucom et al., 1996; Eidelson & Epstein, 1982;
Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, et al., 1999) and, understandably, assessed relationship standards
reflecting values in the society in which they were conducted. Specifically, all these researchers
assessed standards reflecting aspects of romantic love (e.g., attraction, expressions of love, and
psychological intimacy) as central to couple relationships, which reflects Western ideals but does not
address other ideals in non‐Western cultures (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020).

Recent work has used the Cross‐Cultural Couple Relationship Standards Scale (CCCRSS)
(Halford et al., 2018; Hiew et al., 2015a) to assess a range of relationship standards likely to be
differentially important across diverse cultures. To describe the scope of the standards that
might be relevant in diverse cultures, we summarize the content of the CCCRSS. The original
CCCRSS assessed two superordinate standards. The first is couple bond, which includes
love, (e.g., “Express their love for each other in words every day”),
demonstration of
demonstration of caring, and expressing and being receptive to intimate communication (e.g.,
“Ask each other about their thoughts”). The second standard was family responsibility, which
includes relations with the extended family (e.g., “Do not disagree with family elders”), face
(e.g., “Avoid doing things that might lower others' opinions of their partner or the couple”),
relational harmony (e.g., “Do not speak about things that may lead to conflict”), and traditional
gender roles (e.g., “The man financially supports his partner and children.”)

Later versions of the CCCRSS added two more standards (Iqbal et al., 2019; Skellern
et al., 2021): Relationship effort and religion. Relationship effort refers to working on your
relationship (e.g., “Persist in trying to make things better when the relationship has problems”).
Relationship effort seems likely to be associated with relationship satisfaction, but this
hypothesis was untested till the current study. The religion relationship standard includes
beliefs that one's marriage should be blessed by a divine being,
that spouses should
communicate about religion, and that partners should share religious practices (Skellern
et al., 2021). More religious people tend to have more satisfying marriages, both among
Christians (Mahoney et al., 2008) and Muslims (Yeganeh & Shaikhmahmoodi, 2013).

Perhaps endorsing relationship standards about religion in the relationship is associated with
satisfaction, but this hypothesis was untested till the current study.

Culture and relationship standards

The mean endorsement of couple bond standards is high, and shows only small cross‐cultural
variations among Pakistanis, Chinese, and Westerners (Halford et al., 2018; Hiew et al., 2015a;
Iqbal et al., 2019), suggesting that Couple Bond standards are cross‐culturally seen as
important. However, Chinese and Pakistanis much more strongly endorse Family Responsibil-
ity relationship standards than do Westerners (Halford et al., 2018; Hiew et al., 2015a, 2015b;
Iqbal et al., 2019). There also are large cultural differences in the religion relationship standard
(Skellern et al., 2021); those without a religious faith living in Western countries (the United
States and Australia) rate it as much less important than did Christians living in Western
countries, Buddhists living in Thailand, and Muslims living in Pakistan.

Culture is a series of ideas, behaviors, and technologies that can be taught, and which serve as
adaptations to the environment (Creanza et al., 2017). Relationship standards that vary between
cultures relate to dimensions of cultural variation (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020), and we elaborate
on this point to provide a theoretical framework for our predictions. One widely used typology of
(1) Survival—
cultural values (Inglehart & Baker, 2000) suggests two major dimensions:
selfexpression and (2) Traditional—secular/rational. Survival values prioritize collective behaviors
that promote economic and physical security and are endorsed most strongly in low‐income
countries (Dobewell & Strack, 2014; Kashima et al., 2019), notably in African, and Islamic countries
(World Values Survey, 2020). Selfexpression values prioritize personal freedom and quality of life and
are most strongly endorsed in high‐income countries (Kashima et al., 2019), notably majority English‐
speaking countries, and the protestant areas of Europe (World Values Survey, 2020).

People living in countries with high survival values, (e.g., Pakistan and China) strongly
endorse family responsibility standards (Hiew et al., 2015a; Iqbal et al., 2019). For example,
maintaining couple relationship harmony is valued in high survival value contexts, which
might reflect the survival consequences if a couple separate in that context. People living in
countries with high selfexpressive values, (e.g., Australia and the United States) rate Family
Responsibility standards as relatively unimportant (Hiew et al., 2015a), possibly values like
maintaining harmony are seen as less important when selfexpression is a core cultural value.
Traditional values emphasize the importance of God and religion, and that tight conformity
to culturally defined normative behavior is important; whereas secular‐rational values
prioritize the importance of science and rational thought, selfdetermination in life, and
freedom to deviate from culturally normative behavior (Inglehart & Baker, 2000). The Religion
standard is strongly endorsed in Pakistan (Iqbal et al., 2019) and Thailand (Skellern et al., 2021),
which also has strong endorsement of traditional values (World Values Survey, 2020), and
much less strongly in Australia and the United States (Skellern et al., 2021), which endorse
Secular‐Rational values (World Values Survey, 2020).

Association of couple relationship standards and satisfaction

Researchers have suggested three ways in which relationship standards can influence
relationship satisfaction. First, satisfaction might be a function of the extent to which the

114

relationship meets the partners' relationship standards, and there does seem to be an
association between these constructs (e.g., Baucom et al., 1996). However, predicting
satisfaction from whether your relationship meets your relationship standards seems circular,
in that satisfaction seems just another way of saying the relationship meets your standards.

Second, relationship standards might influence relationship satisfaction by some standards
being adaptive for couple relationships. For example, in the United States couples' endorsement
of standards of shared decision‐making and frequent demonstration of caring correlate with
relationship satisfaction (Baucom et al., 1996). However, even in comparing countries within
Europe, culture affects the association between these standards and satisfaction (Goodwin &
Gaines, 2004), suggesting different standards may be adaptive in diverse cultures. Third,
relationship standards might influence relationship satisfaction when similarity between
partners' standards is high (Hiew et al., 2015b). If both partners value similar behaviors, then it
seems likely the relationship can meet each partner's standards.

Couple bond endorsement is associated with relationship satisfaction in Western and
Chinese couples (Halford et al., 2018; Hiew et al., 2015b). Evidence‐based couple therapy, (e.g.,
behavioral and emotion focused couple therapies) is based on researched correlates of
relationship satisfaction in Western couples, and these therapies emphasize strengthening the
couple bond (Halford & Pepping, 2019). For example, positive communication correlates with
high satisfaction, and communication skills training is included in behavioral couple therapy
(Halford & Pepping, 2019). A couple bond focus seems appropriate, given the importance
attached to couple bond across diverse cultures. However, if additional standards in non‐
Western cultures correlate with relationship satisfaction, couple therapy might need to
incorporate additional foci (e.g., family responsibilities).

Pakistani culture and couple relationship standards

We conducted research on Pakistani couples for three main reasons. First, Pakistan is a low‐
income, non‐Western country of approximately 196 million people (Pakistani Ministry of
Finance, 2017), and Pakistan has core cultural values that prioritize survival, and tradition‐
religiosity (World Values Survey, 2020). That makes Pakistan distinctive from the Western
cultures in which relationship standards mainly have been studied. In Pakistan, 96% of the total
population of Pakistan identifies as Muslim, and more than 95% of Pakistanis agree that
religion is “very important” in their lives, compared with 40% of Americans, and less than 10%
of the Australian and Hong Kong Chinese population (World Values Survey, 2020). The Islamic
tradition places significance on the sanctity of marriage (Alghafli et al., 2014); and the
religiousness of Pakistani culture seems likely to be reflected in relationship standards.

Second, we focused on Pakistan because it is culturally tight (Gelfand et al., 2011). Culturally tight
countries have low tolerance for deviation from culturally defined desirable behavior, (e.g., India,
Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea); culturally loose countries have more tolerance of deviance from
culturally defined behavior (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Greece, and United States) (Gelfand et al., 2011).
The cultural tightness in Pakistan may well be reflected in relationship standards. For instance,
unmarried cohabitation is strongly discouraged in Pakistani culture, whereas cohabitation is accepted
or at least tolerated in most Western countries (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020). Third, the only studies
to date of relationship standards in Pakistanis found their standards were quite different to
Westerners or Chinese. Most notably, Pakistanis endorsed the importance of Religion more strongly
than any other culture studied to date (Iqbal et al., 2019; Skellern et al., 2021).

Aims of the current research

|

115

There were two aims in the current study. The primary aim was to evaluate the association of
relationship standards with relationship satisfaction in Pakistani couples, which could clarify
how well correlates of couple satisfaction in Western countries also correlate in Pakistani
couples. A secondary aim was to assess Pakistani relationship standards and to do that we
compared Pakistani standards with two other cultures. We had data on couple bond and family
responsibility relationship standards of Westerner couples
living in Australia (Hiew
et al., 2015b), and Chinese couples living in Hong Kong (Halford et al., 2018). As noted
earlier, Pakistan is more survival‐focused than China which in turn is more survival‐focused
than Western countries. In addition, culturally Pakistan differs from Western countries and
China in being more religious. Therefore, we compared our Western and Chinese samples, who
differ culturally in noteworthy ways from our sample of Pakistani couples recruited for the
current study. Based on Iqbal et al. (2019), we predicted Pakistanis would endorse the couple
bond standards similarly to Westerners and Chinese (Hypothesis 1), and endorse family
responsibility standards more strongly than Westerners, and at least as strongly as Chinese
(Hypothesis 2). We did not have data on other cultures with which to compare Pakistani
couples on the religion or relationship effort standards. Based on the centrality of religion in
Pakistani culture, and Iqbal et al.'s (2019) findings, we predicted Pakistanis would endorse the
religion and relationship effort standards at least as strongly as family responsibility standards
(Hypothesis 3). Most studies found no sex differences in relationship standards in Pakistani,
Chinese, or Westerners (Halford et al., 2018; Iqbal et al., 2019). We made no specific predictions
but did test for sex differences in the current Pakistani, Chinese and Western couple samples.
As endorsement of couple Bond and agreement on family responsibility standards predicted
relationship satisfaction in Western and Chinese cultures (Halford et al., 2018; Hiew
et al., 2015b), we predicted that in Pakistan high satisfaction would be associated with
high couple bond (Hypothesis 4), and high partner agreement on family responsibility
(Hypothesis 5). Given the centrality of religion in Pakistan, we hypothesized that endorsement
of religion would predict high satisfaction (Hypothesis 6). Finally, we predicted that
relationship effort would predict high satisfaction (Hypothesis 7). Previous findings in Chinese
and Westerners found little sex difference in the association of satisfaction with standards
(Hiew et al., 2015b). It was unclear whether this would also be true in Pakistanis; so, we made
no specific predictions but did test for sex differences.

Participants

There were three samples. The first sample was recruited specifically for the current study
between July and September 2016, and consisted of 49 married couples living in Pakistan, who
were recruited via social media for a study on “what makes a great couple relationship?” All
couples were selfdescribed as Muslim. Samples 2 and 3 were recruited between June 2014 and
June 2016 for a study comparing Chinese, Western and intercultural couples living in Hong
Kong, China and Brisbane, Australia, which is reported in Halford et al. (2018). In the current
article, we focus on the 33 Western (i.e., European ancestry) married couples living in
Australia, and the 30 Chinese married couples living in Hong Kong, China.

Measures

JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY

The Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI; Funk & Rogge, 2007) is a widely used 32‐item measure
of relationship satisfaction that has strong convergent and construct validity. In the Pakistani
sample the CSI had excellent internal consistency, α = 0.94, similar to the high consistency in
both the Western and Chinese samples, α = 0.97.

long‐term couple relationship on a 6‐point scale (0 = Not

Cross‐Cultural Couple Relationship Standards Scale (CCCRSS) is an 89‐item measure
of couple relationship standards. Each item describes a behavior that is rated for its importance
Important,
for a successful
5 = Extremely Important). The 89 items reflect 10 scales, which were described in the
introduction, and each scale is the mean of the items in the scale. The mean of the four scales
that assess demonstration of love, demonstration of caring, intimacy expression, and intimacy
responsiveness form a superordinate couple bond scale. The mean of the four scales that assess
relations with the extended family, face, relational harmony and traditional gender roles form a
superordinate family responsibility scale. The derived scores were the totals for the couple
bond,
family responsibility, relationship effort, and religion standards. In addition, we
calculated the similarity of the partners on each standard as the ICC of the item scores in that
standard, with high scores (closer to 1) reflecting high spouse similarity on that standard. As
the derived score is the agreement between partners, the score is a couple‐level variable (i.e., is
the same for each spouse).

The items of the CCCRSS show structural invariance across culturally diverse samples in
the United States, Australia, China, Pakistan, and Thailand (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020).
Internal consistency in the current Pakistani sample was high on all scales, couple bond
α = 0.91, family responsibility α = 0.90, relationship effort α = 0.90, and religion α = 0.89. The
couple bond and family responsibility scales administered to the Westerners and Chinese had
similar high internal consistency, ranging from α = 0.90 to 0.95.

Procedure

The Pakistani couples were recruited through social media and measures were administered
online. The couples recruited in Brisbane, Australia were recruited through online and
traditional media outreach, and participated in two face‐to‐face sessions with a research team
member. We administered the selfreport measures as an online questionnaire administered
during the first session. Following completion of these assessments, partners participated in
four video‐recorded discussions. The current article focuses on relationship standards. We also
recruited the couples in Hong Kong, China online and they completed the same questionnaires
online as the Australian sample, but we did not conduct the face‐to‐face assessments with the
Hong Kong couples. The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland
reviewed and approved all procedures in the conduct of the research (approvals 2010000418
and 2015000773).

Data analysis

There was less than 0.5% missing data in the three data sets, and we used maximum likelihood
estimation to impute missing data. To test Hypotheses 1 and 2 comparing Pakistani standards

JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY

with these other countries we did two 3 × 2 analysis of variances (ANOVAs) of Country
(Pakistan, Australia, and China) by sex, with the latter being a within‐subject factor, on couple
bond and family responsibility standards. As there were significant differences between
countries on relationship satisfaction, we also ran ANCOVAs using relationship satisfaction as
a covariate. The pattern of findings was identical, so we report the original ANOVAs. To test
Hypothesis 3 comparing the mean rated importance of the four relationship standards by
Pakistani men and women, we did a 4 × 2 ANOVA of standards (couple bond, family
responsibility, religion and relationship effort) by sex, with both factors being within subject
factors. In presenting these ANOVAs we describe the effect sizes using the conventions
proposed by Cohen (1998) for partial η2 of small > 0.01, medium > 0.06, and large effect
sizes > 0.14, and we follow these conventions for main and interaction terms. While there are
not widely used effect size conventions for interactions terms, when reporting partial η2 this
indicates the proportion of variance accounted for and therefore seems equally applicable to
main and interaction terms.

To test our primary hypotheses about

the association of standards to relationship
satisfaction in Pakistani couples, we conducted four sex‐specific multilevel models (MLMs)
in which partners were clustered within the couple using MLwiN (Rasbash et al., 2005). The
models separately examined the actor, partner, and similarity effects of endorsement of each of
the four relationship standards on relationship satisfaction in an Actor Partner Similarity
Interdependence Model.

Relationship satisfactionij = [β male0i + β female0i] + [male. male_couple_bondi + female.
female_couple_bondi + female. male_couple_bondi] + [male.

female_couple_bondi] + [male.
similarity_couple_bondi + female. similarity_couple_bondi]

In the above MLM equation, male and female are dummy variables that create the sex‐
specific estimates. In the first set of square brackets β male0i + β female0i are the intercepts of
satisfaction for men and women. Male_couple_bond and Female_couple_bond are the
endorsement of couple bond standards by the male and female partners. The first square
bracket models actor effects of endorsement of couple bond standards on satisfaction. The
second square bracket model partner effects. The third square bracket models the association of
partner standards similarity with satisfaction. Similarity_couple_bond designates the ICC
between the male and female partners' endorsement of standards. The same model assessed the
association of relationship satisfaction with family responsibility, religious, and relationship
effort standards, by inserting the relevant standard in the equation.

RESU LTS

Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics for the three samples. To assess the
comparability of the three samples, we conducted separate one‐way ANOVAs of countries
(Pakistan, Australia, and China) on women's and men's age and relationship satisfaction. We
also conducted 3 by 2 Chi‐squares on categorical data of presence of children, and male and
female spouse completion of university education. There were no significant differences in
mean age by country. There were significant, large effect size differences between countries in
the mean relationship satisfaction for men and women. In both sexes Pakistanis reported lower
satisfaction than Westerners. Pakistani and Chinese men had similar levels of satisfaction,
whereas Pakistani women reported higher satisfaction than Chinese women. There was no
difference between countries in the mean duration of the relationship.

Table 1 shows the countries differed in the proportion of couples having children. A higher
proportion of Pakistani couples had children than Australian couples, χ2(1) = 5.907, p = 0.022,
or Hong Kong couples, χ2(1) = 9.803, p = 0.002. The proportion of couples having children was
not significantly different between Australian and Chinese couples, χ2(1) = 0.551, p = 0.604.
There were high, similar rates of female university education across countries. A higher
proportion of Pakistani men had university education than Australian men, χ2(1) = 8.440,
p = 0.004, there was no significant difference in the proportion of Pakistani men to have
university education than Chinese men, χ2(1) = 3.296, p = 0.069, and Australian and Chinese
men did not differ in rates of university education, χ2(1) = 0.896, p = 0.344.

In summary, the three samples of couples were similar in age and relationship duration.
There were differences in mean relationship satisfaction across countries, with Westerners
more satisfied than Pakistani or Hong Kong Chinese. Pakistani couples were more likely to
have children than the other couples. Finally, Pakistani men, but not women, were more likely
to have completed university than their Australian counterparts.

Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlations of relationship
satisfaction and relationship standards in Pakistani couples. Mean relationship satisfaction
was higher for women, and similar for men as that reported for a large community sample of
US adults (M = 121, SD = 32) (Funk & Rogge, 2007). Mean endorsement of each of the four
relationship standards was around 4 on the 5‐point scale, reflecting a rating of “very
important.” Mean similarity scores (ICCs between partners' scores) were low and reflect a small
to medium association between spouses' standards, which might reflect the high mean and
truncated range of scores on each standard. Correlation between the partners on relationship
satisfaction and endorsement of each standard was significant (medium associations). Male
satisfaction was correlated with high couple bond (medium association), but not with his other
three standards. Female satisfaction was correlated with three of her four standards but not
with relationship effort. In men, three standards (couple bond, family responsibility, and
religion) showed large significant correlations with each other, but relationship effort was
unrelated to the other standards. In women, all four standards showed significant medium to
large correlations. Partner similarity on standards show low to null association with
endorsement of those standards by male or female partners. Partner similarity on all four
standards showed no association with satisfaction for either sex.

Rated importance of relationship standards

Figure 1 presents the mean on the couple bond and family responsibility standards for the three
samples (Pakistani, Western, and Chinese couples). In this article, we use in the ANOVA
testing country differences in couple bond standards (Hypothesis 1), there was a significant
large effect of country, F(2, 109) = 9.847, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.153, but no significant effect of sex,
F(1, 109) = 0.234, p = 0.629, η2 = 0.002, or interaction by country, F(2, 109) = 1.306, p = 0.275,
η2 = 0.023. Pakistanis and Westerners did not differ significantly on couple bond, F(1,
80) = 0.000, p = 0.984, η2 = 0.000, but Pakistanis rated couple bond as more important than
Chinese, F(1, 77) = 14.787, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.161. Figure 1 shows comparable means on couple
bond in Pakistan and Australia, a lower mean for China, and the similarity of the sexes within
each country.

In testing country differences in family responsibility (Hypothesis 2) there was a large effect
country, F(2, 109) = 106.921, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.662, no significant effect of
sex,

F I G U R E 1 Mean relationship standards importance by country and by sex. Only Pakistani couples were
assessed on religion and relationship effort.

F(1, 109) = 1.321, p = 0.253, η2 = 0.012, and a medium interaction of sex by country, F(2,
109) = 3.674, p = 0.026, η2 = 0.065. Pakistanis rated family responsibility (M = 3.97, SD = 0.60)
as more important than did Australians (M = 2.11, SD = 0.60), F(1, 80) = 193.141, p < 0.001,
η2 = 0.706, and as more important than Chinese (M = 2.71, SD = 0.54), F(1, 77) = 101.421,
p < 0.001, η2 = 0.568. The interaction of country by sex was attributable to there being no sex
difference in Family Responsibility in Pakistani couples, F(1, 48) = 0.868, p = 0.356, η2 = 0.018,
or in Chinese couples, F(1, 48) = 0.034, p = 0.956, η2 = 0.001; but Australian men rated family
responsibility (M = 2.25, SD = 0.68) as more important than did Australian women (M = 1.96,
SD = 0.81), F(1, 48) = 101.421, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.568. Even with the sex difference in
Australians, Figure 1 shows that sex differences within cultures are smaller than the cultural
differences between countries on family responsibility.

In testing Hypothesis 3 about the relative endorsement of the different standards by
Pakistani couples, there was a large effect of standard, F(3, 46) = 4.694, p = 0.006, η2 = 0.234,
but no significant effect of sex, F(1, 48) = 1.774, p = 0.189, η2 = 0.036, or interaction of standard
by sex, F(3, 46) = 0.366, p = 0.778, η2 = 0.023. Religion had the highest mean (M = 4.12,
SD = 0.56) and was rated as more important than family responsibility, which had the lowest
mean endorsement of the four standards, (M = 3.97, SD = 0.52), F(1, 48) = 5.348, p = 0.025,
η2 = 0.100. Religion was not rated as significantly more important than couple bond (M = 3.99,
SD = 0.68), F(1, 48) = 4.026, p = 0.050, η2 = 0.077. None of the other pairwise comparisons of
rated importance of the standards were significant. Figure 1 shows the mean of each of the four
standards are similar across sexes.

Relationship standards and satisfaction in Pakistani couples

Figure 2 shows the MLM coefficients for the relationship standards' prediction of relationship
satisfaction. As shown, own couple bond predicted high satisfaction for both men and women,
but there were no partner or similarity effects for couple bond. Women's family responsibility
predicted their own satisfaction, but there were no other associations with satisfaction for

women or men. Women's religion, and spousal agreement on religion, predicted women's
satisfaction. Religion did not predict men's satisfaction, β = 10.235 (SE = 5.369), z = 1.741
p = 0.082. Relationship effort predicted own satisfaction of women and men, and spousal
similarity predicted women's satisfaction. Across all standards, there were no partner effects,
and there were more associations between standards and women's satisfaction than men's
satisfaction.

DISCUSSION

We assessed relationship standards in Pakistani couples, compared endorsement with that of
Westerners and Chinese, and assessed the association of standards with satisfaction among
Pakistani couples. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, Pakistani couples rated Couple Bond as
similarly important as did Westerners, and as more important than did Chinese. Consistent
with Hypothesis 2, Pakistani couples rated Family Responsibility standards as more important
than Western couples, and even rated it as more important than Chinese couples. Hypothesis 3
was supported, Pakistanis rated Religion as at least as important as Family Responsibility, in
fact they rated it as even more important. There was no evidence of sex differences in mean
endorsement of standards by Pakistani couples,

On the association of standards with relationship satisfaction, Hypothesis 4 was supported,
participants' own rated importance of couple bond predicted high satisfaction of Pakistani
women and men. The association between family responsibility and satisfaction was not as
predicted in Hypothesis 5, instead of partner agreement it was women's endorsement of family
responsibility that predicted their own satisfaction, and contrary to prediction there was no
association at all between family responsibility and men's satisfaction. There was partial
support for Hypothesis 6, own endorsement of Religion, and agreement between partners on
religion, predicted women's satisfaction, but not men's satisfaction. As predicted in Hypothesis
7, own relationship effort predicted satisfaction for women and men; and similarity of
relationship effort predicted women's satisfaction.

Culture and couple relationship standards

The current findings that couple bond, family responsibility, religion, and relationship effort
each were highly endorsed by Pakistani men and women, replicates an earlier study (Iqbal
et al., 2019). Similarly, the finding that Couple Bond is rated comparably by Pakistanis,
Chinese, and Westerners; while family responsibility and religion are endorsed significantly
more by Pakistanis than Chinese or Westerners, also replicates earlier studies (Iqbal et al., 2019;
Skellern et al., 2021).

The current research is the first to assess the association of standards with satisfaction in
Pakistani couples. The current finding that couple bond is associated with relationship
satisfaction in the distinctive Pakistani culture extends previous findings that couple bond
predicts satisfaction in Western (Hiew et al., 2015b) and Chinese couples (Halford et al., 2018).
Moreover, relationship effort also predicted satisfaction in Pakistani couples. Couple bond and
relationship effort had high correlation in the current sample. In a previous study with
Pakistanis, relationship effort fitted a confirmatory factor analytic model in which it was one of
five subscales of couple bond (Iqbal et al., 2019). While this factor structure needs cross‐cultural
replication, relationship effort might be best thought of as a component of the couple bond.
Together the current and previous findings suggest cross‐cultural consistency in the association
of couple bond with high satisfaction. There is considerable evidence that romantic attachment
evolved in humans to promote shared offspring caregiving (Fletcher, Simpson, Campbell,
et al., 2015), suggesting that a cross‐culturally pervasive desire for a strong couple bond might
reflect evolutionary imperatives.

The strength of endorsement of

family responsibility shows considerable cultural
variability, and the current findings are consistent with previous observation that endorsement
tends to be stronger in survival focused, collectivistic cultures like Pakistan and China than
more selfexpressive, individualistic cultures like Australia and the United States (Halford & van
de Vijver, 2020). Endorsement of family responsibility standards by Pakistani women was
associated with their own high relationship satisfaction, but Pakistani men's endorsement was
unrelated to their satisfaction. These findings failed to replicate previous findings that partner
agreement rather than endorsement of family responsibility predicts satisfaction in Western
(Hiew et al., 2015b) and Chinese couples (Halford et al., 2018). Collectively these findings
suggest cross‐cultural variations, not just in the rated importance of family responsibility
standards, but also in how those standards are associated with relationship satisfaction. In a
low‐income country like Pakistan, survival values and the associated emphasis on family
responsibilities seem likely to be of particular importance.

The current finding that Religion standards were highly endorsed with a mean rated
importance of around 4 reflecting “very important” is in stark contrast to nonreligious
Westerners who rate religion standards around 1 “of minor importance” (Skellern et al., 2021).
The high rating by Pakistanis is consistent with the high importance attached to religion in
Pakistan (World Values Survey, 2020). In Pakistanis wives' religion standards were associated
with wives' relationship satisfaction, but husbands' religion standards were not. While studies
of Muslims living in Pakistan and Iran found a small to medium association of individual
religiosity with satisfaction for both husbands and wives (Aman et al., 2019; Yeganeh &
Shaikhmahmoodi, 2013), a study of Muslims living in the United States found no significant
association between individual religiosity and satisfaction (Abdullah, 2017). Perhaps religiosity
within the majority religion of a country is associated with satisfaction, but not religiosity in a
minority religion within a country. There is evidence that migrants feel pressure to adopt
aspects of the majority culture in which they live van de Vijver et al. (2016), and that
discrimination against minority groups can undermine relationship satisfaction (Trail
et al., 2012). Perhaps adherence to a religion is most beneficial for couple relationships when
that religion is a majority religion.

The current study was the first to test the association of religion relationship standards with
satisfaction, as distinct from individual religiosity. The former is conceptually more proximal to
the couple relationship than individual religiosity. In Caucasian Christian couples, dyadic
spiritual activities (e.g., praying together) is associated with marital satisfaction more strongly
than global religiosity (Mahoney et al., 2008), which might be attributable to joint religious
activities increasing couples' intimacy, shared values, and accessing support from religious
communities (Mahoney et al., 2008).

While not the key focus of the current study, there were differences between countries in
relationship satisfaction, with Pakistani couples being less satisfied than Australian Westerners.
This might reflect broader life satisfaction related to the culture or income of each country. The
World Values Survey (2020) data show Australians rate their life satisfaction significantly
higher than do Pakistanis. Alternatively, relationship satisfaction has been criticized as too
individualistic (Galovan et al., 2021), inappropriately unidimensional, insensitive to variation in
the upper range of relationship quality, and its relevance in non‐Western cultures has been
queried (Sanri et al., 2021). Future research would benefit from extending the range of
measures of relationship quality used with particular attention to the cultural appropriateness
of measures for diverse populations.

Limitations of the study

The sample sizes of couples were modest. In the ANOVAs comparing standards cross‐
culturally the small Chinese sample of 30 dyads is sufficient only to detect medium size
main effects, power = 0.80, and α = 0.05, but does not provide adequate power to reliably
detect small main effects or medium interaction effects (Faul et al., 2007). For the MLM
analyses done with the Pakistani couples, the 49 couples is adequate to detect a medium
effect actor effect, power = 0.80 and α = 0.05, but the power to detect medium partner or
similarity effects in this study was low (Ackerman et al., 2015). Thus, some null results—
most notably the lack of partner and similarity effects in the MLM—might be attributable
to the study being underpowered to detect these effects, and replication with a larger
sample is needed.

All three samples (Pakistanis, Westerners, and Chinese) were convenience samples, and
while they were similar in age and years in the relationship, they differed in some ways.
Analyses controlling for relationship satisfaction suggest country differences in satisfaction are
unlikely to account for country differences in relationship standards. The Pakistani couple also
were more likely to have children than the Western or Chinese couples, which reflects the
higher birth rate in Pakistan relative to other countries.

All three samples had higher than average levels of formal education than the populations
of the countries from which they were drawn. The generalizability of the results to less
educated couples is unclear. Moreover, within each country there are likely to be substantial
cultural variations. For example, in Australia there is a very large and culturally diverse
migrant population who retain much of the elements of the cultures and couple relationship
standards of their countries of origin (Halford et al., 2018). The current Australian sample was
deliberately focused on Australians of European ancestry, labeled as Westerners. General-
izability to Westerners living outside Australia, or non‐Westerners living in Australia needs to
be assessed. Pakistan also has great diversity. Those who live in the large cities of the Sindh
province often are university educated and have considerable exposure to Western cultural
influences, whereas the tribal people of the mountainous regions of the North‐West Frontier
Province have little or no formal education, and little exposure to culture outside their region
(Zaman et al., 2006). Therefore, the convenience‐drawn Pakistani sample is over‐representative
of the educated elite living in cities. In this sample the strength of endorsement of religion
relationships standards was striking, and identification to more traditional religious values is
likely to be even more marked among tribal groups with less exposure to Western culture.

I M P L I C A T I O N S

The lack of association of family responsibility and religion standards with male relationship
satisfaction does not mean those standards are unimportant in Pakistani marriage. There was
high mean endorsement of these standards by both Pakistani men and women. The almost
universal strong endorsement of all four relationship standards likely reflects the strong
influence of Islam on marriage beliefs, and the tightness of the Pakistani culture. However, the
truncated range limits the variability of standards across Pakistani couples to test the
association of those standards with satisfaction.

The strong endorsement of couple bond and relationship effort standards in Pakistan is like
that observed across many diverse cultures (e.g., Halford et al., 2018), and demonstrates some
cross‐cultural consistencies in what
is valued in couple relationships. Evidence‐based
couple therapies prioritize enhancing the couple bond (Halford & Pepping, 2019), which is
likely to be useful to assist distressed Pakistani couples, at least within the educated elites
sampled in the current study. At the same time, as religion standards were rated as so
important by Pakistani couples the largely secular evidence‐based approaches to couple
therapy, which pay little attention to religion (Halford & Pepping, 2019), might need some
adaptation to be acceptable to Pakistani couples. Some Western couple therapists have added
religious concepts to couple therapy, such as relating desired relationship behavior changes to
religious principles and incorporating praying for the spouse into suggested couple activities
(Fincham & Beach, 2014; Stanley et al., 2014). Similar adaptations for Muslim couples might
enhance the acceptability of couple therapy for Muslim couples.

Family responsibility standards were rated as very important by Pakistani couples, which
suggests attention might be needed to this standard in couple therapy for Pakistanis.
Standardized assessment used in Western couple therapies pay little attention to extended
family. For example, the areas of change questionnaire used to assess areas of dissatisfaction
has only 1 of 31 items that relate to extended family (Margolin et al., 1983). The CCCRSS can
broaden assessments to assess areas of importance to couples, which could guide therapists to
give more culturally appropriate couple therapy.

It is noteworthy that the endorsement of family responsibility standards was stronger in the
survival‐focused culture of Pakistan than in the more selfexpression focused cultures of
Australians of Western ancestry. Similarly, endorsement of religion standards was stronger in a
traditional culture like Pakistan than in the more Secular Rational cultures of China and
Australia. Future research needs to test whether such associations between standards
and culture are evident across a broader range of cultures. Relationship standards in any
given culture seem likely to reflect the effects of the environment of adaptation on that
country's culture.

CONCLUSION

The current research adds to the growing body of research on what tends to be cross‐culturally
valued in couple relationships (Couple Bond and Relationship Effort), and what is more
culturally variable (Family Responsibilities and Religion) (Halford & van de Vijver, 2020). The
cross‐cultural consistency in the importance of the couple bond suggests there are some
commonalities in what might be cross‐culturally effective in couple therapy. At the same time,
the cross‐cultural variations suggest the need to test couple therapy adaptations to address
religion and family
issues more specific to particular cultures, notably the role of
responsibilities. In culturally diverse Western countries like the United States and Australia,
it would be useful to test the extent to which relationship standards vary across diverse couples,
and whether adaptations to address particular standards enhance the acceptability and effects
of couple therapy for minority couples.
