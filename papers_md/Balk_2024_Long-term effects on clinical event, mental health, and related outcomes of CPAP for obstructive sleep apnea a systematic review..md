Study Objectives: We performed a systematic review of long-term health outcomes of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use in adults with obstructive
sleep apnea.
Methods: We updated prior systematic reviews with searches in multiple databases through January 3, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
and adjusted nonrandomized comparative studies that reported prespecified long-term (mostly > 1 year) health outcomes. We assessed risk of bias, conducted
meta-analyses, and evaluated strength of evidence.
Results: We found 38 eligible studies (16 trials, 22 observational). All conclusions were of low strength of evidence given study and data limitations. RCTs found
no evidence of effect of CPAP on mortality (summary effect size [ES] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66, 1.21); inclusion of adjusted nonrandomized
comparative studies yields an association with reduced risk of death (ES 0.57; 95% CI 0.44, 0.73). RCTs found no evidence of effects of CPAP for cardiovascular
death (ES 0.99; 95% CI 0.64, 1.53), stroke (ES 0.99; 95% CI 0.73, 1.35), myocardial infarction (ES 1.05; 95% CI 0.78, 1.41), incident atrial fibrillation (ES 0.89;
95% CI 0.48, 1.63), or composite cardiovascular outcomes (all statistically nonsignificant). RCTs found no evidence of effects for incident diabetes (ES 1.02;
95% CI 0.69, 1.51) or accidents (all nonsignificant) and no clinically significant effects on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or cognitive function.
Conclusions: Whether CPAP use for obstructive sleep apnea affects long-term health outcomes remains largely unanswered. RCTs and nonrandomized
comparative studies are inconsistent regarding the effect of CPAP on mortality. Current studies are underpowered, with relatively short duration follow-up and
methodological limitations.

BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Although continuous positive airway pressure devices are commonly prescribed for adults with obstructive sleep
apnea, the evidence does not support their effectiveness to reduce long-term health outcomes. Comparative observational studies suggest an association
between continuous positive airway pressure use and long-term mortality but, with low strength of evidence. Randomized trials fail to support an effect of
continuous positive airway pressure on death, numerous cardiovascular events, incident diabetes, or accidents, with no clinically important effect on
cognitive function or mental health symptoms.
Study Impact: Published trials have been underpowered and of too short a duration to demonstrate effects and have other methodological limitations. We
believe there remains clinical equipoise regarding the long-term effects of continuous positive airway pressure and that future well-conducted trials and
rigorous analyses of observational studies are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder character-
ized by periods of airflow cessation (apnea) or reduced airflow
(hypopnea) during sleep. The predominant first-line therapy for
OSA is prescription of a continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) device, or variants such as auto-adjusting or bilevel
devices, for use during sleep. It is well known that CPAP is
highly effective at improving sleep measures, including apnea-
hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and
other surrogate and intermediate measures of OSA severity, as

well as measures of sleepiness.1 Nevertheless, questions remain
about the effectiveness of CPAP to reduce or improve long-
term health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular [CV] events, stroke,
and mortality). To address this question, SAVE (Sleep Apnea
cardioVascular Endpoints), a large randomized trial of long-
term CPAP use, was designed to test the effectiveness of CPAP
to reduce CV events in people with CV disease (CVD).2–4
Despite improvements in AHI, SAVE found no improvement
of CV and other clinical outcomes. Because CPAP effectively
lowers AHI in clinical practice and across studies, the SAVE
trial raises questions about whether, as has commonly been

Systematic review of CPAP and long-term effects

assumed, change in AHI is a valid intermediate or surrogate
outcome for patient-centered health outcomes and whether
long-term CPAP use prevents morbidities and mortality.

We conducted a Technology Assessment, nominated by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), addressing the com-
parative effectiveness of CPAP specifically on long-term health
outcomes and other related research questions.5 Here we pre-
sent our systematic review (SR) of the relative effectiveness of
CPAP vs no CPAP treatment on prespecified long-term health
outcomes. The full Technology Assessment also addresses
comparisons of CPAP with alternative treatments—for which
there was limited long-term evidence—and the validity of
changes in measures of sleep-disordered breathing (eg, AHI) as
proxies for clinical outcomes—for which evidence is lacking.5
Our review does not evaluate sleep measures, such as AHI, or
symptoms of OSA, such as sleepiness or snoring, for which
CPAP is well known to be effective.1

METHODS

We conducted this SR based on the AHRQ Methods Guide for
Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews6 in
accordance with the Preferred Items for Reporting in System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)7 and A Measure-
ment Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2).8 The
protocol was posted on June 16, 2020,9 and registered in PROS-
PERO on July 17, 2020 (CRD42020192725).

We included published, peer-reviewed randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized comparative studies (NRCSs)
that used analytic methods to minimize confounding bias. Here
we include comparisons of CPAP vs no CPAP. The full report
also includes comparisons of different devices and CPAP vs other
nonsurgical treatments.5 Study participants were adults diagnosed
with OSA (per each study’s criteria), excluding other types of
sleep apnea (including related to prior stroke or severe heart fail-
ure). Health outcomes of interest included all-cause death, CV
death, CV and cerebrovascular events or incident diagnoses and
composite CV outcomes, and incident diagnoses (or resolution)
of hypertension, arrhythmias, diabetes, or prediabetes. For these
outcomes we required a minimum 1-year follow-up. We also
evaluated mental health conditions, cognitive function, quality of
life, sexual function, missed workdays, and accidents, for which
we required a minimum 6-month follow-up.

For literature published through 2010, we rescreened all
studies that had been included in existing SRs on OSA diagno-
sis and treatment conducted for AHRQ.1,10–12 For more recent
articles, de novo literature searches were conducted in PubMed,
Embase, Cochrane databases, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov,
and Epistemonikos for primary studies, existing SRs, and pub-
lished guidelines from January 1, 2010, through January 3,
2023. Note that the full report is current only to March 22,
2021.5 We further collected studies suggested by technical
experts and peer reviewers. The search strategies were peer-
reviewed by an independent medical librarian and are provided
in the supplemental material.

Identified citations were independently double-screened using
Abstrackr by a team of seven researchers (the update since March
2021 was screened by 2 researchers); conflicts were resolved by
group discussion. All potentially relevant studies were rescreened
in full text in duplicate. We extracted study data into the System-
atic Review Data Repository. Study- and outcome-level risk of
bias (RoB) assessment was conducted during data extraction
within the Systematic Review Data Repository. For RCTs, we
used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool13; for NRCSs, we
included assessments of specific elements from the Risk Of
Bias In Nonrandomized Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I)
tool,14 particularly related to selection bias (comparability of
groups). Each study was rated as being at high, moderate, or low
RoB. Because we downgraded RCTs for issues related to ran-
domization and blinding, we determined that NRCSs could be at
best at moderate RoB. We further downgraded NRCSs that did
not use propensity score (or equivalent) analyses to control for
inherent differences among participants who were prescribed or
used CPAP or not. Inadequate propensity score analyses were
also considered to increase the RoB.15

Where feasible and appropriate, we conducted random
effects model pairwise meta-analyses using the restricted maxi-
mum likelihood approach. We separately meta-analyzed RCTs
and NRCSs, in addition to combined meta-analyses. Where fea-
sible, we also separately meta-analyzed intention-to-treat (ITT)
and per-protocol (or adherer) analyses across study designs.

For each outcome, we assessed the strength of evidence
using standard AHRQ methodology.6,16 We considered the
number of studies, the study limitations (ie, RoB), the direct-
ness of the evidence to research question, the consistency of
study results, the precision of any estimates of effect, and other
limitations (particularly sparseness of evidence). For each out-
come with sufficient (ie, not insufficient) evidence, we summa-
rized the overall conclusion based on a combination of the
direction of effect (or association), the statistical significance,
and the magnitude of the effect.

RESULTS

The literature searches (for all questions addressed by the full
report) yielded 22,189 citations; in addition, we found and
screened the references from 87 existing SRs (see Figure S1 in
the supplemental material). Ultimately 38 eligible studies com-
pared CPAP prescription, use, or adherence with no (or rarely,
sham) CPAP prescription, use, or adherence. The 16 RCTs
included a total of 7,664 participants.2,17–45 The 22 NRCSs with
multivariable adjustments for outcomes of interest included a
total of 268,033 participants,46–68 among which 254,724 were
included in 3 relatively large studies.46,54,57 Among the NRCSs,
5 used propensity score matching.46,51,52,58,63 The remaining
logistic regression multivariable
17 NRCSs used traditional
analyses.

The studies are summarized in Table 1 and described in
detail in Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5,
and Table S6, with RoB assessment in Table S7 and Table S8.
Study eligibility criteria were variable across studies. Among

Systematic review of CPAP and long-term effects

1 excluded “severe” OSA (AHI > 30 events/h),30 and 1
restricted to patients with “severe” OSA (ODI ≥ 12).2
Among the 15 NRCSs that reported AHI eligibility criteria, 7
included patients with at least “moderate” OSA (AHI ≥ 15 or
20 events/h),47,48,59–61,64,68 6 included patients with “milder”
OSA,50,55,56,63,65,67 1 excluded both milder and “severe” OSA
(included AHI 15–30 events/h),52 and 1 included only patients
with “severe” OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h).53

Among all studies, 22 reported ITT (or as-prescribed) analy-
ses, comparing participants who were prescribed CPAP with
those not prescribed CPAP (or given a sham CPAP device);
these included all but 2 of the 16 RCTs28,34 and 8 of the 22
NRCSs.51–54,57,58,63,64 Six NRCSs compared adherent and non-
adherent CPAP users (nonadherence was generally defined as
< 4 hours/night for > 70% of nights).48,50,55,60,65,66 Eight
NRCSs compared adherent users with nonusers (either due to
not being prescribed CPAP, refusing or terminating CPAP, or
nonadherence).45–47,49,56,59,61,67

Adherence with CPAP use varied across studies. We were
unable to discern any obvious patterns across studies regarding
low vs high lack of adherence, including duration of the studies.
Among studies that reported adherence and did not require
adherence for inclusion, the median adherence level was 61%
(at 6 months), ranging from 35 to 100% (at 6–60 months). The
adherence levels in the 3 NRCSs that reported data were mostly
higher (67–74%, at 36–60 months) than in the RCTs (where
half the RCTs had adherence levels of 35–43%).

Table 2 and Table 3 summarize the evidence from RCTs
and adjusted NRCSs regarding the effect of CPAP (vs no
CPAP) on CV-related and other health outcomes, respectively.
Descriptions of the findings for outcomes with insufficient evi-
dence (transient ischemic attack, angina, revascularization, con-
gestive heart failure, hypertension, functional status, sexual
function, and missed workdays), mostly due to sparse data, are
reported in the supplemental material.

All-cause mortality
Fourteen studies (5 RCTs and 9 NRCSs) reported on all-cause mor-
tality across 2–11 years (see Table S9).2,24,29,31,38,46,50,55,57–59,63,64,67
The five RCTs evaluated variable populations of patients from 2
to about 5 years of follow-up, including otherwise healthy, non-
elderly adults with at least “moderate” OSA (AHI ≥ 20 events/h
or ODI ≥ 7.5) in 2 RCTs,24,31 known CV or cerebrovascular dis-
ease with “severe” OSA (ODI ≥ 12) in 1 RCT,2 and recent CV
events (acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization)
least “moderate” OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/h) in 2
with at
RCTs.29,38 Adherence varied across studies at about 40% in 3
RCTs2,29,31 and about 60% in 224,38 (Table 1). All RCTs
reported ITT analyses. Two trials were determined to be at mod-
erate RoB2,29; the other trials were determined to be at high RoB
due to high dropout rate,31 high crossover rate,38 and failure to
account for baseline differences in sleep study measures.38

Across RCTs, effect sizes (ESs) ranged from 0.33–2.6, all
statistically nonsignificant. The summary odds ratio across the
RCTs was nonsignificant at 0.89 (95% CI 0.66–1.21) (Figure
1). The ESs did not clearly correlate with adherence rates across
the ITT analyses. SAVE and ISAACC (Impact of Sleep Apnea

syndrome in the evolution of Acute Coronary syndrome) also
reported propensity-score-matched analyses of adherent CPAP
users, with a still-nonsignificant, but stronger, hazard ratio
(HR) in SAVE (0.60; 95% CI 0.32–1.10) but a nearly identical
HR in ISAACC (0.80; 95% CI 0.52–1.23).

Four of the 9 NRCSs evaluated ITT-like analyses of people
provided CPAP devices,57,58,63,64 2 of which used propensity
score analyses and were determined to be at moderate RoB.58,63
The other 5 NRCSs compared adherent users with either nonad-
herent users50,55 or nonusers46,59,67; 1 of the latter used a pro-
pensity score analysis and was determined to be at moderate
RoB.46 The remaining NRCSs were at high RoB based on use
of simple regression analyses, but also because of poor report-
ing and inadequate adjustment of potential confounders. Across
studies, all-cause mortality was reported at a wide range of
follow-up times from 3 to 11 years, with mostly longer-term
follow-up than the RCTs (Table 1). The NRCSs mostly
included a broad range of participants, regardless of AHI or
ODI threshold or comorbidities; however, 2 were restricted to
older adults (≥ 60 years or ≥ 80 years) with AHI ≥ 20 events/
h.59,64 A higher percentage of individuals in most of the NRCSs
died than in the RCTs, particularly in the studies of older adults
and with longest-term follow-up.58

The 4 adjusted NRCSs that reported ITT-like analyses all
found statistically significant associations between CPAP pre-
scription and reduced risk of all-cause mortality.57,58,63,64
Adjusted HRs ranged from 0.08 (in a small, poorly analyzed
study) to 0.67 (in a large database analysis). The summary
adjusted HR across the NRCSs was statistically significant at
0.55 (95% CI 0.42–0.74) (Figure 1).

The 5 as-treated (users vs nonusers) analyses also reported
statistically significant associations between (adherent) CPAP
use and lower risk of all-cause mortality (Figure 1).50,55,59,67
The findings were generally consistent with the ITT-analysis
NRCSs, but with wider confidence intervals.

The summary estimate across all studies (RCTs and NRCSs)
was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44–0.73) (Figure 1). The NRCSs provided
75% of the weight of the meta-analysis, but the ESs of the
RCTs and NRCSs were not significantly different from each
other (P = .076). The ITT and as-treated analyses (across RCTs
and NRCSs) also yielded generally similar summary associa-
tions (P = .27).

Cardiovascular mortality
Five studies (4 RCTs and 1 NRCS) reported incidence of CV
mortality after about 4–7 years (see Table S10).2,24,29,38,63 Two
RCTs were at moderate RoB2,29 and 2 were at high RoB.24,38
Across trials, ESs of ITT analyses ranged from 0.41–3.08 (see
Figure S2), all statistically nonsignificant and mostly highly
imprecise. The summary ES across the RCTs was imprecise at
0.99 (95% CI 0.64–1.53). A single, high RoB NRCS reported
an HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.28–1.03) over a mean of 6.5 years of
follow-up.

Stroke
Five RCTs reported incidence of stroke after 1 or about 4 years
(see Table S11).2,24,29,35,38 Three adjusted NRCSs also

reported stroke.51,52,66 Three RCTs were
at moderate
RoB2,29,35 and 2 RCTs and the 3 NRCSs were at high
RoB.24,38,51,52,66 Across the 5 RCTs, ITT ESs ranged from
0.49–1.59, all statistically nonsignificant (see Figure S3). The
summary ES was 0.99 (95% CI 0.73–1.35). In a propensity-
score-matched analysis of adherent CPAP users, SAVE
reported a stronger ES that was just statistically significant, but
the study did not report whether this analysis was significantly
different from its primary ITT analysis. The 3 adjusted NRCSs
each reported imprecise effect estimates of stroke (summary ES
0.84; 95% CI 0.54–1.29).

Acute myocardial infarction
Five RCTs reported incidence of acute myocardial infarction
after 1 or about 4 years (see Table S12).2,24,29,35,38 Three RCTs
were at moderate RoB2,29,35 and 2 at high RoB.24,38 There was
a wide range of ES estimates from 0.25–7.38 (see Figure S5),
which were all imprecise and statistically nonsignificant. The
summary ES across the RCTs was 1.05 (95% CI 0.78–1.41).

Atrial fibrillation
Three RCTs and 2 NRCSs reported incident atrial fibrillation
between 1 and 4.8 years (see Table S16).2,29,35,52,61 Study
patients either had CVD or CV risk factors or were of older age.
All studies were at moderate RoB. The RCTs all found impre-
cise estimates of ES, ranging from 0.48–1.47. Meta-analysis
was also imprecise effect (ES 0.89, 95% CI 0.48–1.63) (see
Figure S6). The NRCSs (1 ITT and 1 as-treated) had similar
results.52,61

Composite cardiovascular outcomes
Fourteen studies (7 RCTs and 7 NRCSs) reported various com-
posite CV outcomes.2,24,28,29,31,32,35,38,52,55,60,61,65,66,68 The 7
RCTs evaluated 11 unique (but overlapping) composite CV
outcomes across 1 to about 5 years of follow-up (see Table
S17). Participant eligibility criteria varied across the 7 RCTs
including studies restricted to patients with known CVD
and studies of generally healthy patients (other than OSA).
Four RCTs were at moderate RoB2,28,29,35 and 3 at high
RoB.24,31,32,38

Summarization across the RCTs is hampered by the variable
definitions of composite outcomes (ie, which CV and related
events were included) and the variability in the underlying risk of
CV events and death, based on prior history of CVD and age.
Meta-analysis was determined to not be appropriate. With the
exception of 1 small adherer analysis RCT,28 the estimates of the
ITT effect of CPAP on composite CV events ranged from an
odds ratio of 0.42 to an HR of 1.10. Three ITT RCTs also
reported sensitivity analyses among CPAP adherers,28 which
together with the 1 small adherer analysis RCT28 all found stron-
ger ESs in the CPAP adherer analyses than in the ITT analyses,
but the differences between analyses varied across studies. Two
RCTs found no significant difference between ITT and adherers
analyses.2,24 One trial reported a large shift in HR between the
ITT analysis (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34–1.13) and the adherent
vs nonadherent and nonusers analysis (HR 0.29, 95% CI
0.10–0.86).38 Across all studies, a rough comparison between

ITT and adherent/as-treated analyses among the RCTs found no
significant difference in effect between analyses (P = .53).

Seven NRCSs evaluated 8 distinct (but overlapping) com-
posite CV outcomes (also distinct from the RCTs) at between
2.5 and 9 years of follow-up (see Table S18).52,55,60,61,65,66,68
One NRCS conducted an ITT-like analysis52; the rest evaluated
adherer analyses. All were at high RoB. The NRCSs found
adjusted HRs that mostly favored CPAP use, ranging from
0.37–1.05. The 3 NRCSs conducted in patients with preexisting
CVD68 or CV risk factors61,66 were not statistically significant,
whereas the 4 NRCSs that did not restrict eligibility based on
prior CVD history mostly were.60,65

Diabetes mellitus
Three RCTs and 1 NRCS evaluated incident type 2 diabetes
(see Table S20).2,28,29,48 No study reported on reversion to nor-
moglycemia or incidence of other hyperglycemia diagnoses
(eg, impaired glucose tolerance). Across the RCTs (all moder-
ate RoB), CPAP did not affect the risk of incident diabetes at
about 3–4 years (summary ES 1.02, 95% CI 0.69–1.51) (see
Figure S7). In contrast, in an adherers analysis, the high-RoB
NRCS found a significantly lower association between regular
CPAP use and risk of incident diabetes at about 3 years of
follow-up.48 With addition of the adjusted NRCS to the meta-
analysis, the summary ES remained nonsignificant and impre-
cise (ES 0.88, 95% CI 0.57–1.35).

Mental health
Four RCTs reported on the effect of CPAP vs no CPAP on both
depression and anxiety symptoms.18,35–37,43 No study addressed
diagnoses (or resolution) of any mental health conditions. Three
trials were at moderate RoB18,35,43 and 1 at high RoB.36,37 The
trials evaluated different depression and anxiety symptom scales
(see Table S21). Overall, depression and anxiety scores
improved over time in all studies among those using CPAP or no
CPAP. Only the SAVE trial found statistically significant rela-
tive improvements in depression and anxiety scores (after
4 years) among those receiving CPAP compared with controls.
Meta-analyses of the standardized mean differences across trials
yielded a statistically significant summary standardized mean
difference of 20.18 (95% CI 20.26 to 20.11) for depression
scores (see Figure S8) and 20.10 (95% CI 20.17 to 20.03) for
anxiety scores (see Figure S9). Both of these differences may be
interpreted as small, likely not clinically significant.

Cognitive (executive) function
Seven studies (5 RCTs22,30,34,35,45 and 2 NRCSs53,54) reported
on cognitive executive function. One RCT was at low RoB,22 2
RCTs were at moderate RoB,30,35 and 2 RCTs and both NRCSs
were at high RoB.34,45,53 The studies reported numerous speci-
fic measures of cognitive function, most of which were reported
by a single study each. One NRCS evaluated risk of incident
dementia in Medicare enrollees ≥ 65 years of age.54 In both ITT
and adherent users analyses, statistically significant fewer
CPAP users developed dementia (ITT analysis: adjusted odds
ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.69–0.89) (see Table S22).

Three studies evaluated the Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion35,45,53 and 3 studies the Trail Making Test B.30,35,53 Mini-
Mental State Examination scores improved in all study groups
(with or without CPAP) in the RCTs, on average by a small,
nonclinically significant degree (< 0.4 points) at 6 or 12 months
(see Table S23). Differences between interventions were non-
significant and small (≤ 0.1 points). The NRCS was imprecise
(see Figure S10). Similarly, Trail Making Test B scores
improved in all study groups in the RCTs, but Trail Making
Test B scores worsened after 10 years in the NRCS. There were
no differences between groups (see Figure S11).

Quality of life
Ten RCTs2,17,20,21,26,27,29,31,35,39,44 and 1 NRCS47 reported on
quality of life based on a variety of measures (see Table S24).
The NRCS evaluated adherent vs nonadherent users.47 One
RCT (that used a sham CPAP control) was at low RoB,20,21 6
RCTs were at moderate RoB,2,17,26,27,29,35 and 3 RCTs and the
NRCS were at high RoB for a variety of reasons.31,39,44,47

The studies found no clinically significant difference between
groups on the Short Form-36, assuming a minimum clinical impor-
tant difference of about 4 to 7 points.69,70 Meta-analysis of the six

RCTs that reported Short Form-36 (or Short Form-12) Physical
Component Scores (after 6 months–3.7 years) yielded a summary
net difference of 1.5 points (95% CI 20.1 to 3.2), favoring
CPAP (see Figure S12).2,17,26,27,31,39 The NRCS found a similar
net difference of 1.6 points (95% CI 20.1 to 3.3) after 2 years
(using Short Form-12).47 Meta-analysis of the 7 RCTs that
reported mean Short Form-36 Mental Component Scores found a
summary net difference of 1.2 points (95% CI 0.7–1.7), favoring
CPAP (see Figure S13).2,17,26,27,31,39,44 The NRCS found no sig-
nificant difference (20.2; 95% CI 21.9 to 1.5).47 Studies also
did not find clinically significant differences (and mostly not sta-
tistically significant) on the EuroQol-5D, Quality of Well-Being,
and Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index scales.2,20,21,27,29,31

Accidents
Two moderate-RoB RCTs reported on various accident out-
comes. Because the likelihood of accidents is probably associ-
ated with degree of sleepiness, it is worth noting that the SAVE
trial excluded patients with extreme daytime sleepiness
(Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 15), and although PREDICT
included only patients with excessive daytime sleepiness
(Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥ 9), professional drivers and people

reporting sleepiness while driving were excluded. For numer-
ous specific outcomes, the PREDICT trial35 at 1-year follow-up
and the SAVE trial2 at 3.7-year follow-up found no statistically
significant differences between groups (see Table S25).

DISCUSSION

The primary clinical question addressed by this SR—the effec-
tiveness of CPAP devices on long-term clinically important
outcomes in patients with OSA—remains largely unanswered.
Much of the evidence base is sparse and many of the studies
provided largely imprecise estimates of comparative effective-
ness, resulting in conclusions of generally low strength of evi-
dence. Thus, with low strength of evidence, RCTs do not
demonstrate that CPAP affects all-cause mortality or various
CV outcomes including composite CV events, diabetes diagno-
ses, accidents, or clinically significant effects on various mental
health and related outcomes. However, these conclusions do
not imply that CPAP has been proven to be ineffective to reduce
adverse health outcomes. It is unclear whether the failure to
find an effect of CPAP treatment on long-term health outcomes
is related to a lack of power, insufficient follow-up duration, or
due to an actual lack of effect of CPAP.

Notably, in contrast with the RCTs, the NRCSs found a statisti-
cally significant association between CPAP use (or prescription)
and decreased mortality. The NRCSs differed from the RCTs in
several important ways, in addition to study design, including lon-
ger duration of follow-up (3–11 years vs 2 to about 5 years) and
higher event rates (despite the RCTs mostly including only those
at high risk for CVD). However, the NRCSs were mostly at high
RoB related to conducting simple, often incomplete, regression
analyses, which substantially reduces the certainty that the find-
ings of the NRCSs are valid. A combined analysis of the RCTs
and NRCSs provides (low-strength) evidence that CPAP reduces
all-cause mortality. This conclusion, though, is based largely on
the high-RoB NRCS evidence base, despite their inconsistency in
magnitude and statistical significance with the RCTs.

For most categorical outcomes, ESs appear to be somewhat
stronger in the analyses of CPAP-adherent user than in the ITT
analyses (of all whom were prescribed CPAP), but almost uni-
versally the differences between analyses were not statistically
significant (both within and across studies), and the differences
were generally small. This may suggest that CPAP is ineffec-
tive, because its “effect” is equivalent among users and nonu-
sers, but
the comparisons between ITT and adherent-user
analyses suffer from a lack of power to detect a difference. Fur-
ther complicating adherent-user analyses is that patients who
choose to be adherent are intrinsically different from those who
are nonadherent (or stop using CPAP). Prior analyses have
found that patients with worse baseline AHI or Epworth Sleepi-
ness Scale scores are more likely to be adherent1; thus, to some
degree comparisons of users with nonusers may be comparisons
of more vs less severe or symptomatic OSA.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recently
commissioned a broad SR of CPAP vs no CPAP71 to support its
clinical practice guideline.72 The review included a broader

range of studies and outcomes than our review, including
lower-quality evidence such as unadjusted observational stud-
ies, short-term outcomes, and various intermediate and symp-
tom measures. Recapitulating prior reviews,1,73 they found that
CPAP reduces AHI and improves sleepiness symptoms. In
addition, the review found that CPAP improves (mostly short-
term) sleep-related, but not overall, quality of life; reduces
(mostly short-term) blood pressure (in patients with hyperten-
sion); does not reduce (mostly short-term) blood glucose (in
patients with or without type 2 diabetes); and does not improve
neurocognitive function or improve (short-term) anxiety or
depression scores by clinically significant degrees. They
reached no conclusions regarding all-cause mortality or com-
posite cardiovascular events. They ascribed differences in
effects between randomized and observational studies to aver-
age differences in CPAP adherence, but the impact of unad-
justed confounders was not considered.

For most health outcomes, an insufficient number of studies
and an insufficient number of study participants have been evalu-
ated to allow for precise estimates of effects. Few RCTs were
powered for specific health outcomes. The emphasis on compos-
ite CV outcomes in most eligible studies hampers a clear under-
standing of the effect of CPAP on specific health outcomes of
interest to patients and clinicians. Most RCTs were determined
to be at moderate risk of bias, where the primary concern was a
lack of blinding of participants or their clinicians. Acknowledg-
ing the difficulties of maintaining sham CPAP, the lack of blind-
ing raises the possibility of differences in how patients acted or
were treated based on their CPAP use. Although we restricted
inclusion of NRCSs to those with multivariable analyses, there
remain concerns that patients selected to be treated with CPAP
(or self-selected to use or comply with CPAP) are inherently dif-
ferent from patients not treated with (or not adherent with) CPAP
to such a degree that even well-adjusted analyses are biased
toward CPAP users. Only 5 NRCSs used propensity score analy-
ses (that adjust for the factors that predict for choice to use
CPAP). Nevertheless, for most outcomes, ESs from NRCSs
tended to be consistent with those from RCTs, although, particu-
larly for all-cause mortality and, to a lesser degree, composite
CV outcomes, NRCSs generally had somewhat stronger ESs that
were more likely to be statistically significant than RCTs.

OSA is a heterogenous disease with a clinical diagnosis
based on variably defined and applied criteria. Although data
are still emerging on phenotypes and endotypes of OSA and
their effect on outcomes, the variability we found in AHI
among studies and lack of long-term benefit of CPAP may indi-
cate that patients’ phenotypes or endotypes may contribute to
the decision to treat, type of treatment, and, possibly, long-term
benefits of treatment. Although we could not discern consistent
differences across studies based on their eligibility criteria,
studies used highly variable inclusion criteria (eg, based on
AHI thresholds) and exclusion criteria (eg, based on comorbid-
ities). In addition, even where OSA definitions, such as AHI
threshold, were consistent, as we describe in a separate arti-
cle,74 the criteria used to define sleep apnea indices (apnea,
hypopnea, and oxygen desaturation) were highly variable
across studies and studies did not appear to apply standard sleep
study criteria consistently. In addition, while AHI or ODI are

Systematic review of CPAP and long-term effects

used to diagnose OSA and to assess its severity, these measures
do not include the severity of arousals, autonomic imbalance,
sleep-stage fragmentation, or other consequences of sleep
apnea. The frequency of apnea (as measured by AHI) may be a
less important predictor of cardiovascular mortality than the
severity of hypoxemia as measured by the hypoxic burden.75 No
studies of long-term outcomes with CPAP treatment reported on
other measures of OSA,
including cumulative exposure to
reduced air intake during a night of sleep, duration of respiratory
events (beyond 10 seconds), the total duration of respiratory
events weighted by the oxygen desaturation that accompanies
them,76 hypoxic burden,75 or the morphology of the oxygen
desaturation events,77 among others. Patients who have similar
AHI can differ greatly in these other metrics,76,77 and AHI is gen-
erally poorly correlated with symptoms and signs of OSA.78
However, it is an open question whether definitions of OSA (and
management of CPAP) based on alternative metrics would be
more strongly correlated with long-term outcomes.

Several types of new studies and new analyses of existing
studies are needed before stronger evidence is available to allow
better clinical and policy decision-making. More in-depth
future research suggestions are included in the full report.5 Ide-
ally, large long-term RCTs are needed to assess the effective-
ness of CPAP with respect to long-term health outcomes.
Future RCTs should be adequately powered to find relatively
small differences in effect (eg, odds ratio = 0.89, the summary
estimate for death among RCTs), preferably for specific impor-
tant health outcomes (such as all-cause or cardiovascular
death), rather than nonstandardized, composite clinical event
outcomes that are difficult to interpret. Studies should be con-
tinued for a sufficient duration to allow for any real differences
to become apparent (probably more than the current maximum
duration of about 4–5 years).

Given the large effect of CPAP on sleep and breathing mea-
sures (eg, AHI) and on symptoms including sleepiness and
snoring, clinicians, patients, and institutional review boards are
increasingly skeptical about the concept of randomizing people
with “severe” OSA to long-term CPAP or no (or sham) CPAP,
despite the low strength of evidence that CPAP affects long-
term health outcomes (mostly with no effect). However, our
finding supports the conclusion of a recent panel discussion at
the 2021 American Academy of Sleep Medicine meeting that
highlighted that there is clinical equipoise regarding CPAP use
for CV and other outcomes, even for patients with excessive day-
time sleepiness (which, it was noted, may improve with simple
advice and training, regardless of OSA treatment).79 Pertinent
suggestions were offered to make future RCTs more efficient
and effective, including use of an adaptive study design, in which
study eligibility criteria and analysis plans adapt to information
accrued during the trial and interim analyses.80,81 Future RCTs
are, thus, feasible, necessary, and appropriate to determine the
effect of CPAP on long-term health outcomes. In addition, as a
complement to RCT evidence, careful observational studies
can inform the evidence base and may enable the RCTs to be
maximally informative. Priority should be given to evaluating
observational data using state-of-the-science causally explicit
analyses, such as propensity score analysis methods to ade-
quately adjust for confounders and minimize bias.82,83

In conclusion, although prior reviews have substantiated bene-
fits of CPAP on symptoms such as sleepiness, along with inter-
mediate (eg, blood pressure) and short-term sleep-related quality
of life,1,73 RCTs have not found significant effects of CPAP on
long-term health outcomes for adults with OSA, including all-
cause mortality, various CV events, or incident diabetes or clini-
cally significant effects on mental health measures (all with low
strength of evidence). The effect of CPAP on other long-term
health outcomes from RCTs is unclear due to insufficient evi-
dence related to sparse studies and/or highly imprecise estimates.
Inclusion of evidence from adjusted NRCSs mostly does not alter
these conclusions, except that when considering NRCS evidence
there is low strength of evidence that CPAP reduces the risk of
all-cause death with longer-term follow-up. Given the low
strength of evidence across outcomes, future needed studies may
substantially alter these conclusions.
