Primary health professionals are well positioned to support the delivery of patient self-man-
agement in an evidence-based, structured capacity. A need exists to better understand the
active components required for effective self-management support, how these might be
delivered within primary care, and the training and system changes that would subsequently
be needed.

Objectives

(1) To examine self-management support interventions in primary care on health outcomes
for a wide range of diseases compared to usual standard of care; and (2) To identify the
effective strategies that facilitate positive clinical and humanistic outcomes in this setting.

Method

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating self-management support
interventions was conducted following the Cochrane handbook & PRISMA guidelines. Pub-
lished literature was systematically searched from inception to June 2019 in PubMed, Sco-
pus and Web of Science. Eligible studies assessed the effectiveness of individualized
interventions with follow-up, delivered face-to-face to adult patients with any condition in pri-
mary care, compared with usual standard of care. Matrices were developed that mapped
the evidence and components for each intervention. The methodological quality of included
studies were appraised.

Funding: The authors received no specific funding
for this work.

Results

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.

6,510 records were retrieved. 58 studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis.
Findings reveal a structured patient-provider exchange is required in primary care (including

a one-on-one patient-provider consultation, ongoing follow up and provision of self-help
materials). Interventions should be tailored to patient needs and may include combinations
of strategies to improve a patient’s disease or treatment knowledge; independent monitoring
of symptoms, encouraging self-treatment through a personalized action plan in response
worsening symptoms or exacerbations, psychological coping and stress management strat-
egies, and enhancing responsibility in medication adherence and lifestyle choices. Follow-
up may include tailored feedback, monitoring of progress with respect to patient set health-
care goals, or honing problem-solving and decision-making skills. Theoretical models pro-
vided a strong base for effective SMS interventions. Positive outcomes for effective SMS
included improvements in clinical indicators, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy (confi-
dence to self-manage), disease knowledge or control. An SMS model has been developed
which sets the foundation for the design and evaluation of practical strategies for the con-
struct of self-management support interventions in primary healthcare practice.

Conclusions

These findings provide primary care professionals with evidence-based strategies and
structure to deliver SMS in practice. For this collaborative partnership approach to be more
widely applied, future research should build on these findings for optimal SMS service
design and upskilling healthcare providers to effectively support patients in this collaborative
process.

Introduction

Internationally, healthcare systems are challenged with the rising rates of chronic and complex
illness and the clinical and economic burden associated represents a major challenge to the
optimal provision of healthcare [1]. Health systems need to accommodate changes to meet the
increasing need for health services. Evidence suggests that leveraging the potential of people to
care for themselves and involving patients in decisions affecting their health is beneficial, par-
ticularly on the increasing rates of primary care consultations and health system pressures [2].
A key issue that needs to be addressed is how primary health care professionals (HCPs) can
support self-management in an evidence-based, structured way and how self-management
processes can be integrated into clinical practice, as models of care evolve to deliver a person-
centred approach. Patient participation is suggested to narrow the gap between the dichoto-
mous roles of patient and HCP [3]. Patient participation involves being engaged in the plan-
ning of care and exchanging knowledge, setting own goals and carrying out self-management
activities [3]. This partnership has been suggested as valuable in the support of the manage-
ment and control of symptoms, particularly for patients with chronic health conditions [4].
Self-management strategies are increasingly recognized as an essential component of chronic
disease management and secondary prevention [5], individually tailored to patient prefer-
ences, prior knowledge and circumstances, supporting patient participation in their care [6].

Self-management support (SMS) is viewed in two ways: (1) as a portfolio of techniques and
tools that help patients choose healthy behaviours, and (2) as a fundamental transformation of
the patient-professional relationship into a collaborative partnership [7]. SMS encompasses
more than a didactic, instructional program and goes beyond simple dissemination of infor-
mation or disease state management. The pivotal objective of SMS is to change behaviour

within a collaborative arrangement to produce sustainable effects. This can be achieved by
increasing patients’ skills and confidence in managing their disease state through regular
assessment of progress and problems, goal setting, and problem-solving support [8]. Simply
put, patients and HCPs work to develop tangible and realistic healthcare goals, while HCPs
can assist with the development of the skill set necessary to achieve these goals and monitor for
improvements in patient health [9]. Lorig and Holman [10] identify a generic set of skills
proven successful for effective self-management, including (1) problem-solving; (2) decision-
making; (3) resource utilization; (4) forming a patient-health care provider partnership; and
(5) taking action. Acquisition of these skills leads to increased self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers
to beliefs in one’s capabilities to execute a behaviour or course of action necessary to reach a
desired goal [10, 11].

There is a growing body of evidence that shows supporting people to self-manage their
health and care can lead to improvements in clinical and humanistic outcomes [12–18], reduc-
ing the economic impact of chronic disease and a means of contributing to the sustainability
of the global healthcare system. Supporting people to self-manage has resulted in reduced use
of general practitioners, reduced admissions to hospital, significant gains in health status and
increased symptom control [19, 20]. Interventions have targeted patients with arthritis [21],
asthma [22], chronic heart failure (CHF) [23], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
[24], type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [25, 26], hypertension (HT) [27] and patients on oral
anticoagulation [28]. Self-management support interventions vary in the literature with
increasing evaluations of peer-led, lay-led, or non-health professional-led, web-based and
group-based interventions. For example, the generic Chronic Disease Self-Management Pro-
gram, a non-health professional group-delivered intervention remains the most widely
adopted self-management support program internationally [29].

Primary HCPs are typically an individuals’ first point of contact with the health system
[30], and are continuing contacts for people with chronic disease. This opens up substantial
opportunities to effect sustainable changes through supporting self-management and delivery
of more personalized healthcare services. There is an increasing number and uptake of pri-
mary care services which require HCPs to be patient-oriented however none of the education
provided appears to include any theoretical framework or evidence-based structure for provid-
ers to effectively support self-management and facilitate patient behaviour change. Impor-
tantly, HCPs need to acquire the competencies not only to identify the techniques and tools
for specific patients but to ensure that patients acquire the skills to self-manage. Kennedy et al.
recommends a whole systems approach, which integrates SMS at the level of the patient, HCP,
and service organizations, which has proven effective in improving outcomes for patients [31].
Effective implementation is profoundly important to ensure viability and sustainability, and
potential scale-up. In some countries, governments have developed health policy and funding
alignment for self-management support with the aim of improving health outcomes and allevi-
ating pressures on the wider health system [32].

While the role of primary HCPs in delivering SMS is highlighted in the literature, there
remains a gap in research regarding the specific strategies and active components of interven-
tions used by providers resulting in better health outcomes for patients. A need exists to better
understand how these might be delivered within primary care, what outcomes can be achieved,
and the training and system changes needed as a result. This gap increases the challenge of
providing consistent SMS in primary care, and enabling the appropriate evaluation of SMS tri-
als. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence of effective-
ness for SMS interventions delivered face-to-face in primary care practice, and identify
evidence-based strategies with active components facilitating positive clinical and humanistic
patient outcomes.

Enhancing the delivery of self-management support in primary health care: A systematic review

Methods

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating SMS interventions was con-
ducted following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We have
reported the review according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [33, 34]. Details of the protocol for this systematic review can
be found in the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews database
(registration CRD42017062639).

Search strategy

The research question (using PICO) and search strategy were developed and reviewed by three
authors (SDG, VGC, SB) to identify studies for this review. In a preliminary scoping search of
databases, we as a group of authors identified ten key papers which were suitable to be included
in the review. In the multiple search strategies all authors were involved. We tested and refined
our strategies as a group, which ensured reproducibility of key papers within search results and
a robust search strategy. The detailed search strategy for different electronic databases can be
found in S1 Table. A comprehensive search was undertaken in three databases using PubMed,
Scopus and Web of Science and search strategies were refined for each individual database.
Multiple databases were searched to adequately identify all literature relevant to the research
question. Published literature was systematically searched from inception to June 2019. Neither
publication date nor publication type filters were used. Citation searching was also conducted
to find articles cited by other publications. Searches of grey literature and reference lists of previ-
ous systematic reviews complemented our literature search to ensure all relevant studies were
captured. The complete results from all databases were imported and managed in a unique End-
Note X9 library upon search completion and saved without duplication.

Data extraction, management and synthesis

The review team were responsible for assessing the trials’ eligibility using the methods out-
lined. The lead reviewer (SDG) screened by title and abstract to select relevant publications. A
second and third reviewer (VGC, SB) were consulted throughout this process if an article
could not be rejected with certainty. Any disagreement among the reviewers throughout this
process were resolved by discussion and consensus. All authors (SDG, VGC, KW, SB) agreed
on the final texts for inclusion. Full texts were assessed for eligibility according to inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-
randomized controlled trials (c-RCTs) assessing SMS interventions with follow-up, delivered
by primary HCPs, face-to-face to adult patients with any condition, compared to usual stan-
dard of care. The types of interventions included in the review were multicomponent interven-
tions aimed at supporting patient self-management. Jonkman et al’s definition of SMS
interventions was applied for the purposes of selection of interventions for inclusion in this
review [35]. This definition includes the wide range of components considered for ‘self-man-
agement interventions’. Self-management interventions are defined as [35]:

“Interventions that aim to equip patients with skills to actively participate and take responsibility
in the management of their chronic condition. This includes knowledge acquisition, and a combina-
tion of at least two of the following: (1) stimulation of independent sign and/or symptom monitoring;
(2) medication management; (3) enhancing problem-solving and decision-making skills for treat-
ment or disease management; (4) or changing physical activity, dietary and/or smoking behaviour”.
Excluded studies were: (1) non-randomized controlled study designs; (2) interventions not

meeting Jonkman’s definition of self-management support; (3) interventions not delivered
face-to-face (i.e. web-based interventions); (4) group-delivered interventions; (5) study

populations under 18 years of age; (6) interventions delivered in settings other than primary
care; (7) interventions delivered by non-HCPs (i.e. lay, peer-led); (8) studies without usual
standard of care as comparator; (9) studies written in a language other than English or Spanish;
or (10) non-primary research articles (i.e. literature reviews, study protocols).

Authors kept a record of the number of trials included or excluded from the review at each
stage of the assessment process. Multiple papers of the same study were linked together. Study
design, setting, methods, participant characteristics, type of intervention, content, duration
and intensity of components, follow up, and study findings were extracted using a tailored
data extraction form developed for data retrieval using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions [36] and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care
Group (EPOC) data collection form [37] and checklist [38].

Matrices were developed mapping both evidence and active components for each self-man-
agement intervention. Outcome indicators were independently extracted, tabulated and grouped
using the following categories of outcome measures, including (1) disease specific indicators; (2)
self-efficacy; (3) health-related quality of life; (4) functional status and disability; (5) psychological
functioning; (6) disease knowledge; (7) behaviours and self-management activities. Components
were categorized according to Jonkman’s definition of SMS interventions [35], including strate-
gies for: (1) condition or treatment knowledge acquisition; (2) active stimulation of symptom
monitoring; (3) self-treatment through the use of an action plan; (4) enhancing resource utiliza-
tion; (5) enhancing problem-solving and/ or decision-making skills; (6) enhancing stress man-
agement or emotional coping with condition; (7) enhancing physical activity; (8) enhancing
dietary intake; (9) enhancing smoking cessation; and (10) medication management or adherence.
Given the heterogeneity of the studies regarding participants, varying healthcare setting, strategies
and outcome measures, no formal quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis could be conducted.

Assessment of risk of bias

The methodological quality of studies were appraised using the ‘Suggested risk of bias criteria
for EPOC reviews’ tool in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook [39]. Domains of bias
included in the final assessment, were: (1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation conceal-
ment; (3) similarities on baseline outcome measurements; (4) similarities on baseline charac-
teristics; (5) completeness of outcome data; (6) blinding (participants, personnel); (7)
protection against contamination; (8) selective outcome reporting; and (9) other risks of bias.
Studies were assessed by domain as ’low risk’ or ’high risk’ of bias. Domains were ‘unclear risk’
if too few details were available to make an acceptable judgement of ‘high’ or ‘low’ risk. A sec-
ond and third reviewer (VGC, SB) were consulted throughout this process if decisions could
not be made with certainty. Any disagreement among the reviewers throughout this process
were resolved by discussion and consensus. Three categories of study quality were identified
by study authors according to each study’s methodological characteristics. In high-quality
studies, the majority of criteria were fulfilled and done well (low risk of bias in at least six crite-
rion), while in low-quality studies, the majority of criteria were not done or done poorly (high
risk of bias in at least five criterion); other situations were considered medium quality [40]. No
papers were excluded as a result of quality assessment.

Study selection

6,510 citations were retrieved. After the removal of duplicates, 4,831 records were screened by
title and abstract. After review of full texts, fifty-eight RCTs/c-RCTs (reported in 80 citations)
fulfilled the review criteria and were included in this systematic review (see flow diagram in

individual studies are provided in S3 Table.

Description of studies

The included studies originated from 18 countries, predominantly the United Kingdom (UK)
and the United States (US). The conditions most frequently targeted included T2DM (37.9%;
n = 22), COPD (20.7%; n = 12) and depression (13.8%; n = 8) (Table 1). Settings primarily
reported were general practice (48.3%; n = 28), primary care clinics (25.9%; n = 15) and com-
munity pharmacies (10.3%; n = 6). Interventions were delivered largely by general practition-
ers or nurses, commonly specialising in areas such as respiratory, diabetes and mental health.
SMS interventions in fourteen studies were delivered in primary care teams involving more
than one health care professional from different disciplines (24.1%; n = 14).

Study outcomes

Ninety-three different outcome measures were adopted by studies. Clinical outcome measures
associated with a particular condition were typically reported (e.g. clinical outcomes such as

changes in blood pressure or HbA1c levels). Humanistic outcomes sought to measure physical,
social and psychological functioning and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
Others captured changes in self-efficacy. Results were classified by outcome and method of
assessment (summarised in S4 Table relative to key findings).

Impact of interventions on outcomes

The overall impact of interventions on clinical and humanistic outcomes are illustrated in
Table 2.

Disease specific outcomes. Forty four RCTs examined the impact of interventions on dis-

ease specific outcomes [42–57, 60, 70, 71, 76, 78, 79, 82, 85–87, 102, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112,
114, 115, 118]. Disease specific outcomes were most commonly reported in studies evaluating
interventions targeting patients with T2DM (e.g. changes in HbA1c, weight, blood pressure
and lipids), COPD (e.g. changes in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)), courses of antibiotics, oral
corticosteroids and frequency of exacerbations), asthma (e.g. PEF, symptoms, inhalation tech-
nique, number of exacerbations and nocturnal awakenings), binge eating disorders (e.g. fre-
quency of episodes and purging) and osteoarthritis (OA) (e.g. pain intensity, level of fatigue
and use of pain medication). Seventeen studies targeting diabetes reported mean changes in
HbA1c, with seven reporting significant improvements in the intervention compared to usual
care [42, 46, 47, 50, 52, 53, 56, 109, 112]. Goudswaard et al. [42] reported a decrease in HbA1c
at six weeks by 0.7% more (95% CI 0.1, 1.4) in those receiving the intervention when compared
with control. The intervention evaluated by Adachi et al. [50] for patients with T2DM resulted

in a 0.7% decrease in HbA1c at six months in the intervention group (n = 100) compared with
a 0.2% decrease in the control group (n = 93) (difference −0.5%, 95% CI: -0.2%, −0.8%;

Three RCTs reported on the level of asthma control and symptoms [80–82]. Mehuys et al.
measured the level of asthma control using the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a clinically vali-
dated measure [81]. While mean ACT scores did not change from baseline for both study
groups, a subgroup analysis of patients having insufficiently controlled asthma at baseline
showed the intervention group had significantly increased ACT scores after six months (mean
ACT change from baseline in the intervention group was +2.3 and +0.3 in the control group
(mean difference 2.0, 95% CI: 0.1, 3.9; p = 0.038). The need for rescue medication was reduced
in both groups from baseline, however a significantly higher reduction in the intervention
group (-0.56 and -0.57 inhalations per day at three and six-month follow-up, respectively) was
reported against control (-0.03 and -0.43 inhalations per day at three and six-month follow-up,
respectively; p = 0.012) [81]. Six studies reported on COPD-specific outcomes [64, 65, 68–71,

naire (SGRQ) as the primary outcome measure. The intervention also showed no effect on
self-reported outcomes including the frequency of use of antibiotic courses and oral corticoste-
roids over 12 months [64].

Interventions targeting eating disorders were evaluated in four RCTs [41, 92, 93, 97, 103,

from the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Intention-to-treat (ITT) anal-
yses revealed significant improvements in psychological symptoms at the end of the interven-
tion compared with control, reduction in mean frequency of binge-eating episodes by 60% in
intervention and 6% in control, and remission from all binge-eating and compensatory behav-
iours in 28% of the intervention and 11% of control. Treatment gains were maintained at three
and six-month follow-up [97].

An intervention targeting patients with OA measured primary outcomes of pain intensity,

physical functioning, self-efficacy, psychological distress, use of pain coping strategies, cata-
strophizing and HRQOL [84]. ITT analyses were performed on primary outcomes at baseline,
post-treatment, 6 and 12 month follow-up which yielded significant group differences, indicat-
ing improvement in pain intensity (F(3,233) = 2.75, p = 0.044), physical functioning (F(3,233)
= 3.11, p = 0.027), psychological distress (F(3,233) = 2.83, p = 0.039), use of pain coping strate-
gies (F(3,233) = 4.97, p = 0.002), and self-efficacy (F(3,232) = 10.59, p< 0.001) in intervention,
compared with control. All outcomes, except for self-efficacy, were maintained at 12-month
follow-up while effects on self-efficacy degraded over time [84].

Health-related quality of life. Twenty-four RCTs examined the impact of interventions
on HRQOL [31, 54, 56, 57, 60, 61, 64–66, 69, 71, 73, 74, 76, 81–84, 90–92, 94, 96, 98, 101, 102,
108, 113, 117]. The method of assessment varied and included general HRQOL questionnaires
such as the SF-12 survey questionnaire and EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire. Disease specific
QOL measures were also identified including the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales Short
Form questionnaire (AIMS2-SF) [119], Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Question-
naire (IBSQOL) [120], Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQOL) [121] and the
standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) [122]. Eight studies reported sig-
nificant improvements in HRQOL [56, 66, 71, 82, 90–92, 96, 113, 117]. Efraimsson et al. [66]
evaluated the effects of COPD self-management delivered at a nurse-led primary health care
clinic. HRQOL, measured using the SGRQ, was improved by an average value of 8.2 units
(from 30.6) in the intervention group, whereas no change was noted in control. Differences
between groups were clinically relevant and statistically significant (p = 0.00030) [66]. Heit-
kemper et al. [91] examined the effect of an IBS SMS intervention on HRQOL using the Irrita-
ble Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life questionnaire (IBSQOL), a 30-item questionnaire.
Compared to usual care, participants receiving the intervention demonstrated statistically sig-
nificant improvements in QOL, increasing by 10.6 units, 12.8 units and 12.2 units at nine
weeks, six and twelve-months, respectively. Changes persisted at 12-month follow-up
(p<0.001) [91].

Physical, psychological or social functioning. Physical, mental or social functioning
were measured in 25 RCTs [31, 43, 44, 47, 54, 56–58, 60–64, 68, 72–76, 79, 84–97, 100, 102,
108, 111–115, 117]. Psychological symptoms and social functioning using the CORE-OM scale
[123] were measured in three studies [74, 75, 100]. Psychological functioning was measured
using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scale
[124] in eight studies [72, 75, 84, 92–94, 97, 100, 108, 117]. Williams et al. [75] reported lower
mean BDI-II scores in the intervention group at four months (2.6 to 7.9; mean difference 5.3
points, p<0.001). At twelve-month follow-up, there were also significantly higher proportions
of participants achieving a 50% reduction in BDI-II in the intervention arm compared to

control [75]. The Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID), a brief self-report scale [125], was
used to evaluate diabetes-related distress. Sturt et al. [44] reported a reduction by 4.5 points in
mean PAID scores at follow-up (95% CI: −8.1, −1.0), indicating lowered diabetes-related dis-
tress after a nurse-delivered intervention compared with control (p = 0.012), however this dif-
ference was considered a small effect [44]. Physical functioning was assessed with the SF-36PF
scale [126] by Friedberg et al. [94, 108] evaluating a chronic fatigue self-management interven-
tion. No significant changes in scores by time, treatment group, or diagnostic group were
revealed (p>0.05) [94, 108].

Patient self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was assessed using a number of validated instruments
including the General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES-12) [127], Diabetes Management Self Efficacy
Scale (DMSE) [128] and the Arthritis Self Efficacy Scale (an eight item scale measuring
patients’ perceived ability to perform specific behaviours aimed at controlling arthritis pain
and disability) [129], the COPD self-efficacy scale (CSES) [130], among others. Self-manage-
ment and patient enablement were measured by the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI)
[87]. Changes in perceived self-efficacy were reported in 14 studies [31, 44, 54, 57, 68, 69, 73,
76–78, 84, 87, 98, 99, 102, 104, 110, 111, 116]. Sturt et al. showed self-efficacy scores were 11.2
points higher on the DMSE (95% CI: 4.4, 18.0) in the intervention group compared with the
control group following a structured intervention delivered by practice nurses in the UK
(p = 0.0014) [44]. Broderick et al. [84] reported significant improvement in self-efficacy (F
(3,232) = 10.59, p = 0.001) following a nurse-practitioner delivered intervention for OA
patients, however this was not maintained at 12-month follow up (p = 0.158). Seven RCTs
reported non-significant improvements in self-efficacy [54, 57, 59, 68, 69, 77, 78, 98, 102, 105,
110, 111, 116]. Bischoff et al. found no statistically significant changes in CSES scores at 24
months [69]. Smit et al. [77, 116] assessed self-efficacy in controlling depressive symptoms and
preventing future episodes, using the Depression Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) [131]. No statisti-
cally significant differences between groups were revealed at 12-month follow-up [77, 116].
Eikelenboom et al. reported no significant difference in PAM-13 scores (measure of patient
activation [132]) between control and intervention arms at six-month follow-up [59, 105].

Self-management behaviours. Behaviours commonly measured were diet, physical activ-
ity, medication adherence and smoking. Five studies reported on level of physical activity [41,
59, 83, 88, 103, 105]. A range of measures included the International Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF) [133], Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire
(RAPA) [134] and The Physician-based Assessment and Counselling for Physical Activity
(PACE) questionnaire [135]. No significant between group differences were reported for phys-
ical activity in 4 RCTs [41, 59, 65, 83, 103, 105]. There was evidence in one study to suggest
self-reported exercise participation was higher 1-week post-intervention (p<0.001) however
differences were no longer significant at seven-week follow-up [88]. Self-care activities within
7 days were measured in 4 RCTs [41, 52, 54, 60, 102, 103] using the Summary of Diabetes Self-
Care Activities (SDSCA) questionnaire, a brief self-report instrument for measuring levels of
self-management in diabetes (‘general diet’, ‘specific diet’, ‘physical exercise’, ‘foot care’ and
‘smoking’) [136]. Mehuys et al. reported significant improvements in self-management activi-
ties in the domains of ‘specific diet’ (+0.5 day/week, p = 0.008), ‘physical exercise’ (+0.4 day/
week, p = 0.006), and ‘foot care’ (+1.0 day/week, p<0.001) for intervention patients. There
were significant between-study group differences in the domains ‘physical exercise’ (p = 0.045)
and ‘foot care’ (p<0.001), however the between-group difference for ‘specific diet’ were non-
significant [52].

Disease knowledge. Nine studies reported disease knowledge as an outcome [52, 66–68,
71, 81, 82, 88, 93, 111]. Two RCTs [67, 68, 111], measured COPD disease knowledge using the
Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ) [137]. Hill et al. reported the results of the

Enhancing the delivery of self-management support in primary health care: A systematic review

BCKQ for each domain in both groups. Compared with baseline measures, the total Bristol
COPD knowledge Questionnaire score increased from 27.6 ± 8.7 to 36.5 ± 7.7 points
(p<0.001) in the intervention group, and unchanged in the control group (29.6 ± 7.9 to
30.2 ± 7.2; p = 0.51) [67].

Intervention components and theoretical underpinnings

Each of the studies described interventions including multiple core components (see S5 Table
for full component breakdown). Providing knowledge about the condition or treatment
(100%; n = 58), enhancing patients role in making lifestyle changes (71.9%; n = 41), develop-
ment of a self-management or action plan (45.6%; n = 26), keeping logs of self-monitoring
(43.9%; n = 25), strategies for psychological coping with conditions (43.9%; n = 25), enhancing
problem-solving and/or decision-making skills (42.1%; n = 24) and medication adherence or
management (36.8%; n = 21) were most prominently detected (Table 3). Interventions target-
ing heart disease, irritable bowel disease (IBD) and asthma reported the highest number of
self-management components. Self-treatment through the use of an action plan, enhancing
medication adherence and smoking cessation components were frequently seen in studies
evaluating interventions targeting COPD. Similarly, SMS components targeting T2DM com-
monly included strategies to stimulate symptom monitoring, making positive lifestyle
improvements with physical activity or dietary improvements. In contrast, interventions for
depression included components focusing on patients’ role in managing stress, problem-solv-
ing and strategies for coping with conditions.

Overall, sixteen studies explicitly reported a theoretical framework underpinning the inter-

vention (28.1%; n = 16) including Cognitive Behavioural Theory (17.5%; n = 10) [58, 74, 75,
84, 90–94, 100], Social Cognitive Theory (3.5%; n = 2) [79, 104], Prochaska and DiClementes’
Transtheoretical model of the Stages of Change (3.5%; n = 2) [51, 55, 66, 82], Social Learning
Theory (1.8%, n = 1) [44], Normalization Process Theory [31] and Implementation Intention
Theory (1.8%; n = 1) [104]. Intervention fidelity was reported in 21 studies (27.6%; n = 16).
Training of primary care provider to deliver SMS. 70.7% (n = 41) of studies included
upskilling of HCPs to deliver the intervention. Training aimed at enhancing aspects of patient
self-efficacy including mastery achievements, positive learning, adjustment to stress, verbal
encouragement and outcome expectations. Intervention approaches were underpinned by the
use of core communication skills to build trust and rapport in the patient-provider

relationship, and as such providers were trained in areas including active listening, non-verbal
communication, reflection, empathy and affirmation. Studies reported the provision of HCP
resources to support self-management, e.g. written material or manuals, feedback on care
reports, video demonstrations or case studies, and tools to assess patient support needs and
priorities (PRISMS).

Interventions reporting positive findings for clinical and humanistic
measures

Thirteen RCTs targeting a range of conditions including asthma, T2DM, COPD, recurrent
binge eating, chronic fatigue, major depression, low self-esteem, IBS and depression reported
positive findings for all clinical and humanistic outcome measures (Table 4) [42, 66, 67, 72, 75,
80, 91, 92, 95, 100, 117].

A mean of five self-management components (SD 1.7) were included in effective interven-

tions. Elements most frequently reported to enhance the patient’s role in self-management
included information provision (100.0%; n = 13), enhancing problem-solving or decision-
making skills (76.9%; n = 10), active stimulation of symptom monitoring (46.2%; n = 6), medi-
cation management or adherence (46,2%; n = 6), strategies for stress or psychological

management of condition (46.2%; n = 6) or enhancing dietary intake (46.2%; n = 6). The total
duration of interventions ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Initial consultations were on average 62
minutes (SD 13.8). Follow-up was delivered face-to-face in 11 interventions (84.6%; n = 11),
and two studies reported telephone follow up (15.4%; n = 2). Studies reported mean of five fol-
low-up sessions (SD 3.6) on average, ranging from 1 to 12 sessions. Mean duration of follow
up sessions were 57 minutes (SD 18.5). Individuals were provided self-help support materials
or resources in majority of interventions (92.3%; n = 12). Accompanying patient materials
provided in addition to face-to-face sessions included manuals, information or educational
booklets to work through at home, personalized treatment or action plans, devices and diaries
for self-monitoring, goal setting forms or individualized dietary plans. Six RCTs incorporated
a theoretical underpinning in their intervention: cognitive behavioral theory (30.8%; n = 4)
and Prochaska and DiClementes’ transtheoretical model of the stages of change (15.4%; n = 2).
Five integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into their intervention (38.5%; n = 5).

Barbanel et al. [80] and Goudswaard et al. [42] targeted asthma and T2DM respectively and

produced positive improvements in clinical outcomes. The SMS intervention evaluated by
Barbanel et al. [80] examined the impact of a self-management program delivered by commu-
nity pharmacists on asthma control. Intervention participants received self-management sup-
port from the pharmacist with weekly telephone follow-up for 3 months. This included a
review of inhaler technique, skills including monitoring of peak flow, and a personalized
action plan for worsening symptoms or exacerbations. Symptom scores improved in the inter-
vention group and marginally worsened in the control group to 20.3 (4.2) and 28.1 (3.5),
respectively (p<0.001; adjusted difference = 7.0 (95% CI: 4.4, 9.5). Goudswaard et al. [42] eval-
uated long-term effects of nurse-delivered self-management education in type 2 diabetics. The
intervention focused on medication adherence, enhancing physical exercise, dietary intake
and self-monitoring blood glucose at home. Six sessions were provided at intervals of 3–6
weeks, resulting in contact time of approximately 2.5 hours with HCPs over 6 months. HbA1c
levels improved from 8.2% to 7.2% in the intervention group and 8.8% to 8.4% in usual care at
6 weeks, however this result was not sustained at 18 months [42].

Efraimsson et al. [66] examined effects of nurse-led COPD intervention. Patients received
education on self-care ability to cope with disease and treatment. Patients were scheduled for
two visits with nurses lasting 60 minutes during a 5-month period. A statistically significant
increase was noted in the intervention group on QOL, the proportion of patients who ceased
smoking, and patients’ knowledge about COPD at 3–5 month follow up, compared with usual
care. Heitkemper et al. [91] examined an intervention delivered to women with IBS. Women
in the intervention received eight weekly 1-hour individual sessions. The intervention
included education, dietary counselling, symptom monitoring, relaxation training and cogni-
tive-behavioral strategies including anger management, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness
and social skills training [91]. Hill et al. [67] examined an intervention in people with COPD.
Intervention participants attended two one-to-one 60-minute sessions, focusing on enhancing
self-efficacy. Sessions were accompanied by a written manual adapted from the "Living Well
with COPD" program. COPD knowledge increased from 27.6 (+/- 8.7) to 36.5 (+/- 7.7) in the
intervention group, which was greater than any difference seen in the control group. Waite
et al. [100] examined an individualized intervention for patients with low self-esteem. This
included goal setting, learning skills to re-evaluate anxious and self-critical thoughts and beliefs
through cognitive techniques. All participants were given a three-part self-help workbook in
addition to individual treatment sessions. The intervention showed significantly better func-
tioning than control on measures of overall functioning and depression and had fewer psychi-
atric diagnoses at the end of treatment. All treatment gains were maintained at follow-up
assessment. Williams et al. [75] evaluated a guided self-help intervention for depression in

primary care. The first appointment focused on an introduction to the use of the self-help
materials. Three additional face-to-face support sessions of approximately 40 minutes were
provided on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores
were lower in the intervention group at 4 months by 5.3 points, compared with control (2.6 to
7.9, p = 0.001). There were also significantly higher proportions of intervention participants
achieving a 50% reduction in BDI-II scores at 4 and 12 months.

McLean et al. [82] involved a pharmacist-delivered intervention for asthma self-manage-
ment. The intervention involved education surrounding the basic concepts of disease, medica-
tions, trigger identification and avoidance, and an asthma action plan. Patients were taught to
use a peak flow meter, spacer devices, calendars/diaries were provided and asked to record
peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) regularly for the course of the study period. Patients
received appointments of approximately one hour in length with a pharmacist in a private
counselling area every two to three weeks for at least three appointments, and then follow-up
appointments at least quarterly for 12 months [82]. Symptom scores decreased by 50%
(p<0.05) and peak flow readings increased by 11% (p = 0.0002) for intervention patients, com-
pared to those receiving usual care. Chalder et al. [95] evaluated the efficacy of a self-help
booklet and advice delivered by a nurse in reducing chronic fatigue in adult patients. The
intervention reiterated self-monitoring and maintaining symptom diaries. Basic cognitive
techniques such as identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts were also introduced. The
self-help group showed significantly greater improvements in fatigue (p = 0.01) and psycho-
logical distress (p<0.01) than controls. Striegel-Moore et al. [92, 117] evaluated cognitive beha-
vioural guided self-help for the treatment of recurrent binge eating. Intervention participants
received 8 sessions over 12 weeks. The primary focus of this intervention was on developing a
regular pattern of moderate eating using self-monitoring and problem-solving. The main out-
come, abstinence from binge eating differed significantly between the groups: the initial
improvement in abstinence from baseline was greater for the intervention group than usual
care (p<0.001). Watkins et al. [72] evaluated guided self-help concreteness training as an inter-
vention for major depression. During the initial session of the self-help intervention, psycho-
education and training exercises were provided. During the follow-up telephone sessions,
feedback, guidance and encouragement was provided to ensure accurate use of exercises, and
progress monitored. The intervention resulted in significantly fewer depressive symptoms
post-treatment, relative to treatment as usual (ITT, p = 0.006, effect size d for change in Hamil-
ton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) = 0.76; PP, p<0.0001, d = 1.06).

Quality risk of bias assessment of individual studies

The overall methodological quality was considered high (lower risk of bias) in 41.4% of studies
(n = 24 RCTs), and of medium quality in 58.6% of studies (n = 34 RCTs). The domains consid-
ered lowest risk of bias were selective reporting (96.6%; n = 56), baseline outcome measures
(84.5%; n = 49), random sequence generation (79.3%; n = 46) and baseline characteristics
(79.3%; n = 46). The domains with higher risk of bias were ‘blinding of outcome assessment’
(25.9% of studies; n = 15). Reporting bias was judged low for more than 95% of studies. Half of
studies (51.7%; n = 30) presented low risk for the domain ‘other bias’. Reasons for other risk of
bias included not meeting recruitment targets for assumed power. Fig 2 shows aggregate
appraisal of risk of bias of included studies and visual representation of each domain.

adult patients, with any condition, compared to usual standard of care. We describe effective
SMS interventions and have highlighted their active elements, identified trends in combina-
tions of intervention strategies, range of outcomes measured and the magnitude of effect size.
This review demonstrates that SMS interventions delivered face-to-face by primary HCPs,
which are multicomponent and tailored to explicitly enhance patient self-management skill set
can lead to improvements in clinical and humanistic outcomes. The various tools and strate-
gies that provide a structure to interventions delivered face-to-face include adapting interven-
tions according to patients’ readiness to change, action planning and goal setting by
collaboratively breaking down individual health goals into small achievable actions. The effec-
tiveness of multicomponent SMS interventions is not surprising. But it raises the question of
how to focus efforts on the best combination of active components within interventions. The
variation in context, outcome measures, training methodology used across the 58 studies, in
addition to the high degree of autonomy given to providers, deem the evaluation of SMS inter-
ventions more difficult.

Ninety-three different outcome measures were adopted to demonstrate evaluated impact of

the various interventions and presumably were selected to reflect expected outcomes or pro-
cesses of self-management. These include different measures of health-related quality of life,
overall functioning, self-efficacy, health behaviours, disease knowledge, symptoms and disease
control. Disease specific clinical indicators were mostly included as primary outcomes, and
QoL indicators generally served as secondary or ancillary outcomes to primary outcome crite-
ria. Generic HRQOL measures varied across different types of diseases, interventions and
groups (i.e. EQ5D, SF-12), and specific HRQOL disease measures were also utilized. (i.e. IBS-
QOL questionnaire was used to measure changes in HRQOL for IBS patients). Further exami-
nation of studies producing positive improvements in HRQOL revealed use of disease specific
measures (i.e. Ferrone et al. [71] reported positive changes in HRQOL using the Clinical
COPD Questionnaire (CCQ)—a 10-item, health-related quality of life questionnaire). Interest-
ingly, studies using more generic HRQOL measures (i.e. EQ5D, SF scales) mostly reported
insignificant differences in their interventions. S4 Table provides a summary of the various
instruments used in studies.

Our findings reveal a structured patient-provider exchange is required in primary care
(including a one-on-one patient-provider consultation, ongoing follow up and provision of
self-help materials). A systematic and tailored patient-primary care provider exchange is
needed to provide individuals with the portfolio of techniques and tools to effectively self-man-
age. Various combinations of strategies were used to achieve this and adapted to the individu-
als’ condition, health literacy, skills and confidence in managing their own health. Strategies
containing several interacting components and varying dimensions of complexity produce
favourable effects when tailored to the individual. No one intervention solution is suitable for
all patient groups and the selection of combinations of strategies should support patients’
needs relevant to both primary care and HCP. The strategy of enhancing the patient’s deci-
sion-making skills or ability to problem-solve was reported in the highest percentage of studies
(53.8%) with positive results, after knowledge acquisition. Active stimulation of symptom
monitoring (46.2%) and having specific, clear and accepted treatment or healthcare goals was
also commonly identified. This involved setting measurable, clear and accepted treatment or
healthcare goals on a per patient basis with a specific action or self-management plan detailing
these. Tailored, written information and care plans that are mutually agreed upon have previ-
ously been identified as helpful [138]. Strategies to improve responsibility in medication
adherence and lifestyle choices were also reported within effective interventions.

Interestingly, strategies for stress or psychological coping of conditions (46.2%) were com-
monly identified in effective interventions. Changing the patient’s cognitive approach to their

illness was commonly incorporated into the intervention to deal with the physical and emo-
tional symptoms resulting from a chronic illness. Effective interventions integrated cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) into the intervention in 40% of studies. Multiple cognitive strategies
were raised, such as identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts [95], relaxation training
and cognitive-behavioral strategies including anger management, cognitive restructuring,
assertiveness and social skills training [91]. A 2014 systematic review of qualitative literature
identified patients often express difficulties in dealing with the physical and emotional symp-
toms of their chronic conditions [138]. As such, undesirable physical and emotional symptoms
and impaired physical functioning can directly prevent patients from carrying out normal
daily activities, including tasks required to appropriately and successfully self-manage [139–
141]. Self-management of chronic conditions should therefore be examined not only from the
clinical perspective, but also the patient perspective with a focus on humanistic outcomes.
Importantly, the theory of SMS drawn for effective studies included Cognitive Behavioral The-
ory and Prochaska and DiClementes’ transtheoretical model of the stages of change. Follow-
up by HCPs included tailored feedback, monitoring of progress with respect to patient set
healthcare goals, or honing problem-solving and decision-making skills. Self-help tools and
assistance with locating resources were commonly provided during the patient-provider
exchange.

The scope of the terms ‘self-management’, ‘self-management support’ and ‘self-manage-

ment support interventions’ in literature and the large heterogeneity in terminology has
repeatedly been highlighted in previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses [27, 142–144].
This is a key limitation, as very broad or very narrow definitions of what constitutes “self-man-
agement support” have been applied. Lorig and Holman [10] previously underlined the need
to explore interventions beyond the label of self-management to define if interventions actually
address the necessary support strategies required to change behaviour. Subtle variations in
self-management definitions can result in substantial differences in selected studies. Using
Jonkman’s operational definition [35] to define our interventions has shown highly important

in distinguishing self-management interventions from other types of interventions (ie. patient
education or disease management) without being too restrictive. The definition clearly defines
the elements or strategies that constitute a self-management support intervention, with the
pivotal objective of changing behaviour. This has guided the selection of studies on which our
review conclusions have been based.

A notable gap identified in the literature was a lack of focus on multimorbidity. This is
understood to pose challenges for self-management, as many individuals have more than one
health condition [138]. The effects of multimorbidity on a person are not always linear. Inter-
estingly enough, some studies have found that patients with multimorbidity consider them-
selves better at self-management because they had already developed skills such as self-
monitoring and self-advocacy [145].

In acknowledging that SMS is a multidimensional topic, we aimed to create a broader pic-
ture of the landscape of SMS in primary care. This was achieved by evaluating the patterns of
intervention components comprehensively across all conditions, by not limiting our research
to a clinical condition, or specific intervention strategies. Although including different clinical
conditions in the review may be considered as a drawback due the potential heterogeneity
induced, in our research, there was a clear distinction of strategies across the conditions stud-
ied. Findings from this review add further detail to this body of knowledge, while providing
HCPs with a number of evidence-based strategies that can be utilized in practice. These find-
ings pave the way to explore further SMS strategies targeting patient’s behaviour change, effec-
tive patterns of strategies, and develop a more evidence-based model for optimum SMS service
design. Primary care providers (e.g. general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists) can play a
foundational role in supporting patient self-management, especially for people with multiple
chronic conditions. Fig 3 sets the foundation for an evidence-based SMS primary care model
for face-to-face interventions, allowing for a more efficient and effective process to evaluate
and implement SMS interventions in primary care.

For this collaborative partnership approach to be more widely applied, there should be a

strong focus on upskilling primary care providers to deliver SMS strategies in health care,
which are both integrated and coordinated to improve the patient-provider encounter in prac-
tice [5]. The total duration of the intervention and the correlation of intervention duration
with the number of strategies delivered are important aspects when considering the sustain-
ability within primary care. Policy and funding alignment will also be a major determinant for
future sustainability. Therefore, we must determine where the best compromise in SMS inter-
ventions lie for cost-effective and resource-limited approaches. Future high-quality evaluations
of consistent interventions will be of value to practitioners, policy-makers and researchers in
terms of collecting clinical, humanistic and economic outcome measures to generate a robust
evidence base of primary care providers impact in the area. This will also allow determination
of ineffective combinations of strategies.

Future research efforts should continue to expand on this landscape to (1) examine the pat-

terns of strategies within effective multicomponent interventions for various conditions; (2)
examine the weighting of each strategy (ie. determine intervention components which are
more or less effective) within effective multicomponent interventions; (3) determine if certain
types of patient populations could be targeted most effectively by certain combinations of
strategies; (4) develop a core SMS outcome set in primary care; (5) examine the patient’s ability
to self-manage over time as well as aiming to achieve the goal of long-term sustainability for
improved self-management; and (6) determine training requirements for the upskilling of
health care providers for sustained patient behaviour change.

Furthermore, sustainability of improved SMS first requires an understanding of the imple-

mentation of SMS enhancing interventions [146]. Sustainability can be challenging if not

embedded into everyday clinical practice [31], and achieving the potential of primary care as a
platform to effectively deliver SMS and achieve the stated outcomes means overcoming known
barriers, such as limited time, skills and confidence among health professionals [31, 147]. We
know changes in health care professional practice requires exhaustive planning and testing to
increase the probability that they are successfully and sustainably implemented. The adoption
of Intervention Mapping has been widely used in health care settings to plan changes in the
behaviour and practice of health care professionals, and should be applied to ensure SMS inter-
ventions are both effective and successfully implemented in practice [148].

There are limitations to this review. A number of studies did not report sufficient detail to
their interventions which hampered the assessment of possible effective combinations of strat-
egies being evaluated. The methodological quality domains of the included trials were in a lot
of cases unclear, with a lack of poor description of the study methodology and intervention
fidelity in evaluations. This was mitigated by contacting authors for further relevant informa-
tion, searching for study protocols or further examining supplementary data online. With the
growing recognition of the importance of assessing treatment fidelity in multicomponent

interventions [149–151] (ie. compliance to treatment protocols by HCPs, or compliance to
treatment by patients), it is important to note most trials (72%) did not include this in their
design and few provided data on treatment fidelity to the intervention. Only 38% of effective
interventions reported an assessment of intervention fidelity. The methodological quality
domains of the included trials were in a lot of cases unclear. Four high-quality studies provided
positive evidence that SMS interventions delivered in primary care dominate usual standard of
care, by improving patients’ clinical outcomes, HRQOL or psychological functioning [72, 91,
92, 100]. Similar trends have been found in existing literature in several contexts that self-man-
agement is essential to optimizing clinical and humanistic outcomes for patients with chronic
conditions [13, 15, 18, 152–155].

Although multiple databases were extensively searched using clear, specific and appropriate

terms, the search may not have yielded all published relevant studies given the ambiguity of
what constitutes “self-management support” and the variation in terminology for “self-man-
agement” identified in the literature. Unsurprisingly, with the rising burden of chronic disease,
the nomenclature of “self-management” has become more prevalent in both published and
grey literature. We recognize the use of different search terms and definitions to guide the
development of the search strategy may lead to variation in the identification of studies, and
affect a review’s conclusions. This is identified as a limitation of our review. Search terms were
sourced from previous systematic reviews, primary studies and grey literature. Our search
included general terms for “self-management” and was not limited to specific illnesses or
outcomes.

Systematic reviews are at risk for bias from a number of sources [156]. We sought to reduce

potential sources of bias within the inclusion and synthesis of studies. One of our main goals
was developing inclusion criteria to minimize ambiguity and reduce bias in study selection
decisions. We have defined our inclusion and exclusion criteria by PICO clearly and have doc-
umented and reported all decisions made in the study selection process for transparency.
Since we restricted our review to face-to-face interventions, there may be other SMS interven-
tions that may be effective that are not covered by this review. We decided to categorize the
comparator as usual standard of care and understand the definition of usual standard of care
may vary by country or healthcare system.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review highlights core components of successful interventions showing
positive clinical and/or humanistic outcomes. Whilst it was difficult to directly correlate indi-
vidual strategies to outcomes and effectiveness, there was a clear distinction of strategies across
the conditions studied. This review provides encouraging groundwork for the design and eval-
uation of practical strategies for evidence-based practice and the construction of self-manage-
ment support processes in primary healthcare practice. This review may assist in determining
the breadth and focus of the support primary care professionals provide. Application of a theo-
retical perspective provides a strong base for the development of SMS interventions. The devel-
oped model sets the foundation for the design and evaluation of practical strategies for the
construct of self-management support in primary healthcare practice. These results may be
used to justify additional research investigating self-management interventions delivered in
the primary care setting. In response, primary care providers can begin to deeply reflect on
current practice and become involved in a dialogue to improve self-management support.
Critically, these results should stimulate informed discussion for the future delivery of self-
management support in primary care and the requirements for upskilling healthcare providers
to effectively support patients in this collaborative process.
