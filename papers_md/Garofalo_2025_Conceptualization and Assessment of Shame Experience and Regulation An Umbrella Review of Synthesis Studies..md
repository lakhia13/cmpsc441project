ABSTRACT
Shame experience and regulation are of crucial importance in the study of emotion and psychopathology. Considering the vari-
ety of conceptualizations and operationalization methods in the shame literature, the present review aimed to provide a meta- 
synthesis of current knowledge. First, we examined how shame and shame regulation are conceptualized. Second, we aimed to 
identify the most used measures of shame experience and regulation. Third, we gauged the literature for levels of consistency 
between conceptualization and methods of operationalization. An umbrella review of recent (2018–2023) systematic reviews and 
meta- analyses was conducted: 17 studies were included, integrating data from a total of 748 samples and approximately 166,172 
participants. Data on title, authors, journal, aims of the review, conceptualization and measures of shame and shame regulation, 
and  main  findings  were  extracted.  A  relative  majority  of  studies  (roughly  63%)  conceptualized  shame  as  a  multidimensional 
construct, and the most used measure was the TOSCA (Test of Self- Conscious Affect) in 76% of cases. Only partial coherence 
between conceptualization and measurements of the constructs of interest was detected in the retrieved literature. Most meas-
ures capture different dimensions of shame, but these were not always leveraged in favour of ‘total score’ considerations. Notably, 
several reviews referred to shame regulation, but only two included measures of shame regulation. These findings stress the 
importance of increased consistency between conceptual and methodological levels when studying shame and, in particular, 
shame regulation, in order to aid integration across studies and increase the theoretical solidity and applied usefulness of empir-
ical findings.

1   |   Introduction

Shame has been defined as the quintessential human emotion 
(Lewis 1995) and as ‘the master emotion of everyday life’ (Scheff 
2000).  Along  these  lines,  Tangney  et  al.  (2007)  argued  that 
shame is the most painful emotion of everyday life, leading to 
a  sense  of  uselessness  and  impotence,  as  it  hinges  on  evalua-
tion of the deepest self rather than of mere behaviour. However, 
this  description  likely  reflects  the  most  intense  and  maladap-
tive  declensions  of  shame  experience;  while  consideration  of 

milder—conscious or unconscious—forms of shame as well as 
forms of shame that are adaptive or functional call for more nu-
anced perspectives (Scheff 2003; Elison et al. 2014). At any rate, 
shame  experience  and  regulation  serve  an  important  role  in 
many  aspects  of  psychological  functioning  (Schimmenti  2012; 
Schimmenti  and  Caretti  2016)  and  have  been  associated  with 
several  clinical  problems  (Schoenleber  and  Berenbaum  2010; 
Goss and Allan 2009). Different forms of psychopathology have 
repeatedly been linked to prolonged shame. Interpersonal trau-
matization  and  stress  are  more  likely  to  be  experienced  when

Summary

•  Shame  and  shame  regulation  are  consequential  for 
several  forms  of  psychopathology,  although  shame 
regulation  and  externalizing  forms  of  psychopathol-
ogy  have  received  less  attention  in  recent  synthesis 
studies.

•  Although most conceptual models posit that shame is 
multifaceted  and  involves  different  dimensions,  63% 
of  the  included  reviews  were  based  on  multidimen-
sional  conceptualizations,  while  37%  were  based  on 
unidimensional conceptualizations of shame.

•  Crucially, even among reviews based on multidimen-
sional  conceptualizations,  integration  of  empirical 
findings was often based on total scores or on selected 
dimensions of broader construct.

•  Increased consistency between conceptual definitions 
and  assessment  methods  appears  needed  to  aid  the 
clinical translation of empirical research syntheses.

we embrace views of ourselves that are unacceptable; this can 
lead to depressive paralysis or narcissistic rage (Trumbull 2003). 
Gaudet  et  al.  (2015)  found  shame  to  be  negatively  correlated 
with  psychological  well- being  and  considered  it  a  risk  factor 
that  could  lead  to  interpersonal  violence,  depression  and  post- 
traumatic  stress  disorder.  Other  studies  focused  on  the  role  of 
shame  in  obsessive–compulsive–related  disorder  and  anxiety 
(Szentágotai- Tătar  et  al.  2020)  as  well  as  personality  disorders 
characterized  by  high  levels  of  trait  anxiety  (Schoenleber  and 
Berenbaum 2010). Further studies reported that shame may play 
an  important  role  in  the  aetiology  of,  maintenance  of  and  re-
covery from eating disorders (Goss and Allan 2009; Manjrekar 
et al. 2013). Several scholars have posited that shame may serve 
as a significant factor in the psychodynamic underpinnings of 
suicidal  behaviour  (Breed  1972;  Gaudet  et  al.  2015).  Notably, 
while depression is often considered a primary precursor to sui-
cide, Breed (1972) suggested that shame can be a direct catalyst 
or  an  indirect  consequence  of  inward- directed  anger.  Seminal 
studies  have  also  linked  shame  and  narcissistic  personality 
disorder.  Specifically,  Zaslav  (1998)  argued  that  in  grandiose 
narcissism, individuals defensively deny shame, whereas in vul-
nerable narcissism, individuals exhibit excessive preoccupation 
with anticipated negative evaluation, demonstrating heightened 
sensitivity to perceived criticism or slight. Moral emotions like 
shame  also  play  a  key  function  in  the  development  and  mani-
festation of aggressive or otherwise antisocial behaviour (Elison 
et al. 2014; Maggi et al. 2022; Stuewig and Tangney 2007; Velotti 
et al. 2014).

Considering the host of negative correlates of shame, it is no sur-
prise that research on shame has been a cornerstone of emotion 
research. As research on shame and its regulation accumulates, 
gauging  their  conceptualizations  and  methods  of  operational-
ization—as  well  as  consistency  between  the  two—represents 
an  important  endeavour  to  take  stock  of  existing  theories  and 
assessment measures and move the field forward. In the present 
study,  we  first  review  relevant  theory  on  the  nature  of  shame 
and its regulation, highlighting their relevance for adaptive and 
maladaptive  psychological  functioning.  Then,  we  present  the 

results of an umbrella review of synthesis studies, aimed to inte-
grate ways in which shame and shame regulation are conceptu-
alized and measured.

1.1   |   Shame as Functional and Dysfunctional 
Emotion

Although  shame  has  been  linked  to  a  variety  of  negative  cor-
relates in the psychopathology domains, this is not to say that 
shame is, for all intents and purposes, negative. In fact, emotions 
have  evolved  to  fulfil  survival,  reproductive  and  even  social 
goals.  However,  while  basic  emotions  can  serve  the  above- 
mentioned purposes, self- conscious emotions seem to be partic-
ularly concerned with social purposes: In particular, shame has 
evolved for acquiescent purposes and is able to elicit commiser-
ation in spectators (Tracy and Robins 2004). Although shame is 
often considered a negative emotion, it can serve both negative 
and positive functions. Indeed, while many studies support the 
link between shame and maladaptive correlates, theory and re-
search provide a more nuanced picture, suggesting that shame 
can be a functional emotion; thus, it would be more accurate to 
accept that shame, as many other emotions, can be both func-
tional and dysfunctional (Cibich et al. 2016).

According  to  Cibich  et  al.  (2016),  emotions  are  not  dysfunc-
tional  in  nature,  but  if  experienced  intensively,  frequently  or 
inappropriately  relative  to  the  situation,  they  can  become  so. 
A  functional  interpretation  of  emotions  posits  that  they  serve 
purposes that have historically assisted survival. These theories 
also argue that shame is not an ‘ugly’ emotion, but rather that it 
evolved to protect individuals' social bonds and status. This goal 
is served by working as an alarm bell for threats to social belong-
ingness. Following this definition, shamelessness is considered 
a potentially problematic state. For example, a child who bullies 
others and does not feel ashamed for his or her own bullying be-
haviour may blame others and become more aggressive. In con-
trast, a child who bullies others and does feel ashamed can use 
the feeling of shame as a signal that he or she needs to change 
that behaviour and adapt a more prosocial behaviour.

Recent research has explored the adaptive functions of shame. 
In the interpersonal context, De Hooge et al. (2008) have shown 
that  situational  shame  can  motivate  prosocial  behaviour  and 
serve as a commitment device when it is directly relevant to the 
current goal (endogenous shame), but not when it is unrelated 
to it (exogenous shame). Furthermore, they have observed that 
shame can activate an approach motivation when it is perceived 
as feasible and not overly risky to repair and maintain a positive 
self- image. In situations when an individual is supposed to feel 
shame, it is likely that shame plays an adaptive role, helping the 
individual to face the situation (e.g., when a person transgresses 
or after cheating on a partner). However, when shame is not sup-
posed to be felt (e.g., in situations of physical or mental disabil-
ity), it is more likely to play a maladaptive role (Dempsey 2017).

1.2   |   Defining and Conceptualizing Shame

psychopathology,  arguing  that  it  can  take  functional  and

dysfunctional forms, in this section, we will review some of the 
main  definitions  of  shame  that  have  appeared  in  the  relevant 
literature. According to Goss and Allan (2009), shame is a mul-
tifaceted, self- conscious emotion that involves affective, social, 
cognitive,  behavioural  and  psychological  components.  Several 
scholars recognize that one fundamental aspect of shame is the 
negative  social  evaluation—sustaining  the  view  that  shame  is 
elicited  by  the  public  revelation  of  a  characterological  flaw  or 
failure. In seminal writings, Lewis (1997) defined shame as an 
‘unpleasant  and  hostile’  condition,  attributing  to  it  not  only  a 
public failure but also a private nature. In his view, shame is not 
the result of specific circumstances, but rather it arises from the 
interpretation and evaluation that each person privately makes 
of  a  given  situation.  Kohut  (1971)  theorized  shame  as  the  col-
lapse of self- esteem in response to parental failures. According 
to Kohut (1971), shame can be considered a narcissistic distur-
bance, one linked to the ‘grandiose self’ or ‘idealized other’ po-
sitions.  Optimal  development  requires  the  child  to  experience 
a  degree  of  admiration  and  empathy  from  others  or  to  form  a 
positive, idealized attachment to a parental figure. In  such in-
stances,  the  inevitable  setbacks  and  disappointments  are  less 
likely to compromise the child's self- esteem.

Similarly,  Scheff  (2003)  proposed  that  shame  is  the  principal 
social  emotion,  originating  from  all  those  situations  where  a 
social bond is perceived to be under threat, ascribing to shame 
both  a  self  dimension  and  a  societal  dimension.  In  line  with 
this, several scholars define shame as a public emotion. Tangney 
et al. (2007) went as far as to define shame as ‘the more public 
of emotions’, composed of two elements. The first element is re-
lated  to  the  self,  and  the  second  is  based  on  the  perception  of 
being negatively seen by others—i.e., the social factor.

Another influential perspective on shame (Gilbert 2000,  2007; 
Matos  et  al.  2013)  based  on  social  rank  theory  posits  that  the 
perceptions of one's social status as superior or inferior to oth-
ers influence emotions. When one perceives the self as inferior 
to others, a common outcome is submissive behaviour. In this 
context, shame is a reflection of defensive submissive strategies 
when a person perceives the self in an unwanted low- status po-
sition. Notably, perceptions of being in a low- status position may 
stem from being passively ignored or from overt rejection; in both 
cases, shame acts as a reminder we ‘live in the minds of others’ 
as someone who is unattractive and undesirable (Gilbert 2007). 
In a similar vein, Dickerson et al. (2004) characterized shame as 
a self- conscious emotion whose core causes lie in negative judge-
ment of self as inferior and inadequate. Individuals that are ex-
periencing shame show behaviours linked to the desire to ‘hide’, 
‘escape’, ‘disappear from view’ and ‘shrink into the floor’—co-
herent with feelings of submission and withdrawal. The social 
nature of shame is also evident in Elison's (2005; see also Elison 
et al. 2014) work, which stresses the central role of interpersonal 
devaluation for shame wherein shame is characterized to func-
tion in a similar fashion than pain.

In  a  recent  review  by  Murphy  and  Kiffin- Petersen  (2017),  the 
definition  of  shame  as  a  moral  emotion  was  connected  to  the 
interests and well- being of the whole society and not only of ‘a 
judge or an agent’, thus emphasizing the public side of this emo-
tion.  From  this  point  of  view,  because  fostering  relationships 
and  interpersonal  bonds  is  a  fundamental  human  motivation, 

it is clear that shame—as an emotion that is embedded within 
a relational context—can be a painful and uncomfortable emo-
tion. Moral norms and expectations constructed by society are 
internalized by people, and this influences the degree of shame 
that  can  be  experienced  (Murphy  and  Kiffin- Petersen  2017). 
However, as it is evident from the foregoing characterization of 
shame as a multifaceted construct, different perspectives can be 
embraced to conceptualize and measure it. Two such perspec-
tives differentiate internal versus external shame and trait ver-
sus state shame.

1.2.1   |   Internal and External Shame

An  important  categorization  found  in  the  literature  on  shame 
differentiates  internal  and  external  shame.  Gilbert  (1997)  was 
the first to describe the existence of two dimensions, an internal 
dimension and an external one. The first refers to an evaluation 
of the self as inadequate, the second to the fear that others will 
perceive oneself as morally defective. Taylor (2015) defined in-
ternal shame as the one occurring when an individual is led to 
self- deprecation and a perception of oneself as weak and undig-
nified, stemming from the feeling of having fallen short of one's 
own  values.  Critically,  even  internal  shame  may  have  a  social 
nature, when it stems from devaluation from an imagined other, 
recognized  or  simply  internalized  from  childhood  experiences 
(Elison 2005).

According  to  Goss  and  Allan  (2009),  internal  shame  is  asso-
ciated  with  self- hatred  and  strong  self- criticism.  On  the  other 
hand, external shame refers to the fear and worry of being eval-
uated negatively by other people (Angulo et al. 2019). This kind 
of shame is proportional to the importance given to the opinion 
of others (Proeve and Howells 2002), as the attention is mainly 
directed outward and focused on guessing what is going on in 
another person's mind (Goss and Allan 2009). External shame 
is also associated with social anxiety and worries on how oth-
ers  will  consider  and  judge  any  action  taken—leading  to  the 
ashamed self feeling inferior, imperfect, disgusting, weak, inad-
equate and diminished (Wilson et al. 2006). Rather than being 
separate  entities,  internal  and  external  shame  tend  to  be  cor-
related with one another; when an individual perceives himself 
or  herself  as  inadequate  (internal  shame),  it  is  more  plausible 
that he or she thinks that others will share the same perception 
(external shame) (Shepard and Rabinowitz 2013).

1.2.2   |   State Shame, Trait Shame and Shame- Proneness

Shame can be experienced in two different ways: as a momen-
tary and acute feeling (state shame) or as a penetrating and intro-
jected feeling (trait shame; Tangney et al. 2007). Shame research 
has focused more on conceptualizing shame as a trait or dispo-
sition, rather than focusing on state- based shame responses that 
are  specific  to  a  certain  trigger.  Indeed,  what  is  alternatively 
termed dispositional or trait shame is characteristic of a person 
and  does  not  refer  to  the  various  situations  in  which  it  might 
occur  (Leeming  and  Boyle  2004).  Leeming  and  Boyle  (2004) 
defined  trait  shame  as  a  general  disposition  and,  as  such,  not 
expected to show different degrees of likelihood in different con-
texts. While occasional shame (state shame) can be functional 

3 of 20

and also serve social goals, a dispositional proneness to shame 
is characterized by a too frequent and too pervasive experience 
of  shame,  hence  being  associated  with  more  maladaptive  out-
comes (Szentágotai- Tătar et al. 2020). The literature on shame- 
proneness has grown partly separate from trait or dispositional 
shame, positing that placing shame- proneness exclusively in the 
personal  (as  opposed  to  social  or  interpersonal)  realm  is  chal-
lenging, given that boundaries between the personal and social 
world are definitely blurry (Tangney et al. 2007). For instance, if 
someone grows up in hostile environments, proneness to expe-
riencing shame may be inaccurately attributed to a trait dispo-
sition rather than to the environment. In other words, referring 
to shame as a trait does not imply that it is based on an individ-
ual's predisposition. Individuals that are shame- prone are more 
likely  to  externalize  blame  and  experience  episodes  of  intense 
anger, expressed sometimes in destructive ways which can lead 
to  direct  aggression  (physical  or  verbal),  indirect  aggression, 
displaced  aggression  or  self- directed  aggression.  Alternatively, 
anger can also be suppressed and remain unexpressed (Tangney 
et al. 2007). Tangney et al. (2007) argued that shame- prone in-
dividuals are also more likely to experience anticipatory shame, 
irrespective  of  the  anticipated  event.  This  is  directly  linked  to 
the likelihood of experiencing felt shame in a range of different 
circumstances (social contexts or as a reaction to perceived low 
performance).

1.3   |   Measuring Shame

According  to  Lear  et  al.  (2022),  the  multifaceted  nature  of 
shame  has  necessitated  diverse  methodological  approaches  to 
its assessment. Recent research suggests that multidimensional 
measures,  which  differentiate  between  shame- related  cogni-
tions, affect and behaviours or focus on specific domains (e.g., 
body- focused shame), are more effective than generalized unidi-
mensional measures (Velotti et al. 2017). Shame- proneness has 
been primarily assessed using hypothetical scenarios to gauge 
an individual's susceptibility to shame responses in various sit-
uations,  while  trait  shame  has  been  predominantly  measured 
through  self- report  questionnaires  that  evaluate  the  frequency 
and intensity of reported shame experiences.

Robins  and  Noftle  (2006)  provided  an  overview  of  self- report 
measures  of  shame  and  other  self- conscious  emotions  where 
they  distinguished  between  situation- based  scales,  scenario- 
based scales, statement- based scales and adjective- based scales. 
In the scenario- based tests, the person being tested reads a se-
ries of situations specifically constructed to evoke certain emo-
tions and assigns a value to the extent to which he or she feels 
inclined to experience them. The scenario- based test measuring 
shame that is most frequently cited in the existing literature is 
the Test of Self- Conscious Affect (TOSCA) (Tangney et al. 1989). 
Ferguson  et  al.  (2007)  argued  that  this  test,  its  predecessors 
(e.g., SCAAI, Tangney et al. 1989) and its successors (TOSCA- 3, 
Tangney et al. 2000; TOSCA- 4, Tangney et al. 2008) are the most 
widely used tools. Although an in- depth analysis of the TOSCA 
would go beyond the scope of the study, it is worth emphasizing 
that it has received some criticisms. Most notably, some authors 
(e.g., Ferguson et al. 2007; Fontaine et al. 2004) have noted that 
(a)  TOSCA  might  represent  shame  in  an  overly  maladaptive 
fashion  (i.e.,  intensely  negative  thoughts  and  emotions)  while 

overlooking  its  adaptive  function,  in  comparison  to  its  opera-
tionalization of guilt and (b) TOSCA might be overdiscriminat-
ing  between  shame  and  guilt  or  include  item- level  biases  that 
could contribute to such overdiscrimination.

The  most  common  trait  measures  include  the  Personal 
Feelings  Questionnaire- 2  (PFQ- 2)  (Harder  and  Lewis  1987), 
the  Internalized  Shame  Scale  (ISS)  (Cook  1987),  the  Adapted 
Shame  and  Guilt  Scale  (ASGS)  (Harder  and  Zalma  1990),  the 
Experience  of  Shame  Scale  (ESS)  (Andrews  et  al.  2002),  the 
Experiential Shame Scale (ELSS) (Turner and Waugh 2001), the 
Other as Shamer (OAS) scale (Goss et al. 1994) and the External 
and Internal Shame Scale (EISS) (Ferreira et al. 2020). Wordlist 
surveys  have  been  considered  to  be  more  internally  coherent 
than scenario- based ones. The latter have been criticized due to 
their  limited  spectrum  of  shame- inducing  scenarios,  often  in-
cluding situations that are less appropriate and seldom experi-
enced by people with mental issues—e.g., working environment 
(Rüsch et al. 2007).

1.4   |   Defining and Conceptualizing Shame 
Regulation

In addition to considerations on the experience of shame, criti-
cal to the understanding of adaptive and maladaptive correlates 
of shame is consideration of how individuals respond to it, that 
is,  shame  regulation  or  shame  coping.  For  instance,  shame  is 
more likely to be problematic when the individual tries to avoid 
it, leaving shame essentially unresolved. Such an avoidance re-
sponse is considered more likely when the cause of shame is per-
ceived as irreparable (Cibich et al. 2016).

Self- conscious emotions, such as shame, play an important role 
in self- regulation: They help individuals become aware of their 
social  mistakes  and,  consequently,  modify  their  behaviours 
(Beer and Keltner 2004). There are multiple ways in which in-
dividuals can regulate or cope with shame feelings. According 
to Nathanson (1992), individuals can recognize their shame and 
consequently  find  ways  to  cope  with  it  or  may  wilfully  or  un-
consciously avoid it—leading to the so- called ‘unacknowledged 
shame’. Nathanson (1992) went further by developing the ‘com-
pass of shame’ model, grouping four categories of maladaptive 
shame- coping strategies: withdrawal, avoidance, attack on self 
and  attack  on  others.  All  of  these  are  aimed  at  defending  the 
self from the painful experience of shame, can be endorsed to 
different  degrees  and  depend  on  the  context.  While  attack  on 
self  involves  internalization,  self- directed  anger  and  even  dis-
gust,  attack  on  others,  on  the  contrary,  is  linked  to  external-
ization  of  blame  and  anger  and  even  aggression.  Withdrawal 
represents a combination of internalization and desire to reduce 
social exposure. Withdrawal is considered to be the prototypical 
reaction to shame, as shame naturally leads to a loss of muscle 
tone in the neck and back, driving a tendency to avoid eye con-
tact by turning eyes and head downcast (Hahn 2001). Finally, 
avoidance is usually associated with minimization or denial of 
shame—attempting to reduce social exposure or to keep shame 
from conscious awareness—and is the only strategy that can be 
characterized by a lack of conscious experience of shame (Elison 
et al. 2014; Garofalo and Velotti 2021). Of note, recent theoreti-
cal and empirical work (e.g., Capinha et al. 2021; Garofalo and 

4 of 20

Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy, 2025

Velotti 2021) has extended the compass of shame model to in-
clude  a  fifth  dimension  reflecting  adaptive  coping  to  shame, 
suggesting that adaptive coping is not limited to not endorsing 
maladaptive coping strategies but also include actively adopting 
adaptive strategies such as seeking social support.

Elison et al. (2014) examined Nathanson's (1992) model in cor-
respondence  to  evolutionary- based  fight- or- flight  responses, 
stressing  the  transdiagnostic  relevance  of  maladaptive  shame 
coping for various forms of psychopathology spanning internal-
izing and externalizing spectra. Notably, the four shame- coping 
strategies described above are also used in an anticipatory fash-
ion, to avoid the potential experience of shame; these kinds of 
preventive strategies are not strongly linked to shame- proneness 
but rather to shame aversion (Elison et al. 2014). Schoenleber and 
Berenbaum (2012) described various forms of preventive coping 
strategies  for  shame:  achievement  sabotage,  dependence,  fan-
tasy,  perfectionism  and  interpersonal  avoidance.  Achievement 
sabotage is the attitude to compromise one's performance as in, 
for example, the procrastination process that can help to avoid 
the possibility of shame by postponing actions further and fur-
ther in time. Dependence consists of delegating one's duties to 
another person to avoid the onset of shame that could have been 
caused  by  one's  actions.  Through  fantasy,  people  can  portray 
themselves  as  having  attractive  characteristics  that  can  lead 
them to desired consequences, shifting attention away from the 
shortcomings they actually think they have. Perfectionism en-
tails aiming for unrealistic levels of results; individuals engag-
ing in self- promotion, non- disclosure and/or non- exposure will 
try to find a means of mitigating the anticipated psychological 
distress associated with the exposure of personal imperfections. 
Finally,  interpersonal  avoidance  refers  to  behaviours  aimed  at 
avoiding  social  interactions  that  could  prove  to  be  a  source  of 
shame,  somewhat  akin  to  Nathanson's  (1992)  withdrawal,  but 
enacted before a potentially shameful situation rather than after 
a shame- eliciting situation.

1.5   |   The Present Study

The diverging and, at times, inconsistent ways to conceptualize 
and  operationalize  shame  and  shame  regulation  increase  the 
risk  of  jingle–jangle  fallacies  wherein  two  different  constructs 
are  given  the  same  name  (jingle  fallacy)  or  when  the  same 
constructs  are  given  different  names  (jangle  fallacy).  These 
instances  create  obstacles  to  scientific  progress  as  they  make 
integration  across  studies  more  difficult.  Therefore,  given  the 
disparate  definitions  and  measurements  present  in  the  litera-
ture, two problems arise: The first concerns integration among 
prevalent conceptualizations and measures in the literature on 
shame  and  shame  regulation  across  studies.  The  second  con-
cerns  gauging  the  level  of  consistency  between  conceptualiza-
tions  and  methods  of  operationalizations  of  shame  and  shame 
regulation—that  is,  whether  there  is  coherence  within  studies 
between how shame and shame regulation are defined and mea-
sured. Given the vastness of the literature on the topic, review 
studies that synthesize primary literature have accumulated in 
the  past  few  decades.  Therefore,  we  opted  to  conduct  an  um-
brella review of recent synthesis studies to encompass a wider 
range  of  literature  which  has  already  undergone  screening 
and  integration  using  systematic  review  and/or  meta- analytic 

methodology. This methodological approach is beneficial when 
the goal is to draw an overall integrated view regarding a broad 
topic  by  synthesizing  review  studies  that  each  cover  a  large 
number of published studies across different populations (Choi 
and Kang 2023). The focus on recent review studies (published 
between 2018 and 2023; see Section 2) was motivated by a de-
sire to gauge contemporary trends in the shame literature based 
on the most recent reviews. This allowed the coverage of earlier 
empirical findings as they were synthesized in the reviews in-
cluded in the present umbrella review, while keeping the volume 
of the literature to screen manageable.

Against  the  conceptual  and  empirical  background  reviewed 
above, the aims of the present review were to systematically re-
view conceptualizations and measurements of shame and shame 
regulation. Specifically, we examined whether the constructs of 
shame and shame regulation have been defined mostly within 
a  unidimensional  or  a  multidimensional  framework,  whether 
methods of operationalizations of shame and shame regulation 
have been based on unidimensional or multidimensional mea-
sures  and  whether  there  is  consistency  within  studies  on  how 
shame and shame regulation are conceptualized and measured. 
A further goal of this review was to provide an integrated per-
spective on consensual definitions of shame experience and reg-
ulation, as well as an overview of the measures most commonly 
used to assess them. Finally, a secondary goal of the review was 
to provide a meta- synthesis of the main findings to emerge from 
the included reviews, with an emphasis on the links that shame 
and shame regulation have with psychopathology.

2   |   Method

Relevant  studies  were  identified  by  conducting  a  literature 
search through the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science 
and PubMed. The literature search was conducted on February 
24, 2024. The selection process considered  the  most  recent ar-
ticles  on  the  topic,  focusing  on  a  6- year  period  that  included 
publications from 2018 to 2023. The following key search terms 
were used: ‘shame AND (review OR meta- analysis OR system-
atic OR scoping OR synthesis)’. The search strategy yielded 4356 
articles. Out of these, 1551 duplicates were manually removed, 
and  a  total  of  2805  articles  were  screened  for  relevance  based 
on their titles and abstracts. A number of 2688 articles were ex-
cluded due to their irrelevance. One hundred seventeen reports 
were searched for full text retrieval, but eight of them could not 
be found. At this point, 109 articles were eligible for screening 
based on the following criteria: main focus on the topic of shame 
(i.e., excluding studies that have included shame as a corollary 
to another main theme under investigation); only systematic re-
views and meta- analyses; only publications in English or Italian 
language.  Eighty- one  articles  were  excluded  due  to  using  the 
wrong study design; five articles were not included because they 
were not available in English, and six articles were excluded due 
to their lack of focus on shame. Eventually, a total of 17 studies 
were included in this review (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow 
chart detailing the screening process).

After  the  records  selection  was  completed,  the  following  data 
were  extracted  from  each  article  included  in  the  umbrella  re-
view: title and year of publication of the study; the authors and

their affiliations; the journal in which they were published; the 
objectives  of  the  studies;  shame  conceptualization  (unidimen-
sional or multidimensional); shame regulation and coping strat-
egies; shame measurement tools; and main findings. A quality 
assessment was conducted for all reviews using a 17- item check-
list (Robinson et al. 2020). Data extraction for 30% of the records 
was independently repeated by a second author, and no discrep-
ancies emerged.

3   |   Results

Seventeen  review  studies  (nine  systematic  reviews  and  eight 
meta- analyses)  published  between  2018  and  2023  were  in-
cluded in this umbrella review. A summary of these studies is 
presented  in  Table  1.  In  this  section,  the  superscript  numbers 
included  in  square  brackets  refer  to  records  listed  in  Table  1, 
and we use the term ‘studies’ to refer to both systematic reviews 
and meta- analyses. Overall, a total of 748 samples were included 

and approximately 166,172 participants were reached. A total of 
three studies were published in the Clinical Psychology Review 
journal  [2,5,16];  two  studies  came  from  the  Journal  Psychology 
and  Psychotherapy:  Theory,  Research  and  Practice  [12,6];  two 
studies  were  in  the  Journal  of  Traumatic  Stress  [1,3].  Based  on 
the lead author's main affiliation, the majority of studies were 
published  from  the  United  States  (35%),  followed  by  Australia 
(23%), the United Kingdom (18%), Romania (12%) and Indonesia 
and  Ireland  (6%  each).  Overall,  the  quality  assessment  of  the 
study  showed  that  14  of  the  studies  were  of  high  quality,  with 
only one study being of low quality. Table 1 shows an overview 
of all included studies.

3.1   |   Conceptualization of Shame and Shame 
Regulation

The  majority  of  studies  (64.7%)  that  have  been  reviewed 
agree  with  defining  shame  as  a  multidimensional  construct.

In  particular,  most  articles  (53%)  proposed  shame  as  a  con-
struct  that  can  be  categorized  according  to  two  dimensions 
that in literature are identified as internal and external shame 
[2,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,15]. Six studies (41.2%) [1,8,12,14,16,17] stressed the dis-
tinction between trait and state shame but considered them as 
unidimensional constructs. Four other studies (23.5%) [2,3,10,13] 
embraced  a  multidimensional  definition  of  shame  as  consist-
ing of disparate aspects: character, bodily components, physical 
components and various aspects of the self.

Conceptualizations  of  shame  regulation  were  also  exam-
ined,  and  most  of  them  were  directly  or  indirectly  based  on 
Nathanson's  (1992)  compass  of  shame  model.  In  most  of  the 
studies  included,  withdrawal  was  the  shame- coping  strategy 
most  often  investigated  (in  11  studies).  One  study  investigated 
shame regulation through the avoidance of eye contact [7] in the 
context of interpersonal conflict. More generally, seven studies 
found  avoidance  to  be  a  coping  strategy  to  avoid  social  risks. 
Two studies reported aggression as a strategy [3,11] both inwardly 
and outwardly directed.

Some  studies  dealing  with  shame  and  eating  disorder  symp-
toms  [6,9,10]  have  inferred  that  trying  to  control  one's  weight 
and  physical  appearance  is  a  way  to  deal  with  shame  [6]. 
Similarly, binge eating episodes have been considered as pos-
sible  behaviours  that  mitigate  negative  emotions,  and  in  ad-
dition to this, the control of food intake was considered as a 
coping  strategy  for  shame.  At  the  same  time,  shame  seemed 
to be able to perpetuate dysfunctional eating behaviours and 
the control of nutrition, contributing to establishing a vicious 
cycle  between  maladaptive  shame  regulation  and  dysfunc-
tional eating behaviours. One study reported that dissociation 
could reduce the symptoms of shame [1], and it has also been 
hypothesized  that  substance  abuse  can  be  a  way  to  escape 
shame [16].

3.2   |   Measures of Shame and Shame Regulation

The studies examined contain a total of 74 instruments used for 
measuring  shame.  It  emerged  that  the  most  used  instrument 
for  measuring  shame  is  the  TOSCA.  TOSCA  has  been  used 
in  14  studies  [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,14,15,16]  in  its  different  versions 
(TOSCA- 2  in  one  study,  TOSCA- 3  in  seven  studies,  TOSCA- 4 
in two studies, TOSCA- SD in three studies and SCAAI TOSCA 
in one study). The PFQ- 2 has also been widely used, as seen in 
its  usage  within  12  papers  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,15,16].  Eleven  stud-
ies  [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,12,15,16]  reported  using  the  ISS,  and  nine  used 
the  ESS  [1,2,4,5,6,7,10,12,14].  Eight  studies  have  employed  the  OAS 
[2,4,5,6,7,10,12,15];  seven  studies,  the  State  Shame  and  Guilt  Scale 
(SSGS)  [1,5,7,10,14,15,16];  five  studies,  the  Positive  and  Negative 
Affect Scale (PANAS) [1,6,7,15,16]; four papers, the ASGS [4,5,12,15]; 
four papers, the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (OBCS) 
[2,5,7,8]; and three studies the Shame Assessment for Multifarious 
Expressions  of  Shame  (SHAME)  [4,7,15].  The  other  measuring 
instruments  were  used  in  two  studies  or  only  one  study.  Most 
notably, only two reviews included measures of shame regula-
tion: in one case, the Compass of Shame Scale, and in another 
case, the less specific Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire. 
For a complete overview of the most used tools in the reviews, 
see Table 2.

3.3   |   Main Study Aims and Findings

All  studies  had  different  aims  and  investigated  the  relation-
ship  between  shame  and  various  other  constructs.  Two  stud-
ies focused on the association between shame and exposure to 
trauma,  post- traumatic  stress  disorder  and  related  symptoms 
[3,17]. These studies found that shame and post- traumatic stress 
disorder  were  strongly  associated.  Three  papers  analysed  the 
topic of shame related to eating disorders [6,9,10]. These studies 
showed a relationship between shame and the difficulties in eat-
ing behaviours and the fact that shame can represent a risk fac-
tor for binge eating behaviours. Body shame and shame related 
to eating seemed to be the types of shame that are most associ-
ated  with  eating  symptoms.  Swee  et  al.  (2021)  [5]  and  Cândea 
and  Szentagotai- Tătar  (2018)  [15]  both  related  the  construct  of 
shame to the spectrum of anxiety disorders, corroborating an as-
sociation between these two constructs. Shame was associated 
with social anxiety, both trait and state anxiety, and other types 
of anxiety except panic symptoms.

Other  studies  included  in  this  review  had  different  goals  in 
relation  to  shame,  such  as  the  association  between  shame 
and dissociation [1]; associations among shame, guilt and self- 
harm  [2];  and  the  link  between  shame  and  psychosis  contin-
uum  [12].  Shame  was  positively  associated  with  all  three  of 
these constructs. One study provided support for the hypoth-
esis that there is a correlation between shame and self- esteem 
[13];  furthermore,  one  study  reported  associations  between 
shame  and  obsessive–compulsive  disorder  symptoms  [14]. 
Associations were found between shame and postnatal symp-
toms. In particular, one study argued that shame was associ-
ated  with  stress  and  depression  in  mothers  and  with  stress, 
depression and anxiety in fathers [11]. Shame did not seem to 
be consistently linked to substance use, but among substance 
users,  shame  was  related  to  greater  substance- related  diffi-
culties [16]. One study aimed to review self- report measures of 
generalized shame [4] such as scenario- based and experience- 
based  shame,  suggesting  that  scenario- based  measures  may 
be less ecologically valid to life events than experience- based 
measures. Two studies have dealt, in different ways, with in-
terventions  that  can  reduce  and  address  problems  related  to 
shame.  In  particular,  it  has  been  found  that  evidence- based 
interventions  can  reduce  shame  [8]  and  33  out  of  37  studies 
have  documented  the  reduction  of  shame  post- intervention. 
It  has  also  emerged  that  mindfulness- based  and  third  wave 
cognitive–behavioural interventions can be beneficial in sup-
porting individuals with shame problems and can have a posi-
tive impact on people's quality of life [7]. All main findings are 
summarized in Table 1.

4   |   Discussion

The aim of this umbrella review was to analyse the conceptu-
alization of the constructs of shame and shame regulation as 
well as their measurements through the analysis of systematic 
reviews and meta- analyses. The synthesis studies included in 
the present umbrella review were, by and large, of high quality. 
Overall,  shame  emerged  as  being  conceptualized  in  a  multi-
dimensional  way  in  the  majority  of  studies,  although  a  non- 
negligible  portion  of  studies  simply  differentiated  between

state  and  trait  shame,  without  defining  different  dimensions 
within  the  construct  of  shame.  Among  the  multidimensional 
conceptualizations of shame, the most common were external 
and internal shame as well as the conceptualization of shame 
as  a  construct  that  includes  behavioural,  physical  and  bodily 
factors. While the distinction of internal vs. external shame is 
based on Gilbert's (1997) seminal contribution, conceptualiza-
tions of shame as an emotion that arises and ‘spans’ diverse as-
pects such as behaviour, body or character (e.g., López- Castro 
et al. 2019) are largely based on Andrews et al.'s (2002) empir-
ical work. Another important distinction, albeit not inherently 
multidimensional,  that  emerged  from  the  reviewed  studies  is 
the consideration of adaptive and maladaptive manifestations 
of shame; specifically, the experience of shame has been con-
ceptualized as adaptive and functional for social relationships, 
but  maladaptive  when  it  is  experienced  too  intensely  and  too 
frequently  (Cibich  et  al.  2016).  Finally,  studies  alternatively 
used  the  terms  ‘trait  shame’  and  ‘shame- proneness’  inter-
changeably (Luoma et al. 2019; Nechita et al. 2021) or as indi-
cating slightly different things (Carden et al. 2020), the latter 
more  in  line  with  Tangney  et  al.  (2007)  conceptualization  of 
shame- proneness.

Regarding measurements, one of the most used trait measures 
for shame is the TOSCA, which was included in 76% of the re-
viewed studies. In contrast, a wide range of measures were im-
plicated in single reviews (or two), such as the Shame Inventory 
or  the  EISS.  Although  the  definition  of  shame  regulation  was 
present in the majority of the studies (see Table 1), the included 
instruments refer predominantly to the measurement of the ex-
perience of shame and not to its regulation, with the exception 
of the CoSS and ERSQ- ES in two reviews (for an overview, see 
Table 2).

One  of  the  goals  of  this  review  was  to  investigate  whether 
there  was  consistency  between  the  conceptualization  and 
measurement  of  shame.  Taking  this  analysis  into  consider-
ation, reflections on the coherence between conceptualization 
and  measurement  of  the  shame  construct  were  made  on  the 
basis of definitions and instruments that have been most com-
mon. This aim examined whether the review studies included 
a quantitative synthesis in line with the concepts that were the 
focus of the review. As previously observed, shame has been 
found  to  be  a  multidimensional  construct  in  the  vast  major-
ity, so it would be reasonable to expect that its measurement 
would be concerned with measuring the various dimensions. 
However, it has been found that, among the most used instru-
ments,  the  majority  have  been  designed  or  used  for  a  unidi-
mensional operationalization of the construct. This seems to 
show that conceptualization and measurement lack coherence 
to some extent, and this could compromise our ability to inte-
grate findings from different studies and to add nuance to our 
understanding  of  the  multifarious  manifestations  of  shame 
experience.  Specifically,  few  scales  (e.g.,  ESS,  ELSS,  EISS, 
SHAME)  are  developed  to  capture  multiple  dimensions  of 
shame,  but  findings  using  those  measures  are  often  synthe-
sized  in  the  form  of  total  scores  rather  than  subscale  scores. 
Most other measures can be reduced to a single- factor opera-
tionalization. Notable across both levels concerning the experi-
ence and regulation of shame was a general lack of assessment 
instruments for adaptive forms of shame and adaptive shame 

regulation  (with  the  exception  of  the  expanded  compass  of 
shame model; Capinha et al. 2021; Elison et al. 2014; Garofalo 
and  Velotti  2021),  despite  widespread  theoretical  consensus 
that  shame  and  its  regulation  can  reflect  both  adaptive  and 
maladaptive processes. Taken together, these issues can con-
tribute to a fragmentation between how shame is conceptual-
ized and how it is operationalized.

In this regard, Lear et al. (2022) argued that a multidimensional 
approach to shame has gained ground in recent years, which could 
guarantee a more nuanced approach to assess shame. Tools that 
fail to capture the nuances of the construct could hinder research 
and, by extension, clinical practice. Indeed, the variety of defini-
tions of shame makes it difficult to operationalize and measure it, 
and different instruments are used depending on the dimension 
of  shame  that  is  being  measured.  However,  combining  multiple 
instruments  that  tap  on  unidimensional—yet  distinct—concep-
tualizations could represent an efficient compromise to increase 
alignment between conceptualization and operationalization (e.g., 
the ISS and the OAS respectively measure internalized shame and 
external  shame).  In  line  with  this,  Goffnett  et  al.  (2020)  argued 
that it can be very useful to use both general and context- specific 
measures of shame to gain a fuller understanding of the construct 
and to understand which measures are most sensitive to change 
after  intervention  in  clinical  studies.  Finally,  it  is  noteworthy 
that several measures exist to assess shame in relation to specific 
problems (e.g., alcohol, abuse), implying that there might be some-
thing inherently different in measuring problem- related shame as 
opposed to shame broadly construed. This appears to be another 
area in need of conceptual clarity.

According to the literature, shame and shame regulation have 
been associated with a variety of psychopathological symptoms 
(Tangney  et  al.  2007).  Even  though  the  association  between 
shame  and  psychopathological  constructs  was  not  among  the 
main objectives of the present study, it is important to elaborate 
on the connections that emerged from the reviewed studies. This 
allowed us to underline the transdiagnostic relevance of shame. 
In fact, this study has documented that many psychopathologi-
cal conditions have been associated with shame. Specifically, a 
large  literature  is  available  on  the  association  between  shame 
and PTSD and how shame can fuel suffering in the aftermath 
of trauma (López- Castro et al. 2019). Luoma et al. (2019) exam-
ined substance abuse, arguing that maladaptive shame may be 
a factor that encourages alcohol use and promotes the mainte-
nance  of  this  behaviour;  specifically,  while  there  was  no  con-
vincing evidence of the link between overall levels of shame and 
substance  abuse,  there  was  consistent  evidence  that—among 
substance abusers—shame is related to worse outcomes. In ad-
dition to this, evidence has been provided regarding the relation-
ship with other disorders such as eating disorders. For example, 
binge eating has been associated with body shame and feelings 
of inadequacy towards the body (O'Loghlen et al. 2022). Beyond 
this, studies that have analysed the relationship between shame 
and  anxiety  disorders  have  supported  a  strong  correlation  be-
tween shame and symptoms of social anxiety specifically (Swee 
et  al.  2021;  Cândea  and  Szentagotai- Tătar  2018),  but  also  with 
anxiety,  stress  and  depression  in  parents  after  birth  (Caldwell 
et  al.  2021).  Finally,  one  review  showed  that  shame  can  con-
tribute to the initiation and maintenance of psychosis (Carden 
et al. 2020).

Regarding the regulation of shame, the role of withdrawal and 
avoidance as a coping strategy to deal with shame has been em-
phasized,  in  line  with  Nathanson's  (1992)  compass  of  shame 
model.  Moreover,  several  studies  have  interpreted  some  forms 
of symptomatology as maladaptive strategies to regulate phys-
ical shame, suggesting that maladaptive eating behaviours can 
be,  on  the  one  hand,  a  shame  regulation  strategy  but  that,  on 
the  other  hand,  shame  can  cause  the  persistence  of  these  be-
haviours. Binge eating has also been seen as a way of regulat-
ing shame (Nechita et al. 2021) along with attempts to control 
weight  and  body  image  (Blythin  et  al.  2020).  In  people  with 
OCD,  difficulties  in  regulating  emotions,  shame  in  particular, 
can  lead  to  difficulties  in  seeking  medical  treatment  and  in 
explaining  the  symptoms  they  suffer  from  due  to  the  shame 
caused  by  unacceptable  thoughts  (Laving  et  al.  2023).  Finally, 
other symptoms identified as maladaptive mechanisms to reg-
ulate  shame  are  dissociation  (Rudy  et  al.  2022)  and  self- harm 
(Sheehy et al. 2019). Overall, limited research appeared focused 
on synthesizing the evidence linking shame and shame regula-
tion with externalizing forms of psychopathology.

4.1   |   Limitations and Future Research

The present findings should be interpreted in light of the study's 
limitations.  First,  the  selection  criteria  led  to  the  inclusion  of 
samples  that  almost  entirely  referred  to  an  adult  population; 
hence, our review cannot directly speak for the conceptualiza-
tion and measurement of shame and shame regulation in chil-
dren  and  adolescents.  Second,  the  author's  nationality  for  the 
included  studies,  in  16  cases  out  of  17,  was  Western.  Hence,  it 
was  not  possible  to  explore  cultural  differences.  Finally,  our 
focus on review studies published in the 2018–2023 time span 
represented a contemporary snapshot of shame conceptualiza-
tions and measurement but did not allow us to describe schol-
arly trends over longer periods of time.

4.2   |   Conclusions

As  Scheff  (2003)  put  it,  shame  may  be  the  ‘master  emotion  of 
everyday life’, but nevertheless, in most modern societies, it re-
mains a hidden emotion because, too often, it is still considered 
a  taboo  (Scheff  2014;  Scheff  and  Mateo  2016).  The  present 
umbrella review provided an integration of concepts and meth-
ods to study shame based on a critical review of recent synthe-
sis studies (i.e., systematic reviews and meta- analyses). Despite 
widespread consensus in theorizing shame and its regulation as 
complex, multidimensional constructs, only a relative majority 
of the reviewed studies were based on a multidimensional and 
complex  construct,  and  virtually  no  studies  integrated  find-
ings based on multidimensional methods of operationalization 
of  shame.  Notably,  most  studies  referred  to  the  importance  of 
shame  regulation  but  could  not  or  did  not  provide  systematic 
reviews  or  meta- analytic  estimates  of  links  between  shame 
regulation and relevant constructs. In this context, the general 
lack of assessment instruments for adaptive or functional forms 
of shame appeared to represent an important weakness in the 
shame literature. The lion's share of findings concerns state and 
trait shame or shame- proneness. Such inconsistencies between 
theoretical  and  empirical  work,  as  well  as  within  empirical 

works,  make  it  challenging  to  synthesize  existing  knowledge 
while remaining true to the complexity of shame experience and 
regulation as conceptually and clinically evident.

In a tentative search of consensus across studies on the definition 
of shame, some dimensions appeared to be most commonly re-
ported, namely, characterological, behavioural or physical shame, 
as well as internal and external shame. Regarding shame regula-
tion, Nathanson's (1992) compass of shame model encompassing 
the shame- coping strategies of avoidance, withdrawal, attack on 
self and attack on others was the most common. Among available 
assessment tools, a wide variety of measures could be identified, 
with the TOSCA being the most widely used, and notably, many 
measures  to  assess  shame  in  relation  to  specific  problem  areas 
were retrieved. By and large, the present umbrella review could 
at best identify a partial and fairly minor coherence between the 
conceptualization of shame and its measurement across studies, 
likely indicating difficulties in reaching consensus on definitions 
and in operationalizing this construct.

Although  a  secondary  aim  of  the  present  umbrella  review,  a 
synthesis of the included studies made it possible to corroborate 
the association between shame and several forms of psychopa-
thology, especially eating disorders, anxiety disorder, PTSD and 
dissociation symptoms. Furthermore, it was possible to appreci-
ate how shame represents a promising treatment target in clin-
ical  practice  with  different  forms  of  psychopathology.  Of  note, 
synthesis studies on the role of shame and shame regulation in 
externalizing  forms  of  psychopathology  remain  scarce  (Elison 
et al. 2014; Velotti et al. 2014).

In  summary,  the  results  of  the  present  umbrella  review  pro-
vide  some  support  for  the  multidimensional  nature  of  shame, 
but further research is needed to understand its complexity and 
to promote the use of tools that are sensitive to the various as-
pects  it  encompasses,  including  shame  regulation  beyond  the 
experience of shame. Greater attention to the construct and its 
operationalization seems required as it would be useful for theo-
retical advancement and clinical application. In fact, considering 
its clinical importance, an agreement on the conceptualization 
of  the  construct  of  shame  is  deemed  necessary  and  would  cer-
tainly be helpful for practitioners in their daily clinical practice. 
Given the observed mismatch in conceptualizations, as well as 
between  conceptualizations  and  measurements,  of  shame,  it  is 
desirable that future research will focus on shame tools that can 
capture its multidimensionality and facilitate translation to clin-
ical practice.
