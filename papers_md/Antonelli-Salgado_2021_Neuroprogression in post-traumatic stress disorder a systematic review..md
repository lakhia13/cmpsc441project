Abstract

Introduction: Neuroprogression has been proposed as the pathological rewiring of the brain that takes 
place in parallel with clinical and neurocognitive deterioration in the course of psychiatric disorders. This 
study aims to review the biological underpinnings and clinical outcomes related to neuroprogression in 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Methods:  We  performed  a  systematic  review  by  searching  PubMed,  Embase,  and  Web  of  Science  for 
articles published between January 1, 1960, and January 6, 2020. Inclusion criteria were met when articles 
assessed brain changes, neurocognition, functioning, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotrophins 
in patients with PTSD. Narrative review articles, case reports, and preclinical studies were excluded.
Results: A total of 965 abstracts were identified and 15 articles were included in our systematic review. 
It  seems  that  for  a  subset  of  patients  whose  symptoms  worsen  or  are  maintained  at  a  high  intensity 
there is a progressive change in the frontal lobe, especially the prefrontal cortex, and worsening of both 
neurocognition  (verbal  memory  and  facial  recognition)  and  functioning  (physical,  psychological,  social 
and environmental).
Conclusion:  Although  current  findings  associate  progressive  reduction  in  frontal  lobe  size  with 
neurocognitive  impairment,  further  research  is  needed  to  characterize  PTSD  as  a  neuroprogressive 
disorder.
Keywords: Neuroprogression, PTSD, neuroimaging.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has a lifetime 
prevalence of 3.9%.1 PTSD is considered a debilitating 
condition  that  develops  from  exposure  to  traumatic 

of the traumatic event; avoidance; persistent negative 

thoughts  or  feelings;  and  trauma-related  arousal  and 

reactivity.

It  is  known  that  the  clinical  course  of  PTSD  is  not 

uniform  and  may  vary  depending  upon  the  type  of 

events  such  as  actual  or  threatened  death,  actual  or 

trauma,  whether  the  patient  was  pediatric,  adult,  or 

threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual 
violence. The DSM-52 lists 20 diagnostic criteria for PTSD 
divided  into  four  clusters  of  symptoms:  re-experience 

elderly  at  the  time  of  the  inciting  trauma,  whether 

they  were  responsible  or  not  for  the  trauma,  and  so 
on.3  For  instance,  a  prospective  cohort  study  of  World

PTSD  is  associated  with  an  increased  rate  of  suicide

No differences were found in IL-6 either at the first or

The  third  study,  Spivak  1997,  is  a  cross-sectional 

study  of  19  male  patients  with  combat-related  PTSD

neuroprogression,  as  these  adolescents  experienced 

that  serum  interleukin-1β  levels  were  significantly

Our  first  conclusion  relates  to  the  demonstrated

studies  showed  that  throughout  the  period  of  illness, 

there was a volumetric reduction in white matter of the 
frontal lobe and grey matter of the dorsolateral PFC.34 A 
volumetric reduction over time was also observed in the 
anterior cingulate cortex by a longitudinal study,34 but a

these findings.34,37-39 There was no association between

According to some of the authors, negative results may 

be  associated  with  a  short  follow-up  or  short  illness

247  war  veterans  exposed  to  trauma  assessed  post-

years and showed that an increase in symptomatology 
was  associated  with  smaller  hippocampal  volume.46 
We did not include this study in our systematic review
