Abstract
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained growing interest for the treatment of major depression
(MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Most knowledge on rTMS comes from human studies as preclinical
application has been problematic. However, recent optimization of rTMS in animal models has laid the foundations for
improved translational studies. Preclinical studies have the potential to help identify optimal stimulation protocols and
shed light on new neurobiological-based rationales for rTMS use. To assess existing evidence regarding rTMS effects
on depressive-like symptoms in rodent models, we conducted a comprehensive literature search in accordance with
PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019157549). In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis to
determine rTMS efﬁcacy, performing subgroup analyses to examine the impact of different experimental models and
neuromodulation parameters. Assessment of the depressive-like phenotype was quite homogeneous whilst rTMS
parameters among the 23 included studies varied considerably. Most studies used a stress-induced model. Overall,
results show a largely beneﬁcial effect of active rTMS compared to sham stimulation, as reﬂected in the statistically
signiﬁcant recovery of both helplessness (SDM 1.34 [1.02;1.66]) and anhedonic (SDM 1.87 [1.02;2.72]) proﬁles.
Improvement of the depressive-like phenotype was obtained in all included models and independently of rTMS
frequency. Nonetheless, these results have limited predictive value for TRD patients as only antidepressant-sensitive
models were used. Extending rTMS studies to other MDD models, corresponding to distinct endophenotypes, and to
TRD models is therefore crucial to test rTMS efﬁcacy and to develop cost-effective protocols, with the potential of
yielding faster clinical responses in MDD and TRD.

Introduction

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) uses magnetic
pulses or weak electric currents to induce changes in
cortical excitability and modulate brain networks in
localized areas. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimu-
lation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation technique that uses a

magnetic ﬁeld to stimulate focal cortical brain regions
with electrical currents. Recently, rTMS has gained
growing interest for the treatment of major depression
(MDD) and treatment resistant depression (TRD). MDD
is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that severely
impairs functioning and diminishes quality of life. The
global prevalence of MDD increased by almost 13% dur-
ing 2007–20171. Also, relapse rates are higher than for
any other medical condition2. Core symptoms of major
depressive episodes include depressed mood, decreased
drive, loss of interest and pleasure. Numerous accessory

symptoms co-occur and illness course may vary sig-
niﬁcantly (i.e., singular, recurring or chronic), deﬁning
different levels of depression severity. As a result, MDD is
a highly heterogeneous syndrome encompassing varied
symptom clusters and divergent treatment responses.
30–50% of patients do not adequately respond to ﬁrst-line
treatments, which generally involve a combination of
antidepressant medication and cognitive-behavioral ther-
apy3. Conventional antidepressants target the main neu-
rotransmitter systems thought to be implicated in MDD
(e.g., serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine) and are asso-
ciated with considerable variations in efﬁcacy. A recent,
comprehensive and large-scale meta-analysis revealed
that antidepressants are generally more effective than
placebo, although the overall effect size (0.3) is modest4.
Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is deﬁned as the
absence of a clinical response despite at least 2 con-
secutive antidepressant trials (at adequate doses for at
least 4–6 weeks). TRD is a major public health concern;
functional
is greater and suicide risk is
higher5. Despite the promising recent FDA approval of
esketamine for TRD, there is a clear unmet need for
rapidly-acting and efﬁcacious treatments6,7.

impairment

The effects of neuromodulation produce a dynamic
regulation of brain circuitry rather than directly affect
neurotransmission. During rTMS, magnetic pulses are
delivered by coils of different shapes (planar, ﬁgure-of-
eight, helmets) at different frequencies (usually between 1
and 20 Hz) and intensities to determine changes in the
excitability of speciﬁc brain areas. rTMS induces lasting
changes in cortical excitability8. Repeated low-frequency
stimulation (1 Hz) and the continuous form of theta-burst
stimulation (cTBS) induce a suppression of excitatory
synaptic transmission, while high-frequency stimulation
(regular 5–50 Hz) and the intermittent form of theta-burst
stimulation (iTBS) potentiate it9,10. In light of its effec-
tiveness, rTMS is recommended by CANMAT guidelines
as a ﬁrst-line intervention after failure of one adequate
antidepressant trial11. Evidence from meta-analyses sug-
gests that rTMS has a comparable effect to ECT and
antidepressant medication12. Recently, rTMS has been
approved by the FDA for TRD. In the clinical setting,
converging evidence supports a relevant role of physical
therapies to treat TRD, mainly in the framework of inte-
grated approaches, with response rates between 30 and
64% observed after rTMS interventions. Besides, rTMS is
supposed to be a potential therapeutic option for sub-
stance use disorders (e.g.,13,14). Usually, rTMS protocols
for MDD deliver 10 Hz stimulation of the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at an intensity of 120% of the
resting motor threshold (RMT) over 4–6 weeks in once-
daily stimulation sessions15. Other protocols are available
(i.e., right DLPFC inhibition, medial PFC stimulation) and
appear to reduce depressive symptoms. Though rTMS is a

promising treatment option for MDD, clinical response is
partial, highlighting the need for a more thorough
understanding of MDD pathophysiology and of mechan-
isms implicated in rTMS therapeutic action.

Most knowledge on rTMS comes from clinical studies
as application to animal models has been problematic16. A
major setback is lack of speciﬁcity of stimulation targets.
While in humans technological advances allow for a very
high level of accuracy (resulting in an isolated stimulation
of a speciﬁc region), difﬁculty in maintaining small-scale
focus has slowed rTMS use in animal models17. This has
hampered gaining of the necessary understanding of the
neurobiological basis of rTMS to develop personalized
interventions and to clarify which stimulation protocols
(i.e., number of pulses, stimulation frequency, and inter-
session pauses) yield faster responses, allowing only for
empirically-based treatment protocols (stimulation pro-
tocols applied in clinical trials present limited variability
in terms of rTMS intervention characteristics). Recently,
optimization of
(e.g.,
mechanical restraint vs. anesthetic use18) and develop-
ment of smaller sized coils speciﬁcally designed for pre-
clinical application19 have laid the foundations
for
improved translational studies.

rTMS use in animal models

Numerous preclinical approaches have been developed
over the years to model aspects of MDD in rodents20,21.
The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUS or CMS or
CUMS; hereinafter referred to as CUS) is one of the most
extensively investigated models22. It involves continuous
exposure over several weeks to a variety of mild manip-
ulations acting as low-grade stressors, determining induc-
tion of depressive-like symptoms, such as anhedonia (i.e.,
loss of pleasure for natural rewards), commonly measured
by the sucrose preference test (SPT). This model simulates
other phenotypic alterations isomorphic to human MDD
symptoms, such as increased immobility in the forced swim
test (FST) and changes in sleep architecture and locomotor
activity22. Preclinical studies have the potential to shed light
on new neurobiological-based rationales for rTMS use and
to help identify optimal stimulation protocols (i.e., number
of pulses, stimulation frequency and intersession pauses).
In order to assess the current status of translational
application of rTMS in the preclinical ﬁeld as a treatment
for MDD, we systematically reviewed studies using rTMS
in rodent models. We included studies applying rTMS to
both animal models of depression and healthy animals
that assessed changes in terms of depressive-like mea-
sures. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis on the
efﬁcacy of
recovery from the
depressive phenotype, analyzing the possible impact of
different experimental models and neuromodulation
protocols on treatment outcome. Data are discussed to
elucidate the translational relevance of preclinical ﬁndings
in developing effective treatments for MDD and TRD.

Methods
Review protocol

The systematic search was conducted in accordance
for Systematic
with the Preferred Reporting Items
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines23,24.
The protocol (using SYRCLE’s systematic review protocol
format for animal intervention studies25; Supplementary
item 1) was submitted to the PROSPERO registry on
November 6th, 2019 and registered on November 29th,
2019 (registration number: CRD42019157549).

Literature search and study identiﬁcation

A systematic literature search was conducted by com-
prehensive searches in three online databases (PubMed,
Scopus, Web of Science). The search strategy consisted of
two main components: repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) and depression, and results were
limited to rats and mice studies (as, together with ﬁsh,
they are the main species used for scientiﬁc purposes in
Europe26,27). The complete search strategies used in each
database are presented in the supplementary material
(Supplementary item 2). Searches were conducted on
November 11th, 2019.

The following prioritization of exclusion criteria was used
for both the 1st (i.e., titles and abstracts) and the 2nd (i.e.,
full-text articles) screening phases: (1) language other than
English; (2) non-original researches (e.g., reviews, com-
mentaries, editorials, book chapters); (3) no full-text articles
(e.g., meeting abstracts); (4) studies in vitro, studies in
humans, studies in non-human animals other than rodents;
(5) other outcome measures reported (e.g., anxiety) in the
absence of an assessment of the depressive-like phenotype;
(6) neuromodulation interventions other than rTMS (e.g.,
transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS); (7) animals
not exposed to the sham rTMS intervention as compara-
tor/control. Within each phase, two independent reviewers
screened each article (AO, FZ), with discrepancies being
resolved through discussion or by consulting additional
investigators (MP, MB).

Data extraction and synthesis
Qualitative synthesis

The full-text articles of studies eligible for qualitative
data extraction were independently assessed by multiple
reviewers (AO, FZ for data regarding the animal model;
AM, AS for data regarding the stimulation parameters),
with discrepancies that could not be resolved by discus-
sion being solved by consulting additional investigators
(MP, MB). The data extracted included the following
(i) bibliographic details; (ii) animal model
categories:
characteristics;
(iv)
intervention characteristics. Detailed information on the
study characteristics extracted within each category is
reported in the protocol (Supplementary item 1). Our

study design characteristics;

(iii)

primary outcome measure was the variation of
the
depressive-like phenotype in subjects exposed to active
rTMS compared with sham intervention. In particular, we
retrieved data on the direction of the variation (i.e.,
recovery vs. deterioration, including the augmenting or
antagonizing effects of concomitant pharmacological
interventions) of the reported variables within each test at
all reported timepoints (i.e., ongoing, short-term, long-
term). Additional outcome measures (when available)
were the variation of other behavioral phenotypes relevant
to depression (i.e., anxiety,
locomotion, body weight)
resulting from active (vs. sham) rTMS intervention.

Quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)

The studies included in the qualitative synthesis were
also eligible for quantitative data extraction. Selected
outcomes were the short-term variation (i.e., 24 h after the
last rTMS session) of the anhedonic proﬁle and of the
helplessness proﬁle. If the 24-h timepoint had not been
collected, data closest to the last rTMS session were
extracted. Statistical details to enable the computation of
standardized effect sizes, namely number of animals,
mean and standard deviation (SD), were independently
extracted by multiple reviewers (AO, FZ) from the graphs
using a digital screen ruler28.

Effect size calculations were based on the comparison
between the group receiving active rTMS intervention
and the control group (sham). The intervention effect for
each individual treated-control comparison was expressed
as standardized difference in means (SDM; difference in
mean between treated and control groups on pooled SD).
The individual SDMs were pooled to obtain an overall
SDM and 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI; indicating a
range within which it can be 95% certain that the true
effect lies). Whenever a control group served more than
one experimental group, we corrected the total number of
control animals in the meta-analysis by dividing the
number of animals in the control group by the number of
intervention groups served29.

Heterogeneity among results was explored by con-
ducting subgroup analyses by rTMS intervention’s fre-
quency and by type of animal model. Nevertheless, as
animal studies are usually rather heterogeneous with
respect to numerous factors (e.g., species/strain, proce-
dures, etc.28,29), a random-effect model was used to
compute both the overall effect size and the separate
effect sizes for the different subgroups, in order to take
into account heterogeneity that cannot be explained. In
the presence of one or two studies presenting character-
istics that render them different from the others, a sen-
sitivity analysis was performed excluding those studies
from the meta-analysis.

We calculated the I2 statistic for each analysis as a mea-
sure of the proportion of the overall variation that is

attributable to between-study heterogeneity30,31. Speciﬁ-
cally, we considered an I2 of less than 40% as low, between
30 and 60% as moderate, between 50 and 90% as sub-
stantial, and between 75 and 100% as considerable32.

To assess potential publication bias, a funnel plot of
study effect sizes against standard errors was visually
inspected for asymmetry resulting from a relative lack of
small studies with small effect sizes (i.e., those most likely
to be non-signiﬁcant and to remain unpublished).
Asymmetry was also statistically tested with Egger’s bias
test33 with p < 0.05 indicating asymmetry. Statistical ana-
lyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis (CMA), version 3.0. Statistical signiﬁcance was
set at p < 0.05.

Assessment of the risk of bias

To assess the internal validity/methodological quality of
the included studies, we used the SYRCLE’s Risk of Bias
(RoB) tool for animal studies, developed by Hooijmans

and co-authors34 by adjusting the Cochrane’s RoB tool35
for aspects of bias that play a speciﬁc role in animal stu-
dies. The RoB tool for animal studies contains 10 entries
related to selection bias, performance bias, detection bias,
attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. Two inde-
pendent reviewers (AO, AM) performed the quality
assessment of each article by independently assessing the
criteria.

Results
Study selection

The comprehensive search strategy on the effects of
rTMS on depressive-like symptoms in rodent models
resulted in 298 bibliographic records. The study selection
process is summarized in Fig. 1 by using the PRISMA ﬂow
diagram. References were exported to Excel and, after
duplicates were removed, 204 studies were left. The 1st
selection phase (i.e., titles and abstracts screening) resul-
ted in 33 studies; the 2nd selection phase (i.e., full-text

articles screening) resulted in 23 studies eligible for
inclusion in the systematic review, of which 22 could also
be included in the meta-analysis (1 study36, was excluded
as the number of animals in the control group after the
required correction could not be processed by the CMA
software).

Study characteristics

The characteristics of

the 23 included studies are
described in Table 1. The assessment of the depressive-
like phenotype was quite homogeneous; speciﬁcally, 15
articles37–51 investigated the helplessness proﬁle through
the Forced swim test (FST), 2 articles52,53 the anhedonic
proﬁle through the sucrose preference/consumption test
(SPT/SCT) whilst the remaining 6 articles36,54–58 inves-
tigated both. In addition, the anxiety proﬁle was assessed
in 9 articles37,40,46,47,51,54–56,58 (by means of 5 different
tests) and other behavioral proﬁles (i.e., general activity,
weight measurement, social interaction, etc.) were asses-
sed in 12 articles36,37,40,42,45,46,51–53,56–58.

In 22 out of 23 articles at least one assessment of the
depressive-like phenotype was performed shortly after the
end of the rTMS intervention. Only in 1 article52 tests
were performed only during the rTMS intervention (in
this case the one closest to the end was selected). Speci-
ﬁcally, for the short-term evaluation of rTMS efﬁcacy
(included in the meta-analysis), the timing of the tests
relative to the neurostimulation intervention was as fol-
lows: 24 h after the last rTMS session (12 articles36,38–
44,47,54,55,57); immediately after the last rTMS session (5
articles37,48–50,53); between 24 and 72 h after the last rTMS
session (3 articles45,46,58); during the week following the
end of the rTMS intervention (2 articles51,56); during the
last week of the rTMS intervention (1 article52).

A number of articles also reported ongoing and long-
term evaluations of rTMS efﬁcacy performed at various
additional timepoints (not included in the meta-analysis).
Interestingly, 3 articles out of 23 extended the evaluation
of rTMS efﬁcacy to the long-term period (i.e., >1 week
after the last rTMS session): 1 week and 2 weeks after the
last session of a 10-days intervention44; during the 2nd
week after a 5-weeks intervention46; during the 3rd week
after a 3-weeks intervention56.

Treated subjects were either models of depression (11
articles36,38,45,50,52–58) or models of other disorders with
comorbid depression (3 articles40,47,51) or healthy animal
models (9 articles37,39,41–44,46,48,49) receiving active rTMS
intervention; control subjects were either models of
depression or animals modeling other disorders or heal-
thy animals receiving the sham rTMS intervention,
respectively. Regarding the models of depression, 8 arti-
cles36,52–58 employed the chronic unpredictable mild
stress

cles36,52,54,57,58, 3-week protocol in 2 articles53,55, 8-week

article38 applied a lesion to obtain the olfactory bulbect-
omy model of agitated depression59. The models of
comorbid depression were a model of anxiety from
selective breeding47, a model of autism through neonatal
isolation51 and a model of epilepsy by means of pentyle-
netetrazol administration40.

In 12 out of 14 articles employing a disease model, the
rTMS intervention was entirely preceded by the disorder

The neurostimulation parameters among studies varied
considerably. The frequencies employed ranged from
0.5 Hz to 50 Hz (<5 Hz in 6 articles36,40,45,49,51,58, =5 Hz in
3 articles36,49,58, >5 Hz in 20 articles36–39,41–50,52–57;
5 studies employed more frequencies in distinct groups of

threshold (MT; from 50 to 130%) and/or % device max-
imum power; 2 studies36,38 employed more intensities in
distinct groups of animals and 1 study40 did not mention
this parameter. Number of pulses per single session (i.e.,
N pulses per train × N trains) and total number of pulses
administered during the entire intervention varied greatly,
from 45 to 15,000 and from 420 to 150,000 respectively.
When mentioned, the inter-train interval ranged from 2
to 120 s. The total number of sessions per intervention
varied from 5 to 28 (≤7 in 8 articles36,47–49,54,55,57,58, >7 in
15 articles37–46,50–53,56).
the inter-session
interval was 24 h (up to 72 h in the 4 studies that inter-
rupted treatment for weekends38,42,46,53; up to 120 h in47)
as no accelerated protocols were applied. Whilst 5 stu-
dies36,42,54,55,57 did not mention the type of coil, the
remaining studies used 3 types of coil (for details about
coil size and position see Table 1). Only 1 article used
anesthesia47.

In general,

Only 2 articles used female subjects (pool of males and
females51; comparison between males and females41), the
remaining 21 articles employed only male subjects. Only 2
articles38,50 employed mice (C57 strain), the remaining 21
articles used rats (Sprague-Dawley or Wistar strains); age
and/or weight were rather heterogeneous (for details see
Table 1). Finally, only 4 articles54–57 evaluated the
potential additive/antagonistic effects deriving from the
concomitant administration of neuromodulation and

rTMS efﬁcacy on depressive-like symptoms

The effects of rTMS intervention on helplessness and
anhedonia on all reported parameters (within each test) are
illustrated in Table 2 and in Table 3, respectively. For the
purpose of the systematic review, the tables include, under
separate headings, not only the 24-h outcome (or the
outcome closest to the last rTMS session), which was
included in the meta-analysis, but also the outcomes from
all reported timepoints (on-going, shorth-term, long-term).

Quantitative analysis of rTMS efﬁcacy on the helplessness
proﬁle

Twenty studies (29 independent comparisons) mea-
sured the short-term efﬁcacy of rTMS on the immobility/
activity duration in the FST (Table 2). It should be noted
that the recovery of the depressed phenotype in all studies
but one corresponds to decreased immobility or increased
activity in the FST; only in the model of agitated
depression38
to increased
the recovery corresponds
immobility duration. Overall, rTMS led to a signiﬁcant
the phenotype in models of disease or
recovery of
improvement of the behavioral proﬁle in healthy models
(322 treated animals, 232 control animals; SDM = 1.34; CI
95%: 1.02–1.66; Z = 8.21, p < 0.001; Supplementary item
3). Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was 60%.

Eleven studies (15 comparisons) assessed the effects of
rTMS in animal models of disease: 5 studies (6 compar-
isons)
in the chronic unpredictable stress model of
depression and 6 studies (9 comparisons) in other models
of depression; the latter subgroup included 3 studies (3
comparisons) in models of other disorders with comorbid
depression. In the remaining 9 studies (14 comparisons)
rTMS effects were evaluated in healthy models. Recovery/
improvement in the helplessness proﬁle was observed in
the CUS model (67 treated animals, 55 control animals;
SDM = 1.71; CI 95%: 1.00–2.42; Z = 4.73; p < 0.001, I2 =
63%), in other models (116 treated animals, 74 control
animals; SDM = 1.32; CI 95%: 0.73–1.90; Z = 4.42, p <
0.001, I2 = 75%) and in healthy models (139 treated ani-
animals; SDM = 1.20; CI 95%:
mals, 103 control
0.72–1.67; Z = 4.90; p < 0.001, I2 = 40%; Fig. 2).

In 17 of the selected studies (22 comparisons) rTMS
was given at high frequency (>5 Hz),
in 5 studies (5
comparisons) at low frequency (<5 Hz) and in 2 studies (2
comparisons) at 5 Hz. The latter were excluded as (i) they
were not enough to create an additional subgroup, (ii)
they could not be attributed to either the low or the high
frequency subgroups16,60. Recovery/improvement in the
helplessness proﬁle was observed in animals treated at
high frequency (241 treated animals, 178 control animals;
SDM = 1.28; CI 95%: 0.93–1.63; Z = 7.21; p < 0.001, I2 =
60%) and in animals treated with rTMS at low frequency
(61 treated animals, 46 control animals; SDM = 1.28;
CI95%: 0.56–2.01; Z = 3.46; p = 0.001, I2 = 28%; Fig. 3).

A sensitivity analysis, performed excluding 3 compar-
isons presenting characteristics that render them different
from the others (anesthesia:47; particularly high fre-
quencies, i.e., 50 Hz and 30 Hz:42,43), conﬁrmed the ben-
eﬁcial effect of rTMS on helplessness proﬁle (293 treated
animals, 203 control animals; SDM = 1.29; CI 95%:
0.96–1.62; Z = 7.61, p < 0.001, I2 = 58%).

Inspection of the funnel plot of study effect sizes
(SDMs) against standard errors (Supplementary item
4a) suggested asymmetry. Speciﬁcally, the funnel plot
shows larger studies (smaller SE, appearing towards
the top of the graph) clustered near the mean effect
(higher SE, appearing
size, while smaller
towards the bottom of
the graph) more dispersed
across a wider range of values; the graph also shows a
lack of small studies with small effect sizes. Egger’s test
conﬁrmed asymmetry that was consistent with pub-
lication bias (p = 0.001).

Quantitative analysis of rTMS efﬁcacy on the anhedonic
proﬁle

Seven studies (8 independent comparisons) measured
the short-term efﬁcacy of rTMS on the sucrose preference
index/ratio in the SPT or sucrose intake in the SCT (Table 3).
Overall, rTMS led to a signiﬁcant improvement in the
anhedonic proﬁle (86 treated animals, 74 control animals;
SDM = 1.87; CI 95%: 1.02–2.72; Z = 4.30, p < 0.001;
Fig. 4). Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was 80%.

Inspection of

the funnel plot of study effect sizes
(SDMs) against standard errors (Supplementary item 4b)
suggested asymmetry. Speciﬁcally, the top of the graph
(larger studies, smaller SE), shows a higher concentration
of studies on the left side of the mean effect size (i.e.,
smaller effects or no effects) while the bottom of the
funnel plot (smaller studies, higher SE) shows a higher
concentration of studies on the right side of the mean
larger effects). Egger’s test conﬁrmed
effect size (i.e.,
asymmetry that was consistent with publication bias
(p = 0.001).

Other considerations

Regarding the long-term efﬁcacy, 2 studies reported
persistent beneﬁcial effects on depressive-like symptoms
during the 2nd week after a 5-weeks intervention46 and
during the 3rd week after a 3-weeks intervention56. By
contrast, 1 study did not detect a signiﬁcant improvement
neither 1 week nor 2 weeks after a 10-days intervention44.
As for the augmenting or antagonizing effects of con-
comitant pharmacological interventions, 1 study reported
an additive effect of rTMS and the atypical antipsychotic
quetiapine on both helplessness (compared with quetia-
pine alone) and anhedonia (compared with both rTMS
alone and quetiapine alone)54; 2 studies reported an
antagonizing effect of rTMS and the CB1 receptor

Notes. Horizontal lines represent 95% CIs. The area of each square is proportional to the study weight in the analysis. The diamond represents pooled
estimates from random-effects meta-analysis. Red line represents the overall effect. Studies with multiple experimental groups (i.e., exposed to rTMS
intervention with a different number of pulses per intervention or a different intensity) are split in multiple lines (indicated by a, b, c, d); these were
considered as independent comparisons in the meta-analysis after correcting the total number of control animals by dividing the number of animals
in the control group by the number of intervention groups served. A: active rTMS intervention; S: sham rTMS intervention; SDM: standardized mean

antagonist AM251 (by either i.p. or intra-hippocampal
injections) on both helplessness (compared with rTMS
alone) and anhedonia (compared with rTMS alone)55,57.
Finally, although the rTMS intervention produced anti-
depressant effects similar to those of the antidepressant
venlafaxine on both helplessness and anhedonia,
the
combination of the 2 interventions had no additive effect
compared with either rTMS or venlafaxine alone56.

rTMS efﬁcacy on other behavioral phenotypes relevant to
depression

The effects of rTMS intervention on anxiety and other
proﬁles on all available parameters (within each test) and
timepoints (on-going, shorth-term,
long-term) are illu-
strated in Table 4 and in Supplementary item 5, respectively.

Anxiety

The effects of rTMS intervention on the anxiety proﬁle
were mixed (Table 4); a beneﬁcial effect was reported in
2 studies out of 5 in the Elevated plus-maze test (EPMT),
as evidenced by the increased time spent on open
arms40,51, in 1 study out of 2 in the Open-ﬁeld test (OPT),
in terms of increased time spent in the center58, and in the
2 studies employing the Novelty-suppressed feeding test

(NSFT), as evidenced by the decreased latency to feed55,56.
Interestingly, the rTMS intervention did not ameliorate
symptoms in the model of anxiety47,
in spite of the
recovery of the comorbid depressive-like proﬁle.

Other domains

As for the effects of the neurostimulation intervention
on general activity, 3 studies out of 8 reported an increase
in distance traveled in the OFT (Supplementary item 5,
which also contains a comment on the potential con-
founding effects due to changes in locomotor activity in
the interpretation of the readouts used to assess the
effectiveness of rTMS). Although the rTMS intervention
had no effect on social interactions in 2 studies employing
healthy models, an increased sociality was reported in a
model of autism51. In 2 studies the treatment attenuated
the weight reduction induced by the CUS procedure52,53.
Finally, rTMS did not produce antinociception42 or affect
the appetitive drive56.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias assessment of all included studies is
shown in Fig. 5. Reporting of experimental details in
animal studies is often poor (e.g.,61) and, consequently,

studies had an overall unclear risk of bias based on
SYRCLE’s RoB tool
(55.3%). For 2 instances (20%),
assessing reporting bias was judge as “not applicable”34.
When not unclear, the risk of bias was generally low
(24.2%), with the only exception of one study for the item
“Attrition bias” (0.5%).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review and
meta-analysis aiming to evaluate rTMS efﬁcacy in pre-
clinical models of depression. Overall, results show a
largely beneﬁcial effect of active rTMS compared to sham
stimulation, as reﬂected in the statistically signiﬁcant

Fig. 5 Risk of bias assessment, score (%) per risk of bias item. The RoB tool for animal studies contains 10 entries related to selection bias,
performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. For each entry, signaling questions were formulated to facilitate
judgment34: “yes” indicates low risk of bias, “no” indicates high risk of bias, and “unclear” indicates an unclear risk of bias. If one of the relevant
signaling questions is answered with “no,” this indicates high risk of bias for that speciﬁc entry. Assessing reporting bias was judge as “not applicable”
for 2 items. In this respect it should be noted that the “Reporting bias” item was prospectively included in the SYRCLE’s tool (in agreement with the
Cochrane’s tool) although at present difﬁcult to assess, as protocols for animal studies are not yet mandatorily registered in central, publicly accessible
databases34,99.

stress-induced
an

depression models
antidepressant-sensitive depression model22). As
for
rTMS treatment characteristics, parameters varied con-
siderably in terms of frequency, intensity and duration.

Notwithstanding the paucity and heterogeneity of stu-
dies, results are generally consistent. As expected, an overt
depressive-like phenotype (i.e., CUS model) was more
likely to be associated with a larger effect size. The posi-
tive direction of the effect was consistent across studies
for both helplessness and anhedonia, though with differ-
ent magnitude. Robust results were obtained both in
models of depression and healthy animals. The effective-
ness of rTMS in healthy models compares with human
studies involving non-depressed patients and healthy
subjects. For example, left human DLPFC stimulation has
been demonstrated to reverse hedonic tone dysfunction in
addicted subjects62, as well as to induce a more pro-
nounced sensitivity to rewarding stimuli in healthy sub-
jects63,64. Also, rTMS appeared to selectively reverse
depressive-like symptoms while effects on other domains
(e.g., anxiety) were rather mixed. This differential effect
suggests that a “pure” depressive phenotype may be a
speciﬁc and meaningful clinical target of rTMS inter-
ventions. Present data conﬁrm the relevance of rTMS use
in MDD and give an indication as to which patient sub-
type may beneﬁt the most (i.e., “pure” depression as
opposed to anxious and/or agitated forms). Preliminary
suggestions on possible synergistic (i.e., rTMS combined
with quetiapine) and antagonizing (i.e., rTMS combined
with CB1 receptor antagonist) interactions between neu-
romodulation and pharmacotherapy also emerge. Trans-
lational ﬁndings from future preclinical studies should
investigate other augmenting (e.g.,
lithium) effects of
pharmacological agents and help guide integrated (rTMS
plus pharmacotherapy) approaches65.

the

reversal of depressive-like

Clinical translation of results is also signiﬁcant in terms
of
symptomatology
regardless of certain neuromodulation parameters (i.e.,
frequency and duration). Indeed, reversal of the depres-
sive phenotype was obtained independently of rTMS
frequency. This result may be of translational relevance,
given that current clinical applications of rTMS include
use at both high and low frequencies, though targets have
a different lateralization. Accruing evidence indicates an
imbalance between the left and right DLPFC in MDD,
supporting the need for differentiated stimulation/inhi-
bition lateralized protocols
to counterbalance such
asymmetry. Left-right DLPFC imbalance is associated
with neuropsychological (i.e., negative emotional
judg-
ment66) and metabolic alterations (i.e.,
left/dominant
glutamate/GABA-related motor
hypoexcit-
ability67), both involved in MDD pathophysiology. The
fact that up to now lateralization has not been possible in
animal models is a major limitation of preclinical studies
that hampers accurate translation and substantiation of
the right-left prefrontal
imbalance pathophysiological
hypothesis66. To overcome the lack of speciﬁcity of sti-
mulation, coils optimized for precise targets—speciﬁcally
application—are needed19.
designed for preclinical
Hopefully, technological advances and increased interest
towards rTMS in animal models will allow the develop-
ment of smaller sized coils for isolated stimulation of
speciﬁc regions38. The availability of optimized coils will
also allow to extend the investigation to smaller species
(the presence of only 2 studies employing mice should be
considered as a limitation).

heterogeneity was considerably lower for studies per-
formed in healthy subjects, while there was still sub-
stantial evidence of high heterogeneity particularly
between studies employing “other” models. This is likely
due to the diversity of approaches used to induce
depression (e.g., genetic68,69,
lesion59, selective breed-
ing70,71). Lack of studies assessing rTMS efﬁcacy in the
same type of model (the “other” subgroup comprises
6 studies in 6 different models) precluded the possibility
to reﬁne subgroup analysis. As for anhedonia, even
though all studies employed the CUS model, there was
still substantial evidence of high heterogeneity, which may
be partly attributed to individual differences in rats’
hedonic status, as well as to differences in sucrose con-
centration (1% vs. 2%). It is worth noting that the duration
of stress application (3 vs. 8 weeks) and the stress regime
itself may also explain some of the discrepancies among
studies22. A subgroup analysis could not be performed
due to the paucity of studies.

Though rTMS appears to signiﬁcantly reverse the
depressive phenotype, results from the present meta-
analysis do not allow us to draw conclusions on its rela-
tive efﬁcacy on speciﬁc depression models due to the low
representation of the different existing models (e.g., early
life stress, social stress, genetically engineered rodents20,21).
To date, only the CUS model is well-represented (8 out of
the 11 studies included, the remaining employed 3 different
and incomparable models). Models addressing the inter-
action between environmental and predisposing genetic
factors in the induction of depressive-like phenotypes are
still rarely employed but highly relevant as they resemble
real-life clinical situations (e.g., paradigms superimposing
poor maternal care or mild early life stress on 5-HTT
knockout rodents72,73 or investigating the interaction
between reduced 5-HT and increased glucocorticoids
during early postnatal life74,75). Extending rTMS studies to
other models of depression that involve different patho-
genic mechanisms is therefore crucial to test its effective-
ness and to inform on the biological basis of treatment
response to rTMS.

Stress models of depression, while well-validated in
preclinical research, encompass a broad array of symp-
toms thus possibly diluting speciﬁc target
treatment
effects and introducing bias when examining biological
changes associated with rTMS. Narrower phenotypes may
capture the biological effects of rTMS and improve pre-
diction of treatment response63. The DSM-5 deﬁnition of
MDD likely represents an aggregate of different and
probably highly diverse disease subtypes, each of which
should be studied independently and might require spe-
ciﬁc therapeutic strategies76. It is very unlikely that DSM-
5 MDD symptoms cluster as a consequence of a single
pathophysiological process, especially in light of accruing
evidence indicating distinct endophenotypes (e.g., resting

state neural networks, genetic proﬁles) for patients with
different symptom proﬁles diagnosed as having MDD77.
In this context, translating preclinical results into clinical
practice requires the use of other validated models of
depression (corresponding to distinct endophenotypes)
and, whenever possible, of additional and/or more
sophisticated tests to evaluate depressive-like symptoma-
tology78. This will help identify diagnostic biomarkers that
predict response to rTMS and develop more tailored
interventions79. To date, only the FST is well-represented
(for further details on how the readouts used to assess the
effectiveness of rTMS were controlled for potential
changes in locomotor activity see Supplementary item 5),
a limitation that should be considered when interpreting
the ﬁndings of this work21. In spite of the numerous
controversies existing around its ability to reproduce
behavioral despair/helplessness
FST
remains one of the most widely used tests to screen
antidepressant effects82,83.

Current animal models of depression,

including CUS,
respond to conventional antidepressants. Therefore, they
can inform about the antidepressant-like efﬁcacy of a novel
intervention but have limited utility in predicting whether
such intervention will also be effective in patients suffering
from TRD. To overcome this issue, future studies should
involve treatment-resistant animal models of depression7
(at present, there are no studies on the effects of rTMS in
these models). CUS-exposed rodents that fail to respond to
non-
conventional
responders84,85. Also, Wistar-Kyoto rats subjected to CUS
have been recently validated as a model of TRD86,87.
Notably, these models showed a good response to deep
brain stimulation84–87; however, the effects of rTMS in
these treatment-resistant animals have not yet been studied.
Sex differences in depressive-like symptomatology have
been evidenced in several animal models (e.g., CUS, FSL)
and tests (e.g., FST) and there are marked sex differences
in the prevalence of MDD88,89. The presence of only
2 studies including female subjects should therefore be
considered as a limitation. Preclinical experiments are
often conducted only in males (and, when they do include
both sexes, subgroup analyses are often not reported),
while clinical trials include both men and women90,91.
This issue may partly explain why clinical trials repeatedly
fail to conﬁrm the expected beneﬁts of new treatment
approaches that have shown favorable proﬁles in pre-
clinical studies92. To maximize translation of research
ﬁndings to the clinical practice, sex should be considered
as an important biological variable from basic and pre-
clinical research90,91. To overcome the issue of overlooked
and underreported sex and gender in research across
disciplines,
the SAGER guidelines (Sex And Gender
Equity in Research) were published in 201693. Accord-
ingly, numerous scientiﬁc journals are revising their

editorial policies requiring clear reporting of the sex/
gender of research subjects and to analyze data by sex94.
Future studies should also test whether rTMS effects
persist longitudinally and, if so, to what extent, as cur-
rently follow-up evaluations are rarely performed.

Studies had an overall unclear risk of bias based on
SYRCLE’s RoB tool. Unfortunately, this conﬁrms that
reporting of methodological details in animal studies
remains poor (e.g.,61,94), even after publication in 2010 of
the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In
Vivo Experiments95), which were developed to improve
the design, analysis and reporting of research using ani-
mals. Although ARRIVE guidelines are currently endorsed
by numerous scientiﬁc journals and societies96, most ani-
mal research papers still fail to meet minimum reporting
standards (e.g.,97,98). In particular, none of the 13 articles
published after 2010 declares adherence to ARRIVE
guidelines. However,
in the absence of mandatory
reporting standards for pre-clinical animal studies, we
cannot assume that the authors conducted their experi-
ment in an inappropriate way; therefore, studies were not
excluded based on a poor-quality score. Nevertheless,
there is an urgent need to overcome the issue of largely
unclear risk of bias in animal studies by improving com-
pliance with the ARRIVE guidelines as (i) poor reporting
of animal research hinders the quality of research and its
potential to translate into the clinic; (ii) the quality of a
systematic review/meta-analysis is dependent on the
quality of the included studies, and not knowing the actual
risk of bias hampers our ability to draw reliable conclu-
sions. An approach that may likely mitigate the reporting
bias in preclinical studies is constituted by the possibility
to prioritize manuscripts that were preceded by a pre-
registration procedure analogous to systematic reviews99.
this meta-analysis
supports the efﬁcacy of rTMS interventions in amelior-
ating phenotypic alterations isomorphic to human MDD
symptoms in laboratory rodents. Predictions of the effects
of rTMS, such as changes on the molecular and cellular
levels up to modulations of brain networks, need further
investigation in order to reconcile the varying observa-
tions that have been made so far in the rTMS ﬁeld16.
Large scale, prospective, and well-designed animal studies
are necessary to clarify which stimulation protocols (i.e.,
number of pulses, stimulation frequency and intersession
pauses) maximize clinical effects and to develop cost-
effective protocols, with the potential of yielding faster
clinical responses (i.e., accelerated rTMS100–102). Further
exploration of rTMS use in rodent models will promote
data-driven identiﬁcation of prognostically-informative
depression endophenotypes to be used in real-world
MDD treatment settings to predict which patients are
more likely to respond to rTMS, thus working toward a
patient-tailored intervention for MDD and TRD. This will
