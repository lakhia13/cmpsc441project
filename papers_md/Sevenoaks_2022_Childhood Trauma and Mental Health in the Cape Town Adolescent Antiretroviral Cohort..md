Abstract
This study aimed to assess the association of childhood trauma, stressful life events and HIV stigma with mental health in South African
adolescents from the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Life Events
Questionnaire and the HIV Stigma Scale for South African Adolescents Living with HIV was used to assess childhood trauma,
stressful life events and stigma in adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV and healthy controls enrolled in the CTAAC. These
measures were associated with mental health outcomes including the Beck-Youth Inventories, Child Behaviour Checklist, Columbian
Impairment Scale, Childrens Motivation Scale, Conners Scale for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder using Pearson correlations
and self-reported alcohol use, using Spearman-rank correlation. 63.7% of adolescents reported at least one childhood trauma on the
CTQ. Significant associations were reported between CTQ measures and Beck-Youth Inventories. Emotional abuse was associated
with anxiety, anger, depression and disruptive behaviour. Emotional neglect was associated with poor self-concept and disruptive
behaviour. LEQ total score was significantly associated with Beck-Youth Inventories including anxiety, depression, anger and
disruptive behaviour scales. HIV stigma was significantly associated with Beck-Youth Inventories including depression, anger and
disruptive behaviour. Childhood trauma, stressful life events and HIV stigma in South African adolescents are associated with anxiety,
depression, anger, disruptive-behaviour and poor self-concept. This study highlights the importance of enquiring about exposure to a
variety of traumas, particularly those commonly experienced by South African adolescents. In addition, it is important to understand the
impact of trauma exposure on each individuals mental health and functioning.

Mental health symptoms are, amongst numerous other out-
comes, associated with childhood trauma in adolescents
(Aebi et al., 2015; Ballard et al., 2015; Larson et al., 2017;
Mills et al., 2013; de Moraes et al., 2018). Mental health
symptoms account for 16% of the global burden of disease
in adolescents aged 10–19 years (WHO, 2019), with many
common mental disorders beginning in adolescence (Patel
et al., 2007). For instance, the prevalence rates of common
mental health symptoms, such as depression, in South
African female adolescents have been found to be as high as
44.6% (Cheng et al., 2014). Moreover, 12% of adolescents
living with HIV screened positive for symptoms of depres-
sion, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (West et al.,
2019). A number of reviews have indicated that adolescents
who experience significant childhood trauma and negative
lifetime events may be at increased risk of depression, anxiety,

attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral issues and
substance use disorders to name a few (Dvir et al., 2014;
Kilpatrick et al., 2003; Larson et al., 2017; Norman et al.,
2012; Simpson & Miller, 2002). It is important to note that
there are a significant number of additional risk factors that
increase the risk of common mental health symptoms.

Some studies suggest that adolescents may be at increased
risk of exposure to chronic trauma (Larson et al., 2017;
Macdonald et al., 2010; Overstreet & Mathews, 2011). This
concept describes multiple and repeated exposure to traumatic
events (Macdonald et al., 2010; Overstreet & Mathews, 2011),
which may in turn exacerbate mental health symptoms. This is
particularly relevant in South Africa where the majority of
youth come from disadvantaged backgrounds (Leeper et al.,
2019; Toska et al., 2019). For example, a large proportion of
adolescents are exposed to chronic violence, such as repeated
assault, frequently in the context of substance use, gang relat-
ed activities and poverty (Leeper et al., 2019). Furthermore a
study found that 93.1% of adolescents in South Africa had
experienced more than one type of violence including domes-
tic, school, neighborhood and sexual violence (Kaminer et al.,
2013). Multiple childhood traumas experienced amongst
South African adolescents also include bullying, emotional
trauma, sexual abuse, poverty, parental substance abuse and
food insecurity (Boyes et al., 2014; L. Cluver & Orkin, 2009;
Oldewage-Theron et al., 2006). South Africa’s unique history,
characterised by apartheid, a form of constitutional racial seg-
regation and exploitation, and a long period of political vio-
lence and state-sponsored oppression ending only in 1994,
suggests a high level of trauma exposure in the general popu-
lation (Atwoli et al., 2013). In the context of a country in the
midst of change, violence in South Africa, and the physical
and psychological injuries that can result, is one of the three
growing public health crises (along with HIV, tuberculosis
and maternal, neonatal, and child health) that have made
health care and prevention so challenging (Mayosi et al.,
2012; Wyatt et al., 2017).

Adolescents with perinatal HIV infection (PHIV) may ex-
perience unique traumas such as stigmatization due to their
illness, orphanhood, early hospitalisation, missed school and
social opportunities associated with living with a chronic con-
dition (Claude A. Mellins & Malee, 2013). AIDS-orphaned
children also have higher rates of depression and PTSD than
children orphaned due to other causes (L. D. Cluver et al.,
2012; Kumar et al., 2014; Claude A. Mellins & Malee,
2013). Stigmatization in PHIV adolescents is characterised
by negative attitudes and beliefs towards their condition by
themselves and others and often results in poor access to care
and adherence to treatment (MacQuarrie et al., 2009). Stigma
in PHIV adolescents has also been associated with anxiety and
depression (Akena et al., 2012; Boyes & Cluver, 2015; Casale
et al., 2019). Notably, the availability and affordability of
healthcare remains a challenge for PHIV adolescents in

South Africa and therefore may also impact on their mental
health (Doyle et al., 2019; Mokomane et al., 2017). Moreover,
many PHIV adolescents have lost their parents and are left as
the head of the household and are therefore more likely to
experience trauma (Mogotlane et al., 2010). A previous study
conducted on this cohort when they were 9–12 years old,
found higher rates of mental disorders in PHIV children com-
pared to healthy controls (Hoare et al., 2019). Both PHIV
children and controls were recruited from communities with
the same level of economic standing, settlement type and
quality of education. Few studies have reported on the asso-
ciation between childhood trauma and mental health in ado-
lescents living in South Africa.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of
childhood trauma, stressful life events and HIV stigma with
mental health in South African adolescents from the
Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC)
(Hoare et al., 2019). First, we hypothesised that South
African adolescents in CTAAC may experience trauma, neg-
ative lifetime events and HIV stigma. Second, we
hypothesised that childhood trauma, negative lifetime events
and stigma would be associated with mental health outcomes
in South African adolescents in CTAAC.

Methods

Participants

A total of 122 PHIV adolescents and 36 healthy controls were
recruited to the neuropsychiatric sub-study of the Cape Town
Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort study (CTAAC) (Hoare
et al., 2018). PHIV adolescents were sampled consecutively
and were not recruited based on disease complexity or viro-
logical suppression/unsuppression. Controls were HIV nega-
tive and frequency matched for age and sex; controls selected
had similar characteristics in regard to ethnicity, home lan-
guage, years of education, quality of education and annual
household income. Controls and PHIV adolescents underwent
rapid HIV testing, which included pre- and post-test counsel-
ling, prior to enrolment to confirm HIV status. Exclusion
criteria for both PHIV adolescents and controls were an un-
controlled medical condition, an identified central nervous
system condition, a history of head injury, a history of perina-
tal complications or neurodevelopment disorder not attributed
to HIV (Hoare et al., 2018). The Childhood trauma question-
naire was completed by 99 PHIV adolescents and 36 controls
at the 36 month follow-up visit. Participants were between the
ages of 12–15 years and were seen in the Department of
Psychiatry and Pediatrics at the University of Cape Town,
South Africa (Hoare et al., 2018). Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics
Committee at the University of Cape Town’s Faculty of

Health Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa. Parental consent
and adolescent assent was obtained from all participants in
this study in the participants home language.

Descriptive Measures

Age, sex, years of education, percentage of participants with
low household income and age of initiation of antiretroviral
therapy (ART), were obtained from medical records and in-
terviews with adolescent/caregiver dyads. CD4+ count and
viral load were obtained by blood draw.

Trauma, Negative Life Events and Stigma Measures

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form was used to
assess retrospective childhood trauma. It is a 28-item self-re-
port 5-point Likert scale that provides valid screening for his-
tory of abuse and neglect experienced during childhood and
adolesence. It measures five types of maltreatment: physical,
emotional and sexual abuse as well as physical and emotional
neglect. Scores range from 25 to 125, with higher scores
representing more severe exposure to trauma (D. P.
Bernstein et al., 2003). Due to the retrospective nature of
CTQ, there is a chance for minimization/denial of the extent
of childhood trauma experienced. The minimization/denial
scale comprises three items that are dichotomized and
summed. Any score above 0 indicates minimization. If partic-
ipants scored 1–3 on the scale, it suggests possible
underreporting of childhood trauma. A score of 0 corresponds
to no minimization, 1 to low minimization, 2 to intermediate
minimization and 3 to high minimization (D. Bernstein &
Fink, 1998).

The Life Events Questionnaire measures 70 specific life
events. This includes traumatic events as well as environmen-
tal stressors. The responses are dichotomous and are tallied for
a total score out of 70 (Masten et al., 1994).

Stigma was measured with the HIV Stigma Scale for South
African Adolescents Living with HIV (Pantelic et al., 2018).
This inventory consists of 10 items which measure the three
HIV stigma mechanisms experienced by adolescents living
with HIV, namely enacted, anticipated and internalized stig-
ma. Participants are asked to rate each statement about their
HIV status on a 3-point Likert scale.

Mental Health Measures

The Beck-Youth Inventories is a self-report scale, completed
by the adolescents themselves, and was used to assess an
adolescents’ experience of depression, anxiety, anger, disrup-
tive behaviour and self-concept (Deighton et al., 2014). The
caregivers of the adolescents reported on the following scales:
The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess adolescent
behavioural and emotional problems and psychopathology

(Verhulst, 1989). The Columbia Impairment Scale was used
to assess functional impairement in adolescents (Attell et al.,
2020). The Childrens Motivation Scale was used to measure
adolescents motivation levels or tendency toward apathy
(Gerring et al., 1996). The Conners Scale for Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder assessed adolescents ADHD
levels (Izzo et al., 2019). Self-reporting of alcohol use and
urine toxicology for ilicit substances were also included.

All questionaires were administered by trained study staff
who have extensive experience working with PHIV adoles-
cent. Questionnaires were conducted in private rooms in the
participants home language or language of preference and
were forward and back translated by an independent language
expert. In addition, all questionairres have been proved reli-
able for use in isi-Xhosa speaking adolescents in South Africa
(Joska et al., 2011)(Hoare et al., 2016).

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all demographic and
clinical variables. T-tests were used for continuous variables
and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Pearson’s corre-
lations were used to test associations between trauma subtypes
on the CTQ, total LEQ, and total stigma with BECK-Youth
inventories, CBCL, CIS, CMS and Conners Scale. Spearman
rank correlations were used to associate self-reports of alcohol
use and urine toxicology, as well as HIV status with the CTQ
subtypes, total LEQ and total stigma. Benjamini Hochberg
FDR correction for p < 0.05 was used to correct for multiple
comparisons throughout.

Results

Demographic and Clinical Attributes of PHIV
Adolescents and Healthy Controls (Table 1)

The mean age for PHIV adolescents was 13.5 years, with 45
males and 54 females. For healthy controls the mean age was
13.8, with 18 males and 18 females. Low household income
was reported for 74 PHIV adolescents and 28 controls.
Twenty-five PHIV adolescents self-reported alcohol use,
which was significantly different to controls who reported
no alcohol use. The urine toxicology screens were positive
in 1 PHIV adolescent for mandrax and 2 for cannabis, as well
as testing positive on cannabis for 1 control. All demographic
measures were well matched between PHIV adolescents and
controls apart from alcohol use. For PHIV adolescents, mean
age of ART initiation was 3.4 years with a median duration of
9.82 years. Viral load was detectable for 45 PHIV adolescents
with a viral load median of 49 and CD4 count median of 687.

Association of CTQ, LEQ and Stigma Scores with Beck-
Youth Inventories in Adolescents (Table 2)

There were significant associations of CTQ emotional abuse
with Beck-Y Inventories. CTQ emotional neglect was also
significantly associated with Beck-Y Inventories. LEQ total
score was significantly associated with Beck-Y HIV stigma
was significantly associated with Beck-Y inventories includ-
ing depression, anger and disruptive behaviour. There was no
significant association between CTQ measures, LEQ or HIV
stigma with the CBCL scores, CIS, CMS, HIV status, urine
toxicology and alcohol use.

Discussion

This study explored levels of childhood trauma, stressful life
events and HIV stigma and their associations with mental

health outcomes in an adolescent cohort in South Africa.
First, we found that 63.7% of South African adolescents in
this study experienced at least one type of childhood trauma,
with emotional neglect being the most prevalent. Second, we
found that there was an association of childhood trauma, as
measured by the CTQ, with Beck-Y inventories. Stressful life
events, as measured by the LEQ, were associated with Beck-Y
inventories. Lastly, HIV stigma was associated with Beck-Y
inventories.

Previous studies of childhood trauma in healthy South
African adolescents have reported similar CTQ scores, with
emotional neglect also being the most prevalent form of trau-
ma (Martin et al., 2014, 2019; Nöthling et al., 2019). A review
by Meinck et al. reported high rates of childhood trauma in
studies conducted in numerous African countries including
South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and
Mauritania, with the highest prevalence being 64% in Egypt
(Meinck et al., 2015). The majority of these studies assessed

physical and sexual abuse with prevalence rates ranging from
7.6% – 45% and 1.6% – 77.7% respectively (Meinck et al.,
2015). Although we found notably high rates of trauma in our
sample, there were many children who reported none to min-
imal trauma; this may in part be due to 70.4% of the cohort
minimizing their experience of trauma. Moreover, the level or
experience of trauma may not have been as significant as
presumed; in that each individual may have experienced their
level of impact of trauma subjectively, which cannot be mea-
sured statistically as a given specific level. PHIV adolescents
are more likely to have access to counselors, caregivers and
medical staff due to their chronic illness. This social/medical
support in turn has been shown to contribute to their charac-
teristics of resilience and ability to cope (Bhana et al., 2016;
Kuo et al., 2019; Petersen et al., 2010), which ultimately may
mitigate their experience or exposure to childhood trauma.
Supporting studies found reduced mental health symptoms
in adolescents who experienced emotional warmth in their
parent-child relationship and school connectedness
(de Moraes et al., 2018; Sharp et al., 2018). However, HIV
stigma, a common experience for young people living with
HIV, can be considered traumatic and has been associated
with mental health outcomes (Boyes et al., 2019).

Worryingly, adolescents tend to have experienced more
traumas by later adolescence (Finkelhor et al., 2005, 2007).
Studies conducted on female youth indicate that they are more
likely to experience sexual trauma between the ages of 16 and
25 (Hirschowitz, Ros; Worku, Seble; Orkin, 2000). In South
Africa where disadvantaged households are frequently patri-
archal (Morrell et al., 2012), this dynamic increases the risk of
gender based violence (Jewkes et al., 2006). Given the young
age of our cohort compared to other studies (Martin et al.,
2014, 2019; Nöthling et al., 2019) it may be that they have
not yet experienced extremely high levels of exposure to trau-
ma. This is concerning especially since adults living with HIV
have reported high rates of childhood trauma (Bekele et al.,
2018; LeGrand et al., 2015), emphasizing the need for longi-
tudinal work. Furthermore, it is important to note that re-
sponses to the CTQ may have been influenced by cultural as
well as adolescent expectation within their own society at a
micro level. For example, studies have found that female ad-
olescents struggle to seek help after experiencing sexual as-
sault (Smith et al., 2010), this may prevent disclosure of these
incidences as trauma. Males are also often expected to take on
an authoritative role if there is no father present, which is often
the case in homes of PHIV adolescents (Bray & Dawes,
2016), this may not be experienced as trauma. Moreover,
studies have reported childhood trauma and mental health
resilience in South African adolescents (Collishaw et al.,
2016; MacEdo et al., 2018; Phasha, 2010).

It is important to note that the minimization scores calculat-
ed for the CTQ show that 70.4% of adolescents in this study
reported some degree of minimization. In addition, of the

adolescents who reported high minimization, 80.8% reported
in the none-minimal trauma category indicating that these ad-
olescents are most likely under-reporting their experience of
trauma. It is important to note that under-reporting is a greater
risk than over-reporting (Maughan & Rutter, 1997). A study
using a large multi-national sample also found that minimiza-
tion is not rare and that prior analysis of maltreatment preva-
lence and its effects that have used the CTQ may have
underestimated its incidence and impact (MacDonald et al.,
2016).

Here we report on significant associations between child-
hood trauma, negative life events and stigma with mental
health outcomes. Emotional abuse and emotional neglect were
positively associated with all Beck-Y Inventories including
depression, anxiety, disruptive behaviour, anger and self-con-
cept. Supporting this, a review by Mills et al (Mills et al.,
2013), found adolescents exposed to childhood maltreatment,
particularly emotional abuse and neglect, reported higher
levels of both internalizing and externalizing behaviour.
Additionally, another review by Norman et al (Norman
et al., 2012), also found an association between emotional
abuse and neglect with depression in adolescents.
Furthermore, studies have found that psychological maltreat-
ment and physical abuse in childhood resulted in an increased
risk of low self-esteem and self-concept in adolescence in
Tanzania and India respectively (Devi et al., 2013;
Mwakanyamale & Yizhen, 2019). LEQ scores were associat-
ed with all Beck-Y inventories apart from the self-concept
inventory. Only a few studies have investigated the associa-
tion of LEQ scores with mental health outcomes in adoles-
cents (Sun et al., 2017). HIV stigma was associated with
Beck-Y inventories including depression, anger and disrup-
tive behaviour. This supports previous studies conducted in
South African adolescents, which report on the association
between stigma and depression (Boyes & Cluver, 2015;
Casale et al., 2019).

We did not find any associations of CTQ measures, LEQ
scores and stigma with CBCL scores, Columbia Impairment
Scale, Childrens Motivation Scale, HIV status, urine toxicol-
ogy or alcohol use. No association between childhood trauma
and alcohol use was unexpected. A previous study conducted
in this cohort on a larger number of participants found that 1 in
10 adolescents reported having used alcohol, although the use
of tobacco and other drugs were low (Brittain et al., 2019).
Notably, other risk taking behaviours reported in this study
included sexual activity, bullying others and suicidality; more-
over, all risk taking behaviour in PHIV adolescents was asso-
ciated with poor adherence to ART (Brittain et al., 2019).
Notably, another study conducted in South African adoles-
cents reported an association between childhood abuse mea-
sured by the CTQ and greater alcohol and drug problems
(Hogarth et al., 2019). Moreover, alcohol use has also been
associated with mental health disorders in PHIV adolescents

360

Journ Child Adol Trauma (2022) 15:353–363

(Claude Ann Mellins et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2010). It is
likely that the reason we did not find any associations between
childhood trauma and alcohol use as well as toxicology re-
ports is that there were fewer reported cases in this study
cohort compared to other studies in adolescents, as well as
the small sample size included in this study.

Although we did not measure what mediates the association
between childhood trauma and mental health, previous studies
have suggested that childhood trauma resulting in mental health
symptoms might be due to increased stress sensitivity or emo-
tion dysregulation (Peh et al., 2017; Rauschenberg et al., 2017).
Additionally the role of the HPA axis has been implicated in the
association of childhood trauma with behavioural issues in ad-
olescents in previous studies (Kuhlman et al., 2018). Numerous
factors other than childhood trauma may contribute to the de-
velopment of mental health symptoms in South African adoles-
cents (Woollett et al., 2017). The causal relationship between
childhood trauma and mental health symptoms is complex and
requires further investigation.

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, as the
study is cross-sectional we are not able to make inferences
about what mediates the association between childhood trau-
ma and mental health. Second, the majority of childhood trau-
ma measures were derived from self-report data, this may
have been subject to under or over reporting of events and
symptoms (Demetriou et al., 2015). Third, due to the CTQ
and LEQ being retrospective measures of childhood trauma
and negative life events, responses may have been subject to
recall bias (Frissa et al., 2016). Notably, the CTQ is a restric-
tive measure of childhood trauma in that it does not measure
the impact of trauma. In addition, the CTQ may be impacted
by minimization. The scale is only rated on 5 dimensions,
which potentially do not provide enough granularity when
investigating CTQ minimization. Moreover, responses for
the LEQ are dichotomous and therefore also fail to identify
the severity of trauma experienced during or after the event.
Fourth, the sample size for healthy controls was significantly
smaller than PHIV adolescents. Furthermore, the healthy con-
trols were recruited from Masiphumelele (Freedom House,
2017), a region where adolescents are exposed to particularly
high levels of trauma that encompass high rates of poverty and
crime (SAHO, 2019). Lastly, the minimization scores for
CTQ indicate that the majority of adolescents in this study
are likely under-reporting their experience of trauma.

Despite its limitations, the strengths of this study and its nov-
elty lie in the uniqueness of this cohort. In South Africa, no
previous study has investigated the association of trauma with
mental health symptoms in adolescents, including PHIV adoles-
cents. The historical background of South Africas apartheid re-
gime provides a unique context that underlies trauma in South
African youth to this day (Adonis, 2016). As the majority of
current studies have been conducted in higher income countries,
there is value in including data from limited resource regions

where little is published. In addition, HIV is a significant trauma
that is seen across the globe but more so in South Africa.
Children and adolescents are a relatively understudied popula-
tion, and this is an important emerging research area in South
Africa. While many structural factors have been studied, mental
health problems that are prevalent in South Africa have received
less attention. In conditions of extreme poverty and instability,
characteristic of much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the pressures on
parents differ markedly from those faced by parents in higher
income communities that are typically the focus of research in
adolescent mental health (Wyatt et al., 2017). The majority of the
adolescents included in this cohort are living with HIV, which as
mentioned is in itself is a traumatic experience. As well as living
with HIV, South African adolescents experience concerningly
high levels of gender based violence (GBV) and intimate partner
violence (IPV). A meta-analysis indicated an estimated 28% of
adolescent and 29% of young adult women reported lifetime
physical or sexual IPV, which was found to be most prevalent
in the East and Southern African region (Decker et al., 2015).
Another study found an association between lower socio-
economic status, childhood trauma and increased likelihood of
having gender inequitable masculinity (Jewkes et al., 2016).
Furthermore, a study found a 30.9% prevalence of IPV experi-
enced by girls in grade 8 in South Africa (Shamu et al., 2016).
Moreover, the age range of early adolescence in this study is
important as most studies that investigate this association inves-
tigate mental health outcomes in much older adolescent cohorts.
The CTQ has been validated in South Africa and amongst
adolescents (Charak et al., 2017; Spies et al., 2019), making it a
reliable tool in investigating childhood trauma exposure.
However, future studies would benefit from using additional
measures such as GBV and IPV, which have been shown to be
particularly concerning in South African adolescents (Jewkes
et al., 2006, 2016; Shamu et al., 2016). Further investigation into
the association between childhood trauma and alcohol and sub-
stance use in this cohort is also needed, as a number of studies in
South Africa and internationally have found a significant corre-
lation between these two factors, which in turn has been shown
to impact mental health symptoms (Barahmand et al., 2016;
Benjet et al., 2013; Oshri et al., 2012; Park et al., 2019).
Moreover, future studies would benefit by using tools measuring
more detailed experiences of childhood trauma, such as the
Adverse Child Experience International Questionnaire (ACE-
IQ) developed by the World Health Organisation, which was
adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and Kaiser Permanente’s ACE study in America (Felitti et al.,
1998; WHO, 2018), in order do obtain a more accurate represen-
tation of the meaning of trauma for the individual. The ACE-IQ
is also able to draw correlations between negative adolescent
outcomes and has been validated recently in adolescents
(Kidman et al., 2019). In addition it has been used previously
in South African PHIV adolescents (Kidman et al., 2018).

Therapeutics (NMT) developed by Dr. Perry is another useful
tool to consider in future studies (Hambrick, Brawner, & Perry,
2019a). The NMT allows clinicians to catalogue the child’s de-
velopmental history and current functioning, giving more infor-
mation into the timing of developmental experiences and how
this impacts current functioning in key brain-mediated domains
(Hambrick, Brawner, & Perry, 2019a; Hambrick, Brawner,
Perry, et al., 2019b). Despite the difficulties in disclosing trauma
by many children, the study staff made effort to address this by
only administering the CTQ at the end of the day in order to build
trust between the adolescents and the study staff before asking
difficult questions. Lastly, future studies would benefit from a
larger healthy control sample size and for controls to be recruited
from the same areas as PHIV adolescents.

Conclusion

Overall, the findings in this study indicate that 63.7% of ado-
lescents in South Africa have experienced at least one trauma
before the age of 14. Childhood trauma, negative life events
and stigma were associated with numerous mental health out-
comes including depression, anxiety, disruptive behaviour,
anger and poor self-concept. This study provides a foundation
for future longitudinal research to assess childhood trauma
and its association with mental health disorders in South
African adolescents as they age. This study highlights the
importance of understanding the emotive outcome and impact
of trauma exposure in adolescents living in South Africa.
