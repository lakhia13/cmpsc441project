Abstract
Objective: Understanding differences in outpatient care before and after mental health hospitalization for adolescents from
diverse backgrounds is critical to ensuring effective and responsive care. The objective of the current study was to examine
outpatient mental health care in the two years before and 30 days after a mental health hospitalization for adolescents from
immigrant, refugee and non-immigrant backgrounds.
Method: This retrospective, population-based cohort study, conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada, analyzed linked
health service utilization data (practitioner billings, hospitalizations) and migration records to track outpatient care before
and after mental health hospitalization. The study included adolescents (ages 10–18) with an unscheduled/urgent mental health
hospitalization between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016 (n = 5,314) from a cohort of adolescents in 10 of the largest
school districts in BC (between 1996 and 2016). The main analyses examined outpatient mental health visits (e.g., general
practitioner/psychiatrist) (i) in the two years before hospitalization and (ii) in the 30 days after discharge. Sub-analyses focused
on outpatient visits with psychiatrists.

Results: Overall, 30.4% had no outpatient mental health visit in the two years before hospitalization and 45.1% had none in
the 30 days following discharge. First-generation immigrants and refugees and second-generation immigrant adolescents were
signiﬁcantly less likely than non-immigrants to have had an outpatient mental health visit in the two years before mental health
hospitalization (aOR1st_gen_immg = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.98; aOR2nd_gen_immg = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93; aOR1st_gen_ref =
0.40, 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.64). Second-generation immigrant adolescents were signiﬁcantly more likely than non-immigrants
to have had any outpatient mental health visit in the 30 days following hospitalization (aOR2nd_gen_immg = 1.34, 95% CI,
1.09 to 1.65).

Mental health-related care from a doctor/psychiatrist before and after mental health hospitalization for adolescents from
immigrant, refugee, and non-immigrant backgrounds in British Columbia

Plain Language Summary
The objective of this study was to examine differences in mental health-related visits to a doctor or a psychiatrist before and
after mental health hospitalizations for adolescents from diverse backgrounds in British Columbia, Canada.

Using health insurance and hospital records, the study followed 5,314 adolescents (aged 10-18) who had a mental health-
related hospitalization between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2016. For this group of adolescents, the study then
tracked whether or not they had received care (i.e., from a doctor or psychiatrist related to their mental health) in the 2
years before their hospitalization and also in the 30 days after their hospitalization.

The study found that 30.4% of those hospitalized for a mental health concern had no mental health visit with a doctor/psychi-
atrist in the two years before hospitalization and 45.1% had no visits in the 30 days following discharge. A main ﬁnding of the study
was that newcomers to Canada (immigrants and refugees born outside of Canada) were less likely to have visited a doctor/psy-
chiatrist for a mental health-related reason in the 2 years before their hospitalization than their non-immigrant peers.

Results suggest outpatient care before and after mental health hospitalizations is limited for many adolescents in BC and differed

by migration background. Implications for meeting standards of care are discussed.

Résumé
Objectif : Il est essentiel de comprendre les différences touchant les soins en consultation externe avant et après une hos-
pitalisation en santé mentale pour les adolescents issus de divers milieux aﬁn d’assurer des soins efﬁcaces et adaptés. L’objectif
de la présente étude était d’examiner les soins de santé de mentale en consultation externe dans les deux années précédant et
les 30 jours suivant l’hospitalisation d’adolescents issus ou non de l’immigration ou réfugiés.
Méthode : Cette étude de cohorte rétrospective au niveau de la population, menée en Colombie-Britannique (C.-B.), au
Canada, a permis d’analyser les données liées aux recours aux services de santé (facturation des praticiens, hospitalisations)
et les dossiers de migration aﬁn de faire un suivi des soins en consultation externe avant et après une hospitalisation en santé
mentale. L’étude portait sur des adolescents (âgés de 10 à 18 ans) hospitalisés de façon imprévue ou urgente pour des
problèmes de santé mentale entre le 1er janvier 2008 et le 31 décembre 2016 (n = 5 314) issus d’une cohorte d’adolescents
provenant de 10 des plus grands districts scolaires de la Colombie-Britannique (entre 1996 et 2016). Les principales analyses
ont porté sur les consultations externes en santé mentale (p. ex., omnipraticien/psychiatre), (i) dans les deux années
précédant l’hospitalisation et (ii) dans les 30 jours suivant le congé de l’hôpital. Les sous-analyses ont porté sur les consulta-
tions externes avec des psychiatres.
Résultats : Dans l’ensemble, 30.4% de ces adolescents n’avaient pas obtenu de soins de santé mentale en consultation
externe au cours des deux années précédant leur hospitalisation et 45.1% n’en avaient pas eu dans les 30 jours suivant
leur congé de l’hôpital. Les immigrants de première génération et les réfugiés, ainsi que les adolescents immigrants de
deuxième génération étaient beaucoup moins susceptibles que les non-immigrants d’avoir obtenu des soins de santé de men-
tale en consultation externe au cours des deux années précédant leur hospitalisation pour des raisons de santé mentale (rap-
port de cotes ajusté1re_gén_immg = 0.79, IC à 95%, de 0.63 à 0.98; rapport de cotes ajusté2e_gén_immg = 0.75, IC à 95%, de 0.61 à
0.93; rapport de cotes ajusté1re_gén_réf = 0.40, IC à 95%, de 0.26 à 0.64). Les adolescents immigrants de deuxième génération
étaient beaucoup plus susceptibles que les non-immigrants d’avoir consulté en ambulatoire un professionnel en santé mentale
au cours des 30 jours suivant leur hospitalisation (rapport de cotes ajusté2e_gén_immg = 1.34, IC à 95%, de 1.09 à 1.65).
Conclusions : Les résultats semblent indiquer que les soins en consultation externe avant et après des hospitalisations en
santé mentale sont limités pour de nombreux adolescents en Colombie-Britannique et varient selon leurs antécédents en
matière d’immigration. Les implications en matière de respect des normes de soins sont abordées.

Mental disorders have profound consequences for the health, and
social and economic well-being of young people—and for the
societies in which they live.1,2 Recent global prevalence

estimates suggest that 1 in 10 children and youth (5–24 years
of age) have a diagnosable mental disorder—representing one-
ﬁfth of all cause disease-related disability.3 The majority of

Gadermann et al

mental disorders (75%) have their onset before the age of 25
(50% before age 144). The importance of child and youth
mental health, and optimization of care, is increasingly recog-
nized as a priority in Canada and globally.1,2,4 Yet, inadequate
or delayed access to mental health care for young people
remains an on-going concern,1,5–7 especially for adolescents
from immigrant and refugee backgrounds.6,7

Clinical guidelines recommend that treatment of mental dis-
orders is primarily delivered on an outpatient basis, coupled
with supports within the family, school and community, and
in-patient care is reserved for treating acute symptoms requiring
emergency stabilization and monitoring.8,9 However, evidence
suggests a reliance on in-patient, acute mental health services
such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations for the treat-
ment and care of mental disorders.10 Indeed, higher levels of
outpatient care have been associated with decreased rates of
hospitalizations among youth.11 The provision of
timely
follow-up care after child and youth psychiatric hospitalizations
has been associated with better treatment outcomes.12–14

Despite the importance of outpatient care before and after
hospitalization, there is limited knowledge on variations in out-
patient care for different sub-populations of adolescents who are
hospitalized with a mental disorder.11,14,15 Children and youth
from immigrant and refugee backgrounds may be particularly
at risk of not receiving appropriate outpatient care leading up
to and following mental health hospitalizations. Immigrant
and refugee children and youth have been found to be less
likely to access outpatient mental health services16,17 but more
likely to utilize the emergency department as a ﬁrst point of
contact
for mental health care than their non-immigrant
peers.18,19 Understanding differences in outpatient care before
and after mental health hospitalization for adolescents is critical
to ensuring mental health care is effective and responsive to the
needs of the diverse sub-populations of young people.

The Study Objective

The aim of the study was to examine differences in outpatient
mental health care before and after a mental health hospital-
ization for adolescents from immigrant, refugee and non-
immigrant backgrounds in British Columbia, Canada, using
common mental health service performance metrics.20
Focusing on individuals’ ﬁrst hospitalization episodes
within the study period (and excluding those with a hospital-
ization in the two years before study inception), this study
examined the likelihood of:

(i) any outpatient mental health visit in the two years before
a mental health hospitalization (sub-analysis: any outpa-
tient visits with a psychiatrist in the two years before a
mental health hospitalization),

(ii) any outpatient mental health visit in the 30 days after discharge
from hospital (sub-analysis: any outpatient visits with a psychi-
atrist in the 30 days after discharge from hospital).

Method

Study Design and Setting

We used population-based linked administrative data on hos-
pitalizations and outpatient services in British Columbia
(BC), Canada, to conduct a retrospective cohort study of out-
patient mental health care in the two years before and 30 days
after adolescent mental health hospitalizations. In BC, there
are approximately 93 child and youth mental health intake
clinics across the province and 7 main hospitals equipped
with inpatient child and youth mental health services, servic-
ing different areas of the province. In smaller communities, it
is possible that children and youth with mental health concerns
may be temporarily admitted to general paediatric beds or to
adult psychiatric units until a transfer to a dedicated child and
youth mental health inpatient unit is completed. Approval for
this project was granted by the University of British
Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board. The reporting
of this study is in keeping with the REporting of studies
Conducted using Observational Routinely collected Data
(RECORD) guidelines.21

Data Sources

Health services data were requested from the BC Ministry of
Health (including Medical Services Plan (MSP) Registration &
Premium Billing (R&PB)22 and Discharge Abstract Database
(DAD) data23). Enrolment
in the BC provincial universal
health plan is required for virtually all residents.24 Migration
records were requested from Immigration Refugees and
Citizenship Canada (IRCC; Permanent Resident Database25).
Data sources were linked by Population Data BC using a
probabilistic-deterministic approach24 (linkage rate: 98.4%).

Study Population

The study was based on an approved cohort of adolescents
who attended school in the 10 largest districts in BC at
some point between 1996 and 2016, which was identiﬁed
using data from the BC Ministry of Education and Child
Care and BC Ministry of Health. All school districts are
located in South-Western BC where the majority of the pop-
ulation resides.26 As outlined in Figure 1, we included ado-
lescents (age 10 to 18) who had an unscheduled (i.e.,
urgent rather than elective/scheduled admission, as coded
on the hospital
record) mental health hospitalization
between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016. Mental
health hospitalizations were identiﬁed through hospital dis-
charge records with a primary discharge diagnosis indicating
an International Classiﬁcation of Diseases [ICD] 10th Edition
(ICD-10-CA) diagnostic code F04 to F99 or a secondary
diagnosis indicating an ICD-10-CA code X60 to X84 (for
previous use of this coding criteria, see18). Following all
exclusions (see Figure 1), this resulted in a cohort of 5,314

transfers to long-term care facilities, palliative/hospice),
resulting in a cohort of 5,162 (see Figure 1). In some cases
(9.9%), hospitalization episodes resulted in readmission
within 30 days. No signiﬁcant differences in readmissions
within 30 days were found based upon migration background
(X2 (4, N = 5,162), P = .882) and follow-up sensitivity anal-
ysis revealed no substantive changes in results when readmis-
sion records were retained or removed (records were retained
for the ﬁnal analysis).

Dependent Variables

We analyzed four dependent variables: In the two years before
hospitalization, we assessed whether individuals had (i) any
outpatient mental health visit, or (ii) an outpatient psychiatrist
visit. In the 30 days after hospital discharge, we examined
whether individuals had (iii) any outpatient mental health
visit, or (iv) an outpatient psychiatrist visit. The 2-year-before
and 30-day-after hospitalization time periods are in line with
youth mental health service performance indicators established
in a Canadian context.20 Outpatient mental health visits were
identiﬁed using billing records covered under the provincial
health insurance plan (MSP). Outpatient visits were predomi-
nantly physician-based: general practitioners (46.8%), psychi-
atrists (40.1%), paediatricians (10.6%), neurologists (0.10%)
and 2.4% of visits were billed by other types of practitioners
(e.g., nurse practitioners). Mental health visits were deﬁned
as those for which the primary diagnosis (“most responsible”
diagnosis for the visit) was a mental disorder (ICD-9: 290-314)
or the practitioner was a psychiatrist. Visits billed over the
course of the hospitalization (including on the day of hospital
admission/discharge) or by practitioners in hospital (with
Emergency Department or inpatient service locations) were
not counted as outpatient visits.

Independent Variables
Migration background was identiﬁed through IRCC’s Permanent
Resident Database.25 First-generation immigrant and refugee
(i.e., foreign-born) children were identiﬁed by their own IRCC
migration record. Second-generation immigrant and refugee chil-
dren (i.e., children born in Canada to at least one immigrant or
refugee parent) were identiﬁed based upon parental IRCC migra-
tion records. All other children were categorized as part of the
non-migrant group (the reference group; ref).

Information on sex at birth (ref: female, male), neighbour-
hood income quintile (ref: 1, lowest, to 5), and age at hospi-
talization (ref: 10–12, 13–15, 16–18) was identiﬁed through
the Consolidation File, which is based upon yearly provincial
health registry plan data (MSP Registration & Premium
Billing22).

Year of hospitalization, hospital length of stay and main dis-
charge diagnosis associated with the hospitalization episode
were derived from the DAD (via the BC Ministry of Health).23
Year of hospitalization was grouped into three categories (ref:

Figure 1. Flow chart of study cohort creation.
aScheduled admissions were excluded because they already imply a
level of outpatient care and are therefore not the interest of the
present study. bIn cases where individuals had multiple records of
hospitalization on overlapping/matching dates (i.e., continuous
episodes of hospitalization), we retained the ﬁnal discharge
diagnosis and discharge date for each episode. In the case of
multiple hospitalizations that were not part of a continuous
episode, an individual’s ﬁrst hospitalization record during the study
period was included for analysis. cWe excluded individuals who
were not registered with BC’s universal MSP health insurance
program for ≥ 275 days (a common criterion to indicate residence
in BC27–29) in the year of their index hospitalization and in the two
years prior. Although overall proportions excluded were small, as
expected, the ﬁrst-generation immigrant and refugee groups were
disproportionately excluded based on this presence in BC
requirement (89% and 85% meeting criterion, respectively, in
comparison to 91% of non-immigrants; second-generation
immigrants and refugees were most likely to meet criterion; 97%
and 96% respectively). dStudy inception was 2008. eThose with
missing neighbourhood income data were excluded (no other study
variable had missing data).

for analyses related to outpatient care in the two years before
hospitalization. For the analyses predicting outpatient mental
health care in the 30 days following hospitalization, we
excluded hospitalizations that culminated in death at dis-
transfers with undetermined end dates (e.g.,

aAll categorizations utilize primary diagnostic codes except for the residual

mental disorder categories. The remaining 56% that do not have a mental
disorder as a primary diagnosis are captured under the residual self-harm
category. Of those cases, 95% had a primary diagnosis of poisoning or injury
from external cause.
bNote that codes for self-harm of undetermined intent were excluded from
our deﬁnition of self-harm (otherwise, the residual self-harm codes are in
line with categorizations developed by the Mental Health and Addictions
Scorecard and Evaluation Framework research team in Ontario18).

outcomes within each category. Length of stay was categorized
into quartiles (ref: 0 to 1 days, 2 to 3 days, 4 to 10 days, and
more than 10 days). ICD-10-CA diagnostic codes associated
with hospitalizations were grouped into seven mental disor-
der categories: mood/affective disorders (reference), acute
stress, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, residual self-
harm, substance-related disorders and other mental disorders.
This diagnostic code categorization was adapted from
Ontario’s Mental Health and Addictions Scorecard and
Evaluation Framework18 (see Table 1 for more information).

(n = 406),

second-generation immigrants

(n =
immigrants
461), ﬁrst-generation refugees (n = 82) and second-generation
refugees (n = 102). Overall, about 70% (69.6%) had at least
one mental health visit in the two years before their hospitaliza-
tion episode, with 52% of these visits speciﬁcally to a psychia-
trist. Following hospital discharge, just over half (54.9%) of the
cohort had a mental health visit within 30 days, and 60% of
those visits were to a psychiatrist. Among those who had a
mental health visit in the 30 days following discharge, 77.4%
had a mental health visit in the two years before admission.
Additionally, 53.8% of those who saw a psychiatrist within 30
days of discharge had a psychiatrist visit in the two years
leading up to hospitalization. Finally, 9.9% of individuals were
readmitted to hospital within 30 days following hospital dis-
charge, with a median time to readmission of 11 days (mean =
12.68 days; range = 1–29 days). Among those readmitted,
85.9% had a primary discharge diagnosis of a mental disorder.

Mental Health Outpatient Care in the Two Years
Before Hospitalization

All results presented here are for the adjusted models
reported in Table 3, unless otherwise noted.

Migration Background. First- and second-generation immi-
grant adolescents and, to a greater degree, ﬁrst-generation
refugee adolescents, were signiﬁcantly less likely than non-
immigrants to have had any mental health visit in the two
years before mental health hospitalization.

Sex. No signiﬁcant sex differences in mental health outpa-
tient care in the two years before hospitalization emerged.

Neighbourhood Income Quintile. Adolescents in the highest
income quintile were more likely to have had any mental
health visit or psychiatrist visit in the two years before hospi-
talization in comparison to those in the lowest
income
quintile.

Age. Compared to younger (10–12) adolescents, older adoles-
cents (13–15, 16–18) were less likely to have had a psychiatrist
visit in the two years before hospitalization. This age pattern
was also observed for any mental health visits in the two
years before hospitalization, although the signiﬁcant associa-
tion did not hold after adjusting for other predictors.

Diagnosis. Compared to adolescents hospitalized for mood/
affective disorders (ref), adolescents hospitalized for acute stress,
psychotic disorders, residual self-harm and substance-related dis-
orders were signiﬁcantly less likely to have had any outpatient
mental health visits in the two years before hospitalization and
(except for psychotic disorders) signiﬁcantly less likely to have
had a psychiatrist visit in the two years prior. Adolescents hospi-
talized for anxiety disorders and “other” mental disorders were

Neighbourhood Income Quintile. Adolescents from the highest
neighbourhood income quintile were signiﬁcantly more
likely to have had a mental health visit and a psychiatrist
visit in the 30 days following hospitalization compared to
those from neighbourhoods with the lowest income quintiles.

Age. Age at hospitalization was not signiﬁcantly associated
with any mental health outpatient or psychiatrist visits in
the 30 days following hospitalization.

Diagnosis. Adolescents hospitalized for acute stress, self-
harm, substance-related and “other” mental disorders were
less likely than those hospitalized for mood/affective disor-
ders to have had any mental health visit or psychiatrist visit
within 30 days of hospitalization. Those hospitalized with a

psychotic disorder were signiﬁcantly more likely than those
hospitalized for a mood/affective disorder to have had any
mental health visit or psychiatrist visit within 30 days follow-
ing hospitalization.

Year. Adolescents hospitalized in later years (2014–2016)
were more likely than those in earlier years (2008–2010) to
have had any mental health visit or psychiatrist visit within
30 days following hospitalization.

Mental Health Contact Two Years Prior. Adolescents who had
had mental health contact in the two years before hospitaliza-
tion were signiﬁcantly more likely to have a mental health
outpatient visit or psychiatrist visit in the 30 days following
hospitalization.

Length of Stay. Finally, those with longer lengths of stay were
signiﬁcantly more likely to have a mental health visit or psy-
chiatrist visit within 30 days of hospitalization.

Discussion

The study found that among adolescents in BC hospitalized
for a mental health condition, nearly one-third (30.4%) did
not have a documented outpatient mental health visit in the
two years preceding hospitalization. This indicates that a
high proportion of adolescents did not receive any physician-
based outpatient mental health care before reaching a level of
severity that necessitated hospitalization—and this was dis-
proportionately so for adolescents from immigrant and
refugee backgrounds. From an early intervention perspective,
these ﬁndings highlight the need for alignment with clinical
guidelines that advocate for the treatment of mental disorders
primarily through outpatient services.

In the 30 days after hospitalization, 45.1% of adolescents
had no documented physician-based outpatient mental health
care (67.1% did not see a psychiatrist). The likelihood of
receiving outpatient care during the follow-up period differed
by diagnosis type. In comparison to mood/affective disor-
ders, adolescents hospitalized for psychotic disorders were
more likely to receive follow-up care, while those hospital-
ized for substance-related disorders, residual self-harm, and
acute stress were less likely to have received outpatient
follow up care within 30 days. The greater likelihood of
follow-up outpatient care in the case of psychotic disorders
may be due to the severity of the disorder and the greater
need for acute medication management. There are also a
number of services and supports available for the manage-
ment of psychotic disorders in the province (e.g., through
the BC Psychosis Program or
the Early Psychosis
Intervention Programs). Understanding the reasons for varia-
tions in outpatient care following hospitalization, and their
impact on treatment outcomes is an important
potential
area for
timely
future research, especially given that
follow-up care has been associated with better treatment out-
comes.12–14 Notably, nearly 1 in 10 (9.9%) adolescents with
a mental health-related hospitalization were readmitted to
hospital within 30 days of discharge. This is an outcome
that warrants further examination from a safety and effective-
ness lens.

We found that ﬁrst-generation refugee and ﬁrst- and
second-generation immigrant youth were less likely than
non-immigrant adolescents to have received outpatient
mental health care in the two years prior to hospitalization.

This pattern suggests that hospitalizations are more likely
to be the ﬁrst point of physician-based mental health
contact for newcomers to Canada, particularly for ﬁrst-
generation refugees. This is consistent with an Ontario
study, which found that emergency department visits were
more likely to be the ﬁrst point of contact for refugees and
recent immigrants.18 High rates of hospitalization as the
ﬁrst mental health contact are potentially indicative of poor
access to outpatient mental health care—and is used as a
mental health system performance indicator.31 Adolescents
from immigrant and refugee backgrounds were over-
represented in the lowest
income quintiles (particularly
those from refugee backgrounds)—further widening treat-
ment disparities before hospitalization between immigrant,
refugee and non-immigrant groups. First-generation refugee
adolescents were the least likely to have received outpatient
mental health care in the two years before their mental
health hospitalization, compared to non-immigrant adoles-
cents. This is particularly notable, as young refugees may
have experienced persecution and trauma, making them vul-
nerable to mental health issues.32

These are concerning patterns given the importance of
having a regular, trusted primary care provider as an entry
point to the health care system. A regular outpatient care
entry point is not only associated with higher patient satisfac-
tion and trust, but with higher overall quality of care and out-
including less reliance on emergency services,
comes,
reduced need for hospitalizations and a greater uptake of pre-
ventative care.33 Access to primary health care is considered
foundational to a well-functioning health care system as it
promotes health and wellbeing and helps prevent diseases,
including mental health conditions, and related hospitaliza-
tions.33 In many cases, hospitalizations and potentially
more acute mental illness, may be preventable if preceded
by appropriate outpatient mental health care.11

The disproportionate lack of outpatient care in the lead-up
to hospitalization for ﬁrst-generation immigrant and refugee
youth underscores a critical health inequity. Several factors
may explain why immigrant and refugee adolescents are
less likely to access outpatient mental health services. A
recent review identiﬁed key barriers faced by immigrant pop-
ulations in Canada, including cultural discrepancies and dis-
comforts (e.g., culturally prominent social stigmas, differing
expectations of healthcare providers), communication chal-
lenges, socio-economic obstacles (e.g., transport, childcare)
and health system structural barriers (e.g., concerns about
invasive technology).34 Yet, access to health care is not
only a function of individual characteristics and abilities
(e.g., one’s ability to perceive need, seek, reach or pay for
services), but also the capacity of the health care system to
respond to the needs of individuals in a way that makes
health care more approachable, acceptable, available, afford-
able and appropriate.35 A promising approach in BC is an
integrated youth health and wellness service model (e.g.,
Foundry36), which incorporates elements that are designed

10

The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry

to reduce barriers to accessing mental health services (e.g.,
integrated services, walk-in and virtual services for youth).
More research is needed to understand whether this approach
is effective at reducing barriers speciﬁcally for adolescents
from immigrant and refugee backgrounds with speciﬁc
social, cultural and linguistic needs.

With respect to outpatient mental health or psychiatrist
care within 30 days following their hospitalization, second-
generation immigrant adolescents were more likely than non-
immigrants to receive care. However, worth noting is the lack
of signiﬁcant differences in outpatient
follow-up care
between youth with other immigrant and refugee backgrounds
and non-immigrant youth after adjusting for other factors.
Altogether, these ﬁndings may indicate that hospitalization
could have served as a connection point to the outpatient
mental health care system for those previously unconnected,
but needs to be explored further in future research.

Limitations

This study has some important limitations. The study only
captures fee-for-service outpatient practitioner visits captured
through BC’s universal health insurance (MSP) program.
This is important to note because adolescents may have
accessed allied, non-physician-based mental health services
not covered by MSP or physician services provided under
alternative payment plans and therefore would not be cap-
tured in the MSP billing data (including mental health ser-
vices offered for newcomers to BC). Recent evidence in a
Canadian context suggests that non-physician based mental
health contacts are common amongst children and adoles-
cents.37 Having the ability to capture non-physician-based
mental health services outside of the MSP program (e.g.,
through private practice, in schools, by social workers, the
provincial Child and Youth Mental Health Teams, or
Foundry—Integrated Youth Services) would provide a
more complete picture of differential access and barriers to
mental health services. Past research suggests that immigrant
and refugee children and youth are less likely than their coun-
terparts to access mental health services in general38,39 but
research that includes diverse forms of mental health care
access would provide a better indication of the different
type of services each group may be accessing. Further to
this, we note that undocumented migrants are not captured
in the present study. Although there are currently no
known accurate estimates of the number of undocumented
migrants in Canada, this is a sub-population that requires
further attention.40

We note that the ﬁndings apply to the speciﬁc study time
period, migration wave and provincial context. The study
time period does not capture the health care system impacts
experienced over the past several years, namely changes in
mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic
and in its aftermath. Overall, child and youth mental health
hospitalizations declined and physician visits went up from

the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic period,41 but it remains
to be seen whether these patterns are consistent for immigrant
and refugee youth and this is an important area for future
research. Note that the study does not capture the most recently
arrived immigrants and refugees. This includes recent refugee
claimants or others who were not yet covered under MSP or
were covered under a federal health insurance program, or
those recent immigrants/refugees who were not in the prov-
ince/country long enough to meet the 2-year presence criterion.
The study captures the BC context only. Given that healthcare is
mainly a provincial jurisdiction, it remains an important ques-
tion as to whether the study ﬁndings would be consistent
across other provinces.

Finally, this study was unable to account for the severity
of mental disorders. Some adolescents may require more out-
patient care before and after hospitalization depending on the
severity of the mental disorder or incident that led to their
hospitalization. Severity/acuity likely inﬂuences the likeli-
hood of receiving outpatient care and this may differ by
migration background, which represent key areas for future
research.

Conclusion

First- and second-generation immigrants and refugees com-
prise a signiﬁcant, and growing, proportion of the Canadian
population.42 As noted by the World Health Organization,
“the ability of the health-care system to deal with growing
linguistic and cultural diversity in equitable and effective
ways are no longer marginal issues” (WHO report, page
833). The ﬁndings of this study enhance our understanding
of the variations in care before and after hospitalization
among adolescents from diverse backgrounds. This knowl-
edge is crucial for identifying those who may not be receiv-
ing the outpatient care they need, informing health services
planning, and addressing disparities in the healthcare
system.14 Future research would beneﬁt from employing
both quantitative and qualitative methods to deepen our
understanding of care dynamics before and after hospital-
ization. Future research should also include a focus on
other under-represented subpopulations, the most recent
migrants and health service use changes during and post-
pandemic to develop a more nuanced understanding of
the intersecting factors inﬂuencing mental health outpa-
tient care and hospitalizations for young people in Canada.
