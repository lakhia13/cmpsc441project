Abstract

This study characterized the rates of rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 
adolescent and young adult males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) using a multi-method approach 
integrating a DSM-based parent interview (Children’s Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes; 
P-ChIPS, Fristad et al., 1998) and a parent rating scale (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL, 
Achenbach, 2001). Thirty-one males with FXS, aged 16-24 years, participated. Forty-two percent 
met DSM-5 criteria for ADHD and 35% exceeded the CBCL cut-offs. Agreement between the two 
classification methods was fair (κ=0.38). Autism symptom severity and nonverbal cognitive ability 
did not predict ADHD diagnoses/symptoms. Results show high rates of ADHD in males with FXS 
during late adolescence and young adulthood, which are not accounted for by impaired nonverbal 
cognitive skills or autism symptom severity. DSM-based ADHD-specific scales are recommended 
over broadband symptom scales to improve accurate identification.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked 
by symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity and executive functioning weaknesses 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed 
behavioral disorder in children, with rates in the general population ranging from 9-11% 
during childhood to about 4% in adulthood (Danielson et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2006). 
Diagnoses of ADHD are nearly three times more common in males than females and are 
associated with a high degree of cooccurrence with other mental, emotional, and behavioral 
disorders (Danielson et al., 2018; Reale et al., 2017). The burden of ADHD is significant 
and there is great value in research aimed at understanding the nature and course of ADHD. 
Adverse outcomes associated with ADHD include higher rates of injury, social difficulties, 
and reduced educational and vocational achievement (Harpin et al., 2016; Hinshaw et al., 
2012; Kuriyan et al., 2013; Loe & Feldman, 2007). For the majority of affected individuals, 
ADHD symptoms persist into adulthood and are associated with psychiatric comorbidity, 
substance abuse, criminal activity, failed relationships and underemployment (Barkley et al., 
2004; Biederman et al., 2010; Margherio et al., 2020; Molina et al., 2018).

Although the precise causal mechanism of ADHD is not clear, the evidence supports a 
strong genetic component (Li et al., 2014; Stergiakouli et al., 2012). Recent discoveries 
have identified clear genetic overlaps of ADHD to both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
and intellectual disability, and thus, investigations into the interface between ADHD, ASD, 
and intellectual disability can advance the field (Faraone et al., 2017; Ghirardi et al., 2018; 
May et al., 2018; Pinto et al., 2016; Stergiakouli et al., 2017). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) 
may represent a useful genetic model in this regard; FXS is a monogenetic disorder that 
is the most common known single-gene cause of ASD and the leading inherited cause 
of intellectual disability (Vissers et al., 2016; Waye & Cheng, 2018). FXS is found in 
about 1:7,000 males and 1:10,000 females (Hunter et al., 2014) and involves a trinucleotide 
repeat expansion on the FMR1 gene. FXS is associated with reduced Fragile X Mental 
Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is involved in typical brain maturation (Siegel et al., 
2017; Zhang et al., 2017). The phenotype of males with FXS is marked by nearly universal 
intellectual disability and about cooccurring ASD observed in approximately 60% of males 
(García-Nonell et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2008; Klusek, Martin, & Losh, 2014).

ADHD is also a common cooccurring condition associated with FXS, with reported rates 
in children with FXS ranging from 35-93%, as reflected in Table 1 (Backes et al., 2000; 
Bailey et al., 2008; Bregman et al., 1988; Freund et al., 1993; Hatton et al., 2002; Sullivan 
et al., 2006; Thurman et al., 2014). Consistent with the profile of ADHD in the general 
community, ADHD in FXS emerges during childhood (Grefer et al., 2016) and is more 
likely to affect males than females (Newman et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2014). Across 
studies, the rates of ADHD symptoms and diagnoses in males with FXS are consistently 
higher than in the general population without FXS and also higher than those with non-
specific intellectual disability or other known genetic syndromes (Baumgardner et al., 1995; 
Reilly et al., 2015). Severity of intellectual impairment does not appear to be associated with 
the presence or severity of ADHD (Newman et al., 2015); however, this has not been studied 
extensively. In studies that have examined the relationship of ASD to ADHD in FXS, 
findings are inconsistent with some reports suggesting that elevated ASD severity is linked

with ADHD features (Sullivan et al., 2006), whereas others suggest that ADHD symptoms 
are similar across individuals with FXS with or without comorbid ASD (Hatton et al., 2002; 
Newman et al., 2015). In a study that included a group of male children with FXS contrasted 
to a chronological age, IQ and ASD-severity matched group with non-syndromic ASD, 
ADHD symptoms were significantly higher in the group with FXS (Thurman et al., 2014). 
Inattention, rather than hyperactivity, appears to be the most prominent feature of ADHD 
in FXS, with one investigation of 63 7-13 year-old children with FXS suggesting that 
32% exhibited a predominately inattentive ADHD presentation (ADHD-I), 7% exhibited a 
hyperactive/impulsive presentation (ADHD-H), and 15% exhibited a combined presentation 
(ADHD-C) (Sullivan et al., 2006). Overall, the evidence supports FXS as a saturated model 
for ADHD risk that integrates elevated risk for ADHD within the context of intellectual 
disability and ASD.

The presence of ADHD in males with FXS is associated with significant impairment 
including reduced prosocial behavior and social functioning (Chromik et al., 2019; Scerif 
et al., 2012) as well as increased family burden (Wheeler et al., 2014). The presence of 
multiple cooccurring conditions within FXS is associated with more significant impairment, 
with intellectual disability, attention problems, hyperactivity, and anxiety constituting the 
most common cluster of comorbid disorders in males with FXS (Bailey et al., 2008). 
Treatment for ADHD in males with FXS primarily involves medication, with stimulant 
medication reported as moderately to highly effective (Berry-Kravis et al., 2012; Hagerman 
et al., 1988; Roberts et al., 2011b), and results of a national survey suggest ~30% of 
people with FXS use stimulants (Laxman et al., 2018). However, evidence suggests that 
the attention and thought problems associated with ADHD do not differ between children 
with FXS taking medication and those not being treated, thereby raising questions about 
medication efficacy (Hatton et al., 2002). Obtaining a better understanding of the targets 
and benefits of medication is important because pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD is a 
common approach in FXS. These efforts also have implications for clinical trials in which 
ADHD-related manifestations of FXS represent common behavioral targets (Berry-Kravis et 
al., 2013; Budimirovic et al., 2017).

Although there is an emerging body of research that provides insights into ADHD in FXS, 
there are a number of limitations of this work. First, several studies used samples that were 
highly heterogeneous including a very broad age range (Gabis et al., 2011; Haessler et al., 
2016), inclusion of participants with the FMR1 premutation (i.e., “carriers” of fragile X) 
together with those having the full mutation (Newman et al., 2015), and failure to account 
for ASD (Frolli et al., 2015; Pegoraro et al., 2014). In addition, the focus of research to 
date has largely been on young children with little work specifically targeting adolescents 
and young adults. It is unclear from prior research whether individuals with FXS continue 
to experience high rates of ADHD symptoms into late adolescence and young adulthood. 
Although some studies suggest a general reduction of symptoms across age (Gabis et al., 
2011; Haessler et al., 2016; Wheeler et al., 2014), other reports suggest that the symptoms of 
ADHD do not abate from early childhood into adolescence (Newman et al., 2015; Thurman 
et al., 2014).

A final limitation of the extant literature is that studies to date have not used the revised 
DSM-5 criteria, and there is a clear over-reliance on broad-based measurement tools that 
detect a wide range of different symptoms and are not specifically targeted at measuring 
ADHD (Bailey et al., 2008; Grefer et al., 2016). Although there is value in broad-based 
measures because they allow for easy detection and screen for a wide variety of disorders, 
they often lack specificity for individuals who have comorbid disabilities such as ASD 
(Pandolfi et al., 2012). Utilizing ADHD-specific scales and the most recent DSM-based 
measures to characterize ADHD in a carefully selected sample is necessary to advance 
our understanding of the prevalence of ADHD in males with FXS. This work is critical 
because ADHD in FXS is clearly pervasive and interferes with optimal functioning, and 
documentation of comorbidities within FXS is essential to directing effective treatment. 
However, this research is complex given the presence of co-occurring conditions such as 
intellectual disability and ASD that challenge differential diagnostic efforts. Therefore, using 
homogeneous genetic samples and implementing clearly defined DSM-based measures 
will allow for better understanding of true prevalence rates of ADHD in individuals 
with FXS. A differential diagnostic approach to known genetic and behaviorally similar 
neurodevelopmental disorders, specifically FXS and ADHD, can contribute to the field 
regarding diagnostic rates within FXS to allow for more targeted interventions that lead to 
increased independent living in this population.

The overall aims of the present study, therefore, were to (1) characterize the rate and 
presentation of ADHD diagnoses in youth with FXS using DSM-5 criteria, (2) determine 
the proportion of youth with FXS who were reported to have clinical ADHD symptoms 
on a widely-used parent rating scale, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), as well as 
the concordance between CBCL symptom cut-offs and DSM-5 ADHD diagnoses; (3) 
determine the relationship between ASD symptom severity, nonverbal cognitive ability, 
and ADHD diagnoses and symptoms; and (4) describe the use of medication in relation 
to ADHD diagnostic status in youth with FXS. We hypothesized that >50% of the youth 
with FXS would meet criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD, with more individuals meeting 
for ADHD-I over the other two presentations. We expected moderate concordance between 
the CBCL ADHD scale and DSM-5 ADHD diagnoses given the concern that broad-based 
symptoms scales may lack specificity for individuals with intellectual disability and other 
comorbidities. We hypothesized that higher levels of ASD symptoms would be associated 
with ADHD diagnoses and symptoms given evidence for shared genetic mechanisms across 
ADHD and ASD (Ghirardi et al., 2019; Pinto et al., 2016; Ronald et al., 2008), but that 
lower nonverbal cognitive ability would not relate to ADHD, consistent with Newman 
et al. (2015). We expected that about half of participants would be using medications 
targeting ADHD symptoms, with stimulants being the most common medication type. We 
expected only moderate alignment between use of ADHD-targeted medications and ADHD 
diagnoses, considering prior evidence suggesting a high rate of stimulant medication use 
among individuals with FXS without an ADHD diagnosis (Valdovinos et al., 2009).

Participants were 31 males with FXS ranging from 16-24 years of age (M = 18.73, SD = 
2.13). Genetic testing was conducted on all participants to confirm the full mutation (>200 
CGG repeats on 5’UTR of FMR1). Females were not included in the present study due 
to the heterogeneous phenotypic presentation of females with the FXS and the increased 
clinical involvement in males, which makes understanding of the extent, nature, and course 
of cooccurring challenges especially pressing for them (Bailey et al., 2008). Participants 
were drawn from a larger longitudinal multi-site study at the University of California at 
Davis and the University of South Carolina which focused on language development during 
the transition into adulthood (Abbeduto et al., 2019). Inclusionary criteria for the larger 
study required that English was the primary language, that the participants consistently used 
spontaneous two-to three-word utterances, and that they lived at home with their biological 
mother at study entry. Only individuals who participated at the University of South Carolina 
site were included in this study given a more focused interest on ADHD and the presence 
of sufficient resources at that site. Recruitment was conducted nationally through parent 
listservs, social media, postings by the National Fragile X Foundation, and with the help 
of the Research Participant Registry Core of the Carolina Institute for Developmental 
Disabilities at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The annual family incomes 
of the participants ranged from <$20,000 to >$150,000, with the median income reported at 
$80,000. Ninety percent of participants were White, 7% were Black or African American, 
and 3% were Asian.

The assessments included in the full protocol were conducted in a university laboratory 
setting and lasted two days. The measures for the present study are a subset of those 
administered. Data collection occurred based on established procedures of a larger study, 
including standardized order of test administration. Administration of the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012) was conducted on the 
morning of the second day of assessment to allow time for the participant to establish 
rapport with the examiner. Parent/caregiver report measures were completed by the 
participant’s mother. All measures were completed at the second annual time point of the 
larger longitudinal study, except the ADOS-2, which was drawn from the first-year time 
point. ASD symptoms were only measured at study entry in the larger study given the 
relative stability of ASD symptoms in adolescents with FXS over time (Hernandez et al., 
2009). Procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
South Carolina and conform to the ethical standards laid out in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
All participants assented to participation, and informed consent was obtained from the 
participants’ guardians.

to assess for the presence of ADHD symptoms and diagnosis. The PChIPS is a structured 
parent interview to assess presence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents 
aged 6-17 years old, which is consistent with the mental age of the participants enrolled 
in the present study. It queries symptom count, duration, and impairment consistent with 
DSM criteria. Questions pertaining to symptomology are presented and scored in a yes/no 
format. The current version of the PChIPS aligns with the DSM-IV; thus, we adapted the 
assessment to reflect the updated DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, which required 
two modifications: (1) allowing for the concurrent diagnosis of ADHD and ASD, and 
(2) allowing a retrospective diagnosis to be made if five symptoms were present before 
age 12 years. Examiners were trained to administer the PChIPS by a licensed clinical 
psychologist. Inter-rater reliability for ADHD presentation classification was calculated on 
20% of randomly selected samples. Percent agreement was 100% between the licensed 
psychologist and trained research staff. The categorical distinction of presence/absence of an 
ADHD disorder based on DSM-5 criteria served as the primary dependent variable in the 
analyses. The PChIPS has been applied to conditions associated with intellectual disability, 
including Phelan-McDermid syndrome (Shaw et al., 2011), FXS (Ezell et al., 2018), and 
ASD (Witwer & Lecavalier, 2010). High item-level agreement (intra-class correlation 
coefficients of 0.92 for Hyperactive, 0.97 for Inattentive, and 0.93 for Combined) and 
fair-to-moderate for diagnostic classification agreement (Hyperactive κ = 0.43, Inattentive 
κ = 0.60, and Combined κ = 0.27) has been reported between the PChIPS and the Child 
and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI; Gadow & Sprafkin, 2002) in children with ASD 
(Witwer et al., 2012).

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems Scale, Child Behavior Checklist—
(ADHD Scale, CBCL; Achenbach, 2001) was administered and is a widely used broad-
based measure of child emotional and behavioral problems that provides an index of ADHD 
symptoms. The CBCL is a well-established 118-item parent-report tool that has good 
reliability and validity and has been widely used in neurodevelopmental disabilities research 
including FXS. The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems DSM-oriented subscale 
consists of 7-items and was designed to align with the symptoms of ADHD as outlined 
in the DSM. T-scores were computed and used to determine whether individual participants 
exceeded cut-offs for clinically significant ADHD symptoms; scores of 65-69 are considered 
“borderline clinical” and scores of 70+ are considered clinically significant. The 6-18 year 
old CBCL form for was used for all participants and 18-year norms were used to calculate 
standard scores for participants older than 18, consistent with prior work (Chromik et al., 
2019; Roberts et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2018). The 6-18 form was used for all participants 
because the items were thought to be more appropriate for the developmental level of young 
adults with FXS than is the adult form.

Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition—(ADOS-2; Lord et 
al., 2012). The ADOS-2 was administered to determine ASD status and the severity 
of ASD symptoms. The ADOS-2 consists of a series of semi-structured interviews and 
play opportunities between an examiner and a participant, allowing for the observation 
of developmentally appropriate and inappropriate responses to these social exchanges. 
A continuous index of ASD symptoms, as reflected by the ADOS-2 calibrated severity

score, was also computed per the test instructions (Lord et al., 2012). Participants were 
administered the ADOS-2 module appropriate for their expressive language level and 
chronological age as specified by the administration manual, with modules 1, 2, and 
3 represented in the present sample. The ADOS-2 was administered and scored live 
by graduate-level professionals who completed standard research reliability training. Ten 
percent of the administrations were randomly selected and second-scored by video for 
inter-reliability, with percent agreement above 80% across all items and algorithm items. 
Twenty-three participants (74.2%) exceeded the threshold for ASD.

Brief IQ, Leiter-R—(Roid & Miller, 1997). The Brief IQ of the Leiter-R is a nonverbal 
intelligence measure that has strong psychometric properties and is appropriate for use with 
individuals who have limited receptive and expressive language capabilities. Growth scale 
value scores, which reflect a transformation of raw scores into an equal-interval Rasch scale, 
were used in analysis to mitigate problems associated with floor effects in the standard 
scores.

Medications Targeting ADHD Symptoms.—Information on medication use was 
gathered as part of a standard demographic form for the larger study. The use of medications 
targeting ADHD symptoms was characterized as a bivariate present/absent variable. For 
the current study, any medication indicated by caregivers as targeting ADHD, attention, or 
hyperactivity was included (all such medications fell into the drug classes of stimulants or 
alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as guanfacine).

Statistical Analyses

Descriptive statistics were computed and are presented in Table 2. Variables were examined 
for normal distribution with no need for corrections indicated. A correlation matrix was 
computed to understand the relationship among variables to inform model specification 
(Table 3). Chronological age was not associated with the ADHD variables and, therefore, 
was not covaried in statistical models. To address the first research question regarding the 
rate and presentation of ADHD, the proportion of individuals who met DSM-5 diagnostic 
criteria for ADHD on the PChIPS was computed, as was the percentage of individuals 
meeting criteria for each ADHD presentation. The second research question was addressed 
by computing the percentage of individuals who obtained borderline or clinical scores 
on the CBCL ADHD scale. Cohen’s kappa (κ; Cohen, 1960), a measure of nominal 
scale agreement between two categorization of responses commonly used as a measure of 
classification accuracy (Kwiecien et al., 2011), was obtained to evaluate the concordance 
between DSM-5 ADHD diagnoses and the CBCL ADHD scale cut-offs. Concordance 
between the two measures was also examined descriptively by computing the percent of 
individuals who did/did not obtain borderline/clinical scores on the ADHD CBCL scale 
to those who did/did not meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Our third research question 
regarding the relationship between ASD symptom severity, nonverbal cognitive ability, 
and ADHD diagnoses and symptoms was tested by fitting two logistic regression models 
that included the ADOS-2 calibrated severity score and the Leiter-R growth scale value 
scores as predictors of either DSM-5 ADHD diagnoses or the CBCL ADHD subscale 
cut-off classification. Additionally, to test relationships with continuous ADHD symptoms,

R growth scale value as predictors of the CBCL ADHD subscale T-score. To address 
the final research question about medication use, the proportion of participants taking 
medications targeting ADHD symptoms was computed. All analyses were conducted using 
SAS software, version 9.4, (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

Rate of DSM-5 ADHD Diagnoses and Presentations.

Thirteen of 31, or 41.9%, of the youth with FXS met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD 
on the PChIPS. Of those who met criteria for ADHD, 69.2% (9/13) exhibited an ADHD-I 
presentation, 15.4% (2/13) exhibited an ADHD-H, and 15.4% (2/13) exhibited ADHD-C.

Ten of 31, or 32.3%, of the youth with FXS exceeded the CBCL ADHD cut-offs. Of these 
10, 5 (16% of the total sample) obtained borderline scores and 5 (16% of the total sample) 
obtained scores in the clinical range.

Concordance Between DSM-5 ADHD Diagnosis and CBCL ADHD Cut-offs.

Cohen’s kappa was calculated at κ = 0.38 (95% CI 0.06, 0.71), which is consistent 
with “fair” levels of agreement (Cohen, 1960). DSM-5 diagnoses and the CBCL ADHD 
scale cut-offs were concordant for 70.8% of the sample (22/31), see Table 4. Of those 
who met DSM-5 criteria for ADHD per the PChIPS clinical interview, 53.8% (7/13) also 
scored within the borderline or clinical range on the CBCL ADHD scale. The majority of 
individuals who did not meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD also obtained CBCL scores that 
were below cut-offs, 83.3% (15/18). DSM-5 diagnoses and the CBCL ADHD scale cut-offs 
were disconcordant for 29.0% of the sample: 19.4% met DSM-5 criteria for ADHD but did 
not score in the borderline/clinical range for ADHD on the CBCL, and 9.6% scored above 
CBCL cut-offs but did not meet DSM-5 criteria for ADHD.

ASD Symptom Severity and Nonverbal Cognitive Ability as Predictors of ADHD Diagnoses 
and Symptoms.

The results of the logistic regression model indicated that neither ASD symptom severity 
(χ2 [1] = 0.02, p = .878, OR = 1.36) nor nonverbal cognitive ability (χ2 [1] = 1.74, p 
= .187, OR = 1.14) were significant predictors of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD 
on the PChIPS. Similarly, neither ASD symptom severity (χ2 [1] = 0.43, p = .510, OR = 
1.26) nor nonverbal cognitive ability (χ2 [1] = 0.72, p = .396, OR = 1.10) were associated 
with increased odds of scoring above the cut-off for ADHD on the CBCL. Regression 
analyses also indicated that the combined influence of ASD symptom severity and nonverbal 
cognitive ability did not account for significant variance in continuous ADHD subscale 
T-scores on the CBCL, F (2,28) = 0.05, p = 0.952, R2 < 0.01.

Frequency of Medication Use Targeting ADHD Symptoms.

Of the 31 individuals with FXS, 15 (48.4%) were taking medications that target ADHD 
symptoms. Nine of the 15 were taking stimulant medications. Of the 15 individuals using 
medications targeting ADHD symptoms, roughly half (53.3%, n = 7) met criteria for DSM-5 
ADHD.

Discussion

FXS may serve as a saturated genetic model for ADHD, based on evidence of genetic 
overlap between intellectual disability, ASD, and ADHD, with prior research focused on 
children with FXS suggesting that ADHD is a highly prevalent and impairing cooccurring 
condition. Extending prior work focused on children, the present study investigated the rates, 
presentation, and correlates of ADHD in FXS during late adolescence and young adulthood, 
applying both DSM-5 diagnostic criteria as well as broadband parent rating scales. Forty-
two percent of the adolescent and young-adult males with FXS in this study met DSM-5 
criteria for ADHD, with neither intellectual disability nor ASD symptom severity predicting 
ADHD diagnostic outcome or symptoms. Concordance between DSM-5 diagnoses and 
cut-offs on the ADHD subscale of the CBCL was fair, yielding a concordant ADHD 
classification for 71% of the sample. Nearly half of the participants were using medications 
that target ADHD symptoms, although only half of those using ADHD medications met 
DSM-5 criteria for ADHD. Through inclusion of a relatively homogeneous sample of 16- 
to 24-year-old males with FXS, the majority of whom exhibited IQ scores consistent with 
moderate intellectual disability, this report describes for practitioners the expected rates of 
ADHD co-occurrence in this subpopulation and informs methods for evaluating ADHD for 
improved identification and access to interventions.

Elevated Rate and Presentation of ADHD in Adolescent/Young Adult Males with FXS

Prevalence rates of ADHD can vary greatly across diagnostic methods, necessitating focused 
study to clarify baseline rates of ADHD in individuals with FXS. The present study is 
the first to apply DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to determine ADHD diagnoses in adolescent 
and young adult males with FXS. Focused investigations of the adolescent/young adult 
period in FXS are critical as this developmental period tends to be marked by heightened 
psychopathological risk in the general population (Rutter, 2007).

Forty-two percent of the sample met criteria for ADHD, which is in line with previous 
diagnostic studies of children with FXS that have reported rates between 35-74% using 
earlier versions of the DSM (Backes et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., 2006). Therefore, our data 
support the notion that ADHD continues to represent a significant comorbidity in FXS into 
early adulthood, at rates that significantly exceed that of the general population. Although 
some previous research has suggested abatement of ADHD symptoms in FXS with age 
(Gabis et al., 2011; Wheeler et al., 2014), the results of the current study indicate that 
ADHD symptoms in adolescents and young adults exceed diagnostic thresholds at at rates 
comparable to the rates that have been reported in children. It is possible that symptoms 
improve with age but continue to exceed diagnostic thresholds—a possibility that remains to

be addressed in future longitudinal work tracking intraindividual change in symptoms and 
diagnoses across time.

ADHD-I was the most prevalent ADHD presentation, with 29% of the sample exhibiting 
ADHD-I, 6% ADHD-H, and 6% ADHD-C. Rates of the ADHD presentations align with 
previous research employing DSM-IV criteria in younger and/or more heterogeneous 
samples. Sullivan et al. (2006) also observed ADHD-I as the dominant presentation in a 
sample of 7-13 year-old boys and girls with FXS (n = 57); ADHD-I was observed in 
32% the sample, ADHD-I in 7%, and ADHD-C in 15%. Similarly, Gabis et al. (2011) 
detected ADHD-I in 27%, ADHD-H in 13%, and ADHD-C in 7% of an older but 
smaller sample of 15 males and females with FXS, aged 12-29 years. Corroborating and 
building these earlier reports using DSM-5 criteria in a more homogeneous sample of 
males aged 16-24 years, we found that ADHD in adolescent and young adult males with 
FXS is overwhelmingly characterized by the inattentive symptoms (69% of those who met 
criteria for ADHD exhibited ADHD-I, and an additional 15% met criteria for ADHD-C). 
Characterizing ADHD presentation within FXS is of relevance because those presentations 
are associated with different clinical needs. Relative to ADHD-H, children with ADHD-I 
are more likely to show social isolation, experience comorbid anxiety and depression, and 
experience learning and reading difficulties (Baeyens et al., 2006; Paloyelis et al., 2010; 
Willcutt et al., 2001; Willcutt et al., 2007). In clinical samples, hyperactivity/impulsivity 
symptoms also tend to improve with age, whereas inattention symptoms are more likely to 
persist across development (Hurtig et al., 2007).

No Association With Nonverbal Cognitive Ability or ASD Symptoms

We did not detect an association between ASD symptom severity and ADHD diagnoses 
or symptoms. Findings on the relations between ASD symptoms/comorbidity and attention 
problems in children with FXS have been conflicting, with differences in the samples and 
methodologies making it difficult to tease apart the source of discrepancies across reports. 
Some cross-sectional reports have not detected a relationship between ADHD and ASD 
symptoms in FXS (Hatton et al., 2002; Newman et al., 2015) and emerging longitudinal 
evidence suggests that clinical ADHD symptoms in school-aged boys with FXS remain 
high and stable across time regardless of whether cooccurring ASD features are also present 
(Cornish et al., 2013). In contrast, other studies have reported association between ADHD 
and ASD symptoms in individuals with FXS (Doherty et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2012). In 
this report, we did not find evidence that ASD symptoms translated to heightened ADHD 
symptoms or higher likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis in adolescents and young adults with 
FXS.

Nonverbal cognitive ability was not associated with ADHD symptoms or diagnoses, 
which aligns with the findings of Newman et al. (2015). Understanding the relationship 
between ADHD and intellectual disability within the context of FXS, or the lack thereof, 
has implications for diagnostic practices with regard to the phenomenon of diagnostic 
overshadowing (e.g., when intellectual disability “overshadows” the presence of comorbid 
conditions such as ADHD, leading to reduced clinical recognition and treatment of 
concomitant disorders; Mason & Scior, 2004; White et al., 1995). In the present study,

ADHD symptoms and diagnoses were not related to differences in IQ, which lends validity 
to the ADHD diagnosis in FXS and highlights the need for caution when conceptualizing 
ADHD symptoms in this group as features that are inherent to the presence of intellectual 
disability. The identification of ADHD in individuals with FXS is critical to facilitating 
access to interventions that have the potential to improve quality of life.

Implications for the Assessment of ADHD Within Individuals With FXS

This report provides broad support for the utility of the PChIPS for use in FXS, while 
also underscoring the need for further formal psychometric investigation to validate the 
PChIPS for use in intellectual and developmental disabilities. Several investigations have 
now successfully applied the PChIPS to characterize mental health disorders in children with 
various forms of intellectual and developmental disabilities (Ezell et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 
2011; Witwer & Lecavalier, 2010), including a psychometric study by Witwer et al. (2012) 
that found good reliability and support for concurrent validity when applying the PChIPS 
to a sample of children with ASD. Interestingly, the PChIPS showed excellent agreement 
with the CASI for item-level ADHD symptoms, while concordance between the two 
measures for ADHD diagnostic outcome was only fair. Witwer et al. (2012) speculated that 
diagnostic discrepancies may have been related to the challenges of capturing impairment 
associated with ADHD within a population that also experiences concomitant behavioral 
difficulties related to ASD (i.e., caregivers may be less reliable in recognizing and endorsing 
ADHD-related impairment when their child experiences pervasive impairment related to 
other cooccurring conditions). Notably, however, the PChIPS and CASI were not more 
discordant in subgroups of children with ASD with IQs above or below 70, suggesting that 
the PChIPS performed equivocally in children with and without cooccurring intellectual 
disability (Witwer et al., 2012). While more psychometric work is needed, the present 
report builds on evidence that the PChIPS can be successfully applied to populations with 
intellectual disability.

The present study also has implications for the use of the CBCL to characterize ADHD in 
FXS. The CBCL is a widely-used broadband symptom scale that shows moderate sensitivity 
and specificity for identifying ADHD in clinical and community settings (Chang et al., 
2016). However, the CBCL has also been suggested to lack specificity for individuals with 
co-occurring disorders (Pandolfi et al., 2012) and, therefore, may result in overestimation 
of ADHD rates in FXS relative. We found that the Kappa classification agreement between 
the CBCL ADHD cut-offs and DSM-5 diagnoses determined via the PChIPS were only 
fair in this sample of adolescents and young adults with FXS. The CBCL missed 19% 
of those who met DSM-5 criteria for ADHD. Compared to the 42% rate of ADHD 
determined via the DSM-5, 32% of the sample exceeded the CBCL cut-off scores for 
ADHD when considering both borderline and clinical scores as elevated. When only clinical 
CBCL scores were considered, just 16% of the sample exceeded cut-offs. These findings 
closely mirror the results of Sullivan et al.’s (2006) study of children with FXS in which 
only 6% of the sample exceeded CBCL ADHD clinical cut-offs, compared to 53% when 
parents completed a DSM-IV-based ADHD symptom inventory. Together, these findings 
suggest under-identification of ADHD in FXS via the CBCL, rather than over-identification. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when relying on the CBCL to characterize ADHD

in individuals with FXS; the use of a DSM-based ADHD-specific interview/symptom 
inventory appears to improve identification accuracy. When employing the CBCL, both 
borderline and clinical scores should be considered, as reliance on only the clinical scores 
resulted in gross underestimation of ADHD rates in both the present study and in the 
Sullivan et al. (2006) report.

Medication Use

Nearly half of the adolescents and young adults in this study were using ADHD-targeted 
medications, which is similar to rates of medication usage found in previous research 
(Roberts et al., 2011a). Stimulants were the most commonly used drug class to target 
ADHD, which is notable given that stimulants are poorly tolerated in FXS—they represent 
the psychotropic medication that is most likely to be discontinued, with common side 
effects of anxiety, irritability, and mood lability (Berry-Kravis & Potanos, 2004; Valdovinos 
et al., 2009). Interestingly, about half of the participants who were using ADHD-targeted 
medications did not meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The reason for this is unclear, 
although it could reflect use of stimulant medications in individuals with FXS who display 
some subthreshold symptoms of ADHD. It is also possible that ADHD-targeted medications 
were prescribed to treat symptoms other than ADHD; for example, a nation-wide survey by 
Valdovinos et al. (2009) found surprisingly high rates of stimulant use in individuals with 
FXS who had difficulty with anxiety. Although medication is typically the first course of 
intervention for individuals with FXS who exhibit ADHD, future research should examine 
the utility of a combined pharmaceutical and behavioral approach, as this approach is 
typically most effective in the management of ADHD outside of the context of FXS (Parens 
& Johnston, 2009; Pelham et al., 2000).

Strengths, Limitations, and Directions

Strengths of the present study include the narrow, well-defined sample of individuals with 
FXS, who were all males with intellectual disability falling between the ages of 16- to 
21 years. Although a trade-off to the inclusion of such a homogenous sample was a more 
limited sample size of 31 individuals, the focused sample clarifies the expected ADHD 
profile in males with FXS during adolescence and young adulthood, specifically. The use of 
a DSM-based diagnostic interview to evaluate the presences of ADHD is also a strength, and 
this is the first report to apply the new DSM-5 criteria to a FXS sample.

There are a number of measurement considerations. First, our multimethod approach 
incorporating both the PChIPS and the CBCL is a strength. However, it should be 
acknowledged that differential diagnosis of ADHD in a clinical setting would involve 
multiple sources of information (parent and teacher report data, behavioral measures, etc) 
paired with professional clinical judgement. Therefore, our determination of ADHD status is 
still limited relative to a thorough clinical evaluation. Additionally, our use of parent report 
can be viewed as a limitation as parent perceptions of impairment can be skewed due to 
the significant level of impairment in children with intellectual disability and particularly 
individuals with FXS. However, self-reported behaviors were not an option in this FXS 
sample due to intellectual disability and low language skills. Future studies pairing parent-
report data with clinical observation or teacher-report data may help mitigate rater biases.

Another limitation was our use of the CBCL 6-18 form for all participants; 13 participants 
were above the age range of the norming sample. Although this approach is consistent 
with prior work (Chromik et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2018) and 
appropriate given the developmental level of the participants, it should be acknowledged that 
the standard scores for the older participants may have decreased validity.

Conclusions

ADHD continues to represent a significant comorbidity in FXS through the adolescent and 
young adult years, with 42% of 16- to 21-year-old males in the present study meeting 
DSM-5 criteria for ADHD. Evaluation of ADHD via the CBCL yielded lower rates of 
ADHD and classification agreement between the DSM-5 and CBCL ADHD subscale was 
only fair, suggesting that overreliance on the CBCL may result in under-characterization of 
ADHD symptoms in FXS. ADHD diagnoses and symptoms were not predicted by low IQ or 
the presence of ASD symptoms in this sample of males with FXS, which has implications 
for the phenomenon of “diagnostic overshadowing,” or the clinical tendency to overlook 
comorbid conditions in the presence of intellectual disability. This report describes for 
practitioners the expected rates of ADHD in adolescent and young adult males with FXS 
and ADHD measurement in this group, in efforts to facilitating access to interventions and 
improve quality of life.
