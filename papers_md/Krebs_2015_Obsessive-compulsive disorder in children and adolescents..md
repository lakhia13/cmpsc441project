Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children
and adolescents
Georgina Krebs,1,2 Isobel Heyman3,4

ABSTRACT
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in childhood and
adolescence is an impairing condition, associated with a
speciﬁc set of distressing symptoms incorporating
repetitive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and distressing,
time-consuming rituals (compulsions). This review
considers current knowledge of causes and mechanisms
underlying OCD, as well as assessment and treatment.
Issues relating to differential diagnosis are summarised,
including the challenges of distinguishing OCD from
autism spectrum disorders and tic disorders in youth.
The recommended treatments, namely cognitive
behaviour therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibiting/
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications, are
outlined along with the existing evidence-based and
factors associated with treatment resistance. Finally,
novel clinical developments that are emerging in the
ﬁeld and future directions for research are discussed.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychi-
atric condition characterised by persistent and
unwanted intrusive thoughts,
images and urges
(obsessions) and repetitive behaviours or mental
acts (compulsions) (see table 1). Once considered
to be rare in youth, epidemiological studies have
found an estimated prevalence of 0.25%–4%
among children and adolescents.1–3 Left untreated
symptoms may wax and wane but typically follow a
chronic course4 5 and cause marked functional
impairment across multiple domains, including at
home, school and socially.6 Furthermore, paediatric
OCD is associated with increased risk of other psy-
chiatric disorders in adulthood.7 8

AETIOLOGY
The aetiology of paediatric OCD remains relatively
poorly understood, despite considerable research to
date. Data from twin, family and segregation studies
strongly support a genetic component.9 Twin studies
have shown that genetic factors explain 45%–65% of
the variance of OCD in children,10 pointing to a
higher heritability in OCD relative to most other
and depression in youth.11
anxiety disorders
Interestingly, the heritability of OCD appears to be
greater in paediatric compared with adult cohorts,10
supporting the notion of early-onset OCD as a puta-
tive developmental subtype of the disorder. The
results of genome-wide association studies12 13 and
meta-analyses of candidate gene studies14 suggest
that the genetic inﬂuence on OCD is polygenic, with
many genes involved which individually exert a rela-
tively small effect on the phenotype. In particular,
genes within the serotonergic, dopaminergic and glu-
tamatergic system appear to inﬂuence OCD.15

Neuropsychological models of OCD propose that
OCD arises from alterations to frontostriatal cir-
cuitry. Hyperactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex
has been proposed to mediate persistent thoughts
about threat and harm (ie, obsessions), which in
turn lead to attempts to neutralise the perceived
threat (ie, compulsions). There is robust evidence
from functional neuroimaging studies of increased
activation in the lateral and medial orbitofrontal
cortex in both children and adults with OCD.15
Interestingly, orbitofrontal brain dysfunction has
also been found in unaffected relatives of patients
with OCD, who are at genetic risk of OCD.16
Importantly, treatment studies have demonstrated
reduced activation in the orbitofrontal cortex fol-
lowing cognitive behaviour
for
therapy (CBT)
OCD,15 demonstrating some degree of plasticity.

While genetic factors clearly inﬂuence the expres-
sion of OCD, environmental factors also play a sig-
niﬁcant role, but remarkably little is known about
these effects. Few prospective studies have been con-
ducted, and results have been inconsistent. For
example, one longitudinal study found that social
isolation, physical abuse and negative emotionality
were speciﬁc predictors of an adult OCD diagno-
sis.17 In contrast, a recent retrospective study found
no evidence for an association between adverse
childhood experiences and OCD, although such
experiences were related to certain comorbidities,
including depression.18

There has been emerging clinical evidence over
the past 10–15 years of a subgroup of children who
experience sudden onset OCD and/or tics after
streptococcal infection. This group of children was
originally given the acronym PANDAS ( paediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated
with streptococcus),19 but more recently the term
PANS ( paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syn-
drome) has been used in preference, as it is felt to
capture both the sudden onset and the uncertainty
about aetiology.20 These children tend to have
more widespread neuropsychiatric difﬁculties than
other children with OCD,
including enuresis,
deterioration in handwriting and impulsivity. The
exact mechanism of sudden onset neuropsychiatric
disorder is unknown, but there has been interest in
delivering therapies that target immune and infec-
tious causes. However, other small studies suggest
that OCD in this population responds as well to
standard treatments, and effectiveness of prophy-
lactic antibiotics has been inconsistent.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND CLASSIFICATION
The diagnosis of OCD in young people is broadly
similar to adults (see box 1 for the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic criteria).

However, it has been noted that children are less likely to have
insight into the irrationality of their obsessions and compul-
sions,21 presumably due to underdeveloped meta-cognitive
skills. Furthermore, in children, it is important to differentiate
true compulsions from normal routines or ritualised behaviours,
which are typically transient and no cause for concern. For
example, many children display speciﬁc routines at bedtime
such as saying goodnight in a particular way to their parents
and/or toys.22 In order to be considered a compulsion, a behav-
iour must be distressing and/or impairing.

Historically OCD has been considered to be an anxiety dis-
order. Indeed, OCD is listed as a ‘neurotic, stress-related and
somatoform disorder’ along with anxiety disorders in ICD-10,
and similarly it was classiﬁed as an anxiety disorder in the
Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM)-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV. However, in light of accu-
mulating evidence for key differences in the phenomenology
and aetiology of OCD compared with other anxiety disorders,23
its classiﬁcation has changed within DSM-5 and it now falls

diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder

1. Either obsessions or compulsions or both present on most

days for a period of 2 weeks.

2. Obsessions (unwanted ideas, images or impulses that
repeatedly enter a person’s mind) and compulsions
(repetitive stereotyped behaviours or mental acts driven by
rules that must be applied rigidly) share the following
features:
▸ Patient is aware that these originate from their own

mind.

▸ They are repetitive, unpleasant and distressing to the
patient. At least one is perceived as excessive or
unreasonable (‘egodystonic’).

▸ At least one is resisted unsuccessfully, even though
others may be present that the sufferer no longer
resists.

▸ Thought of carrying out the obsession or compulsion is
not intrinsically pleasurable (simple relief of tension
momentarily on completion of the thought/act is not
regarded as pleasure in this sense).

3. The symptoms must be disabling. Even young children will
have some insight into the senselessness of the thoughts
and behaviours.

within the new ‘OCD and related disorders’
section.
This section also includes a number of other disorders that are
characterised by repetitive thinking and repetitive behaviour,
such as body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder and
trichotillomania.

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS
OCD typically goes undetected for many years before an accur-
ate diagnosis is made.24 Delays in detection in young people
may reﬂect embarrassment and attempts to conceal symptoms,
poor insight and/or difﬁculty differentiating true OCD from
normative rituals during development.25 Furthermore, while
OCD is often associated with a characteristic set of symptoms
(eg, excessive washing, repeated checking), the disorder is strik-
ingly heterogeneous; two individuals with OCD may present
with entirely non-overlapping symptom proﬁles, which can
present a diagnostic challenge. Nevertheless, the majority of
paediatric OCD cases be identiﬁed using a six-question screen-
ing instrument, the Short OCD Screener (SOCS), recommended
by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (see
box 2).26 The SOCS has been found to have a sensitivity of
97% (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98) in detecting OCD. As it is not a
diagnostic instrument, further assessment is required in indivi-
duals who screen positive including taking a detailed history of
obsessions and compulsions, a developmental history and a sep-
arate interview with the young person.27 The latter is particu-
larly important given that ’taboo’ obsessions, such as sexual
obsessions, are common and the young person may be reluctant
to disclose them in front of relatives.28

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Differential diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in paediat-
ric populations; three of the most complex differential diagno-
ses are outlined below.

Restricted interests and stereotyped behaviours are a core
feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and may result in
both cognitive preoccupations
and repetitive behaviours.
Stereotyped behaviours can manifest as a phenocopy of compul-
sions (eg, ordering and arranging toys) and it is crucial to delin-
eate ASD-related behaviours from true compulsions in order to
inform treatment.
to autism-related stereotyped
behaviours, compulsions are usually (a) preceded by an obses-
sion, (b) associated with relief in anxiety and (c) egodystonic (ie,
unwanted and inconsistent with the individual’s fundamental
values) and the behaviour itself is not experienced as being
intrinsically pleasurable. Of course, a young person may present
with both ASD and OCD, and indeed prevalence rates of OCD
are signiﬁcantly elevated among individuals with ASD.29

In contrast

4. Do your daily activities take a long time to ﬁnish?

(eg, getting ready for school)

5. Are you concerned about putting things in a special order or

are you very upset by mess?
6. Do these problems trouble you?

Detecting and treating OCD in the context of ASD can signiﬁ-
cantly improve functioning and quality of life.30

Another common differential diagnosis is OCD and tic disor-
ders. Up to 59% of children and adolescents with OCD meet
criteria for a diagnosis of a tic disorder at some point during
their lifetime.31 Individuals with comorbid tic disorders may
display an earlier age of onset of OCD and a different symptom
proﬁle compared with those without tic disorders.32 Complex
tics, in particular, can be difﬁcult to differentiate from compul-
sions: as with autism-related stereotyped behaviours, the behav-
iour itself can appear identical to a compulsion (eg, touching
and tapping). However, while tics are largely involuntary, com-
pulsions are performed deliberately to relieve anxiety. The level
of complexity of the behaviour may also help to differentiate
tics from compulsions; even complex tics are relatively straight-
forward behaviours (eg, a brief tapping action), whereas com-
pulsions are often more elaborate and performed according to a
rule (eg, tapping four times with the left hand and four times
with the right hand). Differentiating an OCD component is
important, as OCD treatments are effective in children with tics
and OCD, and OCD can be the most impairing aspect of their
condition.33

A third differential diagnosis that can be challenging is psych-
osis and OCD. The bizarre nature of obsessional thoughts can
often raise queries of psychotic phenomena, especially in cases
where the young person has limited insight into the irrationality
of their obsessions. For example, a proportion of young people
with OCD present with ‘transformation obsessions’, which
refers to a fear of turning into someone or something else or
acquiring unwanted characteristics.34 These unusual symptoms
can easily be confused with delusions, leading to inappropriate
treatment.34 Similarly, aggressive obsessions such as a fear of
being harmed can appear similar to paranoia. In cases of OCD,
the individual may have some insight into the irrationality of
their fears; the obsessional thought is unlikely to be part of a
broader delusional set of beliefs (eg, a plot of how and why
others would want to harm them); and other symptoms of
OCD are likely to be present upon questioning whereas other
symptoms of psychosis (such as hallucinations and thought-
disorder) are absent.

TREATMENT
There are two treatments with an established evidence base in
the treatment of paediatric OCD, namely CBT incorporating
exposure with response prevention (E/RP) and selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).35 CBT for paediatric OCD is
a relatively short-term treatment, usually consisting of 12–20
weekly sessions. The main therapeutic strategy is E/RP, which
involves the young person gradually confronting their feared
situations (eg, touching dirty door handles) and refraining from
carrying out compulsions (eg, handwashing) in an attempt to
neutralise their anxiety or feared outcome. Instead, the young
person is encouraged to wait until their anxiety comes down
naturally, and then to repeatedly practice the same E/RP task
until their anxiety extinguishes altogether (ie, habituation). E/RP
tasks are set up in graded way, as guided by a hierarchy, and are
carried out in sessions with the therapist and in between ses-
sions as homework.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that
CBT is an efﬁcacious treatment for paediatric OCD. The treat-
ment is associated with a 40%–65% reduction in symptoms36
and can be effective for children as young as 3 years when deliv-
ered in a developmentally appropriate format.37 Gains appear
to be relatively enduring and have been shown to be maintained

Review

up to 18-month follow-up.38 Encouragingly, similar outcomes
have been observed in community clinics (ie, non-research set-
tings), suggesting that CBT protocols are effective in routine
clinical practice.39 40

In line with the robust evidence base, there is international
consensus that CBT should be offered to all young people with
OCD and should be the ﬁrst-line treatment in mild to moderate
cases of OCD.35 41 In more severe cases or where young people
fail to respond to CBT, medication should be considered in add-
ition to CBT. RCTs have shown a range of SSRIs (ﬂuoxetine,
sertraline, paroxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, citalopram) to be effective
in the treatment of paediatric OCD; they are associated with a
29%–44% reduction in symptoms and appear to be well toler-
ated and safe.36 Few comparative treatment trials of different
SSRIs have been undertaken, so there is little or no evidence to
suggest
that any one SSRI is more effective than another.
However, in the UK, currently only sertraline and ﬂuvoxamine
are licensed for use in children, with sertraline recommended
because of its favourable side effect proﬁle.

Only one study to date has directly compared the efﬁcacy of
CBT versus SSRI medication in paediatric OCD.42 This study
found that CBT and sertraline were associated with comparable
levels of symptom reduction, but that combined CBT and SSRI
treatment was associated with superior outcomes. More recently,
the same group has investigated the extent to which CBT
improves outcomes among young people receiving SRIs for
OCD.43 They found that the individuals who received CBT
compared with medication management alone had better out-
comes, indicating that the combination of CBT and medication
is superior to medication as a monotherapy in paediatric OCD.
Interestingly, young people who received brief CBT instructions
did not show any better response than those who received medi-
cation alone, suggesting that a truncated form of CBT is not
effective in this population.

TREATMENT-RESISTANT OCD
A proportion of young people with OCD do not respond to
CBT or SSRIs, and an even larger proportion make gains but are
left with clinically signiﬁcant residual symptoms. A number of
treatment
studies have attempted to identify predictors of
response in an attempt to understand the mechanisms under-
lying treatment resistance. Perhaps, most attention has been
given to the impact of comorbidity on treatment response.
Comorbidity is common in paediatric OCD, with up to 80%
meeting diagnostic criteria for an additional psychiatric dis-
order.42 Although some comorbidities, such as depression and
anxiety disorders, do not appear to affect response to CBT or
SSRIs, others may have an impact. For example,
individuals
with comorbid tic disorders tend to have a poorer response to
SSRIs but respond equally well to CBT compared with those
without tics.44 Externalising disorders (oppositional deﬁant dis-
order and conduct disorder) have been shown to predict a
worse response to SSRIs and CBT,44 and there is some sugges-
tion that individuals presenting with this dual diagnosis would
beneﬁt from modiﬁed treatment approaches, such as CBT com-
bined with parent management training.45 Similarly, it has been
suggested that individuals with ASDs respond less well to CBT
for OCD, highlighting the need for modiﬁed CBT protocols in
this group.46

Children with OCD who fail to respond to a course of CBTand
an initial SSRI administered for at least 12 weeks at the maximum
tolerated dose should usually have additional trials of at least one
other SSRI. The tricyclic drug clomipramine (a non-SSRI) may be
a useful medication to trial in resistant cases where two or more

SSRIs have failed, although it is less well tolerated than SSRIs.
There is also some RCTevidence in adults, and emerging evidence
in children that augmentation of SSRI medication with a low dose
of a dopamine antagonist can improve response rate, with up to
showing improvement.47
50% of previous non-responders
However, studies have variable outcomes, and a recent RCT in
adults who had been non-responsive to SSRIs demonstrated that
delivering high-quality exposure-based CBT was more efﬁcacious
than risperidone augmentation.48 The key message again for treat-
ment in children with OCD is that they should have access to
exposure-based CBT and that risperidone augmentation is a less-
favourable option.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
A major clinical challenge is the dissemination of good quality
CBT to young people with OCD. Unfortunately, the vast major-
ity of OCD sufferers fail to access CBT due to geographical bar-
riers and/or a shortage of appropriately trained therapists.49 In
recent years,
research has begun to focus on developing
evidence-based methods for increasing the availability of, and
access to, CBT. Novel approaches that have shown promise
include CBT delivered via telephone50 or web-camera51 and
internet CBT with minimal therapist input.52 While further val-
idation is required, these methods have the potential to trans-
form service delivery for this population.

In addition to efforts to disseminate current evidence-based
treatments for paediatric OCD, recent research has also focused
on ways of enhancing CBT in order to improve outcomes, par-
ticularly for the signiﬁcant minority who do not beneﬁt from
existing CBT protocols. For example, family conﬂict and parental
blame have been shown to be associated with poorer CBT
outcome in young people with OCD53 and pilot data suggest that
family therapy speciﬁcally aimed at targeting these dynamics is
an effective adjunct to CBT in families that present with these dif-
ﬁculties.54 With respect to pharmacological developments,
in
recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of d-
cycloserine (DCS) as a potential augmentation strategy for CBT
for OCD. DCS is a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist
and animal studies have shown that DCS enhances extinction
learning, which has raised the question of whether DCS could
augment
anxiety disorders.
However, ﬁndings remain mixed with some studies demonstrat-
ing an augmentation effect of DCS on CBT for OCD,55 but not
others.56 These discrepancies may reﬂect methodological differ-
ences between studies, and further research is needed to establish
the possible value of DCS in treating OCD in youth.

according to guidelines

CONCLUSIONS
OCD commonly starts in childhood, and in addition to causing
signiﬁcant distress and impairment in children,
it can persist
into adult life where the WHO ranks it as one of the most
impairing illnesses.57 National guidelines exist for the assess-
ment and treatment of OCD, and children should be offered
interventions
incorporating these
evidence-based treatments. A substantial proportion of children
and adolescents will respond with full or partial remission to
CBT, which may be combined with an SRI/SSRI. Unfortunately,
inadequate provision of CBT means limitations in access to
treatments, and current research aims to establish more access-
ible and economic formats of CBT. Ongoing research into the
genetic and biological basis of OCD and its relationship with
infections/autoimmunity may also in time increase understand-
ing of mechanisms and offer new treatment possibilities.
