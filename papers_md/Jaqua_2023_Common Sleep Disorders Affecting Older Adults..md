Abstract

Sleep disorders in older adults increase with aging, likely due to 
increased sleep latency, decreased sleep efficiency, and total sleep 
time. Common sleep issues include chronic insomnia, circadian 
rhythm sleep–wake disorders, sleep- related movement disorders, 
and sleep- disordered breathing. Diagnostic tools, such as a 
comprehensive sleep history and questionnaires, or a sleep log for 
more specific complaints, are commonly used. Polysomnography 
is not recommended as a routine test; however, it can be used 
for abnormal behaviors during sleep or if treatment fails. Sleep 
disorder management is based on the etiology and may include 
nonpharmacological and pharmacological alternative treatments. 
For example, nonpharmacological management for chronic insomnia 
and some sleep disorders may consist of cognitive behavioral 
therapy, sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, sleep 
restriction, light therapy, and stimulus control therapy. Because 
the quality of evidence for pharmacological treatment is poor, the 
medication choice should be based on shared decision- making 
between the practitioner and the patient, with limited prescription.

Introduction

Sleep disorders are not part 
of the normal aging process, 
but their prevalence may 
increase with age. Therefore, 
it is crucial to identify factors 
associated with sleep distur-
bances, including substance 
abuse, chronic medical illnesses, 
psychiatric conditions, reduced 
physical activity, and changes 
in sleep habits that can be 
expected in older adults. In 
addition, poor sleep is linked 
to memory loss and worsening 
health outcomes in comparison 
to older adults without sleep

complaints.1 A few studies have 
also showed an increase in early 
mortality, nursing home place-
ment, and suicide risk in older 
adults with sleep disorders.2

Diagnosing sleep disorders in 
the elderly can be challenging, 
given the physiological changes 
in this population. For example, 
older adults have increased 
sleep latency and decreased 
sleep efficiency and total sleep 
time. The age- related changes 
in sleep structure include alter-
ations in rapid eye movement 
(REM) and non- REM sleep.2–4 
Non- REM sleep has 3 stages,

namely, N1, N2, and N3; older adults have less N3 
sleep and an increased percentage of the N1 and 
N2 stages. Also, older adults have decreased REM 
sleep and earlier sleep onset than younger adults, 
as well as increased incidences of nighttime awak-
enings and more daytime napping.3,4 See Table 1.

Managing sleep disorders in older adults can be 
difficult due to their multiple comorbidities and 
medication side effects. However, treating the 
sleep condition or any common comorbidities 
associated with sleep difficulties may improve 
their quality of life and the consequences related 
to a lack of sleep.2 Unfortunately, many older 
adults use over- the- counter medication to self- 
manage their sleep condition, increasing the risk 
of dependence, addiction, and falls, as well as 
cognitive impairment.1

Common sleep disorders in older adults are 
divided into several categories. These include 
chronic insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep–wake 
disorders (CRSWDs), sleep- related movement 
disorders, and sleep- breathing disorders (SBDs).6 
This article will review these sleep conditions in 
more depth and highlight their nonpharmaco-
logical and pharmacological management in the 
elderly population.

In this review, the authors aimed to update health 
care professionals on the more recent treatments 
and recommendations available to help them 
manage sleep disorders within their older adult 
population. This review incorporates sleep hygiene 
recommendations, and behavioral therapies, as 
well as possible pharmacological management.

Chronic Insomnia

DEFINITION
According to the International Classification of Sleep 
Disorder diagnostic criteria, insomnia is defined as 
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep associated 
with daytime impairment.7 The sleep problems must 
occur at least 3 times per week and be present for 
at least 3 months.7

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Approximately 50% of the elderly complain about 
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.8 Further-
more, sleep difficulties are more prevalent in females 
than males of all ages, increasing from 10% in young 
adults to 30% to 48% in older adults.2,8 Self- reported 
sleep difficulties are more common in older Black 
females, especially in those with associated chronic 
diseases and depression.2 Sleep maintenance is 
the most common type of insomnia (50% to 70%), 
followed by difficulty initiating sleep (35% to 60%). 
Roughly 25% of older adults report nonrestorative 
sleep.8

DIAGNOSIS
Insomnia in older adults is often chronic and 
commonly associated with other medical and 
psychiatric conditions.2 The increased sleep distur-
bance with age is mainly related to higher risk 
factors for sleep disturbance than the aging process 
itself.2,3 A comprehensive sleep history is used to 
evaluate sleep disorders, including sleep–wake 
patterns, daytime consequences, presleep condi-
tions, and time spent napping during the daytime. 
Furthermore, asking about medications, other 
substances taken for sleep, and specific insomnia 
complaints with a questionnaire, interview, or a 
2- week sleep log is advised.4,5,9

In addition, a comprehensive sleep evaluation should 
try to rule out alternative causes like medical condi-
tions, psychiatric disorders, and substance abuse.9 
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not 
recommend polysomnography or daytime sleep 
latency testing in the routine evaluation of chronic 
insomnia.9 However, polysomnography is endorsed 
for a sleep- related breathing disorder, narcolepsy, 
abnormal behaviors during sleep, or if treatment 
fails.2,4 Neuroimaging is not recommended as an 
acceptable means of evaluating insomnia.9

NONPHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Multiple nonpharmacological treatment options, 
including cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 

THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL | 123

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older Adults(CBT- I), sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, 
imagery, sleep restriction, and stimulus control 
therapy, should be considered first- line therapies.6,10 
For more information, see Table 2 and Table 3.

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Pharmacological management can be used in 
those who fail to respond to nonpharmaco-
therapy or still have severe symptoms.15 The 
overall quality of evidence for pharmacologic 
treatment is low. Medication choices should be 
based on shared decision- making between the 
practitioner and the patient, and use of prescrip-
tion medications should be limited to ≤ 5 weeks15 
(Table 4). Other options that can be used if other 
agents are not effective include atypical antipsy-
chotics, such as quetiapine (25–100 mg/d), tiag-
abine (4–6 mg/d), gabapentin (100–600 mg/d), 
and pregabalin (150–300 mg/d).6

The Choosing Wisely campaign by the Amer-
ican Board of Internal Medicine Foundation does 
not recommend using benzodiazepines or other 
sedative–hypnotics in the elderly population as 
a first- line treatment for insomnia, agitation, or 
delirium because it may increase morbidity and 
mortality.26 Additionally, several studies have 
demonstrated tolerance and worsening sleep 
quality with long- term hypnotic use.2

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine also 
recommends against a few medications prescribed 
to the older population due to the limited evidence 
supporting effectiveness; these medications include 
trazodone, tiagabine, diphenhydramine, melatonin, 
tryptophan, and valerian.2,15 Hypnotics, such as 

Successful practices for a healthy sleep

Be consistent—wake up at the same time during the weekdays, 
weekends, and vacations.

Sleep 7–8 h every night.

Use the bed only for sleep and sex.

Avoid staying in bed if not asleep after 15–20 min.

Make the bedroom a comfortable and quiet place with a cool 
temperature.

Limit bright and blue light exposure in the evenings.

Stop using electronic devices 30–60 min before bedtime.

Cut back screen time 2 h before bedtime.

Avoid alcohol or a large dinner before bedtime.

Refrain from consuming caffeine 6–8 h before bedtime.

Exercise regularly during the day.

Decrease fluid intake before bedtime.

Adjust the air conditioning to reduce body temperature by 1°C (1.8°F) 
2–3 h before bedtime to help fall asleep within 20 min.

The best sleeping temperature is between 15.6 and 20°C (60 and 68°F).

Eat a low- fat and low- added- sugar supper before bedtime.

If unable to fall asleep, leave the bed and do a quiet activity with low- 
light levels.

Try to avoid going to bed if you are not sleepy.

Manage stressors by writing them in a journal before bed.

Meditate to handle anxiety.

Try non- blue light creative activities such as puzzles, find- a- word, and 
coloring books to avoid overthinking.

Hum a favorite song because it calms the brain and vagus nerve. 
Humming doesn’t even need to be out loud to get this benefit.

Table 2: Sleep hygiene education2,11–13

benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines (Z- drugs), 
should not be used for insomnia in the older popu-
lation due to tolerance and dependency, as well as 
ataxia, falls, and cognitive impairment.27 In addition, 

Intervention

CBT- I

Sleep restriction therapy

Stimulus control therapy

Relaxation Techniques

Description

First- line treatment. Frequently involves 6–10 sessions of therapy focused on cognitive beliefs and 
behaviors associated with sleep disorders.

Limit time in bed until sleep efficiency improves. Determine the average total sleep time (ATST) and 
add 30 min. Set up a wake- up and bedtime. For example, if the ATST is 6 h and the wake- up time is 
6 am, the bedtime will be midnight. It may be increased by 15 min weekly if feeling tired until sleeping 
better—no naps during the daytime.

Use the bed only to sleep. If not asleep, get out of bed and return only if sleepy—no reading or 
watching TV in bed. Avoid exceeding > 15 min in bed if not asleep.

Breathing exercises, paced diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing), mediation, biofeedback, and 
progressive muscle relaxation. In addition, nose breathing, such as slow breathing with prolonged 
expiration and tiny breaths, has been shown to help with anxiety by decreasing psychological and 
physiological arousal.

Brief behavioral therapy for insomnia

A shorter form of CBT- I focused on improving circadian sleep regulation in fewer sessions.

Light therapy

Exposure to sunlight or a lightbox/visor with light intensity from 2000 to 10,000 lux. Use early morning 
light therapy for the delayed sleep phase and evening light therapy for the advanced sleep phase.

Literature regarding use 
in the elderly

In a study with 76 
elderly patients, 
dosages at 1 mg, 3 
mg, and 6 mg were 
all equally safe, but 
patients had increased 
success at 6 mg.6

Some small studies have 
shown that patients 
with Alzheimer’s benefit 
from mirtazapine.6
It may exacerbate 
hyponatremia or 
cause SIADH in the 
elderly. Monitor sodium 
closely.17

Although evidence 
is limited, a small 
randomized, double- 
blind trial showed 
subjective improvement 
in sleep. Another 
trial with AD patients 
showed safety at 50 mg 
dosage.18

A systematic review 
of 24 articles found 
that this medication 
was optimal for sleep 
maintenance insomnia 
in older adults.19

In a meta- analysis 
with older adults, 
Eszopiclone and low- 
dose doxepin were 
superior for total 
subjective and objective 
sleep time compared to 
placebo.19

Not recommended 
due to increased falls, 
confusion, increased ED 
visits, hospitalizations,

In a double- blind trial 
with 205 older adults, 
zolpidem decreased 
sleep latency and 
increased total sleep 
time.21

In a large (n = 800) 
randomized, double- 
blind study, ramelteon 
increased total sleep 
time and decreased

physicians should take caution in prescribing medica-
tions and check for adverse reactions and interactions 
with current medications. Polypharmacy is linked 
to falls, overdose, cognitive impairment, and death, 
particularly when prescribing ≥ 3 central nervous 
system (CNS)–active medications.27

OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATIONS AND  
COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE SUPPLEMENTS
Beyond prescribed medications, there have been 
noted off- label uses of common medicines for 
insomnia.17 For example, diphenhydramine, even 
though it is strongly discouraged by the American 
Geriatric Society due to its risk of anticholinergic 
effects, is sometimes taken off- label for insomnia.17 
Another concern is that diphenhydramine, espe-
cially when combined with other anticholinergics, 
can increase the risk of confusion and falls in the 
elderly.17

Melatonin is a customarily used supplement for 
insomnia. Produced in the pineal gland naturally, 
synthetic compounds work to mimic the original.28 
Caution should be used with melatonin, as the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not 
regulate it, so preparations can vary greatly.28 More 
studies need to be performed to evaluate its efficacy; 
however, there have been studies showing increased 
sleep quality and morning alertness in elderly adults > 
55 years old.28

Valerian root is another usual complementary treat-
ment for insomnia. Valerian root is effective in 

126  | THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL

subjective, but not objective, parameters for sleep 
and can cause side effects, such as gastrointestinal 
upset, allergic reaction, headaches, and restlessness.29 
However, in a meta- analysis of 10 studies including > 
1000 patients, valerian root had varying outcomes but 
was shown to have no adverse reactions and was safe 
for patients from 7 to 80 years old.30

Last, patients with mild insomnia and discomfort 
due to pain may benefit from over- the- counter acet-
aminophen before sleep.2

Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake 
Disorders

DEFINITION
A disparity between the endogenous circadian rhythm 
and the external environment (the social or physical 
activity) may lead to CRSWDs.6,31

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Factors influencing circadian rhythm include age, less 
exposure to light, food intake, and reduced activity.6 
About 20% of the elderly experience early morning 
awakening.2,6,31

DIAGNOSIS
Extrinsic CRSWDs include work shift disorder (due to 
reduced total sleep hours because of a change in work 
schedule) and jet lag disorder (when the endogenous 
circadian rhythm does not match the time zone).6 

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older AdultsHowever, intrinsic CRSWDs are caused by alterations 
to the endogenous circadian rhythm system, which 
include delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, sleep 
occurring at least 2 hours after an expected social 
time, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, irreg-
ular sleep–wake rhythm disorder, irregular sleep and 
awake episodes, and non–24- hour sleep–wake phase 
disorder.6,31 Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is 
most common in the elderly. Sleep onset is involun-
tary, occurring at least 2 hours before the expected 
time, and the awakening is spontaneous in the early 
morning.6 If older adults try to sleep late, they still 
wake up early.

Comorbid conditions, like obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), 
should be ruled out, as well as depression and bipolar 
disorder, because they can cause early morning 
awakening.6,31

NONPHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Nonpharmacological treatment includes light 
therapy and behavior therapy.6 Patients are 
advised to stay in the dark during the early 
morning and remain outdoors or in intense 
light in the early evening to delay the circadian 
rhythm.6,31 Sleep time should be advanced by 
3 hours every 2 days until the desired time is 
achieved.6

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
The pharmacological approach targets the mela-
tonin receptors via a melatonin receptor agonist. 
Administration of supraphysiologic doses of mela-
tonin agonists during specific time interval has 
been shown to phase shift the circadian clock 
and potentially promote sleep.6,31 Although ramel-
teon (8 mg/d 30 minutes before going to bed 
and without food), and tasimelteon (20 mg/d just 
before going to bed also without food), can be 
used in the United States currently, only tasimel-
teon is approved for treating a CRSWD, namely, 
non–24 hour sleep–wake disorder.2,6,31 In addition, 
ramelteon is the only nonbenzodiazepine receptor 
agonist approved by the FDA to treat sleep- onset 
insomnia.6,31

Sleep-Related Movement 
Disorders

Sleep- related movement disorders include restless 
leg syndrome (RLS), PLMD, and REM sleep behavior 
disorder (RSBD).6

RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME
Definition
RLS is a neurological sensorimotor disorder that 
manifests as an uncomfortable, restless sensation 
that urges the leg(s) to move and usually happens 
at rest or at night.6,32

Epidemiology
Prevalence of RLS generally increases with age at 
a rate of 10% to 35% in patients < 65 years old. RLS 
is more common in females and is related to preg-
nancy, iron deficiency, uremia, neuropathies, and 
cardiovascular disease.33

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is clinical, including an overwhelming 
sensation of crawling, tingling, or pain that cause 
the limb to move to relieve the urge and the discom-
fort. It can be unilateral or bilateral.33,34 The more 
the disease progresses, the more likely it will involve 
the arms and sometimes the phantom limb, causing 
problems initiating sleep. Symptoms are worse 
during rest or at night and tend to subside during 
the daytime.33 Common comorbidities with RLS 
include depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder, and kidney dialysis.6,32

Nonpharmacological management
Nonpharmacological treatment with lifestyle 
changes and dietary modifications is usually helpful 
in controlling RLS.33,34 Medications such as antipsy-
chotics, antiemetics, antidepressants, beta- blockers, 
anticonvulsants, and lithium are known to exacer-
bate RLS and should be avoided.2,6,33 Dysfunction 
of the dopaminergic system and iron deficiency is 
thought to be involved in its pathogenesis.33

Dietary melatonin has not been evaluated or 
approved by the FDA to prevent or treat any 
disease or condition.6,31 Its evidence includes 
limited efficacy and safety data, secondary to 
limited FDA regulation and substantial variability 
in potency, purity, and safety between available 
dietary supplements.6,31

The American Academy of Neurology recommends 
ferrous fumarate supplementation with vitamin C in 
patients with RLS and serum ferritin of < 75 mcg/L 
and IV iron replacement if severe symptoms are 
present.6,33 Workup for the causes of iron deficiency 
should be initiated, and commonly associated 
diseases like neuropathies, cardiovascular disease, 

THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL | 127

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older Adultshypertension, depression, and diabetes should be 
ruled out.6,10

Pharmacological management
Pharmacological treatment: non–ergot- based dopa-
mine agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole, and rotig-
otine) are the first- line treatments of primary RLS 
and have high levels of evidence for efficacy and 
safety.6,10 Second- line treatments include the dopa-
mine precursors (levodopa) and ergot- based dopa-
mine agonists (eg, cabergoline).6,10

PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENT DISORDER
Definition
PLMD is defined as periodic episodes of sleep- 
related phenomena that are characterized by invol-
untary repetitive, stereotypical movements of the 
limbs.2,35

Epidemiology
The prevalence of PLMD is up to 80% in patients 
with RLS and up to 4% to 11% in the older adult 
population. The prevalence of both conditions 
increases as the patient ages.35,36

Caffeine- containing products should also be 
avoided. Treating underlying diseases like iron defi-
ciency anemia in cases associated with RLS is also 
helpful.35

Pharmacological management
Dopaminergic medications used to treat RLS, 
such as pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, and 
other drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin, will 
reduce the periodic limb movements in patients 
with PLMD.36 Based on a few small studies, 
clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime, melatonin 3 mg 30 
minutes before bedtime, and valproate 150–600 
mg at bedtime may improve sleep quality.35,36

REM SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER
Definition
In RSBD, the loss of muscle atonia usually 
happens during normal REM sleep. It commonly 
results from dysfunction of the brain stem 
circuits responsible for maintaining normal REM 
sleep atonia and suppressing behaviors during 
REM sleep.6 Such abnormal behaviors happening 
during REM sleep may cause injury or sleep 
disruption.

Diagnosis
Repeated jerky leg movement mimics the Babinski 
sign (extension of the big toe, dorsiflexion of toes 
and ankle, and often flexion of the knee and hip).35,36 
In addition, PLMD is associated with a high cardio-
vascular and cerebrovascular risk as they represent 
the motor manifestation of an increased sympa-
thetic overactivity, which causes nocturnal elevated 
blood pressure and heart rate. PLMD also can be 
seen without comorbid sleep or medical disorders. 
Patients often have a non- rested sleep and daytime 
fatigue.35

PLMD is commonly associated with other sleep 
disorders and other medical conditions, including 
congestive heart failure, diabetes, hepatic and renal 
disease, migraine, alcohol dependence, and several 
neurologic and psychiatric disorders.35,36 Some 
medications can trigger PLMD, including antidepres-
sants and lithium.35

Nonpharmacological management
Nonpharmacological treatment aims to avoid 
certain medications that may aggravate PLMD, 
including antidepressants like mirtazapine, venla-
faxine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and amitriptyline.6,35 

128  | THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL

Epidemiology
The prevalence of RSBD is relatively low, with a 
rate of ~0.5% in the general population and up 
to 5% to 7% in the elderly population. More than 
70% of patients with RSBD will develop a neuro-
degenerative disease within 12 years of their 
diagnosis.6,34

Diagnosis
The clinical diagnosis includes extreme motor 
behaviors like talking, kicking, biting, and 
punching in response to violent dreams. It often 
happens with intense emotional stress or during 
withdrawal from sedatives or alcohol, but it can 
also occur in healthy individuals. In addition, 
the eyes remain closed, and the forceful move-
ment stays in the surrounding environment.6,34 
It is essential to ask patients to rate their sleep 
quality, helping physicians to triage and diag-
nose untreated RSBD earlier. Polysomnography 
showing a loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia 
during REM sleep is required for diagnosis.37

Idiopathic RSBD is linked to neurodegenerative 
disorders (eg, Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body 
dementia, multiple system atrophy). It is often an 

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older Adultsearly manifestation of neurodegeneration occurring 
in the brain stem before spreading to other CNS 
regions.6,34

The average conversion time from idiopathic 
RSBD (iRSBD) to an underlying neurodegener-
ative disease that accumulates alpha- synuclein 
in the nerve cells, also called synucleinopathy, is 
4–9 years from iRSBD diagnosis and 11–16 years 
from symptom onset.38

Pharmacological management
Low- dose clonazepam (0.5–1 mg/d) is the preferred 
treatment for RSBD, given 30 minutes before 
bedtime, but with cautious use in patients with 
sleep apnea.37 Zopiclone is similar to clonazepam in 
treating RSBD symptoms, with a much shorter half- 
life.34,37 High- dose melatonin (3–15 mg) at bedtime 
(the median effective dose is 6 mg) is an alternative 
to clonazepam that is well tolerated and has fewer 
side effects compared to clonazepam.6,34

Approximately 33% to 46% of patients with Parkin-
son’s disease have RSBD.39 Risk factors for iRSBD 
include prior head injury, occupational farming, 
pesticide exposure, low education level, smoking, 
ischemic heart disease, and inhaled corticosteroid 
use.38 Patients with Parkinson’s disease and RSBD 
have been shown to have poorer cognitive perfor-
mance, as they are more likely to be diagnosed 
with mild cognitive impairment and subjective 
cognitive decline.39 In longitudinal studies, Parkin-
son’s disease is associated with worsening sleep 
maintenance throughout the illness.40 In addition, 
patients with Parkinson’s disease with insomnia 
often also have more severe depression, worse 
balance problems, and gait deficiencies.40 There-
fore, there is an increased risk of conversion to 
neurodegenerative disease in patients ≥ 50 years 
old with mild cognitive impairment signs and sleep 
dysregulation.38 For any patient with these risk 
factors, a healthy lifestyle focusing on smoking 
cessation and alcohol abstinence is recommended. 
In addition, treatment of comorbidities, such as 
hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, and depression can 
also be helpful.38

Unfortunately, there is currently insufficient 
evidence to support the pharmacological treat-
ment of these patients, and more research is 
needed.38

Nonpharmacological management
Nonpharmacological treatment focuses on environ-
mental modification to prevent harm and injuries.6,37 
Bed alarms, sitters, treating underlying causes, and 
discontinuing medications that exacerbate RSBD, 
like antidepressants, are the mainstay modali-
ties.6,34 Offending medications include selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepres-
sants, monoamine- oxidase inhibitors, beta- blockers 
(atenolol, bisoprolol), tramadol, and cholinesterase 
inhibitors.6,34

Dopaminergic agonists like pramipexole (0.1–0.5 
mg) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastig-
mine) may be considered as second- line agents in 
treatment- refractory patients.6,34

Sleep-Breathing Disorders

DEFINITION
SBDs comprise a group of conditions that include 
OSA, primary or secondary central sleep apnea 
(CSA), nonobstructive hypoventilation, hypoxemia 
disorders secondary to pulmonary parenchymal, 
and vascular.4 In addition, neuromuscular or chest 
wall disorders, periodic high- altitude breathing, and 
Cheyne–Stokes respiration can be causes of SBDs.6

EPIDEMIOLOGY
SBD prevalence is up to 34% in 30- to 70- year- old 
men, 17% in 30- to 70- year- old females, and 23.9% in 
65- to 100- year- old patients overall.6

DIAGNOSIS
In OSA, the most common SBD, sleep arousal and 
arterial hypoxia happen due to intermittent partial 
or complete closure of upper airways, resulting 
in respiratory cessation for 20–30 seconds after 
a brief gasping. Apnea is a complete cessation of 
breathing, while hypopnea is a reduction in the 
airflow by 30% with ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation.6,10

The apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) is the total 
number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour 
of sleep. An AHI of > 5 is required to diagnose an 
SBD.6,10 CSA presents as cessation of breathing ≥ 5 
times during sleep due to loss of ventilatory drive. 
Patients usually have wide neck circumference, high 
body mass index, low soft palate, large tongue, 
uvula, and tonsils.10

OSA is caused by periodic narrowing or obstruc-
tion of the pharyngeal airway during sleep due to 
anatomical (structural) or neuromuscular (nonstruc-
tural) elements. Pharyngeal structures such as 

THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL | 129

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older Adultsenlarged adenoids, enlarged tonsils, relaxed tongue, 
abnormal lower jaw position, and fatty tissue 
surrounding the pharynx can adversely affect airway 
diameter and contribute to airway blockage or 
collapse.41

flat against the roof of your mouth for several 
seconds.”44 The worsened ability of the tongue to 
perform specific movements, also known as praxia 
lingual, is associated with an increased risk of SBD 
and appears to have an early onset in life.44

A neuromuscular response stimulates the dilator 
muscles in the pharynx to prevent airway obstruc-
tion. The genioglossus muscle is the biggest dilator 
of the upper airway. Its anatomy includes slow- 
twitch (type I) and fast- twitch (type II) muscle 
fibers. Type I fibers produce energy aerobically 
and are essential to sustain prolonged duration 
endurance activity. The type II fibers, however, are 
involved in short, powerful activity.41

In patients with OSA, the genioglossus muscle has 
been found to have a more notable proportion of 
fast- twitch muscle fibers and a reduced propor-
tion of slow- twitch muscle fibers, causing a loss of 
muscle tone as a person enters sleep.41

Untreated OSA can be a leading cause of cardio-
vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, 
stroke, and atrial fibrillation.10 CSA is commonly seen 
in congestive heart failure. Its presence increases 
mortality in patients with heart failure. It is also seen 
in healthy individuals with central neural lesions and 
at high altitudes.42

OSA must be addressed and treated due to its asso-
ciation with underlying vascular disease, particularly 
in the older adult population. Myocardial infarction 
and stroke occur at higher rates in patients with 
OSA and both are leading causes of death in the 
elderly.20,43 In addition, OSA increases the risk of 
cardiovascular disease through intermittent hypoxia 
and hypercapnia, inflammation, and activation of 
the sympathetic nervous system.20,43 A decade- long 
cohort study found that hypoxia with SpO2 < 90% 
in patients with OSA was the single most significant 
factor in cardiovascular events.43

Furthermore, anxiety and falling asleep are usually 
associated with an untreated SBD, not primarily 
because of a high body mass index but, rather, 
due to the ability or not to breathe easily through 
the nose during the day and night (tongue up in a 
resting position on the roof of the mouth). Conse-
quently, evaluating a weak tongue or tongue tie in 
patients with suspected SBD is fundamental.44

Most health care professionals use the “stick your 
tongue out” test. However, the better test is “can 
you open your mouth wide and hold your tongue 

130  | THE PERMANENTE JOURNAL

NONPHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
In mild- to- moderate SBD, AHI 5–15, positional 
therapy (sleep on the lateral side instead of in the 
supine position), an oral appliance, and weight loss 
are recommended.4,10 Smoking cessation, avoiding 
alcohol and caffeine, and managing comorbidities 
are strongly recommended. In moderate- to- severe 
SBD, AHI > 15, a positive airway pressure device 
is the gold standard therapy; continuous positive 
airway pressure is preferred.6,10 Bilevel positive 
airway pressure should be used if continuous posi-
tive airway pressure is not tolerated or the positive 
airway pressure pressure needed is < 20 cmH2O. 
Weight loss and positional therapy should be used. 
Sedatives and hypnotics should be avoided in 
patients with SBD.6,10

When the SBD originates from a weak tongue, a 
device called eXciteOSA can be used.

The eXciteOSA is a rechargeable mouthpiece, 
recently approved by the FDA, which fits on the 
tongue and delivers neuromuscular electrical stimu-
lation to the genioglossus muscle to increase muscle 
endurance to promote airway patency.41

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Stimulants may be used if daytime sleepiness 
persists even with positive airway pressure.6,42 
Optimizing heart failure therapy may improve CSA. 
Nocturnal oxygen supplementation and theophylline 
have been shown to decrease the severity of CSA.42

Conclusion

Sleep disorders in the elderly are a common but 
underdiagnosed condition.3 Most health care 
professionals do not know what to recommend 
for patients with sleep disorders and usually 
avoid discussing this, which is why SBDs often go 
untreated for ~3–8 years before diagnosis.45 There-
fore, the effects on sleep from age- related physi-
ological changes and possible adverse effects of 
medications, medical conditions, and mental health 
disorders should be considered in older adults.3

In this article, the authors discussed differen-
tial diagnosis, clinical diagnosis, how to provide 

Common Sleep Disorders Affecting Older Adultscomprehensive sleep hygiene education, and the 
different nonpharmacological and possible options 
for pharmacological treatment. In addition, compre-
hensive assessment and appropriate management 
of sleep disorders, including associated comorbid-
ities, may prevent cognitive decline and improve 
the quality of care and health care outcomes in the 
older adult population.
