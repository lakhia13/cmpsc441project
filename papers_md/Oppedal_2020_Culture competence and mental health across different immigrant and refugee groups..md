Abstract

Background: Over the last decades, due to high rates of immigration, many high-income countries have witnessed
demographic shifts towards more cultural diversity in the population. Socio-economic deprivation and traumatic
experiences pre-migration contribute to a high risk for mental health problems among immigrant background
youth. Moreover, when adapting to the multi-cultural contexts of the resettlement countries they face several
acculturation demands, which may also affect their mental health in adaptive or hazardous ways. One of these
acculturation tasks involves developing the cultural competence necessary to thrive and participate socially within
the heritage and the majority cultural domains. From a public mental health perspective, it is important to have
thorough knowledge about acculturation-related risk and protective factors. However, this responsibility has been
challenged by a lack of acculturation measures that are theoretically linked to mental health, and target the cultural
competencies of immigrant background youth. Therefore, the current study aimed at examining if a construct of
peer-related culture competence, operationalized in the Youth Culture Competence Scale (YCCS), captured the
same competence-phenomenon across different language, age, and immigrant groups in two immigrant-receiving
countries. The scale includes two dimensions: one of heritage, and one of majority peer-related culture
competence.
Methods: Self-report questionnaire data were collected from 895 unaccompanied refugees and 591 immigrant
background high school students in Norway, and from 321 immigrant university students in the United States. To
examine if the measure assessed the same phenomenon of peer-related culture competence across these three
multi-ethnic samples with an age range from 13 to 28, we examined its measurement equivalence. Additionally, we
examined if the association between peer-related culture competence and depressive symptoms was similar in
these groups.
Results: Confirmatory factor analyses supported the proposed two factor structure of the YCCS across the three
samples. The structural equation model assessing the effects of heritage and majority culture competence on
depressive symptoms confirmed that each culture competence dimension had a unique association with
depressive symptoms across the samples.

Conclusions: We conclude that the YCCS is a robust acculturation measure that may be included in public health
studies of mental health among multi-ethnic refugee and immigrant samples of varied ages.

Background
Acculturation is a commonly used term in scholarly dis-
cussions concerning the adaptation of immigrant and eth-
nic minority populations. Even if the meaning assigned to
the concept differs, most researchers today agree that ac-
culturation is a two-dimensional process that should be
addressed both in relation to the heritage and the majority
cultures [1, 2]. Acculturation involves a variety of individ-
ual, social, and contextual factors that may strengthen or
weaken the immigrants’ mental well-being. From a public
health perspective, it is therefore important to have thor-
ough knowledge about acculturation-related risk and pro-
tective factors of mental health. A frequently researched
acculturation specific risk factor is being discriminated
against because of your ethnic or cultural background [3,
4]. However, less attention has been paid to acculturation
specific protective factors in public health research. One
reason for this may be the scarcity of acculturation mea-
sures that target the resources of immigrant background
youth, and that are theoretically linked to mental health.

A major acculturation demand facing immigrant back-
ground children is to develop the cultural competence ne-
cessary to thrive and succeed within both the heritage and
the majority cultural domains [5].. The Youth Culture
Competence Scale (YCCS; Appendix) was developed to
examine levels of such competence. As perceived compe-
tence in various domains, is a valid protective factor of
children and adolescents’ mental health [6, 7], the YCCS
responds to the public health sector’s need for a youth
measure that is theoretically linked to mental health out-
comes, and that reflects acculturation strengths. The YCCS
has been employed in studies of immigrant background
adolescents in Norway, and demonstrated good reliability
and convergent validity in relation to depression, social
support and discrimination [8–11]. However, the potential
of the scale to capture the same competence phenomenon
across countries, languages, age groups and voluntary and
forced migrant groups, has not been assessed. Such infor-
mation can add to the validity and usefulness of the scale.
Therefore, the current study aimed at examining if a con-
struct of peer-related culture competence, operationalized
in the Youth Culture Competence Scale (YCCS), captured
the same competence-phenomenon across different lan-
guage, age, and immigrant groups in two immigrant-
receiving countries. To do this, we first examined the

factor structure of the YCCS in three different samples of
youth in Norway and the United States to capture the cul-
ture competence phenomenon in detail. Next, we investi-
gated the association between culture competence and
depressive symptoms
in these different acculturation
contexts.

The phenomenon of culture competence
The YCCS derives from an acculturation developmental
psychological framework [5, 12], rather than from Ber-
ry’s model of acculturation strategies [13] to better rep-
resent the experiences of developing youths in multi-
cultural contexts.

Within this framework, culture competence refers to
knowledge and skills about verbal and non-verbal com-
munication and interpersonal behavior patterns, and the
values underlying these, which children develop through
interaction in socio-cultural settings of both the heritage
and majority culture [5, 14]. Culture competence in-
volves both learning and maturation processes related to
children’s inborn unique capacity to adapt to a variety of
social and cultural circumstances,
including bi- and
multicultural contexts. By mentally switching between
different cultural codes (scripts or schemas) they accom-
modate their behaviors to the demands of the context
[5, 15, 16]. For children, culture competence is a neces-
sary condition to succeed within and acquire a sense of
belongingness to the two (or more) major cultural do-
mains that constitute their developmental ecology.

The knowledge and skills involved in being culturally
competent vary throughout
the life span and socio-
cultural domains, such as public and private domains
the majority culture competence
[17]. For example,
(MCC) needed to participate in sports activities differs
from what is needed in educational settings. Likewise,
the heritage culture competence (HCC) needed to inter-
act with family members and co-ethnic friends is also
different. Moreover, the demands for MCC and HCC in
interaction with friends during early and late adoles-
cence is more complex and developmentally advanced
than during the pre-school years.

It should be noted that both the definition and aim of
culture competence as employed within acculturation de-
velopmental psychology differs from the use of the con-
cept within the corporate business and health service

Oppedal et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:292

fields. Within international business organizations culture
competence describes phenomena that enable systems
and professionals to work effectively in unfamiliar cross-
cultural settings [18, 19]. Within health care systems the
concept indicates effectively delivered health care services
that meet the social, cultural, and linguistic needs of pa-
tients [20, 21].

Measures of acculturation
There is an abundance of acculturation measures available
for research, many of them thoroughly discussed by Cel-
enk and Van de Vijver [2], Chirkov [22], and Rudmin [23].
They all advocate a two-dimensional theoretical perspec-
tives on acculturation, i.e. assessing the individuals’ con-
nection with both their heritage and the majority socio-
cultural domains. A majority of acculturation measuring
tools originated in the frequently used definition of accul-
turation as psychological changes that occur when people
with different cultural background come into contact with
each other [13, 24]. To assess such changes, these mea-
sures typically target preferences, behaviors, and activities
regarding food, music, media, values, friends, and language
related either to the heritage or to the majority cultural
domains (for an overview and description of publicly avail-
able measures, see Celenk and Van de Vijver [2] and
http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/ccis). When these mea-
sures are employed in research as predictors of mental
health outcomes, the underlying assumption is that mod-
erate to strong preference for both cultures, i.e. being bi-
cultural, is associated with more positive mental health
[13, 25–28].

From a mental health perspective, it may be argued
that cultural preferences, attitudes, or strategies regard-
ing e.g.
food, music, media, values, or ethnicity of
friends, which are typical indicators in measures of ac-
culturation status, do not assess concepts with theoret-
ical or empirical relevance as risk or protective factors of
mental health. Cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal
theories and research of depression and PTSD have
shown that negative life events, loss, interpersonal prob-
lems, daily hassles, and traumatic exposure are major
risk factors, while social support, coping, belongingness,
and self-efficacy are consistent protective factors [29–
37]. As can be seen, these concepts have not informed
traditional acculturation measures. Thus,
it is unclear
how a strong preference for heritage and majority cul-
ture, as assessed by such acculturation indicators, relates
to mental health. Measures that are solely rooted in the-
ories of acculturation may not capture core aspects of
the acculturation context that may increase, or protect
against, the risk for mental health problems. Thus, they
may be of limited value for research aiming at designing
public health policies and practices to improve the men-
immigrant background youth. For this
tal health of

purpose, we need an assessment tool that combines the-
ories of acculturation with research based knowledge
about risks and resources in the development of mental
health problems and disorders. It is particularly valuable
to identify resources, such as culture competence, that
may support youth from immigrant background in
handling the variety of life stressors that they are ex-
posed to, that can be targeted in interventions to foster
their resilience and positive psychological adaptation.

The youth culture competence scale (YCCS)
Based on these considerations of the potential theoret-
ical limitations of the existing measures, the YCCS was
developed to respond to the need, from a public health
perspective, for an acculturation measure that targeted
children’s cultural resources, and that had conceptual
links as a protective factor to depression and other indi-
ces of mental health [38, 39]. Efficacy beliefs about one’s
own competence, plays a particularly influential role in
human health and well-being both in terms of reducing
physical stress-reactions and to facilitate the motivation
and perseverance needed for success [40]. According to
social-cognitive theory, self-perceived competence and
efficacy are associated with self-regulatory processes, and
thereby with lower levels of depressive and anxiety
symptoms [6, 7, 41]. In particular, perceiving oneself to
be competent in tasks that are highly valued and person-
ally significant is strongly linked to individuals’ mental
well-being, developmental psychopathology and resili-
ence [6, 42–47]. Research has shown that competence is
an important psychological construct in a variety of cul-
tures [48].

For individuals of immigrant or refugee backgrounds, a
major developmental task is the acquisition of cultural
competence in the receiving-culture (MCC) and retention
and further development of the heritage-culture compe-
tence (HCC). In line with two-dimensional models of ac-
culturation, [2] the YCCS assesses these two dimensions
independently. The knowledge and skills involved in being
culturally competent vary throughout the life span, across
socio-cultural domains, and across public and private do-
mains [17]. For children and youth, culture competence in
peer relationships is particularly important [49]. However,
the demands for MCC and HCC in interaction with
friends during early and late adolescence is more complex
and advanced than during the pre-school years [50]. The
YCCS was developed to capture the culture competence
that is salient to relationships with friends during lower
and upper secondary school years (ages 12 to 18 years).

Preliminary analyses of YCCS has confirmed its two la-
tent factor structure in a multi-ethnic sample of 660 im-
migrant youths in Norway [51]. However, to use the scale
with other samples, and in other immigrant receiving
countries, we need information about its potential to

Oppedal et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:292

capture the same competence-phenomenon across groups
and context.

Method
Aims
The overall aim of the current study is to examine the po-
tential of a construct of peer-related culture competence,
to capture the same
operationalized in the YCCS,
phenomenon across different language-, age-, and immi-
grant groups in two immigrant-receiving countries. Im-
portantly, by including young adult participants with age
ranges from 18 to 28 years, we simultaneously assess the
phenomenon of peer-related MCC and HCC in older age
groups. We first examined the factor structure of the
YCCS in three different samples of youth in Norway and
the United States to capture the culture competence
phenomenon in detail. Next, we investigated potential
variation in the association between culture competence
and depressive symptoms in these different acculturation
groups and contexts.

Participants
Cross-sectional data were collected from three multi-
ethnic samples in the United States and Norway that
comprised a total of 1807 participant. Table 1 displays
the demographic characteristics for the overall sample
and each subsample. The U.S. sample comprised first-
generation immigrant students attending a university in
the mid-Atlantic region. The Norwegian participants in-
cluded one sample of unaccompanied minor refugees,
and one sample of high school students with immigrant
background. They all participated in The Youth, Culture
and Competence Study, YCC, which had been approved
by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Re-
search Ethics and by the Norwegian Data Inspectorate,
and participation was condition on written consent. For
high school students and unaccompanied refugee youth
younger than 16 years, additional consent to participate
in the study was collected from their parents or legal
guardians respectively.

The U.S. university student sample
The sample comprised 321 participants (Mage = 20.89
years old; SDage = 2.23; 68.50% females) of a mid-sized
state university. Students who were: (a) less than 28 years
old, and (b) born outside of the United States were in-
cluded in the study. Participants were predominantly ju-
niors (34%), followed by 26% seniors, 23% freshmen, and
17% sophomores. Sixty-two percent of the participants
were born in Asia, 20% were born in Africa, the rest
originated from South America, Europe, and Australia.
Participants had been in the U.S. for an average of 10.41
years (SD = 6.07).

The Norwegian unaccompanied refugee sample
The data were collected as part of a population-
based study among youths who arrived in Norway as
unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers. For detailed
information about the recruitment process, see [52].
As they had received protection and consequently
were no longer asylum-seekers at the time of data
collection, and some of them were above the age of
18, we refer to them as unaccompanied refugees.
Based on available funding and to secure demo-
graphic and socio-economic variation we targeted
youth resettled in 41 municipalities nationwide, n =
1209, of which 948 youths agreed to participate,
yielding a response rate of 78%. Thirty participants
(3.2%) had missing values on most of the questions,
and were therefore excluded, yielding a final sample
of n = 918 (Mage = 18.62; SDage = 2.63). The majority
(82.1%) was male, mirroring the fact that most un-
accompanied minor asylum-seekers and refugees, are
boys. Their average length of stay since arrival
in
Norway at the time of the data collection was 3.42
years (SD = 2.27). Participants originated from a total
of 33 different countries, mainly Afghanistan (50.8%),
Somalia (12.1%), Iraq (7.1%) and Sri Lanka (6.4%).

The Norwegian high school sample
The sample involved 591 students with two immigrant
parents with background from a Non-Western country,
attending four high schools in the Norwegian capital
(Mage = 16.75; SDage = 1.47, 42.6% male). About half the
participants (57.3%) were born in Norway. The average
length of stay for the foreign-born students was 11.61
(SD = 5.17) years. The ethnic minority sample originated
from more than 40 different countries. The largest
groups, comprising in total 66.9% of the sample, had ori-
gins from Somalia, Pakistan, Iraq, Morocco, Sri Lanka,
Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey.

Procedure
The U.S. university student sample
Students were invited to participate in the study from so-
licitations made through their courses and posting of
flyers throughout campus, as approved by the university
institutional review board. Interested students were pro-
vided a link to complete an online survey hosted by Survey
Monkey (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The website
allowed students to provide electronic consent, and stu-
dents were able to withdraw at any point without any pen-
alty. Upon completion of
the survey, which took
approximately 45 min for the full battery of measures, stu-
dents were prompted to submit their names to a separate
email account to earn extra credit in their courses (if eli-
gible) or be entered into a drawing for cash prizes. The in-
formation provided by students on the survey and their

The Norwegian unaccompanied refugee sample
The data collection was carried out in small groups in a
local community setting familiar to the youth, such as
group homes or libraries. Research assistants who were
trained to use questionnaire methodology in small
groups administered the self-report questionnaires in

Norwegian. A protocol with standardized explanations
of difficult concepts and English translation of questions
were available to them. Only 15% accepted the offer to
use translators who could read the questions to them in
their mother tongue.

The Norwegian high school sample
Subsequent to the high school principals’ and adminis-
tration’s approval of the project, researchers from the

Oppedal et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:292

YCC informed members of the high school student
council during one of their meetings about the aims and
procedures of the project. Each of the council members
was given written information with invitation letters in-
cluding a consent form to present to their classmates in
their respective classrooms. Students who consented to
participate (about 85%) responded to electronic ques-
tionnaires during two regular school classes. Research
assistants trained by the YCC research team were
present in the classroom during data collection to assist
the students who needed help. Non-participation was
mostly due to students not being present in school on
the day of data collection.

Measures
The YCCS includes nine items each for assessing the
majority and the heritage culture competence separ-
ately (Oppedal & Idsoe, 2015; Oppedal & Toppelberg,
2016). Each dimension includes questions about lan-
guage and culturally embedded patterns of behaviors.
For the purpose of the present validation study, the
scale was translated into English by standard back-
translation procedures.

Both higher-order MCC and HCC included: 1) one
first-order language competence factor with two items,
such as “How easy is it for you to speak Norwegian/Eng-
lish?” and “How easy is it for you to write in your
mother tongue?”, respectively; 2) one first-order behav-
ioral competence factor: seven items about understand-
ing culturally embedded patterns of behavior and
interaction. Sample items for the behavioral dimension
of the MCC and the HCC included “How easy is it for
you to hang out with [Norwegian/European American]
peers?” and “How easy is it for you to know how to be-
have when visiting friends and families from your cul-
ture?”, respectively. Response alternatives varied from 1
- very difficult to 4-very easy. Cronbach’s alphas in the
current study varied from .80–.93 across groups.

Depressive symptoms were measured by the 20-item
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for
adolescents (CES-D; Radloff, 1979). CES-D asks for the
frequency of symptoms over the last week and includes
dimensions of depressed affect (7 items), lack of positive
affect (4 items), somatic activity (7 items), and interper-
sonal problems (2 items). Response categories range
from 0 (rarely/never) to 3 (most of the time/all the time).
A previous confirmatory factor analysis supported the
use of the four dimensions across gender and various
cultural groups among unaccompanied refugees as well
as ethnic minority and majority youth in Norway [53].
Cronbach’s alphas in the current study varied from
.86–.91 across groups.

To examine correlations among all variables, we cal-
culated a mean sum score for each culture competence

dimension ranging from 1 (perceived low culture com-
petence) to 4 (perceived high culture competence). In ac-
cordance with directions regarding the CES-D (Radloff,
1979) we calculated a sum score for symptoms of de-
pression ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (high
number and frequent symptoms). Based on findings
from previous research on unaccompanied refugees
[52, 54], while testing the models we controlled for gen-
der, age, and length of stay in the respective countries.

Statistical analyses
Conventional analyses were carried out in SPSS version
23. We used Mplus 7 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012) to exam-
ine the invariance in the factor structure of the YCCS and
the association between culture competence and depres-
sive symptoms. The robust maximum likelihood (ML) es-
the full-information maximum
timator, which uses
likelihood method (FIML), was preferred to accommodate
non-normal item distributions and missing data.

Data analyses were conducted in three stages. We first
tested the proposed two higher-order factor structure of
the YCCS separately for the three samples by means of
confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). In evaluating the
models, several
fit indices were consulted: the root-
mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the
comparative fit index (CFI). West et al. (2012) suggest
that CFI > .95 and RMSEA < .05 represent a well-fitting
model. They also further suggest that CFI > .90 and
RMSEA < .08 represent an adequately fitting model
(West, Taylor, & Wu, 2012).

Second, we performed multi-group comparisons to
find the extent to which the CFA model of culture com-
petence exhibited measurement invariance across three
groups. In that stage, measurement invariance across
groups was tested by comparing models with: a) all pa-
rameters allowed to vary freely across groups, configural
model; b) factor loadings constrained to be equal across
groups, metric model; c) both factor loadings and inter-
cepts constrained to be equal, scalar model
(Little,
2013). Nested model comparisons were conducted using
an adjusted χ2 difference test due to the use of the ro-
bust ML estimator (Satorra & Bentler, 2001). However,
since significance testing of Δχ2 would not be optimal
due to the large sample size, we also followed the rec-
ommendation that differences in CFI values between
should not exceed .01 (Cheung &
nested models
Rensvold, 2002; Little, 2013).

In the third stage, we assessed the unique effects of
the HCC and the MCC on depressive symptoms. For
this purpose, we tested a structural model across the
three groups as well as for the overall sample. We also
examined whether the three groups differed significantly
in the effects of the two higher-order culture compe-
tence factors on depressive symptoms by testing whether

Oppedal et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:292 

Page 7 of 13

a constrained model (equal paths) did not produce sig-
nificantly worse model fit than an unconstrained (free
paths) model (Satorra, 2000).

Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents demographic information for each sam-
ple, and means and standard deviations of the measures
based on raw scores. The Norwegian high school sample
was on average the youngest. However, as about 40%
was born in Norway (2nd generation) they had on aver-
age the longest residence, as both the Norwegian un-
accompanied refugee and the U.S. university samples
only comprised 1st generation youth.

Table 2 shows the correlations among all the constructs.
There was a small, but significant, positive correlation be-
tween MCC and HCC. Furthermore, MCC, but not HCC,
correlated significantly with age and length of stay.

The measurement model
The model fit statistics for each group and for the tests
of measurement invariance across groups are shown in
Table 3. In order to confirm the fit of the proposed two
higher-order latent factors model, we initially conducted
CFA separately for each group.1 The two higher-order
latent factor model yielded acceptable fit to the data in
all three samples (Table 3).

Subsequently, we tested the invariance of the measure-
ment model across the three groups. First, the reported
fit indices of a configural model in which all parameters
were allowed to vary across groups, suggested an ad-
equate fit of the two higher-order latent factor model of
culture competence (see Table 3). Second, the reported
fit indices of the metric invariance model in which we
examined the equality of the unstandardized factor load-
ings across groups, also suggested an adequate fit. The
CFI values differed by less than 0.01 between these two
models (ΔCFI = .005), suggesting a full metric invariance
implying that the indicators were related to the latent
factor equivalently across the three groups. This suggests
that the same latent factors were measured in each of
the three groups. Third, the scalar invariance model in-
volved examining the equality of the unstandardized in-
dicator intercepts across groups. This invariance model
showed poorer fit to the data (Table 3) and significantly
worse than the metric invariance model (Δχ2

than the full metric invariance model (ΔCFI = .008).

Association between MCC-HCC and depressive symptoms
In order to examine the association between culture compe-
tence and depressive symptoms, we first tested a structural
model in which the two higher-order MCC and HCC latent
factors uniquely predicted symptoms of depression in the
total sample. The structural model provided adequate fit to
the data (χ2
762 = 2479.99, p < .001, RMSEA = .036, 95%CI
[0.034, 0.038], CFI = .919), and showed that higher levels of
MCC and HCC predicted lower levels of depressive symp-
toms (Fig. 2). The subsequent multi-group structural model
in which all parameters were allowed to vary across groups
(free structural model) also yielded an adequate fit to the
data, χ2
2340 = 4360.25, p < .001, RMSEA = .039, 90% CI
[0.037, 0.040], CFI = .904. From Table 4 it can be seen that
the standardized beta coefficients from the two higher-
order culture competence factors to depressive symptoms
varied in size among the three subsample.

We therefore examined whether the size of the effects of
the MCC or the HCC on depressive symptoms were sig-
nificantly different across the three groups by running two
constrained structural models. Neither the first model in
which the path from the MCC to depressive symptoms
was constrained across groups, nor the second model in
which the path from the HCC to depressive symptoms
was constrained across groups, differed significantly from
the free model
2 = 3.83,
p = .147, respectively). Thus, the effects of MCC and HCC
on depressive symptoms were also invariant across groups.

Discussion
This study examined if a construct of peer-related culture
competence, operationalized in the Youth Culture Com-
petence Scale (YCCS), captured the same competence-

phenomenon across
background groups of different ethnicities, languages and

jority peer-related culture competence. We approached
the goal by first examining and comparing the factor
structure of the scale among the three groups. Next we in-
vestigated the association between MCC and HCC re-
spectively, and depressive symptoms, in the three different
samples of refugee and immigrant background youth of

ferred because it was more parsimonious than the metric
model, there was variation in the intercept of the means of
the latent behavioral factors of MCC and HCC. This find-
ing implies differences among the groups in the level of cul-
ture competence, which was expected. The acquisition and
maintenance of culture competence is affected by a series
of individual and environmental variables such as length of
stay in the receiving country, attitudes towards maintaining
heritage culture, frequency of interaction with, and the sup-
portive quality of, social networks of either culture [9].

The presence of culturally competent role models and
productive feedback from significant others can also influ-
ence the development of culture competence [40]. Fur-
thermore, the level of competence of the comparison
group that is the basis for the youths’ self-evaluation may
inflate or deflate their perception of their own competence
[10, 55, 56].

The YCCS was primarily developed to be used with jun-
ior and senior high school students. The present valid-
ation study included participants beyond high school up
to 28 years of age, and our findings support the utility of
this scale in samples of young adults. Thus, based on the
established partial scalar invariance of the scale in the
present study, we conclude that the analyses support the
generalizability of the YCCS as a measure of cultural re-
sources to older age groups, in different migrant groups,
across different acculturation contexts [57, 58]. Future re-
search should extend on these findings and include immi-
grant groups in other receiving countries and non-
academic contexts.

Association of Culture Competence with depression
The final multi-group examination of a structural model
involving the effects from MCC and HCC on depression
symptoms supported previous findings, as both culture
competence dimensions had unique effects on depressive
symptoms [9, 59]. This is also in accordance with findings
from other studies, showing that biculturalism is generally
beneficial for the psychological adaptation of immigrants
[28]. There was no significant group-variation in the size
of the effects of MCC and HCC, which counters previous
research with other samples in which differences in the ef-
fect sizes of MCC and HCC on depressive symptoms were
found [10, 60, 61]. Notably, the Dalhaug et al. study (2011)
found that the effect of MCC was non-significant in a
school context involving 90% immigrant background stu-
dents, whereas the effect was significant in a context with
60% immigrant background students.

Theoretical formulations and empirical findings have
pointed out that competence of importance to the self,
and the capacity to exercise control over things one
values is critical to depression [6, 62]. Factors such as
age, developmental stage, contextual demands, ratio of
non-immigrant to immigrant background population in
the community, and comparison group can impact the
individuals’ perception of the relevance and value of
specific competencies [6, 42, 63, 64]. Future experimen-
research should seek to
tal and non-experimental
disentangle developmental,
individual and contextual
predictors of culture competence and its relation with
mental health indices. This may provide important in-
sights into how children and youth learn and develop
cultural resources they need to participate and adapt
successfully in acculturation contexts.

Limitations
Several limitations of the present study should be noted.
First, there is an imbalance in the number of items in
the verbal and non-verbal dimensions of the YCCS (i.e.,
two versus seven items). Including language competence
items within a broader range will likely increase individ-
ual and group differences in MCC and HCC, which will
contribute to improving the psychometric qualities of
the measure. However, short scales are of value in psy-
chological and health research, and the current version
of the YCCS generally demonstrate good psychometric
properties, and can be recommended for use with rele-
vant populations.

Second, the information obtained was based on self-
reported questionnaire information only. A mixed-
methods approach to assessing cultural competence, in-
volving additional information from tests and observa-
tions based on standardized criteria, as well as reports
from friends, family, or teachers, could have added more
broad and objective information. However, it should be
noted that the individual’s own perceived competence
within a valued domain is of most importance to his or
her mental health [42].

The inclusion of, and comparison with a traditional ac-
culturation measures would have added strength to our
study. Unfortunately, this was not part of our research de-
sign. Comparison of variations in the associations with
mental health between various acculturation measures,
could be of value to better understand the complexities of
the link between acculturation and health among immi-
grant background youth.

Finally, although the present study supports the use of
the YCCS in acculturation contexts outside Norway and
in older age-groups, more languages and variation in ac-
culturation contexts are still needed to make final con-
clusions about the invariance and validity of this new
acculturation measure.

Conclusion
The results supported the importance of culture com-
petence in relation to mental health. Furthermore,
the YCCS captured a similar phenomenon of cultural
competence within the peer context in three samples
of refugee- and immigrant- background adolescents
and young adults with different ethnic heritage back-
grounds in Norway and the United States. The study
also corroborates the applicability of the YCCS as a
measure to assess competence relevant to youth men-
tal health throughout the high school years and into
young adulthood among university students. This im-
plies that the YCCS is a robust acculturation measure
that may be included in public health studies of men-
tal health among multi-ethnic refugee and immigrant
samples of varied ages.
