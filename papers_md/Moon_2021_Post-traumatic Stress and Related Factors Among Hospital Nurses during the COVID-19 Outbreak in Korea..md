Abstract
COVID-19  is  an  ongoing  worldwide  infectious  disease  pandemic.  The  purpose  of  this 
study  was  to  investigate  post-traumatic  stress  and  related  factors  among  hospital  nurses 
during the COVID-19 outbreak. The subjects of this study were 300 nurses who worked 
in three general hospitals that operated National Designated Isolation Unit (NDIU) wards 
during the COVID-19 outbreak. Self-reporting questionnaires were used to collect data on 
post-traumatic  stress,  general  characteristics,  and  work-related  information.  The  average 
post-traumatic stress score was 20.68 ± 19.5 points and 36.7% of participants were at high 
risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The odds ratio (OR) for PTSD was higher for 
nurses who worked in the NDIU ward (OR = 16.31, 95% CI = 3.79–70.32), who responded 
that nurse staffing was poor (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.01–9.10), and who responded that they 
experienced COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 3.83, 95% CI = 1.89–7.75). Total 36.7% of nurses 
were  at  risk  of  PTSD  and  the  factors  related  to  PTSD  were  the  work  department,  nurse 
staffing,  and  experiencing  COVID-19  symptoms.  These  results  could  be  used  to  manage 
PTSD  and  provide  psychological  support  of  nurses  during  infectious  disease  epidemics, 
such as COVID-19.

Introduction

COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 
that  has  been  occurring  worldwide,  including  Korea,  since  its  first  outbreak  in  Decem-
ber  2019  in  Wuhan,  China  [1].  As  of  January  2021,  the  cumulative  confirmed  cases  of

COVID-19 worldwide were more than 93 million with over 2 million deaths [2]. In Korea, 
the first confirmed case was reported on January 20, 2020, and gradually spread nationwide 
with more than 70,000 confirmed cases and ~ 1,300 deaths by January 2021 [3]. Although 
exact numbers have not been reported, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many deaths 
of health care workers, including nurses and doctors [4].

Previous  studies  reported  that  healthcare  workers  are  at  high  risk  of  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (PTSD)  due  to  new  infectious  diseases,  such  as  Sever  Acute  Respiratory 
Syndrome  (SARS)  [5].  At  two  months  post-SARS  outbreak,  the  prevalence  of  PTSD 
was ~ 20% and support from supervisors and colleagues associated negatively with PTSD 
in healthcare workers [6]. In addition to post-traumatic stress, healthcare workers experi-
enced high levels of distress, and nurses reported severe stress due to the SARS outbreak 
[7].  During  the  Middle  East  Respiratory  Syndrome  (MERS)  epidemic,  post-traumatic 
stress  among  nurses  associated  significantly  with  contact  with  suspected  and  confirmed 
MERS patients, work position, shift work [8], and support from supervisors [9].

During  the  recent  COVID-19  pandemic,  healthcare  workers  have  experienced  signifi-
cantly  higher  levels  of  post-traumatic  stress  (28.9%),  and  the  post-traumatic  stress  levels 
have been higher among healthcare workers who directly care for COVID-19 patients than 
among healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients indirectly [10]. The prevalence 
of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak 
has  been  high,  and  COVID-19-related  stress  and  psychological  factors  have  affected  the 
mental health of nurses [11]. Among the medical staff, nurses have reported more severe 
psychiatric symptoms and worse sleep quality [12].

The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  classified  COVID-19  as  a  pandemic,  and 
the  outbreak  has  been  ongoing  in  Korea  from  January  2020–January  2021.  Due  to  the 
nature of their work, nurses could not telework, cared for sick people, and remained anx-
ious that they may be infected with COVID-19. Therefore, we investigated the current sta-
tus of post-traumatic stress and related factors in nurses at COVID-19 treatment hospitals.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

The study population included nurses who worked at three hospitals, C University Hospital 
in  Gwangju,  W  University  Hospital,  and  G  Medical  Center  in  Jeollabukdo,  that  operate 
National  Designated  Isolation  Unit  wards  (NDIUs).  With  cooperation  from  the  Depart-
ment  of  Nursing,  nurses  who  worked  during  the  COVID-19  outbreak  were  sampled.  We 
excluded nurses who did not care for patients directly, such as nurses who worked on the 
quality  improvement  and  health  insurance  review  teams.  We  collected  data  using  self-
administered questionnaires and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The 
survey was conducted from September 3 to September 16, 2020, and a total of 300 nurses 
participated.

General Characteristics

General characteristics included sex (men, women), age (20–29, ≥ 30 years), marital status 
(single, married), children (no, yes), education level (college, university, graduate school), 
work period (< 5, ≥ 5 years), working position (staff nurse, charge/senior nurse), working

department  (NDIU,  general  ward,  intensive  care  unit,  other),  monthly  salary  (< 3  mil-
lion, ≥ 3 million Korean won), and living status (live alone, live together).

Work Environment during the COVID‑19 Outbreak

The  work  environment  included  perceived  level  of  ambient  noise  from  the  environment, 
such as patient monitoring devices, call bells, negative pressure machine (little, moderate, 
a lot), break time during work (< 30, ≥ 30 min), overtime work (< 30, ≥ 30 min), nursing 
workload (low, moderate, high), nurse staffing (poor, fair, good), adequate provision of per-
sonal protective equipment, such as dental mask, N95 mask, protective clothing (yes, no/
don’t  know),  frequency  of  changes  to  COVID-19  guidelines  (no/occasionally,  moderate, 
frequently), support from supervisors (low, moderate, high), and support from colleagues 
(low, moderate, high).

Covid‑19‑Related Characteristics

COVID-19-related  characteristics  included  presence  of  COVID-19  suspected  symptoms 
(no, yes), COVID-19 test performed (no, yes), self-isolation or isolation of family members 
(no, yes), subjective level of COVID-19 related knowledge (little, average, knowledgeable), 
education  of  new  infectious  diseases  (no,  yes),  and  nursing  care  for  suspected  and  con-
firmed COVID-19 patients (no, yes).

Among nurses who cared for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients, the data col-
lected included the number of times they wore protective clothing (0–10, ≥ 11 times), the 
amount of time per day protective clothing was worn (< 2, ≥ 2 h), the tightness of the pro-
tective  clothing  (little,  moderate,  a  lot),  the  number  of  critical  patients  they  cared  for  (0, 
1–2, ≥ 3), and whether they cared for patients who died (no, yes).

Post‑Traumatic Stress

Post-traumatic stress was assessed using the Korean version of the Impact of Event Scale-
Revised  (IES-R)  tool  [13].  The  tool  uses  a  five-point  Likert  scale  (0–4)  for  22  questions 
on hyperarousal (6 questions), avoidance (6 questions), intrusion (5 questions), and sleep 
&  numbness  (5  questions).  How  often  these  symptoms  appeared  during  the  COVID-19 
outbreak period were assessed; 0 points were allotted for "not at all" responses and 4 were 
allotted for "very much" responses, and the higher the score, the higher the post-traumatic 
stress. Out of a maximum of 88 points, individuals with scores of 24 points or less were 
designated to the normal group and individuals with scores of 25 points or more were des-
ignated to the PTSD group.

Analysis

Data  were  analyzed  using  the  statistical  program  SPSS  version  26.  The  general  charac-
teristics of the study population, work environment, and COVID-19-related characteristics 
were  presented  as  frequencies  and  percentages,  whereas  the  post-traumatic  stress  scores 
were  presented  as  mean ± standard  deviation.  The  chi-square  test  was  used  to  assess  the 
prevalence of PTSD based on general characteristics, work environment, and COVID-19

characteristics. To identify the factors associated with PTSD, we performed multiple logis-
tic regression analysis. p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

Results

The average post-traumatic stress score was 20.68 ± 19.50, and 36.7% of the nurses evalu-
ated  were  in  the  high-risk  of  PTSD  group  (scores ≥ 25  points).  The  prevalence  of  PTSD 
was 30.4% for nurses aged 20–29 years, 46.2% for nurses aged ≥ 30 years, 47.7% for nurses 
with children, and 33.6% for nurses without children. The prevalence of PTSD was 31.6% 
for nurses who worked < 5 years and 45.5% for nurses who worked > 5 years. The preva-
lence of PTSD was 63.3% for nurses who worked in the NDIU ward, 30.2% for nurses who 
worked in the general ward, 39.6% for nurses who worked in the intensive care unit, and 
21.1% for nurses who worked in other departments (Table 1).

Regarding the work environment, the prevalence of PTSD was 22.8% when there was 
little  noise  in  the  surrounding  environment,  35.8%  with  moderate  noise,  and  48.7%  with 
a  lot  of  noise.  The  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  20.0%  when  the  workload  was  low,  30.3%

when the workload was moderate, and 45.2% when the workload was high. The prevalence 
of  PTSD  was  37.6%  when  nurse  staffing  was  poor,  41.9%  when  nurse  staffing  was  fair, 
and 14.3% when nurse staffing was good. The prevalence of PTSD was 26.2% when the 
COVID-19  work  guidelines  had  not  changed  or  changed  only  a  little,  34.2%  when  there 
were moderate changes to the guidelines, and 44.9% when there were frequent changes in 
the guidelines (Table 2).

The  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  58.1%  when  nurses  experienced  COVID-19  symptoms 
and  31.1%  when  COVID-19  symptoms  were  not  experienced.  The  prevalence  of  PTSD 
was  42.3%  among  nurses  educated  on  new  infectious  diseases  and  29.5%  among  nurses 
who  were  not  educated  on  new  infectious  diseases.  The  prevalence  of  PTSD  was  26.8% 
for  nurses  who  cared  for  suspected  and  confirmed  COVID-19  patients,  26.8%  for  nurses 
who wore protective clothing less than 10 times, and 47.9% for nurses who wore protective 
clothing more than 11 times. The prevalence of PTSD was 19.1% for nurses who wore pro-
tective clothing less than 2 h per occasion and 72.7% for nurses who wore protective cloth-
ing for more than 2 h. The prevalence of PTSD was 20.9% for nurses who had no critical 
patients, 31.3% for nurses with 1–2 critical patients, and 70.3% for nurses with 3 or more

critical patients. The prevalence of PTSD was 63.3% for nurses who had patients who died 
and 22.2% for nurses who did not have patients who died (Table 3).

Multiple  logistic  regression  analysis  showed  that  the  adjusted  odd  ratio  (AOR)  for 
PTSD was higher for nurses working in the NDIU ward than for nurses working in the gen-
eral ward (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.21–6.71). The AOR for PTSD was higher for nurses who 
responded that nurse staffing was poor (OR = 3.03, 95% CI = 1.01–9.10) or fair (OR = 4.10, 
95% CI = 1.47–11.46) than for nurses who responded that nurse staffing was good. Expe-
riencing  COVID-19  symptoms  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  PTSD  (OR = 3.83,  95% 
CI = 1.89–7.75; Table 4).

Discussion

We investigated the prevalence of PTSD and related factors among nurses. Overall, 36.7% 
of  nurses  were  at  high  risk  of  PTSD.  Working  in  the  NDIU  ward,  experiencing  poor 
nurse  staffing,  and  experiencing  COVID-19  symptoms  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of 
PTSD. In this study during the COVID-19 outbreak, the mean post-traumatic stress score 
was  20.68 ± 19.50  points  out  of  a  maximum  of  88  points,  and  36.7%  of  the  nurses  had 
scores ≥ 25 points and were in the high risk of PTSD.

Among  front-line  nurses  in  the  Philippines,  37.8%  were  found  to  have  dysfunctional 
levels of COVID-10-related anxiety [14]. In a cross-sectional study, 64% of nurses expe-
rienced acute stress disorder due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were at risk for PTSD 
[15]. A study measuring post-traumatic stress among nurses after the MERS outbreak in 
Korea used the same IES-R tool and showed that the mean PTSD score was 7.80 ± 10.15 
with 7.1% of nurses at high risk of PTSD [8]. A study that addressed psychological distress 
during  SARS  outbreaks  showed  that  11%  of  nurses  experienced  the  stress  reaction  syn-
drome [16]. The higher PTSD score in this study is due to the higher numbers of infections 
and  deaths  from  COVID-19  than  MERS  and  SARS.  During  the  SARS  outbreaks,  there 
were  8,096  infections  worldwide  (3  in  Korea)  and  774  deaths  (0  in  Korea).  During  the 
MERS outbreak, there were 1,167 infections worldwide (186 in Korea) and 479 deaths (38 
in Korea) [17]. Currently, more than 93 million people worldwide have been infected with 
COVID-19 and more than 2 million people worldwide have died from COVID-19. In addi-
tion, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to increase.

In this study, we found that the work department associated with the risk of PTSD. The 
OR for PTSD was significantly higher for nurses who worked in the NDIS ward than for 
nurses who worked in the general ward. In the NDIS ward, nurses directly cared for sus-
pected and confirmed COVID-19 patients and had to perform new tasks, including wear-
ing  protective  clothing,  adhering  to  strict  infection  control  guidelines,  and  working  long 
hours in full-body suits [18]. Because nurses in the NDIS ward directly care for COVID-19 
patients, their risk of infection and psychological burden was high.

In this study, the experience of caring for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients 
did  not  associate  with  PTSD.  In  a  prior  study  of  nurses  during  the  MERS  outbreak,  the 
experience of caring for suspected and confirmed MERS patients was a significant factor 
for PTSD [8]. In addition, post-traumatic stress scores were higher for nurses who were in 
contact with SARS patients than for nurses who were not in contact with SARS patients 
[6]. Perhaps the prolonged outbreak of COVID-19 led to nurses becoming accustomed to 
patients with COVID-19 and reduced awareness and fear.

In this study, the OR for PTSD was significantly higher for nurses who responded that 
nurse  staffing  was  poor  and  fair  than  for  nurses  who  responded  that  nurse  staffing  was 
good. When nurse staffing is inadequate, nurses care for numerous patients and have a high 
workload. Previous studies showed that the more patients in a nurse’s care, the higher the 
stress on the nurse [19], and chronic exposure to stress associates significantly with PTSD 
[20].  The  number  of  hours  worked  per  week  associated  significantly  with  stress  among 
nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China [21]. In addition, an increase in 
the number of patients was shown to increase burnout and decrease job satisfaction among 
nurses  [22].  The  number  of  patients  per  nurse  is  higher  in  the  NDIU  ward  than  in  other 
departments because the minimum number of nurses are assigned alternately to minimize 
contacts with confirmed patients. Further, due to the nature of infectious diseases, it is dif-
ficult to predict the number and severity of infectious diseases, which likely increases psy-
chological pressure.

The  OR  for  PTSD  was  significantly  higher  for  nurses  who  responded  that  they  had 
COVID-19  symptoms  than  for  nurses  who  did  not  have  COVID-19  symptoms.  An  Aus-
tralian study conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak revealed concern for work-related 
risks,  such  as  an  insufficient  supply  of  personal  protective  equipment,  that  may  cause 
nurses to quit their jobs [23]. There has been a worldwide shortage of personal protective 
equipment, and many medical professionals have died of COVID-19 [24]. Therefore, when 
nurses who cared for patients on the frontline experienced symptoms of COVID-19, such 
as fever, cough, and phlegm, their post-traumatic stress likely increased because they sus-
pected that they may be infected with COVID-19.

Among  nurses  who  treated  COVID-19  patients,  more  instances  and  longer  periods  of 
wearing protective clothing associated with a higher risk of PTSD. An essential component 
of level D protective clothing is the N95 face mask. A previous study showed that wear-
ing the N95 face mask may lead to headaches and that wearing the N95 masks for shorter 
durations may reduce the headaches [25]. A situation in which a nurse is in physical pain 
but cannot take off their protective clothing due to caring for a patient may lead to mental 
stress. In addition, the higher number of critically ill patients a nurse cares for and death 
of a patient associated with a high risk of PTSD. A previous study reported that intensive 
care nurses have a higher prevalence of PTSD than nurses in general wards [26]. Due to 
the nature of COVID-19 care, it is difficult to rearrange or replace nursing personnel fre-
quently,  thus  post-traumatic  stress  management  is  necessary  for  nurses  who  take  care  of 
COVID-19 patients.

A  limitation  of  this  study  was  that  it  was  conducted  in  only  three  hospitals  in  Korea, 
thus it is difficult to expand the interpretation to nurses across the entire country. Because 
data were collected using self-reporting surveys, some data may be over-reported or under-
reported. However, this study is meaningful in that it provides the current PTSD status and 
the  factors  related  to  PTSD  among  frontline  nurses  caring  for  COVID-19  patients,  thus 
these data can be used to manage post-traumatic stress among nurses during future infec-
tious disease outbreaks.

A total of 36.7% of the nurses in this study were at risk of PTSD. Working in NDIU 
wards, inadequate nurse staffing, and experiencing COVID-19 symptoms associated with 
PTSD. Further studies on personal or hospital level interventions for post-traumatic stress 
prevention or management, such as shift work for nurses, will help manage PTSD among 
nurses.
