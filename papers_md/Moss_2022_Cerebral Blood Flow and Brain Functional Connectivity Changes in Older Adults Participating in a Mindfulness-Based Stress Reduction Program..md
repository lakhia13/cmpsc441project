Abstract: There is a growing interest in the potential beneﬁcial effects of mindfulness meditation
training in protecting against age-related physical, emotional, and cognitive decline. The current
prospective, single-center, single-arm study investigated if functional magnetic resonance imaging-
based changes in cerebral blood ﬂow and brain functional connectivity could be observed in 11 elderly
adults (mean age 79) after participation in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program.
The results showed signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) altered cerebral blood ﬂow and functional connectivity
in the cingulate gyrus, limbic structures, and subregions of the temporal and frontal lobes, similar
to ﬁndings of other meditation-related studies in younger populations. Furthermore, these changes
were also associated with signiﬁcant improvements in depression symptoms. This study suggests that
the MBSR program can potentially modify cerebral blood ﬂow and connectivity in this population.

1. Introduction

The growing population of older adults faces increasing stressors as they age [1]. Many
live with multiple chronic medical conditions and often chronic pain, which is associated
with considerable psychological distress and physical disability [2]. Challenged by chronic
illness, loss of loved ones, social isolation, and declining physical function, varying degrees
of anxiety and depression are common among the elderly and are associated with increased
disability and decreased well-being [3]. Research on MBSR speciﬁcally with older adults
has demonstrated a number of beneﬁcial effects, including reductions in anxiety, depression,
and loneliness [4,5]. Improvements in cognitive function have also been shown [6–9]. In
most of these studies with MBSR in the elderly, the mean age has been 65 to 75 years.

There are few studies exploring the neurophysiological changes that mindfulness
training may produce in elderly individuals. In the past, it was thought that the elderly are
less able to alter brain functions in beneﬁcial ways. For example, as people age, they are less
likely to form new neuronal connections and have less neuroplasticity [10]. Cerebral blood
ﬂow as well as functional connectivity (measuring how different parts of the brain work
together) have also been shown to decrease with aging, particularly in areas associated
with cognition [11,12].

However, a number of recent studies have suggested that neuroplasticity is still possi-
ble in the elderly and that environmental inﬂuences may augment neuronal connections

and function [13–15]. The question is whether elderly individuals might experience changes
in these neurophysiological parameters as the result of participating in an MBSR program
and whether such changes might be associated with reduced anxiety and/or depression.
The MBSR program centers on the practice of mindfulness meditation, which involves
the cultivation of an open, curious, and nonjudgmental awareness of present-moment
experience [16]. The MBSR curriculum includes training in mindfulness meditation through
different formal practices, including body scan meditation, sitting meditation, mindful
stretching, mindful walking and eating, as well as mindful communication practices. The
program also includes didactic information on stress physiology and healthy responding
versus reacting to stress. MBSR was originally designed for a heterogeneous patient
population, but most studies have been on younger populations including generally healthy
individuals younger than 65, patients with selected medical conditions, and even students
such as college, medical, or nursing students [17,18].

The MBSR program for this current study was modiﬁed for elderly individuals, and
this has been reported previously [19]. While several studies have explored the physio-
logical and clinical effect of MBSR in older adults, only a few have speciﬁcally explored
the neurophysiological correlates of such improvements. Our goal was to determine if
we can observe changes in cerebral blood ﬂow or functional connectivity in these elderly
individuals as the result of the MBSR program and if such changes are similar to or distinct
from those observed in studies of younger populations.

Importantly, in this current study, we used fMRI to assess changes in cerebral blood
ﬂow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling (ASL) and in functional connectivity using resting-
state Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) scans in elderly subjects before and after
participating in an 8-week MBSR program. ASL fMRI imaging allows for measurement
of CBF in various states. ASL fMRI has not been used extensively to study mindfulness
or other forms of meditation. One small study of 15 meditation-naïve subjects using ASL
fMRI found that anxiety reduction resulting from mindfulness meditation was associated
with activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior
insula, areas involved in self-referential thought [20]. A more recent small study using
these techniques with 10 meditation-naïve subjects found that focused attention meditation
was positively associated with changes of resting-state functional connectivity between the
default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), between the DMN
and the insula, and between the DAN and the frontoparietal control network (FPN) [21].
The same study showed that meditation training was negatively associated with changes
of resting-state functional connectivity between the DMN and the FPN and between the
DAN and the brain’s visual regions.

For the current study, we performed resting BOLD fMRI scans before and after an
MBSR program to assess functional connectivity changes in elderly subjects. In addition,
ASL scans were performed pre and post the MBSR program to more directly measure
changes in CBF. During each imaging session, we performed two ASL scans—one in the
resting condition and one during an actual meditation practice called “body scan” in which
subjects follow an audio ﬁle which guides them through the practice in which they focus
their attention on any sensations in their body. This is a common meditation practice that
is part of the MBSR program, and thus, we hoped this study would help demonstrate
whether we can show changes between meditation and non-meditation states and whether
these states are altered by participation in the 8-week MBSR program.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

Subjects were recruited from an Independent Living arm of a Life Plan Community
(formerly known as a Continuing Care Retirement Community or CCRC) to participate in
an 8-week MBSR program. Recruitment was announced by the research team in several
separate group presentations at the Life Plan Community. An overview of the study
elements was provided, and participants were asked if they had any question and if they

Behav. Sci. 2022, 12, 48

3 of 11

were interested in participating. After this initial orientation session in which details about
the MBSR program and fMRI research study were described, the subjects were invited
to volunteer to participate in the fMRI study. A total of 20 subjects who volunteered to
participate in the fMRI study met individually with a researcher to be screened in order to
determine if they met the inclusion criteria: age > 65 years and Mini-Mental Status Exam
score > 25; no prior experience with the MBSR program; no metal in their body (pacemaker,
types of stents or ports); no medical condition that could interfere with cerebral blood ﬂow;
not on any medication that could affect brain physiology or cerebral blood ﬂow.

Eleven subjects who met all inclusion criteria participated in the study (see Table 1).
All participants were Caucasian and were highly educated, with a minimum of a college
degree. All participants provided a written informed consent that was approved by the
Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board. All subjects participated in an
8-week MBSR program and completed fMRI scans within 2 weeks prior to the start date of
the MBSR program (pre-MBSR scan) and again within 2 weeks after completing the MBSR
program (post-MBSR scan). Data were acquired from September 2016 to September 2017.

2.2. The MBSR Program

The 8-week MBSR was taught by a certiﬁed MBSR teacher (certiﬁed through the
Center for Mindfulness at University of Massachusetts Medical School) with over 25 years
of experience speciﬁcally using the MBSR curriculum as developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn [16]
with some adaptations (see below). MBSR was run on site at the CCRC. Participants
met in a community room dedicated each week for the program. The environment had
natural lighting and comfortable chairs and was easily accessible. Based on input from
the administrators at the CCRC who were aware of residents’ schedules and best time of
day to run the program, classes were run in the afternoon (1:30–3:30 pm). During each
group session, the instructor led participants in guided mindfulness meditation exercises,
mindful yoga, and group discussions with the intent to foster mindful awareness of one’s
moment-to-moment experience. Between sessions, participants were asked to practice
daily using a CD of guided meditations. Attendance was taken at each session.

The standard MBSR program is an 8-week program that meets once a week for two
and a half hours and includes a full day of practice. Participants are asked to practice at
home for 45 min a day, listening to guided meditations. The following modiﬁcations were
made to the standard MBSR program in order to make it more accessible to this population
of older adults. The 8-week program for older adults met once a week for 2 h, without a full
day retreat. Participants were asked to practice at home for 25 to 30 min daily. The sequence
of practices was the same as that of the standard MBSR program including body scan
awareness practice, sitting meditation with awareness of breath, mindful yoga, mindful
walking, and loving-kindness meditation [16]. Speciﬁcally, the MBSR program used in this
study comprised the following classes and topics: Class 1: Introduction to mindfulness,
attitudinal foundations, breath as a mirror of mind and emotion, identifying present-level
stress, and introducing the Body Scan; Class 2: Physiology of stress, perception and creative
responding, cultivating mindfulness in daily activities, and introducing Awareness of
Breath Meditation; Class 3: The power of being present, meditation in stillness and move-
ment, introducing Mindful Chair Yoga; Class 4: Awareness of stress reactivity, cultivating

Behav. Sci. 2022, 12, 48

strength, balance, and ﬂexibility, and introducing Mindful Walking; Class 5: Responding
vs. reacting to stress, moving from habitual behaviors to more effective responses, and
introducing Expanding Awareness Meditation; Class 6: Interpersonal communication skills
and introducing Mindful Listening Practice; Class 7: Kindness and compassion for self
and others and introducing Loving-Kindness Meditation; Class 8: Continuing to cultivate
mindfulness in day-to-day life and setting intentions for moving forward.

To account for potentially decreased mobility in this elderly population, the yoga
practice was adapted to chair yoga instead of ﬂoor yoga. Similarly, with mindful walking,
participants had the option of walking close to a wall or to hold on to the backs of chairs
in case they needed additional support. Each home practice was put on a separate CD,
so participants could more easily manage the technology required with playing the CD.
Detailed instructions were also given to participants who wanted to listen to recordings as
mp3s on their computers or phones. The binder contents were also written in large print
for better visibility.

2.3. Clinical Measures

Subjects were evaluated for anxiety and depression pre- and post-MBSR program
using the Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety score and the Beck Depression Index (BDI)
score. Since these data were nonparametric, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to
determine if there were any measurable effects.

2.4. Imaging Acquisition

The MR imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens mMR PET–MRI scanner using a
standard 12-channel head coil. The total scan time was approximately 40 min. Initially, struc-
tural MRI brain images were collected using a T1-weighted Magnetization-Prepared Rapid
Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence. The imaging parameters used were: FOV = 25.2 cm2,
voxel size = 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 mm3, matrix size = 256 × 240, TR = 1600 ms, TE = 2.46 ms, slice
thickness = 1 mm, number of slices = 176, ﬂip angle = 9◦, and acquisition time = 280 s. Next,
resting-state BOLD fMRI data were collected using an Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence.
The following imaging parameters were used: FOV = 23.6 cm2, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 4 mm3,
matrix size = 128 × 128, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, slice thickness = 4 mm, number of slices
= 34, number of volumes = 180, and acquisition time = 360 s. During resting-state fMRI, the
subjects were instructed to close their eyes, keep their heads still, and relax for 5 min.

Finally, the subjects underwent two ASL scans. The ﬁrst scan was performed while
the subjects were at rest with their eyes closed as in the resting-state BOLD scan for
approximately 6 min. The second scan was performed while participants were guided
through “body scan meditation” in which they were instructed to attend to sensations in
the body, progressively focusing on different body parts. This is a core meditation practice
in the MBSR program. This procedure was followed again post-MBSR.

ASL scans pre- and post-MBSR program were performed using Echo Planar Imaging
(EPI) sequence parameters as follows: TR = 2500 ms, TE = 11 ms, FOV = 19.2 cm2, voxel size
= 3 × 3 × 6 mm3. An asymmetrical pulsed ASL sequence (PICORE Q2T) [11] was utilized
with the following parameters: 16 slices acquired in ascending order, slice thickness = 6 mm,
Bolus Duration = 1675 ms, Inversion/Delay Time = 1800 ms, Labeling time = 700 ms,
and labeling pulse ﬂip angle = 90◦. In total, 119 volumes were acquired, with the 1st
volume containing the M0 image, and the remaining volumes containing 59 pairs of
control/labelled images.

2.5. Cerebral Blood Flow Analysis

Preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed on all subjects using Matlab
(ver. R2018a), using the standard steps that are incorporated as part of a validated SPM12-
based ASL perfusion MRI data processing toolbox, ASLtbx [22]. The processing steps are
as follows: (1) Realignment: rigid body spatial transformation was applied to the PASL
control and label images in order to remove motion artifacts in the PASL time-series; (2) Co-

Behav. Sci. 2022, 12, 48

5 of 11

Registration: the motion-corrected PASL images and the M0 images were co-registered
to the structural T1 space; (3) Smoothing: the PASL images were smoothed before CBF
calculation to prevent noise propagation and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
A 6 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel was used; (4) Cerebral
Blood Flow Calculation: perfusion difference images were generated, and the mean whole
brain cerebral blood ﬂow (mL/100 g/min) was calculated for each subject by pairwise
control–label subtraction using the established one compartment model [23,24]. CBF was
estimated using the following formula and parameters:

f =

∆MλR1a· exp(ωR1a)
2M0α

·[1 − exp(−τ·R1a)]−1

where f is CBF, ∆M is the difference signal between the control and the label acquisitions,
R1a is the longitudinal relaxation rate of blood, τ is the labeling time, ω is the post-labeling
delay time, α is the labeling efﬁciency, λ is blood/tissue water partition coefﬁcient, and M0
is approximated by the control image intensity. The parameters used in this study were
R1a = 0.67 s−1, α = 0.95, λ = 0.9 g/mL, τ = 0.7 s, ω = 1.8 s; (5) Segmentation: the anatomical
images were divided into individual tissue types (grey matter, white matter, and CSF)
for use in the outlier cleaning step. The high-resolution structural image (T1-MPRAGE)
were used and compared to prior established tissue probability maps generated in SPM;
(6) Outlier cleaning: slice-wise outlier cleaning was applied to the perfusion difference
images produced in step 4 and utilized the segmentations produced in step 5 [25]; (7) Nor-
malization: deformations produced from the SPM12 segmentation implemented in step
5 were applied to the outlier-cleaned CBF maps to transform the functional data into the
standard Montreal Neurological Image (MNI) space.

After pre-processing was completed, a quantitative group analysis was performed us-
ing SPM12 software. This method involved statistical analyses of the normalized, smoothed,
outlier-corrected perfusion images in order to assess the group differences in resting-state
cerebral blood ﬂow before MBSR and after it. In order to ﬁnd this effect, the resting con-
dition and the ‘body scan’ condition were compared using a 2 × 2 full factorial ANOVA
design, factor 1 was the condition (resting or body scan), and factor 2 was time (pre MBSR
and post MBSR). This was a voxel-based analysis performed on the whole brain, using a
T-contrast reﬂecting the mean difference between the two time periods and the variation
within them. A post hoc FDR correction was applied based on the regions we hypothesized
would be involved in the meditation process. The regions that survived FDR correction
for multiple comparisons with a p value < 0.05 were identiﬁed. These regions represent
the change in CBF after two months of participating in the MBSR program seen during the
resting condition and during body scan meditation.

2.6. Functional Connectivity Analysis

Preprocessing was completed in SPM12 (UCL, London, UK) within the MATLAB®
environment (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Functional data were realigned, with the
mean image co-registered to structural volumes. Segmentation of structural volumes in
grey matter, white matter, and CSF spaces was completed, and volumes were spatially
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Finally, normalized images
were smoothed temporally. Functional data were denoised using a component-based noise
correction method (CompCor) within the CONN toolbox (Neuroimaging Informatics Tools
and Resources Clearinghouse, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The
structural volumes were separated into white matter, gray matter, and CSF confounds. A
band-pass ﬁlter with a range of 0.008 to 0.09 Hz was applied to the data to restrict the
analysis to a limited frequency window, while white matter and CSF confounds were
placed in a 3D space. This analysis pipeline is well established and widely used in the fMRI
community for evaluating resting-state data.

Next, a seed-based analysis was carried out on this analyzed dataset. Regions of
interest (ROIs) were deﬁned using the Harvard-Oxford (Center for Morphometric Analysis,

Behav. Sci. 2022, 12, 48

6 of 11

Massachusetts General Hospital-East, Charlestown, MA, USA) atlas. Changes in functional
connectivity between several areas of interest, including anterior cingulate cortex, amyg-
dala, cerebellum, limbic system, parahippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, were examined
with both ROI-to-voxel and ROI-to-ROI analyses. General linear models (GLMs) were used
to compare resting-state connectivity between pre- and post-MBSR. A p < 0.01 uncorrected
height threshold and p < 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected cluster threshold were
used along with both single and two-tailed correlations.

3. Results
3.1. Study Completion Rate, MBSR Attendance, and Clinical Response

All of the 11 subjects who participated in this fMRI study completed the 8-week MBSR
program and both the pre- and post-program brain scans. Nine of the subjects attended all
eight MBSR classes, and two attended seven classes.

When evaluating clinical response in this small cohort, there was a signiﬁcant decrease
in BDI scores using the Wilcoxin signed-rank test with a median pre-MBSR score of 2.5
(interquartile range of 6.0) and a median post-MBSR score of 1.0 (interquartile range of
3.0) (p < 0.05), with a Cohen’s d of 0.51 and a non-signiﬁcant decrease in state anxiety (see
Table 1). No subjects reported any adverse events or experiences during the MBSR program
or during procedures such as the MRI. This included no reports of increased anxiety, stress,
or depression.

3.2. Changes in Cerebral Blood Flow

Changes in CBF between the pre- and post-MBSR states are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Overall, during the resting state, there were signiﬁcant increases in the post-MBSR program
scan compared to the pre-MBSR program scan in the right PFC, anterior and posterior
cingulate gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus. During the
meditation state, there were signiﬁcant increases in the post-MBSR program compared to
the pre-MBSR program scan in the left PFC, left putamen, posterior cingulate gyrus, and
left and right inferior parietal lobes.

3.3. Changes in Functional Connectivity

The functional connectivity results are provided in Table 4 and described in more
detail below. ROI-to-voxel analysis showed increased connectivity between the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left insular cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, putamen, and
left orbitofrontal cortex (FDR-corrected p = 0.002). ROI-to-voxel analysis showed decreased
connectivity between the ACC and the cerebellum, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left
superior temporal gyrus (FDR-corrected p = 0.008).

connectivity using the amygdala as the ROI.

ROI-to-voxel analysis showed increased connectivity between the parahippocampus
and the right hippocampus, right insular cortex, right inferior temporal gyrus, and cerebel-
lum (FDR-corrected p = 0.00006). There were no signiﬁcant areas of decreased connectivity
using the parahippocampus as the ROI.

ROI-to-voxel analysis showed increased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex
(PFC) and the right superior temporal gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus (FDR-
corrected p = 0.0002). There were no signiﬁcant areas of decreased connectivity using the
PFC as the ROI.

ROI-to-ROI analysis showed increased connectivity between the right amygdala and
the left hippocampus (FDR-corrected p = 0.033), between the right hippocampus and the
right parahippocampus (FDR-corrected p = 0.039), and between the left and the right
caudate nuclei (FDR-corrected p = 0.0238).

4. Discussion

Neuroimaging studies of mindfulness have grown exponentially in the past decade
and demonstrate that mindfulness training can change both brain structure and brain func-
tion. A recent systematic review of 21 studies indicates that the emotional and behavioral

Behav. Sci. 2022, 12, 48

8 of 11

changes observed in people after participating in Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs)
are related to both functional and structural changes in the brain [26]. This review article
reported that participation in MBIs is associated with increased activity, connectivity, and
volume in the prefrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the insula, and the hippocampus. In
addition, participation in MBIs is associated with increased amygdala functional connectiv-
ity with the prefrontal cortex and earlier deactivation after exposure to emotional stimuli.
A separate study explored the MBSR course in 140 healthy adults with an average
age of 44.3 years randomized to the MBSR program, an active control, or a waitlist control
group [27]. The study found increased resting connectivity between the executive control
network (dorsolateral PFC) and the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex)
for those participating in the MBSR relative to the control groups. Further, the MBSR
participants showed a signiﬁcantly stronger relationship between days of practice and
increased connectivity between these structures.

Smart et al. [28] found that mindfulness training with older adults with subjective
cognitive decline led to decreases in memory complaints, increases in memory efﬁcacy,
and increased total brain volume. Another earlier study by Moynihan et al. [29] found
that MBSR produced small but signiﬁcant changes in executive function and sustained
left frontal asymmetry of the EEG alpha band in older adults. A study by Malinowski
and colleagues [30] demonstrated improvements in goal-directed visuospatial attention
and associated electrophysiological changes in older adults with mindfulness training.
In the aforementioned studies of MBSR with older adults, the mean age ranged between
65 and 75 years.

Additionally, in a recent randomized controlled trial of 146 older individuals, mindful-
ness training was compared to a cognitive ﬁtness program to determine brain effects and
also effects on cognition [31]. Mindfulness training was associated with greater improve-
ments in cognition that were associated with increased connectivity within the default
mode network, particularly between the right hippocampus and the posteromedial cor-
tex and between the left hippocampus and the lateral parietal cortex. These ﬁndings are
important since the default mode network is associated with cognitive function and is
particularly vulnerable to aging affects.

This current single-arm study enrolled one of the oldest cohorts of subjects studied
with fMRI to evaluate cerebral blood ﬂow and functional connectivity before and after
an MBSR program (the mean age of the subset of the study participants was 79 years).
The study showed that conducting neuroimaging with this population is feasible and
can demonstrate signiﬁcant changes even in a small sample. Several signiﬁcant changes
in CBF and functional connectivity associated with participation in the MBSR program
were observed, consistent with a number of the above-mentioned ﬁndings in other studies
of MBIs [20,21]. Cerebral blood ﬂow was found to be increased both at rest and during
meditation after participating in the MBSR program. During the resting scans, there was
increased CBF in the right PFC, anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus,
left superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and right anterior cingulate. These are
important ﬁndings, since they suggest changes in the basic function of the brain as the
result of participating in the MBSR program. Such changes may contribute to the reductions
in depressive symptoms that we observed in our subjects.
In fact, a recent study of
transcranial magnetic stimulation with intermittent theta bursts to the prefrontal cortex
signiﬁcantly reduced depression symptoms [32]. These changes have also been linked to
reduced anxiety, which we did not observe to a signiﬁcant degree in this study. During
the body scan meditation itself, there were signiﬁcant increases in CBF in the left PFC,
the left putamen, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and left and right inferior parietal lobes.
The ﬁnding of changes in the brain during the body scan meditation before and after
undergoing the MBSR program suggest a training effect, such that practicing meditation
over a period of time changes the way in which the brain actually becomes active during
the practice. Future studies with a larger number of subjects will be needed to better

understand the relationship between longitudinal changes in CBF during meditation itself
and changes in brain function at rest that might relate to clinical effects.

In the current study, there was generally increased connectivity between brain struc-
tures involved in emotional self-regulation such as the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal
cortex, cerebellum, caudate nuclei, and limbic regions. Also observed was increased con-
nectivity between speciﬁc regions, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, and the
amygdala and parahippocampus. These results suggest that there are functional changes,
particularly, increased connectivity in areas associated with emotion regulation, attention,
and memory in older adults participating in the MBSR program.

The ﬁndings are consistent with prior studies in younger populations in which the pre-
frontal cortex, limbic areas such as the hippocampus and the amygdala, and the posterior
cingulate are affected by mindfulness programs. For example, a small study of 14 patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participating in MBSR revealed increased functional
connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral medial prefrontal
cortex and left hippocampus compared to controls [33]. These results indicated that in
adults with MCI, MBSR may have a positive impact on the regions of the brain most related
to MCI. In another study, 35 adults presenting with psychological distress underwent a
3-day mindfulness program and were found to have increased resting-state functional
connectivity between brain regions associated with executive function [34]. Decreased
resting-state functional connectivity in the amygdala–anterior cingulate cortex were also
found after the 3-day mindfulness program, suggesting a pathway for the stress reduction
effects of mindfulness [35]. Finally, an fMRI study by Yang et al. [36] of 13 novices with
a mean age of 24 who underwent 40 days of mindfulness training showed increased con-
nectivity between the precuneus and the temporoparietal junction, but reduced functional
connectivity in the frontal brain regions. This latter ﬁnding is in the opposite direction of
our ﬁndings, and future studies will be needed to determine whether these changes are
distinct among differently aged patient populations.

The current study supports these previous reports of neuroplastic changes with mind-
fulness training and adds to the growing ﬁeld by observing changes in elderly adults. Our
study results suggest that the MBSR program alters functional connectivity in emotional
networks in older individuals. There is also overlap, with some of these regions having
both altered functional connectivity as well as altered CBF. These areas include the PFC,
anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex, all areas involved in attentional
control and emotional regulation.

The study limitations include a small sample size and lack of diversity in the popula-
tion of older adults, which can limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings. In addition, this
single-arm fMRI study did not include a control group and thus did not control for factors
such as time and attention. More research including randomized trials with larger sample
sizes, active control groups, and long-term follow-up is needed to further investigate the
promising results of this study.
