Abstract 
Aim  Although there are many scales that measure stigma, there is no scale with the necessary adequacy to measure 
stigma in the perinatal period. The study aims to develop the stigma scale for women with mental illness in the peri-
natal period and test its validity and reliability.

Materials and methods  Participants were reached via patients, visitors, and hospital staff who applied to Sakarya 
Training and Research Hospital between 01/06/2022 and 01/12/2022. Two hundred people (female n = 134, male 
n = 66) aged 18–65 participated in the study and "Sociodemographic data form," "Perinatal Mental Illness Stigma 
Scale (PMISS)," "Social Distance Scale," and "Beliefs Towards Mental Illness Scale" were used to collect data. Data were 
analyzed using SPSS 22 and the AMOS 26 program.

Results  The Content Validity Index of the scale items was between 0.80–1. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient score 
of the general scale was 0.94, the "Discrimination and Prejudice" sub-dimension was 0.93, and the "Labeling" sub-
dimension was 0.88. It was determined that item-total score correlations varied between 0.410 and 0.799. P value 
calculated < 0.05 in Barlett’s test and 0.94 in the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test. These values show that factor analysis can be 
applied to the scale. According to the Exploratory Factor Analysis result, the scale has a 2-factor structure, explaining 
60% of the total variance. The Guttman Split-Half coefficient of the scale was 0.882, and the Spearman-Brown coef-
ficient was 0.883. The scale was reapplied to 30 participants with an interval of three weeks. The correlation coefficient 
between the two measurements was 0.91, indicating that the scale satisfies the invariance principle over time.

Conclusion  The PMISS is a reliable measurement tool that can be used to investigate stigma towards mental illness 
during the perinatal period in the Turkish population.

Introduction
Stigma  is  a  negative  attitude  that  society  develops 
towards  mental  disorders  and  some  illnesses,  leading  to 
the  person’s  exclusion.  Prejudices,  which  are  negative 
attitudes  or  opinions  towards  people  or  some  groups, 
create social distance towards these people. People with 
mental  illness  have  been  stigmatized  many  times  from 
the past to the present. Society has seen mental illness as 
a sign of deviance, personal inadequacy, low intelligence, 
weakness,  incompetence,  or  unreliability.  People  with

mental  illness  have  also  been  judged  to  be  violent  and 
unpredictable. Such negative attitudes and behaviors can 
be found in many parts of society, particularly in people’s 
families,  social  circles,  and  among  health  profession-
als.  Nor  does  stigma  vary  much  between  countries  and 
regions [1].

Stigmatization serves as a deterrent for help seeking for 
numerous  individuals  with  mental  disorders,  leading  to 
a  consequential  cessation  or  abstention  from  treatment-
seeking  endeavors.  In  this  context,  it  is  concluded  that 
stigma inflicts harm upon individuals with mental illness 
and,  by  extension,  upon  society  at  large,  engendering 
inequitable circumstances and deleterious consequences 
[1,  2].  In  a  study  of  major  depressive  disorder,  stigma 
was  associated  with  treatment  incompliance,  negative 
emotional  experiences,  and  decreased  self-esteem  [3]. 
Another study reported that self-stigma is related to low 
self-efficacy and low self-esteem, that self-stigma results 
from social stigma, and that studies should be conducted 
to increase public awareness to benefit patients [4].

Exposure  to  stigma  also  affects  people’s  mental  health 
in the perinatal period. Identifying stigma in the perina-
tal period is essential for the mother’s mental health and 
the  baby’s  healthy  development.  There  have  been  many 
studies  on  stigma,  but  studies  on  stigma  in  the  perina-
tal  period  are  limited.  So  far,  a  perinatal  internal  stigma 
has  been  developed,  which  assesses  the  internal  stigma 
of  women  with  perinatal  mental  illness,  but  it  has  not 
yet been translated into our language [5]. To the best of 
our  knowledge,  no  scale  measures  the  social  stigma  of 
mental illness in the perinatal period. This study aims to 
develop a scale that can be used by women with mental 
illness in the perinatal period but also by healthy people 
and, therefore, by a large population. This study aims to 
develop the Perinatal Mental Illness Stigma Scale and test 
its validity and reliability.

Materials and method
Place and time of research

This  study  was  conducted  with  200  participants  from 
the  community.  Participants  were  reached  via  patients, 
relatives, and hospital staff who applied to Sakarya Train-
ing  and  Research  Hospital  between  01/06/2022  and 
01/12/2022.

Sample of the research

Reviewing  the  literature  found  that  the  sample  size  was 
calculated on scale items and variables in scale develop-
ment studies. The literature states that a sample of 100–
200 people is sufficient, especially if the factors are clear 
and robust and the number of variables is small [6]. It is 
generally accepted that the sample size should be at least 

five or even ten times the number of variables [7]. As the 
final version of the scale consisted of 20 items, the sample 
size was 200 (20 × 10 = 200) people.

The  sample  was  randomly  selected  from  participants 
aged 18–65 years with a similar distribution in terms of 
different  genders,  socio-economic  levels,  education  lev-
els,  and  employment  status  were  included  in  the  study. 
To  ensure  that  the  participants  reflected  all  of  society, 
healthy and ill people were included in the study, except 
those  with  diseases  known  to  affect  cognitive  function, 
willpower, and judgment.

Stages of the study
Creation of scale items

The first form of the Perinatal Mental Illness Stigma Scale 
(PMISS)  was  created  with  40  questions  by  conducting  a 
literature  review  on  the  scales  developed  on  stigmatiza-
tion related to mental illnesses, factors related to stigma, 
perinatal diseases, and motherhood skills. Twenty items, 
which  were  thought  to  reflect  perinatal  stigma  better, 
were selected from the 40-item scale by taking the opin-
ion of a team of 20 faculty members and psychiatry resi-
dents working in the field of psychiatry.

Getting expert opinion

For content validity, the 20-item scale was sent via e-mail 
to a team of 10 experts working in the field of perinatal 
mental  health.  After  the  expert  opinions,  the  content  of 
the  8th,  17th,  18th  and  20th  items  were  adjusted.  After 
the  expert  opinion,  the  20-item  scale  was  finalized  and 
the  application  part  was  started.  A  summary  of  the 
implementation stages is given in Fig. 1.

Data collection tools
Sociodemographic data form

It  is  the  form  filled  by  the  participants,  which  includes 
the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients par-
ticipating in the study, such as age, education level, mari-
tal status, socioeconomic level, and the history of mental 
illness and additional medical illness.

Perinatal Mental Illness Stigma Scale (PMISS)

After the expert opinion, the final version of the scale was 
created as 20 items. The scale aims to measure the opin-
ions of other people about women with psychiatric illness 
in the perinatal period. The high score obtained from the 
scale  indicates  that  the  stigmatization  of  women  with 
mental  illness  in  the  perinatal  period  is  high.  The  scale 
has a 5-point Likert-type rating as "I totally disagree", "I

partially  disagree",  "I  neither  agree  nor  disagree",  "I  par-
tially agree", "I totally agree". Filled in by the participants.

Social Distance Scale (SDS)

While  developing  the  scale,  well-known  Star  sample 
cases  describing  paranoid  schizophrenia  and  anxiety 
neurosis/depression were presented to the participants, 
and a psychiatric diagnosis was not written to the cases. 
Each subject responded to only one randomly selected 
sample case. After the sample case, a 14-question scale 
developed  by  the  researcher  was  applied.  This  scale 
aims  to  measure  the  desired  social  distance  between 
the mentally ill and the person in order to examine the 
social rejection of the mentally ill in our society. Find-
ings  showed  that  there  is  more  acceptance  of  being  in 
impersonal  environments  with  the  people  depicted  in 
the examples, and less desire to interact with these peo-
ple  in  environments  involving  social  intimacy.  In  our 
study, there was no star case sample, and it was stated 
that the form should be filled considering women with 
mental  illness.  The  validity  and  reliability  study  of  the 
scale was carried out by Haluk Arkar in 1991 [8].

Beliefs Toward Mental Illness Scale (BMI)

It is a scale whose validity and reliability study was com-
pleted in 2008, which was created to determine the posi-
tive  and  negative  beliefs  of  individuals  with  different 
cultural  characteristics  about  mental  illnesses.  The  final 
version of the 21-item scale consists of three sub-scales: 
"Dangerous",  "Helplessness",  "Poor  Social  and  Interper-
sonal  Skills"  and  is  a  6-point  Likert  type.  Although  the 
scale  is  interpreted  on  both  subscale  scores  and  scale 
total scores, a high score indicates negative belief in men-
tal illnesses [9].

Validity and reliability of the perinatal mental illness 
stigma scale
Content validity

After the 20-item version of the scale was created, it was 
presented to the expert opinion of 10 people with experi-
ence working in the field of perinatal mental health, and 
the  answers  were  evaluated  with  the  Davis  technique. 
They  were  asked  to  answer  the  questions  as  "A = The 
item is appropriate, B = The item should be edited lightly, 
C = The  item  should  be  edited  seriously,  D = The  item  is 

 Sen et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2024) 24:89

not appropriate." According to the Davis technique, The 
ratio  of  those  who  chose  A  (item  appropriate)  and  B 
(item should be slightly modified) to the total number of 
experts constitutes the Content Validity Index (CVI), and 
this value should be 0.80 and above [10].

Construct validity

Factor  analyses  are  used  for  the  construct  validity  of  the 
scale. Before factor analysis, it is necessary to test the sam-
ple size’s adequacy and the data’s suitability for factor anal-
ysis.  Exploratory  factor  analysis  (EFA)  and  Confirmatory 
Factor Analysis (CFA) were used for the construct validity 
of  the  scale.  Rotation  is  used  to  simplify  the  structure  of 
the factors. Varimax and oblimin techniques were used for 
rotation [11]. The suitability of the sample size was exam-
ined using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value. For the 
sample size to be sufficient, the KMO must be greater than 
0.50 [12]. Another study stated that the KMO value should 
be above 0.60 to perform factor analysis [13].

Before  performing  factor  analysis,  it  is  necessary  to 
check whether the correlation matrix is appropriate. The 
suitability of the correlation matrix is evaluated with Bar-
tlett’s  Sphericity  test.  Bartlett’s  Sphericity  test  tests  the 
hypothesis that the correlation matrix is the unit matrix. 
P  values < 0.05  in  Barlett’s  test  indicate  the  suitability  of 
the scale for factor analysis.

Internal consistency

The  internal  consistency  of  the  items  in  the  scale  was 
evaluated  with  the  Cronbach  Alpha  Coefficient,  split-
ting the test in half, the item-total score correlation, and 
the comparison of the 27% lower and upper slices of the 
scale total score. Item-total score correlations are another 
internal consistency measure.

Item-total  score  correlation  evaluates  the  relation-
ship between a scale item and the total score of the scale 
items.  It  is  used  to  determine  how  accurately  the  item 
measures the trait being measured. If the item-total score 
correlation  is  high,  the  item  is  highly  discriminating.  If 
the  correlation  coefficient  is  low,  it  can  be  said  that  the 
item is not reliable enough, and its discrimination is low 
[14]. It has been suggested that the item-total correlation 
should be greater than 0.20 for each item [15].

Summability and confirmatory factor analysis

Tukey’s summability test was used to assess whether the 
scale is an additive scale type. Structural equation mod-
eling  (SEM)  is  an  analysis  method  that  combines  multi-
variate regression analysis and factor analysis. With SEM, 
the  compatibility  of  the  statements  that  are  claimed  to 
exist  theoretically,  and  thus  their  verification,  is  carried 
out  [16].  CFA  is  an  example  of  SEM  that  deals  with  the 

relationships between observed measurements and latent 
variables  or  factors.  Measures  observed  with  CFA  are 
interrelated  and  variables  or  factors  affect  correlations 
between observations [17]. The fact that the fit index val-
ues calculated during CFA are within the recommended 
range  indicates  that  the  developed  hypothesis  is  correct 
[18].In the SEM, CMIN/df values of fit index < 3 indicates 
ideal result, < 5 indicates acceptable fit, > 0.90 good fit for 
NFI,  CFI,  IFI,  TLI, < 0.05  ideal  result  for  RMSEA  (< 0.08 
good fit, < 0.10 indicates acceptable fit) [19].

Invariance of scale over time

Invariance  over  time  was  measured  by  the  test–retest 
method.  The  fact  that  the  results  of  two  measurements 
made at different times are similar indicates that the scale 
is  invariant  over  time.  For  the  test–retest  process,  it  is 
stated that the scale should be re-administered to at least 
30  people  with  an  interval  of  2–4  weeks  [20].  Pearson 
correlation value greater than 0.7 between two measure-
ments indicates a high correlation [21].

Examining the data

The data of the research were analyzed by IBM SPSS 22 
and IBM AMOS 26 program. A free trial version of IBM 
AMOS  26  was  used.  Normality  distribution  of  the  data 
was examined with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and Z 
test. The statistical methods used in the study are shown 
in Table 1 in detail.

Results
Sociodemographic and clinical features

The Perinatal Mental Illness Stigma Scale (PMISS) study 
involved  200  participants,  66  (33%)  of  whom  were  male 
and  134  (67%)  were  female.  The  participants’  mean  age 
was 34.68 (minimum 18, maximum 65, median 31, mean 
34.68). Table 2 provides the sociodemographic character-
istics of the participants.

When  mental  history  of  the  participants  evaluated  it 
is seen that; thirty-seven people (18.5%) were diagnosed 
with  a  mental  illness,  and  163  (81.5%)  were  not. Thirty-
five people (94.5%) diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder 
received treatment, while two (5.5%) did not. Looking at 
the  treatment  distribution,  30  people  (85.8%)  received 
outpatient medication, 3 (8.5%) received both outpatient 
medication  and  psychotherapy,  and  2  (5.7%)  received 
psychotherapy  only.  None  had  ever  received  inpatient 
treatment or ECT.

When  considering  whether  people  had  a  psychiatric 
illness in their family or close environment, 39% (n = 78) 
had someone diagnosed with a psychiatric illness in their 
immediate environment, and 61% (n = 122) did not.

of the perinatal mental illness stigma scale
Content validity

Content  validity  was  assessed  with  the  Davis  technique. 
The  content  validity  index  of  the  PMISS  items  was 
between  0.80–1.  According  to  the  experts’  suggestions, 
the contents of the 8th, 17th, 18th, and 20th items were 
revised, and the total number of items did not change.

Internal consistency

The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the scale was found to 
be  0.949.  When  the  calculations  were  made  by  remov-
ing  the  items,  it  was  found  that  the  Cronbach  alpha 
coefficient  of  the  scale  varied  between  0.945  and  0.951 
(Table  3).  As  there  was  no  significant  change,  no  item 
was removed from the scale. The Cronbach’s alpha coeffi-
cients of the PMISS sub-dimensions were calculated sep-
arately. The sub-dimension ’Discrimination and Prejudice 
(Factor 1)’ was found to be 0.93, and the sub-dimension 
’Labelling (Factor 2)’ was 0.88.

The  item-total  correlations  varied  between  0.410  and 

0.799; the results were significant at p < 0.001.

The  Cronbach’s  alpha  coefficient  was  calculated  sepa-
rately for the test’s first part (ten questions) and the sec-
ond part (ten questions). This value was 0.894 for the first 
part of the scale and 0.935 for the second part; the Gutt-
man Split-Half coefficient was 0.882, and the Spearman-
Brown coefficient was 0.883.

In  assessing  internal  consistency,  the  total  scores 
obtained from the scale are ordered from highest to low-
est,  and  the  relationship  between  the  lower  and  upper 
27% is examined. The difference between the two groups 
was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Construct validity

There  is  no  reverse  item  in  the  scale,  the  correlation 
between scale items was found to be 0.211 at the lowest 
and 0.791 at the highest. The suitability of the sample size 
was examined using the KMO value. The KMO value was 
found to be 0.945 and sample size accepted a sufficient.

Chi Square = 2794,639, p < 0.001 was found in the Bar-
tlett’s Sphericity test. The result obtained shows that the 
correlation  matrix  is  suitable  and  factor  analysis  can  be 
applied to the data.

Varimax and Oblimin vertical rotation were applied to 
the data. Since three factors combined after varimax ver-
tical rotation and six factors combined after oblimin, the 
data obtained with the oblimin technique were used. As a 
result of EFA, no item was removed from the scale.

As  a  result  of  Principal  Component  Analysis,  it  was 
found  that  the  scale  consisted  of  two  factors.  The  items 
constituting the 2-factor structure of PMISS were exam-
ined;  first  factor  consists  of  8th,  9th,  10th,  11th,  12th, 
13th,  14th,  15th,  16th,  17th,  18th,  19th,  20th  items.  The 
first  sub-dimension  is  called  “Discrimination  and  Preju-
dice”.  The  second  factor  consists  of  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  4th,

5th, 6th, and 7th items, and this sub-dimension is called 
“Labeling.”

As a result of applying the oblimin rotation technique, 
it  resulted  in  a  2-factor  structure  with  an  eigenvalue 
above 1.00 and 60.48% of the total variance.

In the graph created with the Scree Plot test, the num-
ber  of  factors  is  determined  by  looking  at  how  many 
factors  exist  until  the  first  sharp  change.  Since  the  first 
sharp change in the graph was in the 2nd factor, the fac-
tor number was accepted as 2, in line with the previously 
determined factor. (Fig. 2.).

Summability and confirmatory factor analysis

According  to  the  result  of  the  analysis  of  variance  with 
Tukey’s summability test, the scale is collectible. (Nonad-
ditivity: F = 1,571, P = 0,210 > 0,05).

After  examining  whether  the  data  are  normally  dis-
tributed, CFA applied. (Kolmogorov–Smirnov value was 
0.043 and p = 0.200).

Structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  results  examined 
by  CFA  were  found  to  be  in  acceptable  fit.  (P < 0.001, 
X2/df = 2,653,  RMSEA = 0,080,  NFI = 0,846,  CFI = 0,896,

values and fit indices in our study are given in Fig. 3.

Correlation with other scales

For the correlation of the developed scale, the responses 
given  to  the  Social  Distance  Scale  (SDS)  and  the  Beliefs 
Toward  Mental  Illness  Scale  (BMI)  whose  validity  and 
reliability  were  proven  in  terms  of  stigma,  were  com-
pared  with  the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient.  A  posi-
tive correlation was found between the responses of the 
participants to the scales. The correlation of PMISS with 
BMI  was  0.765,  and  its  correlation  with  SDS  was  0.640 
(Table 4).

Invariance of scale over time

The  scale  was  reapplied  to  30  participants  three  weeks 
apart. The correlation coefficient between measurements 
was 0.91, indicating that the scale satisfies the principle of 
invariance over time.

Discussion
The study’s results indicate that the PMISS is a valid scale 
for measuring perinatal stigma towards mental illnesses. 
The  scale  demonstrates  internal  consistency,  construct 
validity,  and  consistent  results  in  retest  measurements. 
This  research  is  essential  as  it  is  the  first  scale  study  to 

validly  and  reliably  measure  the  social  stigmatization  of 
mental illnesses seen in perinatal women.

The  validity  and  reliability  analysis  of  the  scale  first 
started  with  internal  consistency  analysis.  The  internal 
consistency of the scale is defined as the items being com-
patible with each other and the entire scale and measur-
ing the same structure in a consistent manner [22]. In our 
study, the Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the general scale 
was  found  to  be  0.94,  the  factor  1  sub-dimension  was 
0.93, and the factor 2 sub-dimension was 0.88. A value of 
0.7 or higher showed adequate reliability, while a value of 
0.8 or higher showed good internal consistency [23, 24].

Item-total  score  correlations  are  another  measure  of 
internal  consistency.  In  item-total  score  correlation,  the 
relationship  between  a  scale  item  and  the  total  score  of 
the  scale  items  is  evaluated.  Item-total  score  correlation 
is  used  to  determine  how  accurately  the  item  measures 
the  feature  it  is  intended  to  measure.  When  the  item-
total score correlation is high, the discrimination of that 
item is high; when the correlation coefficient is low, it can 
be  said  that  the  item  is  not  reliable  enough  and  its  dis-
crimination  is  low  [14].  It  was  stated  that  the  item-total 
score correlation in the developed scales should be over 

 Sen et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2024) 24:89

0.20 and there should be no negative correlation between 
the  items  [14].  There  are  no  reverse  items  in  the  scale, 
the  lowest  item-total  score  correlation  was  0.410  and 
the highest was 0.799. The correlation between the scale 
items  was  found  to  be  the  lowest  0.211  and  the  highest 
0.791.  The  fact  that  the  correlation  between  the  scale 
items and the total score is above 0.20, that the scale does 
not  contain  reverse  items,  and  that  no  negative  correla-
tion is detected between the items shows that the PMISS 
does not contain any problematic items and provides suf-
ficient internal consistency criteria.

Another  method  used  for  internal  consistency  analy-
sis  is  the  calculation  of  Cronbach’s  Alpha  reliability 
coefficient  after  splitting  the  test  in  half  technique.  Two 
separate  groups  were  created,  consisting  of  the  first  10 
questions  and  the  second  10  questions.  This  value  was 
found to be 0.894 for the first part of the scale and 0.935 
for the second part. The Guttman Split-Half coefficient of 
the scale was found to be 0.882 and the Spearman-Brown 
coefficient  was  0.883,  and  the  correlation  between  the 
two parts was found to be 0.790. Since values above 0.70 
are  considered  reliable  in  the  literature,  these  findings 
show that the internal consistency reliability of PMISS is 
high [6, 23, 24].

In  scale  development  studies,  after  internal  consist-
ency  analyzes  are  completed,  construct  validity  ana-
lyzes  should  also  be  performed.  It  has  been  reported  in 

the  literature  that  before  factor  analysis,  the  adequacy 
of the size of the sample group for factor analysis should 
be  tested.  In  factor  analysis,  it  is  determined  whether 
the size of the sample group is sufficient or not by using 
the KMO test [25]. In order to apply factor analysis, it is 
recommended  that  the  KMO  value  be  over  0.60.  In  the 
literature, KMO of 0.90–1 is accepted as an excellent reli-
ability value, but in our study, the KMO value was found 
to be 0.945, that is, in the perfect range. The KMO value 
being  determined  as  0.945  shows  that  sufficient  sample 
group size was provided for factor analysis. Before factor 
analysis, it is necessary to check whether the correlation 
matrix is appropriate. Whether the correlation matrix is 
appropriate  or  not  is  evaluated  by  Bartlett’s  Sphericity 
test.  With  Bartlett’s  Sphericity  test,  the  hypothesis  that 
the  correlation  matrix  is  an  identity  matrix  is  tested.  In 
our  study,  Chi  Square = 2794.639,  p < 0.001.  The  result 
obtained shows that the correlation matrix is appropriate 
and factor analysis can be applied to the data [26–29].

The second stage of the EFA application involves exam-
ining the factor structure of the scale. It is recommended 
to  use  Principal  Component  analysis  and  rotation  tech-
niques to determine the factor structure of the scale. As 
a result of the application of these analyzes in our study, 
a  2-factor  structure  with  an  eigenvalue  above  1.00  was 
obtained,  explaining  60.48%  of  the  total  variance.  It  is 
necessary to evaluate whether the factor structure can be 

Sen et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2024) 24:89 

Page 9 of 11

of 60.48% in the study was explained by the "Discrimina-
tion and Prejudice" factor and 25.752% by the "Labeling" 
factor.  It  is  stated  in  the  literature  that  the  variance  of 
the  scale  should  be  between  40–60%  [30].  In  our  study, 
a total variance of 60.48% was obtained and was found to 
be sufficient.

In  the  final  stage  of  EFA,  factors  are  named  by  look-
ing  at  the  content  of  the  items.  This  naming  process  is 
called  "labeling".  In  our  study,  by  looking  at  the  items 
in the factors, the first factor was named "Prejudice and 
Discrimination" and the second factor was named "Labe-
ling".  Factor  1’s  higher  stigma  burden  and  behavioral 
components led it to be named "Prejudice and Discrimi-
nation". Despite this, the term "Labeling", which emerged 
as the first component of stigma, was deemed appropri-
ate  since  the  2nd  Factor  contains  negative  expressions 
related  to  stigma,  but  contains  more  accepting  and  less 
certain approaches. The statement "If we were to explain 
the term stigma on a level plane, the first step would be 
labeling and the last step would be discrimination", men-
tioned in an article, guided us in naming [2].

In  scale  development  studies,  it  is  recommended  to 
perform  CFA  after  EFA.  CFA  provides  strong  evidence 
to support the validity of the factor structure of a meas-
ure  [18].  The  accuracy  of  the  hypotheses  obtained  with 
CFA  is  tested  [31].  CFA  should  be  applied  after  exam-
ining  whether  the  data  is  normally  distributed  or  not. 
In  our  study,  the  normality  distribution  of  the  data  was 
examined  with  the  Kolmogorov–Smirnov  test.  P  value 
was found to be 0.200, p > 0.05, and the data show normal 
distribution.

Structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  is  an  analysis 
method  that  combines  multivariate  regression  analy-
sis  and  factor  analysis.  With  SEM,  statements  that  are 
hypothesized to exist theoretically are verified [16]. CFA 
is an example of a type of SEM that deals with the rela-
tionships  between  observed  measurements  and  latent 
variables  or  factors.  The  fact  that  the  fit  index  values 
calculated  during  CFA  are  within  the  recommended 
range  indicates  that  the  developed  hypothesis  is  correct 
[18].  In  SEM  fit  index  values, < 3  for  CMIN/df  indicates 
ideal result, < 5 indicates acceptable fit; For NFI, CFI, IFI, 
TLI, > 0.90  indicates  good  fit;  For  RMSEA, < 0.05  indi-
cates ideal result, < 0.08 indicates good fit, < 0.10 indicates 
acceptable fit [19]. In our study, CMIN/df was calculated 
as 2.653, NFI 0.846, CFI 0.896, IFI 0.898, TLI 0.871, AIC 
570.396, RMSEA 0.080, and since these values are within 
the desired range, they indicate acceptable fit. As a result 
of the first level CFA results and fit indices, no items were 
removed from the scale.

For the correlation of the developed scale, the responses 
given to the SDS and BMI, whose validity and reliability 
have been proven regarding stigma, were compared with

reduced with the scree plot test. In the graph created by 
the  Scree  Plot  test,  the  number  of  factors  is  decided  by 
looking at how many factors there are until the first sharp 
change. Since the first sharp change in the graph was in 
the 2nd factor, the number of factors was accepted as 2. 
Factor analysis was repeated after oblimin rotation appli-
cation. A 2-subdimensional scale with an eigenvalue over 
1.00 was obtained, explaining 60.48% of the total variance 
in PMISS. It was found that 34.729% of the total variance

the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient.  A  positive  correla-
tion was found between the participants’ responses to the 
scales. The positive correlation between the three scales 
indicates that as the scores from the scales increase, the 
level of stigmatization increases and similar results occur.
Invariance  over  time  was  measured  by  the  test–retest 
method.  The  fact  that  the  results  of  two  measurements 
made at different times are similar indicates that the scale 
is invariant over time. It is stated that for the test–retest 
method, the scale should be re-applied to at least 30 peo-
ple with an interval of 2–4 weeks [20]. It is recommended 
that  the  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  between  two 
measurements be over 0.70 [21]. In accordance with the 
literature,  the  test  was  repeated  on  30  volunteers  every 
3  weeks.  The  correlation  coefficient  between  the  meas-
urements  was  found  to  be  0.916.  This  value  shows  that 
the principle of invariance against time is met.

Conclusion
As a result, it has been determined that PMISS is a valid and 
reliable measurement tool in determining the stigmatization 
attitudes  of  Turkish  society  towards  women  with  mental 
illness in the perinatal period. Our study was conducted in 
a heterogeneous group, and the stigma level of homogene-
ous subgroups may also be the subject of research. With the 
scale  we  developed,  stigmatization  towards  others,  that  is, 
social stigma, was measured. Social stigma is an important 
indicator of internalized stigma, and different scales exam-
ining internal stigma may also need to be developed.
