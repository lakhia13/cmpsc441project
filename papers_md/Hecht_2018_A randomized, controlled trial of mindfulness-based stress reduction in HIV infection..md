Abstract

Objective: Evidence links depression and stress to more rapid progression of HIV-1 disease. We 
conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether an intervention aimed at improving stress 
management and emotion regulation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), would improve 
immunological (i.e. CD4+ t-cell counts) and psychological outcomes in persons with HIV-1 
infection.

Methods: We randomly assigned participants with HIV-1 infection and CD4 T-cell counts > 350 
cells/μl who were not on antiretroviral therapy in a 1:1 ratio to either an MBSR group (n=89) or an 
HIV disease self-management skills group (n=88). The study was conducted at the University of 
California at San Francisco. We assessed immunologic (CD4, c-reactive protein, IL-6, and d-
dimer) and psychological measures (Beck Depression Inventory for depression, modified 
Differential Emotions Scale for positive and negative affect, Perceived stress-scale, and 
mindfulness) at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of the intervention; we used multiple imputation 
to address missing values.

Results: We observed statistically significant improvements from baseline to 3-months within 
the MBSR group in depression, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, and mindfulness; 
between group differences in change were significantly greater in the MBSR group only for 
positive affect (per item difference on DES-positive 0.25, 95% CI 0.049, 0.44, p = .015). By 12

months the between group difference in positive affect was not statistically significant, although 
both groups had trends toward improvements compared to baseline in several psychological 
outcomes that were maintained at 12-months; these improvements were only statistically 
significant for depression and negative affect in the MBSR group and perceived stress for the 
control group. The groups did not differ significantly on rates of antiretroviral therapy initiation 
(MBSR = 39%, control = 29%, p = .22). After 12 months, the mean decrease in CD4+ T-cell count 
was 49.6 cells/μl in participants in the MBSR arm, compared to 54.2 cells/μl in the control group, 
a difference of 4.6 cells favoring the MBSR group (95% CI, −44.6, 53.7, p=.85). The between 
group differences in other immunologic-related outcomes (c-reactive protein, IL-6, HIV-1 viral 
load, and d-dimer) were not statistically significant at any time point.

Conclusions: MBSR improved positive affect more than an active control arm in the 3 months 
following the start of the intervention. However, this difference was not maintained over the 12-
month follow-up and there were no significant differences in immunologic outcomes between 
intervention groups. These results emphasize the need for further carefully designed research if we 
are to translate evidence linking psychological states to immunological outcomes into evidence-
based clinical practices.

Introduction

Despite significant treatment advances, HIV remains a stressful chronic illness for many and 
is associated with elevated levels of depression.1,2 Stress and depression in HIV are of 
concern not only because of the deleterious effects on quality of life, but because they are 
associated with adverse sequelae, including poorer treatment adherence,3,4 increased risk 
behaviors for HIV transmission,5,6 and potentially more rapid disease progression.7,8 Burack 
and colleagues found that in a cohort of men with HIV in the pre-highly active antiretroviral 
era, those with depression had a 38% greater decline in CD4 cells compared with men who 
were not depressed.7 In a large cohort study of women with HIV, the HIV Epidemiology 
Research Study (HERS), participants with chronic depressive symptoms had more rapid 
declines in CD4+ T-cell counts, and were two times more likely to die compared to women 
with few or no depressive symptoms, after controlling for other prognostic factors.8 Positive 
psychological states such as positive affect9 and optimism10 are associated with lower risk of 
mortality among people with HIV, better engagement with care after diagnosis, and greater 
likelihood of achieving viral suppression when taking antiretroviral therapy.11,12 Although 
the advent of highly effective antiretroviral therapy has dramatically altered the risk of 
mortality in HIV infection, engagement in care is critical in obtaining the benefits of 
treatment, and thus interventions that reduce stress, depression, and negative affect, and 
increase positive affect likely still provide people living with HIV with multiple benefits.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a standardized 8-week program that 
incorporates several meditation components. It teaches skills to increase awareness and 
acceptance of moment-to-moment experiences, including difficult emotions and physical 
discomfort. It is increasing available in many locations in the United States and other 
countries (including major medical centers), and has well-developed programs to train group 
leaders, which means that it can be readily disseminated for conditions in which it is shown 
to be effective. Studies have found MBSR to be an effective component of managing various 
medical conditions, including chronic pain. Accumulating evidence suggests MBSR is also 
effective in decreasing depression and perceived stress and increasing positive affect in 
general populations13 as well as among people coping with significant life stress14 including 
HIV.15,16 Gayner et al. found that HIV-positive participants randomized to MBSR had 
significantly lower levels of negative affect and depression and significantly higher levels of 
positive affect over a 6-month follow-up compared to participants in a usual care control 
condition.15

The hallmark of HIV-1 disease progression is the depletion of CD4+ T-cells, and this is the 
key immune measure used to stage disease in HIV-1 clinical management.17 Normal levels 
are above 500 cells/μl, and serious HIV-1 related opportunistic infections are extremely rare 
until CD4+ T-cells fall below 200 cells/μl. 17 Some evidence suggests MBSR may improve 
CD4+ T cell counts, which would be an important immunological benefit. Creswell, Myers, 
Cole, and Irwin demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial that participants with HIV 
receiving MBSR had a mean increase of 20 CD4+ T-cells/μl compared to a mean decrease of 
185 CD4+ T-cells/μl in the control condition (a one-day stress reduction workshop). 18 
SeyedAlingaghi et al. conducted a randomized trial of MBSR compared to an education 
control condition in people with HIV.19 Intent-to-treat analysis were not reported but among 
participants who completed at least 75% of the sessions, participants in the MBSR group 
showed improvements in physical and psychological symptoms relative to an education 
control condition. They also reported between-group difference in change in CD4+ T-cell 
counts with the MBSR group showing significant improvements, although the control 
condition had significantly higher CD4 count at baseline.

While these prior studies provide intriguing evidence suggesting benefits of MBSR in HIV, 
important methodological concerns limit the conclusions that can be made from these trials. 
None of these prior trials controlled for the amount of attention in a group setting that 
MBSR provides, making it unclear whether the observed benefits were due to the content 
delivered to the MBSR group or the benefits of being in a group setting. Secondly, the 
statistically significant effects of MBSR on CD4+ T-cell counts reported in the Creswell and 
SeyedAlingaghi trials were based on per protocol analyses rather than intent to treat, and 
both had high rates of drop-out. In addition, to our knowledge, prior studies have not 
reported the effects of MBSR on inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, IL-6, and D-dimer. 
These inflammatory markers are particularly relevant in HIV-1 infection that is not fully 
suppressed by effective antiretroviral therapy, as these markers are typically elevated well 
above levels in a healthy population,20 and are strongly predictive of adverse clinical 
outcomes, including cardiovascular events and death.21 Links between stress and some of 
these inflammatory markers22 also support the important of testing whether an intervention 
aimed at reducing stress improves these measures.

To better assess the effects of MBSR on perceived stress, negative affect, depression, 
positive affect, rate of disease progression, and inflammatory markers in people living with 
HIV, we performed a randomized, controlled trial with an attention-matched control 
condition. We aimed for high rates of participant retention and employed intent-to-treat 
analyses to address some of the limitations of prior studies. The trial was initiated at a time 
when antiretroviral therapy was frequently deferred until the CD4+ fell below 350 cells/μl, 
and we restricted enrollment to persons not on antiviral therapy to assess the effects of the 
intervention on immunologic outcomes in HIV in the absence of treatment. Participants 
were followed for 12 months from the start of the intervention to track the durability of 
intervention effects. We hypothesized that participants in the MBSR condition would show 
slower rates of CD4 cell decline, decreased depression, negative affect, and perceived stress, 
and increased positive affect compared to participants in the control condition.

Methods

Design Overview:

This was a single center, randomized controlled parallel trial comparing a standard MBSR 
course that met weekly for eight weeks to an educational course in HIV that met for the 
same number of sessions and was designed to control for the group attention in MBSR. 
Given the need for active involvement in group activities, participants and staff were aware 
of group assignments. All participants were HIV-1 seropositive. Follow-up for outcome 
assessment was continued for 12 months from the start of the intervention groups. 
Enrollment began July 2005 and follow-up was complete in September 2009. The protocol 
was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Research Board. 
All participants gave written, informed consent prior to performing any study procedures.

Participants:

We recruited participants who were 18 years of age or older with HIV-1 infection. The 
primary study outcome was to assess whether MBSR influenced the rate of decline of CD4+ 
T-cells, a key measure of disease progression in HIV. We thus aimed to enroll people who 
were not on antiretroviral therapy and did not have a high likelihood of starting within the 
next 12 months so that we could assess the effect of MBSR on immune measures 
independent of antiretroviral therapy, which typically raises CD4+ T-cell counts 
substantially. When the study began, treatment guidelines recommended that antiretroviral 
therapy should be initiated before the CD4+ T-cell count decreased below 200 cells/µl, and 
should be considered in asymptomatic persons with a CD4+ T-cell count below 350 cells/µl.
23 To avoid enrolling persons who met clear criteria for initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
when the study began, we excluded persons with a CD4+ T cell count of ≤ 250 cells/µl. 
HIV-1 infection was established by history, confirmed by an HIV-1 RNA level of > 100 
copies on laboratory testing. Participants could not have used antiretrovirals in the 120 days 
prior to enrollment to ensure that CD4+ T cell counts had not fallen lower than 250 cells/µl 
within a short period. Participants were asked not to enroll if they had pre-existing plans to 
start therapy before the end of follow-up in 12 months, but were informed that once they 
were enrolled in the study, decisions about initiating antiretroviral therapy were up to them 
and their doctor, and there would be no consequences in regard to study participation. We

used broad recruitment methods including posting flyers, advertisements in local papers and 
internet sites, and outreach to HIV medical specialists.

Randomization and blinding:

Using a computer-generated randomization list, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 
ratio using random block sizes of 4–7 to one of the two treatment groups. We used random 
block sizes to prevent anticipation of treatment assignment and achieve approximately equal 
group sizes for each wave of the intervention. A database manager generated the 
randomization sequence with guidance from a study statistician (PB). The database 
manager, who was otherwise not involved in enrollment, programmed the sequence into a 
Microsoft Access database. No other study staff had access to the randomization sequence 
file. Approximately two weeks prior to class start, when participants had completed all 
enrollment steps, the study Project Director (PM, who was blinded to the block sizes) 
accessed the allocation sequence using a programmed database that could not be altered 
once randomized condition was revealed. Due to limitations in staff size, it was not feasible 
for assessors to be blinded to treatment allocation. However, with the exception of the 
current medications and brief medical symptoms and conditions interview, all of the 
psychological measures were done using computer assisted self-interviewing. Personnel 
performing laboratory assays were masked to group assignment.

Interventions:

The MBSR group used a standard eight-week, manualized course24 that provides systematic 
training in mindfulness meditation as a self-regulation approach to stress reduction and 
medical and psychological symptoms 25,26. The course consists of eight weekly classes of 
2.5 hours duration (except for the first session, which lasts 3 hours); an 8-hour silent retreat 
during the sixth week of the program; and assignments for home practice. Content includes 
body scan meditation, gentle yoga focused on body awareness, sitting meditation, and 
practices that can be used during daily life to be mindful of stress and emotional state before 
reacting as well as assignments for 45 minutes per day of meditation and yoga practice 6 
days per week for the duration of the course.

The education/control group consisted of 8 weekly group sessions of approximately 1.5 
hours each week that covered a variety of educational topics about managing HIV infection. 
Examples of topics covered included how to work with your doctor effectively, how to 
interpret common laboratory tests used to follow HIV infection, and how to manage HIV 
disclosure and other issues in sexual relationships. The groups were based in part on 
successful seminars performed by an HIV advocacy and information community-based 
organization in San Francisco, Project Inform, and taught by an experienced group leader 
who had helped develop these seminars. The goal of the education group was to control for 
social attention and group interaction time in the MBSR groups, and to make attendance at 
comparison group sessions attractive. While the education group met for less total time than 
the MBSR group, MBSR included time for meditation practice in which there was no 
interaction among the group members, and it was felt that using identical meeting lengths 
would lead to more group interaction time in the comparison group.

There were eight waves of MBSR and education control groups held during the study. The 
MBSR groups were taught by five different MBSR leaders; each of the control groups was 
led by the same leader. The MBSR group leaders had to have had formal teacher training 
and prior experience in leading MBSR groups. In addition, teachers were observed leading 
MBSR sessions by our lead MBSR instructor (KB) before selection for this study to insure 
all study instructors were highly skilled. The control group leader had over five years of 
experience leading HIV education groups.

Measures

Study assessments were conducted at baseline, post intervention (3 months post baseline), 6 
months, and 12 months at the University of California San Francisco. In addition, CD4+ T-
cell count and viral load, but not other measures, were obtained at 9 months. Audio 
Computer-Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) was used to administer the psychological 
measures as well as to collect detailed demographic and background information including 
race/ethnicity, age, and gender. Trained research assistants collected health history and 
medication information using a standardized questionnaire. Study nurses, blind to 
participant group assignment, completed all blood draws. Blood draws were performed in 
the morning between 8 am and 11 am. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on CD4+ 
T-cell counts, we aimed to schedule participants within plus or minus one hour of the 
baseline measurement time. To provide better precision of the baseline CD4+ T-cell count 
measure, we also performed two measures prior to the intervention, about two weeks apart, 
and averaged them to obtain a baseline value. CD4+ T-cell counts were obtained by standard 
flow cytometry methods, and calculated by multiplying the proportion of lymphocytes that 
were CD4+ by the total lymphocyte count measured by a Coulter counter. HIV-1 viral load 
was measured using polymerase chain reaction (Roche Molecular Diagnostics Amplicor 
Monitor 1.5). We selected serologic markers related to inflammation to measure based on 
prior studies that have identified which markers are most strongly associated with increased 
risk of death in untreated or undertreated HIV-1 infection: IL-6, CRP, and D-dimer.21 were 
measured at the Penn State University College of Medicine Core Reference Laboratory 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from the following manufacturers: 
high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ALPCO; D-dimer, American Diagnostica; and 
Interleukin 6 (IL-6), R & D systems.

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)27, a widely used instrument in depression outcome 
studies, was used to measure depression symptoms over the past week. Past-week positive 
and negative affect were measured using a modified version of the Differential Emotions 
Scale (DES) 28 that assessed nine positive emotions (amused, awe, content, glad, grateful, 
hopeful, interested,love, and pride) and eight negative emotions (angry, ashamed, contempt, 
disgust, embarrassed, repentant, sad, and scared). Participants rated how frequently they felt 
that particular emotion in the past week on a 5-point scale: 0=never to 4=most of the time. 
We inadvertently omitted the contempt item on the negative affect sub-scale of the mDES 
from the initial questionnaire, which was not discovered part way through the study; as a 
result, this item was included for 35% of the participants in the baseline evaluations and 
75% of participants at the 12 month follow-up. Our results report an average score of the 
items obtained. Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen

& Nast, 1988). This 10-item measure assesses the degree to which situations in one’s life are 
appraised as stressful, including how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded 
respondents find their lives. We assessed four of the five subscales of the Five Factor 
Mindfulness Questionnaire29 using an abbreviated version of the measure that included 4 
facets: observing, describing, attention/awareness, and nonjudging. The fifth factor of this 
questionnaire had not been developed when we started the study. We examined the four 
subscales individually and as part of an overall mindfulness construct (α = .86).

Statistical Methods:

Our primary analysis was intent-to-treat. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was 
rate of decline in CD4+ T-cells. The psychological measures presented here, HIV-1 viral 
load, and markers of inflammatory state (hsCRP and d-dimer) were key secondary outcome 
measures. For sample size estimates, based on prior studies we estimated that the average 
decline in CD4+ T-cells in the control group would be 64 cells/µl per year, with a SD of 72 
cells/µl. Given a sample size of 88 persons per group, we would have 80% power to detect a 
statistically significant difference between groups if the MBSR group had a 30 cell/µl or 
greater difference in CD4+ T-cell count decline. To assess outcome measures, we used 
multiple imputation to replace missing data, based on guidelines for reporting and 
interpreting results of multiple imputation analyses.30 Missing data were handled using SAS 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) procedures PROC MI and MIANALYZE. Imputation models 
for each outcome variable included treatment arm and values at other timepoints. One 
hundred data sets were imputed for each outcome using the fully conditional specification 
method with predictive mean matching. Independent-groups t tests on change scores were 
done using SAS PROC REG. Because of the profound effects of treatment on CD4+ T-
counts, immunological and viral load data were censored following initiation of 
antiretroviral therapy if this occurred, and multiple imputation was used to address the 
missing data; psychological outcomes were not censored when antiretroviral therapy was 
been initiated as we did not expect a significant effect of antiretroviral therapy on these 
measures.

We randomized 177 participants to either the MBSR (N = 89) or education control (N = 88) 
group (see Figure 1). Participants were 97% male or male-to-female transgender (n=1) and 
slightly over half were white (62%) (Table 1). These demographics are similar to those of 
the HIV epidemic in San Francisco, which were 94% male or transgender, and 61% white at 
the time the study was performed. Randomization achieved a similar distribution of 
demographic, laboratory, and psychological measures between the MBSR and education 
control groups at baseline (Table 1).

Seventy-three percent of the MBSR and 62% of the education control group completed 6 or 
more of the sessions. Overall, we retained 82% of the sample for the entire 12 months of the 
study (Figure 1). Participants who dropped out of the study did not differ significantly in 
baseline demographic, health, or other characteristics from those who completed the study. 
The intervention groups did not differ significantly in the proportion that initiated

antiretroviral therapy over the course of the follow-up. At 3 months from the start of the 
intervention period, 5% of the MBSR group participants, and 4% of the control group had 
started antiretroviral therapy. At 12 months, the proportions who had started antiretroviral 
therapy were 39% and 29%, respectively (p > .2 for both comparisons).

Declines in CD4+ T-cells were similar in both intervention groups (Table 2, Figure 2). After 
12 months, the mean decrease in CD4+ T-cell count among persons who did not initiate anti-
retroviral therapy was 55.4 cells/μl in participants in the MBSR arm, compared to 62.5 cells/
μl in the control group, a non-significant difference of 7.0 cells/μl favoring the MBSR group 
(95% CI, −61.1, 47.1, p=.80). Using multiple imputation to estimate values of CD4+ T-cells 
in all participants resulted in similar findings, with a 4.6 cells/μl difference favoring the 
MBSR group (p = .85, Table 2). Although HIV-1 viral load increased slightly more in the 
control group over 12 months compared to the MBSR group in persons who did not start 
anti-retroviral therapy, with a difference of −0.11 copies/ml log10, this was not statistically 
significant (95% CI −0.32, 0.10, p = .30); we obtained similar results using multiple 
imputation for missing data, with a −0.086 copies/ml log10 difference favoring the MBSR 
group (p = .39, Table 2). We did not observe statistically significant differences in 
inflammation related measures, including hsCRP, IL-6, and d-dimer between intervention 
groups (Table 2).

To address the question of whether participants who were experiencing greater stress or 
depression at the start of the intervention might have greater benefit from MBSR, we 
conducted additional analyses of outcomes presented in Table 2 on three subgroups: (1) 
those with a score of ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory (consistent with mild or greater 
depression),31 (2) those with a score of ≥ 14 on the Perceived Stress Scale (representing a 
score above the mean in a typical US population),32 and (3) Perceived Stress Scale ≥ 27, 
which has been suggested as a cut-off for high perceived stress. None of these analyses 
suggested particular benefits for MBSR on CD4 count or HIV viral load in the defined sub-
groups. For example, in the 69 MBSR participants and 67 control participants with 
Perceived Stress Scale score ≥ 14, there was a 16 cell/μl greater drop in CD4 T cell count in 
the MBSR group at 3 months (95% CI 61 cell greater decrease, 30 cell increase), and a 13 
cell/μl lesser drop at 12 months (95% CI 43 cell greater decrease, 69 cell increase). P-values 
for all comparisons in change in CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load between MBSR and 
control groups for each sub-group we assessed were > .4 at 3 and 12 months.

We also assessed changes in psychological measures from baseline between groups, both at 
3 months following the intensive intervention period, and at 12 months to assess longer-term 
effects. Within the MBSR group, depressive symptoms, positive affect, and perceived stress 
all improved significantly from baseline to 3 months (see Table 2). While many of these 
measures also tended to improve in the control group, none of these measures had 
statistically significant changes from baseline within the control group. The increase in 
positive affect was significantly greater in the MBSR group compared to the control from 
baseline to 3 months (Table 2).

Within the MBSR group, the overall mindfulness measure increased between the study 
baseline and month 3, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with attention/awareness,

nonjudging of inner experience, and describing all improved significantly at 3 months (Table 
2). These changes were maintained at 12 months of follow-up. Compared to the control 
condition, only nonjudging of inner experience increased significantly more in the MBSR 
group, however.

We assessed practice of both formal (sitting meditation) and informal (use of mindfulness 
during daily life) practice during and after the main intervention period within the group that 
received the MBSR intervention (Table 3). We found that there was a decrease in both 
formal and informal practice between 3 months (shortly after the MBSR program ended) 
and 6 months, but that both formal and informal practice remained stable between 6 and 12 
months. At 12 months, 44% of MBSR group participants reported continued formal 
meditation practice, with at least one sitting meditation in the past week, and 69% reported 
use of informal mindfulness practices in the past week.

Discussion

We compared the effect of MBSR, a meditation-based program aimed at improved 
management of stress and emotion, to an HIV self-management group that controlled for the 
effects of being in a group program, on immunologic and psychological outcomes in people 
with HIV infection. We performed the trial at a time when recommendations for 
antiretroviral therapy considered delaying treatment initiation until CD4 T-cell counts fell 
below 350 cells/μl an acceptable treatment option; we enrolled participants with CD4 T-cell 
counts above this threshold who were not on antiretroviral therapy. We hypothesized that the 
MBSR group would show slower declines in CD4 T-cell counts, based on prior data showing 
an association of more rapid HIV disease progression with depression and stress. As the 
most recent recommendations for initiating HIV treatment now call for considering 
treatment as soon as HIV is diagnosed, the question of whether stress reduction 
interventions can delay the need for antiretroviral therapy no longer has the same treatment 
implications. Understanding the potential immune effects of mindfulness-based 
interventions, however, has important implications for other conditions, such as whether 
such an intervention may be useful in strengthening immune defenses to other viral 
illnesses.

Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that over a 12-month period, there was no evidence of 
lower loss of CD4 T-cells in the MBSR group. We assessed differences in CD4 T-cell counts 
at 3 month from study initiation to assess intervention effects on CD4+ T-cells immediately 
after the 2-month MBSR course. As CD4 T-cell count declines tend to be slow in HIV, we 
also hypothesized that a longer duration of follow-up out to 12-months might reveal trends 
in CD4+ T-cell loss that could take longer to become apparent. However, we found no time 
point that clearly favored the MBSR group. Our results contrast with those of two prior 
studies of MBSR in people living with HIV. Creswell and colleagues reported that in a 
randomized, controlled trial of MBSR compared to a 1-day control seminar, there was a 
significant time x treatment interaction on CD4 T-cell counts favoring the MBSR group at 
the end of the 8-week MBSR program in the 48 persons who attended groups in either arm.

improvements in CD4 T-cell counts in the MBSR group at 3, 6, and 9 months of follow-up, 
though by 12 months CD4 counts were almost identical to baseline in both groups.19

Differences in control group design may account for some of the differences in results. We 
compared MBSR to a control group that met for the same number of sessions (8) to control 
for the effect of attending a group with other persons with HIV. The Creswell et al. study 
used a control group consisting of a day-long seminar with information, instruction, and 
introduction to the same mindfulness practices as in the 8-week program, but had no further 
meetings and participants were not encouraged to engage in any further practice. In the 
SeyedAlinaghi et al. study, control participants met twice in small groups for a total of 2 
hours to receive educational information. Our control group may have been more closely 
matched to the MBSR group, and perhaps it even exceeded the effects of MBSR groups in 
providing interaction with other people with HIV. Other studies have suggested that group 
interaction may provide significant psychological and even health benefits for people with 
other medical conditions, such as breast cancer 33. Similar group support effects may have 
been responsible for some of the positive effects of the MBSR program in other studies.

Several other issues suggest the need for caution in interpreting CD4 T-cell count results 
from these earlier trials, however. In the Creswell et al. study, the difference in CD4 T-cell 
counts between groups was primarily driven by a drop of 185 cells/μl over 8 weeks in the 
comparison group.18 This CD4 T-cell count drop is much larger than would be expected 
over a two-month period based on other studies. For example, in the START trial, which 
randomized persons with early asymptomatic HIV to immediate or deferred antiretroviral 
treatment, CD4 T-cells in the deferred treatment group (n=2359) declined on average less 
than 100 cells/μl over a 12-month period, or approximately half the decline over a 6 times 
longer follow-up period than that observed in the Creswell study. Given the well-known 
variability in CD4 T-cells count measurements34,35 and the small sample size in the 
Creswell study, this suggests that at least part of the difference observed may have been due 
to chance variation in CD4 count measurements. This is further supported by the fact that 
the statistically significant difference in CD4 counts was only found in an analysis in which 
11 of the 26 persons randomized to the control group were excluded due to non-participation 
in the 1-day workshop. In intent to treat analysis in which all randomized persons were 
included, differences in CD4 counts were no longer statistically significant. In the 
SeyedAlinaghi et al. study, randomization did not achieve well-matched baseline CD4 
counts between groups.19 CD4 counts in the MBSR group at baseline were 100 cells/μl 
lower in the control group (p < .001). Although CD4 counts increased in the MBSR group, 
mean counts in the MBSR group were lower than the control group throughout the trial. The 
baseline difference was almost certainly due to chance rather than some error in the 
randomization process, as the authors acknowledged, but the magnitude of this imbalance 
makes it more difficult to interpret the observed differences in CD4 counts following MBSR. 
Because of the known variability of CD4 count measures, we used two baseline 
measurements performed on different days and averaged them. We also used a protocol in 
which blood was obtained within a similar two-hour period in the morning each time to limit 
diurnal variation. These steps may have resulted in a more precise estimate of baseline CD4 
counts than in prior studies.

Given the sample size and the methodological rigor of our study, which included high 
retention rates and a control group that was carefully matched for instructor attention and 
social interaction, we believe our results provide fairly strong evidence against the 
suggestion from earlier studies that MBSR can significantly improve CD4 counts in HIV, at 
least in comparison to an attention-matched control group. We also did not find evidence of 
significant benefits of MBSR for other immunologically related outcomes, including HIV-1 
viral load, IL-6, hsCRP, or d-dimer levels. While these results do not apply directly to other 
conditions, they suggest caution in interpreting some of the potential benefits of 
mindfulness-based interventions for improving immune function, and underline the need for 
high-quality trials to evaluate these potential benefits before they can be translated into 
clinical practice.

In contrast to the immunological outcomes, we found stronger evidence of benefits of 
MBSR in psychological outcomes. At three months from the initiation of MBSR groups 
(about 1 month after completion of the 8-week course), we observed statistically significant 
improvements from baseline within the MBSR group in depression (as measured by the 
BDI), positive affect, perceived stress, and mindfulness. The control group, however, also 
experienced improvements in many of these measures as well, suggesting that some of the 
benefit may have been due to the effects of meeting in a group with other people with the 
same health condition. When the MBSR group was compared to the active control group, we 
observed statistically significant improvements in changes in positive affect in the MBSR 
group at 3 months. This improvement has potential implications for overall health,36–38 as 
well as for improved psychological health. A recent meta-analysis found insufficient 
evidence of effects of meditation on positive affect to determine whether it is of benefit in 
this regard. 39 Our results suggest that MBSR does, in fact, improve positive affect. Given 
growing evidence that positive affect has unique beneficial psychological and physical 
health benefits,40 independent of negative affect, research regarding MBSR effects on 
psychological well-being is worth pursuing.

While MBSR programs are thought to have benefits beyond the end of the intervention, the 
durability of effects has not been assessed in many studies. This has been raised as an 
important limitation of earlier research on MBSR41 and was one of the reasons we 
performed 12-month follow-up in our study. At 12 months after the beginning of the study 
intervention period, some of the psychological benefits observed in the MBSR group began 
waning. Of note, the improvement in depression, as measured by the BDI, remained stable 
and statistically significant compared with baseline within the MBSR group. In comparisons 
between the MBSR and control groups at 12 months, however, none of the improvements in 
psychological outcome measures were statistically significant, in part due to improvements 
in psychological outcome measures in the control group. We found some decrease in the 
amount of both formal and informal meditation practices between our assessment one month 
after the MBSR course (3 month time point) and 3 months later (the 6 month time point), 
but stable practice over the next six months. The decrease in practice after the initial 
intervention might account for some decreases in psychological benefits, but we found that 
nearly 70% of participants reported on-going use of informal practices and 44% reported 
sitting meditation at 12 months, indicating that the initial training resulted in a substantial 
frequency of on-going practice throughout the study period. In addition, we did not find any

statistically significant differences in outcomes when comparing the MBSR participants who 
practiced formal meditation at 12 months versus those that did not. While the durability of 
the effect on depression is encouraging, we believe that the overall waning of effects in the 
MBSR group suggests that further research may be needed to optimize MBSR-based 
intervention programs if the goal is long-term maintenance of psychological benefits, such 
as testing of maintenance strategies, longer-duration MBSR, or perhaps identifying which 
elements of MBSR led to longer term benefit, and augmenting them in the program.

While we believe this study is a more definitive assessment of the effects of MBSR in HIV 
infection than prior studies, there are several limitations. Our sample size was not large 
enough to exclude a modest benefit in CD4+ T-cell counts, so our evidence of lack of 
immunologic benefit from MBSR must be interpreted with some caution. We used a very 
active control group, which may have provided an even greater opportunity for social 
interaction than in the MBSR groups. For many participants, this was their first experience 
of openly discussing their HIV status with other people living with HIV. Anecdotally, many 
comparison group participants found the groups very beneficial, and our data suggest that 
there were significant psychological benefits, as evidenced by statistically significant within-
group improvements in depression and perceived stress at 12-months, compared to baseline. 
The benefits of group participation may be important to consider when the alternative to an 
MBSR group is no group, as is true in most clinical practice settings. In this context, the 
comparison with an active control group is likely to underestimate the overall psychological 
benefits of MBSR participation for people with HIV when compared with usual care.

In conclusion, we did not find evidence of immunological benefits of MBSR in people with 
HIV-1 who were not on anti-retroviral therapy, when compared with an active control group. 
We did find evidence of psychological benefits of MBSR at 3 months from intervention 
initiation, but some benefits tended to wane by 12 months. Overall, these results emphasize 
the need for further carefully designed research if we are to translate evidence linking 
psychological states to immunological outcomes into evidence-based clinical practices. Our 
results support some of the psychological benefits of mindfulness-based interventions, but 
suggest that maintenance of effects may be an important challenge to address in future 
research.

MBSR improved positive affect in HIV, compared to an active control

Psychological benefits did not translate into improved immunological 
outcomes.

Some psychological benefits waned within 10 months after MBSR was 
completed.

= Within group differences with p-values < .05 are designated with an asterisk.

Notes (Table 2): Changes are calculated as the Baseline value minus the follow-up time point. The difference represents the MBSR group minus the 
Control group. Multiple imputation was used to estimate missing values. P-values are derived from independent sample t tests. mo = months; BDI 
= Beck depression inventory; DES = Differential Emotions Scale (see methods for modifications); hsCRP = high sensitivity C-reactive protein. 
Acting with awareness, non-judging observing, and describing represent sub-scales of the mindfulness measure. When this study was initiated, the 
fifth facet on the current Five Facet Mindfulness Scale, nonjudging, had not been included in the measure. 29
