Abstract

Several cross-sectional studies have documented neuroanatomical changes in individuals with a long history of meditation,
while a few evidences are available about the interaction between neuroanatomical and psychological changes even during
brief exposure to meditation. Here we analyzed several morphometric indexes at both cortical and subcortical brain level, as
well as multiple psychological dimensions, before and after a brief -8 weeks- Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
training program, in a group of 23 meditation naı¨ve-subjects compared to age-gender matched subjects. We found a
significant cortical thickness increase in the right insula and the somatosensory cortex of MBSR trainees, coupled with a
significant reduction of several psychological indices related to worry, state anxiety, depression and alexithymia. Most
importantly, an interesting correlation between the increase in right insula thickness and the decrease in alexithymia levels
during the MBSR training were observed. Moreover, a multivariate pattern classification approach allowed to identify a
cluster of regions more responsive to MBSR training across subjects. Taken together, these findings documented the
significant impact of a brief MBSR training on brain structures, as well as stressing the idea of MBSR as a valuable tool for
alexithymia modulation, also originally providing a plausible neurobiological evidence of a major role of right insula into
mediating the observed psychological changes.

Introduction

Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a mindfulness
meditation-based program in which participants are invited to
connect with their physical sensations, perceptions, emotions,
cognitions and behaviour, over a period of 8 weeks, with a ‘‘non-
judgmental’’ attitude [1,2]. In general, mindfulness meditation
based programs lead to changes in the attitude of the practitioners
towards their thoughts, sensations and emotions. This can be
considered useful
in reducing stress symptoms in non-clinical
populations [3,4] and may help patients cope with a wide variety
of clinical conditions, such as anxiety [5,6], depression [7,8],
substance abuse [9] and chronic pain [10].

A growing body of literature has proposed possible neuroan-
atomical changes due to mindfulness and other meditation style
trainings, mainly using a cross-sectional approach. For instance,
almost ten years ago Lazar and colleagues [11] have originally
reported a significant increase of cortical thickness in the right
insula and frontal lobes of expert meditators (insight meditation),
by the means of surface-based cortical thickness measurement.
Afterwards, other studies using voxel based morphometry (VBM)
have suggested an increase of grey matter (volume or concentra-

tion) in different brain regions, following long-term meditation:
Ho¨lzel and colleagues documented changes in the right hippo-

lobe after ‘‘Insight

changes in left superior and inferior frontal gyrus, cerebellum
and left
fusiform gyrus in Tibetan Buddhist meditators [13];
Luders et al. found changes in right orbito-frontal cortex, right
thalamus, left inferior temporal lobe and right hippocampus in
Zen, Vipassana or Samatha practitioners [14]; Grant et al. found
differences in right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and secondary
somatosensory cortex in Zen meditators [15]. Due to the cross-
sectional nature of these studies, no causal relationship between
meditation practice and brain anatomical changes can be drawn.
Moreover,
it is worthwhile to note that all these studies were
conducted on expert meditators belonging to different traditions.
These may include focused attention meditation, which involves
moment by moment selective attention focused on a particular
object (e.g., sensations associated with the breath or body), or open
monitoring meditation, which involves an open awareness of any
stimuli that occur in the present moment, but there are also
meditation practices that use mantras or visualizations. It
is
evidently impossible to generalize the effect of various meditative

thickness)

A recent study by Ho¨lzel et al. documented the effect of an 8-
week MBSR training in meditation naı¨ve subjects without clinical
symptoms [16]. Using VBM, the authors demonstrated anatom-
ical changes after the MBSR program, showing an increase in grey
matter concentration values of posterior cingulate cortex, tempo-
ral-parietal junction and cerebellum in the MBSR group in respect
to a wait-control group. Considering the different available
approaches for the neuroanatomical changes evaluation - which
are often exclusively focused on one specific brain property (e.g.,
complementary
cortical volume, concentration,
investigations are needed in order to confirm and expand these
findings. Moreover, whether such morphometric changes also
correspond to modifications at behavioral and psychological levels
remains to be investigated, opening the interesting opportunity to
understand the neurobiological underpinnings of the documented
effects of MBSR on depression and anxiety symptomatology. In
the present study, we aimed to expand previous findings by
adopting multiple methods for longitudinal gray matter morpho-
metric analyses. Specifically, the impact of an 8-week MBSR
training program on brain cortical and subcortical structures in
meditation-naı¨ve subjects has been evaluated by the estimation of
grey matter volume (through optimized voxel-based morphometry
– VBM) [17,18] and through grey matter thickness evaluations
(voxel-based cortical thickness – VBCT) [19]. VBCT has been
used as a complementary analysis to VBM, since it offers increased
sensitivity to morphometric properties of more convoluted brain
regions and consequently guarantees an increased probability of
detecting modifications in deep brain structures which might be
involved in meditation practice [20]. Furthermore, we additionally
correlated longitudinal changes in anatomical structures with
several psychological indices evaluated before and after the MBSR
training.

Experimental Procedures

2.1 Participants

Forty-eight right-handed participants were recruited from the
responders to an announcement for an 8-week mindfulness-based
training, promoted by the Department of Neurological, Neuro-
surgical and Behavioral Sciences, University of Siena, Italy. All
participants declared to be naı¨ve to mindfulness and meditation
practice. Further inclusion criteria were a score .27 on the Mini-
Mental Status Examination (MMSE), no history of psychiatric or
neurological disorders, and suitability for participation in a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
study. Participants were
randomly assigned to 2 groups. The MBSR group consisted of
(age 3164 years, 13F-11M) who underwent a
24 subjects
psychological and neuroradiological evaluation performed before
and after the MBSR training, while the 24 remaining subjects (age
3064 years, 12F–12M) underwent the same pre-post multidisci-
plinary assessment without attending the training, at an equivalent
time interval of 8 weeks. The adopted wait-list solution was
preferred to a ‘‘no-contact group’’, in order to control for potential
bias due to group- differences in terms of motivation. All study
protocols and consenting procedures were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the University of Siena, written informed consent
was obtained from all participants according to the Declaration of
Helsinki.

2.2 MBSR program

MBSR is an 8-week intensive program that

involves daily
in focusing attention on the present moment, as

exercises

described by Kabat-Zinn and colleagues [2]. Core components
include practicing body scanning, sitting meditation, walking
meditation and mindful stretching movements. The program
features weekly 2.5 hour long in-class sessions; on each of the six
days between classroom sessions, participants are asked to practice
the meditation based exercises on their own for at least 45 min
each day [21]. Between class 6 and 7 the participants are invited to
a whole day silent retreat (7 hours). The program was conducted
by 2 instructors (S.D., C.G.) that regularly teach MBSR. The
participants were asked to write about their daily meditation
activities describing the kind of meditation performed and the
length of the practice.

The meditation training, by which individuals develop the
ability to direct and maintain an open and ‘‘non-judgmental’’
attention towards the present moment, is based on learning to use
different anchoring tools to remain focused on the present: the
bodily perception linked to breathing, spontaneous sensations in
the body and sensations linked to the position of the body in space,
internal and external sounds, taste, thoughts and emotions (here
described as ‘‘thoughts with a bodily sensation’’). The whole
program has an attitudinal framework exploring different facets of
what is described as ‘‘non-judgmental’’ attention, with the capacity
to observe the anchoring object before naturally following
interlocked thoughts. The program additionally consists of an
informal practice designed to allow the subject to direct awareness
towards specific observations of everyday life, such as the moment
of eating, capturing pleasant and unpleasant events, dialogical
interactions, and more.

2.3 Neuroradiological Acquisition

the entire brain (TE = 4.6 ms, TR = 30.00 ms,

MRI examinations of all participants were performed at a 1.5
Tesla Philips Intera Scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The
Netherlands). T1-weighted Fast Field Echo (FFE) 1-mm thick
images of
flip
angle = 30.00, FOV = 250 mm, matrix 2566256, slices = 150),
were acquired in the axial plane parallel to the anterior and
posterior commissure. To verify the absence of grey and white
matter lesions or hyperintensities, a thorough neuroradiological
examination also included (i) 1-mm coronal FFE, (ii) 3-mm T2-
weighted Turbo Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
and (iii) 3-mm T2-weighted FLAIR images.

2.4 Psychological Evaluation

Participants completed the following psychological tests under
the supervision of three expert psychologists and psychiatrists
(M.R., E.E., R.P.), before and after the MBSR training course.

2.4.1 Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The TAS-20 is
a self-report questionnaire that reveals the alexithymia construct.
Alexithymia refers to a condition in which people have trouble
identifying and describing emotions and tend to minimize their
emotional experience and focus their attention externally. In the
initial validation study [22], exploratory factor analysis of the
TAS-20 yielded a three factor structure congruent with the
theoretical construct of alexithymia: 1) difficulty in identifying
feelings and bodily sensations of emotional arousal; 2) difficulty in
describing feelings to others, 3) externally-oriented thinking. It is
composed of 20 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores range from
20 to 100. The validity of the three factor structure has been
demonstrated in the Italian version by confirmatory factor analysis
[23].

2.4.2 Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) [24]. This
is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure some of the
important features of clinically relevant worrying, namely the (1)

October 2014 | Volume 9 |

Issue 10 | e108359

generality of worrying over time and situations, the (2) intensity/
excessiveness of worrying, and the (3) uncontrollability of
worrying. PSWQ is made up of a list of 16 worry-based
dysfunctional characteristics. A participant has to indicate how
typical these characteristics are for him/her on a five-point Likert
scale from 1 (Not at all typical of me) to 5 (Very typical of me).
Higher scores indicate greater worry.

2.4.3 State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)

- Form Y
[25]. This is a self-report questionnaire for measuring anxiety
in adults. It clearly differentiates between the temporary condition
of ‘‘state anxiety’’ and the more general and long-standing quality
of ‘‘trait anxiety’’. The STAI is composed of a total of 40 self-
report items referring to State anxiety as the ‘‘intensity of the
anxiety emotion in this moment’’, and trait anxiety as the more
stable general personal disposition.

2.4.4 Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) [26]. This
measure consists of 21 items multiple-choice self-report items to
assess the intensity of depression in clinical and normal popula-
tions. BDI-II values different aspects of depression: symptoms of
depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognition such as
guilt, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and
lack of interest in sex. The measures ask respondents to endorse
statements characterizing how they have been feeling throughout
the previous 2 weeks.

2.4.5 Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). A self-
report questionnaire to value the mindfulness construct of
‘‘presence or absence of attention and awareness in the present
moment’’ [27]. The MAAS consists of 15 items that can value the
individual differences in frequency of mindful states and produce a
total score of mindfulness. Participants have to indicate how
frequently they have the experience shown in each item with a
score from 1 to 6 on a Likert scale: 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost
never). The answer to each item suggests how often the person
feels he is performing the task in an automatic way without much
awareness, how much he/she is concentrating on and in charge of
what he/she is doing or conversely how much he/she is not paying
attention to what is happening.

2.5 Optimized Voxel-Based Morphometry

For all preprocessing and analysis steps, the SPM software
(Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University
College London) and MATLAB 7.5 (MathWorks, MA, USA)
were used. In order to obtain a better estimation of brain tissues
maps, we implemented an optimized voxel-based morphometry
(VBM) protocol for segmentation and normalization processes,
using the DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using
Exponentiated Lie algebra) toolbox for SPM [18]. Briefly, this
approach is based on the creation of a customized anatomical
template built directly from participants’ T1-weighted images
instead of the canonical one provided with SPM (MNI template,
ICBM 152, Montreal Neurological Institute). This allows us to
obtain a finer normalization into standard space and consequently
to avoid brain region volume under/over estimations, which may
be induced by the adoption of an external template. Moreover, we
specifically designed for
applied a modified VBM analysis
longitudinal studies, by using the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.
neuro.uni-jena.de/) which allows to control for potential artifacts
induced by the normalization process. Briefly, all the images of
each participant are registered to correct for position (but not size)
and the normalization estimates are derived from the first
(baseline) scan only. The estimated normalization parameters are
then applied to all images of one subject.

Cortical Thickness Changes after MBSR

matter maps have been spatially normalized using a modulation
procedure, which leads to an estimation of the absolute volume of
grey matter structures (gray matter volume - GMV). After spatial
normalization, the data were smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM
(full width at half maximum) Gaussian kernel.

2.6 Voxel-Based Cortical Thickness

The VBCT toolbox for SPM was used to calculate grey matter
cortical thickness. Here the thickness is calculated using segmented
MR images in the subject’s native space, assigning an absolute
measure of cortical thickness to each grey matter voxel. Differently
from surface-based methods, voxel-based cortical thickness mea-
surements do not require the construction of a three-dimensional
surface model. Grey and white matter boundaries are instead
defined on the basis of voxel information [19,28] and cortical
thickness is then calculated at every volumetric point within the
cortex (defined as 0.5 probability of being GM), based on the
length of the trajectory from inner to outer boundaries. To obtain
an accurate spatial normalization, deformation fields obtained
from normalization of GM probability maps to the average size
template and then to MNI were also applied to obtained VBCT
maps. A surface-based 8 mm FWHM smoothing was consequent-
ly applied to VBCT maps. Regionally-specific differences in
cortical thickness between pre and post MBSR maps were then
compared on a voxel-by-voxel basis.

2.7 Statistical analyses of imaging data

iterations = 1000, FWHM = 8 mm,

Three repeated measures analysis of covariance (RP ANCOVA)
models were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS 19.0), testing for differences in (1) GMV, and (3)
VBCT values, using ‘‘Group’’ (MBSR and wait-list controls) as the
between-subjects factor and ‘‘Pre-Post’’ (MRI PRE and POST) as
the within-subjects factor. Age, gender and total brain volume
(TBV) (i.e. the sum of gray and white tissue maps) were included as
covariates in all analyses. Multiple comparisons correction was
performed using a Montecarlo simulation (corrected p,.05) based
on the probability of
false-positive detection which takes into
account both the individual voxel probability threshold and voxel
individual voxel
cluster size (cluster connection radius = 4 mm,
threshold p,.001,
inclusive
masks obtained by averaging participants baseline grey matter
tissue maps). Moreover,
to investigate possible interactions
between psychological dimensions and brain morphometric
changes in response to MBSR, a correlational analysis between
psychological scores and statistically significant GMV/VBCT
clusters was performed. Individual average thickness or volume
values were extracted from each significant anatomical cluster
using the Rex toolbox for SPM (http://web.mit.edu/swg/
software.htm) and Pearson product/moment ‘‘r’’ coefficients were
calculated using three different combinations (Bonferroni correc-
tion for multiple comparisons, p,.05): pre-MBSR (i.e. T0) brain
volumes and pre-post MBSR differences (i.e. D) in psychological
scores (T0-Brain/DPsy); pre-post MBSR differences in both brain
volumes and psychological scores (DBrain/DPsy); pre-post MBSR
differences in brain volumes and psychological scores before
MBSR training (DBrain/T0-Psy). Specifically, we tried to unveil
possible interactions between the effect of MBSR training on (i)
both psychological and neuroanatomical profiles of each subject
(pre-post interaction), or (ii) their pre-MBSR psychological profile
(testing for possible predispositions to MBSR training).

2.8 Multivariate nodal thickness classification

The hidden Markov Random Field model was applied in all
segmentation processes in order to remove isolated voxels. Grey

In order to obtain a global overview of the impact of the MBSR
program over cortical structures we also performed a multivariate

pattern analysis classification procedure on the cortical thickness
data. Trying to discriminate MBSR trainees and wait-list subjects
on the basis of their anatomical changes across the 8 weeks, we
calculated the difference between pre-MBSR and post-MBSR
whole brain cortical thickness values for each participant. Whole
brain map has been consequently parcellated into 90 regions
according to the AAL atlas [29], and regional thickness differences
were used as classification parameters (features of brain response
to MBSR). Using Weka software [30–32], a support vector
machine (SVM) algorithm was tested through leave-one-out cross-
validation, resulting in an estimation of
the overall correct
classification percentage (% Accuracy into discriminate subjects
who attended the course; Sensitivity; Specificity) as well as in a
regional specific discriminative weight, with the expression of each
region contributing to the overall classification process.

Results

One participant from the MBSR group and two participants
from the control group did not attend the second MRI acquisition,
so the MBSR and control groups entered into the analyses were
composed respectively by 23 (12F/11M) and 22 (11F/11M)
subjects. Results of the between-groups comparison of age, gender
and total brain volume are reported in Table 1.

3.1 Psychological evaluation

Results of the psychometric test comparisons are displayed in
Table 1. Briefly, participants in the two groups did not differ for
age, gender distribution or TBV. MBSR trainees showed a
significant pre-post decrease in alexithymia (t(22) = 3.142; p,.004),
worry (t(22) = 2.665; p,.012), state anxiety (t(22) = 2.259; p,.031)
and depression levels (t(22) = 2.086; p,.046), while no differences
were detected by the MAAS (t(22) = 0.879; p,.418). No differences
were found for participants in the control group (p,.05 corrected).

3.2.1 VBCT and VBM comparisons. A repeated measures
ANCOVA (rpAN COVA) was performed on GMV and VBCT
values (two groups6two time-points), with age, gender and TBV
as covariates. The group6time interaction was significant for the
VBCT model (F (1,25) = 5.456; p = .008; g2 = .467), indicating an
increases in cortical thickness greater in the MBSR than in the

(F

in cortical thickness in the control group were not significant for
either insula (F (1,25) = 21.12; p = .44) and somatosensory cortex (F
(1,25) = 0.78; p = .65). No clusters of GMV reached the statistical
significance threshold either for main or interaction effects.

extract individual cortical thickness values from the insula and
somatosensory clusters obtained in the rpANCOVA model. The
rate of changes in thickness were then correlated with the changes
indexes of interest (DBrain/DPsy), revealing a
in psychological
significant negative correlation for alexithymia level and insula
cluster thickness values (r = 20.712; p,.01) in MBSR subjects
after the training (Figure 2B). To verify that such correlation was
not due to spurious variability in brain volume estimations, the
same analysis was repeated in control subjects with no significant

Cortical Thickness Changes after MBSR

Figure 1. Morphometric changes after MBSR. Panels A, B, C and D show the results of voxel-wise cortical thickness comparison between MBSR
trainees and control-group participants (repeated measures ANCOVA, p,.05, Montecarlo correction for multiple comparisons; individual VBCT
masks), with clusters of increased thickness plotted on a reference T1-weighted image in MNI space and radiological convention. Specifically, panels
A and C show axial, coronal and sagittal views of right somatosensory cluster, while B and D show the cluster located in the right insula.

are made on the same subject, leading to the inherent tendency to
obtain measurements fluctuating around the population’s mean
(such as in the repeated measurement paradigm we applied), with
an high probability of detecting values close to the mean if extreme
values have been detected during the first measurement (and
viceversa). Thus, in order to control for such statistical artifact,
additional control analyses were performed by calculating the
within-subjects variance of psychological and anatomical mea-
surements, and quantifying the RTM effect using the approach

suggested in [33]. No significant changes in the correlation
coefficients were detected after compensating for RTM influence.

Discussion

The last decade has revealed growing evidence of anatomical
and functional brain modifications associated with meditation
practices, with results referring to a large variety of different
methods of meditation. Noteworthy, evidence is often derived
from cross-sectional studies based on subjects with a long-history
of meditation practice. Moreover, the link between the behavioral
effect of meditation and the neuroanatomical/functional changes
observed in neuroimaging studies has not being explored in
details. Here, we longitudinally examined the effects of a brief 8-
week MBSR training program [21] on both neuroanatomical and
psychological variables of meditation naı¨ve subjects. We found an
increase of cortical
insular lobe and
somatosensory cortex of meditation-naı¨ve participants after the
MBSR training, as well a significant after-training reduction of
several psychological
state anxiety,
depression and alexithymia. Finally, a significant negative
correlation between alexithymia level and pre-post MBSR changes
in insular thickness was also observed.

Both brain imaging and electrophysiological

studies have
suggested that right
insula is a key node for interoception,
awareness of body movements and emotional awareness [34], due
to its extensive viscera-sensory inputs from the periphery and
reciprocal connections with limbic, somatosensory, prefrontal and
temporal cortices [35,36]. The insula has been specifically linked
to the monitoring of visceral parts of the body, and its possible role

increased right

into the re-representation of interoception offers a possible basis
for its involvement in all subjective feelings [37]. Following the first
cross-sectional evidence of
insula thickness in
expert meditators (.1000 hours of meditation) observed by Lazar
and colleagues (2005), other studies have shown a modulation of
insula structural and functional properties in expert meditators.
For instance, Ho¨lzel et al. found a significantly greater grey matter
density in right
insula of Vipassana meditators compared to
controls [12], while Grant and colleagues documented increased
insula thickness in Zen meditators [15].

As for MBSR, using a fine anatomical parcellation analysis of
insula activity, Farb and colleagues [38] showed higher activation
of the anterior dysgranular insular regions in MBSR trainees with
respect to controls during an interoceptive attention task, while in
another study they demonstrated a reduced insula deactivation in
MBSR practitioners during a sadness provocation task, which may
be interpreted as increased interoceptive awareness and thus a
lesser propensity to process highly-emotional
incoming stimuli
[39]. Moreover, in a recent study Murakami and colleagues (2012)
also demonstrated a significant correlations between right anterior
insula volume and individual scores on a self-report questionnaire
investigating mindfulness-related dimensions like ‘‘non-reactivity
to inner experience, non-judging, acting with awareness, describ-
ing, and observing’’ [40]. Accordingly, the increase of
insula
thickness observed in our participants may be the result of their

moment in a non-judgmental way) of bodily sensations (from the
most subtle to the most evident). Interestingly, the insular lobe
seems to be also involved in the cognitive processing of nociceptive
stimuli, with an increase in its activity (measured using arterial spin
labeling after just 4 days of mindfulness training) associated with a
significantly diminished pain perception in healthy subjects [41].
In conclusion, our results confirm insula high responsiveness to
MBSR and put
forward the feasibility of a plasticity-related
response even after a brief mindfulness training exposure.

Cortical Thickness Changes after MBSR

Figure 3. Cortical thickness based multivariate pattern classification. Panel A and B report a surface-based representation of average
cortical thickness values for MBSR-trainees before and after the course. By computing the pre-post MBSR difference in cortical thickness level for both
MBSR trainees and wait-list subjects, and by calculating this value for each of the 90 regions composing the AAL anatomical atlas, a support vector
machine algorithm has been trained into discriminate the two groups. Results indicates an average identification accuracy equal to 83.32%
(CI = .6346–.89; accuracy = .79; Sensitivity = .72; Specificity = .89), with panel C and D respectively report coronal, axial and sagittal views of a glass
brain rendering showing the most discriminative regions (n = 15) and the distribution of discriminative power across regions (red line = 90thu

gyrus dorsal part; ACG = Anterior cingulate gyrus; INS = Insula lobe; PHG = Parahippocampal gyrus; TPOsup = superior Temporal pole.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0108359.g003

We also observed an MBSR-induced thickness change in right
somatosensory cortex, a region associated with sensory-discrimi-
native processing of nociceptive information [42]. As with the
insula, this region is often associated with meditation practice, with
findings of increased activation during experiential focusing [43]
and observation of neutral and sad clips [39] in MBSR trainees.
During the MBSR program,
focusing attention on somatic
sensations is trained through ‘‘body scanning‘‘, sitting meditation,
mindful yoga and walking meditation exercises, in which students
learn to focus mindful attention on sensations coming from
different parts of
their bodies. Accordingly, as suggested by
evidence of increased alpha-band modulation after mindfulness
training observed in this region using magneto-electroencepha-
lography (MEG) [44], repeated increases of average activation in
the somatosensory cortex during the program could be responsible
for the observed effect.

Multivariate pattern analysis revealed a large number of regions
which seem to be highly informative for the identification of
MBSR trainees. Interestingly, this pool of regions, encompassing
frontal
temporal pole,
somatosensory cortex, angular and parahippocampal gyri, have
been separately reported in previous anatomical or functional

insula,

studies on different types of meditation [45,46]. In light of the
sensory and cognitive functions they are associated with, these
regions may compose an unspecific network of areas that are
highly sensitive to meditation practicing in general. Besides
morphometric changes, a significant after-training reduction of
several psychological
indexes related to worry, state anxiety,
depression and alexithymia were observed, while no significant
changes or correlation with the MAAS were detected. Given the
theoretically framework sustaining the items proposed in the
MAAS, which seem to describe the capacity of the subject to pay
attention in a very acute way, rather than to ‘‘hold in awareness-
paying attention in a non-judgmental way- the universe of internal
and external events as they unfold’’ as mindfulness theory suggests,
this is not completely surprising (see Grossman [10]). More
interestingly,
the correlation between alexithymia levels and
anatomical changes after mindfulness exposure gives reason of
previous evidences correlating the insula and alexithymia levels in
several morphometric studies not specifically involving meditation.
For instance,
in a positron emission tomography (PET) study,
Kano and colleagues highlighted how individuals scoring higher
than the clinical cut-off on the TAS-20 showed hyperactivity of the
right insula [47], interpreting this hyperactivation as the tendency

of these individuals to exacerbate physical illness, possibly caused
by an unpleasant internal signal amplification. Moreover, in a
study using film clips to elicit emotional responses [48], the authors
documented increased activity in the bilateral insula in TAS-20

the functions
associated with the insula seems to resemble the mental state
promoted through mindfulness, while they are basically opposite
to the theoretical description of alexithymia, which is intended as a
reduction or incapacity to experience or verbalize emotions [49].
A similar finding regarding the insula has been documented by
Farb and colleagues [43], by looking at differences in brain
activation in response to different types of self-reference monitor-
ing tasks in both novices and MBSR-trained subjects. While a
strong coupling between the right
insula and self-referential
cortical midline regions (medial prefrontal cortex - mPFC) has
focus task, an
been observed in novices during experiential
increase in the activity of a right lateralized network comprising
the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and viscerosomatic areas such
as the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal
lobule seems
to characterize the response of MBSR-trained
participants, also leading to the uncoupling of the aforementioned
insula-mPFC connectivity. Such evidence suggests how the
integration of visceral/emotional
information in MBSR practi-
tioners may be disrupted and dissociated by self-referencing
activity, an effect which may plausibly explain the decrease in
alexithymia level observed in our study.

The MBSR program, by training interoception, may improve
the understanding and processing of own emotional reactions to
internal and external stimuli, with a positive cascade effect on
individual ability to exert cognitive control over emotions.
Therefore,
the insula-alexithymia interaction observed in the
participants to the MBSR program could simply indicate an
increase in their emotional awareness driven by the mindfulness
experience [50], a phenomena that seems to be neuro-biologically
supported by an increase in the activity of the insula [39], which
could in turn plausibly lead,
if expressed over time, to local
neurogenesis. However, regarding the cellular underpinnings of
the observed structural changes, there is no evidence of neuronal

proliferation in the human cortex during most of post-natal
development, thus making unlikely that cortical thickness changes
observed after MBSR training are due to changes in the number of
cortical neurons [51]. Plausibly such alterations rely on changes in
the amount of glial and capillary support, as well as in dendritic
arborization and cortical capillary density [52,53]. Consistently,
gliogenesis as a consequence of learning and experience has been
already demonstrated [54] and candidate as a possible mechanism
for experience-related changes in gray matter morphology [55].

achieved via the comparison with an adequate control condition.
Previous literature about MBSR training has included different
solutions to address this issue, with the vast majority of the studies
adopting a wait-control list approach [see 10,56–57]. Interestingly,
recent evidences suggest how an active control condition might be
more adequate to identify the active ingredients responsible for
MBSR training efficacy into modulating,
for instance, pain
perception [58] and stress response [59]. Even though our design
includes a wait-control group, thus requiring further studies in
order to confirm the impact of MBSR program against an active
control condition as
the one suggested by MacCoon and
colleagues (2012) [59], the anatomical localization of those regions
showing a significant increase in thickness after the training as well
involvement during
as their extensively documented functional
MBSR-like tasks using fMRI [43,45,46], denote our results as a
proof of the efficacy of MBSR training both on participants’
psychological well-being and on cortical grey matter structures in
naı¨ve subjects. Moreover, the link with alexithymia levels also
posits the existence of a specific neuroanatomical substrate linking
mindfulness training and an increase in subjective awareness of
their own emotions and feelings.
