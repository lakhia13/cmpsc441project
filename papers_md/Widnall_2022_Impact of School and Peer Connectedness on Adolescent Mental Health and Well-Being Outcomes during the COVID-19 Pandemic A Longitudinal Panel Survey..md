Abstract: School closures and social distancing measures during the pandemic have disrupted young
people’s daily routines and social relationships. We explored patterns of change in adolescent mental
health and tested the relationship between pre-pandemic levels of school and peer connectedness and
changes in mental health and well-being between the ﬁrst lockdown and the return to school. This is
a secondary analysis of a longitudinal 3-wave panel survey. The study sample included 603 students
(aged 13–14) in 17 secondary schools across south-west England. Students completed a survey
pre-pandemic (October 2019), during lockdown (May 2020) and shortly after returning to school
(October 2020). Multilevel models, with random effects, were conducted for anxiety, depression and
well-being outcomes with school and peer connectedness as predictor variables. Symptoms of anxiety
decreased from pre-pandemic to during the ﬁrst UK lockdown and increased on the return to school;
anxious symptoms decreased the most for students reporting feeling least connected to school pre-
pandemic. Students reporting low levels of school and peer connectedness pre-pandemic experienced
poorer mental health and well-being at all time points. Low school connectedness pre-pandemic
was associated with a greater increase in anxious and depressive symptoms between lockdown and
the return to school when compared to students with medium levels of school connectedness. No
associations were found with high school connectedness or with low/high peer connectedness. For
adolescents with poor school connectedness, the enforced time away from school that the pandemic
caused led to reduced anxiety. Going forwards, we need to consider ways in which to promote
connection with school as a way of supporting mental health and well-being.

1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions implemented by the UK government have
substantially disrupted the lives and daily routines of the population. The effect of the
lockdowns, school closures and social distancing measures on adolescent mental health
and well-being is a particular area of concern. We have seen continually rising levels of
mental health difﬁculties in adolescents, and there are concerns that pandemic-related
challenges will have worsened an already concerning picture [1].

Repeated school closures, self-isolation policies and ongoing restrictions in schools are
likely to have had a considerable impact on young people’s mental health and well-being
over the course of the pandemic, particularly given that school routines are important

coping mechanisms for young people with mental health issues or those with special educa-
tional needs [2]. Schools can also act as a ‘de facto’ mental health system for many children
and adolescents [3]. School closures are therefore likely to be particularly disruptive for
those who were seeking help through school systems.

Early studies have indicated relatively high levels of mental health symptoms during
the pandemic [4], and the recent NHS Digital survey of children and young people’s
mental health in England [1] highlighted that in July 2020—at the end of the ﬁrst national
lockdown—the proportion of children and young people with a probable mental health
disorder was one in six, compared to one in nine in 2017. However, it is difﬁcult to say
how much of this is due to the pandemic as levels of mental health were already rising.
Only ﬁve US studies to date have examined longitudinal change with available mental
health data pre-pandemic, two of which relied on parent report data. Three studies found
increases in depression and anxiety outcomes [5–7]. One found no meaningful effects of
the pandemic on mental health outcomes, and a ﬁnal study focusing on early adolescents
found reductions in mental health outcomes, particularly for youths who had elevated
levels of mental health problems before the pandemic [8].

Existing research has also demonstrated that the impact of the pandemic has dif-
fered by age groups. Parents of children in England have reported increased emotional
symptoms in younger children (4–10 years), whilst adolescents (11–17 years) have seen
a decrease in emotional symptoms [9]. An Italian study found longitudinal increases in
childhood depression symptoms in children aged 7–12 years between April–June 2020 [10].
A recent qualitative study of young people in the UK (16–19 years) also highlighted some
positive affordances of lockdown, including relief from academic pressures, time for per-
sonal development and strengthened relationships [11]. A survey study of 306 Italian
adolescents (15–21 years) also revealed adaptive coping strategies during April 2020, in-
cluding developing new interests [12]. A longitudinal study in New York found decreasing
trajectories of depression and anxiety from May–July 2020 in adolescents and young adults
(12–22 years) [13]. It is likely that adolescents are likely better able to stay meaningfully
connected with their peers online in comparison to younger children and may be more
capable of self-directed learning whilst away from school.

The impact of the pandemic on young people’s mental health is still an emerging
area of research, with little evidence available to examine longitudinal change from pre-
pandemic levels. The majority of studies to date are either cross-sectional or involve online
convenience samples that demonstrate change in mental health and well-being during the
course of the pandemic [9,14]. Studies have also used historical data to predict mental
health outcomes during the pandemic [15] as well as independent samples to provide
pre-pandemic comparisons [16]. Although these studies have provided valuable early
insights, the convenience and non-probability samples are likely to contain substantial
bias [17].

One area that has yet to be investigated is the impact of social connectedness on
young people’s mental health and well-being outcomes during the pandemic. Young
people’s relationships to their schools and peers are of particular interest, given lengthy
school closures and various social distancing measures leading to a lack of in-person
interaction with peers [18]. Stemming from belongingness theory, the construct of social
connectedness refers to feelings of afﬁliation associated within a social network [19] and
reﬂects the perceived feelings of meaningful connection with others at an interpersonal
level [20]. The construct of social connectedness has been found to be a key determinant of
adolescent mental health and well-being [21,22]. Social connectedness plays a central role
in adolescence, and studies have shown the impact of peer relationships and social isolation
to be risk factors for depression [23]. Equally, peer relationships can act as a protective
factor against school disengagement among at-risk adolescents [24] as well as protect
against mental health problems and strengthen adolescent resilience more generally [25].
The literature indicates the increased importance of peer interactions during adolescence,
including spending more time with peers [26], the increased importance of peer social

approval [27] and adolescents being more sensitive to peer acceptance, rejection and
approval [28–30]. A recent viewpoint highlights concerns that physical distancing may
have a disproportionate effect on adolescents due to the vital nature of peer interactions
on their development [31]. There is much less research, however, on the relation between
school connectedness and mental health symptoms in adolescents, but research indicates
associations between school connectedness and adolescent depressive symptoms and a
predictive link from school connectedness to future mental health problems [32,33].

A study of 423 11–15 year olds during the pandemic in India found 56% of young
people were concerned about not attending school and 80% were concerned about not
being able to see friends [34]. A study of 451 adolescents and young adults also found that
greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression
symptoms [6]. Previous studies have also revealed that deﬁcits in school connectedness are
associated with more severe emotional symptoms such as depression [35] and higher levels
of school connectedness are associated with positive adaptation and being less negatively
inﬂuenced by stressful experiences [36].

Given the current knowledge gap surrounding the impact of social connectedness
on young people’s mental health and well-being during the pandemic, this study aims
to speciﬁcally explore the role of pre-pandemic levels of school and peer connectedness
on adolescent mental health and well-being outcomes during the pandemic. We have
previously reported on descriptive changes in mental health and well-being in adolescents
between pre-pandemic and during the ﬁrst UK lockdown (May 2020) [37]. This paper
extends these ﬁndings to show patterns across three timepoints to include when schools
ﬁrst fully reopened. Our analysis focuses more speciﬁcally on changes in mental health
and well-being between the ﬁrst UK lockdown and the return to school.

1.1. Aims

1.

2.

3.

To explore patterns of change over time in symptoms of anxiety, depression and
well-being scores from pre-pandemic, during the ﬁrst lockdown and when schools
ﬁrst fully reopened.
To describe whether patterns of change over time differ according to pre-pandemic
levels of school and peer connectedness.
To test the relationship between pre-pandemic levels of school and peer connectedness
and changes in mental health and well-being scores between lockdown and on the
return to school.

1.2. Hypotheses

Aim one and two were exploratory and aim three was hypothesis-driven. We hypoth-

esised that:

1.

2.

Students with low levels of school and peer connectedness pre-pandemic would
experience a greater increase in anxious and depressive symptoms, and a greater
reduction in well-being scores on the return to school compared to students with
medium levels of pre-pandemic connectedness.
Students with high levels of school and peer connectedness would experience a
greater decrease in anxious and depressive symptoms, and a greater increase in well-
being scores on the return to school compared to students with medium levels of
pre-pandemic connectedness.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design

This study is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal three-wave survey study. Data
was collected at three time points: wave 1: October 2019 (pre-pandemic); wave 2: May 2020
(during lockdown) and wave 3: October 2020 (1 month after schools ﬁrst reopened). All
year 9 students (aged 13–14 years) were invited to complete an online survey [38] during

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

4 of 15

lesson time. For wave 2 (during lockdown), students were invited by their schools to
complete the online survey at home. Paper surveys were provided for schools on request.

2.2. Participants

For the original study, all non-fee-paying secondary schools across four local author-
ities in south-west England (n = 76) were invited to participate. The secondary analysis
presented here includes data from the 17 schools that participated at all three time points.
Participating schools were broadly comparable to non-participating schools in the target
area (see Supplementary Materials for further information). All year 9 students (aged
13–14 years) in participating schools were invited to complete the survey at baseline during
lesson time. At time 2 (during lockdown), the same students were asked to complete the
survey online at home. At time 3, students who were in year 10 (aged 14–15 years) were
asked to complete the survey at school during lesson time, or at home if unable to attend
school. Data at all three time points were available for 603 participants.

Mean age at baseline was 13.2 years, 59.6% of the sample were female and 81.9% of
the sample were White/Caucasian. The majority of students in the sample did not receive
free school meals (93.7%) and the mean FAS index score was 9.23, indicating relatively high
socio-economic status across the sample, with only 9.5% of students falling into the ‘low
afﬂuence’ category.

The matched analytic sample is described in Table 1. Compared with participants
for whom complete data were not available, Black, Asian and minority ethnic students,
students receiving free school meals, students reporting low family afﬂuence and students
at risk of depression were under-represented in the analytic sample.

2.3. Predictor Variables

School connectedness was measured using six items adapted from the Psychological
Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM) [39] and the School Connectedness Scale [40], as
described in Jose et al. [21]. The scale (time 1 α = 0.87) includes three items assessing student
relationships with teachers (e.g., “I always get an opportunity to talk with my teacher(s)”)
and three sense of-school community items (e.g., “I feel proud about my school”). The

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

5 of 15

six items were scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly
agree”). School connectedness scores were computed by summing the six items, with
higher scores indicating greater connectedness (time 1 α = 0.88).

Peer connectedness was measured using a 7-item sub-scale [21] (time 1 α = 0.80). Two
school peer relationship items asked how well students got on with their classmates and
other students in the school. Item response options ranged from 1 (“not at all well”) to 5
(“really well”). Two items measured happiness with number of close friends and used a
5-point scale ranging from 1 (“very unhappy”) to 5 (“very happy”). Three peer support
items (e.g., “I can trust my friends with personal problems”) used a 5-point Likert scale.
Peer connectedness scores were computed by summing the six items, with higher scores
indicating greater connectedness.

2.4. Outcome Measures

The 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure
depression symptoms (7-items) and anxiety (7-items) at each time point. Each item is
coded from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly all the time), and scores for anxious symptoms
(time 3 α = 0.88) and depressive symptoms (time 3 α = 0.78) can therefore range from 0–21.
Items include “I feel tense or wound up” and “I feel as if I am slowed down”. HADS has
been validated with 12–17 year olds [41].

The 14-item Warwick and Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) was used
to measure well-being at each time point (time 3 α = 0.93). Scores range from 14 to 70. Items
include “I’ve been feeling optimistic about the future” and “I’ve been feeling cheerful”.
Response options range from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). WEMWBS has been
validated for use with children from the age of 13 and over [42].

Confounders: Demographic variables included gender (male and female), ethnic-
ity (White and Black, Asian and minority ethnic), sexual orientation (heterosexual and
LGBTQI+) and disability (no disability and limiting long-term illness or disability). So-
cioeconomic status (SES) was measured by the six-item Family Afﬂuence Scale III [43]. All
demographic variables were collected via self-report within the survey.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

Matched data across all three time points were available for 603 students. Complete

case analysis was conducted and all data was analysed in Stata 15.

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to test whether changes over time in
anxious and depressive symptoms and well-being scores were statistically signiﬁcant. We
also mapped the changes in mental health and well-being scores over time by levels of
school and peer connectedness at baseline (pre-pandemic).

Multilevel models, with random effects at the school and student levels to account for
clustering and repeated measures, respectively, were used to investigate the association
between pre-pandemic levels of school/peer connectedness and changes in mental health
and well-being outcomes between wave 2 (during lockdown) and wave 3 (return to school).
Separate multilevel models were used for each outcome (depressive symptoms, anxiety
symptoms and well-being scores) and each predictor variable (school connectedness and
peer connectedness) creating 6 models in total.

Models were adjusted for several potential confounding variables based on a priori
grounds and previously published adolescent mental health literature, including ethnicity,
socioeconomic status (family afﬂuence), sexual attraction and limiting long-term illness
of disability. Unadjusted models included only the predictor variable (school or peer
connectedness) and outcome measure (depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms and well-
being scores), partially adjusted models included the predictor variable, outcome measure
and demographics (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, family afﬂuence, disability) and
the fully adjusted model included the predictor variable, outcome measure, demographics
and the relevant baseline connectedness measure (for example, if school connectedness

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

6 of 15

was the predictor variable, the fully adjusted model included wave 1 peer connectedness).
Baseline peer and school connectedness were found to be moderately correlated (r = 0.36).
Due to theoretically driven hypotheses concerning the relationship between low and
high school connectedness and mental health and well-being outcomes, both connectedness
variables were categorised into three groups (low, middle and high), using the 25th, 50th
and 75th percentiles of each variable. We predicted distinct differences in mental health
and well-being outcomes on the return to school for students reporting low and high
school/peer connectedness pre-pandemic and therefore used the ‘middle’ connectedness
group as the reference category.

We used maximum likelihood for more accurate estimation of standard errors. Change
scores from time 2 (during lockdown) and time 3 (return to school) were calculated for
symptoms of anxiety and depression (HADS) and well-being scores (WEMWBS) and used
within the multilevel models.

Missing Data

Of the 603 students who completed the survey at all three timepoints, levels of data
completeness were very high across both predictor and outcome variables. Table 2 shows
the percentage of complete data for each predictor and outcome variable.

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in anxious
symptoms between pre-pandemic and the ﬁrst UK lockdown (z = −7.061, p =< 0.001)
and a statistically signiﬁcant increase in anxious symptoms between lockdown and the
return to school (z = 6.983, p =< 0.001). There were no signiﬁcant changes over time for
depressive symptoms either between pre-pandemic to lockdown (z = −0.319, p = 0.750)
or from lockdown to the return to school (z = 1.614, p = 0.107). There was a signiﬁcant
increase in well-being scores from pre-pandemic to during lockdown (z = 3.847, p =< 0.001)
and a signiﬁcant decrease in well-being scores from during lockdown to return to school
(z = −3.654, p = 0.003).

Figure 1 charts the change in students’ anxious and depressive symptoms and well-
being scores over the three waves of the study according to pre-pandemic levels of school
and peer connectedness. Across all three outcomes, estimates were consistently poorest
among students who reported feeling least connected to their school and peers before
the pandemic.

Table 3 reports the association between pre-pandemic levels of school connectedness
and change in anxious and depressive symptoms and well-being scores between lockdown
(May 2020) and the return to school (October 2020). In the fully adjusted models, low school
connectedness at baseline was associated with a greater increase in anxious symptoms
(β = 1.332, p = 0.001, 95% CI [0.55, 2.11]) and depressive symptoms (β = 0.869, p = 0.010,
95% CI [0.21, 1.53]) between lockdown and the return to school, when compared to stu-
dents with medium levels of school connectedness. Although well-being scores decreased
from lockdown to the return to school for students reporting low school connectedness as
baseline, this was a smaller effect, with 95% conﬁdence intervals just crossing 0 (β = −1.91,
p = 0.056, 95% CI [−3.87, 0.05]). There was no evidence to suggest a difference in change
scores for those with high compared to medium levels of connectedness for anxious symp-
toms (β = 0.203, p = 0.602, 95% CI [−0.56, 0.96]), depressive symptoms (β = 0.74, p = 0.590,
95% CI [−0.79, 0.45]) or well-being scores (β = −0.74, p = 0.436, 95% CI [−2.58, 1.11]).

Table 4 reports the association between pre-pandemic levels of peer connectedness and
the changes in anxious and depressive symptoms and well-being scores between lockdown
(time 2) and the return to school (time 3). Low peer connectedness was associated with
an increase in anxious symptoms within the partially adjusted model (β = 0.756, p = 0.049,
95% CI [−0.01, 1.51]); however, ﬁndings attenuated to the null following adjustment for
school connectedness (β = 0.531, p = 0.175, 95% CI [−0.24, 1.30]). Consistent with the
ﬁndings for school connectedness, we did not ﬁnd differences in outcome change scores for
students with high compared to medium levels of peer connectedness for anxious symp-
toms (β = 0.100, p = 0.798, 95% CI [−0.67,0.87]), depressive symptoms (β = −0.232, p = 0.473,
95% CI [−0.87, 0.40]) or well-being scores (β = 0.457, p = 0.636, 95% CI [−1.43, 2.34]).

4. Discussion

To date, this is the ﬁrst study in the UK to explore longitudinal change in early adoles-
cent mental health and well-being with available baseline mental health data pre-pandemic.
Findings from descriptive data suggest that levels of mental health and well-being
were consistently poorest among students who reported feeling least connected to their
school and peers before the pandemic. Changes over time were most prominent for
symptoms of anxiety with a decrease during lockdown and a subsequent increase on
the return to school. The most striking change was the decrease in anxiety for students
reporting feelings least connected to school pre-pandemic.

In the regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, low school con-
nectedness was associated with an increase in anxious and depressive symptoms between
lockdown and the return to school. Findings for well-being were very similar with well-
being scores decreasing for students reporting low school connectedness, but there was a
less strong effect. No association was found for high school connectedness, or for low/high
peer connectedness. Our hypotheses were therefore only partially supported.

The observed overall decrease in symptoms of anxiety during lockdown is consistent
with previous work demonstrating a reduction in adolescent emotional symptoms during
early lockdown [14] as well as some young people reporting beneﬁts from lockdown [44].
This reduction in anxiety also aligns with a recently published study that found one-third of
young people (8–18 years) reported improved mental well-being during lockdown [45] as
well as the NHS Digital Survey, which reported 27% of 11–16 year olds felt that lockdown
had made their lives better [1].

Reductions in anxious symptoms during lockdown suggests that some students
adapted well to the ﬁrst school closures, which perhaps provided a chance for them
to be away from the everyday pressures of the school environment. Existing research
demonstrates a number of aspects of the school environment that are linked to poorer
mental health, including bullying [46] and academic stress [47]. Additionally, a recent US
study of adolescent girls found that a positive impact on those found to have improved
emotional health during lockdown was, reduced pressure from school [48]. Although
we do not have data available to know whether levels of anxious symptoms ﬂuctuated
throughout the lockdown period, the increase in symptoms of anxiety on the return to
school suggests an effect of school rather than time. However, this increase could also be
an effect of starting a new school year.

Although we found overall decreases in anxiety across the sample, our ﬁndings around
school connectedness suggest that these reductions in anxiety are likely to have been driven
by those students feeling least connected to school. This study therefore suggests that being
out for school for those not connected to school has a positive effect on depressive and
anxious symptomatology.

The rise in anxious symptoms on the return to school may be due to school envi-
ronment stressors being reintroduced, but could also indicate that communication about
the return to school and available mental health support for students were insufﬁcient.
Data from the OxWell study highlighted that young people looked most forward to seeing
friends again, but aspects causing young people concern related to school systems includ-
ing lessons and homework [45]. It is also possible that the increase in anxious symptoms
on the return to school is an appropriate reaction to changing circumstances during the
pandemic and anxieties around new COVID-related rules, and perhaps these increases
should only cause concern if they are sustained beyond the initial return phase. However,
we did not observe symptoms of anxiety increasing above pre-pandemic levels, which we
may expect if anxious symptoms were pandemic-speciﬁc.

Findings from this study build on the existing literature around the impact of school
culture and environment on student mental health and well-being [49,50]. Students who re-
ported feeling least connected to their school and peers pre-pandemic consistently reported
poorer mental health and well-being at each time point. If some of the drivers of poor
mental health and well-being lie within school and peer relationships at school, it makes

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

sense for those who feel least connected to school to see improvements in mental health and
well-being when removed from the school environment. These ﬁndings raise important
questions about the role of the school environment on adolescent mental health and what it
is that may be driving anxiety within the school environment, such as relationships with
teachers, exam pressures or bullying. There is a need for qualitative research to address
these questions.

Previous research examining the association between school connectedness and the
school environment found that positive classroom management climates, participation in
extracurricular activities, tolerant disciplinary policies and small school size were associated
positively with higher school connectedness [51]. These factors are each amenable to
change and could be areas of focus for school health promotion interventions. Our ﬁndings
highlight that the concept of school health promotion should be expanded to be inclusive
of creating school environments that make adolescents feel like they belong and are cared
for at school.

It is likely that students who felt well connected to their school and peers pre-pandemic
adapted well to lockdown and this may explain the lack of substantial changes in their
mental health and well-being overtime. A recent commentary discusses the possibility that
adolescents with robust, high-quality peer relationships may adapt better to lockdowns and
might be better able to cope with the social restrictions [18]. This also supports previous
ﬁndings indicating that young people with higher levels of school connectedness may
adapt better and be less negatively inﬂuenced by stressful experiences [28].

The study offers insight into the importance of students feeling well connected to their
school, including feeling respected and understood by teachers, having the opportunity
to talk with teachers and enjoying attendance. However, we did not ﬁnd that students
with high school connectedness fared better on the return to school in terms of anxious and
depressive symptoms or overall well-being. This ﬁnding suggests that the pandemic and
new COVID-19 rules were anxiety-provoking for everyone, and the return to school after a
long break was difﬁcult even for those who were usually well connected to school. However,
this study particularly draws attention to low school connectedness being problematic for
mental health as it was this group with poorer mental health on the return to school.

This study raises an important question as to whether school connectedness directly
helps mental health, or whether being at school whilst not feeling connected to your school
provokes anxious and depressive feelings. The pandemic has offered a window of oppor-
tunity to explore this question, but more research is needed to examine this relationship
further. A recent study highlights the importance of building school connectedness in
view of COVID-19 and recommends the role of school nurses to help promote school
connectedness and ensure students feel safe and supported [52].

Another interesting ﬁnding was the lack of association between peer connectedness
and depressive symptoms or well-being scores, and the association between low peer
connectedness and change in anxious symptoms attenuated after adjusting for school
connectedness. This suggests that school connectedness was the main driver of this effect.
This lack of association might be explained by the stability to peer relationships provided
by online socialising in the absence of in-person interactions [31]. These ﬁndings support
a recent US study that found an association between school connectedness and mental
health even when accounting for social connectedness, suggesting that a student’s sense of
connectedness to school contributes to mental health over and above their connection to
peers [53].

We know from the existing literature that age is an extremely important factor in
terms of how young people have experienced the pandemic. For some age groups, the
ﬁrst lockdown did not lead to a steep rise in mental health problems, but it is important
to understand why this is. Existing studies have shown both older adolescents [44] and
younger children [14] overall experienced poorer mental health, which differs from our
ﬁndings on early adolescents. It is therefore important to remember that the pre-pandemic
data was collected from students in Year 9, who were not undergoing substantial exam or

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

12 of 15

transition pressures. It is also important to note that the data collected during lockdown
was relatively early on in the pandemic (May 2020), when young people were unaware
of the long-term nature of the pandemic. The rise in anxious symptoms on the return to
school may reﬂect the experiences of the ongoing pandemic and multiple restrictions still in
place several months later; however, symptoms of anxiety did not rise higher than baseline,
which might be expected if there were additional pandemic-speciﬁc anxieties.

Further qualitative research is needed to understand the mechanisms leading to the
changes in anxious symptoms observed in this study. Longitudinal data will be vitally
important as the pandemic continues, particularly to see whether changes in anxious and
depressive symptoms and well-being are observed in the longer term.

Strengths and Limitations

The unique availability of matched individual level pre-pandemic mental health data
is a major strength of this study, enabling changes in mental health and well-being to
be observed over time. We also provide a novel focus on the impact of school and peer
connectedness on mental health outcomes in the context of the pandemic and adjust for a
range of potential confounding factors. However, there are some limitations to be taken
into consideration. Firstly, the generalisability of our ﬁndings should be viewed with
caution as Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students, and students from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds were underrepresented in our analytic sample. The analytic
sample also had fewer students at risk of depression (HADS score ≥7) at baseline compared
to the sample for whom complete data were not available. Fee paying schools were also
excluded from the original sample, restricting the extension of ﬁndings to students in
private education. Another limitation that we are unable to discount is that improvements
in mental health and well-being overtime also could be due to seasonal effects as opposed
to due to lockdown.

Although the descriptive data suggest mental health and well-being is poorer overall
for those with low school/peer connectedness, the direction of effects cannot be inferred. It
is possible that mental health difﬁculties could result in someone feeling less connected to
peers as well as vice versa. The data did not allow us to examine changes in connectedness
over time.

Going forwards, prioritising routine longitudinal data collection will be a priority [54]
to allow continued understanding of individual differences in varying age groups. It will
be important to build up a rich data set as studies emerge in order to accurately capture the
dynamic and multi-level factors affecting young people as the pandemic continues. The
survey during lockdown was conducted within schools in south-west England towards
the beginning of the pandemic and when the ﬁrst national lockdown restrictions were
beginning to ease (for example, students were allowed to meet friends outside). It will
be important to understand how young people’s mental health has been impacted at
different stages of the pandemic given changing restrictions. South-west England also had
relatively low rates of COVID-19 at the time of the survey’s completion; it is therefore worth
considering whether schools in this area experienced the pandemic differently compared
to other parts of the UK. The mental health of young people in areas experiencing higher
rates of morbidity and mortality may have been affected differently.

5. Conclusions

These ﬁndings point towards an important emerging area of research into school
connectedness and its relationship to student mental health and well-being. Moving
forwards, it will be important for schools and public health professionals to think about
ways to measure how connected young people feel to their school in order to target
interventions for those who have low levels of school connectedness. More research into
how to improve students’ sense of connectedness is also required. These ﬁndings also
provide evidence to support interventions to improve connectedness in young people,
particularly improving how connected young people feel to their school. Regardless of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6768

13 of 15

levels of connectedness, symptoms of anxiety decreased during the ﬁrst UK lockdown and
then increased on the return to school, which suggests that something about school culture
needs to change.

Few longitudinal studies investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have
matched pre-pandemic data on adolescent mental health. This is the ﬁrst UK study to date
to examine changes in levels of adolescent mental health and well-being from pre-pandemic
to school reopening. Additionally, no previous studies have longitudinally explored the
impact of school and peer connectedness on mental health/well-being outcomes during
lockdown and the return to school.

Although there may not be another national closure of schools, it is possible that some
students may experience periods of home learning due to local school closures (to manage
local outbreaks) or individual isolation. It is therefore important to enhance students’
connectedness to buffer these transitions and their impact on anxiety, mood and well-being.
