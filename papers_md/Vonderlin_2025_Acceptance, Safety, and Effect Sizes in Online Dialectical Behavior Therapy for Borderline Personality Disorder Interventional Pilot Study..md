Abstract

Background:  The potential of telehealth psychotherapy (ie, the online delivery of treatment via a video web-based platform)
is  gaining  increased  attention.  However,  there  is  skepticism  about  its  acceptance,  safety,  and  efficacy  for  patients  with  high
emotional and behavioral dysregulation.
Objective:  This study aims to provide initial effect size estimates of symptom change from pre- to post treatment, and the
acceptance and safety of telehealth dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for individuals diagnosed with borderline personality
disorder (BPD).

Methods:  A total of 39 individuals meeting the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fifth Edition])
criteria for BPD received 1 year of outpatient telehealth DBT at 3 sites in Germany and Canada. Effect size estimates were
assessed using pre-post measures of BPD symptoms, dissociation, and quality of life. Safety was evaluated by analyzing suicide
attempts and self-harm. Additionally, acceptance and feasibility, satisfaction with treatment, useability of the telehealth format,
and  the  quality  of  the  therapeutic  alliance  were  assessed  from  both  therapists’ and  patients’ perspectives.  All  analyses  were
conducted on both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and according-to-protocol (ATP) samples.

Results:  Analyses showed significant and large pre-post effect sizes for BPD symptoms (d=1.13 in the ITT sample and d=1.44
in  the  ATP  sample;  P<.001)  and  for  quality  of  life  (d=0.65  in  the  ITT  sample  and  d=1.24  in  the  ATP  sample).  Dissociative
symptoms showed small to nonsignificant reductions. Self-harm behaviors decreased significantly from 80% to 28% of all patients
showing at least 1 self-harm behavior in the last 10 weeks (risk ratio 0.35). A high dropout rate of 38% was observed. One
low-lethality  suicide  attempt  was  reported.  Acceptance,  feasibility,  and  satisfaction  measures  were  high,  although  therapists
reported only moderate useability of the telehealth format.

Conclusions:  Telehealth DBT for BPD showed large pre-post effect sizes for BPD symptoms and quality of life. While the
telehealth format appeared feasible and well-accepted, the dropout rate was relatively high. Future research should compare the
efficacy of telehealth DBT with in-person formats in randomized controlled trials. Overall, telehealth DBT might offer a potentially
effective alternative treatment option, enhancing treatment accessibility. However, strategies for decreasing drop-out should be
considered.

Introduction

Background
Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  severe  mental
disorder characterized by high instability in affect, identity, and
interpersonal  relationships  [1,2].  The  prevalence  of  BPD  is
estimated to be between 0.7% and 2.7% in community samples
[3,4] and between 11% and 35.6% in clinical samples [4]. BPD
is associated with significant health care use and costs, as well
as  profound  individual  suffering  and  impaired  quality  of  life
[5-7].

According to international guidelines [8,9], psychotherapy is
the first-line treatment for BPD. However, the complexity of
symptoms such as high levels of suicidality, and interpersonal
difficulties  present  challenges  for  psychological  treatments
[10,11].  Dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT)  [12-14]  is  a
specialized treatment that was developed to support therapists
in  dealing  with  the  complex  symptom  constellations  that
characterize  BPD.  DBT  includes  a  dynamic  hierarchy  of
treatment  foci  and  a  large  set  of  therapeutic  strategies  and
skills-based interventions to support individuals in building a
life worth living. DBT is a multimodal psychological treatment
that consists of individual and group therapy. A comprehensive
DBT treatment includes both individual and group sessions that
occur  weekly  over  a  1-year  period.  DBT  is  an  empirically
supported 
that  has  a  robust  research  base
demonstrating its efficacy in the treatment of BPD [15].

The Potential Benefit of Telehealth DBT for BPD
While  there  are  effective  psychological  treatments  for  BPD,
DBT and other evidence-based treatments are difficult to access
[16,17]. One significant barrier to accessing DBT is that given
the complexity of the treatment (ie, its multiple components,
length, and team-based model) the treatment is often localized
in specialized treatment centers in urban settings; DBT-trained
therapists and comprehensive DBT treatment programs are often
not available for clients in remote or rural settings. This problem
is even more pronounced in developing countries or low- and
middle-income countries [18].

One  solution  for  improving  access  to  DBT  is  to  expand  the
delivery options of the treatment to include telehealth treatment
(ie,  the  online  delivery  of  treatment  via  a  video  web-based
platform). Propelled in large part by the COVID-19 pandemic,
DBT practitioners around the world have already begun to shift

to the telehealth delivery of the treatment, with many clinicians
in  both  health  care  centers  and  in  private  practice  currently
offering telehealth DBT [19-21]. However, concerns have been
raised  regarding  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  feasibility  of
telehealth-delivered psychotherapy, especially for patients with
high levels of emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Although
research  has  started  to  explore  the  benefits,  barriers,  and
subjective  experiences  of  clients  and  therapists  engaged  in
telehealth DBT in  routine care,  to date there are no rigorous
research  trials  that  have  examined  the  efficacy,  safety,
acceptance, and feasibility of telehealth DBT [19-29].

Challenges of Telehealth Psychotherapy for BPD
Of  particular  concern  is  the  limited  ability  of  therapists  to
effectively deal with crisis situations and suicidal behavior in
telehealth treatments [20,25,30]. Zalewski et al [28] conducted
a qualitative study that shed light on various telehealth treatment
challenges with patients with BPD, including patients missing
sessions,  turning  off  their  cameras  prematurely,  logging  off
unexpectedly, or engaging in distracting behaviors like smoking
or drinking alcohol during telehealth group therapy sessions.
They  also  reported  that  some  patients  appeared  dissociative
during group sessions. Dissociation poses a particular challenge
to  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  telehealth  treatments  for  BPD.
Previous research has underscored how dissociative experiences
can lead to neurobiological alterations and impede emotional
learning,  thereby  hindering  successful  psychotherapeutic
outcomes  [31-33].  Ideally,  a  therapist  noticing  dissociation
during a session would intervene and provide guidance on how
to  use  distress  tolerance  skills  to  decrease  or  interrupt
dissociation. However, implementing these skills often involves
strong sensory input or physical activity, which make be harder
to facilitate telehealth versus in-person. More research is needed
if  and  how  dissociation  and  other
to 
therapy-interfering  behaviors  can  be  managed  in  telehealth
treatments for BPD [34].

investigate 

Another critical aspect of telehealth psychotherapy is the quality
of the therapeutic alliance [20]. The interpersonal difficulties
that  are  common  in  BPD,  such  as  mistrust  and  rejection
sensitivity, can make it harder to develop a strong alliance [35].
Previous  DBT  research  suggests  that  a  weaker  therapeutic
alliance is associated with higher therapy dropout rates [36] and
that alliance rupture and repair processes in the early stage of
treatment  differ  between  recovered  and  unrecovered  patients
with BPD [37]. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the
telehealth  setting  hampers  the  effective  establishment  of  a

Vonderlin et al

therapeutic  alliance  and  increases  the  likelihood  of  alliance
ruptures.  While  some  studies  show  comparability  between
telehealth  and  in-person  treatment  formats  [38,39],  others
suggest  that  telehealth  therapies  may  be  less  conducive  to
developing  an  alliance  than  in-person  therapies.  Despite  the
pivotal  role  of  the  therapeutic  alliance  in  DBT,  at  this  point,
there  is  no  conclusive  evidence  as  to  how  well  a  therapeutic
alliance can be established and maintained in telehealth DBT.

Previous Research on Telehealth DBT
Two  scoping  reviews  have  been  conducted  to  document  the
research evidence associated with the online delivery of DBT
for  individuals  with  BPD  [24,40].  van  Leeuwen  et  al  [40]
conducted  their  review  to  document  the  research  evidence
regarding  the  efficacy  and  clinical  use  of  telepsychology  in
DBT.  The  studies  they  included  in  their  review  were
heterogenous and ranged from the online delivery of treatment
(eg, telehealth defined as videoconferencing for individual and
group  sessions,  to  the  use  of  telephone  coaching  between
sessions,  to  the  integration  of  mobile  apps  as  stand-alone  or
hybrid interventions, to the integration of virtual reality elements
in treatment). Overall, they included 41 studies; however, only
2 of these trials investigated telehealth DBT applied by therapists
via  videoconferencing  systems  for  patients  with  BPD
specifically  [41,42].  In  a  second  review,  Lakeman  et  al  [24]
similarly reviewed the online delivery of DBT for a range of
different mental disorders. They showed that attendance tended
to  be  higher  in  telehealth  format  and  clinical  improvements
were comparable to in-person formats. However, many of the
original  trials  also  highlighted  challenges  related  to  risk
management, therapist preparedness, and technical difficulties.
The  authors  concluded  that  despite  various  challenges,  the
telehealth  delivery  of  DBT  programs  is  more  accessible  and
feasible  and  equally  acceptable,  safe,  and  effective  as  the
in-person  delivery.  However,  of  the  11  trials  included  in  this
review, only 1 trial was conducted with patients with BPD [43],
therefore it remains unclear whether their conclusions can be
generalized to BPD-specific populations.

While the aforementioned results suggest the telehealth delivery
of DBT may be promising, a closer look into the primary studies
included in the 2 reviews reveals a number of limitations that
impact the conclusions we can draw from them. For example,
Lopez et al [41] conducted a nonrandomized trial comparing
attendance, client satisfaction, and group cohesion measures in
a telehealth DBT skills group (n=20) compared to an in-person
skills  group  (n=15).  They  found  that  attendance  rates  were
significantly  higher  in  the  telehealth  format  (91%  vs  75%),
though  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  satisfaction
between the groups. Cohesion measures between group members
and their therapists showed no differences, although cohesion
between  group  members  was  significantly  higher  in  the
in-person group. Additionally, clients were not randomized but
instead allowed to select their preferred group format. Finally,
their  study  did  not  report  on  clinical  outcomes  related  to
borderline  symptoms,  which  means  we  cannot  compare  the
clinical effectiveness of the 2 treatment formats on this domain.

Salamin et al [42] analyzed diary card data of 7 patients with
BPD within a treatment that had to be shifted from in-person

https://formative.jmir.org/2025/1/e66181

XSL•FO
RenderX

to telehealth format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first
8  weeks  of  treatment,  patients  received  weekly  in-person
individual sessions as well as group sessions. Due to COVID-19
restrictions, treatment shifted to telehealth, and patients received
weekly individual sessions by telephone or videoconferencing
and group therapy was replaced with personal coaching. Weekly
monitoring  of  problem  behaviors  showed  a  decrease  in
binge-eating behaviors and a trend toward a decrease in alcohol
consumption following the shift to telehealth treatment. Results
also indicated that while clients reported a decrease in feelings
of  shame  or  guilt,  fear  and  tension  following  the  move  to  a
telehealth format, their general level of distress increased. Given
the small sample size and lack of a control group, as well as the
significant confound of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic
that spurred the change in format to begin with, results from
this  study  cannot  reliably  be  attributed  to  the  treatment  or
delivery format.

Alavi et al [43] investigated the effectiveness of an email-based
DBT intervention compared to an in-person DBT skills group
in  107  patients  with  BPD.  While  there  were  no  significant
differences between the treatment formats, these findings must
be interpreted with caution: the DBT intervention consisted of
only 15 sessions, and less than 50% of patients in either group
completed treatment and were included in the analysis.

In summary, there is limited evidence regarding the feasibility
and effectiveness of telehealth comprehensive DBT.

Objective of This Study
In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  investigate  the  acceptance,  safety,
and  effect  sizes  of  a  1-year  comprehensive  outpatient  DBT
program delivered telehealth for individuals with BPD within
a controlled research setting. We were interested in the effect
sizes  for  BPD  symptoms  and  quality  of  life,  and  whether
self-harm  and  dissociative  symptoms  could  be  targeted  and
effectively managed in a telehealth setting. To understand the
acceptability  and  feasibility  of  telehealth  DBT,  we  collected
clients’ and therapists’ perspectives on the delivery of telehealth
treatment.  Finally,  to  determine  whether  a  strong  therapeutic
relationship could be established in a telehealth treatment, we
measured both therapists’ and clients’ ratings of the quality of
the alliance throughout treatment.

Methods

Study Design
The data originate from a pilot psychotherapy trial comparing
2 different forms of DBT (standard DBT and trauma-focused
DBT) within a telehealth setting. This pilot trial was designed
to test the feasibility, safety, and acceptance of telehealth DBT
and to prepare for a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT)
of trauma-focused DBT. In order to ensure comparability with
existing studies in the field, we chose to solely analyze the study
arm that delivered telehealth standard (comprehensive) DBT,
as  developed  by  Marsha  Linehan  [12-14].  The  study  was
conducted across 2 sites in Germany (Mannheim and Bochum)
and 1 site in Canada (Toronto) between February 2022 and June
2023.  The  pilot  study  was  registered  in  the  German  Clinical

Trials Register (DRKS00027824) and received approval from
the respective ethical review boards at each participating site.

Intervention and Treatment
Participants  received  a  12-month  outpatient  standard  DBT
intervention,  which  comprised  weekly  individual  therapy
sessions (each lasting 50 minutes) and weekly group sessions
(each lasting 100 minutes). All individual and group sessions
were delivered via telehealth using videoconferencing platforms.
The treatment was based on Marsha Linehan DBT treatment
manual [13,14]. The group therapy focused on skill-building in
mindfulness,  distress  tolerance,  emotion  regulation,  and
interpersonal  effectiveness.  Individual  session  agendas  were
informed  by  a  review  of  clients’ diary  cards.  All  skills  were
taught  twice  (ie,  2  rounds  of  a  20-session  curriculum).  In
individual therapy, treatment targets were prioritized based on
the  dynamic  hierarchy  focus  of  DBT 
that  addresses
life-threatening  behavior,  therapy-interfering  behavior,  and
quality-of-life-interfering behavior, as needed. After completing
the 12-month therapy period, clients were offered up to 5 booster
sessions, which could be scheduled flexibly within the 6 months
following  treatment  termination.  Treatment  was  considered
concluded once the booster sessions were finished. No specific
adjustments were made to the treatment content to accommodate
the telehealth format. However, patients completed their diary
cards electronically via an app on their personal smartphones
to  facilitate  diary  card  review.  Participants  who  missed  4
consecutive  weeks  of  individual  therapy  were  categorized  as
treatment  dropouts.  Completion  according  to  protocol  (ATP)
was defined as attending a minimum of 32 individual sessions,
which equaled 80% of the expected dosage. All therapists (n=16)
were trained in DBT with at least 2 days of theoretical DBT
training completed at the beginning of the study (mean 4.7, SD
2.2 days), and at least half a year of clinical DBT experience
(mean 3.6, SD 3.4 years). All therapists participated in a DBT
consultation team to guide the treatment, which occurred on a
weekly basis, consisting of 1.5-hour sessions per week.

Participants
Participants were recruited from outpatient clinic waiting lists
in  Mannheim,  Bochum,  and  Toronto,  as  well  as  through
advertisements and therapist referrals. Inclusion criteria were
individuals  aged  18-65  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  BPD,  and
meeting at least 5 of 9 criteria outlined in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders [Fifth  Edition]).
Additionally,  participants  needed  to  commit  to  1  year  of
outpatient  treatment  and  be  willing  to  engage  in  telehealth
therapy (with internet-enabled devices provided to participants,
if  needed).  Proficiency  in  English  (for  the  Toronto  site)  or
German  (for  the  Mannheim  and  Bochum  sites)  and  written
informed consent were further prerequisites for participation.
Exclusion  criteria  represented  symptoms  that  indicated  a
different treatment model or setting was likely needed, such as
a  lifetime  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia,  bipolar  I  disorder,
intellectual  disability  (IQ<70),  posttraumatic  stress  disorder
(PTSD),  a  BMI  below  17.5,  severe  substance  use  disorder
according to DSM-5 requiring medical withdrawal support, and
dementia. Additionally, individuals with more than 8 weeks of
DBT in the preceding year were excluded.

As  depicted  in  the  flowchart  (Figure  1),  258  individuals
underwent  telephone  screening  for  eligibility,  with  126
undergoing full assessment. Ultimately, 81 (64%) individuals
met the inclusion or exclusion criteria and were randomized to
receive either standard DBT treatment (n=39; 48%) or a newly
adapted DBT treatment (trauma-focused DBT; n=42, 52%). As
this study only analyzed acceptance, safety, and effect sizes for
standard  telehealth  DBT,  our  final  sample  comprised  39
participants  enrolled  in  the  1-year  telehealth  standard  DBT
program.  Among  these,  15  (38%)  individuals  discontinued
treatment and were classified as dropouts. One client ended the
treatment  as  an  early  responder.  Additionally,  12  (31%)
participants did not provide assessments postintervention and
were excluded from the analysis ATP. Consequently, 18 (46%)
participants were included in the ATP analysis post intervention.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) sample comprised all 39 participants
who were randomly assigned to telehealth standard DBT.

Measures

Primary Clinical Outcome

Borderline Symptom List-23

The Borderline Symptom List-23 (BSL-23) [44] was used to
assess the borderline symptoms of participants throughout the
trial. This self-report instrument comprises 23 items assessing

borderline-typical symptoms on a 5-point Likert Scale, ranging
from 0=not at all to 4=very strong. Widely used, the BSL-23
has demonstrated good psychometric properties [44,45]. In our
sample, Cronbach α for the BSL-23 was 0.92. Assessment points
included  pre-  and  postintervention  points,  as  well  as  every  3
months during the treatment period.

Secondary Clinical Outcomes

Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory

The Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI) [46] is a self-report
questionnaire  designed  to  assess  nonsuicidal  self-injuries
(NSSIs). Comprising 17 items, the DSHI captures data on the
frequency, severity, duration, and type of self-harm behaviors.
This  instrument  was  administered  both  before  and  post
intervention,  as  well  as  every  3  months  during  the  treatment
phase. In these analyses, we used the frequency score of the
DSHI to determine the proportion of clients showing any NSSI
in the last 10 weeks.

Dissociative Symptom Scale

The  Dissociative  Symptom  Scale  (DSS)  [47]  is  a  20-item
self-report  questionnaire  aimed  at  assessing  dissociative
symptoms.  Participants  are  asked  how  often  they  have
experienced dissociative symptoms over the last week ranging
from 0=not at all to 4=more than once a day. It consists of 4
dimensions: depersonalization, derealization, gaps in awareness
or  memory,  and  dissociative  reexperiencing.  Since  we  were
interested  in  the  effect  sizes  on  dissociative  symptoms  as  a
secondary  outcome,  we  analyzed  a  global  mean  of  the  DSS
across all dimensions. The DSS was administered before and
post interventions as well as every 3 months during treatment.

Feasibility and Acceptability Outcomes

Acceptability of Intervention Measure

The  Acceptability  of  Intervention  Measure  (AIM)  [48]  is  a
15-item scale designed to assess therapists’ perspectives on the
acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the delivered
treatment. Widely used in implementation research, AIM has
exhibited robust psychometric properties across various studies
[48]. In our sample, intercorrelations between dimensions ranged
from r=0.81 to 0.90. Therefore, we computed a mean score by
combining  the  3  dimensions  for  analysis.  Administration
occurred after 6 months of treatment and post intervention.

Client Satisfaction Questionnaire

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) [49] is an 8-item
scale that measures the client’s satisfaction with the treatment
and treatment provider on a 4-point Likert scale. The CSQ-8
was administered after 6 months of treatment as well as post
intervention.

Usability of Technology

the  UTAUT 

The  unified  theory  of  acceptance  and  use  of  technology
(UTAUT) [50] assesses acceptance toward digital health care
interventions  based  on 
framework.  The
questionnaire consists of 20 items assessing behavioral intention
(4 items), performance expectancy (3 items), effort expectancy
(3 items), social influence (2 items), facilitating conditions (2
items),  internet  anxiety  (3  items),  and  experience  with  the
internet (3 items) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0=not
at all to 4=very strong. We adapted items to also assess their
treatment.  The  UTAUT  was
usability 
administered before and post interventions as well as at 6 months
(midtreatment).  Intercorrelations  between  dimensions  ranged
from r=0.80 to 0.91. Consequently, we computed a mean score
to combine dimensions for analysis.

Severe Adverse Events

Severe adverse events (SAEs) were defined in accordance with
the  guidelines  of  good  clinical  practice.  They  encompassed
suicide attempts or other events leading to death or posing an
acute threat to life, where the study participant is in imminent
danger of death at the time of the SAE. Therapists were queried
weekly regarding the occurrence of potential SAEs. In the event
of an SAE, therapists provided additional details to assess its
intensity,  outcome,  and  relationship  to  psychotherapeutic
treatment. For safety purposes, all observed SAEs were promptly
reported to the responsible ethics committee at the respective
study site.

Working Alliance Inventory

The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) [51] was used to assess
the  therapeutic  alliance  from  both  therapists’ and  clients’
perspectives.  The  scale  comprises  12  items  assessing  the
therapeutic alliance on 3 dimensions: bonding, agreement on
tasks, and agreement on goals. Therapists and their clients rate
these items on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1=never to
7=always. Each therapist received separate questionnaires for
each of their clients if they treated more than 1 client. The WAI
was administered every 3 months during the treatment period.
In  our  sample,  intercorrelations  between  dimensions  ranged
from r=0.81 to 0.87 on the client level and from r=0.80 to 0.90
on the therapist level. Consequently, we computed a mean score
to combine the 3 dimensions for analysis.

Statistical Analyses
To determine treatment effects, we analyzed BPD symptoms
on the BSL-23 as the primary outcome. As secondary outcomes,
we analyzed the quality of life, dissociation, and self-harm of
participants  throughout  the  treatment.  Given  the  nonlinearity
of  treatment  effects  over  time,  we  used  a  nonparametric
Friedman test to assess differences among repeated measures.
The Friedman test is robust and capable of handling nonnormal
distributions and outliers. Effect sizes for pre-post comparisons
for  each  outcome  were  analyzed  using  Cohen  d,  providing
insights  into  the  magnitude  of  treatment  effects.  We  also
calculated 95% CIs to test the robustness of effect size estimates.
To compare the proportion of patients showing at least 1 NSSI
in  the  last  10  weeks  between  pre-  and  posttreatments,  we
calculated risk ratio (RR) according to Altman [52] with the
following equation, where a represented the number of patients
with  at  least  1  NSSI  at  postintervention,  b represented  the
number  of  patients  without  NSSI  at  postintervention,  c
represented  the  number  of  patients  with  at  least  1  NSSI  at
preintervention,  and  d represented  the  number  of  patients
without self-harm at preintervention.

To assess the safety of the telehealth trial, we examined SAEs
(eg, serious and life-threatening suicide attempts) throughout
the study, NSSI as well as individual symptom trajectories of

to 

identify  potential  symptom

To evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of the telehealth trial,
we conducted descriptive analyses of the client and therapist
feasibility  and  acceptance  measures,  as  well  as  client  and
therapist ratings of the therapeutic alliance.

To  analyze  the  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  sample,  including  all
participants  who  had  been  randomized  to  the  treatment,  we
imputed missing data by multiple imputation procedures [53].
Multiple imputation was based on the scale-level values of other
assessment points and the dropout status (yes or no) to impute
missing data. Since the missing pattern was not monotone, the
Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  method  [54]  was  used.  Multiple
imputation was based on the SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute)
multiple imputation procedures (1000 runs) and MIANALYZE.
P values<.05 (2-tailed) were considered statistically significant.

BPD symptoms occurred within the first 3 months of treatment,
with a further albeit smaller decrease observed throughout the
remainder of the treatment period. Post–BSL-23 scores were a
mean 0.91 (SD 0.60) in the ATP sample and a mean 1.20 (SD

0.65) in the ITT sample, indicating mild BPD symptoms in the
ATP sample and moderate BPD symptoms in the ITT sample
after treatment, respectively.

Dissociative symptoms exhibited a small, but significant decline
in  the  ATP  (χ²4=11.1;  P=.02;  d=0.37)  and  ITT  samples
(χ²4=12.3;  P=.02;  d=0.45)  with  clients  reporting  fewer
dissociative  symptoms  throughout  the  treatment  course.
However, all 95% CIs of dissociation effect sizes included zero.
Self-harm (DSHI scores) significantly decreased over the course
of treatment, with 80% of clients engaging in at least 1 self-harm
event in the last 10 weeks before treatment compared to 28%
after treatment (χ²4=16.60; P<.001; RR 0.35).

The  significant  reduction  in  clinical  symptoms  was  mirrored
by an increase in quality of life, displaying a large effect size
in  the  ATP  (χ²4=14.5;  P<.001;  d=1.24)  and  a  medium  effect
size in the ITT sample (χ²4= 31.0; P<.001; d=0.65). The pre-post

Safety
During the course of treatment, 1 SAE was recorded. One patient
was  hospitalized  following  a  suicide  attempt  involving  an
overdose in week 12 of treatment. The therapist rated this SAE
as  moderate  and  potentially  linked  to  the  psychotherapeutic
treatment.  In  addition,  individual  patient  trajectories  in  BPD
symptoms were observed graphically for safety assessment, as
illustrated in Figure 3. The majority of clients demonstrated a
consistent decrease in BPD symptoms throughout the treatment
duration.

Acceptance, Feasibility, and Usability of Telehealth
Treatment
The results regarding the acceptance and feasibility of clients
are summarized in Table 2 and depicted in Multimedia Appendix
1. Clients reported high levels of satisfaction with the treatment.
97% (29/30) of clients reported high satisfaction with telehealth
DBT treatment midway through therapy (mean 3.33, SD 0.54
on the CSQ-8) and 87% (20/23) reported high satisfaction at
the end of treatment (mean 3.40, SD 0.74). Prior to treatment,
69%  (27/39)  of  clients  anticipated  that  the  telehealth  format
would be very or mostly usable for receiving DBT treatment
(mean 2.81, SD 0.59 on the UTAUT). This percentage increased
slightly during treatment to 77% (23/30) at midtherapy (mean
2.83, SD 0.72) and further to 83% (19/23) at the end of treatment
(mean 3.13, SD 0.67).

The results regarding the acceptance and feasibility of therapists
are summarized in Table 2 and depicted in Multimedia Appendix
2. From therapists' perspective, 86% (12/14) found the telehealth
DBT treatment to be very acceptable, feasible, and appropriate
for  their  clients  (mean  4.21,  SD  0.74  on  the  AIM).  This
percentage rose to 91% (10/11) after the completion of treatment
(mean  4.53,  SD  0.61).  Prior  to  treatment,  53%  (8/15)  of
therapists anticipated that the telehealth format would be very
much  or  mostly  usable  for  delivering  DBT  treatment  (mean
2.48,  SD  0.84  on  the  UTAUT).  However,  this  percentage
slightly  decreased  during  treatment  to  45%  (5/11),  with
therapists rating the telehealth format as very or mostly usable
for delivering DBT after treatment (mean 2.57, SD 0.71).

Therapeutic Alliance
The  therapeutic  alliance,  as  assessed  by  both  clients  and
therapists, is summarized in Table 2 and depicted in Multimedia
Appendix  1 for  clients  and  Multimedia  Appendix  2 for
therapists. From the client perspective, 82% (28/34) reported
experiencing a (very) high affective bond with their therapists
and demonstrated (very) high agreement on treatment-related
tasks  and  goals  (mean  5.52,  SD  1.08  on  the  WAI).  This
percentage increased to 96% (27/28) at midtherapy (mean 5.89,
SD 0.75) before slightly decreasing to 84% at 9 months into
treatment (mean 5.65, SD 1.28).

Similarly,  therapist  perspectives  revealed  that  80%  (28/25)
reported a (very) high affective bond with their clients and rated
(very)  high  agreement  on  treatment-related  tasks  and  goals
(mean 5.24, SD 0.98 on the WAI). This percentage increased
slightly  to  87%  (16/19)  at  midtherapy  (mean  5.30,  SD  0.99)
before  decreasing  slightly  to  84%  (21/25)  at  9  months  into
treatment (mean 5.40, SD 0.88).

A  moderate  yet  significant  intercorrelation  was  observed
between  therapist  and  client  ratings,  with  r=0.52  (t78=5.35;
P<.001) across all subscales and all 3 assessment times.

Discussion

Primary Results
This  pilot  study  aimed  to  provide  initial  insights  into  the
acceptance, safety, and effect sizes of standard (comprehensive)
DBT treatment delivered via telehealth (ie, the online delivery
of treatment via a video web-based platform) within a controlled
research setting. Our findings indicate large pre-post effect sizes
on  BPD  symptoms  (d=1.13-1.44)  and  quality  of 
life
(d=0.65-1.24)  in  both  the  ITT  and  ATP  samples,  despite  a
relatively  high  dropout  rate  of  38%  (n=15).  One  SAE  was
recorded during the study, attributed to hospitalization following
a  suicide  attempt.  Client  ratings  reflected  high  levels  of
satisfaction  and  usability,  with  97%  (29/30)  expressing  high
satisfaction with the treatment and 83% (19/23) reporting high
usability  of  the  telehealth  format.  Therapists  also  expressed
strong acceptance of the treatment, with 91% (10/11) indicating
high acceptance. Interestingly, therapists rated the usability of
the  telehealth  format  comparatively  lower  than  clients,  with
only 53% (8/15) reporting high usability. The majority of clients
(27/28, 96%) and therapists (16/19, 87%) were able to establish
a strong therapeutic relationship through telehealth contact.

the  heterogeneity 

Comparison With Prior DBT Studies
The dropout rate of 38% (n=15) in this telehealth trial was higher
than  the  average  dropout  rate  of  28%  reported  in  the
meta-analysis  on  in-person  DBT  trials  [55].  One  possible
explanation  for  this  is  the  influence  of  the  telehealth  setting.
Given  both 
in  dropout  rates  across
psychotherapy trials and the lack of an in-person control group
in this study to contextualize this result, this finding should be
interpreted with caution. Past research has yielded conflicting
results  regarding  attendance  and  dropout  rates  in  telehealth
versus  in-person  treatments,  with  some  studies  indicating  no
differences between telehealth and in-person DBT, while others
have suggested even higher attendance rates in the telehealth
format [26,41]. Future studies should aim to directly compare
dropout rates between telehealth and in-person DBT programs
within RCTs as a broader framework is necessary to determine
which clients are more likely to benefit from telehealth settings.

The  estimation  of  effect  sizes  in  this  trial  demonstrated  a
significant reduction in BPD symptoms, with large effect sizes
of  d=1.13  in  the  ITT  sample  and  d=1.44  in  the  ATP  sample
throughout the treatment period. According to the interpretation
guidelines for the BSL-23 proposed by Kleindienst et al [56],
participants  experienced  a  decrease  in  average  borderline
symptom  severity  from  high  at  baseline  to  moderate  at
post-intervention  in  the  ITT  sample,  and  mild  in  the  ATP
sample, respectively. Comparing these outcomes with previous
in-person  DBT  trials  using  a  similar  treatment  dosage,  our
results  suggest  that  clinical  effectiveness  in  our  trial  is
comparable or even slightly higher. For instance, McMain et al
[57] reported a pre-post reduction of d=0.67. Similarly, Priebe
et al [58] observed a significant decrease in BPD symptoms, as

Vonderlin et al

assessed by the Zanarini Rating Scale, with an effect size of
d=0.71 from pre- to postintervention in a 12-month in-person
DBT  treatment.  McMain  et  al  [59]  found  that  a  12-month
in-person DBT treatment yielded a pre-post effect size of d=1.23
on the Zanarini Rating Scale. Sinnaeve et al [60] demonstrated
a  significant  decrease  in  the  Borderline  Personality  Disorder
Symptom Index [61], with an effect size of d=1.15 from pre-
to post-intervention in a 12-month outpatient in-person DBT
treatment.

Of note, in our study, dissociative symptoms showed only small
effect sizes of d=0.37 in the ATP and d=0.45 in the ITT sample
with the 95% CIs containing 0. This finding may be due, in part,
to the relatively low baseline dissociative scores of mean 0.91
(SD  0.61)  and  mean  0.99  (SD  0.67)  likely  related  to  our
exclusion  of  patients  with  BPD  with  comorbid  PTSD,  who
typically  present  higher  dissociative  symptoms  compared  to
those without PTSD [62]. Our dissociation findings therefore
continue  the  ongoing  debate  on  the  effectiveness  of  DBT  in
reducing  dissociative  experiences.  According  to  the  current
Cochrane  Review,  DBT  has  a  medium  effect  size  for
dissociation (d=0.43) across primary studies compared to waitlist
and treatment-as-usual control groups [15]. Moreover, research
suggests that greater effects on dissociation can be achieved by
adapting a trauma-focused approach within DBT and explicitly
teaching clients antidissociative skills, which were not included
in our standard DBT protocol [63,64]. Consequently, our study
does  not  allow  us  to  conclude  whether  and  how  dissociative
symptoms can be effectively addressed through the telehealth
format. Future research should address this question by directly
comparing  the  management  of  dissociative  symptoms  in
telehealth versus in-person settings.

Self-harm  and  suicidal  behavior  in  our  study  significantly
decreased with a large reduction of participants’ NSSI of RR
0.35  in  the  ATP  sample.  While  80%  of  participants  reported
engaging in at least 1 self-harm episode in the months preceding
treatment initiation, this number decreased significantly to 28%
postintervention.  This  finding  aligns  with  prior  research
indicating the efficacy of DBT in reducing NSSI behaviors by
empowering individuals to attain behavioral control [60,65,66].
Importantly, our study suggests that the reduction of self-harm
can be also effectively achieved in a telehealth format. Notably,
there  was  1  SAE,  a  suicide  attempt  by  overdose,  during  the
treatment  period,  with  no  recorded  completed  suicides.  In
previous in-person DBT trials, the prevalence of suicide attempts
requiring medical attention (eg, emergency department visits)
over a 12-month treatment period has ranged from 3.5% to 6.7%
[57,67,68]. Based on these prevalence rates, we would expect
1 to 3 suicide attempts in a cohort of 39 patients. Thus, the single
suicide attempt recorded in our study aligns with this expected
range and does not suggest an increased occurrence of suicide
attempts in telehealth treatment settings.

In terms of the therapeutic alliance, our study showed that over
80% of clients and therapists reported a very strong alliance.
Mean scores for the therapeutic alliance ranged from mean 5.24
(SD 0.98) to mean 5.89 (SD 0.75) on a 7-point Likert scale of
the WAI. These scores are comparable to, or even higher than,
those reported in studies administering the same questionnaire
in in-person DBT trials [36,69]. However, this finding may be

https://formative.jmir.org/2025/1/e66181

XSL•FO
RenderX

biased  as  participants  who  dropped  out  of  treatment  also
discontinued  completing  the  alliance  measure,  potentially
inflating  alliance  ratings  over  the  course  of  treatment.
Nonetheless,  our  results  indicate  that  a  strong  therapeutic
alliance can be achieved in telehealth DBT settings. This finding
challenges  the  argument  that  telehealth  treatment  leads  to
heightened disengagement or weak therapeutic alliances between
clients and therapists [20,70].

Satisfaction and acceptance ratings in our sample were high,
with 91% of therapists rating the acceptance of the treatment
as high and 98% of participants indicating satisfaction with the
treatment.  These  findings  align  with  previous  research
demonstrating  high  acceptance  and  satisfaction  rates  of
telehealth psychotherapy for patients with personality disorders
[71].  From  the  participants’ perspective,  useability  ratings  of
the telehealth format for delivering DBT were also high, with
69%-83% indicating high usability. Interestingly, participants’
useability  ratings  significantly  increased  throughout  the
treatment,  potentially  indicating  that  those  with  initially  low
useability  ratings  may  have  dropped  out  of  treatment.
Unfortunately,  our  sample  size  was  insufficient  to  robustly
analyze  useability  as  a  predictor  of  therapy  dropout  during
telehealth  treatment.  Future  studies  should  explore  potential
predictors for treatment success related to the usability of the
telehealth format. In contrast, therapists' perception of telehealth
format  usability  was  notably  lower,  with  only  half  of  the
therapists (45%-53%) indicating high usability for delivering
psychotherapy via telehealth. This discrepancy may be attributed
to the greater adjustments required by therapists, transitioning
from  in-person  to  telehealth  psychotherapy  delivery.  This
finding  is  consistent  with  prior  research  identifying  various
barriers, challenges, and concerns among therapists delivering
DBT via telehealth [20]. Thus, future research should explore
strategies  to  enhance  therapists'  usability  experiences  during
telehealth  treatment.  We  would  also  argue  that  telehealth
psychotherapy need not replace in-person psychotherapy, but
rather can be used as a complement for clients in need. Both
modalities  offer  valuable  options  for  delivering  effective  and
accessible  treatment.  Future  studies  should  consider  how  to
tailor treatment delivery format to individual preferences and
circumstances.

Limitations
There  are  some  limitations  that  should  be  considered  when
interpreting the study’s results. First, the exclusion of patients
with comorbid PTSD limits the representativeness of the studied
population, particularly its applicability and generalizability to
all  patients  with  BPD.  Therefore,  we  caution  against
generalizing these results to patients with BPD and comorbid
PTSD.  Second,  the  absence  of  a  control  group  directly
comparing telehealth and in-person conditions within the same
trial  and  cohort  impedes  drawing  inferential  conclusions
regarding  the  relative  efficacy  of  telehealth  versus  in-person
DBT. Lastly, the small sample size of 39 clients did not allow
us to analyze potential moderator effects on treatment outcomes
or dropout rates. Given the limitations of this pilot and feasibility
study, future research should include RCTs with larger sample
sizes  to  directly  compare  telehealth  and  in-person  DBT
treatments.

Conclusions
Our findings provide a first indication that telehealth DBT for
BPD  appears  clinically  efficacious,  safe,  feasible,  and  well
accepted. However, the dropout rate was higher compared to
other  studies  investigating  in-person  delivered  DBT.  Future
research should compare the efficacy of telehealth DBT with
in-person formats in RCTs. Overall, telehealth-delivered DBT

offers  a  potentially  effective  alternative  to  in-person  DBT,
enhancing treatment accessibility and overcoming barriers to
treatment  engagement.  This  knowledge  may  be  particularly
useful for increasing access to treatment for those in rural areas
or low- and middle-income countries where traveling distances
to specialized DBT practitioners or treatment programs may be
a large barrier.
