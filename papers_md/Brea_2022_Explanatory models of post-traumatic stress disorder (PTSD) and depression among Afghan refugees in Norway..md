Abstract 
Background:  The current situation in Afghanistan makes it likely that we are facing a new wave of Afghan refu-
gees, warranting more knowledge about how to deal with mental health problems among them. This study aims to 
gain more knowledge on Explanatory Models (EM) of depression and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) among 
Afghan refugees resettled in Norway.

Methods:  We conducted six gender-separated, semi-structured focusgroup interviews based on vignettes with 
Afghan refugees (total N 
PTSD symptoms in line with DSM-5 and ICD-10 criteria.

Results:  The findings showed that EM varied with gender, age, generation, and migration stories. Participants sug-
gested different potential causes, risk factors, and ways of managing symptoms of depression and PTSD depending 
on the context (e.g., in Norway vs. Afghanistan). In describing the causes of the depression/PTSD in the vignettes, 
females tended to emphasize domestic problems and gender issues while males focused more on acculturation chal-
lenges. The younger males discussed mostly traumatic experiences before and during flight as possible causes.

Conclusion:  The practice of condensing a single set of EMs within a group may not only be analytically challenging 
in a time-pressed clinical setting but also misleading. Rather, we advocate asking empathic questions and roughly 
mapping individual refugee patients’ perceptions on causes and treatment as a better starting point for building trust-
ing relationships and inviting patients to share and put into practice their expertise about their own lives.

Background
While many groups of refugees have consistently shown 
high  prevalence  of  mental  health  problems  [1–4], 
underutilization  of  mental  health  services,  alternative 
help-seeking  preferences,  and  different  illness  explana-
tory  models  have  consistently  posed  barriers  for  effec-
tive  treatment  [5–7].  Earlier  research  has  documented 
variations  in  the  way  refugee  groups  explain  and  view

mental  health  problems  [8,  9].  Discrepancies  in  under-
standing  conceptions  of  mental  health  may  hamper  the 
recognition  of  mental  health  problems  in  patients  from 
other societies, with the risk of misdiagnosis or treatment 
failure.

The current situation in Afghanistan in the fall of 2021 
makes it likely that we are facing a new wave of Afghan 
refugees, warranting more knowledge about how to deal 
with  mental  health  problems  among  them.  In  this  arti-
cle,  we  investigate  explanatory  models  (EMs)  of  post-
traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and depression among 
Afghan refugees settled in Norway. We argue for a need

to venture beyond notions of static cultural models, since 
culture is often characterized by intra-cultural variations 
(differences within a cultural group related to e.g., geog-
raphy,  education,  gender  and  occupation);  a  dynamic 
interplay between individual agency and social processes; 
and renegotiations of cultural understandings and inter-
pretations with others [10, 11]. Thus, we propose a need 
to  improve  our  understanding  and  identify  how  refugee 
groups  perceive  and  prefer  to  cope  with  mental  health 
problems in dynamic, fluid, and multiple ways.

Explanatory models

The concept of illness explanatory models (EMs) has been 
employed  to  ensure  culturally  sensitive  care,  enhance 
therapeutic alliances between professionals and patients, 
and  improve  our  understanding  of  help-seeking  paths, 
treatment  compliance,  and  receptivity  to  health  promo-
tion messages [12–14]. A string of seminal works in med-
ical  anthropology  throughout  the  1970’s  (e.g.,  [15–17]) 
led  to  the  recognition  that  patient-doctor  interactions 
are  transactions  between  EMs  that  may  often  diverge 
from  each  other  in  terms  of  explanations,  expectations 
and  goals  [18].  Kleinman  [19]  defined  EMs  as  notions 
about an illness episode and the treatment employed by 
those  involved  in  a  clinical  process,  including  patients, 
their families, and their doctors. With the aid of a series 
of qualitative questions, Kleinman attempted to bring to 
light variations  in  beliefs about causes  for  a  patient’s ill-
ness and ideas about treatment and outcomes, as a clini-
cal tool.

Finding  that  differences  in  perceptions  about  symp-
toms  and  treatment  may  cause  patients  to  underutilize 
public  health  services  or  drop  out  of  treatment  [5,  20, 
21],  a  great  deal  of  research  has  focused  on  mapping 
explanatory  models  among  various  ethnic  groups,  refu-
gees, and migrants [8, 22–24]. Many studies in this field 
have found that mental health problems such as depres-
sion and PTSD are often perceived as resulting from psy-
chosocial  causes  rather  than  physical  or  biological  [24], 
and that participants in these studies often prefer to cope 
with their problems by relying on e.g., family, social net-
works, traditional healers, and religious practices, rather 
than professional treatment inside public health services.
The  concern  that  a  lack  of  understanding  of  percep-
tions  of  mental  health  problems  in  low-income  and 
war-torn  countries  may  represent  a  barrier  towards 
effective  treatment  for  refugees,  has  led  to  a  revision  of 
the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disor-
ders  (DSM-5).  Consequently,  in  DSM-5  cultural  concept 
of distress is used to distinguish cultural traits of mental 
health  experiences  including  cultural  explanations  or 
perceived  causes,  as  well  as  cultural  idioms  of  distress 
and  cultural  syndromes  [25].  Nevertheless,  being  able 

to  map  and  identify  clear-cut  models  of  people’s  expla-
nations of illnesses and preferred ways of treating them, 
is  still  problematic.  Kleinman  [19]  maintained  that  EMs 
among patients, their families, and doctors may each be 
multiple. Subsequent research found that EMs may con-
sist  of  a  variety  of  often  contradictory  explanations  that 
may  be  held  at  the  same  time,  rather  than  a  coherent 
set  of  beliefs  [11,  26,  27].  Kleinman  [28]  argued  against 
the  formalism,  specificity,  and  boldness  of  explanatory 
models.  The  idea  that  people  are  equipped  with  static 
illness-related  templates  has  been  challenged  by  studies 
that  have  found  considerable  intra-cultural  differences, 
for instance, differences related to geography, education, 
gender, and occupation [29–32].

Furthermore, perceptions of illness and treatment pref-
erences have been found to be transient and inconsistent 
among patients across time [33], and may vary according 
to  social  context,  i.e.,  person  presenting  different  EMs 
at home, at work, and in the doctor’s office [11]. Studies 
have  also  found  that  professional  biomedical  EMs  may 
influence  popular  ideas  about  illness  in  several  ways, 
making unclear distinctions between professional and lay 
person’s  EMs  [34].  Moreover,  positive  experiences  from 
encounters with public mental health services, or beliefs 
and practices in the country of settlement, may improve 
the  use  of  public  mental  health  services  [7,  35].  Conse-
quently, there is a need for a better understanding of how 
these kinds of dynamic processes may also influence EMs 
among refugees.

Explanatory models among Afghan refugees

In  the  current  study,  we  explore  explanatory  models  of 
PTSD  and  depression  among  Afghan  refugees  resettled 
in  Norway.  We  investigate  variations  in  EMs  related  to 
gender  and  age  and  pose  the  question  of  how  processes 
of migration and acculturation may influence the Afghan 
EMs of depression and PTSD. Research has consistently 
shown  high  prevalence  of,  and  comorbidity  between 
PTSD  and  depression  in  refugee  populations,  including 
Afghans  [2,  4,  36–41].  A  survey  conducted  in  Afghani-
stan suggested that one out of two Afghans (50%) is suf-
fering  from  psychological  distress  and  one  out  of  five 
(20%)  is  impaired  in  his  or  her  role  because  of  mental 
health problems [42]. The report concluded that Afghan 
people  are  very  much  exposed  to  trauma  and  PTSD  is 
frequent in contrast to other disorders such as clinically 
significant  major  depression  disorders  or  generalized 
anxiety [42].

Studies  among  Afghan  refugees  resettled  in  vari-
ous  parts  of  the  world  report  a  variety  of  ways  to  cope 
with  mental  health  challenges,  including  confronting 
stressors,  helping  others,  social  support,  focus  on  the 
future,  religion,  exercise,  avoidance,  positive  thinking,

and  professional  help,  among  others,  although  infor-
mal  help-seeking  seems  to  be  preferred  [5,  43–46].  The 
same variation applies to attributed causes of stress. For 
instance,  a  study  among  Afghan  refugees  in  New  Zea-
land found that sources of stress included factors such as 
cultural clashes, resettlement issues, economic concerns, 
lack of trust, separation from family, homesickness, lack 
of work, and worry about family in war zones [45].

However,  although  populations  of  Afghan  refugees 
have steadily increased in Western countries in the recent 
decades,  there  is  a  paucity  of  studies  on  EMs  among 
Afghans related to specific diagnoses such as PTSD and 
depression.  A  study  among  Afghan  refugees  in  Califor-
nia  found  that  respondents  perceived  that  depression, 
often  expressed  as  afsurdagi  (Dari  for  grief,  low  mood, 
and  sadness),  was  caused  by  a  variety  of  factors  includ-
ing traumatic experiences, cultural adjustment challenges 
and conflicts, interpersonal challenges, uncertainty about 
the  future,  loss  of  identity  and  having  chronic  diseases 
[29]. The  study  also  found  gender  divergences,  in  which 
women tended to associate depression with more somatic 
items  [29].  Furthermore,  a  study  in  Australia  suggested 
poor  understanding  of  mental  health  symptoms,  differ-
ences in health care information and treatment practices 
between  Afghans  and  the  mainstream  population  [47]. 
Another study in Australia on causes of, and risk factors 
for  PTSD  showed  that  experiencing  traumatic  events, 
coming from a war-torn country, as well as family prob-
lems were cited as causes among Afghan refugees [48]. In 
summary, these studies suggest that EMs among Afghan 
refugees are multiple, divergent, and influenced by trau-
matic  experiences,  migration,  and  acculturation  factors, 
rather than being a static, coherent set of cultural beliefs.
The  number  of  Afghan  refugees  in  Norway  has  tri-
pled  since  2006  [49].  Recent  research  shows  that  20.4% 
of  Afghan  refugees  in  the  country  reported  mental 
health  problems  in  the  form  of  depression  and  anxiety 
[39].  Moreover,  Afghan  refugees  are  among  the  minor-
ity  groups  reporting  most  problems  related  to  solitude 
in  Norway  [50].  Although  mental  health  services  have 
improved  in  this  millennium,  they  are  still  sparse  in 
Afghanistan [51–53]. However, many of Afghan refugees 
may  have  had  previous  experiences  with  mental  health 
services  in  for  example  refugee  camps,  influencing  their 
EMs  about  PTSD  and  depression.  Moreover,  all  newly 
arrived  refugees  in  Norway  also  enroll  in  an  obligatory 
full-time  introductory  program  for  up  to  2  years,  which 
often  includes  a  focus  on  health  and  mental  health,  as 
well as public health services in the country.

To this background, the current study aimed to inves-
tigate  EMs  of  depression  and  PTSD  among  Afghan 
refugees  in  Norway.  Considering  previous  research, 
which  suggest  that  EMs  are  fluid,  multiple,  and  subject 

to  change  according  to  social  context,  we  aimed  to  gain 
more knowledge about potential intra-cultural variations 
in the EMs (specifically related to gender and age), and to 
invite  our  participants  to  reflect  on  the  extent  to  which 
their EMs may have changed because of the migration to 
another country.

Methods and materials
Participants

The  study  included  six  gender-separated  focus  group 
interviews  (FGIs)  with  two  to  six  participants  and  one 
individual interview (since the remaining participants did 
not  show  up  for  that  FGI).  Participants  were  recruited 
from  the  2-year  compulsory  introductory  program  for 
refugees in three municipalities in Norway and adult edu-
cational  programs.  The  inclusion  criteria  were  that  they 
were refugees from Afghanistan, above the age of 18, and 
had  lived  more  than  6  months  in  Norway.  A  minimum 
of  6  months  residence  time  in  Norway  was  chosen  as  a 
cut-off because it takes up to 6 months for newly arrived 
refugees to formalize their settlement status and get full 
access to Norwegian education and health services. Staff 
in the programs facilitated the recruitment by identifying 
and  inviting  potential  participants,  providing  them  with 
information about the study. As part of the process, suit-
ability for participating in group interviews with a focus 
on  mental  health  was  considered,  based  on  the  possible 
risks  that  discussions  could  bring  about  significant  dis-
comfort and sensitive topic. There was no mental health 
assessment  of  participants  prior  to  participation  in  the 
FGIs.

A  total  of  27  Afghan  refugees  between  the  ages  of  18 
and  47  (15  females  and  12  males)  resettled  in  Norway 
participated  in  this  study.  Table  1  presents  information 
about the groups. Most of the participants had a spouse 
from  Afghanistan.  Except  for  two  participants  who  had 
Pashto as their main language, the native language of par-
ticipants was Dari. The duration of stay in Norway ranged

acteristics of the participants.

Procedure

The  focus  group  interviews  took  place  during  February, 
March,  and  August  of  2019.  The  FGIs  were  conducted 
using  a  vignette  displaying  a  fictional  person  suffering 
from symptoms of either PTSD or depression in line with 
ICD-10  (Classification  of  Mental  and  Behavioral  Disor-
ders)  and  DSM-5  (see  Additional  file  1:  Appendix)  [25, 
54]. The gender of the vignette character was matched to 
the participants (males or females) to facilitate identifica-
tion. The vignettes were adapted from previous research 
on  explanatory  models  among  refugees  [24,  47,  55,  56]. 
The  vignettes  were  translated  from  English  to  Dari  and 
Pashto  by  a  professional  translation  service  and  back-
translated  to  the  Norwegian  by  interpreters  participat-
ing  in  the  focus  group  interviews.  The  interviews  took 
place  within  the  facilities  belonging  to  the  municipality

program).  Licensed  interpreters  of  the  same  gender  as 
the participants attended the interviews. Questions were 
asked in Norwegian and translated to Dari or Pashto by 
the interpreters. Most participants had basic Norwegian 
language skills and could choose to answer in Norwegian 
or  in  their  native  language.  The  interpreters  translated 
the answers given in Dari or Pashto into Norwegian and 
helped clarify potential misunderstandings.

Before  the  interviews,  the  interpreters  explained  their 
role  and  assured  confidentiality.  The  interpreters  read 
aloud  the  consent  agreement  in  the  native  language  of 
the  participants,  making  sure  that  everyone  understood 
the content. Next, the interpreters read the vignettes out 
loud  in  the  native  language  of  the  participants  (Dari  or 
Pashto).  After  eliciting  the  groups’  initial  responses  and 
thoughts about the situation of the vignette character, the 
major  follow-up  questions  were:  What,  if  anything,  do 
you  think  is  wrong  with  Mossa/Zarina?  What  could  be 
the reason Mossa/Zarina is feeling the way he/she does? 
If  you  were  his/her  friend,  what  would  you  recommend 
him/her  to  do?  And  why?  Does  he/she  have  a  disease? 
Do you think Mossa/Zarina can get help from the public 
health sector? If yes, how? If not, why not? Do you think 
there  are  differences  in  how  people  in  Afghanistan  and 
Norway think about this situation?

Closed  questions  were  followed  up  with  more  open 
questions.  The  interviewers  urged  free  discussion,  still 
making  sure  that  all  groups  covered  the  main  topics, 
that  all  members  were  to  some  degree  active,  and  that 
the discussion was centered. The participants were never 
encouraged  to  reveal  personal  information  but  were 
asked  to  imagine  that  they  were  friends  of  the  vignette 
character.  The  interview  guide  was  based  on  previous 
research  [19,  57],  and  further  developed  in  cooperation 
with an Afghan research associate.

Three members of the research team (authors one, two, 
and  four)  were  present  during  the  interviews.  Authors 
two and four, both clinical psychologists, conducted the 
interviews. The interviews lasted 1.5–2 h and were video- 
and  audio-recorded.  No  compensation  was  given  to  the 
participants.  Coffee,  tea,  and  snacks  were  served  during 
the interviews.

Ethics

The  data  collection  was  approved  by  the  Norwe-
gian  Regional  Ethical  Committee  (Reference  number: 
2018/1794  and  2018/2115),  and  the  Norwegian  Center 
for Research Data (Reference number: 602214). All meth-
ods used were performed in accordance with the relevant 
guidelines and regulations. Before the interviews started, 
the participants were orally informed about the purpose 
of  the  study,  that  participation  was  voluntary,  how  data 
would  be  handled  in  all  phases  of  data  collection  and

publication, and that confidentiality would be protected. 
They were also informed that they could leave the inter-
view at any time without explaining the reason. All par-
ticipants  signed  a  consent  agreement  in  Dari  or  Pashto 
before  the  interviews  started  and  were  encouraged  not 
to  reveal  information  that  had  been  shared  with  other 
participants  during  the  interviews  to  other  people.  One 
participant was excluded from the interview due to being 
underage. One FGI became an individual interview as the 
other invited participants did not show up.

Data analysis

The interviews were transcribed verbatim in Norwegian, 
masking  the  identity  of  the  participants,  and  reviewed 
by  the  first  author  and  a  research  assistant.  All  tran-
scriptions  from  the  focus  group  interviews  were  coded 
and analyzed following the principles of thematic analy-
sis  [58].  All  authors  coded  data  separately  to  improve 
truthfulness,  searched  for  and  identified  themes  mark-
ing  up  suitable  categories  both  manually  and  with  the 
software  program  NVivo  [59].  The  analysis  focused  on 
causal  explanations,  ideas  about  coping,  and  treatment 
options  associated  with  PTSD  and  depression.  Codes 
were  identified,  developed  into  broader  categories,  and 
thematically clustered. Quotes were selected to describe 
the themes and each theme was explored and organized 
by gender. The quotes selected had been translated from 
Dari  and  Pashto  to  the  Norwegian  language  during  the 
interviews  and  transcription.  The  quotes  presented  in 
this  article  were  translated  into  the  English  language  by 
the  research  team.  Several  themes  emerged  from  each 
of  the  main  categories,  sometimes  unique  for  either  the 
PTSD or depression interviews.

Results
We  have  organized  the  findings  of  explanatory  models 
of PTSD and depression among Afghan refugees in Nor-
way  into  two  sections,  separated  by  gender:  (1)  Themes 
related to causes and risk factors; and (2) Themes related 
to managing symptoms. Where relevant, we will discuss 
differences related to vignette type (PTSD or depression).

Causes and risk factors
Females

Female  participants  used  the  terms  depression  (for  both 
the  depression  and  PTSD  vignettes),  stress  (depression 
vignette),  and  trauma  (PTSD  vignette)  in  both  Norwe-
gian  and  English  languages  to  describe  the  condition 
of  the  vignette  character.  Several  of  them  furthermore 
expressed  that  they  recognized  the  situation  of  the 
vignette  characters  from  their  personal  experience:  “I 

have the same problem as Zarina, I carry the same story. I 
experienced the same.”

The females emphasized that the described symptoms 
may derive from several causes depending on the person 
or social context. For instance, one of them said:

It varies from person to person. Some have problems. 
For instance, they have problems with their families, 
with  their  children,  they  are  sick  themselves.  When 
children  are  sick,  they  are  concerned  all  the  time 
about the one who is sick. When you are concerned 
all  the  time,  you  naturally  start  to  forget  yourself. 
You think it is a difficult everyday life. Perhaps they 
[…] experienced war, it varies from person to person. 
And  perhaps  some  might  have  problems  with  their 
husband, their home in their family.

The generally unstable and insecure situation in Afghani-
stan  was  also  considered  a  cause  of  distress  after  reset-
tling in Norway: “It says here [referring to the vignette], 
that  she  has  family  from  Afghanistan.  Maybe  she  lost 
somebody  in  her  family  in  Afghanistan.  It  is  not  safe 
there. There has been a war there, and it is terrible there. 
Maybe she thinks about it.”

Despite  this  emphasis  on  multiple  possible  causes 
depending  on  the  context,  a  repeated  theme  was  how 
the  vignette  character’s  symptoms  could  relate  to  gen-
der  issues.  Several  plausible  causes  discussed,  included 
forced  marriages,  often  at  a  young  age  (e.g.  “She  must 
have been forced to marry this man”); gender roles (e.g. 
“They  are  not  allowed  to  go  out  without  family  or  rela-
tives”); domestic violence (e.g. “Most of them in Afghani-
stan have experienced a situation in their lives …domestic 
violence… if they have faced that in their home country, 
obviously, they’re going to feel like Zarina”); harassment 
and  violence  against  women  (e.g.  “If  she  gets  pregnant 
out  of  wedlock,  she  will  be  rejected  by  her  family,  and 
she  will  be  killed.  She  will  be  seated  in  the  middle  of  a 
room in front of men, and they will throw stones at her”); 
and social control and generational conflicts (e.g., “All the 
time the parents must decide”). Participants also empha-
sized that these types of causal factors could depend on 
whether  the  woman  came  from  urban  or  rural  areas  in 
Afghanistan.

The practice of social control as a source of distress for 
women  could  also  continue  after  resettling  in  Norway: 
“Maybe  mom  and  dad  say  that  she  must  wear  hijab,  or 
she  disagrees  with  her  parents.  That  she  had  to  wear  a 
hijab, or she had a boyfriend and wanted to marry a man 
she  wanted.”  One  woman  commented  that  a  likely  rea-
son for the depression of the vignette character was that 
her parents had not given her sufficient insight into what 
is  culturally  appropriate  among  Afghans.  The  partici-
pants  noted  that  the  vignette  character  with  depression

lived  in  a  different  city  from  her  parents  and  that  her 
distress  could  be  related  to  guilt  (e.g.,  “She  has  a  guilty 
conscience.  She  can’t  help  her  parents”)  and  feeling  dis-
connected (e.g., “I think she has lost contact with her par-
ents”). Work overload could exacerbate feelings of social 
isolation. One commented: “She’s worked for 5 years and 
now she can’t take more work. She has lost sleep as well. 
She has no time for friends or her sister.”

Males

Similar  to  the  female  participants,  males  associated  the 
vignette character’s problems with their own and stressed 
that the problems may have several causes. However, dif-
ferent  themes  emerged  compared  with  the  women,  and 
there  were  also  differences  between  the  depression  and 
PTSD  vignettes.  While  the  females  emphasized  gender-
related  issues  regarding  both  vignettes,  the  males  in  the 
depression  FGIs  emphasized  acculturation  challenges, 
while  the  younger  men  in  the  PTSD  FGI,  emphasized 
experiences  before,  and  during  flight,  and  the  concerns 
associated with being an asylum-seeker.

Some  of  the  participants  in  the  depression  groups 
identified  the  vignette  character’s  condition  as  depres-
sion.  However,  they  had  several  notions  of  depression. 
Participants  noted  that  mental  health  problems  differ 
from  somatic  diseases  (e.g.,  “There  is  when  you  are  ill 
physically,  and  then  there  are  other  ways,  when  you  are 
depressed,  you  are  mentally  ill”),  and  that  conditions  of 
depression may differ in terms of severity: (e.g., “I thought 
he [Mossa, the vignette character], was a little depressed. 
Not so deep, in the first stage. In that condition, we can 
quickly help these people. If we don’t help them quickly 
it  can  get  worse.”  Importantly,  several  participants  also 
commented  that  depression  is  a  condition  not  observed 
in  Afghanistan,  since  people  there  often  have  what  they 
considered more serious mental health problems due to 
trauma and the hardships of living:

In Afghanistan, I would say we don’t have this issue. 
If  somebody  has  depression,  we  do  not  have  it  in 
Afghanistan.  I  am  not  very  conservative  or  cau-
tious,  but  why  don’t  we  have  it?  Because  many  are 
in  shock.  Many  cannot  carry  on.  We  have  many 
psychological problems, but they are not because of 
depression.

The  groups  recognized  that  depression  is  reflected  in 
cognitive patterns of self-blaming and faultily attributing 
negative  events  to  personal  inadequacies.  For  instance, 
one commented: “If I have a friend, and then today he is 
not friends with me, maybe it is because I was a bad per-
son before [referring to the way of thinking of depressed 
people].  I  believe  that  it  is  not  true  because  all  people 
have  problems,  but  some  can  distance  themselves.”  One 

group emphasized that a traditional view among Afghans 
is  that  problems  or  poor  health  are  somehow  deserved. 
One said: “We think if you are a bad person then every-
thing follows. If you have an allergy, that is because you’re 
a bad person, for example. It is the culture that we have. 
The old, especially older people think a lot like that.” Reli-
gious  beliefs  could  also  impose  feelings  of  guilt  contrib-
uting  to  depression  according  to  some  participants,  but 
none  of  the  participants  endorsed  spiritual  explanations 
to mental health problems [e.g., being a bad Muslim].

Consistent  with  the  view  that  depression  mostly 
emerges  after  resettling,  many  of  the  possible  causes 
discussed  were  challenges  associated  with  accultura-
tion. One participant mentioned: “It is not just him that 
is under pressure. It is all refugees who are in this coun-
try. They are under pressure because of the language, lack 
of work, communication problems, and so on.” Financial 
problems in exile were also highlighted as contributing to 
mental health problems. Loneliness and feelings of being 
disconnected were mentioned by several of the men rec-
ognizing  that  the  vignette  character  was  unmarried  and 
lived alone, e.g. “Most Afghans who have problems here, 
it is because they live alone” and “they cannot explain the 
problems  they  have.  They  just  have  it  inside  them  and 
that makes them depressed.”

It  was  emphasized  that  cultural  confusion  could 
amplify  mental  health  problems.  One  mentioned  that 
young  men  could  have  problems  related  to  how  they 
approach  Norwegian  women  because  they  carry  with 
them gender norms from the Afghan culture:

Because  of  low  education  or  not  having  an  educa-
tion in the home country, they have not read about 
this  country  or  laws.  So,  for  example,  if  he  sees  a 
girl  without  a  scarf  in  his  home  country,  he  thinks 
she is a whore or something. And then he thinks that 
those who are here are exposed in the same way. And 
when  afterwards  he  sees  that  no,  it  is  not  like  that 
here, and he will be depressed.

Intergenerational  and  family  conflicts  due  to  accultura-
tion challenges were also mentioned, e.g., “Because chil-
dren  who  are  born  in  this  country,  they  want  the  same 
culture as their [Norwegian] friends. And there may be a 
little crash and constantly there may be arguments with 
the  parents.”  Another  cause  associated  with  the  adap-
tation  to  a  new  country  included  the  harsh  climate  in 
Norway: “He should go on a journey because in the Nor-
wegian climate you can quickly become sad.”

The younger participants in the PTSD group identified 
the vignette as related to trauma (“It is mental problems, 
trauma”). The discussion centered on experiences before, 
and  during  the  flight  as  causal  factors;  and  stressors 
after  resettlement  as  exacerbating  or  maintaining  PTSD

symptoms. Comments about the vignette character often 
intermeshed  with  their  personal  accounts.  Memories 
about  violence,  war  and  fear  could  continue  to  haunt 
the  vignette  character  after  resettling  in  Norway.  One 
commented:

I don’t like to watch social media. Many things hap-
pen in our home country that we can watch imme-
diately on TV or social media. Bombing and people 
dying  happen  almost  every  day.  It  is  painful  to  see 
and listen to. Maybe it is my family who is dying. He 
[the  vignette  character]  has  experienced  it.  Some-
thing which has impacted him.

One  of  the  participants,  referring  to  his  own  experi-
ence  said:  “People  are  afraid  that  when  you’re  asleep, 
people  will  come  and  kill  you.”  The  group  discussed 
how encounters during flight could cause these kinds of 
symptoms from the vignette character. One commented 
that  the  vignette  character’s  symptoms  may  have  been 
caused  by  “What  he  has  experienced  there  [on  the  way 
from  Afghanistan  to  Norway].  This  may  continue  in  his 
thoughts  and  lead  to  the  problems  that  he  has  in  Nor-
way.”  Several  mentioned  feeling  vulnerable  and  unpro-
tected  during  flight,  e.g.,  that  the  symptoms  may  have 
been exacerbated by “injections and some drugs he may 
have  been  given  […]  perhaps  somebody  wanted  him  to 
develop mental problems.” After arriving in Norway, the 
possibility  of  having  asylum  applications  rejected  and 
being  returned  to  Afghanistan  was  also  mentioned  as  a 
stressor:  “Lately  there  have  been  many  rejections.  He 
might  be  forced  to  return.  Many  Afghans  are  returned. 
So, it could be because of many rejections, and [what is 
written]  in  the  media  about  it.”  Mental  health  problems 
were  also  considered  to  be  amplified  by  rumination 
related  to  the  atrocities  and  difficult  living  conditions 
faced  by  people  in  Afghanistan:  “He  can  for  instance 
think  about  poor  people,  think  about  people  there  and 
that there has been a war for so long.”

Managing symptoms of depression and PTSD
Females

The  females’  discussions  about  managing  symptoms  of 
PTSD  and  depression  were  relatively  similar.  As  with 
causes  and  risk  factors,  it  was  emphasized  that  ways  of 
managing  symptoms  depended  on  the  context,  with  a 
major  distinction  between  the  situations  of  women  in 
Norway  and  Afghanistan.  A  repeated  theme  was  that 
women in Afghanistan have no other choice than persist-
ing living under very difficult conditions, such as domes-
tic violence. One woman said: “She will just tolerate the 
burden by herself.” Help-seeking sources outside the fam-
ily were of little use:

I  heard  there  are  organizations,  but  they  are  not 
working.  They  agree  when  [family  members  from 
both] families are there, but when the wife is back 
to her husband’s house, she is facing the same prob-
lem. There is no way. So, she will be facing it until 
she is dead.

Also,  according  to  the  participants,  admitting  to  emo-
tional  problems  in  Afghanistan  would  run  a  risk  of 
being branded “crazy,” an attitude that would hold them 
back from seeking help.

Talking  to  a  trusted  person  emerged  as  the  primary 
advice  they  would  give  to  the  vignette  character  inde-
pendent  of  whether  she  had  symptoms  of  depression 
or  PTSD  and  whether  she  is  in  Norway  or  Afghani-
stan.  Clearing  her  mind  of  negative  thoughts  and  feel-
ings  was  an  essential  part  (e.g.,  “It  often  helps  to  tell 
others what someone has in their heart… it helps a lot, 
and one could feel relieved”). Talking to one’s husband, 
a  family  member,  or  friend  was  the  first  choice  (e.g., 
“If  she  has  a  family,  a  sister  or  a  brother,  or  the  oldest 
daughter, she could talk to close relatives”).

However,  situations  were  discussed  in  which  the 
woman  could  not  talk  to  other  Afghans  due  to  taboos 
about mental health problems, shame, or cultural prac-
tices,  e.g.,  an  unmarried  woman  having  slept  with  a 
man. In those instances, turning to a doctor, psycholo-
gist, or other health professionals were seen as particu-
larly  helpful,  since  they  have  a  duty  of  confidentiality 
and  are  not  permitted  to  disclose  information.  Also, 
otherwise, most of the women thought that a psychol-
ogist  could  help  Zarina,  e.g.  “I  think  she  needs  to  talk 
to a psychologist. Empty her heart. Everything she has 
inside must come out.” However, some women objected 
and  commented  that  psychologists  often  only  offer 
medication  in  form  of  treatment.  One  of  the  females 
had  personal  experience  from  seeing  a  psychologist  in 
Norway  after  losing  her  parents  and  concluded  that 
“Psychologists do not help. Only family and friends.”

Furthermore, emphasizing the role of family for posi-
tive mental health, getting married and starting a fam-
ily  was  seen  as  a  good  way  for  the  unmarried  vignette 
character to manage symptoms of depression (e.g., “She 
needs  to  find  a  good  man";  “She  needs  to  find  a  boy-
friend  so  there  is  a  change  in  her  life”).  Several  com-
mented  that  becoming  pregnant  and  having  another 
child  (for  married  women)  could  help  to  regain  hope 
for  the  future  and  keeping  the  mind  busy  and  away 
from  difficult  thoughts  and  emotions.  Other  ways 
of  managing  the  symptoms  were  also  considered  as 
potentially  useful  depending  on  the  assumed  cause  of 
the  condition  of  the  vignette  character.  When  being 
over-worked  was  suggested  as  a  possible  explanation, 

 Brea Larios et al. BMC Psychology            (2022) 10:5

finding time for herself (e.g., “She needs to think about 
herself.”),  going  on  holidays,  enjoying  more  time  and 
relaxation  with  friends,  and  keeping  herself  busy  were 
important measures.

While participants recognized that not everyone wants 
to  talk  about  their  problems,  sharing  thoughts  and  feel-
ings about past experiences was seen as vital to overcome 
symptoms of PTSD. One participant commented:

Males

Similar  to  the  female  participants,  the  males  presented 
with  the  depression  vignette,  highlighted  that  managing 
the  symptoms  depended  on  the  context.  When  discuss-
ing  the  possibility  that  the  causes  could  be  linked  with 
isolation  and  loneliness,  measures  such  as  reconnecting 
with family and socializing with friends were highlighted 
as essential. One male mentioned how visiting the home 
country had led to a profound transformation in a friend 
suffering  from  depression.  Also,  as  in  the  female  FGIs, 
males  discussed  getting  married  to  overcome  the  situ-
ation  (e.g.,  “If  he  is  in  need  to  get  married,  he  must  get 
married  or  find  someone  in  his  life.  Most  Afghans  have 
problems here because they live alone”).

Regardless  of  what  caused  the  symptoms,  talking  to 
family or a friend they trust, were seen as  the first step 
towards treatment and recovery. One of the most impor-
tant  forms  of  support  provided  by  a  friend  could  be  to 
guide the person to seek help from a GP, who could help 
him recognize he has a problem. One of the males talked 
about  having  been  prescribed  medication  for  a  similar 
condition  to  the  vignette  character.  Nonetheless,  bar-
riers  for  contacting  public  health  care  system  were  also 
discussed, including that a 15-min appointment would be 
too short for the GP to understand the problem; lack of 
trust  (e.g.,  that  childcare  services  would  take  away  their 
children);  and  that  most  psychologists  lack  an  adequate 
understanding of the background of Afghan refugees.

Some also discussed other ways of managing the symp-
toms  of  depression,  including  religion  (e.g.,  “Maybe 
religion  would  have  helped  him”),  setting  goals  (e.g., 
“He  should  have  a  goal  in  life  or  find  one”),  and  having 
a  job,  like  the  vignette  character.  Thus,  the  participants 
in  the  depression  FGIs  did  not  prescribe  a  single  set  of 
responses and help-seeking options but suggested multi-
ple  ways  that  the  vignette  character  could  deal  with  his 
problems.

The  young  men  in  the  PTSD  group  emphasized  that 
engaging  in  distracting  activities  such  as  sports,  hiking 
with  friends,  or  having  a  job  could  alleviate  feelings  of 
distress.  Avoiding  revoking  memories  or  being  exposed 
to  upsetting  information  by  e.g.,  limiting  use  of  social 
media  was  seen  as  essential  measures.  One  mentioned 
how it could be helpful to release difficult emotions; “He 
can go to another place where he can get that aggression 
out… Scream or something. Get everything out. It helps 
to relax.”

Talking  to  others  and  not  being  alone,  perhaps  not 
being  too  much  on  social  media,  seeing  a  psycholo-
gist  helps  when  you  need  it.  We  think  that’s  also 
very  important.  And  not  carrying  too  much  inside 
and using the opportunities to talk to someone and 
how you feel - and if you go to think about things for 
yourself, then you get a little bit, you don’t feel better 
right? You just feel worse. So, I think it is very impor-
tant to share what you must carry. And don’t hide it 
inside. Too often it doesn’t go away.

The young men in the PTSD FGI had arrived in Norway 
as unaccompanied minors who did not have family in the 
country.  Some  of  them  described  difficulties  in  devel-
oping  friendships  with  Norwegian  youth  at  their  age: 
“When  I  went  to  junior  high  school,  I  was  very  happy  to 
make Norwegian friends, but …. they did not talk much to 
me…, so eventually I lost interest.” The gap in experience 
was  also  seen  as  a  barrier  in  talking  to  Norwegians:  “It 
is  difficult  for  Norwegians  to  understand  such  problems. 
Because  they  do  not  have  them.  And  we  Afghans  under-
stand.”  Thus,  turning  to  friends,  family,  or  other  people 
from  Afghanistan  was  considered  most  helpful  as  they 
could most easily identify with and understand the situ-
ation. However, they also reflected on the fact that some-
times this help was not available to them, and that some 
of  them  had  sought  and  received  valuable  support  from 
adult  professionals  such  as  social  workers,  teachers,  or 
psychologists who had become part of their lives in Nor-
way in one way or another.

Discussion
Our  study  is  the  first  to  examine  explanatory  models  of 
depression  and  PTSD  among  Afghan  refugees  in  Nor-
way,  building  on  previous  studies,  which  suggest  that 
EMs are fluid, multiple and subject to change according 
to social context [19, 29, 60]. The findings supported our 
expectations that EMs are characterized by intra-cultural 
variations  based  on  factors  such  as  gender  and  age.  All 
participants stressed that there might be many potential 
causes,  risk  factors,  and  ways  of  managing  symptoms 
of  depression  and  PTSD  depending  on  the  context.  To 
the  extent  that  we  found  recurring  themes,  they  var-
ied  among  distinct  categories  of  participants,  e.g.,  with 
females  emphasizing  domestic  problems  and  gender 
issues  as  possible  causes,  in  contrast  with  males  who 
tended to emphasize acculturation challenges and loneli-
ness. The perceived association between depression and 

Brea Larios et al. BMC Psychology            (2022) 10:5

resettlement  was  salient  in  that  several  males  claimed 
that depression hardly exists in the Afghan context. The 
younger  males  focused  most  on  traumas  experienced 
before, and during flight in their causal interpretation.

Furthermore,  participants  maintained  that  there  are 
different options for managing symptoms in Afghanistan 
and Norway, e.g., with females discussing how the situa-
tion of the vignette character would have to be endured 
in Afghanistan, while in Norway, there were other ways of 
managing  the  symptoms.  Nonetheless,  although  women 
recognized that they have more freedom of choice in the 
Norwegian  context,  gender-based  social  control  per-
sisted even after resettlement in Norway that contributed 
to symptoms of depression.

The  findings  of  our  study  share  both  similarities  and 
differences with previous studies among Afghan refugees 
across the world (see [5, 43–46]. An inclination towards a 
preference for informal help sources seems to be a shared 
finding across studies, also those involving other minor-
ity  groups  [55,  61].  Likewise,  the  emphasis  on  the  value 
of  family  as  an  institution  converges  with  findings  from 
other  studies  [22,  29].  For  example,  participants  noted 
that  moving  away  from  parents  and  remaining  umar-
ried at the age of 27 (referring to the vignette character) 
could  amplify  mental  health  problems  due  to  guilt  and 
feeling disconnected. Findings such as poor understand-
ing  of  mental  health  symptoms  among  Afghan  refugees 
in Australia [47], or the tendency among Afghan refugee 
women  in  California  to  associate  depression  with  more 
somatic items [29], could not be replicated in our study. 
Rather, most interview groups quickly identified the con-
dition of the vignette character as depression, and it was 
commented  that  depressed  individuals  typically  view 
undesirable  occurrences  in  life  as  having  internal,  sta-
ble  causes.  This  is  in  line  with  contemporary  research 
on  cognitive  patterns  associated  with  vulnerability  to 
depression  [62].  Thus,  overall,  our  study  supports  the 
notion that it is misleading to think about EMs as a single 
set of coherent cultural explanations (that may be appli-
cable  for  refugee  groups  from  the  same  nation  across 
countries of settlement) [19].

One of the inherent problems  with EMs as  a  concept, 
is  that  there  is  a  risk  for  a  too  strong  focus  on  (often 
exotic)  cultural  practices  at  the  expense  of  understand-
ing  the  influence  of  social  context  [14].  The  perception 
that  illness  needs  to  be  understood  within  the  perspec-
tive of the forms of treatment available within a cultural 
system  initially  attracted  empirical  studies  in  cultural 
contexts  where  the  interplay  between  shamans,  oracles, 
orthodox  medicine,  divinations,  bonesetters,  herbal-
ists,  practitioners  of  western  medicine  and  others  came 
into focus [19]. However, more recent studies have found 
that  mental  health  disorders  are  more  often  attributed 

to  social  factors  such  as  material  living  conditions  and 
relationships  than  to  spiritual  or  supernatural  factors 
[63, 64]. Similarly, our study suggests that the social con-
text,  i.e.,  separation  from  family,  domestic  relationships, 
war,  flight,  and  resettlement  challenges,  seems  to  have 
contributed  strongly  to  shape  the  EMs  of  the  Afghan 
refugees  in  Norway.  For  instance,  in  line  with  previ-
ous  studies  among  unaccompanied  minors  in  Norway 
[65],  the  focus  group  consisting  of  young  men  arriving 
in  Norway  as  unaccompanied  minors  stressed  that  lack 
of Afghan friends and family, and difficulties in building 
friendships with Norwegian youths creates a situation in 
which talking to professional adults (e.g., social workers, 
psychologists and medical doctors) is the best alternative. 
Likewise,  for  the  females,  turning  to  health  care  profes-
sionals  was  seen  as  particularly  useful  when  experienc-
ing problems that could be difficult to discuss with family 
and social network due to taboos or cultural norms. The 
implication  is  that  the  EMs  of  these  refugees  seems  to 
reflect  a  realistic  assessment  of  treatment  options  avail-
able  to  them  in  the  current  social  setting  in  exile,  more 
than  a  cognitive  model  of  cultural  perceptions  brought 
with  them  from  the  country  of  origin  [55].  It  should  be 
recognized  that  some  of  the  coping  patterns  described 
by  the  young  men  in  the  PTSD  focus  group  are  general 
characteristic  for  people  exposed  to  trauma,  includ-
ing  avoidance  of  emotional  experiences  and  situations 
that  bring  about  reminders  of  trauma.  Thus,  withdraw-
ing  from  social  media  as  described  by  these  young  men 
should be seen as a normal response to highly distressing 
life experiences.

Overall, how the refugees interpret and prefer to man-
age  mental  health  problems  are  influenced  by  their 
encounters  with  Western  mental  health  systems  and 
services  throughout  the  migration  experience.  Several 
of them used the term depression to describe the condi-
tion of the vignette character although a simple transla-
tion  of  this  word  is  not  available  in  Dari  or  Pashto  (the 
native languages of the participants). Despite the dearth 
of  mental  health  services  in  Afghanistan  [53],  many  of 
the refugees had previous experiences with NGOs offer-
ing  mental  health  services  during,  and  after  flight. They 
had  learned  about  the  Norwegian  health  system  during 
the  compulsory  introduction  program  for  newly  arrived 
refugees and they had experiences from personal consul-
tations with the Norwegian health system, including psy-
chologists and GPs. Clearly, these experiences, along with 
acculturation  challenges  and  other  migration-related 
experiences had contributed to shaping their EMs. Again, 
this observation supports the need for more focus on the 
relationship  between  social  processes  and  cultural  prac-
tices and perceptions [9, 14].

However,  an  assessment  of  the  validity  of  our  find-
ings  is  warranted.  Although  participants,  to  a  varying 
degree, were conversant in Norwegian, much of the dis-
cussions  between  them  were  in  their  native  language 
(mostly Dari). In terms of cultural validation, the Afghan 
interpreters  and  a  research  assistant  from  Afghanistan 
gave  cultural  insight  during  the  process  including  com-
menting on the relevance and validity of the vignettes to 
Afghan  refugees  settled  in  Norway.  On  the  other  hand, 
possible bias associated with the use of interpreters needs 
recognition.  The  quality  of  the  translations  was  vital 
for  the  obtained  data,  and  any  inaccuracies  or  misap-
prehensions  may  possibly  have  resulted  in  errors  in  our 
interpretations  [66,  67].  We  acknowledge  that  the  inter-
actions  between  the  Afghan  refugees  and  professional 
psychologists  moderating  the  FGIs  may  have  involved 
transactions  between  EMs  in  its’  own  right,  in  that  the 
participants  deliberately  downplayed  more  “exotic”  cul-
tural  perceptions  in  favor  of  a  more  “western”  explana-
tory  framework.  This  kind  of  power  issue  comes  into 
play  in  research  interview  settings  in  general  [68].  Our 
participants  based  on  our  perception,  hardly  discussed 
any rich, “exotic” cultural palette of causes and treatment 
options.  They  also  seemed  reluctant  to  discuss  the  role 
of religion in much depth. With the current anti-Islamic 
rhetoric  in  the  public  discourse,  this  is  understandable. 
However, participating in a focus group interview about 
their  views  and  experiences  contributed  to  create  a  set-
ting  that  invited  reflections  and  reassessments  of  what 
causes  mental  health  problems  and  how  to  deal  with 
them.  Expressing  that  they  identified  with  the  vignette 
character,  further  supports  the  trustworthiness  of  the 
findings from the study.

This is further strengthened by the fact that the partici-
pants also discussed EMs in rural Afghanistan, contrast-
ing  them  with  their  own  perceptions  of  living  in  exile 
in  Norway.  This  kind  of  process  is  also  consistent  with 
contemporary  understandings  that  culture  involves  a 
dynamic  interplay  between  individual  agency  and  social 
processes,  renegotiations  of  cultural  understandings, 
and  interpretations  of  cultural  meanings  with  others 
[10]. Studies have found that with acculturation, the EMs 
of  ethnic  groups  evolve  and  move  towards  the  majority 
culture  [69],  which  corroborates  with  the  present  study. 
However,  more  research  is  warranted  on  the  influence 
of  migration  experiences  and  social  context  on  refugee 
EMs.

One possible bias of this study is that we did not have 
a  balanced  sample  of  participants  in  terms  of  age,  edu-
cation,  and  family  situation  in  groups  discussing  PTSD 
and  depression  vignettes.  The  participants  in  the  male 
focus group discussing the PTSD vignette were younger 
(between  the  ages  of  18–21)  high  school  students,  and 

had  arrived  in  Norway  as  unaccompanied  minors.  Also, 
they were single, while members of the other groups were 
married,  except  for  one  male.  Furthermore,  the  limited 
size of the sample warrants follow-up quantitative stud-
ies to identify more categorical patterns. Future research 
may consider eliminating some of the two vignette char-
acters’  background  differences  that  could  potentially 
influence interpretations beyond the mental health symp-
toms presented. Specifically, the PTSD vignette character 
had a flight background, was married, and had children, 
while  the  depression  vignette  character  was  single,  and 
no  information  about  immigrant  background  was  given 
(although  the  character  had  a  common  Afghan  name). 
Notably, the present study did not include a clinical sam-
ple based on diagnosed psychopathology. The high inci-
dence of depression and PTSD among refugees suggests 
that a large proportion will either experience these condi-
tions themselves or within their family. Past research [56] 
indicates that in communal societies, family members are 
influential  for  health  services  utilization  and  treatment 
preference.  Thus,  we  argue  that  the  views  of  lay  people 
might  be  informative  for  how  the  Afghan  refugees  deal 
with mental health problems.

This study has important clinical implications. With the 
inclusion  of  cultural  concepts  of  distress  in  DSM-5,  the 
importance  of  dealing  with  potential  divergences  in  the 
EMs of patients and professionals is recognized, and sev-
eral instruments for mapping EMs have been developed 
across the years (for an overview, see [70]). However, in 
clinical  practice  these  methods  are  seldom  applied  due 
to time constraints and unfamiliarity with social science 
methods  among  many  professionals  such  as  psychia-
trists [70, 71]. We advocate that the idea of systematically 
developing  an  explanatory  model  in  the  sense  of  con-
densing a single set of causal explanations and treatment 
preferences may not only be analytically challenging in a 
time-pressed clinical setting but also misleading [27]. The 
empirical  diversity  evident  in  our  study  and  others  may 
make it more appropriate to talk about maps rather than 
models [19].

The concept of models may be too static to convey the 
fluid  status  of  perceptions  among  patients.  There  are 
risks  that  tentative  and  uncertain  perceptions  explored 
by  individuals  may  become  reified  and  made  definitive 
in  the  shape  of  a  coherent  explanatory  model  [27].  Our 
study  demonstrates  that  there  is  not  a  single  accurate 
and  generalized  explanatory  model  representing  Afghan 
perceptions on causes and treatment, and that individual 
perceptions are likely to continue to change across time. 
A map in the shape of a snapshot in time of various ave-
nues of thought and less fixed possibilities may provide a 
more relevant framework for exploring options with the 
patient.

Kleinman [28] maintained that he aimed to establish a 
method to promote clinical self-reflexivity and improve 
clinical  communication  using  open-ended  questions 
and  negotiations  Our  participants’  perceptions  about 
depression  and  PTSD  as  related  to  trauma  and  chal-
lenging  life  circumstances  did  not  deviate  from  how 
natives  or  health  professionals  could  think  about  such 
diseases. They did not indicate that these mental health 
diseases  were  associated  with  stigma.  Yet,  the  partici-
pants  had  reservations  about  the  ability  of  profession-
als to understand the situations of Afghan refugees. By 
asking  empathic  questions  and  roughly  mapping  the 
patients’  perceptions,  professionals  may  have  a  better 
starting  point  for  building  trusting  relationships  with 
refugee  patients  and  invite  them  to  share  and  put  into 
practice their expertise in their own lives.
