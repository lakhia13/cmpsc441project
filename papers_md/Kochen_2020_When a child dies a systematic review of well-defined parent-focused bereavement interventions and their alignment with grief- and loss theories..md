Abstract

Background: The availability of interventions for bereaved parents have increased. However, most are practice
based. To enhance the implementation of bereavement care for parents, an overview of interventions which are
replicable and evidence-based are needed. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of well-defined
bereavement interventions, focused on the parents, and delivered by regular health care professionals. Also, we
explore the alignment between the interventions identified and the concepts contained in theories on grief in
order to determine their theoretical evidence base.

Method: A systematic review was conducted using the methods PALETTE and PRISMA. The search was conducted
in MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. We included articles containing well-defined, replicable, paediatric bereavement
interventions, focused on the parent, and performed by regular health care professionals. We excluded
interventions on pathological grief, or interventions performed by healthcare professionals specialised in
bereavement care. Quality appraisal was evaluated using the risk of bias, adapted risk of bias, or COREQ. In order to
facilitate the evaluation of any theoretical foundation, a synthesis of ten theories about grief and loss was
developed showing five key concepts: anticipatory grief, working models or plans, appraisal processes, coping, and
continuing bonds.

Results: Twenty-one articles were included, describing fifteen interventions. Five overarching components of
intervention were identified covering the content of all interventions. These were: the acknowledgement of
parenthood and the child’s life; establishing keepsakes; follow-up contact; education and information, and;
remembrance activities. The studies reported mainly on how to conduct, and experiences with, the interventions,
but not on their effectiveness. Since most interventions lacked empirical evidence, they were evaluated against the
key theoretical concepts which showed that all the components of intervention had a theoretical base.

Conclusions: In the absence of empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions, their
alignment with theoretical components shows support for most interventions on a conceptual level. Parents should
be presented with a range of interventions, covered by a variety of theoretical components, and aimed at
supporting different needs. Bereavement interventions should focus more on the continuous process of the
transition parents experience in readjusting to a new reality.
Trial registration: This systematic review was registered in Prospero (registration number: CRD42019119241).

Background
After the death of an infant, or child, parents are left
with an intense and overwhelming sense of grief [1–3].
Parents experience an accumulation of feelings of loss
from the child’s initial diagnosis, through the progressive
deterioration in the child’s condition, and eventually, to
the death of the child [4]. In addition to their own feel-
ings of grief, parents also experience the burden of grief
from the dying child and their siblings [3]. Grief is a nor-
mal reaction to the loss of a child. For most parents,
moderate support from regular health care professionals
(HCPs), and relatives,
is sufficient in helping to cope
with feelings of grief [5]. However, around 10 to 25% of
parents experience a serious disruption in emotional sta-
bility, which may result in poor psychosocial outcomes
and adverse mental and physical health effects [6, 7].

A growing body of literature demonstrates that HCPs
recognise parents’ need for support in handling feelings of
loss and grief [8–10]. This has resulted in an increasing
number of interventions in practice aimed at all bereaved
parents and provided by regular HCPs [10]. Although care
standards state that providing bereavement care to parents
is an important aspect of end-of-life care, such care is not
yet routinely implemented in most hospitals [7, 11]. This
might be due to the fact that HCPs often feel ill equipped
to provide bereavement care [12]. Another explanation
might be that bereavement interventions based in practice
do not contain clear guidelines or protocols, making them
difficult to standardise [13]. The assumption is that clear
protocols and guidelines make interventions replicable for
other HCPs. An overview of, clear, replicable interven-
tions, containing guidelines and instructions, could lead to
improved implementation and appropriate care delivery
to all bereaved parents. This is because the availability of
evidence-based practice guidelines could enable HCPs to
feel more equipped [12]. However, such an overview is
currently missing.

Another characteristic of this practice-based nature of
the interventions is that theoretical and empirical sup-
port are often unclear or not provided at all [10, 14, 15].
Theoretical understanding is an essential ingredient in
developing, evaluating, and implementing behavioural

interventions and best clinical practices [16]. A social
theory can be seen as a set of statements that explain as-
pects of social life, and which demonstrate how people
conduct and find meaning in daily life [17]. However,
the theoretical field of loss and grief is still evolving.
Nevertheless, several theories have been put forward to
provide a supporting structure to the theoretical under-
standing of the process of grief [18–30]. Understanding
how different elements of interventions might relate to,
or rely on, such theories, could improve our understand-
ing of the underlying mechanisms of these interventions
and provide an indication of their effectiveness.

This review will provide an overview of well-defined be-
reavement interventions performed by regular HCPs, and
aimed at supporting parents in coping with loss, during
both the end of their child’s life and after their child’s
death. Furthermore, we will provide an overview of their
effectiveness and whether the bereavement interventions
currently practiced are substantiated by theory about loss
and grief, and, as such, provide a theoretical basis for the
effective elements of bereavement interventions.

Methods
Design
The field of paediatric palliative care is relatively young
and so clear terminology is yet to be established. There-
fore, we used an iterative method for constructing a
search strategy: Palliative cAre Literature rEview iTera-
Tive mEthod (PALETTE) [31]. In addition, our method
complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [32]. This
systematic review was registered in Prospero (registra-
tion number: CRD42019119241).

Databases and searches
The first articles were identified through a preliminary
search in PubMed and via expert advice from senior re-
searchers in the field of paediatric palliative care and be-
reavement. From these articles, different synonyms were
gathered and terminology became clearer, a process
known as ‘pearl growing’. As a result, articles were identi-
fied which were referred to as golden bullets because they

Kochen et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2020) 19:28 

Page 3 of 22

met all inclusion criteria and thus should be included in
the review. These processes resulted in additional searches.
The process of pearl growing, identifying such new articles
and adjusting the search string conducted in collaboration
with an information specialist, was repeated until the
search was validated [31]. That is, when all golden bullets
were identified in the results of the search. Subsequently
the information specialist involved conducted the final
structured literature search in the following databases:
MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. See Additional file 1
for the full search strings.

Study selection
The studies that were published in peer reviewed English
language journals between January 1, 1998 and November
15, 2018, were included when they contained a well-defined
bereavement intervention, offered by regular HCPs, to par-
ents of deceased children or children with a life limiting
condition at the end-of-life phase. This period of time was
chosen because palliative care was formalised in a definition
by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998, provid-
ing a consensus around the term ‘palliative care’. Interven-
tions were defined as an intentional act performed for,
with, or on behalf of, a parent or parents. An intervention
must consist of well-defined, concrete proceedings. This
means it can be replicated by other HCPs and is supported
by instructions, a manual, training, a program or other sup-
porting documents. We defined regular HCPs as profes-
sionals working in neonatal, or paediatric, care, where in
their daily tasks, they are confronted with palliative care
and care for loss and bereavement, without having neces-
sarily received specialist training in these domains. Further-
more, interventions aimed at complex grief were excluded,
since most parents do not require specialised services and
such interventions are mostly performed by specialists on
bereavement care. Full inclusion, and exclusion, criteria are
listed in Table 1. When the full text was not available on-
line, or when it was unclear whether the practices described
were supported by a protocol or supporting documents, the
first author of the article was contacted by email and re-
quested to send additional information or a copy of the art-
icle. Both the title and abstract, and full text screenings,
were performed by two researchers independently (EK, FJ),
supported by the web-based screening program Rayyan
(https://rayyan.qcri.org/welcome). Disagreements were re-
solved in dialogue with the research team. All the articles
included were reference checked for additional relevant
studies.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Data on baseline characteristics, participants, interven-
tions, and outcomes were extracted by three researchers
(EK, KG, FJ) using a predesigned form based on Schulz’s
intervention taxonomy [34].

Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria:
(cid:129) Articles containing well-defined bereavement interventions offered
by regular HCPs to parents of children who have died or those chil-
dren in the phase of receiving palliative care.
(cid:129) Interventions aimed at consoling intense feelings of grief during the
end-of-life phase or after the loss of a child. Bereavement care may
also occur before the death of the child, for example from the mo-
ment the condition of the child is deteriorating and death is
imminent.
(cid:129) Studies must address interventions defined as: Intentional acts
performed for, with, or on behalf of, a parent or parents. An
intervention must consist of well-defined, concrete proceedings. This
means it can be replicated by other HCPs and is supported by in-
structions, a manual, training, a program or other supporting docu-
ments. Our definition is based upon the definition of interventions
used by the World Health Organization [33].
(cid:129) Studies must address regular HCPs defined as: All types of health care
professionals who primarily provide care and/or treatment and,
therefore, do not specialise in bereavement care.
(cid:129) Research in the field of paediatrics and neonatology.
(cid:129) Articles published in a peer reviewed journal.
(cid:129) Studies published in English.

Exclusion criteria:
(cid:129) Review articles.
(cid:129) Articles published before 1998.
(cid:129) Articles containing interventions that focus on complex grief and
complex bereavement care.
(cid:129) Articles which solely include prenatal death and stillbirth, defined as:
No signs of life at or after 28 weeks’ gestation. No occurrence of
circulation outside of the uterus.

The quality assessment was performed by two re-
searchers independently. The trials were assessed using
the Cochrane risk of bias tool (KG, AvdH) [35], observa-
tional studies with an adapted risk of bias tool based on
the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (KG, AvdH)
[36], and qualitative studies were assessed with the COn-
solidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research
(COREQ)
[37], recommended by Cochrane
Netherlands. The total scores ranged from 0 to 7 in the
trials and observational studies, and from 0 to 32 in the
qualitative studies. The quality appraisals did not affect
inclusion in the review due to the explorative nature of
this systematic review, and also due to the fact that arti-
cles containing low appraisal scores could still contain
valuable interventions and thus be relevant for the study
aim [38].

(FJ, EK)

Synthesis of grief theories
The interventions were compared with a theoretical syn-
thesis, in order to compensate for the expected lack of evi-
dence for most interventions, and to evaluate the possible
effectiveness. Since there is not a singular dominant theory
on grief [16], leading theoretical models have been identi-
fied using a pragmatic approach. At first, experts in the

loss, bereavement,

field of bereavement (PB, MK, EK) and palliative care
(MK) were consulted, preliminary searches were conducted
in Google scholar and Medline, and; a compendium on be-
reavement was consulted [39]. Secondly, a pragmatic
search was conducted in Medline using keywords such as
grief,
theory and equivalents (EK).
Thirdly, the theories identified were validated by experts
(PB, MK). They aimed for articles that showed the vari-
ation in bereavement theories and were a reflection of the
most accepted theories from several different domains
[18–30]. By doing so an overview of the leading theoretical
concepts available was developed, which were extracted
from the theoretical articles, clustered into communal the-
oretical concepts, and labelled accordingly. Most theories
on grief emphasise that bereaved families need to adjust
from the ‘old world’ to the ‘new reality’ [18–21, 23, 26–30],
where the deceased is no longer physically present. This re-
adjustment can be seen as a continuous process that takes
months to years to complete, while the grief, itself, may
never be resolved. The theories propose different ap-
proaches to how this adjustment is achieved. However,
when comparing the leading theories we found that most
theories have several key concepts at their core. This of-
fered the opportunity to synthesize the theories on a con-
ceptual level and, as such, capture the core mechanisms of
most theories. These core mechanisms create the ‘how’ in
which the theories explain the process of readjustment to
the new reality. The synthesis of theories resulted in five
concepts: anticipatory grief; an attachment to working
models and plans; appraisal processes; coping behaviours,
and; continuing bonds. These five concepts will be dis-
cussed in the following section. Importantly, these con-
cepts do not represent elements of a sequential process,
but rather elements of adjustment
that may be re-
addressed over time. The Additional file 2 displays how the
theoretical concepts are formed, based on different theoret-
ical articles.

Anticipatory grief refers to feelings of loss and grief
before an imminent loss [30]. It involves forms of cop-
ing and reorganisation prior to loss and death, man-
aging conflicting demands, facilitating a ‘good’ death,
and preparedness. Preparedness comprises several dif-
ferent dimensions such as medical, psychosocial, spirit-
ual, and practical dimensions [25]. Preparedness may
help informal caregivers in coping with grief at a later
stage.

Concepts concerning attachment working models and
plans enhance multiple types of plans, namely: internal
plans such as personal plans which may help a person
understand their environment [27, 28]; relational plans
such as how the self relates to others [26, 28, 30], and;
attachment plans such as those created in early child-
hood and which guide a person in forming attachment
bonds with others [19, 23]. Such plans make the world

understandable, recognisable, and predictable. However,
sometimes they do not match reality, for example when
a child dies. This causes a severe stress reaction. This
new reality must be incorporated into the existing plans
to establish a new stable situation [18, 20].

Appraisal systems are set up when a new situation
needs to be evaluated. In the situation of the loss of
a child, the appraisal systems conclude the fact that
the reality does not match the existing plans [19, 20,
23, 24, 26]. Appraisal systems will then be active until
new plans are developed [26], or the old plans are re-
vised [26, 30]. The loss is then incorporated into the
autobiographical memory and a revision of
self-
identity can take place [18, 27].

Stressful situations are managed by employing helpful
coping behaviours [18, 20]. Different coping styles exist,
such as those focusing on the problem or the emotion
[24]. Some coping styles may be orientated towards loss
or restoration [21, 30], while some strategies may seek to
make meaning out of the experience [28]. The reaction
and coping behaviours differ between individuals and de-
pend upon several factors including context and personal-
ity [26]. Effective coping includes the ability to shift,
flexibly, between different coping strategies [20, 21, 27].

Finally, the concept of continuing bonds refers to an
ongoing relationship between the individual and the de-
ceased [21, 22, 26].

Results
The search yielded 5144 unique articles, of which
nineteen met the inclusion criteria [40–58] and two
were added following an additional reference check
(Fig. 1) [59, 60]. Twelve articles represented empirical
data drawn from the interventions of bereavement
care programmes. Of these, four represented quantita-
tive studies [40–43], six represented qualitative studies
[44–49], and two represented studies which included
both quantitative and qualitative outcomes [50, 51].
Nine articles were descriptive in nature [52–60].
These articles contained well-defined bereavement in-
terventions, yet the interventions were not tested em-
pirically and, therefore, the outcomes could not be
provided. An overview of all the articles included is
provided in Table 2. Quality appraisals ranged be-
tween 2 and 5 for trials and observational studies,
and between 8 and 21 for qualitative studies. Quality
scores on all studies can be found in Table 2. Quali-
tative studies received higher appraisal scores.

The twenty-one articles included fifteen unique be-
reavement interventions,
identified with the letters of
the alphabet A through to O. Two interventions were
described in multiple articles (A and G). The interven-
tion characteristics are summarised in Table 3.

The characteristics of bereavement care interventions
The bereavement care programmes were predominantly
initiated by hospital staff (A-N). They took place in the
field of neonatology (n = 5) (F,H,I,M,O), paediatrics (n =
9) (B,C,D,E,G,J,K,L,N), or both neonatology and paediat-
rics (n = 1) (A). Some interventions were aimed at chil-
dren with a certain diagnosis: Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS) (n = 1) (O), and cancer (n = 4) (B,E,G,
care
N). Three
programme, while focussing on the impact on HCPs of
losing a patient (A,G,J).

studies presented a bereavement

With regard to the timing, we found that eleven inter-
ventions started after the child’s death (A,B,C,D,E,G,I,K,
L,M,O), one intervention started during the end-of-life
phase (J), and three interventions covered both before,
and after, death (F,H,N).

In most interventions, the person intervening was ei-
ther a nurse, appointed as the primary carer and operat-
ing individually or as part of a team (A,C,E,H,I,K,M), or
a physician (A,C,D,G,I). Other people intervening in-
cluded clinical social workers (B,H,K), chaplains (A,L) or
peer supporters - parents who have previously lost a
child too - (A), photographers (J), trained counsellors
(D), public health nurses (O), team members who had
the most contact with parents or experienced the light-
est workload (F) or, bereavement care team members
not otherwise specified (N).

We identified five overarching components of
in-
terventions which encompass the variety of practices
the
described in the interventions. These are:

(i)

acknowledgement of parenthood and the child’s life;
(ii) establishing keepsakes; (iii) follow-up contact; (iv)
education and information, and;
remembrance
activities.

(v)

(i) The acknowledgement of parenthood and the
child’s life consisted of washing, holding, or
dressing the child (H,I), giving parents privacy in
the moments surrounding the death of the child,
for instance in a family room (H), providing the
child with a certificate of life (I), or a blessing
ceremony (F,H).

(ii) Establishing keepsakes consisted of safeguarding a
lock of hair (H,I), hand, foot, or face print (H,I),
pictures (F,H,I,J), or items that belonged to the
child, such as toys, a blanket (H), ornaments (H), a
memory stone (I), clothes (I), a baby ring or
bracelet (H,I), memory books (F), poems (A,H), or
other belongings (F,H). The created items were
often provided to the parents in the form of a
comfort basket or memory box (B,H). Keepsakes,
especially for siblings, could also be provided (I).

(iii)Follow-up contact consisted of follow-up calls
(A,B,E,F,G,H,I,K,O), cards (B,E,G,H,I,N), visits
(A,F,L,O), flowers (F), condolence letters (K), and
appointments (A,C,D,G,M). Follow-up contact also
included facilitating contact with peers (A,K,N).
(iv) Education and information on coping, grief, and

practical information concerning the death of the
child, consists of folders and booklets with

information (A,B,E,F,G,H,I,K,L,N), financial advice
(F), videos containing information (L), educational
support meetings for peers and relatives (L),
seminars or workshops on coping and grief (K), and
information sessions (A,C,D,G,M) during which
HCPs provided information about the treatment
and autopsy (I), or answered questions (I).
(v) Remembrance activities included ceremonies or

services (F,H,K,N), and HCPs attending the funeral
(E,L).

The empirical basis of the interventions and the
outcomes of the studies
Most interventions identified consisted of a descrip-
tion of practices, sometimes based on years of experi-
ence, but did not include an empirical or theoretical
basis. Several studies did provide substantiation for
their interventions such as a previous, non-specified,
literature search (A,E),
interviews and focus groups
(B,E,G), or expert knowledge and special education
(A,B,D,F,J,O). Only two interventions were developed
using a clear theoretical basis. One intervention was
based on principles of stress and social support the-
ory (B), and the other contained a psycho-educational
bereavement guide based on the principles of cogni-
tive behavioural theory (K).

The studies that evaluated an intervention, showed that
parents reported a positive experience with bereavement
photography and follow-up contact (A,B,C,E,G,J,L). Par-
ents were grateful to receive photos of their child, and
helped HCPs feel better about their role (J). The outcomes
of most of the empirical studies focused on how the par-
ents had experienced the follow-up contact with the HCPs
who had taken care of their child. Follow-up contact was
generally valued. It helped parents cope with their grief,
provided closure, and gave parents a secure feeling of the
ongoing bond with the hospital and their child (A,B,C,E,G,
L). Parents found follow-up meetings with HCPs and/or
peers helpful in learning to tolerate and understand grief
it stimulated further thinking and
better. Moreover,

discussion between the parents about the topics addressed
in the meeting and helped parents to express their ideas
and feelings concerning grief to each other and to their
family and friends (L,M).

The alignment between intervention components and
theoretical key concepts
Given the lack of knowledge concerning the effective-
ness of the interventions, the potential worth of the
components of intervention is evaluated by aligning the
five intervention components identified (i-v) to the key
theoretical concepts as described in the Methods section.
These are: anticipatory grief; attachment
to working
models and plans; appraisal processes; coping, and; con-
tinuing bonds. Hereafter, all the components will be dis-
cussed and hypothesised, considering how they align
with the theoretical concepts identified (Table 4).

The acknowledgement of parenthood and the child’s life
This component includes facilitating parents to fulfil their
role as a parent, and to acknowledge the identity of their
child. Facilitating parents in their parental role is a compo-
nent HCPs provide before and after death. The main strat-
egy in these interventions is to enable parents to nurture
their child and to acknowledge their child’s uniqueness
[54]. Parents are facilitated to experience the bond with
the child, create memories, have a blessing ceremony, and
say their farewells [59, 60]. It allows parents to begin to
contemplate the idea that their child is dying, while ensur-
ing that their child is as comfortable as possible [60].
These practices support anticipatory grief, since they fos-
ter emotional preparedness, allow parents to adjust slowly
to the fact that their child is dying, and help to create last-
ing memories for parents to cherish after death [54]. A
certificate of life empowers parents to recognise the iden-
tity of their child. In letting parents participate in the last
care for their child, this also enables them to adjust, grad-
ually, to the fact that their child is dying, and makes the
transition between the internal plans less abrupt.

Establishing keepsakes
HCPs take the initiative in creating keepsakes together
with, or in accordance with, the parents. These keepsakes
provide the parents with a tangible memory of the child.
Especially in neonatology, where parents will not have been
outside the hospital with their child, keepsakes provide par-
ents with a way to cherish a part of their child, when the
child is no longer present. Establishing keepsakes can help
parents feel attached and close to their child and to provide
comfort [54]. Over time, the keepsakes can help the parents
in remembering the child, and help parents with process-
ing, conceptually, the loss, while they revise the autobio-
graphical memories and the memories of the child in order
to adjust to the new reality. Over time, when the parents
have adjusted to the new reality, the tangible memories of
the child serve as a form for expressing the continuation of
the bond between the parents and their child.

Follow-up contact
Follow-up contact with the hospital may take various
forms. Parents value ongoing contact with the hospital
staff, since the hospital staff know the child and many
parents developed a bond with them over time [45–47].
When parents feel that the HCPs remember their child,
this is felt as an acknowledgement of the child’s identity,
and a validation that their child has made an impact and
mattered [45, 46]. This acknowledgement results in posi-
tive reappraisal processes and adds positive meaning to
the past events. These positive reappraisals could also
foster adaptive coping behaviours, for example the shar-
ing of the story of the loss with friends and family. The
continuous reappraisal and coping behaviours in turn re-
sult in altering the working models and plans because
the loss is processed conceptually. This helps parents to
find a place for, and to define a new bond with, the de-
ceased child in the new reality [47]. Follow-up contact
with HCPs and peer supporters, simply their presence
and conversations, help parents to cope with loss [40,
43]. During follow-up contacts, HCPs can offer parents
an explanation of the course of treatment and the ra-
tionale for certain decisions that were made. This is im-
portant as parents often describe being in a haze during
the end-of-life period of their child [44, 46]. Further-
more, autopsy results are often shared in order to clarify
the physical illness [53, 54]. HCPs also have the oppor-
tunity to reassure parents that there is nothing that they
could have done differently [58]. This helps parents to
make sense of the preceding events and to clarify the
memories surrounding the death of their child [46, 53].
This clarification, in turn, aids reappraisal of the situ-
ation and past events, and provides parents with a form
of closure. It also allows parents to readjust their mem-
ories of the situation, address doubts about themselves,
and treasure memories of their child, which results in

readjustment to new memories and thus creates new
plans about themselves, their child, and the past events.

Education and information
Information folders, booklets, workshops, and seminars
can help parents in regaining some control over the many
different challenges they face in a new, unknown, and in-
secure, situation. It makes parents feel more prepared in
practical terms such as with financial aid, funeral arrange-
ments, and in finding extra emotional assistance when
needed [59]. An example of practical assistance might be
how to provide explanations to, and support for, the sib-
lings, reassuring parents that what they are feeling is nor-
mal, actions which can be termed preparation and which
offer a sense of validation [55, 59]. But practical assistance
could also include providing information about when and
who to turn to for extra support [55]. These forms of as-
sistance support parents in coping with the new situation
because it makes the new demands slightly more manage-
able. The information provided, and the validation of the
emotions they experience, also assist parents in creating
new knowledge structures and plans with regard to their
grief and the future they face. It helps the appraisal pro-
cesses and offers new working models.

Remembrance activities
The remembrance activities provide an opportunity to
feel close to the child again and to recollect memories
about their life [60]. It is also a means of feeling sup-
ported by friends, family, hospital staff, and the commu-
nity, that may help parents to cope with the loss [51].
These remembrance occasions provide a secure environ-
ment where parents feel connected to the child and feel
the bond that they had, and that still exists. Remem-
brance activities help parents in finding a way to con-
tinue their bond with the child in the new reality.
Religious or spiritual aspects of the events can also help
parents to make sense of, and find meaning in, the
child’s death. Such “meaning making” after the death is
a helpful coping mechanism for parents, in which they
can revise their memories and plans surrounding the
death of their child in a positive and helpful manner.

Discussion
This review identified fifteen well-defined bereavement in-
terventions provided by regular HCPs to support parents
of seriously ill children both at the end of their child’s life
and after death. All interventions were clustered into five
overarching components of the intervention. These are:
the acknowledgement of parenthood and the child’s life;
establishing keepsakes; follow-up contact; education and
information, and; remembrance activities. The majority of
interventions started after the death of the child, and were
performed by a nurse, assigned as the primary carer, or a

Kochen et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2020) 19:28 

Page 19 of 22

physician. Most of the empirical studies included in this
review evaluated how to conduct the intervention and ex-
periences with the interventions, but not their effective-
the
ness. To compensate for this lack of evidence,
components of intervention were assessed against a theor-
etical synthesis on loss and grief, which revealed that all
the components from which the interventions were built
were covered by theories on a conceptual level. The theor-
etical synthesis did uncover that bereavement is charac-
terised by the continuous process of adjusting to a new
reality [18–21, 23, 26–30]. Five key theoretical concepts
clarify this process: anticipatory grief; attachment working
models and plans; the appraisal processes; coping behav-
iours, and; continuing bonds. The theoretical synthesis
shows the need for bereavement interventions to focus on
the continuous nature of grief, and thus, starting before
the death and guiding parents through the grieving
process. Most interventions we identified relied on a com-
bination of multiple components or time points. However,
few interventions reviewed here showed such a continu-
ous process in supporting the parents.

In our comparison of the components of intervention,
and the theoretical synthesis, we found HCPs pursued sev-
eral underlying aims for providing bereavement care to
parents. The interventions were offered by HCPs to en-
hance the parents’ feeling of preparedness towards the
death of their child. These comprise providing parents
with information, nurturing the child, and experiencing
support from HCPs or their peer supporters. Those de-
signed to enhance their ability to create memories of, and
with, their child include nurturing the child, treasuring
keepsakes, and recollecting memories at the subsequent
remembrance ceremony. Finally, the interventions to pro-
vide parents with comfort and reassurance involve making
memories and keepsakes, answering questions and provid-
ing comfort in follow-up, providing information in gen-
eral, and remembering and acknowledging the child.
These elements are not captured in a single moment, but
require support at different moments and in a continuous
nature [61]. A difference we noticed is that the importance
of supporting parents in their parental role, and acknow-
ledging the identity of the child, may have a different
meaning in neonatology compared to paediatrics [54, 62].
The time in the hospital is often the only time these par-
ents can make memories with their child and to nurture
them. The HCPs are often the only people, apart from the
family, to have seen the child alive.

Bereavement theories emphasise that dealing with loss
takes form in a transition towards a new reality [18–21, 23,
26–30]. However, only four interventions included in this
review commenced before the death of the child [50, 57, 59,
60]. Yet, conversations between HCPs and parents about
the condition of their child, and their preparedness for the
their child, can contribute positively to the
death of

bereavement process after their child has died [25, 63]. The
possible explanations for this are, firstly, that there is a deli-
cate balance between preserving hope and letting go of the
child during the end-of-life phase. Most, but not all, parents
are able to make this transition [4, 64]. Most parents are in-
tellectually aware that their child’s death is imminent, how-
ever, emotional awareness usually follows at a later stage, or
not until after the death [65]. For the HCPs these phenom-
ena, and the parental diversity, make it difficult to assess
when parents are receptive to bereavement support during
the end-of-life phase. Furthermore, this diversity tends to
provoke insecurity among HCPs. However, HCPs should
be able to influence parents’ awareness and openness to-
wards bereavement support, for example by informing par-
ents about
the finality of curative options by sharing
information honestly and considering whether to stop on-
going curative treatment [65]. Secondly, given the diversity
both in parental responses to letting go of their child, and
in their emotional awareness, it is difficult to create a stan-
dardised intervention, including a protocol, for bereavement
care for parents during the end-of-life phase. Since our in-
clusion criteria consisted of interventions that needed to be
replicable, and supported by a protocol or documents, these
kind of interventions could have been excluded. This could
mean that there is, in fact, attention for feelings of loss and
grief, prior to the death of the child, by HCPs in their
current daily practice. However, these practices are not
standardised and thus were not covered in this review.

The comparison of key theoretical concepts and compo-
nents of intervention showed that interventions all ac-
count for small fragmented pieces in the grieving process.
But, also, that there are no interventions that emphasise
the continuous parental adjustment process as a whole.
The regular HCPs who had been involved in the child’s
care since diagnosis could be a significant factor in this
continuous care. Studies have shown that parents require
at least one meaningful follow-up contact with the HCPs
who cared for their child [14, 66]. We propose that be-
reavement care,
including follow-up conversations, are
important parts of the regular HCPs’ activities. There are
three main reasons for the integration of follow-up care
into the HCPs activities. Firstly, parents often have out-
standing questions about their child’s care, illness, and
their role in the period of the illness [67]. The regular
HCPs are able to answer these questions since they have
been part of the care prior to death. Secondly, the trust-
worthiness and bonds that already exist between the HCPs
and parents are very important [54]. Thirdly, parents seek
proximity to their child - an acknowledgement of his or
her life, and the impact the life has made; it helps parents
in the grieving process when the HCPs speak of their
memories of the child, reflect on his or her unique iden-
tity, and are effected by the child’s death [14, 45]. Another
important element of the conversations between the HCPs

Kochen et al. BMC Palliative Care           (2020) 19:28 

Page 20 of 22

and parents could be psycho-education [68, 69]. Psycho-
education encompasses information about what parents
are experiencing while preparing them for what they could
encounter during their journey through the grieving
process. It has been shown to have positive effects on the
self-efficacy of
informal caregivers. Psycho-education
could strengthen parents in their transition to a new real-
ity where the child is no longer physically present, if they
understand which challenges they are going to face, and
prepare them with helpful coping strategies [68]. Psycho-
education might too have a positive effect on mental ap-
praisals when a setback in the grieving process occurs and
in validating the feelings parents experience as normal
[70].

Once a child dies, their parents are left with an over-
whelming sense of grief. They describe the time passing as
a blur [44, 54]. Parents are not aware, during that period,
of all the interventions and assistance HCPs could offer
them. However, options could be presented to parents,
and the most appropriate could be chosen. Therefore, it is
important that HCPs offer parents a broad range of inter-
ventions [71]. This is also important because the key the-
oretical concepts are not sequential. Instead they form a
continuum and the most dominant of these key concepts
alter according to the demands at a given time [18, 20, 21,
27]. Also, effective coping is defined by a process of alter-
nating between two or more different coping strategies,
depending on the demands at a specific time [72]. If HCPs
could determine, in what stage parents were at a given
time, or with which processes they experience difficulties,
the appropriate components of intervention to aid that
process could be selected.

Strengths and limitations
The search was constructed using a recently developed
method, PALETTE, in addition to PRISMA. This was
helpful in identifying all the relevant articles in relatively
young domains where terminology is still diffuse. To our
knowledge, given the difficulty of measuring outcomes
in the field of paediatric palliative care, this is the first
systematic review to give insight into the theoretical ef-
fectiveness of bereavement interventions. In particular,
the inclusion of replicable interventions provides HCPs
with opportunities to implement them in their practice.
A limitation of this systematic review concerns the in-
clusion and exclusion criteria. These eliminated less de-
veloped practices and potentially helpful professional
attitudes and behaviours out of sight. It is possible that
these contain strategies that can be considered support-
ive in parental grief. Also, we included replicable inter-
ventions which could be implemented in practice since
these interventions are supported by a protocol or clear
guidelines. However, most interventions are not tested
and offer little evidence in their support. This is required

before implementing an intervention. Testing these in-
terventions might then be difficult due to the setting of
paediatric palliative care. Therefore, the theoretical syn-
thesis and alignment could only provide a form of theor-
etical support for the interventions we reviewed.

Conclusion
This review provides an overview of well-defined, replic-
able, bereavement interventions. The theoretical synthesis
in this review provides a basis for the effectiveness of the
components of intervention. All five of these cover mul-
tiple key concepts derived from theory. HCPs can choose
multiple interventions for different components to provide
parents with a continuous form of bereavement care, aid-
ing the transition that parents have to go through follow-
ing their loss. Future research is needed on how this
continuous support can be established, which time points
are crucial for providing bereavement care, and how new
interventions can be developed that align with this transi-
tion, and thus, ultimately, help parents in adjusting to
their new reality.
