Abstract: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a 6-week workplace
mindfulness- and self-compassion-based intervention (MSCBI) on perceived stress, burnout, immune
functioning (assessed with the biomarker Immunoglobulin A), self-compassion, and experiential
avoidance compared to a Workplace Stress Management Intervention. Both interventions were con-
textual, i.e., they were carried out in the workplace setting and during working hours. We followed a
randomised controlled trial study design. The total sample was composed of 24 employees of an auto-
motive company. One-way analyses of covariance between groups revealed signiﬁcant differences in
post-intervention levels of perceived stress, salivary Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), emotional exhaustion,
self-compassion, and experiential avoidance, after adjusting for pre-test scores. The results of this
study have several implications. Firstly, it conﬁrms that MSCBIs might be more effective than regular
psychoeducational interventions for work-related stress and burnout treatment. Secondly, sIgA can
be used to assess immune function state changes when MSCBIs are carried out. Furthermore, these
results indicate that it is feasible to carry out MSCBIs within companies and during working hours,
and that these interventions can help effectively manage stress and burnout associated with the
work environment.

1. Introduction

In recent years, workers’ vulnerability to stress has increased due to psychosocial risk
factors such as bigger workloads, time pressure, and unstable working conditions [1]. For
these reasons, chronic work-related stress has increased in prevalence too and, nowadays,
it is a public health problem in many industrialised countries [2]. European Union sources
concluded that approximately 30% of European workers may experience high stress levels
in their jobs, indicating strong growth in this type of occupational risk [3]. Furthermore,
stressed and chronically ill employees are expensive, both in terms of increased health care
costs and decreased productivity [4].

Chronic exposure to employment-related stressors can lead to what has been dubbed
‘burnout syndrome’. Three canonical symptoms of burnout syndrome include exhaustion,
cynicism, and occupational inefﬁcacy [5]. ‘Exhaustion’ is deﬁned as a subjective feeling
of ceasing to be able to meet any or all emotional demands at work. ‘Cynicism’ is the
imposition of affective distance towards one’s employment, colleagues, and/or consumers.

Finally, ‘inefﬁcacy’ is the perception of one’s own occupational incompetence. From this
perspective, burnout syndrome may be seen as a progressively developed process resulting
from the use of the relatively ineffective coping strategies with which professionals try to
protect themselves from work-related stress [6]. In this process, exhaustion is a symptom
that would contribute to the appearance of the cold and inhumane treatment given to
customers [7].

Studies about workplace interventions to prevent or treat stress and burnout have
grown exponentially during the last decade [8]. Among them, mindfulness-based inter-
ventions (MBIs) seem a promising approach to psychological impairment in this ﬁeld [8,9].
Bishop et al. [10] described mindfulness as consciously bringing one’s attention to ex-
periences that occur in the present moment, while maintaining an attitude of openness,
acceptance, and curiosity. It is essentially a cognitive skill, and it has been found to be
improved through training. In this regard, MBIs typically comprise a mixture of mind-
fulness practices, such as secular meditation, psychoeducation, and group interaction to
teach participants to become more aware of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, while
approaching these internal states with a non-judgmental curiosity [11].

At the moment, research about MBIs at the workplace has shown promising evidence
about the relationship between mindfulness-based training and improvements in perceived
stress, work-related stress, and burnout [11–14]. However, this research ﬁeld remains in
an early phase of exploration and is in need of [9,15]: (a) rigorous experimental random-
ized controlled trials (RCT), (b) contrasting mindfulness interventions with competing
approaches, and c) a measurement approach not only based on subjective and self-reported
methods. For these purposes, feasibility and pilot studies are needed in order to plan
full-size RCTs.

Finally, MBIs have evolved to incorporate modules of compassion, a construct that
has gained great interest in the Western part of the world in recent decades [16]. In Western
psychology, compassion is a complex construct that involves cognitive, affective, and
behavioural characteristics motivating one to alleviate the suffering of another being [17].
Concretely, self-compassion seems to be a protective factor for workers at risk of developing
work-related stress, though more research is needed to establish to what extent this feature
recently included in MBIs produces beneﬁcial effects [18,19].

Overall, high methodological studies are needed to research the effects of MBIs on
work-related stress, to the extent possible, including objective measures, which are infre-
quently assessed in studies about mindfulness training at work [20]. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a contextual intervention, a Mindfulness-
and Self-Compassion-Based Intervention (MSCBI), compared to a Workplace Stress Man-
agement Intervention (WSMI) carried out on a sample of employees from an automotive
company. The main outcomes were perceived stress, burnout, immune functioning, self-
compassion, and experiential avoidance. Two groups were compared, which were the
MSCBI group (employees who received the MSCBI, i.e., the experimental group) and
the WSMI group (employees who received the WSMI, i.e., the control group). The hy-
pothesis stated that employees who were randomly allocated to the MSCBI group would
report greater improvements in stress, burnout, immune functioning, self-compassion, and
experiential avoidance compared to those randomly allocated to the WSMI group.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

The ﬁnal sample was composed of 24 employees (41.7% women) of the company
Yanfeng Global Automotive Interiors (Almussafes, Valencia, Spain). The age range was
from 25 to 54 years old (M = 40.54; SD = 9.38). Based on self-reports, 25% of the sample
were single, 54.2% were married, and 20.8% were divorced. Regarding occupation, 62.5% of
the sample were entry-level employees, 29.2% intermediate employees, and 8.4% managers.

The inclusion criteria were: age higher than 18 years old, ﬂuency in Spanish, and
availability to attend all sessions of the intervention. Exclusion criteria included already
participating in other MBI or work stress management programme.

2.2. Procedure

All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Ethics Commission for
Experimental Research of the University of Valencia (H1499537283854). Once consent was
obtained from the company managers, the staff members of the company were given the
opportunity to enrol in the intervention programme through internal communication media.
Participation in the programme and research was voluntary. We followed a randomised
controlled study design. Those employees interested in participating were invited to an
informational meeting (n = 45), where the intervention programme was described. Then,
40 employees accepted the invitation and came to the meeting. After being informed about
the study, they were asked for their signed informed consent. After that, participating
employees completed baseline assessments and then were randomly assigned to the MSCBI
or WSMI groups via a randomization software (Random Allocation Software 2.0; [21]).

Those allocated to the MSCBI were divided into two groups to avoid having an
excessively large intervention group. Both interventions were contextual, i.e., the MSCBI
and WSMI were carried out in the workplace setting and during working hours. The
assessment stages consisted of the baseline, pre/post ﬁrst and last sessions (saliva samples),
and post-programme assessments. Saliva samples were taken in the ﬁrst and last sessions.
For this purpose, participants were instructed to abstain from eating or drinking (except
for water), as well as consuming caffeine, alcohol or any other drugs for 60 min prior to
these sessions. Post-programme assessments were carried out a week after the last session.
The participant ﬂow chart is shown in Figure 1 below.

2.3. Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Programme

The MSCBI was a 6-week, 6-session programme led by an experienced mindfulness
teacher and clinical psychologist who had previously conducted similar MBIs in workplace
settings. It was carried out over a total of 12 contact hours during work time. A list of
the contents and meditation practices for each session of the intervention is presented in
Table 2. The MSCBI uses a variety of meditation practices and psychoeducation to foster
mindfulness and self-compassion as resources that participants can then use to cope with
work-related stress. It was developed speciﬁcally for the workers of the company in which
this intervention was carried out.

The MSCBI is primarily experiential in nature. Throughout the programme, the
instructor explained the theoretical framework of mindfulness and self-compassion and
carried out exercises (including mindful breathing, a body scan, etc.). The sessions began
with guided meditation, which was used as an aid to help the instructor explain the concept
of mindfulness. All meditation practices performed in the sessions were followed by a
discussion. Theoretical explanations and analyses of the difﬁculties that participants had
each week were also part of all sessions. In the ﬁnal session, the mindfulness teacher
reviewed all of the modules covered and taught participants how to practice these skills
outside the group setting.

2.4. Workplace Stress Management Intervention

The active control group participated in a 6-week, 3-session programme led by the
same instructor that taught the experimental group. The WSMI was primarily theoretical
in nature. The teacher explained aspects of psychoeducation regarding work-related
stress and coping strategies. Participants were allowed to voluntarily share their personal
experiences and received some feedback from the instructor and the rest of the group.
These participants were on a waiting list and ﬁnally received the MSCBI.

2.5. Measures
2.5.1. Sociodemographic Information

Participants provided information on their age, gender (female, male), marital status
(single, married, divorced, widowed), and work status (entry-level employees, intermediate
employees, managers).

2.5.2. Main Outcomes

Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ [22]). The PSQ is a 30-item self-report instrument
to measure ‘recent’ (during the last month) stress. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert
scale (from 1 = almost never to 4 = almost always). A total score (possible range: 30–120)
was calculated by adding up all items; higher scores indicate a higher perceived stress
level. This measurement was taken during the pre- and post-intervention assessments. The
validated Spanish version was used [23]. It showed an adequate internal consistency in the
present study (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.83 to 0.89).

Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS [5]). The MBI-GS measures
the three basic burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion (MBI-EE), depersonalisation
(MBI-D), and personal achievement (MBI-PA). It consists of 15 items measured on a 7-point
Likert scale (from 0 = never to 6 = always). Higher scores indicate a higher level of burnout.
This measurement was taken during the pre- and post-intervention assessments. The
validated Spanish version was used [24]. It showed an adequate internal consistency in the
present study (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.78 to 0.87).

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6226

Salivary Immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Immunoglobulin A is an indicator of immune
function state, as well as a reliable and widely used biomarker that interacts with stress
response [25]. Ongoing and untreated work stress decreases levels of sIgA [26]. The
levels of IgA were measured before and after the ﬁrst and last sessions by collecting saliva
samples from participants using Salivettes (Sarstedt, Rommersdolf, Germany). Saliva
samples were frozen at 20 ◦C immediately after arriving at the laboratory and they were
kept in this state until they were sent to an external laboratory for analysis. sIgA levels were
measured by nephelometry (BN-II), using the reagent OSAR15 anti-IgA (Dade Behring),
with a sensitivity of 0.2 mg/dL.

Self-Compassion Scale, Short-Form (SCS-SF [27]). The SCS-SF is a 12-item self-report
tool that assesses the three facets of self-compassion: Self-Kindness (SCS-SK), Common
Humanity (SCS-CH), and Mindfulness (SCS-M). Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale
(from 1 = almost never to 5 = almost always). Following recent recommendations [28], a
total score was calculated by adding the scores of items from the positive facets. Higher
scores indicate a higher level of self-compassion (possible range: 6–30). The validated
Spanish version was used [29]. It showed an adequate internal consistency in the present
study (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.63 to 0.84). This measurement was taken during the
pre- and post-intervention assessments.

Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II [30]). The AAQ-II is a 7-item measure
of psychological ﬂexibility and experiential avoidance. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert
scale (from 1 = never to 7 = always). Higher total scores mean both less ﬂexibility and more
experiential avoidance, and lower total scores mean greater ﬂexibility and less experiential
avoidance (possible range: 7–49). The validated Spanish version was used [31]. It showed
an adequate internal consistency in the present study (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.91 to
0.93). This measurement was taken during the pre- and post-intervention assessments.

2.6. Data Analysis

All analyses were performed using version 24 of IBM SPSS. First, the chi-square test
and t tests were computed for categorical and continuous sociodemographic variables,
respectively, to investigate statistical differences between groups at baseline. The scales’
internal consistency was established by calculating Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients. Then,
the normality of the distribution of scores for the dependent variables was determined
by checking the kurtosis and skewness of the variables, performing the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov Test, and inspecting the Normal Q-Q Plots. Moreover, Levene’s test for equality of
variances was performed as part of the analyses. It was observed that all variables meet
the assumption of normality, so paired-samples t-tests were conducted to evaluate the
impact of the interventions on employees’ scores for the stress (PSQ), burnout (MBI-GS),
self-compassion (SCS-SF), and experiential avoidance (AAQ-II). Then, a one-way analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted between groups to compare the effectiveness
of both interventions. The independent variable was the type of intervention (MSCBI,
WSMI), and the dependent variables consisted of PSQ, MBI-GS, SCS-SF, and AAQ-II scores
assessed after the intervention was completed. Participants’ scores in the pre-intervention
assessment were used as the covariates in this analysis.

Regarding the biological variable, paired-samples t-tests were conducted to evaluate
the impact of the ﬁrst and last sessions of each intervention on employees’ immune function
state (sIgA). Then, ANCOVAs were carried out to compare the effectiveness of the inter-
ventions through these sessions. For this purpose, we considered the type of intervention
(MSCBI, WSMI) as the independent variable, post-session levels of sIgA as the dependent
variable, and pre-session levels of sIgA as the covariates, for each session respectively.

3. Results

Table 3 displays the means and standard deviations of perceived stress, burnout, self-
compassion, and experiential avoidance scores for each group. Based on the results, it is
clear that the paired-samples t-tests conducted to evaluate the impact of the MSCBI showed

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6226

7 of 10

a signiﬁcant decrease in the scores for perceived stress, emotional exhaustion, depersonal-
isation, and experiential avoidance. The eta-squared statistic indicated large effect sizes
ranging from 0.25 to 0.65 (except for the personal achievement subscale). Regarding the
WSMI group, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in perceived stress, burnout,
and experiential avoidance scores. Furthermore, there was a statistically signiﬁcant de-
crease in self-compassion scores from baseline to post-intervention assessments (see Table 3
for paired-samples t-tests).

After adjusting for baseline scores, there were signiﬁcant differences between the
two intervention groups regarding post-intervention levels of perceived stress, emotional
exhaustion, self-compassion, and experiential avoidance (see Table 3 for ANCOVAs). The
partial eta-squared statistic indicated large effect sizes ranging from 0.24 to 0.42.

Table 4 shows sIgA means and standard deviations before and after the ﬁrst and

statistically signiﬁcant increases in the sIgA levels of participants who underwent the
MSCBI from the beginning to the end of the ﬁrst and last sessions. The eta-squared statistic
(0.66–0.67) indicated large effect sizes. Regarding the control group, only participants’
sIgA levels signiﬁcantly increased in the last session, with a large effect size (0.64). Finally,
after adjusting for pre-ﬁrst session levels of sIgA, there were no signiﬁcant differences
between the two intervention groups regarding immunity function in the post-ﬁrst session

between groups in terms of post-last session sIgA levels (F1, 22 = 7.48, p = 0.013, ηp

4. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a 6-week workplace
mindfulness- and self-compassion-based intervention on perceived stress, burnout, im-
mune functioning (assessed with the biomarker Immunoglobulin A), self-compassion, and
experiential avoidance compared to an active group control.

Results on the differences between groups showed that participants in the MSCBI
group saw a greater improvement in their average perceived stress and burnout (emotional
exhaustion) than in the active control group (WSMI). These results are in line with recent
studies on the effect of MSCBIs on work-related perceived stress and burnout, especially
the exhaustion dimension, which is one of the most characteristic aspects of burnout [11,13].

Although there is not enough empirical evidence for any speciﬁc psychological interven-
tions in the workplace [8], our results are in line with the evidence that workplace MBIs
decrease burnout and stress levels and have other positive effects on mental health [32–34].
Further research should explain how these effects are produced, i.e., which are the involved
mechanisms of action [9]. The present study measured psychological variables that might
explain those effects, e.g., self-compassion and psychological ﬂexibility. In this regard,
mindfulness facets have been considered as mechanisms of change in the decrease of
burnout after an MBI [35].

Moreover, participants who underwent the MSCBI saw a signiﬁcant improvement
in their average psychological ﬂexibility and self-compassion. Previous studies have
shown that psychological ﬂexibility is highly correlated with self-compassion, and both are
predictors of well-being (e.g., [36]). Furthermore, it has been described as an enhancer of
self-compassion in work-related contexts [37]. In the same vein, although it is not possible to
determine the effect of the improvement in self-compassion on the rest of the variables and
other organisational outcomes, we think that it might explain the decrease in burnout and
perceived stress due to the empirical evidence of the associations between those variables
(e.g., [38]). In this regard, Reizer [39] found that self-compassion mediates the effect of
attachment styles on job performance, organisational citizenship behaviours, turnover
intentions, and emotional exhaustion. However, the role of compassion in organisational
domains needs further consideration beyond hospital settings.

It seems that MBIs may also improve immune system functioning [40]. Bellosta-Batalla et al. [41]
validated sIgA as a biological variable that is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of MBIs
in ﬁeld research. However, they did not take into account the inﬂuence of a control group
in their study. Our results conﬁrm that sIgA is a biomarker able to measure a change in
immune function state among participants who have undergone an MBI. In this study,
participants who underwent the MBI saw an increase in their immune function in the
ﬁrst and last sessions. This means that the MSCBI was able to counteract the effect of
work-related stress on sIgA at least in the two sessions in which we could assess it. Apart
from sIgA, C-reactive protein, interleukin, and antibody titers in response to the inﬂuenza
vaccine are other biomarkers feasible for measuring immune function in workplace MBIs.
Nevertheless, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of mindfulness training in
improving them [42].

Lastly, the limitations of this study should be taken into account. Firstly, some partici-
pants from both groups could not participate in the post-intervention assessment due to
clashing schedules. As a result, the sample was smaller than expected which in turn might
have underpowered the study. Secondly, although we followed a randomised clinical trial
design, we were not able to properly register it. Finally, the assessment of sIgA in the ﬁrst
and last sessions was not enough to examine the effect of the interventions on it.

5. Conclusions

The results of this article have several implications. Firstly, the study increases the
external validity of mindfulness- and self-compassion-based training in the work context
and provides information to design an adequate and powered future RCT. Secondly, it
suggests that MSCBIs might be more effective than regular psychoeducational interventions
for work-related stress and burnout treatment. Thirdly, sIgA can be used to assess immune
function state changes among participants who have undergone MBIs. However, more
studies that assess this biomarker every session are needed to determine the effect of the
intervention. Moreover, these results indicate that it is feasible to carry out MSCBIs within
companies and during working hours and that these interventions might help to effectively
manage stress and burnout associated with the work environment, which in turn has a
beneﬁcial inﬂuence on the biological parameters related to workers’ health.
