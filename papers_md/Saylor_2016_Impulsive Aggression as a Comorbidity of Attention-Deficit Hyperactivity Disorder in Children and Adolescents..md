Impulsive Aggression as a Comorbidity
of Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder
in Children and Adolescents

Keith E. Saylor, PhD, ScM1 and Birgit H. Amann, MD 2

Abstract

Objective: This article examines the characteristics of impulsive aggression (IA) as a comorbidity in children and adolescents
with attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), focusing on its incidence, impact on ADHD outcomes, need for timely
intervention, and limitations of current treatment practices.
Methods: Relevant literature was retrieved with electronic searches in PubMed and PsycINFO using the search strategy of
‘‘ADHD OR attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder’’ AND ‘‘impulsive aggression OR reactive aggression OR hostile
aggression OR overt aggression’’ AND ‘‘pediatric OR childhood OR children OR pre-adolescent OR adolescent’’ with
separate searches using review OR clinical trial as search limits. Key articles published before the 2007 Expert Consensus
Report on IA were identiﬁed using citation analysis.
Results: More than 50% of preadolescents with ADHD combined subtype reportedly display clinically signiﬁcant aggres-
sion, with impulsive aggression being the predominant subtype. Impulsive aggression is strongly predictive of a highly
unfavorable developmental trajectory characterized by the potential for persistent ADHD, increasing psychosocial burden,
accumulating comorbidities, serious lifelong functional deﬁcits across a broad range of domains, delinquency/criminality,
and adult antisocial behavior. Impulsive aggression, which triggers peer rejection and a vicious cycle of escalating dys-
function, may be a key factor in unfavorable psychosocial outcomes attributed to ADHD. Because severe aggressive behavior
does not remit in many children when treated with primary ADHD therapy (i.e., stimulants and behavioral therapy), a
common practice is to add medication of a different class to speciﬁcally target aggressive behavior.
Conclusions: Impulsive aggression in children and adolescents with ADHD is a serious clinical and public health problem.
Although adjunctive therapy with an aggression-targeted agent is widely recommended when aggressive behaviors do not
remit with primary ADHD therapy, empirical evidence does not currently support the use of any speciﬁc agent. Randomized
controlled trials are needed to identify aggression-targeted agents with favorable beneﬁt–risk proﬁles.

Background

Behavior with the immediate intent to cause harm -

whether to self, others, objects, or property - constitutes ag-
gression. Although toddlers will often be physically aggressive when
expressing anger, the use of physical aggression typically declines as
cognitive and language abilities develop and children become more
competent in regulating their emotions (Campbell et al. 2006). Ag-
gressive behavior becomes maladaptive when it persists, occurs
outside an acceptable social context, and is of an intensity, fre-
quency, severity, and/or duration detrimental to the child’s interests
(Connor et al. 2006; Jensen et al. 2007). Maladaptive aggression is

disproportionate to preceding events, can occur without an ante-
cedent social cue, violates social rules, and does not terminate
readily. Importantly, maladaptive aggression is an expression of
central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and may, therefore, be
amenable to treatments targeting its neurobiologic substrate. Ag-
gressive behavior in children accounts for 25% of special services in
school (Hubbard et al. 2010) and is one of the most common causes
of mental health referrals, accounting for up to 60% of child psy-
chiatry referrals (Steiner et al. 2003; Connor et al. 2006).

Aggression can be categorized into two broad subtypes based on
the aggressor’s motivation: 1) Reactive or impulsive and 2) proactive
or instrumental (Vitiello and Stoff 1997). Impulsive aggression (IA)

is angry, retaliatory aggression arising out of frustration, annoyance,
or hostility to real or perceived provocations - stressors that youth
of the same age typically experience with equanimity. Impulsive
aggression is, therefore, an unplanned and immediate response re-
ﬂecting out-of-control emotionality that satisﬁes immediate emotional
pressures, albeit with negative consequences to the aggressor. In
contrast, instrumental aggression is consciously planned, goal-oriented
behavior with the speciﬁc intent of beneﬁting the aggressor. Although
these are distinct subtypes of aggression, they both occur to varying
degrees in aggressive children (Hubbard et al. 2010). Impulsive
aggression, which is associated with a broad array of psychiatric
disorders, is the most common phenotype in clinical populations,
occurring in * 80% of aggressive children (Vitaro et al. 2002).

Within well-deﬁned psychiatric disorders such as attention-
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), IA is a clinically distinct
and common behavior. Impulsive aggression has been likened to
fever or pain that generalizes across multiple medical illnesses and
informs about the severity but not the speciﬁc nature of the illness
( Jensen et al. 2007). Although IA appears to be more responsive to
intervention than instrumental aggression, it is often refractory to
treatments targeting the primary disorder (e.g., ADHD). Re-
cognizing that clinicians lack evidence-based medication strategies
for managing refractory IA, an expert consensus report re-
commended that randomized controlled trials be conducted with
available drugs, which are currently being used off-label, as well as
new drugs to speciﬁcally assess the efﬁcacy and safety of medi-
cations as IA-targeted therapy ( Jensen et al. 2007). This review will
characterize IA in the speciﬁc context of ADHD, whereas other
articles in this special edition will focus on IA associated with
autism and bipolar disorder as primary disorders. Speciﬁcally, we
will examine the incidence of IA as a comorbidity of childhood
ADHD, its impact on the developmental trajectory of ADHD, the
vicious cycle of dysfunction that warrants timely intervention, the
limitations of primary ADHD therapy, and the need for empirical
evidence to support current treatment practices of adding antipsy-
chotics and/or mood stabilizers as adjunctive IA-targeted therapy.

Impulsive Aggression as a Comorbid
Behavior in ADHD

According to the 2011 National Survey of Children’s Health,
parent-reported prevalence of diagnosed ADHD in children and
adolescents is 6.8–10.2%, making ADHD the most common neu-
rodevelopmental disorder in youth (Visser et al. 2010, 2014) Al-
though aggression is not diagnostic of ADHD ( Jensen et al. 2007;
Connor et al. 2010a), it is often a prominent feature in the clinical
presentation of ADHD and the impetus for the initial referral for
mental health evaluation (King and Waschbusch 2010). A post-hoc
analysis of data from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children
with ADHD (MTA) showed that 54% of study participants with
ADHD combined subtype displayed clinically signiﬁcant aggres-
sion at baseline ( Jensen et al. 2007). Moreover, a multivariate re-
gression analysis of impairment scores found that aggression had a
much greater impact (*10% of variance) on parents’ overall im-
pairment ratings than core ADHD symptoms, which accounted for
only *2% of variance ( Jensen et al. 2007). Because caregivers
who feel they cannot manage a severely aggressive child or ado-
lescent will often request medication changes ( Jensen et al. 2007),
severe aggression in ADHD increases the likelihood that non-
ADHD drugs such as antipsychotics and/or mood stabilizers will be
used adjunctively with ADHD medication, even though clinicians
currently lack high quality evidence to guide treatment decisions.

Because aggression had not been widely studied in clinical sam-
ples of children and adolescents with ADHD, Connor et al. compared
a referral ADHD population with community controls, using multi-
ple scales to measure aggressive behaviors (Connor et al. 2010a).
Children with ADHD were consistently more aggressive than com-
munity controls. Aggression exhibited a ‘‘dose effect,’’ in terms of a
signiﬁcant correlation between aggression severity and number of
comorbid diagnoses, as well as ADHD symptom severity. Impulsive
forms of aggression were signiﬁcantly more common than instru-
mental forms for all ADHD children than for community controls,
for the ‘‘pure’’ ADHD group (no comorbid diagnosis), and in each
ADHD plus comorbidity subset. In analyses controlling for co-
morbidity, all ADHD subtypes (including a group with ADHD
symptoms not meeting diagnostic criteria) were signiﬁcantly more
aggressive than community controls; scores tended to be highest for
the ADHD combined subtype. Results, therefore, suggested that
aggression is a generalized marker of ADHD severity.

In the abovementioned study, only patients meeting diagnostic
criteria were counted as having a speciﬁc psychiatric comorbidity
such as oppositional deﬁant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder
(CD). However, ODD/CD externalizing behaviors can be present at
subthreshold levels in ADHD children. Connor et al., therefore,
compared ADHD youth with non-ADHD controls in terms of
emotional and behavioral symptoms often associated with ADHD
(Connor et al. 2012). The ADHD cohort was divided into all
children with hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms (hyperac-
tive subtype + combined subtype) and those with inattentive sub-
type only; the non-ADHD controls included a psychiatric referral
group and a community control group. Those with ADHD symp-
toms displayed more severe aggression than children in the control
groups. Externalizing behavior problems and aggression, which
increased as ADHD symptom severity increased, appeared to be
related to the hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD domain.

Historically,

the ADHD–aggression relationship has been
viewed as one in which aggression and ADHD symptoms are
separate but correlated dimensions of externalizing behavior
(Waschbusch 2002; King and Waschbusch 2010) More recently,
however, IA has also been attributed to emotional impulsivity/
dysregulation, which appears to be a central feature of ADHD.
Emotional impulsivity refers to deﬁcits in the ﬁrst step of emotional
self-control; that is, the ability to inhibit strong emotional reactions
to environmental events (Barkley 2010; Barkley and Fischer 2010;
Barkley and Murphy 2010) Emotional dysregulation reﬂects deﬁ-
cits in the second step of emotional self-control; that is, deﬁcits in
the ability to self-regulate the emotional state to be more age ap-
propriate, socially acceptable, and consistent with the individual’s
long-term well-being. Emotional impulsivity/dysregulation may be
responsible, at least in part, for the co-occurrence of ADHD, IA, and
externalizing ODD behaviors, which have also been attributed to
emotional impulsivity/dysregulation. (Barkley and Fischer 2010;
Barkley and Murphy 2010).

Although childhood ADHD was once viewed as a benign, self-
limiting disorder in which symptoms remitted by adolescence,
numerous prospective longitudinal studies have clearly established
the negative impact of childhood ADHD and its reverberations into
adolescence and adulthood. ‘‘Life consequences’’ of longitudinal
ADHD studies have been broadly categorized as academic, anti-
social behavior, driving, nonmedicinal drug use/addictive behav-
ior, obesity, occupation, services use, self-esteem, and social
function outcomes (Shaw et al. 2012), with the least desirable de-
velopmental trajectory being a progression from childhood ADHD
to adult antisocial behavior (McKay and Halperin 2001).

IMPULSIVE AGGRESSION IN CHILDHOOD ADHD

21

Aggressiveness plus hyperactive-impulsive-inattentive behavior
in children ampliﬁes the risks of various psychological, academic,
emotional, and social problems when compared with either be-
havior pattern alone (Shelton et al. 1998). Similarly, in later
childhood and adolescence, aggressive-hyperactive-impulsive be-
havior versus hyperactivity-impulsivity alone is associated with
markedly higher risk of persistent behavioral problems, CD, en-
counters with the justice system, deﬁcits in academic achievement,
behavioral and disciplinary problems at school, and substance ex-
perimentation/abuse (Satterﬁeld et al. 1982; Campbell 1987; Walker
et al. 1987; Fischer et al. 1990; Biederman et al. 1996; Mannuzza
et al. 1998; Shelton et al. 1998). Although studies demonstrating the
high risk of impairments in young aggressive, hyperactive-impulsive
children did not differentiate aggression types, McKay and Halperin
(2001) have argued that early-onset, pervasive, and unremitting IA in
the context of impulsive thoughts, emotional lability, and impulsive
behavior represents a high-risk proﬁle for progression from child-
hood ADHD to adult antisocial disorders.

Impulsive Aggression in ADHD Children:
The Lifetime Legacy of Peer Rejection

Optimal social outcomes depend on children being able to forge
positive relationships with peers, because skills critical to effective
social functioning – for example, cooperation, negotiation, and con-
ﬂict resolution – are developed primarily in the context of peer in-
teractions (Hoza 2007). Peer problems in general are predictive of an
array of serious adjustment problems, including delinquency, sub-
stance abuse, dropping out of school, academic difﬁculties, and other
psychopathology (Parker and Asher 1987; Hoza et al. 2005a) - im-
pairments that have also been chronicled in association with ADHD.
Therefore, it is important to understand peer relationships within the
context of ADHD, particularly with regard to comorbid IA.

A range of social problems have been associated with inattention
and hyperactivity-impulsivity in children and adolescents, includ-
ing fewer friendships, bullying, victimization, and poor relation-
ships with peers (Wheeler and Carlson 1994; Hoza 2007; Nijmeijer
et al. 2008). Peer rejection is a common occurrence for ADHD
children, with IA having an especially potent effect. At the baseline
assessment for the MTA study (MTA Cooperative Group 1999),
52% of children meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD were re-
jected by peers compared with 14% of their randomly selected
classmates (Hoza et al. 2005b). In addition, children in the MTA
study were less well liked and had fewer friends than their class-
mates; 56% did not have reciprocal friends, versus 32% of their
classmates (Mrug et al. 2012). They were disliked by children with
higher status in the peer group and, therefore, subject to being
excluded by more popular peers. Moreover, deﬁcits in peer rela-
tionships were consistent across age and gender and were well
established by at least 7 years of age (lowest age at study entry).

With their noncompliant, disruptive, and aggressive behavior,
ADHD children are almost immediately rejected by their non-
ADHD peers; for example, by the end of their ﬁrst play session
(Erhardt and Hinshaw 1994; Mrug et al. 2001). Once peer rejection
develops within a social group, it is highly resistant to change
(Murray-Close et al. 2010). Longitudinal data from the MTA study
showed vicious cycles between aggression and social skills and be-
tween peer rejection and social skills (e.g., aggression at Time 1 /
lower social skills at Time 2 / heightened aggression at Time 3 /
lower social skills at Time 4) (Murray-Close et al. 2010). These
reinforcing cycles of dysfunction may contribute to accumulating
difﬁculties faced by children with ADHD. Unfortunately, peer

problems can follow children with ADHD wherever they go (Mrug
et al. 2007). The evidence is overwhelming that peer rejection in
ADHD is pervasive and stable over time, persisting from childhood
at least into adolescence ( Johnston et al. 1985; Bagwell et al. 2001).
Moreover, peer rejection in ADHD children is highly impairing, as
shown in the MTA study in which peer rejection independently
predicted cigarette smoking, delinquency, anxiety, and global im-
pairment at 6 year post-baseline (average age, 15 years) and global
impairment at 8 years (average age, 17 years) (Mrug et al. 2012).
Although attention problems and nonaggressive externalizing
behaviors (e.g., restlessness, intrusiveness) may contribute to peer
problems (Nijmeijer et al. 2008) IA versus instrumental aggression
has been most strongly implicated in terms of peer rejection. Im-
pulsively aggressive children are less accepted and experience
greater rejection and victimization than peers who are nonaggressive
or engage in instrumental aggressive acts (Boivin et al. 1995; Card
et al. 2006; Morrow et al. 2006; Evans et al. 2015). In fact, children in
whom aggressive acts are primarily instrumental are more likely to
be popular with peers (Boivin et al. 1995; Card et al. 2006; Evans
et al. 2015). Impulsive aggression has also been associated with
fewer friendships and lower quality/higher conﬂict friendships
(Poulin and Boivin 2000; Abikoff et al. 2004; Evans et al. 2015).

Evans et al. (2015) examined the relative roles of IA and in-
strumental aggression in the association between ADHD symp-
toms (inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity) and peer rejection in
adolescence. Results showed that hyperactivity-impulsivity was
uniquely linked with IA, which was in turn predictive of peer re-
jection. In contrast, hyperactivity-impulsivity was predictive of in-
strumental aggression but instrumental aggression was not uniquely
associated with peer rejection. The speciﬁc path of hyperactivity-
impulsivity / IA / peer rejection accounted for two thirds of the
total variance in the model. Because hyperactive-impulsive youth
who engage in impulsively aggressive behavior are at especially high
risk of peer problems/social maladjustment, timely intervention with
effective treatments targeting hyperactivity-impulsivity and IA
might lead to improving social outcomes driven by peer rejection
( Jensen et al. 2007; Evans et al. 2015)

Pharmacotherapy in Impulsive Aggression
Associated with ADHD

The ultimate goal of intervention in children with ADHD is to
minimize or eliminate functional impairment caused by the dis-
ruptive effects of ADHD on psychosocial development. The ﬁnd-
ing that ADHD-related impairment
is attributable more to
aggression/irritability than to ADHD symptoms themselves ( Jen-
sen et al. 2007) emphasizes the need to target aggression in ADHD
with evidence-based treatment strategies.

Current treatment recommendations in children with ADHD and
comorbid IA are to ﬁrst treat the primary disorder - ADHD - before
directly targeting IA, with the idea that successful treatment of ADHD
will have a positive impact on associated disruptive behaviors such as
IA (Pappadopulos et al. 2003; Steiner et al. 2003; Connor et al. 2006;
Jensen et al. 2007). Various guidelines have outlined systematic
approaches relevant to the assessment and management of ADHD
and IA (Pappadopulos et al. 2003; Pliszka et al. 2006; Pliszka and
AACAP Work Group on Quality Issues 2007; Wolraich et al.
2011; Scotto Rosato et al. 2012). Across guidelines, psychosocial
intervention with an effect size of 0.4–0.9 (Connor et al. 2006) is
an important backdrop to pharmacotherapy. Its initiation relative
to pharmacotherapy is based on considerations such as symptom
severity and family preferences/concerns.

22

SAYLOR AND AMANN

A number of stimulant and nonstimulant medications have been
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for
the management of ADHD in children and adolescents based on
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating
signiﬁcant reductions in core ADHD symptoms as well signiﬁcant
improvements in global outcome assessments. Guidelines univer-
sally recommend that ADHD-directed pharmacotherapy be initi-
ated with one of these medications as monotherapy, which should
be tailored to individual needs for optimal balance of improvement
and tolerability.

An abundance of empirical evidence supports that psychosocial/
behavior therapy plus medication monotherapy should be the pri-
mary therapy for children with ADHD. The recommended ‘‘next
step,’’ when clinically signiﬁcant aggression persists despite
ADHD monotherapy, is to speciﬁcally target aggression with a
different class of medication (Pappadopulos et al. 2003; Pliszka
et al. 2006; Pliszka and AACAP Work Group on Quality Issues
2007; Scotto Rosato et al. 2012). However, no medication has yet
been approved for the management of IA, whether globally across
psychiatric disorders or as an element of a speciﬁc disorder.
Guidelines relevant to pharmacotherapy in children with ADHD
and comorbid aggression have been disadvantaged by the paucity
of data from randomized controlled trials that speciﬁcally assessed
aggression as a primary outcome in ADHD children. Because the
body of empirical evidence supporting combination therapy in
children with ADHD and IA remains extremely limited, the 2007
Consensus Report on IA ( Jensen et al. 2007) has spurred efforts to
address the treatment needs of this vulnerable, at-risk population.

ADHD-targeted monotherapy: Effect on IA

Numerous studies have demonstrated that primary ADHD
therapy reduces not only core ADHD symptoms but also symptoms
of comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (Connor et al. 2010b).
However, few studies have assessed the impact of ADHD medi-
cations on aggression per se, much less on IA. Most studies have
used instruments that broadly assessed disruptive behaviors across
heterogeneous domains such as oppositionality/irritability/aggres-
sion, or have not separated IA from instrumental aggression, which
may be less medication responsive.

In meta-analyses collating data from studies with stimulants in
children and adolescents with ADHD with or without CD or ODD,
mean effect sizes for overt aggression ranged from 0.60 (Scotto
Rosato et al. 2012) to 0.84 (Connor et al. 2002), compared with
0.77–1.2 for core ADHD symptoms (Faraone and Buitelaar 2010).
Just as nonstimulants (a-2 agonists, atomoxetine) have more
modest effect sizes relative to stimulants in core ADHD symptoms
(e.g., *0.6), effect sizes for disruptive behaviors in ADHD are also
somewhat smaller for nonstimulants relative to stimulants (e.g.,
*0.3–0.4) (Hirota et al. 2014; Schwartz and Correll 2014).

Despite the relatively robust effects of stimulants on exter-
nalizing behaviors/aggression, an exploratory post-hoc analysis
of data from the MTA study demonstrated the limits of stimulant
monotherapy ( Jensen et al. 2007). In children with moderate or
high baseline levels of aggression who were assigned to medi-
cation alone or in combination with behavior therapy, 44% still
had signiﬁcant impairment caused by aggressive behaviors at 14
months, even though medication was tightly monitored to
maintain optimal dosages. A more recent study prospectively
examined the impact of stimulant
therapy in preadolescent
children with ADHD and comorbid ODD or CD who presented
with marked, persistent aggression despite previous treatment

with a stimulant (Blader et al. 2010). Once stimulant mono-
therapy was optimized, 50% of patients still had clinically sig-
niﬁcant aggression. Given the potent effect of aggression on
ADHD outcomes, these observations make clear why long-term
outcomes improve with primary ADHD therapy but not to the
level of children without ADHD.

Aggression-targeted combination therapy

Although children and adolescents with stimulant-refractory
aggression may represent a relatively small subset of youth with
ADHD, they are an especially vulnerable, at-risk population who
bear the brunt of ADHD-related morbidity. These patients may
beneﬁt from the addition of a drug of a different class to manage
residual aggressive behaviors refractory to primary ADHD therapy.
Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and a-2 agonists have been
evaluated, at one time or another, for their effects on aggression in
children. Although risperidone and other ‘‘atypical’’ antipsychotics
have historically been at the forefront of treatment recommendations
regarding combination therapy for managing comorbid aggression in
children with ADHD (Pappadopulos et al. 2003; Pliszka et al. 2006;
Pliszka and AACAP Work Group on Quality Issues 2007), only two
double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of risperidone as
adjunctive therapy in children with ADHD and stimulant-resistant
aggression have been published: 1) A pilot study in 25 children that
was likely underpowered and did not detect a signiﬁcant treatment
effect (Armenteros et al. 2007; Aman et al. 2014), and 2) the recently
completed Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA)
study in which the effect size for IA as a secondary end-point was
modest (0.29) (Farmer et al. 2011; Aman et al. 2014; Gadow et al.
2014). The TOSCA study has provided at least some initial empirical
evidence to support a stepped-care approach in which ADHD chil-
dren with severe aggression are initially treated with primary ADHD
therapy (medication plus parent training) followed by adjunctive
antipsychotic therapy targeted to IA. However, the long-term car-
diometabolic effects of risperidone and similar antipsychotics, es-
pecially in the face of very limited evidence of efﬁcacy as IA-
targeted therapy in ADHD, have become cause for considerable
concern. Despite opposing effects on weight, stimulant cotherapy
does not attenuate the adverse effects of risperidone or similar agents
on body composition, metabolic parameters, prolactin, or sedation
(Calarge et al. 2009; Penzner et al. 2009). Although metabolic pro-
ﬁles may differ across atypical antipsychotics, all are associated with
signiﬁcant weight gain and shifts to overweight or obese status
(Correll et al. 2009), underscoring the need to consider weight and
metabolically neutral alternatives as IA-targeted therapy.

Clinical research on the use of ‘‘typical’’ antipsychotics to target
aggressive behaviors in in children and adolescents was essentially
abandoned once newer antipsychotics became available, out of the
now mistaken belief that the risk of extrapyramidal side effects
(EPS) was signiﬁcantly lower with the newer agents and that
children were more susceptible to EPS occurrence (Pappadopulos
et al. 2003), However, EPS incidence and changes in EPS ratings
have been shown to not be signiﬁcantly different when directly
comparing atypical antipsychotics with atypical antipsychotic of
intermediate potency (Miller et al. 2008). This has led to a more
nuanced picture of antipsychotics as a single drug class with a
spectrum of EPS risk that depends largely upon dopamine- and
acetylcholine-receptor binding afﬁnities as well as individual sus-
ceptibility (Caroff et al. 2011), and to an interest in the potential
role of midpotency weight and metabolically neutral antipsychotics
as IA-targeted therapy in children and adolescents with ADHD.

IMPULSIVE AGGRESSION IN CHILDHOOD ADHD

23

Published data on such drugs as adjunctive therapy in stimulant-
refractory aggression are limited to an open-label, dose-ranging
study with an experimental formulation of molindone (Stocks et al.
2012), which showed dose-related improvements in oppositional
behaviors/conduct problems in preadolescent ADHD children with
serious conduct problems and aggressive behavior. Results of a
subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01364662)
in children with IA associated with ADHD have not yet been pub-
lished. However, in a double-blind study in schizophrenic youth,
molindone appeared to be a potentially promising alternative given
its favorable safety proﬁle relative to atypical antipsychotics (Sikich
et al. 2008). Contrary to expectations at the time the study was
initiated, the antipsychotics molindone, olanzapine, and risperidone
could not be differentiated on the basis of efﬁcacy or tolerability (i.e.,
discontinuations caused by adverse effects); however safety proﬁles
were signiﬁcantly different at the doses used to treat schizophrenia.
Olanzapine and risperidone, but not molindone, were associated with
signiﬁcant increases in weight/body mass index (BMI). Whereas
akathisia was reported by more molindone-treated patients, it was not
associated with more dystonic or parkinsonian symptoms than the
comparators (prophylactic benztropine used in all groups). As the
study authors noted, different adverse effect proﬁles are difﬁcult to
rank in terms of their clinical importance, but the proﬁle for anti-
psychotics with adverse weight and metabolic effects represents a
cardiovascular safety concern, whereas the concern with molindone
in terms of akathisia/EPS may be one of tolerability/adherence
(Sikich et al. 2008).

Mood stabilizers and the a-2 agonists clonidine and guanfacine
are also drugs of interest as adjunctive therapy in children with
ADHD and severe aggression/disruptive behavior disorders. A
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with divalproex is particularly
informative in that it assessed treatment effects using an aggression-
speciﬁc instrument (Retrospective Modiﬁed Overt Aggression Scale
[R-MOAS]) albeit without differentiating impulsive from instru-
mental aggression (Blader et al. 2009). By showing that the pro-
portion of patients in whom aggression remitted (i.e., behaviors
markedly more manageable and not requiring further changes in
pharmacotherapy) signiﬁcantly favored adjunctive therapy (dival-
proex) over stimulant monotherapy (placebo), this study provides
support for a stepped-care approach to drug therapy in children with
ADHD and severe IA. Larger studies with divalproex as well as other
classes of drugs are needed to replicate the ﬁndings. In addition,
long-term follow-up is needed to determine that normalizing IA
behavior in children with ADHD has additive beneﬁt in terms of
improving long-term outcomes.

Conclusions

For many children with ADHD, symptoms eventually remit with
effective intervention. However, the prospects are very different for
children in whom ADHD is marked by chronic aggression, espe-
cially IA. They struggle to navigate the demands of daily living,
particularly those related to social function. Their behavior is
anathema to peers, which can initiate a vicious cycle of escalating
dysfunction. Current treatment recommendations for these children
involve a stepped-care approach with intervention that initially tar-
gets ADHD, followed by the addition of a non-ADHD medication
targeting residual IA. Although primary ADHD therapy is supported
by a large body of empirical evidence, clinicians do not yet have
empirical data to support decisions on which IA-targeted drug to use,
when to initiate adjunctive therapy, how to monitor progress, or
when to change or discontinue medications. However, with IA in

childhood ADHD now being recognized as a serious clinical and
public health concern, research efforts are underway to address the
need for effective treatments in this high-risk population.

Clinical Signiﬁcance

In the clinic, physicians encounter IA as a relatively common co-
morbidity of ADHD in children and adolescents. The presence of IA
in association with ADHD does not imply or require a comorbid
diagnosis of ODD, although the approach to management may be
similar. Impulsive aggression should be viewed as a marker of severe
disease that ampliﬁes the negative consequences of ADHD and,
therefore, requires timely and intensive intervention. In the current
recommended stepped-care approach, the ﬁrst step is ADHD-targeted
therapy, which should then be followed by speciﬁc aggression-
targeted therapy if aggressive behaviors do not remit. However, cli-
nicians should recognize that empirical evidence is still lacking as to
aggression-targeted treatments with favorable beneﬁt–risk proﬁles for
children and adolescents with ADHD and severe aggression.
