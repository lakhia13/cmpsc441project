Abstract

Objective: Anger, irritability, and aggression are among the most common reasons for child mental health referrals. This
review is focused on two forms of behavioral interventions for these behavioral problems: Parent management training (PMT)
and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
Methods: First, we provide an overview of anger/irritability and aggression as the treatment targets of behavioral inter-
ventions, followed by a discussion of the general principles and techniques of these treatment modalities. Then we discuss our
current work concerning the transdiagnostic approach to CBT for anger, irritability, and aggression.
Results: PMT is aimed at improving aversive patterns of family interactions that engender children’s disruptive behavior.
CBT targets deﬁcits in emotion regulation and social problem-solving that are associated with aggressive behavior. Both
forms of treatment have received extensive support in randomized controlled trials. Given that anger/irritability and ag-
gressive behavior are common in children with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, a transdiagnostic approach to CBT for anger
and aggression is described in detail.
Conclusions: PMT and CBT have been well studied in randomized controlled trials in children with disruptive behavior
disorders, and studies of transdiagnostic approaches to CBT for anger and aggression are currently underway. More work is
needed to develop treatments for other types of aggressive behavior (e.g., relational aggression) that have been relatively
neglected in clinical research. The role of callous-unemotional traits in response to behavioral interventions and treatment of
irritability in children with anxiety and mood disorders also warrants further investigation.

Introduction

Childhood disruptive behaviors such as anger outbursts and

aggression are among the most frequent reasons for outpatient
mental health referrals. In the current version of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), anger/irritability
is the core symptom of oppositional deﬁant disorder (ODD), and
aggressive behavior is most commonly associated with conduct
disorder (CD) (American Psychiatric Association 2013). However,
children with other psychiatric disorders are also at increased risk
of anger and aggression, and disruptive behavior disorders are often
comorbid with other forms of psychopathology. For example, in
population-based studies, the prevalence rates of disruptive be-
havior disorders range from 14% to 35% in children with attention-
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), from 14% to 62% in chil-
dren with anxiety disorders, and from 9% to 45% in children with
mood disorders (Nock et al. 2007). This review is focused on
psychosocial interventions for anger/irritability and aggression as
dimensions of child psychopathology. Speciﬁcally, we include par-
ent management training (PMT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy

(CBT), because these modalities have received extensive empirical
support as stand-alone interventions that are provided in the format of
outpatient psychotherapy (Sukhodolsky et al. 2004; Dretzke et al.
2009). There is also evidence that these behavioral interventions can
be helpful in conjunction with medication management for severe
aggression (Aman et al. 2014) and as part of multimodal interven-
tions for serious conduct problems, which address multiple risk fac-
tors (Sukhodolsky and Ruchkin 2006). First, we provide an overview
of anger/irritability and aggression as the treatment targets of be-
havioral interventions, followed by a discussion of the general prin-
ciples and techniques of these treatment modalities. Then we discuss
our current work concerning the transdiagnostic approach to CBT for
anger, irritability, and aggression.

Anger, Irritability, and Aggression as Treatment Targets
of Behavioral Interventions

Anger is a negative affective state that may include increased
physiological arousal, thoughts of blame, and an increased predis-
position toward aggressive behavior (Berkowitz and Harmon-Jones

2004). Anger is often triggered by frustration or interpersonal
provocation. It can also vary in duration from minutes to hours and
range in intensity from mild annoyance to rage and fury. Factor-
analytical studies distinguish between anger experience (i.e., the
inner feeling), and anger expression (i.e., an individual’s tendency to
show anger outwardly, suppress it, or actively cope with it by de-
ploying adaptive anger control skills) (Spielberger 1988). Improving
anger control skills is a primary focus of child-directed CBT ap-
proaches that teach skills for coping with anger and frustration that
are part of a broader repertoire of emotion regulation strategies.

From the developmental standpoint, various aspects of the ex-
perience and expression of anger emerge at different times and
follow different developmental trajectories. Temper tantrums that
include crying, stomping, pushing, hitting, and kicking are com-
mon in 1–4-year-old children and range in frequency from 5 to 9
times per week with an average duration of 5–10 minutes (Potegal
et al. 2003). The intensity and number of tantrums tend to decrease
with age, although typically developing children continue to out-
wardly display anger and frustration, behaviors that parents often
label as tantrums. This decrease in the frequency of temper tan-
trums as children age is paralleled by the development of emotion
regulation skills and the acquisition of socially appropriate ways to
express anger (Blanchard-Fields and Coats 2008). Intense and out-
of-control anger outbursts may be of clinical concern in young
children (Wakschlag et al. 2010). Intense anger outbursts in re-
sponse to trivial provocations may also persist across development
and manifest across various psychiatric disorders. Because of an
apparent lack of control, these behaviors have been referred to as
‘‘rage attacks’’ in severe mood dysregulation (Carlson 2007) and
Tourette Syndrome (TS) (Budman et al. 2003) as well as ‘‘melt-
downs’’ in children on the autism spectrum (Samson et al. 2015).
Over the past decade, factor-analytical studies of ODD symp-
toms have identiﬁed a unique dimension of irritability deﬁned by
three symptoms: Often loses temper, easily annoyed, and often
angry and resentful (Stringaris and Goodman 2009; Burke et al.
2014). As a result, the symptoms of ODD are now grouped into
three types: Angry/irritable mood, argumentativeness/deﬁant be-
havior, and vindictiveness, which highlights both the emotional and
behavioral aspects of this disorder. Longitudinal studies have
shown that irritability symptoms in childhood are associated with
mood and anxiety disorders later in life, whereas deﬁance and
vindictiveness predict later conduct problems (Whelan et al. 2013).
Growing recognition of irritability in childhood psychopathology
(Leibenluft and Stoddard 2013) and research on severe mood
dysregulation (Leibenluft 2011) have led to adding a new diag-
nostic category in the DSM-5, disruptive mood dysregulation dis-
order (DMDD) (American Psychiatric Association 2013). The core
symptoms of DMDD include frequent temper outbursts (i.e., three
or more times per week) and irritable or depressed mood between
the temper outbursts lasting for most of the day nearly every day.
Temper outburst may be manifested as verbal rages and/or physical
aggression toward people and property.

Aggression can be deﬁned as an overt behavior that can result in
harm to self or others (Connor 2002). Several subtypes of aggres-
sion (e.g., impulsive, reactive, hostile, affective) have been de-
scribed based on the presence of an angry affect and contrasted with
instrumental, proactive, or planned types of aggression that are not
‘‘fueled’’ by anger (Vitiello and Stoff 1997). Another well-known
classiﬁcation distinguishes between overtly confrontational anti-
social behaviors, such as arguing and ﬁghting, and covert antisocial
behaviors, such as lying, stealing, and breaking rules (Frick et al.
1993). Physical aggression was found to be a signiﬁcant risk factor

for conduct disorder at an early age of onset, later violence, and
other mental health problems such as ADHD and anxiety (Loeber
et al. 2000). Compared with physical aggression, nonaggressive
antisocial behavior was shown to follow a different developmental
trajectory (Nagin and Tremblay 1999) and predict later nonviolent
criminal offenses (Kjelsberg 2002).

Principles and Efﬁcacy of PMT

The causal pathways to childhood anger/irritability and ag-
gressive behavior involve multiple interacting biological, envi-
ronmental, and psychosocial risk factors (Loeber et al. 2009). PMT
aims to ameliorate patterns of family interactions that produce
antecedents and consequences of maintaining tantrums, aggression,
and noncompliance. PMT techniques stem from the fundamental
principle of operant conditioning, which states that the likelihood
of behavior to recur is increased or weakened based on the events
that follow the behavior (Skinner 1938). For example, a child is
more likely to have another tantrum if previous anger outbursts
have resulted in an escape from parental demands or the continu-
ation of a preferred activity. Behaviors such as noncompliance,
whining, or bickering may also be reinforced if the same beneﬁts
are afforded to the child (Patterson et al. 1989).

Harsh and inconsistent discipline such as excessive scolding and
corporal punishment have also been shown to increase aggressive
behaviors (Gershoff 2002). The broad goals of PMT are to reduce the
child’s aggression and noncompliance by improving parental com-
petence in dealing with these maladaptive behaviors. During PMT,
parents are taught to identify the function of maladaptive behavior, to
give praise for appropriate behavior, to communicate directions ef-
fectively, to ignore maladaptive attention-seeking behavior, and to
use consistent consequences for disruptive behaviors. PMT is con-
ducted with parents, although for some approaches, children are in-
vited to facilitate the practice of new parenting skills (Eyberg et al.
2008). The efﬁcacy and effectiveness of PMT have been evaluated in
>100 randomized controlled studies (Dretzke et al. 2009; Michelson
et al. 2013) and excellent treatment manuals are available for clini-
cians (Kazdin 2005; Barkley 2013). There is evidence that the im-
provements in child behavior are stable over time and can prevent
antisocial behavior in adulthood (Scott et al. 2014).

The relative efﬁcacy of different parent training approaches have
not been well studied in randomized controlled studies, but meta-
analytic reviews suggest that program components associated with
larger effects include increased positive parent–child interactions
and emotional communication skills, parental consistency with
consequences, and in vivo practice of new skills with parents
(Wyatt Kaminski et al. 2008). Improving parent–child communi-
cation about emotions has become a focus of emotion coaching
interventions, which teach parents the importance of acknowl-
edging and accepting their children’s emotional experiences as well
as modeling for their children how to identify, label, and cope with
strong emotions (Ramsden and Hubbard 2002). A recent study of
emotion coaching for parents of preschool children found im-
provements in children’s emotional knowledge and reductions in
behavior problems (Havighurst et al. 2010). However, adding an
emotion coaching component to the already established Positive
Parenting Program (Triple-P) did not show additive effects in re-
ducing disruptive behavior (Salmon et al. 2014).

Other developments in parent-directed interventions have in-
cluded adaptations of PMT for children with speciﬁc neurodeve-
lopmental disorders. Our work has shown that PMT could be helpful
for disruptive behavior in children with TS (Scahill et al. 2006) and in

60

children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (Sukhodolsky
et al. 2013). Modiﬁcations of PMT for these clinical populations
required careful consideration of anger outbursts in the context of
symptoms manifesting from the primary disorder. For example, ir-
ritability and noncompliance could be associated with OCD-related
fears or failure of parents to provide accommodations for compulsive
behaviors (Storch et al. 2012). In children with tics, disruptive be-
haviors have to be disentangled from complex tics that might re-
semble purposeful behavior (Sukhodolsky and Scahill 2007). More
recently, the Research Units on Behavioral Intervention (RUBI)
Autism Network has developed and tested a parent training program
for irritability and noncompliance in young children with autism
(Bearss et al. 2015). In addition to standard PMT strategies, the
parent training for children on the autism spectrum contains exten-
sive functional assessment strategies, visual schedules for daily
routines, and instructions to parents on how to teach developmentally
appropriate and adaptive skills to their children.

Child-Directed CBT Approaches

CBT targets deﬁcits in emotion regulation and social problem-
solving skills that are associated with aggressive behavior (Dodge
2003). The label ‘‘cognitive-behavioral’’ is used to refer to inter-
ventions that are conducted with the child and have an emphasis on
the learning principles and the use of structured strategies to produce
changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior (Kendall 2006). Common
cognitive-behavioral techniques include identifying the anteced-
ents and consequences of aggressive behavior, learning strategies
for recognizing and regulating anger expression, problem-solving
and cognitive restructuring techniques, and modeling and rehearsing
socially appropriate behaviors that can replace angry and aggressive
reactions. Although CBT is conducted with the child, parents have
multiple roles in treatment, including bringing their child to therapy,
providing information about their child’s behavioral problems, and
creating an environment between sessions that is conducive to their
child practicing CBT skills. Importantly, parents are asked to rec-
ognize their child’s effort when applying emotion regulation and
problem-solving skills learned in CBT to anger-provoking situations
and to provide praise and rewards for behavioral improvements.

Various cognitive-behavioral approaches place relative empha-
sis on at least one of three content areas: Regulation of excessive
anger, learning social problem-solving strategies, and/or develop-
ing social skills alternative to aggressive behaviors. Anger control
training (ACT) aims to improve emotion regulation and social-
cognitive deﬁcits in aggressive children. Children are taught to
monitor their emotional arousal and to use techniques such as
cognitive reappraisal and relaxation for modulating elevated levels
of anger. As part of the training, children also practice socially
appropriate responses to anger-provoking situations such as being
teased by peers or reprimanded by adults. Several programs of
research have evaluated versions of ACT with children (Lochman
et al. 2003), adolescents (Feindler and Ecton 1986; Deffenbacher
et al. 1996), and young adults (Kassinove and Tafrate 2002).
Problem-solving skills training (PSST) addresses cognitive pro-
cesses, such as faulty perceptions and decision making that are
involved in social interaction. For example, hostile attribution bias
or inability to generate alternative solutions may contribute to ag-
gressive behavior. Originating from research on social information
processing (Dodge et al. 1990) and problem solving in children
(Shure and Spivack 1972), hundreds of studies have examined the
association between cognitions in social situations and aggressive
behavior (Dodge 2003). Participants of PSST are taught to analyze

interpersonal conﬂicts, to develop nonaggressive solutions, and to
think about the consequences of their actions in problematic situ-
ations. The efﬁcacy of PSST has been demonstrated in several
controlled studies (Guerra and Slaby 1990; Kazdin et al. 1992;
Hudley and Graham 1993). There is initial evidence that the effects
of PSST on conduct problems may be mediated by a change in the
targeted deﬁcits in social information processing (Sukhodolsky
et al. 2005). Social skills training (SST) approaches to reducing
aggression and developing assertive behavior are rooted in social-
learning theory (Bandura 1973). Aggressive youth have been
shown to have weak verbal skills, poor conﬂict resolution skills,
and deﬁcits in skills that facilitate friendships (Deater-Deckard
2001). The goal of SST with aggressive youth is to enhance social
behaviors that can be deployed instead of aggression, as well as
behaviors that can be used to develop friendships with nondelin-
quent peers. Meta-analytic reviews report moderate effects of SST
on disruptive behavior (Losel and Beelmann 2003) and SST is often
used as part of multicomponent interventions such as aggression
replacement training (Gundersen and Svartdal 2006).

Transdiagnostic Approach to CBT
for Anger/Irritability and Aggression

Our approach to CBT for childhood anger and aggression has
emerged over the course of three randomized controlled trials
(Sukhodolsky and Scahill 2012). The ﬁrst study evaluated CBT in
33 elementary school children referred by teachers for aggressive
behavior in the school setting (Sukhodolsky et al. 2000). Compared
with the no-treatment control condition, children who received CBT
displayed a reduction in teacher reports of aggression and improve-
ment in self-reported anger control. The second study utilized a dis-
mantling design to investigate the relative effectiveness of the social
skills training and problem-solving training components of CBT in 26
children referred by their parents for high levels of aggressive be-
havior (Sukhodolsky et al. 2005). Children in both conditions showed
a reduction in aggression, whereas the problem-solving condition
resulted in a greater reduction in hostile attribution bias, and the
skills-training condition resulted in a greater improvement in anger
control skills. We also evaluated CBT for explosive anger outbursts
and aggression in adolescents with TS (Sukhodolsky et al. 2009). TS
is characterized by chronic motor and phonic tics that co-occur with
disruptive behavior in up to 80% of referred cases (Sukhodolsky et al.
2003). We conducted the ﬁrst randomized study of CBT for anger
control versus treatment as usual in 26 adolescents with TS and
disruptive behavior. Assessments, which included evaluations by a
blinded rater, parent reports, and child self-reports, were conducted
before and after treatment as well as 3 months posttreatment. All
randomized subjects completed the endpoint evaluation. The parent
rating of disruptive behavior decreased by 52% in the CBT condition
compared with a decrease of 11% in the control condition. The in-
dependent evaluator who was unaware of treatment assignment rated
9 of 13 subjects (69%) in the CBT condition as much improved
or very much improved as compared with 2 of 13 (15%) subjects
improved in the control condition. The CBT treatment manual that
has been developed in these clinical studies has been recently pub-
lished by Guilford Press (Sukhodolsky and Scahill 2012). Our team is
currently conducting a large randomized trial of efﬁcacy and neural
mechanisms of CBT for aggression versus a supportive psychother-
apy control condition in children across diagnostic categories, which
has been funded in response to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
initiative. The design of this study is described in our companion
article of this issue (Sukhodolsky at al. 2016 this issue).

BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR AGGRESSION

61

The treatment starts with a detailed assessment of the frequency
(i.e., number of episodes per week), duration (i.e., time) and in-
tensity (i.e., risk of injury, property damage, and impact on family)
of anger outbursts and aggressive behaviors. Aggression is oper-
ationalized as instances of verbal threats, physical aggression,
property damage, and self-injury (Silver and Yudofsky 1991).
Based on a structured clinical interview with the parent(s) and the
child, two to three of the most pressing behavioral problems are
identiﬁed as target symptoms, and used to tailor therapeutic tech-
niques as outlined in the treatment manual (Sukhodolsky and
Scahill 2012). The treatment is organized into three modules:
Emotion regulation, social problem-solving, and the development
of social skills for preventing and resolving conﬂict situations. The
ﬁrst module starts with identifying anger triggers, developing
prevention strategies, and learning emotion regulation skills such as
cognitive reappraisal and relaxation training. Sessions 4–6 cover
problem-solving skills such as the generation of multiple solutions
and the consideration of consequences for different courses of ac-
tion in conﬂicts. Sessions 7–9 focus on developing skills for pre-
venting or resolving potentially anger-provoking situations with
friends, siblings, parents, and teachers. For example, participants
are asked to recall a situation in which they acted aggressively and
to role-play behaviors that would have prevented the enactment of
aggressive behaviors. Each session consists of a menu of thera-
peutic techniques and activities that can be use used in a ﬂexible yet
reliable manner in order to achieve session goals. Each child ses-
sion also includes a parent component in which parents are in-
formed about the skills that their child has learned in the session,
and a plan is devised that enables the practicing of these skills
before the next session. Parents are asked to serve as coaches to
facilitate the acquisition of new skills by rewarding nonaggressive
behaviors with praise, attention, and privileges. Three separate
parent sessions are provided to identify patterns of aversive family
interactions that might initiate or maintain a child’s aggressive
behavior. Parents are then given instruction on how to pay attention
to their child’s positive behavior and to provide consistent rein-
forcement for their child’s efforts in tolerating frustration and using
cognitive problem-solving strategies. Additional parenting strate-
gies discussed in treatment include giving effective commands,
ignoring minor misbehaviors, and setting up behavioral contracts.
Although excellent treatment manuals are available in the area
of child and adolescent anger control (Feindler and Ecton 1986;
Lochman et al. 2008), most are written in a group therapy format
for use in school or inpatient settings. Our manual has been struc-
tured for providing CBT during individual outpatient psychother-
apy. Another feature that sets our approach apart is the focus on a
ﬂexible yet consistent implementation of CBT in children and ad-
olescents with moderate to severe anger/irritability and physical
aggression in the outpatient setting. The manual provides guide-
lines for ﬂexible delivery by allowing therapists to select from
several numbered activities that correspond to each session’s
treatment goals, which can be matched to targeted behavioral
problems on the one hand and to the child’s motivation and de-
velopmental level on the other hand. Lastly, the manual contains
treatment ﬁdelity checklists to aid in evaluating treatment adher-
ence, an important part of implementing treatment in a reliable
fashion (Perepletchikova and Kazdin 2005).

Considerations for Future Research

Although a considerable number of clinical studies have been
dedicated to physical aggression, little is known about the treatment

of relational aggression. Relational aggression refers to hurting
others by damaging their personal relationships or social status, in
contrast to overt aggression, which involves hurting someone by
physical means (Crick and Grotpeter 1995). Although less apparent
than overt aggression, relational aggression is associated with de-
pression, social anxiety, and loneliness (Roecker Phelps 2001). To
our knowledge, all treatment studies that include relational aggres-
sion outcome measures have been conducted in school settings
(Leff et al. 2010). A recent study of a 15-week curriculum focused
on communication and problem-solving skills for reducing various
types of aggression, which showed a decrease in physical aggression,
but no change in relational aggression (Espelage et al. 2013). A
review of 13 classroom-based prevention programs showed small
effect sizes on measures of relational aggression, and concluded that
these programs were less effective in addressing relational aggres-
sion than overt aggression. A two-pronged approach would help in
the development of evidence-based treatments for relational ag-
gression. First, studies of existing behavioral treatments for children
with externalizing disorders should include measures of relational
aggression. Second, targeted interventions for this form of aggression
in children with clinically signiﬁcant levels of relational aggression
should be tested in randomized controlled trials.

Treatment of anger and aggression in the context of co-occurring
anxiety and depression poses questions about the sequencing of in-
terventions for primary and secondary symptoms, as well as what
risk factors might contribute to the co-occurrence of externalizing
and internalizing problems. On the one hand, some studies show that
treatment of the primary mood disorder may result in the reduction of
associated behavioral problems ( Jacobs et al. 2010). On the other
hand, disruptive behavior may reduce compliance with psychosocial
interventions for internalizing symptoms and contribute to functional
impairments conferred by the primary diagnoses (Garcia et al. 2010).
Children with elevated symptoms of anxiety/depression demonstrate
greater gains following treatment with parent training (Ollendick
et al. 2015) and CBT for aggressive behavior ( Jarrett et al. 2014). It
has been suggested that a combination of permissive and controlling/
hostile parenting styles may contribute to co-occurring anxiety and
conduct problems (Granic 2014) and parent-focused treatments have
been increasingly used for treatment of anxiety in children (Forehand
et al. 2013). Similar techniques of cognitive restructuring and prob-
lem solving are used within CBT approaches for anxiety/depression
and aggressive behavior, which suggests commonality in the emo-
tion regulation skills that are taught to improve both internalizing and
externalizing disorders.

Relatively little is known about the treatment of conduct problems
in children with callous-unemotional traits (i.e., lack of guilt and
empathy). These traits have been associated with persistent and more
severe forms of antisocial behavior as well as with distinct neuro-
cognitive deﬁcits in reward processing and social perception (Blair
et al. 2015). It has been suggested that reduced sensitivity to nega-
tive consequences in children with conduct disorder complicated by
callous-unemotional traits may reduce the effectiveness of rewards
and discipline-focused components of PMT (Hawes et al. 2014). At
the same time, the increased parental warmth and sensitivity that has
been observed following treatment with PMT (O’Connor et al.
2013), may serve as the critical element of family-based interven-
tions for ameliorating the lack of empathy and shallow affect con-
ferred by the callous-unemotional traits. One study showed that a
6-hour program that included teaching emotion recognition skills
directly to children with high callous-unemotional traits was more
effective than parent training, but the effect size for this difference
was relatively small (Dadds et al. 2012). This suggests that similar

62

and, perhaps, longer treatments that teach emotion recognition and
social problem-solving skills directly to children in combination with
parent-focused interventions that increase parental warmth and the
quality of parent–child interactions may be helpful for children with
callous-unemotional traits. These hypotheses are awaiting investi-
gation in randomized controlled trials.

Conclusions

PMT and CBT have been well studied in randomized controlled
trials in children with disruptive behavior disorders, and studies
involving the transdiagnostic approach to CBT for anger and ag-
gression are currently underway. More work is needed to develop
treatments for other types of aggressive behavior (i.e., relational
aggression) that have been relatively neglected in clinical research.
The role of callous-unemotional traits in response to behavioral
interventions and treatment of irritability in children with anxiety
and mood disorders also warrants further investigation.

Clinical Signiﬁcance

Anger/irritability and aggression are among the most frequent
reasons for mental health referrals in children and adolescents. PMT
is a form of behavioral therapy that aims to ameliorate patterns of
family interactions that produce antecedents and consequences that
maintain the child’s anger and aggression. CBT is another well-
studied psychosocial treatment for anger and aggression in children
and adolescents. During CBT, children learn how to regulate their
frustration, improve their social problem-solving skills, and role-play
assertive behaviors that can be used during conﬂicts instead of ag-
gression. Both PMT and CBT can be offered in the format of time-
limited psychotherapy in outpatient mental health centers.
