Abstract

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a heterogenous condition and variations in its 
presentation may be accounted for by individual differences in personality dimensions. Extant 
treatments for BPD are long-term and intensive; it is possible that prioritizing the personality-
based difficulties that underlie an individual’s symptoms may improve the efficiency of care. This 
manuscript describes the conceptual background for the development of a novel, personality-based 
intervention for BPD (BPD Compass) informed by recent research on personality mechanisms 
maintaining this condition to address gaps left by existing treatments and be maximally efficient 
and disseminable. BPD Compass is a comprehensive, short-term package with a fully modular 
design that allows for personalization (e.g., all skills can be presented in isolation or in any order 
based on pre-treatment assessment). We discuss the theoretical background for its development, an 
overview of the skills included in the treatment, as well as preliminary efficacy data.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a costly and debilitating condition characterized 
by impairment across several areas of functioning (Sansone, 2004). In the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), diagnostic criteria for BPD include 
emotional difficulties (labile affect and intense anger), interpersonal problems (efforts 
to avoid abandonment and unstable relationships), behavioral dysregulation (chronic 
suicidality, self-injury, and other impulsive actions), identity disturbance (unstable self-
image and chronic emptiness), and cognitive symptoms (transient dissociation and paranoia 
in response to stress; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). A categorical 
diagnosis of BPD is assigned when a patient endorses five of nine criteria.

In addition to the categorical approach to diagnosing BPD, DSM-5 also includes a 
multidimensional diagnostic approach called the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders 
(AMPD; APA, 2013). Criterion A of the AMPD involves dimensional assessment of self 
(e.g., identity and self-direction) and interpersonal (e.g., empathy and intimacy) functioning, 
as difficulties in these areas are thought to define the core of personality disorders that 
distinguishes them both from healthy personality and other forms of psychopathology 
(Pincus, 2011). Criterion B involves the assessment of dimensional personality traits, 
organized into five broad domains (i.e., negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, 
disinhibition, and psychoticism). Finally, Criteria C through G represent additional 
considerations when making a mental health diagnosis, including pervasiveness, stability, 
age of onset, discrimination from other mental disorders, and differentiation from the 
effect of substances, developmental state, or sociocultural environment. After establishing 
the presence of Criterion A above a threshold level, BPD is represented as elevations in 
Criterion B dimensions negative affectivity, disinhibition, and antagonism.

The AMPD conceptualization of BPD is similar to other dimensional of models of 
psychopathology. For example, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP; 
Kotov et al., 2017) includes a general psychopathology factor (p) to characterize 
distress and impairment that may overlap with the AMPD’s Criterion A (Widiger et 
al., 2019). Moreover, HiTOP describes six broad spectra (i.e., internalizing, disinhibited 
externalization, antagonistic externalizing, detachment, thought disorder, and somatoform) 
that largely conform to Criterion B dimensions in the AMPD. From a HiTOP perspective, 
BPD is characterized by the internalizing (i.e., negative affectivity) and antagonistic 
externalizing (i.e., antagonism) spectra. Similarly, the dimensions captured in the AMPD’s 
Criterion B are isomorphic with trait domains of five factor model of personality (FFM; 
Costa & McCrae, 1990), a widely used paradigm for understanding individual differences.

The AMPD and Extant Treatments for BPD

Given that the field is moving toward a more dimensional, personality-based understanding 
of BPD (e.g., the ICD-11’s formal adoption of a dimensional system for classifying 
personality disorders), it is important to consider how extant treatments for this condition, 
developed in the context of a categorical diagnostic system, remain relevant in a changing 
nosological landscape. We contend that existing interventions for BPD, in general, focus 
on a single AMPD Criterion B dimension of BPD (i.e., negative affectivity or antagonism). 
These treatments have amassed empirical support for their efficacy in addressing BPD 
(particularly for life-threatening symptoms; Kliem et al., 2010) and, importantly, at the 
group level, they do not appear to outperform each other (Cristea et al., 2017).

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993), perhaps the most well-known 
intervention for BPD, is designed to target emotional difficulties, analogous to the 
AMPD dimension of negative affectivity. Linehan (1993) describes BPD as a disorder 
of emotion dysregulation, characterized by high sensitivity to emotion-provoking stimuli, 
strong emotional responses, and slow return to baseline levels of arousal following a 
trigger. Although Linehan (1993) argues these emotional vulnerabilities are exacerbated by 
environmental factors (e.g., invalidating caregivers), DBT is primarily focused on addressing

emotion dysregulation. DBT teaches patients cognitive-behavioral skills to tolerate 
(i.e., mindfulness, distress tolerance) and change (i.e., emotion regulation, interpersonal 
effectiveness1) emotions and the situations that elicit them. Meta-analytic findings suggest 
that DBT results in decreased suicidal thoughts and behaviors, hospitalizations, and anger 
(Kliem et al., 2010).

On the other hand, several treatments for BPD target relationship difficulties/antagonism 
(i.e., distrust, manipulativeness, oppositional tendencies; Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2012). 
Theorists have suggested that agreeableness, the opposite pole of antagonism, is functionally 
related to attachment styles that result from relationships with parents or other caregivers 
(Young et al., 2003). Specifically, low levels of agreeableness are thought to develop 
from insecure, ambivalent, and/or avoidant attachment styles (Bowlby, 1973) that, in 
adults, manifest as feeling vulnerable in relationships and lead to the seemingly protective 
behaviors that characterize externalizing psychopathology (e.g., acting cruel, isolating 
oneself, or seeking excessive admiration from others; Young et al., 2003). Individuals 
with BPD display high rates of insecure attachment styles (Agrawal et al., 2004), 
justifying the development of relationally-focused interventions for this condition, including 
psychodynamic treatments, such as transference-focused therapy (TFP; Clarkin et al., 2001; 
Kernberg, 1984) and mentalization-based treatment (MBT; Bateman & Fonagy, 2004). 
Additionally, schema-focused therapy (SFT; Young et al., 2003) is a cognitive approach for 
personality disorders that includes techniques to challenge patterns of beliefs and behaviors 
about oneself and others (i.e., disconnection and rejection, impaired autonomy, impaired 
limits, other directedness). There is promising evidence that these interventions lead to 
reduced BPD symptoms and increased attachment security (Cristea et al., 2017; Levy et al., 
2006; Vogt & Norman, 2019).

Limitations of Extant Treatments for BPD

The currently available approaches for treating BPD are typically intensive, long-term, and 
technically sophisticated, requiring extensive training and support for therapists. However, 
BPD is a highly heterogenous condition with 256 possible symptom combinations for any 
given person (APA, 2013). Patients with BPD often present with less severe symptoms (Trull 
et al., 1997), and emerging evidence suggests that shorter courses of care (e.g., systems 
training for emotional predictability and problem solving [STEPPS; Black et al., 2004]; 
good psychiatric management [Gunderson et al., 2018]; internet-based psychoeducation 
[Zanarini et al., 2017]), as well as abbreviated or alternative delivery schemes (i.e., stepped 
care) of existing treatments (Laporte et al., 2018), are efficacious for this population. Given 
long waitlists for specialist care, it may be useful develop treatment approaches that can be 
easily tailored based on severity.

Another limitation of existing treatments for BPD is that they generally focus on either 
emotional difficulties/negative affectivity or attachment insecurity/antagonism. Given the 
variability observed in BPD presentations, idiographic mechanisms likely contribute to 

1Although DBT’s Interpersonal Effectiveness skill module targets interpersonal difficulties, it is largely focused on building 
assertiveness skills that will prevent unnecessary negative emotions in relationships. This module is not explicitly focused on 
addressing past interpersonal experiences that may contribute to mistrust in relationships (i.e., attachment difficulties).

a particular patient’s symptoms (Cardona et al., 2020). For example, if an individual’s 
interpersonal difficulties are most strongly associated with neuroticism (e.g., stressors 
prompting strong emotions and temper outbursts serving to dampen negative affect), 
the treatment approach would be different than if this symptom resulted from high 
levels of antagonism (perhaps conferred through attachment difficulties from early life 
experiences). Of course, these putative mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, so an 
individual patient with BPD can have elevations on multiple personality dimensions. 
Given that extant treatments for BPD typically emphasize either emotional vulnerability/
neuroticism or attachment insecurity/antagonism, these interventions may be incomplete for 
some individuals.

Finally, the AMPD conception of BPD (APA, 2013; Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2012) 
underscores the relevance of disinhibition, and existing treatments for this condition do 
not directly address this trait. Both emotion-based and relational conceptualizations of 
BPD provide explanations for disinhibited, impulsive behaviors (e.g., self-injurious actions, 
substance use, binge eating) that fit within the focus of their respective interventions. For 
example, although Linehan’s (1993) biosocial theory of BPD was updated to include early 
expressions of trait impulsivity (Crowell et al., 2009), DBT focuses on rash actions in 
the context of strong emotions. By promoting more effective emotion regulation, DBT 
purportedly reduces reliance on impulsive behaviors that function to escape unwanted 
affective states. Relational approaches to BPD view impulsive behaviors as occurring in 
interpersonal contexts (Levy, 2005) and suggest that cultivating an increased ability to 
understand the motives of oneself and others (Bateman & Fonagy, 2004) by repairing split-
off object relations (Kernberg et al., 2008) reduces the urge to act on impulses. However, 
relegating impulsive behaviors to emotional and interpersonal contexts fails to account 
for mounting evidence that impulsivity in BPD may result from heritable neural profiles 
associated with impaired response inhibition (van Zutphen et al., 2015) that are independent 
from emotion-generating systems and early childhood experiences. Thus, a comprehensive 
treatment for BPD must include strategies to address trait impulsivity.

Arguments for Personality-Based Treatment Recommendations for BPD

One of the major advantages of personality-based approaches to psychopathology (e.g., 
the AMPD) is that they can provide a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment of the 
features underlying individual patients’ symptoms. These dimensional personality profiles 
can be created for each patient and used by clinicians to craft personalized treatment plans 
targeting the specific mechanisms that maintain symptoms for that individual (Samuel & 
Widiger, 2006). For example, AMPD’s Criterion A level of personality dysfunction may be 
used as an overall severity metric to provide recommendations on the length or intensity 
of treatment. Additionally, if a patient endorses high levels of negative affectivity and 
disinhibition on Criterion B, treatment elements targeting these difficulties can be selected, 
while strategies targeting antagonism can be left out. Thus, assessing BPD with the AMPD 
can produce treatment plans that are comprehensive and efficient. Encouragingly, there is 
evidence that clinicians find that dimensional personality profiles are able to communicate 
important information, are easy to use, and are useful in treatment planning (Widiger & 
Mullins-Sweatt, 2010).

Dimensional models of psychopathology are also useful for understanding co-occurring 
conditions. BPD is characterized by a high degree of comorbidity with other forms of 
psychopathology (Zanarini et al., 1998), with estimates as high as 75% for lifetime 
co-occurrence with anxiety and depressive disorders (Grant et al., 2008) and 50% for 
substance use disorders (Carpenter et al., 2015). People with BPD and comorbid conditions 
respond more poorly to non-BPD focused treatments than those without BPD (e.g., 
Vignarajah & Links, 2009). However, rather than conceptualizing co-occurring disorders 
as discrete, categorical phenomena, comorbid conditions can be regarded as additional 
manifestations of shared underlying mechanisms (Brown & Barlow, 2009). For example, 
in the HiTOP framework (Kotov et al., 2017), a patient with BPD, social anxiety 
disorder, depression, and alcohol use disorder can be conceptualized as displaying both 
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Thus, a personality-based dimensional 
approach to understanding psychopathology provides higher-order treatment targets that 
may simultaneously address comorbid conditions (Barlow et al., 2014; Sauer-Zavala, 
Southward, & Semcho, 2020).

Despite the advantages of personality-based conceptions of psychopathology and treatment, 
these approaches are not currently well integrated in clinical practice. Several authors 
(e.g., Bach & Presnall-Shvorin, 2020; Hopwood, 2018; Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2020) 
have articulated strategies for using personality profiles to select individualized treatment 
approaches; however, we contend that the substance of these recommendations may have 
resulted in unintended barriers. First, the majority of the treatment recommendations 
based on personality features involve matching existing interventions (e.g., interpersonal 
effectiveness in DBT) to particular traits (e.g., antagonism; Hopwood, 2018; Mullins-Sweatt 
et al., 2020). This approach requires that clinicians be trained in a variety of treatment 
protocols to provide comprehensive care, perhaps limiting uptake (McHugh et al., 2009). 
Additionally, treatment recommendations are often made at the facet level (Bach & Presnall-
Shvorin, 2020). In the Five Factor Model, each of the five broad domains of personality 
are composed of six facets, which would yield 30 distinct treatment approaches. Although 
this number of interventions is far fewer than the number of protocols required to address 
each DSM diagnosis, it may still result in significant therapist burden associated with 
learning a large number of treatments. Additionally, it is not clear that the facets organized 
beneath a broad personality domain are functionally distinct, warranting discrete treatment 
approaches. Thus, we argue that a single intervention to address the broad domain level 
of personality provides a balance between comprehensive coverage of transdiagnostic 
personality dimensions, while being practical for therapists to learn and implement.

BPD Compass: A Customizable Treatment for BPD Based on Personality 

Profiles

We (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2020) sought to create a treatment package for BPD that was 
informed by the substantive dimensions (Criteria A and B) of the AMPD. BPD Compass, 
which loosely stands for Cognitive-behavioral Modules for Personality Symptoms, was 
developed to 1) synthesize decades of research on mechanisms maintaining BPD into a 
comprehensive treatment, 2) address gaps left by existing interventions, and 3) be maximally

efficient and disseminable. Incorporating assessment of Criterion A provides a metric of 
overall severity, perhaps allowing clinicians to estimate the number of BPD Compass 
sessions needed to address a given patient’s symptoms (see section on Assessment and 
Personalization) or determine whether an alternative treatment approach is more appropriate. 
Assessment of Criterion B is used to determine which BPD Compass modules will be 
presented; discrete modules were developed to target negative affectivity, antagonism, 
and disinhibition using commonly applied treatment strategies: identification of values, 
techniques to promote cognitive flexibility, behavior change principles (alternative action, 
exposures), and mindfulness training. In the section below, we describe the theory that 
underscores our approach to targeting relevant dimensions of personality, summarize the 
skills and exercises included in BPD Compass, and highlight the treatment gaps this 
intervention addresses. Finally, we describe the strategies we used to increase the likelihood 
that BPD Compass will integrate well with routine practice settings.

How Does BPD Compass Address Empirically Identified Mechanisms Maintaining BPD?

We view the personality dimensions included in Criterion B of the AMPD as a framework 
to integrate decades of theoretical and empirical research on the nature of BPD. Indeed, 
BPD Compass was designed to engage the putative mechanisms associated with negative 
affectivity, antagonism, and disinhibition. We drew from emotion dysregulation (i.e., DBT, 
UP) and attachment insecurity (i.e., TFP, MBT, SFT) perspectives on treating BPD to 
specify the targets in the negative affectivity and antagonism modules, respectively, along 
with adding content specific to disinhibition. Thus, although we are not proposing a 
completely new conceptual framework for understanding this condition, BPD Compass’ 
innovation lies in the way this intervention provides comprehensive coverage of the putative 
mechanisms maintaining BPD symptoms within a single intervention. In the section below, 
we briefly summarize the existing theory that underscores the modules included in our 
treatment. Additionally, when developing and testing a new treatment, it is important 
to confirm that the components included in each module indeed engage hypothesized 
mechanisms. Based on (Kazdin, 2007)’s criteria for determining whether a psychological 
process can serve as a mechanism of action, we have planned to collect empirical support 
to test the mechanistic relations between strategies and targets in BPD Compass; see the 
Research Agenda for BPD Compass section below).

Barlow and colleagues’ functional model of neuroticism (Barlow, Ellard, et al., 2014; 
Barlow, Sauer-Zavala, et al., 2014) posits that aversive reactions to frequently occurring 
negative emotions prompt the use of emotionally avoidant coping strategies (e.g., self-
injurious behaviors, binge eating, substance use) that paradoxically result in more frequent 
and intense negative emotions (i.e., exacerbating and maintaining negative affectivity; Bullis 
et al., 2019). By contrast, sustained decreases in the frequency of negative emotions, 
achieved by targeting aversive/avoidant responses to emotions, may constitute decreases 
in negative affectivity (for a description of what constitutes trait change, see Magidson 
et al., 2014). Transdiagnostic behavioral interventions targeting aversive reactivity have 
been associated with significantly larger decreases in neuroticism than symptom-focused 
protocols (Sauer-Zavala, Fournier, et al., 2020) and improvements in negative affectivity

in transdiagnostic treatments may even predict symptom reduction (Stumpp et al., in 
preparation).

Antagonism, characterized by distrust, manipulativeness, and oppositionality (Mullins-
Sweatt et al., 2012), is associated with strained interpersonal relationships and is a risk factor 
for developing externalizing psychopathology (Anderson et al., 2007; Kotov et al., 2010; 
Miller et al., 2003). Higher levels of antagonism are associated with insecure attachments to 
childhood caregivers, which can manifest in adulthood as behaviors that function to protect 
a person in interpersonal contexts perceived as threatening (Young et al., 2006). Here, 
attachment insecurity represents an actionable functional mechanism linking the personality 
trait of antagonism to externalizing symptoms, akin to the role of aversive reactivity in 
the relation between neuroticism and negative emotions. Emerging research suggests that 
improving patients’ ability to consider others’ perspectives, along with challenging negative 
schemas about oneself and others, improves attachment security in adults (Levy et al., 2006; 
Vogt & Norman, 2019).

Finally, disinhibition, or trait impulsivity, is characterized by sensation-seeking (the 
tendency to seek out novel and thrilling experiences), lack of deliberation (the tendency 
to act without thinking), lack of persistence (an inability to remain focused on a task), 
and urgency (the tendency to act rashly in response to positive and negative emotional 
experiences; Cyders et al., 2007; Whiteside et al., 2005). Roberts and colleagues have 
published several theoretical accounts of how to alter this trait in treatment (Magidson et 
al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2017). They suggest that individuals’ expectancies about their 
performance on certain tasks, along with how much they value these actions, predict 
conscientious behaviors (e.g., paying bills on time, subjugating impulses that would be 
gratifying in the short-term; Eccles, 2009). Others have suggested that trait impulsivity 
is maintained by high reward orientation such that disinhibited individuals will continue 
to pursue rewards (e.g., relief from negative emotions, substance-related highs) despite 
negative consequences (Carver & White, 1994; Gray, 1987). Thus, intervention strategies 
that focus on values, provide immediate (reinforcing) feedback on progress, and engage 
performance expectancies may be particularly useful for this trait (Magidson et al., 2014).

What Skills/Activities Are Included in BPD Compass?

BPD Compass consists of four skill domains applied to the core personality-based 
mechanisms described above (i.e., negative affectivity, antagonism, disinhibition; Table 1). 
These domains include values identification, skills for thinking (i.e., cognitive flexibility), 
skills for doing (i.e., alternative actions, exposure), and skills for being (i.e., mindfulness 
training). What makes our treatment different from the typical provision of these skills is the 
explicit focus on emotion tolerance, trust, and delay of impulsive gratification.

Introduction and case conceptualization.—The initial session is focused on 
psychoeducation about BPD and an overview of treatment content. The therapist first 
reviews symptoms of BPD and any other conditions the patient is experiencing and then 
describes how these difficulties can be explained by three risk factors: attempts to push 
away frequent strong negative emotions, difficulty trusting others, and difficulty resisting the

urges to act impulsively. Patients are asked to reflect on how these three issues manifest 
in their own lives and the therapist explains that treatment will focus on helping them 1) 
tolerate emotions, 2) test the extent to which they can trust others in their lives, and 3) delay 
acting on urges in order to live in accordance with long-term goals. The major theme across 
all modules/skills is that patients often pursue short-term relief (escape from emotions, 
engaging in protective relationship behaviors, engaging in satisfying impulsive actions) that 
limits their ability to live in line with their values. This conceptualization is described in the 
first session and is brought up explicitly in subsequent sessions.

Identifying and Approaching Values.—Next, patients spend at least two sessions 
identifying their values and considering the extent to which they are currently living in 
accordance with them. To identify personal values, patients are provided with a list of 
domains (e.g., family, career, spirituality) and asked to answer prompting questions (e.g., 
what does this domain mean to you, what qualities do you want to embody in this domain). 
These procedures were inspired by acceptance and commitment therapy (Hayes et al., 
1999) and values-based behavioral activation (Hopko et al., 2003). In BPD Compass, 
values identification is conducted at the beginning of treatment to foster the therapist’s 
understanding of the patient beyond their symptoms and create a standard against which 
to evaluate the patient’s behaviors (e.g., “is this action in line with your values?”) to 
motivate change. Specifically, patients are encouraged to consider both the short- and 
long-term effects of their behaviors to reflect on whether they are moving closer to their 
values. Although values identification may involve negative affectivity, antagonism, and 
disinhibition, values-focused work is particularly in line with Magidson’s et al. (2014) 
recommendations for targeting disinhibition.

Skills for Thinking.—Using patients’ values as guiding principles, the cognitive skills 
in BPD Compass are designed to help patients practice flexible thinking around emotion-
provoking situations, maladaptive schemas about relationships, and beliefs about their 
inability to resist impulsive urges. At its core, cognitive flexibility involves identifying 
overly negative, biased, or ineffective thoughts and considering alternative interpretations 
to better evaluate the evidence for these thoughts (Beck et al., 1987). Patients use a 
standard thought record form throughout these sessions to assist in the examination of their 
thoughts, which are subjected to challenging questions as a means to generate alternative 
perspectives. To address intolerance of emotions, specifically, patients are encouraged to 
generate alternative appraisals for thoughts about emotions themselves (e.g., “I always 
overreact” becomes “given my previous experiences in similar situations, it makes sense my 
gut reaction would be strong”).

BPD Compass also incorporates two supplemental activities to address unhelpful thinking 
patterns in relationships and in response to triggers for impulsive actions. With regard to 
thoughts about relationships, patients are asked to examine multiple dimensions of trust 
(e.g., paying back a debt, taking care of a child) for significant others in their lives. 
Drawn from cognitive processing therapy (Resick et al., 2016), this technique is designed to 
challenge all-or-nothing thinking regarding the trustworthiness of other people by asking 
patients to evaluate the degree to which they trust each person in their life on each

dimension. For thoughts about impulses, BPD Compass patients are asked to explore the 
functional origin of their impulsive urges and related thoughts. For example, the functional 
origin of sensation-seeking urges may be the thought that “nothing feels as good as the rush 
I get from sex.” Finally, patients can have an optional overview/wrap-up session to either 
troubleshoot particularly difficult thoughts or practice identifying and challenging core 
beliefs that the patient or therapist may have noticed throughout the prior cognitive-focused 
sessions.

Skills for Doing.—BPD Compass incorporates common principles of behavior change 
by encouraging patients first to identify unhelpful emotional, relationship, and impulsive 
actions and then practice behaviors that bring patients closer to their values. Patients are 
first oriented to the negative reinforcement cycle of unhelpful behaviors (Barlow, 2002). For 
example, although self-injuring during an altercation with a loved one may satisfy the urge 
to reduce intense emotions, it prevents patients from learning that emotions and urges can be 
tolerated and may also lead to poor health and relationship outcomes. Skills for Doing are 
designed to break the cycle of negative reinforcement and facilitate 1) an approach-oriented 
stance towards experiencing emotions, 2) a willingness to feel vulnerable and build trust in 
relationships, and 3) an ability to resist immediately responding to urges. The two primary 
behavioral strategies used are alternative action and exposure. Alternative action refers to 
replacing a current unhelpful behavior with a more adaptive one, whereas exposures are 
used when a patient avoids situations that may elicit strong emotions or urges. Continuing 
with the example above, a patient may practice speaking calmly and actively listening when 
communicating (i.e., alternative action) or initiating a difficult conversation (i.e., exposure) 
with a loved one, rather than engaging in self-injury. Patients use a tracking form to identify 
unhelpful emotional, relationship, and impulsive behaviors and plan specific alternative 
actions and exposure ideas to practice between sessions.

Skills for Being.—BPD Compass also includes mindfulness training to cultivate 
present-focused, non-judgmental attention. Patients practice nonjudgmentally observing 
the thoughts, physical sensations, and behavioral urges that arise in response to emotion-
provoking situations, interpersonal conflicts, and triggers for impulsive actions. This 
is accomplished via three formal meditation exercises focused on each BPD-relevant 
personality dimension. The meditation focused on emotions is adapted from Mindfulness 
Based Cognitive Therapy (Segal et al., 2013) and encourages patients to observe the 
internal experiences that arise naturally, whereas the relationship-focused and urge-focused 
meditations ask patients to bring to mind a recent conflict or triggering stimulus (e.g., a 
party, a specific substance). Beyond the formal meditation, patients practice and track their 
nonjudgmental, present-moment attention in real-time situations. Finally, an optional session 
may be used to deepen or troubleshoot patients’ practice with mindfulness.

Assessment and Personalization.—The delivery of BPD Compass can be 
personalized based on information provided by Criteria A and B of the AMPD. Criterion 
A can be assessed with the Level of Personality Function Scale Brief 2.0 (LPFS; Weekers 
et al., 2019), which provides an overall severity rating of a patient’s self and relationship 
dysfunction. It may be possible to use this information to personalize the length of treatment

with BPD Compass required to observe symptom remission or to determine if a more 
intensive or focused intervention is necessary. Empirical data is needed to determine if the 
LPFS can be used in this manner (see our Research Agenda for BPD Compass Section for 
more information).

Additionally, given that the dimensions included Criterion B are closely related to the FFM, 
a well-established personality paradigm, a range of psychometrically-sound assessment tools 
can be applied (Sleep et al., 2021). For instance, measures assessing the range of normal 
personality (NEO Personality Inventory-3; McCrae et al., 2005; International Personality 
Item Pool; Donnellan et al., 2006; Maples et al., 2014; Big Five Inventory-2 [BFI-2]; Soto 
& John, 2017) range in length from 10 to 300 items, allowing researchers/clinicians to 
choose the level of specificity for their assessment. However, some authors have speculated 
that measures of normal personality do not capture the full range of functioning for those 
with personality disorders (Krueger et al., 2012) and created FFM-based instruments for 
BPD. The Five-Factor Borderline Inventory (Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2012) and its short 
form (DeShong et al., 2016) provide coverage of maladaptive variants of neuroticism, 
agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Finally, although not BPD-specific, the Personality 
Inventory for DSM-5 (Krueger et al., 2012) also captures more extreme presentations of the 
FFM relevant to personality disorders.

Thus, there is a wide pool of instruments that can be used to assess and personalize BPD 
Compass. These instruments can generate personality profiles to identify relative areas 
of elevation (i.e., high antagonism relative to scores on other FFM domains), as well as 
absolute elevations (i.e., high antagonism compared to normative data). These data can then 
be used to select relevant modules from BPD Compass. BPD Compass was developed to 
be fully modular so that skills addressing neuroticism, antagonism, or disinhibition could be 
presented in isolation or in any order to prioritize areas of greatest need. If a patient exhibits 
elevations on all three domains targeted by BPD Compass, we recommend providing 16–18 
sessions (Table 1). However, if a patient only displays clinically relevant elevations in one 
domain, fewer session may be needed.

For an example of FFM profiles using the BFI-2 from our current trial evaluating the 
efficacy of BPD Compass in a sample of individuals meeting DSM-5 criteria for BPD, 
see Figure 1. Case A displays high neuroticism and average levels of agreeableness and 
consciousness, suggesting treatment might prioritize skills for addressing aversive reactions 
to emotions. Case B and Case C demonstrate high neuroticism along with deficits in 
one additional personality dimension, conscientiousness and agreeableness, respectively. 
Finally, Case D exhibits high neuroticism, low agreeableness, and low conscientiousness, 
suggesting the comprehensive approach taken by BPD Compass would be warranted. 
Although it is currently unknown which personality measures provide the most predictive 
utility for selecting BPD Compass modules or whether facet-level scores provide important 
information beyond domain-level scores for personalizing treatment, we are currently 
collecting data to address these questions (see Research Agenda section below).

How Does BPD Compass Address Gaps in the Existing Treatment Options for BPD?

BPD Compass was developed to address patient and provider-level gaps in the current 
treatment offerings for BPD. We view BPD Compass as a complement to existing evidence-
based treatments for this condition. Given that BPD is relatively common in outpatient 
samples and many patients with BPD display less severe symptoms (Goldberg, 2001), we 
contend that many patients with BPD may not require the longer-term, more intensive 
treatments that have amassed the most research support to date. Thus, BPD Compass was 
explicitly developed to be relatively short-term, delivered in its entirety in 16–18 weekly 
sessions (i.e., 4–5 months). Directing patients with less severe symptoms to shorter-term 
interventions delivered by generalist providers may free up space on specialist caseloads 
for those that truly need this level of care (see Laporte et al., 2018 for evidence on 
using stepped care approaches in treatment for BPD). Moreover, because BPD Compass 
is composed of well-known therapeutic strategies (i.e., cognitive flexibility, behavior change/
exposure, mindfulness training) that are frequently trained in graduate programs, we believe 
this approach can be easily integrated into routine practice. In our current trial evaluating 
the efficacy of BPD Compass, most study therapists are graduate students with less than 
one year of clinical experience who have generally been able to competently deliver the 
intervention.

Despite the intended brief duration of BPD Compass, we also view this intervention as a 
comprehensive package that addresses the core personality-based mechanisms implicated 
in the development and maintenance of BPD. Instead of primarily focusing on emotion 
dysregulation or attachment insecurity, BPD Compass contains skills to address neuroticism, 
antagonism, and trait impulsivity (disinhibition). Additionally, BPD Compass is the 
first treatment to our knowledge for this condition that was explicitly designed to be 
customizable based on the mechanistic factors maintaining each patient’s symptoms. As 
described previously, existing FFM questionnaires can be used to determine the personality 
dimensions that characterize individual patients and corresponding BPD Compass modules 
can be applied.

How Was BPD Compass Developed to be Disseminable?

Many people with BPD may have particularly pronounced difficulties accessing care (Lawn 
& McMahon, 2015). For example, in the United Kingdom, BPD has only recently been 
considered a diagnosis that mental health providers are responsible to treat (NICE, 2009). 
When care is available, people with BPD may experience substantial stigma from providers 
(Rogers & Acton, 2012), many of whom refuse to treat patients with BPD (Sulzer, 2015). 
Unfortunately, access to specialist providers with the expertise and inclination to treat BPD 
is limited (Iliakis et al., 2019), and many patients lack the financial resources to afford 
gold-standard, intensive care (Tomko et al., 2014).

Given these barriers to accessing mental healthcare, we contend that any new treatment must 
consider dissemination issues during development. Our goal was to create an intervention 
that 1) could be applied in generalist mental healthcare settings and 2) would be relatively 
easy to train across various professions (e.g., social workers, licensed mental health 
counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists). Although we fully acknowledge that severe forms

of BPD require intensive specialist treatments such as DBT, TFP, SFT, or MBT, there is 
evidence that usual care is still quite beneficial (Finch et al., 2019) when individuals with 
this condition can actually receive it. Thus, we designed BPD Compass to be delivered 
in weekly, 50-minute outpatient sessions in line with typical service delivery models. 
Additionally, both patient-level factors (e.g., difficulty affording treatment; Tomko et al., 
2014) and system-level factors (e.g., long waitlists) underscore the need for efficient, yet 
flexible treatments (Southward et al., 2020). Although a full course of BPD Compass lasts 
16–18 sessions, it could be completed in as few as 9 sessions for patients with dysfunction 
in only one personality dimension (though it is an empirical question whether this brief 
of treatment would be sufficient). This flexibility makes BPD Compass ideally suited to a 
stepped care approach to BPD (Laporte et al., 2018).

Another important consideration for maximizing widespread dissemination of an 
intervention is the burden placed on clinicians to deliver it. BPD Compass is a manualized 
cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) with a patient workbook (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2020) 
and therapist guide (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2021). By providing clear guidance on the 
application of this treatment for clinicians in a familiar format (i.e., workbook chapters 
corresponding to session-by-session material), any mental health provider that is inclined to 
work through BPD Compass with their patients will be able to more quickly learn and apply 
it. Although we do offer consultation/training services, we explicitly view these offerings as 
enriching one’s practice, rather than necessary to provide the treatment. Finally, we elected 
to use a cognitive-behavioral approach given that CBT is reported as the primary theoretical 
orientation by most providers in typical mental health service settings (Wolitzky-Taylor et 
al., 2019) and most training programs for clinical psychology focus on developing student 
competencies in delivering CBT (Heatherington et al., 2012). Although we believe that 
adopting a manualized, CBT approach increases the disseminablility of BPD Compass, it 
is important to note that the eclectic use of other theoretical orientations is not precluded; 
indeed, psychodynamic or interpersonal techniques that use the patient’s relationship with 
their therapist as a vehicle for new learning can be integrated within structured CBT 
exercises (Westen, 2000). Overall, by making it clear that BPD can be successfully treated in 
generalist settings, stigma associated with this condition may be diminished.

What is Our Research Agenda for BPD Compass?

We are currently evaluating the efficacy for BPD Compass with an RCT in which patients 
are assigned to receive this treatment immediately upon enrollment in the study or following 
an 18-week delay (clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT04587518); all study procedures are 
approved by our local institutional review board. This design allows us to compare BPD 
Compass to waitlist; however, because all participants eventually receive the intervention, 
we will collapse the immediate and delayed treatment conditions to increase our power for 
within-group analyses. Given that this study represents the first evaluation of this novel 
intervention, we elected to deliver all skills/mechanistic modules to all participants rather 
than personalizing delivery based on pre-treatment assessment.

To date, we have enrolled 37 patients (14 assigned to immediate treatment and 15 assigned 
to delayed treatment) out of our projected N of 50 individuals. Patients are included if

they meet DSM-5 criteria for BPD (assessed via clinician administration of the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders; First et al., 1997), agree to refrain 
from concurrent behavioral treatment, and agree to remain on a stable dose of psychotropic 
medication. Exclusion criteria are based solely on the well-being of participants and include 
difficulties that would warrant the prioritization of alternative care: 1) uncontrolled bipolar I 
disorder or psychotic/delusional symptoms (i.e., a manic episode or delusions/hallucinations 
in the past 12 months), 2) acute suicidal intent requiring immediate hospitalization, and 
3) an untreated substance use disorder that would be better addressed with supervised 
detoxification and or medication management. Of note, our recruitment materials did 
not mention acute suicidal intent as a rule out. Of the 59 individuals that completed a 
study intake, none were excluded for acute suicidality, although many endorsed ideation. 
This sample composition is in line with epidemiological data suggesting that 80–97% of 
individuals with BPD are not actively suicidal (i.e., did not attempt suicide in the past year; 
Grilo & Udo, 2021; Yen et al., 2021), underscoring the need for treatments focused on 
less-severe individuals.

Given that there have been several theoretical accounts of how to directly treat the 
personality-based domains included in dimensional models of psychopathology (AMPD, 
HiTOP; e.g., Bach & Presnall-Shvorin, 2020; Hopwood, 2018; Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2020), 
we wanted to include preliminary efficacy data to demonstrate the utility of a personality-
based approach to BPD. Nine patients assigned have completed a full course of care 
with BPD Compass. Outcome data for each individual can be viewed in Table 2. Six of 
nine patients demonstrated statistically significant improvements in BPD symptoms and 
depressive symptoms, and six of nine patients demonstrated change in anxiety symptoms in 
the expected direction. This initial review of patient improvement on our trial is consistent 
with novel treatment development recommendations (Barlow et al., 2008). If the first cases 
treated with a newly developed intervention do not demonstrate the anticipated effect, 
treatment can be refined before substantial resources are used for a large-scale trial. The 
pattern of results demonstrated by the first nine BPD Compass treatment completers 
suggests that this intervention has promise as a short-term intervention for BPD and 
commonly co-occurring symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression).

Given that BPD Compass was developed to address personality dimensions related to BPD, 
we also plan to examine whether these dimensions and their putative mechanistic processes 
(i.e., aversive reactivity to emotions, attachment insecurity, goal-pursuit expectancies), 
change over the course of treatment. Kazdin (2007) has proposed five criteria for 
determining whether a psychological process can serve as a mechanism of change: 1) 
finding a strong association between the mechanism of action and the outcome, 2) 
establishing temporal precedence where change in the mechanism of action precedes 
changes in the outcome, 3) manipulating the levels of the mechanisms to determine how 
they relate to outcomes; 4) identifying a dose-response relationship where greater change in 
a mechanism of action leads to better outcomes, and 5) replicating findings. The design of 
our trial will allow us to test Kazdin’s first, second, and fourth criteria. Specifically, we are 
conducting weekly repeated measurement of BPD symptoms, relevant personality domains, 
and intermediary mechanisms.

Finally, because we are currently testing BPD Compass in its entirety, we will be unable 
to determine whether skills associated with a particular personality domain uniquely engage 
their intended target. Thus, our immediate next step will be to conduct a component analyses 
of BPD Compass in which skills associated with each higher-order personality trait will 
be presented in isolation to determine if they result in improvement on these dimensions. 
Additionally, given that the delivery of BPD Compass modules can be personalized, it 
will also be important to compare trajectories of improvement across patients who receive 
tailored modules of BPD Compass versus those who are treated with the standard, full 
protocol. Another area for future research is to determine whether the AMPD’s Criterion A 
can be used to predict a dose response to BPD Compass or whether it can indicate whether a 
more intensive treatment is warranted.

Conclusions.

The purpose of this manuscript is to provide the conceptual background for a novel, 
short-term intervention for BPD that maps on to Criteria A and B of the AMPD. BPD 
Compass was developed to incorporate recent research on dimensional models of personality 
pathology into a comprehensive, yet customizable, treatment protocol. This intervention 
includes components to address negative affectivity, antagonism, and disinhibition, and was 
conceived to be fully modular such that pre-treatment personality profiles can be used to 
personalize the selection of modules presented. BPD Compass was developed explicitly 
as a short-term option for addressing BPD that can complement existing, higher-intensity 
interventions. Preliminary patient data suggests that BPD Compass is a promising approach 
to addressing BPD and commonly co-occurring conditions, warranting continued empirical 
study.
