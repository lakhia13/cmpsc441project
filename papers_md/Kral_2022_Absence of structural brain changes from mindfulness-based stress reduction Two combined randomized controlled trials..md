Studies purporting to show changes in brain structure following the popular, 8-week mindfulness-based stress 
reduction (MBSR) course are widely referenced despite major methodological limitations. Here, we present findings 
from  a  large,  combined  dataset  of  two,  three-arm  randomized  controlled  trials  with  active  and  waitlist  (WL) 
control groups. Meditation-naïve participants (n = 218) completed structural magnetic resonance imaging scans 
during two visits: baseline and postintervention period. After baseline, participants were randomly assigned to 
WL (n = 70), an 8-week MBSR program (n = 75), or a validated, matched active control (n = 73). We assessed changes 
in gray matter volume, gray matter density, and cortical thickness. In the largest and most rigorously controlled 
study  to  date,  we  failed  to  replicate  prior  findings  and  found  no  evidence  that  MBSR  produced  neuroplastic 
changes compared to either control group, either at the whole-brain level or in regions of interest drawn from 
prior MBSR studies.

INTRODUCTION
Research on mindfulness-based interventions has increased in re-
sponse to a growing interest in alternative treatments for reducing 
stress and improving well-being. Findings from a few small studies 
have permeated popular media with the notion that a few weeks of 
training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can lead to 
measurable  changes  in  brain  structure  (1,  2)  and  have  been  cited 
over 3200 times, combined. However, there is a lack of replication 
(conceptual or direct) or confirmatory analysis of these findings in 
a fully randomized trial. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis found 
that  the  proportion  of  high-quality  publications  in  this  domain 
have not improved over time, although there are a growing number 
of high-quality studies being conducted (3).

MBSR  is  a  popular,  manualized  mindfulness  intervention  that 
was originally developed for use in clinical settings to improve 
patients’  ability  to  cope  with  pain  (4).  MBSR  is  efficacious  for 
ameliorating symptoms of multiple psychopathologies (5) and for 
reducing  stress  (6).  Studies  have  begun  elucidating  cognitive  and 
neural mechanisms underlying mindfulness training-related changes 
in  affect  (7,  8),  cognition  (9,  10),  and  pain  (11,  12),  among  other 
processes. Studies have also examined whether mindfulness medi-
tation practice leads to changes in brain structure, as described in 
a  meta-analysis  (13),  in  light  of  numerous  studies  demonstrating 
changes in brain structure following behavioral training in other 
domains (14–16). However, only three studies included in the

meta-analysis assessed changes specifically following training with 
MBSR. Most of the included studies focused on cross-sectional 
research  of  long-term  meditation  practitioners  from  a  variety  of 
meditation  traditions,  who  may  have  preexisting  differences  rela-
tive to nonmeditators and idiosyncratic lifestyle factors associated 
with engaging in long duration meditation practice and meditation 
retreats. Conversely, MBSR is a standardized, manualized interven-
tion in which participants receive similar training over an 8-week 
period, where pre-post design research can control for individual 
differences at baseline. Thus, we focus the current investigation 
specifically on the effects of MBSR. Prior research has reported that 
participants  who  completed  MBSR  had  increased  gray  matter 
density (GMD) in the hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), 
temporoparietal junction (TPJ), cerebellum, and brainstem (17) 
and increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the left caudate (18). 
While prior research on MBSR lacked measures of cortical thickness 
(CT), research on meditation more broadly has reported regional 
increases in CT, including in the insula (12). More recent studies of 
the impact of short-term mindfulness meditation training on brain 
structure have consisted of pilot trials, with fewer than 15 partici-
pants and no control group (19).

Prior studies on MBSR-related changes in brain structure have 
marked  limitations.  These  include  a  lack  of  active  control  groups 
and randomization, reliance on circular analysis (20), and small 
sample  sizes—methodological  limitations  that  are  prevalent  in 
meditation research more broadly (21). The current study aimed to 
address  these  limitations  by  integrating  a  waitlist  (WL)  and  a 
well-matched active control group with larger sample sizes (i.e., a 
minimum  of  70  participants  per  group),  in  a  set  of  two  rigorous, 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with pre-post designs from which 
we created a combined dataset. In this way, we were able to test for 
structural changes that were specific to mindfulness meditation 
training, rather than nonspecific effects associated with well-being 
interventions  more  generally.  Recent  literature  also  stresses  the 
need  for  replication  (22,  23)  and  the  risk  of  false  positives  with

were pooled from two trials, rather than a strict replication of past 
work, and thus provides a conceptual replication to test the veracity 
of prior claims of the generalizability of structural brain changes 
with MBSR training. An exact replication would require the use 
of older, outmoded analysis pipelines and different recruiting 
procedures. We elected to conduct a conceptual replication that 
incorporated the most rigorous current design features and analytic 
methods.

Prior research used varied measures to gauge structural neuro-
plasticity,  including  GMV,  GMD,  and/or  CT. GMV  provides  a 
measure of the size of a region of interest (ROI) in cubic millimeters, 
whereas GMD indicates the concentration of gray matter within an 
ROI (or within each voxel). CT indicates the thickness of the corti-
cal sheet between the white matter and pial surfaces and thus is not 
available for subcortical regions. All three measures can be estimated 
with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Surface-based analysis can 
also be used to calculate GMV and CT using information derived 
from geometric models of the cortical surface. Growth in any of 
these measures putatively reflects the same underlying processes, 
including  synaptogenesis  and  gliogenesis  (25).  However,  some 
prior research has found that surface-based analysis was most effec-
tive (e.g., with higher sensitivity and lower variability) for subcortical 
volume  estimation  (i.e.,  in  measurement  of  error-prone  regions) 
(26) and provided the best estimates for change over time in longi-
tudinal models (27). Therefore, we used a surface-based analysis 
pipeline for the present study, although we subsequently reprocessed 
the data using VBM methods as well, for sensitivity analysis (see the 
Supplementary Materials).

Changes  in  brain  structure  in  association  with  mindfulness 
meditation  training  would  provide  evidence  of  structural  neuro-
plasticity  and  may  elucidate  potential  mechanisms  underlying 
benefits of mindfulness meditation. In prior work, hippocampus 
and insula were selected as ROIs a priori, because of their role in 
emotion control and awareness (respectively), their activation during 
meditative states, and prior associations with long-term meditation 
training  and  increased  GMV  in  these  regions  (13).  The  insula, 
amygdala,  and  anterior  cingulate  contribute  to  the  salience  net-
work, which is associated with emotional reactivity and subjective 
awareness processes that are hypothesized to change with mindful-
ness training (28,  29). PCC and TPJ are major nodes within the 
default mode network, which is implicated in self-referential thought 
and mind-wandering (30, 31), that have been shown to change with 
mindfulness training (32). Given the evidence for mindfulness- 
related changes in function and psychological processes associated 
with  these  brain  regions  (33–35),  structural  changes  in  gray 
matter might also be expected. Prior research provides evidence for 
mindfulness-related changes in brain structure in the default mode 
and salience networks, among other regions (13, 17, 18).

We attempted to conceptually replicate prior findings of increased 
GMD following MBSR in the hippocampus, PCC, TPJ, cerebellum, 
and brainstem and increased GMV in the caudate, as a subcom-
ponent of a larger study that aimed to examine the impact of MBSR 
on sleep, cognition, emotion, and well-being. Because the current 
study included much broader aims than a straightforward replica-
tion, we used a more modern and sensitive processing and analysis 
strategy compared to the prior studies. In addition, we included 
results for alternative pipelines that were more consistent with 
prior work as sensitivity analysis (i.e., using VBM in addition to 

surface-based analysis). In addition to the aforementioned regions, 
we also assessed structural changes in the amygdala and insula, as 
these regions are involved in affective processing that may change 
with mindfulness training (7, 8). While prior research did not find 
associations between structural changes and amount of MBSR prac-
tice time, we tested for such associations, given the broader range of 
MBSR practice time in the current study relative to prior work (17). 
We hypothesized that MBSR practice time would be associated with 
increased GMV, GMD, and CT in all ROIs except amygdala, where 
we expected an inverse relationship between size and practice time, 
given the inverse relationship between MBSR-related reductions in 
amygdala GMD and stress in prior research (36). Thus, the current 
research sought to conceptually replicate and extend the literature 
on structural neuroplasticity associated with short-term mindfulness 
meditation practice in MBSR.

RESULTS
All results (from both whole-brain and ROI analysis) are consistent 
regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of participants who attended 
less than six MBSR classes (n = 2) or participants who practiced for 
less than 2 hours outside of class (n = 6), including when we add an 
additional covariate to control for the time between scans. We also 
confirmed that there were no significant differences between groups 
at baseline.

Whole-brain analysis
There  were  no  significant  group  differences  for  change  in  brain 
structure (GMV, GMD, or CT) for MBSR compared to the Health 
Enhancement Program (HEP) active control group, or the WL con-
trol group, in the whole-brain analysis (including when controlling 
for the timing between scans). This is consistent with a prior whole-
brain analysis of GMV conducted with sample one (37). Significant 
within-group increases in CT were present for MBSR in the left 
lingual gyrus, for HEP in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus, and 
for  WL  in  the  bilateral  precuneus  and  the  right  superior  parietal 
cortex. The WL group also had a significant increase in the left 
rostral middle frontal gyrus volume. See table S1 for detailed cluster 
information. There were no significant interactions between MBSR 
and  HEP  practice  time  and  change  in  GMV  in  the  whole-brain 
analysis. Unthresholded statistical maps are available at NeuroVault 
(https://neurovault.org/collections/7634/) (38).

ROI analysis
There  were  no  significant  group  differences  for  change  in  brain 
structure for MBSR compared to HEP or WL for any of the ROIs 
(P  >  0.10)  (including  when  controlling  for  the  timing  between 
scans). The nonsignificant result for right amygdala is depicted in 
Fig. 1A. See table S2 for results of statistical tests of change in GMV 
for  all  ROIs.  Results  are  consistent  regardless  of  the  inclusion  or 
exclusion of influential outliers. Nonsignificant results of sensitivity 
analysis using multiple imputation to account for missing data, as 
well as analysis of GMD from SPM12 and GMV from SPM-CAT12, 
are presented in tables S4 to S9. We also completed a small volume–
corrected, voxel/vertex-wise analysis of the four anatomically defined 
ROIs (insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and caudate), as in prior 
work (17), and found no significant group differences for change in 
GMV. Last, there were no significant within-group changes in brain 
structure across time (P > 0.05).

baseline (T1) to postintervention period (T2). (B) MBSR practice time was associated with reduced right amygdala GMV significantly more than practice in the HEP active 
control. (C) FreeSurfer anatomical label from aseg for right amygdala (in green). Error envelopes represent 1 SE above and below the point estimates of the means, the 
dependent variables are adjusted for covariates (i.e., age, gender, sample, and total brain GMV), and adjusted data points are overlaid.

MBSR practice time
MBSR participants practiced at home an average of 32 hours (SD, 
20 hours; range, 2 to 85 hours), and HEP participants practiced at 
home an average of 56 hours (SD, 33 hours; range, 7 to 255 hours). 
MBSR participants attended 8.14 of 9 possible classes, on average 
(range, 4 to 9 classes), and HEP participants attended 8.44 of 9 possible 
classes,  on  average  (range,  2  to  9  classes).  Significant  effects  of 
MBSR practice time were limited to the amygdala, and relationships 
with  the  other  eight  ROIs  were  nonsignificant  (P  >  0.05).  MBSR 
practice  time  was  associated  with  reduction  in  right  amygdala 
volume  significantly  more  than  HEP  practice  [t(128)  =  −3.30, 
P = 0.001, P* = 0.01, P2 = 0.08; Fig. 1B]. See table S3 for results of 
all statistical tests examining the impact of practice time on change 
in GMV. However, the group by practice time interaction was trend 
level  or  nonsignificant  in  the  sensitivity  analyses  (see  tables  S5, 
S7, and S9).

Mindfulness
We  examined  self-reported  mindfulness  based  on  the  Five  Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) to gauge the effectiveness of the 
MBSR intervention. A prior study reported on the results for sample 
one, whereby MBSR was associated with increased mindfulness 
(P < 0.05, within-group) that marginally differed from WL (P = 0.09) 
but  did  not  differ  from  HEP  (P  =  0.33)  (39).  When  collapsing 
across  both  studies,  results  were  consistent  with  the  prior  report, 
whereby MBSR differed significantly from WL [t(208) = −2.70, P = 0.01], 
but not from HEP [t(208) = −1.01, P = 0.31, P2 = 0.05]. Across both 
samples,  mindfulness  increased  following  MBSR  [t(70)  =  3.86, 
P < 0.001, P2 = 0.18] and HEP [t(65) = 3.39, P = 0.001, P2 = 0.15].

DISCUSSION
The current study sought to conceptually replicate and extend the 
significance of prior work demonstrating increased GMD following 
mindfulness  meditation  training  in  the  hippocampus,  posterior 
cingulate, cerebellum, brainstem, and TPJ (17) and increased GMV 
in the caudate (18). We combined two datasets to yield sample sizes 
of 70 or more participants per group. Both datasets were collected 
with the same rigorous methods and three-arm RCT design, using 
MBSR, a well-matched active control (HEP), and a WL control. We 
expected to find increased GMD following short-term MBSR training 
in the hippocampus, caudate, TPJ, and PCC and reduced volume 
for the amygdala, in line with prior work. We also hypothesized that 
these effects would be larger for participants who spent more time 
practicing  mindfulness  meditation.  We  failed  to  find  any  group 
differences in GMV, GMD, or CT in support of these hypotheses.

It is unlikely that the failure to detect structural brain changes 
following MBSR was due to ineffective training. The MBSR inter-
vention was effective regarding expected changes in neural function 
and connectivity, as well as psychological and cognitive outcomes: 
MBSR  reduced  amygdala  reactivity  and  increased  amygdala– 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity to emotional 
stimuli in sample one (8), increased PCC resting functional connec-
tivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in sample two (35), and 
increased self-reported mindfulness [reported in (39) for sample 
one, in addition to the results presented here]. The active control 
intervention, HEP, also increased self-reported mindfulness, and 
MBSR participants did not differ significantly from HEP on this 
measure.  The  current  study  lends  evidence  that  MBSR-related 
improvements in self-reported mindfulness may not be specific to

mindfulness meditation practice but rather related to other aspects 
of the course that are common to similar interventions [e.g., bene-
fits from learning well-being skills from experts in HEP; for an 
in-depth discussion, see (40)]. Participants in the current study 
were at least as engaged with the MBSR coursework as in the prior 
research,  if  not  more  engaged,  based  on  the  time  they  reported 
practicing meditation at home (which ranged from 2 to 85 hours 
with a mean of 32 hours in the current study, compared to a range 
of 7 to 42 hours and a mean of 23 hours in prior work) (36).

Despite the lack of group differences in change in regional brain 
structure, we observed a significant interaction of group (MBSR 
versus  HEP)  and  practice  time  on  change  in  right  amygdala 
GMV. The more time participants spent practicing MBSR outside 
of class, the larger their reduction in right amygdala volume following 
the intervention compared to practice with HEP, the active control 
intervention. On average, participants with less than 27 hours of 
total MBSR practice time had no change in amygdala volume, and 
the lower bound of the confidence interval at this point was 20 hours 
of total MBSR practice time (or an average of about 22 min/day). 
Therefore, practicing mindfulness meditation for less than 22 min/day 
for a few months is unlikely to lead to structural change in the 
amygdala. In addition, changes in the early stages of mindfulness 
meditation training, such as during MBSR training in previously 
untrained individuals, may be different from the changes in later stages 
or for longer interventions. Along these lines, a recent, well-powered 
study assessing meditation training similar to mindfulness medi-
tation, but with a 50% longer duration than MBSR, found significant 
increases in CT relative to two active control interventions in prefrontal 
cortex extending to anterior cingulate and in bilateral occipital cortex 
extending to inferior temporal cortex (41). While the current study 

thus  provides  initial  evidence  that  MBSR-related  reductions  in 
amygdala volume may depend on the degree of engagement with 
practice, the effect was small and failed to survive the sensitivity 
analyses. Thus, it should be interpreted with caution and warrants 
attempts to replicate in future work.

The results of the current study failed to support the hypothesis 
that short-term training in mindfulness meditation is associated 
with significant group differences in change in regional brain struc-
ture compared to a well-matched active control intervention or a 
WL control group in an adequately powered, rigorous RCT design. 
Despite previous research suggesting that short-term mindfulness 
meditation training affects the structure of the brain, results of the 
present study failed to detect these group differences. While this 
highlights the importance of conceptual replications, it also raises 
new questions and highlights limitations of conceptual replications 
relative to direct replications. There were important differences 
between the current study and prior work, including the populations 
from  which  participants  were  drawn  and  differences  in  the  study 
design and methods. Prior work recruited participants who elected 
to participate in an MBSR course (17, 18) and were thus not ran-
domly assigned, while the current study used a rigorous RCT design. 
The participants in prior studies may have had more “room for 
improvement,” because they sought out a course for stress reduction, 
with some samples recruited specifically on the basis of the presence 
of high stress in participants the month before study participation 
(17). In contrast, the current set of RCTs used a relatively long list of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, including exclusion for use of psycho-
tropic medication or psychiatric diagnosis in the past year, resulting 
in unusually healthy samples with, e.g., very low levels (or absence) 
of baseline anxiety and negative affect. While the RCT design used

here provides the most rigorous experimental control, this increased 
rigor likely comes at the expense of ecological validity—the simple 
act of choosing to enroll in MBSR may be associated with increased 
benefit.

It is notable that the current study also had sample sizes over 
three times that of prior work (e.g., n = 75 MBSR participants in our 
final sample compared to n = 20 or less participants per group in 
prior work) (17, 18). Given the low sample sizes of prior work and 
the larger samples and lack of replication in the current study, there 
is a possibility that prior results suffered from inflated effect sizes 
and  low  positive  predictive  value  (24).  For  example,  we  found 
medium effect sizes (ranging from Cohen’s d = 0.39 to d = 0.43) 
for  the  significant  group  differences  between  MBSR  and  WL  in 
self-reported mindfulness (from pre- to postintervention), whereas 
the  prior  research  found  large  effect  sizes  (ranging  from  Cohen’s 
d = 0.77 to d = 1.48) (17, 18). Moreover, the very small magnitude of 
standard effect size estimates for the nonsignificant group differences 
in change in regional GMV in the current study can be interpreted 
as “no effect” (e.g., partial 2 = 0.01 for the difference between 
MBSR and HEP for change in the left hippocampus GMV). These 
null effects, in conjunction with our large sample size and rigorous 
matched comparison condition, allow us to conclude that MBSR 
does not differentially affect brain structure.

Various forms of psychopathology have been associated with 
alterations in brain structure (42). In addition, exposure to trauma 
has also been associated with structural alterations in the brain (43). 
It  is  this  body  of  work  that  initially  led  investigators  including 
ourselves to hypothesize that MBSR, an intervention that has been 

found to elevate well-being, may also alter the structure of the brain 
in a direction opposite to that found in psychopathology and trauma.
Alterations in brain structure are present after other types of 
training,  including  aerobic  exercise  and  balance  training  (14,  15). 
The latter study entailed a 12-week intervention, along a similar 
time scale as the current study. These forms of training involved 
specific, repetitive actions within a physical domain. Conversely, 
MBSR  training  spans  varied  meditative  and  educational  practices 
across multiple psychological domains (e.g., attention, compassion, 
and emotion). MBSR also requires higher-order cognitive skills that 
engage a complex, distributed network of brain regions relative to 
work in other domains. If MBSR induced structural neuroplasticity, 
then it would likely occur in a similarly distributed pattern and with 
potentially higher interindividual spatial variability relative to training 
that  involves  a  more  localized  brain  region  (e.g.,  balance  training 
and vestibular cortex) (15). Detecting MBSR-induced changes in 
brain structure may thus be difficult. Moreover, variation in the 
location of brain activation with MBSR practice may preclude the 
repetitive, localized activation theorized to underlie training-induced 
structural neuroplasticity (16). MBSR is similar to other types of 
meditation training in that practitioners are often taught a range of 
different methods, each addressing somewhat different aspects 
of well-being. While such training may be optimally effective in 
producing psychological change, because of its multifaceted nature, 
it is unlikely to induce discrete focal changes in brain structure. It 
may  be  that  only  with  much  longer  duration  of  training  and/or 
training explicitly focused on a single form of practice, that struc-
tural alterations will be identified.

As more research is conducted on this topic, the importance 
of  reporting  results  of  conceptual  and  direct  replication  attempts 
should  be  emphasized  considering  known  publication  bias  for 
positive findings (44). Likewise, it is important for future research 
to  examine  individual  differences  in  engagement  and  efficacy  of 
MBSR, as well as the optimum length and duration of daily practice 
for a mindfulness meditation intervention to confer benefits. The 
lack  of  significant  group  differences  between  MBSR  and  control 
groups  in  the  current  study  suggests  that  interventions  lasting 
longer  than  the  standard  8-week  MBSR  course  and/or  singularly 
focused  on  one  specific  meditation  practice  might  be  required  to 
produce changes in brain structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design
The present study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and combined 
data across two clinical trials (NCT01057368 and NCT02157766), 
which started approximately 5 years apart. Baseline data collection 
(T1) for sample 1 occurred between February 2010 and May 2011, 
and data collection following the intervention period (T2) occurred 
between June 2010 and October 2011. For sample 2, baseline data 
(T1) collection occurred between November 2014 and March 2017, 
and data collection following the intervention period (T2) occurred 
between March 2015 and July 2017. While the average time between 
scans (T1 to T2) ranged from 62 to 238 days (mean, 120.6 days; 
SD, 28.0 days), most of this time gap was due to a lag between the T1 
scan  and  the  start  of  the  intervention  period.  We  prioritized 
scanning participants as close to the end of the intervention as possible 
for T2, to capture potential intervention-related changes. Thus, the 
average  time  between  the  last  day  of  the  intervention  and  the  T2

scan was 19.4 days for MBSR participants (SD, 11.7 days; range, 1 to 
46 days) and 15.6 days for controls (SD, 13.4 days; range, 0 to 93 days). 
Results are consistent with those reported when a covariate is 
included to control for the time between scans. The experimental 
design was comparable across both datasets (see figs. S1 and S2 for 
the CONSORT diagrams from each trial). Both clinical trials ended 
upon completion.

Participants
Data were combined for meditation-naïve participants (MNPs) 
from sample 1 (n = 124; average age, 48.1 ± 10.7 years; 79 female) 
and sample 2 (n = 139; average age, 44.1 ± 12.7 years; 82 female). 
Sample size for each dataset was determined with a power analysis. 
We recruited healthy human participants within the Madison, WI, 
community using flyers, online advertisements, and advertisements 
in local media for a study of “health and well-being” or the “benefits 

of health wellness classes.” Participants were included if they were 
adults between 18 and 65 years old with no prior training or formal 
practice  in  meditation  or  mind-body  techniques  (e.g.,  Tai  chi)  or 
expertise in physical activity, music, or nutrition. Participants were 
excluded from enrollment if they had used psychotropic or nervous 
system  altering  medication,  a  current  diagnosis  of  sleep  disor-
der, a psychiatric diagnosis in the past year, any history of bipolar 
or schizophrenic disorders, history of brain damage or seizures, or 
a medical condition that would affect the participants ability to safely 
participate in study procedures. There were no differences in socio-
economic status between MBSR and either control group based on 
the Hollingshead index (P > 0.10) (45).

Following baseline data collection, participants were randomized 
to one of three groups using a stratified block assignment procedure to 
ensure age- and gender-balanced groups: MBSR (n = 90; average age, 
46.6 ± 11.8 years; 53 female), WL (n = 84; average age, 46.0 ± 11.7 years;

age, 45.4 ± 12.5 years; 55 female), which has been validated in a 
separate study in which the intervention procedures are described in 
further detail (46). (See Table 1 for detailed demographic information 
for each group.) All study staff, except the participant coordinator 
and project manager (and their undergraduate assistants), were blind 
to group assignment. Blinded group indicators were used, and only 
the participant coordinator had access to the key.

Six participants were excluded because of brain abnormalities, and 
two participants were missing structural data because of technical 
difficulties, resulting in 256 participants (average age, 45.7 ± 12.0 years; 
156 female) with baseline (T1) structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) data. Eighteen participants withdrew before T2 data collec-
tion (eight MBSR, one HEP, and nine WL), 13 participants were 
excluded because they failed to attend a minimum of two classes for 
the assigned intervention (nine HEP and four MBSR), and 7 partici-
pants were missing T2 structural MRI data because of technical 
difficulties, resulting in 75 MBSR (average age, 47.3 ± 11.9 years; 
43 female), 73 HEP (average age, 46.0 ± 12.7 years; 43 female), and 
70 WL (average age, 46.8 ± 11.6 years; 46 female) participants with 
T2 structural MRI data.

The MBSR courses were delivered by experienced and certified 
MBSR instructors and consisted of practices and teachings aimed 
at  increasing  mindfulness,  including  yoga,  meditation,  and  body 
awareness. The HEP course served as an active control, which was 
matched to MBSR and consisted of exercise, music therapy, and 
nutrition education and practices. The intervention and randomiza-
tion procedures were identical to those detailed by MacCoon et al. 
(46). MBSR and HEP participants recorded logs of the minutes they 
spent each day on the respective practices at home (i.e., outside of 
class), which were summed to calculate a variable for total minutes 
of practice for each participant (except those in the WL group). 
Classes for both interventions (MBSR and HEP) were taught through 
the Integrative Health program at the University of Wisconsin 
School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, WI.

Data collection
Participants completed a baseline data collection visit before ran-
domization and a second visit following the 8-week intervention 
period. Both visits took place at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain 
Imaging and Behavior at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. 
The  second  sample  of  MNP  also  completed  a  third,  long-term 
follow-up  session  approximately  6  months  after  the  second  visit 
that was not included in the current analysis. At each visit, partici-
pants attended a 24-hour laboratory session that included an MRI 
scan and the FFMQ (47), among other measures as part of a larger 
multisession, multiproject study. We examined the FFMQ to gauge 
the efficacy of MBSR for improving mindfulness, given its use in the 
prior studies that we attempt to replicate here (17) and despite its 
apparent limitations (21, 39, 47). Experimenters were blind to the 
group assignment during data collection. University of Wisconsin–
Madison’s Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved the 
study (protocol numbers H-2009-0017 and 2014-0116), and all 
participants provided consent and were given monetary compensa-
tion for their participation.

consisted of a high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted 
inversion recovery fast gradient echo image (inversion time, 450 ms; 
in-plane resolution, 256 by 256; field of view, 256 mm; axial slices, 
124 mm by 1.0 mm). Anatomical images for sample two were 
acquired on the same scanner using a 32-channel head coil with the 
same scan sequence, except with axial slices of 192 mm by 1.0 mm.

Image processing
Image processing was conducted in FreeSurfer using the automated 
longitudinal pipeline (stable release version 6.0), which included skull 
stripping, registration, intensity normalization, Talairach trans-
formation, tissue segmentation, and surface tessellation (48, 49). 
Hand edits were conducted to correct errors in the automated pro-
cessing, primarily to the base, and, if needed, to the subsequently 
generated longitudinal images. Manual edits in the base included 
editing the Talairach registration, wm.mgz, and brainmask.mgz 
volumes. Edits to the Talairach registration occurred when the ini-
tial registration was a poor fit to the participant brain. In both the 
base and longitudinal phases, control points were added to correct 
intensity normalization errors and white matter omissions. In addi-
tion, if the white and pial surfaces did not follow white and gray 
matter boundaries, then voxel edits were made on the wm.mgz and 
brainmask.mgz volumes, respectively. Images were resampled to 
fsaverage space using the FreeSurfer program mris_preproc, and 
difference maps were generated for each participant (T2-T1) using 
the “paired-diff” option. The resulting difference maps were then smoothed 
to 8-mm full width at half maximum with mri_surf2surf and used 
as inputs for subsequent group analysis.

FreeSurfer’s automated brain segmentation tool (aseg) was used 
to extract measures of GMV from subcortical regions (see Fig. 1C 
for depiction of the right amygdala ROI), and the Desikan-Killiany 
atlas was used to extract GMV for the insula (50). A mask of clusters 
with  significant  change  in  MBSR  participants  was  provided  by 
Hölzel  et  al.  (17),  which  was  registered  to  individual  participant 
space using the FreeSurfer command mri_label2vol using transfor-
mation matrices generated for each participant with the FreeSurfer 
command mni152reg. The resultant TPJ and PCC and two cerebel-
lar masks (depicted in the MNI152 template space in Fig. 2) were 
then used to extract GMV measures for each participant using the 
FreeSurfer program mris_segstats. We masked each of these cortical 
ROIs to exclude white matter based on each participant white mat-
ter segmentation, as generated in the FreeSurfer processing pipeline 
with the program recon-all. The significance of results does not 
change using the original ROIs, without additional masking.

We also completed sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation 
for ROI analyses and with data processed using Statistical Parametric 
Mapping  (SPM)  software  to  verify  that  the  absence  of  significant 
results was not due to differences in software or the specific struc-
tural measures used (e.g., GMV versus GMD). Details for multiple 
imputation and SPM pipelines are available in the Supplementary 
Materials and included both standard SPM12 and SPM12 Compu-
tational  Anatomy  Toolbox  (CAT12)  longitudinal  pipelines,  the 
latter being calibrated to detect smaller changes in brain structure 
than earlier software. Full results of sensitivity analysis are presented 
in tables S4 to S9.

Image acquisition
Anatomical images for sample one were acquired on a GE X750-3.0 
Tesla MRI scanner device with an eight-channel head coil and 

Statistical analysis—Voxel-wise
Whole-brain analysis was performed on GMV and CT difference 
maps (T2-T1) using the FreeSurfer program mri_glmfit with a

or WL) with covariates to control for age, gender, total (whole-brain) 
GMV, and sample. The FreeSurfer program mri_glmfit-sim was 
then used to correct for multiple comparisons with Z Monte Carlo 
simulation (voxel/vertex-wise threshold, P < 0.001; cluster-forming 
threshold, P < 0.05), including an additional correction to control 
for comparisons across the two hemispheres (51). Analysis of the 
effect of home practice included an additional regressor with total 
home practice minutes and modeled a contrast for the interaction 
of group × practice. Small volume–corrected analyses were also 
conducted for the anatomical ROIs using FreeSurfer for the insula 
cortical ROI and the Wake Forest University PickAtlas in SPM for 
subcortical ROIs (amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus) (52, 53).

Statistical analysis—ROI
All ROI analyses (with the exception of voxel-wise analysis) were 
performed using the lm function in R statistics software (54), and 
P value computation used the modelSummary function of the 
lmSupport package (55). The GMV difference (T2-T1) for each 
ROI was regressed (separately) on group with covariates to con-
trol for participant age, gender, sample (i.e., 1 versus 2), and total 
whole-brain GMV. Analysis of the impact of home practice time on 
GMV included the addition of total home practice minutes and its 
interaction with group. Outliers were identified on the basis of 
Cook’s D using a cutoff threshold of 4/(N − P), where N and P cor-
respond to the sample size and number of model parameters, 
respectively, and removed from analysis. The number of outliers 
per group ranged from two to eight for MBSR, from three to six for 
HEP, and from one to six for WL. We used a false discovery rate 
correction to control for multiple comparisons across all 12 ROIs 
using the p.adjust function. Corrected P values are indicated by 
P* in the Results. A summary of descriptive statistics for average GMV 
for all ROIs is presented in Table 2, and the results of all statistical 
tests are presented in tables S2 to S9.
