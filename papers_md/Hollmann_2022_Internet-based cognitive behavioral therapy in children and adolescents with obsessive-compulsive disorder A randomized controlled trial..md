(OCD)

Objectives: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
in childhood and
adolescence often leads to signiﬁcant impairment in various areas of life
and has a high risk of becoming chronic. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment, but it is too rarely implemented in
accordance with guidelines and is often not available close to the patient’s
home. Importantly, internet-based CBT could help to reduce this gap in care.
Having previously successfully demonstrated the feasibility of an internet-
based CBT approach, we aimed to assess its effectiveness in a waiting list
controlled randomized trial.

Methods: Children and adolescents aged 6–18 years with a principal diagnosis
of OCD received 14 sessions of therapist-delivered CBT via videoconference
distributed over 16 weeks. After
inclusion, participants were randomly
assigned to either the treatment or waiting list group. Participants in the
treatment group began treatment immediately after baseline diagnostics,
and participants in the waiting list group began treatment after a 16-week
waiting period. The primary outcome was a pre-post comparison of OCD
symptoms as measured with the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
Scale (CY-BOCS). Additionally, remission was an important outcome measure.
Follow-up assessments were conducted for all measures 16 and 32 weeks
after completion of treatment.

Results: A total of 60 children and adolescents were included into the
analyses. Over the course of the treatment, OCD symptoms according to
the CY-BOCS signiﬁcantly decreased in the treatment group compared to
the waiting-list control group. Cohen’s d between groups was 1.63. After
the patients in the waiting list group also received the treatment, the OCD

symptoms decreased signiﬁcantly in this group as well. This improvement of
symptoms increased over the course of the follow-up assessments. Remission
rate peaked at the 32-week follow-up, with 68% in the treatment group and
79% in the waiting list group. Importantly, patient satisfaction with treatment
was high to very high.

Conclusion:
In our study, OCD symptoms decreased signiﬁcantly and
remission rate was high after internet-based CBT. Those effects were
comparable to those found in studies of face-to-face treatment. Although
further evidence is needed, these are early indications that our approach may
be a viable way to provide access to adequate treatment for children and
adolescents affected by OCD.

Introduction

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in childhood and
adolescence is common with a prevalence of 1–3% (1–3). OCD
characteristics are intrusive thoughts, urges, doubts, impulses
and images that impose themselves on the individual against
their will and cause strong unpleasant feelings, such as anxiety,
discomfort, or distress. To reduce these feelings, patients with
OCD frequently perform ritualized and repetitive actions that
take up a large amount of time. Without adequate treatment,
the course of OCD is usually chronic, and OCD symptoms may
persist into adulthood (4, 5). OCD is associated with signiﬁcant
impairments in various areas of life (e.g., school, leisure time,
friends, and family) (6), frequently resulting in a reduced level of
psychosocial functioning (7). In addition, OCD has a high rate
of comorbidity with other mental illnesses (8–10), contributing
to the complexity of the disorder and its treatment.

Various studies (11, 12) have shown that starting treatment
as soon as possible after the initial manifestation of OCD is
important to avoid a chronic course. For this reason, it is vital
that the disease is diagnosed early and that interventions are
initiated according to the guidelines. The treatment of choice
for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and it should
include exposure exercises with response prevention (E/RP) as
a core element (13, 14). In terms of reducing OCD symptoms,
meta-analyses demonstrate between-group eﬀect sizes (ES) for
CBT of 1.20 (15) and higher (ES = 1.45) (16). It is recommended
that the exercises are conducted accompanied by therapists and
in the places where the OCD symptoms occur most frequently
(13). In cases of severe OCD and signiﬁcant impairment, a
combined treatment of CBT and medication with Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) should be considered (13).
Treatment with medication alone should only be used when
psychological treatment is declined by children or adolescents
with OCD and their families, or they are unable to engage in
treatment (14).

Despite the clear evidence base for CBT, many patients are
not treated with it, and even when they are, E/RPs are too

rarely used (17). The main reasons for this are structural (lack

of availability of CBT, especially in rural areas) (18), on the
part of the treatment providers themselves (lack of experience
and associated uncertainty in the implementation of E/RPs)
(19, 20), and practical (considerable time and organizational
eﬀort to implement E/RPs) (19, 20). The latter is especially true
for the therapeutic accompaniment of E/RPs in the patient’s
home environment.

Internet-based psychotherapy could help overcome at
least some of these barriers in several ways. First, it would

is conceivable that an
internet-based approach could lower the inhibition threshold
for seeking help, especially for patients who, due to their
OCD, cannot leave their home environment or can do so
only with considerable diﬃculty. Therapists would have the
opportunity to accompany their patients via video conference
during exposure exercises in the respective trigger situations
at home, signiﬁcantly reducing the high organizational and
time costs
internet-based
psychotherapy via videoconferencing could lead to a more
frequent application of E/RP in the home context, which are
accompanied therapeutically. This could further improve the
treatment eﬃcacy.
Recently,

pandemic highlighted the importance of expanding access to

with the assistance of videoconferencing. In Germany, where
our trial was conducted, the technical and legal framework
was created in 2019 to allow video-based therapy and further
technology-based interventions to be used in standard care
(24, 25). Consequently, this increase in the digitalization of
psychotherapy expanded the range of available therapies, and
the basis for this expansion is the growth in existing evidence
for internet-based therapy approaches.

pediatric OCD, which, on a preliminary level, can be divided
into internet-based (e.g., videoconferencing, mail, chat, online
programs) and non-internet-based (e.g., telephone) CBT. In
addition, the CBT approaches diﬀer concerning their scope,
whether there is contact with a therapist, and whether the
therapy is conducted synchronously in time between therapist
and patient. Video-based approaches allow exposure exercises
to be accompanied by the psychotherapist
in the home
environment in real time on the screen. Two studies with
children and adolescents have been conducted in this regard
(26, 27). From these, initial indications of eﬀectiveness have
emerged. However, these need to be conﬁrmed and extended, as
the total number of patients studied is still quite small (n = 53).
In addition, some of the results refer to a subpopulation (4–8-
year-olds) (26). Of the more representative sample in terms of
age, the stability of eﬀects was measured only in a part (n = 14)
and this only over the relatively short period of 3 months.

As a basis for this kind of treatment, an existing therapy
manual (29) was transformed into a version that could be
used online. In addition, various technical elements and devices
were combined to an extent that went beyond the previous
use of technology in studies on childhood and adolescent
OCD. Speciﬁcally, ambulatory assessment was essential; using
a smartphone application, patients and parents provided daily
feedback on OCD symptomatology, mood, the involvement of
other family members in the performance of the rituals and
avoidance behavior, and other stressors (e.g., daily hassles).
Another element of the treatment was the use of an online
data cloud system where the therapy materials were made
available to patients and their parents. Overall, the feasibility
study showed that our approach worked well and was accepted
by both patients and their parents. In addition, there was a
“high” to “very high” level of satisfaction with the treatment,
and a reduction in OCD symptoms was achieved. From the
therapists‘ perspective, the accompaniment of E/RPs in the
home environment was highlighted as very positive. Finally, the
therapist rated the ambulatory assessment as very helpful as it
provided a good overview of the patient’s progress during the
week and allowed him to address speciﬁc events in more detail
during the sessions.

As the overall innovative concept was found to be feasible
and was well accepted by the families, the eﬀectiveness of
the approach will be examined in the current study. The
results to date of video-based approaches for pediatric OCD,
although promising, are aﬀected by the limitations described
above. Evidence that such an approach is eﬀective in typical
children and adolescents with OCD remains,
in our view,
inconclusive. Further initial evidence is warranted. We therefore
decided to use a randomized controlled trial with a waiting list
control group design. The treatment consisted of 14 therapy
sessions via videoconference, distributed over 16 weeks. Our
primary hypothesis was that OCD symptoms, measured with
the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-
BOCS), would decline more in the group that begins treatment
immediately after enrollment in the study than during the
same period in the waiting list control group. In addition,
we hypothesized that, after the waiting list control group
also received treatment, their OCD symptoms would decrease
signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, we expected the treatment success to
be maintained beyond the end of therapy, as assessed using two
follow-up measurements conducted in both groups at 16 and
32 weeks after treatment completion.

Participants

The participants were recruited primarily through the OCD
outpatient clinic in Tübingen, which is located in the south
of Germany. Recruitment support came from colleagues of
an OCD outpatient clinic in Cologne, located approximately
400 km away from Tübingen in western Germany. The
colleagues there made potential participants aware of the study
and recommended contacting the clinic in Tübingen. The core
element of participant recruitment was a campaign conducted
in collaboration with the Department of Communication of the
University Hospital Tübingen using Google AdWords. When
the relevant search terms were entered, information about the
study was shown, and families could access the landing page
via a link. Information about the study was also provided on
the homepage of the German Society for OCD. Furthermore,
brochures about the study were sent to schools nearby, as well
as to child and adolescent psychiatrists and psychotherapists
in Tübingen.

Eligible participants were children and adolescents between
the ages of 6–18 years with a primary diagnosis of OCD
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), a Children’s Yale-Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of ≥ 16,
daily access to a broadband internet connection, a at least
one legal guardian, especially a parent who was able to

participate in the study, and the ability to read and write
in German. Participants with psychiatric comorbidities were
included if the comorbid disorder did not have a higher
treatment priority than OCD; participants taking a psychotropic
medication could also be included if the medication had been at
a stable dose for the 6 weeks prior to the baseline assessment.
When children and adolescents were enrolled in the study,
parents were speciﬁcally told that drug treatment status must
remain unchanged.

Participants were excluded if they had an IQ below 70, a
psychiatric comorbidity that required initial treatment, such as
anorexia nervosa with massive underweight, suicidal ideation,
or such a degree of severity of OCD symptoms that the
indication for full inpatient treatment existed. This was the case,
for example, when school attendance was no longer possible. In
addition, participants were excluded if they had a substance use
disorder or if their family was psychologically distressed to the
point that participation in the sessions and care of their children
during the study was not possible. No other psychological
treatment was allowed during participation in the study.

Autism spectrum disorder was not considered an exclusion
criterion for the study as long as the OCD symptoms were
clearly in the focus at the time of the screening/baseline
assessment and the aﬀected subjects were able to express a clear
desire for change in relation to these symptoms.

After the families had contacted the study team by mail or
telephone, an appointment was made with them for a telephone
screening. The aim was to clarify to the extent possible whether
the inclusion criteria were fulﬁlled and whether there were
indications of the presence of exclusion criteria. In addition,
the families received information about the treatment in the
study and study design. Both the children and adolescents and
at least one legal guardian/parent participated in this screening,
which was conducted by a licensed psychotherapist. In the
event of potential eligibility, the children and adolescents and
at least one guardian were invited to the clinic in Tübingen for
a detailed assessment. This initially consisted of an interview
with a licensed psychotherapist, in which the focus was on
an in-depth exploration of OCD symptoms, their impact on
family life, and the ﬁnal clariﬁcation of the children’s and
adolescents’ motivation for therapy. In addition, the families
were given the opportunity to clarify any unanswered questions
they had regarding study design and CBT for OCD. All children,
adolescents and guardians provided written informed consent
to participate during this appointment. If no clear indications
of fulﬁlled exclusion criteria emerged in the interview, another
licensed psychotherapist, whose role in the study was solely to
conduct the diagnostic assessment, took over and conducted
baseline measurements with the children, adolescents and
legal guardians/parents (see sections Primary and Secondary
outcome measures - Clinician-rated). To avoid overtaxing the
children and adolescents, this frequently occurred on a separate
appointment. In addition, children and adolescents as well as

parents completed various clinical questionnaires (see section
secondary outcome measures—child- and parent-rated). If the
inclusion criteria were fully met, random assignment to one of
the two conditions was made. Subsequently, participants and
their parents were informed of inclusion and group membership
by the psychotherapist who had conducted the interview. Before
the ﬁrst therapy session, another appointment was held during
which participants and parents received an introduction to the
use of the technical equipment (a.o. tablet with videoconference
program, smartphone with ambulatory assessment application,
data cloud) by a research assistant.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire assessment
was conducted via videoconferencing beginning in the spring
of 2020. Informed consent forms and questionnaires were
exchanged by mail between families and the study team.

The participants were able to discontinue treatment at
any time if side eﬀects occurred or at their request and were
subsequently assisted in identifying another treatment option.

Randomization and masking

The randomization list was developed by our Institute
of Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry (IKEaB) and
originally consisted of eight blocks of six participants each. The
allocation ratio between the treatment and waiting list groups
was 1:1, and stratiﬁcation did not occur. Several participants
dropped out, almost exclusively during the waiting period from
the control group. To prevent the sample size of the waiting
list group from falling below 20, two additional blocks of six
subjects each were created, increasing the number of included
participants to 60. The allocation ratio remained unchanged at
1:1. The randomization list was kept in an opaque envelope in
a locked cabinet. After inclusion in the study, the participants
received a participant number according to the order of their
detailed assessment, which was used to indicate which group
they had been assigned to in the list. Feedback regarding which
of the two groups the participants had been assigned to was
given to them by one of the psychotherapists from the study
team. The diagnosticians were blinded to group membership
at all data collection points and did not have access to the
randomization list. The families were repeatedly reminded by
the study team that they were not allowed to provide any
information regarding their group membership during the
diagnostic procedure.

Interventions

Participants in both groups received 14 sessions of CBT via
videoconferencing. We decided to schedule 16 weeks for this,
as we had learned in our feasibility study that it is not always
possible to conduct one therapy session per week due to external

circumstances such as ﬂu-like infection of the participant. Each
therapy session was scheduled to last up to 90 min. Once again,
the treatment guide we developed speciﬁcally for internet-based
CBT was used, which is based on the CBT manual by Wewetzer
and Wewetzer, (29) and used successfully in a previous pilot
study. The core elements of this guide are therapeutically
supervised exposures with response management, cognitive
interventions, and family-centered interventions.

Similar to traditional CBT treatment for OCD, our internet-
based CBT consisted of
four phases. Phase I (session 1)
included the establishment of a therapeutic relationship and
psychoeducation on the topic of compulsions. This also
included the creation of an explanatory model. Phase II
(sessions 2–4) taught participants how exposures with response
prevention work and prepared them for this. Other key
content included creating distance from the content of the
obsessions, initial cognitive interventions, and ﬁrst steps to
reduce the extent of involvement of other family members in
the compulsions. The central elements of Phase III (sessions
5–12) were the implementation of E/RPs (part of each session
from session 5 onward), in addition to cognitive interventions
and family-centered interventions. The exposure exercises
were supervised therapeutically on screen and subsequently
performed independently by the participants several times
between sessions. Finally, Phase IV (sessions 13–14) focused on
relapse prevention.

The treatment providers were licensed psychotherapists
with several years of professional experience and expertise in
OCD in childhood and adolescence. They received supervision
from the therapeutic head of study during weekly team
meetings. The head of study was a licensed psychotherapist
with a high level of expertise and practical experience in
the treatment of children and adolescents with OCD due to
several years of leading the special outpatient clinic for pediatric
OCD. In addition, he is co-author of the German-language
guideline for OCD.

All

the therapy materials were stored in a password
protected data cloud in separate folders for participants
and parents. Another component of the treatment was the
information that participants and parents submitted separately
on a daily basis via the application. This information was
related to OCD symptomatology and the resulting impairments
in daily life, avoidance behaviors, mood, and daily stresses.
In addition, via the application, the participants kept a log
of the progress of their independently performed E/RPs, and
the therapists had access to this data and could use it when
preparing for the next session. For this purpose, the families
received a smartphone secured by software so that only access to
study-speciﬁc applications was possible. Furthermore, another
application was used that connected the smartphone to a
physiological wristband. Using this application, subjects were
asked to set timestamps for various events (e.g., the start and
end of E/RP, the time of going to bed and waking up).

Technical equipment

All the families were provided with a smartphone and a
tablet, both of which had been preconﬁgured by our department.
The therapy sessions were conducted via videoconference using
the program Vidyo R(cid:13). We used the secured data cloud of our
hospital for the storage of therapy materials. Physiological data
were measured using the AS97 physiology wristband from
Beurer, which recorded heart rate, activity level in the form
of movement, and sleep quality data. The aim was to collect
information regarding physical signs of stress, especially during
E/RPs in children and adolescents with OCD. We aim to report
on the analysis of these data in a separate article.

Measurements

Primary outcome measure—Clinician-rated

The primary outcome measure was

the CY-BOCS,
considered the gold standard for the diagnostic assessment
of OCD in children and adolescents (30). This is a semi-
structured, clinician-administered interview that evaluates the
severity of obsessions and compulsions across ﬁve dimensions
(time occupied by symptoms, interference, distress, resistance
and degree of control over symptoms). The total score is
calculated using 10 items, with a maximum possible score of
40 points. The cut-oﬀ value for identifying clinically relevant
obsessive-compulsive symptomatology is ≥ 16 points. Internal
consistency was good for the Obsession and Compulsion
Severity Scores (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80 and 0.82), and the
Total Score (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90) (31). This also applies
to the Test-retest stability for the Obsession and Compulsion
Severity Scores (ICC = 0.70 and 0.76), and the Total Score
(ICC = 0.79) (31). The intraclass correlations for the CY-BOCS
Total, Obsession, and Compulsion Severity scores were 0.84,
0.91, and 0.66, respectively, suggesting good to excellent
interrater agreement (32). The Clinical Global Impressions
(CGI) (33) are ratings used by the clinician to rate the severity of
psychopathology (CGI-Severity) on a scale of 1 (no symptoms)
to 7 (extremely severe) and the change after treatment compared
to the baseline (CGI-Improvement) on a scale ranging from
1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). At r = 0.58,
there is a substantial relationship between obsessive-compulsive
symptom severity scores (measured via the CY-BOCS) and the
global OCD syndrome severity (measured via the CGI–Severity
scale) (34).

Secondary outcome measures—Clinician-rated
The Schedule for Aﬀective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-
PL), is a semi-structured, clinician administered interview that
assesses a range of psychopathology in children and adolescents.
Interrater agreement in scoring screens and diagnoses was high

(range: 93–100%) (35). The Children’s Global Assessment Scale
(CGAS) allows a clinician to assess participants’ overall level of
functional strain. The rating ranges from 0 to 100, with higher
values indicating a better level of social function. The inter-
rater reliability was 0.84, and the test-retest reliability at 0.85
(36). Finally, the Basic Intelligence Test Scale 2-Revised (CFT 20-
R) is a speech-free measure of ﬂuid intelligence. Psychometric
results revealed a good retest-reliability (r = 0.80–0.82) and high
internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.95) (37).

time points, all

At all measurement

clinician-rated
measures were performed by diagnosticians blinded to group
membership. All diagnosticians were licensed psychotherapists,
had performed all outcome measures prior to the start of the
study, and were experienced in their use.

Secondary outcome measures—Child- and
parent-rated

The Child Obsessive–Compulsive Impact Scale—Revised
(COIS-R) is a self-report and parent-report questionnaire
designed to assess the impact of OCD symptoms on the
psychosocial functioning of children and adolescents in home,
social, and academic environments. Reliability was excellent for
the parent-report total score (ICC = 0.81). The youth-report
form yielded similar test–retest reliability for the total score
(ICC = 0.89) (38).

The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders
(SCARED) is a self- and parent-report questionnaire that
assesses symptoms of panic disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder,
separation anxiety disorder, and social anxiety
disorder, in addition it assesses symptoms related to school
phobia. For the total score and each of the ﬁve factors in the
child and parent versions, the authors report good internal
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.74–0.93), good test-retest
reliability (intraclass correlation coeﬃcients = 0.70–0.90), and
moderate parent-child agreement (r = 0.20–0.47) (39).

The Depression Inventory for Children and Adolescents
(DIKJ) assess emotional distress. Considering the diagnostic
criteria of the DSM-5, the degree of depressive impairment was
assessed with the help of 26 items. The internal consistency was
high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92) (40).

The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4–18), which is a
parent-report scale, measures a wide range of child behavioral
and emotional problems, as well as the Youth Self Report
(YSR/11–18), which is a self-report scale for children and
adolescents. For both measures, the internal consistency for the
total score was Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93. The correlation between
parent and child total scores was r = 0.33 in a clinical norm
sample (41).

The Questionnaire for the Measurement of Health-Related
Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (KINDL) is available
in a child- and a parent-report version (42). The subscales are
physical well-being, emotional well-being, self-esteem, family,
friends, and everyday functioning. These can be summed to

obtain a total score. Psychometric results revealed a high
degree of reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.70 for most of
the subscales). The Ulm Quality of Life Inventory for Parents

ill children. The instrument contains the dimensions physical

Cronbach’s alpha for the subscales = 0.75–0.88;
global scale = 0.91. Retest reliability was between 0.69 and
0.86 (43).

Measurements of satisfaction, feasibility, and
implementation

to assess

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) was
completed at post-treatment
the participant’s
perceptions of the value of the services received (44). The
questionnaire consists of eight items answered on a four-
point Likert scale ranging from one to four. The total score
ranges from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating more
satisfaction. The internal consistency was found to be 0.93
(45). We developed our own Final Therapy Evaluation
Questionnaire based on relevant research as a measure of
treatment evaluation (46, 47) for the child,
the parents,
and the therapist. Each item was rated on a four-point
Likert scale,
including the response options “I agree,” “I
somewhat agree,” “I somewhat disagree,” and “I disagree.” This
questionnaire covered questions regarding satisfaction with
the therapy and aspects of implementation, such as adherence
(intervention was delivered as intended—answered only by the
therapist), quality (how well diﬀerent program components
were conducted), and program diﬀerentiation (unique features
of the program).

The Summary Therapist Feedback Form (STFF) was
conducted after treatment, with responses provided on a seven-
point Likert scale ranging from “Not at all” to “Somewhat” to
“Very much” in response options. This feedback form focused
on therapists’ feedback regarding the user-friendliness of the
therapy materials, the comprehensibility, the practicability of
the treatment manual, and whether all essential treatment
elements were included in the manual (44).

Adverse events

Sample size

Existing studies were consulted for guidance on eﬀect sizes,
based on comparisons of CY-BOCS total scores. In a CBT for
children and adolescents conducted via webcam (27), the eﬀect
size between treatment group (n = 16) and waiting list group
(n = 15) for the treatment eﬀect was d = 1.36. The eﬀects in
decreased CY-BOCS scores remained stable at 3-month follow
up assessment. Another study on pediatric OCD (48), which
compared a face-to-face exposure treatment (n = 10) with a
waiting list group (n = 10) yielded an eﬀect size of d = 1.23
between these two conditions at post-treatment assessment. The
changes remained stable during the follow-up period, which
averaged 14 weeks. In our feasibility study (28), in which we had
used the same approach as in this RCT, the eﬀect size pre-post-
treatment was d = 2.02 at N = 9. We therefore knew that our
approach was very likely to lead to symptom reduction.
Power calculations should take into account

the
planned analysis of treatment eﬀectiveness in this study will
be a mixed ANOVA with group as the between-subject factor
(treatment group; waiting list group) and time as the within-
subject factor (t0 = baseline; t1 = end of treatment/end of
waiting period). The interaction eﬀect group × time was
particularly important for the treatment evaluation and should
therefore have had enough power. Another consideration was
that the sample should be large enough to allow secondary
analyses in follow-up analyses on individual courses and
subgroup eﬀects, and to obtain suﬃcient data in follow-up
assessments. Regarding potential drop-outs, we were guided
by another technology-based study, in which the follow-up
duration was 12 months (49). Already at 6-month follow-
up, up to 30% of the participants no longer participated in
the assessments.

that

Assuming a large eﬀect size (η2 = 0.15), an alpha-error of
p = 0.05, and a 1-beta-error of 0.8, the total sample size was
estimated by 48 (i.e., 24 per group). The goal was to have at
least 20 participants per group at the end of treatment in both
groups (t2). According to drop-outs during the waiting period
(9 of eligible 24 participants) and to prevent the sample size of
the waiting list group from falling below 20 and to gain enough
data for the follow-up assessments, it was necessary in the course
of the study to increase the number of included participants to
60 (n = 30 in each group).

In each therapy session,

the therapists obtained an
impression of the general emotional state of the participants and
the extent of their OCD symptoms. If there were indications of
a deterioration, contact was immediately made with the head of
the study to discuss the further procedure and, if necessary, to
initiate action (e.g., inpatient admission). If the situation was not
acute, it was discussed at the weekly team meeting. If there was
any uncertainty regarding the urgency, the head of study could
be contacted at any time.

Data processing and statistical analysis

The data were analyzed using R (Version 4.0.0) and IBM
SPSS Statistics (Version 27). All randomized participants were
included in the analyses,
in accordance with intention-to-
treat principles (50). For various reasons, results were not
available for all participants for all measurement time points.

Both data sets (original and imputed data) were analyzed in
the below mentioned manner. Importantly, regardless of which
of the two data sets was used, there were no diﬀerences in
the results regarding the eﬀectiveness of the treatment and the
stability of the treatment eﬀects.

Presented are the analyses of the imputed data. An overview
of the original primary and secondary outcome measures can be
found in Appendix Table A1.

Diﬀerences between the two groups at t0 were calculated
using t-tests and chi-square tests. If necessary, the degrees of

Analyses were done in two steps for interval scaled
measures. In the ﬁrst step, the eﬀectiveness of the treatment was
assessed. Mixed ANOVAs with group as the between-subjects
factor (treatment group; waiting list group) and time as the
within-subjects factor (t0 = baseline assessment; t1 = end of
treatment/end of the waiting period) were calculated.

In a second step, the stability of the treatment eﬀects found
in the ﬁrst step were examined. Mixed ANOVAs were calculated
with group as the between-subjects factor (treatment group;
waiting list group) and time as the within-subjects factor (post-
treatment, follow-up I, follow-up II). To establish a calculation
basis for the comparison of the two groups with regard to
the follow-up values after completion of the treatment, the
results for all primary and secondary outcome measures were
combined in the SPSS matrix into three variables per outcome
measure. For example, the CY-BOCS scores from measurement
time point t1 for the treatment group and measurement time
point t2 for the waiting list group formed the variable “CY-BOCS
post-treatment,” the scores of t2 for the treatment group and
those of t3 for the waitlist group formed “CY-BOCS Follow-Up
I,” and the values at t3 for the treatment group and t4 for the
waiting list group formed “CY-BOCS Follow-Up II.”

To further analyze signiﬁcant results of the ANOVAS
two-sided t-tests were conducted. For measures that were
strongly hypothesis-driven (CY-BOCS, CGI-I) the alpha level
was 0.05. For all others, it was set to 0.001, to reduce the risk
of an alpha error.

Eﬀect sizes (ES) were estimated for CY-BOCS total scores
using Cohen’s d. These were calculated both between groups at
measurement point t1 and within groups for the comparison of

pre-treatment and post-treatment. If the standard deviations of
the compared CY-BOCS means weren’t equal, pooled standard
deviations where used.

Participants were classiﬁed as responders if they had at
least a 35% reduction in total CY-BOCS scores compared with
baseline measurements (t0) and if they had a CGI-Improvement
value of 1 or 2. Remission was deﬁned as a CY-BOCS total score
of 12 or less and a CGI-Severity value of 1 or 2 after treatment
was completed (53).

As all participants received the same treatment, there was no
analysis by group in terms of the measurements of feasibility,
acceptance, and implementation. For the CSQ-8, means and
standard deviations were calculated across all participants, both
for the individual items and the total score. For the STFF, means
and standard deviations were calculated across all therapists
for each item. The responses to the Final Therapy Evaluation
Questionnaire were considered separately for participants and
parents, and the frequency of agreement with the statements was
determined as a percentage.

Results

Sample characteristics and study ﬂow

Figure 1 displays the participant ﬂow. A total of 236
families were screened for eligibility between January 2019 and
November 2020.

60 children and adolescents in total were enrolled in the
study and randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of the
two conditions, making each group a total of 30 participants. In
the treatment group, two participants dropped out of the study
before beginning the intervention. The remaining 28 subjects
began and all completed treatment. In the waiting list group,
nine participants dropped out by the end of the waiting period,
leaving the remaining 21 participants to begin treatment. During
treatment, 2 subjects dropped out of the study, so it was still
completed by 19 participants in the waiting group.

Data from all 60 participants at each measurement time
point were included in the analysis of the original data, if
available, even if they had not received or completed treatment.
As shown in Figure 1, the number of participants who attended
post-treatment follow-up visits varied.

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the sample.
The two groups did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly concerning any
demographic or clinical variables, except for the mothers’
educational level. In the treatment group, the proportion of
mothers with an academic degree was signiﬁcantly higher than
in the waiting list group. Of the participants, 60% were male
(n = 36), and the mean age of all participants was 13.54 years
(SD = 2.76). The average distance between the families’
homes and the study center in Tübingen was M = 171.9 km
(SD = 151.5), and the median was Mdn = 132.0 km.

The
participants had experienced obsessive-compulsive
symptomatology for an average of M = 31.03 months
(SD = 30.76), and the median was Mdn = 20.00 months.
At baseline assessment, 71.7% (n = 43) of the participants were
diagnosed with at least one comorbid mental disorder. Overall,
31 participants (52%) had previously received psychological
treatment, 22 had been treated with a psychotherapy other
than CBT, and nine had been treated with CBT. E/RP had
previously been used with two participants during their
CBT treatment. In the other psychotherapy procedures, no
E/RP against OCD symptoms had been conducted for any
participant.

A graphical representation of the CY-BOCS scores for every
assessment point is shown in Figure 2 and a list of the individual
scores for all outcome measures in Table 2.

A mixed two-way ANOVA with group (treatment group,
waiting list group) as the between-subjects factor and time
(t0, t1) as the within-subjects factor for CY-BOCS scores
showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of
time [F (1, 58) = 68.47,
p < 0.001], a signiﬁcant eﬀect of group [F (1, 58) = 39.22,
p < 0.001], and a signiﬁcant group x time interaction
[F (1, 58) = 34.52, p < 0.001]. The signiﬁcant
eﬀect
interaction was further analyzed. In the treatment group,
there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between t0 and t1 [t
(29) = 8.43, p < 0.001], whereas in the waiting list group,
the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant [t (29) = 2.24, p = 0.067].
Between-group comparisons revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the treatment group and the waiting list group
for t1, with those in the treatment group showing lower
CY-BOCS scores than those in the waiting list group [t
(46.47) = 6.33, p < 0.001], whereas comparison between
the groups was non-signiﬁcant
for t0 [t (55.70) = 1.73,
p = 0.089].

Cohen’s d between groups for t1 was d = 1.63. The within-
group eﬀect size for the treatment group (t0 to t1) was d = 2.01.

in the treatment group. In the waiting list group this was not the
case for any participant at the end of the waiting period.

Treatment remission and response

In the treatment group, 18 of the 28 participants (64%)
who completed treatment met the remission criteria at the
end of treatment (t1). In the waiting list group, none of the
participants met the remission criteria after the end of the
waiting period (t1), [X2 (1) = 19.80, p < 0.001]. At the same
measurement time point, 22 of the 28 participants (79%) in
the treatment group met response criteria. In the waiting list
group this was not the case for any participant [X2 (1) = 28.07,
p < 0.001].

Effectiveness of treatment in the waiting list
group

After the participants in the waiting list group received
treatment (t2), there was a signiﬁcant decrease in CY-BOCS
scores compared with time point end of waiting period (t1)
[t (29) = 5.22, p < 0.001]. This change was also evident in the

CGI-Severity scores [t (29) = 7.19, p < 0.001]. The participant’s
condition was rated as much better or very much better (CGI-
Improvement) in all participants, after receiving treatment (t2).
The within-group eﬀect size for the waiting list group (t1 to t2)
was d = 1.64.

Secondary outcomes

An overview of

the analysis results for all secondary
outcome measures for the time points t0 and t1 can be found
in Table 3. The signiﬁcance level was set to p = 0.001 to account
for multiple testing.

Only the signiﬁcant changes are described below, all other
analyses revealed no signiﬁcant eﬀects, while descriptively
results indicated a general improvement in mental health.

While the two groups did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly concerning
CGAS scores at t0, the CGAs score of the treatment group
increased from t0 to t1 and was signiﬁcantly higher than that
of the waiting list group at t1. A graphical representation of
the CGAS scores for every assessment time point is shown in
Figure 3.

For the COIS-R child-rated and parent-rated version, as well
as for the CBCL total score, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in
the scores from t0 to t1 independently of the group.

Stability of treatment effects

Primary outcomes
Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale

A mixed two-way ANOVA with group (treatment group,
waiting list group) and time (post-treatment,
follow-up I,
follow-up II) for CY-BOCS scores showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect
of time [F (2, 80) = 78.76, p = 0.020], whereas the eﬀect
of group [F (1, 40) = 3.20, p = 0.081] and group × time
interaction [F (2, 80) = 13.78, p = 0.432] were not signiﬁcant.
The eﬀect of time was due to a decrease in CY-BOCS scores
at
follow-up II compared to follow-up I [t (41) = 2.68,
p = 0.011] and at follow-up II as compared to post-treatment
[t (41) = 2.15, p = 0.037]. The diﬀerence between post-
treatment and follow-up I was not signiﬁcant [t (41) = 0.11,
p = 0.915].

Clinical global impressions-severity

Clinical global impressions-improvement

In the treatment group, participants’ condition was rated as
much better or very much better at follow-up I in 20 of 28 (71%)
and at follow-up II in 20 of 28 (71%). In the waiting list group,
this was the case for 17 of 19 (89%) at follow-up I, and also at
follow-up II (17/19; 89%).

Treatment remission and response

Table 4 shows participants‘ response and remission rates in
both groups for the measurement time points post-treatment to
follow-up II for those who completed treatment.

Treatment satisfaction, feasibility, and

For both groups together, the mean score for participants’
satisfaction with the treatment, measured with the CSQ-8, was
M = 28.69 (SD = 3.78). Information on the individual items of
the CSQ-8 can be found in Table 6.

Based on the Final Therapy Evaluation Questionnaire
conducted after the treatment, more than 90% of parents
and participants reported that they liked that the therapy was
conducted via the internet. All parents reported having a good
understanding of what to do to support their children against
OCD. Similarly, at the end of the treatment, all children reported
having a good understanding of how to manage their OCD
symptoms and how the exposure exercises work. Regarding
the usability of the video conferencing program, approximately
90% stated that it worked well. The results of the ﬁnal therapy
evaluation can be found in detail in Table 7.

The assessment of the feasibility and implementation of the

therapy from the therapists’ perspective is shown in Table 8.

Adverse events

The mixed two-way ANOVA with group (treatment group,
waiting list group) and time (post-treatment,
follow-up I,
follow-up II) for CGI-Severity scores showed no signiﬁcant
eﬀect of time [F (2, 80) = 1.85, p = 0.175], group [F (1, 40) = 2.96,

During treatment, one participant experienced a signiﬁcant

treatment, there were no incidents that could be classiﬁed
as adverse events.

Discussion

The primary focus of our study was to examine the
eﬀectiveness of internet-based CBT for children and adolescents
with OCD. The results of previous studies suggest
that
videoconferencing therapy for pediatric OCD is feasible (26, 27,
54). However, as we noted in more detail in the introduction,
previous work has used neither a sample of this size nor such
a long follow-up period. The largest sample consisted of 31
participants (27), and the longest follow-up period was 6 months
(26). Although other studies used innovative ideas for using
computer-based techniques (e.g., interactive computer games
to enhance children’s understanding of treatment concepts)
(26), both the use of technological devices (e.g., a tablet) and
digital applications (therapy documents in the cloud, a mobile
assessment application) in our study go far beyond the scope
of previous ones. Finally, the transformation of a face-to-face
therapy manual into a feasible online version is also a novel
feature of the current study.

To assess the eﬀectiveness of this approach, CY-BOCS
outcomes of a group of participants who began treatment
immediately after enrolment in the study were compared with
those of a waiting list control group after the end of the
waiting period. As we expected, OCD symptoms signiﬁcantly
decreased in the treatment group compared to the waiting list
group over the same period. The eﬀect size for the between-
group comparison of CY-BOCS scores at time t1 (treatment
group = post-treatment; waiting list group = end of waiting
period) was large, with a value of d = 1.63. After having received

treatment, participants in the waiting list group also showed a
signiﬁcant decline in OCD symptoms. Indeed, in both groups,
after treatment, the mean CY-BOCS scores were well below
the cut-oﬀ value (CY-BOCS total score ≥ 16). This decline in
symptoms continued in both groups after the completion of the
study as demonstrated by a decrease in OCD symptoms from
post-treatment to follow-up II. Immediately after treatment,
64% of participants in the treatment group met the criteria for
remission, in the waiting list group, this was 63%. This rate also
remained stable during the follow-up examinations, and even
increased in the waiting list group. The response criteria were
met by 79% of participants in the treatment group at the post-
treatment measurement time point, and by all participants in the
waiting list group.

The treatment approach we adopted was found to be
eﬀective for treating mild to moderate OCD. The decrease
in OCD symptoms in our study align with the results
from two other randomized controlled trials which review
the eﬀectiveness of
internet-based CBT in children and
adolescents with OCD, where therapy sessions were conducted
via video conferencing (26, 27). E/RPs were a central treatment
element and, as far as technically possible, were accompanied
therapeutically in all three studies in real time in the home
environment on a computer screen. The severity of OCD
symptoms at pre-treatment assessment was also comparable.
Nevertheless, before further discussing the comparison of
OCD symptom change, it is important to ﬁrst mention the
diﬀerences between interventions. In Storch et al. (27), the
treatment was more compressed (14 sessions in 12 weeks)
compared to our approach, and in Comer et al. (26), the
involvement of parents in the therapy and their training
as coaches for their children was signiﬁcant due to the
participants‘ young age.

In the study from Storch et al. (27), the between-group
eﬀect size (treatment vs. waiting list) was d = 1.36 at the post-
treatment measurement time point, and the remission rate
was 56% (criteria: severity rating ≤ 3 on Anxiety Disorders
Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (55) and CY-BOCS total
score ≤ 10). Eighty-one percent were classiﬁed as treatment
responders (criteria: CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2 and ≥ 30%
reduction in CY-BOCS total score). The within-group eﬀect
size (pre- vs. post-treatment) reported in Comer et al. (26)
was d = 1.53. The rate of those who no longer met the
criteria for an OCD diagnosis after the end of treatment
was slightly over 63% (determined via Anxiety Disorders
Interview Schedule for DSM-IV). Almost 73% were classiﬁed
as responders (criteria: CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2). Therefore,
in the current study, we actually achieved slightly greater
improvements in terms of the magnitude of change in OCD
symptoms, although comparabality is not entirely given for
the reasons stated above. This improvement is even more
valid when compared with a study using an internet-based
form of CBT in which the children and adolescents largely

completed treatment modules independently over a period of
12 weeks but had regular contact with a clinician by mail or
telephone (56). The average time spent by the clinician per
patient per week, was 17.5 min, much less than for the video-
based approaches (56). The eﬀect size in this study between
the treatment group and wait-list group was d = 0.69 at the
measurement point at post-treatment/end of the waiting period.
The remission rate was 15% (criteria: CGI-Severity = 1 or
2 and CY-BOCS total score ≤ 12), as responders classiﬁed
were 27% (criteria: CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2 and ≥ 35%
reduction in CY-BOCS total score). As a ﬁrst interim conclusion,
it can be stated that our study adds substantial evidence to
support the eﬀectiveness of internet-based CBT for children and
adolescents with OCD. Finally, these results align with other
studies on internet-based psychotherapy in adults with OCD
(57, 58).

A comparison of our results on OCD symptom decrease to
those from face-to-face interventions, where CY-BOCS baseline
scores were in a similar range, yields further remarkable
insights. In the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study (POTS (59),
the eﬀect-size within the CBT treatment arm (pre- vs. post-
treatment) was 1.35 (60). The remission rate at the same
time point was nearly 40% (criterion CY-BOCS total ≤ 10);
information on the number of responders was not available
for us. In the Nordic Long-term OCD Treatment Study
NordLOTS (60) the within-group eﬀect size from baseline
to post-treatment was d = 1.58. and the remission rate
for the same time point was 39% (criterion CY-BOCS total
score ≤ 10). Almost 73% were classiﬁed as treatment responders
(criterion: CY-BOCS total score ≤ 15). Overall,
it can be
concluded that the eﬀectiveness shown in our study is at
least on the same level as that found in the face-to-face
treatment studies.

Beyond the observation of the treatment eﬀectiveness, the
course of change is also interesting. The fact that the CY-
BOCS scores once again decreased signiﬁcantly after the post-
treatment measurement time point is not a phenomenon found
consistently in the literature and is therefore noteworthy. It is
possible that the 3 months to follow-up measurement frequently
chosen in studies is too short and that further reductions in
OCD symptoms do not become signiﬁcant until after this
time. Our own results, in addition to those of other studies
(26, 61), support this interpretation. Therefore, the question of
the follow-up periods required for internet-based treatments
to fully capture the long-term treatment eﬀects should be
further explored.

Due to the severe impairment in various areas of daily life
in subjects with OCD, the level of psychosocial functioning
of the patients is of particular interest. After treatment, the
psychosocial functioning level of the participants improved in
both groups of this study. The improvement in psychosocial
functioning in addition to the decrease in OCD symptoms is
a consistent ﬁnding that has been reported in other studies

of technology-based CBT for pediatric OCD (26, 49, 62). The
eﬀects found in our study are in the upper range of what has
been observed in these studies.
Unlike OCD symptoms,

the child- and parent-rated
secondary outcome measures showed few signiﬁcant changes.
From pre- to post-treatment/end-of-waiting period, there was
a signiﬁcant decrease in scores on the COIS-R and CBCL
independently of treatment. We would have expected this
speciﬁcally with the COIS-R. One possible explanation is the
version of this measure we used. The items were translated into
German by our group, but no values on validity and reliability
of this German version are available. It is noteworthy that
the average baseline values, rated by participants and parents,
compared to our own preliminary study (28) and the study of
Storch et al. (27) are below the values collected there. However,
the other parameters used to determine the severity of OCD
(CY-BOCS, CGI-S) are comparable to the current ones. A review
of the German-language version seems reasonable.

Even though our treatment approach focused exclusively on
OCD symptoms, the absence of these eﬀects was not necessarily
expected. Studies have shown that depressive symptoms (63,
64),
in addition to anxiety symptoms (65) decrease under
face-to-face CBT for children and adolescents with OCD. On
the other hand, in a video-based CBT for OCD comparable
in treatment approach and sample, the treatment group did
not outperform a waiting list control in reducing anxiety and
depression symptoms after having received treatment (27).
Furthermore, the course of improvement in secondary anxiety
and depression symptoms appears to diﬀer from each other
and, most importantly, to be independent of the reduction
in OCD symptoms (66). There is also a lack of conclusive
understanding of which components of CBT for OCD address
anxiety and depression symptoms and to what extent. There
is a need for further research to develop a more advanced
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transfer of
CBT techniques to non-OCD symptoms. This is even more
true for video-based treatments. Regarding our study, it can be
noted that on a purely descriptive level, there is a treatment-
associated decrease in mean scores for the self- and parent-rated
outcome measures capturing anxiety and obsessive-compulsive
symptoms (see Table 2).
Accordingly, our

into the
eﬀectiveness of internet-based CBT for OCD. Nevertheless, the
limitations of our study should also be noted. The choice of a
waiting group as a control condition enables us to demonstrate
that our approach led to a reduction in OCD symptoms.
Furthermore, the results can be compared descriptively with
face-to-face studies. However, a statement as to
those of
whether the internet-based treatment is actually equal to the
well-established face-to-face CBT for OCD in terms of eﬃcacy
cannot be made. The next step is to conduct studies in which
the treatment with face-to-face CBT is the control condition
or other therapy approaches such as medication or self-help.

But more eﬀective or not, we think that internet-based CBT
delivers treatment access for the patients and also the option to
treat symptoms at home which has often the highest relevance
for these patients.
Furthermore,

it must be noted that, even though the
majority of participants stated that they had sought inclusion
in the study due to a lack of local therapy oﬀers,
it can
nevertheless be assumed that these families were more open
than average to internet-based therapy and that the sample
was, thus, not fully representative of all children with OCD
concerning their attitudes toward digital elements in therapy.
The generalizability of the results to all children and adolescents
with OCD may therefore, be limited. However, it is conceivable
that the group of participants for whom digital treatment
approaches represent something normal may become larger in
the future. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a
catalyst for digitalization in healthcare (67), and this will most
likely lead to digital interventions becoming an integral part of
treatment and participants becoming more familiar with them.

prior advice not to do so, families very occasionally made

Furthermore, studies focusing on stepped-care designs to

including more or less intensive modules
of face-to-face psychotherapy, internet-based psychotherapy,
self-help elements, or medication, are warranted.

In summary, this study has demonstrated that internet-
based CBT is eﬀective for treating children with mild to
moderate OCD. It enables these children to receive specialized
state-of-the-art therapy regardless of their place of residence-
and even enables the treatment of symptoms by therapist-
guided exposures with response prevention at the location the
symptoms typically occur, which is frequently at the child’s
home. The implementation of exposure exercises in the living
environment may increase the ecological validity of the therapy
(70), which may, consequently, have a reinforcing eﬀect on the
eﬀectiveness of the treatment. Further studies are necessary to
draw conclusions regarding this reinforcing eﬀect.

Overall, our study extends the evidence for internet-based
CBT approaches to be eﬀective for treating OCD in children and
adolescents, making it a viable method for providing access to
adequate treatment.
