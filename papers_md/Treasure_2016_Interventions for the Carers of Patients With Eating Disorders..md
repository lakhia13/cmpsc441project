Abstract The aim of this study is to evaluate the recent liter-
ature on carers/parenting interventions for people with eating
disorders. Interesting and important new findings are
highlighted as well as the implications that this may have for
treatment. We have reviewed and critically analysed the recent
literature. Close others often play an important role in
recognising the early signs of eating disorders and accessing
and implementing treatment. Their role in helping with recov-
ery is to give support and hold a united front themselves and
with the professional team to avoid those common interper-
sonal reactions that adversely impact on outcome such as ac-
commodating to the illness and reacting with high expressed
emotion (overprotection and hostility). Managing this role is
difficult, and coping resources are often strained. Carers ask
for and are now getting expert training in skills to manage this
role. There is an overlap between carer/parenting interventions
and family therapies. The interface with close others is critical
both for early recognition and access and implementation of
treatment. Interventions which equip families and close others
with the skills to manage eating disorder behaviours are show-
ing potential at improving outcomes.

Introduction

An individual with anorexia nervosa (AN) writing about her
personal journey said that if she had to describe the illness in
one word it would be isolation [1]. The loneliness of an eating
disorder [2] can be ameliorated by family members and other
carers. However, social problems of the individual her or him-
self combined with the secondary social problems that arise
from abnormal eating behaviours can make support for recov-
ery difficult.

Social factors are both risk and maintaining factors for
eating disorders [3]. Individual vulnerabilities in terms of
problems in social cognition are found in the acute phase of
AN [4] and include deficits in nonverbal emotional expression
[5] and sensitivity to threat and to social comparison [6]. In
part, these may be a consequence of starvation but a subgroup
of patients with AN have social problems that antedate the
eating disorder (ED) and remain after recovery [7, 8]. Also,
the offspring of people with ED may present anomalies in
aspects of social cognition [9]. Thus, problems in social cog-
nition may be an endophenotype that increases the risk of
developing an ED.

Patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) experience interperson-
al difficulties before the onset of their ED [10] and bulimic
behaviours can impair socio-emotional processing [11]. There
is limited evidence about social deficits in obesity and binge
eating disorder (BED). Individuals with BED experience dif-
ficulties of emotional regulation as high as those in AN or BN
patients, with high levels of emotional suppression and low
levels of emotional reappraisal [12].

The ED itself has a profound interpersonal impact particu-
larly on the family as the age of onset is usually before the
individual has left home [13]. Moreover, as the median dura-
tion of illness is 6–7 years [14], the passage through develop-
mental milestones is impeded [15]. Many patients remain

16 Page 2 of 7

dependent on their families or the state during their lifetime
[16]. Close interpersonal relationships change over the trajec-
tory of the illness and the range of interpersonal skills needed
to support recovery vary. The developmental age, work and
social adjustment and whether an individual is financially and
socially independent have an impact on management. Thus,
the impact and role of close others is not simple as it depends
on these factors [17].

Caregivers are those who provide care to someone who
need supervision or assistance during the course of an illness
and hereafter the concept refers to family (parents, spouses) or
friends. The reaction of carers to an ED depends on aspects of
the illness, the context and the carer themselves and in turn
these impact on the course of the illness. In the initial stages,
the individual does not recognise that she/he is ill and carers
can play an important role by being aware of the early signs
and facilitating access to treatment. Expressed emotion is a
factor that adversely impacts on the prognosis of many chron-
ic illnesses, and eating disorders are no exception [18]. High
expressed emotion is defined as a critical, hostile or overpro-
tective, controlling style of behaviour. Also, family members
may collude with ED behaviours, by organising the family
around eating disorder rules, ignoring or covering up the neg-
ative consequences of the behaviours [19]. These behaviours
can cause divisions amongst family members. Some carers
shoulder an overly high burden, and others become
disempowered from contributing to the management of the
illness.

Thus, the social aspect of the illness is important for the
wellbeing both of the individual and of the wider network.
These two aspects are inter-related; however, interventions

often have a separate focus on improving the wellbeing of
carers or the patient (as in family-based therapy (FBT)) with
the family members providing nutritional support and other
aspects of care. The burden on caregivers can be overlooked
in the latter role [20].

The Carer Giving Experience and Carer Coping

Carers express a need for information about the illness [21,
22]. Unfortunately, some literature contains unhelpful, un-
proved and simplified hypotheses about the families’ role in
the illness, which can cause offence and/or guilt [23]. A more
helpful aphorism is that ‘Families are the solution and not the
problem’.

There are many factors that impact on the perceived and
actual burden of the caregiving role and how families manage
this. The three main domains that impact on caring are the
illness itself, the societal reaction to the illness and carer fac-
tors, including costs and interactions with services which are
illustrated in Fig. 1. Helping the carer to cope with the illness
is an essential first step. In the collaborative care model, we
use the metaphor of airline safety procedures, in which parents
are advised to fix their own oxygen supply first before attend-
ing to the child [24].

Aspects of the care giving experience have been
summarised in a systematic review [25] which has been re-
cently updated [26]. High perceived burden, and low caregiv-
ing efficacy are common and are associated with clinical
levels of depression and anxiety [25, 26].

A variety of specific measures have been developed to tap
into the relevant problematic areas, and these are shown in
Table 1. These include the Eating Disorders Symptom Impact
Scale (EDSIS), which measures burden [27]. The Accommo-
dation and Enabling Scale for Eating Disorders (AESED)
which measures the tendency of the family to collude with
the patient [28, 29]. The Caregiver Skills (CASK) scale mea-
sures modifiable aspects of caregiver behaviour that, accord-
ing to the New Maudsley model, are thought to improve out-
comes [30]. The parents versus anorexia nervosa (PvAN)
scale measures parental self-efficacy and is based upon the
model of FBT [31]. A new measure of carer coping is avail-
able to assess coping strategies, called the Family Coping
Questionnaire for Eating Disorders (FCQ-ED) [32]. Several
of these instruments assess interpersonal means of managing
the symptoms, such as avoidance, collusion, confrontation,
compassion and connection.

Eating disorder symptoms are pervasive and intrusive into
the family life, and interpersonal relationships become
entangled with the disorder in a complex manner. The patients’
primary and secondary difficulties in social cognition can make
these relationships even more difficult. For example, the re-
duced level of facial expressivity in ED patients [5, 33] makes
it hard for others to appreciate their level of terror. ED patients
can be impervious to the impact on close others [34] with the
overt life-threatening nature of the symptoms contrasting with
the individuals own unwillingness to accept the sick role.

Carers themselves have their own practical and emotional
reaction to the illness, which for the most part is helpful but can
impede recovery if there is division within the family, collusion
with some aspects of the illness and high expressed emotion.
Siblings can develop their own problems or leave home prema-
turely as their needs may be neglected [35]. Carers’ distress and
means of coping with the caring role may add to the distress of
the individual with an ED, and a vicious circle develops [36].
Poor coping lead to distress, and this, in turn, increases the
tendency to either overprotect the individual and accommodate
to the illness or enter into unproductive fights. Many of the
elements of carer stress and coping are universal, and various
models have been described [37]. Models of stress have been
described for caregivers of other illnesses such as Alzheimer’s
disease where carer coping style is determined by environmen-
tal stress and resources available [38].

Most research has focused on the caregiving for AN, there
is little evidence about BN families and hardly any about
BED. Caregivers of BN and BED report high levels of depres-
sion, anxiety and stress [39].

Change Processes and Techniques

This involves sharing information with carers about how to (1)
increase carer coping, (2) effective support and change skills
and (3) reduce unhelpful interpersonal behaviours.

1. Models of carer coping.

Social support increases carer coping [40–42], but high
levels of contact time reduces resilience [17, 40]. Thus,
mothers and partners often have higher levels of burden and
distress [41]. Coping may be more difficult if carers have their
own eating disorder [43]. Maladaptive coping, expressed
emotion and carer needs predicted later carer burden [44].

No matter what the stage of illness, carers ask for informa-
tion to help with their caregiving role [21, 22, 45]. It is devel-
opmentally appropriate for carers of young people to provide
meal support whereas this may be less appropriate in the case
of adults with a severe enduring illness. Nonetheless, carers
are drawn in to provide emotional and financial support in the
context of the many problems that can arise with this chronic
illness. Moreover, carers play an important role in bridging the
isolation and can be actively involved in treatments to ame-
liorate the secondary consequences [46].

A systematic review of interventions primarily targeting
the needs of caregivers and increasing their coping abilities
found benefits in terms of reduced burden and distress [47].
However, the quality of many of the studies was limited; the
descriptions of the intervention were poorly detailed, and the
change processes involved were unclear. Most of the studies
focused on carer outcomes only.

2. Skills to manage the illness.

A key part of FBT is empowering the parents to
provide nutritional support, and the success of this as-
pect of therapy is marked by an improvement in weight
in the early phase [48, 49]. This can be difficult partic-
ularly if the illness has been present for some time
to critical and controlling
when families may resort
strategies [50]. A new adaptation to family-based treat-
ment has a focus on increasing carer skills [51(cid:129)] to deal
with behaviours that have become more entrenched and
appears to have benefits.

The New Maudsley collaborative care approach was devel-
oped particularly to help families with prolonged illness [24].
This model teaches carers skills such as positive communica-
tion using motivational interviewing (MI), meal support and
the management of other difficult behaviours. Lay and profes-
sional carers can be adequately trained to deliver these MI
interventions [52]. This approach has been given in a group
format [53] and also in a scalable form with a carer self-
management format. DVDs (http://www.succeedfoundation.
org) and books for carers describe various behaviour change
strategies and how social support can be used to enhance
refeeding and other eating disorder symptoms [54, 55].
Moreover, there is evidence that adding an intervention for
carers can improve patient outcome, reduce service use and
carer burden [56(cid:129)]. Both carers and patients comment on the

Legend: this table illustrates the domains of caregiving that have been examined in caring for people with eating disorders

positive changes such as increased understanding and more
communion following this form of intervention [57–59].

Interventions that

target other socio-emotional aspects
of eating disorders [60, 61] and cognitive rigidity have
also been developed [62]. Some of those suggest adapta-
tions of novel psychological techniques with standard fam-
ily interventions for ED but these warrant further investi-
gation. An adaptation of acceptance and commitment ther-
apy [60] integrating FBT skills (re-nourishment exposure
to feared foods and situations facilitated by parents) for
families of adolescent AN patients has found changes in
psychological acceptance of the disorder for all family
members and a half of participants attaining full remission.
An integration of skills from dialectic behavioural therapy
(daily review of symptom change; analysis of behaviour
chains; development of crisis plans; emotional regulation
skills for the whole family) with FBT (improvement of
communications during mealtimes) [63] for families of
adolescent bulimia nervosa has also been tried [64]. Other
interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy (CRT)
focus on AN thinking styles which might impair adher-
ence and outcome of psychological therapies. A CRT self-
help model delivered in collaboration of carers showed
good acceptability and is also an intervention in which
carers role might be important [62].

3. Reducing unhelpful behaviours—interpersonal maintain-

ing patterns.

The cognitive interpersonal model of Schmidt and Treasure
(2006) describes how interpersonal processes are impacted by
the visibility of AN [65], which can elicit overprotection or
conflict [66(cid:129)]. Carer accommodating behaviour is higher in
the early phase of illness and is associated with both patient
and carer distress (Rhind, submitted). Carers’ distress and
carers’ expressed emotion (overprotection, criticism and hos-
tility) are similar at all stages of illness [67]. The New
Maudsley model of collaborative care reduces both accommo-
dation and expressed emotion [67] and improves patient out-
comes [56(cid:129)].

Conclusion

Interventions for caregivers need to take into account the stage
of illness and whether interpersonal maintaining behaviours
such as accommodation, expressed emotion or family division
are present. A variety of psychoeducational interventions can
improve carer coping. FBT successfully teaches skills to man-
age behaviours present in the early phase of the illness. The
New Maudsley approach addresses some of the maintaining

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2016) 18: 16

interpersonal behaviours. New interventions specifically
targeting partners [68] have been produced, and a consider-
ation of the needs of siblings may also be of value. Most of
this work has focused on anorexia nervosa, and more work is
needed to understand the needs of close others in relationship
to bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. This remains a
work-in-progress, but the interim conclusions are that the psy-
chosocial and interpersonal aspects of eating disorders play an
important role in their management.
