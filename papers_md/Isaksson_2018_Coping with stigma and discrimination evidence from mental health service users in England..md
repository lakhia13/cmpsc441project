Aims. Mental health stigma and discrimination are significant problems. Common coping orientations include: con-
cealing mental health problems, challenging others and educating others. We describe the use of common stigma coping
orientations and explain variations within a sample of English mental health service users.

Methods. Cross-sectional survey data were collected as part of the Viewpoint survey of mental health service users’
experiences of discrimination (n = 3005). Linear regression analyses were carried out to identify factors associated
with the three stigma coping orientations.

Results. The most common coping orientation was to conceal mental health problems (73%), which was strongly asso-
ciated with anticipated discrimination. Only 51% ever challenged others because of discriminating behaviour, this being
related to experienced discrimination, but also to higher confidence to tackle stigma.

Conclusions. Although stigma coping orientations vary by context, individuals often choose to conceal problems,
which is associated with greater anticipated and experienced discrimination and less confidence to challenge stigma.
The direction of this association requires further investigation.

Background

et

Experiences of discrimination are common among
people with mental health problems (Brohan et al.
2013; Corker et al. 2013; Henderson et al. 2014;
Lasalvia et al. 2015). Moreover, stigma and discrimin-
ation represent important factors, which can impede

help-seeking (Lewer
(Livingston & Boyd, 2010). Stigma and discrimination
experienced by people with mental health problems
can be considered within a stress and coping frame-
work, with the stressor being a threat to social identity
(Major & O’Brien, 2005). There are three coping orien-
tations within the stigma-coping-framework by Link
et al. (1991, 2002) that are commonly described in the
literature: (1) secrecy (concealing mental illness), (2)
illness and (3)
educating others about mental

challenging others about their stigmatising attitudes
and behaviours.

Coping with stigma can help to maintain a positive
self-concept (Major & O’Brien, 2005) and self-esteem
(Ilic et al. 2011). But, depending on the coping strategy,
outcomes may differ substantially. The literature sug-
gests that secrecy is associated with lower self-esteem
(Ilic et al. 2011), higher levels of experienced discrimin-
ation (Lasalvia et al. 2013) and perceived discrimination
as well as self-stigma (Vauth et al. 2007). In contrast,
active strategies like educating others and challenging
others were not associated with less self-esteem or feel-
ing ashamed (Link et al. 2002), and there was no effect on
self-stigma (Moses, 2014) or on devaluation and dis-
crimination (Link et al. 1991). Overall, there is only little
evidence about positive and negative correlates of dif-
ferent coping orientations. In addition to anticipated
and experienced stigma and discrimination, clinical
and socio-demographic characteristics such as diagno-
sis (Brohan et al. 2011) and gender may be associated
with variation in use of coping orientations (Rusch
et al. 2011). Still, findings are contradictory and scarce,

particularly for socio-demographic variables such as
age, ethnicity and education (Ilic et al. 2011; Rüsch
et al. 2011; Moses, 2014).

Aims

Our study describes the occurrence and pattern of use
of three common stigma coping orientations (Link et al.
1991, 2002): (1) concealing mental health problems
(=secrecy), (2) educating others and (3) challenging
others among a sample of 3005 English mental health
service users. Further, we describe associations of
these coping orientations with anticipated and experi-
enced discrimination, social capital and overall confi-
dence and ability to use personal skills in coping
with stigma and discrimination.

Method

Study design

This study uses data from the Viewpoint survey of
mental health service users’ experiences of discrimin-
ation in England, collected between 2011 and 2013.
Full methodological details and results have been
reported elsewhere (Corker et al. 2013). The study
team conducted telephone interviews among a differ-
ent sample each year. Participants were recruited
through National Health Service (NHS) Mental Health
trusts (service provider organisations). Participants
were eligible to take part if they were aged 18–65,
had any mental health diagnosis (excluding dementia)
and had been in recent receipt of specialist mental
health services (contact during the previous 6 months).
Participants were excluded if they were not currently
living in the community (e.g., in prison or hospital)
since participants needed to be available to take part
in a sensitive, confidential telephone survey.

In each year, five different NHS mental health trusts
across England were selected to take part (n = 15).
Trusts were intended to be representative of NHS men-
tal health organisations in England, based on the socio-
economic deprivation level of their catchment area.
The study received approval from Riverside NHS
Ethics Committee 07/H0706/72.

Invitation packs contained complete information
about the study including lists of interview topics,
local and national sources of support, and a consent
form. Information was also included in 13 commonly
spoken languages explaining how to obtain the in-
formation pack in another language if needed. A
reminder letter was mailed to non-responders after 2
weeks. Participants mailed written consent
forms,
including contact details, directly to the research
team. Participants were offered a £10 voucher for tak-
ing part in the survey. All telephone interviewers were
trained and supervised by the research team. Data col-
lection was carried out by trained and supervised
interviewers, the majority of whom had experience of
mental health problems themselves. Consent was con-
firmed verbally by the interviewer prior to start of the
interview. The current study comprises the samples of
2011, 2012 and 2013 with a total of 3005 participants.

Measures

Experienced and anticipated discrimination

The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) was used
to measure experienced discrimination and anticipated
discrimination. The DISC is interviewer administered
and has demonstrated good reliability, validity and
acceptability (Thornicroft et al. 2009; Brohan et al.
2013). Experienced discrimination is assessed via 22
items, covering 21 specific life areas, plus an additional
item to record ‘other’ experiences. Anticipated discrim-
ination is measured with four items, three items asking
about life areas where discrimination was anticipated
and one item asking about concealing mental health
problems. Overall experienced discrimination scores
were calculated by counting any reported instance of
negative discrimination as ‘1’ and situations in which
no discrimination was reported as ‘0’. The overall
score was then calculated as: sum of reported discrim-
ination divided by the number of questions answered
(only applicable answers were included) and multi-
plied by 100. This provides a percentage of items in
which discrimination was reported. For example, if a
participant reported discrimination for 13 out of the
possible 22 items and also reported that four items
were not applicable, then the overall score would be
3/(22–4) × 100 = 72%.

Participants

Within each participating trust, non-clinical staff in
information technology or patient records departments
used their central patient database to select a random
sample of persons receiving care for ongoing mental
health problems. Up to 4000 invitation packs were
sent out from each participating trust to achieve a sam-
ple size of approximately 1000 service users each year.

Confidence and ability to tackle stigmatisation

The final section of the DISC-12 contains one item
about
the ability to deal with discrimination and
stigma encountered because of mental illness. In add-
ition, one question about participants’ overall confi-
dence in tackling stigma and discrimination was
included in the survey.

Social capital

(Webber &
The Resource Generator-UK (RG-UK)
Huxley, 2007) was used to measure participants’ access
to social resources within their own social network
(‘social capital’). The instrument has four subscales
each representing a concrete domain of social capital:
domestic resources, personal skills, expert advice and
problem-solving resources. The RG-UK has good reli-
ability and validity (Webber & Huxley, 2007) and has
been used in samples of people with mental health
problems (Webber et al. 2014) and produced valid find-
ings. RG-UK total and subscale scores were calculated
by scoring items accessible within a participant’s net-
work as 1 and those not accessible as 0, and then sum-
ming to calculate scale totals. Missing values of RG-UK
items were replaced using multiple imputation (Sterne
et al. 2009).

Stigma coping

We assessed three types of stigma coping orientations:
educating others, challenging others and concealing
mental health problems. Educating others and challen-
ging others were assessed via two subscales of the
revised Stigma Coping Scale (Link et al. 2004). The
educating others subscale consists of three items asses-
sing how much mental health service users educate
others about their condition or about mental illness
in general. Responses are given on a four-point scale
from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’ within the
context of the previous 3 months; Cronbach’s alpha
is 0.71. The stigma coping orientation challenging
others is measured using five items assessing how
much mental health service users challenge stigmatis-
ing behaviour of others within the context of the previ-
ous 3 months. Response options are on a five-point
scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very often’ Cronbach’s
alpha is 0.75. As a proxy for the coping orientation
secrecy the DISC-item asking about concealing mental
health problems (terms are used interchangeably) was
used, with response options on a four-point scale from
‘not at all’ to ‘a lot’ within the context of the previous
12 months.

orientation at all. Thus, concealing mental health pro-
‘a little’,
blems was dichotomised as ‘not at all’ v.
‘sometimes’, ‘fairly often’ and ‘very often’. Educating
others had a normal distribution and therefore was
dichotomised as ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ –
‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’. Challenging others
v.
was dichotomised as ‘never’ v. ‘almost never’, ‘some-
times’, ‘fairly often’ and ‘very often’. As some indivi-
duals used multiple coping orientations, we also
investigated the pattern of use (i.e., exclusive use or
multiple use of coping orientations) for each of the
three coping orientation styles challenging others, edu-
cating others and secrecy for the full sample and strati-
fied by gender in order to describe gender differences
in the use of coping orientations. Coping orientations
of males v. females were compared using chi-squared
statistic.

Unadjusted and fully adjusted linear regression ana-
lyses were carried out in order to identify factors asso-
ciated with the three stigma coping orientations
(challenging, educating and concealment). We calcu-
lated standardised mean values for each of the stigma
coping orientation outcomes based on z-score. Thus,
the outcomes reflect the frequency and/or intensity
that each strategy was employed. Independent vari-
ables were: socio-demographic characteristics including
age, gender, ethnicity, education and employment, and
clinical characteristics including first contact with
mental health services,
involuntary admission, and
diagnosis (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
personality disorders, anxiety disorder, schizoaffective
disorder and other). Further, experienced and antici-
pated discrimination, social capital and the ability
and confidence to cope with stigma were independent
variables. Regression diagnostics were carried out for
each model, the data did not have significant outliers,
and the statistical assumptions of collinearity, nor-
mality, homogeneity of variance and linearity were
met. Analyses were carried out using SPSS for Mac,
release 22.

Statistical analysis

In order to characterise coping orientations, we first
created binary variables, categorising participants
who reported any v. no use of the three coping orienta-
tions. Cut points were identified, which captured the
natural distribution of the sample data. Neither con-
cealing mental health problems nor challenging others
were normally distributed as both had a substantial

Overall, 3005 participants were included in our ana-
lysis. Response rates for completed interviews were
11% in 2011, 10% in 2012 and 10% in 2013, respect-
ively. Female (61.1%) and white (89.5%) British partici-
pants were over-represented in our sample. Half of the
participants were unemployed (51.4%) and depression
was the most common diagnosis (27.7%) followed by
bipolar disorder (19.4%) and schizophrenia (14%).

Prevalence of type of stigma coping orientation

The most common coping orientation concealing men-
tal health problems was used by 73% of mental health
service users. The distribution of responses was left
skewed with 44% reporting using this orientation ‘a
lot’, 20% ‘moderately’ and 9% ‘a little’. Only 25%
reported not concealing mental health problems at all
(see Fig. 1). Challenging others about their stigmatis-
ing attitudes to mental illness was reported by 51%
of respondents while almost half (49%) ‘never’ chal-
lenged others (see Fig. 2). For educating others, 43%
of participants ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that they
were applying this coping orientation. The use of this
coping orientation was normally distributed (see
Fig. 3). As all three coping orientations were rated

Differences in the stigma coping orientations by
diagnosis

There were significant differences by diagnosis for con-
cealing mental health problems (χ2 (6, n = 2686) = 48.6;
p < 0.0001), challenging others (χ2 (6, n = 2727) = 43.9;
p < 0.0001) and educating others (χ2 (6, n = 2738) =
13.3; p < 0.038). Mental health service users with a
diagnosis of depression ( p < 0.0001) and a diagnosis
of personality disorder ( p < 0.004) concealed their men-
tal health problems significantly more, whereas those
diagnosed with schizophrenia concealed less ( p <
0.0001). Participants diagnosed with schizophrenia
challenged others less for their discriminating behav-
iour than those with other diagnoses ( p < 0.0001) but
educated others more ( p < 0.002) than other mental
health service users.

Factors associated with different stigma coping
orientations

life areas

The most important predictor for the coping orienta-
tion concealing mental health problems was the num-
ber of
in which discrimination was
anticipated, with more anticipated discrimination
being associated with a higher tendency to conceal
mental health problems. Furthermore, concealment
was significantly associated with higher experienced
discrimination and having less confidence to challenge
stigma. In relation to socio-demographic and clinical
variables, concealing mental health problems was
positively associated with being female, being from a
White background (v. being from a Black or Asian
background), holding a university degree, being
employed or economically inactive (v. unemployed)
and not having been admitted to hospital involuntar-
ily. These factors overall explained 32% of the variance
for concealing mental health problems. When predic-
tors were removed blockwise from the regression
model, only anticipated discrimination changed the
adjusted R2 significantly, dropping from R2
adj = 0.32 to
R2

adj = 0.10 (see Table 3).
The main characteristic associated with using the
stigma coping orientation challenging others was
experienced discrimination: greater past experience of
discrimination was associated with a stronger ten-
dency to challenge others. Also, challenging discrimin-
ation was positively related to a higher number of life
areas in which discrimination was anticipated. Higher
social capital, as well as a stronger ability to cope with
stigma and discrimination and more confidence to
challenge stigma was significantly associated with a
greater likelihood to challenging others.

Furthermore, challenging others was positively
associated with female gender and not having been

that their behaviour was stigmatising?’ Answer options range
from 1 = never to 5 = very often.

simultaneously, the frequencies of their use do not add
up to 100%.

Pattern of coping orientation

Only a minority of participants (19%) used one stigma
coping orientation alone. Combining multiple coping
orientations was common, with the majority of people
(44%) applying two and about a third applying all
three orientations (31.6%). Significant gender differ-
ences were found with women being more likely
than men to combine conceal and challenging and con-
ceal, educating and challenging. Men were more likely
than women to use educating others as well as a com-
bination of educating and challenging (see Table 2).

services, you found yourself educating others about what it
means to be a mental health service user’; answer options
range from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree.

admitted to hospital involuntarily. Overall these fac-
tors explained 19% of the variance of the stigma coping
orientation challenging others. After removing experi-
enced discrimination from the regression model, the
adj dropped to 0.09 and the removal of ‘resources’
R2
(social capital, ability and confidence to cope with
stigma) changed the R2
adj to 0.11. Exclusion of other
(socio-demographic variables and anticipated stigma)
variables left the R2
adj largely unaffected (see Table 4).
Although the regression model for the stigma cop-
ing orientation educating others was found to be sig-
nificant, only 3.6% of the variance was explained by
these variables. Educating others was significantly
positively associated with anticipated discrimination,
but negatively with experienced discrimination. Also,
a higher tendency to educate others was associated
with having been admitted to hospital involuntarily,
less confidence to challenge stigma and lower social
capital (see Table 5).

Discussion

Overall, the most common type of stigma coping
orientation was concealing mental health problems,
followed by challenging others and lastly educating
others. In relation to the pattern of use of coping orien-
tations, 81% of mental health service users reported
more than one coping orientation, which is consistent
with stigma-coping research, suggesting that people
may be flexible in how they use coping orientations,
depending on the type of stigma and discrimination

(Holmes & River, 1998) as well as the specific apprai-
sals of the stressful events (Miller & Kaiser, 2001).

Concealing mental health problems

Although the most common and an understandable
reaction to being devalued by the public, most of the
available evidence suggests that there are mainly nega-
tive consequences associated with concealing mental
health problems, such as lower self-esteem, higher self-
stigma and higher experienced discrimination (Link
et al. 1991; Ilic et al. 2011; Lasalvia et al. 2013). In line
with this, we also found negative correlates such as
higher anticipated and experienced stigma and discrim-
ination, and less confidence to challenge stigma. In line
with modified labelling theory (Link, 1989), the antici-
pation of stigma and discrimination – the strongest pre-
dictor in our regression model – is closely linked to
‘self-protection’ by keeping mental health problems a
secret, more than actual experiences of discrimination.
This is consistent with recent findings by Schibalski
et al. (2017), showing that perceived stigma, that is cor-
related with anticipated stigma, predicted avoidant
coping strategies. Consequently, this may lead to a
loss of confidence to challenge stigma that, in turn,
can enhance the anticipation and experience of stigma
and discrimination and vice-versa (Vauth et al. 2007).
Disclosing one’s mental health problem, however,
may not have only positive consequences. For example,
although disclosure is associated with a reduction in
stigma related stress (Rüsch et al. 2014), it may also

increase the experience of stigma (Sarkin et al. 2015) and
hence decrease self-esteem (Bos et al. 2009).

Challenging others

This coping orientation was most strongly associated
with more experienced discrimination; but, at
the
same time participants also reported a better ability
to cope with and greater confidence to challenge stig-
matisation. This might be explained, on the one
hand, by greater consciousness towards discrimination
among people who challenge other’s stigmatising
thoughts and behaviour. On the other hand, those
individuals might experience more discrimination
and thus have more opportunities to challenge dis-
crimination. Greater social capital was also associated

with a higher likelihood of challenging other’s stigma-
tising attitudes and behaviour – social resources might
reduce psychological distress due to stigmatisation
(Henderson et al. 2014; Webber et al. 2014). This rela-
tion might be also explained by more opportunities
to challenge others when being part of a larger social
network. Longitudinal studies need to be carried out
for a better understanding of the direction of these
relationships.

Educating others

Finally, educating others about their mental health
problems was not associated with experienced dis-
crimination, socio-demographic or clinical variables
or with the confidence and ability to challenge stigma

and only 3.6% of the variance was explained by our
model. This finding is consistent with other studies
reporting contradictory findings for educating others
with less impact on various outcomes such as experi-
enced discrimination and self-stigma (Link et al. 1991;
Moses, 2014). Furthermore evidence from public anti-
stigma campaigns suggests that
improved public
knowledge about people with mental illness does not
necessarily increase empowerment among people
with mental illness (Evans-Lacko et al. 2013).

Relationship of coping strategies with
socio-demographic and clinical variables

We identified a significant relationship of diagnosis
with use of different coping orientations. Secondary

mental health service users with a diagnosis of depres-
sion or personality disorders concealed their mental
health problems more than those with a diagnosis of
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective dis-
order and anxiety disorder. Those diagnosed with
schizophrenia concealed less, and this is consistent
with other findings noting higher disclosure rates
among people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia com-
pared with those with other diagnoses (Thornicroft
et al. 2009). Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia
were also less likely to challenge others for their dis-
criminating behaviour, but did educate others more
about mental illness. For people with schizophrenia,
it might be more difficult to hide symptoms and
furthermore, they have a higher percentage of involun-
compared with people with a
tary admissions

diagnosis of depression (65 v. 20% in depression in our
involuntary admissions
sample). In line with this,
themselves were independently associated with less
secrecy and less challenging. On the other hand, the
motivation to educate others about their illness might
be higher in people who have less common diagnoses
such as schizophrenia.

Gender was also a significant factor related to cop-
ing strategies. Being a woman was associated with a
higher tendency to conceal mental health problems
in the overall sample and more specifically in the sub-
groups of individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder
or personality disorder. Although some studies sug-
gest greater openness (Rüsch et al. 2011) and more
help seeking behaviour among women (Holzinger
et al. 2012), women also tend to report more experi-
ences of discrimination and greater stigma associated

with disclosure (Sarkin et al. 2015). At the same time,
women challenged others more for their discriminat-
ing behaviour, consistent with previous findings
from general stress research with women using more
active strategies than men. Although significant asso-
ciations of coping orientations with other socio-
demographic variables (education, age) could be
found, they were only weak predictors for the type
or pattern of coping orientation used.

Implications for service users

The majority of mental health service users face stigma
and discrimination (Thornicroft et al. 2009; Lasalvia
et al. 2013; Corker et al. 2016). This study focused on
how people respond to these life stressors, which are
that more active
commonplace. Our data suggest

586

A. Isaksson et al.

strategies are associated with positive effects and may
lead to e.g., increased confidence to tackle stigma in
contrast to secrecy. Those who conceal their mental
health problems as a main coping strategy may experi-
ence greater fear of stigmatisation in education, work
or in relationships. Self-stigma and anticipated public
stigma might undermine efforts such as applying for
a job or engaging in a relationship, also known
as the ‘Why Try Effect’
(Corrigan & Rao, 2012).
Interventions such as ‘Coming Out Proud’ (Corrigan
et al. 2013) or decision aids for disclosure (Henderson
et al. 2013) could help service users to develop more
effective coping strategies and reduce stigma stress.
Of course positive and negative consequences of differ-
ent coping orientations have to be weighed out indi-
vidually and depend on specific personal situations
and the broader socio-cultural context in which the
individual is living. A society, which is supportive
and inclusive of people with mental health problems
is a key factor for facilitating this virtuous cycle.
More evidence is needed to specify the short and
long term outcomes of different coping orientations.

Limitations and future directions

There are several limitations of our study, which could
stimulate future stigma-coping-research. First of all,
due to the cross-sectional nature of our study, we can-
not draw conclusions about causality or the efficacy of
stigma coping orientations. Also, due to a relatively
low response rate (10%) the results may only be gener-
alised with caution. The strength of this study is that it
did not use a convenience sample and participants
were randomly selected in contrast to other studies
(Thornicroft et al. 2009; Brohan et al. 2011; Lasalvia
et al. 2013). Furthermore, reported rates of anticipated
and experienced discrimination are comparable to
those reported in other surveys using different data
collection methods (Thornicroft et al. 2009; Lasalvia
et al. 2013). Additionally,
the internal relationship
between the coping strategy and other factors should
remain valid.

Second, a proxy measure was used for the coping
orientation concealing mental health problems.
Consequently, the frequency of this coping orientation
might be overestimated, as the item did not confine the
use of concealing mental health problems to the last 3
months, as was the case for challenging and educating.
Further, although secrecy is a coping orientation
within Link’s stigma coping framework, it should be
acknowledged that it is rather a response to stigmatisa-
tion than an active coping strategy as challenging and
educating others. Third, the DISC-12 does not measure
stress appraisal and stress experience associated with
reported instances of anticipated or experienced

discrimination, which could be important moderating
factors. Finally, specific discriminating events should
be matched to the coping strategy applied in order to
determine their effectiveness. Also, mediating vari-
ables like self-stigma, self-esteem and self-efficacy
need to be included in longitudinal studies to further
determine the direction of the associations between
stigma and discrimination and different
coping
strategies.
