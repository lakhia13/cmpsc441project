Abstract 
Background:  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by disturbing and unwanted thoughts as well 
as repetitive and time-consuming behaviors that interfere with performance. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has 
shown to have beneficial effects on reducing OCD symptoms as the first line of treatment. Moreover, Virtual Reality 
(VR) has been a more feasible and accessible intervention for OCD in recent years. Regarding the point, the objective 
of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure and response prevention (VRERP) in the treat-
ment of the OCD contamination subtype.

Methods:  A total number of 36 adults with OCD-contamination subtype were registered and randomly assigned to 
the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received a 60-min CBT including a “contaminated” virtual 
environment while the control group received CBT as a standardized treatment. Out of these, 29 patients completed 
the treatment in 12 weekly sessions. The patients completed the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), 
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44(OBQ-44), 
and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale-2 (WHODAS-2) at week 0, week 12 and after 3 months 
follow-up.

Results:  Based on the results of the repeated measure analysis of variances, the total score of obsession and com-
pulsion subscales of Y-BOCS significantly decreased as a primary outcome in the intervention group (F

Background
Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  characterized 
by persistent, annoying thoughts together with images or 
obsessions and /or repetitive behaviors or mental actions 
performed  to  decrease  anxiety  and  distress  [1].  Fear  of 
contamination  is  the  most  prevalent  symptom  of  OCD 
[2, 3]. Patients with OCD-contamination subtype overes-
timate the severity and likelihood of contamination. Con-
tamination obsessions often lead to washing and cleaning 
compulsions [4] and compulsive rituals are performed to 
avoid contamination, germ, and dirt and reduce anxiety. 
In addition, they avoid feared situations and objects that 
provoke contamination-related obsessive thoughts [5].

Obsessive  thoughts  of  contamination  lead  to  anxiety 
and  the  person  suffering  from  obsession  begins  to  per-
form  compulsive  behaviors  to  reduce  anxiety,  and  by 
doing  these  actions,  anxiety  temporarily  reduced,  but 
quickly  new  triggers  of  anxiety  emerge  and  the  cycle  of 
obsession  begins.  But  every  time  these  actions  are  per-
formed,  the  doubt  related  to  decontamination  and  the 
feeling  of  inability  to  do  it  properly  increases,  and  as  a 
result, the patients avoid doing many daily actions related 
to  the  content  of  their  obsession  or  feel  disable  against 
them.  This  inability  continues  to  such  an  extent  that  it 
leads to learned helplessness and the patients suffer from 
depression due to this failure.

So,  considering  the  relationship  between  the  severity 
of OCD symptoms and performance deficits, it is impor-
tant to investigate whether treatment improvement from 
OCD  leads  to  improvement  in  performance  and  abil-
ity,  but  few  studies  have  investigated  the  relationship 
between  the  improvement  of  OCD  symptoms  and  the 
performance of the people with this disorder after receiv-
ing  treatment  [6].  In  addition,  this  evidence  emphasizes 
the  importance  of  measuring  anxiety  and  depression 
when evaluating therapeutic changes in OCD and exam-
ining  the  role  of  these  disorders,  which  may  indepen-
dently  lead  to  simultaneous  improvements  in  OCD 
symptoms [7].

The most common treatment for patients with OCD is 
selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  and  cog-
nitive-behavior therapy (CBT), which are used separately 
or  together  [8].  Selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
reduce the OCD symptoms in 40 to 60% of the patients 

[9].  Cognitive-behavior  therapy,  especially  exposure 
and  response  prevention  (ERP)  is  also  effective  [10]  but 
30%  of  patients  did  not  show  any  improvement  in  their 
symptoms.

In  cognitive-behavior  therapy,  patients  are  exposed  to 
anxious  stimuli  but  they  do  not  respond  to  the  obses-
sions.  At  first,  the  therapist  explains  OCD  and  its  treat-
ment.  Then,  external  and  internal  stimuli  are  identified 
that  provoke  obsessive  thoughts  and  subsequent  dis-
tress. They identify the feared outcome if the rituals are 
not  performed. Then,  they  develop  an  anxiety  hierarchy 
according  to  different  situations  from  the  least  to  the 
most  distressing.  While  exposed  to  distressing  stim-
uli,  the  therapist  gives  some  instructions  to  guide  the 
patient  to  prevent  compulsions  and  how  to  tolerate  the 
distress.  In  imaginal  exposure,  patients  visualize  their 
feared  outcome  provoked  by  their  obsessive  thoughts. 
Thus,  patients  learn  that  the  feared  consequences  do 
not  happen,  and  that  they  can  tolerate  anxiety  without 
compulsion.  Then,  the  therapist  and  the  patient  discuss 
the  patient’s  experience  and  learning  during  in  vivo  and 
imaginal exposure [11].

Although 33% of the patients cannot imagine the situ-
ations in imaginal exposure [12] and use cognitive avoid-
ance  during  this  exposure  [13].  In  addition,  the  patients 
should  expose  to  very  anxious  stimuli  in  real  situations 
in  vivo  exposure  that  lead  to  a  high  dropout  rate  in  the 
early  treatment  [14]. There  is  much  evidence  that  expo-
sure  and  response  prevention  (ERP)  should  be  the  first-
line  treatment  for  OCD  [15].  Patients  are  exposed  to 
feared and anxious objects or stimuli in ERP without per-
forming  compulsions.  The  patients  are  confronted  with 
real phobic stimuli/situations (in vivo exposure), whereas 
they visualizes a feared situation in their mind in imagi-
nal  exposure.  Creating  real  objects  or  situations  in  vivo 
exposure  is  difficult,  costly,  and  sometimes  impossible 
[16];  therefore,  many  patients  reject  ERP  [15].  Imaginal 
exposure helps patients confront anxious stimuli without 
safety  problems,  such  as  the  real  risk  of  contamination 
but it is not real and fails to provoke anxiety [16]. Thus, 
a new method is needed to overcome the current limita-
tions in exposure therapy.

Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation 
where  users  interact  with  the  environment  in  real-time 

Javaherirenani et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:740 

Page 3 of 16

[17].  VR  provides  a  supportive  and  secure  environment 
for the patient and increases self-efficacy [18, 19], so VR 
exposure  is  more  acceptable  than  in  vivo  or  imaginal 
exposure [20, 21]. The development of VR has increased 
the use of VRET for patients who do not want to expose 
to much-feared situations since VR can provide step-by-
step  exposure  to  feared  stimuli  in  a  more  realistic  and 
controlled  way in  a  safe setting. Also,  VR  can  overcome 
the  limitations  of  traditional  ERP  techniques  through 
the specific capabilities it posseses. VR provides flexibil-
ity (adapting virtual scenarios to the patients’ needs and 
fears), reproducibility (each scenario can be repeated and 
executed  exactly),  controlled  nature  (adjusting  the  level 
of anxiety in the stimuli), safety (every situation can finish 
without aversive results), and confidentiality (supportive 
and private environment without feeling embarrassment) 
[22].

Finally, this study, with the help of virtual reality tech-
nology,  tries  to  offer  a  coherent  and  complete  CBT  by 
observing  the  points  mentioned  in  the  treatment  pro-
tocols,  including  setting  goals,  psychological  training  of 
the principles by the therapist, determining assignments, 
evaluating the treatment process through questionnaires 
and so on. In this research, in order to improve the eco-
logical  credibility  and  immersion  of  the  virtual  reality 
environment,  the  first  person  perspective  was  used  to 
create meaningful scenarios. Also, unlike previous stud-
ies,  the  sample  size  of  this  study  was  larger  and  CBT 
was used as a standard treatment for the control group. 
Also, the comparative results of two treatments were fol-
lowed up for 3 months whereas the previous studies were 
mostly  pilot  studies  without  a  control  group  and  had  a 
small sample size [4, 13, 23–26].

Generally,  research  show  that  VR  exposure  is  an 
appropriate  alternative  for  the  treatment  of  OCD,  how-
ever, there has been limited research on the effect of VR 
exposure  on  the  fear  of  contamination.  In  addition,  no 
research  has  been  done  on  the  effect  VR  exposure  on 
contamination in OCD in Iran. Thus, this study aimed to 
explore whether contamination-related VR scenarios can 
reduce the severity of OCD symptoms, depression, anxi-
ety, obsessional thoughts and disability.

Methods
Trial setting and design

the  trial.  However,  a  research  assistant,  who  registered 
the  participants  and  assigned  them  to  the  interven-
tion  and  the  control  groups,  was  aware  of  the  alloca-
tion  sequence.  The  allocation  sequence  were  concealed 
using  sequentially  numbered,  sealed,  opaque  envelopes. 
Regarding to the nature of the study, the patients and the 
clinician  were  not  blinded  whereas  outcome  assessors 
and data analysts were blinded to the allocation.

To  design  virtual  scenarios,  studies  conducted  on  vir-
tual reality treatment for OCD especially contamination 
subtype  were  reviewed  and  since  the  scenarios  could 
not  be  used  considering  Iranian  culture,  some  culture-
dependent scenarios were developed in two steps. In the 
first  step,  the  content  of  the  scenarios  was  determined 
and approved by one psychiatrist and three clinical psy-
chologists according to the objectives of the study and in 
the  second  step,  the  scenarios  were  developed.  The  VR 
environments  resembled  the  average  Iranian  home  and 
were designed to induce contamination impulses.

Participants

Sixty-nine  patients  aged  18-50 years,  with  a  clinical 
diagnosis  of  OCD  based  on  the  Diagnostic  and  Statisti-
cal  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  5th  Edition  (DSM-5) 
criteria  were  primarily  screened  but  36  patients  were 
recruited  and  randomly  assigned  to  the  intervention 
(N = 18) and the control (N = 18) groups; out of which, 29 
patients completed the study (Table 1). All of the patients 
enrolled  in  the  study  were  assessed  considering  DSM-5 
through  a  structured  clinical  interview  by  a  psychiatrist 
for  the  inclusion  criteria  [27].  Following  their  informed 
consent,  each  participant  was  clinically  interviewed  to 
assess whether the candidate’s symptoms were consistent 
with  OCD  and  whether  the  current  primary  obsession 
was contamination, and to characterize OCD symptoms. 
The  exclusion  criteria  included:  1)  having  a  current  or 
history  of  auditory  or  visual  impairment;  2)  traumatic 
brain  injury;  3)  severe  neurologic  illness;  4)  severe  per-
sonality  and  psychotic  disorders;  5)  substance  abuse  or 
dependence; and 6) bipolar disorder. During the trial, the 
patients were not allowed to receive any parallel psycho-
therapy. Also, the dosage and type of medication did not 
change. The  trial  flow  diagram  and  number  of  dropouts 
are represented in Fig. 1.

A  12-week,  randomized,  single-blinded,  parallel-group 
trial  was  performed  at  the  outpatient  clinics  of  Tehran 
Institute  of  Psychiatry  (affiliated  with  Iran  University  of 
Medical  Sciences,  Tehran,  Iran)  from  October  2021  to 
January 2022. Randomization process was done by Excel 
2007  using  random  block  sizes  of  4  resulting  in  18  par-
ticipants in each group. The random allocation sequence 
was done by one co-researcher who was not involved in 

Interventions

Eligible  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  the 
intervention  or  control  groups  for  12 weeks.  Cognitive-
behavioral  therapy  was  performed  according  to  Leahy 
and  Hollands’  treatment  plans  and  interventions  for 
OCD  [28].  The  participants  completed  several  self-
report  measures  such  as  the  Yale-Brown  Obsessive-
Compulsive  Scale,  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II,  Beck

Anxiety  Inventory,  Obsessive  beliefs  Questionnaire-44, 
and  World  Health  Organization  Disability  Assessment 
Scale-2 in week 0, week 12, and 3 months after the end of 
the treatment. The first three sessions were dedicated to 
case formulation, introducing treatment plans and OCD, 
collecting  information  about  obsessive  fears  and  rituals, 
and developing an exposure hierarchy of anxiety-provok-
ing situations.

The first exposure sessions were related to mild anx-
iety-provoking  situations  and  gradually  progressed  to 

situations that caused more anxiety. At each stage, the 
patients expressed the level of anxiety on a scale from 0 
to 100 after every 5 minutes. When the patients’ subjec-
tive evaluation of the anxiety decreased, and they could 
tolerate  the  anxiety  well  at  that  stage,  they  shift  to  the 
next most anxiogenic scenario. Each session began with 
a review of the material of the previous session, home-
work,  self-monitoring  of  obsessions  and  compulsion, 
and  cognitive  challenging  of  dysfunctional  thoughts.

The content of sessions in both groups are presented in 
Tables 2 and 3.

In the intervention group, VR equipment was used for 
exposure  including  software  and  hardware.  Considering 
the  hardware,  a  personal  desktop  computer  and  a  color 
head-mounted  display  (HMD)  with  a  3-degrees-of-free-
dom  tracker  was  used.  VR  environment  was  designed 
by  Pishgaman  Vagheiat  Majazi  Iranian  (Ravana)  Com-
pany  (https:// ravan avr. com/).  The  screen  view  was  from 
a  first-person  perspective.  In  the  software,  each  part  of 

the home was designed in a way to represent a degree of 
contamination different from the other parts to give the 
therapist  and  the  patient  the  freedom  to  gradually  (not 
suddenly) be exposed to the contamination.

In  the  virtual  reality  program  of  the  current  research, 
two  environments  with  moderate  and  severe  dirt  were 
designed. The participants used a joystick and tracker to 
move  through  the  virtual  environment,  which  included 
the  corridor,  the  reception  room,  the  kitchen,  the  bath-
room  and  the  toilet.  By  clicking  the  start  button,  the

participants  entered  the  virtual  environment  and  dur-
ing the exposure, they expressed their subjective units of 
distress  scale  (SUDS)  using  the  range  of  1  to  10.  In  the 
first  session,  in  order  to  get  familiar  with  the  tools  and 
equipment of the virtual environment, after entering the 
environment, the participants received instructions such 
as  walking  around  the  house,  entering  the  reception, 
walking in the kitchen and reception and reaching to the 
bathroom door, opening the bathroom door and entering 
it.

In subsequent sessions, the participants were gradually 
exposed to fearful stimuli according to the designed hier-
archy. Different parts of the house included objects that 
triggered  obsessive  thoughts  of  contamination.  In  each 
environment,  there  were  all  kinds  of  interactive  objects 
that  the  participants  had  to  look  at  closely,  move  them, 
touch  them  with  a  virtual  hand,  or  put  them  together. 
For example, in the virtual environment of the kitchen, in 
the initial sessions, the patients touched objects that had 
the least amount of contamination, such as containers in 

Javaherirenani et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:740

the refrigerator, oven, kitchen cabinets, the floor and the 
walls of the kitchen. In the middle sessions, they encoun-
tered  and  touched  objects  that  had  an  average  level  of 
contamination, including eating utensils, knives, spoons, 
and forks.

In  the  last  sessions,  they  touched  objects  having  a 
higher  level  of  contamination,  such  as  dustbin,  rotten 
fruits in containers, etc. Each task was repeated and con-
tinued until the level of anxiety decreased or disappeared. 
In the virtual environment, the participants were not able 
to perform compulsive behaviors and could not get rid of 
the  dirt  and  contamination.  For  example,  water  did  not 
come out of the kitchen faucet. By clicking the end but-
ton, the participants left the virtual reality environment. 
The weekly exposure sessions lasted about 25 to 45 min-
utes. Between sessions, the patients were encouraged to 
expose  anxiety-provoking  stimuli  and  situations  at  least 
once  a  day,  to  reproduce  the  actions  experienced  in  the 
virtual  environment  in  real  life,  and  to  gradually  elimi-
nate rituals and compulsive behaviors in their daily life.

Outcome measures

Several  instruments  were  used  considering  the  objec-
tives  of  the  study.  The  first  instrument  of  the  study  was 
Y-BOCS used to assess the severity of obsessive-compul-
sive  symptoms  [29–31]  of  the  patients  at  week  0,  week 
12,  and  after  3 months  follow-up.  This  scale  includes  10 
items that are rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme 
symptoms) [32]. The psychometric properties of the Per-
sian  version  of  Y-BOCS  were  approved  in  the  previous 
studies  and  optimal  levels  of  internal  consistency  scores 
(symptom  checklist  0.97,  severity  scale  0.95),  split-half 
reliability  (symptom  checklist  0.93,  severity  scale  0.89), 
and test-retest reliability (0.99) were estimated [33]. The 
total  score  of  the  Y-BOCS  difference  between  week  0, 
week  12,  and  3 months  follow-up  was  the  primary  out-
come measure of the trial.

The second outcome measure was BDI-II used to assess 
the severity of depression symptoms. BDI-II is a 21-ques-
tion multiple-choice self-report inventory  in  which high 
total  scores  indicate  more  severe  depressive  symptoms 
(0–13:  minimal,  14-19:  mild,  20-28:  moderate,  29-63: 
severe)  [34].  BDI-II-Persian  version  has  a  high  internal 
consistency  (α = .87)  and  test-retest  reliability  (r = 0.74) 
[35].

Also, BAI was applied to assess the severity of anxiety 
symptoms.  The  BAI  consists  of  21  questions  which  are 
rated  from  0  (not  at  all)  to  3  (severely)  in  which  higher 
total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms (0–7: 
minimal, 8-15: mild, 16-25: moderate, 26-63: severe) [36].
the  Obsessive  Beliefs 
Questionnaire  (OBQ-44)  which  was  used  to  assess 
beliefs  which  are  important  in  the  development  and 

instrument  was 

Another 

maintenance of OCD. OBQ-44 is rated 1(completely dis-
agree) to 7(completely agree) [37].

Moreover,  WHODAS-2  was  used  to  assess  disability 
in 6 areas. This scale has 36 items which are rated from 
(1:  without  disability,  2:  minimal  disability,  3:  moderate 
disability, 4: severe disability, and 5: extremely severe dis-
ability) [38]. The Persian version of WHODAS-2 demon-
strated  the  appropriate  internal  consistency  (78%)  and 
Cronbach’s alpha (95%) [39].

Finally,  There  was  no  difference  in  characteristics 
between  the  two  groups  and  the  analysis  showed  that 
there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between 
the two groups (Table 4).

Sample size and statistical analyses

G-Power software version 3.1.9.2 [40] was used to com-
pare  two  independent  means  and  28  participants  were 
calculated  as  the  sample  size  (14  in  each  group).  Con-
sidering  a  drop-out  rate  of  30%,  medium  effect  size 
(d  = 0.25),  beta  0.2,  and  alpha  0.5,  the  sample  size  was 
calculated  36  (18  in  each  group).  All  statistical  analy-
ses  were  done  using  SPSS  version  18.  Comparison  of 
Y-BOCS scores as the primary outcome in the interven-
tion and control groups in each assessment (week 0, week 
12, and 3 months follow-up) was made using the repeated 
measure analysis of variances. Continuous variables were 
reported by mean ± SD and categorical variables by num-
ber (%). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be 
significant.

effects  in  the  use  of  VR  [41].  Also,  repeated  exposure 
can  result  in  habituation  and  the  adverse  effects  reduce 
between  1  to  7 days  due  to  the  adaptation  to  the  virtual 
environment  [42]  and  [43].  Some  guidelines  are  used  in 
this  trial  to  minimize  the  side  effects  in  the  VR  setting 
[44]. These included:

-  Waiting  15 min  after  any  exposure  and  not  carrying 
out  sensitive  tasks  such  as  driving,  crossing  the  street, 
and going up and down the stairs.

- Informing the participants about the adverse effects of 
VR to reduce anxiety and fear about this new experience.
-  Providing  complete  training  about  the  use  of  input 

devices and coaching the patients.

-  Providing  the  confidence  that  the  participant  could 

terminate the exposure at any time.

- Monitoring patients about some signs and behaviors 
during  VR  exposure  such  as  sweating,  pallor,  fidgeting 
with  HMD,  looking  away  from  the  display,  and  closing 
eyes.

Observing  these  guidelines  made  the  side  effects  mild 
but  two  participants  did  not  complete  the  treatment  in 
the intervention group because they experienced nausea, 
headache, and dizziness.

Y-BOCS, Y-BOCS obsession subscale, Y-BOCS compulsion 
subscale, BDI-II, BAI, OBQ-44 and WHODAS-2 total score 
trend for each group during the trial course

The  results  of  repeated  measure  analysis  of  variances 
indicated that the total Y-BOCS score was significantly 
different  between  the  groups  (F  = 60.97,  P  < 0.001, 

partial  eta  squared = 0.82)  (Fig.  2,  Table  5).  Also,  the 
total Y-BOCS obsession subscale score was significantly 
different between the two groups (F = 20.46, P < 0.001, 
partial  eta  squared = 0.61).  Moreover,  there  was  a  sig-
nificant  difference  between  the  intervention  and  the 
control  groups  in  total  Y-BOCS  compulsion  subscale 
score (F = 29.57, P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.69).

In  the  follow-up,  the  total  score  of  Y-BOCS  had  less 
return to the week 0 score in both groups. The findings 
of  repeated  measure  analysis  of  variances  revealed  no 
significant  difference  in  the  BDI-II  between  the  inter-
vention  and  control  groups  (F  = 0.54,  P  = 0.47,  partial 
eta  squared = 0.02)  (Fig.  3,  Table  5).  In  the  follow-up, 
the  total  score  of  BDI-II  had  less  return  to  the  week  0 
score in both groups. Also, there was no significant dif-
ference in total BAI score between the groups regarding 
the  results  of  repeated  measure  analysis  of  variances 
(F  = 3.12,  P  = 0.06,  partial  eta  squared = 0.19)  (Fig.  4, 
Table 5). In the follow-up, the total score of BAI did not 
return to week 0 and therapeutic gains were maintained 
3 months after the treatment in the intervention group.
The  results  of  repeated  measure  analysis  of  vari-
ances  showed  a  significant  difference  in  the  OBQ-
44  between  the  intervention  and  the  control  groups 
(F = 16.78, P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.56) (Fig. 5, 
Table  5).  In  the  follow-up,  the  total  score  of  OBQ-44 
slightly  decreased  in  the  intervention  group  while  it 
did  not  change  in  the  control  group.  Finally,  the  find-
ings of repeated measure analysis of variances revealed 
in  the  WHODAS-2  score 
a  significant  difference

Discussion
The  objective  of  the  present  study  was  to  evaluate  the 
effectiveness of virtual reality exposure and response pre-
vention  (VRERP)  in  the  treatment  of  OCD  contamina-
tion  subtype. The  results  of  the  study  indicated  that  VR 
technology can be an effective treatment for OCD.

The  findings  revealed  that  CBT  using  VRERP  signifi-
cantly  improved  the  severity  of  OCD  symptoms  in  the 
intervention group compared to the control group. These 
results  are  in  line  with  previous  studies.  For  example, 
Laforest  et  al.  [13]  suggested  that  contaminated  virtual 

environments  can  trigger  and  increase  anxiety  in  OCD 
patients.  Also,  Laforest  et  al.  [23]  found  that  VRET  can 
improve the usefulness of CBT for contamination-related 
OCD.  Belloch  et  al.  [26]  used  VR  exposure  on  patients 
with  contamination-based  OCD  and  found  that  their 
anxiety levels increased as the level of dirtiness of the vir-
tual environment increased. In addition, Inozu et al. [24] 
stated that repeated exposure to the VR environment can 
decrease  the  symptom  severity  of  OCD,  especially  the 
contamination fear.

It is essential to mention that Immersion is one of the 
most  important  features  of  virtual  reality,  that  is,  the 
patient  is  immersed  in  the  virtual  world  and  can  see  all 
the  details  of  the  surrounding  environment  just  like  in 
the  real  world.  The  goal  of  virtual  reality  therapy  is  to 
provide deliberate and prolonged exposure of the patient 
to an anxiety-provoking situation and prevent the associ-
ated avoidance response. The patient experiences anxiety 
in the short term, but through the process of extinction 
in  frequent  exposure  sessions,  he  or  she  experiences  a 
reduction in anxiety and avoidance.

On  the  other  hand,  virtual  reality  causes  step-by-step 
exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli in a controlled and 
more  realistic  way  than  imaginal  exposure  as  well  as  a 
more realistic and safer environment than in vivo expo-
sure [25]. This reduces the patient’s distress and increases 
the success of the patient’s treatment. Instead of experi-
encing the difficulties of an in vivo or imaginal environ-
ment, patients enter the virtual world with more comfort 

 Javaherirenani et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:740

and  confidence  and  learn  how  to  overcome  their  obses-
sions [45].

two groups, so the reduction of obsessive behaviors and 
beliefs can be due to the effect of the intervention.

The  therapist  guides  the  participant  in  each  moment 
and  tells  them  what  to  do.  Also,  due  to  the  flexibility  of 
the  virtual  environment,  the  therapist  can  design  the 
environment according to the patient’s needs, creating a 
sense  of  presence  and  interaction  and  better  treatment 
results.

The current clinical trial did not demonstrate a signifi-
cant difference in the improvement of depression symp-
tom severity between the two groups. There was a slight 
reduction in the depressive symptoms which was consist-
ent with the results of the study showing that changes in 
OCD  symptoms  did  not  significantly  reduce  depression 
symptoms [46].

Previous research has not presented conclusive results 
considering  the  effects  of  OCD  treatment  on  reducing 
depression  symptoms.  Obsessive-compulsive  disorder 
and  depression  are  both  separate  disorders  with  differ-
ent developmental histories as well as underlying factors. 
Also,  the  severity  of  depression  symptoms,  the  number 
of  years  since  the  onset  of  the  disorder,  and  its  genetic 
background are involved in the recovery rate of patients’ 
depression symptoms.

The  lack  of  difference  between  the  two  treatment 
groups  in  reducing  the  level  of  depression  is  mainly 
because the depression of these patients is secondary to 
their obsessive-compulsive disorder while the content of 
treatment sessions are mainly focused on reducing obses-
sive symptoms.

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the 
reduction of anxiety symptoms between the groups. Some 
research  indicates  that  virtual  reality  technology  along 
with  relaxation  and  anxiety  management  techniques 
plays  a  significant  role  in  improving  anxiety  symptoms 
[47], while in the current research, virtual reality technol-
ogy  was  not  accompanied  by  the  mentioned  techniques 
and in the exposure sessions, the patient was confronted 
with  anxiety-provoking  objects  and  situations.  Also,  in 
obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  stimulating  anxiety  and 
breaking  the  connection  between  anxiety  and  obsessive 
behaviors of patients is considered the main rule of expo-
sure  therapy.  Therefore,  a  longer  period  of  treatment  is 
needed to reduce anxiety levels significantly [48].

Moreover,  research  results  show  that  if  people  are 
faced  with  scenarios  that  are  specific  to  their  problems 
and  complaints,  a  significant  reduction  in  their  anxiety 
level occurs, but it is difficult to measure this change by 
self-report  tools  because  these  tools  measure  the  gen-
eral anxiety [24]. As a result, the reduction of depression 
and  anxiety  was  not  significantly  different  between  the 

Nonetheless,  the  findings  showed  a  significant  dif-
ference  in  the  reduction  of  obsessional  thoughts  in  the 
intervention  group  compared  to  those  of  the  control 
group.  These  findings  suggest  that  frequent  exposure  to 
feared stimuli can change cognition, behavior, as well as 
physical and emotional responses. In fact, with VRET, the 
therapist can customize the virtual reality content to the 
patient’s  fears  and  then,  guide  and  support  the  patients 
while  supervising  them  in  the  virtual  environment.  The 
patients are involved in the scenario and they can practice 
anxiety  management  skills  in  a  safe  virtual  environment 
before  being  exposed  to  the  feared  stimuli  in  real  situa-
tions. After each VR exposure, the therapist and patients 
discuss the SUDS scores and patient’s experiences in the 
virtual environment, such as what the patient learns, how 
their dysfunctional beliefs have been corrected, and how 
their expectations regarding the feared stimuli have been 
rejected [49, 50].

Also,  the  findings 

indicated  that  the 

intervention 
reduced the severity of disability in the intervention group 
more  significantly  than  that  in  the  control  group.  The 
results of this research were consistent with previous stud-
ies  [51–53]  showing  that  there  is  a  relationship  between 
the  severity  of  OCD  symptoms  and  the  level  of  perfor-
mance  and  ability  of  the  individuals  since  patients  with 
OCD  lose  about  2.5%  of  their  life  due  to  disability  [54]. 
Therefore, improving OCD symptoms can lead to positive 
changes  in  the  patient’s  social  and  professional  activities, 
increased self-efficacy, and reduced restrictions [55].

Virtual  reality  directs  the  patient’s  attention  and  con-
centration  to  the  virtual  environment  intended  by  the 
therapist  by  involving  them  in  images,  colors,  sounds, 
touchpads, audio and visual screens as well as providing 
movement and real physical activity, and creates a sense 
of presence. Through the sense of presence, patients can 
easily experience anxiety in the virtual environment, and 
the responses needed to face the situation are created in 
the  individuals,  assisting  them  to  have  better  and  more 
efficient performance and mastery in social situations [4].
In  addition  to,  by  breaking  the  pattern  of  avoidance 
behavior  and  increasing  the  individual’s  belief  in  their 
own  abilities  and  competences,  VRET  increases  the 
patient’s  motivation  to  move  forward  in  the  exposure 
process  and  thus  reduces  the  patient’s  disability  [56]. 
In  fact,  people  with  OCD  underestimate  their  ability  to 
cope  with  fear  and  anxiety.  When  they  can  endure  anx-
iety-provoking  situations  without  avoidance,  their  sense 
of self-efficacy and ability increases because they realize 
their abilities and capacities [57].

Finally, with the improvement of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder,  positive  changes  occur  in  various  aspects  of  a 
person’s life, including daily activities, social and occupa-
tional activities. Furthermore, the reduction of symptoms 
and  subsequently,  the reduction of avoidance  associated 
with  this  disorder  will  remove  the  limitations  caused  by 
the disorder, including limited relationships or enjoyable 
social activities and increase professional activities.

Strengths and limitations

This study was a randomized controlled trial with a clini-
cal  sample  diagnosed  with  OCD  contamination  subtype 
that provided the promising results in favor of the effec-
tiveness of the VRERP in the treatment OCD. The use of 
contaminated  environment  can  enhance  the  interven-
tion results through VR’s potential to provoke high anxi-
ety in the participants as if they were in the really feared 
situations. The study findings can be used as an evidence-
based intervention protocol to improve the literature and 
make a noticeable contribution to the treatment of OCD.
However, despite its advantages, this trial was not with-
out  limitations.  A  single  blinded  study  has  an  intrinsic 
bias.  Study  participants  expected  a  positive  potential 
effect  of  the  intervention.  Participants  who  are  favora-
ble to VR or new therapeutic intervention are likely to be 
participating  in  the  study,  and  the  control  group  might 
be disappointed or slightly discouraged from undergoing 
treatment.  In  fact,  control  intervention  of  CBT  is  good 
but  disappointing  in  patients  with  expectations  of  new 
therapy. This aspect might explain why the control group 
showed less efficacy than the intervention group.

In addition, symptom assessment tools were not objec-
tive  and  BDI,  BAI,  and  YBOC  were  all  questionnaires 
indeed.  Using  objective  tools  or  blinded  assessment  cli-
nicians, participants’ behavior in the virtual space could 
be measured for the assessment of OCD symptoms such 
as: How long did participants look at or look off the dirt 
or  disorganized  space  (avoidance,  compliance  of  ERP)? 
How  anxious  participants  feel  by  measuring  heart  rate, 
respiratory  rate  or  skin  conduction  test(anxiety)?  How 
often  did  they  try  to  get  rid  of  dirt  or  the  delay  time  to 
the virtual ritual (compliance of ERP)? How well did they 
perform  a  target  task  (simple  control  task,  for  example, 
searching for necessary item to clear a mission, solving a 
problem etc.).

The  lack  of  how  to  get  rid  of  dirts  in  the  virtual  envi-
ronment  would  make  a  participant  anxious.  It  is  differ-
ent  that  there  is  no  mean,  and  there  is  a  mean  but  they 
choose not to do. No means to get rid of dirt would have 
positive  effects  for  the  participant  who  bears  anxiety 
well, and the experience of a small success would propa-
gate into the in vivo exposure-response prevention in the 
homework.  However,  participants  who  could  not  bear 

anxiety without compulsive behavior options might drop 
out  of  the  VR  session  instead  of  performing  compulsive 
behavior.  Failure  of  ERP  would  be  allowed  in  the  VR 
program. More people with OCD will participate in the 
intervention and become familiar with the VR-based ERP 
training and eventually get relieved.

In  addition,  most  of  the  participants  were  female,  so 
the results should be generalized with caution. Moreover, 
in the virtual scenarios, there was no odor contamination 
to trigger more anxiety. Another limitation was the simu-
lator sickness including dizziness, nausea, headache, and 
eyestrain.

Implications for practice and research

Application  of  diverse  and  personalized  virtual  envi-
ronments  simulated  to  the  patient’s  feared  stimuli  can 
improve the findings of the future studies. Experimenters 
prevent compulsive behavior from happening by chance. 
This is impossible in the session (in vivo ERP). If the VR 
program  reinforces  ERP  behavior  by  providing  a  posi-
tive stimulus, compulsive behavior is omitted by chance 
(operant  conditioning,  variable  ratio  positive  reinforce-
ment).  VR-based  ERP  contains  more  potential  based  on 
behavioral  science,  which  is  not  applicable  in  conven-
tional CBT-OCD.

finally, it is suggested to replicate the methodology with 
a  more  diverse  sample  in  a  double-blind,  randomized 
trial. It would also be interesting to develop VR for other 
subtypes  of  OCD.  Future  research  with  VRERP  can  use 
some  components  such  as  odor  to  provoke  more  anxi-
ety.  Finally,  other  studies  can  be  conducted  with  longer 
follow-up  periods  to  better  evaluate  the  maintenance  of 
therapeutic  gains.  It  is  recommended  to  use  VR  in  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  with  OCD  in  the  therapeutic  set-
ting since the sample was completely composed of adults.

Conclusion
The results showed that VR can be an appropriate, new 
and promising tool in the treatment of this subtype and 
can  improve  the  effectiveness  of  CBT.  Following  these 
considerations, our results support the potential of VR 
in  the  treatment  of  OCD.  VRERP  in  the  session  may 
encourage participants to jump into the in vivo EPR in 
the  real  world  by  the  forced  success  experience.  It  can 
be  a  esasy  alternative  of  ERP  exposure  but  there  is  no 
means  to  engage  in  compulsive  behaviors.  It  is  very 
interesting  and  promising  because  OCD  is  quite  dif-
ficult  to  treat  by  pharmacotherapy  or  CBT  compared 
to  depression  and  anxiety  disorders.  Finally,  it  should 
be  mentioned  that  although  VR  was  effective  in  the 
assessment  and  treatment  of  OCD,  its  use  is  still  lim-
ited and in the primary stage. Therefore, more research

is needed to increase the evidence regarding the effec-
tiveness of using this new technology in the therapeutic 
and clinical settings.
