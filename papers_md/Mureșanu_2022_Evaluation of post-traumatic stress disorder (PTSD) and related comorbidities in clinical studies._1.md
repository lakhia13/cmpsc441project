ABSTRACT
Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of  varying severities are experiencing adverse outcomes during and af-
ter  rehabilitation.  Besides  depression  and  anxiety,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  highly  encountered  in 
civilian and military populations. As more prospective and retrospective studies – focused on evaluating new or old 
psychological therapies in inpatient, outpatient, or controlled environments, targeting patients with PTSD with or 
without a history of  TBI – are carried out, researchers are employing various scales to measure PTSD as well as other 
psychiatric diagnoses or cognitive impairments that might appear following TBI. We aimed to explore the literature 
published between January 2010 and October 2021 by querying three databases. Our preliminary results showed that 
several scales – such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 
Military Version (PCL-M) as well as Specific Version (PCL-S), and Civilian Version (PCL-C) – have been frequent-
ly  used  for  PTSD  diagnosis  and  symptom  severity.  However,  heterogeneity  in  the  scales  used  when  assessing  and 
evaluating additional psychiatric comorbidities and cognitive impairments are due to the study aim and therapeutic 
approaches. Therefore, conducting an intervention focusing on post-TBI PTSD patients requires increased attention 
to patients' medical history in capturing multiple cognitive impairments and affected neuropsychological processes 
when designing the study and including validated instruments for measuring primary and secondary neuropsycho-
logical outcomes.

Traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI)  is  a  burdening  condition  in 
both acute and chronic phases, with patients exhibiting post-TBI 
outcomes that affect their overall functioning [1], return to soci-
ety [2], and inflict a socio-economic burden on their caregivers 
[3,  4].  It  represents  a  major  public  health  problem  that  causes 
over 27 million new cases worldwide within a year, putting tre-
mendous pressure on health systems in low-and middle-income 
countries (which have the highest-burden regarding the number 
of  cases) and high-income countries alike [5].

Post-TBI, patients (regardless of  TBI severity) [6, 7] are at 
increased  risk  of   developing  several  psychopathologies,  such  as 
anxiety  [8],  depression  [9],  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD) [10], among other TBI-related side effects.

In the fifth edition of  the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of  Mental Disorders (DSM-V), PTSD is defined by several char-
acteristics grouped under seven major categories, which focus on 
exposure  (to  a  life-threatening  or  traumatic  event),  timing  and 
presence  of   PTSD  symptoms,  interaction  with  PTSD-related 
triggers, the evolution of  adverse effects tied with the traumat-
ic  event  (on  cognition  and  mood),  arousal  and  reactivity  trau-
ma-related alteration, disturbance persistence, as well as distur-
bance-related  consequences  on  functional  impairments  (such 
as  occupational  and  social)  and  the  clear  delimitation  that  the 
PTSD diagnostic is not caused by medication intake or alcohol 
consumption  [11].  In  addition,  the  prevalence  of   PTSD  cases 
(reported in community-based studies) diagnosed within the last 
6 or 12 months is higher in women than men, and there are more 
cases diagnosed when the DSM-IV PTSD criteria are used and 
fewer with the DSM-5 version [12].

In civilian populations, PTSD can be reported following a 
wide  range  of   traumatic  events.  WHO  World  Mental  Health 
(WMH) surveys represent important tools in quantifying mental 
health  impairments  in  the  general  population.  A  2017  second-
ary  analysis  using  WHO  WMH  data  reports  that  trauma  was 
reported by 70.4% of  participants (out of  the total, 42.7% was 
due  to  intimate  partner  sexual  violence,  13.1%  was  caused  by 
rape, 15.1% by sexual assault, and 9.8% caused by stalking [13]).
The PTSD rates differ in military and civilian populations 
with  a  medical  history  of   TBI  than  those  without  a  TBI.  For 
example,  3.3%  more  civilians  (15.7%)  and  26%  more  military 
participants  (36.8%)  were  diagnosed  with  post-TBI  PTSD. 
Post-TBI  PTSD  was  mostly  registered  among  men  (61%  vs. 
96%), aged between 35.4 and 31.5 years old, in civilian and mil-
itary participants [14]. 

Based  on  the  period  of   the  armed  conflict,  studies  show 
that the lowest percentage of  combat diagnosed PTSD is among 
Gulf   War  veterans  (10%)  [15],  while  the  highest  among  mil-
itary  service  personnel  who  participated  in  conflicts  in  Iraq  or 
Afghanistan (13.2%) [16]. 

Recent  evidence  shows  that  patients  diagnosed  only  with 
PTSD  or  TBI  exhibit  similar  sleep  problems  (decreased  sleep 
time,  continuity,  and  efficiency  –  PTSD  patients;  insomnia, 
narcolepsy,  post-traumatic  hypersomnia  –  TBI  patients)  [17]. 
However, TBI severity plays an important factor as higher sleep 
disturbances are encountered in diagnosed PTSD patients with 
moderate or severe TBI than in milder TBI cases [18]. Another 
study on sleep quality comparing cohorts formed of  healthy con-
trols, veterans with PTSD with mild TBI, and with PTSD only 
showed that subjects from the second group reported more often 
sleepiness during the day (although they were awake less during 
the night) compared to the other two groups [19].

Cnossen and colleagues conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis  on  predictors  for  PTSD  and  major  depression 
(MD) in patients with TBI history. The authors reported an as-
sociation between PTSD development and a smaller duration of  
PTA  (post-traumatic  amnesia),  and  remembrance  of   the  event 
defined as traumatic [20].

A  growing  body  of   literature  suggests  that  patients  diag-
nosed with PTSD following a traumatic brain injury can benefit 
from  various  pharmacological  and  psychological  therapies.  In 
terms of  pharmacological alternatives, selective serotonin re-up-
take  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  and  tricyclic  antidepressants  proved  to 
reduce PTSD symptom severity [21], while antipsychotic med-
icines,  such  as  risperidone  and  quetiapine,  have  small  positive 
benefits  when  included  in  the  treatment  regimen  [22].  As  for 
psychological  interventions,  prolonged  exposure  (PE)  and  cog-
nitive-processing therapies [23] and meditation-based therapies 
[24] have positive outcomes.

There are systematic reviews aiming to evaluate, extract and 
analyze data from articles on the epidemiological type of  PTSD 
[25] on the effect of  pharmacological and psychological therapies 
in patients with PTSD due to TBI [23]. However, other reviews 
included studies on psychological therapies for PTSD along with 
other post-TBI pathologies (i.e., anxiety, depression) [21] or have 
been focusing on a specific therapy [24]. We identified a gap in 
the literature regarding the presence of  a review (literature, nar-
rative, systematic) focusing on scales that measure primary and 
secondary outcomes as well as those used in PTSD screening for 
this target group. Therefore, through this brief  literature review, 
we aimed to map instruments used to screen and measure neu-
ropsychological post-TBI status in civilians, veterans, and active 
service military members who received different therapies.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

We queried three databases for our brief  literature review: 
PubMed, Scopus, and PsycNET. Our search focused on articles 
published  between  January  2010  and  October  2021.  We  in-
cluded quantitative articles published in English that measured 
PTSD as a primary or secondary study outcome. We excluded 
articles  based  on  the  following  criteria:  qualitative  studies  pub-
lished in another language than English, abstracts, letters to the 
editor,  comments,  epidemiological  articles,  psychological  inter-
ventions  focusing  solely  on  other  post-TBI  psychological  disor-
ders  (i.e.,  anxiety,  depression),  study  protocols,  lack  of   applied 
scales, lack of  abstract, and abstract written in English while the 
main body in of  the article was published in another language. 
We did not apply a geographical limitation. In order to retrieve 
articles for our review, we used the following terms: "psycholog-
ical  interventions",  "traumatic  brain  injury",  "TBI",  "PTSD", 
"therapy",  "psychological  treatment",  "psychotherapy",  "mind-
fulness", "CBT". For the search strategy conducted on PubMed, 
we  employed  MeSH  terms.  In  addition,  we  used  two  boolean 
terms:  "AND"  was used to narrow  the search  while "OR" was 
used to expand the search. The search, abstract, title screening, 
and data extraction were conducted by the main author (IAM). 
In the first phase, articles were screened by title and abstract. In 
the second phase, the full-text screening of  the included articles 
was performed. Data extraction was completed for the remaining 
articles from the second screening in the third phase.

We  extracted  data  on  the  listed  items:  title,  author,  year, 
country, university, intervention, sample size, population, inclu-
sion  and  exclusion  criteria,  and  scales  used  for  screening  and

study characteristics (year, country, therapy, and population) were 
presented descriptively, and other methodological characteristics 
of  study tools usage were briefly summarized.

RESULTS

Our final selection included seventeen studies, 16 were con-
ducted in the USA and one in the United Kingdom. The sample 
size  ranged  from  224  participants  for  a  randomized  controlled 
trial (RCT) involving veterans and their family members to one 
participant for two case study reports. Our study was primarily 
based on randomized controlled trials and comparative effective-
ness  studies.  As  for  the  target  population,  most  studies  focused 
on  psychological  interventions  among  veterans,  and  only  two 
included civilians, with one focusing on both veterans and their 
family  members.  In  addition,  studies  reported  results  on  sever-
al types of  therapies: prolonged exposure, Cognitive Processing 
Therapy (CPT), Cognitive Processing Therapy - Cognitive Only 
(CPT-C),  art  therapy,  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy, 
Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR),  SMART-CPT, 
therapeutic  horseback  riding,  and  cognitive  behavioral  therapy 
(CBT). Table 1 compiles study characteristics. 

The PTSD checklist was used in studies focusing on pro-
longed  exposure  (PE)  delivery  in  outpatient  and  inpatient 
settings.  The  first  included  article  on  PE  had  a  study  sample 
of   ten  veterans  with  a  mean  age  of   33.1  years  and  medical 
history of  cognitive deficits, PTSD, and TBI. The PCL – mil-
itary version was used only at two-time points: screening and 
final session [28]. In 2015, an article with a similar aim eval-
uated the effect of  PE in a sample with the following charac-
teristics: 69 participants (n veterans=51, n active-duty service 
members=18) with a mean age of  34.01 and having a history 
of  TBI (mild=52, moderate/severe=17). The PTSD checklist 
PCL was employed at screening and during each session of  the 
intervention [32]. In a different study, the PCL-S version was 
used before and after the intervention in a sample of  41 vet-
erans (composing two study cohorts: 19 within the PTSD and 
TBI group, and 22 with PTSD, without a history of  TBI), out 
of  which 20 received individual CPT and 21 PE [34]. In each 
of  the abovementioned studies, PE was an effective therapy for 
veterans with PTSD.

Walter, Kiefer & Chard demonstrated that veterans partici-
pating in group and individual CPT-C had decreased PTSD-re-
lated symptoms. The sample included 28 veterans with an average 
age of  36 years and a history of  TBI (n mTBI=24, n moderate 
TBI=4). The PCL – S was used pre-and post-treatment [29].

post  mixed  design  involving  nine  veterans  (aged  27–58  years) 
with mild TBI (and an average of  2.1 TBI events per patient), 
PTSD, and cognitive impairments. Participants were assessed at 
three-time points: two weeks before and after the start of  the in-
tervention as well as three months following completion. Scores 
for  PCL-C  highlighted  a  large  effect  size  both  at  the  immedi-
ate post-MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) and three 
months post-intervention [33].

Therapeutic  horseback  riding  was  used  in  a  randomized 
wait-list  controlled  study  to  assess  its  effectiveness  in  reducing 
PTSD symptoms as well as targeting emotional regulation and 
loneliness, among others. Assessments were carried out at three-
time  points  (baseline  and  at  weeks  3  and  6).  Results  showed  a 
statistically significant decline in PCL-M scores at the second and 
third assessments [37].

A  comparison  between  two  groups  receiving  standard-of-
care and emotional freedom techniques (EFT) showed that veter-
ans allocated to the EFT group reported improvements in PTSD 
symptoms  (that  were  measured  at  baseline  and  throughout  the 
study with PCL-M) [30].

Tanev  et  al.  investigated  if   the  poor  pretreatment  cogni-
tive performance and CBT treatment response were associated 
in  a  group  of   23  veterans  and  active  service  members,  with  a 
mean age of  32.39, divided into a PTSD-only cohort (n=7) and 
a  PTSD  +  mild  TBI  cohort  (n=16).  They  concluded  that  de-
creased cognitive ability did not predict poorer CBT results for 
PTSD  symptoms.  Participants  filled  in  the  checklist  before  the 
intervention (baseline), during the intervention (at each CBT ses-
sion), and post-intervention (1 and 6 months after completing the 
intervention) [42].

Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was used in a study by 
Chard et al. involving 47 veterans/active service members. The 
mean age was 33.93 for participants with mild TBI (n=28) and 
38.07 for moderate/severe TBI (n=14). The PCL was adminis-
tered before and after the CPT intervention [26].

Data on the comparative effectiveness of  CPT and trauma-fo-
cused group treatment as usual (TAU) analyzed for 207 veterans 
(n CPT=104, n TAU=93) by Alvarez et al. reported that post-dis-
charge veterans from the CPT group exhibit increased symptom 
improvement compared to TAU. The mean age was 52.23 [27].

Out of  100 veterans included in the study by Jak et al., 51 re-
ceived SMART-CPT and 49 CPT, with a mean age of  34.39 years, 
5.36  years  since  the  last  TBI,  and  on  average  2.81  traumatic 
brain  injuries.  Both  interventions  decreased  PTSD  symptoms, 
while  patients  included  in  the  SMART-CPT  group  exhibited 
improved cognitive functions involved in learning and attention. 
The PCL-S instrument was self-administered weekly (12 times) 
to record the evolution of  PTSD symptoms in veterans [39]. An-
other study using a combination of  SMART-CPT and standard 
CPT employed the PCL-S instrument 12 times during the pro-
gram and the pre-and post-intervention. The sample consisted of  
74 veterans, with a mean age of  34.34 and 2.9 TBI events [38].

Boyd et al. used in their case report (focusing on a veteran 
over 40  years  old  with  mild  TBI,  cognitive and  speech  impair-
ments) the PTSD checklist at three-time points (before, during, 
and after the CPT intervention – which yielded positive results 
for all three domains of  intervention) [31].

CAPS was used in six studies. In two of  them, the authors em-
ployed this instrument before and after the intervention, while in the 
rest of  the studies, it was used only at one study time point – baseline.
Elbogen et al. conducted a randomized control trial on the 
effect of  CALM (cognitive applications for life management) – a 

cognitive rehabilitation intervention that targeted executive dys-
function and emotional dysregulation, in a sample of  224 partic-
ipants (out of  which 112 suffered a TBI, and the other half  were 
a friend/family member of  the patient). The participants' mean 
age was 36.52, having on average 2.63 TBI events, and 57% suf-
fered a moderate to severe TBI. The trial reported positive results 
of  CALM in decreasing emotional dysregulation [41]. Two case 
studies by Strom et al. followed the evolution of  post-TBI PTSD 
in the context of  prolonged exposure (PE) in two war veterans. 
Their findings are in line with existing literature on the positive 
effect of  PE [41].

The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) – a tool on 
neurobehavioral symptoms – was applied in the included studies 
at the following time points: pre-and post-intervention [29, 31], 
and  at  baseline,  after  the  program  ended  three  months  follow-
ing the end of  the intervention [38, 39]. Other neurobehavioral 
tools employed were subscales from the Delis-Kaplan Executive 
Function System, such as the ones on inhibition/switching and 
the one on verbal fluency (D-KEFS letter and category fluency), 
which were employed in by Tanev et al. [42] immediately and at 
six months post-intervention, and by Crocker et al. immediately, 
and three- and six-months post-intervention completion [38].

In  the  article  by  Elbogen  and  colleagues,  aside  from  the 
D-KEFS  Color-Word  Inhibition  task,  the  instrument  measur-
ing behavioral problems was addressed to caregivers (in contrast 
with the other two articles). The tool used was the 20-items Head 
Injury Behavior Scale (HIBS) [41].

Tools  employed  to  quantify  anxiety  and  depression  were 
HADS  (Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale)  and  the  Beck 
Depression Inventory (2nd ed.; BDI-II).

In a case study by Roche [40], HADS was administered be-
fore, after, and at three- and twelve-month follow-up for a cogni-
tive-behavioral approach based on Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT). The patient was a 48-year-old female presenting 
cognitive difficulties, distress, and trauma symptoms after a car 
accident.

The Beck Depression Inventory measured depression in sev-
en studies included in this literature review. In five of  the studies, 
the tool was used before and after the intervention [26–28, 31], 
while in two studies, the scale was used throughout all study ses-
sions [27], with one article using it post-intervention [35].

The BDI-II scale was also used in the retrospective research 
of  Ragsdale and Voss Horell [34] on nonrandomized clinical data 
to assess the effectiveness of  cognitive processing therapy (CPT) 
or prolonged exposure (PE). The sample consisted of  veterans ex-
periencing combat-related PTSD combined with TBI (19 cases) 
and veterans experiencing only PTSD (22 cases). The sample was 
mainly composed of  males (87.8%), with a mean age of  33 years 
[34].  In  the  research  of   Chard  et  al.  [26],  BDI-II  was  used  to 
assess  depressive  symptoms  in  42  veterans  completing  residen-
tial therapy of  CPT-C in individual and group settings, while the 
case study of  Boyd et al. [31] assessed, among other variables, the 
variation in depressive symptoms after 12 sessions of  Cognitive 
Processing Therapy–Cognitive Only (CPT-C) on a veteran with 
PTSD and a history of  mild TBI. Furthermore, Strom et al. [35] 
used the BDI-II as well as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 
(DASS) to explore the effects of  prolonged exposure (PE), while 
the research of  Crocker [38] used BDI-II, among other scales, 
to investigate the effects of  Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) 
in  seventy-four  veterans  with  histories  of   traumatic  brain  inju-
ries. Finally, Alvarez et al. [27] examined self-reported depression 
assessed  with  BDI-II  in  a  quasi-experimental  and  retrospective 
cohort study on the effectiveness of  group cognitive processing

usual (TAU) in veterans from a residential rehabilitation program.

DISCUSSION

Our literature review mapped instruments used in 17 studies 
on  post-TBI  PTSD,  covering  several  psychological  therapeutic 
approaches such as prolonged exposure, exposure therapy, cog-
nitive  processing  therapy,  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction, 
emotional freedom techniques, or acceptance and commitment 
therapy, among others.

Most  studies  were  conducted  in  the  USA,  and  veterans 
mainly  formed  the  analysis  cohorts.  This  can  be  explained  by 
the  high  number  of   American  military  servicemen  and  wom-
en (in 2018, there were 8.4 million fewer veterans compared to 
2,000–26.4  million)  who  participated  in  conflicts  such  as  those 
post-9/11  or  the  Korean  and  the  Gulf   Wars  [43].  A  2019  ex-
ercise  in  estimating  the  absolute  number  of   PTSD  and  major 
depression  (MD)  cases  using  data  from  the  Uppsala  Conflict 
Database  and  including  countries  that  experienced  war  within 
their geographical borders over twenty-six years (1989–2015) es-
timated that out of  1.45 billion surviving inhabitants affected by 
wars, 354 million experienced PTSD (and/or MD), out of  which 
117 million live with both comorbidities [44]. 

Some  of   the  specific  scales  employed  in  civilian  and  mil-
itary  populations  diagnosed  post-TBI  with  PTSD  are  the 
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic 
Stress  Disorder  Checklist  Military  Version  (PCL-M)  as  well  as 
Specific Version (PCL-S), and Civilian Version (PCL-C).

The  Clinician-Administered  PTSD  Scale  is  a  commonly 
used and validated instrument in establishing a PTSD diagnosis 
and measuring PTSD-related symptoms in clinical practice and 
research settings [45]. Our literature review assessed studies that 
included CAPS versions corresponding to DSM-IV and DSM-V. 
Bryant  and  colleagues  conducted  a  study  enrolling  pa-
tients from five Australian hospitals, and they compared CAPS 
DSM-IV  (employed  at  hospital  screening  and  then  at  assess-
ments at three, twenty-four, and seventy-two months) and CAPS 
DSM-V (employed only at the final study evaluation – at seven-
ty-two months) for detecting PTSD in patients with acute stress 
disorder  (ASD).  Although  DSM-5  sensitivity  was  improved  for 
specific psychiatric pathologies (depression or GAD), the propor-
tions of  patients with ASD diagnosed with PTSD were similar 
when using CAPS DSM-IV or CAPS DSM-V [46].

The  latest  version  reflects  the  diagnostic  criteria  listed  in 
DSM-V  by  adding  (three)  new  symptoms,  dropping  a  criteri-
on, clear delimitation among other group symptoms, and other 
changes  compared  to  CAPS  for  DSM-IV  [47]  and  improving 
screening and scoring processes. The article written by Weathers 
and  colleagues  focusing  on  the  psychometric  properties  of   the 
new edition (which was administered in two cohorts of  war veter-
ans) showed that the scale has strong results in terms of  interrater 
and test-retest reliability and internal consistency [45]. 

Another  standard  measure  used  for  PTSD  is  the  PTSD 
checklist (PCL) [48], formed of  17 Likert items, with three ver-
sions:  military  (PCL-M),  specific  trauma  (PCL-S),  and  civilian 
(PCL-C) [49]. A review focusing on the psychometric properties 
by Wilkins, Lang & Norman shows that although PCL has inter-
nal  consistency  and  strong  convergent  validity,  increased  inter-
vals between measure administration can diminish the test-retest 
parallel.  In  addition,  some  of   the  PCL  strengths  are  related  to 
administration  time  and  difficulty  and  corresponding  measures 

to DSM criteria. In contrast, PCL limitations are related to read-
ing difficulty, revision and revalidation corresponding to DSM-V, 
and overestimating the number of  PTSD cases correlated with 
measures for other prevalent psychiatric disorders [49].

Some of  the scales included in assessing anxiety and depres-
sion are the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 
The Beck Depression Inventory (2nd ed.; BDI-II).

The  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS)  [50] 
represents a self-report measure assessing symptoms  of  anxiety 
and depression on a 14-item, four-point scale, with the resulting 
scores  being  indicative  of   the  respondents'  mood  over  the  past 
week.  It  comprises  two  subscales,  one  for  anxiety  and  one  for 
depression, scored from 0 to 3, with total scores ranging from 0 
to 21 for each scale. When considering the interpretation, higher 
scores are indicative of  more significant distress, and, although 
there do not seem to be any generally agreed-upon cut off points, 
the authors suggest considering scores of  8–10 as representative 
for mild cases, scores of  11–15 as moderate cases and scores of  
16  and  above  as  severe  ones  [50].  HADS  is  a  reliable  tool  for 
screening depression and anxiety in TBI patients [51], with sen-
sitivity  levels  ranging  from  62%  (depression)  to  75%  (anxiety), 
while  specificity  values  were  between  69%  (anxiety)  and  92% 
(depression) [52].

The  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (2nd  ed.;  BDI-II)  was  the 
most used instrument for assessing depression in the context of  
PTSD and TBI in the studies selected for this literature review.

BDI-II is a self-reporting screening instrument used to assess 
depressive symptoms within the past two weeks from evaluation. 
It encompasses 21 statements evaluated on a 4-point scale, with 
total scores ranging from 0 to 63, and higher scores point to more 
severe depressive symptoms. The scale presents adequate conver-
gent and discriminant validity, excellent internal consistency, and 
good test-retest reliability [53, 54].

To  measure  neurobehavioral  symptoms  in  patients  with 
TBI,  several  scales  are  available.  One  frequently  used  scale  is 
the  Neurobehavioral  Symptom  Inventory  (NSI)  which  consists 
of  a 22-item self-report questionnaire regarding neurobehavioral 
symptoms [55]. The first version of  the NSI was first published as 
a symptom checklist in 1995 by Cicerone and Kalmar in the Jour-
nal of  Head Trauma Rehabilitation. The Department of  Veter-
ans  Affairs  (VA)  uses  the  Neurobehavioral  Symptom  Inventory 
(NSI)  to  measure  postconcussive  symptoms  (present  within  the 
last two weeks) in its comprehensive traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
evaluation; however, the scale domain is not limited to TBI [56]. 
It is also important to note that most of  the research on the NSI 
was  conducted  in  veteran  and  military  samples  with  predomi-
nantly  mild  TBI  [55].  Nevertheless,  studies  have  demonstrated 
that this scale is a reliable and valid measure of  postconcussive 
symptoms and helps differentiate veterans with TBI from those 
without TBI. One downside of  this scale is that identifying pa-
tients with a history of  TBI is strongly influenced by the presence 
of  PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety, as some analyses 
on this issue have shown [56, 57].

Another  widely  used  neurobehavioral  scale 

is  The 
Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), which con-
sists of  a set of  standardized tests for comprehensively assessing 
higher-level cognitive functions (executive functions) in children 
and adults from the age of  8 to 89. D-KEFS comprises nine tests 
that measure multiple verbal and non-verbal executive functions. 
Each test is constructed as a stand-alone instrument and can be 
administered individually or with other D-KEFS tests based on 
the  specific  needs  [58].  Heled  E.  and  colleagues  demonstrated 
in  their  study  the  superiority  of   one  of   the  D-KEFS  subtests

tients that suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and in differen-
tiating TBI patients and healthy controls over two other broadly 
used tests in evaluating executive functions: The Wisconsin Card 
Sorting  Test  and  the  Trial  Making  Test.  D-KEFS  Sorting  Test 
seems  to  be  more  sensitive,  offers  more  complexity,  and  covers 
more aspects than the previous ones [59]. In a study conducted 
by Strong et al., another test, the D-KEFS Verbal Fluency sub-
test, was validated and demonstrated the potential to be clinically 
helpful in assessing complicated mild-severe TBI [60].

Head Injury Behavior Scale (HIBS) represents another ref-
erence scale for evaluating behavioral problems associated with 
TBI and assessing the level of  distress caused by these problems. 
It consists of  two versions, one administered to the patient and 
another to the caregivers for an optimal evaluation of  the burden 
of   TBI-associated  behavioral  problems.  It  consists  of   20  prob-
lems  identified  from  a  literature  survey  on  personality  changes 
following TBI. Studies proved that HIBS provides a reliable and 
valid measure of  both caregiver distress and TBI patient distress 
produced by their behavioral change [61, 62].

Our  review  shows  that,  in  addition  to  including  tools  that 
diagnose and measure PTSD symptom severity at baseline, it is 
needed  to  have  multiple  usages  of   these  tools  across  the  inter-
vention. Although CAPS or PCL checklists have been employed 
before  and  after  the  intervention  (with  some  authors  opting  to 
administer the instruments right after the intervention has ended 
and some have set different timelines post-intervention), using the 
tool at each study session or at equally spaced interval delivers a 
complete  symptom  evolution  which  would  guide  future  timing 
approaches for the patient involved and for patients with similar 
characteristics.

The limitations of  our brief  literature review are the follow-
ing:  short  period  (eleven  years),  language  barriers,  the  number 
of  queried databases (three), and a limited selection of  included 
therapeutic approaches. The advantages of  our brief  narrative 
review  are  that  it  mapped,  from  the  included  studies,  the  most 
used  scales  from  the  retrieved  studies.  However,  analyzing  sin-
gle  entry  tools  was  difficult  due  to  the  increased  heterogeneity 
among included studies.

CONCLUSION

Throughout  studies  targeting  psychological  interventions 
that  are  already  being  used  in  clinical  practice  or  evaluating 
emerging  interventions,  validated  neuropsychological  tools  for 
assessing  patients  are  essential  in  providing  a  comprehensive 
clinical psychological picture of  patients' evolution. In addition, 
trialists  must  pay  attention  to  patients'  TBI  severity  and  other 
psychiatric pathologies (as well as additional comorbidities) when 
deciding on study design, as the adoption of  validated and psy-
chometrically sound instruments is of  utter importance.
