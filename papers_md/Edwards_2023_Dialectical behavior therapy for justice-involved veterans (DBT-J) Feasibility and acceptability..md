Abstract

Justice-involved veterans are a high-risk, high-need subgroup serviced by behavioral health 
services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system. Justice-involved veterans 
often have complex mental health and substance use difficulties, a myriad of case management 
needs, and a range of criminogenic needs that are difficult to treat with traditional outpatient 
VHA services. The current study represents an initial evaluation of Dialectical Behavior Therapy 
for Justice-Involved Veterans (DBT-J), a novel psychotherapy program providing 16 weeks 
of skills-based group therapy and individualized case management services to veterans with 
current or recent involvement with the criminal justice system. A total of 13 veterans were 
successfully enrolled into this initial acceptability and feasibility trial. Results broadly suggested 
DBT-J to be characterized by high ease of implementation, successful recruitment efforts, strong 
participant attendance and retention, high treatment fidelity, and high acceptability by veteran 
participants, DBT-J providers, and adjunctive care providers alike. Although continued research 
using comparison conditions is necessary, Veterans who completed participation in DBT-J tended 
to show reductions in criminogenic risk across the course of treatment. Cumulatively, these 
findings suggest DBT-J holds potential as a VHA-based intervention to address the various needs 
of justice-involved veterans.

Management

Justice-involved veterans are a high-risk, high-need population within the United States and 
particularly within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) behavioral health services 
system. Although veterans account for only 7.6% of currently incarcerated persons in the 
United States (commensurate with their representation in the general population; Maruschak 
et al., 2021), one estimate using a national sample of veterans suggest approximately 70% 
of veterans receiving VHA care for substance use have a history of arrest, including 58% 
with a history of three or more arrests and 24% with a history of arrest for violent crimes 
(Weaver et al., 2013). Similarly, a study of nearly 13,000 veterans in Florida suggested those 
receiving VA services for both mental health and substance use were 10.2 times more likely 
to have a history of multiple arrests compared to the general population (Pandiani et al., 
2003).

The needs of justice-involved veterans are markedly complex. Estimates using national data 
suggest 77% and 71% justice-involved veterans serviced by VHA are diagnosed with mental 
health and substance use disorders, respectively, the most common of which include mood, 
posttraumatic, personality, and alcohol use disorders (Finlay et al., 2015). In comparison to 
persons without justice involvement, justice-involved veterans are also more likely to engage 
in suicide behaviors, to have difficulties with aggression and violence, and to experience 
homelessness, occupational instability, and low community integration (Edwards et al., 
2020a; Edwards et al., 2022a; Edwards et al., 2022b; LePage et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2021).

Currently, VHA relies on two programs to service justice-involved veterans, Veterans Justice 
Outreach (VJO) and the Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) program. Both programs 
function to connect eligible veterans with VA behavioral health services. However, they 
are reliant upon existing behavioral health programming within the VA and typically 
do not refer veterans to specialized, forensic-oriented programming. Although VJO and 
HCRV are generally effective in connecting veterans to VHA services (Finlay et al., 2016; 
Finlay et al., 2017), behavioral health services – when provided in isolation – are typically 
insufficient in reducing criminal behavior and addressing the range of needs experienced by 
justice-involved veterans (Epperson et al., 2014; Timko et al., 2014). Effectively addressing 
the complex needs of this population may require connection of veterans to either (a) a 
combination of behavioral health, case management, and forensic-oriented services or (b) 
integrative programming to address these needs concurrently.

To date, VHA has relied on a combination-of-services approach and, as a result, routinely 
offers well-established behavioral health and case management services to justice-involved 
veterans (Finlay et al., 2016; Finlay et al., 2017). However, a recent survey of VJO and 
HCRV specialists suggests numerous barriers to implementing forensic-oriented services 
within the VHA system (Blonigen et al., 2018). At the patient level, forensic programming 
traditionally developed for civilians (e.g., Moral Reconation Therapy [MRT], Thinking for 
a Change [T4C], etc.) are seen as lengthy (often 20+ weeks), intensive, and unappealing to

the internal motivations of justiceinvolved veterans. At the organizational level, many VHA 
behavioral health providers are similarly resistant to forensic-oriented programming due to 
biases against veterans with “antisocial personalities” and perceptions of forensic-oriented 
programming as largely irrelevant to behavioral health (Blonigen et al., 2018). Effectively 
establishing programming for justice-involved veterans within VHA behavioral health 
settings will therefore require the program to be of brief duration (<20 weeks), appealing to 
the internal motivations of justice-involved veterans (e.g., by addressing interpersonal and 
case management concerns in addition to criminogenic risk factors), and relevant to VHA 
behavioral health providers (e.g., by balancing a behavioral health focus with interventions 
to reduce criminogenic risk).

Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans

In light of these barriers to a combination-of-services approach, Dialectical Behavior 
Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans (DBT-J) combines elements of three prominent 
theoretical models – the Risk-Need-Responsivity model of offender rehabilitation (RNR), 
Dialectical Behavior Therapy for behavioral health (DBT), and Socioenvironmental 
Disadvantage Model (SDM) – into an integrative program for addressing the behavioral 
health, case management, and criminogenic needs of justice-involved veterans concurrently. 
See Figure 1.

RNR is the most widely validated and empirically successful treatment paradigm for 
reducing criminal behavior (Andrews et al., 2011; Polaschek, 2012). It is guided by three 
primary principles: (1) Intensity of services should be directly proportionate to risk of 
recidivism and focused on persons at highest risk for criminal behavior; (2) Treatment 
should be tailored to address relevant, empirically-identified, criminogenic risk factors (i.e., 
antisocial behavior, antisocial personality, antisocial thinking, antisocial peers, disruptions 
in educational/vocational functioning, disruptions in family relationships, substance use, and 
lack of prosocial activity); and (3) Treatment should utilize a cognitive-behavioral approach 
and accommodate “”responsivity” factors that may impede learning and/or behavioral 
change, such as comorbid psychopathology, interpersonal style, and learning style. Though 
originally developed and validated for civilian populations, RNR is also effective in reducing 
criminal behavior of veterans (Timko et al., 2014). Nevertheless, traditional RNR-based 
programs (e.g., MRT, T4C, etc.) are not structured to address the behavioral health or case 
management needs of justice-involved veterans (Timko et al., 2014; Blonigen et al., 2018) 
and, as noted previously, encounter various implementation barriers within VHA (Blonigen 
et al., 2018).

DBT is a well-established, transdiagnostic psychotherapy for reducing high-risk, self-
destructive, and quality-of-life interfering behaviors. Originally developed to treat suicidal 
behavior (Linehan, 1993), adaptations of DBT have been effectively used to treat various 
behavioral health concerns commonly associated with veteran justice-involvement, including 
complex psychological comorbidities, aggression, substance use, antisocial personality 
traits, and premature treatment dropout (Bornovalova & Daughters, 2007; Dimeff & 
Koerner, 2007; Galietta & Rosenfeld, 2012). Research also suggests DBT adaptations can be 
effectively used in the treatment of both forensic (Tomlinson, 2018) and veteran populations

(Goodman, et al., 2016; Landes et al., 2017). DBT is commonly used in VHA behavioral 
health settings (Landes et al., 2017); however, to date, it has not been adapted for the 
treatment of justice-involved veterans.

Lastly, while not directly related to criminal behavior (Andrews et al., 2011), SDM suggests 
socioenvironmental disadvantages – such as housing instability, poverty, and unemployment 
– may contribute to development of criminogenic risk factors by increasing exposure to 
crime and opportunities for criminal activity and/or exacerbate behavioral health concerns 
by increasing stress (Epperson et al., 2014). Such factors are commonly considered 
responsivity factors within the RNR framework (Andrews et al., 2011). As such, while not 
a traditional target of forensic-oriented programming, addressing such factors is generally 
considered necessary to ensure the success of forensic programming (Andrews et al., 2011). 
Case management services to mitigate socioenvironmental disadvantage are therefore key to 
managing both criminogenic and behavioral health needs of justice-involved veterans.

DBT-J Intervention Model

DBT-J combines elements of RNR, DBT, and SDM to address mental health, substance 
use, criminogenic, and case management needs through a single, integrated, manualized 
program.

It provides veterans 1–1.5 hours of intervention per week for 16 weeks through three 
core components. The first component, group therapy, forms the foundation of DBT-J 
and focuses on developing concrete skills for managing mental health, substance use, and 
criminogenic needs. Included skills were drawn from RNR- and DBT-based interventions to 
align with common needs of justice-involved veterans (see Table 1). For example, consistent 
with RNR-based approaches, there is a strong cognitive-behavioral emphasis on recognizing 
and challenging criminogenic thinking patterns and increasing prosocial behaviors through 
goal-directedness, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills (Andrews et al., 2011). Also, 
consistent with DBT-based interventions, there is a strong emphasis on mindfulness and 
emotion regulation as transdiagnostic interventions for emotional distress and behavior 
regulation (Linehan, 1993). Group sessions occur once per week for 60 minutes. They are 
structured and closed format, allowing therapeutic content to build cumulatively across the 
course of treatment. Like RNR- and DBT-based interventions, each session includes (a) 
completion of a brief mindfulness exercise, (b) review of homework from the previous 
week, (c) introduction and in-session practice of a new skill, and (d) assigning of between-
session homework. Homework is designed to promote generalization of skills to real-life 
experiences and considered a necessary component of the intervention (Edwards et al., 
2021). To aid in guiding session content, all veterans are provided interactive handouts and 
worksheets corresponding to each introduced skill. These handouts and worksheets serve to 
further veterans’ learning, guide homework assignment completion, and provide a resource 
to review missed material due to program absence.

Second, case management meetings, held every other week for approximately 30 minutes, 
provide veterans individual support in coordinating services between the treatment team, 
legal services, and connection with social services in the community (e.g., outside referrals, 
housing assistance, food stamps, etc.). Where possible, case-management sessions include

coaching clients through application of skills learned in group therapy sessions (e.g., 
problem solving) to resolve case-management difficulties. In accordance with the RNR 
model (Andrews et al., 2011), degree of case management services aligns with the risk-level 
of the offender.

Last, consultation team is attended by DBT-J providers to provide a forum for discussing 
cases, troubleshooting barriers to therapeutic progress, and providing peer-support and peer-
supervision. These weekly meetings last approximately 60 minutes. Similar to traditional 
DBT consultation team meetings, they are also designed to protect against provider burnout 
and promote continued adherence to the principles of DBT-J treatment (Walsh et al., 2018).

The structure of DBT-J was designed with consideration of common barriers to 
implementing forensic-oriented programming within VHA settings. Specifically, the brief 
duration (16 weeks) and balanced focus on both criminogenic and non-criminogenic needs 
were expected to be appealing to justice-involved veterans, whereas the similarity to 
traditional DBT skills groups, deemphasis of the presence or absence of a personality 
disorder, and partial focus on behavioral health were expected to be appealing to VHA 
behavioral health providers. This structure is also consistent with recent research suggesting 
DBT-based treatments that are abbreviated and/or comprising only group therapy, case 
management, and consultation team typically yield promising outcomes comparable to the 
12-month, comprehensive DBT-model (McMain et al., 2018), even in the treatment of 
justice-involved persons (Moore et al., 2018). Further, the combination of group therapy 
and case management allowed the intervention to be both standardized across the course 
of treatment and individualized to the unique needs of each veteran. For a comparison of 
DBT-J, RNR, and DBT, see Table 2.

The therapeutic style adopted in DBT-J also integrates various strategies to counteract 
common difficulties with engaging veteran and justice-involved populations (Galietta & 
Rosenfed, 2012; Nugent et al., 2021). Consistent with a DBT-based approach (Linehan, 
1993), all DBT-J providers prioritize developing a strong therapeutic alliance, building 
phenomenologically empathic conceptualizations of client behaviors and difficulties, and 
adopting a clinical style that balances nonjudgment, validation, empathy, collaboration, 
transparency, respect, direction, and accountability. Also consistent with DBT, the provider’s 
role also gradually transitions from that of “coach” to “cheerleader” across the course 
of treatment by emphasizing explicit direction (e.g., on matters of problem solving, skill 
acquisition and implementation, etc.) early in treatment and gradually shifting emphasis 
to support as the veteran progresses through treatment (Linehan, 1993). This aims to 
maximize veteran independence in problem-solving upon completion of the program, 
thereby maximizing chances for success after discharge.

The Current Study

Despite the overrepresentation of justice-involved veterans within VHA behavioral health 
services, there is a need for more established VHA services capable of addressing the 
complex needs of this population. The current study evaluated a novel, psychotherapeutic 
intervention, DBT-J, which combines elements of established treatment approaches into

an integrated treatment framework. The primary aims of the intervention were to reduce 
veterans’ risk of future criminal behavior and improve psychological functioning. Because 
development of DBT-J is still in its infancy, the current study used an open label trial of 15 
veterans with ongoing or recent justiceinvolvement to examine feasibility and acceptability 
of this intervention.

Method

Three cohorts of Veterans were enrolled into an open label acceptability and feasibility trial 
of DBT-J. The intervention protocol was manualized, developed with input and feedback 
from experts in the fields of Dialectical Behavior Therapy, psychotherapy with veterans, and 
psychotherapy with justice-involved persons. All providers were specifically trained in DBT-
J and underlying theories; providers co-led therapy groups and divided cases for provision 
of case management. DBT-J was intended to be adjunctive to services provided through VJO 
and other ongoing behavioral health and/or social services. Therefore, information about 
treatment progress was shared with veterans’ VHA treatment teams (if applicable), and all 
participating veterans continued with their outside providers as needed.

Study Site & Recruitment

The trial was completed from January to October, 2021 with VHA-serviced veterans 
at James J. Peters Veterans Affairs medical center (VAMC), a large, VAMC located in 
a predominantly lower-income, urban neighborhood in Bronx, New York., a large, VA 
medical center (VAMC) located in a predominantly lower-income, urban neighborhood in 
James J. Peters Veterans Affairs medical center (VAMC), a large, VAMC located in a 
predominantly lower-income, urban neighborhood in Bronx, New York. The VAMC had 
an active VJO program to connect justice-involved veterans with internal behavioral health 
and substance use services. The VJO and outpatient behavioral health and substance use 
providers were informed about the program and encouraged to refer potentially eligible 
veterans for participation. After referral, veterans completed a brief information session via 
phone or video conference to receive further information about the study and to assess 
eligibility. Veterans meeting eligibility requirements and expressing interest in participation 
were then invited to provide their informed consent for participation. To protect participant 
safety during the COVID19 pandemic, all participation – including participation in treatment 
and completion of study assessments – was completed using VAWebEx, an online, secure, 
telehealth delivery platform.

Participants

A total of 15 veterans were recruited for participation in the current trial. Inclusion 
criteria included: (1) Veteran aged 18–65; (2) Ability to provide consent; (3) Current or 
recent history of justice-involvement, defined as (a) one or more arrests within two years 
prior to participation and/or (b) current supervision by parole or probation at the time of 
participation. Exclusion criteria included (1) Limited English proficiency; (2) Inability to 
tolerate group therapy format; (3) current high risk for suicide (defined as a score of >24 on 
Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation; CochraneBrink et al., 2000); and/or (4) current charges for

exclusion criteria for participation.

DBT-J Training & Fidelity

All interventions were delivered by the DBT-J treatment developer and postdoctoral, 
doctoral, and masters level training clinicians. All training clinicians completed a 10-hour 
training in DBT-J (e.g., structure, approach to case conceptualization, clinical style), 
underlying theories (i.e., DBT, RNR, SDM), and intervention strategies (e.g., behavioral 
skills, case management, management of group dynamics) by the treatment developer 
prior to delivering the protocol. The treatment developer had comprehensive training and 
experience in DBT, including completion of the 10-day DBT Intensive Training™ (Navarro-
Haro et al., 2018) and 7 years’ experience providing DBT in various treatment settings. 
The developer was also comprehensively trained and experienced in RNR- and SDM-
based interventions with 8 years’ experience providing these interventions across treatment 
settings. Weekly supervision was also provided to providers by the treatment developer to 
provide additional training and feedback as needed to ensure continued adherence to the 
treatment protocol.

Group sessions were attended by an independent rater to assess fidelity to the DBT-J 
manual using an objective scale developed to assess core features of the structure, content, 
and treatment principles along with general clinical competence (e.g., rapport building, 
managing group dynamics, etc.). This scale scored fidelity according to a 5-point scale of 
1 (completely nonadherent) to 5 (no violations to adherence). Raters attended sessions live 
instead of reviewing session recordings due to participants’ expressed anxieties related to 
recording sessions. The treatment developer and independent rater each coded the first five 
group sessions to establish inter-rater reliability; the rater then coded 20% of randomly 
selected group sessions thereafter. Notably, because the treatment developer was intimately 
involved in delivery of treatment sessions, establishing inter-rater reliability required the 
developer to code their own fidelity. Subsequent ratings were then completed by the 
independent rater, who was not involved in treatment delivery. Providers were required 
to maintain an average of 4 or above (some minor violations to adherence) to demonstrate 
adequate adherence to the intervention.

Participant Characteristics: Participant characteristics were assessed during baseline 
assessments. Demographics were assessed via veterans’ electronic medical records and 
self-report. Baseline criminogenic risk and history of justice involvement were assessed 
using the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI; Andrews et al., 2000), a 
semi-structured interview that assesses criminogenic needs, risk of criminal recidivism, and 
responsivity factors that may impact treatment (e.g., social, physical, and mental health). 
It has been widely validated across numerous samples, and previous research suggests 
the LS/CMI total score to be a good predictor of later criminal behavior (Giguère & 
Lussier, 2016). Scores are interpreted through comparison against normative data of over 
150,000 North American offenders (Andrews et al., 2000). Lastly, diagnosis was assessed 
by a licensed psychologist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5;

First et al., 2016) and Structured interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders, Cluster B 
section (SID-P-IV; Pfohl et al., 1997), semi-structured interviews for determining psychiatric 
diagnoses in accordance with DSM diagnostic criteria.

Feasibility & Acceptability: To examine feasibility, investigators tracked: (1) Ease of 
implementation by measuring the number of hours DBT-J providers spent in preparation, 
delivery of intervention, consultation team, and supervision; (2) Recruitment by measuring 
rates of successful referral to DBT-J (recruitment was considered adequate if at least 70% of 
eligible veterans referred to the study agreed to participate); (3) Attendance & Retention by 
tracking the number of sessions and specific sessions each veteran attended (retention was 
considered adequate if 70% of participants attended at least 10 of the 16 group sessions and 
inadequate otherwise); and (4) Treatment fidelity through use of the aforementioned fidelity 
scale.

To assess intervention acceptability, participants completed a brief survey after 2 months 
of being enrolled in the study and upon completion of the DBT-J intervention. Surveys 
included five Likert-format items, each scored on a 5-point scale, to assess participants’ 
perceptions of treatment helpfulness, degree to which they have benefited from treatment, 
motivation to continue in treatment, relevance of group session content, and helpfulness of 
case management sessions. Five open-ended response questions also provided participants 
opportunity to share what they liked/disliked about the treatment and features they found 
helpful/unhelpful.

Given previously noted barriers to implementing forensic-oriented programming in VHA 
settings, it was deemed necessary to also gather acceptability information from those 
delivering and referring to the DBT-J program. Intervention acceptability by providers was 
therefore also assessed using brief surveys, completed by DBT-J providers and adjunctive 
care providers upon completion of each treatment cycle. (Note, to limit biases associated 
with these surveys, the treatment developer did not complete an acceptability survey despite 
involvement as a DBT-J provider). Surveys included five, Likert-format items, each scored 
on a 5-point scale, to assess providers’ perceptions of treatment helpfulness, degree to which 
patient(s) benefit from treatment, relevance of treatment to veteran needs, ease or difficulty 
of treatment administration (DBT-J providers only), and interference of DBT-J on adjunctive 
care (adjunctive care providers only). Five open-ended response questions also provided 
DBT-J and adjunctive providers opportunity to share what they liked/disliked about the 
treatment and features they found helpful/unhelpful. These qualitative responses were then 
reviewed by the principal investigator using thematic analysis to identify common themes 
across participant feedback (Nowell et al., 2017).

Changes in Criminogenic Risk: Exploratory descriptive analyses were also used to 
preliminarily investigate changes in criminogenic risk across the course of treatment using 
the LS/CMI (Andrews et al., 2000). Structural and psychometric details about the LS/CMI 
are available above in Participant Characterization. Because the LS/CMI assesses both static 
and dynamic risk factors for criminal behavior, scores on this assessment can be expected 
to change across the course of treatment insomuch as the treatment influences dynamic risk 
factors.

Study Protocol

Page 9

After providing informed consent, veterans were enrolled into the 16-week DBT-J program 
consisting of weekly skills-focused group psychotherapy and bi-weekly case management 
sessions. All group sessions were led by the DBT-J treatment developer and one or two 
training clinicians; case management sessions were divided evenly between all DBT-J 
providers. In total, DBT-J providers included a licensed psychologist (DBT-J treatment 
developer), a postdoctoral psychology fellow, and four masters-level counseling students. 
See Table 3 for a summary of this treatment protocol. Weekly consultation team meetings 
(incorporated into the structure of the DBT-J protocol) provided a forum for DBT-J 
providers to discuss ongoing cases, troubleshoot barriers to care, and review results of 
ongoing safety monitoring. In addition to this treatment, veterans completed assessments 
at four timepoints: baseline (prior to beginning treatment), mid-treatment (8 weeks after 
beginning DBT-J), post-treatment (after completing DBT-J), and follow-up (4 weeks after 
completing DBT-J).

During baseline assessment, participants completed measures of participant characterization 
and criminogenic risk. At mid- and post-treatment, participants completed measures of 
criminogenic risk and feedback surveys. At follow-up, participants completed measures 
of criminogenic risk. Following completion of each assessment period, participants were 
compensated $75. Participants completing all four assessment periods also received a 
“completion bonus” of an additional $75, resulting in total compensation of $375. All study 
procedures were approved by the local VAMC IRB.

Results

Participant Characteristics

A total of 15 veterans agreed to participate in this initial clinical trial of Dialectical 
Behavior Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans (DBT-J). Of these, two Veterans dropped 
out prior to completing baseline assessments. The remaining 13 were included in statistical 
analyses. Participants were predominantly male, Black and/or Hispanic/Latino, heterosexual, 
relationally single, and with history of military service in the Army. Diagnostically, most 
common mental health conditions included posttraumatic stress, bipolar, and substance use 
disorders, whereas least common conditions included psychotic and cluster B personality 
disorders. Nearly 40% of veterans had a history of suicide attempt(s), including two 
veterans with ongoing suicidal ideation at the time of participation. See Table 4 for detailed 
participant characterization information. Most veterans were at moderate risk for future 
criminal behavior; in criminogenic risk assessments, difficulties with drugs and alcohol were 
most reported as risk factors, whereas lack of prosocial peers was least commonly reported. 
See Figure 2.

Feasibility

Overall, results suggested DBT-J to be a generally feasible intervention to deliver within 
VHA settings.

Ease of Implementation: Ease of implementation was relatively high, particularly for 
DBT-J providers with prior experience in DBT and/or work with forensic populations. On 
average, each provider devoted approximately 4.5–5.5 hours per week to tasks associated 
with providing DBT-J services to these veterans, including group therapy provision (1 hour 
per cohort weekly), case management (30 minutes per Veteran biweekly), documentation 
(30 minutes weekly), consultation team participation (1 hour weekly), supervision (0.5–1 
hour weekly), assessment administration (2 hours per Veteran for baseline assessments; 30 
minutes per Veteran for follow-up assessments), and participant recruitment and onboarding 
(1–1.5 hours per Veteran), with variation stemming from differences in providers’ case 
management caseloads. Notably, time devoted to program-related tasks decreased across the 
course of the trial as providers became more comfortable with the protocol and procedures 
(e.g., in documentation) were streamlined. Because all aspects of DBT-J were delivered 
online, a research assistant was required to attend all group therapy sessions to provide as 
needed technological support to veterans.

Recruitment: Some recruitment barriers were encountered, particularly early in the trial, 
such as outpatient providers being unaware of the legal status of their clients to make 
referrals and some providers viewing DBT-J as an unnecessary adjunctive treatment. 
Overcoming these barriers required DBT-J providers to build personal relationships with 
outpatient VA providers, provide education around the prevalence of veteran justice 
involvement in VHA behavioral health settings, and establish a firm partnership with the 
local Veterans Justice Outreach program. As the trial progressed and these efforts were 
implemented, referral rates progressively increased. A total of 18 eligible veterans were 
referred to the DBT-J clinical trial during the study period; of these, 15 (83%) provided 
informed consent, 2 (11%) were unresponsive to outreach attempts, and 1 (6%) stated that 
he was no longer interested in participating. After informed consent procedures, 2 veterans 
became unresponsive to outreach attempts prior to completing any study procedures. Thus, 
of the 18 eligible veterans referred to DBT-J, 13 (72%) successfully enrolled into the 
program.

Attendance & Retention: Three participants (23%) discontinued their participation 
in DBT-J prior to treatment completion; one discontinued due to scheduling conflicts 
associated with employment after attending 7 of the first 8 sessions. The other two became 
unresponsive to outreach attempts shortly after beginning the treatment; each completed 2 
sessions. Among the 10 Veterans who completed the DBT-J trial, treatment engagement 
was generally strong. On average, these veterans attended approximately three-quarters of 
scheduled group sessions (M = 76.25%, SD = 13.76%); 5 veterans attended 9–11 sessions, 
3 attended 12–14 sessions, and 2 attended 15–16 sessions. Similarly, veterans completed an 
average of 76% of assigned between-session homework assignments (SD = 19.41%), and 
80% completed all assessment periods.

Integration of case management services and delivery of DBT-J using an online platform 
proved vital in maintaining participant engagement and retention. Because all DBT-J 
participation was completed online, participants were able to maintain engagement with 
the program even when admitted to residential substance use treatment programs (n=2)

and shelter systems (n=2) during the study period. Upon referral to such programs, DBT-J 
case management services aided in veterans’ transitions into these outside programs and 
coordinated with outside providers to ensure continued treatment engagement.

Treatment Fidelity: The first five DBT-J group sessions were coded to establish inter-rater 
reliability of adherence coding between the adherence coder and the principal investigator 
(IRR=100%). Following establishment of inter-rater reliability, a random selection of 4–5 
DBT-J group sessions were coded for each of the three cycles of DBT-J. Coding suggested 
generally excellent adherence to the DBT-J treatment manual (overall adherence: M = 
4.78/5, SD = 0.65). Consistent with this, DBT-J providers reported minimal difficulty with 
delivering DBT-J adherently in feedback assessments (overall difficulty: 1.60/5).

Acceptability

Results suggested that DBT-J was also a generally acceptable intervention to veterans 
receiving the treatment, DBT-J providers, and adjunctive care providers.

Feedback from Participants: Overall, participants provided optimistic feedback 
regarding their participation in DBT-J. In their quantitative feedback, participants indicated 
generally positive impressions of the treatment and its helpfulness (out of 25, at mid-
treatment, M = 22.14, SD = 3.67; at post-treatment, M = 22.14, SD = 3.76). Similarly, 
in their qualitative feedback, four general themes emerged. First, veterans expressed 
appreciation of the behavioral skills introduced through group therapy sessions. For 
example, one veteran stated, “I’ve been able to identify with what emotions I am dealing 
with without reacting so quickly.” Second, veterans noted the benefits of discussing 
their difficulties in a group setting (e.g., “Being able to talk openly about my mental 
health issues”). Third, veterans were appreciative of DBT-J providers, describing them as 
“insightful,” “understanding,” and “engaging.” Lastly, veterans reported feeling validated 
when connecting with others encountering similar legal difficulties.

Participants also provided recommendations on areas for improvement to DBT-J, though 
these recommendations were not consistent across participants. For example, whereas some 
veterans reported that excessive group participation detracted from session content, others 
expressed a desire for more group participation. Two veterans also recommended the 
program be extended to include more group sessions. See Supplement for a comprehensive 
list of these qualitative feedback responses.

Feedback from DBT-J Providers: Feedback from DBT-J providers similarly suggested 
high acceptability of the DBT-J intervention. In quantitative feedback, DBT-J providers rated 
the program as generally helpful (M = 4.80/5), beneficial to patients (M = 4.80/5), and 
designed to address issues relevant to clients’ needs (M = 4.60/5). In qualitative feedback, 
providers consistently identified the skills groups as the most helpful aspect of the DBT-J 
program and described these groups as “interactive,” and “[showing veterans] that they are 
not alone in their struggles.” They also expressed appreciation for structured time devoted 
to case management, noting that this aspect of the program allowed for individualized 
services and helped in managing burnout associated with treating a high-risk population.

Some providers expressed concerns about the program being delivered via telehealth and 
offered various recommendations to improve coordination between providers, increase DBT-
J provider competence around case management needs, and manage group dynamics. See 
Supplement for a comprehensive list of qualitative feedback responses.

Feedback from Adjunctive Care Providers: Similarly, feedback from adjunctive care 
providers also suggested high acceptability of the DBT-J program. Quantitative feedback 
expressed intense optimism, with all adjunctive care providers giving maximum ratings for 
the treatment’s helpfulness, benefit, and relevance to veteran clients. Qualitative feedback 
similarly reflected this optimism. For example, feedback from the local Veterans Justice 
Outreach specialist described the treatment as “invaluable to the VJO program” and reflected 
gratitude for a “treatment [that] is unique to this population.” Similarly, feedback from an 
outside substance use counselor noted that the program “has a personal touch” and helped 
her client “…live better and make better choices.” See Supplement for a comprehensive list 
of qualitative feedback responses.

Changes in Criminogenic Risk

Descriptive statistics (including means, standard deviations, and range) at baseline, mid-
treatment, posttreatment, and follow-up were calculated to preliminarily examine Veterans’ 
changes in criminogenic risk across the course participation in DBT-J. Results suggested 
a gradual reduction in risk scores from pre- to posttreatment, which were maintained at 
one-month follow-up. See Figure 3. Correspondingly, 9 out of 10 Veterans experienced a 
reduction in risk from pre- to posttreatment (the final Veteran received a score of “very low 
risk” at all timepoints, reflecting no change in risk across the study period), 5 out of 10 
Veterans were classified as “low” or “very low risk” by posttreatment, and 0 Veterans were 
classified as “high” risk by posttreatment. Given the limited sample size, however, results 
are to be interpreted with great caution.

Discussion

This study represents an initial evaluation of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Justice-
Involved Veterans (DBT-J), a novel, psychotherapeutic intervention based in the Risk-
Need-Responsivity Model of criminal behavior, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and the 
Socioenvironmental Disadvantage Model. Results broadly suggest DBT-J to be both feasible 
and acceptable as an intervention for VHA-serviced veterans with current and/or recent 
criminaljustice involvement.

Sample Heterogeneity

The current sample was highly heterogeneous in terms of demographic profile, criminal 
history, and psychiatric presentation. Most veterans were racial and/or ethnic minorities, 
unmarried, and in early to middle adulthood. Approximately 30% of veterans’ most recent 
charges were for violent offenses, 30% for property offenses, and 30% for drug offenses, 
with 54% of veterans participating in Veterans Treatment Court. Pre-treatment criminogenic 
risk assessments suggested high heterogeneity in criminogenic risk, with a wide range in 
degree of prior criminal history; however, substance use was a similarly salient risk factor

across most participants. Findings were broadly consistent with the limited research on 
veteran criminogenic risk, which generally suggests that many VA-connected veterans have 
a history of multiple arrests (Pandiani et al., 2003; Weaver et al., 2013) and that substance 
use is often a salient risk factor for veteran criminal behavior (Blonigen et al., 2016). 
Also consistent with previous research on psychopathology among justice-involved veterans 
(Finlay et al., 2015), most common psychiatric presentations included posttraumatic stress, 
alcohol, and mood disorders. Notably, however, veterans with psychotic, personality, and 
intermittent explosive disorders and histories of suicide behavior (common exclusion criteria 
for psychotherapies and forensic-focused services; Edwards et al., 2020b; Ronconi et al., 
2014; Sander et al., 2020) were also successfully enrolled into the program. Although 
further research is necessary, these findings suggest DBT-J may be appropriate for a wide 
range of justice-involved veterans, including those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders 
generally considered disruptive and/or difficult to treat. These findings are particularly 
significant given recent research suggesting veteran personality disorder diagnoses to be 
associated with increased risk of justice involvement (Edwards et al., 2020a) and veterans to 
meet criteria for personality disorders at rates far exceeding those of the general population 
(Edwards et al., 2022c).

Acceptability and Feasibility

Previous efforts to implement forensic-oriented psychotherapeutic programming within 
VHA settings have generally faced extensive barriers to feasibility and acceptability 
(Blonigen et al., 2018). For example, justice-involved veterans have typically viewed 
forensic programming as lengthy, intensive, and unable to address their personal needs, 
and VHA behavioral health providers have viewed such programming as irrelevant to 
behavioral health (Blonigen et al., 2018). Consistent with this, behavioral health outpatient 
providers approached throughout recruitment efforts in the current study were generally 
unaware of clients’ legal status and initially hesitant to refer potentially eligible Veterans to 
DBT-J due to viewing the program as an unnecessary adjunctive service. Building personal 
relationships between DBT-J providers and outpatient behavioral health providers, providing 
education around veteran justice involvement, and partnering with local Veteran Justice 
Outreach specialists were key to navigating and ultimately overcoming these implementation 
barriers. Continued development of DBT-J, including expansion to other sites, will therefore 
likely require similar strategies to establish and maintain referral procedures. Future efforts 
to implement forensic-oriented programming within VHA settings may also benefit from 
adopting similar strategies. Relatedly, although inclusion criteria and recruitment efforts 
aimed to recruit veterans with current or recent involvement with the criminal justice 
system, most participants had active justice involvement through Veterans Treatment Court 
(54%) or parole/probation supervision (8%). This pattern may have resulted from outpatient 
providers’ general lack of knowledge about clients’ legal histories (rendering them unable 
to identify veterans with prior legal trouble). Future research may therefore investigate how 
efforts to increase providers’ knowledge of veteran legal needs influences recruitment and 
sample composition.

To effectively address the complex needs of this population, DBT-J proved somewhat 
resource intensive for providers, requiring approximately 4.5–5.5 hours a week to support

1–2 concurrent cohorts of veterans. This time commitment did, however, decrease gradually 
across the course of the trial as providers became more familiar with treatment protocols and 
procedures became more streamlined. Because some tasks support DBT-J provision across 
cohorts (e.g., supervision, consultation team meetings), expansion to include additional 
concurrent cohorts is expected to increase weekly time commitment by approximately 2.5 
hours weekly per 6-veteran cohort (1 hour group weekly + 30-minute case management 
sessions per veteran biweekly).

Patterns of attrition suggest risk for participant dropout may be particularly high during 
the first few weeks of treatment, particularly for veterans who show inconsistent early 
engagement. In the current trial, two veterans failed to engage with the program after 
providing consent despite numerous outreach attempts; another two veterans dropped out 
and became unresponsive to outreach attempts shortly after beginning the trial. Due to 
an inability to contact these veterans, reasons for their attrition remain unclear. While 
unfortunate, these patterns are generally consistent with literature suggesting many instances 
of dropout occur at the beginning of treatment (Edlund et al., 2002). Judicious use of 
clinical engagement and commitment strategies even prior to beginning treatment (e.g., 
during orientation and consent procedures) may therefore be necessary to ensure adequate 
engagement and avoid this early attrition in future DBT-J trials.

For participants who did engage with the treatment, acceptability assessments reflected 
optimistic feedback from participants, DBT-J providers, and adjunctive care providers alike. 
Feedback reflected appreciation for the peer support and validation offered by group therapy 
sessions and practice benefits of case management sessions. In contrast to previous research 
suggesting that veterans generally view forensic-oriented programming as irrelevant and 
lengthy (Blonigen et al., 2018), participants in the current study reported finding the 
treatment overall helpful and relevant to their needs. One veteran, who was initially hesitant 
about participating in a group-based program, even expressed desire for the program to 
be longer in duration. Feedback gathered through these formal acceptability assessments 
and through participant informal comments throughout the course of treatment informed 
minor adjustments to treatment delivery and content. For example, in response to comments 
about group participation, treatment facilitators aimed to implement more structure and 
reinforcement around group discussions to promote increased, relevant group participation 
and limit irrelevant group participation. Working examples used to introduce concepts and 
strategies during skills group sessions were also adjusted to better reflect veteran and 
military culture and lifestyle; for example, when discussing thinking errors in Session 
6, military values around independence were highlighted as potentially contributing to 
unwillingness to accept help from others. Also, because feedback highlighted the value 
of case management within the broader treatment program, added efforts will be invested 
to further develop and refine this aspect of the treatment. For example, future efforts will 
include establishing partnerships with a broader range of local veteran service organizations 
to which veterans can be connected and expanding training for providers in procedures and 
policies around recurrent veteran case management needs (e.g., housing, benefits, etc.).

Telehealth Considerations

Because this initial trial of DBT-J was provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, it relied 
heavily on telehealth for treatment delivery. This introduced certain logistical complications 
that may impact feasibility of long-term implementation moving forward. For example, 
some veterans struggled to access and/or navigate telehealth platforms. Other veterans 
found it difficult to secure a private space where they could participate in group sessions 
(e.g., those residing in spaces with limited opportunity for privacy, such as shelters and 
studio apartments; those with children unable to attend childcare due to risk of COVID-19 
exposure). Consistent with other telehealth-based interventions, prompt, creative problem 
solving was therefore often necessary to successfully navigate the unexpected challenges 
of adapting to this mode of treatment (Wootton et al., 2020). For example, to resolve 
technological issues, our team made a program assistant available to provide as-needed 
technological support. To address confidentiality concerns, we prioritized early, transparent 
communication around expectations and worked with veterans individually to problem-solve 
potential barriers, such as lack of childcare. Resolution of these largely logistical challenges 
often required additional time commitment from DBT-J providers, potentially decreasing 
ease of implementation.

Nevertheless, what was initially considered a temporary solution to the unexpected 
pandemic quickly proved vital to the observed early success of DBT-J. The online treatment 
delivery allowed veterans to remain engaged with DBT-J even while navigating difficult 
life circumstances, such as homelessness and admission to residential treatment programs. 
Consistent with previous research suggesting telehealth-based interventions may increase 
veteran attendance and engagement in mental health services (Fortier et al., 2021), observed 
attendance and retention rates in this initial DBT-J trial exceeded those often observed in 
veteran mental health treatment settings (e.g,. Edwards-Stewart et al., 2021; Harpaz-Rotem 
& Rosenheck, 2011). Our team therefore plans to maintain this telehealth-based approach 
for DBT-J moving forward, even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. Future research may 
compare feasibility and acceptability of DBT-J delivered using a telehealth platform versus 
in-person.

Next Steps for DBT-J

Criminogenic risk assessments delivered throughout the course of the trial reflected notable 
improvements from pre- to post-treatment that were maintained at one-month follow-up. 
Although optimistic, given the limited sample size and lack of comparison condition, 
these results should be interpreted with great caution. Without continued research, it 
remains unclear whether results were due to factors specific to the DBT-J treatment or 
to extraneous variables, such as the passage of time or receipt of outside services (indeed, 
many participants were engaged in outside mental health and/or case management services 
in addition to their involvement with DBT-J). In combination with results of acceptability 
and feasibility assessments, however, these findings highlight the potential utility of DBT-J. 
Continued research into the efficacy and utility of DBT-J is therefore warranted. Specifically, 
studies using larger samples and comparison against one or more control conditions are 
needed to evaluate the potential efficacy of DBT-J. Future studies should also assess a 
broader range of potential treatment outcomes than was assessed in the current study, such

Limitations

as psychological distress, substance use, and case management concerns. Investigations into 
mechanisms of change and differential effects across veteran subgroups (e.g., age cohorts, 
offense types, etc.) would also help in determining how to best tailor DBT-J interventions 
to the needs of individual Veterans. Lastly, research into implementation considerations, 
such as cost-benefit analyses and ongoing monitoring of treatment fidelity, would inform the 
potential scalability of DBT-J to the broader VHA system.

Results should be understood within the context of a few methodological limitations. Most 
notably, the current study represents an initial investigation into DBT-J using a small sample, 
pre-post design, and no comparison group. Given the small sample size, analyses were also 
limited to only veterans who completed the program and could not account for veterans 
who terminated the program prior to completion. Therefore, statistical findings should be 
interpreted with great caution, generalizability of results remains unclear, and analyses 
could not account for the potential influence of confounding variables, such as adjunctive 
care veterans received while also enrolled in DBT-J. Future research that employs larger 
samples and compares veterans participating in DBT-J against a control condition (e.g., 
treatment as usual) is therefore necessary to determine the utility of this treatment. Second, 
the DBT-J treatment developer was intimately involved in delivery and fidelity monitoring 
of the treatment and co-led all DBT-J groups throughout the trial. It is therefore unclear the 
extent to which therapist effects may have impacted results. Continued research in which 
DBT-J is delivered solely by providers not involved with the treatment’s development is 
therefore needed to inform future expansion and implementation efforts. Similarly, future 
investigations into DBT-J should employ independent evaluators to complete fidelity ratings. 
Third, determinations of criminogenic risk were informed primarily by the results of 
clinical interview. Although ongoing communication with adjunctive care providers (and, 
where applicable, veterans Justice Outreach specialists) tended to corroborate observed 
improvements in criminogenic risk, future research may benefit from integrating official 
record review into assessments of criminogenic risk. Fourth, it is possible that participant 
compensation influenced data on acceptability and feasibility. Implementation-focused 
research is therefore necessary to determine potential barriers to acceptability and feasibility 
of the DBT-J program outside of the research context. Lastly, qualitative feedback was 
collected and analyzed by the principal investigator, introducing potential for bias in 
data collection, coding, and/or interpretation. Future research should adopt more rigorous 
qualitative analyses, including having data reviewed and analyzed by multiple independent 
coders otherwise uninvested in the research protocol.

Conclusions

The current study represents a preliminary investigation into the feasibility and 
acceptability of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans (DBT-J), a novel 
psychotherapy providing skills-based group therapy and individualized case management 
services to veterans with current or recent involvement with the criminal justice system. 
Although preliminary, results are optimistic about the potential utility of DBT-J within a 
VHA setting. Overall, DBT-J was characterized by high ease of implementation, successful

recruitment efforts, strong participant attendance and retention, high treatment fidelity, 
and high acceptability by veteran participants, DBT-J providers, and adjunctive care 
providers alike. Veterans who participated in DBT-J also showed notable improvements 
in criminogenic risk throughout the course of treatment, and these gains were maintained at 
one-month follow-up. Cumulatively, these findings suggest DBT-J holds potential to fill a 
need currently unaddressed by the broader VHA system, the treatment of criminogenic risk 
among justice-involved veterans.

Impact Statement

Justice-involved veterans are a high-risk, high-need subgroup serviced by behavioral 
health services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system. Dialectical 
Behavior Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans was developed as a novel psychotherapy 
program providing 16 weeks of skills-based group therapy and individualized case 
management services to justice-involved Veterans. Results suggest DBT-J to be 
acceptable and feasible for use in a VHA outpatient setting.
