Abstract
Objective: To hypothesise that a possible increased prevalence of adult-onset attention-deﬁcit disorder (ADD) and
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may reﬂect mobile technology and digital media use being an ae-
tiological factor.
Conclusions: Data and clinical observations support but do not prove the hypothesis.

Keywords:

I t is common for clinical psychiatrists to comment that

they are noting a distinct increase in adolescent and
adult patients presenting with ADD (attention-deﬁcit
disorder) or ADHD (attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity dis-
order) symptoms. Currently, increased community con-
cern about the prevalence, cost and impact of ADHD is
evident in Australia, with a Senate inquiry recently an-
nounced. Such political recognition is likely to reﬂect in
part the distinct prevalence of the condition, and with
a recent Australian guideline document reporting an
ADHD prevalence of 6%–10% in Australian children and
adolescents and 2%–6% in adults.1 An economic analysis2
indicated that some 800,000 Australians were affected
with ADHD and that the condition resulted in 12.83
billion dollars/year in direct costs, while multiple indirect
costs were also detailed. That report detailed prevalence
rates across age bands with the highest rates occurring for
those in the 5-to 29-year bands and with prevalence rates
dropping distinctly and linearly in older age bands. While
such a pattern could reﬂect better awareness and diagnosis
in younger individuals, it could also reﬂect a cohort effect
whereby ADD/ADHD is now distinctly higher in children,
adolescents and young adults.

Two (albeit US) studies quantifying increases in rates are
noted. Chung et al.3 evaluated medical records of more
than ﬁve million Californians and reported an increase
from 2007 to 2016 in clinician-diagnosed incidence and
prevalence rates of 43% and 123%, respectively. Xu et al.4
undertook a population-based survey of parents reporting
that their child had received an ADD/ADHD diagnosis
and quantiﬁed a linear increase in rates of the conditions
being diagnosed over a 20-year period (from 6.1% in
1997–98 to 10.2% in 2015–16).

Such data and observations by clinical psychiatrists could
reﬂect changed diagnostic criteria. DSM-III ﬁrst listed

‘attention-deﬁcit disorder’ and allowed two principal sub-
types (‘with’ and ‘without’ hyperactivity) as well as a ‘re-
sidual type’ where hyperactivity once existed but was no
longer present. The subsequent DSM-III-R manual listed
a singular ADHD condition with criteria deﬁning in-
attention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity. DSM-IV and
DSM-5 allowed for (i) predominantly inattentive, (ii)
predominantly hyperactive/impulsive and (iii) combined
types and listed identical criteria sets. While DSM-IV had
a criterion requiring there to be several symptoms present
prior to 7 years of age, the relevant DSM-5 criterion was for
symptoms to be present prior to 12 years of age. Such
minor changes evidenced across the decades from DSM-III
to DSM-5 argue against any increased prevalence re-
ﬂecting a major change in diagnostic deﬁnition.

Other explanations of any temporal change could (a)
reﬂect new ‘variants’ of the conditions emerging, (b) be
a referral bias perhaps reﬂecting greater awareness of the
conditions by those in the community or of individuals
with the condition and so leading to an increase in
clinical referral rates, (c) reﬂect milder versions previously
remaining undetected till adulthood and/or (d) reﬂect
there being a true increase in incidence.
‘Late-onset ADHD’ is generally conceptualized as cap-
turing those with clear-cut ADHD in adulthood but
without any salient criteria in childhood. Its status is
informal as DSM-5 requires (as noted) symptoms to have
been present ‘prior to age 12 years’. In a longitudinal New

Zealand study, Mofﬁt et al.5 reported that study partic-
ipants having such a sub-type did not show neuro-
psychological deﬁcits in childhood and suggested that
aetiological factors in play for this variant differed from
ones contributing to childhood onset ADHD. Sibley et al.6
undertook a survey of adults lacking ADHD criteria in
childhood but meeting some criteria in adulthood. They
judged that their sample members were more likely to
have non-impairing cognitive ﬂuctuations, a comorbid
disorder or were experiencing cognitive effects of sub-
stance use, allowing that late-onset ADHD might be
‘pseudo-ADHD’.

I now offer some recent clinical observations. Only
a minority of adults whom I suspect as having late-onset
ADHD afﬁrm classic features during primary school (e.g.
being inattentive, highly distractible, disruptive and hy-
peractive) or over-represented features (e.g. inability to
read a book and7 being the ‘class clown’8). The majority
report being able to read without difﬁculty in primary
school and, if then distractible or inattentive, judge such
features as minor. In secondary school, they rarely re-
turned low grades and only report their suspicion of
ADHD arising from difﬁculty with educational assign-
ments or occupational tasks. They rarely show distinct
hyperactivity during interview but commonly report
being generally ﬁdgety, inattentive and distractible. Most
are capable of sitting through a ﬁlm at a theatre but tend
to scan when reading, and if watching television, report
attentional difﬁculty, generally having frequent breaks to
wander around the room or access their phone multiple
times.

Those in the late-onset group also generally report a dis-
tinct improvement in concentration and attention with
a stimulant, which might conﬁrm an ADD/ADHD di-
agnosis or simply reﬂect general beneﬁts (improved
concentration, task organization, focus and attention)
experienced by those who do not have ADD or ADHD.

If late-onset ADD/ADHD is a valid condition what might
be the aetiological candidates? ‘True’ ADD/ADHD has
high hereditability, with a meta-analysis by Nikolas and
Burt9 quantifying genetic factors as accounting for 71%
and 73% respectively, in relation to inattention and hy-
peractivity, and with environmental factors contributing
more to inattention than to hyperactivity. What envi-
ronmental factors might be in play? Clinical observation
suggests that most such patients are dogged mobile
technology users.
So, is digital media involvement a precipitant of ‘true’ late
onset ADHD? Or is reverse causality in play, whereby
those with ADHD are more likely to so engage in such
activities, or is there a bidirectional process as suggested by
Gentile et al.10 In support of the primary hypothesis,
Nikkelen et al.11 undertook a meta-analysis and quanti-
ﬁed a moderate association between frequency of use of
traditional forms of digital media (e.g. TV and video
games) and ADHD symptoms. Clariﬁcation of the primary
postulate requires a longitudinal study design, however,
and one exemplar will be noted. Ra et al.12 recruited

ﬁfteen-year-old and sixteen-year-old adolescents lacking
‘signiﬁcant symptoms of ADHD at baseline’ (p 255) and
undertook multiple follow-up evaluations. At the 2-year
reviews, those with low-frequency digital media use had
a 4.6% rate of ADHD symptoms as against rates of 9.5% in
those who engaged in high-frequency use and 10.5% in
those in even higher-frequency use.

Experiments pursuing the proposition are increasing,
albeit indirect ones. For example, Kushley et al.13 re-
cruited general population volunteers to engage in 1 week
of maximum and 1 week of minimum smart phone ac-
tivity, with levels of both inattention and hyperactivity
higher in the former phase.

Observationally, adolescents appear preoccupied with
their mobile phones while formal reports support high
usage. A US study quantiﬁed that 8–12 year olds and 13–
18 year olds used screens for an average of 5.5 and 8.7 h
each day, respectively.14 The Australian Government’s
Australian Communications and Media Authority re-
ported that, in 2020, nearly half (i.e. 46%) of Australian
children aged 6–13 used a mobile phone.15 An Australian
study16 quantiﬁed that child aged 12–13 averaged 2.2 h of
screen time on school days and 4.2 h on weekends.
Thus, rather than distinguish between ‘standard’ and late-
onset ADD/ADHD, it may be preferable to conceive of
‘inherent’ and ‘acquired’ conditions. Those in the ﬁrst
group would be more likely to report a family history,
evidence symptoms in primary school and generally have
a more severe expression of the condition than those with
a late onset and who would rarely report a family history.
Conﬁrmation of such a model would allow important re-
search. It might be hypothesized that those with inherent
ADD/ADHD would respond preferentially to a stimulant,
while those with acquired ADD/ADHD – who might also
beneﬁt from such medication – would also report some
improvement with lifestyle changes that reduce their
digital involvement. Standard measures of ADD/ADHD
status may need to be modiﬁed to capture both ex-
pressions across childhood, adolescence and early adult-
hood. Alternatively, an epigenetic mechanism may be in
play with such environmental changes increasing ADD/
ADHD symptoms, especially when it is recognized that
environmental changes can improve ADHD symptoms.17
In a recently published book, sub-titled ‘Why we need to
transform how the world sees time’, Richard Fisher18
noted that we have become a society trapped by a ‘tyr-
anny of the instant and the treadmill of the unending
now’. Digital pre-occupation and increasing pressures for
a 24/7 online presence may be setting a variant trap and
springing a new variant of ADD/ADHD into existence.
