Correctional workers (CWs) report high levels of work stressors, frequent exposures to potentially 
psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs), and substantial mental health challenges. There is 
evidence of associations between sleep disturbances and diverse mental health challenges, including 
preliminary evidence from public safety personnel; however, replications and extensions would 
better inform interventions to support mental health. The current study was designed to examine 
associations between quality of sleep, work stress, and mental health disorders in a sample of diverse 
CWs employed in a provincial correctional service in Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed from 943 
CWs who participated in the cross-sectional, web-based Ontario Provincial Correctional Worker Mental 
Health and Well-Being Study conducted from December 2017 to June 2018. Sleep quality indicators 
included symptoms of insomnia, total hours of sleep per night on work nights and off-shift nights, 
number of days feeling rested per week, and overall sleep quality. Descriptive statistics, analyses of 
variance, correlational analyses, and logistic regression were used to examine relationships among 
sleep quality, stress of shift work, and mental health disorder symptoms. CWs slept an average of 
6.0 h per night when working and 7.2 h during off-shift nights. CWs reported waking up feeling rested 
an average of 2.6 days per week and rated their overall quality of sleep in the fair to poor range. 
Many CWs (64.9%) screened positive for clinically significant symptoms of insomnia. There were also 
differences across occupational groups such that CWs working as correctional officers reported the 
most sleep problems. There were statistically significant relationships between insomnia and mental 
health disorder symptoms. Higher levels of stress from shift work were associated with worse sleep 
quality. CWs, especially those working as correctional officers in a provincial prison, reported many 
indicators consistent with poorer quality of sleep. Poor quality of sleep was also associated with work 
stress and mental health disorders.

Correctional workers (CWs) serving in community or institutional settings are public safety personnel (PSP) 
who must navigate an often stressful and largely unpredictable  workplace1–5. In the current article, CWs refer 
to anyone working in community (e.g., probation and parole officers), institutional (e.g., correctional and pro-
gram officers), or administrative (e.g., support to wardens, payroll) correctional services in the Canadian prov-
ince of Ontario. Across CW positions, exposures to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTEs) are 
 commonplace5–10. PPTE exposures can have highly variable impacts, with previous evidence indicating that 
sudden violent or accidental death, physical assault, harassment, and fire or explosions are particularly com-
promising for  CWs6,10. Our data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; nevertheless, the COVID-19 
pandemic appeared to have further compromised the physical health and safety of  CWs11, potentially amplifying 
the extant mental health  challenges11, though other evidence indicates the prevalence of mental health disorders 
among CWs was similar during pre- and post-COVID-19  periods12.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreportsThere are relationships between PPTE and the prevalence of mental health  disorders6,10. Evidence from a large 
sample of CWs employed in Ontario provincial correctional services indicated more than half (56.9%) screened 
positive for one or more mental health disorder(s), with higher rates for women than for  men13. Participating 
CWs screened positive for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; 30.7%), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; 
37%), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD; 30.5%)13. There were differences in positive screening propor-
tions among the CW professional categories for correctional officers (59.0%), probation and parole officers 
(63.2%), institutional governance employees (61.0%), institutional wellness staff (43.7%), institutional training 
staff (50.0%), and institutional administrative staff (52.0%)13.

Increasingly robust evidence suggests CWs report an extremely high prevalence of exposure to  PPTEs6,10, 
including PPTEs that are specific to correctional  work14. These exposures appear to negatively impact CW mental 
 health6,10 and preliminary results suggest important interactions with  sleep15. We designed the current study to 
better understand the relationships between sleep as interacting with mental health among CWs across different 
occupational categories.

Sleep and correctional work
Mental health conditions negatively impact quality and quantity of  sleep16, as do certain behavioural health and 
lifestyle habits (e.g., poor stress management, inconsistent eating patterns). A recent PSP study including CWs 
evidenced 55% of PSP report symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia, and PSP also reported sleeping 
fewer hours on an average working night compared to the general  population15. CWs with sleep disturbances 
reported high prevalence of mental health  symptoms15, though participants were not stratified by their distinct 
occupational category. PSP who screened positive for insomnia also had up to 6.95 times the odds of screening 
positive for PTSD, MDD, GAD, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, as well as alcohol use  disorder15. A 
sleep study with the Washington State Department of Corrections employees evidenced that 28 percent of the 
sample reported sleep apnea, 45 percent reported clinically significant insomnia, and more than half reported 
sleeping less than two hours between shifts and feeling fatigued  constantly17. There was also evidence of correla-
tions between sleep problems and PPTE  exposures17.

In the general population, shift workers who presented with clinical symptoms of insomnia also reported 
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and fatigue which adversely impacted work productivity and  performance18. 
Among PSP, shift work appears inversely associated with the duration and quality of  sleep15. CW vocational 
requirements like atypical work times, working outside traditional hours, and very long shifts with overtime all 
negatively impact sleep  quality4,19. A study on shift work and its effects on the mental health of CWs documented 
the complex and interdependent relationships that exist between unpredictable working times, depression symp-
toms, and the amount of sleep  obtained4. For example, having little control over work schedules and experiencing 
increasingly unpredictable work hours were associated with greater symptoms of MDD and mitigated by having 
sufficient  sleep4.

Overall, sleep disturbances are associated with a range of mental health challenges and are a diagnostic 
criteria for several  disorders20. Sleep disruptions also appear to be risk factors for suicidal ideation, plans, and 
 behaviours21,22. The limited extant literature on rotating shift work and mental health challenges among CWs 
supports important  interrelationships15; however, the extant literature would benefit from assessments of occu-
pational stress due to shift work and the mental health of CWs across different occupational categories.

Current study
The current study was designed to examine the relationship between sleep quality and positive screens for mental 
health disorders in a cross-sectional sample of diverse CWs employed in the provincial correctional services 
of Ontario, Canada. We expected specific interactions with shift work because CWs working in community or 
institutional settings may have 24-h responsibilities while on duty, though shift lengths for correctional officers 
in particular generally range from 8 to 12 h. Nurses generally work 8, 10, or 12 h shifts but may work shifts up 
to 24 h, based on institutional need. Social workers and addiction counsellors tend to work 10- and 12-h rotat-
ing shifts. A better understanding of how sleep and shift work are associated with mental health across diverse 
CW occupational categories may help to inform meaningfully tailored mental health solutions. Accordingly, we 
expected that: (1) CWs would report sleep disturbances and lower quality of sleep; and (2) CWs who screened 
positive for a clinical diagnosis of insomnia would also report more mental health challenges, including positive 
screens for mental health disorders.

Method
Data and sample
Data for the current study were derived from the Ontario Provincial Correctional Worker Mental Health and 
Well-being  Study10,23. We collected cross-sectional data through an online survey distributed to Ontario CWs 
from December 2017 to June 2018. We invited CWs to participate through email invitations sent to all individuals 
under the employ of Ontario’s Ministry of the Solicitor General working in correctional services (approximately 
8000 people) by two agency representatives. The representations were associated with (1) Ontario’s Ministry of 
the Solicitor General, and (2) the Ontario Public Services Employees Union. Email invitations informed potential 
participants of the purpose of the survey and provided an anonymous link to each email recipient that routed 
the employee to the start of the survey, where further information related to informed consent procedures, con-
fidentiality, data storage, risks and benefits, and withdrawal of consent procedures was made available. Because 
the emails informing potential participants could be forwarded (and the listservs used had an unknown level of 
overlap), the total number of correctional employees invited to participate or the study response rate cannot be

 elsewhere13,23–25.

A total of 1487 CWs participated in the data collection. The current study included data from participants who 
completed the sections on sleep quality and mental health disorders (i.e., data required for the current analysis) 
and could be definitively placed into one of six occupational groups of interest (n = 943): (1) institutional well-
ness (e.g., nurses, social workers, counsellors); (2) institutional training (e.g., teachers, program officers, chap-
lains, volunteer coordinators); (3) institutional governance (e.g., superintendents or deputy superintendents); 
(4) institutional correctional officers; (5) probation and parole officers; and (6) institutional administration (e.g., 
administrative assistants, payroll and other support roles).

Patient and public involvement statement
There was no patient involvement, and public involvement was restricted to CWs in the Ontario provincial 
prison system.

Measures
Sleep quality
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a 7-item self-report measure designed to assess current (i.e., in the last 
month) sleep  quality26. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (very satisfied) to 4 (very 
dissatisfied). The ISI has good internal consistency, discriminatory capacity, and convergent validity in both com-
munity and clinical  samples26,27. On the ISI, a score of 10 or more has been used to indicate clinically significant 
sleep  distress26. The current study also included four single items designed to assess sleep patterns and quality 
including: (1) total hours of sleep on work nights (i.e., on average, approximately how many hours per night do 
you sleep, excluding time spent in bed not sleeping, on weeknights, or on-shift periods if you work shift work?); 
(2) total number of hours of sleep on off-shift nights (i.e., on average, approximately how many hours per night 
do you sleep, excluding time spent in bed not sleeping, on weekends, or off-shift periods if you work shift work?); 
(3) number of days per week you feel rested (i.e., on average, how many days per 7 day week do you wake up 
feeling rested?); and (4) an overall assessment of the quality of sleep (i.e., how would you rate your quality of 
sleep overall?) rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 4 (very good).

Mental health disorders
Several well-validated self-report screening measures were used to assess different types of mental health disorder 
symptoms. PTSD symptoms in the past month were assessed with the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-
5)28. A positive screen for PTSD was indicated if the participant reported exposure to at least one traumatic event 
on the Life Events Checklist for DSM-528,29, met minimum criteria on each symptom cluster of the PCL-5, and 
had a total score > 32 on the PCL-528. MDD symptoms in the past 14 days were assessed with the 9-item Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)30. A positive screen for MDD was indicated by a total score > 9 on the PHQ-931. 
GAD symptoms in the past 14 days were assessed with the 7-item GAD Scale (GAD-7)32. A positive screen was 
indicated by a total score > 9 on the GAD-733. Panic disorder symptoms in the past 7 days were assessed with 
the 7-item Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)34. A positive screen for panic disorder was indicated by a total 
score > 9 on the  PDSS34. Alcohol use disorder symptoms in the past 12 months were assessed with the 10-item 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)35. A positive screen for alcohol use disorder was indicated 
by a total score > 15 on the  AUDIT36. Participants were also asked to self-report whether they had ever been 
diagnosed with several other mental health disorders, including persistent depressive disorder, bipolar I, bipolar 
II, cyclothymic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. A dichotomous variable was 
created to indicate a positive screen for, or self-report of, any mental health disorder.

Occupational stress
Occupational stress due to shift work was assessed with a single item (i.e., “Please indicate how much stress shift 
work has caused you over the past 6 months”) on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no stress) to 6 (a lot of 
stress) from the Operational Police Stress Questionnaire (PSQ-Op)37.

Sociodemographic covariates
Sociodemographic covariates included: sex (i.e., male or female), age grouping (i.e., 20–29 years, 30–39 years, 
40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60 years and older), marital status (i.e., married/common law, single, separated/
divorced/widowed, remarried), highest level of education (i.e., high school or less, some post-secondary [less 
than 4 year college/university program], university degree of 4 year college program or higher), urban versus 
rural work location, total years of service (i.e., less than 4 years, 4–9 years, 10–15 years, more than 15 years), and 
occupational category (i.e., institutional wellness, institutional training, institutional governance, institutional 
correctional officers, probation and parole officers, institutional administration).

Statistical analyses
First, we computed descriptive statistics to examine the distribution of sociodemographic covariates, sleep quality 
indicators, and mental health indicators in the sample. Second, we tested differences in mean scores associated 
with the total ISI score and other quality of sleep indicators across occupational categories using ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post-hoc tests. We also tested for differences in the prevalence of screening positive for insomnia (i.e., 
score of 10 or more on ISI) across occupational categories by changing the reference groups in a series of logistic 
regression models. Third, a series of logistic regressions models were run to examine: (1) the relationship between

positive mental health disorder screen and (2) the relationship between the total insomnia score on the ISI (total 
scores can range from 0 to 28) and any positive mental health disorder screen. Logistic regression models were 
adjusted for level of stress due to shift work scores. Logistic regression models were run in the total sample, and 
then separately for each occupational category. Fourth, we used correlational analyses to examine the correlation 
between the total insomnia score on the ISI and total mental health disorder screening measure symptom scores. 
Correlational analyses were also used to examine the correlation between the other four sleep quality indicators 
and level of stress due to shift work scores. Complete case analysis was used for all statistical models and Stata 
(version 16.1) software was used for all analyses. Results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.

Ethics approval statement
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Queen’s University and Affiliated Health Sciences Centre 
Research Ethics Board (file #6024787), as well as the Research Ethics Boards at the University of Regina (file 
#2017-098) and Memorial University of Newfoundland (file #20201330-EX). All methods were performed in

reported more than 15 years). Most participants worked as institutional correctional officers (59.3%) or proba-
tion/parole officers (16.5%). Fewer participants reported working in the other occupational categories (e.g., 3.1% 
working in institutional administration; 9.5% working in institutional governance).

Descriptive information regarding sleep quality indicators across occupational categories are provided in 
Table 2. CWs reported sleeping an average of 6.0 h on work nights and 7.2 h on off-shift nights. There were 
statistically significant differences in hours slept across occupational groups; specifically, participants working 
as correctional officers or in institutional governance reported fewer hours of sleep on work nights and during 
off-shift nights than probation/parole officers on work night and off-shift nights, or than participants working 
in institutional wellness on work and off-shift nights. CWs reported feeling rested upon waking only 2.1 days 
(out of 7) per week on average. The mean quality rating of sleep was 1.6, indicating overall sleep quality in the 
poor to fair range. Correctional officers reported fewer days waking up per week feeling rested than institutional 
wellness employees. Correctional officers and probation/parole officers also reported a lower overall quality of 
sleep rating than participants working in institutional wellness. Many CWs from each occupational category 
reported symptoms consistent with clinical insomnia. Most participants (64.9%) screened positive on the ISI 
for insomnia. There were statistically significant differences in both positive screens for insomnia and on mean 
ISI scores across some occupational groups; specifically, correctional officers and participants working in insti-
tutional governance reported a higher prevalence of screening positive for insomnia than participants working 
in institutional wellness. Correctional officers also reported higher mean ISI scores than participants working 
in institutional wellness.

Logistic regression analytic results are provided in Table 3 (dichotomous insomnia variable as independent 
variable) and Table 4 (total insomnia score as independent variable). Logistic regression analyses indicated that 
a positive screen for insomnia was associated with statistically significantly increased odds of screening positive 
for any mental health disorder in the total sample (Odds Ratio [OR] = 9.07, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 6.43,

12.80) and across most occupational categories (ORs ranged from 5.74 to 12.84; see Table 3) after adjustment 
for levels of work stress due to shift work.

The relationship between a positive screening for insomnia and any positive screen for a mental health disor-
der could not be assessed among participants working in the institutional training or institutional administration 
categories due to low cell count sizes and insufficient outcome variability. A similar pattern of results was noted 
when examining the relationship between a positive screen for insomnia and individual mental health disorders 
(see supplementary online material (Table S1) for results across individual mental health disorders).

We also assessed for relationships between the total ISI score and screening positive for any mental health 
disorder (see Table 4). In the total sample, results indicated that each unit increase in the total insomnia scale 
score was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of screening positive for any mental health 
disorder (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.33) after adjustment for levels of work stress due to shift work. A similar 
pattern was noted across all occupational groups (ORs ranged from 1.23 to 1.73). A similar pattern of results 
when examining individual mental health disorders was noted; specifically, the relationship between total ISI 
score and individual mental health disorders (see supplementary online material (Table S2) for results across 
individual mental health disorders).

Correlational analytic results are provided in Tables 5 and 6. Total ISI scores were positively correlated with 
total scores for the PCL-5, the PHQ-9, the GAD-7, the PDSS, and the AUDI measures (see Table 5). The level of 
stress associated with shift work was inversely correlated with the additional quality of sleep indicators including 
total hours of sleep on work night, total hours of sleep on off-shift nights, days a week feeling rested, and overall 
quality of sleep rating.

The nature of correctional work impacts several aspects of CW well-being including job performance, physical 
health outcomes, mental health, and suicidal thoughts and  behaviours1,2,13. The current study focused on the 
lesser-explored effects of correctional work on the duration and quality of sleep patterns and associated symptoms 
of various mental health disorders. More than half of the current CW sample screened positive for insomnia. 
There was evidence of a higher prevalence of insomnia (and poor sleep quality) among correctional officers when 
compared to CW employees working in institutional wellness. Most CWs reported obtaining only a poor or fair 
quality of sleep each night. Insomnia symptom scores were positively associated with screening positive for one 
or more mental health disorders, which is consistent with prior  research15.

Most participants reported poor overall sleep quality and screened positive for insomnia. There were statisti-
cally significant differences across the occupational categories of CWs, suggesting that there may be distinct risk 
patterns of sleep disturbances associated with different roles. Most participants were institutional correctional 
officers who may have greater variability in work hours, schedules, and increased requirements to work shifts 
or overtime during staff shortages. The current results appear consistent with other studies that suggest sleep 
patterns among all Canadian PSP may be impacted by work hours, schedules, and increased requirements to 
work  shifts6,38. In the current study, the odds of screening positive for any mental health disorder were associ-
ated with disrupted sleep quantity and quality, and the prevalence of positive screens for insomnia were similar 
to results from studies with diverse  PSP15, police  officers39,40, and  firefighters41. Future research should explore 
potential associations between different types or patterns of shift schedules, the level of reported insomnia and 
poor sleep quality, and interactions with sex and gender. We further recommend qualitative explorations of 
CW sleep patterns and quality to better understand the social and organizational contexts underpinning CW 
experiences with sleep and mental health.

The National Sleep Foundation guidelines recommended that adults work to achieve 7–9 h of sleep on a 
nightly basis for optimal physical and mental well-being42. There is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and 
mental health documented in non-correctional populations wherein nighttime sleep disturbances interfere with 
daytime mood and cognitive processes, which then contribute to difficulties falling or staying  asleep22. Insomnia 
also appears to be a  transdiagnostic22 and precursory factor for several mental health  disorders15,22,43. Interven-
tions that target insomnia may also help to reduce the diverse mental health challenges among PSP, particularly 
CWs. Policies and organizational practices that explicitly target sleep hygiene behaviours must consider shift 
length, pattern, and work hours, along with sleeping timing and  exercise44–47 as part of organizational efforts to 
improve CW sleep quality and therein mental health and well-being. Implementing evidence-based organiza-
tional policies regarding shift work and integrating educational awareness campaigns about proper sleep hygiene 
practices into PSP training  programs15 may serve as protective factors against the development of negative health 
outcomes. Support from supervisors and increased job autonomy are also important factors in making CWs feel 
safe and secure within the confines of their often stressful  workplaces2. General mental health improvement and 
behavioural interventions have demonstrated effectiveness for improving sleep quality and quantity, with most 
treatment programs for insomnia focusing on a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural  interventions48.

Limitations
The current study has several limitations that help inform directions for future research. The sample was self-
selected and the response rate cannot be definitively calculated; as such, the results may not generalize to pro-
vincial and territorial CW populations in other Canadian regions. The current study was Ontario specific, which 
may limit generalizability to other jurisdictions, including the Canadian federal correctional service (Correctional 
Service Canada), which is the government agency responsible for servicing justice-involved populations serving 
court-imposed sentences of a term of two years or more. The sample used in the current study was not a random 
probability sample of provincial CWs in the province of Ontario, which limits our ability to make inferences 
even in this population. Responses were based on anonymous online self-reported data; as such, despite findings 
being consistent with previous related  research15, clinical reliability and validity remain ambiguous. Participants 
may also under- or over-report clinical symptoms because of mental health stigma or confidentiality concerns 
that still permeate some correctional  workplaces49.

Future research would benefit from replication with structured clinical interviews. Sleep problems (i.e., hav-
ing trouble falling/staying asleep) are also included as mental health disorder symptoms on the mental health 
disorder screens used in the current study (i.e., on the PTSD and MDD screens), which could have over-estimated 
relationships between sleep problems and mental health disorders. The insomnia, sleep quality, and mental health 
disorder measures used in the study also largely represented current functioning (time frames assessed ranged 
from past 12 months to the past 7 days), and we also did not have information on the onset of insomnia, sleep 
problems, or mental health disorders. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the onset of these issues occurred 
before or after respondents entered correctional work. This work is also based on the assumption that insomnia 
predicts mental health disorders, and it could be that mental health disorders also contribute to insomnia or other 
sleep problems, or that bidirectional relationships exist. Lastly, the data were cross-sectional, precluding discus-
sions of causality; thus, future CW sleep research would benefit from using prospective longitudinal designs.

Conclusion
The current study highlights the relationship between sleep quality and mental health disturbances in a popula-
tion that necessarily navigates pervasive psychological and physical stressors. The current study replicates and 
extends previous research regarding sleep and mental health among PSP. The results underscore that CWs expe-
rience substantial challenges with sleep that were associated with symptoms of several mental health disorders. 
The results also showcased differences between CW occupational categories. Correctional officers reported

insomnia. CWs reported waking up feeling rested on less than 3 days in a normal week and the stress of shift 
work was inversely correlated with sleep quality. Institutional correctional officers and institutional governance 
workers reported less sleep on work nights than CWs working in wellness, training, probation and parole, and 
administration. Overall, the results call for tailored interventions and policy changes that may help to improve 
sleep quality and reduce the mental health challenges experienced by CWs.

Strengths and limitations
The current study is the first to examine sleep disorders among correctional workers across diverse occupational 
categories.

•  The current study is comprehensive and includes a vast sample of a mixed group of correctional workers.
•  The study is limited in that we cannot report on a sampling frame.
•  The study is limited as the data are self-reported rather than based on diagnostic interviews.

Data availability
The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due to ethics and 
research agreements with diverse services but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
