Summary

Mental illnesses arise from dysfunction in the brain. While numerous extraneural factors influence 
these illnesses, ultimately it is the science of the brain that will lead to novel therapies. 
Meanwhile, our understanding of this complex organ is incomplete, leading to the oft-repeated 
trope that neuroscience has yet to make significant contributions to the care of individuals with 
mental illnesses. This review seeks to counter this narrative, using specific examples of how 
neuroscientific advances have contributed to progress in mental health care in the past, and how 
current achievements set the stage for further progress in the future.

Introduction

To lay the groundwork for this review it is first necessary to define its boundaries. In 
particular, it is useful to consider what is meant by the term, “mental illness.” This term, 
and its partner, “mental health,” are frequently used and less frequently defined. In the 
context of neuroscience research, there is much interest in understanding the neurobiological 
underpinnings of the full range of cognitive, behavioral and emotional phenomena in 
health and illness. Here, we will focus on those aspects of these phenomena associated 
with illness in particular. But for mental illnesses in general and mood and anxiety 
disorders in particular, the line between health and illness can be fuzzy. The line between 
different disorders can be even fuzzier. Operationally, psychiatrists and other mental 
health professionals distinguish between health and illness with the catch-all statement 
that mental health symptoms must “cause clinically significant distress or impairment in

social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (REF DSM-V).” Individuals are 
classified by disorders according to their presenting symptoms, as opposed to lab tests or 
etiologically relevant findings.

For neuroscientists studying human subjects, utilizing these categories has been useful in 
some fields (such as genetics) and less useful in others (such as neuroimaging), in terms 
of identifying robust correlates of illness in general and specific disorders in particular. 
Accordingly, there has been a relatively recent trend towards studying the neuroscience of 
specific domains of function – using classification systems such as the Research Domain 
Criterion (RDoC) framework advanced by the National Institute of Mental Health1– to 
elucidate neurobiological pathways that might be disrupted in illness. These approaches 
are particularly relevant for neuroscientists, as it is much more straightforward to translate 
domains of function across species, compared to multifaceted and heterogeneous disorders. 
Accordingly, this review will focus less on models of disorders per se and instead note 
how advances in the understanding of domains of function have and can result in improved 
approaches to care.

In this context, it is also useful to consider what is meant by neuroscience. While 
the symptomatic expression of mental illness is instantiated in the brain, other organ 
systems play important roles. The immune and gastrointestinal systems, for example, 
have been implicated in mental illness risk, mediated by hormones, neurotransmitters 
and perhaps even cells that convey signals to the brain, especially during the periods 
of neurodevelopment when critical neural circuits are being established and modified2–5. 
Humoral stress hormones, which represent a collaboration between the central nervous 
system and peripheral organs, similarly affect brain function directly and indirectly, with 
profound effects on functional domains relevant to mental illness6. Research in these areas 
have played important roles in the understanding and treatment of mental illness, but this 
review will focus predominantly on those advances arising from an understanding of the 
brain per se.

With the understanding that mental illness lies in the brain, and that the neuroscience of 
mental illness comprises the study of the brain basis of functional domains of behavior, 
cognition and emotion, this review will discuss first how past neuroscience discoveries have 
led to currently available clinical approaches to mental illnesses. Next, the focus will shift to 
the remarkable progress made in recent years in genetics and molecular neuroscience, neural 
circuits, and computational approaches. In each of these areas, promising technological 
and conceptual advances have dramatically enhanced our knowledge of the neurobiology 
of functional domains of relevance to mental illness. Recent advances in each area will 
be discussed and related to the potential for translating these advances into novel clinical 
approaches.

The past as prescience: Neuroscience contributions to existing therapies

Any discussion of the neuroscientific contributions to currently availably therapies for 
mental illnesses must contend with the frequently cited notion of accidental discovery. 
Indeed, as noted by Hyman7, the discovery of many first-in-class psychiatric drugs “had

an important component of serendipity.” For example, lithium was actually first used for 
mood disorders in the late 19th century, long before it was rediscovered in the 1940s8. 
Both the initial attempts and the later verification of its efficacy for treating mania were 
predicated on incorrect pathophysiological theories9. Yet even for early exemplars of 
pharmacotherapy, neuroscience played an important, if supporting role. Chlorpromazine, 
the first antipsychotic, was derived from phenothiazine antihistamines, long known as 
effective sedatives8. Chlorpromazine was initially synthesized and studied for its potential 
to supplement anesthetics; it failed in that regard but was purposefully tested for sedation in 
agitated patients with psychosis, where it was then found to reduce psychosis10. Similarly, 
the first antidepressant, imipramine, was also derived from antihistamines; it too was tried 
for psychotic patients, following on the chlorpromazine results. While it failed to reduce 
psychosis, its effects suggested potential at reducing depressive symptoms. Further testing 
in individuals with non-psychotic depression confirmed its therapeutic potential11. Both 
drugs, therefore, arose from an understanding of actions at the histamine receptor, even if 
their therapeutic potential was other than originally intended based on the neuroscientific 
knowledge at the time.

Neuroscience arguably played a large role in the expansion of options beyond these initial, 
mostly serendipitous forays into psychopharmacology. For example, following the discovery 
of the effects of chlorpromazine and the development of additional phenothiazines, 
combined rodent behavioral studies and receptor binding assays demonstrated that 
antipsychotic efficacy correlates with D2 receptor binding12,13. This demonstration paved 
the way for the further development of additional antipsychotics. Similar discoveries about 
the mechanisms of clearance of neurotransmitters by reuptake pumps led to the plethora 
of novel classes of antidepressants in use today. Most notably, this work included the 
demonstration that imipramine and other psychotropic drugs inhibit norepinephrine reuptake 
by Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod and colleagues14.

One area where basic neuroscience has played a crucial role in existing therapies for 
mental illness is brain stimulation. The initial forays into direct electrical stimulation 
were motivated by basic science questions such as the role of the brain in the generation 
of movement and sensory percepts15 and led to later efforts attempting to resolve the 
mind-brain problem16. The functional maps generated by these studies led to the notion 
that cognitive and emotional functions might be similarly localized in the brain, and 
therefore attempts to stimulate specific areas of the brain to treat mental illnesses with 
greater precision than could be achieved by whole brain stimulation via electroconvulsive 
therapy17. These early attempts were greatly improved once neuroimaging studies resulted 
in more informed hypotheses regarding the localization of dysfunction in mental illness, 
coupled with approaches that enabled precise electrical stimulation of deep structures. Deep 
brain stimulation is now being investigated for major depressive disorder and obsessive 
compulsive disorder18,19, and is poised to undergo additional basic science-inspired 
improvements with individualized approaches based on patients’ specific neurophysiological 
signatures20.

Laying a Foundation for the Future: Genetics and Molecular Neuroscience

These accomplishments notwithstanding, mental illness care stands to benefit tremendously 
from a future in which the brain mechanisms of these illness are understood with much 
greater clarity and specificity. Hampering efforts aimed at mechanism has been an inability 
to define the specific causes of mental illnesses and uncover the brain-based consequences 
of those specific causes. Historically, the field has known that mental illnesses arise 
from a combination of familial and environmental factors. In this past few decades these 
early inferences have been refined further; familial factors are mostly but not entirely 
accounted for by genetic inheritance, while environmental factors include a range of 
different exposures including prenatal infections and famine, childhood adverse experiences, 
chronic stressors, and acute traumatic events21–26. Translating knowledge about these risk 
factors into actionable biology has been extremely challenging. In recent years, however, 
rapid advances have been made in molecular neuroscience and in genetics that promise to 
accelerate the identification and exploitation of novel targets for therapies.

Progress in the Genetic Understanding of Mental Illnesses

As little as 15 years ago, the field of genetics of mental illness was a minefield of 
unreplicated results and confusing wild goose chases. That changed with the realization, 
borrowed from other branches of medicine, that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
could reveal the underlying genetic architecture of disorders like schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder which are clearly genetic but also non-mendelian. Initial efforts such 
as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium have amassed samples that number in the 
tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals, though such samples are composed 
mostly of individuals of European descent. These studies have revealed hundreds of loci 
throughout the genome that are unequivocally linked to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
major depressive disorder, and other mental illnesses27. Each of these loci represents a 
biological clue that has the potential to unlock mechanistic information regarding the origins 
of mental illnesses and could lead to targetable biological mechanisms.

These initial efforts have been limited by the lack of diversity of genetic ancestry in current 
datasets. To ensure that the advances gleaned from genetics are applicable to all human 
populations, concerted efforts must be made to enrich the diversity of subjects included 
in ongoing studies. Accordingly, the National Institute of Mental Health has launched the 
Ancestral Populations Network28,29, an effort to accelerate gene discovery in non-European 
populations across the globe. Expanding diversity in genetic samples promises not only to 
increase equity in the applicability of genetic results in the clinic, but also to improve the 
ability to understand the underlying biology of existing gene variants30,31.

From Genes to Biology

For example, in schizophrenia, the most significant GWAS locus identified to date is 
linked to a gene for a component of the complement pathway32. The risk allele appears 
to contain a duplication of the complement component 4A gene, likely resulting in increased 
expression of the protein32. Basic neuroscience studies carried out in parallel demonstrated 
that complement proteins in the central nervous system can bind synapses and target them

for degradation by microglia33. Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that excessive 
synaptic pruning could play a role in schizophrenia, especially during a prodromal state 
prior to the onset of fulminant psychosis. Thus, overexpression of complement component 
4A protein could raise the risk for schizophrenia by enhancing synaptic pruning. Current 
studies are aimed at testing this hypothesis in both patients and model systems.

The complement component 4A story represents a significant milestone for psychiatric 
genetics in linking a risk factor to neurobiological mechanism. However, the vast majority of 
the hundreds of GWAS loci are not so straightforwardly linked to mechanism. For most loci, 
the sequence variation to which the risk is attributable is difficult to definitively identify; 
the functional impacts of even identified risk variants are difficult to define. Even if the 
functional impacts could be understood on the molecular level, the small relative risk of 
these variants means that it is challenged to understand the relevant consequences at the 
level of circuits and behaviors. A systems biology approach will be necessary given that 
the risk for mental illness is likely conferred by the combined action of many of these 
small effect size variants. These challenges have so far limited the immediate impact of 
GWAS-based gene discovery for mental illness.

The more recent advent of large-scale sequencing holds the promise of more rapid progress. 
In both autism and schizophrenia, a number of individual variants have been discovered, 
each of which appear to confer substantial increases in risk on its own34. While uncertainty 
remains with regard to the reliability and generalizeability of these finding, large effect-size 
variants are much more straightforward to tie to neurobiological consequences, since they 
typically occur in the coding sequences of genes and therefore disrupt specific biological 
processes. From the perspective of treatment development, these large-effect variants are 
amenable to genetic strategies to restore gene function; efforts are already underway to 
design and test such strategies for Fragile X and Angelman’s Syndrome35–38.

Advances in high-resolution, high-throughput molecular neuroscience

From the neuroscience perspective, these genetic findings provide the foundation for an 
understanding of the neurobiology of risk for these mental illnesses. Genes that raise 
risk for autism point to early neural development, synaptic function, and the regulation 
of gene expression as important biological pathways39,40. Similarly, schizophrenia genes 
implicate synaptic function and plasticity, as well as neuroimmunological links and 
glutamatergic neurotransmission as likely candidate mechanisms41. As the understanding 
of the biological impacts of risk variants increases, these clues will multiply, guiding 
neuroscience investigations towards more relevant biology, aiding translation and facilitating 
treatment development.

In order to make the most of these genetic clues the implicated biology needs to 
be located within specific components of neural circuitry. This assertion is based on 
the notion that neural circuits are the building blocks of behavior within the brain. 
Furthermore, the building blocks of neural circuits are specific cell types, each comprised 
of unique combinations of molecule machinery that endow them with specific anatomical, 
biochemical, and physiological features. Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell 
technologies have enabled advances in determining and measuring these cell types and their

unique properties. A visionary project of the National Institutes of Health Brain Research 
Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative developed these 
technologies with the aim of establishing an atlas of brain cells in humans, non-human 
primates, and mice. In principle, each brain cell would be identified based on its gene 
expression patterns, morphology, electrical chemical properties, and its connectivity with 
other brain cells. The Initiative’s Cell Census Network published 21 papers in December 
202342–62, characterizing the gene expression patterns of over 3 million human brain 
cells. These studies identified over 3000 distinct human brain cell types. Moreover, they 
performed comparative analysis to explore the biological principles that anchored these 
putative circuit elements across mammals. Work to further expand these human, non-human 
primate, and mouse atlases are ongoing; yet even these initial findings exponentially advance 
knowledge about the specific cells that compose brain circuits, and the molecular signatures 
that can be used to target them for precise experimental manipulations in preclinical 
models. Critically, efforts must be made to ensure that these human atlases generalize across 
populations to ensure that therapies that emerge from these transformative scientific thrusts 
benefit all63,64.

Building on the Foundation: The Promise of Novel Approaches to Neural 

Circuits

Current evidence suggests that, rather than the neurodegenerative or anatomical changes 
that accompany most neurological disorders, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved 
in psychiatric disorders result in altered functional properties of interconnected neuronal 
populations, ultimately disrupting their relationship with one another{Segal, 2023 #27}. 
Thus, discovering the neural mechanisms for emotions in health and illness necessitates a 
conceptual framework built up from the properties of individuals neurons including their 
location and electrochemical identities, and extending to how these cells integrate their 
function within a circuit.

With a focus towards understanding the human brain, the BRAIN Initiative and other efforts 
have advanced an array of tools to define the molecular and electrochemical signatures of 
circuit elements in the brain, as noted above, but also to determine how those elements 
are integrated into complete neural circuits, and to monitor the activity of these integrated 
elements concurrently. Most of these tools have been used to investigate the functional 
properties of circuits in model organisms such as mice. While there are challenges in 
translating from mouse to human, the knowledge garnered from these efforts promise to 
yield knowledge about how the brain uses spatially separated neural circuits to encode 
emotions under healthy conditions, and how this encoding changes in the brain in the 
context of psychiatric pathology. In the long run, translation of these approaches from 
the laboratory to the clinic hold promise for diagnostic approaches and curative therapies 
anchored in the biology of emotional circuits.

Tools to measure the activity of integrated circuit elements

For decades, the field has histologically quantified changes in immediate early gene 
expression as a proxy of neuronal activation. Now, an exciting advance enables the detection

of inhibition of neuronal activity using analogous methods65. Together, these approaches 
enable the broad and unbiased detection of cells whose activity track with behavior across 
the whole brain.

Viral tools have also been optimized over the last decade to facilitate delivery of biological 
sensors to precise neurons based on their activity patterns66, their connectivity patterns, their 
innate promotors or enhancers67, or the enzymes those cells are engineered to express. 
Multiple new classes of fluorescence-based sensors now detect intracellular calcium, 
intracellular voltage, and neurotransmitter and neuropeptide levels with high temporal 
resolution68–70. These sensors have been combined with an expanding toolbox of modalities 
including microendoscopy, wide-field imaging, and fiber photometry to assess the activity of 
biologically defined cell types in freely behaving preclinical model organisms. Additionally, 
many of these approaches have been expanded over the last few years to enable monitoring 
of neural activity across many brain regions concurrently71, moving the field closer towards 
quantifying the activity of full circuits distributed across brain sites. Silicon based probes 
developed in the last decade also enable neuronal activity to be measured from many 
brain sites concurrently. Indeed, several preparations allow the simultaneous monitoring 
of thousands of neurons from tens of brain areas in preclinical models. Efforts are now 
integrating this technology with methods for manipulating the activity of precise circuit 
elements, towards a long-range objective of deploying the devices in the human brain72.

Tools to modulate neuronal activity

Over the last 20 years, optogenetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer 
drugs (DREADDs) have provided the field unprecedented ability to bidirectionally modulate 
the activity of brain cells in freely behaving animals. Efforts to optimize these tools 
include engineering opsins that are increasingly sensitive to red shifted light, such that 
they can be activated non-invasively. Scientists have also implemented novel methods for 
delivering complex patterns of light into the brain including those based on ongoing brain 
activity73 and in complex spatial distributions using holographic images74. Furthermore, 
new DREADDs ligands provide increased specificity in receptor targeting75, ultimately 
reducing off-target effects. These tools continue to be integrated with viral resources for 
directing their expression based on the ever-expanding body of genetic markers that define 
precise circuit elements. Finally, emerging viral approaches for accessing brain tissue via the 
circulatory system raise great hope for non-invasive deployment of these tools in humans76.

Pharmacology has been fundamental to the treatment of psychiatric disorders for the greater 
part of the last century. New approaches now seek to integrate pharmacological approaches 
with clearly delineated brain circuits as a pathway to optimized therapeutics. One such 
emerging approach is based on uncaging, where pharmacological agents capable of crossing 
the blood brain barrier are contained within inert nanoparticles. These agents are then 
‘uncaged’ from the nanoparticles using a non-invasive actuator such as focused ultrasound. 
This yields a focal release of the pharmacological agent within local intravascular 
environment of a brain region77.

An exciting approach advancing brain cell-type specific pharmacology is Drugs Acutely 
Restricted by Tethering (DART)78. Here, viral delivery tools are used to express enzymes

selective for pharmacological agents on specific brain cell types. When a low concentration 
of these pharmacologic agents is delivered to the brain via an implanted canula, the enzymes 
bind to them. Because the enzymes are designed to be situated adjacent to a receptor for 
the pharmacological agent, the enzyme facilitates a natural interaction between the agent and 
the receptor target. In the absence of the enzyme, the concentration of the pharmacological 
agent is too low to yield a biologically meaningful interaction with the receptor. Thus, 
DART enables pharmacological manipulation of genetically defined cell types.

Together, these and other emerging methods provide the field with methods for dissecting 
the role of brain circuits in behavior in preclinical models. Furthermore, they forecast an 
exciting new route to pharmacotherapeutic delivery and specification based on emerging 
knowledge of the neural circuits underlying emotion in illness states.

Towards human neuroscience

As noted above, much of the work with circuit tools have been conducted in mouse models. 
Ultimately discovering the mechanisms that underlie psychiatric pathology will require 
deploying these new technologies in humans. Such efforts are already underway. Intracranial 
electrical recordings, from multiple sites concurrently, have already identified putative 
circuits that contribute to anxiety and mood dysfunction79,80. For example, one of these 
studies discovered synchronized beta (13–30Hz) oscillations between hippocampus and 
amygdala in research subjects with heightened trait anxiety80. Follow up preclinical studies 
revealed that beta oscillations between these regions synchronized during anxiety-related 
behavior in mice and linked them to the activity of local somatostatin positive interneurons. 
Moreover, manipulating the activity of these cells using optogenetics bidirectionally 
impacted anxiety-related behavior in the mice81. Together, these cross-species studies 
highlight a potential path for therapeutic development in which pharmacological approaches 
which target individual cell types can be deployed. Alternatively, devices which concurrently 
stimulate electrical activity in multiple sites of the brain may serve to bidirectionally 
regulate synchrony in a manner that shapes emotional function in humans. Finally, recording 
techniques have already been integrated with direct electrical stimulation of deep brain 
tissue in humans in limited instances20,82, further expanding the potential for targeting 
therapeutic stimulation based on individual brain physiology.

Integrating Across levels with Computational Approaches

Integrating the biochemical insights gleaned from genetics and molecular neuroscience with 
circuit-level descriptions of behavior enabled by these novel approaches to interrogating the 
living brain remains a significant challenge. The emerging field of computational psychiatry 
may hold the key to this integration. In the last decade, the field of psychiatry has witnessed 
a paradigm shift, where cognitive neuroscience constructs of mental health are increasingly 
complemented by data-driven and mechanistic neurocomputational modeling83–85. These 
mathematical and theoretical approaches hold considerable promise for transforming 
our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. Broadly, computational 
psychiatry can be divided into two primary approaches: data-driven and theory-driven86,87.

Data-driven approaches

Page 9

A central unresolved question in psychiatry revolves around making accurate individual 
predictions, such as determining who will respond to a specific treatment and identifying 
who is at risk of relapse. Data-driven computational psychiatry leverages machine learning 
algorithms to predict key clinical outcomes in psychiatric disorders, including treatment 
response or risk of relapse. The ability of these models to analyze large volumes of patient 
data to pinpoint critical genetic, sociodemographic, or biological markers that can predict 
illness progression and other clinically relevant outcomes positions them as powerful tools 
for advancing precision medicine, even when the underlying mechanisms of a disorder 
are largely unknown. Indeed, the application of data-driven strategies has led to several 
successes in predicting clinically relevant outcomes in psychiatry, specifically in forecasting 
remission or treatment response in conditions like depression88–92 or schizophrenia93. 
However, there are also concerns that current results might be overly optimistic and do 
not always generalize to the broader patient population94–96. For example, Checkroud 
at al. 202494 showed that machine learning models that predict treatment response to 
antipsychotic drugs in one trial failed to generalize to data from other trials. In part 
predictions fail because most clinical models are still validated within the dataset they have 
been trained on94,97; to truly validate the accuracy of a data-driven model it needs to be 
tested on patients it has never seen95. Moreover, these models often falter in the presence of 
substantial unexplained heterogeneity94,96, primarily because purely data-driven approaches 
do not account for the underlying mechanisms.

Theory-driven approaches

One solution to address heterogeneity and uncover biologically informed insights into 
disorders is through theory-driven or mechanistic models98. The premise of these models 
is that computations performed by neural systems can be described using mathematical 
formalisms. These can range from algorithmic descriptions of simple choice behavior98–100 
to highly detailed biophysical models of information exchange at the single neuron or 
population level101,102. Many theory-driven approaches have their roots in cognitive science 
where mathematical models inspired from fields like physics, statistics, and computer 
science have long been leveraged to describe and quantify behavior that is thought to 
map onto (hidden) internal computational processes such as perception98–100, decision-
making103–105, or learning98,106,107. By quantifying these processes through parameter 
estimates, mechanistic models can effectively bridge the divide between neural circuitry, 
cognition, and behavior. This makes them a powerful instrument not only to get a better 
understanding of fundamental computational processes in the brain, but also for establishing 
a link between pathophysiology and psychopathology84,98,108. Consequently, these models 
have been progressively adapted over the course of the past decade to study mental 
disorders109–111, with the idea that models can act as assays of brain function, akin to 
how a blood test might act as an assay of liver function109,112. Indeed, mechanistic models 
offer several advantages over the conventional analysis of behavior or neural activity alone. 
For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that parameter estimates derived from 
mechanistic models help distinguish clinically meaningful conditions better that traditional 
measures of behavior and/or brain activity (see for example113 and114 for depression or115 
for schizophrenia.

In addition, capturing behavior in the form of parameter estimates offers a unique 
capacity for translation. For example, the same decision-making model103,116 can accurately 
describe choice behavior and reaction times in humans117,118, monkeys119 or zebra 
fish120. This cross-species applicability enables the synthesis of varied data types, allowing 
researchers to connect variables that describe underlying decision processes to both single 
neuron or population recordings in model organisms and neuroimaging measurements in 
humans118,119. Moreover, different types of mechanistic models can be integrated to directly 
bridge different levels of description. For example, algorithmic models, which typically 
explain the computations behind behaviors like learning98,106,107,121, are increasingly being 
combined with biophysical models that detail processes at the neuron or population 
level102,122. This integration enables the tracing of behaviors and symptoms to their 
biophysical origins, offering novel insights into pathological processes and unveiling 
potential treatment targets that, for example, focus on a specific neurotransmitter system. 
Mechanistic models can also uncover mechanisms behind symptom manifestation across 
various tasks, measurements or cognitive modalities. A compelling example is a study that 
utilized a neural mass model to analyze task-based and resting-state electroencephalogram 
(EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from patients with 
Schizophrenia123. The study found that alterations at the microcircuit level, notably a 
reduced synaptic gain on pyramidal cells, could account for observations across various 
measurement types and tasks. This indicates a potentially universal mechanism behind the 
varied findings in schizophrenia, which has a direct impact for guiding the identification 
of novel drug targets. Similarly, mechanistic models of learning have been employed to 
understand the origins of compulsive behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a 
dysfunction in learning124–126. These models were able to link computational processes to 
symptom expressions specified in the DSM, such as pathological doubts126.

New developments in Computational Psychiatry

In recent years, mechanistic models have significantly advanced our understanding of 
various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia115,123,127–133, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder134}124,135,136, depression89,137,138, and addiction139–143. One of the most 
promising developments has been the integration of theory-driven models and data-driven 
approaches87,91,144,145. Specifically, the use of parameter estimates obtained from theory-
driven models as predictors in machine learning models, has led to better performance 
in predicting disorder-relevant outcomes than traditional measures of behavior and brain 
activity alone87,146,115,116. A prime example of this is a recent study that demonstrated 
that various pre-Huntington Disease stages could be differentiated from healthy controls 
on the grounds of a computational model that was fit to anti-saccade behavior, but not 
on the basis of that behavior alone146. This performance improvement is attributed to the 
fact that parameter estimates from theory-driven models can capture hidden heterogeneity 
within patient populations while reducing overall noise, thereby boosting the performance of 
machine learning models.

The integration of data-driven and theory-driven approaches also calls for a novel kind of 
big data that marries in-depth individual assessments, such as performance on specific tasks 
(‘deep data’), with evaluations across larger patient cohorts (‘wide data’). Ideally, these data

are collected longitudinally, allowing for the prospective prediction of remission, relapse, 
treatment responses, or other clinically relevant variables, with subsequent validation against 
an independent, held-out dataset. Different approaches for collecting deep and wide data are 
increasingly being explored.

One potential method is the use of smartphones for cognitive and symptom 
assessments147,148. Smartphone-based assessments have the advantage that they facilitate 
continuous monitoring of patients over extended periods of time and can reach patient 
populations that are often underrepresented in research due to geographical or mobility 
constraints. Additionally, they offer a unique opportunity to relate real-life symptom data to 
mechanistic cognitive constructs and modeling approaches149.

Additionally, there are efforts directed towards large-scale data initiatives that include the 
acquisition of behavioral and imaging data pooled across various sites and institutions150–
152.

Finally, the push toward open data sharing based on FAIR principles (Findability, 
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) will also allow the re-use of published 
datasets facilitating the validation of computational approaches using increasingly larger 
data sets153. Concurrently, the field is advancing towards the establishment of more rigorous 
standards for model validation and implementation154. This progress is facilitated by an 
expanding array of analytical toolboxes tailored for the analysis of behavioral and imaging 
data155–159.

Aside from methodological and data acquisition advancements, computational psychiatry 
has expanded into new areas. Computational psychosomatics109, for instance, places a 
renewed focus on the interplay between somatic and cognitive symptoms, acknowledging 
that psychiatric disorders often manifest in physical symptoms—changes in appetite, sleep 
patterns, discomfort, or pain— that may be rooted in neural processes. This has led to the 
expansion of computational frameworks adept at modeling the processing and regulation 
of bodily signals (interoception160,161), which have applied to medically-unexplained 
symptoms162, chronic pain163,164, or fatigue165. For example, a theoretical computational 
framework for allostatic control proposed that fatigue and depression are connected to 
chronic failures in homeostasis165. This framework specifically suggested that a reduced 
subjective experience of allostatic self-efficacy (AS) should be causally related to symptoms 
of fatigue, which has since been demonstrated in pre-registered clinical studies166.

In a similar vein, computational psychotherapy167–169 is exploring the role of learning and 
inference in enhancing the effectiveness of cognitive therapies by investigating whether 
cognitive therapies can be tailored to match an individual’s belief system and learning 
preferences, as inferred from computational models.

Despite these advancements, the translation of computational psychiatry insights into 
clinical practice remains an ongoing challenge. Future efforts will likely need to focus 
on multiple phases of clinical validation, ranging from initial proof-of-concept studies to 
comprehensive clinical trials96. This rigorous validation process, albeit resource and time-
intensive, is crucial to confirm the predictive power of these models in clinical contexts.

As computational psychiatry continues to evolve, it will likely become an essential tool for 
precision psychiatry that will enhance patient care and refine treatment strategies.

Towards the Future

Considering these advances at the molecular, circuit and computational levels, there is much 
to be optimistic about regarding future contributions to neuroscience. Nonetheless, there 
is much that remains to be done. In particular, the challenges of translating neuroscience 
knowledge gained from rodents and other genetically tractable organisms into treatment 
approaches that will be successful in humans requires greater thought and additional 
model systems. In this regard, stem cell-based models like two-dimensional cultures or 
three-dimensional organoids to study circuit processes and connect directly to genetic 
factors in human tissue. Translation may also be facilitated by the use of intermediate 
large animal organisms such as non-human primates. Additionally, the specificity afforded 
by circuit technologies belies the complexity of how these circuits actually work in the brain 
– collectively, through connected interactions, rather than isolated one at a time. It remains 
an open question as to whether the predictive models built with computational approaches – 
even those that combine theory- and data-driven methods – will identify actionable targets 
for therapy or be relevant when applied to real world cohorts of patients. Nonetheless, a 
future where a neurobiological understanding of the underpinnings of mental illness leads to 
the development of specific targets for transformative new treatments is imaginable, a bright 
edifice on the horizon, built on the foundations of knowledge generated over the past few 
decades, supplemented by today’s revolutionary new approaches.

between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) correlates with 
open arm time, a measure of anxiety-related avoidance behavior. C, D. In mice, inhibiting 
somatostatin interneurons in the BLA reduces BLA-vHPC beta coherence (C) and avoidance 
behavior (D). Figures 2B–D are reprinted from Ref. 81.

Figure 3. 
Understanding mental illness through neuroscience. Genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) on illness phenotypes reveal underlying genetic risk, which are mapped to cell 
biology through the tools of molecular neuroscience. Circuit technologies link function at 
the level of specific cells and circuit to behavior. Computational approaches refine illness 
phenotypes, defining the essential components of behavior and how they map onto circuits. 
Together, these tools have created a virtuous cycle leading to increased understanding of 
mental illness, paving the way for modern, neuroscience-inspired treatment approaches.
