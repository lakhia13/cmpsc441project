Abstract

Behavioral Inhibition (BI) is a temperament characterized in early childhood by distress to novelty 
and avoidance of unfamiliar people and is one of the best known risk factors for the development 
of social anxiety. However, nearly 60% of children with BI do not go on to meet criteria for social 
anxiety disorder. In this review we present an approach to understanding differential 
developmental trajectories among children with BI. We review research using laboratory-based 
tasks which isolate specific attention processes that enhance versus mitigate risk for social anxiety 
among behaviorally inhibited children and studies that suggest BI is associated with heightened 
detection of novelty or threat. Moreover, stimulus-driven control processes, which we term 
automatic control, increase the probability that behaviorally inhibited children display socially 
reticent behavior and develop social anxiety. In contrast, goal-driven control processes, which we 
term planful control decrease risk for anxiety. We suggest that these three categories of processes 
(detection, automatic control, and planful control) function together to determine whether 
behaviorally inhibited children are able to flexibly regulate their initial reactions to novelty, and in 
turn, decrease risk for social anxiety. Although laboratory-based tasks have identified these 
processes underlying risk and resilience, the challenge is linking them to the emotions, thoughts, 
and behaviors of behaviorally inhibited children in real-world contexts.

Developmental Trajectories

Behavioral Inhibition (BI) is a temperament characterized in early childhood by negative 
reactions to novelty including freezing, distress and withdrawal in novel situations and 
avoidance of unfamiliar contexts or people (1,2). During middle childhood, children with a 
history of BI are more socially reticent in the presence of unfamiliar peers, carefully 
watching others from the periphery (3,4). BI is the best known risk factor for the later 
diagnosis of anxiety, particularly social anxiety (5–8). Nevertheless, there is a wide range of 
variability in developmental outcomes amongst children with BI, with only some children 
going on to develop clinically significant social anxiety (6). While tracking the development 
of multiple cohorts of children from early infancy through adolescence, we (and others) have 
administered laboratory tasks assessing attention and information processing to infants, 
children, and adolescents with and without a history of BI (8–10). In doing so, we have 
described how various processes differ amongst those with and without BI as well as how 
individual differences in these processes shape the developmental pathways from early BI to 
anxiety (5,11). The purpose of the current review is to synthesize these findings within a 
heuristic model. Critically, although laboratory tasks allow for precise measures of 
information processing biases, psychologists and clinicians are ultimately interested in 
understanding their implications for more tangible and proximal correlates of childhood 
anxiety including real-world emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Thus, we also advance 
hypotheses regarding how these laboratory-based assessments relate to the naturalistic 
behaviors we have observed across two longitudinal cohorts and propose future directions 
for basic and applied research in this regard.

Though each aspect of our model (see Figure 1) will be described in detail, we begin with a 
high-level overview. Briefly, we suggest that BI is associated with heightened physiological 
and behavioral detection of novel, salient, or threatening information in the environment. 
The detection of such information (whether the result of lower threshold or heightened 
response) pulls BI children’s attention away from ongoing goal-directed behaviors (e.g., 
socializing with peers; see Figure 3). We found that the type of control processes BI children 
deploy in response to detecting such events moderates the child’s risk for anxiety (see 
Figures 2 and 4). When heightened detection is accompanied by rapid, stimulus-driven 
automatic control, attention remains fixated on the source of the detected information (e.g., a 
peer’s face following the perception of a frown) at the continued expense of actively 
engaging in the original goal-directed behavior (e.g., the social interaction). We believe this 
pattern of increased detection and automatic control is what largely drives the avoidance, 
freezing, and lack of approach behavior that is commonly observed in behaviorally inhibited 
children at risk for anxiety. In contrast, when behaviorally inhibited children detect novel, 
threatening or otherwise salient information in the environment but then deploy goal-driven 
processes known as planful control, they are able to redirect their attention towards ongoing 
activities such as social interactions, allowing for age-typical and competent social 
exchanges. We believe that the combination of increased detection and planful control

characterizes the behavior of children with a history of BI who do not go on to develop 
clinically significant anxiety. Thus, our model suggests that increased detection is associated 
with BI, whereas two distinct forms of control, automatic vs. planful, moderate risk for 
social anxiety in opposing directions; planful control is protective, whereas automatic 
control exacerbates risk.

Detection, automatic control, and planful control are not unitarity concepts supported by 
unique neural networks. Rather, each of these terms refers to a category of related processes 
that impact information processing at comparable points in time. As will become clear 
below, grouping these disparate processes into three larger categories provides heuristic 
value for synthesizing existing data and generating novel hypotheses regarding the 
mechanisms linking BI to everyday behavior and ultimate risk for later anxiety.

It is important to emphasize the central role of social context in our model. Based on years 
of observing behaviorally inhibited children interact with adults and other children in the 
laboratory, we are aware of the importance of context for understanding the link between BI 
and social reticence and social anxiety (4,5,12). In the remainder of this review, we provide 
details on the array of tasks and measures that capture specific neurocognitive processes that 
fall into the three categories introduced above (detection, automatic control, and planful 
control). However, a limitation of these carefully controlled, lab-based physiological and 
behavioral assessments is that although they are typically administered within an implicit 
social context (i.e., in the presence of an experimenter in a laboratory setting) they have 
largely been carried out without directly manipulating social context (with few exceptions; 
see (13)). Bridging the gap between measurement of these neurocognitive processes and 
social behavior is one of the challenges we attempt to address here.

Behavioral inhibition and the detection of novelty, threat, and saliency

BI is defined based on a constellation of behaviors some young children display in response 
to novelty (1,3). For example, in response to novel environments, objects, and people, 
behaviorally inhibited toddlers physically withdraw while carefully watching, seek close 
contact with familiar others (e.g., mother), express negative affect, and are verbally reticent 
(2). This temperament has been mostly studied as BI, but also as negative affectivity (14), 
dysregulated fear (15), anxious solitude/withdrawal (16), and in non-human animal models 
as anxious temperament (17) and neophobia (18). Because all these dimensions are closely 
related and it is difficult to empirically and conceptually distinguish among them, we use the 
term BI in the current review to refer to these related constructs (for a more detailed 
discussion on the similarities and differences of these different theoretical and empirical 
approaches see (19)). We (and others) hypothesized that reactivity to novel stimuli might 
originate from either a lower threshold or heightened response to detection of novel, 
threatening, or salient information in the environment. At the moment, we cannot 
differentiate among these two possibilities (lower threshold or heightened response). We can 
examine the hypotheses regarding moderation of BI by either automatic or planful control 
processes. To do so, we administered a number of highly-controlled laboratory tasks to large 
cohorts of children with carefully characterized temperaments. Although the tasks are far 
removed from the naturalistic behavioral observations from which the hypotheses were

derived, they allow reliable and precise characterizations of the processes that strengthen or 
weaken the links between BI and later anxious behaviors.

As a whole, this line of research supports the hypothesis that children with a history of BI 
display heightened responses to the detection of novel, conflicting, or salient stimuli (either 
through a lowered threshold or a stronger response). For example, infants who react 
negatively to novelty and young children with BI are more likely to exhibit heightened 
physiological responses (ERP amplitudes) to novel auditory stimuli as infants and 
adolescents (20,21), enhanced physiological (EMG) startle responses to novel auditory 
stimuli as children and adolescents (22,23), and rapid visual detection of threat (angry faces) 
in the environment as adolescents (24). By late childhood and adolescence, those with a 
history of BI exhibit greater striatal responses to reward (25–27) and punishment (28) cues, 
enhanced N2 ERP amplitudes in response to NoGo stimuli in a Go-No-Go task as children 
and adolescents (29,30), and more negative ERN ERP amplitudes to their own errors on 
speeded reaction time tasks like the Flanker task as children and adolescents (31,32). This 
pattern of enhanced response to the detection of novel, conflicting, and salient stimuli is 
hypothesized to, at least in part, reflect increased amygdala reactivity to novelty. Although 
data during infancy and childhood are lacking, individuals characterized as behaviorally 
inhibited in infancy and childhood display greater amygdala reactivity to novelty as 
adolescents and adults (33–35). More generally, the measures capturing this enhanced 
detection and their neural underpinnings are varied and clearly do not reflect the activity of a 
single, unified neural process or network. For example, the striatum is associated with 
processing reward and punishment (36) and salient information (37), whereas the amygdala 
is associated with processing threat (38) and novelty (39). Activity within the cingulate and 
regions of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) is evoked in response to conflict, errors, or other 
situations that might require increased attention (40). Despite disparate neural networks, 
these processes share the common function of registering the presence of potentially 
important (novel, salient, or threatening) information about the environment. Collectively, 
these observations suggest that BI is associated with either a lowered threshold for, or a 
stronger response to, the immediate detection of novel, salient or threatening information.

Figure 1 groups the processes described above within the left-hand box, under the heading 
“detection.” We present these detection processes along a continuum from lower-level, more 
stimulus-driven versus more goal-driven (moving from the bottom to the top of the left-hand 
box), reflecting a developmental progression (i.e., young infants primarily react to external 
stimuli, as reactions to success or failure in goal-directed behaviors emerge during the first 
years of life).

Our work and that of others make it strikingly clear that BI and anxiety are not one and the 
same. Critically, despite the fact that BI remains the best-known predictor of later anxiety, 
60% of children with BI do not go on to meet criteria for any anxiety disorder during 
childhood or adolescence (41,42). The dissociation between BI and anxiety is clear from the 
results of an early parenting intervention for children with BI that yielded substantial 
decreases in parent-reported anxiety but no changes in parent-reported BI (43,44). In an 
attempt to account for this variability in outcomes among BI children, we examined whether 
individual differences in detection processes impacted developmental trajectories (9). We

found that children and adolescents with a history of BI were at particular risk for displaying 
anxious behaviors (e.g., social withdrawal) and a variety of anxiety symptoms if they also 
displayed attention biases towards threat faces as assessed on the Dot Probe (45–51), 
heightened reactivity to novel auditory stimuli (P3) (21), increased startle responses (22,23), 
or heightened ERN to errors on a Flanker task (13,31,32). These differences in processing 
parallel findings with clinically anxious individuals, who also display an attention bias 
towards threat (52), enhanced error processing (53–55), and exaggerated startle responses 
(56). However, our research also suggests that heterogeneity in developmental outcomes of 
children with BI is due not only to differences in these quick and early initial detection 
processes, but to later control processes that either maintain/amplify the heightened response 
to detection (i.e., reactive control) or moderate the heightened detection response by flexibly 
shifting attention back towards goal-directed behavior (i.e., planful control) (57,58). These 
two types of control processes are depicted in the right-hand side of Figure 1 and are the 
focus of the section below.

Two types of control

Over the course of almost 30 years we have observed infants, children, and adolescents with 
well characterized early temperaments as they engage in social interactions with unfamiliar 
adults and peers. These observations of reticent, vigilant, and inflexible behaviors provide 
the foundation for hypotheses about how various control processes may support or hinder 
the development of social competence. Behaviorally inhibited preschoolers are more likely 
to exhibit reticent behavior in a play group of unfamiliar peers (e.g., watching others but 
remaining unoccupied, not playing with toys or with others) (4,59). When challenged in a 
novel situation (e.g., having to give a speech or when approached by a stranger), they are 
more likely to freeze (15,60). They also appear inflexible in their social problem solving and 
appear to be “spinning their wheels” when it comes to figuring out how to engage with 
unfamiliar peers especially when they are being excluded (61). Based on these observations, 
we reasoned that the development of control processes may serve as a critical moderator of 
developmental outcomes for children with a history of BI. This led to an examination of how 
various control processes might explain these differences in observed social behavior and 
risk for social anxiety.

There is a long history of studying control processes across the cognitive, developmental and 
neuroscience fields, and many taxonomies of control have been proposed (62–66). It is 
important to distinguish control processes from detection processes: whereas detection 
involves registering the presence of potentially important information, control governs what 
one does with this information through changes in attention or sensorimotor inhibition. This 
distinction between detection and control is reflected in the separation between the left- and 
right-hand sides of Figure 1. Second, there are at least two types of control processes: 
stimulus-driven processes that we term “automatic control” (bottom, right-hand box in 
Figure 1) and a category of goal-driven processes denoted “planful control” (upper, right-
hand box in Figure 1). We define automatic control as being associated with immediate, 
reactive changes in attention or sensorimotor inhibition that are in direct response to a 
stimulus or event. In contrast, planful control is associated with prolonged and proactive 
changes in attention or sensorimotor inhibition in support of a specific goal.

The dual mechanisms of control (DMC) framework (67) suggests that control processes can 
be described as either “proactive” and directed toward events in the future, or “reactive” and 
directed towards events that have just occurred. Integrating these descriptions, we suggest 
that measures and tasks tapping “proactive control” fall within the category of planful 
control (upper, right-hand box in Figure 1), whereas “reactive control” falls within the 
category of automatic control (lower, right-hand box in Figure 1). In addition to proactive 
control, task-switching also reflects a form of control that is employed in response to a 
future goal, and is listed within the planful control category as well. Finally, reactive 
inhibitory control, which can be assessed via behavioral responses on a go/nogo task, falls 
within the automatic control category.

Past work suggests that automatic control and planful control differentially impact 
behaviorally inhibited children’s risk of developing anxiety. Higher levels of planful control 
(e.g., task switching ability measured via a task or self-reports) reduce the risk of anxiety 
amongst children with a history of BI (68,69). In contrast, heightened levels of automatic 
control (e.g., reactive inhibitory control measures) increase BI children’s risk of developing 
anxiety (58,68,70). For instance, White and colleagues (68) found that the effect of BI in 
toddlerhood on preschool anxiety was differentially moderated by the levels of planful or 
automatic control - such that that high levels of attention shifting (planful control) decreased 
the risk for anxiety problems in children with high levels of BI, whereas high levels of 
inhibitory control (automatic control) increased this risk for anxiety symptoms. In line with 
the DMC framework, these two types of control are independent and children (and adults for 
that matter) regularly engage both types of control. Individuals vary in the balance or extent 
of bias in which type of control is engaged in certain kinds of situations. Two recent studies 
employing the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), in which a single bias score is 
computed to quantify relative amounts of automatic vs. planful control within an individual, 
demonstrate a contrast in the influence of different control processes in terms of moderating 
the risk for anxiety in BI (57,71). A visual representation of these relations is presented in 
Figure 2.

Although each of the categories of control (planful control and automatic control) reflect a 
number of distinct neurocognitive processes that share similar functions, we do not suggest 
that these categories are unitary constructs, nor rely on distinct, unitary neural networks. 
Exemplar brain networks involved in these two categories of control include ventral-lateral 
prefrontal cortex (72), as well as the dorsal frontal-parietal network (62,66,73). Moreover, 
both of these control categories involve inputs from and feed back to brain structures 
associated with detection (e.g., amygdala, cingulate). These processes are reciprocal in 
nature, meaning that there are most certainly interactions amongst these different brain 
structures and networks (73). Detection, particularly goal-directed aspects of the detection 
category (e.g., the processes indexed by the ERN, N2, etc.) and automatic control (e.g., 
reactive inhibitory control) appear quite similar. Indeed, both have been shown to increase 
risk for later anxiety amongst behaviorally inhibited individuals. However, most often, only 
detection exhibits direct relations with BI, whereas automatic control serves as a moderator 
of later risk for anxiety. Moreover, while detection and automatic control often co-occur, 
they are separated in time, with detection necessarily preceding automatic control; automatic 
control is thought to maintain/amplify the information processing initiated by detection

through changes in attention or inhibition of sensorimotor cortex. These dynamic 
interactions between detection, automatic, and planful control are central to understanding 
which children with BI go on to develop anxiety.

Dynamic interactions between detection, automatic, and planful control

Figure 3 presents hypothetical data highlighting the distinction between behaviorally 
inhibited children (Figure 3a) and non-behaviorally inhibited children (Figure 3b) with 
respect to detection. Children’s attention toward a novel social context and their relevant 
goal within that context is presented on the y-axis. The extent to which attention is captured 
by a salient stimulus (orange arrow) is dependent upon context and the child’s prior history 
of interaction. For example, during a social interaction with an unfamiliar peer, when a child 
perceives a salient stimulus (e.g., a negative social cue), heightened response to detection 
draws their attention temporarily away from the goal of engaging the peer (represented by 
the orange arrow). Given heightened levels of detection, the behaviorally inhibited child’s 
attention is captured to a greater extent than that of the non-behaviorally inhibited child, 
depicted as a steeper, longer arrow in Figure 3a than Figure 3b. At this point, assuming 
similar levels of control processing (represented by the purple arrows in each panel of Figure 
3), it will take longer for the behaviorally inhibited child to return their attention to the goal 
of engaging with their social partner. As such, efficient planful control processing is 
especially important for behaviorally inhibited children as a means of regulating their 
attention in response to instances of heightened detection, particularly within novel social 
contexts.

Figure 4 presents hypothetical data from two behaviorally inhibited children: one at lower 
risk of developing anxiety problems (Figure 4a) and one at higher risk of developing anxiety 
problems (Figure 4b). As mentioned above, both of these children, when confronted with 
novelty or unfamiliarity, are likely to exhibit a heightened detection response (steep orange 
arrows) to salient stimuli in the environment (e.g., a perceived error or a peer’s negative 
facial expression). However, what differentiates them, according to the present account, is 
whether they deploy automatic versus planful control in response to the detection of a salient 
stimulus. The blue and red dashed arrows represent the strength (or the bias) of the child’s 
planful and automatic control, respectively, whereas the solid purple arrow represents the 
relative degree, or extent of bias, with which these categories of control are deployed by 
these children in similar situations. The hypothetical child in Figure 4a is more likely to 
deploy planful control, reflected in the longer blue arrow pulling the child’s attention back to 
the goal-directed behavior, which here is the social interaction. As depicted by the steep 
purple arrow, this child would be predicted to flexibly adapt and quickly redirect attention 
back to the task at hand. In contrast, the hypothetical child in Figure 4b displays an 
increased reliance on automatic control and a limited ability to marshal planful control in 
such contexts. As such, this child would be predicted to freeze, sustain fixation on the 
attention-grabbing stimulus, or perhaps even engage in ruminative activity, in each case 
preventing the child from returning his/her attention to the task at hand. The inability to 
rapidly and fluidly navigate and negotiate these contextual demands may place behaviorally 
inhibited children at increased risk of developing anxiety.

Developmental implications

This approach has implications for understanding the development of cognitive control 
processes and the role these processes play in linking early BI to the emergence of anxiety. 
In normative development, detection and automatic control emerge in infancy, rooted in 
orienting responses to external factors (i.e., exogenous attention) (74). Automatic control 
processes are molded over the course of interactions with caregivers, and gradually 
transition, to more planful, endogenous forms of control (75,76). Planful control processes 
emerge during early childhood and mature over the preschool and school age period. These 
processes most likely involve executive skills such as inhibition, working memory, and 
attention shifting (58,77,78). For example, the ability to flexibly change behavior according 
to environmental demands (e.g., respond to a peer’s unexpected behavior) shows rapid 
normative development between 3 and 5 years of age (79–81). These processes continue to 
be refined with more complex and planful forms of control developing through adolescence 
(78,82,83), including a shift from more reactive to more proactive control (81, 82).

There is limited evidence on how BI (and associated heightened response to detection) alters 
normative developmental changes in control processes. One possibility is that BI has no 
direct influence on the development of control, such that these control processes develop 
orthogonally to BI and heightened response to detection. Alternatively, BI may directly 
impact the development of control processes, such that behaviorally inhibited children 
develop more automatic forms of control (e.g., increased inhibitory control), which sustains 
their inhibited responses. Recent work suggests that BI predicts higher levels of inhibitory 
control (automatic control) and lower levels of task switching (planful control) by age 7 
(69). Similarly, BI predicted a pattern of behavioral responses indicative of a more reactive 
(automatic) control and less proactive (planful) control style in adolescence (57). Similar 
relations with proactive and reactive control have been reported with temperamental 
shyness, which is conceptually and empirically related to BI (84). While there is some 
evidence that BI impacts the development of control processes, in all probability, the links 
between BI and control are both direct and indirect (see for example, (58,68)).

Conclusions and future directions

One of the most pressing questions our model raises is why some children with a history of 
BI develop biases toward automatic versus planful control. It is likely that critical 
socialization experiences foster these biases early in development. For example, BI is more 
strongly associated with social anxiety when mothers engage in highly protective or 
oversolicitous parenting (59,85,86). It may be that this type of parenting reinforces 
heightened detection responses and fosters reactive control processes by making children 
even more aware of potential risks in their environment. In contrast, more sensitive parenting 
that encourages coping and flexible problem solving may foster children’s abilities to 
engage planful control processes. Other critical factors such as socialization experiences 
(e.g., interactions with peers, teachers/caregivers, and the broader cultural context) (87–90) 
or life stressors (91) may have similar influences on the development of control biases for 
children with a history of BI.

Future work should examine the development of detection responses, automatic control, and 
planful control and the functional connectivity amongst brain structures underlying these 
neurocognitive processes. A number of research groups have started examining the 
associations between infant temperament and the development of detection and control 
processes (87,92,93); while others have begun exploring the relations between infant 
temperament and functional connectivity measures in the first year of life (94–97). 
Longitudinal studies examining detection and control processes, the brain systems 
supporting these processes, and temperament will be crucial to understand the 
developmental cascade from temperament to reticence to anxiety.

It remains unclear at the moment whether/how increased detection or automatic control 
directly relate to negative emotions. One possibility is that increases in detection and 
automatic control, even for emotionally neutral stimuli, directly lead to a negative emotional 
state. Alternatively, increased detection and automatic control may cause problems flexibly 
engaging in social interactions, which in turn may produce negative emotions. Across 
development, lowered quality and quantity of social interactions may in turn lead individuals 
to engage in patterns of thought and behavior that are associated with anxiety, such as 
ruminative thought and avoidance behavior.

Finally, future studies should focus on ecological validity examining the role of response to 
detection and control processes in contexts that are relevant to the development of anxiety. 
New technology (e.g., ambulatory eye-tracking) (98) or ecologically-valid experimental 
manipulations (13) can examine how these neurocognitive processes support anxious 
behavior.

Figure 1. 
The grouping of attentional and control processes in the current model. Bullets provide an 
example of a task used in the study of each process, with specific indices from each task 
presented in parentheses. Note that this list of example is non-comprehensive. Within the 
leftmost box labelled “Detection”, processes range continuously from “More Stimulus-
Driven” at the bottom to “More Goal-Driven”. The inclusion of this continuum reflects the 
heterogeneity of these processes along this dimension, with their unification in a single box 
reflecting the equivalency in their relations to BI in the current model. ERN = Error Related 
Negativity. MID = Monetary Incentive Delay. ABT = Attention Bias to Threat. DCCS = 
Dimensional Change Card Sort. AX-CPT = AX-Continuous Performance Task.

Figure 2. 
An illustration of the proposed developmental cascade from Behavioral Inhibition in 
toddlerhood to social behavior in later childhood. Children exhibiting BI in toddlerhood 
complete an assessment of cognitive control (e.g., AX-CPT) later in childhood. The AX-
CPT enables measurement of both automatic and planful control processes through its use of 
contextual cues (e.g., the letters “A” or “B”) that help signal to the participant how they 
should respond to an upcoming probe (e.g., the letters “X” or “Y”). Because participants are 
instructed to only respond when they see an “A” that is followed by an “X,” participants 
must use a combination of planful control (i.e., upon seeing the cue, anticipating a possible 
response to the upcoming probe) and automatic control (i.e., upon seeing the probe, 
choosing the appropriate response given the cue that was seen earlier) in order to maximize 
task accuracy. Children ending toward planful control are predicted to exhibit lower levels of 
social anxiety, while those tending toward automatic control are predicted to exhibit higher 
levels of social anxiety.
