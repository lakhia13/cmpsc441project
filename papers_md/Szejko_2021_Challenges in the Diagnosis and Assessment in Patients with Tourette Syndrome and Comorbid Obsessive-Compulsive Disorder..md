Abstract: Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterized by the presence of vocal and motor tics 
with  an  onset  in  childhood.  In  almost  80%  of  patients  psychiatric  comorbidities  coexist, 
particularly, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD)  or  behavior  (OCB),  depression,  anxiety,  rage  attacks,  and  self-injurious  behaviour 
(SIB). In this review, we discuss current state of the art regarding diagnosis and assessment 
of  tics  and  OCD  in  patients  with  TS  as  well  as  challenges  related  to  differential  diagnosis 
between tics and OCD-related phenomena based on a systematic literature search. While in 
most  cases  clinical  symptoms  can  be  easily  classified  as  either  tics  or  OCB/OCD,  some 
phenomena  lay  on  the  frontier  between  tics  and  compulsions/obsessions.  For  example, 
compulsions  may  resemble  tics  and,  vice  versa,  sequences  of  motor  tics  may  be  misdiag-
nosed  as  compulsions.  Accordingly,  the  terms  “compulsive  tics”  and  “cognitive  tics”  have 
been introduced. The most common and typical OCD symptom in patients with TS are “just 
right” phenomena, which also may show an overlap with tics, since patients may perform tics 
repeatedly  until  this  feeling  is  achieved.  Similarly,  repetitive  behaviors  in  patients  with  TS 
may  manifest  in  a  more  “tic-like”  or  a  more  “OCD-like”  type.  Furthermore,  SIB  shows 
similarities with both tics and OCD. Until today, it is unclear how to classify this symptom 
best,  although  from  most  recent  research  a  closer  relationship  between  SIB  and  tics  is 
suggested.  In  this  review,  in  addition,  we  illustrate  differences  of  the  clinical  spectrum  of 
OCD in patients with TS compared to those with “pure OCD” without tics. To assess tics, the 
revised version of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-R) should be used, while for 
the assessment of OCD, the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale (Y-BOCS) is 
recommended. Finally, we briefly summarize treatment strategies for tics and OCB/OCD in 
patients with TS.

Introduction
According  to  DSM-5,  Tourette  syndrome  (TS)  is  defined  by  the  presence  of  at 
least  one  vocal  and  multiple  motor  tics  persisting  for  more  than  1  year  with 
childhood  onset.  In  almost  80%  of  patients,  psychiatric  comorbidities  co-occur, 
the most frequently being attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obses-
sive-compulsive  behavior  (OCB)  or  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD), 
depression,  anxiety,  rage  attacks,  and  self-injurious  behavior  (SIB).1,2  The  pre-
valence of TS ranges – depending on age – from 0.3% to 1%.3–5  Tics are sudden, 
rapid,  recurrent,  non-rhythmic  motor  movements  or  vocalizations.6  Alternatively

to  the term  vocal  tics,  the name  phonic  tic is  used. Both 
motor  and  vocal  tics  can  be  further  divided  into  simple 
and  complex  tics.  Depending  on  the  movement  pattern 
motor tics, in addition, can be classified as tonic, clonic, 
or dystonic tics. In addition, some specific types of com-
plex tics include echolalia (repetition of sounds, words or 
phrases  pronounced  by  others),  echopraxia  (repetition  of 
gestures executed by others), palilalia (spontaneous repe-
tition  of  one’s  own  sounds,  words  or  phrases  sometime 
resembling stuttering or speech blocking tics), palipraxia 
(repetition of one’s own gestures), coprolalia (shouting of 
obscene words or phrases), and copropraxia (execution of 
obscene  postures  or  gestures).  Finally,  tics  are  typically 
characterized  by  brief  preceding  premonitory  sensations, 
temporal suppressibility, and a rostro-caudal distribution.
While  in  the  majority  of  patients  the  diagnosis  of 
a  primary  tic  disorder  is  easy  to  make,  in  some  patients 
the  differential  diagnosis  is  more  difficult  and  complex. 
Motor  tics  must  be  differentiated  not  only  from  other 
hyperkinetic  movement  disorders,  such  as  stereotypies, 
myoclonus,  paroxysmal  disorders,  and  epileptic  seizures, 
but  also  hyperactivity  due  to  ADHD  and  repetitive  beha-
viors  and  rituals  belonging  to  the  OCD  spectrum,  and, 
finally, from functional movements. Interestingly, the clin-
ical spectrum of OCB/OCD in TS differs from symptoms 
in  pure  OCD.  This  has  been  described  as  “tic-related 
OCD”  mainly  associated  with  “just  right”  phenomena.7,8 
However, tics and “just right” phenomena may also occur 
coincidentally.

In  this  review  we  want  to  give  recommendations  for 
the diagnosis and assessment of tics and OCD in patients 
with  TS.  To  identify  all  relevant  articles,  we  conducted 
a systematic review yielding to find publications reporting 
about OCD phenomena in TS. Furthermore, recommenda-
tions  given  by  the  European  Society  for  the  Study  of 
Tourette  Syndrome  (ESSTS)  have  been 
into 
consideration.9  Finally,  we  address  challenges  that  one 
could encounter in the management of patients with over-
lapping  tics  and  obsessions  and/or  compulsions.  In  this 
regard,  we  also  outline  differences  between  the  OCB/ 
OCD  spectrum  in  TS  compared  to  pure  OCD  (without 
tics)  and  briefly  highlight  differences  in  therapeutic 
interventions.

Methodology
We  conducted  both  a  systematic  as  well  as  a  narrative 
review  of  the  most  important  aspects  related  to  OCB/ 
OCD  in  TS.  Our  systematic  approach  was  based  on  the 

search  in  PubMed,  Ovid,  Web  of  Science,  Embase  and 
APA  Psych  Info  conducted  on  February  08,  2021.  We 
searched  for  articles  examining  the  coexistence  of  TS 
and  OCB/OCD  using  the  search  terms  “tics”  AND/OR 
“Tourette”  AND/OR  “obsessive-compulsive  disorder” 
AND/OR  “OCD”  AND/OR  “obsession”  AND/OR  “com-
pulsion”.  Reviews  and  meta-analyses  in  the  area  were 
further searched for relevant citations.

Titles and abstracts of the studies obtained through this 
search  were  examined  by  both  authors  in  order  to  deter-
mine  article  inclusion.  Each  article  was  also  checked  for 
further potential references. Discrepancies were addressed 
by  the  authors  through  discussion.  Eligibility  for  the  sys-
tematic  review  was  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (1) 
studies  involving  patients  with  TS  and  OCD,  (2)  original 
articles, and (3) studies in humans. Articles were excluded 
based on the following criteria (1) meta-analyses or review 
papers,  (2)  not  investigating  patients  with  TS  and  OCD, 
and (3) animal or other preclinical studies. Several studies 
included  data  previously  reported  elsewhere.  Data  col-
lected on each article included year, study design, number 
of subjects with TS and/or OCD, mean correlates of OCD 
in TS and the most important characteristics of OCD in TS 
in comparison  with OCD/OCB. As  a result,  we identified 
628  articles,  out  of  which  57  have  been  included  in  this 
review.  Our  search  strategy  is  illustrated  in  a  PRISMA 
flow diagram  (Figure 1).  While  in the  subsequent review, 
we included only the most relevant studies, additionally an 
extensive  list  of  all  57  publications  including  the  most 
important findings is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Diagnosis and Assessment of Tics in 
Tourette Syndrome
According  to  the  guidelines  published  by  ESSTS,9  the 
diagnosis  of  TS  should  be  made  according  to  newest 
DSM  criteria.  This  includes  the  exclusion  of  other  phe-
nomena resembling tics as well as secondary tic disorders. 
Tics are characterized by a number of clinical phenomena 
useful  to  distinguish  them  from  other  neurological  and 
psychiatric symptoms. In the majority of patients, tics are 
proceeded  by  premonitory  urges  defined  as  an  uncomfor-
table sensation of twinging, itching, or stretching, partially 
or completely relieved by the tic execution. This sensation 
is  reported  to  last  only  a  fraction  of  a  second  and  occurs 
immediately before the tic. Based on clinical experience it 
is  believed  that  the  topographic  distribution  of  premoni-
tory urges stays in line with the tic localization. Typically,

patients  can  suppress  their  tics  for  a  short  period  of  time 
ranging  from  seconds  to  minutes.10  Noteworthy,  the  pre-
sence  of  premonitory  urges  and  tics  suppressibility  are 
highly  age  dependent  as  many  children  do  not  report 
premonitory  sensations  and  feel  unable  to  suppress  their 
tics voluntarily.

Another important characteristic is that tics are influenced 
by  environmental  factors.  The  majority  of  patients  reports 
a  temporarily  tic  increase  during  stress,  emotional  tension, 
but also when talking about tics and seeing others with tics, 
while tics typically decrease with concentration and relaxa-
tion. Finally, the course of tics in TS is typically waxing and 
waning  with  respect  to  frequency,  number,  intensity,  com-
plexity, and phenomenology. The typical age at onset of tics 
is 5–7 years.11 In most patients, simple tics proceed complex 
tics and motor tics usually start before vocal tics.1 In almost 
70%  of  cases,  peak  tic  severity  is  experienced  in  the  early 
adolescence between 10 and 12 years of age.11–13 Thereafter, 
tics spontaneously improve in the vast majority of patients, 
but may persist into adulthood.12–14

The assessment of tics is often challenging due to their 
waxing and waning nature, suppressibility of tics, as well as 
great variability regarding their impact on quality of life. It is 
therefore  advisable  to  take  all  available  information  into 
consideration,  including  interview,  clinical  examination, 
and  reports  by  families  and  caregivers  and  –  if  possible 
and in more complex cases - home-made video recordings. 
Because  of  these  well-known  difficulties  in  assessing  tics, 
during  the  last  years  several  different  measurements  have 
been  suggested  for 
tic  assessment.  The  authors  of 
a  systematic  review  published  in  2017  classified  available 
tic  rating  scales  as  “recommended”,  “suggested”,  and 
“listed”15  and  recommended  the  following  rating  scales: 
the  Yale  Global  Tic  Severity  Scale  (YGTSS),16 
the 
Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI),17 
the Tourette’s Disorder Scale (TDS),18  the Shapiro Tourette 
syndrome  Severity  Scale  (STSS),19  and  the  Premonitory 
Urges  for  Tics  Scale  (PUTS).20  Furthermore,  six  scales 
were  rated  as  “suggested”  and  another  five  as  “listed”  (for 
more  details  refer  to  Martino  et  al15).  Anyhow,  the  gold

standard  to  measure  tic  severity  is  the  YGTSS.  However, 
there is  general agreement  to use  only the  “total tic  score” 
(TTS,  range,  0–50)  of  the  YGTSS  to  assess  tics.  To  over-
come – at least in part – limitations of the YGTSS, in 2018, 
McGuire et al21 introduced a revised version of the YGTSS 
(YGTSS-R). Although only recently we were able to show 
that further improvements are needed – particularly regard-
ing the complexity of the measurement22  – in future studies 
the YGTSS-R (instead of the YGTSS) should be used. Most 
widely used scales helpful in the diagnosis and assessment 
of tics are summarized in Table 1.

Characteristics of Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorder in Patients with Tourette 
Syndrome
In TS, psychiatric comorbidities are the rule rather than the 
exception and occur in almost 80% of patients.1,23,24 OCB/ 
OCD  is  –  beside  ADHD  –  the  most  common  comorbid 
psychiatric  comorbidity,  particularly  in  adults  with  TS. 
While  only  a  minority  of  patients  with  TS  suffer  from 
full blown OCD according to DSM (around 30%, however 
numbers range from 2% to 66% depending on the sample 
investigated1,4,5,25),  a  large  number  of  patients  (about 
60–70%1,26) exhibit mild to moderate OCB.5

Importantly, several lines of evidence suggest that tics and 
OCD share a  common pathophysiology.5,27  Both conditions 
have  familial  nature,  but  while  OCB/OCD  is  found  more 
frequently in females,28 tics are far more common (3–4:1) in 
males.29 Interestingly, genetic studies indicate that OCB/OCD 
and  TS  share  a  common  genetical  background.30–32  Como 
et al33 even suggested that OCB is an alternative expression of 
the  TS  phenotype,  more  commonly  affecting  female  gene 
carriers. This presumed overlap is also reflected in the clinical 
manifestation making differentiation between tics and OCD- 
derived symptoms sometimes very challenging.

When comparing pure OCB/OCD in the absence of tics 
with comorbid OCB/OCD in the context of TS, a number 
of differences emerge. Leckman et al34  conducted a cross- 
sectional study aimed to investigate tic-related and non-tic 
-related  OCD.  They  investigated  177  patients  with  OCD, 
of whom 56 had tic-related OCD. Patients with tic-related 
OCD  more  often  suffered  from  obsessions  with  aggres-
sive, religious, and sexual thoughts as well as compulsions 
with checking, counting, ordering, touching, and hoarding 
behaviors  compared  to  those  with  pure  OCD  (without 
tics). Surprisingly, these two groups did not differ regard-
ing the presence of “just right” phenomena. George et al35 
prospectively assessed OCD in 10 patients with pure OCD

compared to 15 patients with TS and comorbid OCD using 
the  Yale–Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (Y-BOCS), 
the  Leyton  Obsessional  Inventory  (LOI)  as  well  as 
a  questionnaire  targeting  to  differentiate  between  the  two 
disorders.  They  found  that  patients  with  TS  plus  OCD 
demonstrated  significantly  more  violent,  sexual  and  sym-
metrical obsessions and more touching, counting, and self- 
injurious compulsions. On the contrary, patients with pure 
OCD suffered more often from obsessive thoughts related 
to dirt and germs, and - as a consequence of these - more 
cleaning  compulsions.  Interestingly,  patients  with  TS- 
related  OCD  felt  that  their  compulsions  arouse  sponta-
neously, while patients with pure OCD reported that their 
compulsions are preceded by cognitions.

Alsbrook  et  al36  conducted  a  factor  analysis  of  “tic 
symptoms” in 85 patients with TS. Four significant clinical 
clusters  were  identified:  (1)  aggressive  phenomena  (eg, 
kicking, temper fits, argumentativeness), (2) purely motor 
and phonic tic symptoms, (3) compulsive phenomena (eg, 
touching  of  others  or  objects,  repetitive  speech,  throat 
clearing), and (4) tapping and absence of grunting. Eapen 
et al37  reported about clinical features and associated psy-
chopathology in 91 patients with TS and found that OCB 
was positively correlated with the presence of ADHD and 
SIB.  With  regard  to  psychopathology  in  adults,  principal 
component factor analysis yielded two factors, “obsession-
ality” and “anxiety/depression”, which accounted for 72% 
of  the  variance.  Mathews  et  al38  presented  results  of  the 
study  examining  clinical  and  genetic  data  of  133  indivi-
duals  with  TS  in  the  intent  to  identify  clinical/genetic 
clusters. Using cluster analysis, they identified two distinct 
groups,  those  with  predominantly  simple  tics  (cluster  1) 
and 
tics  (cluster  2). 
Membership  in  cluster  2  was  correlated  with  increased 
tic severity, global impairment, medication treatment, and 
presence of comorbid OCB and with family history of tics, 
lower verbal IQ, earlier age of onset, and comorbid OCD 
and  ADHD  in  the  sample  of  Ashkenazi  Jews.  Another 
study  trying  to  tackle  the  topic  of  diverse  clinical  pheno-
types  in  TS  was  published  by  Robertson  and  Cavanna39 
who  carried  out  a  principal  component  factor  analytic 
study  in  69 patients with  TS. The authors identified three 
significant  factors,  accounting  for  approximately  42%  of 
the  symptomatic  variance:  Factor  1:  predominantly  “pure 
tics”,  Factor  2:  predominantly  “ADHD  and  aggressive 
behaviors”,  and  Factor  3:  predominantly  “depression- 
anxiety-OCB  and  SIB”.  Different  kinds  of  tics  occurred 
in  all  three  factors.  Only  frowning/raising  eyebrows  and 

those  with  multiple  complex 

sniffing/smelling  loaded  significantly  on  Factors  1  and  3. 
In  2010,  the  same  group  conducted  a  follow-up  study  in 
a  larger  sample  of  639  patients  with  TS.40  Using 
a  principal  component  factor  analysis,  again  three  factors 
were  identified:  (1)  complex  motor  tics  and  echo- 
paliphenomena;  (2)  ADHD  plus  aggressive  behaviors; 
and  (3)  complex  vocal  tics  and  coprophenomena.  OCB 
was  significantly  associated  with  the  first  two  factors. 
The three factors accounted for 48.5% of the total sympto-
matic  variance.  Similarly,  Huisman  van  Dijk41  reported 
about a relationship between tics, OCB, ADHD and autism 
symptoms.  Their  analysis  revealed  a  five-factor  structure 
including  (1)  tic/aggression/symmetry,  (2)  OCB/compul-
sive  tics  especially  related  to  numbers  and  patterns,  (3) 
ADHD symptoms, (4) autism symptoms; and (5) hoarding/ 
inattention symptoms.

Terminology Used to Describe 
Phenomena Related to 
Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviors in 
Tourette Syndrome
Various terminologies are used to describe OCB/OCD related 
phenomena  in  TS  including  OCB,  obsessive-compulsive 
symptoms  (OCS),  OCD,  “just  right”  phenomena,  “not  just 
right  experiences”  (NJRE),  repetitive  behaviors,  compulsive 
tics,  and  cognitive  tics.  It  is  important  to  realize  that  these 
symptoms belong to the same spectrum, largely overlap and in 
part are used synonymously. While OCD is clearly defined – 
according  to  DSM-5  as  outlined  above,  for  all  other  term  – 
although often used - clear and generally accepted definitions 
are missing. In general, a patient is diagnosed with OCB, if 
obsessions and/or compulsions are only of mild severity and 
do not fulfil diagnostic criteria for OCD.

In  contrast,  NJRE  specifically  involve  sensations  of 
“incompleteness” rather than the need to “avoid harm” as 
typical seen in other OCD symptoms. “Just right” experi-
ences  are  related  to  discomfort  or  tension  rather  than 
anxiety.42 Interestingly, they have been reported to proceed 
or  accompany  both  tics  and  compulsions.7  Furthermore, 
Leckman  et  al8  suggested  that  premonitory  urges  (PUs)43 
that typical proceed tics in TS show similarities with “just 
right” sensations. Most typically, PUs are described as an 
itch, discomfort  or  pressure.  It  is  believed  that PUs  make 
patients execute tics in response to urges. Similarly, Coles 
et al44  described experiences of “not just-right” in patients 
with pure OCD defined as a feeling of “incompleteness”, if 
a  specific  mental  or  physical  act  is  somehow  performed

incorrectly. Accordingly, da Silva Prado et al42  stated that 
we  are  still  lacking  a  consensus  regarding  these  different 
terminologies.  Instead  of  using  the  term,  PU,  “just-right” 
and  NJRE,  alternatively  the  umbrella  term  “sensory  phe-
nomena” has been proposed.45

tension”.46  They  are  believed 

Compared  to  OCB/OCD,  the  term  “repetitive  beha-
viors” describes a far wider spectrum of symptoms includ-
ing  both  impulsions,  compulsions,  stereotypies  and  even 
tics.  It  is  used  in  the  context  of  a  variety  of  different 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disor-
der (ASD), TS,  OCB/OCD, schizophrenia, dementia,  epi-
lepsy,  and  eating  disorders.  In  contrast, 
terms 
“compulsive  tics”  and  “cognitive  tics”  are  used  only  in 
context of TS and other tic disorders. Compulsive tics are 
defined  as  “repetitive  movements  performed  according  to 
rules  (ie,  ritualistic)  in  response  to  an  obsession  or  to 
reduce 
represent 
a  specific  type  of  complex  tics  that  share  characteristics 
of both tics and compulsions. In contrast, cognitive tics are 
defined  as  mental  acts  that  bear  common  characteristics 
with tics and obsessions.47  In clinical practice, both terms 
compulsive  and  cognitive  tics  are  used  only  rarely,  pre-
sumably  because  of  the  not  clearly  defined  underlying 
concepts. Subsequently, we discuss each of these phenom-
ena  in  more  detail.  Finally,  also  SIB  in  TS  should  be 
differentiated  as  a  part  of  the  spectrum  on  the  verge 
between  tics  and  OCB/OCD  as  previous  studies  have 
demonstrated  that  autoaggression  in  TS  is  mainly  asso-
ciated with tics or OCD spectrum.48,49

“Just Right” Phenomena: NJRE
The term “just right” has been introduced for the first time 
in the context of OCD by Janet in 1903 in his work “Les 
Obsessions  et  La  Psychasthe“  describing  the  following 
phenomenon: “The patients feel that actions they perform 
are incompletely achieved, or that they do not produce the 
sought  for  satisfaction”.50  In  1994,  Leckman  et  al8  were 
the first, who used the term of “just right” sensations in the 
context  of  TS.  Today,  it  is  generally  accepted  that  “just 
right”  phenomena  represent  the  most  common  OCB  in 
patients with TS. They are defined as the execution of an 
action  in  a  certain  way  in  order  to  achieve  internal 
relief.8,51  In 2013, Neal and Cavanna51  alternatively intro-
duced  the  term  “not  just  right  experience”  (NJRE)  in  TS 
research after this term has been used since 1992 in studies 
related to OCD.52  Although semantically more accurately 
compared  to  the  term  “just  right”,  the  synonym  NJRE  is 
less commonly used in TS research.

Leckman  et  al8  carried  out  a  cross-sectional  study  in 
134 subjects aged 9 to 71 to evaluate “just right” phenom-
ena  in  patients  with  tic  disorders.  While  81%  of  patients 
with TS and comorbid OCD reported on a need to perform 
compulsions until a feeling of “just right” is achieved, only 
56%  of  those  with  TS  and  comorbid  OCB  experienced 
such  as  feeling.  Most  of  the  patients  described  these  sen-
sations  as  a  visual  or  tactile  feature  of  the  compulsion. 
Because  of  this  overlap,  the  authors  speculated  that  brain 
regions  involved  in  sensorimotor  processing  are  also 
involved in the pathophysiology of tics. In a large single- 
center  study  including  1032  patients  with  tic  disorders, 
10%  and  62%  were  diagnosed  with  OCD  and  OCB, 
respectively  (based  on  a  structured  clinical  interview) 
with  NJREs  being  the  most  common  symptom  followed 
by checking, ordering, washing, and counting.1

Neal  and  Cavanna51  for  the  first  time  used  the  “Not 
Just  Right  Experiences  Questionnaire-Revised”  (NJRE- 
QR) to systematically investigate NJRE in  71 adults with 
TS. This scale was originally introduced by Coles et al53 to 
assess NJREs in patients with OCD. They found that 80% 
of  patients  with  TS  report  at  least  one  NJRE.  However, 
patients  with  comorbid  OCB/OCD  experienced  signifi-
cantly more NJREs compared to those without. The stron-
gest  correlation  was found between  NJRE-QR  scores and 
self-report  measures  of  compulsivity.  The  authors’  final 
conclusion  was  that  NJREs  are  presumably  more  related 
to OCD than to tics. This hypothesis is in line with results 
of studies in  pure OCD reporting an incidence of 95% of 
NJREs in OCD patients.44,54,55

Taken  together,  the  clinical  spectrum  of  OCB  in 
patients with TS is broad. In any case, it is vital to actively 
inquire  about  OCB-related  phenomena  in  order  not  to 
overlook  these  symptoms,  particularly,  because  patients 
often do not report about it spontaneously. This procedure 
is  of  clinical  importance,  since  “full  blown”  OCD  often 
impairs patients’ quality of life to a greater extent than the 
tics. Compared to pure OCD, patients with TS and comor-
bid  OCB/OCD  more  frequently  suffer  from  “just  right” 
phenomena,  which  is  the  most  typical  OCB  in  TS.  More 
precisely, we suggest to use the term NJRE.

Repetitive Behaviors Related to Tourette Syndrome
Cath  et  al56  investigated  the  relationship  between  types 
and  severity  of  repetitive  behaviors  in  patients  with  TS 
plus OCD and pure OCD. They enrolled 14 subjects with 
TS  and  comorbid  OCD,  18  with  “TS  only”  (without 
comorbidities),  21  with  pure  OCD,  and  29  healthy

than 

controls.  Across  the  study  groups,  obsessions  were  more 
severe 
impulsive  behaviors  and  compulsions. 
Compared  to  pure  OCD,  patients  with  TS  and  comorbid 
OCD reported more “Tourette-related” impulsions such as 
mental play, echophenomena, impulsive, and SIB, but less 
obsessions  and  particular  types  of  compulsions  including 
washing. The authors concluded that patients with TS and 
comorbid  OCD  are  phenomenologically  more  similar  to 
TS than to pure OCD. Banaschewski et al57  analyzed data 
of a worldwide database on TS including 4833 individuals. 
OCB co-occurring with TS was associated with impulsive 
and  aggressive  behavior  as  well  as  with  depression  and 
anxiety.  Worbe  et  al58  studied  166  patients  with  TS  aged 
15–68 to investigate whether repetitive behaviors represent 
a  manifestation  of  OCD  or  belong  to  the  tic  spectrum.  In 
their  cohort,  they  found  repetitive  behaviors  in  65%  of 
patients. Based on clinical phenomenology, they identified 
three  types  of  repetitive  behaviors:  a  “tic-like”  type  (in 
24% of patients) presenting with symptoms such as touch-
ing, counting, “just  right”, and symmetry; an “OCD-like” 
type  (in  20%  of  patients),  manifesting  with  repetitive 
behaviors  such  as  washing  and  checking  rituals;  and 
finally,  a  “mixed  group”  suffering  from  both  “tic-like” 
and  “OCD-like”  types  of  repetitive  behaviors  (in  13%  of 
patients).  Only  6%  of  patients  could  not  be  classified  in 
any  of  these  groups.  The  authors  concluded  that  in  TS, 
different  types  of  repetitive  behaviors  can  be  distin-
guished: “tic-like” behaviors, which seem to be an integral 
part  of  TS  and  “OCD-like”  behaviors  correlating  with 
a higher score of complex tics and more frequent treatment 
with  antipsychotics  and  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhi-
bitors  (SSRIs)  as  well  as  worse  socio-professional 
functioning.

Eddy and Cavanna59  reviewed the literature in order to 
explore  the  nature  of  TS  and  OCD  in  more  detail.  They 
suggest  that  both  disorders  represent  a  continuum  with 
contamination  worries  being  more  indicative  for  “full- 
blown”  OCD,  while  repetitive  behaviors  are  more  linked 
to  echophenomena,  ordering,  symmetry,  and  counting  as 
typically  seen  in  TS.  Based  on  their  research  it  is  less 
clear,  whether  there  is  a  difference  between  OCD-  and 
TS-  specific  checking  behaviours.  They  also  postulate 
that  patients  with  OCD  are  mainly  focused  on  avoiding 
harm  as  much  as  possible,  while  in  patients  with  TS 
repetitive behaviors such as self-defeat and SIB (eg, touch-
ing  very  hot  or  sharp  objects)  or  socially  dangerous  acts 
(ie,  non-obscene  socially  inappropriate  symptoms,  NOSI) 
are more characteristic.

All  in  all,  distinction  between  “tic-like”  and  “OCD- 
like”  repetitive  behaviors  can  be  very  challenging. 
However,  “tic-like”  repetitive  behaviors  are  usually  pre-
ceded by premonitory urges, are ego-syntonic, and are not 
accompanied  by  intrusive  thoughts,  while  “OCD-like” 
repetitive  behaviors  are  typically  anxiety-driven,  are 
accompanied by obsessions, and are ego-dystonic.

Compulsive Tics
According  to  Palumbo  and  Kurlan,46  compulsive  tics 
represent  repetitive  behaviors  in  patients  with  TS  that 
comprise  features  of  both  compulsions  and  complex  tics 
making  it  impossible  to  classify  the  particular  symptom 
either as a tic or as a compulsion. Alternatively to the term 
compulsive  tics,  they  suggested  the  term  “compultics”. 
Thus, compulsive tics are defined as repetitive movements 
performed according to rules, in response to an obsession, 
or to reduce tension, for example touching a door a certain 
number of times. The author highlight that compulsive tics 
most typically have to be performed according to specific 
rules, ritualistic behaviors, in a certain number of times, in 
a  certain  order  or  at  a  certain  time  of  day  (eg,  bedtime 
rituals).

To distinguish tics from compulsions, a thorough clin-
ical  interview  may  be  helpful:  While  compulsions  aim  at 
neutralizing  an  anxiety-driven  worry,  compulsive  tics  are 
not  executed  with  the  aim  of  anxiety  reduction.  Instead, 
they  help  to  neutralize  the  feeling  of  sensory  discomfort 
until a “just right” feeling  is achieved or  a “not just  right 
feeling”  is  diminished.  Whilst  tics  usually  start  at  age  of 
5–7  and  tend  to  exacerbate  in  the  adolescence  and 
decrease  during  adulthood,  OCD  initiates  at  the  age  of 
10–12  and  patients  often  experience  symptom  deteriora-
tion while getting older.60

Cognitive Tics
Some  researchers  postulate  the  existence  of  so-called 
“cognitive  tics”  or  “mental  tics”  (both  terms  are  used 
synonymously),  a  symptom  resembling  obsessions.47,61 
In 2005, O’Connor62  first suggested the presence of cog-
nitive  tics.  In  his  article,  he  defined  cognitive  tics  as 
thoughts,  phrases,  urges,  songs,  words,  and  scenes  that 
intrude  into  consciousness,  are  difficult  to  remove,  and 
consecutively cause irritation to the person. Until today, it 
is  a  matter  of  discussion,  whether  this  is  a  meaningful 
concept  as  by  definition  tics  are  classified  as  motor  or 
vocal  phenomena.  However,  obsessions  are  defined  as 
coherent  doubts  or  images  about  aversive  events  or

Alternatively,  cognitive  tics  could  be  interpreted  as 
a  part  of  a  much  broader  spectrum  of  intrusive  thoughts 
defined  as  thoughts,  images  or  impulses  that  (1)  interrupt 
an ongoing activity, (2) are of internal attribution, and (3) 
are difficult to control.63 Based on this concept, the authors 
suggest  that  intrusive  thought  and  cognitive  tics  share 
a number of common characteristics: (1) they are generally 
conceptualized  as  unwanted,  (2)  are  hardly  ever  consid-
ered  a  one-time  occurrence,  but  rather  refer  to  thoughts, 
images,  or  impulses  that  have  the  tendency  to  repeat 
themselves,  and  (3)  they  have  intrusive  nature,  which 
means that they interrupt regular activity.

The construct of cognitive tics is another example that 
illustrates the overlap of tics and obsessions and the diffi-
culties  to  differentiate  one  from  the  other.  In  patients

Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB)
Another  phenomenon  on  the  frontier  between  tics  and 
compulsions  is  SIB  found  in  about  40%  of  patients  with 
TS.1,48,49,64,65  SIB  is  defined  as  auto-aggressive  behavior 
directed  against  oneself.  It  is  carried  out  although  its 
senselessness  and  the  risk  of  injury  are  recognized.  SIB 
either consists merely of an urge to injure oneself against 
one’s  will  or  are  accompanied  by  actual  damage  to  one’s 
own  body  against  one’s  will.  Thus,  injuries  caused  by 
auto-aggressive  actions  are  not  accidental  and  SIB  is  not 
accompanied  by  suicidal  intent.  Until  today,  it  is  unclear 
whether  SIB  is  more  related  to  tics  or  to  OCD  or  repre-
sents an independent phenomenon. From previous studies 
it  is  suggested  that  SIB  is  associated  with  both  complex 
motor  tics  and  coprophenomena,  but  also  different  psy-
chiatric comorbidities.1,48,49  In a recent study, our group66 
developed a specific diagnostic instrument for rating com-
plexity  and  severity  of  SIB  in  patients  with  TS,  the  Self- 
injurious  Behaviour  Scale  (SIBS).  In  a  large  sample,  103 
of  123  adult  patients  (84%)  reported  SIB.  Remarkably, 
SIBS  scores  correlated  with  tic  severity  as  assessed  by 
the  Adult  Tic  Questionnaire  (ATQ),  but  not  with  the

severity  of  OCD  or  any  other  psychiatric  comorbidity 
(unpublished  data).  From  these  results  therefore it  is  sug-
gested that SIB represents a specific type of tic rather than 
an OCD-related phenomenon.

SIB must be differentiated from severe and/or complex 
motor tics that cause physical impairment (eg, because of 
the  intensity  or  high  frequency  of  the  tics).  In  addition, 
harm caused by OCD with excessive washing and groom-
ing must be differentiated. Finally, also impulsive behavior 
related  to  ADHD  and  rage  attacks  may  result  in  physical 
injury that must be differentiated from SIB.48

Scales Used for the Diagnosis and Assessment of 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
According  to  ESSTS  guidelines,9  it  is  recommended  to 
actively  inquire  about  psychiatric  comorbidities  in  every 
patient  with  TS  as  type  and  severity  of  clinical  symptoms 
determine the therapeutic approach. Although in any case the 
diagnostic  interview  should  cover  the  whole  spectrum  of 
common  comorbid  disorders,  it  should  be  oriented  differ-
ently depending on the patient’s age. While in children the 
primary focus should be on ADHD followed by ASD, oppo-
sitional defiant disorder (ODD), learning disorders, anxiety 
disorders, and rage attacks, in adults predominant comorbid-
ities are OCB/OCD and mood disorders followed by anxiety 
disorders, ADHD, rage attacks, and SIB.

For diagnosing comorbid OCB/OCD we recommend to 
use  DSM-5  criteria,  but  also  structured  interviews  can  be 
used,  particularly,  the  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric 
Interview,67  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM 
Disorders  (SCID)68 
the  Mini-International 
in  adults, 
Neuropsychiatric  Interview  for  Children  and  Adolescents 
(MINI  KID),69  and  the  Schedule  for  Affective  Disorders 
and  Schizophrenia  for  School  Aged  Children-Present  and 
Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL)70  for children, respectively. 
When it comes to further evaluation of OCB/OCD, the best 
investigated, most widely used, and, therefore, recommended 
scale  is  the  Y-BOCS71  and  equivalently,  for  children,  the 
Children’s  Yale–Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (CY- 
BOCS).72  Y-BOCS  and  CY-BOCS  are  10-item,  clinician- 
administered  scales  created  to  rate  symptom  severity,  but 
not to establish a diagnosis. They contain symptom check-
lists and provide five rating dimensions for both obsessions 
and compulsions: time spent or occupied, interference with 
functioning  or  relationships,  degree  of  distress,  resistance, 
and control (ie, success in resistance). Each item is rated from 
0, meaning “no symptoms”, to 4, “extreme symptoms”. As 
the  (C)Y-BOCS  is  considered  the  gold  standard  for  the 

assessment  of  OCB/OCD,  we  strongly  encourage  to  use 
this  scale  in  clinical  practice.  However,  a  number  of  other 
validated  and  well-established  rating  scales  is  available 
including the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI)73  and 
the  OCI-Child  Version,74  the  LOI75  and  the  LOI  –  Child 
Version  Survey,76 
the  Children’s  Obsessional 
Compulsive  Inventory  (CHOCI).77  Scales  helpful  in  the 
diagnosis and assessment of OCB/OCD in patients with TS 
are summarized in Table 3.

and 

While  in  the  context  of  clinical  studies,  use  of  well- 
established  standardized  assessments  is  of  utmost  impor-
tance, in daily clinical routine practice, a structured interview 
represents  the  gold  standard  to  capture  the  whole  clinical 
symptom spectrum. Up to now, none of the available mea-
surements can be used to unequivocally classify phenomena 
on  the  borderline  between  tics  and  OCB/OCD  as  one  of 
these. Unfortunately, “tic-like” as well as “OCD-like” repe-
titive behaviors are included in rating scales for both tics and 
OCB/OCD  including  the  gold  standard  measurements.  For 
example,  SIB  is  mentioned  in  the  symptom  lists  of  both 
YGTSS and Y-BOCS. In other words, up to now differentia-
tions  between  one  and  the  other  solely  relies  on  clinical 
judgement. This in turn underlines the importance of centers 
of excellence for TS with extensive clinical experience. For 
all clinicians treating patients with TS, it is of importance to 
know  that  tics  and  OCB/OCD  often  co-occur.  Not  quite 
rarely,  patients  themselves  may  be  able  to  assist  disentan-
gling “tic-like” from “OCD-like” repetitive behaviors, when 
comparing the phenomenon at issue to unequivocal tics (such 
as eye blinking) or unequivocal OCB/OCD (such as check-
ing).  Finally,  treatment-specific  response  to  either  SSRI  or 
antipsychotics may help to make the final diagnosis.

Treatment of Tics and Comorbid 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in 
Patients with Tourette Syndrome
It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  comorbidities  -  and  in 
particular comorbid OCD - often cause greater impairment in 
patients’ quality of life than tics.78–81 In general, treatment of 
OCB/OCD in patients with coexisting tics/TS is based on the 
same premises as the treatment of patients with (pure) OCD 
without tics. Unfortunately, until today there is no treatment 
known  that  improves  both  tics  and  OCB/OCD.  Regarding 
behavioral  therapy  (BT),  for  the  treatment  of  OCB/OCD, 
Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is preferred,82,83 
while in the therapy of tics Cognitive Behavioral Intervention 
for  Tics  (CBIT)  is  recommended.84,85  Alternatively,  for

OCB/OCD pharmacotherapy with SSRI can be initiated,86–89 
while first choice treatment for tics are antipsychotics such as 
aripiprazole.  Since  ERP  and  pharmacotherapy  with  SSRI 
have similar efficacy on OCD,90 BT should be recommended 
as  first-line  treatment.  If  monotherapy  with  either  ERP  or 
pharmacotherapy is insufficient, combined treatment should 
be offered. If OCB/OCD responds partially to pharmacother-
apy with SSRI, alternatively, augmentation with antipsycho-
tics such as aripiprazole can be taken into consideration.88,91 
If all these interventions fail to significantly improve OCD, 
gradual dose up-titration of the SSRI should be considered 
until intolerable adverse events occur. In refractory patients

Conclusions
All  in  all,  OCB  and  OCD  are  one  of  the  most  frequent 
comorbid  psychiatric  symptoms  co-occurring  in  patients 
with  primary  tic  disorders  including  TS.  Since  patients 
often do not spontaneously report on these symptoms – either 
because they are unaware of the relationship to TS or they are 
ashamed of their behaviors and thoughts – it is recommended 
to actively ask all patients about obsessions and compulsions

not  only  at  first  consultation,  but  also  at  follow-up  visits. 
Depending  on  the  clinical  context  –  as  well  as  in  clinical 
studies – it may be helpful to assess severity of OCB/OCD 
using  the  (C)Y-BOCS.  By  far  the  most  frequent  and  most 
typical obsessions in patients with TS are “just right” phe-
nomena,  which  more  accurately  should  be  named  NJER, 
followed  by  compulsions  with  violent  and  sexual  thoughts 
as well as symmetrical obsessions, touching, and counting. 
Differential  diagnosis  of  OCB/OCD  in  TS  includes  tics, 
especially  complex  motor  tics  performed  in  the  sequence, 
SIB, and mental phenomena on the frontiers between tics and 
obsessions, called cognitive tics. In patients with impairing 
OCB/OCD  treatment  with  either  ERP  or  SSRI  should  be 
offered depending on the preference of the patient.
