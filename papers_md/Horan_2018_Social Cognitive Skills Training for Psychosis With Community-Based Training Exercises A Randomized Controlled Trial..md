Impairments  in  social  cognition  are  key  determinants  of 
poor  functioning  in  psychosis  and  an  important  new  tar-
get for treatment development. Initial studies support the 
feasibility and efficacy of training interventions for social 
cognition,  but  have  been  small  and  have  had  substantial 
methodological limitations. This report describes the larg-
est rigorously controlled study of a social cognitive treat-
ment to date. We evaluated the efficacy of a refined version 
of the 24-session Social Cognitive Skills Training (SCST) 
program,  and  whether  adding  in  vivo  training  sessions  in 
community settings would enhance generalization to func-
tional improvements. One hundred thirty-nine outpatients 
with  psychotic  disorders  were  randomly  assigned  to  one 
of 3 time- and format-matched conditions: (1) SCST plus 
in  vivo  community-based  training,  (2)  SCST  plus  clinic-
based  training,  or  (3)  Illness  management  control  condi-
tion.  SCST  targeted  the  domains  of  emotion  processing, 
social perception, attributional bias, empathy, and mental-
izing. Assessments of social cognition, nonsocial cognition, 
symptoms,  and  functioning  were  completed  at  baseline, 
mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. On 
the primary social cognitive outcome measures, there was 
significant,  durable  SCST-related  improvement  in  facial 
emotion identification. There was also a significant SCST 
benefit  for  emotional  intelligence  and  an  in  vivo  training 
effect  for  empathy,  though  these  improvements  were  not 
durable.  Further,  there  were  no  overall  or  in  vivo-related 
changes  in  functioning.  This  study  bolsters  and  extends 
support for the efficacy of SCST in a relatively large and 
rigorously controlled trial, although our effort to enhance 
generalization to functional improvements through in vivo 
community-based training was not successful.

Introduction

Recovery-oriented  treatments  for  schizophrenia  and 
related psychotic disorders have increasingly focused on 
social cognition. Social cognition refers to mental opera-
tions that underlie social interactions, including perceiv-
ing, interpreting, managing, and generating responses to 
socially relevant stimuli.1 People with psychotic disorders 
show substantial impairments across the 4 social cogni-
tive  domains  of  emotion  processing  (particularly  facial 
affect  perception),  social  cue  perception,  attributional 
style,  and  mentalizing.2  More  recent  evidence  indicates 
that these impairments extend to a fifth domain of empa-
thy,3 which refers to the ability to share, understand, and 
respond  to  emotions  of  others.  In  relation  to  nonsocial 
neurocognitive deficits, social cognitive impairments are 
more  strongly  related  to  community  functioning  and 
appear  to  be  more  proximal  (ie,  act  as  a  mediator)  to 
functioning.4,5  These  characteristics  make  social  cogni-
tion a particularly attractive treatment target.

Several  research  groups  have  developed  interventions 
specifically  designed  to  improve  multiple  domains  of 
social  cognition.  Kurtz  et  al6  reviewed  16  initial  studies 
of  such  treatments  and  reported  encouraging  results. 
Most studies assessed affect perception and mentalizing, 
with large and medium treatment-related improvements, 
respectively.  This  review  reinforced  the  importance  of 
developing interventions for social cognition for psycho-
sis,  but  it  also  demonstrated  considerable  variability  in 
the methods and quality of the included studies. In par-
ticular, studies have been small (typically less than 20 per 
condition),  several  did  not  include  randomized  assign-
ment and/or an active control comparison condition, few 
have examined durability of treatment benefits, and gen-
eralization to functioning was often not considered (see7 
for further discussion of limitations).

a  comprehensive  social  cognitive  intervention  to  date. 
Specifically, we evaluated the efficacy of a refined version 
of the Social Cognitive Skills Training (SCST) program 
we  have  developed,8–11  which  includes  separate  modules 
targeting the 5 social cognitive domains described above. 
Primary outcome measures were selected to assess impact 
on each of these domains. Based on prior trials of SCST,8–11  
we expected the strongest effects on emotion processing 
(particularly  facial  affect  perception)  but  also  evaluated 
whether benefits of the revised SCST program extended 
to  the  other  domains.  Secondary  outcomes  included 
neurocognition,  symptoms,  and  functioning.  Durability 
was  assessed  at  3-months  posttreatment.  In  addition, 
we  addressed  the  issue  of  generalizability  by  evaluating 
whether adding an in vivo training component to SCST 
led to additional improvements in functioning.

Methods

Subjects

One  hundred  thirty-nine  participants  were  recruited 
from  outpatient  clinics  at  the  VA  Greater  Los  Angeles 
Healthcare  Center  and  local  community  mental  health 
facilities.  All  patients  met  DSM-IV  criteria  for  schizo-
phrenia  (n  =  108),  schizoaffective  disorder  (n  =  15),  or 
psychosis NOS (n = 16) (not secondary to substance use 
disorder)  as  determined  by  medical  records  and  con-
sultation  with  treating  psychiatrists.  Subjects  were  clin-
ically  stable  (no  psychiatric  hospitalizations  in  the  past 
2 mo, same antipsychotic medication for the past 6 wk). 
Exclusion criteria were evidence of current or past neu-
rological  disorder  (eg,  epilepsy),  IQ  <  70,  or  substance 
use  disorder  within  the  past  month.  Medication  types 
and dosages were not controlled and were left to the dis-
cretion of subjects’ treating physicians.

Design

The 139 participants were recruited in groups of 6 to 8 
and these groups were assigned to one of 3 twelve-week 
group-based interventions using a randomized permuted 
block design (see supplementary material for Consort dia-
gram): “SCST-in vivo (n = 41); “SCST-Clinic” (n = 49); 
“Control” (n = 49). The groups did not differ in terms of 
diagnoses (X2 (4,139) = 1.81, P = .77). During the first 6 
weeks all participants completed 2 one-hour sessions/wk 
and during the second 6 weeks all participants completed 
3  one-hour  sessions/wk.  The  curricula  and  location  for 
the sessions for the 3 intervention groups were as follows: 
(1)  SCST-in  vivo  =  24  SCST  sessions  in  the  clinic  plus 
6 sessions (1/wk during the second 6 wk) of training in 
the community, (2) SCST-Clinic = 24 SCST sessions plus 
6 sessions (1/wk during the second 6 wk) of practice in 
the  clinic,  (3)  Control  =  30  sessions  of  Illness  manage-
ment training in the clinic (1 extra session/wk during the 

Social Cognitive Skills Training

second  6  wk).  All  sessions  were  led  by  2  co-facilitators, 
who  were  postdoctoral  fellows  in  psychology  or  experi-
enced bachelor’s-level clinicians.

Assessments  of   primary  social  cognitive  outcome 
variables, and secondary measures of  neurocognition, 
symptoms,  and  functioning  were  conducted  at  base-
line (0 wk), mid-point (6 wk), end-point (12 wk), and 
follow-up (24 wk). Assessors were blind to treatment 
condition.  The  numbers  of   participants  who  com-
pleted assessments at each of  the 4 time points were: 
SC-in  vivo:  41,  41,  39,  38;  SC-Clinic:  47,  47,  46,  41; 
Control: 47, 45, 45, 44. Written informed consent was 
obtained  from  all  study  participants.  Participants  re-
ceived  compensation  after  each  session  and  assess-
ment ($12/h).

Interventions

The intervention approaches (except for the in vivo com-
ponent) have been presented elsewhere8–11 and are briefly 
described  here  (see  supplementary  material  for  further 
detail and fidelity monitoring procedures).

SCST  Program.  The  training  approach  incorporates 
several skill-building strategies that are widely used in 
psychiatric rehabilitation including: (1) breaking down 
complex  social  cognitive  processes  into  their  compo-
nent  skills,  (2)  initially  teaching/training  skills  at  the 
most fundamental level and gradually increasing com-
plexity  of   skill  acquisition,  and  (3)  automating  these 
skills  through  repetition  and  practice.  All  sessions  are 
accompanied  by  slide  presentations  and  structured  to 
include  a  brief   review  of   previously  covered  material, 
didactic  presentation  of   new  material,  and  interactive 
practice  and  training  exercises.  A  partly  new  and  ex-
panded set of  training stimuli were employed, including 
photos,  audio  clips,  written  vignettes,  and  a  set  of 
audio-visual training materials that we developed using 
professional  actors.  New  interactive  training  activities 
and games were also included.

The  program  includes  5  modules:  (1)  Emotion  proc-
essing: defining basic emotions, identifying them on the 
face, and identifying social situations/contexts in which 
they  are  commonly  experienced;  (2)  Social  perception: 
identifying  vocal  and  bodily  expressions  of   emotion, 
nonverbal  gestures,  and  social  norms;  (3)  How  emo-
tions color our social interpretations: this module draws 
heavily on the attributional bias curriculum from Penn 
et al12 and focuses on distinguishing between useful sus-
piciousness  vs  harmful  suspiciousness,  distinguishing 
among facts, guesses, and feelings, and avoiding “jump-
ing to conclusions”; (4) Understanding others’ emotions: 
this  new  module  focuses  on  emotional  empathy  and 
perspective  taking,  including  understanding  how  oth-
ers are feeling and using this understanding to commu-
nicate  more  effectively;  and  (5)  Understanding  others’ 

1255

intentions:  the  final  module  integrates  all  of   the  social 
cues covered in the first 4 modules to help participants 
make  better  inferences  about  others’  beliefs.  Training 
focuses on distinguishing among sincerity, sarcasm, and 
lying to be kind.

SCST in vivo.   During the second half  of  the SCST 
program, participants in this condition completed an 
additional 1 h/wk of  training activities in community 
settings.  We  chose  to  initiate  the  community-based 
work  during  session  7  because  the  in  vivo  sessions 
build on skills gained in the SCST training, and par-
ticipants  had  covered  half   of   the  curriculum  by  this 
point. Two sessions were held individually and 4 ses-
sions  were  held  in  a  small  group  of   3–4  participants. 
Building  on  an  established  in  vivo  amplified  social 
skills  training  manual,13  the  objective  was  to  provide 
participants  with  the  opportunity  to  practice  so-
cial  cognition  in  familiar  community  settings  with  a 
skillful  trainer  to  guide  them.  The  sessions  occurred 
in  pre-specified  locations  (eg,  coffee  shop,  cafeteria, 
mall)  and  followed  a  structured  set  of   activities  with 
corresponding worksheets.

SCST Clinic.   During the second half of SCST, partici-
pants  in  this  condition  completed  an  additional  1  h/wk  
of  activities  in  the  clinic.  These  consisted  of  the  same 
practice activities and interactive games used in the main 
SCST sessions, but the specific training stimuli differed. 
The sessions consisted of an equal amount of activities 
from each of the 5 SCST modules.

Illness  Management  Skills 
Control  Condition. 
Training exercises included selections from the UCLA 
Social  and  Independent  Living  Skills  Program14  plus 
material  on  nutrition  and  relaxation.  We  excluded 
role-play and other exercises that directly target social 
skill building due to concerns that the nature of  these 
exercises  could  influence  social  cognitive  test  perfor-
mance. Patients in this condition completed a 34-item 
pre- and post-intervention knowledge quiz. Scores sig-
nificantly  improved  from  pre-  (M  =  23.8,  SD  =  5.8) 
to  posttreatment  (M  =  27.4,  SD  =  5.4)  (t[43]  =  5.97,  
P  <  .001)  suggesting  that  participants  were  engaged 
and learning.

Treatment Quality Control and Fidelity Monitoring.   The 
study  trainers  met  with  one  of  the  PIs  for  bi-weekly 
supervision. In addition, 2 sessions for each cohort were 
attended by one of the PIs to assess fidelity to the treat-
ment protocol. For each attended session, trainers were 
rated on the following 6 training components on a scale 
from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much): introducing content 
material,  participant  involvement,  use  of  educational 
materials,  use  of  corrective  feedback,  breaking  down 
exercises into simple components, and repetitive practice. 

1256

The ratings were uniformly high with means greater than 
3.56  across  all  6  training  components  for  each  of  the  3 
treatment  conditions,  indicating  good  adherence  to  the 
protocols.

Assessments

The test battery and dependent variable for each task is 
presented in table 1. Primary social cognition outcomes 
included 2 measures for emotion processing and one for 
each of the 4 other domains. The stimuli in these  tasks 
never  appeared  during  the  training  sessions.  Secondary 
outcome  measures  assessed  neurocognition,  symptoms, 
and functioning.

Tolerability Ratings

At  study  completion,  participants  provided  ratings  (1 
[not at all] to 10 [very much]) of their perceptions of how 
much  they  enjoyed  the  treatment,  how  enthusiastic  and 
knowledgeable they found the trainers, and how effective 
the training was in helping them deal with daily life and 
their symptoms.

Data Analysis

Preliminary  analyses  examined  the  3  treatment  groups 
for  baseline  differences  on  demographic  characteristics 
and attendance levels to determine whether these factors 
needed to be included as covariates, as well as checking 
for  baseline  differences  on  the  outcome  measures.  The 
primary  analyses  evaluated  treatment  effects  for  the  5 
social  cognitive  outcome  variables,  which  were  selected 
to  provide  adequate  coverage  of  the  main  domains  tar-
geted  by  SCST.  While  prior  studies  strongly  suggested 
that the SCST effect would be largest for the domain of 
emotion processing, we designed the SCST-in vivo condi-
tion with the intention of obtaining stronger and broader 
treatment  effects  for  the  other  targeted  social  cognitive 
domains. Given the novelty of the in vivo approach and 
our  interest  in  each  domain,  we  report  the  results  with 
unadjusted  P-values.  We  also  report  whether  signifi-
cant results survive correction for multiple comparisons 
across  the  5  domains  using  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  
(P < .01), although Bonferroni correction is likely overly 
conservative  because  the  social  cognitive  outcome  vari-
ables are not independent of each other. Analyses of the 
secondary outcome variables were corrected for multiple 
comparisons using a Bonferonni adjustment (P < .006). 
Effect  sizes  are  given  using  Cohen’s  ƒ2  which  indexes 
explained  variability;  values  of  0.02,  0.15,  and  0.35  are 
termed small, medium, and large, respectively.

We  first  examined  efficacy  by  evaluating  group  dif-
ferences  in  the  longitudinal  trajectories  of  the  primary 
social  cognitive  outcomes  over  the  intervention  period 
using  generalized  linear  mixed  models  (GLMMs). 
The  GLMM  provides  a  powerful  approach  to  dealing

Participants view a series of faces (not used in training) 
and select the label that matches from a list of 6 emotions 
(happy, sad, angry, afraid, disgust, surprise; the same 6 
emotions targeted in the training). Eight digitized photos 
of facial expressions for each of the 6 emotions plus 
neutral expressions were included (total of 56 images).
Consists of 141 items and 8 ability subscales, which 
assess 4 components (branches) of emotional processing 
that each includes 2 subscales: (1) Identifying Emotions, 
(2) Using Emotions (to facilitate cognition), (3) 
Understanding Emotions, and (4) Managing Emotions. 
Responses include 5-point Likert ratings with specific 
anchor points for some items and a 5-item multiple-choice 
format for others. MSCEIT total scores were derived 
using the general consensus approach based on a large 
community sample.
The 110 scenes in this videotape-based measure last 
2 seconds each and contain facial expressions, voice 
intonations, and/or bodily gestures of a Caucasian female. 
After watching each scene, participants select which of 2 
labels (eg, saying a prayer; talking to a lost child) better 
describes a situation that would generate the social cue(s).
Participants read a series of 5 vignettes describing 
ambiguous social situations and answer questions 
about the intentions of the characters and how subjects 
themselves would respond to the situation. The 
AIHQ contains Hostility and Aggression bias scores, 
which were independently scored by 2 blinded raters 
(intraclass correlation coefficient’s [ICC] for both bias 
scores were > .85), along with a composite “Blame” score 
(average of Intentionality, Anger, and Blame item ratings; 
higher scores reflect more bias).
Participants watch 9 video clips (2.0–2.5 min each) of 
people discussing positive or negative autobiographical 
events and provide continuous ratings (via button presses 
on a keyboard) of how positive or negative they believe 
the individual (“target”) is feeling throughout the clip 
using a 9-point scale from 1 (extremely negative) to 9 
(extremely positive). For each clip the correlation between 
the participant’s ratings of the targets’ emotions and the 
targets’ ratings of their own emotions is computed (in 2-s 
segments). This measure was added after the study began 
and was completed by 98/135 participants.
Participants watch a series of videotaped vignettes that 
depict people interacting and answer 4 types of questions 
about what a person in the conversation: (1) believes or 
knows, (2) means, (3) intends; and (4) feels. Part 2 (social 
inference – minimal) assesses understanding using cues 
such as tone of voice and facial expression in 15 vignettes 
that involve sincere and sarcastic exchanges. Part 3 (social 
inference – enriched) assesses the ability to use contextual 
knowledge (visual and verbal), in addition to voice and 
face cues, to derive meaning from the conversation. 
It includes 16 vignettes and in each there is an untrue 
comment presented as either sarcasm or as a lie.

A measure of ability to solve common problems in an 
interpersonal context that consists of four 3-min role play 
scenarios. One scene involves initiating a conversation 
with a casual acquaintance, 2 involve negotiation and 
compromise, and one involves standing up for one’s 
rights. The interactions were videotaped and subsequently 
scored by specially trained raters who achieved reliability 
standards (ICC > .95) with a gold-standard rater.
An interviewer-rated scale that measures 4 domains of

with missing data as it allows unbiased parameter esti-
mates  even  when  including  cases  with  incomplete  data 
as  long  as  the  data  are  missing  completely  at  random 
(MCAR15,16).  Typically,  evaluating  group  differences  in 
longitudinal  trajectories  would  include  group  (SCST-
Clinic,  SCST-in  vivo,  control)  as  the  between-subjects 
factor,  time  (0,  6,  12  wk)  as  the  within-subjects  factor, 
and  a  group  by  time  interaction,  along  with  subject 
level  random  intercepts  to  account  for  the  correlations 
induced by the repeated measurements. However, in our 
design the 2 SCST groups received the same curriculum 
over  the  first  6  weeks.  To  account  for  this  overlap,  we 
instead  parameterized  the  model  with  only  2  levels  for 
group (SCST or not) and a separate main-effect indica-
tor  for  the  “in  vivo”  component  of  the  training  which 
was active only at the week 12 time point. In this way, the 
group by time interaction evaluates whether SCST train-
ing improves performance relative to the control condi-
tion  (ie,  “SCST  Effect”)  over  the  full  treatment  period 
while  the  indicator  term  corresponds  to  the  additional 
impact of community-based practice at 12 weeks (ie, “in 
vivo Effect”) and hence measures whether the outcomes 
for  the  2  SCST  groups  diverge  over  the  second  half  of 
the intervention. A significant result for either of these 
model  components  would  indicate  a  differential  treat-
ment effect.

We  next  considered  durability  of   treatment  effects 
for  those  social  cognition  variables  that  showed  sig-
nificant  SCST  or  in  vivo  effects.  First,  durability 
analyses examined the trajectories of  change from 12 
to  24  weeks  and  used  the  standard  3-group  by  time 
modeling  structure  since  by  follow-up  the  groups 

1258

had  all  received  separate  curricula.  Significant  main 
effects  of   time  or  group  by  time  interactions  would 
indicate  overall  or  relative  lack  of   durability,  respec-
tively. Follow-up contrasts, corresponding to the aver-
age change from end-point to follow-up, were used to 
evaluate  degree  of   maintenance  for  each  treatment 
condition.  Second,  we  evaluated  the  trajectories  of 
change  between  0  and  24  weeks  using  the  same  ana-
lytic approach. These analyses indicate whether scores 
remained  significantly  improved  at  follow-up  relative 
to baseline levels.

Efficacy and durability of treatment for the secondary 
outcome measures, including the symptom, neurocogni-
tive,  and  functioning  measures,  were  assessed  using  the 
same  analytic  strategy  outlined  above  for  the  primary 
outcomes.  Finally,  tolerability  ratings  were  examined 
with 1-way ANOVAs.

Results

Preliminary Analyses

There were no significant differences between the groups 
on  demographic  characteristics  with  the  exception  of 
gender (table 2) for which there was a higher proportion 
of women in SC-Clinic compared to the other conditions. 
However,  there  were  no  baseline  sex  differences  on  any 
outcome measure, so we did not adjust for gender in sub-
sequent models. The patients were generally chronically 
ill.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  attendance 
levels  (average  of  about  24/30  sessions),  nor  were  there 
significant group differences at baseline on any of the pri-
mary or secondary outcome variables.

Primary Social Cognition Variables

Treatment  Effects.    Estimated  marginal  means,  results, 
and effect sizes are summarized in table 3 (see supplemen-
tary table 1 for raw means). For emotional processing, there 
were significant SCST effects on both outcome measures. 
As displayed in figure 1a, for facial affect perception, the 
combined SCST groups demonstrated significantly greater 
improvement over time than controls. This remained sig-
nificant  even  after  adjustment  for  multiple  comparisons. 
There was also a trend-level in vivo effect, reflecting a ten-
dency  toward  greater  improvements  in  SCST-Clinic  vs 
SCST-in vivo in the second half of the treatment period; 
this is the opposite of what would be expected although it 
did not rise to the level of statistical significance.

Similarly, as displayed in figure 1b, the combined SCST 
groups  demonstrated  significantly  greater  improvement 
on  Mayer-Salovey-Caruso  Emotional  Intelligence  Test 
(MSCEIT) Total scores over time than controls, though 
this did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. 
There  was  not  a  significant  in  vivo  effect,  although  the 
means  were  more  stable  in  the  SCST-Clinic  group  than 
the SCST-in vivo which actually had a small decline dur-
ing the second half of treatment.

For attributional bias, the results were also somewhat 
counter-intuitive. Across groups, total AIHQ scores sig-
nificantly decreased (ie, improved). There was also a sig-
nificant  in  vivo  effect.  However,  as  shown  in  figure  1c, 
scores  in  the  second  half  of  treatment  continued  to 
decrease  in  SCST-Clinic  but  got  worse  and  returned  to 
baseline levels in SCST-in vivo. The in vivo effect was not 
significant after multiple comparison correction.

For  empathic  accuracy,  there  was  no  SCST  effect 
(group  by  time  interaction)  but  there  was  a  significant 
in  vivo  effect  in  the  expected  direction.  As  shown  in  
figure  1d,  scores  for  SCST-in  vivo  group  improved  but 

those for the SCST-Clinic group were relatively flat. The 
in vivo effect was not significant after multiple compari-
son correction.

Finally, there was a nonsignificant trend for the SCST 
effect for The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) 
Total, with scores tending to improve more in the com-
bined SCST groups than controls. There were no signifi-
cant treatment effects for the PONS.

Durability.    We  next  evaluated  the  durability  for  the  4 
social  cognitive  variables  that  showed  significant  treat-
ment effects. For the comparison of 12 to 24 weeks (see 
figure 2 and supplementary table 2 for full results), there 
were no overall significant time or group by time effects 
for posttreatment change, suggesting a general absence of 
change from end-point to follow-up, although trend-level 
effects were observed for facial affect identification (time) 
and AIHQ (interaction).

For the comparison of 0 to 24 weeks (see supplemen-
tary  table  3  for  full  results),  with  regard  to  facial  affect 
identification,  there  were  significant  time  and  group  by 
time effects; post hoc analyses indicated that scores were 
significantly  higher  (ie,  improved)  at  follow-up  vs  base-
line for both the SCST-Clinic and in vivo groups but not 
for the Control group. Thus, the significant facial affect 
identification  improvements  associated  with  SCST  were 
relatively durable.

With regard to AIHQ, there was  a significant overall 
time  effect  indicating  that  scores  were  generally  lower 
(ie, improved) at 24 than at 0 weeks across groups; post 
hoc  analyses  indicated  this  was  primarily  driven  by 
improvement within the Control group. Thus, the overall 
results indicate that the SCST-Clinic and in vivo groups 
did  not  lead  to  durable  improvements  in  attributional 
bias. Finally, with regard to the MSCEIT and empathic

accuracy,  there  were  no  significant  time  or  group  by 
time effects when comparing 0- to 24-week scores. Thus, 
despite  the  improvements  in  these  areas  during  treat-
ment,  the  changes  at  follow-up  were  not  significantly 
above baseline levels.

Secondary Outcome Measures

As  shown  in  table  4  (see  supplementary  table  4  for  raw 
means) there were no significant SCST or in vivo effects for 
the measures of neurocognition, symptoms, or functioning.

Tolerability Ratings

Participants reported uniformly high tolerability ratings. 
Across  groups,  there  were  high  mean  (SD)  ratings  for 
how  much  they  liked  the  groups  (9.0  [1.6]),  how  enthu-
siastic  they  considered  the  trainers  (8.9  [1.4]),  how  well 
trainers know the material (9.4 [1.1]), how much the treat-
ment helped their daily lives (8.6 [1.7]), and how much the 
treatment helped with symptoms (8.6 [1.8]). There were 
no significant between-group differences (supplementary 
table 5).

Discussion

As  in  prior  studies  of  SCST,  the  refined  and  expanded 
SCST program was well tolerated. Further, attrition rates 
were low and fidelity ratings were uniformly high. In this 
context,  there  was  a  robust  and  relatively  durable  over-
all  SCST  benefit  for  facial  emotion  identification.  This 
improvement  was  not  accompanied  by  any  differential 
between-group changes in neurocognition or symptoms. 
There  was  also  a  significant  SCST  effect  for  emotional 
intelligence  and  a  significant  in  vivo  effect  for  empathy, 
though these improvements were less robust and were not 
durable. Furthermore, there were no overall SCST-related 
improvements for functioning, and the in vivo group did 
not show any relative functional improvements. Although 
this study bolsters and extends evidence for the efficacy 
of SCST in certain respects, our efforts to enhance func-
tioning were not successful.

We replicated prior findings that SCST improves emo-
tion  processing.9–11  The  improvement  in  facial  affect 

perception  converges  with  most  prior  social  cognition 
treatment  studies.6  Somewhat  surprisingly,  there  was  a 
nonsignificant trend for larger improvements for SCST-
Clinic  vs  in  vivo  in  the  second  half  of  treatment.  The 
SCST-Clinic group received 6 additional practice sessions 
that included some exercises similar in content and for-
mat to the affect perception outcome measure, and this 
extra practice may have contributed to this finding.

SCST is the only targeted social cognition intervention 
to  show  broad  improvement  in  the  area  of  emotional 
intelligence.9,17 Notably, although the refined SCST pro-
gram  targets  several  aspects  of  emotion  processing,  the 
MSCEIT  branches  extend  beyond  these  areas  to  pro-
cesses such as using emotions to enhance cognition and 
regulating  emotions.  Thus,  the  benefits  of  SCST  gener-
alize to areas of emotion processing that are not directly 
targeted in this treatment.

A key expansion of the SCST program was the addi-
tion  of  a  module  to  address  empathy.  There  was  an 

1263

W. P. Horan et al

SCST-in vivo related improvement on an empathic accu-
racy  task,  and  performance  on  this  task  is  impaired  in 
schizophrenia  and  linked  to  poor  functioning.18,19  This 
improvement  converges  with  a  proof  of  concept  study 
by  our  group  which  found  that  patients  who  received 
intra-nasal  oxytocin  (vs  placebo)  before  each  of  12  ses-
sions  (including  4  on  empathy)  of  SCST  differentially 
improved empathic accuracy.8 Speculatively, engaging in 
in vivo training exercises in real-world settings may have 
contributed  to  increased  sensitivity  to  others’  emotions. 
This is consistent with a recent social cognition treatment 
study  that  engaged  family  members  or  close  friends  as 
“practice partners” and found improvement on a differ-
ent empathy measure.20 Thus, empathy, particularly with 
adjunctive treatment elements to maximize benefits, is a 
modifiable treatment target.

This study is one of the few to examine the durability 
of treatment effects. The results were mixed. The SCST-
related  treatment  effects  for  facial  affect  identification 
were relatively durable, with scores at the 3-month post-
treatment  follow-up  assessment  remaining  above  base-
line levels. Notably, there was already some evidence of 
deterioration  for  the  SCST-Clinic  group  over  the  rela-
tively  brief  follow-up  period,  and  it  is  unclear  whether 
the apparent benefits would persist over longer intervals. 
The  treatment  related  effects  for  emotional  intelligence 
and  empathy  were  not  durable  as  significant  improve-
ments  were  not  evident  at  follow-up  compared  to  base-
line  scores.  The  few  studies  of  other  interventions  have 
also been mixed, with one reporting retention of gains at 
a 6-month follow-up in an inpatient forensic sample21 and 
another reporting no social cognitive gains at either the 
end of treatment or 3-month follow-up in outpatients.22

Findings for the other 3 social cognitive domains were 
less clear-cut. For attributional bias, the findings were sig-
nificant but not in line with our predictions. AIHQ scores 
improved in the combined study sample as a whole, but 
the  significant  in  vivo  effect  reflected  a  worsening  of 
AIHQ  scores  during  the  second  half  of  treatment  for 
SCST-in vivo. Although we have not found improvements 
on the AIHQ in our prior SCST studies, the recent Kurtz 
et al review reported an overall improvement in the small 
to  moderate  range.  It  is  possible  that  engaging  in  real-
life  interactions  in  community-based  exercises  had  the 
effect  of  confirming  patients’  initial  attributional  biases 
and  consequently  moving  their  AIHQ  scores  closer  to 
baseline levels. However, the numeric difference between 
SCST-in  vivo  vs  –Clinic  on  the  AIHQ  at  12  weeks  was 
small (.25 on a 5-point scale) and we are reluctant to over 
interpret this unexpected finding.

For mentalizing, we found only a nonsignificant trend 
toward SCST-related improvement. Although the Kurtz 
et  al  review  reported  medium-to-large  improvements 
in  mentalizing,  no  prior  studies  by  our  group  and  oth-
ers  that  used  the  TASIT6,23  have  reported  significant 
improvements.  Finally,  for  social  perception,  there  were 

1264

no SCST-related effects. Similar to mentalizing, we have 
found  no  improvement  in  this  domain  using  PONS  in 
our  studies,  although  a  few  other  groups  have  reported 
benefits using alternative tasks. These findings highlight 
the fact that there is currently no widely accepted battery 
of social cognitive tasks for use in clinical trials (see7 for 
further methodological critique). Indeed, it is known that 
many  available  tests  have  relatively  poor  psychometric 
properties.23–25  Notably,  the  MSCEIT  and  empathic  ac-
curacy  tasks,  which  showed  positive  treatment  effects, 
have relatively good psychometric properties,19,26 whereas 
the  PONS,  AIHQ,  and  TASIT  have  fared  less  well  in 
psychometric  studies.27,28  This  key  measurement  issue  is 
being  addressed  in  the  Social  Cognition  Psychometric 
Evaluation project.27,28

We did not find evidence for generalization of SCST 
benefits to improvements in functional capacity or com-
munity functioning. Functioning has typically not been a 
primary outcome in social cognition treatment research, 
although  some  smaller  studies  included  various  func-
tional  measures.  Some  reported  benefits  (eg,  20,29)  while 
others reported mixed or null findings (eg,  22,30; see7 for 
review).  Although  in  vivo  community-based  training 
exercises have been found to promote functional improve-
ments  in  other  psychosocial  treatments,13  we  found  no 
such benefits. Two prior trials that included components 
designed to enhance generalization (ie, including family 
members or friends as practice partners) reported posi-
tive results for functional capacity31 and other measures 
of social functioning/quality of life.32 Although neither 
study was designed to test whether the bridging activities 
provided any benefit beyond regular treatment, the find-
ings raise the question of optimal dosing. Both studies, 
as  well  as  recent  studies  of  cognitive  remediation  with 
bridging groups,33 devoted more time to these activities 
than  we  did.  Aside  from  dosage,  several  other  factors 
may have contributed to the lack of generalization. First, 
the  content  of  the  sessions  may  not  have  adequately 
matched  the  skills  assessed  on  our  functional  outcome 
measures.  For  example,  improvements  in  community 
functioning  often  require  interactions  with  known  (or 
increasingly  familiar)  others  (eg,  succeeding  in  a  job, 
making and keeping friends), while our in vivo sessions 
were conducted in public settings with unknown others. 
Second, more focused assessments of functioning, such 
as the Ecological Momentary Assessment method, may 
be  more  sensitive  to  functional  changes  than  our  out-
come measures. Third, in vivo training approaches may 
be more useful for only certain aspects of social cogni-
tion (eg, empathy).

This is the largest rigorously-controlled social cogni-
tive treatment study to date and the results support the 
efficacy  of   the  SCST  approach  for  certain  social  cog-
nitive  domains.  As  mentioned  above,  study  limitations 
include the relatively short follow-up period and the rel-
atively low dose of  in vivo sessions. It should be noted 

that  only  the  SCST-related  treatment  benefit  for  facial 
affect identification survived a conservative Bonferroni 
correction. In addition, the content and structure of  the 
6 additional SCST-in vivo and –Clinic sessions differed 
in  several  respects,  as  the  in  vivo  exercises  were  built 
around  the  specific  community-based  locations  where 
they were held. Further, the generalizability of  findings 
from this chronically ill, predominantly male sample to 
other populations (eg, recent-onset patients) is unclear. 
Although  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of   social  cognitive 
interventions is growing and our results extend support 
in a few key ways, the ultimate goal of  such programs is 
to  achieve  lasting  improvements  in  functioning.  Thus, 
a  critical  direction  for  future  research  is  to  develop 
more  effective  ways  to  achieve  generalization  to  the 
community.
