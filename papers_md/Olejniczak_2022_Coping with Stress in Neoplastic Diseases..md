Abstract: Introduction: Disease-related stress is a common phenomenon. It also occurs in neoplastic
diseases. Since physical and mental health are interrelated, it is important to make sure that treatment
covers these two areas. Therefore, it is essential to learn how patients with neoplastic diseases can
cope with stress. Materials and Methods: The respondents are 306 patients suffering from neoplastic
diseases, associated in patient advocacy groups. The method is the Brief-COPE (Coping Orientation
to Problems Experienced) questionnaire. Results: The following stress management strategies were
most commonly adopted by the patients: acceptance (median 2.25; 25–75% IQR 2.0–3.0), active coping
(median 2.0; 25–75% IQR (interquartile range) 1.5–2.0), planning (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 2.0–2.0),
emotional support (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 1.5–2.0), instrumental support (median 2.0; 25–75%
IQR 2.0–2.0), self-distraction (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 1.5–3.0), and venting (median 2.0; 25–75%
IQR 1.5–3.0). A decision to adopt a particular stress management strategy by patients with neoplastic
diseases was highly affected by demographic factors (p < 0.05), such as sex, education, age, place of
residence and employment. Conclusions: Teaching stress management strategies should be a part of
the education process among patients with neoplastic diseases. Before or in the course of treatment,
an oncology patient should be educated on the prevention of mental health disorders. The ability to
cope with stress is one of the key competences for the course of neoplastic diseases and it can affect
the treatment process. Stress management in chronic diseases, including neoplastic diseases, should
be approached not only at the level of an individual person but also at the level of the health system
as a whole.

A diagnosis of a neoplastic disease often becomes a source of considerable stress
for a patient and their family, which has been shown in many studies, e.g., by Sklar and
Anisman [1]. Necessity to change one’s lifestyle and adapt to limitations imposed by the
disease are just one of many after-effects and are frequently a heavy burden for one’s
mental health, which has been investigated in many studies over the years, e.g., by Lissoni
et al. [2]. Considering the above, it is essential to make education about stress management
an integral part of the treatment process. Physical and mental health are interrelated,
and, thus, better mental well-being might determine treatment effectiveness, e.g., through
consequent participation in treatment procedures or maintaining an appropriate level of
compliance or adherence. It has been shown that there is an interrelation between the
location of cancer and the patient’s mental health condition [3].

It seems essential to monitor patient’s mental health condition in the course of treat-
ment in order to promptly make an intervention, if necessary. An obvious recommendation

on the treatment of patients with neoplastic diseases is to involve a psychologist or a
psychiatrist in the therapeutic team. This solution allows for a more comprehensive patient
care [3].

Currently, only few studies can be found in the global scientiﬁc literature on stress
management in patients with neoplastic diseases. Patient guidebooks typically include
information on external solutions (e.g., oncology rehabilitation, support groups, or psy-
chological support). Certain studies have shown a positive inﬂuence of the task model on
treatment and patient–doctor cooperation [3]. However, there is lack of studies concerning
stress management strategies used by the patients with neoplastic diseases, especially
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of the study was to identify the strategies of stress management used by

cancer patients.

2. Materials and Methods

The study group consisted of 306 patients diagnosed with neoplastic diseases and
associated in the patient advocacy groups, which are focused on advocacy for patients,
survivors, and caregivers. Access to the study group was obtained from oncological
organizations cooperating in the framework of national educational program for patients
PACJENCI.PRO, the Academy of Patient Organization Development. The project was
carried out by the Employers’ Union of Innovative Pharmaceutical Companies INFARMA
and the Medical University of Warsaw, under the auspices of the Patients’ Rights Ofﬁce.
Inclusion criteria to the study were age ≥18 years old and cancer diagnosis.

In the study, the Brief-COPE standardized questionnaire was used [4]. It is a tool
for examining adults, both healthy and ill. It consists of 28 statements that are assigned
to 14 strategies (2 statements per strategy): active coping, planning, positive re-framing,
acceptance, humor, religion, emotional support, instrumental support, self-distraction,
denial, venting, substance use and behavioral disengagement. The respondent comments
on each statement on a scale from 0 (I almost never do it) to 3 (I almost always do it). This
method is typically used to measure one’s coping mechanisms, i.e., to assess typical ways
of reacting to and experiencing highly stressful events.

The Polish version of the Brief-COPE questionnaire was validated by Juczy ´nski and

Ogi ´nska-Bulik [4].

Reliability: Internal consistency reliability of the Polish version of Brief-COPE was
established on the basis of a study conducted in 200 persons aged 25–60 years. Split-
half reliability was 0.86 (Guttman’s coefﬁcient of 0.87). Consistency is satisfactory for
most scales.

Validity: Factor loadings of individual statements can be assumed as satisfactory.
Diagnostic validity was assessed by correlating the results of Brief-COPE with the Mini-
MAC scale, which is used to examine the strategy of coping with a neoplastic disease, and
by forecasting the intensiﬁcation of post-traumatic stress symptoms in mothers of children
with leukemia.

Norms: Norms for university students and adults aged 20–65 years are expressed in

means and standard deviations.

Use: The questionnaire is used to assess the ways of coping with stress.

It was
developed for scientiﬁc purposes but it can also be used for screenings and preventive tests,
and to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interactions.

The questionnaire was conducted using the CAWI method (computer-assisted web
interview). It was published online as a Google Form. The results were collected automati-
cally by the Form and then analyzed in a statistical program.

Consent of the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw was obtained
for the research. Protocol number of the ethics is AKBE-161/2022. Patients were informed
about the objective of the study. Each patient qualiﬁed for the studies received information
that the collected results will be used only for scientiﬁc purposes. The participation in the
study was voluntary.

Statistical Analysis

Characteristics of the study group were analyzed using descriptive statistics: n, per-
centage, mean, SD (standard deviation), median, 25–75% IQR (interquartile range). The
differences between the subgroups were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney test. The Spear-
man correlation coefﬁcient was estimated to evaluate the relationship between age and
different strategies of coping with stress. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.
The analysis was conducted using Statistica, version 13 (http://statistica.io, accessed on
7 May 2022). TIBCO Software Inc., Krakow, Poland (2017).

3. Results

306 patients participated in the study, the majority of whom were women (83.3%). The
mean age was 39 years. Half of the respondents lived in cities with more than 100,000 resi-
dents. Most respondents had university education and worked full-time (66.7%). A total of
83.3% of respondents were in a formal/informal relationship (Table 1).

The most common stress management strategies that were adopted by patients with
neoplastic diseases in the course of oncological treatment were as follows: acceptance (me-
dian 2.25; 25–75% IQR 2.0–3.0), active coping (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 1.5–2.0), planning
(median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 2.0–2.0), emotional support (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 1.5–2.0),
instrumental support (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 2.0–2.0), self-distraction (median 2.0; 25–75%
IQR 1.5–3.0), and venting (median 2.0; 25–75% IQR 1.5–3.0). The least commonly adopted
stress management strategies were substance use (median 0.0; 25–75% IQR 0.0–0.0), humor
(median 0.75; 25–75% IQR 0.5–2.0) and denial (median 1.0; 25–75% IQR 0.5–1.5) (Figure 1).
The following demographic factors signiﬁcantly affected the strategies of coping with
stress among patients with neoplastic diseases: sex, education, age, place of residence,
and employment.

Women used the following stress management strategies signiﬁcantly more than
men (p < 0.05): planning, active coping, positive re-framing, religion, discontinuation of
activity, and substance use. Compared to women, men more frequently (p < 0.05) chose
acceptance, emotional and instrumental support, self-distraction, venting, humor and
blaming oneself (Table 2).

IQR—interquartile range.

There is a positive correlation (p < 0.05) between the age of patients and the strategies of
active coping, planning, shift to religion, emotional support, and blaming oneself. However,
the older the patients get, the less frequently they choose the strategies of acceptance,
humor, instrumental support, self-distraction, venting, substances use, and discontinuation
of activity (p < 0.05) (Table 3).

Limitation of the Study

The study was limited by the size of the sample and the selected group of respondents.

The analysis included cancer patients associated in the patient advocacy groups.

4. Discussion

Cancer diagnosis is a traumatic event in patients’ life. Patients use different strategies
to deal with distress, which could have impact on treatment compliance, psychological
health and quality of cancer patients’ life. Psychological help is essential to identify stress
management strategies and modify them. In our study, the most frequent strategy used
by cancer patients was acceptance. Patients tend to focus on coping with stress through
planning, active coping, self-distraction, venting and religion. Sabanciogullari and Yilmaz

showed the positive relationship between positive religious-coping style and hope levels
of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [5]. Other authors also conﬁrmed that turning
to religion by patients could inﬂuence compliance to the disease, and treatment among
cancer patients [6–8]. In our study, patients tended towards emotional and instrumental
support. They should receive psychosocial help from health professionals. Only 21%
of cancer patients in Poland received psychological support from psychologists and 4%
from priests. Only 7% of cancer patients claimed that they received help from a social
worker [9]. Rarely, patients tended to use stress management strategies such as humor,
denial and blaming oneself. It is a positive phenomenon that destructive strategies, such
as substance use, are rather uncommon in our study. This is a positive result considering
other studies, e.g., a study by Esterbauer et al., which showed that chronically ill patients
react to stress with the consumption of drugs and nicotine [10]. The results presented above
indicate that a chronically ill person should be monitored and made secure against the
use of psychoactive substances, as an irrational method of coping with the disease-related
stress. This is also applicable to diseases other than neoplastic diseases. Importantly,
many researchers, e.g., Alter, point out that focusing on pain, mood, mental stress and
other problems related to quality of life can allow for effective treatment of symptoms and
improvement in patient’s functioning, even in the case of late-stage neoplastic disease [11].
Currently, there are few studies available on the strategies of coping with stress in patients
with neoplastic diseases. Patient guides typically contain information on external solutions
(e.g., oncological rehabilitation, support groups, and psychological support). Certain
studies show that there is a positive impact of the task model on treatment and patient–
doctor cooperation. However, it is not known how many patients actually deal with stress
in neoplastic diseases, or which stress management strategies are most commonly used by
patients, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic [3].

Various demographic factors have a signiﬁcant impact on the strategies of coping with
stress in patients with neoplastic diseases, which has been conﬁrmed by Esterbauer [10]. In
this case, a multivariate analysis of covariance was used. Regarding age, men suffering from
heart diseases showed higher values in the coping strategy tendency to ﬂee. Women with
heart complaints demonstrated signiﬁcantly lower values in minimizing by comparison.
In our study, patients with higher education, professionally active, women, younger and
lived in bigger cities more often cope with stress using substances use. Identiﬁcation of the
risk group is important for introducing appropriate psychological support to improve their
health, whereas lower education, unemployment, older age, living in smaller cities, and
men are predisposing factors to seek emotional and/or instrumental support. This group
should be monitored in the context of psychosocial support during oncological therapy.
However, the quality of cancer patients’ life is very important.

The authors’ own study shows that compared to men, women signiﬁcantly more often
adopt the strategies of planning, active coping, positive re-framing, and religion. This
is particularly important in light of the study by Ohaeri et al., who showed that women
with breast cancer poorly adapt to the new situation [12]. One of the reasons behind slow
adaptation is the lack of social acceptance for the disease, which is also emphasized by
Tang et al. [13]. With regard to coping with stress, compared to women, men more often
accept the situation, seek emotional and instrumental support, distract attention, vent, joke,
and blame themselves. Considering the studies mentioned above, it is noticeable that most
studies on stress in neoplastic diseases worldwide concern women, especially those with
breast cancer.

The authors’ own study shows that age is a signiﬁcant factor for stress management
in illness: the older the patients get, the more frequently they adopt the strategies of
active coping, planning, religion, searching for emotional support and blaming oneself.
At the same time, the following strategies become less frequently applied: acceptance,
humor, instrumental support, self-distraction, venting, substance use, and discontinuation
of activity. Martins-Klein et al. noted that older adults less frequently reported cancer-

related stress. [14] Whereas among women with breast cancer, older age was correlated
with using maladaptive strategies, hopelessness and fatalism [15].

The authors’ own study shows that positive strategies, such as active coping, planning,
positive re-framing, humor and religion are more frequently observed in patients living
in cities with more than 100,000 residents. Unfortunately, patients in this group often
adopt negative strategies, such as substance use and discontinuation of activity. These
results are in line with the study by Amini-Tehrani et al., who directly presented the
consequence of triggering the chain of identity changes (including distortion of body
image), which ultimately result in full-scale psychological distress [16]. The thesis related
to the distortion of body image was also conﬁrmed in scientiﬁc studies, e.g., by Brandberg
et al. [17]. Therefore, considering the conclusions of their own research, Schmid-Buchi
et al. emphasized the importance of the needs of patients and their relatives, as well as
psychological problems that require professional support even after the end of treatment.
Continuous assessment of the disease symptoms and the needs of patients and their
relatives constitutes the basis for targeted counseling and education [18]. In our study,
patients living in smaller cities with fewer than 100,000 residents statistically signiﬁcantly
more often look for emotional and instrumental support and adopt the strategies of denial
and blaming oneself. It is worth comparing the results presented above with the study by
Tsaras et al., who indicated that considering a high risk of developing mental disorders,
such as depression and anxiety, being a rural inhabitant or an unorthodox Christian with a
high symptom burden may be a predictor of depression and anxiety in patients with breast
cancer [19]. The role of cultural determinants of health are also emphasized by Onyedibe
et al. or Herdman [20,21].

The authors’ own study shows that, compared with patients with secondary school
education, patients with higher education signiﬁcantly more often adopt the strategies of
active coping, planning, positive re-framing, religion and substance use. In turn, acceptance,
emotional and instrumental support, self-distraction, denial, venting, and disengagement
prevail in respondents with secondary school education. Calderon et al. showed that
breast cancer patients with lower educational level more often used hopelessness and
cognitive avoidance [15]. These observations are in line with the studies by Onyedibe et al.
or Herdman [20,21]. This allows for advancing a thesis that the quality of education can be
a determinant of effectively coping with stress in neoplastic diseases. Therefore, it is clear
that there is a need for an individual approach to the therapeutic process, also in terms of
developing and implementing stress management strategies.

The authors’ own study shows that professionally active persons more often adopt not
only the strategies of active coping, planning or positive re-framing, but also the strategy of
substance use. Compared to the professionally active persons, the unemployed signiﬁcantly
more often sought emotional and instrumental support. There are few studies on this topic.
Nevertheless, the available studies, e.g., by Taino et al., conﬁrm the increase in the number
of neoplastic diseases in the working population, which necessitates the creation of a
therapeutic strategy for this group, including stress management strategies [22]. Pluta
points out that professional work brings many beneﬁts to the ill, but at the same time, it
causes many difﬁculties. Both patients and employers are unaware of support options;
intervention activities are rarely undertaken and the state’s aid is insufﬁcient [23].

Distress related to cancer could lead to mental disorders. The prevalence of depres-
sion and anxiety was frequent among breast cancer women. From the meta-analysis, it
was around 32% in the case of depression and around 42% of patients experienced anx-
iety [24,25]. Depression is one of the main health problems inﬂuencing lower survival
rates [26,27]. A meta-analysis conducted by Wang et al. which included 282,203 breast
cancer patients showed that depression was associated with higher risk of cancer recurrence
(by 24%), and all-cause and cancer-speciﬁc mortality, respectively, by 30% and 29%. Anxi-
ety as a second common psychiatric symptom was related to a 17% greater risk of cancer
recurrence and 13% more risk of all-cause mortality [28]. Therefore, before or in the course
of the treatment, each patient with a neoplastic disease should be taught how to prevent

mental health disorders. The ability to cope with stress is one of the key competences for
the treatment of neoplastic diseases. It has an impact on the effectiveness of the treatment,
and, thus, it can improve the quality of life.

The issue of stress management in chronic diseases, e.g., neoplastic diseases, should be
solved not only at the level of a “person”, but also at the level of a health system as a whole.
The need for holistic patient care and the positive outcomes of holistic care have been known
for a long time and they have been shown, e.g., by Becker, according to whom mental
factors affect the immune system as a whole [29]. In addition, it has also been conﬁrmed,
e.g., by Popoola, that the course of a neoplastic disease predisposes depression [30]. This
indicates anticipation of the occurrence of mental disorders in patients with neoplastic
diseases and, thus, suggests the necessity of early preparation of effective solutions.

5. Conclusions

In our study, cancer patients mostly used stress management strategies: acceptance,
active coping and planning. Although patients frequently accepted cancer disease, they
needed emotional and instrumental support.

Each patient should be provided with appropriate psychological support at every stage
of the disease, from diagnosis to the after-treatment period, because patient’s emotions and
needs change at each stage. Different factors of sex, education, age, place of residence, and
employment can inﬂuence stress-coping strategies used by cancer patients. The recognition
and modiﬁcation of destructive behaviors by psycho-oncologists can inﬂuence cancer
patients’ well-being.
