Psychedelic drugs—a new era in 
psychiatry?
David Nutt, DM, FRCP, FRCPsych, FMedSci

This article covers the renaissance of classical psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and LSD plus 3,4-methylene 
dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA—ecstasy) in psychiatric research. These drugs were used quite extensively before they 
became prohibited. This ban had little impact on recreational use, but effectively stopped research and clinical treatments, 
which up to that point had looked very promising in several areas of psychiatry. In the past decade a number of groups have 
been working to re-evaluate the utility of these substances in medicine. So far highly promising preliminary data have been 
produced with psilocybin in anxiety, depression, smoking, alcoholism, and with MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and alcoholism. These findings have led to the European Medicines Agency approving psilocybin for a phase 3 study 
in treatment-resistant depression and the Food and Drug Administration for PTSD with MDMA. Both trials should read out 
in 2020, and if the results are positive we are likely to see these medicines approved for clinical practice soon afterwards.

Introduction

Psychedelics of plant extraction such as mescaline (peyote 
cactus) and psilocybin (magic mushrooms) have been used 
for millennia in cultures all across the globe, but Western 
science was not introduced to them until 1897, when Arthur 
Heffter isolated mescaline. The real breakthrough came 
with the discovery of LSD in 1943 by Albert Hofmann at 
Sandoz as a synthetic variant of ergot alkaloids.1 Following 
his famous descriptions of his first exposure he persuaded 
Sandoz to make LSD available to researchers across the 
world under the trade name Delysid, and Sandoz made it 
freely available to those interested in researching its prop-
erties. Hofmann also identified the active component of 
“magic” mushrooms as psilocybin.2 This was also made 
available by Sandoz as Indocybin. It should be noted that 
psilocybin is in effect a prodrug, and is converted into the 
active ingredient psilocin in the body.

Research with LSD, in particular, flourished and the US 
government, in the form of the National Institutes of Health, 
is reputed to have funded over 130 grants for its study 
(but none since the 1967 ban). Before the ban hundreds 
of papers were published on LSD (and to a lesser extent 
psilocybin).3 Because LSD, psilocybin, and other hallucino-
gens mimicked some of the symptoms of acute psychosis, 
particularly ego-dissolution, thought disorder, and misper-
ceptions, it suggested the possibility that an endogenous 
psychotogen might cause schizophrenia.4 It also seemed to 
allow access to repressed memories and emotions and so 
“unblock” people failing in psychotherapy. LSD appeared 
very safe in relation to other psychotropic agents used at 
that time, especially the barbiturates which were very toxic 
in overdose, whereas the psychedelics rarely had lasting 
medical effects, even after overdose. Indeed a long-term 
follow-up analysis of the impact of the tens of thousands 
of LSD administrations given in the 1950s and 1960s

reported no increased level of psychiatric problems.3 For 
a more detailed overview of the history of psychedelics in 
psychiatry see refs 3 and 5. One more negative note is the 
fact that some saw LSD as a potential weapon in warfare 
rather than as a therapeutic advance. This was seen in both 
the West and in communist countries who developed their 
own drugs when Sandoz would not supply them.

peutic purposes, especially couple counseling, when it was 
known as empathy.9 However, once its name was changed 
to ecstasy and it began to be used in the rave recreational 
scene it was banned and therapeutic use largely stopped. 
Since that time the charity MAPS (the Multidisciplinary 
Association for Psychedelic Studies) led by Rick Doblin 
has campaigned to have it restored as a medicine.

The resurrection  
of psilocybin  
research is still  
in its infancy

One area of particular interest was in the treatment of 
alcoholism. This derived from the personal psychedelic 
experience of Bill Wilson which led to his becoming alco-
hol-free, and so also led to the founding of Alcoholics Anon-
ymous.6 Wilson’s own experience made him 
convinced of the value of LSD to give alco-
holics insight into how they might overcome 
their drinking addiction. He encouraged the 
use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism, 
and six trials were conducted before the 
drug was banned. These data were recently 
subjected to a modern meta-analysis and 
LSD therapy was found to be at least as effi-
cacious a treatment as anything we currently have today.7 Of 
interest to psychotherapists, Wilson also believed that LSD 
could give unique and immediate insights into the uncon-
scious mind. He wrote to Jung encouraging him to explore 
this potential but Jung, who was approaching death at the 
time, didn’t seem especially enthusiastic and apparently 
replied to the effect that dreams were good enough!

In 1967, LSD was classified under Schedule I of the 1967 
United  Nations  convention  on  drugs,  and  most  other 
psychedelics, particularly psilocybin and mescaline, were 
also included even though there was very little evidence of 
harm. Schedule 1 drugs are defined as having no accepted 
medical use AND significant potential for harm and depen-
dence, so despite this schedule clearly being quite unscien-
tific for these drugs they have remained there ever since. 
This scheduling effectively censored research on psyche-
delics for over 40 years and only in the past decade have 
attempts been made to reverse this (see ref 8).

Other recreational drugs with therapeutic 
potential: MDMA and ketamine

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA—the 
correct chemical name for the recreational street drug 
ecstasy)—was quite widely used as a tool for psychothera-

Though MDMA isn’t a psychedelic in the true sense of the 
word, it does have profound effects that allow people to 
gain insight into their psychiatric problems, and has proved 
especially helpful in the treatment of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Several studies run by 
the Mithoefers have demonstrated that a 
couple of sessions of exposure- therapy 
under MDMA (usually 125 mg + a 62.5-mg 
top-up after 2 hours) can have powerful 
therapeutic effects.10,11 The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and European Medi-
cines Agency (EMA) have now both given 
their approval for multicenter studies in the 
USA and Europe, and if these are positive then it seems 
likely that MDMA will also become an approved medicine 
sometime in the 2020s.

We are currently conducting BIMA—the Bristol University 
MDMA for Alcoholism trial. This is an open trial of MDMA 
(two sessions given as in the PTSD trials) for patients with 
alcoholism. The rationale for this is that many such patients 
are drinking alcohol excessively to deaden painful memo-
ries of trauma. If MDMA therapy could help them overcome 
these memories then they might be able to stop or reduce 
their drinking.

Ketamine is an old established dissociative anesthetic that 
has in recent years been used in lower doses as an analgesic. 
Like psychedelics and MDMA, it is also used recreation-
ally to produce altered states of consciousness which are 
psychedelic-like. When John Krystal at Yale started to use 
ketamine as an experimental medicine model of psychosis, 
he noted that people often experienced an improvement 
in mood once they had recovered from the trip. This led 
him and a colleague, Carlos Zarate, to conduct a trial in 
patients with resistant depression with good outcomes. A 
single IV dose of ketamine could produce an improve-
ment in mood lasting up to 4 days.12 Since then there have 
been many related studies conducted with ketamine. Also

its active enantiomer, s-ketamine (given intranasally) has 
been developed commercially and may well be licensed 
in the near future. All forms of ketamine have to be given 
twice weekly to maintain their antidepressant effects. These 
two different forms of ketamine are both thought to act as 
glutamate antagonists of the NMDA receptor system. This 
action thought to lead to a disruption of the abnormal brain 
circuits that underpin depression (see below).13

The pharmacology of psychedelics

The key target for the psychedelic drugs is the serotonin 
5-HT2A receptor where they are agonists, ie, they stimulate 
the receptor. Most psychedelic drugs also have actions at 
other serotonin receptors such as the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B 
receptors where again they have agonist or partial agonist 
activity. However these probably do not contribute to 
the psychedelic effects; we know that 5-HT2A receptor 
agonism is what produces the psychedelic effects because 
Franz Vollenwieder’s group has shown convincingly that 
these are fully blocked by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist 
ketanserin.14,15

The modern-day resurgence of psychedelics  
in psychiatry

The process of resuming clinical research with psychedelics 
came from two parallel directions. One was the develop-
ment of neuroimaging and psychopharmacological studies 
conducted in healthy volunteers and the second from some 
small exploratory clinical studies.

Since the 1990s several groups have begun to apply modern 
research methods to psychedelics with Strassman et al in 
the United States using DMT, and Vollenweider et al in 
Switzerland using psilocybin.15 My own group started in 
the 2000s with psilocybin and conducted the first system-
atic fMRI studies with this drug.16 The results were unex-
pected and surprising because we found that the main effect 
of psilocybin was to decrease brain blood flow and blood 
oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity predominantly in 
the default mode network (DMN) but including the subge-
nual cingulate cortex (Figure 1).

Since several neuroimaging studies have found overactivity 
in this brain region in depression17,18 and many different 
treatments of depression have been found to suppress

tion of brain activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex,  
a brain area implicated in the generation of depression.

activity here,19,20 this finding seemed of interest for depres-
sion. Also it was relatively common for our volunteers to 
report improved mood and well-being after their psilocybin 
administration (even when the drug was given in a scanner). 
For these reasons we wondered if the same decreased 
activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex might occur after 
psilocybin in depressed patients and this might then elevate 
mood. It was this translational medicine insight, supported 
by earlier clinical data, that led to our MRC-funded trial in 
resistant depression described below.

As well as imaging studies there was also a hugely influ-
ential psychopharmacological experiment conducted by 
Roland Griffiths and his team at John Hopkins university 
in Baltimore.21 They gave healthy non-psychiatrically ill 
volunteers a single 25-mg oral dose of psilocybin in a 
psychotherapeutic setting and followed them up for many 
years. A control group treated in the same way received a 
dose of the stimulant methylphenidate. In contrast to the 
methylphenidate group who had little in the way of long-
term benefits, most of the psilocybin participants found the 
experience rewarding and insightful and many said it was 
one of the most significant experiences of their lives, ie, 
being in the top five of their life-time positive experiences. 
Moreover this positive outcome lasted for very many years. 
This was the first systematic controlled study of the use of 
a psychedelic to give insights and produce well-being in

normal volunteers, and served as the basis on which subse-
quent patient studies were conducted. For example in our 
studies we use the same 25-mg oral dose and setting as the 
Griffiths work.

The first modern clinical trial of a psychedelic was by Fran-
cisco Moreno and colleagues, at the University of Arizona 
in 2006.22 Nine subjects with treatment-resistant OCD were 
given up to three different doses of psilocybin in an open-
label design. Significant reductions in OCD symptoms 
were observed but no clear dose effect was seen. Impor-
tantly there were no serious adverse events. The trial was 
reputedly stopped because of the extreme costs involved in 
working with a controlled drug! This is a common problem, 
as discussed later.

The Griffiths team at Johns Hopkins have subsequently 
conducted several clinical trials. The first was an open study 
in people trying to quit tobacco smoking.23 Fifteen otherwise 
psychiatrically healthy smokers in a structured 15-week 
smoking cessation treatment programme were given 25 
mg psilocybin three times (weeks 5, 7, and 13). Biological 
markers of smoking, eg, urinary cotinine level as well as 
smoking craving and urges, were assessed up to 6 months. 
Remarkably 12 of the 15 subjects became and remained 
smoking-free at 6 months—an extremely significant outcome. 
The Hopkins team have also conducted one of the two most 
recent studies on psilocybin for end-of-life depression and 
anxiety, which are discussed as a group below.

The other addiction study with psilocybin was conducted 
by Michael Bogenschutz and colleagues at the Univer-
sity of New Mexico. They gave two psilocybin sessions 
to 10 alcohol-dependent patients in addition to standard 
therapy.24 The primary outcome was the percentage of 
heavy drinking days, and very significant reductions in 
this metric were found with no concerning adverse effects 
of the psilocybin.

One  pilot  study  using  psilocybin  in  major  depressive 
disorder has also been published in the modern litera-
ture.25,26 In this, our own open-label pilot study, we gave 
two doses of psilocybin (a 10-mg “test” dose and a 25-mg 
therapeutic dose) 1 week apart with psychological support 
before and after the experience to 20 patients with treat-
ment-resistant depression who were moderately to severely 
depressed. In reality the participants were mostly multiply 

treatment-resistant (mean number of failed medications was 
4.6 ± 2.6), and the illness was very long-standing (mean 
duration of illness 17.7 years ± 8.4 years). As serotonergic 
antidepressants and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist antipsy-
chotics block the effects of psilocybin, patients were with-
drawn from these before getting the psilocybin treatment. 
The primary outcome measure was the mean change in the 
participant-rated quick inventory of depressive symptoms 
(QIDS-SR) rating scale with follow-up was for 6 months, 
Highly significant improvements in depression ratings were 
seen at all time points with the maximal significance of 
effect seen at 5 weeks. The trial established feasibility and 
evidence of safety, but efficacy interpretations are limited 
by the open-label design.

All the above clinical studies suffer from the major problem 
of being open-label designs. This is acceptable for early 
stage research but a challenge for effectively proving the 
therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics. However, in the past 
couple of years a few controlled clinical trials have now 
been carried out. Four separate controlled studies have 
been published on the use of psychedelics in end-of-life 
anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening 
illness. Gasser et al27 used LSD either a low (20 ug) or a 
high (200 ug) dose whereas the other three studies all used 
psilocybin.

Charles Grob and colleagues in California28 gave 12 subjects 
(11 women) a moderate (0.2 mg/kg) dose of psilocybin 
and an active placebo (niacin 250 mg) in a double-blind 
design in which subjects acted as their own controls. All 
subjects had advanced cancer diagnoses and Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV- 
defined acute stress or anxiety disorders as a result of their 
cancer diagnosis. The treatment was well tolerated and all 
12 completed the 3-month follow up. Nonsignificant trends 
towards improvements in mood were observed, perhaps 
because of the small numbers and relatively low dose of 
psilocybin used.

Two larger, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
crossover trials investigating the efficacy of psilocybin in 
the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with 
life-threatening cancer diagnoses have since been published 
simultaneously from two separate groups in the USA. 
Roland Griffiths and his John Hopkins team treated 51 
patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms occasioned

by life-threatening cancer diagnosis.29 Placebo was a very 
low (ineffective) dose of psilocybin (1 mg or 3 mg/70 kg) 
compared with the much higher active treatment dose (22 
mg or 30 mg/70 kg). Administration was counterbalanced 
with 5 weeks between sessions and 6-month follow up. The 
Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales were the primary 
outcome measures, and showed superiority for the high dose 
versus the low dose at 5 weeks. The crossover high-dose 
group then experienced a significant improvement also. 
Significant associations between mystical-type experiences 
and enduring positive changes were also observed, as in 
previous research of this group.21

In a similarly designed study Stephen Ross and colleagues 
at NYU gave 29 patients a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg psilo-
cybin or 250 mg niacin as active placebo with crossover at 7 
weeks.30 The treatment was delivered safely, with no reports 
of serious adverse events. The group receiving psilocybin 
showed clinical benefits as measured by both clinician and 
participant rated scales that lasted for the 7 weeks prior to 
crossover and were also sustained approximately 8 months 
after dosing. The group that received niacin instead showed 
transient reductions that were not sustained at 7 weeks. After 
they crossed over to psilocybin, they also showed immediate 
and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression scores 
that were sustained at follow-up at 6 months.

As a result of these positive studies the EMA and the FDA 
have both given their approval for a multicenter multi-
country trial of psilocybin run by the UK-based pharma-
ceutical company called COMPASSPathways.31 This will 
involve randomization to one of three doses: 1, 10, and 
25 mg given once only in patients who have failed two 
prior antidepressant treatments in their current episode. The 
study started at the beginning of 2019 and should report in 
2020/21. If positive then both regulators have indicated a 
willingness to approve psilocybin as a medicine. In the USA 
the company USONA is also in the process of developing 
psilocybin as a medicine. Table I summarizes recent and 
current studies on psilocybin.

It  is  also  important  to  record  that  other  studies  with 
different psychedelics have been conducted. I have already 
mentioned the LSD trial by Gasser in Switzerland, and 
this has led to this drug being made available for compas-
sionate use in named patients by a few psychiatrists in 
that country.

A number of countries in South and Latin America allow 
the use of ayahuasca drink for religious and therapeutic 
purposes. This drink contains a mixture of plant products, 
one of which contains the psychedelic dimethyl tryptamine 
(DMT)  and  the  other  a  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitor, 
harmaline. The harmaline blocks the activity of mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors in gut and liver, and so allows 
enough of the DMT in the drink to enter the brain and so 
have its psychedelic effects. Human neuroscience studies 
of ayahuasca have shown it to have similar effects to psilo-
cybin and LSD, and several clinical trials have taken place 
in depressed patients. For example Osorio gave ayahuasca 
to 6 medication- and ayahuasca-naive participants and 
found significant reductions in depression, as shown by the 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Mongomery-Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale up to 2 weeks after treatment.32 
Sanches et al conducted another open-label study in 17 
patients and again, highly significant reductions in depres-
sive symptoms were observed up to the 3-week end point.33 
A double-blind study has since been conducted, also with 
positive outcomes.34

Current challenges and future prospects

Inspection of Table I reveals that the resurrection of psilo-
cybin research is still in its infancy. There have been very 
few double-blinded studies, and total patient numbers are 
very low, less than 200 in all. This means we must be very 
cautious in making claims about the value of psychedelic 
therapy in psychiatry. Much more needs to be done, and the 
key question is how best to do this.

In the following sections I highlight what I think are the key 
issues that the field needs to take into consideration if this 
exciting yet still only promising new research area is to be 
properly assessed.

The first point to be made clear is that treatment with 
psychedelics and MDMA is a complex procedure that 
requires a great deal of therapists’ time and involvement. 
It had been suggested that this is a new era of psychiatric 
treatment—drug-assisted psychotherapy (or even psycho-
therapy-assisted drug treatment). Patients have to be prop-
erly prepared for the powerful impact of the psychedelic 
session, and this involves at least one dedicated session 
with a trained therapist (often called a guide) before the 
drug session. In this prep session the patient is educated

about the rationale, purpose, and procedure of the treatment 
session.

The drug session itself is given in a room with soft ambient 
lighting and a comforting soundtrack (which may contribute 
to the therapeutic value as well).35 There are generally two 
therapists present in the room (ideally one male and one 
female) who are there to provide reassurance, medical 
cover, and care. They only talk with the patient if the patient 
wants them to, which they generally do not. It is important 
to note that there is no expectation of conversation during 
the “trip” and no direction by either therapist of the patient’s 
speech or thought. It is the next day in the “integration” 

session that the content of the trip is discussed and inter-
preted and psychotherapeutic benefits derived (see ref 36 
for detailed descriptions of the experiences that patients in 
our depression study described).

Some critics of the procedure have argued that such inten-
sive therapist input may constitute the therapeutic process, 
rather than the drug itself. Others have questioned whether 
the drug alone without therapy might work just as well. 
These are fair scientific points, but the reality of the power 
of a trip is such that we believe to allow one without medical 
and therapist cover would be unethical. The argument that it 
is all a powerful psychotherapeutic placebo is not sustain-

able because of the Griffiths and Ross double-blind studies 
where placebo + intense psychotherapy did not work as well 
as psychotherapy plus the active drug.

The question of safety is important. Although the banning of 
psychedelics and MDMA was made on the basis of largely 
fictitious claims of harm, there is no doubt that the psyche-
delics in particular are powerful mind-altering drugs, that 
can leave deep negative as well as positive memories.37 A 
more recent analysis of comparative experiences from, and 
adverse effects of, psilocybin has been produced.38

There  is  also  the  risk  of  precipitating  or  worsening 
psychosis. For the latter reason we exclude anyone with a 
history of psychosis in themselves or in first-degree family 
members. So far we have also excluded patients with bipolar 
depression in case mania might be precipitated. With these 
precautions we have found adverse effects to be rare, and 
no-one has asked to stop the treatment. However, unlike with 
recreational users we found that very few of the depressed 
patients enjoyed the experience.36 They found confronting 
their depressive thoughts and memories quite challenging, 
but afterwards almost all felt the experience had been worth-
while. However, we were prepared for anyone needing to be 
rescued from a severe bad trip by having a parenteral form 
of a benzodiazepine ready as escape medication. This, we 
have found, worked in an earlier study with LSD where 
one subject wanted relief. An extra safety measure held in 
readiness is the 5-HT2A receptor-blocking antipsychotic 
drug, olanzapine.

One common clinical challenge is the fact that so many 
patients are already on antidepressant and other drugs that 
block the effects of psychedelics. 5-HT2A receptor-blocking 
antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine and olanzapine 
completely block the access of the psilocybin to the 5-HT2A 
receptor, so it is unable to work.39 Also, the selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) desensitize these receptors 
and so reduce the psychedelic’s effects.40 We found that 
stopping these is often necessary, but of course is associated 
with the risk of worsening the underlying depression and 
also inducing withdrawal or discontinuation reactions, so 
this needs to be done slowly and carefully.

The legal status of this treatment is also a challenge, as 
all psychedelics and MDMA are listed in the UN Conven-
tions as Schedule 1 drugs.41 Despite the growing evidence 

of efficacy and safety they are still subject to intense legal 
controls. This means that getting supplies is extremely diffi-
cult and time-consuming, and very expensive. I calculated 
that the cost of each administration of psilocybin in our 
first psilocybin depression study cost about £1500 and took 
2 years to procure. Until these regulations are reformed, 
this research will thus continue to be very limited and the 
therapeutic utility of these remarkable drugs will take an 
unnecessarily long time to be properly evaluated.42

Finally, how do these drugs work? The current thinking 
with psychedelics and depression is that they disrupt the 
dysregulated brain circuits that underpin depression. In the 
introduction I already mentioned the switching down of 
activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex by psilocybin, 
in common with other treatments for depression. Another 
interesting and related idea is that of psilocybin switching 
off the default mode network (DMN). For example, Berman 
and colleagues43 have demonstrated that in depressed people 
a much greater amount of brain is active in the DMN condi-
tion than in healthy controls. This overengagement of the 
DMN appears to be a cause—or maybe a manifestation—
of the intense self-deprecatory rumination that depressed 
patients experience.43 Psychedelics significantly disrupt 
ongoing DMN activity.44 So, for the duration of the trip the 
depressive processes are also disrupted. This in itself may 
give the patients a view of a depression-free world to which 
they can aspire after the drug treatment session. But there 
may be more to it than that, because the increased synaptic 
flexibility produced by 5-HT2A receptor stimulation in 
preclinical models45 may allow the brain to reset itself into 
a different, depression-free, state. Another possibility shown 
by fMRI connectivity analysis is that psilocybin may alter 
the pattern of dominant connections between frontal cortex 
and subcortical regions such as the amygdala.46

There is now good conceptual evidence that the antidepres-
sant effects of psychedelics are mediated in quite a different 
way to those of serotonin-acting antidepressant drugs such 
as the SSRIs.47 The latter seem to provide a buffer against 
stress by enhancing serotonin function at the 5-HT1A 
receptor, so making the person more resilient. In contrast 
we believe that the psychedelics acting via stimulation of 
the 5-HT2A receptor work to reset the brain processes, eg, 
overconnected DMN that underpins the depressive thinking 
and so allows the patient to work through their issues and 
so overcome their depression. It appears that activations

of these serotonin receptors can have profound and long-
lasting effects on brain function that might explain why a 
single dose can lead to antidepressant efficacy for weeks or 
months.47 However, for most of our patients the depressed 
ideation began to re-emerge by 6 months. So in our ongoing 
study of psilocybin versus escitalopram we are giving a 
second psilocybin dose 3 weeks after the first to explore if 
more enduring activity might be produced.
MDMA works quite differently; it is a serotonin-releasing 
agent48 and fMRI studies have revealed its main activity 
as being in the limbic system where it suppresses activity 
especially of amygdala and hippocampus.49 We believe that 
it is this damping down of the emotional memory circuits 
that helps patients with PTSD relive their traumas and at the 
same time overcome and eventually extinguish the intense 
emotions that go with the memories of them.50
We cannot finish a review of the psychological effects of 
psychedelics without mentioning microdosing.51-53 This has 

become a topic of general discussion, especially in people 
working in the creative industries, many of whom claim to 
use low, ie, subpsychedelic doses, of psilocybin or LSD to 
aid their mental processes. Some claim that this helps with 
their mood and may keep depression at bay. These doses are 
taken regularly, usually a couple of times a week. However, 
since these drugs are illegal there is no way of knowing for 
sure what they are and what exact doses are being used. 
Also there are no controlled trials so the effects could all be 
suggestion or placebo. Still, it is pharmacologically plau-
sible that some low-level activation of the 5-HT2A receptor 
from a microdose might alter brain function in a positive 
creative way, and research into this possibility is urgently 
required. n
