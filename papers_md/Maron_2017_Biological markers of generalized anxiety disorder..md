 Introduction

  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a serious 

psychiatric condition, affecting up to 6% of the popula-
tion during their lifetime1; if not appropriately treated, it 
has a chronic course and carries a high burden of disabil-
ity and public burden. Its manifestation is complicated by 
the comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, such as 
major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  panic  disorder,  and 
alcohol/substance  abuse,2  which  additionally  aggravate 
outcome  and  contribute  to  a  poor  treatment  response. 
Patients with GAD are frequently users of primary care 
resources  in  Western  countries,  having  a  large  impact 
on  the  health  care  system.3 As  with  treatment  of  other 
psychiatric  disorders,  the  treatment  of  GAD  involves 
two targets—a reduction in acute symptoms and relapse 
prevention  in  the  long  term.4  Until  now,  international 
guidelines  for  GAD  treatment  have  recommended  se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin 
and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pre-
gabalin  as  first-line  options,  owing  to  their  established 
efficacy  and  good  safety  profiles,  with  benzodiazepines 
such as diazepam as second-line options.5 However, de-
layed action, worsening of anxious symptoms in the first

Generalized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD)  is  a  prevalent  and 
highly disabling mental health condition; however, there 
is still much to learn with regard to pertinent biomarkers, 
as well as diagnosis, made more difficult by the marked 
and  common  overlap  of  GAD  with  affective  and  anxi-
ety  disorders.  Recently,  intensive  research  efforts  have 
focused  on  GAD,  applying  neuroimaging,  genetic,  and 
blood-based  approaches  toward  discovery  of  pathoge-
netic  and  treatment-related  biomarkers.  In  this  paper, 
we review the large amount of available data, and we 
focus in particular on evidence from neuroimaging, ge-
netic, and neurochemical measurements in GAD in order 
to  better  understand  potential  biomarkers  involved  in 
its etiology and treatment. Overall, the majority of these 
studies have produced results that are solitary findings, 
sometimes  inconsistent  and  not  clearly  replicable.  For 
these  reasons,  they  have  not  yet  been  translated  into 
clinical  practice.  Therefore,  further  research  efforts  are 
needed to distinguish GAD from other mental disorders 
and to provide new biological insights into its pathogen-
esis and treatment.

days of treatment, and troublesome side effects—such as 
nausea and sexual dysfunction for SSRIs and SNRIs and 
dizziness and sedation for pregabalin—are often reasons 
of treatment discontinuation and lack of desirable thera-
peutic outcome.4 In addition, a large proportion of GAD 
patients do not obtain a sufficient response to first-line 
treatment or they continue to have residual symptoms; 
they, therefore, are consequently at high risk of experi-
encing disorder chronicity and a low quality of life.6 
  Because  of  these  unmet  needs,  attempts  at  new 
pharmacological approaches for the treatment of GAD 
have  been  introduced,  for  example,  mood  stabilizers 
and atypical antipsychotics in monotherapy or in aug-
mentation  of  standard  treatment  with  SSRIs/SNRIs.4 
However, no other agents—including quetiapine, which 
shows the most robust anxiolytic effect among antipsy-
chotics—can be recommended, at least not as first-line 
options  for  GAD  treatment.  Unfortunately,  recent  at-
tempts  to  find  new  targets  for  GAD  treatment—in 
particular, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) recep-
tors—were not successful.
  GAD  often  remains  marginalized  and  neglected  due 
to traditional diagnostic conception; there is a continuous 
debate between researchers and clinicians about its noso-
logical and neurobiological uniqueness.7 However, the one 
approach  that  is  certain  to  distinguish  GAD  from  other 
mental health disorders and to improve understanding of 
GAD  phenomenology  is  the  investigation  of  biological 
factors commonly referred to as biomarkers that underlie 
GAD  pathogenesis  and  treatment  outcomes.  Psychiatric 
research  efforts  have  recently  prioritized  such  identifica-
tion of biomarkers as it may significantly improve earlier 
diagnosis  and  prevention  strategies  for  mental  disorders. 
GAD has recently become the focus of intensive research 
efforts applying neuroimaging and genetic approaches to-
ward discovery of the pathogenetic biomarkers for GAD; 
however, only a few studies have specifically addressed pre-
dictors of treatment response. In this paper, we review the 
large amount of available data and focus in particular on 
evidence  from  neuroimaging,  genetic,  and  neurochemical 
measurements in GAD in order to better understand po-
tential biomarkers involved in its etiology and treatment. 

Neuroimaging biomarkers

To  date,  the  main  evidence  for  biomarkers  in  GAD 
is  derived  from  neuroimaging  studies,  including  those 
using  structural  (magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI], 

diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]), functional (functional 
MRI [fMRI], positron emission tomography [PET]/sin-
gle-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]), 
and  biochemical  (proton  magnetic  resonance  spectro-
scopic imaging [MRSI]) methods. These different neu-
roimaging techniques have for the most part been used 
to study baseline neuronal characteristics or changes in 
correlation with symptom severity. Only a few of them 
have  measured  the  effect  of  therapeutic  interventions 
on  brain  functioning  in  order  to  explore  treatment 
biomarkers  or  response  predictors.  It  is  notable  that 
available data are not consistent and thus far, vary sig-
nificantly  across  studies.  Several  factors,  including  sex, 
age,  phenotype,  cognitive  functioning,  and  medication 
status,  need  to  be  taken  into  account  when  interpret-
ing structural brain changes detected in GAD. Here, we 
briefly  summarize  the  results  of  neuroimaging  studies 
in GAD and present the key findings in Table I (a sim-
plified summary). 

Structural brain morphology studies

There is good evidence that GAD is characterized by 
significant anatomical changes in the brain, particularly 
within  regions  related  to  anxiety  neurocircuitry.  For 
example,  increased  gray  matter  (GM)  volume  in  the 
amygdala has been repeatedly found in GAD patients.8 
Notably, increased right amygdala volume in GAD pa-
tients, mostly among females, was associated with pro-
longed  reaction  times  on  the  tracking  task,  indicating 
attentional impairment.9 Earlier larger volumes of the 
amygdala and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
were observed in GAD females, suggesting that these 
disturbances in anxiety-specific regions may be related 
to sex predisposition for GAD.10 

In contrast, GM volume in the right putamen was sig-
nificantly  larger  in  GAD  patients  than  in  healthy  con-
trols, whereas a significant sex main effect was found in 
the  left  precuneus/posterior  cingulate  cortex,  with  GM 
volumes  larger  in  males  than  in  females.  However,  no 
sex-by-diagnosis  interaction  effect  was  found  in  this 
study, suggesting that GM volume in GAD is not influ-
enced  by  sex.11 The  same  group  has  also  reported  that 
a  larger  GM  volume  in  the  right  putamen  is  positively 
correlated  with  childhood  maltreatment.12  A  study  in 
medication-free  adolescents  suffering  from  noncomor-
bid GAD reported increased GM volumes in the right 
precuneus and right precentral gyrus and decreased GM

volumes  in  the  left  orbital  gyrus  and  posterior  cingu-
late.13  Compared  with  healthy  adolescents,  youth  with 
GAD exhibited increased cortical thickness in the right 
inferolateral and ventromedial PFC (ie, inferior frontal 
gyrus), the left inferior and middle temporal cortex, and 
the  right  lateral  occipital  cortex.  No  relationships  were 
observed  between  cortical  thickness  and  the  severity 
of  anxiety  symptoms  in  the  significant  regions.14 Addi-
tionally, significantly higher GM volumes were found in 
medication-free  GAD  subjects,  mainly  in  basal  ganglia 
structures and less consistently in the superior temporal 
pole; however, white matter (WM) volumes were lower 
in the dorsolateral PFC.15 Similarly, significant reduction 
in  the  WM  volumes  in  the  dorsolateral  PFC,  anterior 
limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), and midbrain was 
observed  in  GAD  patients  who  had  working  memory 
dysfunction.16  Notably  reduced  dorsolateral  PFC  vol-
ume was negatively correlated with clinical severity and 
illness duration in GAD, whereas a significantly smaller 
orbitofrontal cortex volume was demonstrated in female 
than in male patients.17
  A decrease in hippocampal volumes has also been 
found  in  GAD.18  The  distinguishable  brain  alterna-

tions—in particular, thinner cortices in the right medial 
orbitofrontal and fusiform gyri, left temporal pole, and 
lateral occipital regions—were found in MDD patients 
with  comorbid  GAD  than  in  those  without  GAD  or 
controls, supporting the notion that GAD is a distinct 
clinical entity.19 Finally, reduced frontolimbic structural 
connectivity  was  demonstrated  in  patients  with  GAD 
by a diffusion-tensor imaging study, suggesting a neural 
basis for emotion regulation deficits in GAD.20 

Functional MRI studies

Both  neuronal  response  to  emotional  stimuli  and 
resting-state  connectivity  have  been  investigated  in  a 
number of fMRI studies in GAD, mostly not in relation 
to  treatment  effect.  The  several  regions  traditionally 
connected  to  anxiety  neurocircuitry  and/or  emotional 
regulation,  including  the  amygdala,  anterior  cingulate 
cortex  (ACC),  medial  PFC,  ventrolateral  PFC,  dorso-
lateral PFC, and some others, have shown abnormal or 
changed activities in GAD. In particular, greater amyg-
dala activation was demonstrated in pediatric patients 
with GAD and positively correlated with anxiety sever-

ity.21 Earlier, other pediatric GAD studies have shown 
hyperactivity  in  the  amygdala  in  response  to  negative 
emotional faces.22 Also, disruptions in amygdala-based 
intrinsic  functional  connectivity  networks  have  been 
reported  to  be  similar  between  adult  and  adolescents 
with GAD.23 Similar findings were also evident in adult 
GAD patients.24,25 In another study, GAD patients had 
higher amygdala activation than healthy controls in re-
sponse to neutral, but not angry, faces.26 However, after 
fear  induction  in  a  gambling  task,  patients  with  GAD 
demonstrated  decreased  activity  in  the  amygdala  and 
increased activity in the bed nucleus of the stria termi-
nalis when compared with controls.27 
  The involvement of cortical regions was evidenced 
by  studies  showing  that  in  response  to  angry  faces  or 
triggered worry, GAD patients demonstrated increased 
blood oxygen–level dependent (BOLD) responses in a 
lateral region of the middle frontal gyrus28 and persis-
tent  activation  in  both ACC  and  PFC  areas.29 The  ex-
aggerated early neural responses to errors, as reflected 
by  the  error-related  negativity  on  electroencephalog-
raphy  (EEG),  was  also  linked  to  ACC  abnormalities 
in GAD.30 In contrast, hypoactivation of PFC (only in 
female patients) or reduced dorsal ACC BOLD activ-
ity was observed in response to fearful, sad, angry, and 
happy facial expressions.31,32 The BOLD hypoactivation 
in PFC was also demonstrated in both GAD and panic 
disorder during response in a reappraisal task, suggest-
ing  common  neuronal  pathways  underlying  emotion 
dysregulation  in  both  anxiety  disorders.33  In  contrast, 
significantly  higher  neuronal  activities  were  observed 
in  the  ventrolateral  PFC  and  precentral  gyrus  BOLD 
response to anxiety-inducing words.34 
  The  ventromedial  PFC  has  been  shown  to  have  a 
critical  role  in  threat  processing  in  close  association 
with broader corticolimbic circuit abnormalities, which 
may  synergistically  contribute  to  GAD.35  Moreover, 
the maladaptive threat processing was observed in the 
ventral tegmental area and the mesocorticolimbic sys-
tem in female patients with GAD, which may implicate 
dopaminergic pathways in clinical anxiety.36 In trials in-
cluding  an  angry  face,  adolescents  with  GAD  showed 
greater right ventrolateral PFC activation than healthy 
adolescents.  This  activation  was  negatively  correlated 
with  anxiety  severity,  suggesting  that  the  neuronal  in-
crease  in  BOLD  signal  may  serve  as  a  compensatory 
response.37  However,  functional  abnormalities  in  ven-
tral  cingulate  and  the  amygdala  seem  to  be  common 

both for major depression and GAD, perhaps because 
of shared genetic factors.38 However, those with comor-
bid  GAD  in  major  depression  had  modulated  hypo-
activation  in  response  to  an  emotional  task  in  middle 
frontal  regions  and  the  insula,  as  usually  seen  in  pure 
depression; this gives additional support to there being 
different types of emotional information processing in 
anxiety and depression.39
  Resting-state functional connectivity was reported to 
be  lower  in  prefrontal-limbic  and  cingulate  and  higher 
in  prefrontal-hippocampus  regions,  and  both  abnor-
malities were correlated with clinical symptom severity.40 
Also, the amygdala-PFC connectivity underlying worry 
and  rumination  in  GAD  has  recently  been  linked  to 
autonomic dyscontrol, suggesting overlapping neuronal 
substrates  for  cognitive  and  autonomic  dysregulation.41 
Furthermore, amygdala and the middle frontal gyrus ac-
tivation  in  response  to  presentation  of  emotional  faces 
can distinguish patients with GAD and social phobia, in-
dicating  different  neural  circuitry  dysfunctions  in  these 
two highly prevalent anxiety disorders.28 
  Previous research also implicates the ACC in emo-
tion  regulation  through  effects  on  the  amygdala  and 
suggests  that  deficits  in  ACC-amygdala  connectivity 
may  contribute  to  emotion  dysregulation  in  patients 
with  GAD.25  Different  hippocampal  connectivity 
was  observed  between  posttraumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD)  and  GAD  patients,  potentially  explaining  the 
difference  in  fear-related  memory  dysregulation  in 
two  anxiety  phenotypes.42  Increased  activation  of  the 
medial PFC and right ventrolateral PFC, as well as al-
tered connectivity between the amygdala or ventrolat-
eral PFC and regions which subserve mentalization (eg, 
posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial PFC) 
was  observed  in  adolescents  with  GAD.43  In  addition, 
increased  functional  connectivity  between  hippocam-
pus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus was found in 
GAD, whereas greater functional connectivity between 
somatosensory  cortex  and  thalamus  was  observed  in 
panic  disorder,  further  suggesting  these  two  disorders 
have  different  clinical  and  psychopathological  pro-
cesses.44 Finally, decreased functional connectivity was 
found between the left amygdala and left dorsolateral 
PFC  and  increased  right  amygdala  functional  connec-
tivity  with  insula  and  superior  temporal  gyrus  in  ado-
lescents  with  GAD,  confirming  that  they  have  abnor-
malities in brain regions associated with the emotional 
processing pathways.45

  Only  a  few  fMRI  studies  have  measured  changes 
after treatment. The greater pretreatment reactivity to 
fearful faces in rostal ACC (rACC) and lesser reactiv-
ity in the amygdala have predicted a better response to 
8-week treatment with venlafaxine in GAD; however, 
no  differences  between  patients  and  controls  with  re-
gard  to  neuronal  activation  within  these  regions  were 
detected  before  treatment.46  In  addition,  higher  levels 
of  pretreatment  ACC  activity  in  anticipation  of  both 
aversive  and  neutral  pictures  were  associated  with 
greater reductions in anxiety and worry symptoms af-
ter  an  8-week  treatment  with  venlafaxine  in  GAD.47 
This suggests that ACC-amygdala responsiveness could 
prove useful as a predictor of antidepressant treatment 
response in GAD. A significant increase in right ventro-
lateral PFC activation in response to angry faces after 
treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
fluoxetine was reported in small samples of young pa-
tients with GAD.48 Greater anticipatory activity in the 
bilateral  dorsal  amygdala  was  shown  in  GAD,  and  a 
CBT course led to attenuation of amygdalar and sub-
genual  anterior  cingulate  response  to  fearful/angry 
face  presentation,  plus  heightened  insular  activation 
in  response  to  happy  faces.49  However,  the  treatment 
had no apparent effects on increased amygdala-insular 
connectivity, and the changes were not associated with 
symptoms of worry. An interesting study with the ben-
zodiazepine  alprazolam  found  that  neuronal  activa-
tion in the amygdala and insula during emotional tests 
was reduced after acute administration of alprazolam. 
However,  activity  returned  to  baseline  levels  at  week 
4  of  alprazolam  treatment,  indicating  that  the  neural 
mechanisms  supporting  sustained  treatment  effects  of 
benzodiazepines  in  GAD  differ  from  those  underly-
ing  their  acute  effects.50  Significantly  reduced  BOLD 
responses  to  a  pathology-specific  worry  in  prefrontal 
regions,  striatum,  insula,  and  paralimbic  regions  were 
reported after 7 weeks of treatment with citalopram in 
a small sample of patients with GAD.51 

PET and SPECT studies

Despite  the  great  potential  that  radioisotope  studies 
have  to  explore  the  neurochemical  effects  in  live  hu-
man brain, only very few have been conducted in GAD. 
The first PET report in GAD was by Wu et al.52 They 
found lower absolute metabolic rates in basal ganglia, 
but  found  increased  rates  in  the  left  inferior  gyrus, 

Brodmann Area (BA) 17, occipital lobe, right posterior 
temporal lobe, and right precentral frontal gyrus. 
  Unlike  in  MDD  and  other  anxiety  disorders,  in 
GAD,  the  number  of  5-HT  reuptake  sites  available 
in  the  brain  was  unchanged,  as  measured  by  tracers 
such  as  [123I]nor-β-CIT  and  [I]ADAM  53,54  In  contrast, 
dopamine-reuptake-site  density  measured  by  [Tc]
TRODAT-in  the  striatum  was  significantly  lower  in 
the  GAD  patients  than  in  the  healthy  controls.54 Ad-
ditionally, significant decreases in the left temporal pole 
type A γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptors were 
found in a PET study with GAD female patients.55

Metabolic MRI studies

demonstrated  a  higher  N-acetylaspartate/creatine 
(NAA/Cr) ratio in the right dorsolateral PFC in med-
ication-free  patients  with  GAD  than  in  healthy  par-
ticipants.56 The subsequent study reported persistently 
lower levels of bilateral hippocampal NAA/Cr in GAD 
after  a  successful  12-week  treatment  with  paroxetine, 
but  excluded  an  association  between  this  hippocam-
pal  neuronal  marker  and  anxiolytic  response  to  this 
medication.57 Interestingly, a significant increase in hip-
pocampal  NAA  was  observed  in  GAD  responders  to 
the glutamate-release inhibitor riluzole, whereas nonre-
sponders had decreases over 8 weeks of treatment.58 A 
low level of choline/NAA in the dorsolateral PFC was 
observed in GAD patients in another recent study, and 
this negatively correlated with anxiety severity.59

Genetic biomarkers

Increasing efforts are being made to determine genetic 
factors involved in the onset and development of psy-
chiatric  disorders  and  also  those  influencing  their  re-
sponse  to  therapeutic  interventions. Although  several 
approaches have been used in this search, including epi-
demiological  (family  and  twin)  studies  and  molecular 
(linkage and association) methods, the genetic research 
for GAD is still modest compared with research under-
taken for other anxiety or mood disorders. For a com-
prehensive discussion of the genetics of GAD, see also 
the  article  by  Gottschalk  and  Domschke  in  this  issue. 
Earlier meta-analysis of twin studies has estimated the 
heritability of GAD to be 32%,60 but higher heritability 
estimates (49%) and no sex differences, in contrast to

previous reports, were demonstrated by a recent cross-
sectional twin study in Sweden.61 

So far, only a few association studies have been con-
ducted among patients with the GAD phenotype, leav-
ing  us  without  a  consistent  or  clear  conclusion  about 
GAD vulnerability genes. Specifically, genes for mono-
amine oxidase A (MAOA) and solute carrier family 6 
member  4  (SLC6A4)  have  been  implicated  as  poten-
tially involved in the pathogenesis of GAD,62,63 and the 
association of GAD with a 5-hydroxytryptamine recep-
tor  1A  (5-HTR1A)  gene  variation  has  been  shown  to 
be partly mediated by comorbidity with major depres-
sion.64 
  A  recent  study  showed  that  the  Met  allele  of  the 
functional  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF) 
Val66Met polymorphism is associated with GAD risk, 
along  with  an  increase  in  serum  BDNF  levels.65  How-
ever,  Val66Met  variation  was  associated  with  neither 
GAD nor BDNF plasma levels in a Chinese Han popu-
lation with GAD.66 In addition, polymorphisms both in 
regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) and neuro-
peptide Y (NPY) genes have been shown to modify risk 
of post-disaster GAD under conditions of high stressor 
exposure  among  adults  living  in  areas  affected  by  the 
2004  Florida  Hurricanes67,68  and  few  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  proteasome  modulator  9 
(PSMD9)  gene  were  in  linkage  with  GAD  in  Italian 
families with type 2 diabetes.69
  Recently,  the  microarray  study  of  peripheral  gene 
expression signatures has become a powerful and prom-
ising approach in the discovery of novel biomarkers via 
transcriptional and microRNA analysis. For example, a 
microRNA (miRNA) array study performed in periph-
eral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs)  has  revealed 
negative  correlation  between  the  expression  level  of 
miR-4505  and  miR-663  and  anxiety  manifestation  in 
GAD  patients;  however,  the  molecular  mechanism  of 
this association requires further explanation.70 Another 
genome-wide  peripheral  gene  expression  study  in  a 
large sample of patients with GAD found no significant 
differential  expression  in  women;  however,  631  genes, 
most of which were immune-related, were differentially 
expressed between anxious and control men.71 

Some  other  promising  data  have  been  reported  by 
pharmacogenetic  initiatives,  where  the  intensive  search 
for genetic treatment predictors has revealed a few genes, 
including the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating pep-
tide (PACAP), serotonin transporter (5-HTT), the sero-

tonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A), corticotropin-releas-
ing  hormone  receptor  1  (CRHR1),  dopamine  receptor 
D3 (DRD3), nuclear receptor subfamily group C mem-
ber  1  (NR3C1),  and  phosphodiesterase  1A  (PDE1A), 
as potential markers predicting therapeutic response to 
SSRI medication in patients with GAD.72-78 In contrast, 
none  of  the  investigated  polymorphisms  within  dopa-
mine  receptor  D2  (DRD2)  or  dopamine  active  trans-
porter 1 (DAT1) genes showed an impact on venlafaxine 
XR treatment response in GAD.79

Neurochemical biomarkers

Plasma  appears  to  be  a  rational  source  for  proteomic 
and  metabolomic  measurements  because  it  is  eas-
ily  accessible  and  because  several  molecules  from 
the  brain  are  transported  across  the  blood-brain  bar-
rier and reach the circulation. However, drawing infer-
ences  from  the  neurochemical  composition  of  plasma 
on  the  processes  in  the  brain  is  not  straightforward.80 
Moreover, only a few studies have been conducted on 
plasma-based  pathogenetic  and/or  treatment  predic-
tors  in  GAD,  indicating  the  further  need  to  explore 
such potentially valuable approaches. So far, the stud-
ies  measuring  5-hydroxytryptamine  (5-HT,  also  called 
serotonin)-related  biomarkers  have  found  decreased 
platelet 5-HT-reuptake-site binding in GAD patients,81 
but  unchanged  5-HT  binding  in  lymphocytes  as  com-
pared with controls.82 Moreover, GAD patients showed 
concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
(5-HIAA) in platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma, as 
well as in lymphocytes, within the normal range.82 
  Unlike  for  other  anxiety  disorders,  particularly 
PTSD, it seems that GAD is not characterized by con-
sistent evidence of possible abnormalities in the regu-
lation  of  HPA-axis  activity.  Male  patients  with  GAD 
displayed similar cortisol plasma levels after a stressful 
test.83 A greater cortisol awakening response has been 
reported only for those GAD patients who had comor-
bid  MDD.84 The  large  studies  performed  among  4256 
Vietnam-era  veterans  showed  similar  cortisol  and  de-
hydroepiandrosterone  sufate  (DHEAS)  plasma  levels 
and  cortisol/DHEAS  ratios  between  GAD  sufferers 
and normal controls.85 
  Another  approach  is  to  use  challenge  tests  to  pro-
voke anxiety/stress. In one, administration of 7.5% car-
bon dioxide did not significantly change salivary corti-
sol levels in medication-free GAD patients.86 Moreover, 

153

 
 
T r a n s l a t i o n a l   r e s e a r c h

no  difference  in  pre-sleep  salivary  cortisol  level  was 
found among children with GAD, despite the presence 
of sleep disturbances.87 On the other hand, both higher 
and lower cortisol awakening responses were observed 
among  elderly  GAD  patients  than  with  nonanxious 
controls, positively associated with symptomatic sever-
ity in one study88 and irrespective of the duration of ill-
ness in another one.89 Furthermore, both untreated and 
venlafaxine-treated  GAD  patients  demonstrated  sig-
nificantly higher cortisol levels than normal controls in 
a clonidine-challenge study.90 Nevertheless, some stud-
ies  reported  a  significant  reduction  in  post-treatment 
cortisol  levels  after  successful  psychological  or  phar-
macological treatment of GAD. For example, elevated 
plasma cortisol levels decreased after successful CBT,91 
and greater reductions in both peak and total salivary 
cortisol were shown in elderly GAD patients after esci-
talopram  treatment  than  in  placebo-treated  patients.92 
However, no association was reported between a posi-
tive therapeutic outcome to buspirone93 or alprazolam94 
and post-treatment cortisol levels in GAD. 
  Although  a  strong  link  between  neurotrophic  fac-
tors and mood disorders is well established, it seems that 
this relationship in GAD is not so obvious or may have 
the opposite effect.80 No changes in BDNF levels were 
found in a sufficiently large sample of patients with dif-
ferent  anxiety  disorders,  including  GAD.95  However,  a 
small study comparing patients with GAD or MDD with 
healthy subjects showed doubled plasma levels of BDNF 
and artemin, a glial-cell-line–derived neurotrophic factor 
family member, in GAD patients compared with normal 
controls,  whereas  depressed  patients  showed  a  reduc-
tion.96 The baseline plasma BDNF levels were not associ-
ated with GAD severity; however, a significantly greater 
mean  increase  in  plasma  BDNF  level  was  observed  in 
duloxetine-treated  patients  than  in  those  who  had  re-
ceived placebo.97 Interestingly, an increased plasma con-
centration of nerve growth factor was observed among 
GAD patients after successful CBT.98 
  Finally,  among  immunological  factors,  C-reactive 
protein (CRP) was found to be elevated in some stud-
ies.99,100 A pilot study that measured peripheral levels of 

cytokines in small cohorts of GAD and MDD patients 
has demonstrated an increase in plasma concentrations 
of  interleukin  (IL)-10  and  α-melanocyte-stimulating 
hormone (α-MSH), but no significant variations in IL-
2.101  Earlier,  a  study  in  patients  with  GAD  and  panic 
disorder with agoraphobia measured cell-mediated im-
mune  functions  through  the  lymphocyte  proliferative 
response to phytohemagglutinin, IL-2 production, and 
natural killer cell activity and suggested a reduction in 
this function when compared with healthy controls.102

Conclusion

GAD is still something of an orphan disorder in terms 
of known biomarkers, as well as in the diagnosis of anxi-
ety disorders. To some extent, this is due to the marked 
and common overlap of GAD with major depression; 
also, because the severity of the illness’ impact on the 
activities  of  the  patients  is  often  overlooked,  research 
funds are limited. However, as this review shows, there 
are meaningful differences in the biology of GAD and 
depression that not only help confirm that these are in-
deed separate diseases but that they may in some cases 
be  polar  opposites.  This  may  help  explain  the  well-
established  phenomenon  that  GAD  often  precedes 
depression, and the emergence of depression may rep-
resent a failure of the compensatory activities that the 
body mounts to protect itself against the chronic stress 
imposed by GAD. Such differences have significant im-
plications for improving diagnosis and thus enhance the 
understanding and treatment of GAD as a different ill-
ness  from  its  better-recognized  cousins,  such  as  panic 
disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Also, new 
biological insights have major implications for develop-
ing  new  treatments. These  are  sorely  needed,  as  there 
has been no major advance in the treatment of GAD 
for many years, and thus, patients continue to suffer. If 
we could better target the few treatments we have on 
the basis of biomarkers, then we could at least work to 
optimize patient response to medication. q

Marcadores biológicos del trastorno de ansiedad 
generalizada 

Les marqueurs biologiques de l’anxiété généralisée

El trastorno de ansiedad generalizada (TAG) es una con-
dición de salud mental prevalente y muy discapacitante; 
sin embargo, aún hay mucho que aprender en relación 
con biomarcadores específicos, como también respecto 
del diagnóstico, lo que se dificulta más por la sobrepo-
sición  marcada  y  frecuente  del  TAG  con  los  trastornos 
afectivos y de ansiedad. Recientemente, el TAG ha sido 
objeto de grandes esfuerzos de investigación, median-
te  la  aplicación  de  neuroimágenes,  estudios  genéticos 
y exámenes sanguíneos enfocados en el descubrimien-
to de biomarcadores relacionados con la patogenética 
y  el  tratamiento.  Este  artículo  revisa  la  gran  cantidad 
de información disponible y se enfoca especialmente en 
la evidencia que proviene de los resultados de las neu-
roimágenes, la genética y las mediciones neuroquímicas 
en el TAG, con el objetivo de tener una mejor compren-
sión  de  los  potenciales  biomarcadores  involucrados  en 
su  etiología  y  terapéutica.  En  general,  la  mayoría  de 
estos estudios ha entregado resultados que constituyen 
hallazgos aislados, algunas veces inconsistentes y no cla-
ramente replicables. Por estas razones, estos resultados 
aún no se han traducido en la práctica clínica. Por con-
siguiente,  se  necesitan  más  esfuerzos  de  investigación 
para  distinguir  el  TAG  de  otros  trastornos  mentales  y 
contar con nuevos hallazgos biológicos para su patoge-
nia y tratamiento.      

L’anxiété généralisée (AG) est un trouble de santé men-
tale  prévalent  et  très  invalidant.  Il  reste  cependant 
beaucoup à apprendre sur des biomarqueurs pertinents 
ainsi  que  sur  le  diagnostic,  rendu  plus  difficile  par  le 
chevauchement  important  et  courant  de  l’AG  avec  les 
troubles  affectifs  et  anxieux.  Récemment,  l’AG  a  fait 
l’objet  d’efforts  intenses  de  recherche,  appliquant  la 
neuro-imagerie, la génétique et les analyses sanguines 
à la découverte de biomarqueurs pathogènes et liés au 
traitement. Dans cet article, nous analysons l’important 
volume  de  données  disponibles  et  nous  nous  concen-
trons en particulier sur des données de neuro-imagerie, 
de génétique et des mesures neurochimiques dans l’AG, 
afin de mieux comprendre les biomarqueurs potentiels 
impliqués  dans  son  étiologie  et  son  traitement.  Glo-
balement,  la  majorité  de  ces  études  sort  des  résultats 
isolés,  parfois  contradictoires  et  non  clairement  repro-
ductibles. C’est pourquoi ils n’ont toujours pas été trans-
posés en pratique clinique. Il faut donc d’autres efforts 
de recherche pour différentier l’AG des autres troubles 
mentaux et permettre de nouvelles découvertes biolo-
giques dans sa pathogenèse et son traitement.
