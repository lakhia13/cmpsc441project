Abstract

Objective

This systematic review examined the effectiveness of Emergency Department-based and
initiated youth suicide prevention interventions for suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, hospi-
talization, family system functioning, and other mental health symptoms.

Methods

We searched five databases for randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that examined
Emergency Department-based and initiated suicide prevention interventions among youth
aged 10 to 18 years old between May 2020 to June 2022. Using Cohen’s d and 95% confi-
dence interval as our standardised metrics, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis in
Systematic Reviews (SWiM) guidelines when synthesizing, interpreting, and reporting the
findings of this review.

Results

Five studies were included in this review. Findings were first synthesized according to the
targeted population of the study intervention and this review’s outcomes. Two interventions
were effective for decreasing depressive symptoms, hospitalization recidivism, and/or
increasing family empowerment. There were no interventions that reduced subsequent sui-
cide attempts. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to the heterogeneity of the data.

Conclusion

A need exists to develop and evaluate Emergency Department-based and initiated youth
suicide prevention interventions that can be successfully and sustainably implemented in
practice. Future research should focus on evaluating the components of interventions that
effectively mitigate suicide risk among high-risk youth.

1. Introduction

Suicide is the leading cause of non-accidental death for youth between 10 to 18 years of age in
North America [1, 2]. Marked increases in Emergency Department visits by youth experienc-
ing suicidal ideation or following a suicide attempt [3] have been documented between 2007 to
2015 [4–6] with estimated annual visits having increased significantly in the United States
(US) from 58,0000 to 1.12 million [6], without a significant change in total Emergency Depart-
ment visits during this time [4]. This increase is consistent with earlier National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) analyses which reported a two-fold increase in
Emergency Department visits by youth for suicide-related behaviors between 1993 to 2008 [7].
While further data are needed to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact
for suicide-related behaviors and ideation among youth since 2020, emerging evidence sug-
gests that the pandemic response and related psychosocial disruptions may have contributed
to increasing mental health concerns for this population [8–10], particularly among gender
minoritized youth [11]. Following the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in 2020, US Emer-
gency Departments saw an increase in youth presentations for suicide-related concerns, espe-
cially among youth who did not have a prior mental health diagnosis [8, 10]. An overall
increase of death by suicide was also observed in the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pan-
demic, disproportionately among young, males, and/or who belong to an ethnic or racial min-
oritzed group [12]. Data suggest that youth who are discharged from the Emergency
Department following a suicide attempt are most at risk to re-attempt suicide within three
months and that the risk of mortality on re-attempt is approximately 10-fold higher when
compared to that of their peers who did not have a prior attempt [13]. Together, these analyses
provide evidence of an alarming acceleration in pediatric presentations to the Emergency
Department for suicide-related concerns [4, 7]; thus, requiring further attention to the unique
needs of youth presenting to the Emergency Department with these presentations.

Given the clinically significant increase in youth Emergency Department presentations for

suicide-related concerns, it is essential that effective prevention interventions be identified,
developed, and implemented within this context. Clinicians and researchers have generated a
call to action for evidence-informed guidelines to reduce suicide risk and prevent death by sui-
cide [14]; however, few empirically validated interventions across settings have been shown to
reduce suicide-related behaviors and suicidal ideation among youth [14–17]. Even fewer stud-
ies have specifically addressed the intervention needs of acutely suicidal youth presenting to
the Emergency Department, with only one systematic review published in 2010 [18] and one
rapid review published in 2022 [19] reporting on this to date. The systematic review conducted
by Newton et al. (2010) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Emergency Department-initiated
interventions among pediatric patients presenting with suicide concerns [18], while the rapid
review conducted by Virk et al. (2022) narrowed the scope of their research to evaluate brief
interventions delivered in pediatric Emergency Departments for managing suicidal ideation
[19]. This current systematic review provides an updated synthesis of current knowledge on

Emergency Department-based and initiated youth suicide prevention interventions and their
effects on our primary outcome, suicide-related behaviors, as well as our secondary outcomes,
suicidal ideation, other mental health symptoms, hospitalization, and family functioning.

2. Methods

A systematic review of randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that examined Emergency
Department-based or Emergency Department-initiated youth suicide prevention interven-
tions was conducted. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181270) and fol-
lowed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
[20] and Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis in Systematic Reviews (SWiM) [15] guidelines. We
used the SWiM guidelines for reporting findings of this systematic review that did not meet
criteria for meta-analysis [21].

2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria

The primary author (RB) systematically searched for published peer-reviewed studies in MED-
LINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL. In consultation with a health sciences
librarian at the University of Toronto, the search strategy (S1 Appendix) was created to search
for published studies with the following inclusion criteria: (1) RCT study design that random-
ized study participants to receive an Emergency Department-based or initiated suicide preven-
tion intervention, enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU), or treatment-as-usual (TAU) (as
defined by each individual study); (2) contained a suicide prevention intervention delivered or
initiated in an Emergency Department setting (pediatric, adult, and/or general Emergency
Department); (3) enrolled participants between 10 to 18 years of age; (4) reported on partici-
pants presenting to an Emergency Department for suicide-related behaviors and/or suicidal
ideation or who presented to an Emergency Department for non-psychiatric-related reasons
and screened positively for suicide-related behaviors and/or suicidal ideation; and (5) was
available in French or English. Studies which included participants outside the set age limits,
and that met all other eligibility criteria, were included if the mean age of the study participants
was within the included age range. Studies that combined recruitment sources such that the
Emergency Department was one of several other, non-acute, potential points of recruitment,
and presented aggregated study results (i.e., did not present results of participants recruited
from the Emergency Department separately from those that were recruited from a different
study site) were not included in this review. We did not restrict study searching or eligibility
by year of publication. The initial study searching was conducted between February to May,
2020. An updated search was conducted on May 27th, 2022.

2.2 Selection process

Articles extracted from the searched databases were uploaded into Covidence [22]. Two inde-
pendent reviewers (RB;SL) screened titles and abstracts of extracted articles, with discrepancies
resolved by consensus. Reviewers achieved a 97% inter-rater agreement for the initial search
and a 94% inter-rater agreement for the updated search after screening titles and abstracts.
Full text review occurred in the same manner. Reviewers achieved a 93% inter-rater agreement
for the initial search and a 97% inter-rater agreement for the updated search after full text
screening. Decisions made throughout the screening process were tracked and logged. The
selection process for the initial search occurred from May to June, 2020, and between May to
June, 2022 for the updated search.

2.3 Data extraction and analysis

Full text screening and extraction occurred for the initial search from June to July 2020, and in
June of 2022 for the updated search. An Excel spreadsheet was used to manage and track infor-
mation from extracted articles. To synthesize the findings, we first grouped the studies accord-
ing to the population for which the study’s intervention was intended (i.e., youth-targeted
versus family-targeted). We then grouped the studies’ outcomes according to the primary and
secondary outcomes of this review. When extracting data, we defined suicide-related behaviors
as a person’s intentional actions that may cause death [23]. These included, but were not lim-
ited to, a suicide attempt (i.e., self-injurious behaviors in the presence of any level of intent to
die) and deliberate self-harm (i.e., self-injurious behaviors such as a suicide attempt and non-
suicidal self-injury) [23]. We defined suicidal ideation as either passive (i.e., thoughts about
death or of not being able to carry on) during which a person does not consider ending their
own life, nor intends to attempt suicide, or active (i.e., thoughts about ending one own’s life)
during which the person considers acting to end their life [23]. Data extraction for other men-
tal health symptoms was individual to each study and included results relating to depression
or depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and substance use. Extracted data relating to hospitali-
zation focused on results pertaining to hospitalization recidivism. Finally, given that the popu-
lation of interest are pediatric patients, we extracted data on family functioning from studies
that measured the effects of the suicide prevention intervention on family systems.

Using an effect size calculator, we calculated the Cohen’s d and 95% confidence interval for

study outcomes, where possible, as our standardised metrics [21] to determine differences in
intervention outcomes between the intervention and control groups post-intervention and to
evaluate the effectiveness of the suicide prevention intervention on the outcome.

2.4 Risk-of-bias appraisal

Two independent reviewers (RB;SL) assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies
based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook [24]. The reviewers
assessed the following factors for each article included in this review: (1) presence of bias aris-
ing from the randomization process (generation of the allocation sequence, adequate conceal-
ment, or baseline group differences suggesting a problem with the randomization process); (2)
presence of bias due to a lack of, or problems with, blinding; (3) information regarding missing
outcome data; (4) concerns regarding the assessment and measurement of outcomes; and (5)
reporting of results in accordance with initial analytical plan. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Com-
parison tool was used in Covidence to assign a level of risk of bias judgement (low risk,
unclear, or high risk) [24] by both reviewers. The reviewers met to discuss and resolve
discrepancies.

3. Results
3.1 Studies identified

The database search yielded 3579 titles and abstracts after duplicates (n = 1352) were removed.
This yielded 146 potentially relevant articles for full text screening. Of these, five met inclusion
criteria and were included in the final review (Fig 1). Excluded full text articles can be found in
S1 Table. The study sample sizes ranged from 49 to 245 (23 to 112 in the intervention group;
26 to 133 in the control group). Two studies trialed an Emergency Department-based or initi-
ated youth suicide prevention intervention among youth participants only [25, 26], while three
studies trialed an intervention aimed at youth and their families [15, 27, 28].

All studies were conducted in the United States. Study characteristics are presented in
Table 1. A meta-analysis of the extracted data was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the
study participants’ clinical presentations and chief complaints, the intervention modalities, the
outcomes that were assessed, and the outcome measures. A summary of the interventions’
effect size by outcome can be found in Table 2.

Of the two youth targeted trials, one study examined the effect of communication about the
type of follow-up that the youth would receive on their response to a self-reported suicide risk
screen (primary outcome) [25]. The authors hypothesized that informing youth of greater in-
person staff follow-up prior to them completing the self-report measures would be associated
with lower levels of self-reported suicide risk factors [25]. Youth randomized to the interven-
tion group (n = 112) participated in a 20-minute in-person follow-up session with a trained
research staff, and youth randomized to the control group (n = 133) received treatment-as-
usual (TAU) with no in-person follow-up [25]. The second youth targeted trial examined the
effectiveness of the Teen Options for Change (TOC) intervention among youth seeking non-
psychiatric care in the Emergency Department, but who screened positively for suicide risk
[26]. Youth participants randomized to the intervention group (n = 23) participated in a 35- to
45-minute adapted motivational interview with a mental health professional, while youth in
the control group (n = 26) received enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU) which was enhanced

with a crisis card for suicidal emergencies and written information about depression, suicide
risk, firearm safety, and local mental health services [26].

Of the three studies that trialed an Emergency Department-based or initiated youth suicide
prevention intervention aimed at youth and their families, the study that evaluated the Family
Intervention for Suicide Prevention (FISP) intervention had youth in the intervention group
(n = 89) complete a brief youth and family crisis therapy session in the Emergency Department
[15]. Family support was strengthened by encouraging youth and parents to identify positive
attributes about themselves and each other [15]. Structured telephone contacts for motivating
and supporting outpatient treatment attendance were made within the first 48 hours after dis-
charge from the Emergency Department and at one, two, and four weeks post-discharge [15].
Participants randomized to the control group (n = 92) received ETAU which was enhanced by
training sessions for Emergency Department staff [15].

A second study examined whether a motivational interviewing–based intervention
(STAT-ED) increased linkages to outpatient mental health services and reduced depressive
and suicide-related symptoms [27]. Youth were invited to participate if they screened posi-
tively for suicide risk while presenting to the Emergency Department for non-psychiatric-
related concerns [27]. Participants randomized to the intervention group (n = 80) completed a
brief motivational interview targeting mental health care-seeking behaviors and referrals [27].
STAT-ED participants also received case management via telephone call follow-ups to speak
about problems for linkages to outpatient mental health treatment [27]. Participants random-
ized to the control group (n = 79) received ETAU which was enhanced by a brief mental health
consultation and referral [27]. Finally, a third study reported efficacy outcomes of a Family
Based Crisis Intervention (FBCI) for suicidal youth and their families [28]. Participants ran-
domized to the intervention group (n = 68) completed a 60- to 90-minute session with a clini-
cian in which a joint crisis narrative of the problem was created by the youth and parent [28].
Participants randomized to the control group (n = 71) received TAU [28].

3.2 Suicide attempt

Two studies assessed subsequent suicide attempts following a family-based suicide prevention
intervention [15, 27]. Neither study’s intervention demonstrated a statistically significant
decrease in reported suicide attempts. The STAT-ED study examined whether a motivational
interviewing–based intervention increased linkages to outpatient mental health services and
reduced depressive and suicide-related symptoms [27]. Following the family-based STAT-ED
intervention, three (5.30%) youth in the intervention group (n = 80) and one (2%) youth in
the control group (n = 79) reported having attempted suicide (p = 0.62) [27].

The second study evaluated the Family Intervention for Suicide Prevention (FISP) interven-
tion for preventing suicide among youth [15]. Similarly to the STAT-ED intervention, follow-
ing the FISP intervention, four youth (6%) from the intervention group (n = 89) and five (6%)
youth from the control group (n = 92) reported having attempted suicide; one youth had died
by suicide, although the group in which this youth was assigned was not reported [15].

3.3 Suicidal ideation

Four studies assessed suicidal ideation among youth [25–28]. None of these studies’ interven-
tions resulted in a statistically significant decrease in suicidal ideation. A study that examined
the effectiveness of the Teen Options for Change (TOC) intervention among youth seeking
non-psychiatric care in the Emergency Department, but who screened positively for suicide
risk, identified a non-statistically significant but clinically relevant effect for reducing suicidal
ideation following the TOC intervention (d = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.74–0.42) (p = 0.58) [26].

PLOS ONEEffectiveness of Emergency Department-Based and Initiated Youth Suicide Prevention Interventions

However, this positive effect cannot be definitively attributed to the intervention because there
was also a statistically significant effect across groups over time (p<0.01) demonstrating an
overall decrease in youths’ suicidal ideation over the study period [26].

A statistically significant decrease in suicidal ideation across groups over time was also
observed in two of the other included studies, including the STAT-ED study [27] and the Fam-
ily Based Crisis Intervention (FBCI) study [28], a family-based intervention that reported sui-
cide-related efficacy outcomes for suicidal youth.

3.4 Hospitalization recidivism

Only one study assessed hospitalization recidivism following the FBCI intervention [28]. This
study found that patients randomized to the FBCI intervention were significantly more likely
to be discharged home from the Emergency Department and reported significantly less hospi-
talization recidivism [28]. In this study, 26 (38%) youth who received the intervention and 48
(68%) youth in the control group were hospitalized at follow-up (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.7–6.8;
p<0.005), indicating a statistically significant association with decreased hospitalization recidi-
vism among youth who received the FCBI intervention [28]. This study used a self-reported
questionnaire in which youths’ parents were asked: “Since your initial visit to the ED, has your
child required another crisis evaluation?”; and “Since your initial visit to the ED, has your
child been psychiatrically hospitalized again?” [28].

3.5 Other mental health-related concerns

Four studies reported on the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions on other mental
health-related concerns [15, 25–27], including depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and alcohol
misuse.

3.5.1 Depression. Four studies reported on depression or depressive symptoms [15, 25–
27], although measurement tools varied, thereby contributing to the heterogeneity of the data.
Two studies used the short form Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, 2nd Edition (RADS-2)
[25, 26], whereas the other two studies used the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depres-
sion (CES-D) scale [15, 27]. Only the TOC intervention study demonstrated a significant effect
for decreasing depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up among the intervention group
(d = 1.07), as well as a significant time*intervention group interaction (p<0.01) [26]. Notably,
two family-based interventions reported significant improvements in depressive symptoms
across groups and over time [27, 28].

3.5.2 Hopelessness. Only one study assessed hopelessness among youth using the Beck
Hopelessness Scale at baseline and following the TOC intervention [26]. The results of this
study did not demonstrate a significant intervention or group effect for this outcome
(d = 0.40) [26].

3.5.3 Alcohol misuse. Two studies assessed alcohol use, both using the Alcohol Use Dis-

orders Identification Test–Concise (AUDIT-C) measurement tool [25, 26]. Both studies,
which included an RCT examining the effect of communication about the type of follow-up
that the youth would receive on their response to a self-reported suicide risk screen [25] and
the TOC intervention [26], reported non-statistically significant intervention effects for alco-
hol misuse among youth who received a youth-targeted suicide prevention intervention. Nei-
ther study reported a decrease in alcohol misuse across groups over time [25, 26].

3.6 Family system functioning

Two studies assessed family system functioning among youth and their families following a
family-based intervention [15, 28]. Different measurement scales were used in each study–the

PLOS ONEEffectiveness of Emergency Department-Based and Initiated Youth Suicide Prevention Interventions

Family Empowerment Scale [28] and the Conflict Behaviours Questionnaire [15]–which con-
tributed to the heterogeneity of the data. Following the FBCI intervention, the intervention
group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in family empowerment (p<0.01) [28].
Higher scores for family empowerment were also found following the FISP intervention, where
family support was strengthened by encouraging youth and parents to identify positive attri-
butes about themselves and each other; however, they were not statistically significant [15].

3.7 Risk-of-bias quality appraisal

As illustrated in Fig 2, four studies had low overall RoB [15, 25–27], although two were
missing information regarding the blinding of personnel [26, 27] and one was missing
information regarding outcome data [25]. The other study had high RoB identified for allo-
cation concealment [28].

4. Discussion

This systematic review presents data synthesizing Emergency Department-based or intitiated
youth suicide prevention interventions and their effects on suicide-related behaviors, suicidal
ideation, other mental health symptoms, hospitalization, and family functioning. All RCT
studies exploring youth suicide prevention interventions implemented or initiated in the
Emergency Department are from the United States, demonstrating a need for global health
research that investigates youth suicide prevention in the Emergency Department context
across health systems and cultures [15, 25–28]. The results of the five studies included in this
review suggest that Emergency Department-based or intiatiated youth suicide prevention
interventions that have been studied to date have not demonstrated an effect on suicide
attempts or other mental health symptoms, with the possible exception of depression [15, 25–
28]. Importantly, however, studies have had small sample sizes; only two studies (Teen Options
for Change (TOC) and Family Intervention for Suicide Prevention (FISP)) reported statistical
significance between the intervention and control group outcomes [15, 27]. The youth-tar-
geted intervention, TOC, found a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms fol-
lowing an adapted motivational interview, a co-created action plan, and a telephone follow-up
for the youth following discharge from the Emergency Department [26]. Despite the intercon-
nectedness of suicidality with depression, the TOC intervention was not effective for decreas-
ing the frequency of suicidal ideation solely among intervention group participants and did
not measure subsequent suicide attempts [26].

Similarly, other studies measuring suicidal ideation found a decrease in frequency across
groups and over time [25–28]. It is therefore unknown if the intervention groups’ decrease in
suicidal ideation is attributable to the study interventions alone. Furthermore, the TOC inter-
vention was not effective for decreasing alcohol misuse, which is an important indicator for
suicide risk [26] when measured in tandem with depressive symptoms. Importantly, the RCT
study investigating the effects of communication of staff follow-up on youth’s self-reported
suicidal ideation found that youth who are of lower socioeconomic status may be more reluc-
tant to disclose distress or to share information about behavioral problems due to fear, stigma,
and social desirability; thus, creating greater barriers for this already vulnerable population to
be effectively screened for suicide risk and receive treatment [25].

The Family Based Crisis Intervention (FBCI) was more effective for decreasing subsequent
hospitalizations and increasing family empowerment when compared to TAU; however, par-
ticipants in the intervention group for this study reported greater family empowerment at
baseline as well as at follow-up, compared to those in the control group [28]. Further, this
study scored high for allocation concealment RoB based on research team members and

Emergency Department psychiatrists’ knowledge of the randomization of participants with
whom they intervened before and during the study intervention [28]. It is unknown how this
may have affected the relational dynamics during the FBCI intervention. Nevertheless, family
system functioning has increasingly become a critical component for youth suicide prevention
interventions [29–31]. Given that pediatric Emergency Departments commonly practice using
the family-centered model of care [32], in which patients and their families are integral mem-
bers of the healthcare team, family-targeted suicide prevention interventions should be consid-
ered for this context.

No interventions were found to have a significant effect on decreasing suicide attempts

among youth [15, 27]. Several parents of youth who received the STAT-ED intervention
reported difficulty initiating follow-up appointments within the recommended two-month
timeframe due to logistic and scheduling barriers, such as long waitlists [27]. Although Emer-
gency Department-based and initiated interventions were found to significantly increase link-
ages to follow-up care in two of the included studies, the community-based interventions also
did not demonstrate a significant effect on suicidality or other mental health-related concerns
[15, 27]. This suggests that linking Emergency Department patients to existing outpatient
treatment is insufficient for decreasing suicide risk. Instead, further research is urgently
needed to develop novel, effective interventions that address this important gap in clinical
practice.

Many of the interventions in the included studies were based on and/or applied validated
tools to screen for and measure suicide risk (e.g., suicidal ideation, previous suicide attempts,
depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse). While these tools have reached a high level of accept-
ability for clinical practice and research, there is limited research exploring the experiences
and perspectives of youth and their families who have engaged with these instruments. A
United States-based study that examined youths’ experiences of Emergency Department care
following a suicide attempt and the meaning that youth attribute to suicidality found that feel-
ings of ambiguity and “flooding” of thoughts are barriers to answering the types of closed-

PLOS ONEEffectiveness of Emergency Department-Based and Initiated Youth Suicide Prevention Interventions

ended questions commonly used in screening and risk-related instruments [33]. It is, there-
fore, possible that this phenomenon may have affected how participants responded to both the
baseline and follow-up assessments in the included studies. A qualitative evaluation of RCT
studies investigating youth suicide prevention interventions could contribute to understand-
ing why these interventions were not more effective despite having robust theoretical
foundations.

5. Implications and contributions

The only commonality among the interventions that had significant effects for decreasing
either depressive symptoms, hospitalization recidivism, and/or increasing family empower-
ment is telephone follow-up(s) with the youth and/or their family, following discharge from
the Emergency Department [26, 28]. The TOC intervention telephone follow-ups aimed to
support and facilitate implementation of the youth’s action plan [26], whereas telephone fol-
low-ups for the FBCI were conducted to assess the youth’s adherence to follow-up treatment
recommendations [28]. Although the specific aims of each study intervention’s follow-up var-
ied, the overarching premise was to support youth in completing post-Emergency Department
discharge treatment plans and recommendations to address their suicide-related risks on an
outpatient and ongoing basis. These findings indicate that post-Emergency Department dis-
charge follow-ups may be an important factor for sustained decreases in depressive symptoms
and hospitalizations over time, as well as for increasing family empowerment; an important
protective factor against youth suicide [26, 28].

Given the variance in the aims of telephone follow-ups among the study interventions

included in this review, further research is required to understand which elements of telephone
follow-ups lead to effective outcomes. It is possible that decreased hospitalization occurred for
youth receiving the FBCI intervention because of the sustained family empowerment that
allowed parents of suicidal youth to feel confident managing suicide-related concerns at home
or using outpatient support.

With all included studies having been conducted in the United States, there is a need for
research that investigates Emergency Department-based or initiated youth suicide prevention
interventions in other countries and using a critical global health lens. Further, we recommend
that future RCT studies give careful consideration to the primary outcome of the study. In this
review, we have found that depression or depressive symptoms as well as family system func-
tioning may be more modifiable outcomes, while suicide-related behaviours may be too distal
from the study intervention. Lastly, we recommend robust youth engagement in study design
and evaluation for future RCTs to ethically collaborate with and learn from the population
who will receive the intervention.

6. Limitations

An important limitation of this review is that a meta-analysis could not be conducted due to
the heterogeneity of the data. This is, in part, because of the selected inclusion and exclusion
criteria which allowed for variance among study populations; youth presentations and chief
complaints in the Emergency Department; and study interventions. Furthermore, this review
only included studies with youth participants who were between 10 to 18 years of age. While
the included population aligned with the scope of our systematic review, given recent evidence
demonstrating that 43.1% of Emergency Department visits for suicidal ideation or following a
suicide attempt in the United States were among children aged 5 to younger than 11 years of
age [4], future reviews should aim to widen the age range to include this population. Although
this updated review yielded only five articles, it is encouraging that 57 ongoing RCT studies

are investigating youth suicide prevention interventions (S1 Table), representing an optimistic
outlook for clinical practice and youths’ outcomes.

7. Conclusion

These results demonstrate that despite an urgent need for clinical guidelines that can address
the rapidly increasing number of Emergency Department presentations for suicide-related
concerns among youth, there is currently insufficient evidence of effectiveness of interventions
upon which clinical guidelines can be made with confidence. As such, this area of clinical care
remains in evolution. The RCT studies included in this review have trialed novel youth-tar-
geted and family-targeted Emergency Department-based or initiated youth suicide prevention
interventions with some demonstrating significantly improved outcomes for either decreasing
depressive symptoms, hospitalization recidivism, and/or increasing family empowerment [26,
28]. None of the included studies, however, were effective in reducing suicidal ideation or sui-
cide attempts with statistical significance. Further research is needed that is focused on
improving suicidality, including related risk factors, as an important outcome among this pop-
ulation within the context of the Emergency Department.
