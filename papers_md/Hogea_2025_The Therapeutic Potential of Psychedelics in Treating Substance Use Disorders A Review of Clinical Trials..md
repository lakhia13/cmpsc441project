Abstract: Background and Objectives: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions world-
wide. Despite increasing drug use, treatment options remain limited. Psychedelic-assisted
therapy (PAT), integrating psychedelic substances with psychotherapy, offers a promising
alternative by addressing underlying neural mechanisms. Materials and Methods: This
review’s purpose is to investigate the current understanding of psychedelic therapy for
treating SUDs, including tobacco, alcohol, and drug addiction. The systematic review
approach focused on clinical trials and randomized controlled trials conducted from 2013 to
2023. The search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Consensus AI, follow-
ing PRISMA guidelines. Studies involving psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, ibogaine, and
ayahuasca for treating various addictions were included, excluding naturalistic studies and
reviews. Results: Our results highlight the key findings from 16 clinical trials investigating
psychedelic therapy for SUDs. Psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca showed promise
in reducing alcohol and tobacco dependence, with psilocybin being particularly effective in
decreasing cravings and promoting long-term abstinence. The studies revealed significant
improvements in substance use reduction, especially when combined with psychotherapy.
However, the variability in dosages and study design calls for more standardized ap-
proaches. These findings emphasize the potential of psychedelics in SUD treatment, though
further large-scale research is needed to validate these results and develop consistent
protocols. Conclusions: This research reviewed the past decade’s international experience,
emphasizing the growing potential of psychedelic therapy in treating SUDs pertaining to
alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine dependence. Psychedelics such as psilocybin and ketamine
can reduce cravings and promote psychological well-being, especially when combined with
psychotherapy. However, regulatory barriers and specialized clinical training are necessary
to integrate these therapies into mainstream addiction treatment safely. Psychedelics offer
a promising alternative for those unresponsive to conventional methods.

1. Introduction

Addiction, or substance use disorder (SUD), is a global public health interest that
affects millions of people every day around the world [1]. Symptoms of SUDs may in-
clude compulsive consumption, failed efforts to quit using, cravings, social and work-life
problems, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms [2].

The most recent data from 2022 showed that the global drug user population has
risen to 292 million, marking a 20% increase in the past decade. Cannabis is still the most
popular drug worldwide, with 228 million users. It is followed by opioids with 60 million
users, amphetamines with 30 million users, cocaine with 23 million users, and ecstasy
with 20 million users [3]. Also, approximately a quarter of the European adult population
smokes, and 8.4% consume alcohol daily, according to a report from 2019 [4,5].

Research indicates that psychedelics can be particularly effective in treating conditions
like treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Johnson
et al. emphasize the need to understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and related
compounds, which can lead to long-lasting positive changes in mood and well-being,
especially in individuals who have not responded to conventional treatments [6].

Addiction is a chronic disease in which substances are used to increase dopamine
levels in various regions of the brain, affecting the brain’s reward circuit. The repeated
stimulation of dopamine acts as a positive incentive for drug use and reward. With chronic
use, the release of dopamine induced by substances diminishes and reduces the need for
reward, resulting in tolerance and the necessity for higher doses to achieve the same level
of satisfaction [1,7].

Although drug consumption has risen, treatment access is still limited; only one
in eight individuals with SUD receive treatment [8]. The efficacy of treatment relies on
a blend of medication and psychotherapy. The primary pharmacological approaches
for managing SUD focus on curbing cravings for drugs, reducing or preventing drug
tolerance, and alleviating or eliminating the harsh symptoms associated with withdrawal.
Substitution therapy might also be employed as an effective risk-reduction method. The
available drugs include antagonists or receptor agonists and medications targeting different
pharmacological aspects, like enzymes that break down the substance ingested [9,10].

The use of natural substances for their mind-altering properties dates back to ancient
times in human history. Records exist of cannabis, various other plants, and hallucinogenic
mushrooms being used thousands of years ago. These substances often played a role in the
sacred ceremonies of indigenous cultures [11].

We continue to divide psychedelics into two main groups: classic and non-classic. Clas-
sic psychedelics are typically agonists of serotonergic receptors: lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, and mescaline [1,12,13].

Non-classic psychedelics are substances that interact with various pharmacological
targets. For instance, ketamine serves as an antagonist to the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor;
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) functions as both a reuptake inhibitor and
releaser for serotonin and dopamine; ibogaine is an indole alkaloid that affects multiple
molecular targets; salvinorin A activates the kappa-opioid receptor; and tetrahydrocannabi-
nol (THC) is a partial agonist at cannabinoid receptors. Other hallucinogenic substances
include atropine and scopolamine, which are cholinergic antagonists, and muscimol, along
with ibotenic acid [1,12–14].

Research into psychedelics flourished from the 1950s to the 1970s. However, once these
substances were designated as highly dangerous in the United States, their use was heavily
restricted worldwide. This led to the establishment of political and cultural obstacles that
hindered further research into their properties [1,15,16].

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

Even though psychedelics are often restricted, interest in their therapeutic application
is increasing for the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD,
and SUD [11,17,18]. Psychedelics might be a breakthrough in the creation of new treatments
because they influence various neurotransmitter systems beyond just the dopaminergic
one. Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) consists of ongoing psychotherapy, either individ-
ually or in a group setting, with a single psychedelic dose administered during a session
specifically tailored for patients to focus on overcoming their SUD [7,18,19].

The increasing focus on research into PAT calls for an updated review of how
psychedelic drugs impact individuals with SUD. The socio-cultural, political, and ethical
constraints tied to historical, correlational, and naturalistic studies render them suboptimal
for such an analysis. This review seeks to consolidate the existing knowledge within the
field on the therapeutic effects of psychedelics.

The current understanding of PAT for SUD is encouraging, yet significant gaps persist
due to historical barriers rooted in socio-cultural, political, and ethical challenges. While
earlier research has shed light on the ability of psychedelics to modulate neurotransmitter
systems beyond the dopaminergic pathway, robust evidence on their therapeutic mech-
anisms, efficacy across different substances, and long-term impacts remains incomplete.
This systematic review seeks to bridge these knowledge gaps by synthesizing recent find-
ings and clarifying the practical applications of PAT in SUD treatment. Although similar
reviews have addressed related questions, this work is vital in integrating the latest data
on these therapies’ safety, efficacy, and implementation. By exploring both classic and
non-classic psychedelics, this review delves into their contributions to multi-component
interventions, particularly those combining pharmacological treatments with psychother-
apy. It also addresses the nuanced needs of patients and the complex contexts in which
these therapies are delivered, providing a comprehensive and updated perspective on their
therapeutic potential.

In this systematic review, we aim to present the current state of knowledge on PAT,
covering various substances and methods of application used for patients suffering from
SUD, such as tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.

The objective of this study is to systematically review current evidence on PAT for
treating SUD. It aims to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and mechanisms of both classic
and non-classic psychedelics, as well as their role within multi-component interventions
like psychotherapy. By addressing gaps in knowledge and exploring clinical applications,
this study seeks to inform future research and improve treatment strategies for individuals
with SUD.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Objectives and Search Strategy

This paper presents a systematic review focused on experimental research aimed at
exploring the effects of psychedelics on human subjects with different addictions. The goal
was to identify and analyze the latest studies within the past decade (2013–2023), following
the guidelines provided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols [20].

For the literature search, electronic methods were employed to find articles pertinent to
the research, and a manual review of references in the chosen publications was conducted.
The authors reviewed the findings’ titles and abstracts to assess their relevance based on
the inclusion criteria.

Articles were searched using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the AI tool Consensus for
the following principal expression: [“psychedelics-assisted therapy in addiction”]. Our
research aimed to analyze the latest research on PAT, restricting our search period from 1

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

4 of 19

January 2013 to 31 December 2023. Two authors reviewed the search results, specifically
the titles and abstracts. Each publication deemed potentially relevant during the search
was scrutinized for its suitability for this review, with a thorough assessment based on
predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight thousand, seven hundred and thirty-four
articles were excluded from the review primarily because they did not align with the
study’s focus, such as addressing PAT in contexts other than addiction, or because they
were identified as reviews, meta-analyses, non-experimental studies, book chapters, or
research protocols.

2.2. Selection Standards

Our investigation focused on clinical trials and randomized controlled trials conducted
between 2013 and 2023 and published in English. We specifically chose studies that
involved psychedelic substances such as LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and ayahuasca/DMT
for treating various addictions, including alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. We excluded
naturalistic and correlational studies, book chapters, review articles, and case reports. The
research needed to present unique datasets. We did not include studies on healthy subjects,
animal research, reviews, or meta-analyses.

2.3. Relevant Data from Studies

Several key details were gathered from the studies, including the lead author, pub-
lication year, study location, study design, number of participants, the patients’ types of
addiction, the psychedelics used, the dosages given, the target condition, outcome mea-
sures, and details of the administration and treatment program setting. In the end, each
study’s principal findings and conclusions were documented.

3. Results
3.1. Study Selection

A total of 10,325 papers were found by searching through databases like PubMed,
Google Scholar, and Consensus AI. After eliminating 40 duplicate entries and excluding
8734 articles not aligned with the study’s focus, 1551 articles were selected for further
screening. Upon closer examination, an additional 876 articles were excluded, primarily
because they addressed PAT in the context of psychiatric disorders other than addiction.
We removed articles identified as reviews, meta-analyses, non-experimental studies, book
chapters, or research protocols, in line with our inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 16 essen-
tial articles from the last decade, consisting of clinical trials and randomized controlled
trials specifically investigating the use of PAT in treating addiction, were included in our
review. The PRISMA flowchart in Figure 1 illustrates the detailed selection process, en-
suring a systematic approach to identifying the most relevant and high-quality studies for
our analysis.

3.2. Details of Included Studies

The articles included in the study had several key features: year of publication, study
design, number of participants, type of addiction studied, psychedelic substance and
dosage used, target condition, outcome measures, setting, primary findings, and treatment
program details (Table 1). These characteristics were selected to ensure a comprehensive
understanding of how PAT is applied in treating SUD.

We focused on the year of publication to analyze recent trends, as research on
psychedelics has gained momentum in the last decade. Knowledge of the study design,
such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or open-label studies, helps assess the quality
and reliability of the findings. The number of participants is important for understanding
the statistical power of each study. The type of addiction and psychedelic substance used
provide insights into which substances are being studied for specific disorders.

Outcome measures, such as changes in substance use and psychological effects, help
gauge the treatment’s efficacy. Additionally, setting details (clinical or community-based)
provide context on how these therapies are administered. The main findings highlight the
effectiveness of the treatment, while treatment program details allow for the comparison of
different therapeutic approaches.

This systematic approach helped ensure that only relevant, high-quality studies were
included in the analysis of PAT for addiction. In this study, a summary of research ex-
ploring the use of psychedelics in addiction treatment is provided. The Table 1 highlights
key details, including the first author, publication year, DOI, study design, number of
participants, type of dependency studied, psychedelic used (including dosage), and the
target condition (Table 1).

3.3. Descriptive Analysis of the Studies

We began by performing a descriptive analysis of the articles in this review, closely
examining the features of recent studies on psychedelic therapy for SUD patients. There
were no restrictions regarding the patients’ countries of origin or where the studies were
conducted. Between 2013 and 2023, 11 relevant articles met the research methodology’s
inclusion criteria. The median publication year was 2016, highlighting the growing impor-
tance and interest in this field within the scientific community. In terms of study designs,
the review included four randomized controlled trials [21,22,24,29], three open-label pilot
studies [23,26,28], one cross-sectional study [30], two qualitative studies [25,31], and one
prospective experimental study [27]. When categorizing by addiction type, the studies

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

7 of 19

covered alcohol dependence (four) [21–23,25] and tobacco users trying to quit smoking
(four) [26,28,30,31], with one study on illicit drug users [24], one on cocaine addiction [29],
and one focusing on mixed dependencies (alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine) [27]. The study
sample sizes ranged from 10 to 358 patients, with an average of 55.18 participants, a median
of 15, and a standard deviation of 98.58. The studies used various psychedelics, mainly
psilocybin, ibogaine, and ayahuasca. Psilocybin was often administered at 25 mg/70 kg,
though some studies did not specify amounts [21–24,26,28,29,31]. Ayahuasca was given
in traditional doses without exact measurements [25,27]. One study used noribogaine in
increasing concentrations [24]. One study used ketamine at 0.71 mg/kg [29], and another
combined psilocybin and LSD without stating dosages [30]. Overall, dosage varied across
studies, showing different approaches.

3.4. Comparative Analysis of PAT for SUD

Each study had a different focus, but most evaluated substance use (alcohol, smok-
ing, or cocaine), cravings, and psychological effects. O’Donnell and Bogenschutz [21,23],
both from the University of New Mexico, centered on alcohol use, cravings, and psy-
chological impacts. Agin-Liebes explored self-compassion and emotional regulation [22],
while Garcia-Romeu and Johnson examined smoking cessation biomarkers and mystical
experiences [26,28]. Dakwar assessed cocaine self-administration alongside mystical expe-
riences, while Thomas and Loizaga-Velder concentrated on mindfulness, empowerment,
and personal transformation, particularly in culturally integrated settings [25,27].

The settings varied from clinical environments to community-based retreats. O’Donnell,
Agin-Liebes, and Bogenschutz conducted studies at the University of New Mexico [22,23]
using structured environments conducive to psychotherapy. Glue evaluated the safety, toler-
ability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of noribogaine
in opioid-dependent patients seeking to discontinue methadone treatment, highlighting
findings related to dose-dependent effects on QTc interval, opioid withdrawal symptoms,
and adverse events [24]. Loizaga-Velder’s work was set in a traditional ayahuasca retreat
in Mexico, emphasizing spiritual transformation, while Thomas conducted his research in
a First Nations community with traditional ceremonies [25,27]. Garcia-Romeu and Johnson
worked at Johns Hopkins University, and Dakwar operated out of Columbia University,
focusing on cocaine addiction with ketamine [26,28–30].

These studies demonstrated that psychedelics have the potential to reduce substance
use and enhance psychological well-being. O’Donnell and Bogenschutz found that psilo-
cybin significantly reduced alcohol cravings [21,23]. Agin-Liebes reported that psilocy-
bin helped with emotional release and improved coping, resulting in decreased alcohol
consumption [22]. Garcia-Romeu and Johnson’s studies on smoking cessation showed
long-term success, with up to 67% abstinence at 12 months [26,28,30]. Thomas and Loizaga-
Velder reported positive effects on mindfulness and empowerment from ayahuasca ther-
apy [25,27]. Dakwar’s research revealed that mystical experiences with ketamine reduced
cocaine use, highlighting the role of subjective experiences in treatment [29].

The treatment approaches varied widely. O’Donnell and Bogenschutz combined
manualized psychotherapy with psilocybin sessions, with O’Donnell using a 12-week
program and scheduled psilocybin doses [21,23]. Agin-Liebes offered 8 h psilocybin
sessions, while Garcia-Romeu and Johnson integrated psilocybin with cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) and mindfulness techniques for smoking cessation [22,26]. Thomas and
Loizaga-Velder used ayahuasca group therapy with a solid cultural emphasis [25,27].
Dakwar’s study was distinctive in using ketamine without psychotherapy, relying solely
on the mystical experience for cocaine reduction [29].

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

Clinical settings like those used by O’Donnell, Agin-Liebes, and Bogenschutz empha-
sized structured environments with monitored psilocybin sessions and psychotherapy,
showing evident reductions in alcohol use [21–23]. Garcia-Romeu and Johnson’s studies
highlighted psilocybin’s effectiveness when combined with CBT for smoking cessation.
In contrast, Thomas and Loizaga-Velder’s naturalistic, culturally embedded studies em-
phasized the spiritual and transformative potential of psychedelics [25–28,30]. Dakwar’s
ketamine study, which lacked psychotherapy, demonstrated that psychedelic experiences
alone can influence substance use outcomes, mainly through mystical experiences [29]
(Table 2).

PAT

Psychedelics have been used for thousands of years, primarily to heal both the body
and mind, in shamanic rituals and for religious purposes [23,32]. One of the earliest
instances of using psychedelics to treat alcohol addiction dates back to 1934, when Bill
Wilson attempted to overcome his alcohol dependency through an experimental therapy
involving a mixture of plants, with effects similar to psychedelics. Wilson experienced a
“brilliant white light during this treatment”, which he described as a spiritual awakening
and a moment of self-transcendence. Following this experience, he never drank alcohol
again and later founded an international support organization for alcohol addicts [12].

Following the accidental discovery of LSD’s psychoactive properties by Albert Hof-
mann in 1943 [33] and the synthesis of psilocybin in 1958 [34], there was a significant
increase in research on classic hallucinogens from the 1950s to the early 1970s. During that
time, scientists studied the potential of these substances to treat alcohol and drug addiction,
as well as conditions like anxiety, depression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Until
1970, LSD, psilocybin, and other hallucinogens were legally available for experimental
research. More than a thousand publications from that era report on the treatment of over
40,000 individuals with classic hallucinogens for various psychiatric disorders [12,35,36].
After the 1970s, the line of research on PAT faced significant obstacles. The cultural and
political climate shifted dramatically due to the widespread recreational use of psychedelics,
which became associated with the counterculture movement [37]. Concerns over public
health and safety led to strict regulatory actions. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970
classified LSD and psilocybin as Schedule I substances, indicating a high potential for
abuse and no accepted medical use, and the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic
Substances of 1971 placed psychedelics under control, leading many countries to adopt
prohibitive regulations. This classification effectively halted clinical research by imposing
stringent restrictions on possession, production, and clinical studies [38].

Classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD, primarily exert their effects
through agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, which is a well-established mechanism
that underlies their psychoactive properties [39,40]. This receptor activation is associated
with a range of neuroplastic changes, including promoting brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) signaling, which facilitates synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth [41,42].
In contrast, non-classical psychedelics, which include substances like MDMA and ketamine,
may engage different receptor systems and mechanisms, leading to distinct psychoactive
effects and therapeutic profiles [43,44].

Research indicates that psychedelics can be particularly effective in treating conditions
like treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Johnson
et al. emphasize the need to understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and related
compounds, which can lead to long-lasting positive changes in mood and well-being,
especially in individuals who have not responded to conventional treatments [6]. Further-
more, studies have shown that psychedelics do not lead to dependence or compulsive use,
which is a significant advantage over many traditional psychiatric medications [40]. This
is particularly relevant given the rising concerns about the addictive potential of various
pharmacological treatments. As shown in Table 2, psychedelics contribute to the reduction
of various symptoms [Table 2].

Psilocybin has garnered significant attention for its potential in treating mental health
disorders, particularly depression. In recognition of its therapeutic promise, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a psilocybin “Breakthrough Therapy” designation
for treatment-resistant depression in 2018 and for major depressive disorder in 2019 [45,46].
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential
of psychedelics for psychiatric disorders. The legal framework for conducting medical
research with psychedelics varies by country but generally involves strict regulatory over-
sight. In the United States, researchers must obtain approval from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) license to study
Schedule I substances [47]. Internationally, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
monitors the implementation of UN drug control conventions, allowing for scientific and
medical use under strict regulations [48].

4.1. Psychedelics Used in the Contemporary Era in the Treatment of SUD
4.1.1. Psilocybin

Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a well-known psychedelic
compound primarily found in Psilocybe mexicana and other species of so-called “magic
mushrooms” [1,49]. Historically, it was used by indigenous American cultures for religious,
ritualistic, and healing purposes. Psilocybin, an indole alkaloid, metabolizes into psilocin
and functions as a serotonin agonist. Over the past decade, interest in this substance has
grown significantly. Research indicates that psilocybin is generally safe when administered
in low doses within controlled settings. According to a review by Tylš et al. [50], low
doses of psilocybin enhance mood, moderate doses induce a well-regulated altered state
of consciousness, and high doses can lead to intense psychedelic experiences. Recent
studies suggest that psilocybin holds potential for treating mental health conditions like
depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and SUD. Its effects on treating SUD,
particularly in relation to alcohol and tobacco addiction, have been explored in recent
evaluations [51,52].

4.1.2. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)

LSD acts as a partial agonist on 5-HT2/5-HT1 and dopaminergic receptors, and is
initially synthesized as a potential stimulant for circulation and respiration [26,53,54]. Its

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

11 of 19

commercialization by Sandoz laboratories allowed for numerous experimental studies, and
it gained popularity as a recreational drug in the 1960s [33]. LSD is a potent substance
that can induce significant changes in consciousness at doses as low as 20 µg, with fast
absorption through the digestive system and primary metabolization in the liver. Research
on LSD’s effects on addiction has mainly focused on alcoholism, with studies dating back
to 1953, when psychiatrists Osmond and Hoffer introduced the drug to chronic alcohol
users, exploring its potential to help individuals reach enhanced self-awareness [55].

4.1.3. Ketamine

Ketamine, an arylcyclohexylamine with two enantiomers, (R)-ketamine and (S)-
ketamine, was developed as a safer and more reliable alternative to phencyclidine for
anesthesia [56]. It offers analgesic solid effects and is a short-acting anesthetic with min-
imal side effects. Ketamine is lipid-soluble and is commonly administered via injection,
either intravenously or intramuscularly, taking effect on the central nervous system within
5 min [57]. Despite its medical applications, ketamine carries a significant risk of abuse
and addiction. Doses between 1 and 4.5 mg/kg are typically used for anesthesia induction,
with smaller doses for maintenance, and subanesthetic doses are used for psychedelic
experiences [58]. Research has demonstrated ketamine’s effectiveness in treating major de-
pressive disorder, including treatment-resistant cases, and in reducing suicidal thoughts. A
single dose can produce fast and lasting effects for up to two weeks, and repeated low-dose
infusions have proven even more beneficial in treatment-resistant depression [59]. Overall,
studies have investigated the effect of ketamine in SUDs related to alcohol, cocaine, and
heroin for the management of withdrawal symptoms.

4.1.4. Ayahuasca

Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew containing DMT and beta-carbolines, which activate
DMT in the mouth. This combination produces longer-lasting altered states of conscious-
ness (up to 6 h or more) with intense visual and emotional experiences. Beta-carbolines’
presence in ayahuasca also enhances its neurobiological effects [60]. It has been traditionally
used by indigenous communities in the Amazon Basin for centuries and holds significant
religious importance for groups like União do Vegetal and Santo Daime [61]. Many par-
ticipants in these rituals have reported overcoming substance and alcohol addiction. A
2015 study found that ayahuasca effectively blocked the development and reinstatement of
behavioral sensitization to alcohol in mice [62].

Cross-sectional research consistently shows that members of religious sects in Brazil
and the U.S. who use ayahuasca have lower rates of alcohol abuse. Fabregas’s assessment
of ayahuasca users indicated that they scored lower on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI)
for alcohol use and psychiatric conditions compared to a control group [63,64].

Today, ayahuasca is being used in treatment centers and in both traditional and “neo-
shamanic” settings to address various conditions, such as addiction and PTSD, as well as
for purposes of personal and spiritual growth.

4.1.5. Ibogaine

Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid derived from the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga,
a shrub native to West Africa [65]. Traditionally used in rituals by the Bwiti religion,
ibogaine has psychedelic properties and is reported to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms
and cravings [66]. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but involves rapid
conversion into its active metabolite, noribogaine, which has a longer elimination half-
life. Both ibogaine and noribogaine interact with various neural pathways, potentially
modulating opioid receptors and other systems [67]. The effects of ibogaine include reduced

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

12 of 19

withdrawal symptoms, light sensitivity, and altered perception, though it also carries risks
such as QT interval prolongation, which necessitates careful monitoring during use [66,67].
Clinical observations indicate that ibogaine can significantly reduce the acute symp-
toms of opioid withdrawal, as well as cravings associated with substance use disorders.
Studies have shown that individuals undergoing ibogaine treatment often report a rapid
decrease in withdrawal symptoms, as measured by standardized scales such as the Sub-
jective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) [68,69]. For instance, a twelve-month follow-up
observational study highlighted a sustained reduction in opioid use and cravings among
participants after ibogaine treatment, suggesting long-term benefits beyond the immediate
detoxification phase [70]. Furthermore, ibogaine’s efficacy is often linked to the profound
psychological experiences it induces, which may facilitate introspection and emotional
processing, thereby contributing to recovery [71].

4.2. Psychedelic Therapy in the Last Ten Years of Research

Our systematic review found five relevant studies in the previous ten years that
investigated the effect of psychedelics on patients with alcohol dependence using different
substances (psilocybin and ayahuasca brew).

Psilocybin has a relatively short duration of consciousness-altering effects (4–6 h)
and a well-established safety profile, especially in clinical settings [21,23]. It has been
shown to promote neuroplasticity, which may help with sustained behavior change, and
its therapeutic effects are often tied to the intensity of the psychedelic experience, including
mystical-type experiences that shift participants’ values and self-identity [22].

These newest studies emphasize that these substances have the potential to catalyze
behavioral and psychological changes, particularly by addressing emotional trauma and
increasing self-awareness [21,23,25]. Especially, Bogenschutz et al.’s studies have demon-
strated reductions in heavy drinking days and improved self-efficacy in managing alcohol
cravings. Importantly, psilocybin’s ability to induce “quantum” change experiences—
sudden, profound shifts in the psychological state—is critical to its effectiveness [23]. These
studies support earlier discoveries from the peak period of psychedelic research, which
suggest that psilocybin can significantly reduce alcohol consumption and cravings, im-
prove mental health, and promote overall well-being [10,34,55,72,73]. Key results include
long-term reductions in alcohol use and enhanced psychological outcomes. Despite these
promising findings, psilocybin is not widely implemented in practice due to regulatory chal-
lenges, a lack of large-scale clinical trials, and more research to establish its long-term safety
and effectiveness. Furthermore, societal stigma and legal obstacles around psychedelics
limit their adoption in mainstream medical treatments.

Across the studies, participants commonly reported improved self-compassion and
emotional regulation. Both psilocybin and ayahuasca are believed to help individuals
confront past trauma, negative emotions, and self-critical thoughts, which are often associ-
ated with addiction [21,25,74]. Psilocybin-treated participants had about 41% fewer heavy
drinking days compared to those receiving a placebo [22]. On the other hand, Thomas
et al. report statistically significant improvements in mindfulness and emotional regulation,
and reductions in problematic substance use (e.g., cocaine) in people who use ayahuasca
as a therapy. However, some studies report varying effects on different substances, with
reductions in alcohol and cocaine use, but not in cannabis or opiates [31,75].

All alcohol dependence studies included highlight the importance of set and setting—
whether through guided therapy sessions in clinical settings or through the ritualized
use of substances like ayahuasca in culturally traditional settings [25,27]. The supportive
context, whether religious or therapeutic, enhances the effectiveness of the psychedelics.

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

13 of 19

The follow-up periods in these studies often extended to several months, and participants
continued to show reductions in heavy drinking days.

Looking for studies about smoking cessation and tobacco dependence, we discovered,
in the last ten years, four original papers that studied the effect of psychedelics in the
process of quitting smoking. Specifically, psilocybin was frequently used in the treatment
of tobacco dependence with promising results, revealing both common patterns and critical
differences in the outcomes and methodologies.

Across the studies analyzed, psilocybin demonstrated a substantial capacity to pro-
mote smoking cessation. In an open-label pilot study, Johnson et al. in 2014 reported that
80% of participants (12 out of 15) achieved biologically confirmed smoking abstinence at
six months post-treatment [26,28]. This high success rate far exceeds the 35% success rates
typically observed with other pharmacological and behavioral interventions for smoking
cessation [28,30]. Similar results were observed in long-term follow-ups, where 60% of
participants remained abstinent after 30 months (Noorani et al.) in 2018 [31].

These findings consistently highlight the potential of psilocybin as an effective adjunct
to CBT in smoking cessation treatments [76,77]. In all studies, the psychedelic experience
was framed within a structured therapeutic program that included preparatory counseling,
mindfulness training, and post-session integration discussions [26,31]. This combination of
psilocybin with CBT appears to be essential in sustaining therapeutic gains, as participants
were encouraged to process their psychedelic experiences in ways that supported long-term
abstinence from smoking. These studies consistently report that the preparatory sessions
helped participants frame their motivations for quitting, while the follow-up sessions
reinforced their abstinence [28,31].

Differences across studies include the variability in the dosage and number of psilocy-
bin sessions administered. In some studies, participants received two doses of psilocybin
(20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg) spaced two weeks apart, with an optional third high-dose
session [26,28]. In others, the dose and the number of sessions were modified based on
participants’ smoking behaviors post-treatment [30]. While all participants underwent
at least one high-dose session (typically 30 mg/70 kg), additional doses were tailored
to individual needs, particularly for those who struggled to maintain abstinence. This
flexible dosing strategy may contribute to the success rates observed across different
follow-up periods. The duration of follow-up also varied between studies. While most
studies conducted follow-ups at six months, some extended their follow-up periods to over
30 months, revealing that the effects of psilocybin on smoking cessation could persist for
years [28]. Interestingly, while the success rate at six months was higher (80%), it decreased
slightly over time, with 60% of participants remaining abstinent at long-term follow-up [30].
This decrease suggests that while psilocybin facilitates significant initial behavior change,
maintaining long-term abstinence may require additional support or booster sessions.

Psilocybin’s ability to evoke profound changes in self-concept and emotional pro-
cessing appears to be crucial in promoting smoking cessation. Participants across all
studies reported that their psilocybin sessions provided vivid insights into their reasons for
smoking, which often resulted in a re-evaluation of their identity and behavior [26,30,31].
A common theme reported by participants was the realization that smoking no longer
made sense in the context of their newly discovered sense of self. This shift in perspective,
coupled with the supportive therapeutic framework, allowed participants to break free
from their addiction to cigarettes. Additionally, in concordance with older studies, many
participants noted that the acute effects of psilocybin, including heightened emotional
awareness and introspection, overshadowed any withdrawal symptoms they might have
experienced, making it easier to abstain from smoking [77,78].

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

The precise psychological and neurobiological mechanisms by which psilocybin fa-
cilitates smoking cessation remain unclear. While mystical experiences are consistently
associated with successful outcomes, more research is needed to determine how these
experiences translate into lasting behavior change. Neuroimaging studies and longitudinal
assessments of cognitive and emotional changes following psilocybin treatment could
provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of action.

A 2016 New Zealand study investigated the safety and efficacy of noribogaine, a
metabolite of ibogaine, in opioid-dependent patients undergoing methadone detoxification.
The study found that noribogaine was generally well tolerated but caused a dose-dependent
prolongation of the QTc interval, a measure of heart rhythm. There was a non-statistically
significant trend toward reduced opioid withdrawal symptoms, particularly at the 120 mg
dose. Still, the time to resumption of opioid substitution therapy (OST) was not significantly
different between the placebo and treatment groups [24].

Looking to the future, the clinical trial NCT04003948, titled “Preliminary Efficacy and
Safety of Ibogaine in the Treatment of Methadone Detoxification”, is a Phase 2 study
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibogaine hydrochloride in facilitating
methadone detoxification. Similarly, the clinical trial NCT03380728, titled “Ibogaine in the
Treatment of Alcoholism: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Escalating-
dose, Phase 2 Trial”, aims to assess the safety and efficacy of ibogaine hydrochloride in
treating alcohol dependence.

While the New Zealand study provides preliminary insights into the potential
of noribogaine for opioid detoxification, the ongoing clinical trials NCT04003948 and
NCT03380728 are expected to offer more comprehensive data on the safety and efficacy
of ibogaine hydrochloride in treating substance dependence. The outcomes of these trials
will be crucial in determining the therapeutic viability of ibogaine and its derivatives for
addiction treatment.

The treatment of illicit drug dependence has seen growing interest in the integration
of psychedelics and psychoactive substances, such as ayahuasca, ketamine, and psilocybin.
Each study emphasizes the importance of the psychoactive effects of the substances used—
whether through mystical-type experiences induced by ketamine or psilocybin or the
visionary and emotional effects produced by ayahuasca. For instance, the ketamine study
by Dakwar et al. demonstrated that the mystical-type experiences generated by ketamine
were significantly associated with improvements in cocaine dependence [27,29,79].

Across the studies, there were substantial reductions in the use of substances following
psychedelic or psychoactive treatment. In the ayahuasca-assisted therapy studies, par-
ticipants reported reductions in or the complete cessation of problematic substance use,
including cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco [27,79]. Likewise, in the ketamine study, which did
not involve a cultural or spiritual context, participants demonstrated marked reductions in
cocaine self-administration and cravings following treatment. However, ketamine’s ability
to induce sustained behavior change appears to be more dependent on the intensity of the
mystical-type experience, and the long-term effectiveness of ketamine without ongoing
therapy or additional doses remains less understood compared to ayahuasca’s results [29].

4.3. The Future of Psychedelic Therapy

The future of psychedelic therapy in research and clinical practice for addictive use
disorders holds significant promise, yet it necessitates rigorous investigation and cautious
implementation. Recent studies have demonstrated that psychedelics such as psilocybin,
ketamine, and ayahuasca may effectively reduce substance use, prolong periods of ab-
stinence, and decrease the frequency of heavy usage days among individuals with SUD.
These substances are believed to enhance neural plasticity, potentially reorganizing the dis-

Medicina 2025, 61, 278

15 of 19

ordered neural pathways involved in addiction. Additionally, psychedelics may attenuate
maladaptive signaling in the mesolimbic reward pathway, offering a novel mechanism for
treating SUD [80,81].

However, the existing research is limited by small sample sizes, methodological con-
straints, expectancy biases, and challenges with blinding procedures. The therapeutic
effects observed are often partial and temporary, suggesting that repeated administrations
and integration with psychotherapy might be necessary for enduring benefits. The combi-
nation of psychedelic treatment with psychotherapy appears to be more effective than either
approach alone, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive therapeutic framework.
In research and therapeutic environments, administering classic hallucinogens requires
careful safety measures to reduce risks. Participants must be screened thoroughly, excluding
individuals with psychotic or bipolar disorders. A physician should be available during
sessions, although the need for emergency interventions is rare. Psychological difficulties
are typically addressed through reassurance from staff. Building a solid rapport between
volunteers and staff before sessions helps alleviate anxiety and prepares individuals for the
drug’s powerful effects. Volunteers are constantly monitored closely and never left alone
during the experience. Afterward, follow-up meetings allow participants to reflect on their
emotional or spiritual experiences and receive further care if necessary.

Future research should focus on conducting high-quality, controlled studies with more
extensive and diverse populations to confirm the efficacy and safety of PAT. Longitudinal
studies are required to determine the longevity of therapeutic effects, and neuroimaging re-
search could elucidate the neural correlates of long-term changes induced by psychedelics.
Regulatory challenges persist, as many psychedelics are constrained by restrictive
schedules that limit their medical use. A shift in regulatory status, along with the devel-
opment of accredited training programs for clinicians, would be essential for integrating
psychedelic therapies into mainstream clinical practice. Addressing these hurdles could
pave the way for psychedelics to become a valuable addition to the repertoire of treatments
for SUD, particularly for patients who have not responded to conventional interventions.
Ultimately, while psychedelic therapy offers a promising avenue for the treatment of addic-
tive use disorders, its future relies on thorough research, ethical considerations, and careful
implementation to ensure safe and effective outcomes for patients.

5. Conclusions

Our research succeeded in reviewing the last ten years of international experience,
highlighting the growing potential of PAT for treating SUD, especially in relation to al-
cohol, tobacco, and cocaine dependence. Recent studies demonstrate that psychedelics,
such as psilocybin, ayahuasca, and ketamine, can significantly reduce substance use and
cravings and promote psychological well-being. These effects are often linked to mystical
or emotional experiences induced during therapy, which can catalyze profound behavioral
changes. The integration of psychedelics with psychotherapy is critical for maximizing
therapeutic outcomes. Regulatory and societal barriers, along with the need for special-
ized clinical training, must be addressed to ensure the safe and effective implementa-
tion of psychedelic therapies in mainstream addiction treatment. As research progresses,
psychedelics could offer an innovative approach to SUD, particularly for individuals who
have not responded to conventional treatments.
