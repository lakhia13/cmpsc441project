In the UK in 2019, 6524 people took their own lives. Men are three times more likely than women to die by suicide. Women are more likely to report suicidal thoughts.

Men aged 45 to 49 and women aged 50 to 54 have the highest suicide rates in England and Wales.


### What does it mean to be suicidal?


Suicidal feelings can be confusing, frightening and complicated. They can range from having general thoughts about not wanting to be here to make a plan about how and when you could end your life. You might feel less like you want to die and more that you want the pain to stop.

You might feel:

- hopeless or trapped

- tearful, anxious or overwhelmed by negative thoughts

- tempted to do risky or reckless things because you don’t care what happens to you

- like you want to avoid other people


### What can make someone want to end their life?


Suicide is complex, and there is no single explanation of why people die by suicide. There are many different risk factors, including:

- previous suicide attempts, or previousself-harm. Many people who self-harm don’t want to die. However, research shows that people who self-harm are at higher risk of attempting or dying by suicide

- being unemployed

- having aphysical health problem, including chronic pain

- being dependent onalcoholordrugs

- havingmental health problems

There may not be an obvious reason why someone feels suicidal. But whatever the cause, there is help available.

### How can I help someone if I’m worried they’re suicidal?


Simple actions can help support someone who is suicidal or recovering from an attempt to take their life.

Just asking someone if they’re suicidal can help. Asking directly about suicide gives someone permission to open up and lets them know they’re not a burden. If someone feels suicidal, it can be a huge relief to talk about how they feel.

If a friend does share their suicidal feelings with you, it’s usually best to listen and respond with open questions rather than advice or opinions. You don’t have to solve their problems; offer support and encourage them to talk if you can.

It can feel difficult to start these conversations. Samaritanshave tips on how to be a good listener. Mind also has information onsupporting someone who feels suicidal.

Your friend may also need help with practical things, such as calling their GP, contacting family and friends, or simply watching TV with them or doing an activity together. You could also help them make a safety plan when they feel able to. In a crisis, this can help them remember ways to cope and people to contact. You candownload a safety plan here.

It’s important to know when to get professional support for someone you’re supporting. You could suggest they contact one of the organisations listed above in the ‘What can I do if I’m feeling suicidal?’ section.

There are limits to the support you can provide as a friend, and you need to take care of yourself. Give yourself time to rest and process what they’ve told you or what’s happened. It’s ok to decide you can’t help someone or need to step back for a while. Try to help them create a support network of other friends, relatives and mental health professionals who can help them too.
