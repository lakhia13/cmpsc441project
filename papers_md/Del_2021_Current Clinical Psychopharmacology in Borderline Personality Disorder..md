Abstract: Background: Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) manifest affective and 
behavioral symptoms causing personal distress, relationship difficulties, and reduced quality of life 
with  global  functioning  impairment,  mainly  when  the  disease  takes  an  unfavorable  course.  A  sub-
stantial amount of healthcare  costs  is dedicated to addressing  these  issues. Many BPD patients re-
ceive medications, mostly those who do not respond to psychological interventions. 

Objective: Our aim was to assess the efficacy of the most used strategies of pharmacological inter-
ventions in BPD with a comprehensive overview of the field. 

Methods:  We  searched  the  PubMed  database  for  papers  focused  on  the  most  used  psychotropic 
drugs  for  BPD.  We  included  randomized  controlled  trials  and  open  studies  in  adult  patients  with 
BPD,  focusing  on  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  single  classes  of  drugs  with  respect  to  specific 
clinical presentations that may occur during the course of BPD. 

Results:  Specific  second-generation  antipsychotics  (SGAs)  or  serotonergic  antidepressants  can  be 
effective for different  core  symptoms of BPD, mainly including mood symptoms, anxiety, and im-
pulse dyscontrol. Some atypical  antipsychotics  can  also be  effective for psychotic  and dissociative 
symptoms. Specific antiepileptics can be useful in some cases in treating different BPD symptoms, 
mainly including mood instability, impulsiveness, and anger. 

Conclusion:  No  medication  is  currently  approved  for  BPD,  and  clinicians  should  carefully  assess 
the benefits and risks of drug treatment. Further studies are needed to identify specific personalized 
treatment strategies, also considering the clinical heterogeneity and possible comorbidities of BPD. 

Keywords: Borderline personality disorder, affective instability, drug treatment, impulsiveness, anger, atypical antipsychotics, 
mood stabilizers, antidepressants. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Borderline pathology was first described by Stern [1]  as 
lying  on  a  “borderland”  between  psychosis  and  neurosis. 
This  construct  had  no  direct  implications  for  personality 
problems. Subsequently, it was increasingly viewed as a per-
sonality  disorder.  Linehan’s  [2]  model  has  been  the  most 
influential  in  viewing  the  core  symptom  of  borderline  per-
sonality  disorder  (BPD)  as  emotion  dysregulation.  BPD  is 
the  most  studied  personality  area  because  it  is  clinically

common [3] and affects society significantly [4]. Its response 
to pharmacological interventions is limited  to  certain symp-
toms  [5].  Although  most  patients  improve  with  time  [6], 
BPD  can  have  a  chronic  course,  with  symptoms  of  marked 
impulsivity,  instability  of  mood,  problems  in  interpersonal 
relationships, and suicidality, which can have a negative im-
pact  on  both  clinical  outcomes  and  effectiveness  of  treat-
ments.  One  of  the  major  clinical  challenges  is  the  manage-
ment of chronic suicidality [7]. Making the diagnosis is cru-
cial for planning treatment. 

The prevalence of BPD in the community is estimated at 
about 2% of the adult population [8], but it is present in 9% 
of psychiatry outpatients [9] and is also  common among in-
patients  [10].  It  is  predominantly  diagnosed  in  women

Table 1.   BPD Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5). 

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive insta-
bility of social relationships, self-image, and emotions; marked impulsivity beginning in early adulthood and present in at least five of the following con-
texts: 

•  Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, reflecting intolerance to be alone; 

•  Unstable and intense relationships marked by abrupt and extreme shifts between idealization and devaluation; 

•  Identity disturbance, seen in an unstable self-image or sense of self; 

•  Impulsivity that is potentially self-damaging in at least two of the following areas—spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating; 

•  Recurrent suicidal gestures or threats, or self-mutilation; 

•  Affective instability with marked mood reactivity; 

•  Chronic feelings of emptiness; 

•  Frequent displays of inappropriate or intense anger or difficult control of anger; 

•  Transient and stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms 

(75%).  It  is  important  to  diagnose  BPD  in  adolescents,  as 
most cases begin at that stage of development [11]. 

We have summarized the diagnostic criteria of BPD indi-
cated  by  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental 
Disorders-5 (DSM-5) [12] in Table 1. 

BPD  often  coexists  with  many  other  disorders,  most 
commonly with mood disorders, substance use, eating disor-
ders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as other 
personality disorders. The most common comorbid condition 
is  major  depression  [13],  although  this  overlap  can  also  be 
seen as an artifact of the DSM criteria [6]. BPD patients have 
high rates of self-harm [14] and suicide attempts [15]. There 
is  now  a  large  empirical  literature  on  the  psychotherapeutic 
treatment of BPD. A range of treatments deriving from both 
cognitive-behavioral  and  psychodynamic  traditions  have 
shown efficacy  in randomized controlled  trials (RCTs).  The 
results of these studies suggest that BPD is a treatable disor-
der in most cases. The best known and most widely tested of 
these treatments is dialectical behavior therapy [2], which is 
derived from a cognitive-behavioral tradition. From the same 
tradition,  there  is  evidence  for  schema-focused  therapy 
(SFT)  [16,  17]  and  for  a  briefer  treatment  called  Systems 
Training  for  Emotional  Predictability  and  Problem  Solving 
(STEPPS)  [18].  Other  BPD-specific  psychotherapies  are 
derived  from  the  psychoanalytic/psychodynamic  tradition. 
The  best  known  among  these  are  mentalization-based  ther-
apy  (MBT)  [19]  and  transference-focused  psychotherapy 
(TFP)  [20].  In  contrast  to  these  specialty  treatments,  good 
psychiatric  management  (GPM)  is  a  generalist  approach  to 
psychotherapy  and  treatment  of  BPD  [21].  Although  there 
have  been  few  direct  comparisons,  enough  data  now  exist 
from  RCTs  and  meta-analyses  to  suggest  that  no  approach 
has been consistently found superior to another, as supported 
by  a  recent  Cochrane  report  [5],  which  also  notes  that  the 
literature on long-term outcome remains sparse.  

All psychotherapeutic treatments share many similarities; 
there is a common focus on emotion regulation, views of self 
and  others,  and  unintegrated  mental  states.  Furthermore, 
treatments  for  BPD  generally  include  a  focus  on  self-
observation,  controlling  intense  emotions,  reducing  impul-
sivity,  and  improving  interpersonal  relationships  [6].  With 

regard  to  drug  treatment,  there  are  numerous  studies  in  the 
literature focused on the pharmacological treatment of BPD, 
without conclusive evidence in support of therapeutic indica-
tions nor an existing consensus regarding the most appropri-
ate  duration  of  psychopharmacological  treatment.  It  should 
also  be  noted  that  most  published  studies  have  relatively 
small  samples,  and  their  results  have  not  been  consistently 
replicated. Finally, we need to consider sociocultural factors 
that may have influenced published guidelines [22]. 

Some  guidelines  are  highly  conservative  about  psycho-
pharmacology  for  BPD.  Unfortunately,  the  last  Cochrane 
report  is  already  old  [23],  although  a  revision  is  being  pre-
pared. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) [24] guidelines state that antipsychotic drugs should 
not  be  used  for  the  medium-  and  long-term  treatment  of 
BPD.  They  advise  clinicians  to  consider  drug  treatments  in 
the  event  of  a  crisis,  but  these  should  be  prescribed  for  no 
longer  than  1  week.  The  same  guidelines  stated  that,  when 
considering drug treatment for any reason for a person with 
BPD, clinicians should consider the existing evidence of the 
efficacy of target drugs and inform patients. While it can be 
important to treat comorbid disorders, one needs to recognize 
that  medications  that  are  effective  in  patients  without  per-
sonality  disorders  are  less  useful  in  those  who  have  these 
diagnoses  [25].  The  relationship  between  BPD  and  depres-
sion  is  problematic  because  most  patients  meet  the  criteria 
for  both  but  with  very  different  psychopathological  charac-
teristics  and  treatment  responses.  Differential  diagnosis  is 
most important in distinguishing BPD from bipolar spectrum 
disorders,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  and  post-
traumatic stress disorder [26,27]. 

The  American  Psychiatric  Association  guidelines  recom-
mended a symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy, consistent with 
the conclusion that pharmacology does not change the overall 
severity  of  the  disorder  [28,29].  However,  since  patients  are 
heterogeneous, they may need personalized treatments. 

This  paper  aims  to  review  the  scientific  evidence  of  the 

efficacy of the main drugs used for treating its symptoms.

2. METHODS 

We  performed  a  PubMed  search  to  identify  peer-
reviewed  studies  focused  on  psychopharmacological  treat-
ment  in  adult  patients  with  BPD.  We  followed  a  stepwise 
method to identify relevant experimental articles. 

First,  on  10  July  2020,  we  identified  studies  through  a 
standard  search  with  the  title/abstract  specification  in  Pub-
Med  (http://www.pubmed.gov),  using  the  terms  “borderline 
personality disorder,” “pharmacol*,” “treatment,” “therapy,” 
“psychopharmacology,” and excluding the terms “magnetic,” 
“stimulation,”  “electroconvulsive,” “ECT,”  “schizophrenia,” 
“schizoaffective,”  “post-traumatic  stress  disorder,”  and 
“PTSD.” We retrieved 2,203 papers. 

Second,  we  included  pharmacological  trials,  systematic 
reviews, and meta-analyses. We excluded articles with sam-
ples  of  BPD  patients  of  fewer  than  5  and  studies  that  in-
cluded  patients  with  schizophrenia  spectrum  and  obsessive-
compulsive  spectrum  disorders,  attention  deficit  and  hyper-
activity  disorder  (ADHD),  case  reports,  bipolar  disorders, 
head  trauma,  and  neurological  illnesses.  We  also  excluded 
studies  focused  on  psychotherapy  not  combined  with  phar-
macological  treatments,  and  neural  stimulation,  transcranial 
magnetic  stimulations,  and  neurosurgery  studies,  as  well  as 
neuroimaging studies and animal studies. 

Third, we searched for studies prior to the considered pe-
riod  in  article  references  and  on  PubMed  through  the  func-
tion “Similar articles,” further considering another four stud-
ies. 

were case reports or case series or had insufficient samples; 
620  specifically  focused  on  psychotherapy  or  psychosocial 
treatments;  217  were  reviews;  705  mainly  focused  on  clini-
cal  or  psychopathological  aspects;  7  were  neuroimaging 
studies; 43 focused on other aspects of biological psychiatry; 
2 were letters to the editor; 2 were duplicates; 10 were treat-
ment guidelines. 

Fourth,  we  finally  included  66  papers  focusing  on  the 
psychopharmacological  treatment  of  BPD  symptoms  (see 
PRISMA flow-chart, Fig. 1). 

3. RESULTS 

We  summarized  the  results  of  this  systematic  review  in 

Table 2. 

4. DISCUSSION 

It has been evident since the end of the twentieth century 
that  pharmacotherapy  coupled  with  psychotherapy  can  pro-
duce  a  clinically  significant  improvement  in  mood  and  be-
havioral symptoms of patients with BPD [30]. Based on their 
specific  mechanisms  of  action,  different  psychotropic  drugs 
can act positively on different types of BPD symptoms. Here 
we  summarize,  for  each  drug  within  the  main  psychophar-
macological  classes  (i.e.,  antipsychotics,  antidepressants, 
antiepileptics,  and  other  drugs),  the  evidence  of  efficacy  on 
some symptom dimensions of BPD. 

4.1. Antipsychotics 

On  these  bases,  we  considered  2,205  studies.  Of  these, 
484 were not focused on BPD or not related to the topic; 49 

Antipsychotic  drugs  are  indicated  in  the  treatment  of 
schizophrenia and psychotic manifestations of mood disorders.

These drugs can contribute to mood stabilization in the long-
term treatment of the major depressive and bipolar disorders. 
These  drugs  are  widely  used  for  the  treatment  of  various 
symptoms that may occur in patients with BPD. 

Olanzapine. Olanzapine is an antagonist at both serotonin 
5HT2A  and  dopamine  D2  receptors.  It  is  not  correlated  to 
extrapyramidal  symptoms  because  of  the  low  affinity  with 
D2  receptors  but  can  be  a  sedative  agent  because  of  the 
strong antagonist properties at M1-muscarinic, H1-histaminic, 
and α 1-adrenergic  receptors.  Olanzapine  also  has  5HT2C  an-
tagonist properties and weaker 5HT7 and α2 antagonist prop-
erties,  which  have  been  linked  to  its  antidepressant  activity 
[31].  There  is  strong  evidence  of  olanzapine’s  effectiveness 
in  treating  most  BPD  symptoms.  A  12  weeks’  placebo-
control  double-blind  study  showed  improvement  of  BPD 
symptoms with olanzapine  at a daily dose of 2.5–5 mg, ex-
cept  for  suicidality  and  self-harming  [32].  Specific  BPD 
symptoms  that  significantly  improved  with  olanzapine  use 
are  intense  anger,  affective  instability,  chronic  feelings  of 
emptiness, identity disturbance, impulsivity, frantic efforts to 
avoid abandonment, and unstable personal relationships [33–
35].  The  BPD  treatment  with  olanzapine  at  a  dose  of  5–10 
mg  correlated  with  improvements  in  different  symptoms, 
including paranoid ideation, dissociation, as well as irritabil-
ity,  and  suicidal  behaviors  [36].  Other  evidence  noted  the 
improvement in both the overall BPD and depressive symp-
toms  using  olanzapine  in  this  kind  of  patient  [37].  Further 
research demonstrated that the association of olanzapine with 
fluoxetine  could  be  more  effective  than  olanzapine  mono-
therapy  on  depressive  symptoms  in  BPD  [38].  Other  data 
showed  a  significant  decrease  in  depressive  symptoms  and 
clinical  anxiety.  The  added-on  dialectical  behavior  therapy 

correlated with significantly greater improvement in the fre-
quency  of  impulsivity/aggressive  episodes  [39].  Olanzapine 
proved to be effective in women with BPD to treat the anxi-
ety  symptoms  and  episodes  of  anguish  [34].  Beyond  the 
therapeutic  effects  of  olanzapine,  the  tolerability  profile 
should  be  assessed,  especially  in  relation  to  the  issues  of 
weight gain and metabolic syndrome [32,37]. 

Quetiapine. Quetiapine is an antagonist at both serotonin 
5HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors but has several differenti-
ating pharmacologic properties, especially  at different doses 
and  formulations.  Quetiapine  has  an  active  metabolite, 
norquetiapine,  which  has  many  activities.  Quetiapine  can 
cause  weight  gain,  and  it  can  increase  fasting  triglyceride 
levels  and  insulin  resistance.  Quetiapine  has  proven  to  be 
effective  in  BPD  at  a  daily  dosage  ranging  from  150  mg  to 
300 mg for the treatment of intense anger, affective instabil-
ity,  chronic  feelings  of  emptiness,  identity  disturbance,  and 
frantic  efforts  to  avoid  abandonment,  and  unstable  personal 
relationships. However, the side effects are more frequent in 
patients  who  used  a  dosage  of  300  mg,  without  having  a 
greater  improvement  than  those  who  took  150  mg  per  day 
[40]. Treatment with a daily dose of 300 mg was correlated 
with a reduction of hypomanic  and manic symptoms. How-
ever, it has not proved to be useful in controlling impulsivity 
[40]. In contrast, other studies showed a reduction of impul-
sivity  in  patients  taking  quetiapine  at  daily  dosages  ranging 
from  50  mg  to  400  mg  (up  to  a  maximum  of  800  mg/day). 
Substance  abuse  and  gambling,  which  have  been  linked  to 
impulsivity,  can  also  improve.  The  use  of  quetiapine  has 
proven  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  depressive  and 
anxiety symptoms and reducing the emotional instability and 
psychological  distress  in  BPD  [41-45],  although  with  some

inconsistency  in  terms of  improvement of depressive symp-
toms [43]. Some studies showed the effectiveness of quetiap-
ine in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in BPD patients, 
especially  at  high  dosages  [43-46].  Other  evidence  under-
lined that quetiapine could improve cognitive symptoms [47] 
and  overall  social  and  work  functioning  [43-46]  in  BPD. 
From  the  included  studies,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of 
the  efficacy  of  quetiapine  on  suicidality  and  self-injurious 
behavior in BPD. The reported inconsistencies may be linked 
with  different  factors,  including  the  heterogeneity  of  the 
study  samples,  comorbidities,  other  concomitant  treatments, 
differences  in  the  psychopathological  state  of  included  pa-
tients,  genomic  aspects,  and  other  possible  environmental 
and biological variables. 

Asenapine.  This  atypical  antipsychotic  is  characterized 
by  5HT2A,  5HT2C,  H1,  and α 2  antagonism,  and  D2  antago-
nism.  Asenapine  can  be  sedating,  especially  upon  first  dos-
ing,  but  does  not  have  a  high  propensity  either  for  ex-
trapyramidal symptoms or weight gain/dyslipidemia, despite 
its 5HT2C antagonism added to weaker antihistaminic proper-
ties. Asenapine at a daily dose of 5-10 mg improved overall 
functioning,  anxiety,  aggression,  and  impulsivity  in  BPD 
patients. Like olanzapine, it was effective in improving emo-
tional lability, dissociative symptoms, and paranoid ideation. 
There is a lack of evidence of its effectiveness on depressive 
symptoms,  suicidal/self-injury  behaviors,  and  identity  dis-
turbance  in  patients  with  BPD  [48].  Given  the  presence  of 
only  a  single  open-label  RCT,  more  studies  are  needed  to 
assess the  effectiveness of asenapine in  treating BPD symp-
toms. 

Haloperidol.  This  typical  antipsychotic  strongly  blocks 
the  dopamine  D2  receptors,  reducing  positive  symptoms  of 
psychoses  and  possibly  aggressive,  explosive,  and  hyperac-
tive  behaviors.  By  blocking  D2  receptors  in  the  striatum,  it 
can  cause  extrapyramidal  symptoms  [31].  Treatment  with 
haloperidol at a daily dose of 4 mg proved to be effective in 
BPD  patients  for  different  symptoms,  including  depression, 
anger,  hostility,  impulsivity,  and  particularly  for  some 
schizotypal  characteristics  such  as  paranoid  ideation  illu-
sions, and ideas of reference [49]. Other evidence underlined 
that a combination of haloperidol and phenelzine resulted in 
modest  improvements  of  irritability  and  depressive  symp-
toms  in  the  short  term  of  BPD  treatment  [50]  and  limited 
long-term  efficacy  of  neuroleptics  and  Monoamine  oxidase 
inhibitors (MAOIs) antidepressants [51]. 

Clozapine. This is an antagonist of both serotonin 5HT2A 
and dopamine D2 receptors (serotonin-dopamine antagonist) 
(SDA). It has a complex profile of affinity since it can bind 
several  receptors,  including  the  H1, α 1,  M1,  5HT2B,  5HT2C, 
5HT6,  and  5HT7.  Clozapine  has  been  used  only  for  treating 
severe  cases  of  BPD  because  of  the  lack  of  indication  and 
issues  in  tolerability  (risk  of  agranulocytosis,  cholinergic 
symptoms, and eosinophilic myocarditis) [31]. It was admin-
istered  at  a  daily  dosage  ranging  from  25  to  100  mg,  fol-
lowed  by  improvements  in  thought  disturbance,  alterations 
of  perception,  suspicion,  illusions,  dissociative  symptoms, 
and  strange  beliefs  in  patients  with  severe  BPD  [52].  How-
ever, its efficacy has not been demonstrated in the treatment 
of psychomotor slowdown, depressed mood, guilt, emotional 
blunt, and megalomaniac tendencies in BPD [53]. 

Amoxapine.  Short-term  treatment  with  amoxapine  at  a 
daily  dosage  of  200  mg  improved  schizophrenic-like  and 
depressive symptoms in patients with schizotypal personality 
disorders but did not show changes in BPD patients [54]. 

Aripiprazole. This is a partial agonist of the D2 dopamine 
receptor  and  is  theoretically  an  atypical  antipsychotic  with 
reduced  extrapyramidal  symptoms  and  hyperprolactinemia 
[31]. In BPD patients, aripiprazole proved to be effective in 
the treatment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, insecurity 
in  social  relationships,  depression,  anxiety,  aggressive-
ness/hostility,  phobic  symptoms,  paranoid  thinking,  and 
other  psychotic  symptoms  [55,56].  In  the  long-term  treat-
ment, it improved depressive and anxious symptoms, reduc-
ing  the  amount  of  anger  in  BPD  patients  [55].  Aripiprazole 
augmentation  for  3  months  in  sertraline-resistant  patients 
with  borderline  personality  disorder  improved  the  global 
clinical  impression  and  proved  to  be  effective  in  treating 
impulsivity, dissociation, and paranoid ideation. This add-on 
treatment  did  not  show  significant  changes  in  anxiety  and 
depression in these patients, with no improvements in aban-
donment feelings, interpersonal relationships, identity symp-
toms,  parasuicidal  behavior,  affective  instability,  emptiness, 
and outbursts of anger [57]. More studies are needed on the 
effects  of  aripiprazole  on  different  symptoms,  including 
abandonment,  interpersonal  relationships,  identity  distur-
bance,  parasuicidal  behavior,  affective  instability,  and  emp-
tiness. 

Paliperidone. This drug is an antagonist of dopamine D2 
and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and has affinities with H1, α1, 
and α2 receptors [31]. Different studies showed its effective-
ness  in  treating  psychotic  symptoms  and  impulsive  dyscon-
trol in BPD. The oral drug (3–6 mg/die) or long-acting injec-
tion (50–150 mg/day) both led to an improvement in general 
functioning, impulsivity, anger, paranoid ideation, and disso-
ciative symptoms [58,59]. The main tolerability issues could 
be a possible increase in prolactin serum levels and the mani-
festation  of  extrapyramidal  symptoms,  especially  with  the 
oral  formulation  [58].  Based  on  its  metabolic  profile,  pali-
peridone  palmitate  could  be  more  tolerable  [59].  There  is 
insufficient  evidence  of  response  to  depressive  symptoms, 
suicidal and self-injury behaviors, and affective instability in 
BPD treated with paliperidone. 

Risperidone.  A  short-term  (8  weeks)  treatment  with 
risperidone  at low-to-moderate doses (mean daily dosage of 
3.27 mg) in  BPD with  aggressive behavior proved to be ef-
fective  in  treating  aggression.  This  treatment  resulted  in  an 
overall  improvement,  especially  in  depressive  symptoms, 
and  correlated  with  an  increase  in  energy  and  better  global 
functioning [60]. This evidence underlined the need for fur-
ther  studies  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  risperidone  in  the 
treatment of BPD. 

Thioridazine.  A  single  12-week  open  study  showed  that 
thioridazine  might exert prominent effects on  BPD patients, 
including improvements in impulsiveness, affective and psy-
chotic  symptoms,  and  interpersonal  relations.  However,  se-
dation  and  erectile  dysfunction  were  significant  tolerability 
issues [61]. No further studies have followed this 1989 evi-
dence.

Del Casale et al. 

Ziprasidone.  This  atypical  antipsychotic  has  an  affinity 
with  serotonin  5HT2A,  5HT1B,  and  dopamine  D2  receptors 
[31]. Ziprasidone at a daily dose of 80 mg for the treatment 
of BPD patients proved to be  effective  in the control of an-
ger, paranoid ideation, impulsivity, and emotional instability, 
but not for anxiety and depressive symptoms [62]. The use of 
ziprasidone  (daily  dose  range  of  40–160  mg)  could  be  con-
sidered  for  managing  acute  cases  of  BPD,  considering  the 
reported  improvements  of  suicidal  and  self-injurious  risk, 
hostility and aggression, impulse control, and severe anxious 
depressive symptoms [63].  

4.2. Antidepressants 

Several  studies  have  focused  on  the  possible  efficacy  in 
the  treatment  of  BPD  symptoms  of  antidepressant  drugs, 
including  selective  serotonin  (SSRIs)  and  serotonin  and 
norepinephrine (SNaRI) reuptake inhibitors, administered as 
monotherapy or added on to psychotherapy. 

Duloxetine.  This  is  a  potent  SNaRI  mainly  used  for  the 
treatment  of  the  major  depressive  disorder,  diabetic  neuro-
pathic  pain,  stress  urinary  incontinence,  and  generalized 
anxiety  disorder  [64].  It  can  be  effective  not  only  in  the 
treatment  of  mood  disorders,  or  panic  disorder  but  also  of 
several  clusters  of  BPD  symptoms  [65].  In  an  open  trial  of 
12 weeks, a total sample of 14 BPD patients was treated with 
duloxetine at a daily dose of 60 mg, with statistically signifi-
cant  improvements  observed  in  clinical  status,  overall  psy-
chopathology,  and  depression.  Duloxetine  appeared  to  be 
selectively effective on  impulsivity  and affective dysregula-
tion (outbursts of anger, affective instability). It could also be 
an effective treatment for its positive effects on BPD patients 
with  somatic  symptoms  [66].  However,  further  studies  fo-
cused  on  duloxetine  treatment  are  needed  in  patients  with 
BPD to better assess its efficacy and tolerability.

Fluoxetine. This antidepressant  can enhance serotoniner-
gic neurotransmission through potent and selective inhibition 
of the neuronal reuptake of serotonin [67]. In the pharmacol-
ogical treatment of BPD patients, fluoxetine has proven to be 
effective  in  impulsive  lack  of  control,  decreasing  impulsiv-
ity, self-injury behaviors, and sensitivity to rejection [68]. It 
could  reduce  aggressive  behaviors  in  BPD  patients  more 
effectively in men compared to women. Fluoxetine pharma-
cological effects were also assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose – 
positron 
imaging. 
Changes  in  the  right  orbital  frontal  cortex  regional  cerebral 
blood flow (rCBF) correlated with aggression improvement, 
with an indirect correlation between the medial right tempo-
ral  and  orbital-frontal  cortices  rCBF  [69].  Improvements  in 
the  general  clinical  status  of  BPD  patients  were  also  ob-
served,  with  the  administration  of  fluoxetine  for  6  months 
and a daily dose ranging from 5 to 40 mg. The most respon-
sive symptoms to the fluoxetine treatment appeared to be the 
sensitivity  to  rejection,  anger,  depressed  mood,  mood  insta-
bility,  irritability,  anxiety,  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms, 
and  impulsivity  (including  substance  use  and  overeating) 
[70]. 

(FDG-PET) 

The efficacy of fluoxetine administered at a dosage of 40 
mg per day has been further studied on BPD patients in a 12-
week, randomized, double-blind study, added on to dialecti-
cal  behavior  therapy  (DBT)  as  compared  to  placebo  and 

DBT  (a  4-month  therapy  was  designed).  In  respect  to  base-
line,  this  study  suggested  that  fluoxetine  added  on  to  DBT 
does not correlate with any additional improvement as com-
pared to placebo and DBT [71]. 

Treatment  of  BPD  with  fluoxetine  administered  for  8 
weeks  correlated  with  significant  improvements  in  general 
severity  of  psychopathology,  distress,  and  psychotic  symp-
toms  (e.g.,  paranoid  ideation).  A  decrease  in  impulsiveness 
may also occur [72]. Administered up to dosages of 60 mg, 
fluoxetine  has  proven  to  be  effective  on  the  general  symp-
toms  profile  of  the  disorder,  particularly  on  aggressiveness 
and  mood  symptoms,  with  ver  big  improvements  in  anger 
and depression. BPD patients receiving fluoxetine compared 
to those on placebo showed decreased anger and depression 
[68]. 

In brief, fluoxetine treatment can be effective for control-
ling anger, aggression, distress, paranoid ideation, mood, and 
global functioning in patients with BPD. Its effectiveness on 
aggressive  behaviors  might  be  because  patients  with  BPD 
may exhibit aggression during states of deflected mood. 

Flupentixol.  This  antidepressant  drug  has  similar  affini-
ties with dopamine D2,  D1 , and 5-HT2A receptors and inter-
acts  with  5-HT2A and  D1 receptors  [73].  The  dual  dopa-
minergic-noradrenergic  action  can  be  most  effective  in  im-
proving  depressed  mood,  fatigue,  low  energy,  and  other 
symptoms  of  major  depressive  disorder  [74,75].  In  a  pro-
spective,  open  study  on  subjects  with  BPD,  8  weeks  of 
treatment with a low daily dose of flupentixol (3 mg) follow-
ing a titration schedule with added-on procyciclidine for pre-
vention of extrapyramidal side effects, there were significant 
improvements  in  general  psychopathology  and  impulsivity 
symptoms  [76].  These  improvements  could  be  ascribed  to 
the  neuroleptic  effects  and  serotonergic  affinities  of  flupen-
tixol. 

Fluvoxamine. This drug facilitates serotonergic transmis-
sion via potent and selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake 
into the presynaptic neurons. The overall antidepressant effi-
cacy of fluvoxamine administered at a daily dosage of 100–
300 mg for a period of 4–6 weeks has proven to be as effec-
tive  as  different  tricyclic  antidepressants,  including  imi-
pramine,  clomipramine,  and  desipramine  [77].  Its  effective-
ness has been demonstrated in the treatment of depression in 
patients  with  obesity,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  and 
bulimia nervosa, which in some cases can be comorbid with 
BPD  [78],  and  its  use  has  been  suggested  for  treating  BPD 
symptoms [79]. Fluvoxamine proved to be effective in treat-
ing rapid mood shifts in BPD, with the main effect arising in 
the  first  6  weeks  of  treatment,  but  there  was  a  lack  of  effi-
cacy in the treatment of impulsivity and aggressive behaviors 
[80]. 

Venlafaxine.  This  SNaRI  also  interacted  very  weakly 
with  dopamine  receptors  [81]  and  proved  to  be  most  effec-
tive  for  depressive  episodes  without  psychotic  features  that 
showed resistance to the standard pharmacological treatment 
[82].  Considering  its  possible  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of 
various BPD aspects, venlafaxine has been tested in patients 
with BPD who showed somatic symptoms and self-injurious 
behavior. It has been studied with  an  initial daily dosage of 
75 mg divided into two administrations, with increases of 75 

Drug Treatments in Borderline Personality Disorder

mg each 3-7 days for 12 weeks, showing a significant reduc-
tion of somatic symptoms and self-injurious behavior [83]. 

4.3. Antiepileptics 

The  most  studied  antiepileptic  drugs  in  the  treatment  of 
BPD  are  valproic  acid,  lamotrigine,  topiramate,  gabapentin, 
and carbamazepine. 

Valproate.  This  drug  acts  with  the  blockade  of  voltage-
gated  sodium  channels  and  increases  the  brain  levels  of 
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which contributes to its 
anti-manic  effect.  Several  studies  focused  on  its  use  in  the 
treatment  of  BPD  patients.  Stein  and  colleagues  performed 
one  of  the  first  studies  in  1995.  This  8-week  open  trial  on 
BPD patients showed a significant decrease in overall symp-
toms  as  well  as  in  irritability  [84].  Another  open-label  trial 
showed  that  valproate  could  be  an  effective  treatment  for 
impulsive  and  aggressive  symptoms  in  some  patients  who 
did not respond to other agents, including serotonergic anti-
depressants [85]. Similar results emerged from Frankenburg 
and  Zanarini’s  double-blind  6-month  RCT  on  30  women, 
who showed valproate-related improvements in interpersonal 
sensitivity  and  anger/hostility,  as  well  as  overall  aggression 
[86].  In  addition,  other  studies  demonstrated  a  reduction  in 
impulsive  aggression  and  irritability  in  BPD  [87,88].  More 
recently,  Bozzatello  and  colleagues  conducted  a  24-week 
follow-up  study  after  a  previous  12-week  randomized  trial, 
in  which  they  compared  the  efficacy  of  omega-3  fatty  acid 
added  on  to  valproic  acid  vs.  valproic  acid  monotherapy  in 
BPD.  The  positive  effects  of  combination  therapy  emerged, 
in particular, on some characteristic symptoms of BPD, such 
as impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol, explosions of anger, and 
self-harm. In the long term, the combined therapy has proven 
to  be  significantly  effective  in  the  treatment  of  outbursts  of 
anger.  This  allows  the  observation  that  the  choice  of  the 
combination  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  and  valproic  acid  as  an 
effective  long-term  therapy  would  be  justified  only  when 
anger  behaviors  are  the  main  feature  of  the  disorder  [89]. 
However,  treatment  with  valproate  in  addition  to  DBT  has 
not  proved  more  effective  than  DBT  alone  [90],  which  em-
phasizes  the  importance  of  psychological  interventions  in 
BPD. In conclusion, the use of valproic acid in patients with 
BPD  has  demonstrated  its  effectiveness,  especially  in  con-
trolling the symptoms of irritability and aggression. There is 
a need for further  controlled studies  to determine which pa-
tients are most likely to benefit from this drug and open the 
way to personalized treatment strategies. 

Lamotrigine.  Lamotrigine  is  a  sodium  channel-blocking 
antiepileptic drug. The mechanism of action by which lamo-
trigine is able to treat bipolar disorder has not yet been fully 
clarified;  however,  the  blocking  of  voltage-gated  sodium 
channels  is  believed  to  be  implicated  in  some  way.  Some 
studies investigated its use as a mood stabilizer in BPD. Tritt 
and colleagues [91] conducted an 8-week, double-blind RCT 
in  27  BPD  women,  showing  significant  improvements  in 
symptoms of anger and anger traits. In the same direction are 
the  results  of  another,  albeit  preliminary,  12-week,  double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  study  of  BPD  patients  with  possi-
ble  comorbid  anxiety  or  major  depressive  disorders.  Fur-
thermore,  lamotrigine  was  found  to  be  effective  in  treating 
affective  instability  and  general  impulsivity  [92].  Similarly, 

an  18-month  follow-up  study  showed  that  lamotrigine  was 
more  effective  than  a  placebo  in  treating  the  dimension  of 
aggression, specifically regarding the intensity and threshold 
of the perceived feeling of anger [93]. However, a  more re-
cent 52-week, two-arm, double-blind, large-scale multicenter 
RCT  comparison  of  lamotrigine  versus  placebo  in  BPD  pa-
tients  failed  to  show  significant  superiority  of  lamotrigine 
[94].  This  evidence  underlines  that  lamotrigine  is  not  clini-
cally  or  more  costly  effective  than  the  usual  care  in  BPD 
subjects  [94,95].  In  brief,  although  several  studies  showed 
that lamotrigine had shown evidence of efficacy in reducing 
aggressive  symptoms,  affective  lability,  and  impulsivity  in 
BPD, the most extensive study failed to find any effect at all. 
At  this  point,  therefore,  clinicians  should  hesitate  to  pre-
scribe  this  agent  while  waiting  for  further  studies  to  clarify 
its efficacy. 

Topiramate. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug that acts 
by blocking the voltage-sensitive sodium channels; this leads 
to  an  inhibition  of  glutamate  release  and  to  an  increase  of 
GABA neurotransmission. Furthermore, topiramate acts as a 
carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitor.  Topiramate  has  proven  to  be 
effective  in  reducing  BPD  symptoms  in  the  main  studies 
included  in  this  review.  Nickel  and  colleagues  conducted  a 
double-blind RCT on 42 men with BPD, demonstrating that 
topiramate treatment induced an improvement of symptoms, 
as well  as weight  loss. Topiramate  appeared to be  an effec-
tive  agent  mainly  in  the  treatment  of  anger  in  BPD  [96].  A 
second  paper  by  the  same  authors  described  a  follow-up 
study  on  the  same  group  of  patients,  who  were  assessed 
every 6 months for 18 months. The topiramate group showed 
an even greater improvement than the placebo group in BPD 
symptoms,  and  weight  loss  persisted  even  after  18  months 
[97].  Another  placebo-controlled  RCT  on  29  women  with 
BPD showed improvements in overall symptoms and weight 
loss  [98].  A  fourth  placebo-controlled  RCT  was  performed 
on  28  women  with  BPD  treated  with  topiramate  vs.  28  on 
placebo. This study demonstrated a significant improvement 
in somatization symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, 
hostility,  phobic  anxiety,  and  global  severity  of  symptoms. 
There  was  a 
treating  obsessive-
compulsive  symptoms,  depression,  paranoid  ideation,  and 
psychoticism.  With  regard  to  interpersonal  problems,  there 
was an improvement in overly autocratic, competitive, intro-
verted, and expressive symptoms. Weight loss was addition-
ally observed [99]. The topiramate has proven to be effective 
in treating overall symptoms, except psychoticism, in a sub-
sequent follow-up study [100]. All of these studies had rela-
tively small samples but suggested that topiramate could be a 
valid option in the treatment of BPD. Large-scale studies are 
needed to reach a firm conclusion.

Gabapentin. Gabapentin is a leucine analog that binds to 
voltage-sensitive calcium channels, closing them and dimin-
ishing excessive neuronal activity and release of neurotrans-
mitters.  A  6-month  open-label,  multicenter  trial  demon-
strated  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  gabapentin  on  BPD 
symptoms  at  a  daily  dose  of  1200–3200  mg.  This  drug 
proved to be effective  in  treating anxiety,  affective  instabil-
ity,  and  depressive  symptoms  in  BPD  patients,  although  it 
was often combined with other concomitant treatments (47% 
anxiolytics;  27%  antidepressant;  13%  antipsychotics)  [101]. 
Gabapentin  may  be  a  promising  therapeutic  approach  for

treating some BPD symptoms, but there is a need for further 
studies to confirm these findings. 

Carbamazepine.  Carbamazepine  is  an  antiepileptic  drug 
that interacts with the open conformation of voltage-sensitive 
sodium channels by blocking  them  and inhibiting glutamate 
release.  It  is  widely  used  in  psychiatry,  mainly  in  the  treat-
ment of bipolar disorder for its antimanic activity. However, 
a double-blind RCT of carbamazepine on BPD treated for 30 
days  showed  a  lack  of  efficacy  in  treating  BPD  symptoms 
[102]. 

4.4. Other Drugs 

Memantine. This is a channel blocker of the N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor that can regulate glutamate over-
activity.  Its  off-label  use  in  the  treatment  of  BPD  is  sup-
ported by the hypothesis of glutamate dysregulation and ex-
citotoxicity  of  BPD  core  symptoms  [103].  To  date,  only  a 
double-blind placebo-controlled  RCT  showed that  a dose of 
20 mg of memantine per day added on to another usual drug 
treatment  was  well  tolerated  and  improved  BPD  symptoms 
[104]. Given the existence of only one study, further research 
is  needed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  memantine  compared  to 
placebo and other treatments in patients with BPD. 

Naloxone/naltrexone.  Naloxone  and  naltrexone  have 
proven  some  effectiveness  in  BPD.  Dissociation  was  less 
severe under naltrexone than under placebo [105,106], which 
gives indirect support to the hypothesis that naltrexone might 
reduce  dissociative  symptoms  in  patients  with  BPD.  With 
regard to naloxone, there is evidence of a lack of efficacy of 
naloxone in  BPD. A single dosage of 0.4 mg was not supe-
rior  to  a  placebo  for  the  treatment  of  acute  dissociation  in 
BPD patients [107]. These inconsistencies could be ascribed 
to differences in study designs and small sample sizes. 

Nalmefene. This is an antagonist of opioid µ and δ recep-
tors  and  a  partial  agonist  of  κ  receptors.  An  8-week  open 
study on patients with BPD and comorbid alcohol use disor-
der  showed  that  the  treatment  with  nalmefene  was  safe  and 
effective  in  improving  BPD  global  symptomatology,  self-
injurious  behavior,  symptoms  of  alcohol  consumption,  and 
binge eating [108]. 

Baclofen.  Baclofen  is  a  γ  amino-butyric  acid  type  B  re-
ceptor  agonist.  It  was  used  to  treat  spasticity  and  alcohol 
dependence. The only study focused on BPD suggested that 
the  use  of  high  doses  of  baclofen  in  patients  with  BPD  and 
alcohol  dependence  is  associated  with  enhanced  neuropsy-
chiatric  concerns [109] so that alternative  treatments should 
be considered. 

Clonidine. A study on women with BPD and acute aver-
sive  inner  tension  with  the  urge  to  commit  self-injury 
showed that clonidine at a dose of 75-150 mcg improved the 
symptoms,  reducing  inner  tension,  dissociative  symptoms 
self-injurious  behavior,  and  suicidal  ideations  [110].  To  the 
best of our knowledge, this is the only study on this drug in 
the treatment of BPD, so there is a need for further placebo-
controlled studies with larger populations. 

Oxytocin.  Oxytocin  is  a  neuropeptide  produced  in  the 
magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic 
nuclei of the hypothalamus. It plays an important part in so-

cial  cognition,  social  behaviors,  and  fear  conditioning  [111, 
112].  It  has  a  role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  anxiety  disor-
ders through its involvement  in social attention, positive so-
cial  evaluation,  prosocial  behaviors,  and  anxiolytic  effects 
[113].  Anxiety  and  problems  in  social  functioning  are  key 
symptoms  of  BPD;  thus,  oxytocin  has  been  considered  a 
possible treatment. A pilot study demonstrated its effects on 
the  dysphoric  emotional  response  to  stress,  with  a  tendency 
toward  a  more  dampened  cortisol  stress-related  response 
[114]. Another recent study showed  that  intranasal oxytocin 
vs.  placebo  significantly  improved  affective  empathy  and 
approach motivation in BPD, indicating a favorable effect of 
a  single  dose  in  women  with  BPD,  adjusting  their  social 
functioning  similarly  to  healthy  controls  [115].  An  interest-
ing  point  of  view  is  that  dysfunction  in  social  interactions 
can be a  major issue of BPD. Treatment with oxytocin may 
be  effective  for  this  aspect  and  consequently  on  other  BPD 
symptoms.  However,  there  is  still  a  paucity  of  evidence  of 
efficacy, and further studies with larger samples are needed.  
Omega-3  fatty  acids.  Omega-3  polyunsaturated  fatty  ac-
ids  are α -linolenic  acid  (ALA;  18:3  ω-3),  stearidonic  acid 
(SDA;  18:4 ω -3),  eicosapentaenoic  acid  (EPA;  20:5 ω -3), 
docosapentaenoic  acid  (DPA;  22:5 ω -3),  and  docosahex-
aenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 ω-3). Many studies showed psycho-
logical  symptoms  improvement  with  omega-3  fatty  acids 
[116].  Polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  like  EPA  might  increase 
serotonin  release  from  presynaptic  neurons  by  reducing  E2 
prostaglandins;  DPA  might  influence  serotonin  receptor  ac-
tion  by  increasing  cell  membrane  fluidity  in  postsynaptic 
neurons; furthermore, marine omega-3 fatty acid intake may 
help prevent and modulate  the severity of brain dysfunction 
[117].  Treatment  with  omega-3  correlated  with  significant 
benefits  in patients  with depressive episodes, both with  ma-
jor depressive and bipolar disorders [118]. Omega-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids were associated with valproate for treat-
ing  patients  with  BPD,  and  this  combination  proved  to  be 
effective in treating impulsivity and hostility [119]. Further-
more,  ethyl-EPA  was  safe  and  effective  in  8-week  mono-
therapy  in  women  with  moderately  severe  BPD.  Patients 
treated with ethyl-EPA vs. placebo showed a significant im-
provement  in  overall  aggressive  and  depressive  symptoms 
[120]. Besides, there is a need for studies on BPD assessing 
the  efficacy  of  omega-3  fatty  acids  in  different  kinds  and 
doses, for longer periods of time and in larger samples. 

Yi  Gan  San.  Used  to  treat  Parkinson’s  disease,  Yi  Gan 
San has been used in Asia to treat symptoms of neurodegen-
erative  disorders  and  to  detoxify  the  liver.  Yi  Gan  San  pre-
treatment  protected  dopaminergic  neurons  from  the  damage 
of  various  neurotoxins  [121].  It  might  have  neuroprotective 
effects by inhibiting beta amyloid-induced apoptosis in corti-
cal neurons [122]. An open-label study on women with BPD 
showed  significant  clinical  improvement  that  occurred  over 
12 weeks of treatment in both clinician-rated scales and self-
reported questionnaires. Its effect was recognized at 2 weeks, 
with an improvement of overall psychopathology, depressive 
symptoms,  aggressive  behavior,  and  global  functioning 
[123].  These  effects  may  relate  to  possible  neuroprotection 
of dopaminergic neurons, which could be a therapeutic alter-
native and needs further investigation. However, the efficacy 
of Yi Gan San on BPD symptoms needs to be confirmed in

further studies that replicate the results of the only study per-
formed so far. 

CONCLUSION 

There  are  no  medications  currently  approved  for  the 
treatment  of  BPD.  Clinicians  should  carefully  assess  the 
benefits and risks of drug treatment in affected patients. Dif-
ferent  core  symptoms  of  BPD  could  respond  to  drug  treat-
ment in patients who did not manifest improvements through 
psychological  interventions.  Different  serotonergic  antide-
pressants  and  atypical  antipsychotics  can  be  safe  and  effec-
tive  for  the  treatment  of  mood  symptoms,  anxiety,  and  im-
pulse  dyscontrol.  Atypical  antipsychotics  can  also  be  useful 
in  the  treatment  of  psychotic  and  dissociative  symptoms. 
Specific  antiepileptics  can  be  useful  in  treating  mood  insta-
bility, impulsive symptoms, and anger in patients with BPD. 
The use of drugs belonging to other classes is not  indicated 
in the treatment of  BPD symptoms.  Considering  the hetero-
geneity of the clinical presentation, biological correlates, and 
possible  comorbidities  of  BPD,  and  the  different  mecha-
nisms  of  action  of  considered  drugs,  further  studies  are 
needed to identify specific personalized treatment strategies.
