Abstract

In recent years, the reality of global migration has brought the lack of understanding of mental
health needs across different cultures into sharp focus. Psychology programs are not up to date
on global issues and are often experienced as inadequate in preparing graduates to meet the
challenges of society today. The field of education and training in psychology has hardly evolved
since the last two decades. On the other hand, the mental health needs arising locally and globally
require a knowledge base and a set of skills future psychologists need to have in order to be able to
work and grow professionally. In addition, most psychologists in the western world are bound, at
some point in their career, to be in contact with immigrants or refugees to offer them services and
be a source of support for such a vulnerable population. Also, the field of psychology is
witnessing more movement among psychologists than ever before, whereby many professionals
move to another country, to work, volunteer, gain or provide training, consult and much more.
This requires a certain level of preparation, which psychologists need to be aware of and ready to
engage in before and after they move. This article highlights different psychology programs
around the world that include global mental health in their programs. It discusses essential
aspects and skills that psychologists need to learn to be prepared to work globally with various
populations and to expand their skills beyond service providing to more management and policy
work. Topics such as human rights and social justice, advocacy, health management and
policymaking are addressed as important competencies to be gained during the education
and training of future psychologists.

Impact statement

With the globalization of the mental health field, psychology programs are lagging behind
addressing in their curricula global events impacting the mental health of people and societies
worldwide. This results in inadequacy in preparing professionals to meet the diverse challenges
of society today. This article highlights the inclusion of global mental health in the training and
education of psychology. Future psychologists should be trained on subjects including human
rights and social justice, advocacy, health management, policymaking and leadership. These
topics are treated as important knowledge and competencies to acquire for the 21st century
psychologist. By developing these skills, future psychologists may apply their expertise to
advance the global mental health field improving services (access and equity) to benefit
communities located in various parts of the globe.

Introduction

The historical events occurring in the 21st century such as natural disasters (earthquakes,
hurricanes and tsunamis), man-made disasters (wars, conflicts and terrorist attacks) and epi-
demic and pandemic outbreaks (COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1) confirm the need to equip psych-
ologists and general healthcare workers to provide evidence-based, culturally relevant and
contextually appropriate mental health interventions focused on human rights and social justice
frameworks across the world (WHO, 2019; 2022; Bahar et al., 2021).

Integrating global mental healthcare into undergraduate and graduate academic programs is
crucial. Specifically in areas that require mental health professionals to work with under-
represented minorities and at risk groups from various backgrounds – migrants, neglected
populations, individuals enduring extreme trauma, survivors of man-made, natural disasters,
and human rights violations as well as living under the poverty line and low, middle-resource
communities (Murray et al., 2014; WHO, 2019; 2022; Meffert, 2021). The inclusion of global
mental health (GMH) disciplines and/or programs into the academic curricula would also aid in
developing psychologists and healthcare professionals’ skills. Among these skills, advocate for
social inclusion, propose and implement policies working in collaboration with governments and

organizations, coordinate capacity building initiatives, adhere to
international ethical principles in the field of psychology and
facilitate the development of sustainable holistic treatments taking
into account important contextual determinants (e.g., historical
events, economics, politics, environment, globalization and tech-
nology) to promote health and mental health (IUPsyS, 2008; Patel
and Prince, 2010; de Castro and McGrath, 2015; Kuruvilla et al.,
2018; Weir, 2020).

Global mental health

In addition to the historical events mentioned above, the global
threats to mental health indicated in the World Health Organiza-
tion’s (WHO, 2022) report are, “economic downturns and social
polarization; public health emergencies; widespread humanitarian
emergencies and forced displacement; and the growing climate
crisis” (p. 26). There are three bases of evidence supporting the
inclusion of GMH in the curricula of healthcare-related disciplines
(Rajabzadeh et al., 2021) and particularly in psychology (de Castro
and McGrath, 2015). First, the significant number of cross-cultural
and transnational research discussing inequities in the provision of
mental health care and the barriers to access mental health services
in high-, middle- and low-income countries (Patel and Prince,
2010; Patel et al., 2014). Second, the exponential increase in epi-
demiological research confirming the burden of mental disorders in
all world regions prior and after the COVID-19 pandemic (Rehm
and Shield, 2019; Nochaiwong et al., 2021). In fact, according to the
WHO (2019), “people with mental disorders experience dispropor-
tionately higher rates of disability and mortality” (p. 2). Third, the
evidence that there are effective pharmacological and psychological
interventions available for the treatment of mental health disorders,
and that general healthcare workers can prescribe the medications
and deliver the services (Patel and Thornicroft, 2009).

The advancements of the GMH field can be traced back to 2007
when the Lancet Medical Journal published a series of articles
focusing on the topic (Patel and Prince, 2010). In the mentioned
series, an action plan was drafted with the goal of scaling up services
based on human rights approaches and empirical studies to treat
individuals diagnosed with mental health disorders. In the decades
that followed Lancet’s call for action, the field of GMH gained
prominent visibility prompting the interest of psychologists and
healthcare professionals in diverse parts of the world. GMH became
an area of study and research supporting practices concerned with
inclusion, equity, human rights, and social justice and responsibility
(Koplan et al., 2009; Civitelli et al., 2020; Meffert, 2021).

GMH education

The WHO along with a commission of organizations and individuals
devoted to enhancing the mental health care across nations launched
the Mental Health Global Action Program (mhGAP) and the Move-
ment for Global Mental Health. The WHO has acknowledged the
mhGAP to be its “flagship” (p. 2) program in mental health. The
program provides evidence-based guidelines for the general health-
care professionals to treat specific mental and neurological disorders
in multiple settings (Patel and Prince, 2010). The conditions priori-
tized in the mhGAP program and assessed through the International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Eleventh revision (ICD-11; WHO, 2019) are depression, psychoses,
bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol and substance
disorders, suicidal ideation, anxiety disorders, epilepsy, dementia,

intellectual disabilities, as well as mental and behavioral disorders
observed during childhood and adolescence, and due to the exposure
to acute stress. While the WHO was proposing the mhGAP program,
a coalition of institutions and individuals was established to develop
The Movement for Global Mental Health program. The Movement
for Global Mental Health program was inspired by the success of the
HIV Treatment Action Campaign – their mission was to expand the
access to psychopharmacological and mental health treatment in
various parts of the world.

Heeding the worldwide call to move toward a more inclusive
and effective service model guiding GMH practices, and using the
examples set by Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Fron-
tières) and Partners in Health (Hixon et al., 2013), various schools
in the healthcare field (e.g., medicine, psychology, social work,
nursing and public health) decided to develop disciplines and
graduate programs in the area. The academic interest in GMH
has been on the rise especially in the USA and other developed
nations. The Centre for Global Mental Health in London focusing
on capacity building initiatives in GMH, the Master’s in Inter-
national Mental Health Policy, Services and Research offered by
the University of Lisbon, the Grand Challenge in Global Mental
Health led by the National Institute for Mental Health and the
Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (Patel and Prince, 2010), the
Global Mental Health Programs at McGill University, the Colum-
bia University Global Mental Health programs, Johns Hopkins
Global Mental Health program housed within the School of Public
Health, School of Medicine Yale Global Mental Health program
and the Master’s in Arts and the Doctorate programs in Inter-
national Psychology offered by The Chicago School of Professional
Psychology, training psychologists and other healthcare profes-
sionals to design and evaluate interventions in the GMH field based
on human rights and social justice frameworks are illustrated
(de Castro and McGrath, 2015).

The Caracas Declaration signed in 1990 was one of the most
important hallmarks to advance mental health services in Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC). With the support of the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO), LAC was tasked to build a
collaborative and interprofessional model of assistance integrating
mental health into the community and the primary healthcare
system (Mascayano et al., 2021). Based on a research coordinated
by PAHO (2017), the prevalence of mental, neurological and
substance use disorders in the Americas ranged from 19% to
24%, and 4% in Latin America. However, it is important to note
that the report focused on 12-month mental health illness preva-
lence studies from “the most representative community-based
survey of a country” (Kohn et al., 2018, p. 2). In addition, studies
reporting the prevalence of mental health disorders in Latin Ameri-
can countries are scarce and they vary considerably depending on
the design and methodology used. Therefore, the data presented in
the PAHO (2017) report may not reflect the reality of mental health
disorders in Latin America. The numbers may be even higher.
Despite these obstacles, the mental health services provided in
LAC significantly improved in the past 20 years incorporating
mental health in primary care and enhancing the access of mental
health care in the community (Caldas de Almeida, 2013; Sapag
et al., 2021). In Brazil, the Federal University of São Paulo
(Department of Psychiatry) offers opportunities, at the master
and doctorate levels, to conduct research studies in the field of
GMH (Jacob et al., 2007; Sharan et al., 2009; Thornicroft et al., 2011;
Oquendo et al., 2018; Marques et al., 2022). Nonetheless, formal
training and graduate programs in GMH, encouraging culturally
and contextually oriented knowledge, competencies, skills and

practices, are yet to be developed in South America (Rich et al.,
2018; Rich et al., 2020).

Competencies in the GMH field

Around the world, the discipline of psychology is discussed, stud-
ied, adapted and practiced within a multitude of contexts based on
diverse social, education, political, economic and legal norms. The
changes that are being made in the profession itself to address the
never-ending challenges of global societies (mental health illness)
reflect the development of academic programs, disciplines and
training to equip the professionals with international core and
specific competencies to conduct ethical work that is inclusive
and based on cultural/contextual practices
(de Castro and
McGrath, 2015; Morgan-Consoli et al., 2018; Stevens et al., 2018).
Countries differ vastly on the models of education and training
of psychologists (i.e., number of years, theoretical frameworks,
foundational literature, concepts, pedagogy, format of delivery,
learning outcomes and internship requirement).
competencies,
Considering the broad scope, in 2013 a task force committee was
assembled to identify universal benchmark competencies in the
field of professional psychology during the 5th International Con-
gress on Licensure, Certification and Credentialing. The conference
held in Sweden, Stockholm was by invitation-only and included
75 participants from 18 countries (e.g., Norway, United Kingdom,
Romania, South Africa, China, New Zealand, Colombia, Canada
and USA to name a few) representing five continents. The event
counted with the presence of important and prestigious global
associations in the field of psychology – the International Associ-
ation of Applied Psychology, the International Test Commission
and the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) to
support the development of a collaborative project with the goal to
produce a document proposing an international competence
model. Participants had access to relevant sources and material
presenting the current available models on competence for psych-
ologists prior to the first meeting and ran as an extended sequence
lengthy small group discussions.
of workshops consisting of

Planners and participants also agreed to broaden discussions
beyond local, regional and national differences to generate a mutual
understanding of psychological competencies. At the end of the
event, the task force committee proposed an agreement to establish
a multi-stakeholder international project – The International Pro-
ject on Competence in Psychology (International Association of
Applied Psychology and International Union of Psychological
Science, 2016).

is

To serve as the basis for a global professional identity in the field
of professional psychology, and potentially be recognized as a
universal system to assist with program accreditation, professional
credentialing and regulation of professional competence and con-
duct, the International Declaration of Core Competencies in Pro-
fessional Psychology (IDCCPP)
currently known as a
foundational document guiding the work of psychologists world-
wide. IDCCPP includes a preamble with working definitions of
commonly used terms to have a comprehensive list of the language
used within the declaration. It then lists the competencies that may
be both explicitly applied worldwide (ethical practices) and less
explicit but equally important (cultural humility). Following the
definitions, the document presents the clusters of competencies
based on psychological knowledge and skills underpinning the core
competencies as well as competencies relating to professional
behaviors and activities (Von Treuer and Reynolds, 2017). The
competencies proposed are not specific but rather general, encour-
aging organizations, communities and regions to accommodate
their local contexts as needed. Further, IDCCPP acknowledges that
adaptations and translations may lead to variations in educational
and training requirements across cultures and believe this will
capture the variety of richness and expression in the international
professional psychology field.

Recognizing the importance of training professionals working
in the healthcare field, Buzza et al. (2018) conducted a research to
identify relevant GMH domains and competencies required to
provide effective services in diverse parts of the world. Interestingly,
several domains introduced in the study are closely aligned with the
IDCCPP clusters and competencies (Table 1). Culturally informed
and contextually driven psychologists, and healthcare workers in

GMH, play significant roles contributing to enhance social inclu-
justice and
siveness, advocate for practices focused on social
advance policies protecting human rights. Yet, balancing compet-
ing needs (e.g., competence vs. cultural and social practices)
remains a challenge to expand the training in GMH (Khoury
et al., 2022). As the mental health crisis continues worldwide, the
field of GMH will need to increase the number of competent
professionals meeting the requirements to work in the mental
health area and ready to deliver mental health services in inter-
national contexts (Weir, 2020; Sapag et al., 2021; WHO, 2022).
Psychologists will need to reinvent themselves stepping outside of
the comfort zone of their own cultural frameworks and practices to
ultimately develop a flexible, humble and adaptative global identity
in order to provide effective services.

Humans rights, social justice and advocacy

Psychologists and general healthcare workers in the GMH field may
encounter situations involving unethical, unfair, bias and discrim-
inatory practices (Asanbe et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2018; Millum
et al., 2019). In order to offer transformative mental health services,
professionals should engage in critical self-reflection (e.g., one’s
own impact on others), nurture deep respect for cultures (e.g.,
cultural humility) and demonstrate a strong ethical commitment,
following the ethical principles included in the Universal Declar-
ation of Ethical Principles for Psychologists,
implemented by
IUPsyS, in 2008, as an ethical framework guiding the work of
psychologists in international contexts (Gauthier et al., 2010).

Studies have shown that worldwide, many individuals with
mental illness are isolated from society, and they are institutional-
ized for long periods of time with inhuman living conditions
(Thornicroft, 2006; Bonnie and Zelle, 2019; Millum et al., 2019).
They are also commonly forced into treatment without their con-
sent and without access to protect their rights. Some are even
denied their civil and political rights and are discriminated against
when it comes to citizenship, education, employment, transporta-
tion, housing and access to health care and the legal system. WHO
considers human rights violations of people with disabilities (phys-
ical and intellectual) to be an emergency in global health that needs
attention. Widespread human rights abuses are still observed in
mental health institutes, hospitals and in the communities even
after the 1960’s deinstitutionalization movement (Bonnie and Zelle,
2019; WHO, 2019; 2022).

In response to the abuses and violations, some countries have
started to integrate health, mental health and human rights into
medical education. To illustrate, The Health Professions Council of
South Africa has placed a mandatory human rights course in higher
education institutions (London et al., 2007) after the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission had identified that several healthcare
professionals participated in cruel and unethical practices with their
patients, despite their commitment (Hippocratic Oath) to safe-
guard their lives and to condemn methods violating human rights.
Creating health equity and adhering to ethical principles are com-
petencies expected and highlighted in the GMH domains (Buzza
et al., 2018), in the ICDDP (International Association of Applied
Psychology and International Union of Psychological Science,
2016) and the UDEPP (IUPsyS, 2008). In fact, psychologists and
healthcare professionals working toward health equity,
in its
broad sense (including mental health), are advocating for the right
for equal access to health and mental health services, on behalf
of underrepresented, vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals,

people and communities – e.g., low-income societies, refugees,
displaced, asylum seekers, immigrants, homeless, racial, and ethnic
minorities, LGBTQþ, individuals living with disabilities, chronic
and debilitating (life-threatening) disorders, statelessness persons,
among many other groups. As noted in the WHO’s (2022) report,
deficient infrastructure and poor access to mental health care are
significant structural risk factors associated with the development
of mental health disorders, whereas social justice, inclusion, inte-
gration and human rights-based care are considered protective
structural determinants.

Successful transformational change in GMH requires creating
innovative curricula in psychology and other related fields based on
human rights, social justice and advocacy models. This movement
is already observed in the fields of medicine psychology, social
work, nursing and public health, as several graduate programs
(discussed in the GMH education section) were launched integrat-
ing human rights, social justice and advocacy in GMH. Embedding
GMH into the academic curricula is a social responsibility (WHO,
2022). Psychologists and professionals in the GMH field can and
should propose innovative solutions to address the disparities
contributing to the GMH crisis, promote the determinants of health
and mental health, protecting the rights of people with mental
health disorders, engage in advocacy and social justice initiatives
to demystify mental health disorders and ensure that all are treated
with respect and dignity, encourage commitment and empower-
ment and combine efforts participating in interprofessional pro-
jects promoting capacity building to combat
stigma and
discrimination. The need to train new and senior health specialists
in the area of GMH throughout their careers has increased and will
continue to grow exponentially especially considering the ongoing
challenges around the world, and the WHO comprehensive mental
health action plan proposed for the next 17 years to invest in
transformational GMH (Bakshi et al., 2015; Weir, 2020; Rajabzadeh
et al., 2021; WHO, 2022).

Teaching health policy and health management

In 2001, the WHO released a report on World Health that focuses
on mental health. It suggested several solutions to the problems of
GMH including establishing national policies and legislation. In
fact, the WHO’s (2022) report put forward the inseparable links
between mental health and public health, specifically human rights
and socioeconomic development. This indicates that the transfig-
uration of policy and practice in mental health has a positive impact
on individuals, societies and countries at large. Thus, contributing
to mental health can improve the lives of everyone. The literature
has shown that the ideal approach to building capacity in global
mental healthcare will require partnerships amid professional
resources in high-income countries and encouraging health organ-
izations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Fricchione
et al., 2012). The result of these partnerships will be sustainable
academic relations that can instruct a new generation of primary
care physicians, psychologists and others, ultimately, health spe-
cialists. Researchers claim that it is a crucial educational component
to teach health policy and practice, in training and to promote
better intervention, prevention and strategies. Sola et al. (2019)
proved in her article that by looking at health policy through the
lens of academia, trainees were able to develop a new perception on
how health policy activities can contribute to teaching, publications
and leadership opportunities. When health policy was incorporated
into the teaching, students were better situated to integrate health

policy skills in their scholastic and professional careers as well (Sola
et al., 2019).

In the past 20 years, there has been increasing overlap between
the agendas of the government and the department of health, and
the aims of health psychologists in many regions in the world. This
has often included exploring factors behind behaviors and evalu-
ating interventions established and studied that aim to change
health behaviors for individuals, groups and the community
(Abraham and Michie, 2005). This most notably may lead to
additional funds for healthcare services, as interventions and strat-
egies for disease prevention and healthcare maintenance would
develop and become more efficient, reducing sickness costs. At
the community level, these strategies would also lead to more public
engagement and by extension trust in the healthcare system due to
greater and more comprehensive knowledge and awareness of
health. Such a process may then lead to an improved level of health
in the general community and to project developments aimed at
developing higher quality and more preventative services.

The synchronous systems model, a theoretical and clinical
approach that defines and includes individual differences in people
and settings, could support healthcare services and influence policy.
Within this model’s scope, cost effectiveness and medical efficacy
may improve and become more efficient, suggesting psychologists
may play a central role in the triage of medical services and
healthcare policies. Gregerson (1995, p. 1) explains: “The Syn-
chronous Systems Model provides theory, supportive data, and
clinical assessment devices to strengthen clinical psychology’s role
in medical settings.”

Further models since then have also been developed offering
more opportunities for psychologists to develop their roles in
treatment. For those models to be applied effectively, psychologists
must become more interdisciplinary, familiar with the healthcare
culture, expand and adjust their skill sets, maintain collaboration
with other health discipline as well as have a larger perspective for
advocacy (Johnson and Marrero, 2016).

Psychologists have been able to successfully change federal
statutes in the USA in the past 20 years. However, some obstacles
and limitations have remained clear. In an article published in 1995,
DeLeon and colleagues explained that Health Psychology was still
very often overlooked at the time and that clinical psychologists’
interventions were often prioritized. They continued: “federal
health policy decisions, including management of excessive federal
health spending will dictate the growth and opportunities for health
psychologists” (DeLeon et al., 1995, p. 493). A talk presented at a
conference on The Socially Responsible Psychologist – A Sympo-
sium in Honor of M. Brewster Smith, held at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, on April 16, 1988, was published in a paper
in 2021 (Kelman, 2021) again in support of the need for psycholo-
gists in policy. It discussed the socially responsible citizen when it
came to policymaking and speaking up and the similar concept of
the socially responsible psychologist. In line with that article, a
responsible citizen is one that brings independent judgment on
policy process and assesses policies with an independent view as per
their values, with the aim of citizens having a more active say in
government and determining policy. These aims intersect with the
role of the socially responsible psychologist, but distinctly psych-
ologists may bring an alternative perspective given their specified
knowledge and experience in their field, in the evaluation of policy.
Therefore, psychologists must meet their “citizen obligations” with
the added value of their knowledge to the essential role of changing
policies for the needs of the community in order to protect the
public (Kelman, 2021).

Finally, Friedman (2006) explains that for efforts to truly be
successful, effective and clearly understood, psychologists must
have a comprehensive understanding of policy, government and
research. For that he suggests more training for graduate students
that would include policy-related issues, an increase in interdiscip-
linary and transdisciplinary training and research and “by integrat-
ing the principles and concepts of complex adaptive systems within
research and training, and by diversifying research methods to
important policy and systems issues”
allow careful study of
(Friedman, 2006, p. 6).

When looking at the implementation strategy of such programs,
it is important to focus on applying hybrid designs for better
knowledge regarding the effectiveness of interventions in diverse
environments. Such designs and interventions target adaptability in
different areas, task division, supervision and training, along with
fidelity checks and looking into retention rates and follow-up with
participants (Meffert et al., 2016).

Recently, the limitations are also being addressed as some
universities opened a department for health policy and manage-
ment with courses dedicated to this field. This department does
offer courses that are available for students that are in psychology
graduate programs; however, they are electives. For example, in the
University of South Hampton, UK an international social policy
course exists within the program of Health Psychology. This course
exposes students to policymaking and planning, yet not specific to
health policy. On the other hand, other universities such as North-
western University, USA offer a master’s degree in health psych-
ology that includes a specific mental health policy elective. This
pattern also appears in several other programs in Europe, United
Kingdom and the USA.

Teaching leadership skills

Teaching leadership skills in graduate psychology programs is also
necessary since psychologists tend to find themselves serving lead-
ership positions in the community that they are not always pre-
pared for. Based on the APA ethical code of conduct, psychologists
are dedicated to integrity, justice, fidelity and responsibility in
practice, as well as the use of psychological knowledge for the
benefit of individuals and society (American Psychological Asso-
ciation, 2010). Teaching leadership skills during higher education
can support the future implementation of psychologists’ knowledge
in an informative way. Psychologists in training can be influenced
by learning the following fundamental leadership qualities: self-
awareness, congruence, commitment, cooperation, shared purpose
and handling conflict with civility (Kois et al., 2016). Leadership
activities enhance student training by developing professional iden-
tities, and organizational and communication skills that are vital for
service provision and advancement, as well as professionally with
colleagues. Various psychology doctoral programs, internships and
postdoctoral residency guidelines provide students with leadership
roles; however, there are still no explicit requirements for acquiring
such experience. Clinical psychology training programs and men-
torship beyond sole academic guidance are central to psychology
students’ journey to leadership development. This also allows for
opportunities for student involvement in departmental policies as
well as learning modeled leadership behaviors from faculty mentors
(Kois et al., 2016). Nonetheless, it is important to note that access to
education remains a barrier in the 21st century. In a study con-
ducted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), high tuition rate was identified as one of

6

the most important obstacles to achieve universal access to higher
education. Provision of funds (private and governmental) is crucial
to address this problem supporting the training of competent
professionals especially in LMICs (UNESCO, 2020).

Conclusion

It is necessary to acknowledge that the internationalization of such
a curriculum faces barriers that slow the process down, particularly
regarding the educators’ time limitations, enthusiasm and other
commitments that might get in the way of developing an inter-
national psychology course (Stevens and McGrath, 2017). Educa-
tors are encouraged to advocate for the internalization of the
psychology curriculum, as well as communicate its importance to
students, faculty and affiliated institutions. The goal of inter-
national psychology courses is to familiarize students with non-
Western research and phenomena while pushing them to critically
assess how global events affect psychosocial experiences.

Psychology education in the 21st century must provide psych-
ologists in training the knowledge and skills to fulfill the needs of
individuals and communities worldwide. Widening the curricula
scope to include social justice, human rights, advocacy and health
policy and management will be preparing the new generation of
psychologists to be GMH professionals who can offer their services
and expertise wherever they are needed, with cultural humility and
