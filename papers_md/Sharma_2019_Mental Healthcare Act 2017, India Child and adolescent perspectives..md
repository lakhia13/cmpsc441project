ABSTRACT

India has got a new mental health legislation, the Mental Healthcare Act in 2017 (MHCA). Compared to its predecessor 
the Mental Health Act of 1987, this act was purported to be more patient centric and rights  based.  Considering the 
significant burden of child and adolescent mental health problems in the community, it is essential to understand what 
this new act means for the mental healthcare of young people. This article presents sections of the act relevant to children 
and adolescents. We look at the provisions in the context of changes from the earlier act, concordance with other Indian 
legislations and with mental health legislations in other parts of the world.

Key words: Adolescent, child, Mental Healthcare, India, legislation

INTRODUCTION

A rights-based approach is the basic premise of the evolution 
of the MHCA 2017 that came into existence after the assent 
of  the  Honorable  President  of  India  on  7th  April  2017.  The 
act  is  in  concordance  with  the  United  Nations  Convention 
on  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities[1]  that  India  ratified 
in  2007  and  includes  a  dedicated  chapter  on  the  rights  of 
persons  with  mental  illness.  Children  and  adolescents 
constitute  approximately  40%  of  the  population  of  India. 
Recent  studies  have  reported  high  rates  of  psychiatric 
morbidity in this age group.[2,3] Access to mental health care 
for  children  and  adolescents  is  a  sensitive  indicator  of  the 
level of the development of a country.[4] There is a significant 
gap  in  addressing  the  mental  health  needs  of  children  and 
adolescents.[5] This article will explore the provisions of MHCA 
with  respect  to  children  and  adolescents,  in  comparison 
with  the  Indian  Mental  Health  Act  (MHA)  1987;  explore  its

concordance  with  other  existing  legislation  and  policies 
relevant  to  child  and  adolescent  mental  health;  compare  it 
with mental health legislation in other parts of the world; and 
discuss the strengths and limitations of the act.

PROVISIONS FOR CHILDREN AND 
ADOLESCENTS

Table 1 lists the provisions in MHCA 2017 that are relevant 
to  children  and  adolescents.  Alongside  the  provisions, 
we  highlight  their  practical  implications,  i.e.,  the  likely 
consequences  for  clinical  and  administrative  practices  in 
child  and  adolescent  mental  health  care.  In  keeping  with 
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,[6] 
MHCA considers all individuals below the age of 18 years as 
minors, like its predecessor, MHA 1987.

POSITIVE INITIATIVES FOR CHILD AND 
ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTHCARE

MHCA improves on its predecessors in terms of greater clarity

Practical implications

Table 1: Provisions for children and adolescents in Mental Healthcare Act 2017

All persons aged <18 years to be treated as minors

Only NR (parents/legal guardians) authorized to make ADs for 
mental healthcare of minors; no role for the minor

By default, parents/legal guardians are NR for minors
Concerned MHRB can appoint another individual as NR if the 
parent/legal guardian is found unsuitable. The concerned mental 
health authority, treating MHP, or any other person acting in the 
child’s best interest must bring this to the notice of the MHRB

Children under the age of 3 years cannot be separated from their 
mother while getting treatment in a mental healthcare institution 
unless there is any risk to the baby from the mother’s ill health. 
Even if the baby has to be separated, the mother will have 
supervised access. The decision to separate the baby has to be 
reviewed every 15 days, and the baby should be reunited with 
the mother at the earliest possible. If a baby has to be separated 
for>30 days, the concerned mental health authority must be 
informed

Inpatient treatment for minors requires the recommendation of 
two MHPs or one MHP and one medical professional. Consent 
only of the NR is needed. The minor has no role in this decision
Separate, developmentally appropriate facilities are to be set up 
for inpatient treatment of minors
Minors are to be admitted along with NR. Only a female 
attendant must accompany minor girls
Treatment and discharge require consent only from the NR
Admissions extending beyond 30 days to be reviewed by the 
MHRB

children  and  adolescents.  It  is  more  elaborate  on  inpatient 
admission  procedures  and  treatments  such  as  the  use  of 
electroconvulsive  therapy.  The  act  clearly  states  the  role 
of nominated representative (NR) (typically parents/guardians 
or state-appointed persons) in all aspects of decision making 

for  mental  health  care  of  minors.  The  NR  can  also  make 
advance  directives  for  minors.  The  NR  must  accompany  a 
minor  during  an  inpatient  admission.  A  novel  aspect  of  the 
legislation is mandating nonseparation of infant and toddlers 
from mothers getting treatment for mental illness unless there

separation at this young age can interfere with the nutritional, 
growth,  and  attachment  needs  of  the  child,  with  long-term 
consequences on physical and mental development. Another 
positive move is the decriminalization of suicidal behaviors. 
This is especially relevant in the case of adolescents who have 
high rates of self-harm and suicidal behaviors, which indicate 
the  presence  of  serious  psychological  distress  that  requires 
urgent  medical, 
intervention.  Till 
including  psychiatric, 
recently, the criminal perspective on and legal consequences 
of such behavior was a barrier to help-seeking.

MHCA 2017 VERSUS MENTAL HEALTH ACT 1987

Definition of mental illness
MHCA is conceptually clearer on the definition of “mental 
illness” [Table 1]. The MHA described a mentally ill person 
only  by  the  need  of  treatment  by  reason  of  any  mental 
disorder other than mental retardation, without any explicit 
mention  of  the  nature  of  mental  disorders.  Notably,  the 
exclusion  of  mental  retardation  from  the  definition  has 
been maintained in MHCA.

Admission and discharge procedures for minors
The MHA and MHCA both provide for voluntary admission of 
minors on request made by the guardian (MHA) or NR (MHCA). 
While the MHA required an evaluation of the minor only by a 
medical officer-in-charge to determine the need for admission, 
the MHCA mandates the examination by at least two medical 
professionals, at least one of who must be an MHP. Discharge 
of  minors,  on  request  made  by  the  guardian  (MHA)  or 
NR  (MHCA), is consistent across the acts. Provisions slightly 
differ in the scenario where a minor attains majority during 
inpatient treatment. The MHA stated that a minor who attains 
majority would be discharged from inpatient care unless he/she 
made  a  specific  request  for  a  continuance  of  inpatient  care 
within a month of being intimated of his/her having attained 
majority status, by the doctor in charge. Therefore, the MHA 
did  not  treat  the  admission  as  voluntary  once  the  majority 
was  attained.  The  MHCA  also  provides  for  the  discharge  of 
voluntary patients, but only on request made by the now adult 
patient. However, the provision for default discharge unless 
requested for continuation of inpatient admission is replaced 
by  the  provision  of  an  option  for  discharge  if  the  patient 
requests it. MHCA thereby ensures the rights, yet providing 
for continuation of care.

Separate inpatient facilities for minors
Section 5 of Chapter III of MHA 1987 proposed the setting 
up of separate psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric nursing 
homes, by the Central Government of India, for those who 
are  under  the  age  of  16  years.  The  MHCA  goes  a  step 
further to state that separate facilities are needed for all 
minors, i.e., under 18 years of age rather than 16. It does 
not specify if these separate facilities could be housed in 
the  same  compound  as  the  facilities  for  adults,  but  with 

separate enclosures; or they should be separate hospitals 
in themselves. MHCA also makes a mention that facilities 
for  young  people  should  suit  the  developmental  needs; 
however,  there  is  no  clear  definition  of  the  minimum 
standards required for such a facility. Box 1 presents our 
recommendations for a set of minimum standards required 
for a 20-bedded inpatient unit for minors. This template 
can  be  adapted  depending  on  the  age  and  diagnostic 
status  of  the  clientele,  and  the  population  prevalence  of 
psychiatric  problems  in  children  and  adolescents.  Some 
inpatient  facilities  go  a  step  further  in  having  separate 
for  older  adolescents.[7]  The  developmental 
setups 
needs  of  older  adolescents  are  different  from  those  of 
younger  children;  besides,  the  physical  size  and  acting 
out behaviors in older adolescents can be intimidating for 
younger  children.[8,9]  These  facets  reiterate  the  need  for 
mental health legislation in the country to provide specific 
recommendations for inpatient care settings for children 
and adolescents.

New mandates in MHCA vis‑à‑vis Mental Health Act
MHCA introduces several new mandates in comparison to 
the  MHA.  These  include  role  of  NR  in  AD  for  minors,  the 
provision  for  change  of  NR  if  he/she  is  deemed  unfit,  the 
provision	for	very	young	children	(≤3	years	of	age)	to	stay	
with their mothers getting treatment for mental illnesses, 
the  compulsory  requirement  of  NR  to  accompany  minors 
during  inpatient  treatment,  the  requirement  to  report  to 
the mental health review board (MHRB) within 72 h about 
the  admission  of  a  minor  patient,  and  the  prohibition 
on  electroconvulsive  therapy  for  minors.  Children  and 
adolescents are not merely little adults. The MHCA appears 
cognizant  of  this  and  accordingly,  is  more  explicit  on  the 
provisions for minors, compared to the MHA.

Sharma and Kommu: MHCA 2017: Child and adolescent perspectivesCONCORDANCE OF MHCA WITH OTHER 
LEGISLATIVE ACTS AND POLICIES IN INDIA

Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWD) came into 
force in 2016, i.e., before the MHCA. RPWD is also deeply driven 
by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with  Disabilities.[1]  In  the  area  of  mental  disabilities,  RPWD 
is a major advancement over Persons with Disabilities (Equal 
Opportunities,  Protection  of  Rights,  and  Full  Participation) 
Act, 1995 in encompassing a broad range of mental health 
conditions,  including  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  in 
its  ambit.  Thereby,  mental  retardation,  autism  spectrum 
disorders, specific learning disabilities, and mental illnesses 
are all eligible for disability evaluation and certification. This 
is an area where the MHCA falls short, in that it is unclear 
what is the stand of the act on neurodevelopmental disorders. 
Its  definition  of  mental  illness  excludes  mental  retardation 
and is silent about other neurodevelopmental disorders that 
constitute a substantial proportion of consultations in child 
and  adolescent  psychiatric  practice.  There  is  also  a  lack  of 
clarity  on  the  relation  between  guardianship  in  the  RPWD 
and NR in the MHCA. Further, while MHCA is quite elaborate 
in provisions for rights of mentally ill persons with respect to 
their health care and within MHEs, issues of social rights and 
discrimination find no mention in the act.

Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 
2015
The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 
2015  is  the  primary  provision  in  India  that  dictates  laws 
related to children in conflict with the law and children in 
need of care and protection. Section 15 of this act talks a 
much-debated  transfer  of  alleged  offenders  between  the 
age of 16–18 years to the adult justice system in the event 
of  heinous  crimes  and  if  so  deemed  after  a  preliminary 
assessment  of  the  adolescent’s  mental  and  physical 
capacity  to  commit  the  offence,  ability  to  understand  the 
consequences  of  the  offence,  and  circumstances  in  which 
the  alleged  offense  was  committed.  The  law,  therefore, 
deems it possible that persons aged 16–18 years are capable 
of “adult-like” decision-making processes, can be held fully 
accountable for their acts, and can be penalized like adults 
in  similar  situations.  Contrast  this  with  the  MHCA  that 
places  all  decision-making  authority  about  the  treatment 
and  care  of  minors  with  their  NR.  We  discuss  later,  how 
several countries in the world have moved toward greater 
in 
participation  of  minors,  especially  16–17-year-old, 
health-care decisions. To this extent, the MHCA contradicts 
its  premise  of  upholding  the  rights  of  young  people  with 
mental ill health.

National Mental Health Policy, 2014
India adopted the National Mental Health Policy (NMHP) in 
2014; this policy is meant to guide all actions to scale up 
the mental health programs and provisions in the country. 

The policy lays special emphasis on the mental health needs 
of vulnerable groups such as orphans with mental illnesses, 
children  of  persons  with  mental  illnesses,  and  children  in 
custodial institutions. Surprisingly, MHCA finds no mention 
of these vulnerable populations. The generic mental health 
needs,  administrative  processes,  and  manner  of  addressal 
cannot be directly extrapolated to these groups. There is a 
crying need for special consideration by the central mental 
health legislation in the country in this context.

COMPARISON OF MHCA WITH MENTAL 
HEALTH LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES

Participation of minors in healthcare decisions
MHCA  2017  places  almost  the  entire  responsibility  for 
health-care decisions for minors on the NR, i.e., the parent/
legal guardian unless otherwise specified. This implies that 
even	older	adolescents,	≥15	years	of	age,	cannot	take	an	
active part in healthcare decisions. However, the day they 
turn 18, they get all privileges available to a voluntary adult 
patient.  This  seems  quite  at  odds  with  the  understanding 
of adolescent development and the capacity of adolescents 
to appreciate their healthcare needs and take responsible 
decisions.  The  Indian  law  stands  in  contrast  to  western 
legislations that give young people substantial rights. In the 
United Kingdom (MHA 2007), 16- and 17-year-old have legal 
rights  to  consent  to  or  refuse  treatment  and/or  inpatient 
admission;  parents/legal  guardians  cannot  override  their 
rights.[10]  Similar  laws  exist  in  the  USA,  Australia,  Canada, 
New Zealand and other parts of the world. Further, statutes 
such  as  Gillick  competence[11]  and  the  mature  minor 
doctrine[12]  also  make  room  for  children  younger  than 
16  years  of  age  to  make  health-care  decisions,  provided 
that their capacity to consent has been ascertained. Gillick 
competence and mature minor doctrine are legal provisions 
in the UK and USA, respectively, whereby minors can make 
health-care  decisions  about  their  own  medical  treatment, 
without  the  need  for  parental  permission  or  knowledge. 
These provisions arose out of cases before the law in the 
1960s–1980s. Gillick competence, for instance, arose from 
a  decision  by  the  House  of  Lords  about  the  prescription 
of  contraception  to  minors  without  the  need  for  parental 
consent. It has subsequently extended to decisions minors 
can take about their other healthcare needs as well. The UK 
Department  of  Health  has  published  guidelines  for  young 
people to be aware of their rights to take an active part in 
health-care decisions.[13]

Mental health practitioners have to always act in the best 
interest  of  the  child.  Even  as  the  legislation  mentioned 
above recognize child rights, they also permit practitioners 
to  act  discretionarily  in  the  context  of  emergencies  or 
when  it  is  deemed  essential  to  disclose  information  or 
discuss  treatment  options  with  parents,  for  example, 
when there are aggressive behavior and imminent risk to 
the  minor  or  others.  This  breach  of  confidentiality  with

in the UK that outline circumstances and responsibilities 
in  every  context  where  personal  confidential  data  are 
shared.[14]

The WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation
The WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation[15] provides 
a framework for designing country-specific laws. Regarding 
the  items  on  this  checklist  that  are  relevant  for  child  and 
adolescent mental health, MHCA is up to the mark on the 
following accounts:
•	

It	 limits	 the	 involuntary	 placement	 of	 minors	 in	
mental  health  facilities  to  instances  where  all  feasible 
community alternatives have been tried
It	stipulates	that	if	minors	are	placed	in	mental	health	
facilities, they should have a separate living area from 
adults
It	stipulates	that	if	minors	are	placed	in	mental	health	
facilities,  the  environment  should  be  age  appropriate 
and should take into consideration the developmental 
needs of minors
It	 ensures	 that	 all	 minors	 have	 an	 adult	 to	 represent	
them in all matters affecting them, including consenting 
to treatment.

•	

•	

•	

However,  MHCA  falls  short  of  the  WHO  Checklist  on  the 
following accounts:
•	 Definition	of	mental	illness	does	not	explicitly	mention	
the act’s stand on the spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
disorders

•	 Minimal	 conditions	 to	 be	 maintained	

in	 mental	
health  facilities  for  a  safe,  therapeutic,  and  hygienic 
environment are not specified

•	 Levels	 of	 professional	 skills	 required	 to	 determine	 a	

mental disorder are not specified

•	 Categories	 of	 professionals	 who	 may	 assess	 a	 person	
to determine the existence of a mental disorder do not 
find a mention

•	 The	 need	 to	 consider	 the	 opinions	 of	 minors	 on	 all	
issues affecting them (including consent to treatment), 
depending  on  their  age  and  maturity,  has  been 
neglected completely.

A FEW MORE CONSIDERATIONS

In  the  above  text,  we  have  at  several  places  indicated 
the  shortfalls  in  the  MHCA.  We  want  to  raise  a  few  more 
considerations here.

Information and permissions from the MHRB
The  admission  of  a  minor  to  an  inpatient  facility  requires 
two  professionals  to  independently  opine  on  the  need 
for  admission.  This  is  likely  to  be  practically  challenging, 
especially  in  small  centers  across  India  where  there  is  a 
dearth of trained MHPs. This may also lead to an unwarranted 
delay in assistance to the distressed young person. The new 

act mandates prior permission of the MHRB for using ECT 
in  minors.  While  this  is  a  welcome  move  to  regulate  and 
monitor  the  use  of  ECT,  there  is  a  flip  side  in  that  delays 
in  approvals  may  impede  treatment  of  serious  conditions 
such  as  suicidal  risk  and  catatonia.  The  act  does  not  give 
any discretionary powers to the mental health practitioners 
in this regard.

Care of children of parents with mental illness
MHCA  has  come  up  with  a  novel  provision  for  infants 
and  toddlers  to  not  be  separated  from  their  mothers 
unless  there  is  any  risk  to  the  child.  Keeping  such  a 
young child along with the mother in a hospital setting 
is challenging, and especially so in psychiatric inpatient 
set-ups.  Other  disturbed  patients  could  pose  a  risk  to 
the  child.  In  this  regard,  MHCA  does  not  provide  any 
recommendations  for  mother-baby  units  in  psychiatric 
inpatient facilities. Mother-baby units have been started 
in  India[16]  and  have  addressed  risks,  infant  health, 
breastfeeding  disruption,  mother-infant  bonding, 
ongoing domestic violence, among other challenges that 
come  up  in  caring,  especially  for  postpartum  mothers. 
Older  children  and  adolescents  may  also  have  mental 
health  needs  when  either  parent  has  a  mental  illness. 
Depending  on  their  developmental  level  and  health, 
they may need specific psychological aid. Unfortunately, 
MHCA has not touched this aspect.

CONCLUSION

This  article  presents  child  and  adolescent  related 
provisions in MHCA 2017 and discusses the strengths and 
limitations of its provisions, in comparison with the older 
MHA 1987 and mental health legislation in other parts of 
the world. MHCA is more cognizant of the special needs of 
young people than its predecessors. However, it is limited 
in its scope of consideration about the rights of the child/
adolescent  to  be  an  active  participant  in  his/her  mental 
health care. The elaboration on provisions for admissions 
and  treatments  are  likely  to  increase  regulatory  control. 
We will learn about the clinical and practical implications 
and  utility  of  these  provisions  only  once  the  act  is  fully 
implemented.
