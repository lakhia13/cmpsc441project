Abstract

Although panic disorder has been frequently associated with increased suicidal ideation and 
behaviors, there are multiple explanations for this association in the literature. For example, some 
research has demonstrated panic disorder symptoms to mediate agoraphobia and suicidal ideation, 
while other researchers have hypothesized that comorbid depression symptoms contribute to 
suicidal ideation across anxiety disorders. Of note, none of these studies were completed in 
veterans, a population at higher risk for suicide relative to civilian samples. The present study 
investigated relations between the symptoms of panic, agoraphobia, depression, and suicidal 
ideation in 58 veterans diagnosed with panic disorder via correlations, hierarchical regression, 
and exploratory path analyses. Multiple models were investigated based on prior research. The 
final path model demonstrated that symptoms of panic disorder predicted agoraphobia symptoms, 
with agoraphobia predicting symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression, then, predicted 
suicidal ideation. Discussion of the findings related to comorbid depressive symptoms highlight 
considerations for the assessment and treatment practices for panic disorder, with a particular 
focus on veterans receiving care within Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.

persistent worries and behavioral changes related to occurrence of future panic attacks 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Panic disorder occurs in 2.7% of individuals in 
community settings each year (Kessler et al., 2005), with a 6.8% prevalence in community 
primary care settings (Kroenke et al., 2007). Panic disorder is associated with significant 
social, occupational, and physical disability, in addition to persistent general health 
complaints and poor perceived physical health (Hendriks et al., 2014; Rubin et al., 2000). 
Individuals with panic disorder demonstrate high healthcare utilization across primary 
care, mental health, and emergency room services (Bystrisky et al., 2010; Horenstein & 
Heimberg, 2020).

Despite studies examining both prevalence and functional outcomes of panic disorder in 
community settings, little research has been completed on panic disorder in veterans and 
military personnel (Barrera et al., 2013a, b; Gros et al., 2011). In general, panic disorder 
has been diagnosed in 6.1 to 8.3% of veterans across epidemiological studies (Barrera et al., 
2013a; Gros et al., 2011). Panic disorder is associated with severe physical health and mental 
health impairment and limited social functioning in veterans (Barrera et al., 2013a; Gros et 
al., 2011). Although innovative interventions for panic disorder are being investigated in this 
population (Hunt et al., 2022), the general understanding of the presentation and treatment 
of panic disorder in veterans has been limited, despite the significant associated impairment.

One area of particular concern is elevated risk for suicide in veterans with panic disorder 
(Barrera et al., 2013a). More specifically, Barrera and colleagues (2013a) found that 
veterans with panic disorder reported significantly more suicide attempts than veterans 
with posttraumatic stress disorder or neither diagnosis in a sample of 1700 veterans from 
Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. Given that the suicide rate for Veterans is 57.3% 
higher than that of non-Veteran adults (Kaplan et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2012; U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, 2022), the 
added risk associated with a panic disorder diagnosis is especially concerning and requires 
further investigation regarding factors potentially contributing to suicidal ideation.

Although increased suicide risk associated with panic disorder is well-documented (Nepon 
et al., 2010; Tietbohl-Santos et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021), there are several hypothesized 
explanations (Huang et al., 2010; Scheer et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2001). Schmidt 
and colleagues (2001) investigated the relations between demographic, diagnostic, clinical 
features, panic-related cognitive factors, suicidal ideation, and past suicide attempts in 
146 civilians with panic disorder. Despite multiple significant predictors associated with 
anxiety and panic symptomatology, mood pathology (comorbid major depressive disorder 
diagnosis and elevated depressive symptoms) was indicated as the primary contributor to 
the relation between panic and suicide, with the authors hypothesizing that depression 
mediates the association between panic and suicidal ideation (Schmidt et al., 2001). Huang 
and colleagues (2010) demonstrated that suicidal ideation was associated with younger 
age, current alcohol use, more severe panic symptomatology, and less social support in 60 
civilians with panic disorder. The authors found support for a mediational model linking 
poor social support to increased panic symptoms to increased suicidal ideation (Huang et 
al., 2010). Notably, this structural model did not account for symptoms of depression. And 
finally, Scheer and colleagues (2020) found that the general psychopathology factor, prior

history of suicide attempt, lower physical health-related quality of life, and higher number 
of stress life events predicted suicide attempts in a two-wave longitudinal study of 750 
individuals with panic disorder from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and 
Related Conditions, thus elucidating additional psychological and environmental factors that 
may contribute to suicidality.

The present study sought to replicate and extend the literature on panic disorder and suicidal 
ideation in a sample of veterans receiving care within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare 
System (VAHCS). The study used correlation analyses, hierarchical regression, and path 
analyses to investigate prior models and hypotheses in the extant literature (Huang et 
al., 2010; Scheer et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2001). More specifically, the goal of the 
present study was to attempt to partially replicate the model presented by Huang and 
colleagues (2010) in a sample of veterans with panic disorder, and to incorporate alternative 
hypotheses to improve the model if needed using existing theoretical models (e.g., influence 
of depressive symptomatology; Schmidt et al., 2001). Based on previous findings and 
follow-up hypotheses in studies of civilian samples (Schmidt et al., 2001), we hypothesized 
that depression would predict suicidal ideation, accounting for factors theorized to predict 
suicidal ideation (i.e., age, panic, agoraphobia, and social support). Based on correlations 
and regression findings, we conducted exploratory path analyses. In the final path model, we 
hypothesized that panic would predict agoraphobia, agoraphobia would predict depressive 
symptomatology, and depressive symptomatology would predict suicidal ideation.

Method

Participants

Procedure

The present data were collected via baseline assessments for an ongoing randomized clinical 
trial (NCT04293341). After screening the data, the final sample consisted of 58 veterans 
requesting evidence-based psychotherapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety at 
primary care and mental health clinics within a large Southeastern VAHCS. Study inclusion 
criteria involved: (1) competence to complete study consent and procedures, (2) meeting 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder, and (3) participant age of 18–80 
years old. Study exclusion criteria involved: (1) recent history of psychiatric hospitalization 
or a suicide attempt (≤ 2 months), (2) acute, severe illness or medical condition that likely 
will require hospitalization or otherwise interfere with study procedures, (3) recent start of 
new psychiatric medication (≤ 4 weeks), or (4) diagnosis of a significant psychotic disorder, 
personality disorder, or bipolar disorder based on medical chart review.

All procedures were approved by the VAHCS research and development committee and 
university-affiliated intuitional review board. Participants were recruited from October 2020 
to December 2022. Project staff advertised the study to local providers in the primary care 
and outpatient mental health clinics within the VAHCS. Interested participants were referred 
to project staff and scheduled for an intake appointment to complete consent documents, 
evaluate study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and complete diagnostic and self-report 
measures. All assessments were completed by the masters-level project research assessors,

with significant training in the ADIS-5 and supervised by the lead author. Additional study 
procedures were completed for the larger study, such as randomization to therapy condition, 
but omitted here as they did not pertain to the present investigation.

Measures

Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ)—The APPQ is a 27-item self-
report measure that assesses agoraphobia, social anxiety, and interoceptive avoidance (Rapee 
et al., 1994/1995). Items are rated on a 0 (“no fear”) to 8 (“extreme fear”) scale as “if they 
were to occur in the next week”, with sum scores calculated for each of the three scales. For 
purposes of the current study, the agoraphobia subscale was utilized to measure agoraphobia. 
Each subscale has been shown to have good internal consistency (αs > .85) and temporal 
stability (rs > .87) (Brown et al., 2005). Internal consistency for the APPQ agoraphobia 
subscale was good at .88.

Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule-5 (ADIS-5)—The ADIS-5 is a semi-structured, 
clinician-rated interview designed to assess a wide range of psychiatric disorders (Brown, 
2014). The ADIS-5 reliability and validity of depressive and anxiety disorder diagnoses 
(Brown, 2014). ADIS-5 reliability for the present study has not yet been calculated. 
However, studies from this authorship team that have used the same methodology in other 
studies have demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability for major depressive disorder 
(85.0%), PTSD (100%), and panic disorder/agoraphobia (100%) in 20% of independently 
rated interviews (Gros & Allan, 2019).

Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21-Item Version (DASS)—The DASS is a 21-
item self-report measure with three subscales designed to assess dysphoric mood, fear and 
autonomic arousal, and tension and agitation (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). All items are 
rated on a 0 (“did not apply to me at all”) to 3 (“applied to me very much or most of 
the time”) scale “over the past week”. Items are summed to create three subscale scores. 
The reliability and validity of the subscales have been supported in the literature (Antony 
et al., 1998). The DASS scales also have demonstrated excellent convergence with similar 
measures of depression and anxiety and high internal consistency (Antony et al., 1998). 
For purposes of the current study, the depression subscale was used to measure symptoms 
of depression. Although a second measure of depression was assessed (PHQ-9), the DASS 
depression subscale was selected to provide a measure of depression that was independent 
from the assessment of suicidal ideation. Internal consistency for the DASS depression 
subscale in the current study was excellent at .93.

Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey Form (MOSSS)—The MOSSS is 
a widely used 19-item self-report measure designed to assess social support (Sherbourne & 
Stewart, 1991). Responses are given on a 1 (“all of the time”) to 6 (“none of the time”) scale, 
with greater sum scores indicative of less social support. No timeframe is listed in the scale. 
The MOSSS has been shown to be an accurate measure of social support in veteran samples 
with mental health concerns (Price et al., 2013). Internal consistency for the MOSSS in the 
current study was excellent at .96.

Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)—The PDSS is a 7-item self-report measure 
for the frequency and distress of panic attacks and related symptoms “during the past 
week”, with items scored on a 0–4 scale (Shear et al., 1997). The rating scale varied 
across items, but with 0 representing no/none and 4 representing constant/extreme. The scale 
has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to change 
during treatment (Houck et al., 2002). Given the conceptual overlap between items 5 and 6 
of the PDSS and agoraphobia symptoms, these items were not included in the total score 
calculation for the PDSS. Internal consistency for the overall PDSS in the current study was 
good at .80 and acceptable at 0.76 when excluding items 5 and 6.

PHQ-9 – Suicidal Ideation Item—The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-reported depression scale 
derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire to assess the symptoms and diagnosis of 
depression “over the last 2 weeks” (Kroenke et al., 2001). The PHQ-9 has been shown 
to have good reliability as well as validity in clinical samples (Kroenke et al., 2001). In 
addition, the PHQ-9 has been incorporated into standard screenings at the VAHCS. The 
PHQ-9 item 9 (“thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some 
way”) was used to assess suicidal ideation. As with the other PHQ-9 items, this item ranges 
from 0 to 3 (“Not at all” to “Nearly every day”). This item has been shown to be associated 
with increased risk of suicide in veterans (Louzon et al., 2016).

Data-Analytic Plan

Spearman Correlations—Spearman correlations were calculated to examine 
associations between suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9), social support (MOSSS), 
agoraphobia (APPQ agoraphobia subscale), depression (DASS), panic symptoms (PDSS 
excluding items 5 and 6 given their conceptual overlap with APPQ items), and age. 
Spearman correlations were calculated in JASP.

Hierarchical Regression—To examine predictors of suicidal ideation, panic symptoms, 
agoraphobia, social support, depression, and age were simultaneously entered into a 
multiple regression model to determine whether panic, agoraphobia, social support, and 
age explained variance in suicidal ideation in a model including depression symptoms. Like 
Spearman correlations, regression models were calculated in JASP.

Path Analyses—After calculating Spearman correlations and conducting regression 
analyses, we planned to attempt to partially replicate the path analysis reported in Huang 
and colleagues (2010), except for the alcohol use variable given that the current study did 
not include a measure of alcohol use. Specifically, age, social support, and panic symptoms 
were modeled as predictors of suicidal ideation. Panic symptoms were modeled to predict 
agoraphobia, and social support was modeled to predict panic symptoms.

The remaining two calculated models were exploratory path analyses based on correlations, 
regression results, model statistics from the original path model, and extant literature in 
attempt to create a more parsimonious and good-fitting model. For the second path model, 
social support, panic, and agoraphobia were modeled to predict depression symptoms. Panic 
was modeled to predict agoraphobia symptoms, and depression was modeled to predict

suicidal ideation. The third and final model modeled panic as a predictor of agoraphobia, 
agoraphobia as a predictor of depression, and depression as a predictor of suicidal ideation. 
Regarding fit indices to measure overall model fit, we used root mean square error of 
approximation (RMSEA; Steiger, 1998), comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), and 
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; Hu & Bentler, 1999) based on the analytic 
approach taken in Weber et al. (2020). As discussed in Weber et al. (2020), smaller values 
(i.e., < .06) are more desirable for both RMSEA and SRMR, with higher values (i.e., closer 
to 1) ideal for CFI. For all path models, standardized path coefficients are reported. Path 
analyses were analyzed using the lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012).

Results

Demographic Characteristics

In participants with less than 5% of their data missing across all measures, missing data 
was imputed (except for the suicidal ideation measure given that this included a single item) 
using the mice package in R (Van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). The final sample 
consisted of 58 Veterans with a diagnosis of panic disorder. For most Veterans (81.0%), 
the diagnosis of panic disorder was principal, with the most common remaining principal 
diagnoses including major depressive disorder (15.5%). Comorbidity among the sample 
was also common, with 96.6% of participants meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one 
additional psychiatric disorder. Regarding demographic characteristics, participants were 
primarily middle-aged adults (Mage = 44.7, SDage = 12.8). Approximately half (55.2%) were 
White, with most remaining identifying as Black/African American (41.4%). Participants 
were primarily male (70.7%), married (60.3%), employed full-time (44.8%), and had a 
high school diploma (46.6%). Most veterans reported having a service-connected disability 
(86.2%), and around half reported serving in the Army (46.6%).

Spearman Correlations and Hierarchical Regression

Spearman correlations are presented in Table 1. Overall, the regression model was 
significant, F(5, 52) = 4.41, p = .002, Adjusted R2 = .23. As presented in Table 2, panic 
symptoms, agoraphobia, age, and social support did not predict suicidal ideation (all ps 
> .05). Depression (β = 0.48, p = .001) was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation, 
such that higher levels of depression were associated with greater suicidal ideation. Overall, 
results indicated that, in a model accounting for depression symptoms, none of the other 
predictors were significant.

Path Analyses

The fit indices for all investigated models are presented in Table 3. Standardized path 
coefficients between social support and suicidal ideation, social support and panic, and panic 
and suicidal ideation were non-significant for the initial model adapted from Huang and 
colleagues (2010). Standardized path coefficients between age and suicidal ideation (−.28) 
and panic and agoraphobia (.44) were significant at the p < .05 level. This means that 
suicidal ideation decreased as age increased and agoraphobia increased as panic increased. 
Overall, as presented in Table 3, this proposed model did not fit the data. See Fig. 1 for this 
model.

Based on results obtained from correlational data, the regression model, and theoretical 
work, we explored an updated path model accounting for depression. In the second model, 
social support, panic, and agoraphobia were modeled to predict depression symptoms. 
Panic predicted agoraphobia symptoms, and depression symptoms were modeled to predict 
suicidal ideation. Standardized path coefficients between panic and agoraphobia (.44), 
agoraphobia and depression (.35), and depression and suicidal ideation (.50) were significant 
at the p < .05 level. Higher levels of panic predicted greater agoraphobia, and higher 
levels of agoraphobia were associated with elevated depression. As depression increased, 
suicidal ideation increased (consistent with regression analyses mentioned above). Overall, 
this model was a better fit to the data (see Table 3).

In the final model excluding non-significant paths from the second path analysis (namely the 
paths involving social support and depression and panic and depression; Fig. 2), the model 
remained a good fit to the data (see Table 3). Greater panic predicted higher agoraphobia 
(.44), while higher agoraphobia predicted greater depression (.49). Finally, higher depression 
predicted greater suicidal ideation (.51). Standardized path coefficients were all significant 
at the p < .001 level, and Fig. 2 presents a visual including standardized path coefficients 
for each path in the final model. Overall, results suggest that, in regression and path models 
including depression symptoms as a predictor of suicidal ideation, there were no other 
significant predictors of suicidal ideation.

Discussion

The present study investigated relations between symptoms of panic, agoraphobia, 
depression, social support, and suicidal ideation in veterans with panic disorder and 
various comorbidities. Although increased suicidal ideation is consistently associated with 
panic disorder (Nepon et al., 2010; Tietbohl-Santos et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021), 
the explanations for the finding have varied (Huang et al., 2010; Scheer et al., 2020; 
Schmidt et al., 2001). In the present study, the previously proposed model by Huang 
and colleagues (2010) involving panic symptoms as a mediator between agoraphobia and 
suicidal ideation did not fit the data. Based on the hypotheses of Schmidt and colleagues 
(2001), comorbid depressive symptomatology was incorporated to predict suicidal ideation. 
Incorporation of a model with panic predicting agoraphobia, agoraphobia predicting 
depression, and depression predicting suicidal ideation was found to be a good fit to the 
data. Further, in a regression analysis predicting suicidal ideation, symptoms of depression 
were the only significant predictor of suicidal ideation. Together, these findings help to 
explain the connection between panic symptoms and suicidal ideation, consistent with 
previously untested hypotheses (Schmidt et al., 2001) and contrary to previous models not 
incorporating depressive symptomatology (Huang et al., 2010), as well as expanding the 
study of panic and suicidal ideation to veterans, a population particularly at risk for suicide 
relative to civilian samples (Kaplan et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2012; U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, 2022).

The influence of comorbid depressive symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders has 
been highlighted in the literature in terms of elevated suicide risk (Bolton et al., 2010; 
Wiebenga et al., 2021). For example, depressive symptoms and perceived burdensomeness

have been shown to mediate the relation between anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation 
in undiagnosed adolescents with elevated suicidality (Hill et al., 2018). Similarly, symptoms 
of depression and anhedonia were found to mediate the relation between trauma and 
suicidal ideation in female veterans with military sexual trauma history (Blais & Geiser, 
2019). In combination with the present findings for panic disorder, comorbid depressive 
symptoms play a significant role in the presentation of suicidal ideation across anxiety 
disorders. These findings further highlight the need to incorporate measures for depressive 
symptoms alongside measures of anxiety to monitor symptom presentation and risk for 
suicidal ideation (Beuke et al., 2003).

Although not investigated in the present study, emerging research on transdiagnostic risk 
factors, such as anxiety sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty, also show promise 
for explaining relations between panic symptoms and suicidal ideation (Allan et al., 2023; 
Stanley et al., 2018) and are common in veterans reporting psychopathology (Clauss et 
al., 2023). For example, AS has been demonstrated as a significant risk factor in the 
development and maintenance of panic symptoms (McNally, 2002; Olatunji & Wolitzky-
Taylor, 2009) as well as significantly associated with suicidal ideation across studies 
(Stanley et al., 2018). In addition, there have been models proposed to explain the interplay 
between AS, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation across diagnoses (Capron et al., 
2013). Future research should consider expanding the present investigation to incorporate 
transdiagnostic risk factors, such as AS, to further this area of study.

The present finding also support the expansion of psychotherapy options for patients 
with anxiety disorders, which have been largely neglected in nationwide evidence-based 
psychotherapy dissemination and implementation initiatives to date (Ennis et al., 2023; 
Karlin & Cross, 2014). However, given the significance of comorbidity in panic disorder 
(which was also evident in the 96.6% comorbidity rate in the present study), the treatment 
options for panic disorder should be selected with comorbidity in mind. Previous studies of 
cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder demonstrated that diagnostic comorbidity 
was not associated with panic symptom outcomes, but that rates of comorbid major 
depressive disorder did not reduce following successful treatment of panic disorder (Allen 
et al., 2010). Specialized protocols designed specifically for panic disorder and major 
depressive disorder comorbidity have evidenced improvements in impairment and anxiety 
symptoms, but without improvements in depressive symptoms (Van Beek et al., 2013). 
Other studies found evidence for improvements in depression in most patients during 
psychotherapy for panic disorders, but noted their small size sample as a significant 
limitation (n = 22; Keefe et al., 2019).

Alternatively, transdiagnostic interventions may be indicated for addressing comorbidity in 
individuals with comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders (Barlow et al., 2010; Gros, 
2014). For example, Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy has been shown to be easily 
implemented in patients with panic disorder (Gros & Allan, 2019) and with diagnostic 
comorbidity (Gros et al., 2023), with potentially improved outcomes compared to disorder-
specific interventions (Coyne & Gros, 2022; Gros et al., 2019). Similarly, the Unified 
Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) has been studied in 
patients with panic disorder and with diagnostic comorbidity with significant symptom

improvements at post-treatment and maintained at 6-month follow-up (Barlow et al., 2017). 
Additional transdiagnostic interventions, such as Safety Aid Reduction Treatment (START), 
are under development specifically for veterans with anxiety disorders (Raines et al., 2023). 
Given these findings, transdiagnostic psychotherapies may be particularly well-suited for 
addressing comorbid symptoms of panic disorder and depression and, as a result, reduce 
the associated elevation in suicidal ideation given the connection between depression 
symptomatology and suicidal ideation.

The findings also have implications for suicide prevention strategies in veterans. As noted 
previously, this study extends the findings for suicidal ideation and the anxiety disorders to 
veterans, a population that is at elevated risk for suicide (Jobes et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 
2007; Miller et al., 2012; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Mental Health and 
Suicide Prevention, 2022). In addition to the many suicide prevention strategies delivered via 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (Tsai et al., 2020), these findings may suggest ways in 
which strategies could be more targeted to patients with anxiety and depression comorbidity. 
For example, veterans receiving care at a VAHCS will receive periodic clinical assessments 
for symptoms of depression, PTSD, alcohol use, and a suicide screen via a version of the 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (Katz et al., 2020). Based on the present 
findings, a brief measure of anxiety symptomatology or diagnostic assessment for anxiety 
disorders may add value in detecting at-risk veterans, particularly in those with elevated 
symptoms on the existing depression screen (Stevens et al., 2020). Although the PHQ-9 and 
CSSRS are effective in identifying active suicide risk, a measure of anxiety may identify 
additional at-risk patients as well as an alternative treatment focus specifically for anxiety 
symptoms.

The present study had several limitations that could be addressed in future research. 
The sample in the present study was small and may limit the generalizability of the 
findings, pending replication with larger samples of veterans sufficiently powered for 
path analyses. In addition, as expected in a veteran sample, most participants were male, 
limiting generalizability to community samples. Although selected to control for potential 
measurement bias between the PHQ-9 depression items and suicidal ideation item, the 
DASS depression scale does not assess all DSM-5 symptoms for depression (e.g., sleep). 
The parent studies excluded patients with principal diagnoses of substance use disorders, 
reducing the variability in the present sample and preventing investigation of the full 
model presented by Huang and colleagues (2010) due to the lack of a measure of alcohol 
use. In addition, the study temporarily excluded veterans with recent suicidal attempts or 
hospitalizations for a stabilization period of 60 days, which may have reduced the sample 
heterogeneity in terms of suicidal ideation. And finally, as noted previously, the present 
study sought to further investigate models presented in the literature for panic disorder and 
suicidal ideation (Huang et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2001); however, the models were not 
fully inclusive of all potential variables that may explain these relations, such as AS (Stanley 
et al., 2018) and intolerance of uncertainty (Clauss et al., 2023).

Conclusion

Page 10

The present study investigated the relations between panic disorder and suicidal ideation 
in veterans. Findings may shift the previous focus away from panic symptoms (Huang et 
al., 2010) and toward comorbid depressive symptoms as previous hypothesized (Schmidt 
et al., 2001), pending replication and extension in larger samples. The influence of 
comorbid depression highlights the need to adjust treatment practices (e.g., transdiagnostic 
psychotherapies) and assessment (e.g., addition of anxiety specific measures in VAHCS). 
Together, the findings may help to better understand the experience of suicidal ideation in 
panic disorder and in veterans, leading to improved assessment and prevention efforts.
