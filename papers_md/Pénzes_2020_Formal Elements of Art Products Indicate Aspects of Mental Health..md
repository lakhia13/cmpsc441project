Formal elements are often used in art therapy assessment. The assumption is that
formal elements are observable aspects of the art product that allow reliable and valid
assessment of clients’ mental health. Most of the existing art therapy assessment
instruments are based on clinical expertise. Therefore, it is not clear to what degree these
instruments are restricted to formal elements. Other aspects might also be included,
such as clinical expertise of the therapist. This raises the question of whether and
how formal elements as observable aspects of the art product are related to clients’
mental health. To answer this question, four studies are presented that look at: (1) a
meta-theoretical description of formal elements; (2) operationalization of these formal
elements so they can be analyzed reliably in clients’ art products; (3) establishment
of reliable and clinically relevant formal elements; (4) the relationship between formal
elements and adult clients’ mental health. Results show that the combination of the
formal elements “movement,” “dynamic,” and “contour” are signiﬁcantly interrelated
and related to clients’ mental health, i.e., psychopathology, psychological ﬂexibility,
experiential avoidance, and adaptability. These ﬁndings give insight in the diagnostic
value of art products and how they may add to clients’ verbal expression and indicate
their potential to beneﬁt from therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Art therapy is an experiential treatment in which the art form is therapeutically applied to initiate
experiences that allow processes of change, development, stabilization or acceptance that support
emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, neurological or physical aspect of functioning (American
Art Therapy Association [AATA], 2020; British Association of Art Therapists [BAAT], 2020). The
art form – the use of art materials in an art-making process resulting in an art product– is speciﬁc
and unique for art therapy treatment and for art therapy observation and assessment. Art therapy
approaches fundamentally assume that a clients’ mental health is expressed in the art form (Hinz,
2009, 2015, 2020; Haeyen, 2018; Abbing et al., 2019).

Art therapy observation and assessment is considered to be a key to estimate what the client’s
problem is, to determine whether a client may beneﬁt from art therapy, to formulate treatment goals
and to apply the appropriate art interventions (Hinz, 2009, 2020; Gilroy et al., 2012; Malchiodi,
2012). Several art therapy perspectives that draw from diverse approaches such as psychodynamic,
humanistic, behavioral, developmental and integrative approaches (Rubin, 2001, 2005; Jones, 2005;
Van Lith, 2016), have diﬀerent views and theories on how exactly the art form relates to mental

Formal Elements Indicate Mental Health

health. Most art therapists adhere clinical value to the art
products of their clients. They recognize in art products signs
of their clients’ mental health, as well as cues on how to
treat, i.e., what therapeutic goals and interventions should be
chosen (indication).

Testimonies of the clinical value of the art product can be
traced back to the beginning of the 20th century (Prinzhorn,
1919; Plokker, 1963). Already before WW II all kind of projective
drawing tests were developed pretending to provide insight in
unconscious psychological conﬂicts (Murray, 1943; Buck, 1948;
Naumburg, 2001; Simon, 2001; Ulman and Bernard, 2001). From
a psychometric perspective, these tests lacked reliability and
validity; it appeared impossible to unequivocally score an art
product in terms of content (McNiﬀ, 1998; Betts, 2006). The
focus subsequently shifted from symbolic content to the formal
elements of art products, such as “line,” “color,” and “movement”
as these were considered to be more objective (Gantt, 2001,
2004; Thomas and Cody, 2012). The underlying assumption is
that formal elements in an art product represent the way clients
interact with art materials in order to express themselves and
that they are related to clients’ mental health (Gantt and Tabone,
1998; Gantt, 2001, 2004; Hinz, 2009, 2015; Gilroy et al., 2012;
Nan and Hinz, 2012; Pénzes et al., 2014, 2015). Several art
therapy assessment instruments have been developed to measure
these formal elements and relate them to clients’ mental health
problems (e.g., Cohen, 1986/1994; Cohen et al., 1986; Hacking,
1999; Elbing and Hacking, 2001; Stuhler-Bauer and Elbing,
2003). However, these instruments have been subject to serious
psychometric critique regarding their reliability and validity. It
has been argued that the existing instruments use poor rating
methods (Nan and Hinz, 2012) and inappropriate statistical
procedures for measuring inter-rater reliability (Hacking, 1999;
Eitel et al., 2008; cited in Betts, 2006; Schoch et al., 2017).

The existing instruments also allow, and even need, subjective
interpretation based on art therapists’ own clinical experiences
with diﬀerent client groups and diﬀerent training orientations
(Betts, 2006; Eitel et al., 2008; Schoch et al., 2017). This
introduces all manner of interpretations, which can negatively
aﬀect the reliability. We still do not know to what degree
formal elements as the unambiguous observable aspects of an
art product represent the mental health problems of clients or
how the clients cope with these problems. Critics of existing
instruments also refer to the wide range of opinions regarding
how formal elements should be interpreted in terms of mental
health (Pénzes et al., 2018). Due to these shortcomings we still
do not know whether or not art products can be used for
diagnostic and indicative purposes. We know that the content of
the art product cannot be measured in a reliable and valid way,
but it is still possible that formal elements as the unambiguous
observable aspects of an art product represent the mental health
problems of clients. The aims of this study are to deﬁne formal
elements that can be operationalized and analyzed reliably
and are clinically relevant so their relationship with mental
health can be tested.

In this article, we report four studies that look at: (1)
a taxonomy of formal elements; (2) an operationalization of
these formal elements to analyze them reliably in clients’ art

products; (3) establishment of reliable and clinically relevant
formal elements; (4) the relationship between formal elements
and adult clients’ mental health (see Figure 1). We will make use
of qualitative as well as quantitative research designs.

STUDY 1: TOWARD A TAXONOMY OF
FORMAL ELEMENTS

In art therapy literature and clinical practice, a large number
and diverse formal elements were described as clinically relevant.
Even if considered as sign of the richness embedded in the clinical
practice of art therapy, this huge number did not help the growth
of sound empirical studies on formal elements. Aim of this ﬁrst
study was to clarify this complexity by returning to art theories
on formal elements. Formal analysis of art refers to the observable
pictorial qualities of art and is considered to be the most objective
way of analyzing art products (Acton, 2009; De Visser, 2010).

Method
To describe the formal elements, art theory literature was
reviewed and experts in the ﬁeld consulted to gain meta-
theoretical descriptions of formal elements. Art theories that
presented a complete systematic “form analysis” of visual
art were included, whereas theories that concerned only one
category of form, such as “line,” art history, art criticism, art
philosophy, neurology and art perception, and/or aesthetics were
excluded. As art theories cannot be found in scientiﬁc databases,
three other sources were used. First, existing textbooks on art
theory as found on the Internet and the university’s library.

Formal Elements Indicate Mental Health

Additionally, six experts in the ﬁeld of art theory, speciﬁcally
art analysis, were consulted by email for advice regarding which
additional art theories to include. These experts consisted of
teachers/researchers from the Netherlands, Germany, Israel, and
Finland. These experts were chosen based on their expertise in
the ﬁeld of art theory, speciﬁcally form analysis, and/or in using
formal elements in art therapy. Also, bibliographies of art therapy
literature regarding formal elements in assessment were searched.
All included art theories were incorporated into a comparative
content analysis to see which formal elements were included
and how they were described. We restricted our search to those
formal elements that could be appropriately be described in
two-dimensional art because this is mainly used in art therapy
assessment (e.g., Moon, 2010; Pénzes et al., 2014). We began
with four theories that incorporated a complete systematic “form
analysis” of visual art: Acton (2009), the KPC model (Gerrits,
2018), the ILO UvA model (Van der Kamp et al., 2012); and
Tate Modern (Gale, 2016; Wilson and Lack, 2016). Additionally,
the consultation of the experts led us to the theories of De
Visser (2010), Taylor (2014), Huntsman (2016), and Boermans
and van der Borght (2017). Eight theories were included in
further comparative content analysis: the ILO UvA model (Van
der Kamp et al., 2012), Acton (2009), the KPC model (Gerrits,
2018), Tate Modern (Gale, 2016; Wilson and Lack, 2016), De
Visser (2010), Taylor (2014), Huntsman (2016), and Boermans
and van der Borght (2017). We extracted the formal elements
included in all theories and their descriptions were compared
for similarities.

Results
The comparative content analysis showed that all incorporated
art theories divided the formal elements into categories. We
recognized six main categories: shape, composition, color, space,
surface quality and light. Based on the comparative content
analysis we found agreement on 17 formal elements across these
categories: (1) “shape,” including “geometry” and “contour”; (2)
“composition,” including “symmetry,” “rhythm,” “line quality,”
“linearity,” “movement,” and “dynamic”; (3) “color,” including
“number of colors,” “color saturation,” “color brightness,” “hue,”
and “mixture of color”; (4) “space,” including “ﬁlled area,”
“used space,” and “suggestion of space,” (5) “surface quality,”
including “texture” (see Table 1), and (6) “light,” including
“ﬂoodlight,” “light source,” and “clair-obscure.” Formal elements
of category 6 mainly concern photography or art products
with realistic styles as in “baroque” and “romanticism.” Because
these are rarely seen in art therapy, we did not include this
category in our model.

All art theories conceptualized formal elements as continua
with dominant presence of absence in the art product as
polarities. Also, all the theories mentioned that formal elements
can reinforce or weaken each other.

In conclusion, among a large number of elements we found
agreement about seventeen formal elements described in terms of
continua. The next step was to analyze whether it was possible to
describe and observe them reliably in art products of adult clients.
Therefore, a second study was conducted.

STUDY 2: OPERATIONALIZATION AND
INTER-RATER RELIABILITY

In this study, we investigated whether it was possible to
construct reliable formal elements in the art products of adult
clients in art
therapy. The formal elements that emerged
from study 1 were operationalized and tested for inter-
rater reliability.

was peer debriefed by two art therapy teachers. Each round
was evaluated with the raters and researcher. In the ﬁrst
round,
independently analyzed 31 art
products made by nine adult clients in one mental health
setting. The operationalization of
the formal elements was
adjusted based on the evaluations and tested in a second
round where two new trained raters independently rated 60 art
products from 25 clients in six mental health settings. Their
ratings were tested for inter-rater reliability and evaluated.
The operationalization of some of the formal elements was
adjusted based on the evaluation. Two new trained raters then
independently rated 46 art products from 46 clients in nine
mental health settings.

In total, 137 art products from 80 clients were included in
this study: 31 art products from 9 clients in the ﬁrst round,
60 art products from 25 clients in the following round, and 46
art products from 46 clients in the ﬁnal round. Client inclusion
criteria included being aged between 18 and 65 years, being
able to read and speak Dutch, and having no or minimal
experience in making art and art therapy. Clients with psychotic
disorders or in manic episodes were excluded. In line with the
Declaration of Helsinki, informed consent was obtained from
all clients. The art products in the ﬁrst two rounds were made
as part of regular art therapy assessment, meaning they were of
diverse sizes and styles and used diverse two-dimensional art
materials like pastel, pencil, or ink. Some of the clients were
instructed while making the products, while other art products
were made based on the clients’ own choices. The art products
in the ﬁnal round were made with standardized semi-structured
instruction that consisted of painting a landscape with acrylic
paint on paper of 50 × 40 cm in a 45-min session. All clients
received the same color palette, the same brushes and pencils,
and the same instructions from their therapists. The therapists
were given paper and video instructions and took part in a
telephone meeting to conﬁrm that all their clients would receive
the same instructions.

The sampled clients (52 female, 28 male) started art therapy
in 16 diﬀerent settings for adult mental health care ranging in
age from 19 to 60 (M = 39). They all just started art therapy,
just after a psychologist gave a preliminary DSM-diagnosis. The
sample was very heterogenic with regard to the preliminary
diagnoses. Most clients (39%) were diagnosed with two or three
diagnoses. Personality disorder (72%) and mood disorder (56%)
were diagnosed most frequently.

Formal Elements Indicate Mental Health

TABLE 1 | The ﬁve categories and the seventeen formal elements.

1. Shape

Geometry

Geometry refers to geometric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles. The opposite of geometric is organic.

Contour

Contour refers to the sharp edges, outlines, and borders of and between separate parts of the art product. Contour is formed by the use of sharp lines or distinct
borders. Shapes are completely accentuated by lines and/or have distinct borders as if they were “cut out.” The opposite of contour is pictorial, diffuse artwork.

2. Composition

Symmetry

Symmetry is formed by an optical vertical axis of the middle of the artwork. The left and right half of the art product are mirrored and are equal with regard to color
and/or shape, line, or ﬁgure. The opposite of a symmetric composition is a chaotic overall composition.

Rhythm

Rhythm refers to the regular return of lines, shapes, or colors. It is a repeated pattern that can be predicted once it is recognized.

Line quality

The quality of a line is strong when it is serried, straight, sharp, and ﬂuent. The opposite is a line that is broken, sketchy, wavered, crumbled, and cautious. To judge line
quality, the quality of the lines present is observed rather than the number of lines.

Linearity

Linearity refers to the extent to which an artwork consists of lines. A line is a stripe not broader than the tip of the used tool (graphic art material) or the brush. Lines can
form shapes. The opposite is a pictorial artwork that lacks lines.

Movement

Movement consists of a combination of elements, such as diagonals and overlap. Movement varies in amount.

Dynamic Dynamic refers to the tension within the artwork. Tension is created when the artwork seems to deny the frame. This is called “a-tectonic.” The opposite is an
artwork that shows no tension with the frame.

3. Color

Number of colors

The number of distinct, used colors. An artwork can be very colorful and have many colors. The opposite is an artwork that consists of a limited number of colors.

Color saturation

The extent to which a color is saturated. The more saturated the color is, the less paper/canvas, etc., is apparent.

Color brightness

Bright colors sparkle and are pure and fresh, such as the green of grass, the yellow of the sun, and the blue of the sky. The color brightness of an artwork increases with
the number of bright colors used. Colors that are mixed with water, white, or black (dark or pastel colors) are not bright.

Hue

Hue refers to gradience from light to dark tones of one color or grays (not different “families of color” such as greens, blues, cold or warm colors).

Mixture of color

The amount of which colors are visibly mixed. The opposite is an art product in which the colors are not mixed and applied separately.

4. Space

Filled area

Filled area refers to the “worked” space on the paper or canvas and the ratio between used and unused space.

Used space

Used space refers to the space on the paper/canvas, etc., that is used.

Suggestion of space

Space can be suggested by several techniques, such as overlap, shadow, line perspective, atmospheric perspective, and foreground and background. The suggestion
of depth is created. The opposite refers to a “ﬂat” artwork without any suggestion of space.

5. Surface quality

Texture

Texture refers to the tactile surface of the artwork. This does not depend on the used paper or canvas but can depend on the art material used and the way it is applied.

In the ﬁrst round, the formal elements were operationalized
categorically and analyzed for percentage of agreement. Finally,
the formal elements were operationalized on a ﬁve-point Likert
scale and tested for inter-rater reliability using Cohen’s kappa
analysis. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.

Results
Operationalization
Initially, the formal elements were operationalized by categories.
Some of the formal elements consisted of two categories, while
others consisted of three (see Figure 3 for examples).

FIGURE 3 | Examples of categorical operationalization.

The overall inter-rater agreement was >88%, but despite this
high agreement, the raters found it diﬃcult to rank the formal
elements with diﬀerent numbers of categories. They also found it
diﬃcult to rate the art products based on the written deﬁnitions
of the formal elements and suggested adding visual illustrations.
The operationalization was adjusted and all the formal elements
were operationalized into ﬁve-point Likert scales (see Figure 4),
with 1 representing no or minimal presence of the element and 5
representing a very high presence of the element. For each formal
element, example images of art products were provided for both
ends of the scale.

Inter-Rater Reliability
the inter-rater reliability for “rhythm” and
In round two,
“movement” was fair (κ = 0.34 and κ = 0.29, respectively),
while the reliability for “contour” (κ = 0.57), “color saturation”
(κ = 0.43), and “mixture of colors” (κ = 0.47) was moderate.
Reliability for “suggestion of space” (κ = 0.65), “number of
colors” (κ = 0.65), “color brightness” (κ = 0.64), “symmetry”
(κ = 0.68), “linearity” (κ = 0.74), “line quality” (κ = 0.64),
“dynamic” (κ = 0.71), and “texture” (κ = 0.65) was substantial,
while reliability for “ﬁlled area” (κ = 0.82), “used space” (κ = 0.86),
“geometry” (κ = 0.83), and “hue” (κ = 0.83) was almost perfect
(Viera and Garrett, 2005).

The evaluation of round two highlighted three drawbacks of
rating. First, the deﬁnitions of scores 3, 4, and 5 for “number
of colors” overlapped. Second, raters found the deﬁnition of the
item “rhythm” too complex and the deﬁnition of “movement”
was found to be unclear and incomplete. This could explain
the relatively low reliability for these items. All other deﬁnitions
were clear and the art product examples were found to be

illustrative. Third, it was questioned whether the art materials
might inﬂuence the ratings of the formal elements.

Based on these drawbacks, the deﬁnitions of “number of
colors,” “rhythm,” and “movement” were adjusted and tested
for inter-rater reliability in a third and ﬁnal round. The inter-
rater reliability varied between moderate and substantial for
all items except “texture” which had poor inter-rater reliability
(see Table 2). The inter-rater reliability for the adjusted
formal elements “number of colors,” “rhythm,” and “movement”
increased in the third round. The inter-rater reliability of all other
formal elements remained similar. Only the inter-rater reliability
for “texture” decreased signiﬁcantly, therefore this item was not
included in the subsequent studies. In conclusion, 16 formal
elements could be operationalized reliably. The next step was to
examine which of these 16 formal elements were also clinically
relevant. Therefore, a third study was conducted.

STUDY 3: CLINICALLY RELEVANT

We were able to operationalize most formal elements reliably,
however, it was still unknown which of these formal elements
were clinically relevant. Especially as the art therapy literature

mentioned previous study (Pénzes et al., 2018).

Method
A panel consisting of three art therapy teachers compared
the formal elements identiﬁed by art therapists in the prior
study of Pénzes et al. (2018) to the formal elements that were
operationalized reliably in study 2. These formal elements,
including their descriptions from art theories and art therapists,
were incorporated into a table. “Figuration” was excluded, as art
theories stated that this element could not be analyzed according
to the level of its presence in an art product. Instead it is a
categorical item that refers to the style of the art product as
realistic, ﬁgurative, or abstract.

First, the comparison concerned which formal elements were
identiﬁed by art therapist and art theory. Second, the descriptions
of these formal elements were compared for similarities. Each
expert independently compared the formal elements on a scale
ranging from “0 = no similarities,” “1 = some resemblance,” and
“2 = similar or almost similar.”

In summary,

it was found that “movement,” “dynamic,”

elements in art products. A fourth study was then conducted to
see whether these formal elements are related to mental health.

STUDY 4: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
FORMAL ELEMENTS AND ADULT
MENTAL HEALTH

Art therapy literature demonstrates a wide range of opinions
concerning the relationship between formal elements and mental
health. In most studies, formal elements are related to disorders
of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) or the International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases
and Related Health Problems (ICD) (Gantt and Tabone, 1998;
Hacking, 1999; Kim et al., 2012). Whereas in more recent studies
formal elements are related to clients’ strengths (Hinz, 2009, 2015;
Pénzes et al., 2014, 2015) in line with perspectives on positive
mental health (Huber et al., 2016). Thus, literature has been
inconsistent in interpreting formal elements of art product in
terms of mental health.

According to our previous study, art therapists considered
mental health in terms of balance and adaptability. Balance
existed when allowing, experiencing and expressing emotions
and cognitive control were in proportion to each other.
Adaptability consisted of self-management, ﬂexibility, openness,
and creativity. Art therapists associated balance, speciﬁcally
being out of balance, with the severity of clients’ problem and
adaptability with clients’ strengths and resources. The ability
to assess the level of balance and adaptability may support art
therapists to formulate treatment goals to suit the individual
needs and potential and to choose art interventions that enhance
or develop the client’s mental health (Pénzes et al., 2018).
Also, in our previous study we showed that art therapists did
not related individual formal elements to mental health; they
related speciﬁc combinations of formal elements, speciﬁcally
the primary formal elements of “dynamic,” “movement,” and
“contour” to mental health.

In this study we tested the combination of formal elements and

the relation to mental health.

Method
Forty-six adult clients in nine diﬀerent mental health settings
participated in this study. These were the same clients and art

criteria included being aged between 18 and 65 years, being able
to read and speak Dutch, and having no or minimal experience
in making art and art therapy. Clients with psychotic disorders or
in manic episodes were excluded. Art products were made with
standardized instructions (see the ﬁnal round in study 2). The
two raters in the ﬁnal round in study 2 independently rated the
formal elements. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Formal Elements Indicate Mental Health

TABLE 3 | Comparison of clinically relevant, objective and reliable formal elements.

Primary

Clinically relevant formal elements according
to art therapists

Movement
Movement refers to the amount, character, and
direction of the movement. Movement becomes
visible by the brush marks.

Dynamic
Dynamic refers to tension (tectonic) within the art
product. Dynamic varies from static, restrained, and
calm to fast, turbulent, energetic, and forceful. It
refers to the vitality of the movement made.

Contour
Contour refers to the delimitation that emerges
when shapes are outlined or are placed directly
next to each other. This leads to rigid and sharp
distinctions.

Repetition
Repetition refers to the return of one or more formal
elements in a pattern. A lot of repetition leads to
symmetry. Rhythm refers to the repetition of
movement.

Secondary Mixture of color

Mixture of color refers to the extent to which the
colors are mixed within the art product.

Color saturation
Color saturation refers to the density of color within
the art product varying between transparent and
impasto.

Formal elements operationalized in art theories

Movement
Movement consists of a combination of elements, such as
diagonals and overlap. Movement varies in amount.

Dynamic
Dynamic refers to the tension within the artwork. This
tension is created when the artwork seems to deny the
boundaries of the frame. This is called “a-tectonic.” The
opposite is an artwork that shows no tension with the
frame.

Contour
Contour refers to the sharp edges, outlines, and borders of
and between separate parts of the art product. Contour is
formed by the use of sharp lines or distinct borders. Shapes
are completely accentuated by lines and/or have distinct
borders as if they were “cut out.” The opposite of contour is
pictorial, diffuse artwork.

Symmetry
Symmetry is formed by an optical vertical axis of the middle
of the artwork. The left and right half of the art product are
mirrored and are equal regarding color and/or shape, line,
or ﬁgure. The opposite of a symmetric composition is a
chaotic overall composition.
Rhythm
Rhythm refers to the regular return of lines, shapes, or
colors. It is a repeated pattern that can be predicted once it
is recognized.

Mixture of color
The amount of which colors are visibly mixed. The opposite
is an art product in which the colors are not mixed and
applied separately.

Color saturation
The extent to which a color is saturated. The more
saturated the color is, the less paper/canvas, etc., is
apparent.
Texture
Texture refers to the tactile surface of the artwork. This does
not depend on the paper/canvas, etc., used, but can
depend on the art material used and the way it is applied.

triple-diagnoses, and three clients four or more diagnoses. Most
frequently diagnosed DSM categories were personality disorder

disorders. Psychometric qualities were in line with the SCL-90
(alpha > 0.71) with good correlations with other instruments
(Buwalda et al., 2012). The respondents scored the extent to
which they experienced diverse psychological symptoms during
the last week on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from “a lot” to
“not at all.” The BSI consists of three scales and nine subscales,
including a general measure of psychopathology (total score). In
this study, only the total score of the BSI was used because the
art therapists described mental illness in general terms instead of
speciﬁc disorders or symptoms.

−0.67 to −0.79 on repression and psychological complaints
(Jacobs et al., 2008; Fledderus et al., 2012; Bernaerts et al., 2014).
As art therapists related the combination of formal elements
to mental health, Spearman correlation analysis was used to
test whether the formal elements of “movement,” “dynamic,”
and “contour” were related to each other. Linear regression
analysis was used to test whether the combination of the formal
elements “movement,” “dynamic,” and “contour” was related to
clients’ scores on the BSI, RS-nl, and AAQ-II. All analyses were
conducted in SPSS version 25.

Results
Table 4 presented an overview of the mean scores, standard
deviations, and variances for the formal elements “movement,”
“dynamic” and “contour” and for the BSI, RS-nl, and AAQ-
II scores.

Inter-Relatedness of Formal Elements
Results of the Spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive
signiﬁcant relationship between “movement” and “dynamic:”

rs (46) = 0.76, p < 0.001. This suggests that an increase in
“movement” is related to an increase in “dynamic” and vice
versa. The results also indicated a signiﬁcant negative relationship
between both “movement” and “contour:” rs (46) = −0.41,
p = 0.004 and “dynamic” rs (46) = −0.34, p = 0.020 and “contour.”

Relationship Between Formal Elements and Mental
Health
Results of the regression analysis (see Table 5) showed that
even though “dynamic” and “movement” signiﬁcantly related
to the BSI total score, the overall model was not signiﬁcant
(R2 = 0.16, p = 0.072). The overall model signiﬁcantly related
to the AAQ-II total score (R2 = 0.29, p = 0.003), however,
with main eﬀects found for “dynamic” (β = 0.60, p = 0.004)
and “movement” (β = −0.76, p < 0.001). The overall model
also signiﬁcantly related to the RS-nl total score (R2 = 0.19,
p = 0.034) with one main eﬀect found for “dynamic” (β = 0.65,
p = 0.004) and a trend for “movement” (β = −0.40, p = 0.070).
The combination of “movement,” “dynamic,” and “contour”
explained 19.3% of variance in RS-nl scores and 29.1% of the
variance in AAQ-II scores. The combination of these formal
elements was thus signiﬁcantly related to resiliency and to
psychological ﬂexibility/experiential acceptance but not to the
level of complaints.

DISCUSSION

In study 1 seventeen formal elements emerged from the analysis
of art theories. Findings of study 2 show that the majority of these
seventeen formal elements can be observed reliably. Based on the
results in Study 3, the formal elements “dynamic,” “movement,”
and “contour” are found to be primarily clinically relevant and
can be measured reliably. Results of Study 4 show that the
combination of the formal elements “dynamic,” “movement,”
and “contour” explain 19% of the variance in RS-nl scores
and 29% of the variance in AAQ-II scores. These ﬁndings
imply that the combination of the formal elements “dynamic,”
“movement,” and “contour” are related to adult clients’ resiliency
and experiential acceptance. The same combination of elements
shows only a slight non-signiﬁcant statistical relation to the BSI;
even though “dynamic” and “movement” related signiﬁcantly
tot the BSO total score, the overall model that also included
“contour” is not signiﬁcantly related. Looking at each formal
element, “movement” and “dynamic” are signiﬁcantly related to
clients’ mental health, whereas “contour” is not. The relationship

is most pronounced for positive mental health concepts, such
as experiential acceptance and resiliency. These results are in
line with other art therapy studies that stress the importance of
positive mental health in art therapy assessment (Hinz, 2009;
Betts, 2012; Pénzes et al., 2018). Rather than focusing on DSM
diagnoses or symptoms, art therapists often emphasize clients’
strengths and resources, embracing a perspective of mental health
that is in line with the idea of positive health (Huber et al.,
2016) and the recovery approach (Anthony, 1993; Jacob et al.,
2017). These results are somewhat unexpected as Haeyen et al.
(2017) found the same eﬀect sizes for ﬂexibility and mental
illness (OQ-45 and SMI maladaptive scales) in their study on
eﬀects of art therapy for patients with a personality disorder.
A variety of hypotheses can be formulated to account for these
outcomes: maybe the diﬀerences are related to diﬀerences in
patient samples, the use of speciﬁc measures (BSI versus OQ-
45 and SMI), of diﬀerences in study design (we did not study
the eﬀects of an art therapy intervention and did not calculate
eﬀect sizes). In addition, a recent scoping review of Lasiello
et al. (2020) identiﬁed a considerable body of empirical research
investigating the validity of the dual-continua model, and the
overarching notion that positive mental health and mental illness
represent two distinct, yet related, constructs. They strongly
advocate assessing positive mental health and mental illness
together, rather than using only one or the other. Our results are
in line with their conclusions; a focus on either positive mental
health or mental illness alone would not provide a complete
image of the mental health status of an individual or population.
Undoubtedly, further research is needed to rule out the diﬀerent
hypotheses and to enlighten us in more detail about the nature of
the relation between illness and positive health.

The results of Study 4 also indicate that the combination of
formal elements is related to mental health and that the involved
formal elements are strongly interrelated, e.g., an increased
presence of “dynamic” and “movement” is related to a decreased
presence of “contour.” This is in line with existing studies
that have argued that individual elements mean nothing unless
considered as a cluster (Gantt, 2001) or speciﬁc combinations of
“primary” formal elements that construct the “structure” of the
art product (Pénzes et al., 2018).

are

“Movement”

and “dynamic”

strongly interrelated,
indicating that an increase in “movement” is related to an
increase in “dynamic.” When relating these elements to mental
health measures, however, “movement” is negatively associated
with mental health and “dynamic” is positively related. A possible
explanation for this can be found in a previous study in which the
concept of “variation” emerged (Pénzes et al., 2018). “Variation”

refers to the diversity that can be recognized in one or more
formal elements within the art product. Art products with low
“dynamic” and low “movement” or high “dynamic” and high
“movement” have less “variation.” In contrast, art products with
low “dynamic” and high “movement” or vice versa have more
“variation.” Art therapists largely agree on the importance of
observing this aspect of art products to assess client mental health.
Future research could address operationalizing “variation” to
investigate its relationship with mental health.

In summary, the relationships between formal elements,
positive mental health, and mental illness show that art products
are indeed associated with aspects of positive mental health
illness. The classic assumption of art therapists
and mental
is in line with this. This implies that the lack of reliability
and validity of existing art therapy assessment instruments is
not due to the absence of such a relationship or to incorrect
theoretical assumptions, but to inconsistent operationalization or
weak study design.

Implications for Clinical Practice of Art
Therapy
Despite the ongoing discussion about how to interpret the formal
elements in art therapy assessment (e.g., Hinz, 2009; Gilroy
et al., 2012), most studies seem to agree that formal elements are
related to how clients make art products (Gantt, 2001; Hinz, 2009;
Conrad et al., 2011). In previous studies, this assumption has
been speciﬁed using the concept of “material interaction,” which
refers to the art making process and the clients’ interaction with
the art materials (Pénzes et al., 2014, 2015). In these studies, it is
conceptualized that material interaction is reﬂected by the formal
elements of the art product and related to mental health. The
signiﬁcance of the combination of “movement” and “dynamic”
might imply that these formal elements reﬂect the clients’ art
making, i.e., the amount and kind of movements that clients
make when interacting with art materials to create an art product.
The “dynamic” and “movement” of the art products and
“movement” of material interaction can be linked to Stern’s
(2010) concept of “forms of vitality,” which refers to the forces and
sensations linked to the movement that creates forms. Stern states
that peoples’ health can be evaluated based on the vitality that is
expressed in their almost constant movements. This implies that
formal elements might be considered as manifest visual forms
of vitality and that these formal elements in art products reﬂect
mental health and mental illness.

Further

research is needed to investigate the possible
relationship between “dynamic” and “movement” in clients’

art products and clients’ “material interaction” in art making.
For the time being, these two formal elements are observable
and visible aspects of the art product. This visibility allows
the joint reﬂection of the art therapist and the client, leading
to insights and awareness that may help formulate treatment
objectives and art interventions. The relationship between the
formal elements and mental health is most pronounced for
positive mental health aspects, such as experiential acceptance,
adaptability, and resiliency. This may have implications for
art therapy assessment and treatment. The clients’ adaptability,
ﬂexibility, and resiliency may indicate the potential for change
in therapy and art therapists in a previous study associated
adaptability with clients’ prognoses in therapy (Pénzes et al.,
2018). Several studies have also shown the therapeutic potential of
diverse art material properties to create experiential interventions
that allow change and ameliorate mental health (Hinz, 2009;
Moon, 2010; Snir and Regev, 2013; Pénzes et al., 2014). This
assumption requires further longitudinal research.

Methodological Considerations
In this study, art products made with diverse materials and
instructions are included. The analyses of studies 3 and 4 are
based on art products made with acrylic paint. This is a serious
limitation of our study as the art materials and instructions may
have inﬂuenced the results. For example, the formal element
“ﬁlled space” might have emerged when art products were made
on larger pieces of paper, with smaller brushes, and/or with
more time allowed.

We excluded “mixture of color” from the analysis in
study 4 because theoretically,
it was not conceptualized as
a “primary” formal element. The primary formal element
“repetition” was also excluded from analysis, as it did not show
enough resemblance to formal elements in art theories. Future
research could include these formal elements to investigate if
they inﬂuence the formal elements’ relationship with mental
health measures.

The relationship between the formal elements and mental
health found in this work is based on a cross-sectional study
design, which does not allow for insights into causality and
eﬀects over time. Longitudinal studies including a series of art
products could investigate whether therapeutic experiential art
interventions change the art making, i.e., material interaction,
and whether these are reﬂected in the formal elements of
“movement” and “dynamic” and in the enhancement of
experiential acceptance, adaptability, and resiliency.

practice in the Netherlands. Although we did include a few art
therapists from other countries such as Israel, Finland, Germany,
the United States, and United Kingdom to contrast ﬁndings,
further generalizability of art therapists’ perspectives may need
to be checked through further research.

CONCLUSION

The combination of the formal elements “movement,” “dynamic,”
and “contour” are signiﬁcantly interrelated and related to clients’
mental health, i.e., psychopathology, psychological ﬂexibility,
experiential avoidance, and adaptability. Numerous questions
remain unanswered and require further research. Even though
it is methodologically challenging to study art and the art-
making process in relation to mental health, this study highlights
the possibilities for future research. Art products seem to have
diagnostic value and may add to clients’ verbal expression and
indicate their potential to beneﬁt from therapy.
