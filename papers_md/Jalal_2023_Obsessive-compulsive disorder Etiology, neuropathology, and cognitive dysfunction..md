Abstract

Background: This review provides an overview of obsessive-compulsive disorder

(OCD) symptoms, including the four partially distinct subtypes of the disorder, current

diagnostic criteria, and common comorbidities. Critically, it focuses on the etiology of

OCD, including its underlying neuropathology, and examines cognitive dysfunction in

OCD.

Methods: This review study was conducted by library method.

Results: We show how dysfunction in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits

may underpin symptoms; and shed light on the putative neurochemistry within these

loops such as the role of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate systems. We also show

how OCD is characterized by cognitive dysfunction including problems in cognitive

flexibility, visuospatial memory, response inhibition, and goal-directed behavior, linked

to aberrant activity within CSTC circuits.

Conclusions: In brief, research questions we shed light on include (1) what are the

symptoms in OCD; (2) what is the etiology of the disorder and do existing models

explain OCD; and (3) what are key cognitive deficits in OCD and do these improve with

treatment?

OCD. For example, Adams et al. (2005) showed that unmedicated OCD

Notwithstanding promising findings (e.g., for glutamate modulators

like memantine and n-acetyl cysteine), this research is still prelimi-

nary (Oliver et al., 2015; Pittenger, 2015; see also, Marinova et al.,

of efficacy, in double-blind placebo-controlled studies, for OC-related

disorders trichotillomania and skin-picking disorder, which are OC-

related disorders (Grant et al., 2009; Grant et al., 2016). On the whole,

future research will need to shed further light on the role of glutamate

in OCD.

Etiology: learning-based and related cognitive

2.5
models of OCD

2.5.1

Learning-based models

Learning-based models of OCD (derived from Mowrer’s two-process

model of fear [1960]) posit that obsessional fear acquisition (via

classical conditioning) and extinction are crucial in the etiology and

subsequent treatment of OCD (Foa, 2010; McGuire et al., 2016;

Shafran, 2005; Taylor et al., 2007; Tracy et al., 1999). Fear and obses-

sive thoughts are acquired through the pairing of a neutral stimulus

(e.g., a doorknob) with a distressing event, for example, contracting a

2.6

Cognitive models of OCD

Mirroring learning-based theories, according to cognitive models,

faulty beliefs give rise to obsessional anxiety. Compulsive acts are then

performed to ameliorate intrusive thoughts and anxiety, for exam-

ple, to ward off aversive outcomes (Abramowitz, 2006; Abramowitz

et al., 2005; Gillan & Robbins, 2014). Such cognitive errors include

(1) “heightened responsibility”: having a distinct ability to precipitate

and/or responsibility to avert aversive outcomes; (2) “overemphasis on

thought”: for instance, that merely thinking of an event increases the

likelihood of its occurrence; (3) “controlling thoughts”: that full control

and regulation of one’s thinking is attainable and essential; (4) “over-

estimation of threat”: that aversive outcomes have a high probability

of occurring and disastrous consequences; (5) “perfectionism”: that

actions have to be done exactly the “right way,” and overall intolerabil-

ity toward errors; (6) “intolerance of uncertainty”: for instance, a need

to be fully reassured that aversive events will not unfold (Abramowitz,

2006). To target these cognitive biases, “cognitive therapy” was devel-

oped (Rosa-Alcázar et al., 2008). Cognitive therapy typically involves

teaching patients about the implausibility and maladaptive nature of

these cognitions (i.e., how they give rise to obsessions) (Abramowitz,

sexually transmitted disease (unconditioned stimulus) after touching

2006).

a contaminated doorknob (conditioned stimulus) in a public restroom.

Later encounters with the conditioned stimulus (doorknob) can now

trigger a conditioned response (e.g., excessive contamination concerns)

(Foa, 2010; McGuire et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2007). The individual

later learns that repetitive cleansing and avoidance behaviors amelio-

rate the obsessions and contamination fears. Indeed, these behaviors

are negatively reinforced by distress reduction (via operant condi-

tioning); in turn, the obsessional fears are never subject to extinction

(Shafran, 2005; Taylor et al., 2007; Tracy et al., 1999). Next, stimulus

generalization takes place where the learned fear response is general-

ized to other stimuli (e.g., a toilet seat), associated with the conditioned

stimulus (Dunsmoor et al., 2012; McGuire et al., 2016). These thus

become secondary conditioned stimuli (Rachman, 1977). Of interest,

anxiety-related pathology may be characterized by excessive stimulus

generalization (McGuire et al., 2016).

While conditioned fear responses are generally robust over time

(Butcher et al., 2008), extinction occurs when the individual is repeat-

edly exposed to the conditioned stimulus (e.g., touching a dirty

doorknob) without the aversive outcome (unconditioned stimulus, for

example, contracting herpes) and prevention from performing com-

pulsive acts (e.g., excessive handwashing) (McGuire et al., 2016). As a

result, the pathological association is degraded or a new nonthreat-

ening stimulus-response link is established effectively suppressing the

previous aberrant association (Jacoby & Abramowitz, 2016; McGuire

et al., 2016; Tracy et al., 1999). This model has resulted in the behavioral

intervention for OCD called exposure and response prevention (ERP)

Ostensible strengths of the learning-based and cognitive models of

OCD have been highlighted in the literature. For example, research has

shown—as their theories would predict—that exposure to obsession-

related stimuli raises anxiety levels and that subsequent engagement in

compulsive rituals lowers such distress, prima facie indicating a causal

relationship between obsessive ideation and compulsions (Foa, 2010;

Shafran, 2005). Another suggested strength of the learning-based

model is the assumption that learning mechanisms driving obsessions

and compulsions in OCD are not pathological in themselves. This dove-

tails with research showing that the vast majority of people in the

general population occasionally have obsessive-like intrusive thoughts

that bear resemblance to clinical obsessions (e.g., in terms of content)

(Rachman & de Silva, 1978). According to this model, the vast major-

ity of people are not bothered by such intrusions and view them as

benign. Indeed, intrusions only become pathological when fear acquisi-

tion takes places, that is, when associated with anxiety (i.e., via classical

conditioning) (Shafran, 2005). Consistent with this model, as noted,

Apergis-Schoute (2017) showed that OCD patients have difficulties

shaking off fear responses when these are no longer threatening; that

is, they exhibit impaired safety signaling and that such deficit in safety

signaling is mediated by abnormal activity in the salience network,

including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (involved in assigning

value to stimuli.) Arguably, however, the most obvious strength is that

these models have provided a theoretical framework for widely used

psychological therapies for OCD; the learning-based model, the first-

line nonpharmacological intervention ERP (Shafran, 2005; Taylor et al.,

et al., 2017b). According to some studies, frontostriatal abnormality

may improve in response to treatment in OCD (Freyer et al., 2011).

That is, such studies tentatively suggest that set shifting in particular

in OCD may improve following behavioral therapy (Bolton et al., 2000;

Katrin Kuelz et al., 2006; Moritz et al., 1999). For example, in Katrin

Kuelz et al.’s study (2006), OCD patients displayed greater set shifting

deficits at pretreatment than healthy controls but not at posttreat-
ment (i.e., revealing a significant group × time interaction after CBT). As

such, set shifting improvements were not solely attributable to practice

effects. Yet this study did not have a proper parallel control condition

comprised of treated patients, which constitutes a notable limitation.

Not all studies suggest that cognitive function can improve after CBT.

For instance, one study by Vandborg et al. (2015) examining executive

functions in OCD compared to healthy controls did not find CBT to

improve cognitive function when correcting for practice effects; how-

ever, this study did not include a control group of OCD patients (for a

review, see Vandborg et al., 2012). Overall, it remains inclusive whether

set shifting may improve following treatment, and more research with

parallel control groups of OCD patients is needed.

2.7.2

Visuospatial memory

2.7.3

Response inhibition

Response inhibition refers to the ability to suppress a prepotent motor

response, a neurocognitive domain related to impulsivity (Aron & Pol-

drack, 2005; Bari & Robbins, 2013). It has been suggested that the

intrusive thoughts and repetitive rituals in OCD may reflect an inability

to control and inhibit these cognitions and behaviors, and that as such,

OCD can be seen as a disorder of cognitive and behavioral inhibitory

failures (Chamberlain et al., 2005). Consistent with this view, meta-

analyses have found response inhibition impairments in OCD (e.g.,

Abramovitch et al., 2013; Lipszyc & Schachar, 2010; Snyder et al., 2015;

see also Martínez-Esparza et al., 2021).

One measure of response inhibition is the Stop Signal Task (SST;

Aron et al., 2003). The SST assesses the ability to stop an already

triggered motor response. Response inhibition deficits measured on

the SST have been reported in OCD patients (Chamberlain et al.,

2006a; Penadés et al., 2007; for a recent meta-analysis, see Bora,

2020), and their first-degree relatives without the disorder (Bora,

2020; Chamberlain et al., 2007b). Relatedly, as noted, decreased func-
