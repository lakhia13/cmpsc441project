Abstract: Burn injuries are traumatic experiences that can detrimentally impact an individual’s psy-
chological and emotional wellbeing. Despite this, some survivors adapt to psychosocial challenges
better than others despite similar characteristics relating to the burn. Positive adaptation is known
as resilience or posttraumatic growth, depending on the trajectory and process. This review aimed
to describe the constructs of resiliency and growth within the burn injury context, examine the risk
factors that inhibit resilience or growth after burn (barriers), the factors that promote resilience or
growth after burn (enablers), and ﬁnally to assess the impact of interventions that have been tested
that may facilitate resilience or growth after burn. This review was performed according to the
recently updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
Guidelines. An electronic search was conducted in November 2021 on the databases PubMed, Med-
line (1966-present), Embase (1974-present), PsycINFO for English-language peer-reviewed academic
articles. There were 33 studies included in the review. Findings were mixed for most studies; however,
there were factors related to demographic information (age, gender), burn-speciﬁc characteristics
(TBSA, time since burn), person-speciﬁc factors (personality, coping style), psychopathology (depres-
sion, PTSD), and psychosocial factors (social support, spirituality/religion, life purpose) that were
evidenced to be related to resilience and growth. One qualitative study evaluated an intervention,
and this study showed that a social camp for burn patients can promote resilience. This study has
presented a variety of factors that inhibit or encourage resilience and growth, such as demographic,
individual, and social factors. We also present suggestions on interventions that may be used to
promote growth following this adverse event, such as improving social support, coping styles and
deliberate positive introspection.

1. Introduction

Improved care and treatments for burn injury have increased survival rates, but
have led burn survivors to contend with greater long-term psychosocial and physical
consequences [1]. It is recognized that burn injuries are traumatic experiences that can
detrimentally impact an individual’s psychological and emotional wellbeing. Posttraumatic
stress disorder occurs in 8 to 30% of the adult burn population [2], and 11 to 13% of child
burn populations [3], and routine clinical practice accepts the absence of a mental health

disorder as an acceptable goal. However, research has shown that postburn hospital
admission rates for mental health conditions were 3.52–6.79 times as high compared to
a matched uninjured cohort, suggesting that the absence of a diagnosed mental health is
not adequate for optimal mental health recovery [4]. Despite this, some survivors adapt to
psychosocial challenges better than others despite similar type, severity, bodily location,
and physical consequences of the burn.

Resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG) are related constructs but are not synony-
mous. Historically, PTG was seen to be part of resilience and they are often confused in the
general post-trauma literature [5]. Resilience has been deﬁned as the ability to maintain
relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning, [6] and is about
adapting or ‘bouncing back’ to the pre-trauma state. PTG has been deﬁned as ‘the subjective
experience of positive psychological change reported by an individual as a result of the
struggle with trauma’ and describes development that has occurred beyond pre-trauma
psychological functioning [7,8]. Resilience is static because it involves little or no change to
an individual’s worldview, the event is already understandable, which allows a focus on
the future. PTG, on the other hand, is dynamic because it involves a changing worldview,
and it arises from deliberate rumination that focuses on the event with the purpose of
making some sense of what happened [9,10].

Within the ﬁeld of medical trauma, studies have investigated the barriers and en-
ablers of resilience and PTG in cancer [11], serious paediatric illness [12], and spinal cord
injury [13]. Across the different medical issues, resilience and PTG are associated with
individuals being able to talk about their experiences, younger age, perceptions about the
medical issue, and social support [11–13]. Speciﬁcally in burn injuries, there have been
studies on the factors associated with resilience and PTG, and one review has investigated
the correlates of PTG in adult burn survivors [9]. This review highlighted key areas that
enabled PTG in this population (including function, quality of life, social support and
optimism, hope, and new opportunities), which could be targeted following a burn injury
to facilitate PTG. Though this review showcased important factors involved in PTG in
burn patients, resilience, which is a separate though related construct, was not investigated.
Further, there have been no attempts to synthesise the literature though, across ages and
within paediatric populations. It is important to ascertain whether there are different factors
that contribute to PTG in childhood and adolescence.

This review aimed to assess the published literature that has been conducted in the
ﬁeld of resilience and PTG after burn injury. Speciﬁcally, the aim was to describe the
constructs of resiliency and growth within the burn injury context, examine the risk factors
that inhibit resilience or growth after burn (barriers), the factors that promote resilience or
PTG after burn (enablers), and ﬁnally to assess the impact of interventions that have been
tested that may facilitate resilience or growth after burn.

2. Method

This review was performed according to the recently updated Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines [14,15]. The re-
view was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO ID295835).

2.1. Research Questions

1. What research has been conducted in the ﬁeld of resilience and PTG after burn injury
that examines the risk factors that inhibit resilience or growth after burn (barriers), the
factors that promote resilience, or PTG after burn (enablers)?

2. What interventions have been tested that may facilitate resilience or PTG after burn?

2.2. Search Strategy

An electronic search was conducted in November 2021 on the databases PubMed,
Medline (1966–present), Embase (1974–present), and PsycINFO for English-language peer-

Eur. Burn J. 2022, 3

reviewed academic articles. No time restrictions were placed. Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH terms) or equivalent terms were used for searching in Title, Abstract, and Keywords
according to the requirements of the database. The search terms were broad to capture all
relevant articles. MeSH or Indexed terms related to burn injury were combined using the
Boolean operator “OR”. Separately, MeSH or Indexed terms related to burn survivorship,
resilience, and posttraumatic growth were also combined using the Boolean operator “OR”.
These two searches were combined with the Boolean operator “AND”.

Indexed terms: ((burn.mp. or Burns/) AND ((posttraumatic growth.mp. or exp
Posttraumatic Growth, Psychological/) OR (Adaptation, Psychological/ or Resilience,
Psychological/ or resilience.mp.))).

MeSH terms: (Burns) AND (Survivors/psychology) OR (Trauma and Stressor Related
Disorders/psychology OR Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders/rehabilitation) AND
(Resilience, Psychological OR Posttraumatic Growth, Psychological).

2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

For question one (the investigation of barriers and enablers on resilience or PTG),
qualitative or quantitative articles were included if they described factors that negatively or
positively inﬂuenced resilience or growth. Participants could be adult or pediatric. Reviews
were handled by extracting the relevant reference articles for inclusion in this review.

For question two, inclusion criteria were (1) adults and children with burn injury,
(2) a psychosocial or physical intervention aimed at improving resilience or posttraumatic
growth (this could be a psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), counselling,
a psychoeducational strategy, peer support, or a physical or social activity, (3) any com-
parators, (4) outcomes involving resilience or posttraumatic growth, (5) all RCTs, and
quasi-experimental intervention research studies. No time limits were set. Case reports,
letters to the editor, conference abstracts, and grey literature were excluded. Articles
published in languages other than English were excluded.

Titles and abstracts identiﬁed through the electronic search were reviewed indepen-
dently by two authors (AW and LM) for inclusion. Each full-text review was completed by
two authors to decide on eligibility for inclusion in the review. Any discrepancies in opinion
were discussed between the authors. See the PRISMA diagram in Figure 1 for details.

2.4. Critical Appraisal

Quality assessment and risk of bias was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute
critical appraisal tools [16]. The appropriate tool was selected depending on study design
(see Table 1). Each study was assessed using these tools, the results were reviewed by the au-
thors, and any discrepancies discussed. Two studies were excluded after quality assessment.

2.5. Data Extraction and Synthesis

The following information was extracted from the articles: authors, year and country,
aim, study design, sample size, participant characteristics, clinical characteristics, outcome
measures, statistical analyses, and ﬁndings.

3. Results
3.1. Study Selection and Characteristics

This review included 33 studies. Study characteristics are outlined in Tables 2 and 3. The
studies comprised of two cohort studies, 15 analytical cross-sectional studies, 15 qualitative
studies, and one qualitative intervention study. The settings of the studies included
Australia (n = 8), China (n = 5), United States (n = 4), Pakistan (n = 3), Germany (n = 2),
Korea (n = 2), United Kingdom (n = 2), Canada (n = 1), Iran (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), Norway
(n = 1), Saudi Arabia (n = 1), South Africa (n = 1), and Taiwan (n = 1). Thirty studies
investigated adult populations, while only three investigated children or young people.
In total, there were 1972 participants in the quantitative studies, and 205 participants
in the qualitative studies. Of the quantitative studies, nine investigated resilience and
eight investigated PTG. Four evaluated resilience with the Connor Davidson Resilience
Scale, two used the Resilience Scale developed by Wagnild and Young [52], one used
the Ego Resilience Scale developed by Block and Kremen [53], one used the State-Trait
Resiliency Scale [54] and one used resilience scales developed for Mexican populations.
Seven studies evaluated PTG with the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory [55,56], and one
used the Perceived Beneﬁt Scale [57]. For resilience, as measured by the CD-RISC, mean
scores varied from 49.89 to 67.34 (Table 2). For PTG, as measured by the PTGI, mean scores
(out of 5) varied from 1.26 to 3.18 [30], with mean scores over 2.5 recommended to represent
a useful level of PTG [44]. Forty different outcome measures were used in the analyses, and
this prevented the ability to quantitatively synthesize the data (Table 2). The qualitative
studies were mixed, those that evaluated resilience stated this outcome, and those that
evaluated growth reported the positive changes described by burn survivors.

3.2. Question One: Barriers and Enablers to Resilience or PTG

The results of the quantitative studies suggested that there are several barriers and
enablers to resilience or PTG following a burn (see Table 2). Total body surface area of the
burn was reported to be positively associated with PTG in four studies [18–20,31], although
another study reported no association [30]. The relationship with stress differed between
resilience and PTG, and was reported to differ between males and females. In terms of
resilience, three studies reported that increased stress [22,28] or subclinical symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder [21] hindered resilience following a burn. Bibi et al., [21]
reported that this barrier to resilience was further associated with gender, as females
reported higher traumatic stress and lower resilience. Masood et al. also reported similar
ﬁndings about gender, resilience, and distress [28]. However, Yang et al. [34] reported
resilience to be higher in females. For PTG, stress and PTG co-exist, stress is reported
to precede growth, and has a positive association with growth [18,20,30], with females
reporting more growth than males [30]. In terms of barriers to PTG, time postburn was
identiﬁed as a factor, with higher risk for poor PTG occurring in the year following a
burn [32]. Younger age was associated with resilience [29], but not PTG [30], and other
studies found no association between age and either construct [23].

Good social support was a strong enabler of both resilience and PTG [18,20,25,30].
Spirituality had a positive effect on both resilience and PTG [17,22,23], Additionally, some
studies found personality factors like optimism promoted resilience [32], extraversion
promoted PTG, and neuroticism was a barrier to PTG [27]. Other social factors were
inﬂuential, such as marital status (divorced people being more resilient) and occupation
(farmers and workers being more resilient) [23]. PTG was found to be inﬂuenced by
returning to work [18], narrative restructuring to reframe the accident [20], and coping
mechanisms [20,28].

Burn survivors who
perceived a higher level of
social support experienced
greater PTG. It was
proposed that perceived
social support is a key
element for the
psychological adjustment
of burn survivors.
The mediating role of the
spirituality suggests that
social support increases
PTG, both directly and
indirectly. There is a
positive association
between TBSA scores and
PTGI scores. Improving
social support and
spiritual wellbeing might
be an effective strategy for
enhancing PTG among
burn survivors.

The process of growth
emerges from distress,
aided by coping styles and
social support.

Burns involving the face
and hands reported more
growth The more severe
the burn the more growth
experienced. More PTG
with more time postburn.

Facilitating growth
through narrative may be
beneﬁcial. Patients could
also be assisted to

each of the four
types of resilience
(interstate,

Mean levels of
psychological
distress were
higher for females

signiﬁcance. Lower
levels of intrastate,
intertrait, and
intratrait resilience
and higher levels
of interstate
resilience predicted
psychological

Women show less
resilience than men
after trauma, and
show more distress.
This is interpreted
from the following
bservations: Inner
strength (Intratrait)
is higher in males
than women. The
positive
relationship
between interstate
resilience and
intrastate resilience
in males is
indicative of more
social support.
Males have wider
social support

Active coping was the
strongest predictor of
PTG.. Women reported
signiﬁcantly higher
levels of PTG than men.
Older adults (53–88
years) reported the
highest levels of PTG
(M = 3.47, 44–52 years;
M = 2.99, 37–43 years
M = 3.21, 16–36 years,

reported that they used
more active
problem-focused
coping strategies than
avoidant
coping-strategies
(t = 11.64, df = 147,
p < 0.001).
No gender differences
regarding coping,
social support, or
emotional distress.
Injury severity was not
associated with PTG.

Burn survivors who
indicated that their
religion was not a
source of strength and
comfort to them had
the lowest scores on the
NDES (F = 3.1,
df = 2.91, p = 0.05), and
those that indicated
that their religion was a
source of strength and
comfort to them (“a
great deal” vs. “a little”
or “none”) had the
highest scores on life
satisfaction (F = 5.97,
df = 2,86, p = 0.004).
PTGI-SF scores were
positively correlated
with TBSA (r = 0.24,
p = 0.02).

The PTG in the sample
was pronounced
regarding more
Appreciation of Life,
enhancement of
Relationships with
Others, and greater
sense of Personal
Strength.

The use of active
coping strategies and a
higher level of
perceived social
support were found to
be strongly associated
with more PTG, with
this being an
intervention avenue
that ought to be
considered by
treatment teams.

Distress and growth
can co-exist.

No signiﬁcant
correlations between
level of PTG and years
since injury, age, or
gender. Findings
reﬂected a positive
association of PTG with
injury severity when
the sample was divided
to <30 or >30% TBSA.
Religion/spiritually

In terms of the qualitative studies, both barriers and enablers to resilience were identi-
ﬁed (see Table 3). Barriers included seeing others in distress [58], needing to be prepared to
ask for help [58], maladaptive or negative coping styles [45], and worries about stigma or
rejection [45]. Another common barrier found by several studies was self-consciousness
or worries about the reactions and perceptions of others [17,36,45]. Barriers to PTG were
assessed by Martin et al. [45], and factors included emotional barriers (e.g., fear of rejection,
self-consciousness, embarrassment), situations barriers (e.g., questions from others), and
behavioral barriers (reactions from others, pressure garments), as well as avoidant coping
styles. Enablers of resilience included skills-based factors such as utilizing problem-solving
skills [35], improving social competence [35,37], having a sense of autonomy [35], re-
sourcefulness [35], critical thinking [35], and detaching from negativity [35]. Other themes
included factors related to personality such as having empathy [35,37], having strong
willpower [35,39], having a sense of optimism or hope [17,35,39], using humor [35,40],
and being curious about the world [39]. Positive coping was also indicative of enhanced
resilience [35,37,39,40,42,47,51], and shifting self-perception [37,49] and sharing or express-
ing one’s feelings [37]. Having a sense of altruism and spirituality were also identiﬁed
as enabling resilience [17,35,39,40,44,46,51], as was not being ashamed or embarrassed
about the scar [40]. The two most common factors enabling resilience were having a
positive life purpose or meaning [35,37,39,40,42,44,47,51], and having good social or peer
support [17,37,39,40,44,49,51].

Four qualitative studies looked at barriers and enablers of PTG [37,40,44,51]. Again,
across all studies, positive relationships were important in fostering PTG [37,40,44,51].
Further, shifting self-perception and life outlook [37,51], acknowledging one’s personal
strength [44,51], new possibilities [44], spirituality [24], gratitude [40,44], humor [40],
managing emotions [51], effective coping [40,51], altruism [51], and more sharing with
others [51].

3.3. Question Two: Interventions Targeting Resilience or PTG after Burns

There was only one qualitative study that investigated the impact of a burn camp for
children on psychosocial outcomes and found that the social environment of a burn camp
greatly enhanced resilience [49]. In particular, the camp improved the children’s conﬁdence,
psychological recovery, it normalized their experiences, and provided social support.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to describe the constructs of resilience and growth within the burn
injury context, examine the risk factors that inhibit resilience or growth after burn (barriers),
the factors that promote resilience or PTG after burn (enablers), and to assess the impact
of interventions that have been tested that may facilitate resilience or growth after burn.
Findings were mixed for most studies; however, there were factors related to demographic
information, burn-speciﬁc characteristics, person-speciﬁc factors, psychopathology, and
psychosocial and social factors that were evidenced to be related to resilience and PTG. It is
important to remember the differences in the construct of resilience and growth.

For age, one study found that being younger promoted resilience [29], another that
showed older participants demonstrated more PTG [30], and another that contradicted this
ﬁnding of no signiﬁcant association between age and PTG [23]. In other populations, PTG is
typically associated with younger age [59,60], and thus these results should be interpreted
with caution given the variability in ﬁndings. For gender, associations with resilience
were reported to be higher in women in one study [28], yet lower in others [21], [28]. In
these latter two studies, lower levels of resilience presented with higher levels of stress
symptoms. In addition, the gender differences were thought to be mediated by higher levels
of social support for males in the local cultural environment, but this was not statistically
investigated. However, associations between gender and PTG differed to the associations
between gender and resilience, with women reporting higher levels of PTG compared to
men [30], although another study found no gender differences [23].

Eur. Burn J. 2022, 3

118

Most studies showed larger TBSA being associated with higher levels of PTG [18–20,23,31];
however, another study found no relationship between TBSA and PTG [30], but this was
possibly due to study design. The positive association between TBSA and PTG might be due
to the inﬂuence of high levels of stress leading to more growth [20], which is consistent with
theories of PTG [8,61]. In addition, scar visibility might affect resilience or PTG [9,40,43],
although functionality might be more important to recovery than aesthetics [40]. As time
moves on after the burn event, burn survivors may do better [57], and those burnt as
children might do better in terms of social support compared to adults [43]. Not all studies
reported time since burn, and further research is required to assess long-term trajectories.
Individual factors related to resilience or PTG included personality and potential
psychopathology. Optimism is a personality factor that might contribute to resilience [21,23]
and has been suggested to boost PTG by affecting subjective wellbeing [23]. Optimism has
been found to promote PTG in other clinical populations such as patients with HIV [62]. The
personality trait of extraversion was found to predict positive change, whilst neuroticism
was found to increase distress and impede PTG [27].

The role of spirituality is interesting, those who have a faith ﬁnd more inner strength,
and both spiritual change and inner strength are components of PTG [55]. Spirituality has
been shown to have a positive association with resilience [31] and growth [19,27] and the
importance of offering pastoral support to patients should not be underestimated [17].

Adaptive coping mechanisms (such as positive reframing, humor, planning, resource-
fulness, downward comparison, acceptance, and focusing on the future in a positive way)
were all found to promote resilience and PTG [18,26,35,39,40,43,44,48,58]. Distress was
found to be related to resilience and PTG, and it is thought that this is because those in
distress might need to adopt new ways of thinking about a situation that is not able to be
changed. Stress is thought to precede PTG [18,20] and stress and PTG co-exist [30]. This
theory is supported in research with other populations, whereby more stress or distress is
associated with more PTG [12,63]. Depression and anxiety were found to impede resilience
and PTG in some studies [26,36,40], but not others [18]. Studies in other populations (i.e.,
cancer) have found that PTG is related to fewer symptoms of depression [64]. Burn-related
studies that found depression to be a barrier to growth, suggest that this is due to the
overwhelming of coping resources that are necessary for growth to occur [58] or due to the
negative reframing that naturally occurs in depression [18].

Social support was overwhelmingly identiﬁed in this review to facilitate both resilience
and PTG. Speciﬁcally, we found that social support [17,18,20,22,31,34,37,39,40,44,49,51,65],
spirituality/religion [17,31,35,39,40,44,46,51], and a positive life purpose [35,37,39,40,44]
were the most commonly reported enablers of resilience and PTG. Further, having quality
relationships [26] and recognizing you are not alone [17,31] were notably important. It
should be stated though, that cultural differences may impact on the relationship between
spirituality and religion [51]. Concerns about burdening others by sharing experiences
were a social barrier that was a barrier to PTG [40,44]. The results found in this study are
in line with research on PTG in non-burn populations, such as rheumatoid arthritis [59].
The process by which growth occurs can only be explored with rich contextual data from
qualitative studies, and these suggest that growth arises from deep introspection [39] that
leads to a new worldview to create coherence in their own personal narratives of their
lives [48] and the need to ﬁnd some meaning in the situation [51]. This is similar to PTG
after other types of trauma, and is central to related background theories [55,65].

One qualitative study conducted an intervention to promote resilience and found that
encouraging social support via a burn camp could help improve resilience in children [49].
One other study audited peer support as a potential mechanism for intervention to pro-
mote resilience and PTG and noted it would be a promising area to target [58], which is
logical given the overwhelming evidence in this study supporting social factors in the en-
couragement of resilience and PTG [17,18,20,22,31,34,37,39,40,44,49,51,65]. Future studies
should target adult populations, as there were no interventions for this group despite poor
psychosocial outcomes being an issue for this population [4]. Interventions could focus on

methods to promote deliberate rumination and introspection [39], teach adaptive coping
styles [58], and teach clinicians and parents how to recognize ‘red ﬂags’ and promote
‘green ﬂags’ (i.e., symptoms of PTSD and PTG) [58]. Finally, as it appears that depression
is a factor in resilience and PTG, clinicians should screen burn patients for symptoms of
depression, to optimize psychosocial recovery and ensure a good personal environment for
PTG to occur.

Interventions, Limitations, and Future Considerations

This study found several limitations in the existing literature on resilience and PTG in
populations that have experienced a burn, which could drive future research and clinical
practice. Firstly, the studies were heterogeneous in their scope and methodology, which
made synthesis difﬁcult and rendering us unable to conduct a meta-analysis. There needs to
be more research in the underlying mechanisms of both resilience and PTG. Further to this,
there were only two small longitudinal studies on the progression on PTG [18,58], which
makes understanding PTG as a process difﬁcult. There also needs to be more research
conducted on child and adolescent populations, given this is a large demographic for burn
injuries. We do not currently know how the presentation or trajectory of PTG differs in
pediatric versus adult populations.

5. Conclusions

Resilience and PTG are important constructs to understand given that individuals
who experience a burn injury are a high-risk population for longer term mental health
issues. This study has presented a variety of factors that inhibit or encourage resilience
and PTG, such as demographic, individual, and social factors. We also present sugges-
tions on interventions that may be used to promote growth following this adverse event,
such as improving social support, coping styles, and deliberate positive introspection.
Ideally, clinicians and family members/parents would also be aware of the importance
of resilience and PTG and be able to look out for and promote these phenomena when
treating burns patients.
