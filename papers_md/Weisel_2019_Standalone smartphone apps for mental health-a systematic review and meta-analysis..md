While smartphone usage is ubiquitous, and the app market for smartphone apps targeted at mental health is growing rapidly, the
evidence of standalone apps for treating mental health symptoms is still unclear. This meta-analysis investigated the efﬁcacy of
standalone smartphone apps for mental health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in February 2018 on randomized
controlled trials investigating the effects of standalone apps for mental health in adults with heightened symptom severity,
compared to a control group. A random-effects model was employed. When insufﬁcient comparisons were available, data was
presented in a narrative synthesis. Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder symptom severity speciﬁcally
targeted at by the app. In total, 5945 records were identiﬁed and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two
independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3681 participants were included in the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4),
substance use (k = 5), self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems (k = 2). Effects on depression
(Hedges’ g = 0.33, 95%CI 0.10–0.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I2 = 59%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21–0.57, NNT =
4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I2 = 0%) were signiﬁcant. No signiﬁcant pooled effects were found for anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, or alcohol
use (g = −0.14 to 0.18). Effect sizes for single trials ranged from g = −0.05 to 0.14 for PTSD and g = 0.72 to 0.84 for insomnia.
Although some trials showed potential of apps targeting mental health symptoms, using smartphone apps as standalone
psychological interventions cannot be recommended based on the current level of evidence.

INTRODUCTION
As mobile phone usage is ubiquitous, and mobile apps targeted at
mental health are ﬂooding the app market, mobile health
interventions, which utilize mobile devices and
(mHealth)
gaining
technologies
popularity.1,2

problems,

are

Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, can often
have a detrimental impact on the life of affected individuals, and,
to date, remain greatly undertreated.3,4 Although a wide array of
evidence-based treatments exist, the majority of individuals with
symptoms of mental disorders remain without treatment, even in
high-income economies.5,6

Apart from structural treatment barriers such as availability,
affordability, and time constraints, attitudinal factors play an even
greater role in non-treatment-seeking behavior.7 Contributing
factors hindering treatment uptake and treatment continuation
include low perceived treatment need, poor mental health
literacy, preference for self-reliance, and fear of stigmatization.7,8
Mobile devices could be utilized to overcome some of these
issues. mHealth interventions utilizing apps on mobile devices
have several beneﬁts: (a) The threshold to use them is generally
low and they provide the opportunity to engage individuals in
need of treatment timely and anonymously by providing portable
and ﬂexible treatment; (b) mHealth might reach individuals who
would otherwise not seek treatment;9 (c) most individuals already
experience mobile devices to be an integral part of their everyday
life and forthcoming generations are growing up as digital natives,
where the use of apps for many different areas of life is becoming
natural;10 (d) mHealth could be utilized to deliver large-scale
interventions in emerging and low-income economies where

resources for mental health are greatly limited,4 and (e) individuals
can be supported in applying treatment-related skills in real life
situations, in which behavior change is at its most vulnerable, and
clinicians often struggle to support individuals appropriately.

The app-scape (app landscape) targeting mental health has
increasingly been growing. According to a 2017 report, more than
318,000 health-related mobile apps were available for consumers
of which 490 unique apps were targeted at mental health and
behavioral disorders.11 A 2016 study scanning the app markets
found 208 apps related to mental health or stress, most commonly
targeting symptom relief (41%, 85/208) or general mental health
education (18%, 37/208). The majority of identiﬁed apps did not
mention any information on its effectiveness (59%, 123/208).12
Another study from 2018 rated the quality of depression apps
available in German app stores with only 11% (4/38) showing
some face validity, without any evidence on the effectiveness, and
safety of any of the apps.13

Apps have been highly praised for their potential towards
physical and mental health treatments.14 However, when con-
sidering using apps for mental health, there are also potential
pitfalls. Disadvantages include technical aspects of delivery, such
as screen size, battery life, system updates, technology require-
ments, as well as usage patterns, such as frequent but brief daily
smartphone interactions, attentional competition between apps,
short app lifespans, non-private settings, and data-security
concerns.15–17

Unexpectedly, only very few studies have systematically
examined the overall efﬁcacy of mobile apps for mental health.
A systematic review from 2013 by Donker et al., only found ﬁve
apps, of which only three were evaluated in an RCT; targeting

depression, anxiety and substance use, and with-in and between-
group intention-to-treat effect sizes ranged from 0.29 to 2.28 at
post-assessment and 0.01 to 0.48 at follow-up.18

Menon et al., conducted a systematic review on the feasibility of
mobile phone apps and other mobile phone-based technology for
psychotherapy in mental health disorders.19 Of 24 eligible articles,
only eight involved smartphone apps. The eligible apps were
found to be feasible and acceptable; however, no statistical
analysis on the pooled efﬁcacy was conducted.

There have also been previous systematic and meta-analytic
disorder-speciﬁc examinations of efﬁcacy, which found small
effects for reductions in total anxiety scores from smartphone
interventions compared to control conditions (g = 0.33, 95%CI
0.17–0.48, P < 0.01)20 and small effects for reductions in depressive
symptoms from smartphone apps compared to control conditions
(g = 0.38, 95%CI 0.24–0.52, P < 0.001).21 However, in both reviews,
studies were included which did not primarily target depression or
anxiety,
including apps for memory training and attentional
control, so that the effect of apps designed for anxiety and
depression remains unclear, as well as the effect of apps
individuals explicitly seek as treatment for a speciﬁc psychological
disorder.

Although apps have been present for approximately ten years
and are already being utilized by individuals seeking help for
mental health problems, their overall efﬁcacy remains unknown.
Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue systematically. The aim
standalone
of
to investigate whether
psychological
interventions for mental health delivered via
smartphone apps are efﬁcacious in reducing symptoms of mental
disorders and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (STBs)
in
adults with heightened symptom severity.

RESULTS
A total of 5921 records were retrieved from the electronic
databases. After removal of duplicates and exclusion based on
title and abstract, 165 records remained for full text screening.
Seventeen publications describing 19 trials fulﬁlling all inclusion
criteria between intervention and control groups remained and
were included. Interrater reliability of full text eligibility check was
good (κ = 0.64). Figure 1 displays the study ﬂow (reference list of
included trials Supplementary References).

All included studies were conducted in high-income countries
(k = 11 USA, k = 3 Australia, k = 1 Israel, k = 1 the Netherlands,
k = 1 South Korea, k = 1 Sweden, and k = 1 Switzerland). The
primary study outcomes of
the 19 included studies were
depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), posttraumatic stress disorder
(k = 2), sleep problems (k = 2), substance use: smoking (k = 3),
substance use: drinking (k = 3), and self-injury and suicidal
behavior (k = 4). One study addressed smoking and drinking
simultaneously. Several studies also assessed anxiety (k = 8) and
depression (k = 12), either as primary or secondary outcomes.

All primary study outcomes only utilized self-report measures
which were assessed at baseline and at post-assessment. Sample
size of the included studies ranged from n = 34 to n = 983. The 19
included studies used different types of comparators: k = 2 no-
treatment controls, k = 9 wait-list control groups, k = 3 informa-
tion only, k = 4 sham group, and k = 1 daily mood chart.

All eligible apps were found to be based on some type of
framework: cognitive behavioral
therapeutic
evaluative conditioning (k = 1),22 attentional bias modiﬁcation
(k = 2), mindfulness (k = 1), behavioral modiﬁcation (k = 1), theory
(k = 1), breathing retraining (k = 1),

App and intervention components
In a further exploration of the studies, we reported the app and
intervention components as described. All app features identiﬁed
in the studies were used as a category to give an overview of how
many other studies applied similar techniques. Of the 19 studies,
eight (42%, 8/19) employed some type of symptom or behavior
monitoring, active participant engagement was utilized in eight
interventions which prompted participant engagement by expli-
citly requesting input
(42%, 8/19), eight studies described
mechanisms of tailoring based on context sensing, feedback or
input (42%, 8/19), some sort of gamiﬁcation was utilized in six
studies (32%, 6/19), ﬁve studies sent intervention reminders based
on adherence monitoring (26%, 5/19), four studies had some sort
of social component added (21%, 4/19), two studies employed
some sort of guidance (11%, 2/19), one study used a simulation of
situations (5%, 1/19), and one study evaluated an intervention
including a wearable device (5%, 1/19)
(overview of app
components is shown in Table 2).

Quality assessment
interrater reliability between the two independent
The initial
raters was considered good (κ = 0.67). Overall, risk of bias across
trials was considerable. Thirteen (68%, 13/19)
reported an
adequate sequence generation, while only seven studies (37%,
7/19) reported on adequate allocation concealment. Seven studies
(37%, 7/19) were rated as low risk concerning blinding of
participants and personnel when participants received some type
of sham treatment or app not knowing whether they received the
treatment or not. All studies used self-report assessments so that
blinding of outcome assessors was rated as not applicable. Twelve
studies (63%, 12/19) took adequate measures to deal with missing
data and described these methods at least partially. Concerning
outcome reporting, only six (32%, 6/19) study registrations were
retrievable in which studies had been registered and the
outcomes were reported as originally stated. Although all trials
were conducted in the last ten years and a priori trial registration
has become standard practice, very few studies complied. Only
one study (5%, 1/19) was assessed as having an overall low risk of
bias (no bias detected) and three studies (16%, 3/19) were
assessed with having a risk of bias in only one domain. More than
half of the studies (53%, 10/19) were assessed as having some sort
of bias in at least three domains (complete risk of bias rating is
shown in Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).

Depression
Data on the primary target depression was pooled from six
comparisons (n = 796). A signiﬁcant pooled effect of smartphone
apps compared to controls for depression was found with g = 0.33
(95%CI 0.10–0.57, P = 0.005). This translates to an NNT of 5.43.
Heterogeneity between trials was moderate (I2 = 59%, 95%CI
0–83%). Figure 2 shows the forest plot.

Furthermore, depression was assessed in 12 comparisons (n =
1544) as primary or secondary outcome in apps for depression,
anxiety, sleep problems, PTSD, and suicidal ideation. The pooled
effect was signiﬁcant in favor of smartphone apps compared to
control groups with g = 0.34 (95%CI 0.18–0.49, P ≤ 0.001) which
corresponds with an NNT of 5.26. Heterogeneity was moderate
(I2 = 53%, 95%CI 10–76%) (forest plot Supplementary Fig. 4).

There was a signiﬁcant effect of apps compared to controls for
overall depression when analyzing trials that employed a wait-list

Anxiety
Anxiety was investigated in four comparisons (n = 479). Differ-
ences between smartphone apps and controls were not
signiﬁcant (g = 0.30, 95%CI −0.1 to 0.7, P = 0.145) and hetero-
geneity was high (I2 = 75%, 95%CI 31–91%) (forest plot Supple-
mentary Fig. 3).

Anxiety was also assessed in eight comparisons (n = 948) as
either primary or secondary outcome of apps for anxiety,
depression, and one app for sleep problems. In this analysis, we
found smartphone apps to be superior to controls with a pooled
effect of g = 0.43 (95%CI 0.19–0.66, P ≤ 0.001) which was
signiﬁcant, and relates to an NNT of 4.2. Heterogeneity was
moderate to high (I2 = 66%, 95%CI 28–84%) (forest plot Supple-
mentary Fig. 5).

Trials which employed a wait-list (k = 6) had a signiﬁcant mean
effect for overall anxiety of g = 0.49 (95%CI 0.27–0.71, P ≤ 0.001,
NNT = 3.68,
I2 = 47%, 95%CI 0–79%). Only two trials (k = 2)
employed another type of control group which is why the effects
were not pooled.

Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors
Suicidal ideation was assessed in four comparisons (n = 286), of
which three used the same intervention, the pooled effect was
non-signiﬁcant with an effect size of g = −0.14 (95%CI −0.37 to
0.1, P = 0.246). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%, 95%CI 0–85%).
Self-injury was assessed in three comparisons (n = 225) by the
same authors evaluating the same intervention, and the pooled
effect was not signiﬁcant (g = −0.04, 95%CI −0.31 to 0.22, P =
0.746). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%, 95%CI 0–80%) (forest plot
Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).

Substance use
Three comparisons (n = 780) investigated the effects on smoking
and found a small signiﬁcant effect of apps compared to control
groups (g = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21–0.57, NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001) and low
heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 0%, 95%CI 0–93%).

Three comparisons (n = 1040) that investigated the effects on
drinking did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of smartphone apps
compared to controls (g = −0.03, 95%CI −0.22 to 0.17, P = 0.774,
I2 = 48%, 95%CI 0–85%).

Effects on substance use were also pooled for smoking and
drinking from ﬁve comparisons, with no signiﬁcant difference
between intervention and controls (g = 0.18, 95%CI −0.09 to 0.45,
P = 0.2). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 81%, 95%CI 54–92%) (forest
plots Supplementary Figs 6–8).

Posttraumatic stress disorder
Data on PTSD was not pooled over trials due to only two
comparisons. Both trials evaluated the same intervention with
both trials not ﬁnding signiﬁcant effects
the
intervention versus control group (g = 0.14, 95%CI −0.22 to 0.5,
n = 120, P = 0.439;23 and g = −0.05, 95%CI −0.6 to 0.51, n = 49,
P = 0.87324).

in favor of

Sleep problems
Due to the limited amount of comparisons (k = 2) data for sleep
problems was not pooled over trials. Both trials found signiﬁcant
effects in favor of the intervention group, with medium to large
effects on sleep problems (g = 0.84, 95%CI 0.17–1.51, P = 0.014,

Differences between ﬁndings in the present study for app-
based standalone interventions targeting mental health symp-
toms and those often found for internet-delivered mental health
interventions might be explained by systematic differences in
patient, trial, or intervention characteristics. For example, guidance
has been associated with higher effect sizes in digital mental
health interventions,34 and many of the here included trials
evaluated purely self-guided interventions without support from a
professional. However, recent trials also indicate signiﬁcant and
moderate to large effects for unguided internet mental health
interventions for some disorders such as anxiety or insomnia.35,36
Research has suggested that efﬁcacy of apps is also dependent on
long-term adherence to an app, otherwise the impact may be
limited, and prompts where shown to increase effectiveness.37 Far
fewer
the investigated studies employed such
strategies; eight studies prompted participant engagement by
explicitly requesting input and only ﬁve studies sent intervention
reminders based on adherence.

than half of

Also, considering other app and intervention components
utilized in the investigated apps,
it seems that only a small
portion of the uniquely available features of apps were actually
used, which when applied correctly, might have the potential to
compensate for other disadvantages of smartphone apps. It might
also be helpful for individuals to have a ﬁxed time and space to go
through an intervention which might not be compatible with the
general manner in which smartphones are used, e.g. when waiting
in line or in a public space. The technological advantages of app-
based interventions may not yet be so advanced to level out
disadvantages of this approach; this might however change in the
near future.

Overall, our knowledge of how to design effective mental
health apps is very much at the beginning. Unlike established
internet interventions, in which manuals for onsite psychotherapy
can be directly translated and work very well, clinicians and
researchers might need to start thinking outside of the box, and
direct greater attention to the technological and persuasive
design aspects of app-based interventions. Not being able to
detect efﬁcacy in many of the mental health domains might be
based on an actual failure to deliver mental health treatment
through mobile apps, however, this might also be based on the
inefﬁcacious manner in which the treatments were deployed and
implemented.

Also, our ﬁndings do not refer to the use of apps as an adjunct
to evidence-based treatments i.e. blended formats38 such as face-
to-face39 or internet-based psychotherapy.9 One possibility to
beneﬁt from apps that already show small effects such as for
depression, smoking, and sleep problems could be to have them
integrated into a clinical setting in which a professional can
monitor progress and provide additional support. This is a
potentially
investigated
systematically.

DISCUSSION
Only 19 eligible trials were identiﬁed which evaluated the efﬁcacy
of a smartphone app designed to treat mental health symptoms in
a randomized controlled trial, although hundreds of apps for
mental health are available in the consumer app markets. This
evaluation gap is in line with previous ﬁndings.13,27 All trials were
conducted in high-income countries.

Signiﬁcant pooled effects were found for depression (g = 0.33)
and smoking (g = 0.39), with small effect sizes and moderate
heterogeneity. No signiﬁcant pooled effects were found for
anxiety, alcohol use, and STBs. Additionally, when exploring
effects on depression (g = 0.34) and anxiety (g = 0.43), regardless
whether this was the primary aim of the intervention, pooled
effects were signiﬁcant, but heterogeneity was moderate to high.
These effect sizes are in line with previous research investigating
the efﬁcacy of apps for depression and anxiety regardless of
whether the app was aimed at depression or anxiety, or another
mental health domain.20,21 Both trials targeting PTSD did not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant effects of the evaluated interventions, whereas both
trials on insomniac complaints did, with medium to large effect
sizes. Overall, risk of bias was found to be considerate.

Interestingly, effects for most mental health domains were
much smaller than what has been found in meta-analytic reviews
for digital mental health interventions delivered using the internet
(for an overview see e.g. ref. 28). For example, whereas effects on
depression were small in the present analysis, the most recent
meta-analyses on digital interventions targeting Major Depression
found a mean standardized effect size of 0.90.29 Also, the non-
signiﬁcant effects on anxiety are somewhat surprising, given that
meta-analytic reviews on internet-based interventions for anxiety
found, when compared to passive control conditions, large effects;
for example for social anxiety (g = 0.84)30 and general anxiety
(g = 0.91)5 as well as for panic disorder (g = 0.83).31 The same
goes for PTSD, for which the most recent review found an average
pooled effect of 0.95,32 while the two only randomized trials that
we were able to include in this study evaluating standalone apps
for PTSD did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects. A different picture
emerges when focusing on sleep problems. Although the effects
of the two trials evaluating apps for insomniac symptoms were
somewhat smaller than the average effects found for internet-
based self-help interventions (g = 1.09), their conﬁdence intervals
overlap.33

These ﬁndings imply that the accumulating evidence for digital
mental health interventions delivered through the internet as an
effective mean to treat mental health disorders cannot be directly
translated to digital interventions delivered via standalone mobile
apps for all mental disorders.

Limitations
When interpreting the ﬁndings, the following limitations should
in most
be considered. First, heterogeneity was substantial
analyses, as was risk of bias. As there were limited studies per
disorder, also in the narrative description of study effects, ﬁndings
should be interpreted with caution. Our ﬁndings of limited or non-
existent efﬁcacy of standalone treatment delivered by smartphone
apps could also be due to the limited amount of studies available.
Heterogeneity was not explored in a content-focused manner, nor
did we investigate the effects of different features and compo-
nents on efﬁcacy or engagement. Overall, the limited efﬁcacy does
not mean that apps for mental health do not work in general but
could also be an indication that the deployment and implementa-
tion so far has been unsuccessful. Also, we did not monitor or
investigate whether the onboarding process happened in person
or virtually which in turn might inﬂuence engagement. Engage-
ment should be investigated in future studies.

Furthermore, the search was restricted to publications in English
and German language. Due to the small amount of studies per
disorder, the number of comparisons per disorder was limited,
therefore not all study effects could be pooled, subgroup analyses
were restricted, follow-up assessments were not examined, nor
was publication bias explored. We originally planned to investi-
gate (1) standalone smartphone apps for mental health and (2)
hybrid apps and blended care apps. However, due to differing
search strings and the already extensive scope of the primary
research question, we decided to no longer investigate the second
question within this manuscript.

Future research
Although the potential smartphones bear to deliver mental health
treatment is evident, future research needs to clarify whether the
present
true and identify in which
circumstances their potential could be increased. The develop-
ment of digital mental health services should be user-driven and
solution-focused,
researchers and
including app developers,
clinicians in the process.37,40–42 It is important to investigate app
features and components, which make smartphone apps unique
delivery modalities, such as context sensing, constant access and
availability, high likelihood that prompts are received in daily life,
and the combination possibilities with physiological assessments.
The feature-driven approach could be helpful to understand
working mechanisms of apps for mental health. Therefore, more
speciﬁc aspects of mobile apps should be investigated and
systematically tested, as well as long-term effects. Apps need to be
implemented by utilizing persuasive design aspects and by
exploiting full

effectiveness. It is also very likely that engagement is linked to
efﬁcacy of apps for mental health, which is why adherence, user
proﬁles, and usage patterns should be further investigated.

Conclusion
There remains a lack of generalizable evidence to support
particular standalone smartphone apps for mental health as a
substitute to conventional mental health treatment. Although we
found a small effect for depression as well as indications for the
use of apps for smoking and sleep problems, heterogeneity was
substantial and overall risk of bias was high. Moreover, the
insigniﬁcant ﬁndings on STBs, PTSD as well as alcohol use
highlight the need for discussing the potential harm of currently
available apps, which might keep users away from evidence-based
interventions while bearing a substantial risk of being ineffective.

METHODS
The review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reporting
is based on PRISMA.43,44 This study was registered in the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews of the
National Institute for Health Research (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/
prospero/) under the ID CRD42017076515.

Eligibility criteria
We included (a) randomized controlled trials which (b) investigated
the effects of a standalone psychological intervention for a speciﬁc
mental health domain (c) delivered via a standalone smartphone
app (d) aiming to reduce symptoms of a mental disorder or STBs (e)
which the app was speciﬁcally targeted at. The trials must have
included (f) an adult (≥18 years) population (g) with heightened
symptom severity of a mental disorder according to DSM-IV or DSM-
V45,46 or STBs (h) assessed by a diagnostic instrument or a
predeﬁned symptom cut-off (i) which was identical to the primary
target of the study (j) compared to a control condition. Only (k)
published peer-review articles (l)
in English and German were
considered. We decided to include STBs as they are pervasive
among individuals with serious mental disorders.

A psychological

intervention was deﬁned as an intervention
aimed at behavior change and reduction of mental disorder
burden speciﬁcally designed and implemented with the intention
to treat symptoms of mental disorders.

Search strategy
A systematic literature search was completed (until 8 February
2018)
in Pubmed, PsycInfo, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Key search terms
included a combination of three major themes: smartphone apps
and mobile health, mental disorders, and randomized controlled
trials (search string for Pubmed Supplementary Methods).

Study selection
After duplicate removal, all titles and abstracts were screened for
potential eligibility after which full text articles were assessed for
eligibility. Study selection was performed by two independent
researchers (K.K.W. and L.M.F.). Interrater reliability is reported for the
initial agreement on full text eligibility where values of kappa are
rated as fair (κ = 0.4–0.59), good (κ = 0.6–0.74), or excellent (κ >
0.75).47 Disagreement was resolved through discussion.
If no
consensus could be achieved, a third researcher was consulted (D.
D.E.).

Data extraction
The following data was extracted: (a) authors, year of publication,
citation, (b) study design (sample size, study inclusion criterion,
type of control group, target outcomes), (c) sample characteristics
(age, gender), (d) treatment (theory basis, app and intervention
components), and (e) data for calculation of effect sizes (outcome
data preferably intention-to-treat (ITT) data, study dropout rate,
handling of missing data).
If data was not retrievable from
publication, study authors were contacted for clariﬁcation.

Quality assessment
Study quality was assessed independently by two researchers (K.K.
W. and L.M.F.) based on the six basic criteria of the Cochrane Risk of
Bias Assessment Tool: random sequence generation, allocation
sequence concealment, blinding of participants and personnel,
blinding of outcome assessors,
incomplete outcome data, and
selective reporting. Based on predeﬁned deﬁnitions, studies were
rated as “low”, “high”, or “unclear” risk of bias in each of these
categories. When self-report measures were used to assess

9

outcomes, blinding of outcome assessors were rated as not
applicable (NA). When a study protocol or trial registration was
identiﬁed and the primary outcome was reported as previously
stated, selective outcome reporting was rated as low,
if neither
existed, selective reporting was rated as unclear. Studies which were
rated as low on all available criteria were rated as overall low risk of
bias. Interrater reliability of the risk of bias assessment is reported.

Statistical analyses
Trials with the same primary target outcome were pooled to
generate a mean effect size for each investigated outcome. If more
than one measurement per outcome was assessed, the mean of the
effect sizes was used to provide one effect size per study per
outcome, to generate a mean effect size, only instruments were
used related to the primary measure of the disorder. For each
comparison between a smartphone app treatment and a control
condition we calculated the effect size Hedges’ g (g), the 95%
conﬁdence interval (95%CI) and P-value (P) for each target outcome
based on the post-assessment values indicating the difference
between the two groups (intervention group versus control group)
at post-assessment. For additional
interpretability from a clinical
perspective the number needed to treat (NNT) is reported for
positive signiﬁcant effects according to the method by Kraemer and
Kupfer.48 In cases in which too few comparisons (k < 3) were
available to pool data, data is presented in a narrative synthesis. Due
to expected heterogeneity between trials, a random effects model
was applied in all analyses. If trials were multi-armed, reporting two
comparisons to one comparison, we divided the sample size to
avoid inﬂating power.43

Heterogeneity between trials is expressed by I2 and its 95%
conﬁdence interval to express the percentage of total variance
It can roughly be divided into three
which can be explained.
low (25%), moderate (50%), or high (75%).49 The
thresholds:
conﬁdence interval was calculated by using the formula provided
by Borenstein.50

In an additional analysis, the overall effects of all comparisons
providing data on anxiety and depression after treatment with a
smartphone app were each considered, no matter outcome status
as primary or secondary. Potential sources of heterogeneity
between trials were investigated by conducting subgroup
analyses on different types of control groups. The subgroup
analyses were conducted according to the mixed-effect model, in
this model subgroups are pooled with the random-effects model
while tests for signiﬁcant differences between subgroups are
conducted with the ﬁxed-effects model.

Indications for publication bias were explored by investigating the
funnel plot visually, and conducting Egger’s test.51 To obtain an
estimation of the pooled effect when accounting for missing studies,
the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-ﬁll analysis was performed.52

All statistical analyses were calculated with the comprehensive

meta-analysis (CMA) software, version 3 (Biostat, Inc.).
