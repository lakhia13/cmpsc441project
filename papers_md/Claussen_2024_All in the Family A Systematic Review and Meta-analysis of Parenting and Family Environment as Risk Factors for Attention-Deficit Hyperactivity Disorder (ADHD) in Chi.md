Abstract
Parenting and family environment have significant impact on child development, including development of executive func-
tion, attention, and self-regulation, and may affect the risk of developmental disorders including attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD). This paper examines the relationship of parenting and family environment factors with  
ADHD. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in 2014 and identified 52 longitudinal studies. A follow-up 
search in 2021 identified 7 additional articles, for a total of 59 studies that examined the association of parenting factors 
with ADHD outcomes: ADHD overall (diagnosis or symptoms), ADHD diagnosis specifically, or presence of the specific 
ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For parenting factors that were present in three or more 
studies, pooled effect sizes were calculated separately for dichotomous or continuous ADHD outcomes, accounting for each 
study’s conditional variance. Factors with sufficient information for analysis were parenting interaction quality (sensitivity/
warmth, intrusiveness/reactivity, and negativity/harsh discipline), maltreatment (general maltreatment and physical abuse), 
parental relationship status (divorce, single parenting), parental incarceration, and child media exposure. All factors showed 
a significant direct association with ADHD outcomes, except sensitivity/warmth which had an inverse association. Parent-
ing factors predicted diagnosis and overall symptoms as well as inattentive and hyperactive symptoms when measured, 
but multiple factors showed significant heterogeneity across studies. These findings support the possibility that parenting 
and family environment influences ADHD symptoms and may affect a child’s likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD. 
Prevention strategies that support parents, such as decreasing parenting challenges and increasing access to parent training 
in behavior management, may improve children’s long-term developmental health.

Parents, and other primary caregivers (hereinafter referred 
to as parents), have a strong influence on children’s devel-
opment starting in infancy (National Academies of Sci-
ences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), 2016b). Par-
ents affect their child’s development directly through daily 
interaction and communication, parents shape the child’s 
environment and protect them from risks, and parents are the 
child’s first role models for interactions with the larger social 
world (Kiff et al., 2011). Extensive evidence has shown the 
importance of early environment on social, emotional, and 
behavioral development (NASEM, 2019b), and the key role 
that parents play (NASEM, 2016b). However, the relation-
ship is influenced by both the parent and child, including 
by the child’s communicative and interactive characteristics 
and by the parent’s responses to the child’s signals (Kiff  
et al., 2011).

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a 
neurobehavioral  condition,  characterized  by  challenges 
with regulation of attention, emotion, and behavior (Ameri-
can Psychiatric Association, 2013), with multiple risk fac-
tors and possible causes (Faraone et al., 2021). Heritability 
of ADHD has been well documented, but environmental 
influences,  either  directly  or  through  gene-environment 
interactions, are likely to play a significant role in whether 
symptoms become severe and impairing, thus warranting 
diagnosis and treatment (Faraone & Larsson, 2019; Faraone 
& Mick, 2010; Faraone et al., 2021; Freitag & Retz, 2010; 
Humphreys & Zeanah, 2015). Given that the development 
of  behavior  and  emotions  is  strongly  affected  by  child-
hood experiences, parenting behaviors and family context 
may affect the development and expression of behavioral 
symptoms of ADHD (Humphreys & Zeanah, 2015; Sonuga-
Barke & Halperin, 2010). The present paper explores factors 
related to parenting and the likelihood of developing ADHD.
Parenting can influence the child’s development of self-
regulation and behavior through multiple pathways. One 
important influence is through daily interactions with the 
child (Haltigan et al., 2013; NASEM, 2016). Quality of 
attachment, which indicates the degree of feeling safe and 
protected by the parent, has long-term impact on emotional 
development, including the likelihood of developing mental 
disorders (Fearon et al., 2010). Parental sensitivity to the 
child’s signals and supportive responsiveness during inter-
actions are necessary components of a secure parent–child 
relationship (Claussen & Crittenden, 2000). Positive and 
supportive parenting behaviors include being sensitive and 
warm in response to emotional needs, being engaged and 
involved, and having low levels of intrusive or emotion-
ally reactive behavior. By responding sensitively, secure 
attachment figures can support children in regulating their 
emotion and behavior and in developing executive func-
tion skills (Menon et al., 2020; Pallini et al., 2019). Con-
versely, a parent’s persistent lack of sensitivity and failure 
to respond supportively can result in a lack of predictability 
which impacts the development of the child’s regulatory 
processes (Auersperg et al., 2019; Murray & Murray, 2010; 
Pallini et al., 2019). Negative or hostile responses and harsh 
discipline have been associated with increased hyperactivity 
(Romano et al., 2006). At the extremes, parents may neglect 
basic needs or respond in harmful and abusive ways, and 
maltreated children may become hypervigilant and attend to 
their own safety rather than learn and explore, impairing the 
development of typical attentional processes (Humphreys & 
Zeanah, 2015; Pallini et al., 2019; Strathearn et al., 2020).

Extended separation from a parent, for example from 
parental incarceration, or from the instability of care and loss 
of a key attachment figure that can follow a divorce in some 
families, has a significant impact on children (D'Onofrio & 
Emery, 2019; NASEM, 2019b). Such loss affects children 

Prevention Science

even when the child experienced maltreatment (Goldsmith 
et al., 2004). Like maltreatment, trauma from separation 
and loss may impair children’s ability to develop executive 
function, self-regulation, and attention skills (Humphreys 
& Zeanah, 2015; van der Bij et al., 2020). Another type of 
family structure, single parenting, has also been identified as 
a factor that may influence child development, due to asso-
ciated factors such as increased role demand and decreased 
economic resources that are often present (Hilton et al., 
2001).

In addition to the direct impact through interactions, par-
ents can also shape children’s experiences and daily lives, 
such as by determining the amount and content of screen 
media such as television and video games to which a child 
is exposed (Maniccia et al., 2011). Excessive screen media 
exposure in early childhood has been examined as a possible 
risk factor for attention and self-regulation issues (Beyens 
et al., 2018; Christakis et al., 2004; Radesky et al., 2014). 
Healthy habits such as limiting young children’s access to 
screen media and monitoring the content are strongly influ-
enced by parents’ choices (Coyne et al., 2017). The amount 
and content of screen time may indicate parents’ choices 
regarding their child’s leisure time; excessive use of screen 
time may also indicate less time spent playing and interact-
ing with parents and others (Mendelsohn et al., 2011).

Understanding broad patterns of potential risk factors 
can help identify those that are potentially modifiable and 
might be addressed through prevention and intervention 
(Bitsko et al., this issue). The focus of the present paper is 
to summarize the risks for ADHD associated with parenting 
behaviors and the parent–child relationship as potentially 
modifiable factors. Family-centered interventions have been 
well documented to support parents and improve their abil-
ity to provide sensitive, stable, and nurturing care for their 
child (NASEM, 2016b). Parenting thus represents a poten-
tially modifiable risk factor through which the likelihood 
of developing ADHD, or more severe ADHD symptoms, 
may be changed. Given prior evidence, it was expected that 
characteristics of parenting would emerge as associated with 
ADHD symptoms and diagnosis. The present paper lever-
ages a large set of meta-analyses to examine the associations 
between parenting in early childhood and increased likeli-
hood of later ADHD symptoms and diagnosis.

Methods

Procedure

This paper is part of a series of systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses of potentially modifiable broad risk factors 
for ADHD. See Bitsko et al. (this issue) for details. Studies 
for the meta-analysis were identified using a comprehensive 

1 3 
Prevention Science 

literature search of PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), and 
EMBASE in 2014 using both a top-down and a bottom- 
up approach to identify articles that captured ADHD or 
symptoms of ADHD and studies indicating risk factors.  
See the 17 for search terms. The initial review for inclu-
sion was based on abstracts; for articles that received a full 
review, cited references also were checked for potential 
inclusion (iterative reference mining). The studies were 
examined for suitability using the abstract, reviewed based 
on methods, and clustered into conceptually related fac-
tors. Of the studies, 161 included parenting-related factors. 
Within these factors, clusters emerged around parental rela-
tionship status (divorce or single parenting), parental incar-
ceration, maltreatment, parenting interaction quality, and 
child media exposure. Figure 1 describes the flow chart for  
the review and inclusion process.

The final selection of articles was limited to those 
that involved human subjects, were published in English,  
and described research not duplicated in other included 
studies. Studies were included if they were longitudinal 
or retrospective; the parenting factor of note was iden-
tified prior to the assessment of ADHD. For example, 
studies that measured child media exposure or parenting 
interaction quality were only included if the measure-
ment of ADHD symptoms or diagnosis was conducted 
at a later time. Reports of factors could be retrospec-
tive, for example for maltreatment or marital status. The 
studies also needed to have sufficient statistical details  

to calculate effect sizes for the specific factor in ques-
tion (see Bitsko et al., this issue, for details). Statistical 
reporting of ADHD associations included dichotomous 
and continuous measurement, (e.g., dichotomous = odds 
ratios or categorical analyses; continuous = correlation 
coefficients or beta weights) which were analyzed sepa-
rately. Forest plots and overall effect sizes were calcu-
lated for any ADHD outcomes, including diagnosis or 
symptoms (referred to as “ADHD overall”), as well as 
for studies assessing ADHD diagnosis, inattention, or 
hyperactivity/impulsivity separately, when available.

Of the general parenting factor categories, parental rela-
tionship status, maltreatment, and parenting interaction 
quality were further separated into individual clustered fac-
tors when sufficient data were available, i.e., a minimum of 
three effect sizes. Parental relationship status factors were 
divorce and single parenthood. Parental incarceration was a 
single factor that included arrest. Maltreatment-related fac-
tors were general maltreatment (not differentiated by type, 
could include physical and emotional abuse and neglect, 
sexual abuse, exposure to violence, or unspecified maltreat-
ment) and physical abuse. Parenting interaction quality 
included sensitivity/warmth, intrusiveness/reactivity, and 
negativity/harsh discipline. Childhood media exposure was 
a single factor that included TV, video, and gaming. Several 
factors were initially targeted for analysis but not included 
in the final set of analyses due to fewer than three studies 
that met inclusion criteria, i.e., sexual abuse, neglect, foster

Search Strategy

The  search  used  terms  related  to  ADHD  diagnoses,  or 
ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and 
impulsivity including terms more commonly used in previ-
ous decades such as attention-deficit disorder, hyperkinetic 
disorder, or minimal brain dysfunction (see Bitsko et al., 
this issue, for details). The search strings relevant to par-
enting were foster care, single parent, institution, advers*, 
maltreatment, deprivation, trauma, rejection, discipline, 
attachment, electronic, television, TV, video game, or screen 
time. See the 17 for search terms. There were 50 studies that 
met inclusion criteria. Because the initial search strings did 
not include all of the key terms that emerged as potential 
factors (i.e., “abuse,” “neglect,” “involvement,” “intrusive,” 
“permissive,” and “sensitive”), a follow-up literature search 
using these terms was conducted to ensure that no relevant 
articles were omitted, which identified two further articles 
that had been included in the larger systematic search but not 
previously identified as assessing abuse. No additional arti-
cles on the other factors emerged for inclusion. The original 
set of 52 papers was used to establish the parenting factors 
of interest that are addressed in the present study.

The  search  focused  on  selected  words  describing  the 
social environment (see the 17) rather than all aspects of 
parenting; therefore, the included clusters are not an exhaus-
tive representation of all possible parent–child-related fac-
tors. Parental factors that are characteristics of the parent, 
such as mental health and stress, or substance abuse, are 
reviewed elsewhere (Maher et al., under review this issue; 
Robinson et al., this issue).

Follow‑up Literature Search

After the parenting factors of interest were established in the 
initial systematic review, an additional review of all litera-
ture published from 2014 until January 2021 was conducted 
using the same search terms (see the 17) to ensure that all 
relevant studies were included in the final manuscript. We 
identified 7 additional studies that met methodological and 
statistical criteria for inclusion in the final set of articles for 
the analyses.

Analyses

For each factor that reached or exceeded the minimum num-
ber of effect sizes (k ≥ 3), pooled analyses were conducted 
to calculate an overall pooled effect size for the association 
between the risk factor and any ADHD outcomes. Effect 

Prevention Science

sizes  were  calculated  separately  for  ADHD  outcomes 
depending  on  whether  study  findings  were  reported  as 
dichotomous versus continuous. More detailed analyses cal-
culated separate pooled effect sizes for ADHD diagnosis, 
inattentive symptoms, or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, 
whenever three or more eligible effect sizes were availa-
ble. For studies that reported on male and female children 
separately, effect sizes were averaged, and for studies that 
assessed mothers and fathers on the same predictive factor, 
scores were averaged across both parents. When multiple 
levels, dosages, or severities of exposures had possible effect 
sizes, the most severe exposure that met other inclusion cri-
teria (e.g., measured at least 6 months prior to the measure-
ment of ADHD) was included, to increase the sensitivity 
for detecting an association if present. See Bitsko et al. (this 
issue), for details on the meta-analytic methods.

For each dichotomous analysis, odds ratios (OR) with 
95%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  were  calculated,  and  for 
continuous factors, correlation coefficients (CC) with 95% 
CI were calculated. To examine heterogeneity of effects, 
Cochran’s Q test was used to describe the variation across 
study estimates (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986). As in other 
studies in this issue, the analyses used random-effects mod-
els, using weights to account for the variation in effect size 
between studies (Sutton et al., 2000). Compared to a fixed-
effect model, this provides a more conservative estimate of 
effect size (Berlin et al., 1989).

Results

The first literature search conducted in 2014 resulted in 
17,734 studies and the follow-up search resulted in 11,506 
additional studies. Among these studies, 161 were identified 
as relevant for parenting-related factors and a full review 
was conducted. Of the 161 studies fully reviewed, 59 studies 
addressed parenting-related factors and met all criteria, and 
thus were included in this meta-analysis. General parenting 
factor categories were parental relationship status (n = 16), 
parental incarceration (n = 3), maltreatment (n = 15), parent-
ing interaction quality (n = 16), and child media exposure 
(n = 12). See Fig. 1 for the selection flow chart and Table 1 
for studies included in the analyses.

Relation of Risk Factors to ADHD Outcomes

Across all analyses, these parenting factors were signifi-
cantly associated with ADHD outcomes, including all fac-
tors related to parental relationship status, parental incarcer-
ation, maltreatment, parenting interaction, and child media 
exposure. See Table 2 for the results of analyses. Forest plots 
are included in the Supplemental material.

Prevention Science

Parental Relationship Status

Divorce was significantly associated with risk for ADHD 
overall for both dichotomous (OR = 2.93; 95% CI: 1.54, 
5.55; k = 9) and continuous (CC = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.18; 
k = 4) effect sizes. These effect sizes showed significant het-
erogeneity for dichotomous (Q(8) = 14.32, p = 0.07) as well 
as continuous ADHD overall (Q(3) = 9.48, p = 0.02). There 
were also sufficient studies with dichotomous effect sizes 
(k = 4) for an analysis of divorce and ADHD diagnosis. Chil-
dren of divorced parents had a significantly increased risk of 
having an ADHD diagnosis later (OR = 4.84; 95% CI: 2.22, 
10.56), and this test was not significantly heterogeneous. For 
single parenting, only dichotomous effect sizes on ADHD 
overall had enough studies for analysis (k = 5). The test of 
heterogeneity was not significant. Single parenting was sig-
nificantly associated with increased risk of later ADHD in 
children (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.22), and heterogeneity 
was not significant. There were insufficient studies to sepa-
rately examine any effects on inattention or hyperactivity.

Parental Incarceration

For research on parental incarceration, only overall con-
tinuous effect sizes had enough studies for analysis (k = 3). 
Parental incarceration significantly predicted later ADHD 
overall (CC = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.14). The test for hetero-
geneity was not significant.

Maltreatment

For general maltreatment, the association with ADHD over-
all was positive for both dichotomous (OR = 7.27; 95% CI: 
4.23, 12.49; k = 6) and continuous (CC = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.18, 
0.42; k = 9) effect sizes. Tests of heterogeneity for general 
maltreatment were significant for continuous ADHD overall 
outcomes (Q(8) = 52.82, p < 0.001) but not for dichotomous 
outcomes. General maltreatment was also significantly asso-
ciated with ADHD diagnosis specifically, using dichotomous 
effect sizes (OR = 7.63; 95% CI: 3.95, 14.75; k = 5). There 
were sufficient studies (k = 7) to investigate the association of 
general maltreatment and inattentive symptoms using con-
tinuous effect sizes; children who experienced general mal-
treatment were significantly more likely to show inattentive 
symptoms (CC = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.40), which had sig-
nificant heterogeneity (Q(6) = 36.54, p < 0.001). When inves-
tigating specific types of maltreatment, the only type that 
had sufficient studies for analysis was physical abuse using 
continuous ADHD outcomes overall (k = 4). Experiencing

physical abuse was significantly associated with continuous 
ADHD outcomes overall (CC = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.47). 
The test for heterogeneity was not significant.

Parenting Interaction Quality

Among possible factors describing quality of parent–child 
interaction, three emerged as having sufficient studies to 
estimate pooled effect sizes for continuous ADHD over-
all.  Pooled  data  from  a  cluster  of  10  studies  measuring 
sensitivity/warmth  showed  a  negative  correlation  with 
continuous ADHD outcomes overall (CC =  − 0.16; 95% 
CI: − 0.20, − 0.12) and data from 4 studies investigating 
intrusive/reactive  interaction  behavior  showed  a  posi-
tive correlation with continuous ADHD outcomes overall 
(CC = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.26). Neither of the tests for het-
erogeneity was significant. Data from the 7 studies investi-
gating negativity/harsh discipline showed a positive associa-
tion with continuous ADHD outcomes overall (CC = 0.19; 
95% CI: 0.06, 0.32). For this factor, the test of heterogeneity 
showed significant heterogeneity (Q(6) = 57.21, p < 0.001). 
As seen in the forest plot (Supplemental Fig. S15), a sin-
gle study (Morrell & Murray, 2003) showed a correlation 
that was negative in direction while other effect sizes were 
all positive. Upon inspection, this correlation coefficient 
(− 0.232) was with a factor described as hostility, which 
was identical to the coefficient listed for positivity, coded at 
the same time from the same observation. No reverse cod-
ing was mentioned so the possibility of a reporting error 
could not be excluded. We re-calculated the effect size and 
heterogeneity for the factor with the correlation coefficient 
from Morrell and Murray (2003) excluded, and still found 
significant heterogeneity among the remaining effect sizes.
Of these three parenting interaction factors, only sen-
sitivity/warmth had sufficient studies to examine specific 
symptoms using continuous outcome scales (inattention 
and hyperactivity k = 5); sensitivity/warmth was inversely 
correlated with inattention symptoms (CC =  − 0.17; 95% 
CI: − 0.24, − 0.10) as well as hyperactivity (CC =  − 0.14, 
95% CI: − 0.21, − 0.07). Neither set of pooled correlation 
coefficients was significantly heterogeneous.

Child Media Exposure

For child media exposure, there was a positive associa-
tion with overall ADHD for both dichotomous outcomes 
(OR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.57, 2.30; k = 6) and continuous out-
comes (CC = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12; k = 9); children with 
more  media  exposure  were  more  likely  to  have  ADHD. 
Pooled effect sizes were significantly heterogeneous for 
the  continuous  overall  ADHD  outcomes  (Q(8) = 83.25, 

Prevention Science

p < 0.001) but not for the dichotomous overall ADHD out-
comes. There were also sufficient studies to examine the 
association of child media exposure and inattention using 
dichotomous (k = 3) and continuous effect sizes (k = 4), and 
each association was positive and statistically significant 
(OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 0.84, 2.50; and CC = 0.12; 95% CI: 
0.04, 0.20; respectively). For inattention, pooled estimates 
for continuous (Q(3) = 27.74, p < 0.001) but not dichotomous 
effect sizes showed significant heterogeneity.

Discussion

The results of the meta-analysis showed a pattern of sta-
tistically significant associations between multiple factors 
related to parenting and later ADHD symptoms and diag-
nosis. Poorer quality of interaction, maltreatment, divorce 
and single parenting, and higher child media exposure were 
statistically significantly associated with an increased like-
lihood of later ADHD symptoms and diagnosis, and thus 
emerged as potential risk factors. These findings suggest 
opportunities for potential prevention of ADHD symptoms 
through addressing parental risk factors. This study adds to 
the literature by suggesting that the focus of public health 
efforts that address outcomes such as maltreatment and posi-
tive parenting can be expanded to address these factors as 
prevention for clinical disorders such as ADHD. However, 
the results also point to gaps in knowledge, with limited 
numbers of high-quality studies available to examine the 
associations more thoroughly.

Overall, maltreatment was most strongly associated with 
ADHD diagnosis and symptoms; based on the odds ratios, 
children who experienced maltreatment were about 7 times 
as likely to have ADHD symptoms or diagnoses than the 
comparison groups. Based on Cohen’s method to estimate 
variance explained, general maltreatment explained about 
9% and physical abuse explained about 15% of the variance 
in continuous ADHD measures, thus indicating a sizeable 
association of each type of maltreatment on children’s like-
lihood of developing ADHD symptoms (Chen et al., 2010; 
Cohen, 1988). Children whose parents experienced separa-
tion or divorce were about 3 times as likely to have ADHD 
overall, including diagnosis or symptoms, based on the odds 
ratio, showing moderate pooled effects (Chen et al., 2010). 
Other factors showed smaller pooled effect sizes, indicating 
that these factors, while statistically significantly associated 
with the ADHD outcome, may have a smaller impact, or may 
impact a subset of children who are particularly vulnerable 
to the risks.

The review indicates that despite decades of research, 
there are still significant gaps, due to limited high-quality 
studies that contained the necessary data for inclusion in this 
meta-analysis. Most factors included in these analyses could 

1 3 
Prevention Science 

only be examined for overall ADHD outcomes; few factors 
had enough studies that met inclusion criteria to examine 
associations with inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity 
separately. For inattention, general maltreatment, higher 
child media exposure, and lower sensitivity/warmth during 
interactions emerged being statistically significantly asso-
ciated. For hyperactivity, only sensitivity/warmth could be 
evaluated and was inversely associated. The analyses of spe-
cific outcomes showed similar magnitude for pooled effects 
as for the overall ADHD analyses, thus not pointing to dif-
ferential associations of these factors on specific symptoms.
The data support associations between these parenting 
and family environment factors and child ADHD. There are 
multiple possible pathways by which they are related, such 
as directly through the parent–child relationship, indirectly 
through factors that parents may influence, or through com-
mon risk factors that affect both the child and the parent, 
including genetic factors. These possible pathways are likely 
to each play a role and thus present multiple opportunities 
for prevention and intervention (Faraone et al., 2021).

As established in previous research, parenting can have 
a strong influence on child development (NASEM, 2016b). 
The quality of the parent–child relationship and the cumu-
lative effect of parent–child interactions has a measurable 
influence not just on observable behavior but also on under-
lying cognitive and emotional processes, including those 
that underly ADHD (Pallini et al., 2019). Adverse parenting 
such as insensitivity, lack of responsiveness, or maltreatment 
can have a negative effect on brain development, whereas 
sensitivity and supportive parenting particularly in early 
childhood is significantly related to more optimal structural 
brain development (Belsky & de Haan, 2011; Kok et al., 
2015). Such impact on brain development in turn can influ-
ence the development of ADHD symptoms (Humphreys & 
Zeanah, 2015; Jimenez et al., 2017; Strathearn et al., 2020) 
and also of executive function skills, which play a major role 
in ADHD (Hughes & Devine, 2017; Pallini et al., 2019).

Parents  and  children  also  may  have  shared  risk  for 
ADHD,  adding  to  the  intergenerational  transmission  of 
ADHD, and thus pointing to the family needing support as 
a unit, rather than the child with a diagnosis alone. Herit-
ability of ADHD has been well documented, showing that 
genes can contribute to the probability of developing ADHD 
(Faraone & Larsson, 2019; Faraone & Mick, 2010; Freitag 
& Retz, 2010). Parents who share the genetic vulnerability 
and themselves have ADHD symptoms such as inattention 
or  impulsivity  may  make  different  reproductive  choices 
such as having children at a younger age or having more 
children (Ni et al., 2019), may have more difficulty provid-
ing resources for their children (Rowland et al., 2018), and 
may struggle more than other parents with creating a pre-
dictable and consistently supportive environment for their 
child (Storebø et al., 2013). Some parents with a history of 

ADHD symptoms may have experienced adversity in their 
own childhood, and may have lacked positive role models, 
which increases the risk of ADHD symptoms in their off-
spring (McDonald et al., 2019; Park et al., 2017; Radesky 
et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2018). Parents of children with 
ADHD may be at a higher risk of mental disorders, which 
further contributes to the likelihood of children develop-
ing ADHD (Robinson et al., this issue). Thus, the genetic 
vulnerability towards ADHD that parents may share with 
their child is also associated with the parenting factors that 
may contribute to the child’s symptoms of ADHD. Moreo-
ver, animal and emerging human research suggests parents’ 
own trauma history can result in epigenetic changes associ-
ated with stress reactivity and regulation which then can be 
transmitted to their offspring (Hays-Grudo & Morris, 2020) 
pointing to additional possible pathways of influence and of 
opportunities for intervention.

The present analysis included parenting factors that pre-
ceded the assessment of ADHD symptoms or the diagnosis 
of ADHD, but possible causal pathways by which parents 
contribute to ADHD symptoms are likely to be one part of a 
much larger, complex pattern of possible influences (Faraone 
et al., 2021). Early signs of ADHD may have already been 
present in the child before ADHD outcomes were measured. 
As parenting can influence child development, children can 
also influence parenting (Darling Rasmussen et al., 2019; 
Johnston et al., 2012). Children who are predisposed to 
develop ADHD may show early neuro-atypical character-
istics such as lacking attention to social cues, acting impul-
sively, and not attending to consequences of actions that may 
present challenges for parents (Deault, 2010; Johnston et al., 
2012) and affect the quality of the parent–child relation-
ship (Darling Rasmussen et al., 2019). ADHD may impact 
how children perceive and react differently to their parents’ 
behavior  and  thus  influence  parenting  styles  (Molina  & 
Musich, 2016), particularly given the increased likelihood 
of co-occurring behavior disorders (Deault, 2010).

Moreover, ADHD is associated with several child physical 
health risks (Bitsko et al., this issue; So et al., under review this 
issue). Combined with an elevated likelihood for environmental 
risks (Dimitrov et al., under review this issue) and parental risks 
such as poor mental health and substance abuse (Maher et al., 
this issue; Robinson et al., under review this issue), these risk 
factors may place additional demands on the subset of parents 
who experience risks themselves (Deault, 2010). Thus, by the 
time the child is diagnosed with ADHD (typically early school 
age), a range of parental and child factors related to ADHD 
may have jointly impacted the child’s developmental trajectory.
In addition, it is also likely that both the parenting factors  
and ADHD are affected by other factors and potentially func-
tioning as flags for underlying risks. For example, divorced  
and single parents can fully support their child’s healthy 
development, but among groups of children, those whose 

1 3parents are divorced may have higher odds of experienc-
ing family conflict, and single parenting has higher odds of 
economic disadvantage (Aizer, 2017; Bramlett & Mosher, 
2002). Similarly, parental incarceration is more prevalent in 
households with lower income and lack of resources (Geller 
et al., 2009). Adverse experiences may compound risk, such 
as socioeconomic risks coupled with increased difficulties 
with relationships and decreased ability to cope with adver-
sity, as well as increased chance of exposing the child to 
violence along with poor parenting and mental health issues, 
pointing to a cluster of disadvantages across the factors 
measured in this paper (Fredland et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 
2018; Schickedanz et al., 2018). Nationally, early indicators 
of self-regulation are associated with social determinants of  
health such as living in financially and socially disadvantaged 
families and communities, and experiencing family adversity 
(Claussen et al., 2021). Such lack of resources and support, in 
turn, may make life more challenging, increase the likelihood 
of depression and anxiety, and decrease the parents’ abil-
ity to help their child manage their behavior (Deault, 2010; 
Johnston et al., 2012; Robinson et al., this issue). Lack of 
resources may serve as a marker for communities that are 
unable to provide necessary supports, which may compound 
parenting challenges (Midouhas et al., 2014).

It may also be possible that parenting factors influence other  
conditions that are commonly co-occurring with ADHD and 
that the presence of these conditions can make ADHD symp-
toms worse. For example, there is stronger evidence for media 
exposure as a risk for obesity and depression than for ADHD 
symptoms (Stiglic & Viner, 2019). Given co-occurrence of 
obesity and depression with ADHD (Danielson et al., 2018; 
Li et al., 2020), it is unclear whether the association of media 
exposure and ADHD would remain if controlling for these co-
occurring outcomes, but presence of multiple conditions may  
warrant additional need for support.

Strengths and Limitations

The meta-analysis had multiple strengths. It specifically 
focused on studies where the exposure preceded the ADHD 
outcome. We also included ADHD symptoms, rather than 
relying only on existing diagnosis (see Table 1). Finally, the 
studies included large datasets as well as smaller samples, 
included males and females, and drew on data from multiple 
countries, broadening the scope of inquiry.

There were also several limitations. As discussed, causal 
pathways cannot be determined from any of the included 
studies in our meta-analysis. We observed significant hetero-
geneity for multiple potential risk factors examined, suggest-
ing variability in the magnitude or direction of estimates from 
individual studies. This finding may not be surprising, as the 
studies were from different countries, employed different 
study designs, and used different measurement approaches  

Prevention Science

for risk factors and ADHD outcomes. Therefore, factors had 
a common conceptual definition but were assessed in dif-
ferent ways. For example, media exposure included studies 
that examined exposure to TV (Cheng et al., 2010; Landhuis 
et al., 2007; Mistry et al., 2007) and TV and gaming (Poulain 
et al., 2018; Stevens & Mulsow, 2006; Swing et al., 2010),  
as well as exposure to violent TV content (Fitzpatrick et al., 
2012) or violent TV and gaming (Parkes et al., 2013). Given  
that content, pacing, and duration of media exposure may  
well have differential effects on symptoms (Beyens et al., 
2018), such variability may have contributed to heterogene-
ity. Bias in assessment may also affect heterogeneity; while 
qualitative constructs such as sensitivity and responsiveness 
apply across cultures (Claussen & Crittenden,  2000), the 
behaviors used to measure sensitivity or responsiveness may 
be impacted by racial, ethnic, and cultural bias (Guerrero  
et al., 2021). Furthermore, studies used different types of data 
sources, for example, maltreatment included case records 
and assessed reported maltreatment, but also utilized parent 
report (Becker-Blease & Freyd, 2008; Simmel et al., 2001), 
child self-report (Haj-Yahia & Abdo-Kaloti, 2008; King et al., 
2011; Sesar et al., 2008), or observation (Wolfe & Mosk, 
1983). The studies of maltreatment varied in whether they 
focused on physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, psycho-
logical maltreatment, or combinations thereof, even though 
these may have different effects on children’s development  
(Strathearn et al., 2020) thus impacting heterogeneity.

Variability in the measured ADHD outcomes may also impact 
the heterogeneity. Studies included parent, teachers, case record 
review, clinical diagnosis, and direct child observation. Generally, 
ADHD symptoms vary among children and present differently 
across context, different observers may witness dissimilar behav-
iors, and single assessments may not capture all facets. For case 
records, the validity of the original diagnosis often cannot easily 
be ascertained, and parents with poor parenting skills may not 
be reliable observers of behavior concerns (Bennett et al., 2006; 
Lau et al., 2006), thus adding a potential source of error or bias. 
Thus, while the overall analyses showed statistically significant 
associations that were generally consistent in direction (positive 
or negative), such heterogeneity limits the ability to interpret the 
accuracy of the magnitude of the pooled estimates. For multiple 
factors such as divorce, maltreatment, negativity/harsh punish-
ment, and media exposure, several of the presented pooled effect 
sizes need to be interpreted with caution.

Co-occurring disorders were not assessed systematically 
or in detail across studies. Thus, it is unclear whether symp-
toms of ADHD may have been caused by other conditions 
with similar symptoms, such as difficulties with attention 
and regulation due to learning disorders or sleep disorders  
(Wolraich et al., 2019). Trauma in specific may be likely to 
occur with maltreatment and unsupportive parenting, and 
careful clinical diagnosis beyond use of rating scales may 
be needed to differentiate symptoms of trauma from ADHD

2013). Moreover, factors such as parental mental disorders were 
also not consistently taken into considerations in these studies.
The diversity of studies drawing from samples from dif-
ferent countries and using different study design also rep-
resents a limitation. With samples ranging from population 
samples,  community  samples,  convenience  samples,  to 
clinic samples, it is not possible to adjust for selection bias 
and other confounding variables.

We were also not able to assess several parenting factors of 
interest due to fewer than three effect sizes from studies that met 
inclusion criteria. For example, physical neglect or sexual abuse 
may have a different impact on children than physical abuse, 
but insufficient data were present to examine those factors. The 
available literature also did not allow a thorough examination 
of ADHD diagnosis, hyperactivity, or impulsivity as separate 
from the overall outcome for many parenting factors of interest. 
Other factors relevant to parenting may have also been missed 
by the search strategy given that it was focused on a broad range 
of factors rather than focused on all possible relevant search 
terms related to parenting (Bitsko et al., this issue).

Gaps and Future Directions

In addition to the reported findings, this meta-analysis revealed 
gaps in the literature on parenting factors and ADHD. Between 
2014 and early 2021, only 7 studies had sufficient details to 
meet the criteria for inclusion in this paper. Important fac-
tors such as the interaction of child sex, socioeconomic, and 
parenting factors on ADHD outcomes could not be examined. 
Future studies can examine which factors predict hyperactive/
impulsive versus inattentive symptoms and the impact of dif-
ferent measures of ADHD (e.g., clinical, observational, parent 
or teacher report). More thorough research could contribute 
to understanding which among the possible causal pathways 
may play stronger roles, and for which subsets of parents and 
children these risk factors play a role.

Implications for Public Health and Prevention

The  parenting  factors  associated  with  ADHD  identi-
fied in this analysis point to potential targets for lower-
ing  the  odds  of  children  having  clinically  significant 
ADHD  symptoms  and  receiving  an  ADHD  diagnosis. 
Given heritability and multiple causal pathways of influ-
ence, interventions are unlikely to prevent overall occur-
rence of ADHD symptoms, but may lessen the severity 
and  impact  on  functioning,  thus  lessening  the  odds  of 
meeting diagnostic criteria. The focus of well-established 
public health efforts to improve healthy child develop-
ment,  such  as  preventing  maltreatment  CDC,  2016;  
Fortson et al., 2016), can be expanded to address clinically 
diagnosed disorders such as ADHD. Even when specific  

parenting factors contribute only modestly to individual risk, 
supporting parents may have a notable impact on population 
health given the considerable challenges that parents face 
(NASEM, 2016b). Strategies to support parents by enhanc-
ing their parenting skills and by promoting their own health 
and well-being can promote positive outcomes in children  
(NASEM, 2019a).

Expanding access to parenting intervention may improve 
outcomes. Significant evidence exists that behavioral parent-
ing interventions have a positive effect on ADHD symptoms 
(Epstein et al., 2015; Evans et al., 2018). In fact, for young 
children with ADHD, parent behavior training is the rec-
ommended first-line treatment because it has the best evi-
dence to benefit children and parents (Barbaresi et al., 2020; 
Rimestad et al., 2016; Wolraich et al., 2019). Many of the 
evidence-based parenting interventions for ADHD were also 
used to prevent maltreatment (Altafim & Linhares, 2016), 
demonstrated effectiveness for children who have ADHD 
and other conditions such as anxiety (Lebowitz et al., 2020), 
and can be used if a diagnosis of ADHD may not be easily 
ascertained (Barbaresi et al., 2020). By decreasing behavior 
problems in at-risk populations, parenting interventions can 
be used as prevention (van Aar et al., 2017). For parents who 
themselves struggle with ADHD symptoms while raising 
children at risk for ADHD, interventions may benefit from 
adaptation to individual families’ needs and to address fac-
tors in the home and community so parents can change their 
own behaviors and cognition to support their child’s devel-
opment more effectively (Johnston et al., 2012).

Interventions that are centered on the whole family may 
benefit parents and children with ADHD. Strategies that  
support  parenting,  promote  parental  mental  health,  and 
address stress may prevent or reduce the impact of child-
hood mental disorders including ADHD (NASEM, 2019a). 
For example, given the possible connection between fam-
ily conflict, divorce, and maltreatment, supporting families 
during the process of divorce with mediation and mental 
health support may positively impact children’s develop-
ment (D'Onofrio & Emery, 2019). However, many families 
face substantial barriers when trying to access treatment and 
support for children’s behavioral health; therefore, public 
health strategies may benefit from including efforts to iden-
tify barriers to access to behavioral health interventions and 
to reduce such barriers, including by addressing funding  
and payment challenges (Brundage & Shearer, 2019; So 
et al., 2019). From a public health perspective, supporting 
parents may also include public health education on spe-
cific parenting topics, for example, by working with health-
care providers to inform parents about appropriate limits 
on screen media (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016)  
or by directly providing parents with tools and resources 
to learn behavioral strategies to support their children and  
cope with parenting challenges (NASEM, 2021).

1 3For public health, supporting parents can include address-
ing the social determinants of risk and adversity (CDC, 2019), 
family  conflict  and  violence  (CDC, 2016;  Fortson  et  al., 
2016), and the root cause of structural inequalities of parental  
incarceration and trauma (Bailey et al., 2021). Support for  
parents may also be provided by directly reducing factors that 
negatively impact parenting such as lack of resources, health 
disparities, and systemic disadvantages (NASEM, 2016).  
Given that ADHD is associated with increased socioeconomic 
risk, which can be transmitted intergenerationally (Aizer, 
2017), interventions that support parents and decrease poverty- 
associated challenges (CDC Foundation, 2020; Hamad & 
Rehkopf, 2016) may also improve outcomes for children 
with ADHD, potentially decreasing the number of children 
who will be diagnosed with ADHD. For example, the Earned 
Income Tax Credits which may benefit children’s mental  
health overall (CDC Foundation, 2020) could potentially improve  
ADHD outcomes as well. Systemic approaches that address 
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child maltreat-
ment, separation, and parental incarceration, may prevent long-
term negative consequences for health and development that 
compound the impact of ADHD (CDC, 2019; Fortson et al., 
2016; Jimenez et al., 2017). In addition to broadening access 
to evidence-based parenting programs and high-quality early 
childhood programs, prevention of adverse childhood experi-
ences can include strengthening household financial security, 
supporting family friendly work policies, and enhancing norms 
that protect against violence (CDC, 2019). A broad approach 
to supporting parents may result in decreasing risk for ADHD 
symptoms and in strengthening factors that allow children with 
ADHD to live healthy and supported lives.
