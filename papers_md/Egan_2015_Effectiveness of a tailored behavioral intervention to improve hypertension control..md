The study by Dr. Friedberg and colleagues, “Effectiveness of a tailored behavioral 
intervention to improve hypertension control,” addresses a vital and well-recognized health 
issue.1 Specifically, the burden of uncontrolled hypertension is substantial, despite a near 
doubling in hypertension control from 27% in 1988–1994 to 53% 2009–2010.2 Yet in 2010, 
hypertension-related disease contributed to more than 10 million years of life lost from 
ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertensive heart disease, chronic kidney disease, other 
cardiovascular and circulatory diseases.3 Treatment and control of hypertension reduce fatal 
and non-fatal cardiovascular events, especially when combined with effective 
hypercholesterolemia management.4 In addition to the health toll, the economic burden of 
cardiovascular diseases in 2010 was approximately $445 billion with a projected increase to 
roughly $1.1 trillion in 2030.5 A disproportionate share of the increase is likely to occur 
among individuals ≥65 years.

Million Hearts estimated that 1,000,000 cardiovascular events could be prevented in the 
U.S. in a five-year period from 2013–2017, with hypertension control a featured component 
of the success plan.6 Effective, affordable and highly-scalable interventions that can 
significantly improve hypertension control are important.

In the study by Dr., Friedberg and co-authors,1 the effects of two-different monthly 
telephone-based interventions over six months were compared to usual care (UC). They 
found that a monthly 30-minute telephonic intervention delivered by well-trained 
psychologists, and which accounted for the patients stage of readiness to change (stage-
based intervention [SBI]), improved hypertension control compared to usual care (UC 
[(64.6% vs. 45.8%, p=0.001]). In contrast, a monthly telephonic health education 
intervention (HEI) using the same well-trained individuals, which was not adapted to the 
patient’s stage of readiness to change, did not significantly improve hypertension compared

to UC (54.3% vs. 45.8%, p=0.108). Both interventions aimed to increase physical activity, 
improve nutrition and enhance adherence. SBI improved nutrition alone, whereas HEI did 
not significantly improve any of the three measures.

The authors provide context for their findings in the Perspectives section: “healthcare is 
moving towards providing patient-centered care through the medical home model, with 
counseling regarding diet, physical activity and medication adherence being provided by 
phone by a non-physician.” Moreover, “Since this trial did not involve in-person contact, it 
has the potential to increase scalability and reduce costs.” Additionally, “The methods and 
findings from this study could be used to develop a toolkit that would allow a hospital or 
clinic to deliver the SBI by different disciplines.”

This commentary recognizes the important positive findings and attempts to provide 
contextual perspective regarding broader dissemination of SBI specifically and interventions 
to engage patients in self-care more broadly.

‘Intention-to-treat’ vs. ‘on-treatment analysis

In general, clinical studies are designed, powered and analyzed using the “intention-to-treat’ 
rather than ‘on-treatment’ principle. Table 1 provides the on treatment’ analysis and the 
originally planned ‘intention-to-treat analysis’7 with two different assumptions: All dropouts 
and lost to follow-up were (i) uncontrolled or (ii) had the same control as UC at 6 months. 
Not unexpectedly, hypertension control rates with the SBI (and HEI) decline relative to UC 
when dropouts are included.

Improve the SBI intervention and measurement tools

The original sample size estimate assumed 69% control at 6 months with an ITT design vs. 
the projected ITT control rate of 57%–62% using two different assumptions (Table 1). The 
discrepancy between projected and actual improvements in hypertension control suggests 
that there may be opportunities to optimize SBI to attain more of the anticipated benefit. 
Specifically, SBI improved nutritional congruence with a DASH-type eating plan but did not 
alter physical activity or medication adherence. Alternatively, the instruments used to assess 
physical activity and medication adherence may not be adequate for reliably detecting small 
but clinically important changes.

Additional data would be helpful in supporting broader dissemination of telephonic 
counseling-based interventions as summarized in Table 2. For example, the study was 
conducted on military veterans in Veterans Administration clinics. The overwhelming 
majority of patients were men with a mean age of approximately 66 years. On a positive 
note, the men were diverse from a race/ethnicity perspective with fewer than half white and 
more than half black and Hispanic. Moreover, patients in the age group studied are projected 
to contribute most to the increased cost for cardiovascular care by 2030.5

Hypertension control versus reduction in BP as the main focus

The benefit of an intervention an intervention to lower blood pressure on cardiovascular 
outcomes is likely related more to reduction in blood pressure than in achieving a somewhat 
arbitrary control goal, e.g., <140/<90.8 While the study was not powered to compared SBI 
and HEI, SBI lowered systolic BP a mean of 4.7 mmHg and HEI 5.4.1 Moreover, non-
significant group differences may have favored BP control in SBI over HEI. Prevalent 
diabetes was 40.3% (N=71) in SBI versus 46.7% (N=84, if total N=180) in the HEI and 
45.2% in UC (N=80, assuming total N=177). Thus, fewer individuals in SBI required a BP 
<130/<80 than in HEI and UC groups to attain control. Secondly, the standard deviation of 
systolic BP appeared larger in HEI than SBI (17.8 vs. 11.8 mmHg) and mean systolic BP 
was slightly higher (137.2 vs. 136.0). These data suggest that more individuals in HEI were 
further from goal than in SBI, which could also have contributed to a lesser control HEI, 
despite a slightly greater mean reduction of systolic BP.

Comparative effectiveness research

The reported study was not powered to compare SBI and HEI. Comparative effectiveness 
research is preferred in deciding which interventions to implement clinically. Moreover, in 
studies to address patient preferences, patient-centered care, and the patient-centered 
medical home, it is important to include patients and their healthcare team in the design, 
conduct, and interpretation of the research as well as the dissemination and implementation 
of findings.

Guidelines in effect when a study is designed and conducted versus when 

a study is analyzed and published

In this case, the BP goal for patients with diabetes was raised from <130/<80 mmHg at the 
time of study design and conduct to <140/<90 at the time of publication. Moreover, there is 
controversy over whether the current goal BP for adults ≥60 years without diabetes or 
chronic kidney disease should be <150/<90 mmHg vs. <140/<90. When designing future 
studies, it may be worthwhile to pre-specify a secondary analysis that conforms to criteria 
for patient inclusion and treatment goals upon the conclusion of the investigation. Pre-
specified analytical criterion should include adjustment for non-significant differences, 
which are likely to impact clinical implementation, e.g., group differences in age, race/
ethnicity, sex, and comorbid health conditions, even when those differences do not achieve 
statistical significance.

The authors suggest telephone counseling is more cost effective than clinic counseling 
without data. In a previous pilot study, 6 months of telephone (30 minutes each session) for 
10 patients cost $316 versus $410 for clinic counseling (40 minutes each session) for 10 
patients with both at an interval of every 3 weeks ($9/hour for a social worker).9 Clinic 
counseling increased diastolic BP control from one to five of ten patients, whereas the

telephone counseling increased control from five to eight in ten patients. The cost per patient 
controlled was $102 for office-based and $105 for telephone-based counseling.

Future improvement in hypertension control

Dr. Friedberg and colleagues note that much of the improvement in hypertension control 
likely reflects changes in healthcare delivery rather than patient engagement. In fact, 
hypertensive patients have become more obese and their diets have either not improved or 
improved minimally over time. Better hypertension control appears to largely reflect greater 
patient awareness of hypertension and a greater proportion on antihypertensive 
pharmacotherapy. Among patients on treatment, a progressively higher proportion is 
receiving three or more different antihypertensive medication classes.10 As a healthcare 
system, we may be moving toward the limits of what can be achieved pharmacologically 
without engaging patients more actively in their own healthcare.1 A behavioral intervention 
matched to the patient’s stage of readiness to change is intellectually appealing and appears 
to significantly lower blood pressure and improve hypertension control. Further studies to 
provide additional information as indicated in Table 2 could lead to clinically effective and 
patient-centered approaches that move us toward the Health People 2020 goal of controlling 
88% of treated hypertensive patients and 61.2% of all adults with hypertension in the U.S.
