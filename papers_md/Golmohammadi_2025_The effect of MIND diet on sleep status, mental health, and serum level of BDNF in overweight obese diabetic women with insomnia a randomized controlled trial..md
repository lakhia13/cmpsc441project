Insomnia is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and affects mental health and quality of life. 
The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for 
Neurodegenerative Delay) diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, 
anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetic 
women with insomnia. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 44 type 2 diabetic women with 
insomnia, aged 30 to 65 years, who were randomly assigned to be under the MIND low-calorie diet 
(n = 22) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) as the control group (n = 22) for 12 weeks. The above-mentioned 
variables were assessed at the beginning and the end of intervention. Following the MIND diet for 12 
weeks accompanied by the significant decrease of waist circumference and significant improvement 
of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group. In addition, the MIND diet vs. 
LCD group exhibited a significant reduction in the cortisol levels and a significant increase in BDNF. This 
study provides promising evidence of the effectiveness of the MIND diet in improving the sleep quality, 
mental health, and some related biochemical parameters in diabetic women with insomnia.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a most common endocrine disorder and a global public health problem in 
the 21st century1. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that 783 million people will suffer from 
diabetes by 20452. T2DM is associated with different physical and psychological complications3. Sleep disorders 
like  insomnia,  obstructive  sleep  apnea  and  restless  legs  syndrome4,  depression  and  anxiety  are  common 
psychological disorders in T2DM3 caused by some direct adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS) or 
other mechanisms like increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses5–8.

Insomnia is usually characterized by inability to fall or stay asleep, or waking up earlier than planned despite 
having the sufficient time to rest9. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly higher in T2DM. The reported rate 
is 39%, four times higher than in the general population10. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system 
due to dysautonomia can lead to the occurrence of microarousals in these patients, which can ultimately impair 
the  quality  of  sleep11–13.  Diabetics  are  often  under  increased  psychological  pressure  to  manage  their  disease, 
which  can  lead  to  depression,  a  major  contributor  poor  sleep3,14.  On  the  other  hand,  insomnia  can  increase 
the risk of depression through some mechanisms. Insomnia is often associated with increased activity of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis  and  increased  levels  of  cortisol  and  inflammatory  cytokines15–18.

Cortisol  and  the  HPA  axis  are  negatively  related  to  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF),  the  main 
neurotrophin of the CNS, which may play a major role in depression19.

Benzodiazepines are typically considered as the most popular option for the treatment of insomnia, depression, 
and anxiety20. Benzodiazepines increase the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the CNS21. However, 
long-term use of these drugs is associated with different side effects, including addictive potential22, dementia21, 
balance disorders23 and cognitive decline24. Therefore, it appears necessary to use alternative methods25–27 that 
not only protect the CNS but also effectively treat the insomnia.

Numerous studies have examined the effects of dietary interventions on improving the sleep quality. In a 
recent study, it was found that adherence to the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet resulted 
in a significant reduction in sleep quality, depression and stress scores after a 12-week period28. In addition, 
previous  studies  revealed  a  negative  association  between  adherence  to  the  Mediterranean  diet  and  insomnia 
symptoms29,30.

Healthy dietary patterns like Mediterranean and DASH diets, are associated with numerous health benefits, 
such  as  reducing  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease,  obesity,  T2DM,  and  certain  cancers31,32.  The  MIND 
(Mediterranean-DASH  Intervention  for  Neurodegenerative  Delay)  dietary  pattern  recently  introduced  by 
Morris et al. is a combination of the DASH and Mediterranean dietary patterns33. This dietary approach was 
initially investigated for its association with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive function33,34. The MIND dietary 
pattern is characterized by specific features, with an emphasis on the consumption of berries and green leafy 
vegetables rich in polyphenolic compounds33,35,36. Phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids and 
tannins play a critical role in the promoting cognition and brain health37. Results of a meta-analysis showed the 
effectiveness of polyphenols in enhancing neurotrophic factors37. Phenolic compounds have anti-inflammatory 
effects and protect against the oxidative stress38. On the other hand, polyphenols have a positive effect on BDNF 
and cortisol levels through different mechanisms39,40. MIND dietary pattern also includes food items for brain 
health such as: vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, seafood, chicken, olive oil as the main cooking oil and 
moderate wine. Moreover, the MIND diet restrict the consumption of foods that are unhealthy for the brain, 
such as meat, butter and margarine, cheese, sweets and fried foods, and fast food33. Modern artificial intelligence 
(AI)  tools,  such  as  ChatGPT,  can  serve  as  valuable  resources  to  obtain  information  about  diets  such  as  the 
MIND diet. However, users must engage with these tools thoughtfully and critically to ensure they are making 
informed decisions based on accurate data. This approach helps to mitigate the risks associated with dietary 
misinformation and achieve better health outcomes41. There is evidence that greater adherence to the MIND diet 
decreased odds of experiencing poor sleep quality and related sleep outcomes42. In addition, previous studies 
have shown reverse associations between the MIND diet and depression, stress and anxiety43–46. Albeit, some 
studies have failed to demonstrate this association42,47. It should be mentioned that, most of the studies in this 
area are observational, and to the best of our knowledge, no clinical trial has yet been conducted to investigate 
the impact of the MIND diet on sleep patterns, depression and anxiety.

Given the high prevalence of insomnia in T2DM and its association with mental health, the present study 
aimed to investigate the effects of MIND diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, 
anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and BDNF in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia.

Materials and methods
Participants and sample size
This open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT)  involved 44  patients with type 2 diabetes and insomnia 
in Sanandaj, Iran. Participants were recruited voluntarily through a city-wide announcement. The sample size 
for each group was calculated to be 18, based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of sleep quality from 
Daneshzad et al.’study28, aiming for a 5% probability of type 1 error (α = 0.05) and 95% study power.   To account 
for a potential  20%  dropoout rate, the sample size was increased to 22 per group.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligible type 2 diabetic women aged 30–65 years with an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) of more than 7 and a Body 
Mass Index (BMI) of 25 to 35 kg/m2 were voluntarily participated in the study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy 
and breastfeeding, smoking and alcohol consumption, insulin use, sleep apnea, shift work, use of weight loss 
diets and medication in the last three months, clinically diagnosed endocrine, metabolic, renal, neurological or 
psychiatric disorders and use of sedatives, analgesics and hypnotics. An initial screening regarding the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria was conducted by telephone.

Procedure
Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  the  MIND  low-calorie  diet  (MLCD)  or  a  low-calorie  diet 
(LCD) using a random sequence generated by the random block method, which creates 11 blocks through the 
website https://www.sealedenvelope.com. The study period was 12 weeks with a clause follow-up.

Due to the nature of the intervention, this study was conducted in an open-label form. Subjects were assigned 
to study groups by a person not directly connected to the participants. The two groups had no contact after the 
fixed schedule. To minimize bias, the data collector was unaware of the assignment of participants to the study 
groups.

Diets
 The energy requirement for each participant was calculated based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 
equations48.  From  the  calculated  amount,  250–500  kilocalories  were  then  subtracted  to  lose  0.25–0.5  kg  per 
week49. In both groups, the diet was designed so that carbohydrates made up 55–55%, proteins 15–20% and fats 
30% of the total calories, which were distributed over six meals and snacks. In the control group, only calorie

restriction and the consumption of healthy foods were prescribed, and the diet did not follow a specific dietary 
pattern. The  diet  designed  for  the  intervention  group  was  based  on  the  MIND  dietary  pattern  developed  by 
Morris et al. (Supplemental Table 1)34 with some modification due to the religious beliefs as the consumption 
of wine was removed from this dietary pattern. For participants in the MIND diet group, meals and snacks of 
each day were designed weekly according to the diet’s guidelines. If the person was unable to prepare every menu 
provided in the diet, the meal was changed according to the dietitian’s opinion. In both groups, calorie intake was 
restricted so that both groups could benefit from weight loss in accordance with ethical principles. To encourage 
adherence to the diet, participants’ diets were assessed weekly by telephone along with a monthly face-to-face 
meeting. The approximate time of consultation with a dietitian was 90 min for each person in each session, and 
thereafter the participants communicated with the dietitian whenever they needed an advice. All subjects were 
instructed to maintain their current level of physical activity throughout the study.

The MIND diet score
 The  subjects  were  instructed  to  precisely  record  their  food  intake  for  three  days  (two  days  during  the  week 
and one day on the weekend) at baseline and 12th weeks. Dietary data were then analyzed using Nutritionist 
IV software modified for Iranian foods (First Databank, San Bruno, CA, USA, version 3.5.2.). The values are 
considered on the basis of servings per 1000 kcal, and the MIND diet score was calculated from 14 points, as 
wine consumption was not taken into account33. The MIND diet score was also considered to determine the level 
of dietary adherence. The scores above 80% indicated adherence to the diet.

Primary endpoint
Assessment of sleep quality
    Sleep  quality  was  assessed  using  the  19-question  Pittsburg  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI),  which  examines  7 
different aspects of sleep. The validity and reliability of PSQI were established in the Persian version by Farrahi 
et al.50. This index included sleep quality, time to fall asleep, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, 
sleep medication use, and daytime dysfunction. The scores ranged from 0 to 21, and the higher scores indicating 
a poorer sleep quality. This index was examined at the beginning and end of the study.

Secondary endpoint
Anthropometric measurements, the assessment of mental health, and serum levels of BDNF and cortisol
The participants’ weight, height, waist and hip circumference were measured at the beginning and end of the 
study  using  the  calibrated  equipment.  The  BMI  was  determined  by  dividing  the  weight  in  kilograms  by  the 
square of height in meters. The waist circumference was measured in a standing position at the narrowest point 
between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, whereas the hip circumference was measured as the greatest gluteal 
circumference. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were also calculated51.

Depression,  anxiety  and  stress  were  assessed  using  the  Depression  Anxiety  Stress  Scale-21  (DASS-21) 
questionnaire at the beginning and end of the study. The validity and reliability of questionnaire were confirmed 
by Sahebi et al.52. Each of the subscales comprised 7 questions, and each question was scored from 0 to 3. High 
scores on each subscale indicated higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.

After  10–12  h  of  fasting,  8  cc  of  blood  samples  was  taken  from  all  subjects  at  the  beginning  and  end  of 
intervention to measure serum levels of BDNF (ZellBio-Kit; Germany) and cortisol (Roche-Kit; Germany) using 
the ELISA and ECLIA method, respectively. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant named 
guidelines and regulations.

Statistical analysis
The data was analyzed using SPSS software version 21 and STATA software version 1. Results were expressed 
as mean ± SD or frequency (percentage). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first used to check the normality 
of the variables. Possible differences at baseline among treatment groups were assessed by independent sample 
t test for normally distributed parameters and the Mann–Whitney test for nonparametric data. At the end of 
intervention, the linear regression model was used to determine the relationship between the independent and 
dependent variables and to adjust for confounding variables. Moreover, to assess within-group differences of 
biochemical parameters, paired-sample t test and the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test were employed. 
The qualitative data was assessed by the chi-square test. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.

Ethics approval
This  randomized  clinical  trial  was  approved  by  the  Research  Ethics  Board  of  Kermanshah  University  of 
Medical  Sciences  (IR.KUMS.REC.1402.170)  and  was  approved  by  the  Iranian  Registry  of  Clinical  Trials 
(IRCT20181111041611N8) on 07/08/2023. In addition, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Law, all 
subjects read and signed a written informed consent form before participating in the study.

Results
Participant characteristics
 This  study  was  conducted  in  October  2023  and  lasted  6  months.  All  44  participants  who  met  the  inclusion 
criteria completed the study, as shown in Fig. 1. Participants in the study reported no adverse effects from the 
intervention. The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. At the beginning of study, 
there was no significant difference between groups in the aforementioned parameters (p > 0.05).

Changes in food intake
Table 2 shows the changes of calorie intake and other nutrients. As expected, the amount of calories consumed 
decreased  in  both  groups  and  the  protein  intake  increased  (p < 0.001).  In  addition,  the  amount  of  saturated 
fatty acids intake decreased (p = 0.012) and the amount of fiber intake increased (p = 0.007) significantly in the 
MIND group compared to the control group. These results were maintained statistically significant even after 
adjustment for the baseline values (p < 0.001).

According  to  Table  3,  as  expected,  the  intake  of  green  leafy  vegetables,  berries,  nuts,  olive  oil,  fish,  beans 
and whole grains increased significantly and the intake of cheese decreased significantly in the MIND group 
compared to the control group after adjusting for baseline values (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference 
in  changes  of  other  vegetables,  poultry,  red  meat,  butter,  fast  fried  foods  and  sweets  intake  between  groups 
(p > 0.05). At the end of intervention as expected, the MIND diet group had an average score significantly higher 
than control group as 12.82 ± 0.59 vs. 8.39 ± 1.24.

Changes in sleep quality
  As  it  was  shown  in  Table  4,  the  sleep  quality  score  improved  significantly  in  both  groups  after  12  weeks 
(p < 0.001).  Although,  the  improvements  in  MIND  diet  group  were  statistically  significant  compared  to  the 
control group (β =-2.25; p = 0.006). Our results showed that the improvement in sleep latency (p = 0.011), sleep 
duration (p = 0.022) and sleep disturbance (p < 0.001) scores was significant in the MIND group vs. control group 
after adjusting for baseline variables.

Changes in mental health
The  mean ± SD  of  the  DASS  scores  are  shown  in  Table  5.  Significant  improvements  in  total  DASS  score  and 
depression and anxiety subscales’ score were observed in both groups (p < 0.05), while stress scores decreased 
significantly only in the MIND diet group (p = 0.001). Changes of depression (p = 0.03) and anxiety (p = 0.008) 
scores were also significant in MIND group vs. control group after adjusting the baseline variables. However,

after adjusting for other variables including baseline values, age, education, physical activity, weight changes and 
calorie intake these results remained significant only for depression (β =-2.64; p = 0.033).

Changes in anthropometric measurements
As shown in Table 6, although, weight and BMI decreased significantly in both groups after 12 weeks of the 
intervention,  there  was  not  a  significant  difference  between  groups  (p > 0.05).  However,  waist  circumference 
(β =-1.73; p = 0.004), WHR (β =-0.02; p = 0.015) and WHtR (β =-0.11; p = 0.005) decreased significantly in the 
MIND diet group compared to the control group after adjusting for the baseline values, calorie intake, physical 
activity and body weight.

Changes in biochemical indices
The mean ± SD of serum levels of BDNF and cortisol are shown in Table 7. In the MIND group, the increase 
in  BDNF  (p = 0.004)  and  the  decrease  in  cortisol  (p = 0.022)  were  significant  after  12  weeks  of  intervention 
compared to the control group. After adjusting for the baseline values, age, physical activity, weight loss, calorie 
intake, and duration of diabetes, these results also remained significant: β for BDNF = 0.37 (p = 0.004) and β for 
cortisol=-81.58 (p = 0.009).

Discussion
This randomized clinical trial was the first to examine the effects of 12 weeks of adherence to the MIND diet 
on sleep quality, mental health, and some biochemical and anthropometric indices in type 2 diabetic women 
with insomnia. Our results showed that following the MIND diet significantly improved the sleep quality and 
depression as compared to the control group. Moreover, a significant decrease of waist circumference and serum 
levels of cortisol, and increase of BDNF levels were also revealed vs. control group.

At  the  beginning  of  the  study,  the  demographic  and  anthropometric  characteristics  of  the  participants 
showed  no  significant  differences. There  were  also  no  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in  terms  of 
initial  calorie  intake,  macronutrient  distribution  and  fiber  consumption. The  study  design  ensured  that  both 
groups received a low-calorie diet, and the subsequent analyses showed that there were no statistically significant 
differences between groups in calorie intake or the percentage of protein, fat and carbohydrate intake after the 
intervention. However, the MIND diet group exhibited a significant reduction in the percentage of saturated fat 
and a significant increase in fiber intake.

As  it  was  expected,  the  MIND  diet  group  showed  significant  modifications  in  their  dietary  habits  as  the 
increased intake of green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, olive oil, whole grains, fish, beans and poultry as well as 
decreased intake of butter, cheese and red meat. These alterations were reflected a significant improvement in 
MIND dietary scores in the MIND diet group compared to the control group.

Calorie restriction was implemented in both groups, which led to a significant improvement in anthropometric 
measurements. Especially, the MIND diet group exhibited a more significant reduction in waist circumference, 
WHR and WHtR compared to the control group. Previous research has demonstrated an association between 
adherence  to  the  MIND  diet  and  a  reduction  in  the  odds  of  general  obesity53,54.  Specifically,  Arjmand  et  al. 
investigated  the  effects  of  MIND  diet  on  weight  loss,  BMI,  waist  circumference  and  body  fat  percentage  in 
overweight  /obese  women  and  observed  significant  improvements  in  these  outcomes55.  However,  not  all 
studies have consistently shown this relationship56. The disparity in results of studies may be due to different 
study designs, characteristics  of subjects including  age,  health status, and the sample size. The MIND diet is 
characterized by the high content of polyphenols, which have been contributed to weight management through 
several  mechanisms  like  the  inhibition  of  digestive  enzymes,  regulation  of  lipid  metabolism,  modulation 
of  gut  microbiota,  inhibition  of  adipocyte  differentiation,  suppression  of  appetite  and  stimulation  of  energy 
expenditure57.

Our  participants  were  type  2  diabetics  women  suffered  from  the  insomnia  and  impaired  sleep  quality. 
Following the MIND diet significantly improved sleep quality scores especially the sleep latency, sleep duration 
and sleep disturbance. These results suggest that the MIND diet may be a valuable adjunct therapy for improving 
sleep  quality  in  diabetic  patients  with  insomnia.  This  finding  is  supported  by  previous  studies  that  have

demonstrated a positive association between the MIND diet and the Mediterranean diet with improved sleep 
quality42,58. In addition, the results of studies included in the systematic review indicated a negative association 
between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores and sleep outcomes59.

It seems that some components of MIND diet contribute to the improvement of sleep quality. In particular, 
the  high  proportion  of  green  leafy  vegetables  in  the  MIND  diet  plays  a  crucial  role  in  this  regard.  Green 
leafy  vegetables  are  rich  source  of  magnesium,  an  essential  mineral  involved  in  the  nerve  function  and  the 
regulation of sleep quality60,61. Magnesium acts as a cofactor for the enzyme N-acetyltransferase in the melatonin 
synthesis pathway, which is critical for the regulation of sleep-wake rhythm62. Moreover, magnesium acts as an 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist and GABA agonist and modulates sleep behavior through its effect 
on  neurotransmitter  activity63,64.  Another  important  component  of  the  MIND  diet  are  berries.  Berries  are  a 
rich source of melatonin and flavonoids, which have been shown to play an important role in sleep regulation. 
Flavonoids have been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in neurons, protect the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) from inflammatory cells, and improve endothelial function and blood pressure control65–69. The 
cumulative effects of these compounds may contribute to the observed improvement in sleep quality.

The presence of anxiety and depression in these patients may also be attributed to the concomitant sleep 
disturbances3,70. In the present study, the MIND diet intervention resulted in a statistically significant reduction 
in  the  level  of  anxiety  and  depression.  In  consistent  with  this  finding,  a  previous  study  by  Daneshzad  et  al. 
showed that following the DASH diet for 3 months in diabetic patients caused a significant reduction in anxiety 
and depression28. Another study by Bayes et al. showed the positive effects of the Mediterranean diet on reducing 
depression71.  In  another  study,  a  significant  association  was  found  between  adherence  to  the  MIND  dietary 
pattern and improved quality of life and a reduction in depression symptoms in adolescent girls72. The observed 
effects  of  MIND  diet  on  mental  health  may  be  mediated  by  its  influence  on  several  physiological  pathways, 
including inflammation, oxidative stress, HPA axis activity, gut microbiota, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, 
and BDNF levels73.

In fact, adherence to a healthy diet such as the MIND diet can regulate cortisol secretion by modulating HPA 
axis function, modulating the gut-brain axis, and reducing oxidative stress, which can directly enhance BDNF 
secretion73. Consistent with this hypothesis, our study found that a 12-week intervention with the MIND diet 
in  diabetic  patients  with  insomnia  resulted  in  a  significant  reduction  of  the  cortisol  levels.  Furthermore,  we 
observed a significant increase in BDNF levels, an important neurotrophic factor involved in neuronal survival 
and  differentiation.  Our  findings  are  also  consistent  with  those  of  Sánchez-Villegas  et  al.  which  reported  a 
statistically significant increase in BDNF levels in patients with depression under the Mediterranean diet plus 
nuts (Med + Nuts) group compared to the control group74. In addition, in a previous study by Arjmand et al. a 
3-month intervention with the MIND diet resulted in an increase in BDNF levels, although this increase was not 
significant75. This may be attributed to differences in adherence levels to the dietary pattern among participants, 
as well as specific characteristics of the individuals involved in the study.

Fig. 2 represents some default mechanisms of MIND diet for improving sleep quality and mental health.
Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first RCT to examine the effects of the MIND diet on 
sleep quality, mental health and some anthropometric and biochemical indices in type 2 diabetic patients with 
insomnia. However, the notable limitations of the present study were the relatively small sample size, and short 
duration of study as well as being the sex specific (women), which may affect the generalizability of the results. 
The fourth limitation of this study is that subjective measures were used to assess sleep quality rather than using 
objective tools such as polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy, which are considered the gold standard for sleep 
assessment. Finally, the self-reported dietary intake assessment may be also prone to bias.

Conclusion
In  conclusion,  adherence  to  the  MIND  diet  resulted  in  significant  improvement  in  sleep  quality  and  mental 
health in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia. Moreover, the MIND diet group exhibited a significant increase

WHR and WHR after a 12-week intervention compared to the control group. These results suggest a promising 
therapeutic potential of the MIND diet in T2DM. However, future well-designed studies with larger sample sizes 
and objective measurement tools such as PSG and actigraphy are needed to fully clarify the effects of the MIND 
diet on these variables. Furthermore, the assessment of serum levels of melatonin, serotonin, tryptophan and 
kynurenine is recommended to better understand the underlying mechanisms of action.
