Abstract

Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death globally in youths and suicidal behavior and 
self-harm are major clinical concerns. This article updates the previous practitioner review (2012) 
with the aims of integrating new research evidence, including that reported in this Special Issue.

Methods: The article reviews scientific evidence related to steps in the care pathway for 
identifying and treating youths with elevated suicide/self-harm risk, specifically: 1) screening and 
risk assessment; 2) treatment; and 3) community level suicide prevention strategies.

Results: Review of current evidence indicates that major advances have been achieved in 
knowledge regarding clinical and preventive practices for reducing suicide and self-harm risk in 
adolescents. The evidence supports the value of brief screeners for identifying youths with 
elevated suicide/self-harm risk and the efficacy of some treatments for suicidal and self-harm 
behavior. Dialectical behavior therapy currently meets Level 1 criteria (2 independent trials 
supporting efficacy) as the first well-established treatment for self-harm, and other approaches 
have shown efficacy in single randomized controlled trials. The effectiveness of some community-
based suicide prevention strategies for reducing suicide mortality and suicide attempt rates has 
been demonstrated.

Conclusions: Current evidence can guide practitioners in delivering effective care for youth 
suicide/self-harm risk. Treatments and preventive interventions that address the psychosocial 
environment and enhance the ability of trusted adults to protect and support youths, while also 
addressing the psychological needs of youths appear to yield the greatest benefits. Although 
additional research is needed, our current challenge is to do our best to effectively utilize new 
knowledge to improve care and outcomes in our communities.

Introduction

Page 2

Suicide is among the leading causes of death for adolescents and remains a major public 
health concern. In some nations, such as the United States, suicide is the second leading 
cause of death among adolescents and young adults; and suicide rates have been increasing, 
whereas other major causes of death such as motor vehicle accidents have declined (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Even more prevalent in the young is non-fatal 
self-harm; a strong predictor of later death by suicide and future self-harm. In 2012, when 
the last Practitioner Review on Self-harm in Adolescents was completed (Ougrin, Tranah, 
Leigh, Taylor, & Asarnow, 2012), there existed no empirically validated interventions or 
treatments to reduce suicidal and self-harming behaviors in adolescents and the review 
concluded by underscoring the need for research to develop therapeutic interventions for 
treating self-harm in adolescents. This situation has, fortunately, changed in recent years 
after several clinical approaches demonstrated their effectiveness (for review, Glenn, 
Esposito, Porter, & Robinson, 2019). Still, we are just beginning to establish a robust 
evidence base for clinical and preventive practice in the field of youth suicidal behavior and 
self-harm. The collection of papers in this issue provides important additions to this 
evidence base. Here, we aim to update the previous practitioner review, with an emphasis on 
integrating new research reported in this issue and the broader field.

Before proceeding to the update, it is important to note some cross-national differences. The 
approach in Europe and most other parts of the world (although there are exceptions) is 
generally to consider self-harm as a broad category, inclusive of suicide attempts (SAs), 
nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI), and self-harm with ambiguous intent. This 
approach is due partly to difficulties in determining intent, the tendencies for youths to shift 
self-harm methods, and the increased risk of later SAs and deaths among youths engaging in 
self-harm regardless of intent (Hawton et al., 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2016). Alternatively, in 
North America, the emphasis is frequently on distinguishing between self-harm with and 
without suicidal intent. This has led to much of the work from the United States (U.S.), 
focusing on youths who make SAs or including youths with SAs, suicidal ideation (SI), 
and/or suicidal events (generally defined as severe SI leading to emergency intervention) 
within a broad category of “suicidal youths (e.g. Asarnow et al., 2011, Esposito-Smythers 
2011; King et al., 2019a). Others have examined broadly defined self-harming youths (e.g. 
Mehlum et al., 2014; Ougrin, Boege, Stahl, Banarsee, & Taylor, 2013; Rossouw & Fonagy, 
2012), and others have evaluated NSSI (e.g. Miller et al., 2019). However, due to the relative 
rarity of SAs compared to NSSI, a broad self-harm category will include substantially more 
NSSI incidents relative to SAs. While there are exceptions, these cross-national differences 
create challenges for combining results across studies and offering clinical guidance that fits 
the needs of practitioners in different countries and practice settings. In this article, the term 
self-harm refers to SAs, NSSI, and ambiguous self-harm as a group. SA refers to self-harm 
with some suicidal intent, NSSI to self-harm without suicidal intent, and SA/self-harm is 
used when evidence holds for both overall self-harm and SAs.

Accumulating data indicate that youths with self-harm histories are at increased risk of 
suicide deaths and increased risk of death by other unnatural causes, such as overdoses 
(Hawton et al., 2012; Morgan et al., 2009). These results in conjunction with evidence

reported in this issue that health risk behaviors such as substance abuse are associated with 
increased risk of SAs (Barzilay et al., 2019; King et al., 2019b) underscore the importance of 
clinical evaluation and monitoring of substance use in youths with suicide/self-harm risk.

This review proceeds through the care pathway for identifying and treating youths with 
elevated suicide/self-harm risk. In the sections below, we review the following steps in the 
care pathway: 1) screening and risk assessment; 2) treatment; and 3) community level 
suicide prevention strategies.

Step 1: Screening and risk assessment

Screening and risk assessment builds on accumulating knowledge regarding risk and 
protective factors. We have learned that youths at risk for SAs and later suicide are a 
heterogeneous group and there are multiple pathways by which a youth engages in 
potentially lethal self-harm or chooses to end his/her life. This has led to a broad group of 
identified risk and protective factors across studies, and when examined with diverse 
populations these risk factors contribute small amounts of variance (Franklin et al., 2017). 
Contrary to the argument that this indicates that the field has made little progress, the 
impressive results from the Emergency Department Screening for Teens at Risk for Suicide 
Study (ED-STARS) presented in this issue (King et al., 2019b) support cross-study 
consistency of observed effects, and begin to move us towards more effective screening 
strategies.

ED-STARS examines predictors of suicide attempts in the 3 months following an ED visit in 
over 6000 ED patients, ages 12–17, drawn from 14 ED sites across the U.S. Examining risk 
and protective factors drawn from prior research, study results indicated significant bivariate 
effects for all examined risk and protective factors. Further, multivariate analyses 
underscored the significance of recent SI, lifetime suicidal behavior, and low levels of school 
connectedness as risk factors within the full sample. These findings demonstrate that, given 
sufficiently powered studies, for the most part results can be replicated across studies using 
similar populations.

Consistent with the heterogeneity among youths at elevated SA/suicide risk, ED-STARS 
results also indicate variation in the most parsimonious set of predictors for males and 
females, and for youths initially presenting with and without SI. For males and females the 
final multivariate model included past-week SI and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. For 
females (but not males) past-year NSSI incidents and social connectedness were significant 
predictors. These data are consistent with accumulating results underscoring the strength of 
NSSI as a predictor of SAs in primarily female samples (for review, Ougrin et al., 2012), and 
the value of treatment approaches that target youths with overall self-harm regardless of sub-
type (SA, NSSI) particularly when accompanied by SI (Bjureberg et al., 2018). Future work 
on ED-STARs will test innovative screening approaches including a brief computerized 
adaptive screen that considers multiple risk factors, and “laboratory-based” behavioral 
measures of suicidality.

History of maltreatment and exposure to traumatic stress (e.g., abuse, peer victimization) 
have been shown to be associated with increased risk of SAs in two studies in this issue

(King et al., 2019b; Zelazny et al., 2019) and with self-harm in Russell (2019). Consistent 
with prior work, these findings underscore the importance of a trauma-informed approach to 
suicide/self-harm screening and care which assesses for and considers current and past 
exposure to traumatic stress.

The value of looking at within-individual variability to identify periods of risk is highlighted 
in the report by Miller and colleagues (2019). Results indicated that adolescents were at 
highest risk for NSSI during times when they experienced higher stress levels, relative to 
their average stress levels. This suggests the value of monitoring high-risk youths and 
intervening during times of risk. Such targeted timing of intervention using ecological 
momentary assessments and interventions could enhance treatment benefits during both 
acute treatment and longer-term monitoring/follow-up.

Since the prior review, there have been major advances in suicide risk screening and 
stratification protocols. Extensive data support the value and feasibility of brief screeners for 
suicide-risk in ED and other settings, with perhaps the most extensive data available for the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2011) which can be 
administered with adolescents and adults, and the Ask About Suicide Questionnaire (ASQ; 
Horowitz et al., 2012) which has been used with child to young adult patients (ages 8–21 
years).

With increasing emphasis on screening for suicide-risk many U.S. health systems have 
developed care pathways that include screening using evidence based screeners, follow-up 
assessments for positive screens, guidelines for risk stratification, and recommended actions 
for individuals at different risk levels. This has been incorporated within broader “Zero 
Suicide” quality improvement initiatives which aim to move towards the aspirational goal of 
eliminating suicides through quality improvement initiatives (https://zerosuicide.sprc.org/).

Another approach for increasing our ability to identify and effectively care for youths at risk 
for suicide/self-harm involves systematic mining of electronic health records and use of 
machine learning algorithms to identify at-risk youths. A recent JCPP article by Walsh and 
coworkers (2018) illustrates how computational algorithms may predict suicide risk using 
longitudinal routinely collected data. Such machine learning approaches may offer scalable 
methods for broad screening within health systems and help us to get life-saving care to 
youths with need.

Step 2: Treatment

The reports in this issue highlight the progress made in knowledge regarding effective 
treatment for youths presenting with self-harm. We now have two independent randomized 
controlled trials demonstrating that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an effective 
treatment for reducing self-harm, compared to two different active comparators (usual care 
(UC) in Norway, Mehlum et al., 2019; Individual and Group Supportive Therapy (IGST) 
matched to DBT for treatment dose offered in the U.S. trial (McCauley et al., 2018).1 The

U.S. trial was larger and demonstrated a significant benefit of DBT for reducing SAs at 6-
months, as well any self-harm at post-treatment (6-months) and 12-month follow-up 
(McCauley et al., 2018). These collective results support DBT as the first well-established 
treatment for self-harm based on the criteria of two independent trials supporting efficacy.

The article by Mehlum et al. (2019) provides important new information on longer-term 
outcomes of DBT for adolescents with suicidal and self-harming behavior. In their 3-year 
follow-up, DBT remained superior to clinic UC in reducing the frequency of self-harm. For 
other clinical outcomes (e.g. borderline symptoms, depression) there were no significant 
between-group differences, with no sign of symptom relapse in either group. This 
consistently larger long-term reduction in self-harm for adolescents receiving DBT is 
important from a suicide preventive perspective and with respect to quality of life. 
Importantly, a reduction in participants’ experience of hopelessness during the trial treatment 
phase served as a mediator of the effect of DBT on self-harm frequency over the long-term. 
Intense hopelessness may impede adolescents’ willingness, or ability, to give up self-harm 
and try alternative emotion regulation strategies. Therefore, clinicians should address and 
treat hopelessness actively, for example by using cognitive strategies such as 
psychoeducation, helping adolescents link problem-behaviors to their goals, teaching coping 
skills and coaching on how to use these skills in daily life, and instilling hope regarding 
benefits of treatment.

While we currently have the strongest empirical support for DBT, other treatments have 
shown promise in single trials. These treatments range from mentalization-based treatment, 
family and parenting treatments, and a variety of cognitive-behavior therapies (CBTs). 
However, there have also been negative trials, underscoring the importance of careful 
consideration of the key components needed to disrupt suicidal/self-harm tendencies and the 
complex pathways leading to self-harm (for reviews, Glenn et al., 2019; Iyengar et al., 2018; 
Ougrin, Tranah, Stahl, Moran, & Asarnow, 2015).

These data documenting the efficacy of relatively intensive outpatient treatment approaches 
underscore the point that we have safe alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for a 
sizeable subgroup of youths with elevated SA/self-harm risk. Moreover, data from 
randomized controlled trials indicate benefits of intensive community-based services, 
compared to usual inpatient hospital care, on self-harm variables (Ougrin et al., 2018; Huey 
et al., 2004). These collective data underscore the value of intensive community treatment 
for improving the youths’ abilities to cope with environmental stress without engaging in 
self-harm while avoiding the potential for exposure to self-harm related talk or behavior 
within psychiatric inpatient settings.

Replication of initial findings for any promising novel intervention is extremely important, 
yet this frequently proves challenging, as evident from the article by Esposito-Smythers et 
al. (2019). Building on the success of their prior small trial in which an integrated CBT for 
youths with substance use disorders plus SI or SAs led to significantly fewer SAs compared 
to usual care (Esposito-Smythers et al., 2011), Esposito-Smythers et al. (2019) report on a 
second larger trial with a somewhat different population (included youths with co-occurring 
risk factors other than substance use disorder, and required presence of depressive disorder)

and somewhat different CBT (expanded focus). With these protocol differences, there was 
no evidence of an advantage of the new Family Focused-CBT (F-CBT), compared to UC 
enhanced with supportive follow-up contacts and medication treatment by the study 
psychiatrist.

Consistent with the earlier point regarding heterogeneity in the population of youths at risk 
for suicide/SH, the variation in sampling characteristics combined with possible 
improvements in UC underscore the importance of carefully defining samples and targeting 
treatment to the needs of individual youths. The initial Esposito-Smythers trial (2011), 
which focused on youths with co-occurring suicidality and substance use problems, found 
striking improvements in substance use which may have been an important driver of reduced 
SAs. This would not have applied consistently across the new trial. Other features of the 
later sample and methods, compared to the earlier study, could also explain the discrepant 
results, including: greater severity and acuity of psychopathology; higher rate of anxiety 
disorders; higher use of partial hospitalization/stepped down services; and a more lenient 
definition of SAs. It is also possible that F-CBT is comparable to UC in the study-
community, that effect sizes are marginal, or that we are in danger of making type II errors 
that will set back knowledge development. Among lessons learned for practitioners and 
researchers is that studies need to be adequately powered, that we need to ensure that 
assessment measures are optimally suited to measure primary outcomes, and careful sample 
description and replication are essential for providing the information we need to advance 
care.

Adrian et al.’s (2019) report on the U.S. DBT trial (McCauley et al., 2018) addresses the 
important issue of how to personalize treatment and match individuals to treatments that are 
most likely to be beneficial. Results suggests that it was, overall, the adolescents who 
seemed to need treatment the most (having more extensive self-harm histories, more 
externalizing symptoms, higher conflict families) who seemed to benefit the most from 
treatment. Still, DBT was associated with significantly stronger treatment gains than IGST 
for adolescents who had higher baseline emotion dysregulation and had parents with more 
severe emotion dysregulation, while the same was not the case for adolescents who had a 
more severe self-harm history and comorbidities. These latter factors served as predictors of 
future self-harm during the trial, regardless of treatment condition. For both clinicians and 
consumers of mental health services the implication of these findings is that DBT may be 
best suited for adolescents – and their parents – who struggle with emotion dysregulation.

In summary, while negative trials and failures to replicate are to be expected, the weight of 
the evidence supports the value of a variety of treatments for youths presenting with self-
harm and suicidality (Glenn et al., 2019; Ougrin et al., 2015; Iyengar et al., 2018). It also 
merits note, that analyses across trials support the importance of including a strong family 
component in the treatment of suicidality and self-harm, as evidence for efficacy was 
stronger for interventions (like DBT) that included a strong family component combined 
with individual treatment in both meta-analyses (Ougrin et al. 2015) and systematic reviews 
(Glenn et al., 2019, Iyengar et al., 2018). It may be that just as seat belts have been 
instrumental in reducing deaths by traffic accidents, we may need to support parents and

trusted adults in youths’ lives to function like “protective seatbelts” and keep them safe 
during times of acute pain and emotional distress (Asarnow et al., 2017).

Step 3: Community level care strategies & universal community suicide prevention

New results on the U.S. Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Prevention Program (GLS), support the 
longer-term effectiveness of universal community-based suicide prevention approaches for 
reducing youth suicide mortality (Godoy-Garraza et al., 2019). From the practitioner 
perspective, it is important to note that GLS programs were diverse and adapted for their 
communities. Program activities included: gatekeeper training, outreach and awareness 
strategies, screening and early detection strategies, clinical services, continuity of care and 
means restriction (Goldston, et al., 2010). Gatekeeper training was included across GLS 
programs and used as an indicator of program implementation in the study. Thus, one factor 
contributing to the effectiveness of GLS may have been the ability of communities to 
identify individuals with elevated suicide- risk and link them to clinical services, 
highlighting the importance of practitioner care in combination with community-wide 
suicide prevention activities.

In the new GLS evaluation (Godoy-Garraza et al., 2019), comparisons of counties and tribal 
communities implementing GLS, with matched control counties, indicated significantly 
lower youth suicide mortality rates in GLS counties, with an estimated 882 deaths avoided/
lives saved between 2007 and 2015. The benefits of GLS programs were significantly 
stronger and more long-lasting than previously known, particularly in rural counties. 
Communities implementing GLS activities for 7 years were estimated to haves 13.3 fewer 
deaths per 100,000 youths, compared to 3.32 fewer deaths per 100,000 youths in 
communities implementing these programs for only one year. Importantly, however, by two 
years after GLS activities ended, benefits waned.

The article by Wyman et al. (2019) highlights the importance of school-based suicide 
prevention activities, as well as the importance of attending to the school environments of 
youths who are in treatment for SA/self-harm risk. In this analysis of school networks across 
38 U.S. high schools, SAs were found to be more frequent in youths who were more isolated 
from adults and exposed to suicidal friends. Similarly, in schools with higher SA rates, 
youths experiencing SI or suicidal behavior tended to have higher relative popularity among 
their peers, and more students were isolated from adults. In schools with lower SA and SI 
rates, a relatively small group of adults were identified as trusted adults by students. These 
findings have important implications both for developing school-based suicide prevention, 
and highlight possible protective patterns that practitioners can use to enhance their 
treatments. As in the King et al. study (2019a) that found that enhancing adult social support 
through activating a “Youth Nominated Support Team” led to reduced deaths 14 years later, 
these results underscore the potential benefits of practitioner interventions that aim to 
strengthen connections with supportive adults in the schools of their patients. These findings 
are also consistent with the approach of mobilizing social/environmental strengths, included 
as a key component in several of the treatment interventions that have been shown to yield 
benefits such as DBT, SAFETY, and Multisystemic Therapy (Huey et al.,2004). From the 
perspective of practitioners in schools and other group settings, the Wyman et al. (2019)

results highlight the potential of network-informed suicide prevention that strengthens 
protective bonds within the population, increases connections between youths and a small 
number of adults who can serve a protective function, and promoting the influence of 
healthy youths who are free of SH and suicidal tendencies.

More direct evidence for the value of universal school-based suicide prevention is provided 
by the report by Barzilay et al. (2019) on the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in 
Europe (SEYLE) study. The primary SEYLE finding was that the Youth Aware of Mental 
Health program (YAM), was significantly more effective than a no-intervention control 
condition in preventing youths from developing SAs and or severe SI, with a greater than 
50% reduction in SAs among YAM youths, relative to controls (Wasserman et al., 2015). 
YAM is a manualized intervention that aimed to increase mental health awareness about 
suicide risk and protective factors and depression, and to strengthen skills for coping with 
stress and suicidality.

Barzilay et al. (2019) found that among YAM youths the effect of health risk behaviors (e.g. 
smoking, substance use, risky sexual behavior) on increasing the likelihood of repeated SAs 
(versus no SAs) was reduced, relative to controls. Further, while the combination of baseline 
SI and SH was associated with increased likelihood of repeat SAs over 12 months among 
control-youths (no study intervention), this was not the case for youths receiving the SEYLE 
interventions (YAM; Screening by Professionals; Question, Persuade and Refer). These data 
suggest that the YAM intervention effectively targeted mechanisms through which health 
risk behaviors at baseline impacted SA-risk 12-months later, and that all of the interventions 
reduced the interactive effect of baseline SI plus self-harm on increasing SA-risk, perhaps by 
improving identification and care for youths with elevated SA risk. School-based preventive 
interventions may have power for reversing these risk mechanisms.

The new results presented in this issue, combined with other data supporting the value of 
some suicide prevention programs for reducing later SAs, highlight the promise of 
community-based suicide prevention strategies for reducing youth suicide and SA rates (for 
review, Wilcox & Wyman, 2016). Given the heterogeneity and complexity of pathways to 
suicide deaths, an approach that includes effective universal, secondary, and tertiary 
prevention strategies will likely yield the greatest benefits at a population level. For tertiary 
prevention among youths who have already shown self-harm behavior/tendencies, intensive 
community treatment strategies that reduce unnecessary exposure to hospitalization and 
crisis services may be an important component (Ougrin et al., 2018; Coyle et al., 2018).

Suggestions for clinical guidance

This practitioner update highlights the progress made since the prior review (Ougrin et al. 
2012) and implications for clinical care. With the caveat that our science is evolving and 
results do not always replicate, we offer suggestions for clinical guidance.

Given that suicide is a leading cause of death among young people, screening for 
suicide-risk when accompanied by resources for addressing identified risk is 
indicated. Feasible evidence-informed screeners, screening protocols, and risk 
stratification algorithms exist and are widely available (https://

Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for treating self-harm and SA risk have 
been identified. While DBT currently meets Level 1 criteria for an efficacious 
treatment for reducing self-harm in adolescents (2 independent trials by different 
research teams), DBT is an intensive treatment and participation in DBT limits 
potential for other important activities (e.g. homework, sports, friends) which can 
also yield benefits. Other promising treatments have been identified, could prove 
superior to DBT, and we are beginning to learn about how best to personalize 
treatment approaches to best match individuals to the treatments that are most 
likely to be beneficial. Indeed, current work is evaluating stepped care protocols 
which aim to match the intensity of services offered to the level of risk identified.

A key message from existing research is that treatment for SA/self-harm must 
consider the family and youth’s social environmental context. Both treatments 
and preventive interventions that address the psychosocial environment, and 
enhance the ability of trusted adults in the youths’ lives to protect and support 
them, appear to yield the greatest benefits. Identification and activation of parents 
and trusted adults who can function like “protective seatbelts” and keep youths 
safe during moments when they experience suicidal/SH urges may enhance the 
outcomes of care regardless of the type of treatment delivered. (Asarnow et al., 
2017; King et al., 2019b; Wyman, 2019).

Most youths spend a great deal of time in school, the impact of the school 
environment cannot be ignored as patterns within schools are associated with 
differences in the risk of SI and SAs. Practitioners in both school and mental 
health settings should consider the school environment in their treatment plans 
and work to enhance protective influences within the school. More attention is 
also needed to media exposure and internet use patterns among our youths as 
these may impact suicide/self-harm risk; a point underscored by the disturbing 
increase in youth suicide deaths in the U.S., compared to expected rates, after the 
release of a Netflix series involving a fictional portrayal of suicide and traumatic 
stress that did not follow recommendations for responsible presentation of media 
content to prevent possible suicide contagion (Durkee et al., 2016; 
Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2019)

Given that many youths presenting with SA/self-harm are receiving medication 
treatments, there is a notable lack of evidence on pharmacotherapy. While the 
heterogeneity of the population and variation in presenting clinical disorders may 
contribute to this lack of research, data are needed to inform clinical care. The 
high levels of depression in this population in conjunction with the warnings 
issued regarding possible increases in suicidality with antidepressant treatment in 
some youths (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018; Hetrick, et al., 2012) and 
the widespread, but not empirically supported, use of polypharmacy in

adolescents with SA and/or NSSI underscores the importance of research to 
further inform clinical care.

A trauma-informed approach to care for suicide/self-harm risk is needed both 
due to the strong associations between traumatic stress exposure and suicidality/
self-harm, and the impact of suicidal behavior on parents and others in youths’ 
social environments. Practitioners may also experience secondary traumatic 
stress when working with highly suicidal self-harming youths. Knowing the 
signs and symptoms of trauma, integrating knowledge about trauma into care 
practices, taking action to prevent re-traumatization and exposure to secondary 
traumatic stress, and self-care are important for ensuring optimal care 
(SAMHSA, 2014).

Both community-wide and school based universal suicide prevention programs 
have strong promise for tackling the problem of increasing youth suicide rates. 
These programs work when implemented and appear to provide access to life-
saving care to vulnerable youths. Sustaining these programs is crucial, as effects 
wane when programs are discontinued.

Improving access to care is critical for improving youth outcomes. Community 
and school-based suicide preventive care provides one avenue for increasing 
access to care, as does integrated medical-behavioral health care and e-health and 
m-health technologies to increase the number of youths who receive needed 
services (Kaess et al., 2019; Kennard et al., 2018; Asarnow & Miranda, 2014).

Conclusions

Research presented in this Special Issue highlights the advances achieved in knowledge 
regarding treatment for suicidal and self-harming youths as well as suicide prevention 
strategies. Much has been learned since the 2012 practitioner review. Although additional 
research is needed, these advances in knowledge can help us to enrich suicide/self-harm 
preventive care with evidence on the most effective care strategies and meet the challenging 
of doing our best to improve care and outcomes in our communities.

Suicide is a leading cause of death globally in youths and suicidal behavior 
and deliberate self-harm are major clinical concerns; this article updates the 
2012 practitioner review by integrating new research evidence on youths.

Current evidence supports: 1) the value of brief screeners for detecting 
elevated suicide risk; the efficacy of some treatments for suicidal and self-
harm behavior, with dialectical behavior therapy currently meeting Level 1 
criteria (2 independent trials supporting efficacy) as the first well-established 
treatment for deliberate self-harm, and 3) the effectiveness of some 
community-based suicide prevention strategies for reducing suicide mortality 
and suicide attempt rates.

Treatments and preventive interventions that address the psychological needs 
of youths while also enhancing the ability of trusted adults to protect and 
support youths and strengthen protective processes in the environment appear 
to yield the greatest benefits.
