Abstract 
Background:  Neuregulin1 (NRG1) plays a role in neuronal migration, regulation of synaptic plasticity, and neural 
survival, and has been considered to be among the candidate genes for schizophrenia. This study focused on the 
variations in serum NRG1β1 levels following antipsychotic treatment and the relationship between NRG1β1 levels 
and improvements in psychotic symptoms among first-episode drug-naïve (FEDN) patients and patients with chronic 
schizophrenia.

Methods:  A total of 100 patients with schizophrenia were recruited and compared with 79 matched healthy 
controls. All patients had been drug-naïve for at least four weeks. Serum NRG1β1 levels and positive and negative 
syndrome scale (PANSS) scores were measured at baseline and after four weeks. Serum NRG1β1 levels were measured 
using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

Results:  Baseline NRG1β1 levels were significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy controls. 
NRG1β1 levels increased significantly following antipsychotic treatment. NRG1β1 levels gradually increased with 
declining PANSS scores and its three subscales during antipsychotic therapy. The levels of NRG1β1 increased signifi-
cantly in responders after four weeks of treatment, although nonresponders showed no such effect. Correlation analy-
ses showed that the levels of NRG1β1 were negatively correlated with the duration of illness and positively correlated 
with improvement in symptoms.

Conclusion:  The levels of serum NRG1β1 and the therapeutic effects gradually increased following treatment, indi-
cating that NRG1β1 may be an indicator of therapy, and that it may also be associated with the pathophysiological 
mechanism causing schizophrenia, although this possible pathway requires further investigation.

Introduction
Schizophrenia  is  one  of  the  most  severe  and  complex 
mental  disorders  and  affects  nearly  1%  of  the  global 
population;  its  rising  prevalence  has  led  to  a  greater 
burden  in  underdeveloped  countries  [1].  Nevertheless, 
only  approximately  half  of  patients  with  schizophrenia

receive satisfactory treatment because its symptoms vary, 
its  underlying  pathogenetic  mechanisms  have  yet  to  be 
elucidated,  and  antipsychotic  treatments,  and  their  side 
effects are poorly understood [2]. The evidence suggests 
that neurotrophic factors (NTFs) play a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and neurotrophic hypoth-
eses  have  gained  momentum  with  the  development  of 
antipsychotic therapies [3, 4].

Neuregulin  (NRG)  is  an  NTF  closely  related  to  the 
development of the central nervous system [5] and com-
prises  NRG1-4  isoforms,  among  which  NRG1  and  its 
receptor  ErbB4  are  thought  to  be  among  the  suscepti-
bility  genes  for  schizophrenia.  Moreover,  alterations  to 
the  NRG1  and  ErbB4  signaling  pathways  are  involved 
in  neuronal  migration,  regulation  of  synaptic  plasticity 
and  neural  survival,  which  may  be  the  neurobiological 
underpinnings of schizophrenia [6, 7]. Most importantly, 
an  increasing  number  of  studies  have  reported  that  the 
NRG1-ErbB4 signaling pathway is related to glutamater-
gic,  GABAergic  and  dopaminergic  neurotransmission 
[8];  this  signaling  pathway  also  plays  a  vital  role  in  the 
psychopathological  mechanism  of  schizophrenia,  and 
may  be  useful  in  evaluating  the  effect  of  antipsychotic 
medication therapies or new drug developments [9]. Sub-
sequently,  evidence  from  studies  of  mouse  models  has 
demonstrated that overexpression of heterozygous NRG1 
type  III  in  mice  regulates  schizophrenia-relevant  behav-
iors,  indicating  that  NRG1  is  associated  with  abnormal 
behavioral  phenotypes  in  schizophrenia  [10].  In  addi-
tion,  a  systematic  review  has  implied  that  antipsychotic 
drugs can modify some abnormal behaviors in NRG1 and 
ErbB4 knockout transgenic mouse models, and can affect 
the  expression  of  NRG1/ErbB4  and  the  functioning  of 
NRG1–ErbB4 signaling pathways [11].

A postmortem study reported that NRG1 type I mRNA 
expression  in  hippocampal  tissue  increased  in  patients 
with schizophrenia patients compared with controls [12]. 
In contrast, Parlapani et al. found that the expression of 
NRG1 type I is decreased and isoform II is increased in 
the prefrontal cortex of elderly patients with schizophre-
nia, indicating that the altered expression of NRG1 may 
play  an  important  role  during  neurodevelopment,  neu-
ronal migration and differentiation in schizophrenia [13]. 
In addition, an imaging genetic study suggested that the 
risk  T  allele  of  SNP8NRG243177,  which  has  been  iden-
tified  as  a  functional  single-nucleotide  polymorphism 
(SNP)  in  a  regulatory  domain  of  NRG1  that  impacts 
NRG1 function, can contribute to the enlargement of the 
lateral ventricles observed in early phases of schizophre-
nia  [14].  Genetic  variation  in  NRG1  has  also  been  asso-
ciated with hippocampal volume reductions in Icelandic 
patients  with  schizophrenia  and  in  nonaffected  family 
members [15].

A previous study found that NRG1 mRNA expression 
in  peripheral  lymphocytes  is  abnormally  low  in  first 
onset  schizophrenia,  and  that  this  expression  gradu-
ally  increases  in  antipsychotic  treated  patients,  dem-
onstrating  that  NRG1  mRNA  may  serve  as  a  potential 
therapeutic  marker  [16].  Another  study  in  an  Austral-
ian  cohort  showed  that  serum  NRG1β1  protein  levels 
are  lower  in  clozapine-treated  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia than in healthy controls, while there is no dif-
ference in the mRNA expression of NRG1 type III [17]. 
Research by Kastin indicated that NRG-1 can enter the 
spinal cord and brain by a saturable receptor-mediated 
mechanism,  indicating  the  possibility  that  NRG-1-b1 
may  be  a  promising  candidate  in  central  nervous  sys-
tem therapeutics [18].

Taken  together,  these  studies  have  provided  evidence 
that  abnormal  expression  and  function  of  NRG1  may 
be  associated  with  pathophysiological  mechanisms  and 
therapeutic effects in schizophrenia, although these stud-
ies have failed to show a consistent relationship between 
NRG1 and schizophrenia. Accordingly, we hypothesized 
that antipsychotic treatment may alter NRG1 levels. This 
study  was  designed  to  determine:  (1)  whether  serum 
NRG1β1  levels  were  altered  after  atypical  antipsychotic 
treatment; and (2) whether alterations in serum NRG1β1 
levels  were  correlated  with  improvements  in  psychotic 
symptoms  among  first-episode  drug-naïve 
(FEDN) 
patients and patients with chronic schizophrenia. Previ-
ously,  only  a  few  studies  have  explored  the  relationship 
between serum NRG1β1 levels and the therapeutic effect 
of antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia 
of Han Chinese ancestry.

Methods
Subjects, assessment and study procedures
A total of 69 (male/female = 34/35) FEDN patients and 31 
(male/female = 21/10)  chronic  patients  with  schizophre-
nia  were  recruited  from  Wu  Tai  Shan  Hospital,  Yang-
Zhou,  China.  The  medication  of  chronic  patients  with 
schizophrenia  was  stopped  for  4  weeks.  The  total  male/
female ratio was 55/45, the mean age (± standard devia-
tion  SD)  was  35.07 ± 11.42  years,  the  mean  period  in 
education was 10.40 ± 3.43 years, the mean age at schiz-
ophrenia  onset  was  29.59 ± 10.64  years,  and  the  mean 
duration of illness was 5.36 ± 7.58 years. All patients were 
confirmed  to  have  schizophrenia  by  using  the  Struc-
tured Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual-IV  (SCID).  Psychotic  symptoms  were  assessed 
by  two  experienced  psychiatric  specialists  using  posi-
tive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores before 
treatment and four weeks after treatment. The interrater 
correlation  coefficient  for  the  PANSS  score  was > 0.8. 
The exclusion criteria were epilepsy, mental retardation,

dementia,  traumatic  or  chronic  brain  injury,  alcohol  or 
substance  dependence/abuse,  thyroid  diseases,  diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy, and patients currently undergoing 
psychopharmacological treatment.

Patients were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, 
including: clozapine (n = 7), risperidone (n = 16), ziprasi-
done  (n = 5),  quetiapine  (n = 8),  olanzapine  (n = 6),  ami-
sulpride (n = 13), aripiprazole (n = 8), or a combination of 
these antipsychotics (n = 37). Antipsychotic dosages were 
personalized according to the clinical symptoms of each 
participant. Participants were divided into responder and 
nonresponder  groups  according  to  symptom  improve-
ment  on  the  basis  of  a  25%  reduction  in  the  baseline 
PANSS score after four weeks of treatment [19].

We  also  recruited  seventy-nine  controls  in  good 
physical  health  (male/female = 44/35)  from  the  local 
community 
in  Yangzhou,  with  an  average  age  of 
35.92 ± 11.00  years  and  a  mean  time  in  education  of 
12.48 ± 3.77  years. The  health  status  of  the  subjects  was 
identified  by  physical  examination  and  laboratory  tests. 
Participants who had a family history of mental illness or 
were diagnosed with any Axis I disorders were excluded.

All  participants  in  this  study  gave  informed  written 
consent, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Wu Tai Shan Hospital.

NRG1β1 assessment

We collected venous blood samples from patients at base-
line  and  after  four  weeks  of  medication,  while  healthy 
controls were only sampled at baseline. All venous blood 
samples  from  both  patients  and  healthy  controls  were 
collected from the forearm vein between 07:00 and 09:00. 
The  samples  were  tested  by  the  same  investigator  and 
our  research  team  was  blinded  to  the  clinical  status  of 
this  study.  Peripheral  blood  was  separated  by  centrifu-
gation  at  3000  g  for  15  min  and  then  stored  at  -80  °C 

until use. Serum NRG1β1 levels were tested using sand-
wich  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assays  (ELISAs)  in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (DY377; 
R&D  Systems,  Minneapolis,  MN,  USA).  The  serum 
NRG1β1  levels  were  expressed  in  ng/mL,  and  the  intra-
assay and interassay variation coefficients were < 5%, with 
0.125 ng/mL as the lower detection limit.

Statistical analysis

Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences  (SPSS)  19.0  was 
used to analyze all of the data. Chi-square tests were used 
to compare categorical variables. The distribution of the 
data was examined using the Kolmogorov‒Smirnov test. 
Quantitative variables are expressed as the mean ± stand-
ard deviation (SD). Independent sample t-tests or paired 
samples  t-tests  or  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  were 
performed  for  normality  continuous  variables.  Analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyze potentially 
confounding variables such as sex, age and years of edu-
cation. Relationships between serum NRG1β1 levels and 
normally  distributed  continuous  variables  were  assessed 
using  Pearson’s  correlation  analysis,  while  relationships 
between  serum  NRG1β1  levels  and  nonparametric  con-
tinuous  variables  were  evaluated  using  Spearman’s  cor-
relation analysis. We used stepwise regression analysis to 
investigate the associations of NRG1β1 serum levels with 
demographic data and clinical characteristics. Effect size 
determination  and  power  calculation  were  carried  out 
using the G*Power3 program [20]. The results were con-
sidered significant when p < 0.05.

there  were  no  significant  differences  in  sex,  smok-
ing  or  body  mass  index  (BMI)  among  FEDN  patients, 
patients  with  chronic  schizophrenia  and  healthy 
controls  (p > 0.05).  There  were  no  significant  corre-
lations  between  NRG1β1  levels  and  sex,  age  or  edu-
cation  in  the  two  groups  (p > 0.05).  The  mean  dose  of 
antipsychotic  drugs  (chlorpromazine  equivalent)  was 
638.04 ± 268.95  mg/day.  In  the  patient  group,  dura-
tion  of  illness,  age  at  schizophrenia  onset,  and  antip-
sychotic  dose  were  not  associated  with  NRG1β1  levels 
(all p > 0.05). Table  2 shows the significant reduction in 
PANSS  scores  and  its  three  subscales  after  treatment 
(all P = 0.000). The results of P values of the Kolmogo-
rov‒Smirnov test were presented in the supplementary 
materials.

NRG1β1 levels

Independent  sample  t-tests  showed  that  baseline 
serum  NRG1β1  levels  in  the  patient  group  were  sig-
nificantly  decreased  compared  with  those  in  control 
group  (7.58 ± 4.03  vs.  11.87 ± 6.69  ng/mL,  F = 42.918, 
t = -5.030,  P < 0.000)  with  an  effect  size  of  0.36  and  a 
power of 0.78. Paired sample t-tests showed that base-
line  serum  NRG1β1  levels  were  significantly  lower 
than  posttreatment  levels  among  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia  (7.58 ± 4.03  vs.  10.89 ± 6.97  ng/mL,  t = -4.341, 
P = 0.000),  with  an  effect  size  of  0.27  and  a  power  of 
0.58  (Fig.  1).  Significant  differences  remained  when 
accounting  for  covariates  such  as  sex,  age,  educa-
tion,  smoking,  BMI,  and  chlorpromazine  equivalent 
(P < 0.000).  In  addition,  no  significant  differences  in 
NRG1β1  levels  were  detected  between  the  patient 
group  after  antipsychotic  treatment  and  healthy  con-
trols (t = 0.951,  P = 0.343; Fig.  1). In the patient group, 
there was no significant correlation between the PANSS 
total  and  its  subscale  scores,  or  NRG1β1  serum  levels 
(all P > 0.05). The other correlation analysis data can be 
found in the supplementary materials.

in responders

Patients  with  schizophrenia  who  had  a  posttreatment 
PANSS  score  greater  than  25%  different  from  their 
baseline  score  were  considered  responders.  After  four 
weeks of antipsychotic drug treatment, 85% of patients 
were  classified  as  responders,  while  15%  of  patients 
were  placed  into  the  nonresponder  group.  In  the 
responder group, serum NRG1β1 levels were markedly 
higher after treatment (11.32 ± 7.00 ng/mL) than before 
treatment  (7.50 ± 4.21  ng/mL)  (t = 4.555,  P = 0.000,

In  contrast,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the

Discussion
The  results  of  this  study  demonstrated  that  1)  NRG1β1 
levels were lower in FEDN patients with chronic schizo-
phrenia  than  in  healthy  controls;  2)  levels  of  NRG1β1 
increased  significantly  after  antipsychotic  treatment 
along  with  improvements  in  psychotic  symptoms;  and 
3)  NRG1β1  levels  were  negatively  associated  with  the 
duration  of  illness  in  the  responder  group.  To  date,  few 
studies  have  examined  the  relationship  between  serum 
NRG1β1  levels  and  antipsychotic  medication  in  FEDN 
patients with chronic schizophrenia.

This study found decreased serum levels of NRG1β1 in 
FEDN patients and chronic patients with schizophrenia, 
which  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  another  study  of 
patients of Han Chinese ancestry, indicating significantly 
lower  NRG1  levels  in  participants  with  first  episode 
schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia than in healthy 
controls  [21].  However,  there  are  contradictory  findings 
reported  in  the  literature;  one  study  reported  elevated 
cleavage  of  neuregulin-1  by  β-secretase  (BACE1)  in  the 
plasma of patients with schizophrenia and a relationship 
between BACE1-cleaved-NRG1 activity and both disease 
severity  and  disease  duration  [22].  Moreover,  Yamamori 
et al. measured the mRNA expression levels of NRG1 in 
immortalized  lymphocytes  and  found  no  difference  in 
the expression of the NRG1 gene between patients with 
schizophrenia  and  controls  [23].  Numerous  factors  may 
account  for  these  differences,  such  as  demographic  dif-
ferences  (age,  sex,  time  in  education,  body  mass  index, 
smoking,  or  ethnicity),  age  at  schizophrenia  onset,  drug 
treatment,  duration  of  illness,  disease  severity,  or  meth-
odological or test protocol differences. Different degrees 
of  genetic  variations  or  differences  in  the  subtypes  of 
patients with schizophrenia may also have contributed to 
the discrepancies in the reported serum NRG1 levels. The 
decreased  serum  NRG1β1  levels  found  in  this  study  are 
consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  brains  of  patients 
with  schizophrenia.  For  example,  significantly  reduced 
NRG-1α protein levels have been found in the white mat-
ter of the prefrontal cortex [24]. Furthermore, Hashimoto 

Notably, 

et  al.  reported  a  decrease  in  NRG-1  type  II/type  I  and 
type II/type III mRNA expression ratios in the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) of schizophrenic patients [25]. Nonetheless, 
our  evidence  suggests  that  variation  in  NRG1β1  levels 
may  be  responsible  for  the  pathophysiology  and  clinical 
manifestation of schizophrenia, even though the underly-
ing mechanisms remain largely unknown.
this  study  demonstrated 

that  elevated 
NRG1β1 
levels  are  associated  with  the  early-stage 
therapeutic  effects  of  typical  antipsychotic  treatments. 
The  detected  NRG1β1  levels  were  markedly  higher  in 
responders  after  four  weeks  of  treatment,  whereas  no 
differences  were  observed  in  nonresponders.  Addition-
ally, in a clinical study of a 2-week treatment of first-onset 
patients with schizophrenia (who had not taken antipsy-
chotics  before)  with  the  antipsychotics  risperidone  and 
quetiapine,  the  NRG1  mRNA  expression  of  peripheral 
blood  lymphocytes  (PBLs)  gradually  and  significantly 
increased after therapy, compared with the pretreatment 
levels  [16].  Although  different  atypical  antipsychotic 
drugs were administered to responders, we speculate that 
increased  NRG1β1  plays  an  important  part  in  achiev-
ing  effective  medication  and  improvement  of  psychotic 
symptoms  through  its  effects  on  the  various  signaling 
pathways.  The  exact  pharmacological  and  pathophysi-
ological mechanisms remain obscure and warrant further 
investigation.

Several  animal  studies  have  shown  that  NRG1/ErbB4 
(the NRG1 receptor) expression can be altered by treat-
ment  with  drugs  for  chronic  psychosis.  Dang  et  al. 
found  that  haloperidol  and  risperidone  both  increased 
the  expression  of  NRG1  in  the  brains  of  rats  during  a 
4-week treatment [26]. Hahn et al. reported that NRG1-
induced  ErB4  activation  is  significantly  reduced  in  the 
brains  of  mice  treated  with  haloperidol  compared  with 
controls  treated  with  vehicle  alone,  and  that  enhanced 
NRG1 signaling may contribute to N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA)  receptor  hypofunction  in  schizophrenia  [27]. 
In particular, one previous study found that NRG1 (both 
endogenous  and  exogenous)  plays  an  important  role  in 
maintaining  evoked  GABA  release  in  the  rat  prefrontal 
cortex  (GABAergic  dysfunction  is  implicated  in  schizo-
phrenia), suggesting that NRG1 may be involved in inter-
actions  with  other  signaling  pathways  which  could  be 
useful in understanding the pathogenesis of schizophre-
nia and the effects of treatment [28]. However, there was 
no significant effect of chronic haloperidol treatment on 
serum Ig-NRG1 immunoreactivity in monkeys after eight 
weeks  of  haloperidol  treatment  [29].  An  in  vitro  study 
showed  that  NRG1  protein  expression  is  upregulated 
in  human  fetal  brain  aggregates  exposed  to  clozapine; 
however,  these  effects  were  not  observed  in  haloperi-
dol exposed brain aggregates [30]. Taken together, these

studies  support  a  potential  mode  of  therapeutic  action 
for antipsychotics via NRG1–ErbB4 signaling which con-
tributes  to  treatment  efficacy  in  controlling  schizophre-
nia symptoms.

Generally,  a  longer  duration  of  illness  hinders  treat-
ment  response  and  is  related  to  more  severe  negative 
symptoms.  Earlier  intervention  could  shorten  the  dura-
tion of illness and lead to a more favorable prognosis in 
patients  with  schizophrenia  [31].  Our  analysis  demon-
strated  that  there  was  a  negative  correlation  between 
NRG1β1  level  and  duration  of  illness  in  responders. 
The  results  showed  that  patients  with  longer  histories 
of  schizophrenia  may  have  lower  NRG1β1  levels,  indi-
cating  that  the  length  of  illness  is  associated  with  nerv-
ous  system  impairments,  leading  to  perturbed  NRG1β1 
synthesis,  release  and  modulation  of  neuronal  activity. 
Shorter periods of illness inflict less damage on the cen-
tral nervous system and may allow for better therapeutic 
outcomes.  Kataria  et.  al.  showed  that  NRG1/ErbB  par-
ticipates  in  different  neurodevelopmental  processes  and 
is  involved  in  dopaminergic  neurotransmission  as  well 
as  the  survival  of  dopaminergic  neurons  [32].  Interest-
ingly,  we  found  a  positive  correlation  between  NRG1β1 
levels and improvement in symptoms in responders. One 
explanation  for  the  underlying  mechanism  is  that  the 
relationship between NRG1β1 levels and improvement in 
symptoms may be the result of the body’s ability to prop-
erly  establish  positive  feedback  mechanisms  to  counter 
neuroimmune  system  damage. Therefore,  in  view  of  the 
relationship between NRG1β1 levels and the duration of 
illness and symptoms, we hypothesize that NRG1β1 may 
be  an  indicator  of  therapeutic  effect  and  its  progress  in 
schizophrenia through interactions between neurotrans-
mitters  and  neurotrophic  biomarkers.  This  potential 
mechanism requires further study.

There are some limitations to this study. First, although 
the effect size was estimated prior to the study, the sam-
ple size was still small. Second, different atypical antipsy-
chotics may have different influences on serum NRG1β1 
levels, and further work is needed to compare the effects 
of  different  antipsychotics  on  NRG1β1  levels. Third,  the 
follow-up period was relatively short, and longer follow-
up  will  be  needed  in  the  future  to  provide  further  evi-
dence  for  revealing  the  pathophysiological  mechanisms 
of  schizophrenia.  Finally,  we  enrolled  chronic  patients 
with  schizophrenia,  admittedly,  age  at  schizophrenia 
onset,  duration  of  illness,  type  of  antipsychotic  medica-
tion and its side effects, number of disease relapses, BMI 
may have influences on the NRG1β1 levels.

In  conclusion,  this  study  demonstrated  that  serum 
NRG1β1 levels increased in FEDN patients and patients 
with chronic schizophrenia after medication with atyp-
ical  antipsychotic  drugs  in  addition  to  improvements 

in  psychotic  symptoms.  These  altered  NRG1β1  levels 
may  be  associated  with  the  progression  of  illness  and 
response  to  treatment.  This  study  provides  evidence 
that  NRG1β1  may  be  involved  in  the  pathophysiologi-
cal  and  potential  therapeutic  mechanisms  of  schizo-
phrenia, although the underlying pathways still require 
further investigation.
