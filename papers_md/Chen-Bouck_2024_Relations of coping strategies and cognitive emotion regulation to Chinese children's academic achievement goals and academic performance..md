Social–emotional skills (e.g., emotion regulation) influence a variety of academic outcomes 
among children. This study examined the relations of coping strategies and cognitive 
emotion regulation (CER) to academic achievement goals and academic performance 
among Chinese children (N = 401, age M = 10.52 years). Full Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) analysis showed that children’s use of active coping strategies was positively 
associated with their endorsement of performance approach and mastery avoidance 
goals. Avoidant and support-seeking coping strategies were not associated with any 
outcome  variables.  Maladaptive  CER  was  positively  associated  with  performance 
approach,  performance  avoidance,  and  mastery  avoidance  goals  and  negatively 
associated with academic performance; adaptive CER was positively associated with 
mastery approach goals but not associated with other outcome variables. The current 
study provided some preliminary evidence to indicate that active coping strategies, 
maladaptive CER, and adaptive CER were associated with academic achievement 
goals and academic performance among Chinese children. Although maladaptive 
CER was not used as often as adaptive CER by Chinese children, the more they used 
maladaptive CER, the more likely they were to have academic achievement goals 
that focused on things other than learning itself, whereas the more Chinese children 
used adaptive CER, the more likely they were to set an achievement goal to master 
the knowledge. Therefore, in teaching practices or intervention planning, decreasing 
maladaptive CER strategies may be as important as cultivating adaptive CER strategies 
to facilitate academic success among Chinese children.

Introduction

Since its introduction in the research literature in 1994, social and emotional learning 
(SEL) has gained popularity in research and educational practice (Hoffman, 2009). The SEL 
framework posits the importance of children’s ability to understand and manage their own 
emotions and interpersonal interactions for their academic success and overall well-being 
(Jones and Doolittle, 2017), and a growing body of literature links SEL programs to student 
academic achievement (e.g., Wigelsworth et al., 2016; Zins et al., 2004). The SEL framework 
views learning as a social process; students learn through collaboration with teachers and peers

and emotions can facilitate or hamper learning (Zins et al., 2004). For 
example, both positive and negative emotions can occupy space in 
working memory (Pekrun and Stephens, 2009) and potentially reduce 
available cognitive resources and obstruct learning (Ahmed et al., 
2013).  In  addition,  emotions  can  have  both  positive  and  negative 
impacts on students’ motivational processes (Kwon et al., 2017).

In the SEL framework, one major skill domain is self-management 
skills, which refers to the ability to successfully regulate one’s own 
emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and to set and work toward goals 
(Jones  and  Doolittle,  2017).  Research  on  relations  between  self-
management skills and academic outcomes has been prevalent for 
some time, however, most studies focus on participants from Western 
regions and few studies have examined this topic in China (Chung 
et al., 2020). Much research has illustrated how Asian and Western 
cultures have different norms for self-expression and views about self 
and others (Xu et al., 2006). These distinctive norms may foster a 
preference for some self-management strategies over others (Xu et al., 
2006).  Cross-cultural  research  (e.g.,  Ramzan  and  Amjad,  2017) 
indicates  differences  in  emotion  regulation  (an  element  of  self-
management) between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. For 
example, members of individualist cultures tend to prefer emotional 
expression, such as talking with others, to regulate emotions whereas 
members of collectivistic cultures often prefer expressive suppression 
(Chen and Kennedy, 2005; Ramzan and Amjad, 2017). Therefore, 
findings  based  on  Western  participants  may  not  apply  to  the 
Chinese context.

Late childhood to early adolescence (i.e., mid- to late elementary 
school  years)  is  a  stage  when  significant  changes  occur  in  coping 
processes and emotion regulation abilities (Zimmer-Gembeck and 
Skinner, 2011). Developmental changes in coping strategies include 
shifts  in  problem-solving  (from  instrumental  action  to  planful 
problem solving), greater self-reliance (versus reliance on adults), and 
greater capacity for using cognitive strategies to cope with stressful 
events (Zimmer-Gembeck and Skinner, 2011). Similarly, the capacity 
for emotion regulation develops substantially over the course of the 
elementary school years, with increasing ability to reduce the intensity 
of a current emotion and use of cognitive strategies with age (Martin 
and Ochsner, 2016). As children grow older, the strategies they use for 
emotion regulation shift from primarily external and behaviorally 
oriented ones to more internal and cognitively oriented ones, and by 
8 or 9 years of age, children have learned to regulate their emotions 
through cognitive emotion regulation (e.g., Saarni, 1999). However, 
empirical evidence regarding the specific associations between self-
management skills and academic outcomes among children in this 
particular age period is sparse (Kwon et al., 2017). In addition, given 
the dual emphasis on academic success and emotional well-being in 
contemporary China (e.g., Chen-Bouck et al., 2017), it is important to 
examine the relations between Chinese children’s self-management 
skills (i.e., coping strategies and cognitive emotion regulation) and 
their academic outcomes.

Coping strategies and academic outcomes

Coping  refers  to  the  ability  to  respond  to  stressful  events  and 
regulate one’s thoughts, emotions, and behavior under stress (Ayers 
et al., 1996). In the current study, coping strategies were examined 
through a modified four-factor model originally articulated by Ayers 

et al. (1996). This model includes active, distraction, avoidant, and 
support-seeking coping strategies. Active coping strategies include 
doing  something  or  making  plans  to  do  something  to  alter  the 
situation. Distraction coping includes attempts to take one’s mind off 
of stressful situations through engaging in pleasant activities (e.g., 
exercise). Avoidant coping involves trying to avoid engaging with or 
thinking about stressful situations. Support-seeking coping involves 
reaching out to others, either in the service of talking about feelings 
or seeking solutions to the problem.

Consistent  with  the  SEL  framework,  applying  social  and 
emotional skills has positive relations to students’ academic outcomes 
(e.g., better academic performance, more academic motivation, and 
higher  learning  goals;  Zins  et  al.,  2004).  Coping  strategies,  as  one 
aspect of self-management skills, may relate to students’ academic 
goals and performance in several ways. First, school may be a source 
of stressors (e.g., exams, grades) with which students must cope (e.g., 
Shih, 2018), and pressure for academic success is a noted source of 
stress  among  Chinese  students  (Zhou  et  al.,  2023).  Completing 
academic work outside of school (e.g., homework) is also a potential 
source of stress for Chinese students given the heavy homework loads 
assigned  by  Chinese  schools  as  well  as  parental  engagement  with 
children’s learning activities and school performance (Liu et al., 2019). 
Second, in addition to coping with academic stressors in particular, 
broader abilities to cope may promote academic success, whereas a 
lack  of  successful  coping  strategies  may  interfere  with  academic 
engagement and performance as students who lack effective coping 
skills may be distracted from schoolwork by their emotional reactions 
or intrusive thoughts (Mantzicopoulos, 1997; Skinner et al., 2016). 
Third, coping strategies may also relate to academic goals through 
mechanisms such as perceived competence and self-regulation (Liem, 
2022) or promoting a sense of school belonging (Thomas et al., 2023).
Students have different reasons for engaging or not engaging in 
learning activities, and these reasons are often framed as academic 
achievement  goals  (Patrick  et  al.,  2011).  One  commonly  used 
framework for examining academic achievement goals is Elliot and 
McGregor’s (2001) four-factor framework, which classifies students’ 
achievement goals using a 2×2 matrix along the domains of mastery / 
performance and approach / avoidance. Performance approach goals 
include  the  desire  to  demonstrate  one’s  competence,  achieve  high 
scores  or  grades,  and  outperform  other  students.  Performance 
avoidance goals incorporate the desire to avoid appearing incompetent 
or being viewed negatively by or relative to others. Mastery approach 
goals focus on a desire to master content and do one’s personal best 
within a domain. Finally, mastery avoidance goals emphasize a desire 
to avoid a lack of mastery or a failure to learn. Meta-analytic findings 
support the four-factor model and indicate that approach motivations 
are  associated  with  higher  academic  achievement  and  avoidance 
motivations  are  associated  with  lower  academic  achievement 
(Huang, 2012).

Most  research  on  the  relations  between  coping  strategies  and 
academic achievement goals has examined students’ coping strategies 
specifically related to academics (e.g., coping with academic failure). 
For  example,  a  study  of  Taiwanese  eighth  graders  suggested  that 
engagement  coping  (e.g.,  problem-focused  coping  or  cognitive 
restructuring)  was  positively  associated  with  both  approach  and 
avoidance mastery goals, and disengagement coping (e.g., withdrawal 
or denial) was negatively associated with mastery approach goals and 
positively associated with performance avoidance goals (Shih, 2018).

Broader  coping  strategies  may  also  relate  to  academic  motivation 
through mechanisms like perceived competence and self-regulation 
(Liem, 2022), however research on the relations between students’ 
broader coping strategies and their academic achievement goals is 
comparatively limited. In addition, coping strategies may vary in their 
effectiveness  based  on  match  or  mismatch  with  the  demands  of 
particular  situations  or  interactions  with  other  individual  or 
situational  variables.  For  example,  Vélez  et  al.  (2016)  found  that 
support  seeking  coping,  which  is  generally  considered  a  positive 
coping strategy, was associated with negative outcomes (e.g., greater 
depressive  symptoms)  for  early  adolescents  who  were  high 
in rumination.

The  relation  of  coping  strategies  to  academic  performance  is 
understudied relative to relations with other variables; for example, in 
her review of research on coping strategies in children and adolescents, 
Clarke  (2006)  found  only  6  studies  that  examined  academic 
performance as an outcome variable versus 72 studies of internalizing 
and externalizing problems. However, there is some evidence that 
coping strategies relate to academic performance (Skinner and Saxton, 
2019).  For  example,  empirical  studies  suggested  that  positive  and 
action-oriented coping strategies were positively related to intrinsic 
motivation  to  learn  and  academic  performance  in  children 
(Mantzicopoulos, 1997), engagement coping (or active coping) was 
related to academic competence in children (Valiente et al., 2009), and 
disengaged coping (i.e., denial and avoidance of academic problem) 
was  related  to  lower  grade  point  average  (GPA)  in  adolescents 
(Arsenio and Loria, 2014). In a meta-analytic review, Clarke (2006) 
found that the use of active coping strategies was tied to academic 
performance, although the effect size was small.

Cognitive emotion regulation and 
academic outcomes

Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) refers to mental strategies 
used  to  handle  emotionally  arousing  information  (Garnefski  and 
Kraaij,  2007).  CER  strategies  can  be  divided  into  two  general 
categories: maladaptive CER (e.g., blaming self or others, rumination) 
and adaptive CER (e.g., planning, positive reappraisal; Garnefski and 
Kraaij,  2007).  Some  maladaptive  CER  strategies  (i.e.,  rumination, 
catastrophizing,  and  self-blame)  are  associated  with  emotional 
problems across development (Domaradzka and Fajkowska, 2018; 
Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006), whereas adaptive CER strategies (e.g., 
positive reappraisal) are associated with positive outcomes, such as 
resilience following negative life events (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006). 
However, several studies have found that culture plays an important 
role  in  shaping  emotion  regulation  and  emotional  experiences  by 
creating  value  systems  that  facilitate  social  norms  for  regulating 
emotions  (Matsumoto  et  al.,  2008;  Miyamoto  et  al.,  2014).  For 
example, the use of emotion regulation strategies such as distancing 
and  shifting  focus  may  contribute  to  differences  in  emotional 
experience in China compared to the U.S. and other Western settings 
(Davis et al., 2012).

regulated.  For  example,  inefficient  emotion  regulation  might 
physiologically  inhibit  children’s  use  of  higher-order  cognitive 
processes (e.g., the ability to attend to and retain novel information; 
Blair, 2002). Second, students who lack effective CER strategies may 
be less likely to persist when faced with academic challenges, whereas 
adaptive  CER  strategies  may  promote  students’  persistence  in 
overcoming difficulties. For example, a study examining the role of 
emotion  regulation  in  mathematics  homework  among  Chinese 
adolescents  suggested  that  emotion  management  and  cognitive 
reappraisal were positively related to learning-oriented motivations 
(Xu,  2018).  Third,  CER  may  influence  academic  performance 
indirectly through influences on classroom engagement (Kwon et al., 
2017), or sleep quality (Tomaso et al., 2021). However, like the research 
on coping strategies, most existing research on CER in children and 
adolescents has focused on internalizing and externalizing problems 
(e.g.,  Domaradzka 
than 
academic outcomes.

and  Fajkowska,  2018), 

rather 

Although little research has specifically examined the associations 
between CER and academic achievement goals, research on CER and 
other academic factors provides relevant findings. For example, in a 
longitudinal study of U.S. elementary school students, Kwon et al. 
(2018) found that emotion regulation positively predicted academic 
engagement  14 months  later.  Academic  engagement  is  positively 
associated  with  academic  achievement  goals,  especially  approach 
goals (Datu and Park, 2019).

Studies  suggested  that  the  ability  to  regulate  one’s  emotions 
facilitates functioning in academic contexts (Fried, 2011), whereas the 
inability to regulate the intensity and duration of one’s emotions will 
hinder academic performance (Martin and Ochsner, 2016). In order 
to succeed in school, students must be able to manage and regulate 
their emotions, including emotions related to academic tasks (e.g., 
shame after getting a poor grade; Harley et al., 2019) and non-academic 
events that occur in school (e.g., anger about an argument with a 
friend;  Ben-Eliyahu  and  Kaplan,  2015).  Studies  that  examined 
emotion  regulation  broadly  suggested  relations  between  emotion 
regulation  and  academic  performance  in  children  (e.g.,  emotion 
regulation  was  positively  associated  with  achievement  test  scores; 
Schlesier et al., 2019).

The current study

The SEL framework posits the importance of children’s social and 
emotional skills in their academic success (Jones and Doolittle, 2017). 
Prior  studies  provided  evidence  for  possible  associations  between 
coping strategies and CER and children’s academic outcomes, however 
empirical evidence regarding the specific associations among children 
in the mid- to late elementary school years is sparse (Kwon et al., 
2017), let alone among samples from mainland China. Being informed 
by the SEL framework, the current study focused, cross-sectionally, on 
self-management skills, specifically the relations of coping and CER 
strategies with Chinese children’s academic achievement goals and 
academic performance.

CER may influence students’ academic behaviors and performance 
in multiple ways (Harley et al., 2019; Kwon et al., 2018; Schlesier et al., 
2019; Xu, 2018). First, students experience various emotions when 
engaging with academic tasks, and many of these emotions (e.g., test 
anxiety) can interfere with academic performance if not appropriately 

Regarding  coping  strategies,  we  hypothesized  that  active  and 
support seeking coping strategies would be positively associated with 
performance approach, mastery approach, and mastery avoidance 
goals,  and  academic  performance,  and  negatively  associated  with 
performance  avoidance  goals;  avoidant  coping  strategies  would

be  negatively  associated  with  performance  approach,  mastery 
approach, and mastery avoidance goals, and academic performance, 
and  positively  associated  with  performance  avoidance  goals. 
Regarding  CER,  we  hypothesized  that  maladaptive  CER  would 
be negatively associated with academic performance, but adaptive 
CER  would  be  positively  associated  with  academic  performance. 
Given the lack of previous studies, we examined associations between 
CER and academic achievement goals in an exploratory manner.

Materials and methods

Participants

In total 401 children (ages 9–13, M = 10.52, SD = 0.81; grades 4–6) 
participated in the study. Among the children, 46.1% were female and 
52.6% were male, 1.2% did not identify their gender; 93.8% identified 
as  Han  ethnicity  and  4%  as  ethnic  minorities,  and  2.2%  did  not 
identify  their  ethnicity.  Regarding  participants’  father’s  education 
level,  1.5%  had  an  elementary  level,  26.7%  had  a  secondary  level, 
59.9% had a college level, 11.0% had a graduate level of education, and 
1.0% did not indicate; among mothers, 1.2% had an elementary level, 
33.7%  had  a  secondary  level,  59.1%  had  college  level,  5.0%  had  a 
graduate level of education, and 1.0% did not indicate.

Procedure

Participants were recruited as part of a larger study of parenting 
and social, emotional, and academic outcomes for Chinese children 
[see (Chen-Bouck et al., 2021; Chen-Bouck et al., 2019) for other 
research drawing on this data set]. Participants were recruited from 
one elementary school in a large city in northwestern China. Written 
parental  consent  and  student  assent  were  obtained  prior  to  study 
participation. The study project was reviewed and approved by the 
Human Subjects Committee of the University of Kansas.

Measures

All measures were translated into Chinese using back-translation 
method (Werner and Campbell, 1970) and bilingual checking (Punnett 
and  Shenkar,  1996)  by  the  first  author  and  two  other  bilingual 
researchers, who are fluent in both Chinese and English. Pilot tests 
were conducted (using an independent sample of 40 children) to test 
participants’  understanding  of  the  content  and  wording  of  the 
translated Chinese measures. Minor adjustments of the translation 
were made according to participants’ feedback from the pilot tests.

Coping strategies

Participants’ coping strategies were measured with the Children’s 
Coping Strategies Checklist-3rd Revision (CCSC-R3; Arizona State 
University  Research  and  Education  Advancing  Children’s  Health 
(REACH)  Institute,  2006).  The  scale  identifies  various  coping 
strategies  that  children  use  during  difficult  situations.  CCSC-R3 
includes 56 items with three subscales. The Active Coping subscale 
includes two components, problem-focused coping (e.g., you thought 
about which things are best to do to handle the problem) and positive 

cognitive restructuring (e.g., you told yourself that you could handle 
this problem), with 24 items; the Avoidant Coping subscale has 12 
items (e.g., you tried to ignore it); and the Support Seeking Coping 
subscale has 16 items (e.g., you asked your parents for help in figuring 
out what to do). Four items in the CCSC-R3 regarding religion (e.g., 
you prayed more than usual) were excluded in the current study since 
this type of religious belief is not common in Chinese culture. Items 
were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (most of the 
time). For each subscale, a higher mean indicates more frequent use 
of the specific coping strategy. Ayers et al. (1996) provided evidence 
supporting the validity of the first version of this scale. In the current 
sample, the internal consistency coefficients for the Active Coping, the 
Avoidant Coping, and the Support Seeking Coping subscales were 
αs = 0.91, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively.

Cognitive emotion regulation

Participants’ emotion regulation was measured with the Cognitive 
Emotion  Regulation  Questionnaire  (CERQ;  Garnefski  and  Kraaij, 
2007). The CERQ includes 36 items with nine subscales, however, due 
to a technical error, the Positive Refocusing subscale was not included 
in the questionnaire, so eight subscales (32 items) were used in the 
current study. The eight subscales were: 1. Self-blame (e.g., I feel that 
I am the one to blame for it); 2. Rumination (e.g., I dwell upon the 
feelings the situation has evoked in me); 3. Catastrophizing (e.g., I keep 
thinking about how terrible it is what I have experienced); 4. Other-
blame (e.g., I feel that others are to blame for it); 5. Acceptance (e.g., I 
think that I cannot change anything about it); 6. Refocus on planning 
(e.g., I think about how I can best cope with the situation); 7. Positive 
reappraisal (e.g., I think that the situation also has its positive sides); 8. 
Putting into perspective (e.g., I think that it all could have been much 
worse). Response options ranged from 1 (never) to 4 (most of the time). 
In the current study, based on the definitions of the eight cognitive 
coping  strategies  from  the  CERQ  manual  and  suggestions  from 
previous  studies  (Garnefski  et  al.,  2002),  subscales  1  to  4  were 
combined  to  form  a  Maladaptive  CER  Subscale  (16  items);  and 
subscales 5 to 8 were combined to form an Adaptive CER Subscale (16 
items). For each subscale, a higher mean indicates more frequent use 
of specific emotion regulation strategies. The original scale is valid and 
has a relatively high test–retest reliability (Garnefski et al., 2001). In 
the  current  sample,  the  internal  consistency  coefficients  for  the 
Maladaptive CER and Adaptive CER subscales were αs = 0.82 and 
0.82, respectively.

Academic achievement goals

Participants’ academic achievement goals were measured with the 
Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ; Elliot and McGregor, 2001). 
The  scale  includes  12  items  with  four  subscales  (3  items  each): 
Performance Approach Goals (e.g., it is important for me to do better 
than other students), Performance Avoidance Goals (e.g., I just want 
to avoid doing poorly in this class), Mastery Approach Goals (e.g., I 
want  to  learn  as  much  as  possible  from  this  class),  and  Mastery 
Avoidance Goals (e.g., I worry that I may not learn all that I possibly 
could in this class). The items were rated on a 7-point scale ranging 
from 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (completely true of me). For each 
subscale, a higher mean indicates stronger endorsement of the specific 
achievement goal. The scale is valid and has good internal consistency 
(Elliot  and  McGregor,  2001).  In  the  current  sample,  the  internal 
consistency  coefficients  for  the  Performance  Approach  Goals,

respectively.

Academic performance

Participants’ academic performance was calculated by averaging 
scores (0–100 points scale) for the three major subjects in Chinese

Analytic strategy

The viability of the latent factors was established through the use 
of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) measurement models using 
R. Measurement models were achieved by examining the loadings of 
the  observed  variables  onto  the  latent  factors.  Low  factor  loading 
items  (i.e.,  factor  loading  <0.30;  Tavakol  and  Wetzel,  2020)  were 
excluded  from  further  analysis.  Then,  based  on  the  results  of  the 
measurement models, preliminary analyses were conducted, including 
descriptive  analysis,  Pearson  correlations  for  all  the  measures, 
one-way repeated measures ANOVA, and paired-samples t test using 
SPSS. SEM was then implemented using R package Lavaan (Rosseel, 
2012) to test the hypothesized model on the overall sample. Missing 
data were accounted for using full information maximum likelihood 
(FIML)  estimation  method.  Robust  maximum  likelihood  (MLR) 
estimator was used since the multivariate normality assumption was 
not met. To assess the overall goodness of fit, we used the chi-square 
test statistic. We also take the combination of comparative fit index 
(CFI; >0.90), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI; >0.90), the root mean square 
error  approximation  (RMSEA;  <0.06),  and  the  standardized  root 
mean  square  residual  (SRMR;  <0.08)  values  as  indicating  an 
acceptable fit.

Measurement models

The measurement model for coping strategies included 41 of the 
original  52  items  (i.e.,  Active  Coping  subscale  22  items,  Avoidant 
Coping subscale 8 items, and Support Seeking Coping subscale 11

Preliminary analyses

Regarding the three types of coping strategies, a one-way repeated 
measures ANOVA was conducted. The results showed that sphericity 
was  violated,  therefore  the  Greenhouse–Geisser  adjustment  was 
applied. The corrected degree of freedom and the corresponding F 
value were reported. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed 
significant  results,  F  (1.78,  665.79) = 118.24,  p < 0.001,  η2 = 0.24. 
Children used active coping strategies most frequently (M = 2.67), 
followed by support seeking (M = 2.30), and used avoidant strategies 
least frequently (M = 2.14). Regarding the two types of CER, a paired-
samples  t  test  indicated  a  statistically  significant  difference, 
t(382) = −22.48,  p < 0.001,  d = −1.15.  Children  used  adaptive  CER 
(M = 3.22)  more  than  maladaptive  CER  (M = 2.05).  Regarding 
academic achievement goals, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA 
was  conducted.  The  results  showed  that  sphericity  was  violated, 
therefore  the  Greenhouse–Geisser  adjustment  was  applied.  The 
corrected  degree  of  freedom  and  the  corresponding  F  value  were 
reported. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant 
results, F (2.90, 1102.83) = 69.32, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.15. Among the four 
achievement goals, children endorsed mastery approach goals most 
strongly  (M = 5.80);  followed  by  performance  avoidance  goals 
(M = 5.08) and mastery avoidance goals (M = 4.93) with no difference 
between the two avoidance goal types; children endorsed performance 
approach goals (M = 4.80) less strongly than performance avoidance 
goals (M = 5.08), but endorsed performance approach goals (M = 4.80) 
and mastery avoidance goals (M = 4.93) at the same level. Descriptive 
statistics and the Pearson correlations for all measures are reported in 
Table 1.

Full structural equation model

In the full structural equation model, direct paths were formulated 
between coping strategies (i.e., active, avoidant, and support seeking 
coping strategies), cognitive emotion regulation (i.e., maladaptive and 
adaptive  CER),  academic  achievement  goals  (i.e.,  performance 
approach, performance avoidance, mastery approach, and mastery 
avoidance goals), and academic performance. Five control variables 
were included in the model (i.e., age, gender, both parents’ education 
levels, and family annual income). Correlations among exogenous 
variables  were  estimated,  and  to  account  for  potential  relations 
between endogenous variables, correlations between the disturbance 
terms among them were also allowed.

For the sample, the model differed significantly from the data, χ2 
(2843) = 3857.58, p < 0.001, yet fit acceptably according to the Robust 
CFI = 0.91, Robust TLI = 0.90, Robust RMSEA = 0.03, 90% CI [0.03, 
0.03], and Robust SRMR = 0.05. Regarding the associations between 
coping strategies and outcome variables, the coefficients of the final 
structural model suggested that active coping strategies were positively 
associated with performance approach goals (β = 0.75, p = 0.002) and 
mastery avoidance goals (β = 0.34, p = 0.048). Support seeking and 
avoidant coping strategies were not significantly associated with any 
outcome variables. Maladaptive CER was positively associated with 
performance  approach  goals  (β = 0.33,  p = 0.001),  performance 
avoidance  goals  (β = 0.33,  p < 0.001),  and  mastery  avoidance  goals 
(β = 0.43,  p < 0.001),  and  negatively  associated  with  academic 
performance  (β = −0.22,  p = 0.002).  Adaptive  CER  was  positively

students.  In  addition,  contrary  to  our  hypotheses,  we  found  no 
association  between  either  support-seeking  coping  strategies  or 
avoidant coping strategies and any outcome variable.

Discussion

Although the SEL framework posits the importance of children’s 
social  and  emotional  skills  in  their  academic  success  (Jones  and 
Doolittle, 2017), empirical evidence regarding the specific impact of 
these skills among Chinese children in the mid- to late elementary 
school years is sparse. The current study examined the relations of 
coping  strategies  and  CER  to  academic  achievement  goals  and 
academic performance with a sample of mainland Chinese children 
(ages  9–13),  controlling  for  children’s  age  and  gender,  parents’ 
education levels, and family income.

Coping strategies and academic outcomes

Among the three coping strategies, children in our sample used 
active  coping  strategies  (including  problem-focused  coping  and 
positive cognitive restructuring) more frequently than avoidant and 
support-seeking  strategies.  The  findings  provide  support  to  the 
argument that over the course of late childhood and early adolescence, 
developmental  changes  in  coping  strategies  include  greater  self-
reliance (versus seeking support from others) and greater capacity for 
using  cognitive  strategies  to  cope  with  stressful  events  (Zimmer-
Gembeck and Skinner, 2011).

We hypothesized that active coping strategies would be positively 
associated with performance approach goals, mastery approach goals, 
mastery avoidance goals, and academic performance, but negatively 
associated  with  performance  avoidance  goals.  Results  partially 
confirmed the hypotheses. Active coping strategies were positively 
associated with performance approach and mastery avoidance goals, 
but unrelated to the other outcome variables. Our finding is partially 
consistent with Shih’s (2018) finding that active coping strategies were 
positively  associated  with  mastery  avoidance  goals  in  Taiwanese 

In  the  current  study,  Chinese  children  endorsed  performance 
approach and mastery avoidance goals less strongly than the other two 
goals, however, significant positive correlations were found among all 
four achievement goals, which was consistent with previous findings 
that mastery and performance goals are both important to Chinese 
students and positively correlate with each other in this population 
(e.g.,  Shih,  2018).  Among  the  three  coping  strategies,  only  active 
coping strategies were relevant to academic achievement goals. Given 
these  findings,  it  is  unclear  why  active  coping  strategies  were 
associated with two less strongly endorsed academic achievement 
goals, but unrelated to the other two academic achievement goals, 
further study is needed to confirm this finding.

In  addition,  no  association  was  found  between  either 
support-seeking  coping  or  avoidant  coping  strategies  and 
outcome variables. In our sample, Chinese children used support-
seeking coping and avoidant coping strategies significantly less 
frequently than active coping strategies. Given the decreased use 
of support seeking strategies and greater capacity for cognitive 
coping strategies (e.g., more focus on handling the problem than 
avoiding the problem) among older children (Zimmer-Gembeck 
and  Skinner,  2011),  it  is  understandable  that  support-seeking 
coping and avoidant coping strategies were less clearly tied to 
achievement goals than were active coping strategies. It is also 
possible  that  support  seeking  coping  had  positive  impacts  for 
some students and negative impacts for others (as in Vélez et al., 
2016), leading to an overall lack of observed effects. Thus, more 
study is needed to verify these findings and further explore the 
possible mechanisms involved.

Information processing theory posits multiple pathways by which 
emotion impacts learning and motivation. For example, emotions 
(e.g.,  excitement,  frustration,  hopelessness)  can  occupy  space  in 
working memory during the learning process (Pekrun and Stephens, 
2009), and emotions may also distract attention from the learning 
task, reduce the cognitive resources available, and obstruct learning 
performance (Ahmed et al., 2013). Children’s emotions can also have

positive or negative impacts on their motivational processes (e.g., 
motivation  to  learn;  Linnenbrink,  2007).  Since  children’s  social–
emotional skills and strategies influence their emotions (e.g., if a child 
can use a coping strategy to effectively handle a negative feeling from 
a failed test), it could be argued that the associations between coping 
strategies and academic outcomes could be mediated by variables 
such as emotions, working memory, or attention. Since this was the 
first study that examined the specific associations among mainland 
Chinese children, more studies are needed to confirm the results, and 
future studies should also consider including mediation analysis to 
explore the associations further. To shed greater light on the observed 
associations, more understanding of academic achievement goals 
among Chinese children is needed. Future research could examine 
how distinctive the four achievement goal orientations are to Chinese 

children  and  how  they  apply  achievement  goals  in  particular 
academic situations.

Cognitive emotion regulation and 
academic outcomes

The current study suggested that Chinese children used adaptive 
CER (i.e., acceptance, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, and 
putting  into  perspective)  significantly  more  frequently  than 
maladaptive  CER  (i.e.,  self-blame,  other-blame,  rumination,  and 
catastrophizing) with a large effect size. This finding was in line with 
descriptive  statistics  presented  in  previous  studies  involving  both 
Western and Chinese samples (Garnefski and Kraaij, 2007; Liu et al.,

2016); however, none of the studies conducted inferential analyses to 
examine the difference between the usage of adaptive and maladaptive 
CER specifically.

Because few studies have examined the associations between 
CER  and  academic  achievement  goals,  we  examined  these 
relations  in  an  exploratory  manner.  Maladaptive  CER  was 
positively associated with performance approach, performance 
avoidance, and mastery avoidance goals, and adaptive CER was 
positively  associated  with  mastery  approach  goals  but  not 
associated with the other three achievement goal orientations. In 
addition, maladaptive CER was also negatively associated with 
academic  performance.  The  findings  suggested  that  although 
maladaptive CER was not used by Chinese children as often as 
adaptive CER, the more they used maladaptive CER, the more 

likely  they  were  to  care  about  outperforming  others,  avoiding 
appearing incompetent, and avoiding failure to learn, instead of 
mastering the content—the learning itself. By contrast, the more 
Chinese children use adaptive CER, the more likely they were to 
set an achievement goal to master the content. Given that the 
Chinese education system is highly competitive and academic 
performance and success are sources of stress among Chinese 
students  (Zhou  et  al.,  2023),  it  is  possible  that  when  Chinese 
children used maladaptive CER to handle stress from school (e.g., 
thinking that they were stupid, or thinking it was others’ fault), 
they were less likely to set an achievement goal that focused on 
learning  itself,  whereas  when  Chinese  children  used  adaptive 
CER to handle stress (e.g., thinking about learning from it, or 
thinking about what they can do best), they were more likely to 

Frontiers in Psychology

Chen-Bouck et al.

set an achievement goal to master the content and learn better. 
These findings were consistent with a study with Chinese high 
school  students  that  cognitive  reappraisal,  a  form  of  adaptive 
CER, was positively related to learning-oriented motivations (Xu, 
2018).  It  could  be  argued  that  the  current  findings  provided 
support  to  the  argument  that  CER  contributes  to  academic 
outcomes among Chinese children. Taken together, these findings 
were in line with previous studies that maladaptive CER strategies 
were associated with negative developmental outcomes whereas 
adaptive CER strategies were associated with positive outcomes 
(Domaradzka and Fajkowska, 2018; Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006; 
Xu, 2018).

Limitations

There are several limitations in the current study related to 
measurement. First, after the CFAs, due to low factor loadings, 
items were excluded from some of the original measures. Thus, 
it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  underlying  constructs 
included in the current study may not exactly parallel those seen 
in other studies using the same measures. Second, the reliability 
coefficients  were  relatively  low  in  three  achievement  goal 
subscales, although CFA analysis revealed an acceptable model 
fit. Descriptive and preliminary analyses revealed that Chinese 
children endorsed all four achievement goal orientations strongly, 
with a minimum mean subscale score of 4.80 on a 7-point scale 
(i.e., 5 means usually true of me). Additionally, consistent with 
the results of a study involving Taiwanese eighth graders (Shih, 
2018),  all  four  achievement  goal  orientations  were  positively 
correlated with each other in our sample. Therefore, it is possible 
that Western constructs of achievement orientations may operate 
differently  in  the  Chinese  context  and  further  examination  is 
required to understand how distinctive the four achievement goal 
orientations  are  to  Chinese  children.  Third,  the  positive 
refocusing subscale was not included in the measure of CER; thus 
it  is  possible  that  there  are  effects  of  adaptive  CER  driven 
primarily by positive refocusing (i.e., shifting one’s thoughts away 
from stressful events and toward more positive thoughts) that 
would not have been detectable in the current study.

Given the cross-sectional design applied by the current study, 
future studies with experimental designs (e.g., interventions) and 
longitudinal data are needed to further verify the findings and 
examine the impact of coping strategies and CER on academic 
outcomes. Also, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
mechanisms  behind  the  impact,  mediators  (e.g.,  specific 
emotions, working memory, and attention) should be considered. 
For  example,  using  experimental  or  longitudinal  designs  to 
examine the impact of a specific coping or CER strategy (e.g., 
adaptive  CER  strategies)  on  children’s  academic  outcomes. 
Individual differences should also be considered. For example, 
previous research indicates that people who are less emotionally 
aware in general may benefit more from emotion-focused coping 
interventions  (Baker  and  Berenbaum,  2007).  Future  research 
should  examine  how  to  tailor  coping  or  cognitive  emotion 
regulation interventions to individual characteristics. In addition, 
participants were recruited from a large city and the majority of 
them were from middle class families; further studies are needed 

to explore the associations among Chinese children from other 
socioeconomic  statuses  and  settings  (e.g.,  small  cities,  rural 
areas).  Furthermore,  to  understand  how  cultural  factors  may 
influence the use and effectiveness of coping strategies and CER, 
cross-cultural comparison designs should be applied.

Conclusions and implications

Chinese  society  has  gone  through  drastic  changes  in  recent 
decades (Lin et al., 2016). Evidence suggests that while the Chinese 
education system remains highly competitive and academic success is 
still a noted source of stress among Chinese students (Zhou et al., 
2023),  emphasis  has  shifted  from  focusing  mainly  on  children’s 
academic performance to multiple capabilities (e.g., emotional well-
being; Chen-Bouck et al., 2017). Under the contemporary cultural and 
social changes, it is important to understand the possible associations 
between Chinese children’s social–emotional skills and their academic 
outcomes, however, research on these specific relations in mainland 
Chinese settings is limited (Chung et al., 2020). The current study 
provided some preliminary evidence about the possible associations 
between Chinese children’s coping strategies and CER and two aspects 
of their academic outcomes (i.e., academic achievement goals and 
academic performance). The results suggested that among the three 
coping strategies, active coping strategies appeared most relevant to 
Chinese  children’s  academic  achievement  goals.  Regarding  CER, 
maladaptive  CER  and  adaptive  CER  were  relevant  to  different 
academic achievement goals, with adaptive CER associated with goals 
focused on learning itself and maladaptive CER associated with goals 
other than learning. Maladaptive CER was also negatively associated 
with children’s academic performance. However, conclusions about 
whether the associations of active coping strategies and maladaptive 
and adaptive CER with any specific academic achievement goal are 
beneficial  or  detrimental  could  be  premature.  Since  achievement 
orientations may function differently in the Chinese context than in 
Western settings, without additional empirical evidence on academic 
achievement goals and how they function among Chinese children, 
conclusions should not be drawn lightly.

In sum, our findings suggest that to facilitate academic success 
among Chinese children during late childhood to early adolescence 
through the use of age-appropriate and effective social and emotional 
skills, during teaching practice or intervention planning, educators 
may  try  to  focus  on  both  avoiding  or  decreasing  the  use  of 
maladaptive CER strategies and modeling and promoting adaptive 
CER strategies.
