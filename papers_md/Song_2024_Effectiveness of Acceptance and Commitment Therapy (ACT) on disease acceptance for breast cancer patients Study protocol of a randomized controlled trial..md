Abstract

Background

Breast cancer patients face significant psychological challenges, including difficulties in
accepting the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term impact of the disease. Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown promise in enhancing acceptance and psychologi-
cal flexibility in various populations. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ACT
in promoting disease acceptance among breast cancer patients through a randomized con-
trolled trial.

Methods

This study will recruit 90 breast cancer patients and randomly allocate them to an ACT inter-
vention or control group. The ACT intervention, focusing on acceptance, mindfulness, value
clarification, and committed action, will be delivered over 4 weeks. Meanwhile, the control
group will receive standard care with non-therapeutic intervention. The study’s primary out-
come is disease acceptance, while secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, social
support, quality of life (QoL), and psychological inflexibility. Data will be collected at three
points: baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. Statistical analysis will com-
pare outcomes between groups to evaluate the effectiveness and mechanism of this inter-
vention using covariance and mediation analysis.

Discussion

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of ACT in promoting disease acceptance among
breast cancer patients. It hypothesizes that the ACT group will show higher disease

Introduction

Breast cancer is a widespread and impactful health issue that significantly impacts the lives of
numerous women across the globe. By 2020, there will be 2,179,457 new breast cancer cases in
women globally, making up 24% of all new cancer cases in women, predicts the World Health
Organization (WHO). Contrarily, breast cancer has a good prognosis and a protracted survival
period. In some developed regions, the five-year standardized relative survival rate for breast
cancer exceeds 80% [1]. Breast cancer has a high incidence, but its survival rate is generally
more significant than most other cancers, which means that long-term survival rates are
improving. However, most patients’ QoL is poor [2]. In addition to the physical hurdles, breast
cancer frequently leads to significant psychological distress and emotional upheaval among
patients. Malignant tumors are often linked to death in the minds of patients. Patients are
under great psychological stress while dealing with the physical discomfort caused by the con-
dition. Anxiety and despair are common negative emotions [3]. The psychological state of can-
cer patients is influenced by the diagnosis, complications, and treatment side effects [4]. Breast
cancer patients had a greater rate of mental disorders after diagnosis than the general popula-
tion, with 42% meeting rigorous diagnostic criteria for mental disorders within four weeks of
diagnosis, the highest rate of all cancers [5]. Additionally, breast cancer patients are more likely
to experience subclinical psychological problems and symptomatic psychological discomfort,
with frequencies ranging from 30% to 75% [6]. The impact of these psychological problems on
patients’ QoL is profound. Psychological distress can exacerbate physical symptoms, interfere
with treatment adherence, and negatively influence overall well-being and recovery [7]. Anxi-
ety and depression can lead to decreased motivation, social withdrawal, and impaired cogni-
tive functioning in daily activities [8]. Furthermore, negative emotions can strain personal
relationships and support systems, making it more challenging for patients to cope with their
diagnosis and treatment [9]. Therefore, finding ways to enhance the psychological rehabilita-
tion of breast cancer patients is crucial in oncology. Effective psychological support and inter-
ventions are essential to improve the overall QoL and aid in the holistic recovery of breast
cancer patients.

Disease acceptance, which refers to the capacity to recognise and adjust to breast cancer’s
diagnosis, treatment, and long-term consequences, significantly influences patients’ overall
well-being and adaptation [10]. However, many individuals diagnosed with breast cancer
struggle to accept their condition. These difficulties include dealing with the fear of recurrence,
coping with body image changes due to surgery and treatments, managing the side effects of
chemotherapy and radiation, and financial stress [11]. These challenges contribute to
increased emotional distress, reduced QoL, and difficulties in effectively managing their treat-
ment and survivorship. According to a recent study, 20% of breast cancer patients following
mastectomy still struggle to accept their diagnosis [12]. Empirical research on acceptance
intervention found that those who underwent it and were exposed to unpleasant interoceptive

stimuli exhibited less behavioral avoidance, intense dread, cognitive panic symptoms, and cat-
astrophic thoughts [13]. Good acceptance can effectively reduce individual anxiety levels [14].
Furthermore, due to the shift in the modern medical model, breast cancer treatment now
focuses on extending patients’ survival times, lowering mortality, and improving their QoL
[15]. Meanwhile, social support can encourage breast cancer patients to utilize positive coping
strategies, increase their cognitive understanding of the disease, boost their self-esteem, and
improve their QoL [16]. The most important aspect of the adaptation process is accepting the
disease. Better disease acceptance can lead to less stress and higher self-esteem, making adjust-
ing to new health statuses easier. As a result, this study aims to see if boosting illness accep-
tance improves breast cancer patients’ psychological well-being.

In response to the psychological effects of breast cancer, researchers and practitioners have

investigated a range of therapeutic approaches. Studies have shown that psychotherapy may
reduce cancer patients’ psychological suffering, ease their anxiety and sadness, and enhance
their QoL [17]. The development of psycho-oncology has led to increased use of psychological
interventions in breast cancer patients, recognizing the significant impact of mental health on
overall well-being and treatment outcomes [18–20]. Several psychological interventions have
been employed to support breast cancer patients, including cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), supportive-expressive therapy, and psy-
chodynamic therapy. These interventions aim to address various aspects of psychological dis-
tress, such as anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, and body image concerns, thereby
improving patients’ QoL and ability to cope with their diagnosis and treatment [21]. Among
these approaches, ACT stands out.

ACT is a contemporary form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that emphasizes the impor-
tance of psychological flexibility. This flexibility is the ability to fully engage with the present
moment and persist or change behavior in a way that aligns with personal values, even in the
presence of challenging thoughts and feelings. Grounded in Relational Frame Theory (RFT)
[22], ACT incorporates mindfulness and acceptance strategies alongside commitment and
behavior change techniques to help individuals live a more meaningful and value-driven life.
The six core processes of ACT are acceptance, cognitive defusion, being present, self as con-
text, values, and committed action. Together, these processes aim to reduce the influence of
unhelpful thoughts and feelings, enabling individuals to pursue their goals and values more
effectively [23].

ACT has demonstrated feasibility and promise across various contexts for breast cancer
patients. It has shown potential in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in breast can-
cer patients [24]. ACT is also effective in managing fear of cancer recurrence and associated
significant improvements in avoidant coping, anxiety, depression, and QoL [25]. Additionally,
ACT has proven to be an effective intervention for reducing depression and enhancing psy-
chological flexibility among breast cancer patients [26]. Even a single-session ACT interven-
tion has yielded small but positive improvements in postsurgical pain and anxiety, reinforcing
its utility in this population [27]. ACT may enhance disease acceptance by encouraging
patients to accept their negative emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations related to their
cancer diagnosis and treatment, thereby reducing the impact of these negative thoughts and
feelings on their daily lives. By fostering acceptance and mindfulness, ACT helps patients
reframe their perception of the stressors associated with breast cancer, viewing them as man-
ageable aspects of their lives rather than overwhelming threats. Furthermore, ACT emphasizes
identifying personal values and committing to actions consistent with these values, even in the
face of discomfort. This value-driven focus can reduce the perceived burden of the disease and
improve patients’ overall QoL, making it easier for them to accept their condition and its long-

term consequences. By promoting psychological inflexibility, ACT enables patients to adapt
more effectively to their illness, facilitating better disease acceptance and QoL.

In one study, ACT is used to help breast cancer patients feel better about their lives and men-
tal health. Jing Han et al. (2009) showed that ACT intervention effectively enhanced psychologi-
cal inflexibility, disease cognition (including acceptance), and QoL [28]. However, no
randomized controlled trial was carried out to verify the outcomes of this early investigation.
This study aims to close that knowledge gap by conducting an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness
of ACT in improving psychological inflexibility, disease acceptance, and QoL among breast
cancer patients. Specifically, it seeks to provide fresh perspectives on how enhancing acceptance
of the diagnosis through ACT can directly impact the QoL in breast cancer patients. Although
there is strong evidence linking breast cancer patients’ psychological inflexibility, depression,
anxiety, and QoL, the process is still not fully understood [29]. This study aims to investigate
how ACT enhances the QoL in breast cancer patients by examining the potential mediating fac-
tors of psychological inflexibility and disease acceptance. The findings of the mediation analysis
will help establish evidence for the mechanism of action for ACT’s efficacy.

Moreover, social support can encourage patients to use positive coping strategies and

reduce the use of negative ones. A study involving 90 breast cancer patients administered sup-
portive intervention revealed significant improvements in body image, physical and mental
health, and various functions [30]. Therefore, in our study, social support will be a moderator
variable to illustrate the change in illness cognition, psychological inflexibility, depression,
anxiety, and QoL according to ACT intervention, thus further elucidating the mechanism of
change. Overall, the results of the mediation and moderation analysis will contribute to the
advancement of knowledge, the development of novel theories, and the enhancement of ACT
treatment efficacy to patient requirements.

Overall, our study aims to assess the ACT intervention thoroughly, bridge the existing gap
in the literature, and offer evidence-based suggestions for healthcare professionals and clini-
cians who support individuals with breast cancer. Ultimately, our findings have the potential
to guide the development of tailored interventions that enhance disease acceptance, improve
psychological well-being, and contribute to the long-term adjustment and overall QoL for
breast cancer patients.

Randomization and allocation concealment

Permuted block randomization with an allocation ratio of 1:1 is carried out. Participants will
be randomly assigned based on odd (Group A) and even (Group B) rows using a computer-
generated randomisation sequence. The randomization sequence, informing participant
assignment to either intervention (Group A) or waitlist control (Group B) condition, is pro-
vided in opaque envelopes by one investigator not involved in participant recruitment or
assessment. Blinded to the study assignment, participants will be allotted to either group in a
1:1 ratio. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group receiv-
ing ACT intervention or the control group receiving standard treatment with non-therapeutic
intervention.

Blinding

Participants will be unaware of the study’s randomization into the designated groups, which
will be carried out by a research assistant who is not otherwise involved. As a result, partici-
pants will not be informed of the group to which they are allocated.

Additionally, to minimize bias, the ACT intervention group and the control group will
receive a 4-session program (with one hour per session, one session per week for 4 weeks). Par-
ticipants in the control group will also receive equal attention (attentive listening) and time
from the professional figure administering the program with non-therapeutic intervention(the
participants in the control group are given equal duration of the session, number of sessions,
duration of intervention and attended by the same therapists who conducted the ACT group.
The participants will also be attended to with active listening by the therapists in the control
group).

To maintain blinding throughout the study, the researchers will be blinded to participants’
randomized assignments into the groups. This process will be carried out by a research assis-
tant who is not involved in the study. Additionally, data collection for this study will be con-
ducted by the same research assistant, ensuring impartiality. The research assistant will remain
unknown to the study’s hypotheses. Furthermore, data analysis for the study will be performed
by statisticians who are not involved. The statistician will utilize a statistical analysis plan to
conduct data analysis before the final unblinding of the data lock.

Participants

Patients receiving treatment in oncology clinics at Universiti Sains Malaysia and Hospital
Seberang Jaya will be recruited for the study. The criteria for study participation include: (1)
diagnosed with breast cancer, (2) aged 18 years or older, (3) currently receiving treatment, (4)
able to understand and communicate in the study language, and (5) willing to participate in
the intervention and follow-up assessments. Patients are deemed ineligible for the study if
they: (1) have severe cognitive impairment or significant psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., psy-
chosis, substance abuse) that could hinder their participation in the study, (2) are diagnosed
with malignant tumors, and (3) currently receiving any other form of psychological therapy
intervention.

Sample size calculations will be based on power analysis using established effect sizes from
previous studies on ACT interventions and disease acceptance among similar populations. We
conducted an a priori power analysis using GPower 3.1.9.7 to calculate the estimated sample
size needed for mixed ANOVA with control of three covariates: the type I error was 0.05, with
a power of 0.95, three covariates, with two intervention groups and an effect size of 0.46 by
referring to an RCT on the efficacy of ACT on illness cognition among breast cancer patients

[28], Hence, the estimated sample size needed is 80 (with the inclusion of a 20% dropout rate).
Hence, 40 subjects are required per group.

Procedure

This research used a consecutive sampling technique for subject recruitment before randomly
assigning them to the intervention and control groups. Potential participants will first be
screened to determine their eligibility for study participation. Invitations to take part in this
trial will follow. The investigator will ensure that participants receive a thorough explanation
of the study goals and methods before agreeing to join the study. Participants will sign the Sub-
ject Information and Consent Form and Participant’s Material Publication Consent Form
before enrolling in the research to indicate their agreement. We will ensure the participants’
anonymity and inform them about their right to withdraw from the study at any point,
guaranteeing their confidentiality and autonomy. To ensure participants receive similar inter-
vention, the trial adapts a brief ACT module by Shari et al. [31]. The therapist will administer
the intervention when patients are in the hospital for treatment. The assessment batteries will
be issued at three specific time points: before the intervention, immediately after the interven-
tion, and three months following the intervention.

Participants in the control group will receive the non-therapeutic approaches, such as reas-

surance, to allow patients to ventilate their problems and to conduct relaxation techniques
such as deep breathing. The intervention and the control groups will receive a 4-session pro-
gram to ensure ethical considerations and participant access to the intervention. The enrol-
ment, interventions, and assessments of the study are summarized in Fig 1. Fig 2 shows the
flow of the research procedures and outcome measures.

Interventions
ACT intervention

ACT is one of the most representative experiential behavior therapies in the third wave of cog-
nitive and behavior therapy, called “contextual cognitive-behavioral therapy.” ACT aims to
increase psychological flexibility so that people may dedicate themselves to a worthwhile and
meaningful life via flexible therapeutic methods, as well as mindfulness, acceptance, defusion,
self as context, value, and committed action. The interventions include evaluating cognitive
fusion and values, accepting negative emotions and experiences, dissociating from personal
experience, contact with the present and meditation training, determining importance, mak-
ing behavior plans, etc. The ACT intervention is scheduled for 1 session per week for 4 weeks.
Each session lasts for 1 hour. The activities in each session are summarized in Table 1. A
detailed description of the activities in each session is presented in the S1 Appendix.

Control group

The control group participants will receive treatment as usual, including nonspecific and non-
therapeutic approaches such as providing psychological understanding, identifying current
problems, and practising deep breathing exercises. They will receive the same amount of time
and attention from the same therapist as the intervention groups and participate in a one-ses-
sion weekly program for four weeks.

Treatment fidelity

The ACT intervention group will receive therapy administered by a therapist specifically
trained in ACT. This therapist, a PhD student in psychiatry, is not otherwise involved in the

study. They have received training from a licensed clinical psychologist with six years of expe-
rience in practising ACT. To ensure treatment integrity, independent monitoring will be con-
ducted by a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist trained in ACT, who will evaluate the
delivery of interventions by the therapists in the ACT group. About 15% audio recordings of
the psychotherapy sessions will be randomly selected and stratified according to the interven-
tion phase (early, middle, or end). Then, treatment integrity assessments will be performed
using (1) the Drexel University CT/ACT Therapist Adherence and (2) the Competence Rating
Scale for the selected ACT session recording. Each treatment integrity assessor will assess half
of the selected sessions. Then, the inter-rater reliability between the two treatment integrity
assessors is computed to assess the treatment integrity of the therapists who are delivering the
interventions. If the therapist is inconsistent in delivering some sessions, the therapist will dis-
cuss this issue with the principal investigator to solve any shortcomings during the
interventions.

Outcomes

Participants will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires in person or through secure
online platforms. The questionnaires will cover various aspects, including demographic infor-
mation such as age, race, educational background, marital status, and employment position.
Disease-related information, such as the disease stage, current treatment, and other relevant
factors, will also be gathered. Then, we need assessments of the primary and secondary out-
comes. We use the electronic data capture system (EDC) to capture and store the data.

Primary outcome: Disease acceptance

Disease acceptance will be assessed using the Malay version of the Illness Cognition Question-
naire (ICQ-M) for breast cancer patients. Evers created ICQ in 2001, and it assesses disease
cognition from both positive and negative viewpoints, with three dimensions of helplessness,
acceptance, and perception benefit. The better the condition of the related dimensions, the
higher the score [32]. ICQ-M demonstrates strong psychometric properties, making it a reli-
able and acceptable tool for assessing disease acceptance among breast cancer patients. The
ICQ-M exhibited good internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from 0.742
to 0.927, indicating high reliability across its domains. Content validity was evaluated by a
panel of experts who rated the relevance of each item, resulting in high item-level and scale-
level content validity indices (I-CVI and S-CVI), affirming the appropriateness of the ICQ-M
items. Construct validity was supported by factor analysis, which confirmed the structural
integrity of the questionnaire, comprising 17 items distributed across two domains with good
convergent and discriminant validity. Additionally, concurrent validity was evidenced by
moderate correlations with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II), indicating
that the ICQ-M effectively measures the intended constructs in relation to similar tools. The
ICQ-M’s reliability and validity make it suitable for measuring disease acceptance in Malay-
speaking breast cancer patients [33].

Secondary outcome

Psychological distress. To evaluate participants’ levels of anxiety and depression symp-

toms, assessments such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be
employed. The HADS, developed by Zigmond and Snaith, is a screening tool for non-psy-
chotic anxiety and depression symptoms in hospitalized patients. It includes two anxiety and
depression subscales [34]. In this study, we utilized the Malay version of the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS-M), translated by Yahya F. The HADS-M has shown excellent
reliability, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 86.2% for anxiety and a sensitivity of
93.2% and specificity of 90.8% for depression. These figures indicate that the HADS-M is a
highly reliable tool for screening anxiety and depression in the Malaysian population. Addi-
tionally, the HADS-M has been validated in a Malaysian hospital setting and has proven to be
a valid instrument for assessing psychological distress among patients. The scale’s

psychometric properties, including its high sensitivity and specificity, affirm its acceptability
and utility in clinical practice within Malaysia [35].

Quality of life. Physical condition, social and family situation, emotional state, func-
tional condition, and a breast cancer-specific module make up the five dimensions of Func-
tional Assessment of Cancer Therapy– Breast cancer (FACT-B). The FACT-B consists of 37
items: the higher the score, the better the overall survival treatment and the corresponding
dimension [36]. The Malay version of the FACT-B is a reliable and valid tool for assessing
the QoL in Malaysian breast cancer survivors. It demonstrated high internal consistency,
with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 for the overall scale and values ranging from 0.62 to 0.88 for
individual domains. The FACT-B also exhibited strong concurrent validity, as evidenced by
significant correlations with the Disabilities of Arms, Shoulders, and Hands (DASH) ques-
tionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire-Anxiety Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS).
Additionally, the tool detected differences in physical, functional, and QoL measures
between participants with and without lymphedema, confirming its known-group validity.
These strong psychometric properties highlight the FACT-B’s suitability for use in clinical
and research settings to evaluate the impact of breast cancer and its treatment on patients’
well-being in Malaysia [37].

Psychological inflexibility. The AAQ-II assessed psychological inflexibility or experien-

tial avoidance. There are seven items in AAQ-II. A higher AAQ-II score suggests more psy-
chological inflexibility [38]. The Malay version of the AAQ-II has demonstrated strong
psychometric properties, making it a reliable and acceptable tool for assessing psychological
inflexibility among Malay-speaking populations. It exhibited good content validity, reflecting
the relevance and representativeness of its items. The internal consistency was high, with a
Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.91, and the tool also showed excellent parallel reliability. Explor-
atory factor analysis confirmed that the AAQ-II Malay version is a unidimensional instrument.
Adequate concurrent validity was established through significant correlations with other mea-
sures of similar constructs. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity analyses indicated that
the AAQ-II Malay version effectively distinguishes cancer patients with significant psychologi-
cal inflexibility (scores above 17.5) from those without. These findings support the AAQ-II
Malay version’s use in clinical and research settings to measure psychological inflexibility accu-
rately [39].

Social support. The Malay version of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Sup-

port (MSPSS-M) for cancer patients covers three dimensions of social support (Family,
Friends, and Significant Others). The MSPSS-M consists of 12 items, with higher scores indi-
cating greater perceived social support by the patient. The MSPSS-M has demonstrated strong
psychometric properties, making it a reliable and valid tool for assessing perceived social sup-
port among cancer patients in Malaysia. The MSPSS-M exhibited high internal consistency,
with Cronbach’s alpha values ranging from 0.900 to 0.932, indicating excellent reliability. Con-
firmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model of the original English version, con-
firming the construct validity of the MSPSS-M. Additionally, the MSPSS-M showed good
convergent and discriminant validity, ensuring it accurately measures perceived social support
and distinguishes it from unrelated constructs. The tool also demonstrated good content and
face validity, indicating that the items are appropriate, comprehensive, and understandable for
the target population. The MSPSS-M is a reliable and acceptable instrument for clinical and
research settings to assess perceived social support among Malay-speaking cancer patients in
Malaysia [40].

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis

Statistical software for social sciences (SPSS version 27) will be used to conduct data analysis.
The study of sociodemographic data will make use of descriptive statistics. Race, age, marital
status, educational background, work position, and illness state, including the stage at diagno-
sis, chemotherapy regimen, and time since diagnosis, are all described using frequency and
percentage. Before implementing the ACT intervention, inference analysis will examine the
significant differences between the waiting and intervention groups. The study’s primary anal-
ysis will adhere to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Furthermore, the main effect will be
accompanied by a 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance will be determined using a
two-tailed approach and set at p<0.05.

To address any instances of missing data, the approach will be as follows: If missing data
accounts for less than 5% of the total collected data, they will be disregarded. In cases where
missing data exceed 5% but fall below 40% of the total collected data and are assumed to occur
randomly, multiple imputations using restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be con-
ducted using Stata 15. However, if missing data surpass 40% of the total collected data or are
presumed to be non-random or entirely random, only the available data will be utilized for
analysis in the study, and any absence of data will be acknowledged as a limitation in subse-
quent publications of the study’s findings [41].

Mixed ANOVA analysis

The comparison of mean differences before and post-intervention will be examined to see
whether any changes in illness cognition, anxiety, depression, psychological inflexibility, QoL,
and social support among breast cancer patients in response to ACT intervention. Then, while
controlling for confounders, mixed ANCOVA will be used to look at any significant changes
in the measured variables between the waiting and intervention groups, with the group as the
between-group factor and time as the within-group factor. A few confounding factors that
may affect disease acceptance in cancer will be taken into account and controlled by using
mixed ANCOVA, such as the level of pain and fatigue and monthly income [42, 43]. Age is
also included as a covariance.

The effect sizes will be determined to evaluate how much patients’ perceptions of the mea-

sured variables changed with and without an ACT intervention. The formula of Cohen’s d
(Rosnow Rosenthal, 1996) [44] is used to calculate the effect size. According to Cohen (1988),
the effect size will be considered small if (d = 0.2), medium (d = 0.5), and large (d = 0.8).

Mediators and moderators

The mediation analysis will be conducted using the PROCESS macro-Version 3.5 developed
by Andrew F. Hayes. This research uses a single mediator model to examine the total, direct,
and indirect effects. The independent variables will be the groups in the RCT study (ACT
intervention group and control group). At the same time, the dependent outcomes will be the
change scores of illness cognition and QoL from pre-treatment to post-assessment. The change
score is chosen as the dependent variable to assess the improvement of scores between pre-and
post-treatment. Proposed mediator variables include psychological inflexibilities, anxiety,
depression and social support. PROCESS will be used to validate the mediating effect of psy-
chological inflexibility and disease cognition on the relationship between the ACT intervention
and QoL. The Bootstrap program will confirm the direct and indirect effects. Additionally,

PLOS ONEStudy protocol: ACT’s impact on disease acceptance in breast cancer patients—A randomized controlled trial

social support will be introduced as a moderating variable in the coping path to create a final
model that verifies the overall mediating product.

Safety monitoring

Ensuring participant safety is of the utmost importance throughout the study. Therapists deliv-
ering the ACT intervention will undergo training to promptly identify and address any poten-
tial adverse events or reactions that may arise during therapy sessions. In the event of an
adverse incident, participants will have the option to withdraw from the research. Participants
will be actively encouraged to report any concerns or negative experiences related to the inter-
vention. Any negative medical development affecting a trial participant unrelated to the treat-
ment intervention is considered an adverse event (AE). Any unwelcome or unexpected
indications, symptoms, or transient diseases are included, regardless of how they relate to the
experimental intervention.

Participants are strongly advised to regularly contact the research team by phone and

quickly report any adverse events (AEs) they may encounter. Participants will get a study card
with the research team’s contact details. If an adverse event (AE) does take place, it will be
noted in the “Adverse Event” part of the case report form (CRF) for the research, and, if
required, a thorough adverse event report will be created. The name of the AE, its start and
recovery dates, intensity, relevance to the intervention under study, measures done in response
to the intervention, any therapy given, and the result (whether resolved or continuing) are all
included in these reports. At Universiti Sains Malaysia, the Human Research Ethics Commit-
tee will be informed of severe adverse occurrences. The Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be used to monitor the occurrence of adverse effects
among participants.

Data sharing and dissemination

Authorship eligibility will be determined by suggestions made by the International Committee
of Medical Journal Editors. Access to the study’s files for data analysis or publishing is only
allowed for the study’s corresponding author and co-authors. The study findings will be dis-
seminated through various channels to maximize their impact and reach. Data collected from
the survey will be protected and stored securely. Only aggregated and de-identified data will be
reported in publications, ensuring the anonymity of participants. The results will be analyzed
and prepared for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be made at sci-
entific conferences and meetings relevant to breast cancer, psycho-oncology, and psychologi-
cal interventions. In addition, efforts will be made to communicate the findings to appropriate
stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patient advocacy groups, and policymakers,
to inform clinical practice and potential implementation of ACT interventions for breast can-
cer patients. The researchers of this study all state that they have no conflicting financial or
other interests.

Limitations and future research

It is important to recognise certain potential limitations of the study. Firstly, the study design
relies on self-report measures, which are susceptible to response biases. To address this, partic-
ipants will be assured of the confidentiality and anonymity of their responses to encourage
honest reporting. Secondly, the study will be conducted in Eastern Malaysia and may not fully
capture the diverse experiences of breast cancer patients nationwide. Future research should
replicate the findings in larger, more diverse populations to enhance generalizability. Third,
the sample size may be relatively small. However, it is deemed sufficient upon sample size

PLOS ONEStudy protocol: ACT’s impact on disease acceptance in breast cancer patients—A randomized controlled trial

calculation, considering the heterogeneity of the participants and the self-reported measuring
tools used in the study, which may further affect the level of generalisation. Finally, this study
did not assess the survival rate of breast cancer patients as an outcome.

In summary, this study is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and pri-
oritizing participant safety while examining the impact of ACT on disease acceptance among
breast cancer patients.

Discussion

Breast cancer is a significant global health concern affecting numerous individuals. ACT is cru-
cial in fostering disease acceptance and improving QoL among breast cancer patients. This
research protocol uses a randomized controlled design; participants are fairly assigned to
either the ACT intervention or control group, minimizing confounding variables and enhanc-
ing the study’s reliability. We hypothesize that this study could significantly impact treatment
outcomes by showing that ACT increases patient disease acceptance and improves QoL,
potentially making ACT a beneficial addition to traditional medical treatment. This approach
may help patients adjust to their diagnosis and treatment challenges, enhancing their QoL and
treatment adherence. This study will also indicate the mechanism underlying the efficacy of
ACT in improving QoL of breast cancer patients, which may be mediated by illness acceptance
and psychological flexibility, indicating the importance of enhancing these psychological traits.
ACT is one of the psychological treatments that could enhance these traits in cancer patients.
The comprehensive methodology may also act as a methodology framework to allow replica-
tion of this study to evaluate the efficacy of other psychological treatments to enhance the QoL
via psychological inflexibility and disease acceptance.

However, this study’s limitations include a small sample size, which may affect the gener-
alizability of the results, and the risk of bias due to conducting the study within a single nation.
Future research should reproduce this study with a larger and more diverse participant cohort
to improve the generalizability of the findings and provide a more thorough assessment of
ACT’s efficacy.

In conclusion, this research protocol examines how ACT affects disease acceptance and
QoL in breast cancer patients. ACT could be included in routine treatment, improving coping
mechanisms and mental health if effective. Further studies are needed to confirm these results
and explore the long-term impact of ACT on disease acceptance in a broader population.
