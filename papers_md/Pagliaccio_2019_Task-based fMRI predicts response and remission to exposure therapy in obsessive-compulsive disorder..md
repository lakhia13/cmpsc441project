Exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) is an effective first-line
treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but only some
patients achieve minimal symptoms following EX/RP. Herein, we
investigate whether task-based neural activity can predict who
responds best to EX/RP. Unmedicated adult patients with OCD
(n = 36) and healthy participants (n = 33) completed the Simon
Spatial Incompatibility Task during high-resolution, multiband func-
tional MRI (fMRI); patients were then offered twice-weekly EX/RP
(17 sessions). Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify
brain regions where conflict-related activity moderated the slope
of change in Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)
scores across treatment. Conflict-related activity in the left pallidum
and 35 cortical parcels/regions significantly predicted symptom
improvement with EX/RP for patients with OCD (false discovery
rate-corrected P < 0.05). Significant parcels/regions included cingulo-
opercular and default mode network regions, specifically the
anterior insula and anterior and posterior cingulate. Summarizing
across these parcels/regions, greater conflict-related activity pre-
dicted greater EX/RP response and which patients achieved remis-
sion (Y-BOCS score ≤ 12; Cohen’s d = 1.68) with >80% sensitivity
and specificity. The association between brain activity and treatment
response was partially mediated by patient EX/RP adherence
(b = −2.99; 43.61% of total effect; P = 0.02). Brain activity and ad-
herence together were highly predictive of remission. Together, these
findings suggest that cingulo-opercular and default mode regions
typically implicated in task control and introspective processes, re-
spectively, may be targets for novel treatments that augment the
ability of persons with OCD to resolve cognitive conflict and thereby
facilitate adherence to EX/RP, increasing the likelihood of remission.

Identifying predictors of treatment response can elucidate tar-

gets for novel treatment strategies and support personalized
medicine in psychiatry, an approach that can guide individual
patients to treatments that will be most effective for them.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing disorder (1)
that could benefit from this approach. Although cognitive-
behavioral and pharmacological therapies for OCD exist, rates
of remission are relatively low [e.g., 53% in meta-analysis (2)]. One
potential strategy for improving treatment outcomes is to identify
pretreatment neural predictors of treatment outcomes to identify
which patients are likely to respond to particular treatments.

MRI studies have begun to explore predictors of treatment
outcome in OCD. Anterior cingulate thickness (3) and various
patterns of resting state connectivity have been shown to predict
response to cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically exposure
and ritual prevention (EX/RP) (4–8). Task-based functional
MRI (fMRI) can provide insight into specific cognitive processes
that might serve as potential targets in augmenting EX/RP ef-
ficacy. To date, research on task-based fMRI predictors of EX/
RP response has been limited to contamination- or checking-
related image viewing paradigms with either small samples or
nonsignificant treatment prediction (9, 10). Furthermore, these

studies have not addressed effect size or the sensitivity/specificity
of these neural predictors, both clinically relevant questions.

The current study examined task-based fMRI predictors of
EX/RP response in OCD. A first-line treatment for OCD (11),
EX/RP involves patients confronting feared situations to trigger
obsessions (i.e., intrusive thoughts, images, urges) while abstaining
from performing rituals (i.e., repetitive actions aimed at preventing
or reducing distress). EX/RP typically helps up to half of patients
achieve minimal symptoms after treatment (i.e., remission) (12).
Herein, we used the Simon Spatial Incompatibility Task (13),
during which participants indicate the direction that arrow stimuli
are facing, which may be in conflict with their spatial location. This
task requires the engagement of cognitive control to resolve cog-
nitive conflict and ignore this task-irrelevant spatial information,
which elicits increased activity in frontostriatal control circuitry in
healthy individuals (14–17). Many tasks require the engagement of
control processes and the resolution of cognitive conflict, but this
particular task was chosen for 3 reasons: 1) OCD symptoms have
been hypothesized to reflect failures to inhibit/control thoughts and
behaviors (18), consistent with neuropsychological findings of
deficits in cognitive/executive function, including inhibitory control
(19); 2) outcome from EX/RP is hypothesized to rely upon cog-
nitive control (20); and 3) we previously identified altered conflict-
related activity (incongruent > congruent) in frontal-striatal and
insular cortices in adults with OCD performing this task (21),

Significance

The current study uses task-based functional MRI to identify
brain-based predictors of psychotherapy treatment response in
adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Specifically, pa-
tients completed a task requiring the resolution of cognitive
conflict prior to receiving a standard course of cognitive be-
havioral therapy. Activity in a number of critical regions pre-
dicted how much patients improved with therapy. This work
represents a step toward using neural measures for precision
medicine efforts (i.e., to help identify and guide individual
patients to specific treatments from which they are most likely
to benefit).

consistent with other literature of alterations in circuits (e.g.,
frontostriatal, cingulo-opercular)
supporting cognitive control
processes in OCD (e.g., refs. 22–25). Thus, we hypothesized that 1)
relative to matched healthy participants, unmedicated patients with
OCD would show increased conflict-related responses in fronto-
striatal and cingulo-opercular (e.g., insula, anterior cingulate cortex
[ACC]) regions and 2) such activity would predict EX/RP out-
comes. We assessed both response (continuous change in symp-
toms) and remission [categorical posttreatment symptom cutoff
(12, 26)] and estimated clinical significance by calculating the effect
size and sensitivity/specificity of associations between treatment
outcomes and neural activity, summarized across brain regions
using principal components analysis. Finally, as patient treatment
adherence is a known predictor of EX/RP response (27), we ex-
plored the joint predictive power of adherence and activity on re-
mission and adherence as a mediator of the association between
conflict-related activity and treatment response.

Results
Participant Characteristics. Eighty-eight participants (41 healthy
and 47 with OCD) consented to enter the study. Six (3 healthy
and 3 with OCD) did not complete the MRI scan and 13
(5 healthy and 8 with OCD; SI Appendix, Fig. S2) were excluded
from analyses for MRI or task-related issues (e.g., poor accuracy
[n = 2]). Task accuracy was high among all remaining participants
(range = 92.40 to 100%). Demographic, clinical, and behavioral
characteristics of the 69 participants (33 healthy and 36 with
OCD) included in the final analyses are shown in Table 1.

Consistent with the inclusion criteria, patients with OCD
exhibited clinically significant pretreatment OCD symptoms
[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (28): mean
(M) = 24.78, SD = 3.20, range = 19 to 32] and minimal symp-
toms of depression [Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) (29):
M = 6.39, SD = 3.77, range = 0 to 14]. There were no significant
group differences in demographic characteristics, Simon task
performance (including accuracy, average reaction time, and
incongruent-congruent trial reaction time; Table 1), or head

motion during the task (mean frame-wise displacement and
percentage of frames censored for motion).

Treatment Outcomes. Approximately 65% of patients with OCD
completed the full course of EX/RP (23 of 36 completed all
17 sessions; median = 17 sessions, M = 14.81, SD = 4.20, range =
2 to 17). The number of EX/RP sessions was not associated with
any measures of Simon task performance, demographic, or clinical
variables of interest (all P > 0.05). Only 3 patients dropped out
from the study before week 8.

(pre-

In a linear mixed-effects (LME) model (fixed effects marginal:
R2 = 0.42), Y-BOCS scores declined significantly over time
(assessment weeks 0, 4, 8; b = −1.50, t = −8.78, P < 0.001),
reflecting a 1.50 point decrease in symptoms per week across
treatment
to posttreatment Y-BOCS improvement;
mean = 11.88, SD = 7.99), whereas no significant effects of age,
sex, or intelligence quotient (IQ) were observed (all P > 0.05).
Spaghetti plots of Y-BOCS scores across treatment are illus-
trated in SI Appendix, Fig. S3. Seventeen patients achieved re-
mission, operationalized as in prior studies as a posttreatment Y-
BOCS score ≤ 12; this cutoff not only reflects minimal symptoms
after treatment but also predicts good quality of life and adaptive
functioning (12, 26, 30). Demographic, clinical, and behavioral
characteristics of the patients who did versus did not achieve
remission are shown in SI Appendix, Table S1. No measures of
Simon task performance (accuracy or reaction time) predicted
change in Y-BOCS scores as tested in separate models (all
time × performance interaction P > 0.05).

Conflict-Related Neural Activity.
Group differences. No significant group differences in conflict-
related activity between patients with OCD and healthy partici-
pants passed stringent permutation-based correction for multiple
comparisons. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 presents results at a less stringent
threshold, and SI Appendix, Fig. S5 presents unthresholded maps.
Predicting treatment outcomes. In LME model analyses predicting
Y-BOCS scores as a repeated measure, 36 parcels/regions [out
of 374 total atlas parcels/regions tested (31); 29 parcels/regions

No significant group differences in demographic or behavioral characteristics were found (difference: t or χ2
test). Simon task accuracy represents the average percentage of correct responses across runs included in the
neuroimaging analyses (i.e., those not excluded for motion). Similarly, the percentage of frames cut indicates the
average percentage of frames regressed as motion or timeseries outliers, and mean frame-wise displacement
(FD) indicates average head motion only among runs included in analyses. Reaction time (RT) in milliseconds is
presented for the average across all trials and for the difference between incongruent and congruent trials (I-C).
Three participants were missing Wechsler Full-Scale IQ scores; missing scores were replaced with that individual’s
verbal intelligence score on the North American Adult Reading Test to avoid missing data. PEAS mean scores had
a possible range of 1 to 7.

were in the right hemisphere, and 7 were in the left hemisphere;
SI Appendix] showed conflict-related activity × time interactions
passing multiple comparisons correction (all uncorrected P <
0.005, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected P < 0.05; Fig. 1 and
Table 2). None of these regions showed significant main effect
associations with pretreatment Y-BOCS scores (all P > 0.05).
These regions included the right pallidum and cortical parcels
within the bilateral visual cortex, right anterior insula, left an-
terior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right
superior temporal sulcus, right inferior parietal cortex (angular
gyrus), and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). All iden-
tified parcels/regions, except the left entorhinal cortex, showed
negative interaction effects, with greater conflict-related activity
in patients who showed the greatest decline in symptoms during
treatment. Sensitivity analyses using the atlas defined by Gordon
et al. (32) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) and grayordinate-wise analyses
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7) were highly convergent with these results.
Postcongruent conflict contrast associations are presented in SI
Appendix, Fig. S8. In follow-up categorical analyses predicting
remission, similar effects were observed in all parcels/regions and
reached significance in 29 of these 36 parcels/regions (all P <
0.05; Table 2).
Effect size. To characterize effect size in a parsimonious manner, a
principal components analysis was used to reduce/summarize
activity across these 36 parcels/regions. The first principal com-
ponent (PC1) accounted for 38.71% of the variance in conflict-
related activity across these parcels/regions (loadings in SI Ap-
pendix, Table S2) and was used in effect size analyses. While
activity in all 36 parcels/regions loaded positively on PC1, the
strongest loadings were generally observed in the posterior cin-
gulate. As in the main LME analyses, PC1 significantly inter-
acted with time to predict Y-BOCS scores (b = −0.97, B = −0.07,
t = −5.07, P < 0.001; SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Thus, every 0.13 in-
crease in PC1 activity predicted an additional point reduction in
symptoms over the course of treatment. The fixed effects in this
model accounted for a large portion of the variance (marginal
R2 = 58.94%) in Y-BOCS scores.

In a logistic regression, PC1 was also a significant predictor
(z = 2.64, P = 0.008) of remission [operationalized as in prior

studies (12, 26) as a posttreatment Y-BOCS score ≤ 12] such
that a 0.10 increase in conflict-related activity was associated
with 1.55-fold greater odds of remission (95% confidence in-
terval [CI] = 1.12 to 2.15). The difference in PC1 activity be-
tween those who achieved versus did not achieve remission
represented a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.68; Fig. 2A).
Neither the demographic covariates nor baseline Y-BOCS scores
significantly predicted remission (P > 0.05). A receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that PC1 was significantly
better at discriminating patients who would versus would not
achieve remission than baseline Y-BOCS scores alone (area under
the curve = 87.13% vs. 61.03%; P = 0.02). Using a conflict beta
of −0.2 from PC1 (i.e., 0.2% signal change below the mean) as a
cut point yielded 81.2% sensitivity and 82.4% specificity (Fig. 2B).
Treatment adherence. As in prior work, treatment adherence sig-
nificantly predicted posttreatment Y-BOCS scores (b = −8.09,
t = −4.66, P < 0.001), controlling for age, sex, IQ, and baseline
Y-BOCS score (i.e., a 1-unit increase in the Patient EX/RP
Adherence Scale [PEAS] related to an 8-point greater reduction
in Y-BOCS scores with treatment). Additionally, adherence
significantly predicted remission (z = 2.49, P = 0.013) in a logistic
regression controlling for baseline Y-BOCS score, age, sex, and
IQ. Furthermore, adding conflict-related activity in PC1 (z =
2.23, P = 0.025), this logistic regression significantly improved
the prediction of remission above and beyond adherence and
other covariates. This full model showed a better fit (model
Akaike information criterion = 41.11 vs. 33.85, Nagelkerke R2 =
0.50 vs. 0.71, model change χ2 P = 0.002) and greatest predictive
power in ROC analysis (area under the curve = 94.5%).

Finally, in an exploratory analysis, the association between
PC1 and change in Y-BOCS scores (posttreatment Y-BOCS
scores controlling for pretreatment Y-BOCS scores) was par-
tially mediated by patient EX/RP adherence (indirect effect:
b = −2.99, 95% CI = −7.95 to −0.36, P = 0.02; 43.61% of total
effect mediated; SI Appendix, Fig. S10). All paths in this medi-
ation model were significant: PC1 predicted adherence, and
adherence predicted change in Y-BOCS scores. Associations
between conflict-related activity in each of the 36 parcels/regions
and adherence are shown in SI Appendix, Table S2.

Fig. 1. Regions where conflict-related activity predicts treatment response-inflated renderings of the cortical surface (Left and Right, medial and lateral
views) are presented, along with volume space representation. The 36 parcels/regions [from the atlas of Glasser et al. (31) and subcortical Harvard–Oxford
atlas] identified in the main analysis are shown here (blue- and red-filled areas, color scaled by interaction t statistic; also Table 2). Outlines of the full atlas
cortical parcellation are shown on the surface rendering in their original colors. These highlighted cortical parcels and the right pallidum showed significant
conflict-related activity × time (assessment week) interactions in LME models predicting Y-BOCS scores and passed FDR correction for multiple comparisons.
Negative interaction effects are shown in blue and indicate greater activity relating to greater decline in symptoms over time. The single region showing a
positive interaction effect is shown in red (left entorhinal cortex).

The 36 parcels from the atlas of Glasser et al. (31) that showed significant conflict-related activity × time (assessment week) interactions in the LME model
predicting Y-BOCS scores that passed FDR correction are shown here (also Fig. 1). Parcels are identified by a short label, detailed parcel name, and
general brain section/area from the atlas of Glasser et al. (31). Overlap with Brodmann area (BA) parcellations are denoted based on the Human.
Brodmann09.32k_fs_LR.dlabel.nii atlas image (62). Interaction effects (b estimate, t statistic) are displayed. Negative interaction beta values indicate
greater activity relating to a greater decline in symptoms over time. Cohen’s d statistics are presented (Remission d) to indicate the effect size differences
in conflict-related activity between patients with OCD who did versus did not achieve remission after treatment (posttreatment Y-BOCS score ≤ 12).
Positive Cohen’s d statistics indicate that greater conflict-related activity was seen in patients with OCD who did versus did not achieve remission with
treatment. L, left; MT, middle temporal area; R, right. *P < 0.05.

Discussion
This study examined functional neural predictors of response
to EX/RP therapy in unmedicated patients with OCD using a
nonaffective cognitive control task. Using up-to-date acquisition
and processing methods in line with large-scale studies (e.g.,
Human Connectome Project [HCP]), group differences in
conflict-related responses did not withstand rigorous multiple
comparisons correction. However, greater conflict-related ac-
tivity predicted greater EX/RP response in 36 parcels/regions (of
the 374 tested), mainly within cingulo-opercular (e.g., anterior
insula, anterior cingulate) and default mode network (DMN;
e.g., posterior cingulate, angular gyrus) regions, as well as the
DLPFC, pallidum, and areas of visual cortex. Moreover, conflict-
related activity on its own predicted which patients achieved
remission (operationalized as posttreatment Y-BOCS score ≤
12) with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. This increased
even further to nearly complete separation of which patients
achieved versus did not achieve remission when considering conflict-
related activity, treatment adherence, and baseline symptoms as

predictors. Finally, mediation analyses suggested that the association
between brain activity and EX/RP outcome was partially mediated
by patient treatment adherence.

Prior findings from adults with OCD suggest overactivation of
typical DMN regions during nonaffective cognitive tasks (33)
and weakened anticorrelation between the DMN and salience
network compared with healthy adults (34, 35). Using the Simon
task, we previously detected increased conflict-related activity in
the right insula, putamen, and inferior frontal gyrus in a de-
mographically and clinically similar sample of participants with
OCD (21). We did not identify statistically significant group
differences herein, perhaps due to differences in data acquisition
(multiband), processing/analysis (HCP pipeline and Connectivity
Informatics Technology Initiative [CIFTI]-space analyses), or,
most likely, multiple comparisons correction. Recent reports
suggest that standard multiple comparisons corrections may not
have been stringent enough to fully control for false-positive
results (36). An unthresholded map of group differences (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5) shows increased conflict-related activity in

healthy participants (black) and patients who did not (red) or did (blue) achieve remission after EX/RP (based on a criterion of Y-BOCS score ≤ 12). The dashed
black line denotes the −0.2 threshold examined in the ROC analysis and shown in B. (B) Results of the ROC analysis for the logistic regression predicting
remission are also presented. Sensitivity and specificity are presented at different values of PC1 activity (solid blue line) and of baseline YBOCS scores (dashed
green line). The best threshold of −0.2 (0.2% signal change below the mean) is denoted and includes 95% CI markers.

OCD in the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, ACC, and
striatum, albeit of a smaller effect size than observable with the
rigorous correction used here. Nevertheless, extant findings
suggest functional alterations in cingulo-opercular and DMNs
in OCD.

Pretreatment conflict-related activity within cingulo-opercular
and DMN regions significantly predicted EX/RP outcomes.
Specifically, those with more activity were more likely to achieve
remission. Interestingly, most of the identified regions, other
than the anterior insula, fall outside the circuitry typically acti-
vated during the processing of cognitive conflict (37). For ex-
ample, we identified associations with regions of the DMN that
typically exhibit task-related deactivations and are anticorrelated
with task-activated networks in healthy adults (38, 39). Herein,
DMN regions (e.g., PCC, angular gyrus) tended to show expec-
ted task- and conflict-related deactivations (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5). Yet, patients with OCD who showed less deactivation dur-
ing conflict trials (i.e., greater activity indicating less conflict-
related deactivation) responded most to EX/RP therapy. Sup-
pression of the DMN increases as a function of task difficulty
(40), likely representing a way to prioritize task-relevant over
task-irrelevant cognitive processes (e.g., mind-wandering). Thus,
one way to interpret our data is that patients showing less DMN
suppression may require fewer resources/less effort to resolve
cognitive conflict during the Simon task and potentially during
EX/RP (20). Interestingly, meta-analytic findings suggest func-
tional hypoconnectivity between the DMN and task-positive
networks in OCD (41). In addition, EX/RP normalizes hypo-
connectivity between cognitive control and DMN regions (42),
and those prior findings were interpreted as helping patients
move from internally focused intrusive thoughts to externally
focused attentional processes. Together, these findings suggest
DMN function may be a critical marker for EX/RP response.

The PCC is also involved in a number of other functions, in-
cluding having contributions to visual-spatial attention (43). In
addition, meta-analytic findings suggest reduced dorsal ACC, me-
dial prefrontal cortex, DLPFC, and angular gyrus activity during
the engagement of control on inhibitory/cognitive control tasks (44,
45). Thus, our findings might alternatively suggest that patients with
OCD who have more efficient control and visual-spatial attention
respond better to EX/RP. Although plausible, this interpretation is
not supported by our data, as task performance did not predict EX/
RP response and reduced, rather than greater, DLPFC and ACC
activation predicted a better response to EX/RP.

In addition to cingulo-opercular and DMN regions, conflict-
related activity in regions within visual cortices predicted EX/RP
response. Prior data suggest that altered activation of visual areas
during symptom provocation (9) and resting state functional

connectivity within the visual network (6) predict EX/RP response
in OCD. These resting state findings were interpreted in terms of
altered visual attention and increased salience of triggering stimuli
(6). Such findings should be explored in future work.

Passing criteria for statistical significance does not ensure that
a neural signature can be clinically useful; this depends on the
predictor’s effect size and its sensitivity and specificity. Using
principal components analysis to summarize/simplify testing
across the 36 identified parcels/regions, we found a large effect
size for differences in conflict-related activity between patients
who would or would not achieve remission; moreover, this ac-
tivity predicted remission with >80% sensitivity and specificity.
In fact, PC1 activity had more predictive power than baseline
symptom severity alone and helped predict remission over and
above patient adherence, a known predictor of outcomes. Thus,
our findings build on literature examining neural predictors of
EX/RP response in OCD (3–10), highlighting the resolution of
cognitive conflict within cingulo-opercular and DMN regions as
a potential predictor of EX/RP response with large effect size.
Following our hypothesis that greater capacity to resolve
cognitive conflict likely helps patients to adhere to challenging
treatments like EX/RP, we found that adherence mediated
nearly half of the association between pretreatment conflict-
related neural activity and symptom improvement. Importantly,
adherence and conflict-related neural activity, together, were
highly predictive of remission. As conflict-related neural activity
predicted EX/RP response above and beyond adherence, future
work should aim to replicate and extend this work in new sam-
ples using a variety of tasks that probe cognitive control to de-
termine the specificity of these results to spatial conflict and to
examine other potential mediators of the association between
conflict-related activity and EX/RP outcomes.

The current study had several strengths. First, the OCD
sample was free of psychotropic medications and comorbidity,
allowing us to identify regions in which brain activity specifically
predicted changes in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Similar
sampling was achieved in prior studies (21, 46, 47) by recruiting
from the community instead of from clinical practice [where
comorbidity and medication usage are often common (48)].
Nevertheless, the absence of comorbidity in our OCD sample
might limit the generalizability of our findings. Second, this OCD
study used up-to-date methods in line with the HCP, including
CIFTI space analyses, permitting greater spatial precision. Third,
our analyses used an intent-to-treat framework rather than ex-
cluding participants who do not finish treatment and predicted
EX/RP outcomes.

Several limitations should also be noted. First, while larger
than many prior studies, our sample size was still relatively

20350 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1909199116

Pagliaccio et al.

modest, perhaps contributing to nonsignificant group differ-
ences. Second, given current software and multiple comparisons
correction constraints, we focused on parcel-wise analyses; this
could limit identification of clusters smaller than or not falling
within atlas-defined parcels/regions. To mitigate these concerns,
we present results using a different atlas (32) and uncorrected
grayordinate-wise results. Third, because all patients with OCD
received EX/RP, we cannot determine the specificity of these
brain markers to EX/RP versus other interventions. Fourth,
patients were not selected based on specific obsessions/compul-
sions or subtypes of OCD, and thus exhibited a variety of primary
obsessions/compulsions. Future work should aim to replicate and
extend these findings to determine their specificity to EX/RP in
OCD and to specific subtypes of OCD.

In summary, increased conflict-related activity within cingulo-
opercular and DMN parcels/regions predicted better EX/RP
outcomes among unmedicated adults with OCD. Effects were
large and predicted remission with relatively high sensitivity and
specificity. Building on a growing literature examining neural
predictors of EX/RP response in OCD, these results represent
an important step toward targeting treatment plans to specific
patients, while suggesting that improving the capacity to resolve
cognitive conflict may be a target for novel treatments (e.g., ref.
49) to augment the efficacy of EX/RP.

Methods
Participants. Unmedicated adults with OCD and healthy participants
(matched on age, sex, and race/ethnicity) were recruited from the tristate
area surrounding New York City using flyers, internet advertisements, and
word of mouth. OCD diagnoses were determined by clinical interview and
confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (50), administered by trained raters; all
patients also met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition (51) criteria for OCD. Healthy participants had no lifetime Axis-I
disorders. Participants were excluded for MRI contraindications, history of
neurological illness, past seizures, head trauma with loss of consciousness,
pervasive developmental disorder, any current Axis-I diagnosis (other than
OCD or phobias [if secondary] for the OCD group), or an estimated IQ < 80
[per the North American Adult Reading Test (52)]. The Institutional Review
Board of the New York State Psychiatric Institute approved this study. Par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.

Treatment. Patients with OCD received a standardized protocol of EX/RP (53).
The protocol consisted of 17 twice-weekly, 90-min sessions with a clinical
psychologist (2 introductory and 15 exposure sessions) over ∼8 wk. Exposure
sessions included therapist-aided exposures, self-guided exposures assigned as
between-session homework, ritual prevention, and education about relapse
prevention. Study therapists made up to 2 telephone calls (<20 min) to par-
ticipants between sessions to troubleshoot any difficulties with homework.

Clinical Measures. A trained rater assessed participants using the Y-BOCS (28)
and the 17-item HAM-D (29) for OCD and depressive symptom severity, re-
spectively. Assessments occurred pre- (week 0), mid- (week 4), and posttreatment
(week 8). Patient EX/RP homework adherence was assessed by the study
therapist using the PEAS (54) during sessions when homework was reviewed
(sessions 4 to 17). Higher PEAS scores (across-session average) indicated a
greater percentage of completed and quality of assigned homework expo-
sures and success with response prevention (SI Appendix). Full-scale IQ was
assessed in person using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (55).

Task Paradigm. At week 0, participants completed 3 runs of the Simon Spatial
Incompatibility Task (21) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). On each trial, a left- or right-
pointing arrow was displayed on the left or right side of the screen
(1,300 ms) followed by a fixation cross (jittered interstimulus interval: M =
5,681 ms, SD = 997 ms, range = 4,005 to 8,167 ms). Participants completed
3 runs of 44 trials each, yielding a total of 66 stimuli that were “congruent”
(arrow direction and screen position matching) and 66 that were “in-
congruent” (direction and position not matching). Participants were
instructed to quickly indicate the direction of the arrow via a button press (SI
Appendix). Participants achieving <65% accuracy were excluded as in
prior work.

MRI Acquisition. Neuroimaging acquisition (SI Appendix) was adapted from the
HCP (56) for a GE Signa 3-Tesla MR750 scanner. This included high-resolution
T1 and T2 structural images. Three runs of T2*-weighted multiband images
were acquired during the Simon task (repetitition time [TR] = 850 ms,
multiband factor = 6, 2-mm isotropic voxels = 5 min and 24 s per run).

MRI Preprocessing. The HCP pipelines v3.4 (57) were used to preprocess the
imaging data. Briefly, this included gradient unwarping, motion correction,
field map-based distortion correction, brain boundary-based functional-
structural registration, nonlinear registration into MNI152-atlas space, and
grand-mean intensity normalization. First- and second-level analyses were
performed in “grayordinate” space (“91k” CIFTI format: 91,282 grayordi-
nates), which combines cortical surface and subcortical volume representa-
linear
tions, smoothed with a 4-mm Gaussian kernel. First-level general
models were constructed using AFNI v18.0.09, modeling trial types as in prior
work (21). Activity was scaled to be interpretable as percentage of signal
change. The contrast of interest was conflict during incongruent versus
congruent trials; exploratory analyses for other contrasts and additional
details are presented in SI Appendix.

To control for head motion in the first-level models, we regressed out
successive TR pairs with sum frame-wise displacement between them ex-
ceeding 0.2 mm and TRs where >10% of voxels contained timeseries
outliers. Runs with >35% of frames flagged as outliers were excluded. Par-
ticipants with <2 runs of usable data were excluded. The percentage of
frames regressed out (motion or timeseries outliers) on runs included in
analysis for each participant were included as a covariate in all second-
level analyses.

Statistical Analysis.
Participant characteristics. Data analysis was performed in R v3.5.0 (58). Group
differences in participant characteristics were tested using t tests for con-
tinuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables.
Treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes were characterized and examined
both continuously and categorically. First, in a LME model [R lme4 package
(59)] taking an intent-to-treat approach allowing for missing data, all
available Y-BOCS data (repeated measure at weeks 0, 4, and 8) were ex-
amined continuously as the dependent variable with a random effect for
participant and fixed effects for time (i.e., week of assessment), age, sex, and
IQ. There were minimal missing data (missing 7 of 108 potential Y-BOCS
scores). Next, treatment outcome was examined categorically to identify
patients who achieved “remission” with EX/RP, operationalized as a post-
treatment Y-BOCS score ≤ 12, given that this cutoff reflects symptom re-
duction and predicts good quality of life and adaptive functioning (12, 26,
30). This allowed us to examine both change in symptom severity across
treatment as a continuous variable as well as whether patients were
exhibiting minimal symptoms after treatment. These 2 approaches yield
complementary yet different information about clinical outcomes (i.e.,
change in symptoms and end-point symptoms).

Conflict-Related Neural Activity. Two main analyses examined conflict-related
neural activity, testing 1) whole-brain group differences (OCD versus healthy)
in activity and 2) whether activity predicted treatment response in OCD
patients. Follow-up and sensitivity analyses were then performed to confirm
and clarify results from these main analyses, including calculation of effect
size, sensitivity and specificity of the effects, and exploration of treatment
adherence as a potential mediator. These analyses are outlined in the fol-
lowing sections. Data and code can be shared upon request.
Group differences. While recent reports have raised concerns about the
stringency of multiple comparisons correction in fMRI (36), there is no current
consensus about correction of surface-space analyses. Particularly, standard
cluster-based correction methods have not been adapted to the 2-
dimensional spatial structure of CIFTI data. Thus, we tested group differ-
ences in conflict-related activity (difference between incongruent and con-
gruent trials [I-C] contrast) using stringent permutation testing (https://
fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) (60) and threshold-free cluster enhance-
ment (61). The additional details and exploratory analyses examining other
contrasts are provided in SI Appendix.
Predicting treatment outcomes. LME models were used to identify parcels/regions
in which conflict-related activity (I-C contrast) predicted response to treatment.
In follow-up categorical analysis, logistic regressions were used to characterize
which of the significant parcels/regions from the main analysis also predicted
“remission” [operationalized as a posttreatment Y-BOCS score ≤ 12 (30)]. As
there currently is no fMRI software to implement such LME models with CIFTI-
space multiple comparisons correction, we took an approach similar to region-
of-interest analysis but examined the whole brain. Specifically, we examined

360 cortical parcellations [using an atlas previously defined from multimodal
HCP data (31) and outlined in Fig. 1] and 14 subcortical regions (left and right
thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and accum-
bens from the Harvard–Oxford atlas). Then, 374 LME models were run in R
with Y-BOCS scores as a repeated-measure–dependent variable; a random
effect for participant; and fixed effects for age, sex, IQ, percentage of outlier
frames, time (week 0, 4, or 8), mean I-C contrast beta for a given region, and
the interaction between time and that region’s contrast beta. The main
effect of time indicated the slope of Y-BOCS change from pre-, to mid-, to
posttreatment. A main effect of activity would indicate an association with
pretreatment (week 0) Y-BOCS scores. The activity × time interaction was the
predictor of interest, indicating that the slope of change in Y-BOCS scores
over treatment differed as a function of neural response to conflict. This
interaction effect was corrected for multiple comparisons across brain par-
cels/regions using FDR. A sensitivity analysis (SI Appendix) used a different
cortical atlas parcellation (32) to confirm that findings were not specific to
the chosen atlas.
Effect size. To pursue a parsimonious examination of effect size, a principal
components analysis (R stats package: prcomp) was used to reduce di-
mensionality and summarize activity across the parcels/regions identified
above in LME analysis. Scores for PC1 were extracted for each participant,
akin to a mean-centered, weighted average of conflict-related activity across
parcels/regions; this was preferable to, for example, using a simple average
or testing a single exemplar region.

The above LME model was run with PC1 predicting Y-BOCS scores con-
tinuously to characterize the size of this time × activity effect. Next, PC1 was
tested in a logistic regression predicting which patients achieved remission
after EX/RP, controlling for age, sex, IQ, percentage of outlier frames, and
baseline Y-BOCS symptoms. Cohen’s d effect size statistics from linear re-
gression are presented for PC1 and each significant parcel/region (SI Ap-
pendix). Finally, an ROC analysis (R pROC package: roc) was used assess the
specificity and sensitivity of PC1 predicting remission compared with pre-
diction based on baseline Y-BOCS scores.

Treatment adherence. Treatment adherence is among the strongest known
predictors of EX/RP response (27), and adhering to EX/RP (i.e., confronting
anxiety-provoking stimuli while refraining from rituals) likely requires the
engagement of cognitive control. First, we aimed to replicate this prior
finding in a linear regression testing whether treatment adherence pre-
dicted posttreatment Y-BOCS scores, controlling for age, sex, IQ, and base-
line Y-BOCS score. Thus, in exploratory analyses, we tested whether patient
EX/RP adherence (mean PEAS scores) mediated associations between
conflict-related activity (summarized across significant parcels/regions; PC1)
and treatment response (posttreatment Y-BOCS score controlling for pre-
treatment Y-BOCS score). Next, we explored the joint predictive power of
adherence and conflict-related activity. Using a stepwise logistic regression,
a baseline model was tested with adherence predicting remission, control-
ling for baseline Y-BOCS score, age, sex, and IQ. PC1 activity was added in a
second step. The fit of this model was assessed, as well as its predictive
power using ROC analysis. Finally, mediation analyses (R mediation package:
mediate) controlled for age, sex,
IQ, percentage of outlier frames, and
pretreatment Y-BOCS score severity. Additionally, associations between
adherence and conflict-related activity in the 36 significant parcels/regions
were tested in linear regressions.
