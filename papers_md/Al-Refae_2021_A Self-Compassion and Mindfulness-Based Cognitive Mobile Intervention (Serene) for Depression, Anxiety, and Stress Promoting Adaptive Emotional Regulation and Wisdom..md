Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high level
of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to ﬁnd helpful coping mechanisms.
Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for
individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws
from scholarly evidence on the efﬁcacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the
pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as
cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

Methods:
Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and
self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control
group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and
a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels
of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and
subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly
engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were
calculated using Cohen’s d for complete case analyses.

Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized
controlled trial demonstrated signiﬁcant moderate between-group differences for
depressive symptoms (d = −0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate
between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such
that signiﬁcant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and
isolation, and overidentiﬁcation were observed. A

Serene for Depression, Anxiety, Stress

Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of
self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce
depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring
which help reduce overidentiﬁcation with one’s negative emotions. As individuals
rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying
stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies
to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide
one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively
transform their challenges during the pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

In today’s world, individuals are struggling to ﬁnd new ways
to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with other
adversities, COVID-19 has introduced new challenges that have
led to greater shifts in societal and psychological functioning.
For instance, social distancing measures have created a void
and feelings of isolation that have exacerbated pre-existing
subclinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, and chronic stress
among the general population (Dawel et al., 2020; Galea et al.,
2020). Relative to other one-sided adversities, the pandemic
has resulted in a global challenge that we all face together. In
addition to the physiological impact this pandemic has created,
it has also resulted in an underlying rise in mental health
challenges. With the rise in pharmacological interventions to
tackle these issues, many researchers have begun to also explore
psychosocial measures that can reduce one’s distress. Finding new
ways to eﬀectively manage one’s stressors during the pandemic
can help alleviate psychological symptoms and improve one’s
overall well-being.

increases

signiﬁcant

Due to the ongoing pandemic, a need for technologically
assisted interventions has increased. Multiple interventions
that promote self-compassion show considerable promise
for the treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression. One
recent meta-analysis looked at multiple self-compassion-based
interventions on various outcome measures and found evidence
for
in self-compassion, mindfulness,
and well-being and decreases in depression, anxiety, and
psychological distress (Kirby et al., 2017). Wahbeh et al. (2014)
also found individuals signiﬁcantly preferred internet-delivered
mindfulness interventions over in-person group or individual
mindfulness meditation interventions. Therefore, in the face of
the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, a tool that incorporates
these practices may supersede previous practices and strategies
that individuals had relied on but can no longer engage in (e.g.,
in-person, group-based support).

Self-compassion is considered the antithesis of some of
the consequences of stress, anxiety, and depression. It is a
multidimensional construct that includes self-kindness (having
greater self-understanding and kindness to oneself in moments
of distress), common humanity (a perception of one’s experiences
as being part of the larger human condition), and mindfulness (a

balanced and present awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, and
body sensations while not overidentifying with them). Through
self-compassion, individuals can achieve greater understanding
of their experiences and suﬀering and can therefore be more
willing to move beyond them (Neﬀ, 2003a). For instance, Neﬀ
(2003a) believes self-compassion can reduce feelings of isolation
and promote the engagement in adaptive coping mechanisms.
One meta-analysis by MacBeth and Gumley (2012) found
self-compassion can signiﬁcantly decrease symptoms of stress,
anxiety, and depression. Self-compassion can also act as a
protective factor against psychosocial stress, which is inﬂuenced
by how individuals cognitively appraise their stressors (Breines
et al., 2015; Bluth et al., 2016). Neﬀ et al. (2007) also found
self-compassion may act as a protective factor against feelings of
anxiety that arise in the face of a stressor, even while accounting
for diﬀering levels of self-esteem. In the face of the pandemic,
self-compassion may be a critical ingredient in dealing with the
stress, panic, and resulting depression one may experience (Zeller
et al., 2015). Linardon (2020) suggests self-compassion and
mindfulness may be promoted through cost-eﬀective, mobile-
based technological means and that they may oﬀer relief from
psychological distress. Therefore, a smartphone-mobile app that
oﬀers an avenue to develop a self-compassionate stance may help
improve clinical outcomes.

Allen and Leary (2010) also explain how self-compassion
the ability to deal with stressors
can aﬀord individuals
eﬀectively through cognitive reappraisal, an adaptive form of
emotional regulation. Adaptive emotion regulation strategies
allow individuals to cope with their unwanted negative emotions
without suppressing or ignoring them (Bridges et al., 2004;
Grawe, 2007; Glück, 2021). Cognitive reappraisal (a process
conducted in cognitive restructuring) is the ability to reframe
a stressful or upsetting situation in a more positive manner by
having an open attitude while engaging in positive thinking. Self-
compassion, in of itself, results in the ability to not overidentify
with one’s negative emotions (a component of this cognitive
process). Multiple studies have tested this notion and found
a role for self-compassion in reducing one’s focus on negative
emotions and thoughts (Neﬀ et al., 2005; Leary et al., 2007). Leary
et al. (2007) additionally found individuals can take responsibility
for the negative circumstances that have occurred while not
overidentifying with the negative aﬀect that is experienced. Many

current available apps do not employ explicit cognitive behavioral
strategies. A review by Wasil et al. (2019) on the current
inclusion of evidence-based therapeutic measures for depression
and anxiety has demonstrated a lack of these components
(cognitive restructuring and problem-solving mechanisms) in
current mental health apps.

Neﬀ et al. (2007) also found self-compassion may reduce
self-criticism and rumination, two factors that play a role in
maintaining depressive and anxiety symptoms. Zhang et al.
(2019) similarly found self-compassion mediated the relationship
between self-criticism and depressive symptoms. A recent study
by Xu et al. (2020) also examined the role of cognitive
reappraisal
in predicting the relationship between perceived
stress and anxiety symptoms in individuals who were isolated
during COVID-19. They found this emotion regulation strategy
signiﬁcantly moderated the relationship between perceived stress
and anxiety symptoms. Another study by Diedrich et al. (2016)
found participants who engaged in self-compassion practices
prior to the use of explicit cognitive restructuring had greater
improvements in depression. Fortuna and Vallejo (2015) explain
how engaging in mindfulness and self-compassionate practices
may facilitate the cognitive restructuring process in the context
of traumatic and upsetting situations. The authors also describe
how both mindfulness and cognitive restructuring, in the context
of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), together foster
resiliency in the face of adversity to promote faster recovery
(Fortuna and Vallejo, 2015). Therefore, the integration of self-
compassionate techniques with explicit cognitive restructuring
may provide additive beneﬁts toward improving anxiety and
depressive symptoms and promoting resilience in the face
of stressors.

Wisdom, a closely related construct is also construed as a
multidimensional trait. It includes the ability to make appropriate
social decisions in complex situations, exhibiting greater impulse
control and emotional regulation, and demonstrating prosocial
behaviors such as compassion and empathy. Wisdom also
encompasses the ability to see reality clearly which entails
increased self-awareness and deep insight into one’s mind and self
(Ardelt, 2003; Bangen et al., 2013). Practicing self-compassion
also helps promote wisdom. Neﬀ argues that self-compassion
includes forgiveness, loving, and acceptance of the self despite
ﬂaws which can be construed as a form of “emotional [or
aﬀective] wisdom” (Neﬀ, 2003b; Germer and Siegel, 2012).
Studies have demonstrated the link between self-compassion and
reﬂective and aﬀective wisdom (Ardelt, 2003; Neﬀ et al., 2007).
Previous studies have also found an association between self-
compassion and wisdom and their link to improved well-being
and greater life satisfaction (Ardelt, 1997, 2000; Neﬀ, 2003b;
Ardelt and Jeste, 2018). Glück et al. (2019) also found wiser
individuals presented with higher levels of openness, reﬂectivity,
empathy, and emotional regulation. Therefore, wiser individuals
may be able to deal with the current pandemic’s stressors and
other pre-existing challenges more eﬀectively.

The purpose of this study was to test the eﬃcacy of a
wellness smartphone application (Serene) on measures of stress,
depression, anxiety, self-compassion, well-being, and wisdom.
Speciﬁcally, this study examined whether various mindfulness

meditations and a cognitive restructuring task (which requires
the development of an action plan and incorporation of emotion-
focused and problem-focused coping mechanisms) will inﬂuence
these outcomes (see Lazarus and Folkman, 1984 for more
on coping mechanisms). We hypothesized there would be a
direct improvement on the well-being, stress, depression, and
anxiety measures as well as an increase in self-compassion and
wisdom scores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants
Participants who were 18 years old and above were eligible to
participate in the study. Participants were required to be residents
of Canada and to own an iPhone with iOS 13+. No exclusions
based on diagnosis with any disorder was used. No exclusions
based on current engagement with any mindfulness practices or
any other treatments were also used.

Table 1 demonstrates the sample’s characteristics for the
complete case analyses. Participants ranged in age from 18-66
years (Mean Age = 25.24, SD = 8.74). Most participants were
female in the intervention group (80.8%) and waitlist control
(WL) condition (77.0%). Most individuals in both conditions
also self-identiﬁed as White (43.6% in Serene, 31.0% in WL),
followed by individuals identifying as East and South Asian. Most
participants were current university students (35.9% in Serene
and 41% in WL) or had completed an undergraduate degree
(28.2% in Serene and 33.3% in WL). The current employment
status varied: 32.1% of participants in Serene and 42.5% of
participants in the WL were unemployed students. 23.1% of
participants in Serene and 20.7% of participants in the WL
were employed full-time. Among the current sample, only a few
participants were unemployed non-students (4.8%).

Almost 25% of the sample had a diagnosis with a mental
health disorder. The majority were diagnosed with generalized
anxiety disorder (14.1% in Serene, 13.8% in WL) and depression
(16.7% in Serene, 9.2% in WL). Only 9.7% of
the whole
sample (38.0% of those who had any diagnosis) were taking
medications for their mental health disorders while 14.5%
were receiving treatment
for their mental health disorder
from the whole sample (57.14% from those who self-identiﬁed
with any diagnosis). These medications included stimulants,
antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), benzodiazepines,
and antipsychotics. Treatments used included traditional face-to-
face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), internet-delivered CBT,
psychoanalytic psychotherapy,
individual
counseling, and other forms of therapy.

family counseling,

Only 7.3% of the sample were regular practitioners or had
great knowledge of mindfulness or other forms of meditation at
the beginning of the study. 22.4% had never practiced or heard
of mindfulness or meditations while about 69% had engaged in
some mindfulness or meditative practice or had knowledge about
it. Moreover, 37.2% of participants in the intervention group
and 23.0% of participants in the waitlist control condition were
engaging in these practices at the beginning of the study.

sounds were also used as an informal/unguided meditative
method. Many of these methods align with trauma-informed
mindfulness practices. According to Treleaven (2018) and Crews
et al. (2016), focusing one’s attention on the breath and internal
experience may trigger trauma-related symptoms or emotional
distress that may be uncomfortable for the individual. Therefore,
the music/nature sound section was included to be used as a way
for users to focus on the sounds as opposed to the breath. Many
of the included mindfulness meditations also included a waterfall
sound in the background. Moreover, mindful meditations
that shift the focus on physical activity or awareness to one’s
scenery as opposed to the breath (e.g., mindful walking) were
also included as they have been proven to be as eﬀective as
mindfulness meditations that focus on the breath (Taylor et al.,
2020).

The cognitive restructuring task was adapted from two
evidence-based therapies, cognitive behavioral
therapy and
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Cognitive restructuring
involves
the identiﬁcation and modiﬁcation of unhelpful
thoughts or beliefs underlying one’s feelings and developing and
applying actions plans to modify one’s behaviors. Combining
it with mindfulness and self-compassion practices promotes
greater awareness of the processes that maintain these habitual
patterns of unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. Developing greater
awareness helps individuals observe their distressing situation
from a more balanced perspective, thereby allowing them to
reframe these unhelpful thoughts or feelings more eﬀectively
(Segal et al., 2013; Fortuna and Vallejo, 2015). Step 1 of this task
involved identifying a situation or an unwanted thought that may
be upsetting or uncomfortable. Step 2 involved identifying the
associated strongest feeling with the situation. Step 3 involved
identifying the thought that is most strongly related to the feeling
and situation (e.g., sadness/depression or guilt/shame). Examples
were provided for each of these feelings as well. Step 4 involved
identifying evidence for and against the thought patterns. Step 5
involved evaluating the evidence to identify whether there was
suﬃcient, partial or no evidence to these thoughts. Based on the
selected evaluation, individuals were guided to engage in various
next steps. If an individual found no evidence for the thought,
they were invited to ﬁnd alternative ways of thinking or looking
at the situation. They were also invited to form an action plan to
cope with any emotional distress that may arise from the situation
or unwanted thoughts. If there was partial or full support for the

thought, individuals were also invited to form an action plan on
how to deal with their upsetting emotions or unwanted thoughts.
They were also invited to develop a plan to address the situation
(e.g., engaging in a healthy coping mechanism or planning steps
to directly address the situation). The app also provided a brief
card with these questions with a breathing exercise to be used
informally. This feature was only unlocked once individuals
engaged in at least 1 formal cognitive restructuring task.

In the journaling section, individuals were prompted to rate
their current mood using an Emoji scale. They were invited to
record their current progress (e.g., their progress on an action
plan) or to note down any current thoughts or feelings about their
current state.

Measures
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21, Lovibond
and Lovibond, 1995b) is a 21-item measure used to assess
levels of stress, anxiety and depression on a seven-point Likert
scale. It is divided into three subscales that measure: depression
(e.g., “I felt that I had nothing to look forward to”), anxiety
(e.g., “I was worried about situations in which I might panic
and make a fool of myself ”), and stress (e.g., “I found myself
getting agitated”). Total scores for each subscale are calculated by
computing a mean of all items on each subscale and multiplying
the score by 2. Antony et al. (1998), Henry and Crawford (2005)
and Lovibond and Lovibond (1995a) reported an acceptable
internal consistency reliability (α = 0.82–0.97) for this scale in
both clinical and non-clinical samples. For the current sample
the internal reliability was acceptable at baseline for the stress
subscale (α = 0.80), anxiety subscale (α = 0.81), and depression
subscale (α = 0.87). The internal reliability was also acceptable
at the end of the study for the stress subscale (α = 0.88), anxiety
subscale (α = 0.86), and depression subscale (α = 0.92).

Wisdom
The San-Diego Wisdom scale (SD-WISE; Thomas et al., 2019) is
a 24-item measure used to assess levels of wisdom based on its
neurobiological model on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. It is further
divided into six subscales that measure: social advising (e.g., “I
am good at perceiving how others are feeling”), decisiveness (e.g.,
“I have trouble making decisions”—reverse scored), emotional
regulation (e.g., “I am able to recover well from emotional
stress”), insight (e.g., “ I take time to reﬂect on my thoughts”),
prosocial behavior (e.g., “I treat others the way I would like to
be treated”), and tolerance for divergent values (e.g., “ I enjoy
learning things about other cultures”). Total wisdom scores and
subscale scores are calculated by summing the scores of the items.
Thomas et al. (2019) found that the internal reliability (α = 0.72)
for this scale is acceptable. For the current sample the internal
reliability was acceptable at baseline for the total wisdom score (α
= 0.80), social advising subscale (α = 0.67), decisiveness subscale
(α = 0.80), emotional regulation subscale (α = 0.69), insight
subscale (α = 0.74) and tolerance for divergent values subscale
(α = 0.66). For the prosocial behavior subscale, Cronbach’s alpha
was 0.45. The internal reliability was also acceptable at the end of
the study for the total wisdom score (α = 0.81), social advising

subscale (α = 0.67), decisiveness subscale (α = 0.80), emotional
regulation subscale (α = 0.69), insight subscale (α = 0.77),
and tolerance for divergent values subscale (α = 0.61). For the
prosocial behavior subscale, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.48.

The 12-item Abbreviated Three-Dimensional Wisdom scale
(3D-WS-12; Thomas et al., 2017) is a measure that is also used
to assess levels of wisdom on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. Items on
this scale measure levels of aﬀective wisdom (e.g., “Sometimes I
feel a real compassion for everyone”—reverse scored), reﬂective
wisdom (e.g., “Sometimes I get so charged up emotionally
that I am unable to consider many ways of dealing with my
problems”) and cognitive wisdom (e.g., “I try to anticipate and
avoid situations where there is a likely chance I will have to
think in depth about something”). Total scores are calculated
by computing a mean of all items on the scale. Thomas et al.
(2017) found that the internal reliability for this scale (α = 0.73)
is acceptable. For the current sample, the internal reliability was
acceptable at baseline for this scale (α = 0.73). The internal
reliability was also acceptable at the end of the study for this scale
(α = 0.65).

Psychological Well-Being
The Psychological Well-being scale (Ryﬀ and Keyes, 1995) is
an 18-item measure used to assess levels of psychological well-
being on a seven-point Likert scale. It is further divided into six
subscales that measure: personal growth (e.g., “For me, life has
been a continuous process of learning, changing, and growth),
purpose in life (e.g., “Some people wander aimlessly through life,
but I am not one of them”) positive relations with others (e.g.,
“Maintaining close relationships has been diﬃcult and frustrating
for me”—reverse scored), self-acceptance (e.g., “When I look
at the story of my life, I am pleased with how things have
turned out so far”), environmental mastery (e.g., “In general,
I feel I am in charge of the situation in which I live”), and
autonomy (e.g., “I have conﬁdence in my own opinions, even
if they are diﬀerent from the way most other people think”).
Subscale scores are calculated by computing a sum of each of
the items on their respective subscales. Ryﬀ and Keyes (1995)
reported scores between α = 0.33–0.56 for the internal reliability
of the six subscales. For the current sample the internal reliability
was acceptable at baseline for the autonomy subscale (α = 0.69),
environmental mastery subscale (α = 0.60), and self-acceptance
subscale (α = 0.68). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.59 for the personal
growth subscale, 0.57 for the positive relations with others
subscale, and 0.50 for the purpose in life subscale. The internal
reliability was also acceptable at the end of the study for the
autonomy subscale (α = 0.63), environmental mastery subscale
(α = 0.62), positive relations with others subscale (α = 0.62),
and self-acceptance subscale (α = 0.73). Cronbach’s alpha for the
personal growth subscale was 0.55 and 0.47 for the purpose in
life subscale.

Self-Compassion
The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neﬀ, 2003b) is a 26-item
measure used to assesses levels of self-compassion on a ﬁve-
point Likert scale. It is further divided into six subscales that
measure: self-kindness (e.g., “I try to be loving toward myself

when I’m feeling emotional pain”), self-judgment (e.g., “I can
be a bit cold-hearted toward myself when I’m experiencing
suﬀering.”), common humanity (e.g., “When I’m down and
out, I remind myself that there are lots of other people in
the world feeling like I am”),
isolation (e.g., “When I fail
at something that’s important to me, I tend to feel alone in
my failure”), mindfulness (e.g., “When something upsets me
I try to keep my emotions in balance”), and over-identiﬁed
(e.g., “When something upsets me I get carried away with my
feelings”). Total self-compassion scores are calculated by reverse
scoring the negative subscale items (self-judgement, isolation,
over-identiﬁed), calculating scores on the positive subscales (self-
kindness, common humanity, mindfulness), and then ﬁnally
calculating the mean of all these subscales. To calculate scores
for each subscale, a mean is computed without reverse scoring
any of the items. Neﬀ (2003b) found that the internal reliability
(α = 0.90) and test–retest consistency (0.93) coeﬃcients for the
self-compassion scale are acceptable. The internal reliability for
the current sample was acceptable at baseline for the total self-
compassion score (α = 0.91), self-kindness subscale (α = 0.84),
self-judgment subscale (α = 0.80), common humanity subscale
(α = 0.74), isolation subscale (α = 0.75), mindfulness subscale
(α = 0.69), and over-identiﬁed subscale (α = 0.71). The internal
reliability was also acceptable at the end of the study for the
total self-compassion score (α = 0.92), self-kindness subscale (α
= 0.82), self-judgment subscale (α = 0.87), common humanity
subscale (α = 0.80), isolation subscale (α = 0.79), mindfulness
subscale (α = 0.68), and over-identiﬁed subscale (α = 0.79).

Subjective Well-Being
Participants were asked to rate whether engaging in a component
of the app helped improve their overall well-being (e.g., use of
the mindfulness meditations has helped you improve your overall
well-being) by indicating a Yes or No.

Engagement
Participants were asked to indicate whether they engaged
in mindfulness meditations daily. They were also asked to
indicate the amount of mindfulness meditations they engaged in.
Participants were also asked to indicate the amount of cognitive
restructuring tasks they engaged in (and whether they were new
tasks or revisiting an old task), journaling tasks they engaged in,
and nature or music sounds they played. Moreover, they were
asked to indicate whether they started one of these tasks and
ended them and to indicate the reason for doing so.

Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0. Little’s
MCAR test was used to analyze patterns of missing data (Little,
1988). The results were consistent with the data being missing
completely at random. Due to the size of missing data, we chose
to perform a complete case analysis which produces unbiased
results compared to the multiple imputation method when the
size of missing data is large (Mukaka et al., 2016). The normality
and homogeneity of the data were tested and conﬁrmed by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-wilk tests and by observing
the Q-Q plots and considering both skewness of the data and

kurtosis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Welch’s
t-test was used to compare mean scores on the measures at
baseline between the intervention and wait-list control groups.
Complete case analysis was performed using General Linear
Models (GLM) repeated measures with time x group interactions
to assess changes in the intervention and control group from
baseline to post-study. Pearson correlations were used to assess
correlations within these repeated measures. Together with the
pooled standard deviation and mean diﬀerences, within and
between group eﬀect sizes at post treatment (Cohen’s d) were
computed for the complete case analyses (Cohen, 1977). In
the case where normality assumptions were not met, non-
parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests were used to compare mean
diﬀerences across the intervention and control group. A non-
parametric Friedman test was also used to assesses within-group
(intervention) diﬀerences where no between-group diﬀerences
were found for some of the measures. Cohen’s d was also
calculated for these analyses.

RESULTS

Engagement With the App (Serene)
Table 2 presents the levels of engagement with the app. On
average, participants in the intervention group engaged in 5
meditations a week. Cognitive restructuring was used by 34.8%
of the sample in week 1, 17.4–18.4% in weeks 2 and 3, and by
8.7% of participants in the intervention group. Journaling was
practiced by 40.6% of participants the intervention group at the
end of the ﬁrst week, followed by 31.9% engagement in week 2
and 21.7–23.2% in the last 2 weeks. On average, nature sounds
and the music playlists were used once a week across all weeks.

Effectiveness of Intervention (Serene)
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
The normality and homogeneity assumptions for stress, anxiety
and depression were not met. Therefore, the non-parametric

Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare between-group
diﬀerences in stress, anxiety, and depression from baseline to
4 weeks. No signiﬁcant baseline diﬀerences were found across
all three measures using one-way ANOVA. Findings for the
depression measure revealed a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the intervention vs. control group at the end of study
using the Mann–Whitney U-test, p < 0.05, d = −0.43, 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.71, –0.16] (Table 3). Findings for
the stress measure revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
stress scores in the intervention vs. control group at the end
of study using the Mann–Whitney U-test, p < 0.01. Eﬀect
size calculations revealed no statistically signiﬁcant between-
group diﬀerences for stress, d = −0.25, 95% conﬁdence interval
[CI: −0.52, 0.03] (Table 3). A non-parametric Friedman test
within the intervention group using Bonferroni correction
revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in stress symptoms, p < 0.001,
dRepeated Measures = −0.52, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.86,
−0.18] at the end of the 4 weeks. Baseline scores indicated a
mean level of mild stress levels. Mean levels post-intervention
were normal for stress within the intervention group.

The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was used to
compare between-group diﬀerences in anxiety from baseline to
4 weeks. Results revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between anxiety scores in the intervention vs. control group
at the end of study, p > 0.05, d = −0.15, 95% conﬁdence
interval [CI: −0.41, 0.11] (Table 3). A non-parametric Friedman
test within the intervention group using Bonferroni correction
revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in anxiety symptoms, p < 0.001,
dRepeated Measures = −0.47, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.95,
−0.26] at the end of the 4 weeks. Baseline scores indicated a mean
level of moderate anxiety levels. Mean levels post-intervention
were mild for anxiety within the intervention group.

Self-Compassion
The normality and homogeneity assumptions for the self-
compassion total score and subscale measures were met.

Therefore, complete case analysis using GLM repeated measures
with time x group interactions were conducted for the total self-
compassion score and subscale scores. No signiﬁcant baseline
diﬀerences were found across these measures using one-way
ANOVA. Findings for the total self-compassion score indicated
a signiﬁcant time x group interaction, p < 0.001, d = 0.60, 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI: 0.34, 0.85], such that the Serene group
reported signiﬁcantly greater improvements in self-compassion
than the waitlist control group (Tables 3, 4).

Findings for the positive subscales indicated a signiﬁcant time
x group interaction on self-kindness, p = 0.003, d = 0.42, 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI: 0.14, 0.70], common humanity, p <
0.001, d = 0.58, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI: 0.30, 0.87], and
mindfulness, p = 0.001, d = 0.49, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI:
0.18, 0.79], such that the Serene group reported signiﬁcantly
greater improvements in self-kindness, common humanity and
mindfulness than the waitlist control group (Tables 3, 4).
Findings for the negative subscales indicated a signiﬁcant time
x group interaction on self-judgement, p = 0.002, d = −0.44,
95% conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.74, −0.15], isolation, p = 0.008,
d = −0.38, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.67, −0.10], and the
overidentiﬁed subscale, p = 0.006, d = −0.37, 95% conﬁdence
interval [CI: −0.64, −0.10], such that the Serene group reported
signiﬁcantly greater decreases in self-judgment, isolation and
overidentiﬁcation than the waitlist control group (Tables 3, 4).

were met. Therefore, a complete case analysis using GLM
repeated measures with a time × group interaction was
conducted. No signiﬁcant baseline diﬀerences were found across
this measure using one-way ANOVA. Findings for the 3D-WS-12
measure indicated no signiﬁcant time interaction, p = 0.23 and
no signiﬁcant time x group interaction, p = 0.17, d = 0.16, 95%

SD-WISE
The normality and homogeneity assumptions for the total
score for this measure were met. These assumptions were also
met for the decisiveness and emotional regulation subscales
only. Therefore, complete case analyses using GLM repeated
measures with time × group interactions were conducted
for the total wisdom score and the two subscale measures
that met these assumptions. No signiﬁcant baseline diﬀerences
were found across these measures using one-way ANOVA.
Findings for the total wisdom score indicated no signiﬁcant

ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences at baseline scores on
the purpose in life measure. Therefore, complete case analyses
using GLM repeated measures with time x group interactions

(Tables 3, 4).

The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was used to
compare between-group diﬀerences in personal growth from
baseline to 4 weeks. Results revealed no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between personal growth scores in the intervention
vs. control group at the end of study, p = 0.73, d = 0.27, 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI: −0.0036, 0.55] (Table 3).

Subjective Well-Being
Table 5 presents the results for subjective well-being scores for
each task in the app. Almost all participants (95.6%) from the
complete case analysis had engaged in at least one mindfulness
meditation throughout the study. Of those participants, 84.8%
indicated they believed engaging in this practice helped improve
their overall well-being. About half of the participants (53.6%)
performed at least 1 cognitive restructuring task throughout the
study. Of those participants, 70.3% believed engaging in this
task helped improve their overall well-being. Journaling was
used by 47.82% of the participants. 72.7% of those participants
believed journaling had improved their overall subjective well-
being. 65.2% of participants listened to either the music or nature
sounds and 68.9% of those participants believed engaging in these
tasks helped improve their overall well-being.

DISCUSSION

Findings from the current study indicate individuals who
engaged in Serene for 4 weeks demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases
in depression compared to the waitlist control condition. In
addition to these decreases in clinical outcomes, signiﬁcant
increases in self-compassion (i.e., improvements in self-kindness,
common humanity, and mindfulness and decreases in self-
judgement, isolation and overidentiﬁcation with one’s negative
emotions), emotional regulation and decisiveness were observed.

Moderate between-group eﬀect sizes were observed across all
these measures except for emotional regulation (d = 0.28).
A previous study by Mak et al. (2018) found apps that
employ self-compassion and cognitive behavioral techniques
can signiﬁcantly reduce psychological distress. Moreover, the
reported eﬀects from the current study are in line with
the eﬃcacy of current mobile-based interventions that use
similar techniques. For instance, a meta-analysis by Firth
et al.
found a moderate eﬀect size in reducing
symptoms of depression through various mobile apps that
employed cognitive behavioral and mindfulness meditation
techniques (g2=0.38). Van Dam et al. (2014) also tested the
change processes involved in predicting signiﬁcant changes
in depression through a mindfulness and self-compassion-
based program and found reduced overidentiﬁcation and self-
judgement in conjunction with increased engagement in adaptive
emotional regulation processes predicted changes in these clinical
outcomes. Moreover, Diedrich et al. (2017) additionally found
adaptive emotional regulation that involves an increased ability
to tolerate one’s negative emotions mediated the relationship
between self-compassion and depression in individuals with
unipolar depression. Serene can therefore help individuals cope
with their depression in the current pandemic by reducing
overidentiﬁcation with one’s negative emotions through self-
compassion.

2Hedge’s g is also a measure of eﬀect size. The diﬀerence between Hedge’s g and
Cohen’s d is very small in large sample sizes > 20.

Although there were signiﬁcant within-group decreases in
anxiety in our current study,
the results demonstrated no
signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerences in anxiety scores. A meta-
analysis by Weisel et al. (2019) similarly found signiﬁcant
improvements in depression for mental health-based apps and
no signiﬁcant improvements over active controls for anxiety.
Another meta-analysis by Firth et al. (2017b) however found
a moderate eﬀect size (g=0.45) on symptoms of anxiety for
individuals with sub-clinical and clinical symptoms of anxiety
who used apps that promoted overall mental well-being, some
of which applied some CBT techniques. The reported diﬀerences
may be due to the length and content of these interventions.
Moreover, Canet-Juric et al. (2020) found individuals reported
experiencing varying levels of anxiety over time during the
pandemic. Individuals who quarantined alone were less likely
to report experiencing anxiety levels over time. On the other
hand, individuals who engaged in the consumption of COVID-
related news were more likely to experience higher levels of
anxiety. Therefore, more studies that examine the relationship
between these factors and other potential inﬂuential factors (e.g.,
age diﬀerences) while engaging in Serene are needed. Engaging in
Serene for a longer period (8–12 weeks) may also facilitate further
signiﬁcant reductions in anxiety symptoms.

Moreover, mean baseline scores in our current study were
moderate on average for depression and anxiety and mild
for stress. Participants also scored high on average on the
psychological well-being measure. Therefore, it may be that
participants in our current sample are already doing quite well.
This warrants further studies with the Serene app in populations
with signiﬁcantly greater levels of anxiety, depression, and
stress. Moreover, greater engagement with the app, and more
speciﬁcally with the cognitive restructuring task may contribute
to further signiﬁcant eﬀects across these measures. Shikatani
et al. (2014) found both mindfulness and cognitive restructuring
were essential in reducing cognitive distortions during post-
event processing in individuals with social anxiety. Cuijpers et al.
(2014) also found psychotherapeutic treatments that employ
cognitive restructuring produced signiﬁcant eﬀects on anxiety
symptoms. Since about only 50 percent of our participants
engaged in this task, future studies may want to examine changes
in anxiety in a larger sample in individuals who engaged in both
mindfulness and cognitive restructuring. Moreover, 20 percent of
individuals in the control group were engaging in mindfulness
practices at the time of the study. Therefore, this may explain the
equivalent decreases in the control group and the small between-
group diﬀerences for stress and anxiety. Further studies may want
to include individuals who have not engaged in any mindfulness
practice for both conditions. Since the observed signiﬁcant eﬀects
were evident after engaging with Serene for 4 weeks, the app may
be providing these beneﬁts at an early stage.

On average, individuals reported engaging with all aspects
of the app (mindfulness practices, cognitive restructuring, and
journaling) helped improve their overall subjective well-being.
Most participants regularly engaged in mindfulness meditations
every week. Cognitive restructuring was used at least once by
almost 54% of the participants randomized to the intervention
group. These results suggest that individuals who engage in

Serene for Depression, Anxiety, Stress

Serene in as little as 4 weeks can beneﬁt from its therapeutic
eﬀects. Mindfulness meditations included self-compassionate
practices that were meant to not only help with attention
regulation and awareness but also to address one’s emotions
through a semi-active role by viewing one’s situation through a
more holistic approach which allows for cognitive reframing to
occur. By integrating these practices with a psychoeducational
module, the hope was to facilitate a proactive approach to
problem-solving one’s challenges and to address one’s emotional
distress through a more compassionate approach. A meta-
analysis by Aldao et al. (2010) revealed these forms of adaptive
emotional regulation strategies (problem-solving, reappraisal,
and acceptance), that are used throughout mindfulness and
cognitive restructuring produce moderate to large eﬀects on
symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Prout et al. (2020) found the overall prevalence of anxiety and
depressive symptoms has increased during pandemic, especially
among younger females. Moreover,
they found emotional
regulation processes used by individuals were predictive of
current distress experienced. Serene may oﬀer an active
emotional regulation strategy that can help improve COVID-
related distress. Canet-Juric et al. (2020) also found individuals’
levels of depression increased while their levels of positive aﬀect
decreased over time in areas where quarantine measures were
in place. Speciﬁcally, this was more evident within the younger
population. Moreover, Okruszek et al. (2020) and Killgore
et al. (2020) found the social isolation measures implemented
during the pandemic predicted increased loneliness, depressive
and anxiety symptoms. Our results show Serene can reduce
feelings of
isolation and depressive symptoms. Due to the
ongoing nature of these measures in place due to the pandemic,
self-compassion practice using Serene may provide long-term
beneﬁts to protect individuals against these isolation-related
eﬀects from the pandemic which can exacerbate current
psychological symptoms.

Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984) transactional model on coping
with stressors demonstrates the essential role of cognitive
reappraisal in modulating stress appraisal. According to this
model, appraisal of a stressor is related to one’s interpretation
of whether they deem a situation as threatening and whether
they have the resources to deal with the situation (i.e., perceive
it as controllable). Depending on these components, individuals
will react in an adaptive way that contributes to increased
levels of well-being, a sense of self-eﬃcacy and positive aﬀect
or they will react in a way that will hinder their well-being,
and promote greater negative aﬀect (Garland et al., 2015). A
recent study by Brose et al. (2020) found individuals who engaged
in less adaptive appraisals of the pandemic i.e., perceiving
greater threat and challenge in combination with a lower
perceived sense of control and self-concept of one’s own abilities,
experienced increased negative aﬀect, and less mindfulness in
their daily life. Moreover, this form of stress appraisal was
associated with increases in depressive symptoms and other
negative psychological symptoms during the COVID-19-related
lockdown in Germany.

Glück and Bluck’s (2013) MORE Life Experience model
regards wise individuals as those who understand life as being

full of uncontrollable and unpredictable circumstances yet trust
in their capabilities to engage in adaptive mechanisms in the
face of these situations (Glück, 2021). Self-compassion practice
may provide added beneﬁts in combination with the cognitive
restructuring task. Wong and Yeung (2017) demonstrated how
self-compassion can signiﬁcantly predict greater acceptance
of a distressing situation through the recognition that one’s
current suﬀering is part of the human condition. Moreover,
self-compassion practice results in a greater perception of
controllability in stressful situations (i.e., perceiving that an
individual has the capacity to deal with a stressor eﬀectively;
Chishima et al., 2018). Therefore, self-compassion can aﬀord
individuals the ability to engage with their stressors adaptively
by not overidentifying with negative emotions associated with
the event while recognizing that their experiences of suﬀering
are shared with others. Engaging in the app may therefore allow
individuals to have a more balanced perspective on their current
feelings and situation. In addition, cognitive restructuring can
then help one identify and modify unhelpful thoughts/beliefs that
may be underlying these feelings and help one plan and develop
steps to actively improve one’s behavioral responses to these
stressors which can subsequently contribute to improvements
in depressive symptoms. In the face of the new resulting reality
following the stressful events of the pandemic, wiser individuals
may actively recruit these adaptive emotion regulation strategies.
Through both compassion and wisdom, individuals can gain
greater self-insight to care for their own welfare (Glück, 2021).

The Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory by Garland et al. (2015)
may also explain how self-compassion and mindfulness can
provide an avenue for successful appraisal of a stressor through
adaptive emotion regulation processes. Mindfulness practice
helps shift the focus from one’s automatic cognitive thought
patterns to a non-judgmental metacognitive state of awareness.
By shifting awareness to the present moment, individuals can
view the situation holistically and thereby begin to notice other
contextual information that can help them appraise a stressful
situation in a more positive manner. For instance, individuals
may notice available forms of support to them or they may shift
their thought patterns from extreme cognitive distortions (e.g.,
all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralizations) to more adaptive
forms of thinking which can then help them formulate a more
positive and meaningful appraisal of their situation (Garland
et al., 2015). A greater sense of togetherness and comradery
through self-compassion may then further facilitate this shift
in cognitive processing to facilitate further improvements in
depressive symptoms.

Our

study revealed stable scores across both wisdom
measures. However,
there were signiﬁcant between-group
diﬀerences in emotional regulation and decisiveness in the San
Diego-Wisdom subscales. These results are in line with the
current conceptualization of wisdom by Ardelt (2003), Webster
(2007), and Grossmann et al. (2016) as being a stable trait
with some changeable context-inﬂuenced characteristics. For
instance, individuals who engage in more wise reasoning, which
can change based on the situation, are more likely to engage
in positive reappraisal and reduced thought suppression while
encountering a challenging situation. Grossmann et al. (2016)

Al-Refae et al.

Serene for Depression, Anxiety, Stress

believes this form of wise reasoning predicts greater well-being,
increased levels of positive aﬀect and reduced negative aﬀect.
This also means that wisdom and well-being can be achieved
through some of the strategies implemented in this app (i.e.,
self-compassion, cognitive restructuring, etc.).

Glück and Bluck’s (2013)’s MORE Life Experience model
also suggests wise individuals are able to reappraise challenging
situations in a more positive manner and actively deal with
them through the recruitment of certain psychological resources.
increased emotional regulation, which can be
For instance,
acquired through self-compassion, can promote wiser reasoning
which may help individuals deal with stressful situations more
successfully (Glück, 2021). Moreover, wiser individuals are not
only more aware of their feelings (both positive and negative)
but they also learn to derive meaning from them and are
able to recognize their importance in shaping their outcomes
(Kunzmann, 2004). Similarly, self-compassion and mindfulness
entail
the recognition and understanding of one’s current
experiences and emotions as opposed to suppressing them or
distracting oneself from remembering or dealing with them.
Through self-compassion, individuals are aware of these negative
emotions, yet they do not magnify their problems or allow them
to dominate their core beliefs. Therefore, they can positively
reappraise their current distressing situations through cognitive
restructuring and learn and grow from them (Grossmann et al.,
2016). Ardelt (2003) considers this form of reappraisal as a
gateway to increased self-awareness and self-insight. In fact,
one study by Sharma and Dewangan (2017) found engagement
in an 18-week mindfulness and journaling-based intervention
promotes increased levels of wisdom through the process of
reappraisal. Therefore,
individuals who engage with Serene
can beneﬁt from increased self-compassion levels that allow
them to deal with stressors more eﬀectively through adaptive
emotional regulation and wise reasoning. This may ultimately
contribute to improvements in pre-existing and new mental
health challenges that have resulted from the pandemic. Given
the wide availability of mental health apps, ensuring access to
evidence-based interventions is vital. The results from this study
suggest the need for methodological changes and incorporation
of these critical ingredients in mobile-based mental health care.

Limitations and Future Directions
Although most of the participants were female, the sample
consisted of
individuals from a wide range of educational
backgrounds and employment statuses. The population mainly
consisted of Canadian younger adults (Mean Age = 25.24),
25.5% of which met criteria for a variety of psychological clinical
disorders. This aligns with the current percentage of adults who
are diagnosed with a mental health disorder in other countries:
20.6% in the US and 19.8% for men and 32.4% for women among
young adults in Norway (Gustavson et al., 2018; Substance Abuse
Mental Health Services Administration, 2020). Therefore, our
sample was representative of the composition of the general
population in terms of mental health diagnoses. Additional
research is needed to see whether these results translate for the
male population and older adults in other geographical regions
(e.g., United States, Europe, etc.).

Results for the stress variable demonstrated a small but non-
statistically signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerence in eﬀect size
between the intervention and control group using Cohen’s d
conﬁdence interval. However, a statistically signiﬁcant between-
group diﬀerence was found for stress using the Mann-Whitney
U test at the end of the study. Future studies may want to
replicate this intervention in a larger sample over a longer
period to conclude whether the observed eﬀects translate
to a signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerence. Our results also
demonstrated a moderate between-group diﬀerence in eﬀect size
between the intervention and control group using Cohen’s d
conﬁdence interval for tolerance of divergent values. However,
no statistically signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerence was found
for this subscale using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Moreover,
mean change across the intervention group was small (−0.6).
Future studies may want to explore possible extraneous variables
that may explain these diﬀerences between these two groups. A
larger sample size may also be able to detect these diﬀerences
more accurately. Moreover, 8.7 to 18.8% of the sample reported
experiencing pandemic-related signiﬁcant changes over the 4
weeks that may have impacted their responses to these measures.
Therefore, observed levels of stress, anxiety, and depression may
have been inﬂuenced by these COVID-related factors. Overall,
the app still appears to be eﬀective regardless of these factors.

Moreover, more research on the eﬃcacy of this intervention
in a larger sample size with individuals with clinical diagnoses
using structured diagnostic interviews is needed. Some research
suggests men and women report experiencing diﬀerent levels
of positive and negative aﬀect and that they utilize emotion
regulation skills diﬀerently to some degree (McRae et al.,
2008). Moreover, females report experiencing more depressive
symptoms and rumination than males (Johnson and Whisman,
2013). Weststrate and Glück (2017) suggest wiser individuals
who engage in adaptive forms of reﬂection (e.g., positive
reframing) are more likely to have higher levels of well-being.
In fact, Watkins and Roberts (2020) suggest tasks that involve
continuous thought challenging or reappraisal combined with
adaptive forms of coping may transform maladaptive ruminative
behavior into an adaptive form of self-reﬂection. Therefore,
more research on this appropriate utilization of the cognitive
restructuring task (i.e., continuous rather than one-time) and
whether it may contribute to reductions in ruminative behavior
and subsequent depressive symptoms is needed. Grossmann
et al. (2016) also suggests measuring wisdom through ecological
momentary assessments to better capture one’s levels of wisdom
due to the dynamic nature of this construct that may change
when one engages with diﬀerent stressors. Therefore, future
studies may incorporate this method to better understand
whether other domains of wisdom can be improved by engaging
with this app.

Although our sample was ethnically diverse, more research
is also needed on investigating the eﬃcacy of this intervention
in a larger sample with ethnic minorities and individuals
from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover,
signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the intervention and
control group in regards to ethnicity (e.g., more individuals
identiﬁed as South Asian in the control group). Further

Although the total wisdom score using the San Diego
Wisdom scale had high internal reliability, the prosocial behavior
subscale’s reliability was questionable. Cronbach’s alpha may
be low for this subscale for a number of reasons e.g., using
fewer items on a given scale often produces a lower reliability.
Therefore, a more reliable scale may be needed to capture this
construct. Moreover, non-signiﬁcant changes in psychological
well-being may be attributed to the low reliability scores for some
of the subscale items. Subjective well-being was only measured
through a binary Yes or No indicator as well. Therefore,
well-established, and validated measures with higher internal
reliability scores that better reﬂect well-being (e.g., Satisfaction
with Life Scale; Diener et al., 1985) and emotion regulation (e.g.,
the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; Garnefski
et al., 2001 or the Diﬃculties in Emotion Regulation scale; Gratz
and Roemer, 2004), may be utilized to better capture the changes
across these constructs. More research on the eﬃcacy of this
intervention long-term is also needed.
