Background: Chronic and treatment-resistant depressions pose serious problems in mental

health care. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an effective treatment for remitted

and currently depressed patients. It is, however, unknown whether MBCT is effective for chronic,

treatment-resistant depressed patients.

Method: A pragmatic, multicenter, randomized-controlled trial was conducted comparing
treatment-as-usual (TAU) with MBCT + TAU in 106 chronically depressed outpatients who pre-
viously received pharmacotherapy (≥4 weeks) and psychological treatment (≥10 sessions).

Results: Based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, participants in the MBCT + TAU condi-

tion did not have significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those in the TAU condition (–3.23
[–6.99 to 0.54], d = 0.35, P = 0.09) at posttreatment. However, compared to TAU, the MBCT + TAU
group reported significantly higher remission rates (𝜒 2(2) = 4.25, 𝜑 = 0.22, P = 0.04), lower levels
of rumination (–3.85 [–7.55 to –0.15], d = 0.39, P = 0.04), a higher quality of life (4.42 [0.03–8.81],
d = 0.42, P = 0.048), more mindfulness skills (11.25 [6.09–16.40], d = 0.73, P < 0.001), and more
self-compassion (2.91 [1.17–4.65], d = 0.64, P = 0.001). The percentage of non-completers in the
MBCT + TAU condition was relatively high (n = 12, 24.5%). Per-protocol analyses revealed that
those who completed MBCT + TAU had significantly fewer depressive symptoms at posttreat-
ment compared to participants receiving TAU (–4.24 [–8.38 to –0.11], d = 0.45, P = 0.04).

Conclusion: Although the ITT analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in depressive symp-
toms of MBCT + TAU over TAU, MBCT + TAU seems to have beneficial effects for chronic,

treatment-resistant depressed patients in terms of remission rates, rumination, quality of life,

mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Additionally, patients who completed MBCT showed

significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Reasons for non-completion should be further

investigated.

Procedure

Interested patients received an information letter and were contacted

via telephone. During a subsequent research interview, the Mini Inter-

national Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, Sheehan et al., 1998) was

administered to diagnose depressive, anxiety, psychotic, and addictive

disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. In addition, sociodemographic

and clinical characteristics were assessed, including treatment resis-

tance (DM-TRD, Peeters et al., 2016) and childhood trauma (Childhood

Trauma Questionnaire; Bernstein et al., 2003). The DM-TRD includes

domains such as duration and severity of symptoms, comorbid anxiety

disorders, functional impairments, previous biological treatments, and

previous psychological treatments. After completion of the baseline
measures, participants were randomized to MBCT + TAU or TAU only

by means of a web-based application that was specifically designed for

this study by an independent statistician. Randomization was 1:1 to
MBCT + TAU or TAU only, stratified for treatment center, and mini-

mized for the severity of depressive symptoms (IDS-SR: 21–31; 32–
39; > 40) and chronicity (1–2 years, ≥2 years), without using block ran-

domization. If due to scheduling constraints the time between base-

line assessment and start of MBCT exceeded 4 weeks, a second base-

line assessment was conducted before MBCT started. Participants

assigned to the TAU condition were offered MBCT after completion

of posttreatment measures. Follow-up data were collected at 3 and 6
months after completing MBCT. Additionally, a subsample (N = 86) was

invited to participate in experimental tasks during baseline and post-

treatment to assess biased information processing. These data focus

on different research questions and will be presented separately. Data

presented here were collected between January 2013 and April 2016.

2.4

Interventions

2.4.1 MBCT + TAU

MBCT was based on the manual by Segal, Williams, and Teasdale

(2002) and consisted of 8 weekly 2.5-hr sessions and 1 day of prac-

tice (day of silence). Participants were enrolled in MBCT courses that

were part of the regular treatment program for patients with depres-

sive disorders. The average number of study participants was 2.41
(SD = 1.55) per MBCT group of 8–12 patients. Mindfulness train-

ers were informed about enrollment of participants in the study, but

were pressed to adopt an identical approach and procedure for all

patients. Group members were not informed about study participa-

tion of individual fellow members, but participants were of course

allowed to share this information at will. All mindfulness trainers were

highly experienced in working with depressed patients and had com-

pleted a postgraduate 2-year mindfulness teacher training. Thereby

they met the advanced criteria of good practice guidelines of the UK

Network for Mindfulness-Based Teachers (Network, 2011). Teacher

competence and adherence was assessed with the Mindfulness-Based

Interventions-Teaching Assessment Criteria (Crane et al., 2012) based

on two video recorded sessions per trainer. Two independent mindful-

917

(who trained, respectively, two and three participants) were unavail-

able. Participants received TAU in conjunction with MBCT.

2.4.2

TAU

Treatment-as-usualTAU was a naturalistic condition consisting of

mental health care for depression, including antidepressant medica-

tion, psychological treatment, support by a psychiatric nurse, or day-

hospital treatment. There were no significant differences between

conditions in the mean number of treatment sessions or in the num-

ber of patients who received these treatments (see Table 2). Medica-

tion levels at baseline can be found in Table 1. A minority of participants

changed in medication level. This information is summarized in Table 2

and additional information can be found in the Supporting Information

Table 1.

2.5 Outcome measures

2.5.1

Primary outcome measure

The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptoms assessed

with IDS-SR (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, & Trivedi, 1996). The IDS-SR

has good psychometric properties (Rush et al., 1996). The IDS-SR has

previously been used in research on MBCT and is sensitive to change

(Geschwind, Peeters, Huibers, van Os, & Wichers, 2012). In the current
sample, the internal consistency was 𝛼 = 0.74.

2.5.2

Secondary outcome measures

Remission was assessed with the depression module of the MINI,

which investigates depressive symptoms according to DSM-IV crite-

ria. Remission was defined as the absence of depressive symptoms

during the last 2 weeks. Participants reporting some symptoms but

not fulfilling DSM-IV criteria according to the MINI were classified as

being in partial remission. The interviews were administered by trained

research psychologists supervised by an experienced psychiatrist (AS)

and were audio recorded. For logistical reasons, it was not possible to

keep the research psychologists blind to treatment allocation. A ran-
dom sample (n = 25) of the recorded MINI depression modules was

scored by an independent psychologist blind to condition, who was

extensively trained in the administration of the MINI. This yielded a
high interrater reliability (Cohen's kappa 0.88).

Rumination was assessed with the Ruminative Response Scale

(RRS-EXT; Raes & Hermans, 2007; Schoofs, Hermans, & Raes, 2010).

Quality of life was assessed with the World Health Organization Qual-
ity of Life scale (Skevington, Lotfy, & O'Connell, 2004). Mindfulness

skills and self-compassion were assessed with the Five Facet Mind-

fulness Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2008) and the Self-Compassion

Scale (Neff, 2003), respectively. More information about these sec-

ondary outcome measures can be found in the published study proto-

col (Cladder-Micus et al., 2015, pp. 5–6).

Statistical analysis

ness trainers rated the trainers. Mutually agreed ratings of the train-
ers were “proficient” (n = 2), “proficient/competent” (n = 1), “compe-
tent” (n = 2), and “advanced beginner” (n = 1). Videos of two trainers

The power calculation was based on a Cohen's d effect size of 0.53

for currently depressed patients as reported in a previous study (van
Aalderen et al., 2011). Based on an 𝛼 of 0.05 and power of 80%,

RESULTS

to be 0.5, and expecting a drop-out of 8 participants, a required sam-

ple size of 94 participants emerged (Cladder-Micus et al., 2015). For

Patient flow

the main analysis, posttreatment scores of depressive symptoms were

compared between the two conditions in an analysis of covariance

(ANCOVA), controlling for baseline scores of depression, chronicity
(1–2 years; ≥2 years), and treatment site. Similar analyses were con-

ducted for the secondary outcome measures, controlling for baseline
scores of the respective variable, chronicity (1–2 years; ≥2 years), and
treatment site. A Cohen's d effect size was calculated based on the
total group's (n = 106) standard deviation on the IDS-SR at baseline.

A statistical significance level of 0.05 was adhered to for all analyses.

Moderating effects of gender, age, childhood trauma, number of previ-

ous episodes, duration of current depressive episode treatment resis-

tance, baseline levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, mindful-

ness skills, and self-compassion were explored in the intention-to-treat

(ITT) sample by incorporating interaction effects in the models. Post-

treatment IDS-SR scores were missing for 10 participants (9.4%, TAU:
n = 5, MBCT + TAU: n = 5). There were no differences in clinical or base-

line characteristics between patients with and without posttreatment

IDS-SR scores, except that the patients with missing scores reported a
higher number of previous depressive episodes (M = 5.00, SD = 8.90,
t (102) = –2.32, P = 0.02) than complete cases (M = 2.45, SD = 2.07).

For two patients without posttreatment scores, follow-up scores were

used. Analyses were based on an ITT approach including all available

data. Next, analyses were repeated in the per-protocol (PP) sample,
including participants of MBCT + TAU who attended ≥4 sessions and

participants of TAU. Sensitivity analyses were performed by imputing

missing data according to the last observation carried forward (LOCF)

technique. IBM SPSS statistics 22 was used to analyze the data.

Of the 213 patients who were assessed for eligibility, 111 were
interviewed and 106 were randomized over MBCT + TAU (n = 49)
and TAU (n = 57) (see Figure 1). There were no significant differ-

ences in clinical characteristics or baseline scores between the con-

ditions (see Table 1). Before entering the study, 102 participants had
received > 10 sessions of psychological treatment during the cur-

rent episode, one participant completed nine sessions during the
current depressive episode and > 10 during the previous episode,

and three participants refused psychological treatment because they
received > 10 sessions during the previous depressive episode. Five

participants refused to use antidepressant medication during the

current depressive episode against the advice of their psychiatrist.
All other participants (n = 101) had been using adequate levels of

antidepressant medication for at least 4 weeks. Twenty-six (53.0%)
MBCT + TAU participants completed a second baseline because time

from randomization to MBCT exceeded 4 weeks and no significant

changes in depressive symptoms between the first and second baseline
= 40.38,
= 41.15, SDbaseline1
= 9.99; t (25) = 0.47, P = 0.64). None of the participants

were observed (Mbaseline1
SDbaseline2
of the TAU condition took part in MBCT or other mindfulness-based
training. Twelve participants of the MBCT + TAU condition (24.5%)

= 7.86, Mbaseline2

attended fewer than four sessions of MBCT and were classified as

non-completers. The other participants (completers) attended on aver-
age 7.09 (SD = 1.15) out of the eight MBCT sessions. The most

prevalent reason for drop-out was the occurrence or deterioration of

physical problems (see Figure 1). Non-completers reported a shorter

duration of the current depressive episode (M = 60.05 months,
SD = 71.72) than completers (M = 93.18 months, SD = 56.22; U = 246.5,
P = 0.005) and they were more often unemployed (𝜒 2 (5) = 8.60,
P = 0.04). There were no other significant differences in sociodemo-

graphic or clinical characteristics between non-completers and com-

pleters (see Table 2 in the Supporting Information). No serious adverse

events occurred.

3.2

Primary outcome

Depression scores were analyzed separately for the ITT sample and the
PP sample. In both analyses, the MBCT + TAU condition showed lower

levels of depressive symptoms than TAU, with small to medium effect

sizes. However, the difference was only significant in the PP sample
(–4.24, 95% CI [–8.38 to –0.11], d = 0.45, P = 0.04) and not in the ITT
sample (–3.23, 95% CI [–7.02 to 0.56], d = 0.35, P = 0.09) (see Table 3).

Sensitivity analyses using the LOCF sample led to similar findings.

When participants who refused to take antidepressant medication
(n = 5) were excluded from the analyses, results of the ITT sample (–
3.01, 95% CI [–6.8, 0.78], d = 0.31, P = 0.12) and the PP sample (–4.59,
95% CI [–8.8, –0.38], d = 0.51, P = 0.03) were comparable to the main

analyses.

3.3

Secondary outcomes

Compared to TAU, a significantly larger proportion of MBCT + TAU
participants reached remission (MBCT + TAU: 41.5%; TAU: 21.6%,

Table 4). However, most cases were classified as partial remission
(MBCT + TAU: 39.0%; TAU: 17.65%) and a minority as full remission
(MBCT + TAU: 2.44%; TAU: 3.92%). Compared to TAU, the MBCT +
TAU condition showed significantly less rumination (d = 0.39, P = 0.04)
and significantly higher quality of life (d = 0.42, P = 0.048) at posttreat-

ment, controlling for baseline scores. Additionally, participants with
MBCT + TAU showed significantly more mindfulness skills (d = 0.73,
P < 0.001) and significantly more self-compassion (d = 0.64, P = 0.001)

more participants in the MBCT + TAU condition reached partial
remission and MBCT + TAU participants reported less rumination

and increased quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion

compared to participants receiving TAU only.

The finding that the decrease in depressive symptoms was signif-

icant only in the PP analysis and not in the ITT analysis can be partially

explained by the relatively high proportion of patients not completing
MBCT (n = 12, 24.5%). This percentage is comparable to other studies

on MBCT in chronic (27.8%; Michalak, Schultze, Heidenreich, &

Schramm, 2015) or pharmacoresistant depressed patients (22.98%;

Eisendrath et al., 2016), but seems to be higher than in studies

focusing on patients with recurrent depression (8.8%; van Aalderen

et al., 2011). Compared to completers, non-completers reported a

shorter duration of the current depressive episode and were more

often unemployed. This could indicate that a longer duration might

increase psychological burden and thereby motivates patients to

acquire new skills. Additionally, a daily routine could be helpful in

incorporating mindfulness skills into daily life. However, the sample of

non-completers is too small to draw firm conclusions here. Although

one might expect that the most severely depressed patients drop out

comparable results (see Tables 3 and 4).

3.4 Moderation analyses

There were no significant moderators for the effect of condition on

depressive symptoms in the ITT sample, apart from baseline levels of
rumination (F (1, 84) = 5.44, P = 0.02). Participants with higher baseline

rumination showed a significantly larger decrease in depressive symp-
toms in the MBCT + TAU condition compared to TAU, while controlling

for depressive symptoms on baseline. In an exploratory analysis, par-

ticipants were grouped based on a previously published clinical mean

of the RRS-EXT (Raes et al., 2009). In the group of participants scoring

above the clinical mean for rumination, participants assigned to MBCT
+ TAU showed significantly lower depressive symptoms compared to
TAU (–10.79, 95% CI [–15.72 to –5.85], d = 1.64, P < 0.001; MBCT +
TAU n = 17, TAU n = 22) posttreatment while controlling for baseline
depressive symptoms, whereas no difference between MBCT + TAU

and TAU was observed in the group of participants scoring below the
clinical mean (1.47, 95% CI [–4.38 to 7.33], d = 0.24, P = 0.62; MBCT +
TAU n = 22, TAU n = 30). Patients of the MBCT + TAU condition who

scored high on treatment resistance (DM-TRD) tended to report higher

levels of depressive symptoms posttreatment, however this difference
was not significant (F (1, 89) = 3.05, P = 0.084).

DISCUSSION

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of
MBCT + TAU for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients, who

of treatment, non-completers and completers did not differ in the

severity of depressive symptoms, number of previous episodes, or age

of onset. By contrast, a noticeable number of non-completers reported

that physical problems (see Figure 1) interfered with participation and

were the reason for discontinuing MBCT.

MBCT + TAU had significant effects on rumination, quality of life,

mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Following the course, MBCT
+ TAU participants reported less rumination and a higher quality of

life. The increase in mindfulness skills and self-compassion might indi-

cate that chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients are able to

learn mindfulness meditation techniques and develop a more compas-

sionate and friendlier attitude toward themselves. Although results

of these secondary outcomes should be interpreted as preliminary, as

the power analysis was focused on changes in depressive symptoms,
this may indicate that MBCT + TAU has effects that could be valuable

for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients, even if no or only

small changes in depressive symptoms are evoked.

This study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of MBCT +

TAU for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients who did not

benefit from pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment. The cur-

rent study has high ecological validity because of its pragmatic design.

Participants were moderately to severely depressed outpatients and

were enrolled in MBCT trainings provided regularly at their local men-

tal health care institution. Thereby this study provides much-needed

insight into the effectiveness rather than efficacy of MBCT, which was

formulated as an important research goal in a recent review paper

of MBCT (Dimidjian & Segal, 2015). However, the effect sizes found
in this study (ITT: d = 0.35; PP: d = 0.45) are smaller than in previ-

ous preliminary studies of chronic or treatment-resistant depressed

the expected reduction in depressive symptoms. However, completers
of the MBCT + TAU did show a significant decrease in depressive
