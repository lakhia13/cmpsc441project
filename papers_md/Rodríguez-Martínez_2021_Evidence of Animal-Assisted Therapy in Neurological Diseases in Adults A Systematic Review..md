Abstract: Background: In recent years, the possibility of intervening humans with animal-assisted
therapy (AAT) has been growing due to numerous physical, psychological, and social beneﬁts
provided to humanity, enabling them to maintain or improve their quality of life. There exist different
animals through which this therapy can be performed. The purpose of this systematic review will
focus on the effects of AAT in several neurological diseases. Methods: The search of clinical trials
was carried out in the PubMed, Scielo, Embase and PEDro databases. The selection of articles was
made according to the different inclusion and exclusion criteria, incorporating those that approached
neurological diseases to be reviewed. Results: Twenty-ﬁve clinical trials were identiﬁed, seventeen of
which were ﬁnally included in the review. The results indicate that animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in
different neurological diseases has many beneﬁts in several areas, for example, in motor and physical
ability as well as in mental and behavioural health. Conclusions: This systematic review provides
occupational therapy practitioners with evidence on the use of activity based on animal-assisted
therapy as a novel ﬁeld of intervention that can complement other therapies and obtain beneﬁts in
different populations.

Keywords: animal-assisted therapy; neurological disease; stroke; multiple sclerosis; dementia

1. Introduction

From the Prehistoric age, animals have lived with people as loyal partners while
improving their quality of life. The relationship between humans and animals has been
demonstrated throughout history, i.e., prehistoric cave paintings of humans, wolves with
dogs as their offspring after being domesticated for between 10 and 20 thousand years
ago [1]. Horses have played a major role in the evolution of human society since the
Bronze and Iron Ages. They have been crucial to warfare before the development of
ﬁrearms [2], although the origins date to 460 before Christ, when Hippocrates applied
riding on horseback as therapy for ﬁghting against insomnia and improving muscular
tonicity [3].

Therefore, animals have sustained humans in several aspects of daily life, including
as guardians of the youngest children, accompanying the hunters or leading the herd, or
by attending to blind people or people with other disabilities [4]. According to the Interna-
tional Association of Human–Animal Interaction Organization (IAHAIO), the inclusion
of animals within a therapeutic environment has existed since the end of the seventeenth

century [5]. As documented by Filan et al., “animals make humans feel better and serve
as aids to communication, reaching those who show little response to other stimuli” [6],
the best known being in the areas of assistance dogs for people who are deaf or blind,
but there is an emerging ﬁeld of data on the use of assistance dogs for people with post-
traumatic stress disorders and other areas of mental health and dogs that detect cancers
and seizures [7]. As a result, due to the strong link between humans and animals, this
therapy has emerged by incorporating animals into the rehabilitation process.

Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) refer to the development of entertainment, recre-
ation, and motivation to improve quality of life, while in AAT, there is a targeted interven-
tion performed by a health professional with clear goals that is directed to develop and/or
improve social, physical, emotional and cognitive aspects of the people involved [8,9].
Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can be deﬁned as those methods that include animals in
the prevention and treatment of human mental and physical pathologies [10]. We can also
deﬁne it as a goal-directed intervention in which an animal that meets speciﬁc criteria is an
integral part of the treatment process (AWMA. Animal-assisted interventions: deﬁnitions).
The methods of action under which AAT works are different and include: multisensory
stimulation, imitation, physical contact, play, generation of the feeling of affection, and
reinforcement of desired and stress reduction [11,12]. The most suitable animals for AAT
are ﬁsh, cats, dogs and horses [13], although birds, rabbits, dolphins, pigs, chicken or any
other that is prepared regardless of their size can also help [14,15]; however, it depends on
the individual receiving the therapy. In addition, this therapy has the main objective that
can be developed in groups or individually in order to help people ﬁnd total well-being [16].
In this systematic review, we will focus on dogs and horses as animals involved in
therapy. Dogs are especially beneﬁcial in the ﬁeld of medicine and are more involved
for this activity or for assisted therapy [14]. Furthermore, the horse also stands out as a
co-therapist because we can perform therapy in three ways: passive hippotherapy, using
the horse’s pace (the patient does not have an active role in the activity as the therapist
leads the rehabilitation exercises); active hippotherapy (implementation of neuromuscular
exercises that are aimed at promoting muscle tone, coordination, postural control and
balance) [17]; therapeutic riding (equino therapy teaching as a sport, in which the patient
rules the horse, engages with it and turns into an active rider; step, jog, and gallop are
worked according to the skills developed by the patient) [18].

Some research has shown that AAT with dogs causes an automatic relaxation response,
including: reducing feelings of anxiety and loneliness in mental health and a reduction of
blood pressure that improves cardiovascular health, which therefore reduces the intake
of medications in the area of physical health [19]. Other research has indicated that a pet
has signiﬁcant health effects such as lowered risk factors for cardiovascular disease, i.e.,
coronary heart disease [20,21], higher chance of surviving myocardial infarction [22,23],
and less need of physician services during stressful life events [24].

Conversely, horses also have numerous therapeutic effects. The ﬁrst is to improve
postural control through the improvement of balance and straightening reactions [25],
especially in people with impairment of muscle patterns or delayed action of antagonist
muscles (in people with a lack of modulation of muscle tone such as cerebrovascular
diseases or multiple sclerosis) [26]. The second is to increase human gait since to ride horses
helps in the experience movements that are similar to humans when walking, which allows
automation of gait until it becomes a functional pattern [27]. The third is to standardize
muscle tone which hippotherapy provides through the stimulus of co-contraction between
agonist and antagonist muscles, and which improves reciprocal innervation during the
riding process [28]. Finally, hippotherapy involves a range of emotions, interactions, and
cognitive processes in addition to providing beneﬁts in the social aspect [29].

Furthermore, if we study the physiological effects of human–animal interactions, we
can ﬁnd effects in different indicators. For instance, being involved in a positive interaction
with a dog was found to be relaxing enough that it lowered stress levels (reducing cortisol

levels and causing a signiﬁcantly higher increase of oxytocin, which plays an important
role in pair bonding, social afﬁliation, and trust in many species) [30,31].

For all these reasons, the aim of this systematic review is to inquire the beneﬁts that
animal-assisted therapy can bring in the ﬁeld of neurology (focusing on the following
diseases: dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and multiple sclerosis), since there is wide evidence that these disorders represent
one of the most serious threats for public health [32], and to inquire to the clinical mani-
festations that often include loss of muscle tone, selective motor control and balance [33],
spasticity, and impaired strength [34], which can be improved with the proposed therapy.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Search Strategies

To carry out this systematic review, an exhaustive search was performed in the
PubMed, Scielo, Embase and PEDro databases to identify clinical trials published un-
til November 2020 without a chronological limitation in period of years. We also searched
for systematic reviews and meta-analyses when this research started, and a search was
previously carried out in PROSPERO in order to check if this topic had been developed,
and no similar research had been found. On 23 November 2021, a new search was carried
out, and there was no review that covered all the neurological diseases studied. Figure 1
was developed according to the PRISMA regulation, and the trial selection is attached (see
Figure 1). The bibliographic search was performed until November 2020. The key search
terms used were the same in all databases: (animal-assisted therapy) AND (neurological
disease OR stroke OR multiple sclerosis OR spinal cord injury OR dementia OR Parkin-
son OR epilepsy OR ALSOR neuromuscular disease). Although the search was carried
out in other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy,
Parkinson’s, and neuromuscular diseases, no results were obtained for these pathologies.

2.2. Selection Criteria

Studies were included in this systematic review if they met the following criteria: study
design was clinical trial, controlled clinical trial or randomized clinical trial; participants
were adults, diagnosed with some neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis, stroke,
dementia (Alzheimer’s), spinal cord injury, Parkinson, ALS, neuromuscular disease or
epilepsy; each study had to detail a number of physical, mental or emotional points
and then compare the results after the intervention with animal-assisted therapy (AAT);
in the selected studies, it was necessary to specify the kind of test used to check both
the changes produced after the intervention and the starting point of the patients that
involved themselves.

Exclusion criteria were: letters to the editor, single case studies, communications to
conferences, revision, or systematic review; not written in English or Spanish; performed
on children or teenagers (in diseases such as cerebral palsy, autism . . . ); no accurate
diagnosis of neurological disease (for example, those aimed at the elderly, who did not
have a diagnosis in dementia or those who were disorders of the psychiatric area, such
as post-traumatic disorders); made in robots; other neurological diseases that were not
addressed in the systematic review (acquired brain injury or minimally unconscious state);
animal-assisted therapy not performed with horses or dogs solely (for example with
canaries or insects).

The quality assessment of the selected studies was carried out by two independent
researchers using PEDro Scale [35,36]. The scores of the studies are in Table 1. The mean
score obtained according to the PEDro scale to assess the methodological quality of the
clinical trials and pilot studies was 7/10.

3. Results

After the search, a total of 1743 results were obtained of which, after applying the

inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 clinical trials were selected (see Figure 1).

The results obtained are summarized in Table 1 (see Table 1). It includes: surname
of the ﬁrst author and year of publication of each study, neurological pathology that the
clinical trial is about, type of study, number of patients, study design, characteristics of
each intervention, measures (tests used in the study) and outcomes (results in summarized
form of each clinical trial). Then, the articles were classiﬁed according to the neurological
pathology that they address.

3.1. Results in Patients with Dementia

The patients submitted some type of dementia in seven studies [37–43]. Two of
them were non-randomised. In particular, three articles of the seven mentioned [37,40,42]
recruited patients with Alzheimer’s. Some diagnoses were based on the DSM-IV manual
and the ICD-10. In all of them, the animals involved dogs in the therapy.

Different domains that may be affected in this neurological disease were measured
with speciﬁc tests. Scales were used to assess depression symptoms in all studies except for
one [39]. Except for one study [38], the rest used the MMSE scale to identify the cognitive
state of the patients. In two of them [38,39], the quality of life in later phases of dementia
was evaluated. Balance, emotional aspects and agitation were also evaluated [38,40–43].

Among the interventions made in these studies, we found: AAT adapted to reality
orientation therapy, petting and greeting the dog, giving the dog treats and orders, brushing
them, throwing a toy at them, brushing the dog’s teeth, dressing them, adjusting the collar,
speaking with the dog, and on the dog to another person, taking a short walk. All of this
was performed to stimulate sensory, social, cognitive, and motor functions.

Statistically signiﬁcant results were found in all articles for the beneﬁt of AAT, except
for one [41], where in the intervention group, the results remained the same as at the
beginning of the study. Among the most relevant results in patients with dementia where
therapy was applied, the following stood out: decreases in stress levels via measured
cortisol levels [37]; improvement in balance [38], improvement in symptoms of depression

Selection Criteria Studies were included in this systematic review if they met the following criteria: study design was clinical trial, controlled clinical trial or randomized clinical trial; par-ticipants were adults, diagnosed with some neurological disease such as multiple sclero-sis, stroke, dementia (Alzheimer’s), spinal cord injury, Parkinson, ALS, neuromuscular disease or epilepsy; each study had to detail a number of physical, mental or emotional points and then compare the results after the intervention with animal-assisted therapy (AAT); in the selected studies, it was necessary to specify the kind of test used to check both the changes produced after the intervention and the starting point of the patients that involved themselves. Exclusion criteria were: letters to the editor, single case studies, communications to conferences, revision, or systematic review; not written in English or Spanish; performed on children or teenagers (in diseases such as cerebral palsy, autism…); no accurate di-agnosis of neurological disease (for example, those aimed at the elderly, who did not have a diagnosis in dementia or those who were disorders of the psychiatric area, such as post-traumatic disorders); made in robots; other neurological diseases that were not ad-dressed in the systematic review (acquired brain injury or minimally unconscious state); animal-assisted therapy not performed with horses or dogs solely (for example with ca-naries or insects). The quality assessment of the selected studies was carried out by two independent researchers using PEDro Scale [35,36]. The scores of the studies are in Table 1. The mean score obtained according to the PEDro scale to assess the methodological quality of the clinical trials and pilot studies was 7/10.  Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12882

and quality of life [37]; signiﬁcant results in physical, behavioural and emotional func-
tion [40]; increase of pleasure, motor activity and general alertness; reduced sadness [42];
and improvement of cognitive function [43].

3.2. Results in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis

Some studies were made in patients with multiple sclerosis and, in all, the animals that
were involved for assisted therapy were horses [44–46]. One of them was a non-randomised
comparative open study [44], another had previously published protocol [45], and the last
was randomised [46].

The test used to evaluate the quality of life in all articles was MSQOL-54, which is
speciﬁc to multiple sclerosis and to quality of life in patients with constipation; CVE-20 was
speciﬁcally used. Fatigue was measured with FSS and FIS. The Asworth scale and the NRS
were used to evaluate spasticity (the EDSS scale also evaluated it). Other aspects evaluated
were general health perception (KHQ), depression (BDI), walking speed (T25-FW) and
balance (BBS).

The interventions focused on different protocols. In study [44], the sessions were
carried out by the equestrian team, which apart from including exercise on the horse’s back
(sensory stimuli and different movements provided by the horse), carried out workshops
of complementary activities such as cleaning the horse, ﬁeld trips, attention to behaviour,
and relationship with the environment (Terapias ecuestres) [47]. In study [45], patients
received hippotherapy as deﬁned by the German Board of Trustees for Therapeutic Riding
(DKThR), where the horse is led by an assistant on a long rein and the physiotherapy
treatment accomplishes the hippotherapist (Hippotherapie DKThR®) [48].

Statistically signiﬁcant results were found in improving fatigue spasticity, balance,
and pain perception [45]. There were also outstanding results in respect to the general
perception of health and quality of life [44]. However, no signiﬁcant results were obtained
in depression, constipation, and gait.

3.3. Results in Patients with Stroke

Bunketorp-Käll et al. [49], Bunketorp-Käll et al. [50], Bunketorp-Käll et al. [51], and
Beinotti et al. [52] all included stroke patients. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) involved
horses in all of them, and the studies were all randomised.

Bunketorp-Käll et al. studied the effects of AAT both on the aftermath of patients [47,48]
and on the quality of life of their caregivers using the LISS questionnaire [51], the study
protocol of which was previously published [53].

Among the study variables, balance (BBS, BDL-BS and BBL-BS scales), grip strength
using the Grippit dynamometer, general cognitive level with the BNIS screen, and working
memory with the LNS test were evaluated. To measure the impact of stroke, the SIS
scale and quality of life scale were used with the SF-36 survey. In addition, upper limb
function, stress, perception of physical functioning, perceived conﬁdence, depression, self-
efﬁcacy, psychomotor speed, non-verbal learning, fatigue experienced, motor items, level
of independence/dependence, and the quality and satisfaction of life were evaluated.

The interventions carried out were: preparation of the horse (grooming and equipping
it), equestrian activity where the three-dimensional movements of the back of the horse
caused sensorimotor experience similar to normal human gait, balance exercises (hands
on head, making diagonals or circles), exercises of trunk rotation (touching different parts
of the horse, using a stick), exercises to train affected parts (simulating riding a bicycle,
lying with the arms around the horse, holding the reins...), cognitive exercises (giving
instructions, participating in route planning), exercises to stimulate strength, relaxation
exercises, body awareness, and deep, slow breathing.

Regarding the studies, signiﬁcant results were obtained in the perception of recovery
from stroke, remaining up to 6 months after the intervention [51], including increased
SF-36 scores in the areas of functional capacity, physical aspects, and mental health [52].
In one of them, it was demonstrated that the quality of life was better in the caregivers

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12882

11 of 17

of the patients when the horse-assisted therapy intervention was completed, including
up to three months later (although it was not signiﬁcant at 6 months) [50]. In the most
recent study, the effectiveness of hippotherapy in improving gait and functional mobility
was also observed, while in rhythm and music therapy, there were no such improvements
evident [49].

3.4. Results in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury

Two studies of interest were found [54,55]. One of them was a quasi-experimental
analysis and was performed in patients with spinal cord injury grouped into a single
group [54]. The other was a crossover trial with three groups [55]. Assisted therapy was
carried out with dogs in the ﬁrst study and with horses in the second.

In the ﬁrst study, the VAS and WUSPI scales were used. The ﬁrst was to identify the
level of effort perceived in the upper extremities, and the second was to identify shoulder
pain in wheelchair users. In addition, the AIS scale was used to identify the sensory and
motor severity of the patients. In the second, the VAS scale was also used. Other scales
used were the Ashworth scale (for spasticity) and the Bf-S (to assess mental well-being).

In the quasi-experimental analysis, the intervention consisted of using a dog to climb
a ramp. The dogs were previously trained for 5 months, and the users attended training
classes. Signiﬁcant results were obtained when climbing the ramp with the help of an
assistance dog, with less effort made in the upper limbs (muscular use of the anterior
deltoid, biceps and pectoral major was reduced) and greater speed [54].

In the crossover trial, twelve patients with spinal cord injury were divided into three
intervention groups, rotating every four weeks with rest periods between the different
treatments. One of the interventions was hippotherapy (HTK therapy, in which the subject
was passively moved by the movement of the horse); in another, they performed therapy
with the patients sitting astride a Bobath roll, and in the other, they performed with the
users sitting on a stool with a rocking chair operated by an electric motor. In the short
term, improvements in spasticity (clinically proven) were achieved in subjects who were
treated with hippotherapy. In the self-reported spasticity by the VAS scale, there was no
signiﬁcant difference before and after each session in the intervention performed with the
rocking chair. Instead, there were improvements in the other two therapies. Better mental
well-being was also obtained after the horse therapy intervention, although in the long
term, there were no improvements in any of the above aspects [55].

4. Discussion

This systematic review focuses on investigating the efﬁcacy of animal therapy—in this
case, dogs and horses—and in several neurological diseases (speciﬁcally spinal cord injury,
stroke, dementia and multiple sclerosis).

In all the selected trials on dementia and spinal cord injury, animal therapy most
commonly used dogs (except for one spinal cord injury article in which the horse was
involved), whereas in those that recruited patients with multiple sclerosis and stroke, the
most used animal therapy used horses. This suggests that working with one animal or
another will enhance different effects in individuals; therefore, that it is necessary to choose
which animal will be appropriate according to the disease or symptoms suffered by the user.
It would be appropriate to highlight the different co-evolutions of the species involved,
which implies different skills of the animals involved for therapeutic purposes. For this
reason, attention should be given to interspeciﬁc relationships and the factors that inﬂuence
them, as well as the interspeciﬁc relational skills of each individually chosen animal and its
relationship with the owner, such as attachment styles and relational reciprocity between
the animals, patients, and members of the working group [56].

The research revealed that dog therapy in people with dementia decreased stress [37],
anxiety and sadness [42], and depressive symptoms [38,43], while increasing pleasure,
general alertness [42] and improved behaviour [40]. On the basis of this information, it
can be concluded that there is an improvement of symptoms at the psychological and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12882

12 of 17

cognitive level (in one of the studies, the score in the MMSE increased; thus, this therapy
can be helpful in patients with great affectation of memory and reasoning, as well as
in people with loss of social skills) [54]. Although, in one of the studies, the symptoms
of depression, aggression and agitation remained constant in patients with severe and
very severe dementias when combining animal-assisted therapy (AAT) with conventional
treatment or therapy alone, and these symptoms increased over time [41]. This would
suggest that animal therapy in such advanced dementias can maintain some of the symp-
toms, although not improve them; therefore, animals can help to stop their triggering,
and the symptoms will not progress as quickly. This improves the quality of life in severe
dementias, as evidenced by Olsen et al. in their studies [38,39]. Although the increase in
quality of life is also closely related to improving balance, this animal therapy helps to
improve the physical function and motor activity of the patients [40,42]. If we achieve an
improvement in balance, there will be less risk of falls, and this will promote the well-being
of our patients [38]. In respect to the improvement of agitation, there were no signiﬁcant
effects [38].

In users with multiple sclerosis, where the horse is also used as a co-therapist, an
improvement in spasticity and general perception of health was observed, including a
decrease in fatigue after 6 months of hippotherapy [44], although another study highlighted
the same improvements in addition to an improvement in balance in a 12-week treatment,
which was also combined with standard care [45]. This suggests that hippotherapy may
be a great opportunity to improve the symptoms of patients with multiple sclerosis in
terms of motor abilities, but it can be positive in relation to the bond with the horse
due to the mixed emotions created by this therapy. In relation to patients with stroke,
in the four studies carried out, the animal most involved in therapy was the horse. In
two of them [49,51], whose protocol was previously published [53], apart from studying
the efﬁcacy of hippotherapy, the effects of music- and rhythm-based therapy were also
investigated. In the ﬁrst of them [51], it was shown that both therapies increased the
perception of recovery in the late stages of stroke, and the results were lasted up to 6 months,
while in hippotherapy, the score increased in the gait and balance tests, in rhythm and
music therapy, and in grip strength and balance scores. This suggests that the combination
of both could be effective. Therefore, it is important to consider the multimodal approach
to adapt to each patient. The second study focused on the quality of life of caregivers of
stroke patients [50]. It seems that it improves the quality of life of these informal caregivers,
which is beneﬁcial since, if we reduce their stress and anxiety about giving proper attention
to their family or friends, better results will be achieved in these patients. In the most recent
article, improvements were obtained in functional task performance after intervention with
horses [49]. Conversely, Beinotti et al. [52] had already shown that hippotherapy-combined
physiotherapy improved the quality of life of patients and produced a great improvement
in physical aspects such as balance due to the properties of horse therapy. In addition, all
these advantages were added to the challenge, in which users faced the emotions caused
by this therapy, gained self-conﬁdence, and felt more independent [52].

Finally, in patients with spinal cord injury, one of the articles mentioned dogs as
assistants to the user in climbing a ramp. This helped to reduce mechanical load and
muscle demand in the upper limbs [54]. This assistance can be beneﬁcial such that shoulder
pathologies and other pain do not occur in patients, but it can cause disadvantages in the
dog’s health, since in the long term, it can cause problems such as hip dysplasia. For this
reason, perhaps this therapy can be more harmful to the animal if it is not sufﬁciently
trained and if it is subjected to too much working time. To an extent, we should not allow
all the work to be performed by the animal unless the user is not suitable to perform a job or
move around. Conversely, in another study with three different interventions (one of them
was hippotherapy), improvements in spasticity and mental welfare were demonstrated
with horse-assisted therapy compared to the other two therapies (based on stretching and
passive rhythmic mobilizations) [55]. This shows the idea that the horse helps users with
spinal injury in motor aspects such as spasticity due to movements that imitate human gait

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 12882

13 of 17

and helps users with the heat from the animal. Hippotherapy also promotes better mental
health, and this may be because it is a novel therapy for many users and with it, they can
discover various positive emotions. Although only short-term beneﬁts are obtained, more
evidence is needed to know how to work with these animals to favour long-term effects,
since in this study, only 4 weeks of horse therapy was carried out due to the form of the
trial. Thus, it would be important to conduct longer studies to check the effectiveness of
long-term hippotherapy in patients with spinal cord injury.

In order for all these effects to be produced, it is important for the love and affection
that an animal gives to be mutual. As Iannuzzi and Rowan point out: “Reconciling animal
risks with their rehabilitative value is not simple or easy, unless we follow the principle
that animals should not be used at all as a means to an end” [57]. Although a study showed
(using serum and salivary cortisol levels, rectal temperature, blood pressure, systolic
pressure, and resting heart and respiratory rates before, after, and 24 h after therapy) that
the therapy did not seem to cause signiﬁcant stress for dogs [58], animals need their rest
periods such that their health is not adversely affected [59]. It is therefore necessary to
consider the ethical aspects of an AAT program and to establish a basis of non-exploitation
in which human beings are the ones who choose the type of relationship [59]. Among these
principles are:
• Animals must be protected from abuse, discomfort, and stress, from a physical and

mental point of view;
Animals must be provided with adequate health care;

•
• Animals must have access to a quiet place where they can spend time away from

•

•

their activities;
Interactions with users should be structured such that the animal’s ability to serve as
a therapeutic agent is maintained;
A situation of abuse or stress will be never allowed (in this case, the session would be
suspended immediately).

Therefore, it is essential that guidelines be established in which the highest priority is
respect for the animals, because it is impossible to establish a quality relationship that helps
the patient if it causes stress to the animal, wasting the great help they can give through the
application of therapy. As a consequence, there would be no positive effects to the patient.
In 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health published a document on this topic, explaining
the need for safeguards and monitoring the well-being during treatment sessions and
periods of inactivity through clinical and behavioural visits. Any physical, physiological
and/or behavioural changes must be registered. The veterinarian or the coadjutor of the
animal in need must order the interruption of the intervention. Animals which, for any
reason related to age or their health condition, are no longer involved in AAT must be
ensured an adequate living condition [60].

Regarding zoo sanitation and sanitary controls that must be carried out to avoid the risk
of zoonosis during IAA, studies have been increasing in this last period. Murthy et al. [61]
provided some recommendations for the safe oversight and management of animals in
healthcare. It should comply with legal requirements and minimize the risk of transmission
of pathogens from animals to humans when animals are permitted in the healthcare
setting [61]. In this way, it is important to collaborate between veterinarians, physicians,
public health operators, and epidemiologists in order to prevent the transmission of these
bacteria and achieve optimal health for humans, animals and the environment [62].

Limitations

There are heterogeneous studies in methodology (in terms of study duration, sessions,
and type of animal). The samples are small and there are few studies; thus, longitudi-
nal studies are needed. Mental health aspects have not been studied in depth nor has
psychiatric disease been included, as this may be the subject of another study.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, it would be appropriate to mention that, apart from the multiple effects
in the ﬁeld of adult neurology, assisted therapy with dogs and horses is also present
as a treatment option in many other pathologies and ﬁelds. For instance, in respect to
studies with dogs, a decrease in stress levels and improvement in social communication
were observed in adults with autism-spectrum disorders [63]; in patients and staff of
a burn centre, the implantation of a therapy program with dogs caused a better mood
after seeing them and both staff and patients were satisﬁed with this method [64]; in
hospitalized patients awaiting a heart transplant, therapy was recognized as a general
positive complement to usual medical care and a contributor to the increase in the perceived
quality of hospitalization [65]; there was a development of the human–animal bond in a
psychiatric prison that supported inmates’ correctional plans through greater recognition
of their feelings and emotions [66]. Conversely, we found that there are also great beneﬁcial
effects in horse therapy. Among them, we ﬁnd that hippotherapy can be a potential
treatment to help improve gross motor function in children with Down syndrome [67],
to improve attachment in adolescents with Internet gaming disorders [68], to decrease
pain and to improve range of movement and quality of life for adults and older adults
with arthritis [69], to change from moderate to vigorous physical activity and have greater
self-efﬁcacy for physical activity, and to be a pleasant treatment in childhood obesity [70].
All these results, as well as in neurological diseases as mentioned in the previous
paragraph and in other areas (such as prisons), suggest that animal-assisted therapy
(AAT) may be beneﬁcial in the cognitive, social and physical areas. The beneﬁcial effects
deriving from AAT should also consider the psychological component linked to the co-
evolution of dogs with humans [71,72], but further research with more samples and
duration is necessary to consolidate and establish more evidence in this regard, such that
there are not many contradictions in addition to carrying out studies in other types of
neurological diseases in which therapy has not been tested and could have beneﬁcial effects
on such as Parkinson’s or ALS, although this may greatly depend on the type of person
to whom the therapy is directed (there are people who are afraid of animals and can be
counterproductive), the animals involved and the characteristics they have (therefore it is
necessary to be properly trained), and the person leading the therapy. Another important
point is to achieve greater dissemination such that there are more health professionals
trained in this therapy and to offer it as an optimal treatment alternative. It is important
to consider that pets are a consistent source of attachment security; future research with
attachment measures may be useful for understanding how the relationship with a pet
affects other aspects of the owner’s life, perhaps by buffering the experience of negative
human social interactions [73]. The design of integrated studies is necessary to ensure
that added value can be achieved in terms of synergistic beneﬁts between the person and
the pet during animal-assisted interventions. More speciﬁc guidelines for human–animal
interaction should be developed based on such evidence-based knowledge [74].

In addition, there are studies that report decreased stress in dogs when working in the

presence of their human referent [75].
