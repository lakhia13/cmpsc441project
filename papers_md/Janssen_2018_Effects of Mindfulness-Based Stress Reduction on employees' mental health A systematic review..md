The purpose of this exploratory study was to obtain greater insight into the effects of Mindful-
ness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
on the mental health of employees.

Methods

Using PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL, we performed a systematic review in October 2015
of studies investigating the effects of MBSR and MBCT on various aspects of employees’
mental health. Studies with a pre-post design (i.e. without a control group) were excluded.

Results

24 articles were identified, describing 23 studies: 22 on the effects of MBSR and 1 on the
effects of MBSR in combination with some aspects of MBCT. Since no study focused exclu-
sively on MBCT, its effects are not described in this systematic review. Of the 23 studies, 2
were of high methodological quality, 15 were of medium quality and 6 were of low quality. A
meta-analysis was not performed due to the emergent and relatively uncharted nature of the
topic of investigation, the exploratory character of this study, and the diversity of outcomes
in the studies reviewed. Based on our analysis, the strongest outcomes were reduced levels
of emotional exhaustion (a dimension of burnout), stress, psychological distress, depres-
sion, anxiety, and occupational stress. Improvements were found in terms of mindfulness,
personal accomplishment (a dimension of burnout), (occupational) self-compassion, quality
of sleep, and relaxation.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic review suggest that MBSR may help to improve psychological
functioning in employees.

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

Introduction

Given their potential benefits for physical and mental health as well as social relations [1, 2],
interest is increasing internationally in mindfulness interventions in the workplace [3]. This is
also true for the Netherlands, where many work environments are characterized by high pro-
ductivity targets, overtime, high work pressure, customer aggression, temporary employment
contracts, continuous organizational changes, job uncertainty, employee shortages, and little
autonomy [4].

Mindfulness is related to meditation, but the terms are not synonymous. Moreover Mind-
fulness consists of formal meditation exercises (e.g., paying attention to the body, lying on the
ground, or walking slowly with a sense of awareness of one’s surroundings) as well as informal
exercises (e.g., paying full attention to what one is doing or experiencing at a certain moment)
[5].

Mindfulness interventions vary in delivery mode (face-to-face, online) and target popula-
tion (clinical populations with major depression, anxiety disorders, borderline personality dis-
orders, chronic pain, or eating disorders [6] and non-clinical populations such as students and
employees seeking to enhance their subjective well-being). They can range in duration from
long term (e.g., eight weekly 2.5-hour sessions, eight-hour daylong retreats, one 2.5-hour ses-
sion per month for 10 months [7]) to short term (e.g., four weekly 30-minute sessions [8]).
The intensity of interventions can vary too, from high dose (e.g., eight weekly 3-hour sessions
and 45 minutes of daily mindfulness practice [9]) to low dose (e.g., 30-minute sessions and
15–20 minutes of daily mindfulness practice [8]).

Mindfulness interventions in the workplace target workplace functioning: reducing stress
and improving decision-making, productivity, resilience, interpersonal communication, orga-
nizational relationships, perspective-taking, and self-care [10]. This great diversity in mindful-
ness interventions makes it difficult to compare the efficacy of such interventions.

There are many hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying mindfulness practice that
lead to different mental health outcomes. One hypothesis is that exposure to or willingness to
experience difficult emotions (e.g., anxiety, distress, anger), awareness of these emotions, and
observation of these emotions allow people to dis-identify with and better regulate difficult
emotions [5, 11]. Another is that awareness of thoughts, awareness of bodily sensations, and
self-compassion help people to deal with stress [5].

This systematic review will evaluate the effects of two types of group-based mindfulness
interventions—Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cogni-
tive Therapy (MBCT)–on employees’ mental health.

Definition of mindfulness

The concept of mindfulness has existed in Buddhist traditions for 2,500 years. Mindfulness
meditation is an attitude and a method for reducing personal suffering and developing insight,
compassion, and wisdom [12]. In contemporary psychology, mindfulness is seen as a means of
increasing awareness and responding optimally to mental processes that contribute to emo-
tional distress and maladaptive behavior [6].

Many definitions of mindfulness have been posited in the psychological literature [6, 13–
15]. Marlatt and Kristeller [13] described mindfulness as “bringing one’s complete attention to
the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis.” According to Brown and Ryan [14],
“mindfulness can be considered an enhanced attention to and awareness of current experience
or present reality.” ‘Awareness’ refers to the individual’s consciousness of what they are
experiencing, without those experiences being the center of attention. ‘Attention’ is the process
of focusing conscious awareness on specific experiences.

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

Bishop et al. [6] proposed a working definition of mindfulness with two components. The
first concerns the self-regulation of attention, which is focused on the immediate experience in
the present. The second involves having an open, curious, and accepting attitude towards that
experience. Kabat-Zinn [15] described mindfulness as “the awareness that emerges through
paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding
of experience moment by moment” (p. 145). This awareness can be aimed at internal experi-
ences (bodily sensations, feelings/emotions, and thoughts) and external experiences (what one
sees, hears, smells, tastes, and touches).

Shapiro and Carlson [16] defined mindfulness as “the awareness that arises through inten-

tionally attending in an open, caring, and discerning way.” This definition contains three
interrelated elements. The first element—intention—involves reflecting on one’s personal
goals and values, and paying attention to the most important things in accomplishing and
upholding them. The second element, attention (i.e., attending to experiences in the here and
now) is a prerequisite for seeing clearly. Finally, while intention refers to why we are paying
attention, the third element—attitude—relates to how we pay attention. It refers not to an
attempt to change things, but to an effort to relate to them in a non-judgmental way, with curi-
osity and compassion [10].

In this review article, we adopt Shapiro and Carlson’s [16] definition, which is an elabora-

tion of the commonly accepted definition by Kabat-Zinn [15].

Interventions based on Kabat-Zinn’s mindfulness training

The most common form of secular mindfulness-based training is Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR) training [17], developed by Kabat-Zinn [18]. MBSR aims to alleviate suffer-
ing [19] and was originally developed for patients with chronic pain. It consists of eight
2.5-hour weekly sessions and one 7-hour day of silence. A very important part of the training
is the homework: 45 minutes of daily exercise at home, 6 days a week, with the support of CDs
and set tasks. MBSR includes:

• the body scan (paying attention to what the body is feeling);

• sitting meditation (paying attention to breathing, sounds, thoughts, bodily sensations, feel-

ings/emotions);

• simple movement exercises such as walking or standing meditation, or lying yoga exercises

(paying attention to what the body is feeling; exploring and accepting borders);

• informal meditation exercises: paying full attention to daily activities (e.g., brushing one’s

teeth, taking a shower, eating).

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), which was developed by the cognitive
behavior therapists Segal, Williams, and Teasdale [20] on the basis of MBSR, is often used to
prevent relapse into depression [21–23]. In workplace settings, the focus is on distressing emo-
tional states rather than on clinical depression (e.g., see the pre-post study by Ruths et al. [24]).
MBCT has become the most important adaptation of MBSR [25], to which it is closely allied,
although there are a few differences. The CT component of the program includes psycho-edu-
cation about the nature of thoughts as mental events rather than facts, which fosters a decen-
tered attitude towards one’s own thoughts: thoughts are not facts; I am not my thoughts. The
link between thought and mood is made explicit in MBCT. Moreover, MBCT also introduces
a ‘mini-meditation’, known as the three-minute breathing space.

Other interventions incorporate mindfulness training as well, including Dialectical Behav-

ior Therapy for the treatment of clients with a borderline syndrome [26], Acceptance and

Commitment Therapy [27], and Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention [28]. As mindfulness
is only one component of the treatment in these interventions, they are not included in this
review.

MBSR and MBCT interventions are typically modified to suit the context in which they are

delivered (Table 1). Sessions can vary in number and duration; they may be face-to-face or
online, and involve less or more homework; and the retreat day may be dropped. In this study,
we include MBSR and MBCT interventions conducted in groups with at least four face-to-face
30-minute sessions.

Effects of mindfulness interventions on patients

Previous research on the effects of group-based mindfulness interventions has focused on ben-
efits for various patients groups (e.g., those with chronic pain, anxiety, eating and major
depressive disorders, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, or cancer [29]). These studies found that mind-
fulness decreases stress sensitivity [30–33], increases stress management [34], improves con-
centration [35], improves physical resilience [36–38], and reduces symptoms of anxiety and
depression [39–41]. More recent studies have reported positive effects of mindfulness inter-
ventions on chronic pain [42], immunity [43], generalized anxiety disorders [44], eating disor-
ders [45], depression relapse [21, 46], addiction [47], and fibromyalgia [48, 49]. In their meta-
analysis, Strauss et al. [50] identified potential benefits for depression, but not for anxiety
disorders.

Effects of mindfulness interventions on healthy people and professionals

Following on from the promising results for patients, MBSR and MBCT have recently also
been used for healthy people [51] and for employees and managers in a healthcare setting [52].
A meta-analysis by Chiesa and Serretti [51] focusing on healthy participants (not explicitly on
employees) identified ten studies on MBSR, most of them of low methodological quality. The
most striking outcome was the reduction of stress levels.

Employees and managers in a healthcare setting are regularly confronted with stress in the

form of physical and mental suffering as well as strong emotions (their own or those of their
patients) [53]. Adequate stress management can improve the health of these professionals [54]
and the quality of care they provide to patients [55].

Mindfulness training is assumed to also have potential for other demanding work environ-

ments, as a means of improving employees’ health and work engagement and, consequently,
the quality of services provided to clients. To date, however, there has been no systematic
review of studies investigating the effects of mindfulness training on the mental health of
employees across different occupational sectors.

The most commonly studied group of employees are healthcare professionals: four reviews
[52, 56–58] and two reviews/meta-analyses [59, 60] focused exclusively on healthcare profes-
sionals and students. Escuriex and Labbe´ [56] found no clear correlation between a therapist’s
mindfulness and treatment outcomes. Irving et al. [52] reported that MBSR benefits the physi-
cal and mental health of clinicians. Morgan et al. [57] discussed 14 qualitative studies and con-
cluded that the benefits of MBSR “ranged from increased personal well-being and self-
compassion to enhanced presence when relating to others, leading to enhanced compassion
and a sense of shared humanity” (p. 744). Smith [58], who examined nurses, concluded that
MBSR helps them deal with work-related stress. The meta-analysis by Regehr et al. [59] sup-
ports the idea that mindfulness interventions reduce stress, anxiety, and burnout among medi-
cal students and practicing physicians. Similarly, Burton et al.’s [60] meta-analysis suggests

that mindfulness training can significantly decrease stress levels among healthcare
professionals.

Virgili [61] performed a meta-analysis involving three subgroups of employees: healthcare
professionals, teachers, and general/office employees. The aim was to examine the effect of a
mindfulness-based intervention on a single outcome: employees’ psychological distress.
Unfortunately, the composition of the outcome ‘psychological distress’ was not explained and
no other outcomes, positive or negative, were considered [61].

Two other meta-analyses [51, 62] did not explicitly focus on employees. Grossman et al.
[62] examined a relatively small number of clinical and stressed non-clinical participants and
found possible benefits of MBSR. Finally, another recent review [63] provided strong evidence
that mindfulness-based interventions can reduce occupational burnout among healthcare pro-
fessionals and teachers.

Aim of the study

The aim of this systematic review is to gain deeper insight into the effects of two mindfulness
interventions—MBSR and MBCT training—on employees’ mental health across different
occupational sectors. Looking at different occupational sectors gives us an opportunity to
draw general conclusions about the effects of the interventions on employees and to identify
potential differences between sectors.

This review uses the World Health Organization’s (WHO) definition of mental health as “a

state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the
normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution
to his or her community” [64]. The WHO definition has three main components: emotional
or subjective well-being [65], psychological well-being (referring to optimal functioning in
work and life) [66], and social well-being (targeting optimal functioning in social groups and
society) [67].

Method

We conducted a systematic search of the literature with three rounds of screening. The flow
chart in Fig 1 outlines our review process and findings.

reference lists for additional studies (‘snowballing’ or ‘snowball’ method).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191332.g001

Search strategy

We searched three electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL) for scientific
studies examining the efficacy of MBSR and MBCT on employees’ mental health and well-
being. We used the following search string in each database: (Employees OR workers OR man-
agers OR professionals OR work OR labour OR labor OR job(cid:3) OR employ(cid:3) OR vocational(cid:3)) AND
(mindfulness OR mbsr OR mbct).

Search

All searches were performed in October 2015. The search in PsycINFO yielded 1790 articles.
The following procedure was used to screen them:

1. First screening of the titles/abstracts. Independent categorization (include, exclude, or

unclear) by three authors, as follows:

• The first author (MJ) screened all 1790 articles based on the titles and abstracts.

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191332 January 24, 2018

16 / 37

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

• To check the quality of this screening, the second (YH) and third (WK) authors indepen-
dently screened random samples from the 1790 articles; specifically, from every five arti-
cles, one abstract was randomly selected and screened. Any differences in opinion among
the three authors were discussed until consensus was reached.

2. Second screening of articles whose relevance was classed as ‘unclear’. All 32 articles were

independently screened by the first three authors as follows:

• Each author assessed each abstract and, if necessary, the entire article.

• Any differences in categorization were discussed until consensus was reached.

3. Third screening of all remaining articles. The first, second, and fifth authors (MJ/YH/JE)

assessed the full texts of the 18 articles initially labelled ‘include’ as follows:

• Each author independently assessed the articles.

• They then discussed each article until consensus was reached as to their in-/exclusion.

The same search string and screening procedure were used for the 451 and 223 articles

obtained from PubMed and CINAHL, respectively.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The following inclusion criteria were used for articles in the first and second screenings:

• Full text was available.

• Published in English.

• Mindfulness training (MBSR or MBCT) was operationalized as “moment to moment aware-
ness to be cultivated with a nonjudgmental attitude; teaching of formal meditation tech-
niques; and stressing the importance of daily and systematic practice” [16]. Once we had
compiled a set of eligible studies, we searched their reference lists for additional relevant
studies (‘snowball’ method). For articles that did not provide a definition of mindfulness
training, two criteria had to be met:

• References to relevant authors (e.g., Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ruth Baer, Mark Williams, John

Teasdale, Zindel Segal).

• Presence of the following elements in the mindfulness training: a focus on the ‘here and

now’, an emphasis on increasing consciousness, learning to use a nonjudgmental attitude,
learning formal meditation techniques, and daily and systematic practice.

• Study population: employees or managers in workplace settings.

• Group-based rather than individual interventions (i.e., no individual therapy or coaching).

• At least four face-to-face 30-minute sessions.

• Qualitative and/or quantitative work-related outcomes, including psychological/mental

factors.

The following exclusion criteria was used in the first and second screenings:

• Dissertations, conference papers, reviews, chapters in handbooks, editorials.

• Studies on forms of meditation that do not emphasize mindfulness, such as transcendental
meditation. In some meditation approaches, attention is directed towards one object or

stimulus, such as a word (a mantra), sound, or sensation. In contrast, mindfulness medita-
tion emphasizes the observation of constantly changing internal and external stimuli [29].

• Studies on the cognitive model of mindfulness developed by Ellen Langer [68, 69], which
involves working with external material such as information and includes active, goal-ori-
ented cognitive tasks, such as problem solving. We consider her approach to be distinct
from that used by other mindfulness studies.

• Studies on interventions that included mindfulness training as a component of a broader
treatment program, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy [26], Acceptance and Commit-
ment Therapy [27], and Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention [28].

• Population: employees with a specific mental or physical disorder and students/trainees.

• Pre-post design (i.e., without a control group) (see e.g. Bazarko et al. [70]).

The inclusion criteria for the third screening were:

• Description of qualitative and/or quantitative psychological/mental outcomes.

• Research design:

• Randomized controlled trial (RCT), or

• Quasi-experimental design with an intervention group and a control group, where the

control group comprised those on a waiting list or those receiving treatment as usual (e.g.,
relaxation practices, Jacobson relaxation, or an attention placebo) (quasi-RCT).

Methodological quality and levels of evidence

As indicated above, we included two types of research design—RCT and quasi-RCT—and
excluded pre-post studies. In RCT and quasi-RCT studies, participants in the control group
(CG) were compared with those in the treatment group (TG) both before and after the treat-
ment (T1 vs. T2, between-group analysis).

The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the nine criteria out-

lined in a paper entitled ‘Assessment of a randomized controlled trial’ by the Dutch public
health institute Kwaliteitsinstituut voor de Gezondheidszorg CBO [71]. The studies were clas-
sified as ‘high quality’ if they met (cid:21) 7 of the criteria, as ‘medium quality’ if they met 5 or 6 of
the criteria, and as ‘low quality’ if they met (cid:20) 4 of the criteria.

The nine criteria were formulated as closed questions with three possible answers: (1) yes,

(2) no, or (3) not enough information. The questions were as follows:

1. Were the participants randomly assigned to the intervention?

2. Was the researcher (or research assistant) who assigned the participants blinded to the ran-

domization order?

3. Were the participants blinded to the treatment?

4. Were the practitioners blinded to the treatment?

5. Were the assessors who evaluated the effects (i.e., mental health outcomes) of the treatment

blinded to the treatment?

6. Were the control and intervention groups comparable at the beginning of the trial?

7. Were enough participants available for follow-up after the intervention(s)?

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

8. Were the participants analyzed in the group in which they were randomized?

9. Were the groups treated in the same manner, except for the intervention(s)?

Domusmedica [72] outlines three levels for assessing the importance of outcomes. An out-
come can be classified as Level 1 (‘there is evidence for . . .’ / ‘it has been proven that . . .’) if at
least two high-quality RCTs show significance between groups (change in TG versus change in
CG). An outcome can be classified as Level 2 (‘it is plausible that . . .’) if at least two medium-
quality RCTs show significance between groups. Finally, an outcome can be classified as Level
3 (‘there are indications that . . .’) if at least one medium-quality RCT shows significance.

We used five levels of evidence based on the levels described above. Our definitions of Lev-

els 1 and 2 were the same as the Domusmedica definitions, although we found no outcome
that could be classified as Level 1 [72]. Our definition of Level 3 was slightly different: we clas-
sified an outcome as Level 3 if at least one medium-quality RCT or three low-quality experi-
ments (RCT, quasi-RCT) showed significance between groups (change in TG versus change in
CG). Level 4 (‘the evidence is weak’) outcomes refer to one or two low-quality experiments
(RCT, quasi-RCT) with significance between groups (change in TG versus change in CG).
Level 5 (‘there is no evidence’) indicates that there are no studies with significant results
between groups for the relevant outcome.

Results
Studies included

The results of the review process are shown in Fig 1. The PsycINFO search and three screen-
ings yielded 16 articles. The PubMed and CINAHL searches and screenings resulted in five
and three additional articles, respectively. We thus assessed 24 articles in total, describing 23
studies.

Characteristics of studies

Table 1 presents an overview of the 24 articles, including the number of participants and their
characteristics, the research design, treatment method, assessment instruments, and outcomes.
The 24 articles refer to 23 studies as two articles described the same study, presenting the quan-
titative [73] and qualitative [74] data separately.

All studies primarily focused on MBSR. One study used MBSR in combination with some
aspects of MBCT [75]. As this modified MBSR program was developed for healthy rather than
depressive teachers, this study was nevertheless included. The MBSR program of the other 22
studies varied: 1 used an extended MBSR program [7], 8 used a shortened MBSR program [8,
76–82], 2 studies also used a modified MBSR program [83, 84], and the other 11 used the usual
MBSR program [9, 53, 73, 85–92]. As no study concentrated exclusively on MBCT, we will not
address MBCT in the rest of this paper.

Of the 23 studies, 13 were RCTs [7, 53, 73, 76, 78–82, 84, 87–89] and 10 were quasi-RCTs
[8, 9, 75, 77, 83, 85, 86, 90–92]. Three [77, 86, 90] had no intervention for the control group.
One study [8] had two control groups: one with an additional treatment and one with no inter-
vention. Another study had three treatment groups and a control group with no intervention
[82]. The other 18 studies [7, 9, 53, 73, 75, 76, 78–81, 83–85, 87–89, 91, 92] had a ‘waiting-list
control’ (i.e., they did not include an additional treatment intervention to control for factors
such as trainer support, group support, and home practice).

Sample sizes and composition also varied. The sample sizes in 11 studies [7, 8, 53, 73, 76–
79, 81, 85, 92] were relatively small: the group sizes (TG and CG) ranged from 10 to 24 partici-
pants. The most frequently studied research populations were healthcare professionals (12

studies) [7, 53, 73, 76, 77, 79–81, 84, 86, 90, 91] (e.g., nurses, nurse aides, nursing leaders, phy-
sicians, social workers, psychologists, psychotherapists, physical therapists, psychiatrists) and
teachers (five studies) [75, 83, 85, 88, 89]. Five studies [7, 8, 79, 81, 85] involved participants
with the same occupation; four studies [83, 85, 88, 89] investigated respondents from related
occupations (i.e., elementary, secondary, or high school teachers). In the other studies, the par-
ticipants’ occupations varied.

Participants’ personal characteristics were also diverse. Twenty of the 23 studies included
more female than male participants; only Huang et al. [87] reported more male participants,
while the other two studies did not indicate the gender of the participants [53, 84]. The mean
age of participants was over 40 years in 15 studies [7–9, 73, 76, 78, 79, 81, 82, 85–90], less than
40 years in four studies [80, 83, 91, 92], and not stated in four studies [53, 75, 77, 84]. Twenty
studies were primarily quantitative, and only three contained a substantial amount of qualita-
tive data [73, 89, 92].

Quality of the studies

Table 2 shows the classification of the studies as ‘high quality,’ ‘medium quality,’ or ‘low qual-
ity.’ Two studies were of high quality [76, 87], 15 were of medium quality [7, 9, 53, 73, 78–83,
85, 88–91], and six were of low quality [8, 75, 77, 84, 86, 92].

The effects of MBSR on employees’ mental health

This section describes the effects of MBSR on employees’ mental health in the 23 studies
reviewed. Several studies, e.g., Klatt et al. [78], Wolever et al. [82] and Geary and Rosenthal
[86], also measured stress biomarkers (e.g., salivary cortisol, pulse rate and heart rate vari-
ability), but the effects of MBSR on such biomarkers fall outside the scope of our discussion.
The mental health outcomes are presented in order of importance, taking into account two
criteria. First and foremost is the level of evidence; the second criterion refers to the number
of studies reporting a particular (significant or non-significant) result. When two effects
have the same level of evidence from the same number of studies, they are described in
alphabetical order.

Almost 35 mental/psychological outcomes were identified, some of them overlapping (e.g.,
stress and occupational stress, or mood and depression). Some outcomes were measured using
different assessment instruments: e.g., stress level by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS); burnout by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)
and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOF) scale.

All results are presented in Table 3. Results classified as Levels 3, 4, or 5 and reported in a

single study only are mentioned in Table 3, but not discussed further in the text.

1. Mindfulness. Fourteen of the studies reviewed measured the effect of MBSR on mind-
fulness [7, 9, 73, 75–78, 80, 82, 83, 85, 88, 90, 91] (see Table 3). In three studies [7, 9, 73], mind-
fulness significantly increased in the TG (within-group) and in the TG compared to the CG
(between-groups). One study [77] reported no significant results; another [76] reported no
results. The other nine studies mentioned a significant increase in the TG compared to the
CG.

Nine studies [8, 53, 79, 81, 84, 86, 87, 89, 92] did not include a measure of mindfulness. In

summary, it is plausible that MBSR significantly increases the amount of mindfulness (evi-
dence Level 2).

2. Burnout. Nine studies examined the effects of MBSR on burnout symptoms [8, 53, 73,

76, 79, 83, 85, 88, 90]. The three main symptoms of burnout are emotional exhaustion, (job-

only reported on burnout in general. Five [8, 73, 76, 79, 83] reported the effects of MBSR on
the three symptoms, but not on burnout in general. One study [90] dealt both with burnout in
general and with the individual symptoms.

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

• Burnout in general: two studies reported a significant reduction in the TG [88, 90]; two

reported no significant outcome [53, 85].

• Emotional exhaustion: two studies [8, 73] reported a significant reduction in the TG and in
the TG compared to the CG. Two studies [79, 90] showed a significant reduction in the TG
compared to the CG after the intervention. Two studies [76, 83] reported no significant
outcome.

• (Job-related) personal accomplishment: levels increased significantly within-group and

between-groups in three studies [73, 79, 83]. One study identified a significant increase in
the TG [90], while two studies [8, 76] reported no significant differences.

• Depersonalization: one study [90] showed a significant reduction after the treatment in the
TG and in the TG compared to the CG. In another study [79], depersonalization remained
stable in the TG before and after the intervention (positive result), and increased signifi-
cantly in the CG. Three other studies [73, 76, 83] reported no significant changes in
depersonalization.

In summary, it is plausible that MBSR results in increased (job-related) personal accom-
plishment and decreased burnout in general and emotional exhaustion (evidence Level 2).
There are indications that MBSR causes a decrease in depersonalization (cynicism and lack of
empathy) (evidence Level 3).

3. Stress level. Stress level, measured as perceived stress (mostly by the PSS), was investi-
gated in nine studies [53, 75–78, 80, 82, 86, 87]. Eight studies reported a significant reduction
in stress level after the intervention in the TG compared to the CG; one study [77] found no
significant outcome. In summary, it is plausible that MBSR helps to reduce stress levels (evi-
dence Level 2).

4. Psychological distress. Eight studies investigated the effects of MBSR on psychological

distress [53, 73, 80, 81, 85–87, 92]. Psychological distress was mostly measured by the Brief
Symptom Inventory (BSI), which consists of 10 subscales reflecting different mood states (e.g.,
anxiety, depression, total mood disturbance). Three studies [80, 86, 87] showed a significant
reduction in psychological distress in the TG and in the TG compared to CG; one study [81]
mentioned a significant reduction in the TG. The other four studies reported no significant
differences. In summary, it is plausible that MBSR results in a decrease of psychological dis-
tress (evidence Level 2).

5. Depression. Depression was examined in five studies [82, 83, 88, 90, 91]. Two studies
[88, 91] found a significant decrease of depression in the TG and in the TG compared to CG,
one study [90] reported a significant reduction in the TG, and the other two studies [82, 83]
mentioned no significant results. In summary, it is plausible that MBSR results in decreased
levels of depression (evidence Level 2).

6. (Occupational) self-compassion. Three studies addressed self-compassion, measured

by the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) [53, 75, 85], and one study addressed occupational
self-compassion, measured by a modification of the SCS for teachers [88]. All four studies
reported a significant increase in self-compassion in the TG and in the TG compared to the
CG. Cohen-Katz et al.’s [74] qualitative study described an improvement in self-care resulting
from MBSR: “I’m worrying about my own needs first, and trying to take care of them” (p. 82).
Self-care can lead to feelings of guilt [74]: “they want to fix everyone else in the group!”, as one
participant stated, “it’s the nurse in me!” (p. 85). In summary, it is plausible that MBSR leads to
a significant increase in self-compassion (evidence Level 2).

7. Quality of sleep. Three studies [78, 82, 85] investigated quality of sleep using the Pitts-
burgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which consists of seven subscales: general (subjective) sleep

quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of medi-
cation to sleep, and daytime sleep-related dysfunction. Frank et al. [85] reported significant
improvements in the TG compared to the CG in all aspects except for sleep efficiency and the
use of medication to sleep. Wolever et al. [82] reported significant reductions in sleep difficulty
in the TG compared to the CG.

Klatt et al. [78] found a significant improvement in the TG in terms of subjective sleep qual-

ity, sleep latency, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction (i.e., four of the seven compo-
nents of sleep quality). Changes in global sleep scores (PSQI) were significant for both the TG
and the CG. Klatt et al. [78] suggested that the improvements in subjective sleep quality may
be the study’s most important result.

In summary, it is plausible that MBSR gives rise to a significant increase in quality of sleep
(evidence Level 2). However, it is not possible to provide insight into the different components
of sleep quality.

8. Relaxation. Three studies measured relaxation [7, 8, 79] and all found significant
changes in relaxation in the TG compared to the CG. Cohen-Katz et al.’s [74] qualitative data
also showed an increase in relaxation/calmness: “I’m feeling a greater calm and peace” (p. 82).
Thus, it is plausible that MBSR produces a significant increase in relaxation (evidence Level 2).
9. Anxiety. Two studies measured anxiety [88, 91] and both showed a significant decrease

in anxiety in the TG compared to the CG. It is therefore plausible that MBSR causes a signifi-
cant decrease in anxiety (evidence Level 2).

10. Occupational stress. Two studies [88, 89] specifically measured occupational stress
(i.e., stress employees experience on the job). Both reported a significant reduction in occupa-
tional stress after the intervention in the TG compared to the CG. In summary, it is plausible
that MBSR causes a reduction in occupational stress level (evidence Level 2).

11. Life satisfaction. Eight studies examined the effects of MBSR on general life satisfac-
tion [8, 53, 75–77, 79, 86, 92]. Four [8, 75, 79, 86] reported significant positive changes in life
satisfaction or general well-being in the TG compared to the CG. By contrast, four studies [53,
76, 77, 92] reported no significant improvement in terms of life satisfaction. In summary,
there are indications that MBSR leads to an increase in life satisfaction (evidence Level 3).

12. Mood. Mood was examined in two of the studies [83, 90]. Martı´n-Asuero et al. [90]
used a short version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), which consists of five subscales that
measure negative emotions. They reported a significant reduction of total mood disturbance
in the TG and in the TG compared to the CG. Jennings et al. [83] used the Positive and Nega-
tive Affect Schedule (PANAS), which measures positive and negative effects, and found no sig-
nificant outcomes.

One qualitative study [74] described an improved ability to deal with difficult emotions fol-

lowing MBSR. In summary, there are indications that MBSR has a positive effect on mood
(evidence Level 3).

13. Efficacy in regulating emotions at work. Two studies [85, 89] measured employees’
perceived self-efficacy regarding their ability to regulate their emotions on the job. Frank et al.
[85] reported a significant improvement in the TG compared to the CG; Taylor et al. [89]
showed a significant increase in the TG. In summary, it is plausible that MBSR improves effi-
cacy in regulating emotions at work (evidence Level 3).

14. Self-efficacy/locus of control. Self-efficacy was investigated in two studies [83, 92].

Jennings et al. [83] mentioned a significant increase in the TG compared to the CG, while
Walach et al. [92] reported no significant changes. In summary, there are indications that
MBSR causes an increase in self-efficacy in general (evidence Level 3).

15. Work engagement. Work engagement was measured in two studies [9, 84]. Leroy
et al. [9] showed a significant increase in work engagement for the group as a whole between

T1 and T2; the increase in the TG compared to the CG appeared to be significantly higher.
Klatt et al. [84] reported a significant increase in work engagement in the TG, mostly induced
by the vigor subscale (a subscale of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, UWES). In summary,
there are indications that MBSR produces a significant increase in work engagement (evidence
Level 3).

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of the mental health of employees across
different occupational sectors. We identified 24 articles representing 23 studies on the effects
of MBSR (2 high quality, 15 medium quality, and 6 low quality) published before October
2015.

Demanding workplace challenges can produce stress and symptoms of burnout [93]. In the

Netherlands, the professionals reporting the highest levels of work pressure and stress are
teachers and healthcare providers [94], and teachers appear to have the highest burnout per-
centage in the Dutch workforce [95]. Burnout is a major cause of loss of engagement, disease,
and disability [96].

There is a great need for useful, practical workplace interventions that could reduce stress
and enhance work engagement. Kabat-Zinn [18], who introduced the concept of mindfulness,
suggested its possible use as a person-centered intervention. This study was aimed at investi-
gating empirically whether MBSR and MBCT indeed contribute to employees’ mental health.

General findings

Measuring mindfulness. Fourteen of the 23 studies reviewed [7, 9, 73, 75–78, 80, 82, 83,
85, 88, 90, 91] measured levels of mindfulness; 9 did not. This is striking because, as Cohen-
Katz et al. [73] points out, measuring mindfulness is important to determining whether an
MBSR program has successfully taught what it was designed to teach. Mindfulness skills may
be the mediating factor for individual outcomes such as stress reduction, relaxation, and empa-
thy [97]. Indeed, Baer [29] highlighted several mechanisms that might account for how mind-
fulness skills can reduce symptoms and bring about behavioral change: exposure, cognitive
change, self-management, relaxation, and acceptance.

Three different mindfulness measures were used in the studies we reviewed: five used the

Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), eight used the Five Facets Mindfulness
Questionnaire (FFMQ) with five subscales, and one used the Cognitive and Affective Mindful-
ness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R). These three scales correspond with different definitions of
mindfulness. In the MAAS, mindfulness is operationalized as a one-dimensional construct
involving attention and awareness. The FFMQ, which encompasses five dimensions of mind-
fulness, also includes an attitudinal component. The CAMS-R, which assesses four elements of
mindfulness, yields only one score [98]. The use of different ways of operationalizing mindful-
ness makes it difficult to compare its effects. In addition, mindfulness can be said to be both an
outcome variable of interest and an important mechanism of the therapeutic agent.

The advantage of the FFMQ is the fact that Baer’s [29] five subscales result in a sophisticated

measurement of mindfulness. As it is based on a factor analysis of items from the five most
widely used mindfulness questionnaires, it can also be considered particularly robust [99, 100].
Other outcomes. Most of the variables were assessed using negative symptom-focused

outcome measures (e.g., burnout, stress level, psychological distress, depression, anxiety),
while some used positive symptom-focused outcome measures (e.g., quality of sleep, relaxa-
tion, work engagement, job satisfaction). There were hardly any symptom-focused outcome

measures relating to work performance (e.g., caring efficacy, work behavior, work perfor-
mance, workability).

Few variables, except for mindfulness skills (observing, describing, acting with awareness,
non-judging, non-reactivity), were assessed using process-focused measures. They may have
been more suitable for capturing the mechanisms by which mindfulness practice leads to spe-
cific outcomes (e.g., (occupational) self-compassion, (occupational) self-efficacy, sense of
coherence, coping strategies, ruminating). Specifically, four of the studies [53, 75, 85, 88]
reported a significant increase in self-compassion in the TG compared with the CG. In another
study, Shapiro et al. [11] reported that MBSR weakens stimulus-response relationships,
thereby reducing reflexive behavior. This was associated with increased levels of self-manage-
ment, self-efficacy, and self-care.

Self-care can be challenging for healthcare professionals and others engaged in people-cen-

tered work (e.g., teachers), as their job is to care for others. A lack of self-care can eventually
undermine health and, as a result, sustainable employability [101]. Thus, employees’ self-care
is a highly important topic that deserves more attention within organizations. Our findings
suggest that it might be increased by means of mindfulness training.

Behavioral variables, such as assessments of the quality and quantity of formal and informal

meditation (e.g., frequency and intensity of practice) were measured in only three studies [9,
74, 92].

Self-reported measures are inherently biased because participants who have invested a lot
of time and energy in a treatment program, such as MBSR, are less likely to give negative evalu-
ations [102]. Therefore, behavioral reports by relevant others may be a useful addition.

A few outcomes in our review refer to perceptions of work characteristics (e.g., work rela-
tionships, job control, job demands). However, many other possible work-related perceptions
were not measured (e.g., work pressure, emotional load, feedback, autonomy, learning oppor-
tunities). Further empirical work on the effects of mindfulness on perceptions of work could
be revealing.

Future research on mindfulness treatments for employees may benefit from assessing a
diversity of outcomes: negative and positive symptom-focused measures of mental health
(mood, recovery need, job satisfaction, work engagement) and work performance (positive
and negative work behavior, absence from work); process-focused outcome measures; behav-
ioral measures of (in)formal practices; behavioral reports by relevant others (e.g., colleagues);
and outcomes on work-related perceptions. Finally, future research may include outcomes dif-
ferentiating between elements of mindfulness interventions, as these remain something of a
black box thus far in terms of their working mechanisms.

MBCT. Our search method, which included both MBSR and MBCT programs, uncovered

only one study [75] exploring the effects of a modified MBSR program in combination with
some aspects of MBCT on employees. MBCT is often used in clinical settings to prevent
depression relapse [20]. However, it could also be useful for employees, especially those who
experience non-productive or irrational thoughts, which can cause stress. Two examples of
excluded pre-post studies focusing exclusively on the effects of MBCT on employees are Ruths
et al. [24] and Schenstro¨m et al. [103]. Future research on the impact of MBCT on employees
is needed to compare its efficacy to that of MBSR.

Contraindications. None of the studies we reviewed reported that MBSR training nega-
tively affected employees. The absence of empirical evidence on potentially harmful effects of
MBSR [104] does not mean it is good for everyone in every situation; instead, potentially
harmful effects should be thoroughly evaluated in future work. Ruths et al. [24], who investi-
gated the effects of MBCT on 27 mental-health professionals in a pre-post study (which was
therefore excluded from our study), mentioned depersonalization and initial mood

deterioration as potentially harmful effects of meditation. Participants with severe trauma or
those at risk for psychosis might be at elevated risk [49]. Dobkin et al. [104] made several
recommendations in this regard, including pre-program screening to “assess the patient’s abil-
ity to: (1) contain affect; (2) listen and respond in the present; (3) utilize instructional audio
tapes and follow classroom instruction; (4) remain in the classroom; (5) practice yoga or equiv-
alent; and (6) organize thoughts, manage logistics, and time commitment” (p. 4). Nonetheless,
there is little empirical research on and evidence for the harmful effects of mindfulness train-
ing [49].

Methodological issues

Despite the promising findings of the studies in our review, our approach has some limitations
which make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the effects of MBSR on employees.

Meta-analysis versus systematic review. We chose to conduct a systematic review instead

of a meta-analysis for four reasons. First, the quality of the studies conducted so far is limited;
we only found 2 studies that could be classified as of high methodological quality, while 15
were of medium quality and 6 were of low quality (Table 2).

Second, mindfulness training is an emergent, relatively uncharted field of investigation,
with a broad variety of outcome measures. Only 7 variables were examined in four or more
studies, 8 in two or three studies, and 22 in one study only (Table 3). We intended to explore
several negative and positive symptom-focused outcomes on mental health and work perfor-
mance; in particular, positive and negative process-focused outcomes and positive and nega-
tive outcomes related to work characteristics. Furthermore, we wanted to use quantitative and
qualitative data.

Third, the samples in 11 of the studies reviewed were relatively small, ranging from just 10

to 24 participants.

Finally, the 2 high-quality studies and 15 medium-quality studies appeared to have similar

outcome variables in a few cases (as shown in Table 1).

The (lack of) clarity around the outcome variables. We identified many mental/psycho-

logical outcomes which sometimes partly overlapped (e.g., stress and occupational stress;
mood and depression; efficacy in regulating emotions at work and self-efficacy/locus of con-
trol). Occupational stress refers to only one cause of stress, while depression is just one aspect
of mood, measured by five subscales (tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility,
vigor-activity, and fatigue-inertia) of the Profile of Mood States (POMS). In a similar vein, effi-
cacy in regulating emotions at work appears to be a single dimension of self-efficacy/locus of
control.

In some cases, outcomes were measured using different assessment instruments. For exam-

ple, mood was measured by the POMS, which consists of five subscales, and by the Positive
and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), which consists of two corresponding subscales. Mindful-
ness was measured by the one-dimensional MAAS, the five-dimensional FFMQ or the
CAMS-R, with its four elements of mindfulness.

Sometimes the distinction between outcomes was unclear. For example, there is no clear
distinction between mood, measured by a short version of the POMS [90], and psychological
distress, measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The BSI consists of 10 subscales
reflecting different mood states, such as anxiety, depression, and total mood disturbance. The
POMS consists of five subscales measuring negative emotions.

As already mentioned, three of the studies reviewed [53, 85, 88] reported only on burnout
in general. Five studies [8, 73, 76, 79, 83] reported on the three dimensions of burnout but not
on burnout in general. One study [90] dealt with both types of outcomes.

28 / 37

MBSR and employees’ mental health: A systematic review

There is a need for unambiguous, clear outcomes that are logically clustered (e.g., process
and effect outcomes; mental-health and work-performance outcomes; positive and negative
outcomes; work-related perceptions outcomes; individual and organizational outcomes) and
measured by reliable and valid assessment instruments.

Publication bias. All the studies except one [77] reported statistically significant outcomes

(Table 3). Three studies (12.9%) [76, 81, 92] mentioned only one significant outcome, three
(12.9%) [7, 53, 84] mentioned two significant outcomes, and the other 16 studies (68.8%)
reported at least three significant outcomes. The multitude of significant results ought to be
seen in the context of the small sample sizes used in most of the studies, and the medium and
low methodological quality of 15 and 6 studies, respectively, leaving them with relatively low
statistical power. It may also reflect some form of publication bias, as studies with positive
results tend to be published more easily than studies with negative results [105].

Short- and long-term effects. Little research has considered the long-term effects of
mindfulness interventions. Fourteen of the studies reviewed measured short-term effects only
[8, 53, 75–80, 82–85, 90, 91], as their final measurements were conducted immediately after
the intervention. The other nine studies measured the effects over a longer period: eight weeks
to four months post-intervention for six studies [9, 73, 87–89, 92], and almost one year post-
intervention in three studies [7, 81, 86]. Mindfulness training for employees should ideally
result in sustainable long-term effects. Therefore, both short- and long-term effects of the
MBSR program for employees need to be considered in future research.

Length of treatment program. Nine of the studies reviewed [8, 75–82] used shortened
MBSR treatment programs. Two used a modified MBSR program [83, 84], and one used an
extended MBSR program [7]. The other 11 studies used the usual MBSR program [9, 53, 73,
85–92].

Due to the different lengths of the programs, we cannot safely conclude anything about the

effects of program length on the results. However, it is important to note that seven of the
eight shortened MBSR studies (all except Pipe et al. [81]) only measured short-term effects. As
Carmody and Baer [106] stated, “the effect of variation in class hours on outcomes has not
been systematically studied” (p. 627). They did not find a significant correlation between the
number of in-class hours and the mean effect size in clinical or non-clinical samples. Studies
on very brief mindfulness interventions in lab settings found temporary effects on emotion
[107], mood, and stress [108, 109]. Increases tend to be found in state (present) mindfulness
rather than trait (more permanent) mindfulness [5]. Bear, Carmody, and Hunsinger [110]
revealed that structural changes in perceived stress did not occur until week four of the mind-
fulness training. Changing problematic, automatic patterns of thought and behavior takes
time, and mindfulness is no quick solution.

Carmody and Bear suggested that “adaptations that include less class time may be worth-
while for populations for whom reduction of psychological distress is an important goal and
for whom longer time commitment may be a barrier to their ability or willingness to partici-
pate” [106]. In Shapiro et al.’s [53] study, 8 of the 18 participants dropped out of the treatment
group. The authors concluded that “adding a 2-hour intervention plus daily home practice to
an already demanding schedule may not be feasible for a substantial number of health care
professionals” (p. 172). Kabat-Zinn [111] emphasized the importance of flexibility in the
MBSR program in different contexts. The original MBSR program with eight 2.5-hour ses-
sions, a 7-hour day of silence, and 45 minutes of daily practice at home seems to be too
demanding for busy workers [17]. Chaskalson et al. [17] indicated that although the number
of organizations offering MBSR is increasing, they all use a format with fewer and shorter ses-
sions. There is a growing need to adapt the duration and dose of the MBSR program to differ-
ent workplace contexts, in order to better get to grips with its effectiveness.

Another consideration regarding the treatment schedule is whether parts of the program
are difficult to adhere to (e.g., regular class attendance, daily home practice, formal and infor-
mal meditation exercises). Only Cohen-Katz et al. [74] collected qualitative data to this end.
More research is needed on this issue, and to determine whether a shortened version of the
MBSR program would produce the same short- and long-term effects.

Level of evidence. The level of evidence that we were able to obtain was based on the
number of studies investigating a certain variable (see Table 3) and the quality of those studies
(see Table 2). Only seven variables were examined in four or more studies, eight variables in
two or three studies, and 22 variables in just one study (Table 3). We only found evidence that
met the requirements for Levels 2 through 5; we found no evidence meeting the requirements
for Level 1. Future studies should seek to generate Level 1 evidence from high-quality RCTs.

Small sample sizes. The sample sizes of 11 studies [7, 8, 53, 73, 76–79, 81, 85, 92] were rel-

atively small: the group sizes (TG and CG) ranged from 10 to 24 non-clinical participants. As
statistical significance is essential to the interpretation of findings, future empirical work
should be conducted using larger sample sizes.

Homogeneous and heterogeneous samples. The research populations included in our
review mainly comprised healthcare professionals (12 studies) [7, 53, 73, 76, 77, 79–81, 84, 86,
90, 91]. Five studies examined teachers [75, 83, 85, 88, 89].

Five studies [7, 8, 79, 81, 85] had homogeneous participant samples in terms of occupation.
Three studies [83, 88, 89] had broadly homogeneous samples, in that they investigated related
occupations (i.e., elementary, secondary, and high school teachers). The other studies [9, 53,
73, 75–78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 87, 90–92] had mixed/heterogeneous samples with various participant
occupations.

Future research may benefit from using more homogeneous samples (e.g., workers in
healthcare, education, or finance), as these groups have specific demands and challenges with
respect to the outcomes of MBSR treatment.

Employees. As previously mentioned, the samples in the studies reviewed largely con-
sisted of healthcare professionals and elementary, secondary, and high school teachers. They
do not represent the target population of employees in general. Therefore, more research
across different occupational sectors is needed to generalize our conclusions. It may be that
including terms such as ‘business’ or ‘corporate’ in our search string would have yielded addi-
tional references.

Self-selection bias. A major limitation of all the studies reviewed is self-selection, as vol-

untary participation by employees may result in somewhat biased samples. Specifically, the
characteristics of employees who participate in such research (e.g., motivation, sensitivity to
the MBSR program, discipline) may differ from those who do not. Self-selection bias thus
complicates the evaluation of the MBSR program and the interpretation of results.

Quantitative and qualitative data. Future research may benefit from mixed-methods
approaches that combine quantitative and quantitative data. To date such a combination is
lacking in the literature.

Twenty of the studies reviewed contained mostly quantitative data, while only three [73, 89,

92] contained a substantial amount of qualitative data. We found one qualitative review, by
Morgan et al. [57], which synthesized 14 qualitative studies on the experiences of health-care
professionals and students with mindfulness training and discussed issues such as self-compas-
sion, initial challenges to practice, training focus, and participant motivation.

Since mindfulness research on employees across occupational sectors is a relatively new
phenomenon, qualitative data are needed to be able to investigate in depth whether an inter-
vention significantly affects process-focused personal measures (e.g., mindfulness skills, coping
strategies) and to capture the mechanisms by which mindfulness practice leads to specific

outcomes. For example, unresolved or suppressed emotions may resurface during mindfulness
training, contributing to self-consciousness. As Cohen-Katz et al. [74] write, “For the partici-
pants (i.e. nurses), becoming aware of the wound was both painful and ultimately extremely
useful, helping them to move forward in their lives” (p. 86).

Qualitative data are also needed to thoroughly investigate key aspects of the mindfulness
training program and to examine those factors that lead to successful implementation in an
organization (e.g., allocating staff time to participate, support of superiors).

Additional organizational intervention. Stress is the result of a complex interaction
between environmental factors (work and personal circumstances) and the individual [96,
112]. Interventions designed to reduce stress have generally targeted either the relevant envi-
ronmental factors or the individual, personal factors.

Person-centered interventions seem to be only partly effective in influencing mental health

and well-being [113]. An integrated approach is needed that considers not only the person,
but the work context as well [114]: for instance, by combining a person-centered intervention
such as mindfulness with an additional organizational intervention. None of the studies
reviewed used such an additional intervention, which may enhance the effects of the mindful-
ness intervention.

MBSR program and instructor skill. Specific characteristics of the programs used, such

as the instructors’ skill levels, may influence the efficacy of MBSR treatment. None of the 23
studies described the MBSR program in terms of its form, content, procedures, or material.
Several studies described the instructors as “experienced,” but the term was not well-defined.
Future studies would benefit from a full explanation of both the MBSR program and the
instructors’ skill levels.

Conclusions

Our systematic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL resulted in 24 articles
representing 23 studies on the effects of MBSR and MBCT. Their methodological quality var-
ied: 2 were of high quality, 15 of medium quality and 6 of low quality. Given the low number
of studies and relatively low methodological quality, it is clear that research on the effects of
mindfulness on employees remains a relatively uncharted area.

The outcomes of the studies reviewed suggest that MBSR may help to improve employees’

psychological functioning. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects of
specific mindfulness programs for different groups and/or under specific conditions.

The strongest outcomes were decreased levels of emotional exhaustion (a dimension of

burnout), stress, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and occupational stress.

We also found a significant increase in mindfulness, personal accomplishment (a dimen-

sion of burnout), (occupational) self-compassion, quality of sleep, and relaxation.
