Abstract

Objectives—Dignity Therapy is a unique, individualized, brief psychotherapy, developed for
patients (and their families) living with life threatening or life limiting illness. The purpose of this
study was to determine if Dignity Therapy could mitigate distress and/or bolster end-of-life
experience for patients nearing death.

Trial Design—Multi-site randomized controlled trial, with patients assigned to Dignity Therapy,
Client Centred Care or Standard Palliative Care. Study arm assignment was based on a computer-
generated table of random numbers. Blinding was achieved using opaque sealed envelopes,
containing allocations that were only opened once consent had been obtained.

Participants—Patients receiving hospital or community (hospice or home) based palliative care,
in Winnipeg, New York, or Perth, randomly assigned to, Dignity Therapy [n=108], Client
Centered Care [n=107] and Standard Palliative Care (n=111).

Main Outcome Measures—The primary outcome measures included the FACIT Spiritual
Well-Being Scale, the Patient Dignity Inventory, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;
items from the Structured Interview for Symptoms and Concerns, the Quality of Life Scale and a
modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Mean changes between baseline and end of
intervention ratings were determined. Secondary outcomes, examining self-report end-of-life
experience, consisted of a post-study survey administered across all study arms.

Intervention—Dignity Therapy, a novel, brief psychotherapy, provides patients with life
threatening and life limiting illnesses an opportunity to speak about things that matter most to
them. These recorded conversations form the basis of a generativity document, which patients can
bequeath to individuals of their choosing. Client Centred Care is a supportive psychotherapeutic
approach, in which research nurse/therapists guide patients through discussions focusing on here
and now issues.

Findings—No significant differences across study arms, between the primary study outcome
measures of pre and post distress, were found. However, on the secondary outcomes, comprised of
the post study survey, patients reported that Dignity Therapy was significantly more likely to be
experienced as helpful (χ2=35.501; p<0.001), improve quality of life (χ2 =14.520; p<0.001), sense
of dignity (χ2 =12.655; p=0.002); change how their family sees and appreciates them (χ2 =33.811;
p<0.001) and be helpful to their family (χ2=33.864; p<0.001).

Interpretation—Despite the beneficial effects of Dignity Therapy, its ability to mitigate outright
distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be proven. However, there is
currently ample evidence supporting its clinical application for patients nearing death, as a means
of enhancing their end-of-life experience.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing literature exploring ways of understanding and supporting patients facing
end-of-life.1–3 Dignity Therapy, a unique, individualized, brief psychotherapy, was
developed for the purpose of relieving distress and enhancing end-of-life experience for
patients nearing death. While the intervention itself has been previously described, in brief,
Dignity Therapy provides patients near the end-of-life an opportunity to reflect on things
that matter most to them or that they would most want remembered.4 A framework of
questions (Table 1), based on an empirical model of dignity in the terminally ill, informs the
basic content of the therapeutic process.5,6 These conversations, guided by a trained
therapist, are flexible so as to accommodate the patient's needs and choices regarding what
they specifically wish to address. Dignity Therapy is audio-recorded and transcribed, with
an edited version of the transcript returned to patients to share or bequeath to individuals of
their choice.

A previous Phase I trial of Dignity Therapy, with of a sample of one-hundred terminally ill
patients, reported 91% percent being satisfied with the therapy; 76% reported a heightened
sense of dignity; 68%, an increased sense of purpose; 67%, a heightened sense of meaning;
47%, an increased will to live; and 81% indicated that it had been or would be of help to
their family. Post-intervention measures of suffering and depressive symptoms showed
modest, albeit significant improvement.4 Family members of patients also found dignity
therapy helpful: 78% found that it enhanced patient dignity, 72% reported that it heightened
the meaning of life for the patient, 78% said the document produced from the therapy
session was a comfort to them in their time of grief, and 95% stated they would recommend
Dignity Therapy for other patients and families.7

In view of the initial promise of Dignity Therapy, this study was conducted in order to
examine its performance under randomized controlled conditions. Our primary objective
was to determine if Dignity Therapy could lessen various dimensions of distress (e.g.
depression, suffering), while our secondary objective was to determine if Dignity Therapy
could enhance the quality of the dying experience, such as improving quality of life and
sense of dignity, compared to two other conditions; standard palliative care and client
centred care, as described below.

METHODS

Participants

Participants were recruited between April 2005 and October 2008, and eligible if they had a
terminal prognosis with a life expectancy of six months or less, as determined by their
treating physician; if they were receiving palliative care services through an affiliated
recruitment site; if they were 18 years of age or greater; if they were willing to commit to 3
to 4 contacts over approximately 7 to 10 days; and if they were able and willing to provide
written informed consent. Participants were excluded if they were delirious or otherwise
cognitively impaired (based on clinical consensus and post randomization Blessed
Orientation Memory Concentration test [BOMC]),8 if they were too unwell to complete the
requirements of the protocol; or if they were unable to speak and read English.

Ethics Committee Approval: This trial was coordinated by the Manitoba Palliative Care
Research Unit at CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Other participating centres
included Curtin University, Perth, Australia and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre,
New York, USA. Approval was obtained from the ethics committees of all participating
centres.

The funders played no role in the study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation of
the data; nor in the writing of the final report. The corresponding author had full access to all
of the data and the final responsibility to submit for publication.

Study Arm Descriptions

After providing written informed consent, all participants were randomly assigned to one of
three study arms; Dignity Therapy, Client Centred Care or Standard Palliative Care and
asked to complete base-line psychosocial questionnaires.

Dignity Therapy—Patients randomized to Dignity Therapy were assigned a dignity
therapist, comprised of a psychologist, psychiatrist or experienced palliative care nurse. All
therapists took part in a three day training workshop, led by the PI (HMC). Ongoing Dignity
Therapy supervision was provided by each site PI (HMC, LK, WB), initially on every case
and than at varying degrees of frequency, until individual therapist competence was
achieved. Group supervision, led by the PI, took place every six to eight weeks throughout
the study, using videoconferencing to connect all three study sites. The PI also reviewed a
random sample (about one in six) of Dignity Therapy transcripts from all study sites, in
order to identify any problems or opportunities for therapeutic improvements. Feedback
from this review was offered, either individually, or when more broadly applicable, within
group supervision.

Patients were shown the Dignity Therapy question framework (Table 1) and asked to
consider what they might wish to speak about during their Dignity Therapy session(s); this
initial introduction to, and explanation of, Dignity Therapy took about 30 minutes. Within a
few days, or as soon as a second meeting could be arranged, the therapist used the question

framework to help elicit the patient's recollections, hopes, wishes for loved ones; lessons
learned and things they wanted remembered by those they were about to leave behind.
Dignity Therapy is flexible enough to accommodate participant preferences and choices
regarding content, but the ethos of questioning targets those things that might enhance a
sense of meaning, purpose, continued sense of self, and overall sense of dignity. All Dignity
Therapy sessions were audio-taped; these sessions usually took about 60 minutes. Upon
completion, the audio-recording was transcribed verbatim and the transcript edited, to
provide a clear and readable narrative. This transcript or `generativity document' was
returned to the patient within approximately four business days from their prior session, read
to them in its entirety to ensure that no errors of omission or commission needed to be
addressed (this final session usually took about 30 minutes). (Generativity, or the ability to
guide the next generation, encompasses how patients might find strength or comfort in
knowing that they will leave behind something lasting and transcendent of death)5. The final
version of the generativity document was then given to the patient, to be passed along to a
designated recipient of their choosing, from whom follow-up data were later obtained (the
influence of Dignity Therapy on family recipients of generativity documents will be
reported separately). At the conclusion of this session, participants were asked to complete a
psychometric follow-up battery (as described below).

Client Centred Care—Client Centred Care is a supportive psychotherapeutic approach, in
which the research nurse-therapist guided the patient through discussions focusing on `here
and now' issues i.e. participants were asked about their illness, associated symptoms, and
what was being done to address their distress. As such, the content of Client Centred Care
was kept as distinct from Dignity Therapy as much as possible and did not focus on issues of
generativity, meaning or purpose. If these issues were raised, the therapist did not probe for
additional detail, allowing the interview to gently return to illness related inquiry. Although
these sessions were audio-recorded for purposes of auditing protocol adherence, no
permanent record of these conversations was provided to the patient or to his or her family.
The number of contacts for Client Centred Care and Dignity Therapy were identical; with
the initial, middle and final meetings designed to occupy about the same time interval across
both arms. During the final meeting, seven to ten days later, the participants completed the
psychometric battery.

Standard Palliative Care—Participants assigned to Standard Palliative Care had access
to the full range of palliative care support services available to all study patients, including
specialist palliative care physicians and nurses (i.e. experts in pain and symptom
management), social workers, chaplains, and psychologists and/or psychiatrists. No
participating site provided a formal approach to addressing generativity issues; as such, a
program comparable to Dignity Therapy was not available to patients who were not
randomized to the Dignity Therapy arm of this trial. Once patients were randomized to
standard palliative care, they were asked to complete a battery of baseline psychometric
questionnaires; seven to ten days later—a time frame corresponding to the approximate
interval between the first and last contact in the other two study arms—they were asked to
complete a battery of psychometric measures.

Baseline and Outcome Measures

The primary baseline measures consisted of the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) (a
measure of physical performance) [100%=healthy; 0%=death],9 the FACIT Spiritual Well-
Being Scale (a measure of spiritual well-being with 2 subscales measuring Meaning/Peace
and Faith),10 the Patient Dignity Inventory,11 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS).12 We also administered items from the Structured Interview for Symptoms
and Concerns (SISC),13 including dignity, desire for death, suffering, hopelessness,

depression, suicidal ideation and sense of burden to others. Additional measures included a
two-item Quality of Life Scale14 and an Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS),
modified to include a `will-to-life' visual analogue scale.15 All measures were re-
administered immediately upon study completion. Secondary outcomes, addressing to what
extent the intervention might have influenced their end-of-life experience, were measured by
way of a post-study survey, asking detailed questions about their experience of the study and
how it had affected them and their family.

Randomization and Masking

The study statistician did the randomization (1:1:1) in blocks of 30. Study arm assignment
was based on a computer-generated table of random numbers. Blinding was achieved using
opaque sealed envelopes containing allocations from a computer-generated table of random
numbers. In order to determine trial arm designation, the envelopes were sent to each site
and opened by study staff, in sequence, once participant consent had been obtained. To
avoid any possible response bias or contamination, research staff with whom the participant
had no prior contact administered the final psychometric battery. Recordings from the
Dignity Therapy and Client Centered Care study arms were reviewed by the study
coordinator to ensure protocol adherence and prevent cross arm contamination.

Recruitment (Figure I)

One-thousand five-hundred thirteen patients were assessed for eligibility utilizing a
consecutive sampling approach. Of those, 630 were deemed ineligible and 442 refused
(Figure 1). A total of 441 participants were randomized; following randomization, 28
patients died, 85 withdrew because of declining health and 2 failed BOMC screening. Given
that there was either no, or only very partial data for these individuals, they were excluded
from the analysis. As such, 326 participants completed the study. Recruitment was relatively
even across the three study sites (Winnipeg, 119; Perth, 99 and New York, 108), with each
site balanced across each study arm.

Statistical Methods

Analyses were done on all patients with available data at baseline and at the end of the study
intervention. The data was summarised using standard descriptive measures. The primary
outcomes consisted of mean changes between baseline and end of intervention, on measures
of psychosocial, spiritual and existential distress (see Baseline and Outcome Measures).
Two group comparisons were carried out, using t-tests where the data approximated a
normal distribution and Mann Whitney U tests when the data was ordinal. Three group
comparisons were carried out using analysis of variance (ANOVA) when a normal
distribution was reasonably approximated and Kruskal-Wallis tests when it was not. With an
alpha set at .05, a desired power set at .80, and a small to medium effect size using Cohen's
value for such an effect size of 0.15, the estimated recruitment target was 120 patients per
arm.16 The effect size here refers to the standard deviation of the group means divided by
the hypothesized common standard deviation. With three groups, an effect size of 0.15
would imply that at least one group mean is at least one third of a standard deviation away
from the other two. SPSS-Version 18 was the software package used for statistical analysis.

When a significant result was obtained in a multi-group comparison, the precise nature of
the group differences were explored using Tukey's test (if analysis of variance had been
used) or a series of Mann-Whitney U tests (if the Kruskal Wallis test had been used). Pre-
therapy versus post-therapy comparisons were carried out using the paired t test if the data
was approximately normal or the Wilcox signed-rank test if it was not. All comparisons
were carried out on a two-tailed basis. In view of the large number of comparisons being

as the minimum acceptable designation of significance.

Results

Of the 326 participants who completed the study, 161 (49.4%) were male (table 2). The
average age was 65.1 years (SD 14.4) [range: 22 – 102]. One-hundred ninety two (58.9%)
were married or living common-law, with the remainder widowed, divorced or not married.
183 (56.1%) were living with their spouse/partner, 86 (26.4%) alone, 70 (21.5%) were living
with children and the remainder living with others, such as friends or other relatives. Home
based palliative care accounted for 196 (60.1%) of patients; 72 (22.1%) patients were
receiving inpatient unit palliative care; 31 (22.1%) acute care inpatient (followed by
palliative care on non-palliative care unit); and 27 (8.3%) freestanding hospice. Regarding
religious affiliation, 119 (36.6%) were Protestant, 86 (26.4%) Catholic, 43 (13.2%) Jewish,
43 (13.2%) other, 33 (10.1%) none, and one person was unable to answer. Thirty
participants (9.2%) had less than high school education, 107 (32.8%) had completed high
school, and 188 (57.7%) college or post-graduate training (one person was unable to
answer). Cancer disease site distribution included gastrointestinal (37.7%), genitourinary
(17.2%), lung (14.7%), breast (8.9%), miscellaneous solid tumors (7.7%), hematological
(4.6%), brain (2.8%), head and neck (2.2%) and non-malignant terminal condition (i.e. end-
stage organ failure, ALS) [4.3%]. The average Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) rating for
all participants was 44.30% (SD 15.13). As expected for a trial of this size, there was good
balance at baseline in patient characteristics between the three randomised groups'.

One hundred thirty four (41.1%) participants reported that they had lived with their life
limiting condition less than one year; 104 (31.9%) 1 to 3 years; and the remainder for more
than three years. One hundred eleven (34.1%) participants were assigned to Standard
Palliative Care, 107 (32.8%) to Client Centred Care and 108 (33.1%) to Dignity Therapy.
The median survival time was 110 days (25% ≤ 56 days; 75% ≤ 235 days) (65.3% of
patients had died by the time the study concluded; the proportion of patients surviving
across the study arms was not significantly different between groups (χ2=4.58; 2 df; p=0.1).
There was no difference in post study survival time between the three study arms (F=0.675,
p=0.51). Age and sex distribution, PPS ratings, as well as drop-out rate (death and
withdrawal due to declining health), across all three study arms showed no significant
differences.

Baseline measures for all pre-study psychometrics were calculated. (See Table 3A and 4A).
Because no initial threshold level of distress was stipulated as an entry criterion, the sample
was most noteworthy for its paucity of distress. In most instances, patients were not
markedly distressed, as indicated by the average Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI) item
scores, along with other baseline psychometric measures. Differences between pre and post
study measures were calculated for all PDI and SISC items, along with modified ESAS
individual sub-scale scores, the Quality of Life Scale, FACIT and HADS, comparing
changes across all three study arms. No significant differences were found (see Table 3B
and 4B). The post study survey, however, disclosed various differences between the three
study conditions (Table 5). Patients receiving Dignity Therapy were significantly more
likely to report having found the study helpful (χ2=35.501, 2 df; p<0.001), that it improved
their quality of life (χ2=14.520, 2 df; p<0.001), and sense of dignity (χ2=12.655, 2 df;
p=0.002). Dignity Therapy patients, compared to the other study arms, were also
significantly more likely to report that being in the study changed how their family sees and
appreciates them (χ2=33.811, 2 df; p<0.001) and that it has or will be of help to their family
(χ2=33.864, 2 df; p<0.001). Dignity Therapy significantly outperformed one of the two
other study arms on improving spiritual well being (χ2=10.354, 2 df; p=0.006), lessening

Discussion

This study represents the first randomized control trial of Dignity Therapy. We set out to
determine if this novel psychotherapeutic approach would significantly outperform standard
care, or Client Centered Care (which focused on non-generativity, here and now issues) on
various measures of psychological, existential and spiritual distress. While floor effects
precluded our ability to demonstrate significant differences across study arms, our secondary
outcomes revealed substantive benefits of Dignity Therapy. Using a post-study survey,
patients who received Dignity Therapy were significantly more likely to report benefits, in
terms of finding it helpful, improving their quality of life, their sense of dignity; changing
how their family might see or appreciate them, and deeming it helpful to their family,
compared to the other study arms.

Comprehensive palliative care requires that careful attention be paid to the physical,
psychosocial, existential and spiritual sources of end-of-life distress. Restricting ones' focus
on any of these domains to the exclusion of others, fails to meet standards of palliative care
as specified by the World Health Organization17 and the Institutes of Medicine (IOM).18 In
describing factors associated with a good death, the IOM includes preparation for death and
opportunities for closure or `sense of completion' of the life.18 Yet, while significant inroads
have been made in our ability to achieve physical comfort for dying patients, there are few
novel interventions designed to address the psychosocial, existential and spiritual
dimensions of end-of-life care.

Dignity Therapy was developed for the purpose of lessening distress and enhancing end-of-
life experience for patients approaching death. In our phase I trial, nearly all patients found
Dignity Therapy helpful, whether they had disclosed substantial initial distress or not.4 On
the basis of that finding, baseline distress was not specified as an entry criteria for this
current randomized controlled trial. Given that base rates of distress within our sample were
quite low, it is perhaps not surprising that we were unable to measure any significant
changes in distress across the three study arms. Showing improvement of measures of
depression, will to live and quality of life, presupposes that patients' experience those areas
as initially being problematic. In the absence of such initial distress, there is simply little
room for improvement.

It is also possible that the instruments we used for our primary outcomes were less
responsive and less sensitive to changes than the secondary outcome measures, whereby
patients reported their experiences in a post-study survey. The difficulty of demonstrating
psychosocial change at end of life by way of using self-report measures has been well
documented. Unlike a chemotherapy trial, where survival interval, tumor load, and overall
mortality provide readily measurable and objective outcomes, defining outcomes for Dignity
Therapy is far more challenging. Dignity Therapy was designed to favorably influence the
experience of people moving towards death. As such, measures of overt distress, along with
indicators of psychosocial, existential and spiritual impact, were incorporated into the study
protocol. A recent review of quality of life measures suitable for use in palliative care was
unable to identify any with established responsiveness to change.19 A recent meta-analysis
concluded that pre-intervention distress is a critical moderator of efficacy for psychosocial
interventions for cancer patients.20 Scott et al have suggested that a more successful
approach may be applying serial qualitative interviews.21 This approach, however, would
not be well suited to a design comprised of an RCT.

Given the lack of significant difference across study arms for the primary outcome
measures, we also considered whether the trial might have been underpowered. Our post-
hoc power calculation, based on the actual number of trial participants determined that with
326 patients, this study had a power of 0.72 – 0.95 to detect an effect size of 0.15 – 0.30,
respectively. It is also noteworthy that most non-significant differences had large p-values
and significant differences had very small p-values, so the issue of power may be moot.

That said, patients receiving Dignity Therapy were significantly more likely than those
assigned to other study arms, to report that this approach was helpful, that it improved their
quality of life, enhanced their sense of dignity and provided benefits to their family. It would
appear that although they reported their initial state of psychosocial or existential well-being
as satisfactory, patients receiving Dignity Therapy often encountered an enhanced quality of
end-of-life experience that they simply could not have anticipated. While difficult to
measure, the impact was often poignant and profound. For instance, one 72-year-old woman
with bowel cancer stated, “[Dignity therapy] brought to the forefront that I have to prepare
my family to the best of my ability.” A 56-year-old woman said, “Mostly I want my family
to know that I'm okay with dying and they must move on.” She went on to say that “the
therapy showed me I am not the cancer, I am still in here. I am so grateful for that because I
lost myself….it really helped me remember who I am.”

In hindsight, one might argue that this randomized controlled trial should have screened for
patients reporting some baseline critical level of distress. That might have enhanced the
likelihood of demonstrating differences across the three study arms, based on changes in the
pre and post intervention questionnaires. Our disinclination to do so, however, was based on
prior findings, illustrating the salutary effects of Dignity Therapy for nearly all patients
nearing death, whether overtly distressed or not. Introducing critical thresholds of distress
for study inclusion would have eliminated the vast majority of patients, who are most likely
to partake of this novel therapeutic approach. Another consideration may have been a cross
over design, in which patients could experience and thus compare Dignity therapy with
other possible study conditions. However, given how ill these patients were, such a design
would not have been feasible, with many patients either deteriorating or dying prior to a
head to head comparison being possible.

It is also notable that of the 1513 patients who were accessed for eligibility, 42% were
ineligible, primarily because they were too ill to take part in the study. Of those who met
eligibility criteria, half consented to participate, nearly three-quarters of whom completed
the protocol. For palliative care protocols that require cognitively intact participants, this
recruitment pattern is not at all atypical.22 The nature of Dignity Therapy is such that only
patients who are mentally capable of providing personally meaningful responses, are those
who will be approached to take part. Therefore, generalizability should be framed in terms
of those who maintain their cognitive capacity in proximity to death. Although this
particular trial primarily involved patients with cancer, other studies have begun to explore
its application in non-cancer populations23

We are not aware of any instance where patients withdrew from Dignity Therapy because of
feeling upset or distressed. Many patients, however, indicated moments during Dignity
Therapy that were emotionally evocative; for example, talking about hopes or wishes for
family members in anticipation of a time beyond their death. By and large, however, patients
appreciated the opportunity to articulate these issues. The only safety issue, which will be
reported more fully in a separate paper describing family experiences of Dignity Therapy,
concerned a few occasions where family members were dissatisfied with the generativity
document. In those instances, they felt the patient had become too ill to give fulsome
responses, or that the answers provided a distorted image of the participant. As such, it is

important that patients who are delirious or otherwise cognitively impaired be excluded
from Dignity Therapy.

Several studies have recently been published, reporting on the performance of Dignity
therapy under various circumstances. A Phase I Danish study of ten health care
professionals and twenty patients concluded that, with minor cultural adaptations, Dignity
Therapy was “a manageable, acceptable and relevant intervention for Danish patients
admitted to palliative care”.24 A pilot study of eight end stage patients in rural Kentucky
with end stage cancer showed that Dignity Therapy could be delivered by videophone, and
achieve overall benefit and high levels of patient satisfaction.25 A phase I study conducted
in French Canada reported that amongst a cohort of 33 dying patients, relevance and
satisfaction were found to be high, for patients and families alike.26

Despite the beneficial effects elicited by Dignity Therapy, its ability to mitigate outright
distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, remains unproven. Future
research amongst more severely distressed patients may indeed establish its role in those
particular circumstances. However, while “symptomatic relief of distress is an important
goal of psychotherapeutic treatment, it is too limited a framework from which to consider
the purpose and potential benefit of individual psychotherapy for patients with advanced or
terminal disease.”27 In these circumstances, psychotherapy is not only offered to alleviate
distress, but also as a means of preventing distress, promoting well being and establishing a
sense of personal meaning and life purpose. Psychotherapeutic support can help patients
face disappointments, process the reality of leaving behind loved ones; deal with feelings of
sadness, loss, isolation and a damaged sense of identity and personal value. It can also help
patients consider personal priorities regarding relationships, religious and spiritual beliefs,
and deal with the urgency of resolving conflicts or achieve personally meaningful
goals.27–30 Palliative care must offer patients opportunities to engage in this myriad of
issues, and Dignity Therapy is one means by which it might do so. Future research exploring
the salutary effects of Dignity Therapy will no doubt help to unravel the psychological,
spiritual and existential complexities of facing death, and how to best support patients and
families confronting advanced and terminal illness.

Research in Context

The systematic review that accompanied the application for funding of the Dignity Therapy
RCT was incorporated into two publications; Chochinov HM, Hack T, Hassard T, et al.
Dignity and Psychotherapeutic Considerations in End of Life Care. Journal of Palliative
Care. 2004;20:142–143, and later updated, appearing in, Chochinov HM. Dying, Dignity
and new Horizons in Palliative End-of-Life care. CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.
2006;56(2):84–103. This is the first randomized trial of Dignity Therapy. Based on the
findings of this study, clinicians should consider Dignity Therapy a viable therapeutic
approach, which can enhance end-of-life experience for patients and families confronting
death.

Dignity Therapy Question Protocol

Table 1

Tell me a little about your life history; particularly the parts that you either remember most or think are the most important? When did you feel
most alive?

Are there specific things that you would want your family to know about you, and are there particular things you would want them to
remember?

What are the most important roles you have played in life (family roles, vocational roles, community-service roles, etc)? Why were they so
important to you and what do you think you accomplished in those roles?

What are your most important accomplishments, and what do you feel most proud of?

Are there particular things that you feel still need to be said to your loved ones or things that you would want to take the time to say once again?

What are your hopes and dreams for your loved ones?

What have you learned about life that you would want to pass along to others? What advice or words of guidance would you wish to pass along
to your (son, daughter, husband, wife, parents, other[s])?

Are there words or perhaps even instructions that you would like to offer your family to help prepare them for the future?

In creating this permanent record, are there other things that you would like included?
