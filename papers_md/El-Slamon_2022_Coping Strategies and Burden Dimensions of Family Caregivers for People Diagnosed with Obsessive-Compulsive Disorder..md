Abstract: (1) Background: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental disorder that
can be a source of emotional, ﬁnancial and/or social burden for family caregivers. Few studies have
investigated family caregiving for patients diagnosed with OCD in relation to the coping strategies
being used from a theoretical perspective. This study evaluated the burden and coping strategies
of family caregivers for people diagnosed with OCD. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was
conducted, in which 123 participants diagnosed with OCD and their caregivers were surveyed using
three types of scales: obsessive–compulsive scale; coping scale; and burden scale. (3) Results: Of
the participants with OCD and their caregivers, 53% and 31% were male and 47% and 69% were
female, respectively. Around 80% of the OCD patients were considered young and their age ranged
from 20–40 years old. Forty percent of caregivers in the current study reported a high burden level.
The caregivers of those who had severe OCD symptoms had a lower coping level compared to
the caregivers of those with less severe symptoms and those urban caregivers were able to better
cope than rural caregivers. There was an association between OCD symptom severity and ﬁnancial,
work-related, social and family relationships, mental and health burdens for family caregivers.
Meanwhile, the greater coping level of family caregivers, the lesser social and family, mental, and
spouse relationship burden (p < 0.05); (4) Conclusions: The family caregivers of people diagnosed
with OCD have speciﬁc aspects of burden and coping which require support by designing strategic
interventions for family caregiver coping.

1. Introduction

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder affecting
2–3% of the population worldwide: it is thus twice as prevalent as schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder [1]. The disorder is characterized by obsessions as well as persistent, unwanted
and disturbing thoughts that provoke distress and anxiety. In order to resist the persistent
thoughts and reduce the level of anxiety, people with OCD tend to perform repetitive
mental behaviors in an irrational way [2]. The effects of OCD may have repercussions in
people’s daily activities, social and professional lives to the extent that these can cause a
type of functional impairment. Stengler-Wenzke and colleagues [1] claimed that hospital-
ized patients diagnosed with OCD have greater functional impairment than hospitalized
patients diagnosed with depression.

2. Theoretical Background

Due to the characteristics of OCD’s clinical presentation, family caregivers often need
to change the routine of their own life to deal with the disorder of their family member—that

is, compulsive symptoms. Such changes have placed great demands on family caregivers.
Indeed, the literature has continuously reported the impact of caring for those diagnosed
with OCD on caregivers’ well-being [3]. Although some families cope with providing
care for relatives with mental disorders, others also ﬁnd it hard. People exhibit numerous
individual differences, and studies have shown a relationship between caregivers’ income,
educational level [4], age [5] and their ability to manage their life when caring for people
diagnosed with OCD. Some theories have been proposed to explain such variation. Of
these theories is the “Folkman’s Transactional Stress and Coping Framework” developed
by Lazarus and Folkman [6].

Folkman et al.’s [6] framework describes coping as an important approach that people
sometimes use to cope with their physical or/and psychological distress that they perceive
to exceed their personal resources [6]. The framework highlighted the presence of a mutual
relationship between each burden, distress and coping strategy. However, according to the
framework, perceived distress and personal resources vary among different people. In the
current study, the Folkman et al. framework [6] will be used as a lens to view the burden,
distress and the coping strategies of family caregivers of those people diagnosed with OCD
and the possible variation.

Family caregivers of people with OCD mainly reported a considerable amount of
burden due the inﬂuence of the disease on their lives, and with little social and ﬁnancial
support, the burden might be intensiﬁed leading to feelings of extreme distress [5–8]. The
burden of OCD on caregivers is well documented in the literature and was found to be
greater than that of other mental disorders [7,8]. This probably due to the presence of OCD
symptoms which leads to distress, anxiety and worry. Indeed, caregivers perceived the
burden as greater if their family member had severe OCD symptoms and they had a more
difﬁcult time managing it [3]. The burden can be referred to as the difﬁculty of caring
for someone as perceived by caregivers and the inﬂuence it has on their daily life [9–11].
A variety of physical, psychological, social and economic burdens could develop as a
result of the caring role [7]. Feelings of distress, sadness and/or frustration and sometimes
depression, were found to be critical indicators of severe burden [12] and could negatively
inﬂuence a family caregivers’ health and functionality [7,11].

Under circumstances in which people encounter a particular source of stress, they
ﬁrst tend to conduct a logical analysis to identify whether a particular stimulus is relevant
to their well-being [6]. This is followed by thinking about the alternative solutions and
selecting the best plans [13]. This is referred to as coping strategies. Coping strategies are
cognitive, emotional and behavioral efforts to overcome stress as well as reduce harm and
pain [10]. This may involve the active management and/or alteration of an individual’s
own environment. In the context of caring, caregivers generally assess the effect of the
daily care of patients on their well-being, and the available support that could be used
to deal with it. However, when a perception of distress resulting from care for patients
with OCD exceeds the social, mental and ﬁnancial supportive resources of caregivers,
they tend to feel burden in multiple aspects of their daily lives [2]. This may include but
is not limited to feeling overwhelmed, powerless, tired, experiencing health problems,
physical, mental and ﬁnancial exhaustion. It is therefore coping strategies that are key
elements of distress management, which reduce the negative inﬂuence on family caregivers’
perception of burden (Folkman et al., 1986). The framework shown in Figure 1 presents the
following sequence:

Figure 1. The Theoretical Framework of Caregiver Burden, Coping Strategies and Distress (adapted
from Folkman et al. [6].

Although there is an abundance of evidence available in the literature, there is still
lack of a theoretical foundation underlying most of the evidence [14]. A study conducted
by Suculluoglu-Dikici et al. [4] found that several factors affect burden. Suculluoglu-Dikici
and colleagues recommended behavioral management to protect family health. In another
recent study, caregivers who participated in an interview verbalized the different types
of burdens they experienced and their need for educational training on effective coping
strategies [7]. This implies the importance of having more evidence to contribute to the
body of knowledge and build a general understanding of how caregivers manage their lives.
This could be met by conducting studies that investigate the speciﬁc aspects of burden of
the disorder on the caregivers and their possible correlates to caregivers’ sociodemographic
factors. Identifying the most impacted aspects of a caregivers’ life, could help increase our
understanding and therefore improve our planning for more speciﬁc interventions that
lower the impact of caring for people diagnosed with OCD on family caregivers. Hence,
this study aimed to evaluate the burden and coping strategies of family caregivers of those
people diagnosed with OCD and a possible correlation.

3. Materials and Methods

A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. This study was conducted from July
to August 2020. All participants were recruited from the outpatient units of two regional
psychiatry hospitals located at Elsinbilawin city, in Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. Both
hospitals provide free and paid mental health services and both are specialized in the
treatment of OCD among other mental disorders through inpatient and outpatient services.

3.1. Participants

There were two groups of participants at both sites, family members and those diag-
nosed with OCD in the outpatient units of two regional psychiatry hospitals. Inclusion
criteria were family caregivers and those diagnosed with OCD > 18 years of age and living
together in the same place or at least living in the same geographic area as the person
diagnosed with OCD; being available at the time of data collection; and family caregivers
were the primary caregiver. The exclusion criterion was having OCD in addition to a
comorbid psychiatric disorder. To obtain a signiﬁcant result (p < 0.05) with enough power
(80%), a minimum sample size of 84 was required to achieve a correlation coefﬁcient of at
least 0.3 [15]. A convenient sample technique was implemented.

3.2. Data Collection Tool

Data were collected using four instruments including people with OCD and family
caregivers’ demographic variables’ assessment chart. Demographic variables were collected
included family members with OCD and the caregivers’ age, sex, residence, social status,
education, work and socioeconomic level.

The Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale was used to assess symptom sever-
ity for the disorder. The tool was designed and tested for reliability and validity by
Goodman et al. [16] and consists of ten items. Each item was designed to ask the people
with OCD about their symptoms. For each item, the people with OCD rated the degree to

which the item applied during the previous week on a scale of 0–4. A total score from 8 to
15 indicated ‘Mild OCD’; 16–23 indicated ‘Moderate OCD’; 24–31 indicated ‘Severe OCD’;
and 32–40 indicated ‘Extreme OCD’.

Burden Scale [17] was used to assess the burden of chronic mental illness on the family
caregivers. The tool consisted of 40 items. Each item was rated on a 3-point scale (not at all,
to some extent, and very much). The higher the total score, the greater the burden. The
tool includes six speciﬁc aspects of burden: ﬁnancial aspect (4 items); work-related aspect
(4 items); social and family relationship aspect (12 items); mental health aspect (9 items);
physical health aspect (5 items); and spouse relationship aspect (6 items). The tool has been
found to be statistically valid and reliable [17]. The instrument has a Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.73.

The Coping Scale [18] assessed the caregivers’ use of both behavioral and cognitive-
emotional strategies for dealing with stressful events. The strategies were guided by
caregivers’ appraisals of the events and their beliefs in relation to their ability to effectively
cope with the stressful event. The scale included 13 strategies, consisting of (7 items)
reﬂecting cognitive appraisal; (4 items) representing behavioral methods of coping; and
(2 items) managing. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale which ranged from ‘mostly
true’ to ‘not at all true’. The scale validity and reliability were established by Hamby and
colleagues [18].

3.3. Data Collection Procedure

Prior to conducting the study, the outpatient appointment records from the two
regional psychiatry hospitals where people diagnosed with OCD were scheduled for a
follow-up appointment with psychiatric practitioners were reviewed by the researchers. Of
the 304 patients listed in the appointment records, 142 persons diagnosed with OCD had an
appointment in the outpatient clinics from July to August 2020. The researchers contacted
the caregivers of the 142 patients by telephone and invited them and their relative patients
to participate in the study. Among the 142 pairs, 130 agreed to participate (130 caregivers
and 130 patients with OCD). Researcher lost seven participants during the follow up.

As soon as the participants reached the outpatient psychiatric clinics, they met one
of the researchers who accompanied them to a vacant ofﬁce, provided by the hospitals, to
maintain privacy during data collection process. Soon after reaching the data collection
place, the researchers explained the purpose of the study and the methodology. The
participants were encouraged to ask questions and their concerns and queries were resolved
prior to the commencement of data collection. Both patients and their caregivers were
informed that they had the right to withdraw at any point of the study. They were also
advised to inform the researchers if they experienced any mental or physical discomfort.
Finally, informed written consent was obtained from both the person diagnosed with OCD
and their family caregiver.

The demographic variables were collected for both the participants with OCD and
their family caregivers; the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale was completed by
participants with OCD; while the Burden Scale and Coping Scale were completed by
the caregivers. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by the researchers. Of the
123 participants who agreed to take part in the current study, seven participants with OCD
and with mental health comorbidities that could affect the coping and the burden of their
family caregivers were excluded. Ten people with OCD and their family caregivers were
excluded as the caregivers failed to complete the self-reported scales. Six family caregivers
were excluded as they were not primary caregivers. The remaining 100 participants with
OCD and 100 family caregivers who met the research criteria were enrolled in this study.

3.4. Ethical Approval

This study was approved by the Scientiﬁc Research Ethical Committee (SREC), Zagazig
University, Egypt: research protocol SREC 72/1401. This study was conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

3.5. Maintaining Conﬁdentiality

The voluntary nature of the participation, anonymity and conﬁdentiality of participant
information was continuously maintained. No identiﬁable data were collected in the
surveys. The collected anonymous surveys were stored according to the guidelines of the
scientiﬁc research committee and could never be re-identiﬁed. The participant number and
phone number used during the recruitment process were stored safely.

3.6. Data Analysis

The data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Descriptive statistics, chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used when appropriate.
Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient was used to assess the relationships between
study variables.

4. Results

The demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1. Around
50% (n = 49) of those diagnosed with OCD were aged between 30 and 40 years old, while
44% (n = 44) of the family caregivers were aged over than 40 years old. Sixty-nine percent
of the studied caregivers were female and 46% (n = 46) were spouses. Approximately 70%
(n = 71) of the caregivers were employed in a paid job and were of middle socioeconomic
status. Among the caregivers and care recipients living in rural areas, 40 (40%) of the care-
givers lived with the care recipient. Meanwhile, among the caregivers and care recipients
living in urban areas, 57% (n = 57) of the caregivers did not live with the care recipient but
lived in the same geographic area, while 3% lived with their care recipient. Approximately
50% of those with OCD (n = 52) and caregivers (n = 44) had high school education.

4.1. Descriptive Statistics for Family Members with OCD Symptom Severity and for Caregivers’
Burden and Coping Score

The OCD score of the studied participants ranged from 16 to 40 with a mean ± SD
(29.8 ± 6.9); speciﬁcally, 43.0% of the studied participants with OCD reported experiencing
highly severe OCD symptoms in the last week. The burden score of the studied caregivers
ranged from 52 to 117 with mean ± SD (94.7 ± 11.9) and 40.0% of them reported a high
burden level. Speciﬁcally, the social and psychological burden ranged from 18 to 36 with
mean ± SD (26.5 ± 4.2) and 12–27 with mean ± SD (22 ± 2.8), respectively. Meanwhile, the
coping score of the studied caregivers ranged from 13 to 42 with the mean ± SD (30.4 ± 8.2)
and 76.0% of them reported moderate coping level.

4.2. Relationship between Symptom Severity of Family Members with OCD and Their Caregivers’
Burden and Coping Score

Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient was carried out to assess the relationship between
those with OCD and the burden level of the caregiver p < 0.0001 and their coping level.
There was a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the OCD level of family members
with OCD and the burden level of the caregiver p < 0.0001 and their coping level p = 0.005. It
seems that people who have a severe or highly severe level of OCD had caregivers who had
a severe level of burden and low coping level. When the relationship between the burden
and coping levels was further investigated, there were statistically signiﬁcant relationships
between the burden level of the caregiver and the coping level (p = 0.0001). Speciﬁcally,
family caregivers who had a severe burden level, were found to have the lowest coping
levels (Table 2).

4.3. Relationship between Caregivers’ Burden and Coping Score and Demographic Data

Analysis of the relationship between the coping level of the studied caregivers and
their demographic proﬁles revealed several signiﬁcant ﬁndings. The relationship between
coping strategies and the place of living, for those caregivers and care recipients who
live in urban areas, revealed that coping was high among caregivers who live in the
same geographic area as (p = 0.007), while the burden was signiﬁcantly higher among
caregivers who live with the care recipient in rural areas (p = 0.09). Furthermore, the
relationship between the burden level of the studied caregivers and their socioeconomic
status and educational level demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant relationship (p = 0.017
and p = 0.004, respectively). This indicates that caregivers of high socioeconomic status
suffered from a moderate burden level, while those caregivers of low socioeconomic status
suffered from a severe burden level.

4.4. Relationship between OCD Severity and Aspects of Burden

Table 3 presents a summary of the relationship between OCD severity and aspects
of burden (ﬁnancial aspect, work-related aspect, social and family aspect, mental health
aspect, physical health aspect and spouse relationship aspect). Greater OCD severity
was associated with greater ﬁnancial, work-related, social and family, mental and health
burden. Meanwhile, a greater coping level of the caregivers indicated that there was less
burden on their social and family lives, less mental burden and less burden on their spouse
relationship (p < 0.05).

4.5. Results under the Lens of the Theoretical Framework

The caregiver burden, coping strategy and OCD symptom severity in relation to the
demographic variables were entered into the model to investigate the mechanisms linking
the caregiver burden to the coping strategy and the OCD symptom severity and possible
correlation to demographic data. This study demonstrated the ﬁndings in the following
sequence: ﬁrst, this study demonstrated the relationships between the burden dimensions
and coping strategies of the caregivers. Second, this study demonstrated the relationships
between the burden dimension and OCD symptom severity. Third, the study demonstrated
the relationships between demographic data and the burden and coping levels. The details
shown in the model are presented in Figure 2.

Discussion This study was an attempt to assess the burden aspects and the coping levels of fam-ily caregivers and investigate whether there was a possible correlation. Despite the fact that several studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the burden and the cop-ing levels of caregivers of people diagnosed with OCD, the current study is one of the few to have investigated family caregiving for OCD people from a theoretical perspective to assess the specific aspects of burden for OCD’s caregivers.  Burden is a multi-aspect construct [8]. There is a lack of studies showing the dimen-sions of caregiver burden, coping strategy, and distress resulting from the severity of OCD symptoms in Middle East countries, where family obligations are greatly important [19]. The findings of the current study not only support the Folkman et al. [6] framework, but also provide insight for policy makers to develop appropriate interventions to address caregivers’ needs. Furthermore, nurses’ interaction with patients, their families and other caregivers puts them in an important position to help caregivers reduce the negative im-pact of the disease on their family well-being [20]. This study shows that a greater severity of symptoms in people with OCD indicates a greater burden level on the caregiver. Such findings might be somehow justified from a cultural view. Arab cultures are generally based on an extended family system, and entire family members often live together in the same geographical area or sometimes in the same house. Traditionally, a healthy relative is mandated to take the responsibility for caring for those family members who are mentally unwell [19].

5. Discussion

This study was an attempt to assess the burden aspects and the coping levels of family
caregivers and investigate whether there was a possible correlation. Despite the fact that
several studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the burden and the coping
levels of caregivers of people diagnosed with OCD, the current study is one of the few
to have investigated family caregiving for OCD people from a theoretical perspective to
assess the speciﬁc aspects of burden for OCD’s caregivers.

Burden is a multi-aspect construct [8]. There is a lack of studies showing the dimen-
sions of caregiver burden, coping strategy, and distress resulting from the severity of OCD
symptoms in Middle East countries, where family obligations are greatly important [19].
The ﬁndings of the current study not only support the Folkman et al. [6] framework, but
also provide insight for policy makers to develop appropriate interventions to address
caregivers’ needs. Furthermore, nurses’ interaction with patients, their families and other
caregivers puts them in an important position to help caregivers reduce the negative impact
of the disease on their family well-being [20].

This study shows that a greater severity of symptoms in people with OCD indicates a
greater burden level on the caregiver. Such ﬁndings might be somehow justiﬁed from a
cultural view. Arab cultures are generally based on an extended family system, and entire
family members often live together in the same geographical area or sometimes in the same
house. Traditionally, a healthy relative is mandated to take the responsibility for caring
for those family members who are mentally unwell [19]. Caregivers’ burden from caring
for mentally ill relatives has generally been signiﬁcantly reported in the literature, and
several studies showed the presence of variation in the overall level of burden observed
worldwide [21,22].

It is not just mental diseases such as depression [23] and schizophrenia [24,25] that
place excessive demands on family caregivers. The literature has shown that the care-
givers for those suffering from other medical or physical diseases such as dementia [26],
stroke [27] and physical disability [28] have also experienced a negative impact on their
lives. Interestingly, giving care to a family member with mental, medical disorders and
disabilities is not always seen as a burden [3]. Caregivers may also perceive some positive
aspect of giving care in the form of becoming closer and more sensitive to the needs of their
family member [3,29,30]. Part of this positive sentiment could be attributed to the adoption
of successful coping strategies. Indeed, some studies have shown that caregivers have used
coping strategies with encouraging results in terms of decreasing the burden level [13].

The current study revealed that there is a signiﬁcant association between the caregivers’
burden level and their socioeconomic status. This result is consistent with the literature
as the burden level tends to be high in individuals of lower education and socioeconomic
status [31,32]. In this study, it appears that caregivers who live in urban zones in the
same geographic area are more able to cope with their role of caring for their relative with
OCD. An explanation may be that those from urban areas may have more knowledge
about the disorder due to their higher education level, more access to support from health
professionals and show a more positive attitude and better ability to cope with their
negative feelings [30]. Furthermore, it has been well known that cultural differences and
related factors can affect public perceptions and attitudes surrounding those with OCD,
leading to different caregivers’ experiences [7].

In the current study, greater OCD severity was associated with greater ﬁnancial burden.
This may be attributed to the signiﬁcant role of caregivers as a worker and supplier of
ﬁnancial requirements, leading to great economic burden in addition to other ﬁnancial
strains such as the costs of psychiatric medications and limited coverage of free treatment
by the governmental policies.

In this study, the severity of OCD has a negative impact on caregivers’ general physical
health [31,33] and mental health [34]. Oza et al. [35] concluded that the burden of care
has a strong positive correlation with distress and psychiatric morbidity in the caregiver

of family members with OCD. This may imply a need for more focus concerning marital
relationships and OCD.

Caregivers’ social and family relationships can be inﬂuenced by OCD symptoms
if coping strategies are not sufﬁcient. Caregivers may assume responsibility for many
daily activities that people with OCD are unable to undertake. Caregivers’ abilities to
maintain a social life and care for the remaining family members will decrease [36,37].
This could lead to an impaired social life, social supports and dysfunction in families.
Koujalgi and colleagues [37,38] recommended appropriate assessment and psychosocial
management for families with a member diagnosed with OCD. Speciﬁcally, Koujalgi and
colleagues [37] stressed the importance of implementing educational programs, teaching
family members problem-solving skills and seeking out social support to help the family to
more effectively cope.

6. Study Implications

The current study ﬁndings may have several implications for healthcare professionals
and family caregivers. For instance, educational interventions and initiatives are likely to
be implemented to support the family caregivers of patients diagnosed with OCD. Indeed,
teaching family caregivers about the beneﬁts of adopting coping strategies will enhance
their spouse, social and family relationships as well as their mental health. Psychological
advisors could help family caregivers obtain the appropriate coping strategies to address
their spouse, social, family and mental burdens. Furthermore, the beneﬁts of coping
strategies may extend to improving ﬁnancial and social services and support to allow
family caregivers to cover the ﬁnancial burdens of providing care for patients. Healthcare
policy makers may promote training and educational programs in the community as well
as healthcare settings that aim to improve the well-being of family caregivers, particularly
in regional areas where isolation may contribute to breakdowns in the caregiver–family
member relationship.

7. Study Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, randomization was not maintained during
data collection, and this can limit the generalizability of the study ﬁndings. This study’s
researchers admit the potential bias of using the self-report method [39]. Furthermore, due
to the use of cross-sectional designs, the relationships between burden, coping strategies,
and OCD symptoms cannot be deﬁnitely determined. Although this issue has been man-
aged by examining the variables through the lens of Folkman’s Transactional Stress and
Coping Framework” [6], longitudinal studies should be implemented in future studies.
Since the burden and coping level are variables that are time sensitive and could change
during speciﬁc circumstances, collecting the data shortly after the end of the ﬁrst wave of
the coronavirus pandemic may have inﬂuenced the results of the current study [40].

8. Conclusions

Around 40.0% of caregivers in the current study reported a high burden level. The
burden of caring on the behalf of family caregivers for people diagnosed with OCD is the
most critical factor that affects almost all aspects of life for caregivers—ﬁnancial, work-
related, social and family, mental health and physical health. The study ﬁndings highlight
the role of coping strategies on some burden dimensions. Speciﬁcally, illiterate relatives
caring for patients with OCD (p = 0.004) who are suffering from some ﬁnancial constraints
(p = 0.017) and live in rural areas (p = 0.09) were more likely to have an increase in ﬁnancial,
social, mental physical and work-related burden. Family caregiver burden should be
minimized via assessment and psychosocial supportive programs. Due to the important
position of the nurses interacting with patients, their families and other caregivers, they
have an important role in teaching patients and their relatives some simple but important
techniques on how to manage the negative impact of the disease on their well-being.
Moreover, family caregiver needs should be an important part of the nursing care plan.

Future studies are needed to investigate the impact of different clinical manifestations of
OCD on caregivers’ burden and coping.
