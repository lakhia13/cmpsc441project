People with hypersomnia have difficulty functioning during the day due to sleepiness, which can affect concentration and energy levels.

Here, find out about the types, causes, and symptoms of hypersomnia and how to get help.


## Types and causes of hypersomnia


Hypersomnia can be idiopathic, primary, or secondary.

Idiopathic hypersomnia is when a person feels exceptionally sleepy for no clear reason.

Primary hypersomnia is when hypersomnia is the main condition. Itmay be due toneurological causes or occur as a symptom of narcolepsy.

Onetheoryis that, for some people, too much of a certain small molecule is produced in the cerebrospinal fluid. This acts similarly to a sleeping pill or anesthetic. However, more research is needed.

Secondary hypersomniaresults fromanother medical condition, such as:

- multiple sclerosis (MS)

- nerve damage due to a head trauma

- drug or alcohol use

- damage to the central nervous system

Some of these conditions affect your ability to sleep at night, leading to tiredness during the day.


## Who is at risk for hypersomnia?


People with conditions that make them sleepy during the day are most at risk for hypersomnia.

Theseconditions include:

- kidney conditions

- heart conditions

- nervous system conditions

- low thyroid function

People who smoke or drink regularly are also at risk of developing hypersomnia. Medications that cause drowsiness can have side effects similar to hypersomnia.

Hypersomnia often starts between the mid teens and early twenties, but it can appear at any time. Symptoms may become more intense at intervals. In females, they may worsen just before menstruation.

Some10–15%of people find symptoms resolve for no apparent reason, according to the Hypersomnia Foundation.


## What are the symptoms of hypersomnia?


The main symptom of hypersomnia is constant sleepiness. A person with hypersomnia may sleep more than11 hours in every 24. They may take naps throughout the day but still feel sleepy.

Othersymptoms include:

- difficulty waking from a long sleep

- slow thinking and speech

- difficulty remembering things

- hallucinations, in some cases


## Hypersomnia tests and diagnosis


To diagnose hypersomnia, a doctor will review your symptoms and medical history.

They will likely diagnose hypersomnia if you have experienced the following for at least3 months:

- excessive daytime sleepiness

- an uncontrollable need to sleep

- long, unrefreshing naps

- difficulty waking up from sleep in most instances even after typical or longer periods of nighttime sleep

A physical exam can test for alertness.

A doctormay suggestthe following to help assess hypersomnia:

- A sleep diary: You record your sleep and wake times through the night to track sleeping patterns.

- Epworth sleepiness scale:This scale rates sleepiness to determine the severity of the condition.

- Multiple sleep latency test:You take a monitored nap during the day while a device measures the types of sleep you experience.

- Polysomnogram:You stay at a sleep center overnight, and a device monitors brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, oxygen levels, and breathing function.


## What are the treatment options for hypersomnia?


Treatment will depend on the cause and type of hypersomnia.

Options include:

Stimulant drugs typically used for treating narcolepsy, such as:

- modafinil (Provigil), a drug to promote wakefulness

- amphetamines, such as methylphenidate

- pitolisant (Wakix), another stimulant drug

- sodium oxybate (Xyrem), which prevents muscle weakness and sleepiness with narcolepsy

- flumazenil (Romazicon), which reverses the effect of benzodiazepines

Lifestyle changes may help some people either manage their sleep or cope better with hypersomnia.

- working on a regular sleep schedule, such as waking and sleeping at the same time each day

- avoiding certain activities, such as eating or working in bed, to improve sleep quality

- following a diet that is rich in whole foods may help maintain energy levels naturally

- joining a support group
