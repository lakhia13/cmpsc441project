Background

A B S T R A C T

Decreased exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are common in people following lung resection for non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Exercise training has been demonstrated to confer gains in exercise capacity and HRQoL for people with a range of
chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, as well as in people with prostate and breast cancer.
A programme of exercise training may also confer gains in these outcomes for people following lung resection for NSCLC. This systematic
review updates our 2013 systematic review.

Objectives

The primary aim of this review was to determine the effects of exercise training on exercise capacity and adverse events in people following
lung  resection  (with  or  without  chemotherapy)  for  NSCLC.  The  secondary  aims  were  to  determine  the  effects  of  exercise  training  on
other outcomes such as HRQoL, force-generating capacity of peripheral muscles, pressure-generating capacity of the respiratory muscles,
dyspnoea and fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, lung function, and mortality.

Search methods

We  searched  for  additional  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  in  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL)  (the
Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 2 of 12), MEDLINE (via PubMed) (2013 to February 2019), Embase (via Ovid) (2013 to February 2019), SciELO
(The Scientific Electronic Library Online) (2013 to February 2019), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) (2013 to February 2019).

Selection criteria

We included RCTs in which participants with NSCLC who underwent lung resection were allocated to receive either exercise training, which
included aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or a combination of both, or no exercise training.

Data collection and analysis

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Two  review  authors  screened  the  studies  and  identified  those  eligible  for  inclusion.  We  used  either  postintervention  values  (with
their  respective  standard  deviation  (SD))  or  mean  changes  (with  their  respective  SD)  in  the  meta-analyses  that  reported  results  as
mean difference (MD). In meta-analyses that reported results as standardised mean difference (SMD), we placed studies that reported
postintervention values and those that reported mean changes in separate subgroups. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each
outcome by downgrading or upgrading the evidence according to GRADE criteria.

Main results

Along with the three RCTs included in the original version of this review (2013), we identified an additional five RCTs in this update, resulting
in a total of eight RCTs involving 450 participants (180 (40%) females). The risk of selection bias in the included studies was low and the risk
of performance bias high. Six studies explored the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training; one explored the effects of combined
aerobic and inspiratory muscle training; and one explored the effects of combined aerobic, resistance, inspiratory muscle training and
balance training. On completion of the intervention period, compared to the control group, exercise capacity expressed as the peak rate
of oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was greater in the intervention group (VO2peak: MD 2.97 mL/kg/min,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 4.02 mL/kg/min, 4 studies, 135 participants, moderate-certainty evidence; 6MWD: MD 57 m, 95% CI
34 to 80 m, 5 studies, 182 participants, high-certainty evidence). One adverse event (hip fracture) related to the intervention was reported
in one of the included studies. The intervention group also achieved greater improvements in the physical component of general HRQoL
(MD 5.0 points, 95% CI 2.3 to 7.7 points, 4 studies, 208 participants, low-certainty evidence); improved force-generating capacity of the
quadriceps muscle (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1, 4 studies, 133 participants, moderate-certainty evidence); and less dyspnoea (SMD −0.43,
95% CI −0.81 to −0.05, 3 studies, 110 participants, very low-certainty evidence). We observed uncertain effects on the mental component of
general HRQoL, disease-specific HRQoL, handgrip force, fatigue, and lung function. There were insufficient data to comment on the effect
of exercise training on maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures and feelings of anxiety and depression. Mortality was not reported
in the included studies.

Authors' conclusions

Exercise training increased exercise capacity and quadriceps muscle force of people following lung resection for NSCLC. Our findings also
suggest improvements on the physical component score of general HRQoL and decreased dyspnoea. This systematic review emphasises
the importance of exercise training as part of the postoperative management of people with NSCLC.

Exercise training after lung surgery for people with non-small cell lung cancer

Review question

We updated the evidence about the effect of exercise training after lung surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on fitness level;
adverse events; quality of life; strength of the leg, hand, and breathing muscles; breathlessness; fatigue; feelings of anxiety and depression;
and lung function.

Background

After lung surgery for NSCLC, people's fitness levels and quality of life decrease. We know that exercise training improves these outcomes
in people with chronic lung disease and in those with prostate and breast cancer. In the 2013 version of this review, we demonstrated that
exercise training improved fitness level (distance walked on the six-minute walk test) in people after lung surgery for NSCLC. Due to the
limited number of studies, the effect of exercise training on quality of life and other outcomes was unclear.

Search date

The evidence is current to February 2019.

Study characteristics

We included three studies from the 2013 review and an additional five new studies from the current review, for a total of eight studies with
450 participants (180 women). The number of participants in the included studies ranged between 17 and 131; the mean age of participants
was between 63 and 71 years. Six studies explored the effects of combined aerobic and strengthening exercises; one explored the effects
of combined aerobic exercise and inspiratory muscle training; and one explored the effects of combined aerobic exercise, strengthening
exercise  inspiratory  muscle  training  and  balance  training.  The  length  of  the  exercise  programmes  ranged  from  four  to  20  weeks,  with
exercises performed twice to five days a week.

Key results

Our results showed that people with NSCLC who exercised after lung surgery had better fitness level (measured using both a cycling test
and the six-minute walk test) and strength in their leg muscles compared to those that did not exercise. We also showed initial evidence

for better quality of life and less breathlessness in those who exercised. One adverse event (hip fracture) related to the intervention was
reported in one study. The effect of exercise training after lung surgery on grip strength, fatigue, and lung function was uncertain. We found
insufficient evidence for improvements in the strength of breathing muscles or feelings of anxiety and depression.

Quality of evidence

Overall the quality (certainty) of evidence for the outcomes was moderate, ranging between very low (for breathlessness) and high (for
fitness level measured via the six-minute walk test).

Description of the condition

Lung cancer is an important problem worldwide. Data from 2018
indicate that lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
in men and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in women
(Bray  2018).  Mortality  from  lung  cancer  is  high,  with  a  five-year
survival of 11% to 19%, making it the leading cause of death from
malignancy in high-income countries such as Australia (AIHW 2017),
the  USA  (Jemal  2017),  and  the  UK  (Office  for  National  Statistics
2015).  Non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  is  the  most  common
lung  cancer,  accounting  for  approximately  85%  of  all  cases  (Sher
2008). Survival from NSCLC is considerably better than for small cell
lung cancer (SCLC). Approximately 40% of people with NSCLC who
undergo complete lung resection of the primary tumour survive five
years  (Danish  Lung  Cancer  Registry  2009).  In  contrast,  for  people
with SCLC, metastasis is common at the time of diagnosis and lung
resection is rarely an option (Jett 2013).

Since  the  early  2000s,  there  has  been  an  increased  interest  in
outcomes  other  than  survival  for  people  diagnosed  with  NSCLC.
Notably,  people  with  this  condition  who  require  lung  resection
perceive physical debility as a far more important and undesirable
outcome than pulmonary complications such as lung collapse and
pneumonia (Cykert 2000). Earlier work has demonstrated impaired
exercise  capacity  in  people  with  lung  cancer  (Jones  2007).  The
reasons  for  this  are  likely  to  be  multifactorial.  Over  half  of  all
people  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer  have  an  underlying  chronic
lung disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)),
Mouronte-Roibas  2018,  that  impairs  exercise  capacity  (McCarthy
2015). Furthermore, people with lung cancer are affected by weight
loss,  anorexia,  anaemia,  protein  catabolism,  and  muscle  wasting
(Baracos  2010;  Murphy  2010).  Dyspnoea  and  fatigue  are  also
common  and  are  likely  to  result  in  a  decline  in  physical  activity
levels  (Granger  2014;  Granger  2016),  as  well  as  the  adoption  of  a
sedentary lifestyle (Cavalheri 2016; D'Silva 2018; O'Driscoll 1999).
Failure  to  engage  in  sufficient  physical  activity  to  meet  physical
activity  guidelines  has  been  reported  in  88%  and  70%  of  people
six months and 3.5 years after lung resection, respectively (Coups
2009),  suggesting  there  is  no  spontaneous  recovery  in  physical
activity following treatment. This decline in physical activity levels
results in skeletal  muscle and cardiovascular deconditioning and
serves  to  further  compromise  exercise  capacity  (Burtin  2017;
Cavalheri 2015).

Treatment for lung cancer compounds the decrements in exercise
capacity. Compared with preoperative measures, the peak rate of
oxygen uptake (VO2peak) has been shown to be reduced by 13%
and  28%  six  months  following  lobectomy  and  pneumonectomy,
respectively  (Nezu  1998),  and  it  is  up  to  40%  lower  compared
with  healthy  age-matched  peers  (Burtin  2017;  Cavalheri  2015).
Adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy initiates a 'deconditioning
storm' that further reduces the capacity to deliver or utilise oxygen
and  metabolic  substrate  during  exercise,  thereby  contributing  to
exercise intolerance, Jones 2008 and fatigue, Huang 2015. Of note,
the overall incidence of post-treatment fatigue in people with early
stage NSCLC is 60% (Huang 2015).

Another important outcome for people with lung cancer is health-
related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL).  At  the  time  of  diagnosis,  people
with  lung  cancer  present  with  impaired  HRQoL  and  considerable
psychological distress, such as feelings of anxiety and depression

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

(Dagnelie 2007; Sugimura 2006). People who have undergone lung
resection have been shown to have short-term (four months) and
long-term  (four  years)  impairments  in  HRQoL  (Cavalheri  2015;
Myrdal  2003).  These  impairments  were  of  similar  magnitude  to
those  reported  by  people  who  have  undergone  coronary  bypass
grafting (Myrdal 2003).

Description of the intervention

Exercise  training  was  the  intervention  studied  in  this  systematic
included  aerobic  exercises,  strengthening
review.  Training 
(resistance) exercises, or a combination of these, with or without
inspiratory  muscle  training.  Earlier  studies  have  shown  that
supervised  exercise  training  is  feasible  for  people  following  lung
resection  for  NSCLC  (Cesario  2007;  Schneider  2007;  Spruit  2006),
and our original Cochrane Review demonstrated improvements in
exercise capacity as measured via the six-minute walk test (6MWT)
(Cavalheri 2013a).

How the intervention might work

The  role  of  exercise  training  is  well  established  in  many  chronic
respiratory conditions, including COPD (McCarthy 2015), interstitial
lung disease (Dowman 2014), and asthma (Carson 2013). There is
especially abundant evidence, from over 60 randomised controlled
trials (RCTs), for people with COPD. Cochrane Reviews have shown
that in this population exercise training improves exercise capacity
and  HRQoL  (McCarthy  2015;  Puhan  2016),  as  well  as  reducing
symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue (McCarthy 2015). There is also
evidence  to  suggest  a  reduction  in  healthcare  utilisation  (Puhan
2016).  The  mechanisms  underlying  improvements  in  exercise
capacity  and  reductions  in  dyspnoea  on  exertion  relate,  at  least
in part, to an enhanced skeletal muscle function and a reduction
in  ventilation  requirements  at  submaximal  exercise  intensities
(Maltais  2014;  Porszasz  2005).  Previous  systematic  reviews  have
shown  that  exercise  training  confers  reductions  in  fatigue  and
improvements  in  HRQoL  in  people  with  other  forms  of  cancer,
such  as  prostate  and  breast  cancer  (Lahart  2018;  Mishra  2012).
We  hypothesised  that  exercise  training  would  also  be  effective
at  improving  outcomes  other  than  exercise  capacity  in  people
following treatment for NSCLC.

Why it is important to do this review

The  original  version  of  this  review  in  2013  was  undertaken  in
order  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  exercise  training  following  lung
resection  for  NSCLC,  but  also  to  identify  the  strengths  and
limitations  of  the  published  studies  in  this  area  and  gaps  in
the  literature.  The  original  review  included  three  RCTs  (Cavalheri
2013a),  and  we  concluded  that  exercise  training  conferred  an
increase in exercise capacity, measured as six-minute walk distance
(6MWD),  in  people  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  We  also
provided  important  considerations  on  how  future  studies  could
minimise  bias  and  methodological  heterogeneity.  Some  of  the
considerations  for  upcoming  studies  were  to:  (i)  collect  outcome
measures  immediately  before  and  after  the  exercise  training
intervention rather than before lung resection and on completion
of  the  exercise  training  intervention;  (ii)  choose  disease-specific
HRQoL  questionnaires;  (iii)  report  the  values  for  each  domain
that  contributes  to  HRQoL  as  well  as  the  total  score  obtained
from  HRQoL  questionnaires;  and  (iv)  report  the  mean  change
(and  standard  deviation  of  the  change)  in  outcomes  collected
immediately before and after the exercise training intervention. We

also  suggested  that  researchers  explore  other  variables  such  as
fatigue,  dyspnoea,  and  feelings  of  anxiety  and  depression.  In  the
current review we investigated whether exercise training following
resection  for  NSCLC  confers  benefit  in  outcome  measures  other
than 6MWD and also whether the certainty of the evidence found
has improved compared to the original review.

O B J E C T I V E S

The  primary  aim  of  this  review  was  to  determine  the  effects
of  exercise  training  on  exercise  capacity  and  adverse  events  in
people  following  lung  resection  (with  or  without  chemotherapy)
for  NSCLC.  The  secondary  aims  were  to  determine  the  effects
of  exercise  training  on  other  outcomes  such  as  HRQoL,  force-
generating  capacity  of  peripheral  muscles,  pressure-generating
capacity of the respiratory muscles, dyspnoea and fatigue, feelings
of anxiety and depression, lung function, and mortality.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

This  review  included  RCTs  in  which  the  study  participants  were
allocated to receive either exercise training or no exercise training
following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  Full  papers  and  abstracts
published in any language were eligible for inclusion.

Types of participants

Our  inclusion  criteria  comprised  participants  following  lung
resection  for  NSCLC,  performed  via  video-assisted  thoracoscopic
surgery  (VATS)  or  thoracotomy,  with  or  without  induction  or
adjuvant chemotherapy. We included study participants who had
undergone  lung  resection  via  either  approach  because  earlier
work  has  demonstrated  that  important  outcomes  such  as  short-
term  mortality,  length  of  hospital  stay,  and  hospitalisation  costs
were  similar  between  these  groups  (Gopaldas  2010).  This  is
despite  the  fact  that  people  who  undergo  resection  via  VATS
or  thoracotomy  differ  in  terms  of  pain,  HRQoL,  and  shoulder
dysfunction  (Bendixen  2016;  Landreneau  1993).  Participants  who
had  undergone  resections  of  any  type  (i.e.  wedge  resection,
segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy) were eligible for
inclusion. We excluded from this review people with SCLC because
metastasis is common at the time of diagnosis, and median survival
is usually less than 12 months (Dayen 2017).

Types of interventions

intervention  comprised  exercise  training  that 

The 
included
aerobic  exercise,  resistance  exercise,  or  a  combination  of  both,
and  started  within  12  months  of  lung  resection.  We  did  not
include  studies  that  investigated  the  effectiveness  of  inspiratory
muscle  training  alone.  Training  sessions  could  be  supervised
or  unsupervised,  or  a  combination  of  both.  Where  possible,
we  recorded  characteristics  of  the  training  programme,  such  as
frequency,  intensity,  type,  duration,  adherence,  and  extent  of
supervision.  We  also  documented  any  adverse  events.  Control
groups received usual care with either no exercise training or only
general instruction to exercise.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

1. Exercise  capacity  as  measured  either  as  VO2peak  during  a

maximal incremental exercise test or as the 6MWD.

2. Safety of the intervention as measured by numbers of adverse

events.

Secondary outcomes

1. General HRQoL (e.g. the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36

General Health Survey (SF-36)).

2. Disease-specific  HRQoL  (e.g.  the  European  Organisation  for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)).

3. Force-generating capacity of peripheral muscles (e.g. measures

of lower limb muscle strength).

4. Pressure-generating  capacity  of  respiratory  muscles  (e.g.

maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures).

5. Dyspnoea (e.g. the Borg category ratio scale, the visual analogue
scale)  or  functional  limitation  during  daily  life  resulting  from
dyspnoea (e.g. the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale).
6. Fatigue  (e.g.  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness

Therapy - Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-fatigue)).

7. Feelings of anxiety and depression (e.g. the Hospital Anxiety and

Depression scale (HADS)).

8. Lung function (e.g. volumes and diffusing capacity).
9. Mortality.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

identified  trials  from  electronic  bibliographic  databases

We 
including:

1. the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL;
Issue  2,  2019)  in  the  Cochrane  Library  (searched  11  February
2019);

2. MEDLINE (via PubMed) (2013 to 11 February 2019);
3. Embase (via Ovid) (2013 to 11 February 2019);
4. SciELO  (The  Scientific  Electronic  Library  Online)  (2013  to  11

February 2019); and

5. PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) (2013 to 11 February

2019).

The search strategies used for MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase are
presented in Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3, respectively.
The  search  string  for  MEDLINE  was  developed  according  to  the
Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy, sensitivity maximising
version (2008 version) as referenced in Section 6.4.11.1 and detailed
in  box  6.4.b  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of
Interventions (Higgins 2011). We adapted the strategy for use in the
other databases.

Searching other resources

We screened the reference lists of all primary studies and review
articles  for  additional  references.  We  contacted  the  authors  of
included trials to inquire about further published and unpublished
studies.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (VC  and  CB)  independently  examined  the
identified  by  the  literature  search  using  Covidence
studies 
(Covidence 2017). We first excluded studies based on their title and
abstract and recorded the reasons for exclusion. We subsequently
obtained  the  full  texts  of  the  remaining  studies,  and  the  two
review authors independently examined these, coding them as (i)
'include'; (ii) 'unclear'; or (iii) 'exclude' based on the review criteria.
Any disagreements were resolved by consensus, and a full record
was kept of the decisions.

Data extraction and management

Two  review  authors  (VC  and  VRF)  extracted  data  using  a
standardised form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion
or  by  involving  a  third  review  author  (CB)  when  necessary.  Once
consensus was reached, the first review author (VC) entered data
into Review Manager 5 software (RevMan 2014)). The data entered
included  study  details,  participant  characteristics,  and  outcome
measures related to the aims of this review. Where applicable, we
asked  the  authors  of  the  included  studies  to  verify  the  data  and
provide details of missing data.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Three review authors (VC, CB, and VRF) independently appraised
the  risk  of  bias  of  the  included  studies  using  the  Cochrane
Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. Any disagreements were resolved
by  consensus.  We  judged  risk  of  bias  as  high,  low,  or  unclear  for
selection  bias  (i.e.  random  sequence  generation  and  allocation
concealment); performance bias (i.e. blinding of participants and
personnel);  detection  bias  (i.e.  blinding  of  outcome  assessor);
attrition  bias  (i.e.  incomplete  outcome  data);  reporting  bias  (i.e.
selective outcome reporting); and other potential sources of bias.
The judgement was accompanied by a direct quote, specific details
of the study, or both, in the 'Risk of bias' table. Where applicable,
we contacted study authors to seek clarification on issues related
to bias. We generated both a 'Risk of bias’ graph (i.e. bar chart) and
'Risk of bias' summary (i.e. traffic lights).

Measures of treatment effect

The  review  did  not  have  dichotomous  outcomes.  We  calculated
the  mean  differences  (MD)  and  standardised  mean  differences
(SMD) together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for the continuous outcomes. Mean difference was calculated
for  exercise  capacity  (VO2peak  and  6MWD),  general  and  disease-
specific  HRQoL,  handgrip  force,  and  lung  function  (forced  vital
capacity  (FVC)).  Standardised  mean  difference  was  calculated
for  force-generating  capacity  of  quadriceps  muscle,  dyspnoea,
fatigue, and lung function (forced expiratory volume (FEV1)), as the
included studies either measured these outcomes using different
tools/tests or reported their findings in different ways (e.g. absolute
values versus % of predicted values).

We  used  either  postintervention  values  (with  their  respective
standard  deviation  (SD))  or  mean  changes  (with  their  respective
SD)  in  the  meta-analyses  that  reported  results  as  MD.  When  the
SD  of  the  mean  change  was  not  reported  in  the  included  study,
not  provided  by  the  authors,  or  not  able  to  be  imputed  through
calculation,  pre-intervention  SD  was  used.  In  meta-analyses  that
reported  results  as  SMD,  studies  that  reported  postintervention

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

values  (with  their  respective  SD)  and  those  that  reported  mean
changes  (with  their  respective  SD)  were  placed  in  separate
subgroups.

Unit of analysis issues

We  planned  that  for  studies  that  presented  postintervention
data  at  two  or  more  time  points  (e.g.  exercise  capacity
reported  immediately  postintervention  and  at  three  months
postoperatively),  we  would  not  combine  the  results  from  the
different time points in a single meta-analysis. We only used data
collected immediately after completion of the intervention period.

Dealing with missing data

We  contacted  the  authors  of  all  the  included  studies  to  obtain
missing data. When the specific data requested were provided, they
were included in the meta-analyses. We did not impute any data.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed statistical heterogeneity across the studies using the I2
statistic. We considered values of I2 greater than 50% as substantial
heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). If we detected substantial statistical
heterogeneity, we investigated whether clinical or methodological
heterogeneity were the potential causes.

Assessment of reporting biases

We searched online trial registries in order to investigate potential
publication  bias  and  to  assess  potential  outcome  reporting  bias
in the included studies. As the number of studies included in this
review was less than 10, we did not generate funnel plots.

Data synthesis

We used Review Manager 5 to conduct the statistical analyses and
generate  forest  plots  (RevMan  2014).  We  initially  used  a  random-
effects  model  for  calculating  summary  estimates.  However,  if
the  studies  were  clinically,  methodologically,  and  statistically
homogeneous,  we  changed  to  a  fixed-effect  model.  We  meta-
analysed  the  results  of  homogeneous  studies  using  the  inverse-
variance  DerSimonian  and  Laird  method  (DerSimonian  1986).
Where  data  aggregation  was  not  possible  due  to  considerable
clinical, methodological, or statistical heterogeneity, we provided a
narrative discussion of the data only.

GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table

In order to interpret the findings, we created a GRADE Summary of
findings  table  (Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison)  in
which we included the following outcomes: (i) exercise capacity; (ii)
safety of the intervention; (iii) general HRQoL; (iv) force-generating
capacity of the peripheral muscles (quadriceps); and (v) dyspnoea
(Atkins 2004; Guyatt 2008). We assessed the certainty of evidence
for each outcome by downgrading based on the GRADE criteria. We
used the methods and recommendations described in Chapter 11
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011).

Sensitivity analysis

We  performed  sensitivity  analyses  when  we  detected  substantial
heterogeneity (i.e. I2 greater than 50%) to investigate the effects of
studies rated as having a high or unclear risk of detection or attrition
bias.

Results of the search

Our  search  of  all  the  databases  in  February  2019  yielded  a  total
of 1380 records: 359 from CENTRAL; 401 from MEDLINE; 590 from

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Embase; 29 from PEDro; and one from SciELO. We identified one
extra  record  through  other  sources,  therefore  the  total  number
of  new  records  identified  was  1381  (Figure  1).  After  removal  of
duplicates,  1106  records  remained.  Of  these  we  excluded  1082
records based on the title and abstract and assessed 24 full-texts
and  conference  abstracts  for  eligibility.  We  included  5  studies  (9
records) identified in the current version of the review, in addition
to 3 studies (5 records) identified in the original review (Cavalheri
2013a).  We  were  able  to  contact  authors  of  three  new  eligible
studies to obtain missing data.

Study

We included the three RCTs, Arbane 2011; 'Brocki 2010'; Stigt 2013,
from the 2013 version of this review (Cavalheri 2013a). We included
five  new  RCTs  for  this  update,  therefore  a  total  of  eight  RCTs
(14 records) contributed data to the meta-analyses (Arbane 2014;
Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen 2015; Messaggi-Sartor 2018; Salhi 2015).
The eight RCTs included 450 participants. The study named 'Brocki
2010' in the original version of the review is now named Brocki 2014.
The record from 2010 was a conference proceeding, and the final
full text of that study, Brocki 2014, was found through the database
search for this update review.

Population

Six  studies  included  only  participants  with  NSCLC  following  lung
resection. Two studies also included a small number of participants
who either had thoracic cancers other than NSCLC or who did not
undergo  lung  resection  (Brocki  2014;  Salhi  2015).  We  contacted
the authors of these two studies, and they provided data specific
to  the  participants  with  NSCLC  who  underwent  lung  resection.
The  sample  size  of  the  included  studies  ranged  between  17  and
131,  with  the  mean  age  of  the  participants  ranging  between  63
and  71  years.  Of  the  450  participants,  180  (40%)  were  female.
At  baseline,  the  intervention  and  control  groups  in  all  included
studies were balanced for age. Both baseline VO2peak and baseline
6MWD  were  also  balanced  between  the  intervention  and  control
groups  in  the  studies  that  included  these  measures  (VO2peak:
Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen 2015; Messaggi-Sartor 2018; Salhi 2015.
6MWD:  Arbane  2011;  Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri  2017;  Salhi  2015;
Stigt  2013).  Six  studies  reported  on  extent  of  lung  resection  (i.e.
wedge  resection,  lobectomy/bilobectomy,  pneumonectomy)  and
demonstrated  balanced  numbers  between  groups  (Arbane  2011;
Brocki  2014;  Edvardsen  2015;  Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015;
Stigt  2013).  Four  studies  reported  on  type  of  surgical  procedure
(i.e.  VATS  or  thoracotomy)  (Arbane  2011;  Arbane  2014;  Cavalheri
2017; Messaggi-Sartor 2018); three of these studies demonstrated
no between-group difference in type of surgical procedure (Arbane
2014; Cavalheri 2017; Messaggi-Sartor 2018). One study mentioned
that only two participants had undergone VATS (Arbane 2011), but
did not report the group allocation of these participants.

Setting

in  the  UK  (Arbane  2011;  Arbane
The  studies  were  based 
2014), Denmark (Brocki 2014), Australia (Cavalheri 2017), Norway
(Edvardsen  2015),  Spain  (Messaggi-Sartor  2018),  Belgium  (Salhi
2015), and the Netherlands (Stigt 2013). The studies were published
between 2011 and 2018.

Intervention

There  was  considerable  variation  in  length,  type,  frequency,  and
intensity  of  the  exercise  programmes  that  were  investigated.
Interventions  ranged  in  length  from  four  weeks,  Arbane  2014,  to
20 weeks, Edvardsen 2015. The exercise programmes in all studies
had  a  supervised  component,  whilst  in  four  studies  they  also

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

had a home-based component (Arbane 2011; Arbane 2014; Brocki
2014;  Cavalheri  2017).  The  setting  for  the  supervised  component
was  varied,  including  hospital-based  outpatient  programmes
(Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri  2017;  Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Stigt  2013),
fitness centre-based programmes (Edvardsen 2015), and inpatient
programmes  (Arbane  2011;  Arbane  2014).  In  two  studies  (Arbane
2011; Arbane 2014), home-based exercise was the main component
of the exercise training programme.

The  interventions  consisted  of  combined  aerobic  and  resistance
exercise 
in  six  studies  (Arbane  2011;  Arbane  2014;  Brocki
2014;  Cavalheri  2017;  Salhi  2015;  Stigt  2013);  combined  aerobic
exercise  and  inspiratory  muscle  training  in  one  study  (Messaggi-
Sartor 2018); and combined aerobic exercise, resistance exercise,
inspiratory  muscle  training  and  balance  training  in  one  study
(Edvardsen  2015).  The 
frequency  of  the  exercise  training
programme  varied  from  twice  a  week  to  five  days  a  week.  The
intensity  of  the  aerobic  exercise  was  variably  reported,  ranging
between  60%  to  90%  of  maximum  heart  rate  or  baseline  peak
work  rate,  80%  of  the  average  speed  achieved  on  the  6MWT,  or
an  intensity  that  elicited  scores  between  11  to  15  on  rating  of
perceived  exertion  scale.  The  intensity  of  the  resistance  training
was not reported in three studies (Arbane 2014; Brocki 2014; Stigt
2013); was set at a specific initial weight (e.g. 2 lb; 1.5 kg) in two
studies (Arbane 2011; Cavalheri 2017); and was reported as 50% 1
repetition-maximum (RM) in one study, Salhi 2015, and 6 to 12 RM
in one study, Edvardsen 2015. Edvardsen 2015 did not report the
intensity  of  inspiratory  muscle  training,  whereas  Messaggi-Sartor
2018  reported  starting  inspiratory  muscle  training  at  50%  of  the
maximal inspiratory pressure (after one familiarisation session at
30% of the maximal inspiratory pressure).

The  control  groups  received  usual  care  that  comprised  routine
outpatient  appointments  and  pain  medication  prescription
(Arbane  2011;  Arbane  2014;  Cavalheri  2017;  Edvardsen  2015;
Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Stigt  2013),  phone  calls  (Arbane  2011;
Cavalheri  2017),  breathing  exercises  and  mobilisation  (Arbane
(Brocki  2014).
2014),  and 
Participants  in  two  studies  were  advised  to  perform  physical

Excluded studies

In  this  update,  of  the  24  records  for  which  the  full  texts  were
reviewed,  15  were  excluded  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  did  not
meet review criteria (n = 12); and (ii) authors did not reply to several
contact attempts to obtain the specific data needed for this review
(n  =  3).  These  reasons  are  summarised  in  the  Characteristics  of
excluded studies section.

Risk of bias in included studies

Three  out  of  the  seven  domains  included  in  the  Cochrane
Collaboration's  'Risk  of  bias'  tool  were  identical  across  the
eight  included  studies  (random  sequence  generation,  allocation
concealment,  and  blinding  of  participants  and  personnel).  For
details  regarding  risk  of  bias

Allocation

All  eight  included  studies  reported  using  a  process  of  randomly
allocating  participants  to  the  two  groups,  and  in  all  studies  this

randomisation  sequence  was  concealed.  We  therefore  judged  all
the included studies to be at low risk of selection bias.

Blinding

Neither  the  participants  nor  the  personnel  responsible  for
implementing  the  intervention  were  blind  to  group  allocation
in  any  of  the  included  studies.  This  lack  of  blinding  could
have  influenced  the  results,  as  the  participants  may  have  been
influenced  by  a  placebo  effect.  Hence,  we  rated  all  the  included
studies  as  at  high  risk  of  performance  bias.  Regarding  detection
bias,  in  three  studies  blinding  of  the  outcome  assessor  was
fully ensured (Brocki 2014; Cavalheri 2017; Messaggi-Sartor 2018),
therefore these studies were rated as at low risk of detection bias.
As  the  study  by  Stigt  2013  did  not  describe  blinding  of  outcome
assessors, and as the authors did not reply to our email specifically
asking  about  this  issue,  we  rated  the  risk  of  detection  bias  as
unclear. We rated the other four studies as at high risk of detection
bias (Arbane 2011; Arbane 2014; Edvardsen 2015; Salhi 2015).

Incomplete outcome data

We  rated  five  studies  as  at  low  risk  of  bias  due  to  incomplete
outcome  data  (Arbane  2011;  Arbane  2014;  Cavalheri  2017;
Edvardsen  2015;  Salhi  2015),  as  missing  outcome  data  were
balanced between the intervention and control groups in numbers,
with  similar  reasons  for  missing  data  across  groups.  Although
Brocki  2014  analysed  their  data  according  to  the  intention-to-
treat principle, details about the missing cases were insufficient to
permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias, therefore we rated
this study as at unclear risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data.
We rated two studies as at high risk of bias (Messaggi-Sartor 2018;
Stigt  2013),  mainly  due  to  investigators  performing  ‘as-treated’
rather than intention-to-treat analysis, Messaggi-Sartor 2018, and
a large loss to follow-up, with some postintervention data reported
in only 40% to 60% of participants (Stigt 2013).

Selective reporting

We judged two studies as having a low risk of reporting bias (Arbane
2014;  Brocki  2014).  We  judged  one  study  as  at  unclear  risk  of
reporting  bias  due  to  insufficient  information  to  judge  this  item

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

(i.e. no access to trial registration) (Arbane 2011). We reviewed the
trial  registration  of  five  studies  (Cavalheri  2017;  Edvardsen  2015;
Messaggi-Sartor 2018; Salhi 2015; Stigt 2013), and noticed that one
to two prespecified outcomes were not reported in the published
paper,  therefore  we  rated  these  five  studies  as  at  high  risk  of
reporting bias.

Other potential sources of bias

We rated two studies as at high risk of other potential sources of
bias (Arbane 2011; Stigt 2013). The potential sources of bias were
as  follows:  (i)  both  studies  did  not  collect  all  outcome  measures
at  identical  time  points;  (ii)  in  Arbane  2011  the  control  group
had  five  participants  classified  as  stage  IV  disease,  whereas  the
intervention  group  had  none  in  this  stage;  and  (iii)  Stigt  2013
had more participants following chemotherapy randomised to the
intervention group, and there was a higher attrition rate for those
who had chemotherapy compared to those who did not. We rated
the remaining studies as at low risk of other potential sources of
bias.

Effects of interventions

See:  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  Exercise
group compared to control group for non-small cell lung cancer

We  included  data  pertaining  to  exercise  capacity,  HRQoL,  force-
generating capacity of the peripheral muscles, dyspnoea, fatigue,
and lung function in the meta-analyses.

I. Primary outcome: exercise capacity

Four  studies  reported  the  VO2peak  as  their  measure  of  exercise
capacity  (Cavalheri  2017;  Edvardsen  2015;  Messaggi-Sartor  2018;
Salhi  2015).  On  completion  of  the  intervention  period,  VO2peak
was  significantly  higher  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to
the  control  group  (mean  difference  (MD)  2.97  mL/kg/min,  95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 4.02 mL/kg/min, I2 = 0%, 4 studies,
135 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) (Analysis 1.1; Figure
4).

Figure 4.   Forest plot of comparison: 1 Exercise group versus control group, outcome: 1.1 Exercise capacity (VO2peak
in mL/kg/min).

Five  studies  reported  the  6MWD  as  their  measure  of  exercise
capacity  (Arbane  2011;  Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri  2017;  Salhi  2015;

Stigt 2013). On completion of the intervention period, 6MWD was
significantly  higher  in  the  intervention  group  compared  to  the

control group (MD 57 m, 95% CI 34 to 80 m, I2 = 22%, 5 studies, 182
participants, high-certainty evidence) (Analysis 1.2; Figure 5). The
magnitude of the effect found (MD = 57 m) exceeded the minimal

important difference (MID) of the 6MWD reported for people with
lung cancer (i.e. 22 to 42 m) (Granger 2015).

Figure 5.   Forest plot of comparison: 1 Exercise group versus control group, outcome: 1.2 Exercise capacity (6MWD in
metres).

I. Primary outcome: safety of the intervention

Four  of  the  eight  included  studies  reported  data  on  safety  of  the
intervention (i.e. adverse events related to the intervention) (Brocki
2014;  Edvardsen  2015;  Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015).  Three
of  these  four  studies  reported  no  adverse  events  (Brocki  2014;
Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015),  whereas  one  reported  a  hip
fracture during balance training (Edvardsen 2015).

II. Secondary outcome: general HRQoL

Four studies reported general HRQoL using the SF-36 (higher scores
indicate better HRQoL) (Arbane 2014; Brocki 2014; Cavalheri 2017;
Edvardsen  2015).  On  completion  of  the  intervention  period,  the
physical  component  score  of  the  SF-36  was  significantly  higher
in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD 5.0
points, 95% CI 2.3 to 7.7 points, I2 = 44%, 4 studies, 208 participants,
low-certainty  evidence)  (Analysis  1.3;  Figure  6).  On  completion

of  the  intervention  period,  there  was  an  uncertain  effect  for  the
mental component score of the SF-36 (MD −2.3 points, 95% CI −11.3
to  6.6  points,  I2  =  87%,  4  studies,  208  participants,  low-certainty
evidence) (Analysis 1.4). Heterogeneity was substantial in the meta-
analysis for the mental component score of the SF-36 (I2 = 87%),
therefore  we  undertook  sensitivity  analyses.  Both  the  uncertain
effect  and  the  substantial  heterogeneity  were  maintained  when
(i)  the  two  studies  rated  as  having  a  high  risk  of  detection  bias
were  excluded  (MD  −5.3  points,  95%  CI  −12.1  to  1.6  points,  I2  =
72%)  (Arbane  2014;  Edvardsen  2015);  and  (ii)  the  study  rated  as
having  an  unclear  risk  of  attrition  bias  was  excluded  (MD  −3.2
points, 95% CI −17.9 to 11.6 points, I2 = 91%) (Brocki 2014). When
the two studies rated as having a high risk of reporting bias were
excluded (Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen 2015), the uncertain effect was
maintained (MD −3.7 points, 95% CI −11.4 to 4.0 points), and there
was no substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 21%).

quality of life (SF-36 - physical component score).

III. Secondary outcome: disease-specific HRQoL

Four  studies  reported  disease-specific  HRQoL  using  the  EORTC
QLQ-C30 (Arbane 2011; Cavalheri 2017; Messaggi-Sartor 2018; Salhi
2015).  The  four  studies  reported  the  global  health  component
score of the EORTC QLQ-C30; two studies reported scores for the
functional  and  symptom  scales  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  (Arbane
2011;  Cavalheri  2017);  and  two  studies  reported  the  physical
functioning  component  score  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  (Messaggi-
Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015).  Higher  scores  indicate  better  HRQoL
for  the  global  health  and  physical  functioning  components.
Conversely, for symptoms, higher scores indicate worse symptoms.
On completion of the intervention period, there was an uncertain
effect on all components of disease-specific HRQoL (global health:
MD  −0.14  points,  95%  CI  −7.24  to  6.96  points,  I2  =  0%,  4  studies,
111 participants (Analysis 1.5); functional scales: MD −0.82 points,
95%  CI  −8.81  to  7.17  points,  I2  =  0%,  2  studies,  60  participants
(Analysis 1.6); symptom scales: MD −3.05 points, 95% CI −10.58 to
4.47 points, I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants (Analysis 1.7); physical
functioning: MD 2.05 points, 95% CI −3.50 to 7.59 points, I2 = 0%, 2
studies, 51 participants (Analysis 1.8)).

IV. Secondary outcome: force-generating capacity of
peripheral muscles

Four studies measured force-generating capacity of the quadriceps
muscle (Arbane 2011; Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen 2015; Salhi 2015).
This  outcome  measure  was  assessed  using  different  techniques/
measures  in  the  four  studies.  Furthermore,  two  studies  reported
postintervention  values  (Arbane  2011;  Edvardsen  2015),  whereas
the  other  two  studies  reported  mean  change  values  (Cavalheri
2017; Salhi 2015). Consequently, we have presented the final result
as  standardised  mean  difference  (SMD),  and  subgroups  (studies
that reported postintervention values; studies that reported mean
change  values)  were  included  in  the  meta-analysis.  Overall,  on
completion of the intervention period, force-generating capacity of
the quadriceps muscle was significantly higher in the intervention
group compared to the control group (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1,
I2 = 0%, 4 studies, 133 participants, moderate-certainty evidence)
(Analysis  1.9).  There  was  no  different  between  the  results  of  the
subgroups (P = 0.78; I2 = 0%).

Two studies measured handgrip force (Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen
2015).  On  completion  of  the  intervention  period,  there  was  an
uncertain effect on handgrip force (MD 3.19 kg, 95% CI −1.14 to 7.52
kg, I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 75 participants) (Analysis 1.10).

V. Secondary outcome: pressure-generating capacity of
respiratory muscles

Only  one  study  measured  the  pressure-generating  capacity  of
inspiratory  and  expiratory  muscles  (Messaggi-Sartor  2018).  On
completion  of  the  intervention  period,  there  was  no  significant
difference between the intervention and control in both maximal
inspiratory  pressure  (MD  13  %  predicted,  95%  CI  −37  to  11  %
predicted)  and  maximal  expiratory  pressure  (MD  10  %  predicted,
95% CI −27 to 8 % predicted).

VI. Secondary outcome: dyspnoea

Three  studies  measured  dyspnoea  (Edvardsen  2015;  Messaggi-
Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015).  Two  of  these  studies  reported  the
dyspnoea  component  score  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  (Edvardsen
2015; Messaggi-Sartor 2018), whereas one used the visual analogue
scale  (Salhi  2015).  In  both  tools,  higher  scores  indicate  worse
dyspnoea.  Furthermore,  two  studies  reported  postintervention
values  (Edvardsen  2015;  Salhi  2015),  whereas  the  remaining
study  reported  mean  change  values  (Messaggi-Sartor  2018).
Consequently,  we  have  presented  the  final  result  as  SMD,  and
subgroups  (studies  that  reported  postintervention  values;  study
that  reported  mean  change  values)  were  included  in  the  meta-
analysis.  Overall,  on  completion  of  the  intervention  period,
dyspnoea was significantly less in the intervention group compared
to the control group (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.81 to −0.05, I2 = 37%,
3 studies, 110 participants, very low-certainty evidence) (Analysis
1.11).  In  the  subgroup  of  studies  that  reported  postintervention
values,  dyspnoea  was  significantly  less  in  the  intervention  group
compared to the control group (SMD −0.59, 95% CI −1.02 to −0.16, I2
= 0%, 2 studies, 87 participants). No between-group difference was
demonstrated in the study that reported mean change values (SMD
0.15, 95% CI −0.67 to 0.98, 1 study, 23 participants).

VII. Secondary outcome: fatigue

Three  studies  measured  fatigue  (Cavalheri  2017;  Messaggi-Sartor
2018; Salhi 2015). Two studies measured fatigue using the FACIT-
fatigue  (Cavalheri  2017;  Salhi  2015),  whereas  one  study  used  the
fatigue component score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Messaggi-Sartor
2018). For the FACIT-fatigue, lower scores indicate greater fatigue,
whereas  for  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  higher  scores  indicate  greater
fatigue. In order to pool these data, we changed the direction of the
mean change in scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (i.e. negative values
were  made  positive).  On  completion  of  the  intervention  period,
there was an uncertain effect on fatigue (SMD −0.05, 95% CI −0.52
to 0.43, I2 = 0%, 3 studies, 68 participants) (Analysis 1.12).

VIII. Secondary outcome: feelings of anxiety and depression

Only one study measured feelings of anxiety and depression using
the  HADS  (Cavalheri  2017).  On  completion  of  the  intervention
period in this study, there was no significant difference between the
intervention and control groups in feelings of anxiety (mean ± SD
intervention group: 3 ± 2 points to 5 ± 4 points and control group:
2 ± 2 points to 4 ± 5 points; P = 0.17) and depression (mean ± SD
intervention group: 2 ± 2 points to 4 ± 5 points and control group: 3
± 3 points to 4 ± 3 points; P = 0.40).

IX. Secondary outcome: lung function

Four  studies  reported  measures  of  FEV1  (Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri
2017;  Edvardsen  2015;  Stigt  2013).  One  study  reported  FEV1  as
a  %  of  predicted  values  (Edvardsen  2015),  whereas  three  studies
reported FEV1 in absolute value (litres) (Brocki 2014; Cavalheri 2017;
Stigt  2013).  Furthermore,  two  studies  reported  postintervention
values  (Edvardsen  2015;  Stigt  2013),  whilst  the  other  two  studies
reported  mean  change  values  (Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri  2017).
Consequently,  we  have  presented  the  final  result  as  SMD,  and
subgroups (studies that reported postintervention values; studies
that  reported  mean  change  values)  were  included  in  the  meta-
analysis. Overall, on completion of the intervention period, there
was an uncertain effect on FEV1 (SMD −0.06, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.25,
I2 = 0%, 4 studies, 166 participants) (Analysis 1.13). There was no
difference between the results of the subgroups (P = 0.59; I2 = 0%).

Two  studies  reported  measures  of  FVC  (Brocki  2014;  Cavalheri
2017).  On  completion  of  the  intervention  period,  there  was  an
uncertain effect on FVC (MD −0.06 L, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.15 L, I2 = 0%,
2 studies, 83 participants) (Analysis 1.14).

V. Secondary outcome: mortality

Summary of main results

This  review  provides  moderate-  to  high-certainty  evidence  that,
in  people  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC,  exercise  training
increased VO2peak (MD 2.97 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.02 mL/
kg/min);  6MWD  (MD  57  m,  95%  CI  34  to  80  m);  and  quadriceps
muscle  force  (SMD  0.75,  95%  CI  0.4  to  1.1).  One  adverse  event
(hip  fracture)  related  to  the  intervention  was  reported  in  one  of
the  included  studies.  Low-certainty  evidence  also  suggested  that
exercise training improved the physical component score of general
HRQoL  (MD  5.0  points,  95%  CI  2.3  to  7.7  points)  and  relieved

dyspnoea (SMD −0.43, 95% CI −0.81 to −0.05) in people following
lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  We  observed  uncertain  effects  for
disease-specific HRQoL, handgrip force, fatigue, and lung function.
Data were insufficient to comment on the effect of exercise training
on  maximal  inspiratory  and  expiratory  pressures  and  feelings  of
anxiety  and  depression.  The  included  studies  did  not  report  on
mortality.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The  update  of  this  systematic  review  was  warranted  as  we  were
able to include five additional studies, almost tripling the number
of studies in the original review (Cavalheri 2013a), and providing a
2.5-fold increase on the number of participants (178 to 450). The
updated meta-analyses investigating the effects of exercise training
following lung resection for NSCLC on exercise capacity were able
to  provide  novel,  moderate-certainty  evidence  for  improvements
in  VO2peak  as  well  as  confirm  and  strengthen  the  certainty  of
the previous finding of improvements in 6MWD. Exercise capacity
in  people  with  NSCLC  is  adversely  affected  by  several  factors
including  the  tumour  itself,  coexisting  lung  disease  as  well  as
treatment  for  the  condition,  which  may  include  resection  of  the
tumour  with  or  without  adjuvant  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy
(Jones 2009). Of note, earlier work that assessed several outcomes
such  as  exercise  capacity,  HRQoL,  muscle  force,  lung  function,
and  feelings  of  anxiety  and  depression  reported  that,  compared
to  healthy  controls,  the  greatest  impairment  demonstrated  in
people following lung resection for NSCLC was in exercise capacity
(Cavalheri  2015).  In  fact,  15  of  the  21  participants  (i.e.  71%)
had  a  VO2peak  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal  established  in
healthy controls (Cavalheri 2015). Our findings of improved exercise
capacity are particularly relevant because both VO2peak and 6MWD
are valuable prognostic indicators in this population (Jones 2010;
Zarogoulidis 2012). For example, a longitudinal study that followed
398  participants  with  NSCLC  for  30.8  months  demonstrated  that
each 1 mL/kg/min increase in VO2peak was associated with a 4%
reduction in all-cause mortality (Jones 2010). Regarding the 6MWD,
the  magnitude  of  the  effect  found  in  this  update  (MD  =  57  m)
exceeded  the  minimal  important  difference  (MID)  of  the  6MWD
reported  for  people  with  lung  cancer  (i.e.  22  to  42  m)  (Granger
2015). In addition to being statistically significant, the magnitude
of  improvement  in  exercise  capacity  was  therefore  also  clinically
important. We did not investigate maintenance of improvements
in  exercise  capacity  in  this  review,  and  future  studies  should
investigate strategies to maintain these gains.

Three  of  the  four  included  studies  reporting  on  adverse  events
found  no  adverse  events  during  exercise  training  (Brocki  2014;
Messaggi-Sartor  2018;  Salhi  2015).  Edvardsen  2015  reported  the
occurrence  of  a  hip  fracture  during  balance  training,  a  type  of
training  that  was  only  conducted  in  that  study.  When  needed,
balance  training  should  therefore  be  performed  under  close
supervision, and in proximity to a railing or other secure support
(Beck 2017).

Our  review  suggests  that  exercise  training  improved  the  physical
component  score  of  general  HRQoL,  as  measured  by  the  SF-36,
in  people  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  This  finding  is
important  because,  compared  to  pre-surgical  scores,  people
with  NSCLC  present  with  a  worse  physical  component  score
for  HRQoL  at  six  months  following  lung  resection,  with  little
change up to two years afterwards (Poghosyan 2013). Furthermore,

the  magnitude  of  the  between-group  difference  in  the  physical
component  score  of  HRQoL  found  in  the  current  review  was
5  points,  which  exceeded  the  MID  for  the  SF-36  (i.e.  3  to  5
points)  (Samsa  1999).  This  improvement  in  HRQoL  following  a
programme  of  exercise  training  is  in  agreement  with  findings  of
systematic  reviews  in  people  with  chronic  lung  diseases  such  as
COPD,  McCarthy  2015;  Puhan  2016,  and  interstitial  lung  disease,
Dowman  2014,  as  well  as  in  women  with  breast  cancer,  Lahart
2018.  Conversely,  improvements  in  the  mental  component  score
of  general  HRQoL  were  not  demonstrated  in  the  current  review.
The meta-analysis undertaken for this outcome was the only one
that presented substantial heterogeneity. However, both the lack
of improvement in the mental component score of general HRQoL
and  the  substantial  heterogeneity  were  unresolved  by  sensitivity
analyses.  It  is  possible  that  this  lack  of  improvement  may  be
attributable to minimal impairment in this domain and, therefore,
little  scope  for  improvement  with  exercise  training.  However,  it
is  also  likely  that  exercise  training  alone  has  no  effect  on  the
mental component of HRQoL, and that a combination of exercise
training  with  other  interventions  provided  by  a  multidisciplinary
team including psychologists and other health professionals needs
to  be  considered.  Our  finding  of  no  between-group  difference  in
disease-specific HRQoL, measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30, may
reflect  that  the  meta-analyses  lacked  statistical  power  to  detect
changes  in  disease-specific  HRQoL,  especially  for  the  subscales
of  physical  functioning,  function,  and  symptoms.  The  number  of
participants  in  the  meta-analyses  for  the  disease-specific  HRQoL
subscales  ranged  between  51  and  60,  a  sample  size  much  lower
than  that  for  the  physical  component  score  of  general  HRQoL  (n
=  208).  Larger  RCTs  are  needed  to  further  investigate  the  effects
of exercise training on disease-specific HRQoL in people following
lung resection for NSCLC.

A  novel  finding  of  the  current  review  is  that  exercise  training
improved force-generating capacity of the quadriceps muscle. We
included four studies in the meta-analysis (Arbane 2011; Cavalheri
2017;  Edvardsen  2015;  Salhi  2015),  and,  despite  assessing  force-
generating  capacity  of  the  quadriceps  muscle  using  different
methods  (e.g.  femoral  nerve  stimulation,  maximal  isometric
force,  and  one-repetition  maximum),  results  were  similar  across
the  four  studies,  and  the  I2  in  the  meta-analysis  was  0%.  A
previous cross-sectional study in 64 people following lung resection
for  NSCLC  demonstrated  that  force-generating  capacity  of  the
muscle  is  only  modestly  reduced  in  this  population  (Burtin
2017),  that  is  the  average  isometric  quadriceps  force  was  89  ±
25%  of  predicted  (Burtin  2017).  However,  as  discussed  by  the
authors  of  that  study,  the  high  SD  (i.e.  25%)  suggests  substantial
heterogeneity  in  isometric  quadriceps  muscle  force  across  the
population,  with  muscle  weakness  being  more  pronounced
in  those  patients  with  lower  exercise  capacity.  Some  people
with  NSCLC  may  therefore  present  with  significant  reduction  in
isometric  quadriceps  muscle  force  following  lung  resection,  and
the improved force-generating capacity of the quadriceps muscle
after  exercise  training  demonstrated  in  the  current  review  is
specifically relevant to this group.

We  did  not  find  changes  in  handgrip  force  following  exercise
training.  This  finding  was  expected,  as  one  principle  of  exercise
training  is  specificity,  and  training  of  the  hand  muscles  was  not
part  of  the  exercise  training  programmes  in  the  two  studies  that
measured  this  outcome  (Cavalheri  2017;  Edvardsen  2015).  The
only  study  that  measured  the  pressure-generating  capacity  of

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

inspiratory and expiratory muscles did not show improvement in
these outcomes following exercise training (Messaggi-Sartor 2018).
The reasons for the lack of improvement in these outcomes may
relate  to  an  ineffective  training  programme  as  well  as  lack  of
statistical power to detect small changes.

We demonstrated in this review that exercise training may reduce
dyspnoea in people following lung resection for NSCLC. Dyspnoea
is  a  common  symptom  amongst  people  with  lung  cancer.  A
previous  study  in  142  people  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC
(median  time  from  surgery  =  10  years)  showed  that  90  (63%)
reported  chronic  dyspnoea,  and  45  (32%)  had  to  stop  due  to
breathlessness  when  walking  at  their  own  pace  (Sarna  2004).
Similarly,  a  cross-sectional  survey  of  342  people  following  lung
resection for NSCLC (assessed 1 to 6 years following the resection)
demonstrated  that  205  (60%)  reported  significant  dyspnoea  at
the time they responded to the survey (Feinstein 2010). The 2013
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) of the American
College  of  Chest  Physicians  (ACCP)  discuss  the  importance  of
managing  dyspnoea  in  people  with  lung  cancer  as  "it  creates
significant  worsening  to  a  patient’s  HRQoL"  (Simoff  2013).  This
CPG  was  based  on  a  previous  integrative  review  of  systematic
reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory
illnesses  (Bailey  2010).  It  concluded  that  it  is  important  to  focus
future  research  on  promising  non-pharmacological  interventions
to  manage  dyspnoea,  as  pharmacological  treatments  do  not
completely  alleviate  symptoms  and  have  the  added  burden  of
side  effects.  Our  review  suggests  that  exercise  training  may  be  a
promising non-pharmacological intervention to manage dyspnoea
in people following lung resection for NSCLC.

Our  meta-analysis  did  not  show  differences  in  fatigue  following
exercise  training.  Fatigue  is  a  common  symptom  in  people  with
early stage (i.e. stages I to IIIA) NSCLC (Huang 2015). However, the
mean time taken following lung resection for people with NSCLC
to  recover  from  symptoms  of  fatigue  is  62  days  (95%  CI  52  to  72
days)  (Fagundes  2015).  The  lack  of  between-group  difference  in
fatigue demonstrated in this review is therefore likely to be related,
at least in part, to a natural recovery in this outcome in both the
intervention and control groups.

The only study that measured feelings of anxiety and depression
did  not  show  improvement  in  these  outcomes  following  exercise
training  (Cavalheri  2017).  However,  the  participants  in  that  study
presented  with  low  scores  for  feelings  of  anxiety  and  depression
(i.e.  HADS  anxiety  and  depression  scores  ≤  7)  at  baseline.  This
result  is  in  agreement  with  a  study  of  pulmonary  rehabilitation
in  people  with  COPD  that  found  that  people  with  baseline  HADS
scores for feelings of anxiety and depression of ≤ 7 did not have a
significant change in symptoms following pulmonary rehabilitation
(Harrison 2012). As lung resection is the treatment that offers the
best chance of cure of NSCLC (Brunelli 2013), further investigation
is  needed  to  explore  the  extent  to  which  feelings  of  anxiety  and
depression are present in this population, and, if so, whether they
are best managed with a combination of exercise training and other
interventions provided by a multidisciplinary team.

We  did  not  demonstrate  changes  in  lung  function  following
exercise  training  in  this  review.  This  finding  was  expected  and
is  in  agreement  with  the  literature  on  the  effect  of  pulmonary
rehabilitation  on  lung  function  for  people  with  COPD  (McCarthy
2015).

Quality of the evidence

We  rated  the  quality  (certainty)  of  the  evidence  provided  by  the
studies  included  in  the  analysis  as  moderate,  ranging  between
very low (e.g. dyspnoea) and high (e.g. exercise capacity measure
as  the  6MWD).  We  assessed  all  included  studies  as  having  a
high  risk  of  performance  bias.  However,  blinding  of  participants
and  personnel  is  particularly  challenging  in  RCTs  investigating
the  effectiveness  of  exercise  training.  The  reasons  for  rating  the
evidence for the outcomes dyspnoea and HRQoL as very low and
low certainty, respectively, were mainly due to high risk of detection
bias  and  some  level  of  inconsistency  (for  HRQoL  and  dyspnoea)
and  imprecision  of  pooled  estimates  (dyspnoea).  We  rated  the
evidence for the outcome exercise capacity (VO2peak) as moderate
certainty  because  two  of  the  four  studies  included  in  the  meta-
analysis  had  a  high  risk  of  detection  bias  (i.e.  lack  of  blinding  of
the  outcome  assessors)  for  that  specific  outcome  measure.  We
judged the evidence for the outcome quadriceps muscle force as
of moderate certainty due to small sample size across the studies.
Finally,  we  rated  the  evidence  for  the  outcome  exercise  capacity
(6MWD) as of high certainty due to the very large size of the effect,
which showed marginal increase compared to the original version
of the review (Cavalheri 2013a). We believe that further research is
very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect for
6MWD.

Potential biases in the review process

Our  review  was  strengthened  by  a  number  of  methodological
processes used to ensure rigour and completeness. These included
an extensive electronic search, a search strategy with no language
limitation, the use of two review authors to independently examine
and  select  studies,  and  our  success  in  contacting  authors  of  the
included studies to provide additional data. In the previous version
of the review we attempted to contact authors of two other studies;
one  did  not  reply,  and  the  other  did  not  have  access  to  the
requested data. In this update, we attempted to contact the authors
of  another  study,  but  we  did  not  receive  a  reply  to  our  several
contact  attempts.  Exclusion  of  these  three  studies  is  a  potential
source of selection bias.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

The  first  published  systematic  review  on  the  effects  of  exercise
training  for  people  with  NSCLC  included  randomised  and  non-
randomised controlled trials (Granger 2011). However, of 16 studies
(two  RCTs)  included  in  this  earlier  review,  only  one  RCT  initiated
exercise  training  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC  (Arbane
2011),  whilst  all  the  others  explored  the  effect  of  preoperative
exercise training. Based on the results of 11 non-RCTs, the authors
concluded  that  in  people  with  NSCLC  exercise  training  in  this
population was safe and may confer positive benefits on exercise
capacity  and  some  domains  of  HRQoL.  Reviews  of  preoperative
exercise training in people with NSCLC have since been published
following  that  first  review  (Cavalheri  2017a;  Pouwels  2015;  Sebio
Garcia  2016).  Only  one  of  the  three  reviews  reported  results  of  a
meta-analysis  for  the  outcome  6MWD  (Cavalheri  2017a),  and,  in
agreement with the current review, demonstrated improved 6MWD
in the intervention group compared with the control group (MD 18
m,  95%  CI  9  to  28  m).  Similarly,  a  recently  published  review  that
investigated the effects of exercise training in people with advanced
lung cancer (i.e. stages IIIB to IVB) demonstrated improved 6MWD

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

in  the  intervention  group  compared  with  the  control  group  (MD
63  m,  95%  CI  4  to  123  m)  (Peddle-McIntyre  2019).  Regarding
reviews  on  exercise  training  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC,
the  original  version  of  our  Cochrane  Review,  Cavalheri  2013a,  as
well as two other reviews, Crandall 2014; Sommer 2018, have been
published.  The  review  by  Crandall  2014  included  both  RCTs  and
non-RCTs  that  investigated  the  effectiveness  of  exercise  training
for  people  with  NSCLC  before  as  well  as  after  lung  resection.
However,  the  authors  did  not  perform  meta-analysis.  The  review
by  Sommer  2018  included  only  four  RCTs  (Arbane  2011;  Brocki
2014; Edvardsen 2015; Salhi 2015). In agreement with our review,
Sommer 2018 reported higher exercise capacity in the intervention
group compared with the control group (SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.04 to
0.93). However, in contrast to our review, which analysed VO2peak
and  6MWD  separately,  Sommer  2018  pooled  results  of  VO2peak
and  6MWD  together  in  the  meta-analysis.  Consistent  with  our
findings,  Sommer  2018  reported  better  scores  for  the  physical
component of HRQoL in the intervention group compared with the
control group (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82). However, instead of
analysing  general  HRQoL  and  disease-specific  HRQoL  separately,
Sommer 2018 pooled results of the SF-36 physical component score
and  EORTC  QLQ-C30  physical  functioning  score  together  in  the
meta-analysis.  Of  note,  our  review  is  the  first  to  report  findings
of  meta-analysis  for  outcomes  such  as  force-generating  capacity
of peripheral muscles, pressure-generating capacity of respiratory
muscles, dyspnoea, and fatigue.

Implications for practice

Our meta-analyses provided moderate- to high-certainty evidence
that  exercise  training,  which  included  aerobic  and  resistance
exercises, improved exercise capacity and quadriceps muscle force
of  people  following  lung  resection  for  non-small  cell  lung  cancer
(NSCLC).  The  improvement  in  exercise  capacity  was  clinically
important. Lower-certainty evidence from our meta-analyses also
suggested that exercise training improved the physical component
score  of  general  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  and
decreased dyspnoea in people following lung resection for NSCLC.
The  improvement  in  the  physical  component  score  of  general
HRQoL  was  clinically  important.  A  survey  that  described  the
management  of  people  with  lung  cancer  across  Australia  and
New  Zealand  reported  that  only  a  small  proportion  of  people
were  referred  to  exercise  training  programmes  following  lung
resection  (Cavalheri  2013).  Our  review  suggests  that  referrals  to
exercise  programmes  could  be  considered  for  people  following
lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  Exercise  training  has  the  potential  to
interrupt  the  ‘deconditioning  storm’  induced  by  the  disease  and
its  treatment  (Jones  2008).  Importantly,  balance  training,  when
needed,  should  be  performed  under  close  supervision  and  in
proximity to a railing or other secure support (Beck 2017).

Implications for research

In  the  original  review  we  provided  important  considerations  for
minimising  bias  and  methodological  heterogeneity  in  upcoming
studies.  We  were  pleased  to  see  that  these  considerations  were
addressed  in  the  five  studies  added  to  this  review  (Arbane
2014; Cavalheri 2017; Edvardsen 2015; Messaggi-Sartor 2018; Salhi
2015).  Specifically,  these  studies:  (i)  collected  outcome  measures
immediately  before  and  after  the  exercise  training  intervention
rather  than  before  lung  resection  and  on  completion  of  the

exercise  training  intervention;  (ii)  chose  disease-specific  HRQoL
questionnaires; and (iii) reported the values for each domain that
contributed  to  HRQoL  as  well  as  the  total  score  obtained  from
HRQoL  questionnaires.  Reporting  of  data  could  be  optimised  by
reporting  the  mean  change  in  outcomes  collected  immediately
before and after the exercise training intervention.

The  current  systematic  review  strengthens  the  message  that
exercise  training  improves  exercise  capacity  in  people  following
lung  resection  for  NSCLC.  It  also  highlights  the  need  for  larger
randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  to  confirm  or  investigate  the
effects  of  exercise  training  following  lung  resection  for  NSCLC  on
outcomes other than exercise capacity, including different aspects
of quality of life and symptoms. The effect of combining exercise
training  with  other  interventions  provided  by  a  multidisciplinary
team  (e.g.  dietitians,  occupational  therapists,  psychologists,  and
others)  needs  to  be  considered.  Although  blinding  of  study
participants  and  personnel  in  RCTs  of  exercise  training  is  very
difficult,  even  with  ‘sham’  training,  future  studies  should  strive
to  blind  outcome  assessors.  Upcoming  studies  should  consider
intention-to-treat analysis, as well as attempts to minimise losses

to  follow-up.  The  addition  of  longer-term  follow-up  measures  is
also  important  for  future  trials.  Furthermore,  a  comparison  of
the  effects  of  exercise  training  in  people  who  underwent  video-
assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  (VATS)  and  those  who  underwent
thoracotomy could be included as an exploratory aim in future RCTs
to evaluate their influence on maximal inspiratory and expiratory
pressures as well as other outcomes.

Notes

Randomised controlled trial

Setting: St George’s Hospital, London, UK

Study duration: 5 days (inpatient) + 12 weeks of home-based intervention. Assessments were per-
formed preoperatively, 5 days postoperatively, and after the 12 weeks of intervention following dis-
charge.

67 participants with NSCLC, referred for lung resection via open thoracotomy or VATS, were screened.
53 agreed to participate in the study and were randomised before any formal testing. 2 were exclud-
ed. 51 participants (median (range) age 63 (32 to 87) years – control group; 65 (47 to 82) years – exercise
group) completed the study.

Control (n = 25): Pain medication as relevant via patient-controlled analgesia on day 1 postoperative-
ly, thereafter orally as needed. Usual care comprising routine inpatient physiotherapy treatment (air-
way clearance techniques, mobilisation as able, and upper limb activities) once daily from day 1 post-
surgery to discharge and monthly phone calls after discharge.

Exercise (n =26): Same as control group plus twice-daily additional strength and mobility training from
day 1 to day 5 postsurgery as well as 12 weeks of home-based non-supervised exercise programme
(walking + home-adapted strengthening exercises) including 3 home visits.

Exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance), health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 version 2.0),
maximal quadriceps force (femoral nerve stimulation), and postoperative complications

Control group: stage I (10 participants), stage II (6 participants), stage IV (5 participants), and 4 partici-
pants described as “other”.

Active group: stage I (15 participants), stage II (6 participants), stage III (2 participants), and data were
unavailable for 3 participants.

Missing data provided on number of males/females in each group.

Setting: teaching hospital, London, UK

Study duration: 5 days (inpatient) + 4 weeks of home-based intervention. Assessments were performed
preoperatively, 5 days postoperatively (or sooner if discharge was earlier), and 4 weeks postoperative-
ly.

Participants

131 participants with NSCLC were randomised before lung resection (via open thoracotomy or VATS).
Following randomisation, 29 participants (22%) were withdrawn according to predefined criteria, and
24 participants (18%) were unavailable for assessment 4 weeks after lung resection. The mean (SD) age
was 68 (11) years for the control group and 67 (11) years for the exercise group.

Interventions

Control (n = 67): standard medical care including routine physiotherapy treatments, airway clearance
techniques where indicated, mobilisation, and upper limb activities.

Exercise (n = 64): structured, physiotherapy-led cycle ergometry strength-training programme once a
day during inpatient stay. This training included a warm-up phase during 0 to 2 minutes consisting of
unloaded pedaling at 50 to 60 rpm. Intensity of cycling was increased steadily during the third minute
to achieve max 60% to 90% heart rate reserve. Participants were advised to exercise at an intensity of
3 to 4 in the Borg dyspnoea scale or 13 to 15 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). The aim
was to complete > 5 minutes on postoperative day 1, increasing to maximal duration of 30 minutes on
day 5. Furthermore, the exercise group undertook a 4-week home walking programme (with bi-weekly
phone calls). The aim was to achieve 30 minutes of walking per day.

Exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), health-related quality of life (SF-36 and EORTC QLQ-
LC13), and quadriceps force (maximum voluntary contraction)

Subgroup analysis was undertaken with data from the 63 participants that had airflow obstruction (de-
fined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7).

Methods

Participants

Interventions

Randomised controlled trial

Setting: Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark

Study duration: 4 months. Intervention started 3 weeks following lung resection. Assessments were
performed 3 weeks following lung resection and after 4 and 12 months.

294 people with NSCLC were screened for eligibility and 171 were approached; 92 declined to partici-
pate and 1 person failed to perform the 6MWT. 78 people (mean (SD) age 65 (9) years – control group; 64
(10) years – exercise group) agreed to participate in the study and were randomised.

Control (n = 37): 1 individual instruction session on home exercises (strength training at least twice a
week and a daily 30-minute walk or a bicycle ride with an intensity of 11 to 12 on the Borg scale) and
usual postoperative nurse counselling consisting of up to 3 individual 1-hour sessions performed in the
period of 3 weeks to 4 months after surgery.

Exercise (n = 41): 1 individual instruction session on home exercises (as described above), usual post-
operative nurse counselling (described above), and supervised outpatient exercise training sessions,
1 hour once a week for 10 weeks. The sessions were based on aerobic exercises with target intensity of
60% to 80% of work capacity, resistance training, and dyspnoea management.

Outcomes

Exercise capacity (6MWD), health-related quality of life SF-36, and lung function (spirometry)

Notes

4 of the 41 participants in the exercise group (10%) and 6 of the 37 participants in the control group
(16%) had secondary lung cancer.

Author was contacted and kindly provided specific data (gender, age, type of surgical procedure, SF-36,
6MWD, FEV1 and FVC) for the participants that had primary NSCLC.

Unclear risk

Comment:

There are differential losses to follow-up between groups, and differences
between completers/no completers that could be related to the outcomes,
therefore we could not make an assessment of low risk of attrition bias. Since
the main analysis results at 4 months were mostly of no effect (except for the
bodily pain domain), and the more conservative sensitivity analysis (the best
case for control) reached similar conclusions, it seems that the overall analy-
sis is robust and there is no suggestion of relevant bias derived from attrition
of participants. For this reason, we also could not make as assessment of high
risk of attrition bias.

Control (n = 8): instructed to continue to perform their usual activities during the period of the study.
Participants received weekly phone calls from a research assistant that consisted of general conversa-
tion as well as standardised questions about their health and well-being.

Exercise (n = 9): participants in the exercise group underwent an 8-week exercise training programme
aimed at improving aerobic capacity and muscle strength. The programme comprised individual, su-
pervised training 3 times per week delivered by senior physical therapists. Each session was 60 minutes
in duration. In the event that a participant could only attend 2 supervised sessions per week, they were
provided with a cycle ergometer to use at home for 1 training session per week. Each class comprised
aerobic (walking/cycling) and resistance training (upper/lower limbs). For corridor walking, the initial
average speed was set at 80% of the average 6MWT speed. Cycling consisted of 10 min of endurance
training (initial work rate was set at 60% of the Wmax) and 2 periods of 2 min of power training (initial
work rate was set at 80% of the Wmax).

Exercise capacity (6MWD and VO2peak), health-related quality of life (SF-36, FACT-L, and EORTC QLQ-

Edvardsen 2015 

Methods

Randomised controlled trial

Setting: Oslo University Hospital in Norway

Study duration: 20 weeks, starting 5 to 7 weeks after surgery. Assessments were performed by exercise
physiologists before surgery, 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, and immediately after the 20-week interven-
tion.

Participants

A total of 106 patients were screened for participation, and 69 patients were enrolled before lung resec-
tion. Following lung resection, 8 participants were not randomised because of postoperative mortality
(n = 3) or unexpected events. 61 patients (mean (SD) age 66 (9) years – control group; 64 (9) years – exer-
cise group) agreed to participate in the study and were randomised.

Interventions

Control (n = 31): the control group received standard postoperative care.

Exercise (n = 30): the exercise programme was individualised and included a cardiovascular warm-up,
interval training, progressive resistance training (PRT), and daily inspiratory muscle training. The inter-
vention focused on high-intensity training, mainly by walking uphill on a treadmill at 80% to 95% of the
maximum heart rate and by PRT in 3 series of 6- to 12-repetition maximum of the leg press, leg exten-
sion, back extension, seat row, bicep curls, and chest-and-shoulder press. Each session lasted 60 min,
and exercise was performed 3 times per week for 20 weeks.

Exercise capacity (VO2peak), health-related quality of life (SF-36 and EORTC QLQ-C30), and peripheral
muscle force (isometric handgrip force by using a dynamometer, isometric quadriceps force by 1-repe-
tition maximum) and lung function (spirometry)

70 patients with NSCLC were screened to participate. 37 patients (mean (SD) age 65 (9) years – control
group; 64 (8) years – exercise group) agreed to participate in the study and were randomised.

Control (n = 21): usual postoperative care (standard medical treatment and periodic monitoring). Par-
ticipants were advised to perform physical activity such as leisure time physical activity (walking, danc-
ing, hiking, or swimming), transportation (walking or cycling), occupational (if still in the workforce),
household chores, play, games and sports, or planned exercise.

Exercise (n = 16): continuous aerobic training and high-intensity respiratory muscle training (24 super-
vised sessions, 3 per week, 8 weeks). Continuous aerobic training was performed on an ergometric bi-
cycle, initial intensity was 60% of baseline peak workload and increased by 5 watts weekly if the partic-
ipant was able to tolerate the set load for 30 min. High-intensity respiratory muscle training consisted
of 5 sets of 10 repetitions followed by 1 to 2 min of unloaded recovery breathing, twice a day, 3 days per
week, for 8 weeks.

Randomised controlled trial

Setting: University hospital in Belgium

Study duration: 12-week intervention. Participants were evaluated before, after radical treatment, and
after completing the 12-week intervention.

121 consecutive patients with respiratory cancer were recruited. 86 patients completed the assess-
ments before radical treatment. 16 additional patients dropped out following radical treatment. 70
radically treated patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (n = 24), conventional resis-
tance training (CRT) (n = 24), or whole-body vibration training group (n = 22). Only data pertaining to
the control group (median (range) age 64 (51 to 79) years) and CRT group (63 (29 to 76) years) were used
in the current review.

Interventions

Control (n = 24): participants were discouraged from undertaking supervised exercise training.

Exercise (CRT) (n = 24): 3 times per week for 12 weeks. 20 min of aerobic training on the bicycle and
treadmill at 70% of the respective maximal workload (Wmax) and speed; resistance training on mul-
ti-gym equipment starting with 3 sets of 8 repetitions for each exercise at 50% 1-repetition-maximum.

Outcomes

Study duration: 12 weeks of intervention and 1-year follow-up. Assessments were performed before
surgery and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

81 patients with NSCLC who were eligible for thoracotomy were invited. 60 patients accepted, but 57
were randomised before surgery. 49 participants completed (exercise group: n = 23 (21 males), mean
age 63.6 ± 10.2 years and control group: n = 26 (19 males), mean age 63.2 ± 10.3 years)

Interventions

Control (n = 26): usual care consisting of routine outpatient appointments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months fol-
lowing surgery. Pain medication prescribed by their pulmonologist or general practitioner.

Exercise (n = 23): 4 weeks after discharge, twice a week, participants exercised at 60% to 80% of their
peak cycling load and performed muscle training for 12 weeks. An anaesthesiologist adjusted pain
treatment according to the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder.

Lack of reporting on adverse events, 4 April 2019

Summary

The Cochrane Lung Cancer consumer (André Stoop) as well as the Statistitian (Marta Roque) the lack of reporting on adverse effects or
harms related to the intervention.

Reply

We added "safety of the intervention" as a primary outcome as suggested in the document "Standards for planning, conduct and reporting
of UPDATES of Cochrane Intervention reviews (U1-11, UR1-7)".

We presented the results of the primary outcome 'exercise capacity' in a separate meta-analysis: one that included peak rate of oxygen
uptake (VO2peak) and a second one that included six-minute walk distance (6MWD). We added 'safety of the intervention' as a primary
outcome as suggested in the document 'Standards for planning, conduct and reporting of UPDATES of Cochrane Intervention reviews
(U1-11, UR1-7)' (Chandler 2016). We did not calculate risk difference, as no meta-analysis of dichotomous data was performed. We excluded
the  outcome  'development  of  a  post-operative  pulmonary  complication'  from  the  2019  update,  as  we  understand  that  postoperative
exercise training in this population commences days or weeks after hospital discharge and hence cannot have an effect on the development
of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications.  We  added  the  visual  analogue  scale  as  a  measure  of  dyspnoea.  We  divided  the  outcome
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) into 'general HRQoL' and 'disease-specific HRQoL'. Due to changes such as separate meta-analysis
for VO2peak and 6MWD; the inclusion of 'safety of the intervention' as a primary outcome; the division of HRQoL into general HRQoL
and disease-specific HRQoL; and the new findings of significant between-group difference in force-generating capacity of the peripheral
muscles (quadriceps) and dyspnoea, new outcomes have been included in the 'Summary of findings' table. These include: (i) exercise
capacity (both as VO2peak and 6MWD); (ii) safety of the intervention; (iii) general HRQoL; (iv) force-generating capacity of the peripheral
muscles (quadriceps); and (v) dyspnoea.
