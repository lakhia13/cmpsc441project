Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with multifac-
torial etiology, characterized by impairment in two main functional areas: (1) communication and
social interactions, and (2) skills, interests and activities. ASD patients often suffer from gastrointesti-
nal symptoms associated with dysbiotic states and a “leaky gut.” A key role in the pathogenesis of
ASD has been attributed to the gut microbiota, as it inﬂuences central nervous system development
and neuropsychological and gastrointestinal homeostasis through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. A
state of dysbiosis with a reduction in the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and Bacteroidetes level and other
imbalances is common in ASD. In recent decades, many authors have tried to study and identify
the microbial signature of ASD through in vivo and ex vivo studies. In this regard, the advent
of metabolomics has also been of great help. Based on these data, several therapeutic strategies,
primarily the use of probiotics, are investigated to improve the symptoms of ASD through the mod-
ulation of the microbiota. However, although the results are promising, the heterogeneity of the
studies precludes concrete evidence. The aim of this review is to explore the role of intestinal barrier
dysfunction, the gut–brain axis and microbiota alterations in ASD and the possible role of probiotic
supplementation in these patients.

1. Introduction
1.1. Autism Spectrum Disorder

ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with multifactorial etiology, charac-
terized by the impairment of two main functional areas: (1) continuous communication
and social interaction deﬁcits, and (2) restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests. The
incidence among sexes is a male/female rate of 3:1 [1,2].

ASD diagnostic criteria are available in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders-5 [3], describing persistent deﬁcits in social communication and social interac-
tion across multiple contexts, such as deﬁcits in social–emotional reciprocity; nonverbal
communicative behaviors; and developing, maintaining and understanding relationships.
Moreover, ASD children present behavior restricted and repetitive patterns of interests or
activities, as manifested by at least two of the following: (a) repetitive or stereotyped motor
movements, use of objects or speech; (b) insistence on sameness, inﬂexible adherence to
routines or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior; (c) ﬁxated and restricted
interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus; and (d) hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory

input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment. Such symptoms must
be present in the early period of development, be generally evident at the age of 3 and
cause signiﬁcant clinical impairment of global functioning. In 2014 in the United States, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated 1 case out of 68 children of the age of 8 [4], and
in 2018, the CDC reported an ASD prevalence rate of 1 in 44 or an incidence rate of 2.3% [5].
Considering the great geographical variability and the methodologic differences em-
ployed in prevalence studies, the actual prevalence of ASD is estimated to be higher than
2.5% in the United States and 1.5% in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. In Italy, the preva-
lence of children diagnosed with ASD is estimated to be 1 out of 77 among children between
9 and 17 years old, with a higher risk for the male sex; the number of male patients is four
times higher than the number of female patients.

1.2. ASD Etiopathogenesis

The disease is now deﬁned as a complex disorder with multifactorial etiopathology
because it seems to be determined by the contribution of many risk factors, such as genetics,
epigenetics and environmental factors.

Much evidence supports genetic factors as the predominant cause of ASD. Emphasis
on the genetic component from epidemiological data derives from familiarity and the
high incidence of the autistic behavioral phenotype in the context of genetic diseases with
well-known etiology. The amount of ASD cases with a genetic base represents 10–20% of
the overall number of autistic patients. Concordance studies on twins have shown very
suggestive data; the concordance among monozygotic twins has been shown to be variable
from 70% to 90%, whereas that between dizygotic twins is between 0–10% [6]. Moreover,
ASD incidence is estimated to be 2% among siblings, with a 100 times higher risk than
the normal population (0.02%). Furthermore, the recurrence risk is signiﬁcantly higher in
families with a ﬁrst diagnosis of ASD than it is in the normal population. In particular,
families with a ﬁrst child diagnosed with ASD have greater probabilities of having an
autistic second child depending on the child’s sex, as follows: 15–25% if the child is male,
and 5–15% if the child is female. Last, the presence of many ﬁrst-grade relatives diagnosed
with ASD testiﬁes to the importance of the genetic hypothesis [7,8]. There are ASD forms
that are similar to genetic syndromes, and these forms represent 10% of all ASD diagnoses.
Beyond the ﬁndings of speciﬁc alterations that cause speciﬁc syndromes, genetic anomalies
implied in ASD can be caused by mutations in one gene or in the total number of copy
variations (CNVs). Besides speciﬁc genetic alterations that cause well-known clinical
pictures, there are uncommon genetic variants (with a documented presence of less than
1% of the general population). These mutation sites are in correspondence with genes of
great importance in the process of neurodevelopment, and the most documented are CNVs,
such as microdeletion or microduplication; nonsense mutation with the insertion of a stop
codon; and missense mutation with the creation of aberrant products, such as inactive
proteins or proteins with reduced biological activity [9].

Some relevant examples include genes that code for synaptic transmembrane proteins,
such us neuroligine 3 and 4 and neurexine 1 and 3, which are crucial for synaptic function;
others are SHANK family genes (SHANK 1, 2, 3) that codify for proteins involved in
synapsis formation and dendritic spine maturation. In detail, SHANK 3 is involved in
dendritic development and in a pathway with reelin, a protein that is essential for the
stabilization and the laminar organization of the cerebral cortex [10]. Even if the scientiﬁc
community well accepts the role of genetic anomalies, many studies have shown similar
associations with environmental risk factors.

A plethora of environmental risk factors have been taken into consideration, and most
of them refer to the pre/peri-natal period because the maximum development of the central
nervous system (CNS) is in this period. Risk factors that inﬂuence neurodevelopment and
provoke long-term alterations in the brain’s physiology include pre-natal exposition to
viral infections (e.g., Cytomegalovirus and Rubivirus); environmental toxic substances,
such as pesticides, phthalates, solvents, environmental pollutants, and heavy metals; stress;

alcohol intake; and diet [11]. An association between maternal conditions and ASD risk
has been demonstrated.

1.3. Physiological Aspects of ASD

The most common predisposing factors of ASD are neurodevelopment anomalies
during the ﬁrst and the second trimester of pre-natal life [12]. Other causes are less frequent
but not completely negligible. Among these, cerebellar damage has been identiﬁed in the
peri-natal period, which increases the risk of developing autism by 30 times. Neuropathol-
ogy post-mortem studies on histological samples of CNS taken from autistic patients have
shown the presence of cytoarchitectonic anomalies, which can involve various brain regions.
Among these, reduced apoptosis and/or enhanced cellular proliferation (particularly evi-
dent in macrocephalic patients), neuronal migration alteration or anomalies in the process
of cellular maturation and differentiation have been described [13]. From a functional point
of view, neuropathological anomalies bring the formation of an atypical neural network
characterized by reduced long-distance connectivity and exceeding local connectivity [14].

1.4. Gastrointestinal Involvement in ASD

A bidirectional interaction between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gut microenviron-
ment and CNS, called the ‘microbiota–gut–brain axis’, regulates intestinal and neurological
homeostasis. An impairment of this complex system can promote, in the presence of other
contributing factors, the pathogenesis of nervous-system-related diseases, such as ASD.

Enteric symptoms (including constipation, diarrhea, recurrent abdominal pain/bloating
and gastroesophageal reﬂux) are frequent among ASD patients, who often present alter-
ations in intestinal motility and dysfunction of the epithelial barrier.

The aim of this review is to explore the current scientific evidence on the role of intestinal
barrier dysfunction, the gut–brain axis and microbiota alteration in ASD and the possibility
of modulating gut microbiota (GM) in these patients using probiotic supplementation.

2. Intestinal Permeability in ASD

Children with ASD frequently exhibit GI tract problem symptoms. These illnesses’
underlying causes, though, are still poorly understood. It is speculated that the patho-
physiology of ASD may be inﬂuenced by the GM and its metabolites [15–17]. Numerous
articles have identiﬁed the impact of GI alteration, GM and CNS function, as well as the
potential participation of the microbiome–gut–brain axis [18]. Given that the prevalence of
GI symptoms in ASD children may reach 70%, microbiome and gut–brain connections are
likely to play a signiﬁcant role in ASD [19].

Additionally, the severity of ASD is correlated with the prevalence of GI symptoms [20],
demonstrating the role of the gut in the pathogenesis of ASD [21,22]. ‘Leaky Gut syndrome’
refers to a situation in which the small or large intestine’s epithelial barrier function is
compromised, resulting in increased types and quantities of molecules and cells that can
ﬂow from the gut to the circulatory system and vice versa [23].

The intestinal microbiota, mucous layer, intestinal epithelium, elements of innate
and acquired immunity, hormonal and neuroenteric systems, vascular–lymphatic system
and digestive enzymes comprise the functional unit of intestinal permeability. It serves
as the body’s ﬁrst line of protection against toxic, immunogenic and pro-inﬂammatory
substances by maintaining a delicate balance between the intestinal lumen’s antigenic
charge and the intricate structure of the intestinal mucosa. It is crucial for preserving good
health, stopping systemic and intestinal inﬂammation and suppressing the immune system.
Only trace amounts of antigens can pass through the normal intestinal barrier to engage
with the innate and adaptive immune systems. A change in its function may promote
bacterial and antigen transit, which may then result in pathogenic diseases [24]. The core
of intestinal permeability is the occlusive, tough intracellular connections. These tight
junctions comprise a system of numerous proteins in the paracellular space between each
cell in the gut lining. They are indeed responsible for the epithelial barrier’s functionality.

This insurmountable but selective barrier is reinforced by a thick mucus coating and
interacts steadily with luminal contents and enteric bacteria.

It is well known that the gut and the brain have a strong relationship and regularly
interact. Neuropeptides that allow two-way communication between the gut and the
brain include substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuropeptide Y and vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide [25]. Cortisol, a key player in developing anxiety and depressive dis-
orders, is also released by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and controls intestinal
motility, integrity and hypersecretion [26]. The GM can sequentially affect the function of
the CNS through neuronal, endocrine, immunological and metabolic processes because
communication is bidirectional [27].

The relationship between the gut and the brain in the etiology of autism is assumed
to be increased gut permeability, which has been linked to ASD. For instance, it was
demonstrated that the injection of propionic acid (that is produced by intestinal bacteria) in
rats’ brains [28] results in neuroinﬂammation and symptoms resembling those of ASD [29].
This might explain why children with ASD experience worsened symptoms when exposed
to food preservatives containing propionic acid. In this particular case, increased gut
permeability would allow propionic acid to enter the bloodstream and eventually leak into
the blood–brain barrier.

Intestinal permeability prevents intestinal contents from entering the bloodstream
and suppressing subsequent immunological inﬂammatory responses and GI illnesses [30].
As a result, an intact gut barrier decreases inﬂammatory responses. De Magistris et al.
showed that 36.7% of ASD children have aberrant intestinal permeability compared to
less than 5% of control children [31]. Similar data were reported by D’Eufemia et al., who
reported that 43% of ASD children with GI symptoms have impaired intestinal perme-
ability [32]. Recently, to investigate the association between intestinal permeability and
behavior, Teskey et al. measured the intestinal fatty acid binding protein as a marker of
intestinal epithelial damage in the plasma of children with ASD and found that an increase
in this protein correlates with a severe deﬁcit in communication, social interaction and
maladaptive behavior [15].

A broader understanding of the role of the intestinal barrier in autism can greatly help

predict the best treatment option for a given patient.

3. Microbiota–Gut–Brain Axis Involvement in ASD

Two millennia ago, Hippocrates stated that “All disease begins in the gut” [33]. A
growing interest in systems and organs closely related to the CNS has been triggered by the
high prevalence of some speciﬁc medical comorbidities, such as GI disorders, in individuals
with ASD compared to peers with typical development.

Over the past decade, the bidirectional communication between the gut and the
brain, the so-called “gut–brain axis,” has been the focus of preclinical and clinical research,
investigating its possible role in the etiopathogenesis of some neuropsychiatric condi-
tions, including ASD [34]. This interplay of bidirectional communication connecting mind
and body provides a physiological rationale for interpreting these conditions within the
biopsychosocial model. The biopsychosocial model examines the reciprocal and complex
interactions among biological, psychological and environmental factors contributing to
disease [35], mainly due to the growing knowledge of this axis [36].

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a well-deﬁned entity capable of regulating the
intestinal functions of mobility, secretion and mucosal transport entirely autonomously
from the CNS [27]. As demonstrated in the animal model, the ENS, even when the gut
is entirely denervated by the CNS, it can function on its own. However, it maintains a
bidirectional communication pathway with the CNS [27].

The CNS, after integrating a variety of information regarding internal and external
environmental changes, performs parasympathetic control through the vagus nerve with
cholinergic efferents acting on the myenteric plexus (motor movements) and Meissner’s
plexus (secretions of the submucosal glands), and with sympathetic control through the

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

splanchnic nerves that reduce the motility of the intestine and blood supply to the splanch-
nic circulation [27]. The pronounced synergy and continuous exchange of information
along this axis is possible because of the vast neurochemical assets available to the en-
teric nervous system. In in vivo studies, the peripheral stimulation of vagal ﬁbers has
been shown to lead to dopamine release in the reward system [37]. This type of neuronal
network, which connects the GI tract with different levels of the CNS involving the afore-
mentioned neural pathways, humoral signaling molecules and hormones [22,38], is the
functional basis of the gut–brain axis [39].

Notably, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is also involved in this network. It
is responsible for coordinating the body’s adaptive responses following stressful events,
modulating the composition of the GM and the integrity of the intestinal barrier through
the secretion of norepinephrine and dopamine at the neuroendocrine level. The resulting
dysbiosis state and altered permeability can induce the translocation of bacterial com-
ponents, which promotes the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone,
prostaglandins and proinﬂammatory cytokines [26].

Increasing evidence has demonstrated the existence of a complex and still not well-
understood two-way connection among the GM, intestine and CNS. In recent years, as
microbiological and neuroscientiﬁc knowledge has advanced and the role played by the
GM in host physiology has become more evident, there has been a shift in the conception
of the gut–brain axis, and the term has been renamed the “microbiota–gut–brain axis” [40].
Indeed, communication between gut microbes and the gut–brain axis occurs through
multiple pathways and mechanisms, including immune, neural, metabolic and endocrine
pathways that arbitrate bidirectional signaling locally in the gut and peripherally [22,41].
Interest in the microbiota–gut–brain axis was ignited when Lozupone et al. demon-
strated an increased hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis response to stress in germ-free
mice compared with non-germ-free mice [42]. Bravo et al. showed that supplementation
with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus can modify GABA receptor expression in cortical regions,
the hippocampus and the amygdala, with subsequent reduction in anxiety- and depression-
related behaviors and stress-induced corticosterone levels, suggesting the involvement
of the neuroendocrine axis.
Interestingly, these effects were reversed after vagotomy,
suggesting a crucial role of the peripheral nervous system in the gut–brain connection [43].
Interactions with gut microbes occur in the intestinal barrier, which is an essential
and highly dynamic interface between the host and the outside world consisting of several
structures, including secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A molecules, antimicrobial peptides,
lysozyme and secretory phospholipase A2, intestinal epithelial cells and adaptive immune
cells (macrophages, T cells, B cells and dendritic cells) [22].

Understanding the mechanisms that cause dysfunction in gut–brain communica-
tion has made essential contributions to understanding the basic pathophysiology of the
microbiota–gut–brain axis in patients with ASD and has encouraged the proposal of new
therapeutic perspectives [44].

Indeed, microorganisms harbored in the GI tract can modulate the activation of
cells of the immune system and intestinal epithelium, transducing inﬂammatory or anti-
inﬂammatory signals to the enteric nervous system and, consequently, to the CNS [45].
Several authors have hypothesized that alterations in the GM may contribute to the ex-
pression of the autistic phenotype or exacerbate the severity of symptoms in individuals
genetically predisposed to ASD [46–48]. In fact, the microbiota covers many functions; it
supports nutrient digestion, regulates metabolism, processes hazardous substances, partici-
pates in detoxiﬁcation and organizes control of the immune system. Microbiota composition
is inﬂuenced by many factors, including genes, the maternal microbiome, nutrition, brain
activity and mood. This means that something that starts as an emotion in the brain affects
the gut and the signals generated by the microbiota. These signals are, in turn, transmitted
to the brain, often making that emotional state more intense and prolonged [49].

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

It has been hypothesized that ASD can result from any disruption that can alter the
balance of the microbiota and the gut and that the disruption of a single part of this delicate
mechanism can potentially impact any link in the chain [50].

Recent studies have shown that some bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacter-
oidetes [Barnesiella, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Prevotella, Proteobacteria
(e.g., Proteus and Parasutterella) and Alistipes] are more abundant in ASD patients as
compared to the general population, whereas Actinobacteria, (Biﬁdobacterium species) are
often less abundant in ASD patients [51,52].

A detailed discussion of microbiota in ASD subjects can be found in Sections 4 and 5.
Alterations in gut microbial composition can lead to altered levels of neuroactive
molecules, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic acid, acetic acid
and butyric acid, and lipopolysaccharides that can induce changes in the CNS through
the endocrine pathway [53], and they have all been found to be overexpressed in ASD
populations [54], although the results remain mostly contradictory [55–58].

Studies in animal models have shown an overgrowth of Firmicutes species (spp.), a
reduction in Bacteroidetes spp. and increased butyric acid levels in male mice with autistic-
like behaviors [59,60].

Several studies have demonstrated that SCFAs can permeate the blood–brain bar-
rier [61] and modulate the neural characteristics of brain cells [62–64]. In fact, the adminis-
tration of propionic acid in mouse models, pre-natally through a pregnant mother [65,66] and
in the early years of life [65–68], as well as increasing dietary propionic acid in children [69],
have facilitated the onset of autism-like behaviors in all animal and human studies.

SCFAs of bacterial species act on speciﬁc GI and immune pathways, and this may im-
pair gut metabolic function and increase immune response and mitochondrial dysfunction,
resulting in increased oxidative stress. Sustained oxidative stress may, in turn, enhance
intestinal permeability and increase inﬂammation.

Microglial activation in the brain can further increase inflammation, resulting in the mal-
function of synapses and manifestation of behavioral abnormalities and neuropathology [70–74].
Like mammalians, also in Drosophila, an alteration in the GM can cause an epithelial oxida-
tive burst, causing changes in gut permeability and affecting longevity and behaviors [75–77].
The GM can release metabolites that can modulate levels of psychoactive compounds
in the CNS or produce these neuroactive substances on their own [22,78]. Among the
different neurotransmitters involved in ASD that appear to be regulated by the microbiome
are serotonin, glutamate and dopamine [79,80].

For example, Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. are producers of γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) [79,81,82]; Candida spp., Escherichia spp., Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus
spp. are producers of serotonin [81]; Escherichia spp. and Saccharomyces spp. generate nore-
pinephrine; Lactobacillus spp. is a producer of acetylcholine; and Bacillus spp. and Serratia
spp. are producers of dopamine [83]. In addition, elevated levels of norepinephrine have
been detected with increased amounts of Bacillus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Saccharomyces or
Streptococcus spp. in the intestine [79,81].

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a fundamental role in mood regulation
through its inﬂuence on microglial cells in the CNS [84]. Enterochromafﬁn cells distributed
along the intestinal mucosa produce 95% of it [85]. In the study by Yano et al., it was shown
that indigenous spore-forming bacteria in mouse and human microbiota promote serotonin
biosynthesis from enterochromafﬁn cells and have a signiﬁcant impact on host physiology
by modulating GI motility and platelet function, suggesting direct metabolic signaling
from gut microbes to enterochromafﬁn cells [84]. The GM possesses enzymes that regulate
tryptophan metabolism pathways, leading to the production of serotonin, kynurenine or
indole derivatives. Therefore, by controlling the amount of tryptophan, the microbiota can
inﬂuence the brain’s amount of serotonin [86].

Hyper- and hypo-glutamine patterns at different developmental stages underlie the
neurotransmitter communication hypothesis in the pathogenesis of ASD. Various studies
on the antagonists of NMDARs or AMPARs have shown clinical beneﬁts in ASD [87].

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

Similarly, the excitatory glutamate pathway is likely one of the factors involved in the
etiopathogenesis of ASD. It is part of gut–brain communication, as it mediates trans-
synaptic signaling. It is also implicated in cell adhesion, linking pre- and postsynaptic
neurons, and it shapes neural networks by specifying synaptic functions [88]. In addition,
a correlation between ASD phenotypes and glutamate/glutamine levels in various brain
areas has been displayed through the use of in vivo neuroimaging of ASD individuals [87].
Furthermore, altered dopamine signaling has been associated with ASD in both mice
and humans. A study by DiCarlo et al. suggested that mice that are homozygous for
the T356M DNA variant of the SLC6A3 gene, which encodes the dopamine transporter,
manifests altered dopamine signaling and metabolic dysfunction, weigh less and have
reduced body fat [89]. The authors found a signiﬁcant decrease in Fusobacterium abundance
at the oral level. Moreover, there is a positive association among Fusobacterium abundance,
better glucose management and decreased body fat [89].

However, neurotransmitters produced in the gut are unlikely to reach the brain
because of the presence of the blood–brain barrier. A likely exception is GABA because its
transporters are present in the blood–brain barrier. However, the CNS can be indirectly
affected by neurotransmitters produced in the gut because they can act on the enteric
nervous system [90,91].

In fact, the blood–brain barrier is another crucial anatomo-functional structure of
the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Indeed, it modulates the trafﬁcking of speciﬁc molecules
and contributes to the maintenance of normal neuronal activity. It is also implicated in
immunological functions and protects the brain from bacteria and microbial molecules
during the CNS developmental phase and in adulthood [92,93]. Balanced GM is necessary
to develop and maintain a normal blood–brain barrier.

In addition, structural changes, including increased activation of microglial cells, have
been observed post-mortem in the brains of autistic individuals [58,76]. All of this underlies
the hypothesis that ASD is a condition caused or at least accompanied by immune activation
in the brain that leads to a neuroinflammatory state and could then lead to malfunctioning
synapses [76]. In the inflammatory phase, arginine vasopressin is released from the brain,
and it is a metabolite known to act on social behavior and is considered a biomarker for
ASD [76]. Furthermore, there is a reduced number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of
ASD patients [35,94], which makes them susceptible to the tetanus neurotoxin produced by
Clostridia tetani [94]. In fact, a high amount of Clostridium spp. was found in subjects with ASD,
which could explain the decrease in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of these subjects [94].

To date, clinical studies investigating neurological function, metabolites related to blood–
brain barrier integrity, microbial involvement and GI function in the context of ASD remain
lacking and have yet to determine whether they can be exploited as targets for therapies.

4. Dysbiosis in ASD Patients

The hypothesis that GI dysbiosis plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of ASD remains
a topic as complex as it is crucial. GM changes widely from birth to adulthood, and there is
still much debate about the timing of gut bacterial colonization. Recent data suggest that
microbes’ initial gut colonization may begin before birth, during pregnancy or through
placental colonization [95], although this remains controversial [96,97]. Further colonization
begins during and immediately after birth via vaginal delivery (vertical transmission) [98]
or, in the case of Cesarean delivery, through contact with the environment immediately
afterward (horizontal transmission) [99].

The microbiome ﬂuctuates dynamically as diet and environmental factors change over

the course of development [100].

Overall, this transfer of microbial agents to the fetus can help in shaping the immune
system, metabolic control and even behavioral aspects [101]. For example, the maternal
Bacteroides (B.) fragilis capsular polysaccharide A contributes to the formation of Treg
cells in the intestinal mucosa of the fetus, protecting against inﬂammation and enhancing
tolerance to food antigens [102]. Conversely, the composition of the maternal microbiota

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

8 of 27

depends on various inﬂuences, such as diet, antibiotic exposure and other environmental
factors. A primate study conﬁrmed the role of a high-fat maternal diet in shaping the gut
microbiome of offspring [103]. Moreover, maternal consumption of probiotics is correlated
with a reduced risk of preterm delivery [104] and the development of allergic diseases
in offspring [105]. (On the other hand, antibiotic treatment may limit or alter the fetus’s
exposure to bacteria and their products, causing aberrant primitive immunity.)

In mouse models, antibiotic therapy during pregnancy reduces IL-17-producing cells
and increases the risk of neonatal sepsis [106]. Hsiao et al. reported that, by stimulating
the maternal immune system throughout pregnancy, the offspring show abnormalities
in behavior resembling those observed in ASD [107]. Furthermore, by analyzing the
offspring’s intestinal microbiota and intestinal mucosa, dysbiosis and increased intestinal
permeability were found. However, oral probiotic supplementation with B. fragilis during
weaning could improve behavioral abnormalities and dysbiosis [107]. Maternal immune
activation is also associated with elevated levels of circulating IL-6 and IL-17A [108], which
are involved in differentiating Th17 cells. This underlies the hypothesis that the effect of the
microbiota on the immune response consists of modulation to maintain a proper balance
between pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory states mediated by Th17 and Treg cells,
respectively [109]. From this, it follows that the GM may be involved in the multifactorial
etiology of cognitive and behavioral disorders and protection from them.

Other post-natal factors that shape the gut microbial community include nutritional habits

(breast or formula feeding), antibiotic therapy, infections, stress and host genetics [110–112].

In general, it has been seen that human breast milk promotes the growth of beneﬁcial
bacteria, such as Biﬁdobacteria [113], which are specialized in the digestion of oligosaccha-
rides contained in human milk [114], with Biﬁdobacterium longum among them [115]. It was
found in a study that children with autism experience a signiﬁcantly shorter breastfeed-
ing period [116]. In addition, a higher risk of developing ASD was observed in children
who were not breastfed [76]. Similarly, infants born vaginally have a microbiota with a
dominance of Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Snethia spp. [114], whereas those delivered by Ce-
sarean delivery have an altered microbiota composition with a dominance of Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium spp. [114,117], E. coli and Clostridium difﬁcile [118].

In a Swedish study based on a population-based registry with approximately 2.6 million
children, elective Cesarean delivery compared with natural vaginal delivery was observed
to be associated with a 20% signiﬁcantly higher risk of developing ASD in the child [119].
On the other hand, no association was reported in the sibling control analysis. Therefore,
the authors concluded that Cesarean delivery and ASD are not associated with each
other [119]. Similarly, a British study with more than 18,000 participants found no link
between Cesarean delivery and ASD [120].

It is an accepted fact that antibiotic use in the ﬁrst 1000 days of life can have detrimental
effects on the normal constitution of the microbiota with long-term effects [121]. It has also
been reported that many children with ASD take relatively high doses of oral antibiotics
in the ﬁrst years of life, which could be a factor leading to dysbiosis [122]. It has been
observed that even several months after the cessation of antibiotic treatment, recovery
of the microbiota to the pre-therapy state is incomplete in a substantial percentage of
individuals [123]. Thus, early antibiotic use in infants may alter microbial colonization of
the gut and result in decreased taxonomic diversity [123].

The hypothesis about the possible role of the GM in the pathogenesis of autism began
with the consideration of Clostridium and the hypothesis that the neurotoxic effects of
Clostridium could be linked to the onset of ASD [94]. Several studies have demonstrated an
increased abundance of species belonging to Clostridium in the fecal samples of autistic
children [75,124]. It has also been hypothesized that subacute and chronic Clostridium
tetani infection may be responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder [94]. This has
been supported by investigations with promising results on the administration of oral
vancomycin, minimally absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and thus speciﬁcally targeting
the intestinal lumen and its microbiota in ASD [125].

Dysbiosis can also be affected by emotional and physiological stress, as it can alter the
pattern of mucus secretion [126], induce a temporary reduction in gastric emptying [127,128]
and cause local immune activity by altering intestinal permeability [129]. All these effects
can have a severe impact on the proliferation of intestinal microorganisms.

Moreover, to date, the precise relationship between host genetics and microbial dys-
biosis in ASD is unknown. The genetic background is quite complex, and more than
1000 point mutations are associated with this disorder [130–132]. In a study by Liu et al.,
there was evidence of how host genetics shape the fecal microbial community [133]. Many
ASD-associated mutations occur in genes encoding synaptic cytoplasmic and cell adhesion
molecules, scaffolding proteins and various molecules involved in neurotransmission or
the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis [132].

For example, a missense mutation in neuroligin 3 protein [134], which regulates
dendritic growth and neuronal morphology, has been identiﬁed in patients with ASD [135].
Multiple mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein “SH3 and multiple
ankyrin repeat domains 3” (SHANK3) have been found to be associated with ASD [136],
altering cortical neuronal connectivity and increasing the risk of ASD diagnosis [137].
SHANK3 mutations alter the enteric nervous system, leading to abnormalities in GI motility
and structural alterations in the GI tract [138–140].

Other environmental factors that may alter microbial proﬁles and contribute to the
etiology of ASD include several drugs, including the antiepileptic valproate, that alter gut
microbial function, including SCFA production [141]. The risk of ASD diagnosis has also
been proven to increase in infants born to mothers who are prescribed valproate [142].

In addition, diet plays a key role in determining the composition and function of the

gut microbiome [110,143].

ASD children often consume a more selective diet and refuse to eat certain foods,
likely because of hyper/hyposensitivity to sensory input associated with ASD [144,145].
Therefore, a selective diet could inﬂuence the composition of the GM. Signiﬁcant changes
in the human GM have been demonstrated after eating an all-animal or plant-based diet
for only four days [146]. In general, the intake of a diet rich in vegetables, fruits and ﬁber is
associated with increased richness and taxonomic diversity of the GM [147].

On this subject, in recent years, the emergence of metabolomics has made it possible
to detect alterations in metabolites in ASD effectively [148], and major metabolomic studies
on blood samples are summarized in Table 1. Decreased levels of antioxidants, high levels
of bacterial-derived phenolic compounds and a high concentration of SCFAs have been
reported to be found in the urine, stools and blood of children with autism [149–152]. These
factors may result in abnormal neuron mitochondrial function, epigenetically regulating
ASD-related gene expression [53,153]. In addition, free amino acid levels are much higher in
autistic children than they are in controls and correlate with increased proteolytic bacteria,
such as Clostridium and Bacteroides [153]. In a study by Noto et al., elevated levels of
3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid, phenylalanine,
tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, the latter four of which are
involved in the tyrosine pathway leading to the neurotransmitter catecholamine, were
found in the urine of 21 ASD children compared to their siblings [154].

In addition to the factors mentioned above, the alteration of neurotransmitters is an-
other potential mechanism linking dysbiosis to the development of ASD. Hyposerotonemia
has been reported in the brains and blood of individuals with ASD [140,171]. According to
some authors, the disruption of this biomarker could relate to intestinal dysbiosis because,
as mentioned earlier, 95% of circulating serotonin is produced from intestinal enterochro-
mafﬁn cells [85]. According to DeTheije et al., the low-grade inﬂammatory gut state of ASD
children may induce enterochromafﬁn cells, mast cells and platelets to produce serotonin
synthesis, inducing intestinal dysmotility and tryptophan consumption [172]. Moreover,
dysbiosis can reduce tryptophan availability by decreasing amino acid uptake from the
diet [173]. Consequently, despite higher levels of circulating serotonin from the gut, the
effective availability of this neurotransmitter to the CNS may actually be decreased. Unfor-
tunately, neither tryptophan supplementation nor selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
have ever proved effective [50].

There is still debate on the exact function of GM in ASD, and despite the opposing
results of some studies, the comprehensive assessment of microbiome modiﬁcations due to
both genetic and environmental inﬂuences could be useful in planning preventive strategies
that act on the microbiota.

5. Alterations in Microbial Composition in ASD

There are many reasons why research has focused on alterations in GM as a risk factor
for the development of ASD symptoms. For example, in a 2019 study by Sharon et al., it
was found that germ-free mice exhibit behavior that resembles ASD after colonization with
the fecal microbiota of human donors with autism [70]. In this study, subjects with ASD
had a different abundance of Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides
compared to the control group. They also remarked that mice treated with the GM of ASD
patients present alternative splicing of many ASD-related genes in the brain. In addition,
a reduction in some metabolite proﬁles was observed in the ASD group, particularly
5-aminovaleric acid and taurine [70].

Bacterial species composition differs widely among individuals [174], although the
microbiota of the GI tract is fairly preserved at the phylum level, where Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes prevail [174,175]. Many studies use fecal samples as a noninvasive proxy for
GM because of the difﬁculties of sampling gut tissue (e.g., via colonoscopy). Although
fecal microbiota seems to be of high representation in the colonic biota, it is a poorer proxy

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

12 of 27

for other areas of the GI tract [176,177]. Stool sampling is still the preferred method for
most studies of the intestinal microbiome in humans because fecal material comprises a
subgroup of microorganisms that inhabit both the lumen and the mucosa.

Next-generation sequencing technologies through ampliﬁcation, speciﬁcally by the
PCR of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene for taxonomic classiﬁcation, have contributed a
culture-independent and very efﬁcient approach for studying GM.

It is known that patients with ASD, compared with neurotypical children, largely
present an altered intestinal microbial composition [178]. However, no particular microbial
strains that might be associated with changes in various aspects such as age, diet, sex,
population and ASD severity have been identiﬁed to be altered in all microbiota studies on
ASD [179,180]. Patients with ASD often have microbial imbalances of various types, even
though alterations in GM in patients with autism are not always the same across studies.
A commonly noticed phenomenon in the feces of ASD children is a reduced ratio of
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which might result from a reduction in the relative abun-
dance of the phylum Bacteroidetes, responsible for digesting polysaccharides [114,180–183].
Therefore, Settanni et al. supported the hypothesis that people with ASD have abnor-
mal carbohydrate digestion and intestinal mucosal dysbiosis [179,184]. Conﬂicting data
were reported in the study conducted by De Angelis et al. on 30 subject children who
reported higher numbers of Bacteroidetes than Firmicutes in ASD compared with those
of the controls [185]. However, these ﬁndings were not statistically relevant [185]. In
the same study, the phyla Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria were represented in lower
concentrations in the feces of ten ASD compared to ten controls [185]. The signiﬁcantly
increased bacteria in ASD were Akkermansia spp., Anaerophilum, Dorea spp., Clostridium spp.,
Barnesiella intestinihominis, Enterobacteriaceae, Roseburia spp., Faecalibacterium spp. (especially
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), Parasutterella excrementihominis, Turicibacter spp., Pseudomonas,
Prevotella oris and Prevotella copri. The signiﬁcantly reduced bacteria in ASD were E. coli,
Biﬁdobacterium, Oscillospira, Fusobacterium, Subdoligranulum spp. and Streptococcus spp. The
least represented strains in children with ASD were Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus
spp., Collinsella spp. (except Collinsella aerofaciens) and Staphylococcus [185].

In a study by Kang et al., the fecal microbiota of twenty autistic children with GI
problems was compared with that of twenty neurotypical individuals. It showed signiﬁ-
cantly lower bacterial diversity in children with ASD [122,186]. In addition, they reported
a decreased abundance of the Coprococcus, Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae in patients with
autism [187]. Prevotella spp. are commensal intestinal microbes specialized in vitamin B1
synthesis and the degradation of vegetable polysaccharides. Thus, a vitamin B1 deﬁciency
could be determined by a lower abundance of Prevotella spp. Minor differences have been
observed in the genus Sutterella, which is less represented in ASD children [122]. These re-
sults suggest a changed composition of the microbiota in children with ASD that potentially
could have biochemical and functional implications for the guest.

In earlier research, some Prevotella spp. (P. oralis, P. ruminicola, P. tanneries) were found
to be reduced in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [36]. This research suggests that
GI symptoms in ASD are related to altered balance in the microbiota [187].

In other past research, the amount of the genus Akkermansia was reported to decrease
in children with ASD, whereas the amount of Desulfovibrio spp. increased [135,182]. The
latter bacteria are recognized as being harmful, as they might exacerbate ASD patterns and
GI disorders [188].

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Iglesias-Vázquez et al.,
including 18 studies with 493 autistic children and 404 healthy controls, it was found that
GM is composed primarily of the genera Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, all of
which are more numerous in autistic children than they are in healthy controls [189].

Autistic children displayed a significantly increased abundance of the genera Bacteroides,
Phascolarctobacterium, Clostridium, Parabacteroides and Faecalibacterium and minor amount
of Coprococcus and Biﬁdobacterium. The authors concluded by suggesting the actual exis-
tence of dysbiosis in autistic children that could inﬂuence the development and severity

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

13 of 27

of autistic symptomatology [189]. However, controversial results have been reported
among the studies included in the analysis. For Bacteroidetes, most studies identiﬁed
a higher abundance in autistic children [21,122,179,190–192], whereas others reported
opposite results [180,193,194]; for Firmicutes, some studies have shown greater percent-
ages in children with ASD [180,193,194], whereas others have shown greater percentages
in healthy controls [21,190,192], with others even indicating no distinction between the
groups [122,191]. For Actinobacteria, the relative abundance was not signiﬁcantly different
between those with ASD and the controls.

In a study by William et al., the microbiota was analyzed on intestinal biopsies of the
cecum and terminal ileum, and signiﬁcantly more Sutterella spp. were found in twenty-
three children with ASD compared to those in nine controls. Sutterella spp. are usually
poor in healthy GM and were not detected in any of the healthy controls. However, they
were found in 12 of the 23 individuals with ASD [195]. Kushak et al. also studied microbial
composition in duodenal biopsies comparing 19 ASD children with 21 controls without
ﬁnding signiﬁcant differences between phyla, but the authors observed some alterations
at the genera and strain levels [196]. In particular, Burkholderia spp. was signiﬁcantly
augmented in subjects with ASD compared with the controls. Oscillospira, Actinomyces,
Ralstonia and Peptostreptococcus were increased, and the genera Bacteroides, Devosia, Neisseria,
Prevotella and Streptococcus were underrepresented in autistic children compared with the
controls. In addition, lower abundances of Escherichia coli were reported [196].

Kushak et al. were unable to identify signiﬁcant differences at the phylum level, as
other research has cited [180,182,183,185], likely because all other studies analyzed the
GM composition of fecal specimens and not duodenal mucosal biopsies. As previously
mentioned, stool samples broadly represent the GM composition of the large bowel [197].
Kushak et al. instead mapped the GM composition of the small bowel, and in their conclu-
sions, the authors suggested that microbial alterations in the large gut may have a more
important effect on ASD than do alterations in the small bowel. Hence, a clearer portrayal
of the GM environment may be obtained by collecting mucosal specimens from throughout
the gut tract to confront the microbiota and better understand the interrelationships of GM
functioning and interaction with the host.

A decreased amount of Bacteroides, with a significantly increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes
ratio, was found in the ileum and cecum biopsies of 15 autistic children (7 controls) [183].
Firmicutes amounts were slightly increased in the autistic group. The Betaproteobacteria
(Proteobacteria) class was signiﬁcantly more copious in the fecal specimens from the cecum
of autistic patients [183].

In addition, sibling control studies in the literature have led to discordant results.
In a Slovak study conducted by Tomova et al. on 29 participants, including ASD
children, their siblings and healthy controls, they reported that the amounts of Lactobacillus
spp., Desulfovibrio spp. and Clostridia spp. were signiﬁcantly increased in the stools
of subjects with ASD compared to those of their siblings and the controls. Moreover,
Biﬁdobacterium spp. was decreased in autistic children [182]. Desulfovibrio spp. could be
an essential factor in GI inﬂammation because its main metabolic byproduct, hydrogen
sulﬁde, is cytotoxic to colonicmucosa [198]. In addition, when administered to rodents,
Desulfovibrio spp. reduces working memory [199].

Desulfovibrio spp. abundance has been associated by researchers with the severity
of behavioral symptoms in communication, social interaction and restricted/repetitive
behavior in autism. In non-autistic siblings of children with ASD, a lower abundance of
Bacteroidetes and Biﬁdobacterium spp. and a higher amount of Desulfovibrio spp. were
shown than those in autistic children. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the levels of
bacterial strains may be the key turning factor between healthy and ASD phenotypes [182].
In contrast, no significant differences were found in a study conducted by Gondalia et al.
on the microbial composition of 51 subjects with ASD and their 53 nonautistic siblings [193].
Likewise, another study that included 59 ASD children and 44 nonautistic siblings also
reported no signiﬁcant differences in GM composition [200]. These ﬁndings imply that

Nutrients 2023, 15, 1620

14 of 27

siblings’ microbiota are similar and independent of their autism phenotype [193], likely
due to the shared environment and genetic inheritance [56].

Compared with neurotypical healthy subjects, autistic children have been demon-
strated to have a signiﬁcantly higher amount of Clostridium spp., which has been as-
sociated with disease severity according to the Childhood Autism Rating score (CARs
score) [178,201,202]. In a study conducted by Finnegold et al. on fecal samples from
33 autistic children, they observed a signiﬁcantly higher rate of Clostridium perfringens
producing beta2-toxin gene in ASD children compared to that in 13 controls [186]. Sim-
ilarly, Alshammari et al. observed a greater presence of Clostridium perfringens in ASD
children than that in the controls [203,204]. In addition, Beta2 toxin has been linked to
more GI abnormalities, such as food poisoning and diarrhea [181]. Fisher et al. found that
stool samples from patients with ASD had 79% beta2 toxin, whereas it was only 38% in
the controls [181].

In a review, the authors suggested that a subacute tetanic infection with Clostridium
tetani, an opportunistic pathogen, could cause some cases of ASD following the production
of tetanus neurotoxin [94]. It inhibits the discharge of synaptic vesicles holding neuro-
transmitters by irreversibly cleaving synaptobrevin. Synapses with cleaved synaptobrevin
degrade, and the decreased synaptic activity is correlated with the decreased social behavior
found in ASD [94].

In addition, fungal gut dysbiosis has been found in the autistic population in addition
to bacterial changes. The yeast Candida albicans, which makes ammonia and other toxins
likely associated with ASD-related behavior, has been identiﬁed in the guts of autistic chil-
dren more often than in those of non-ASD children [201,205]. A study by Kantarcioglu et al.
found a higher amount of Candida spp. in the intestines of 415 autistic individuals com-
pared with that in 403 controls [205]. The authors estimated that about 60% of the healthy
population are asymptomatic carriers of Candida spp., which appears to be associated
with some autistic behaviors [205]. In ASD subjects, altered microbiota diversity promotes
the rise of Candida spp., which, once settled in the intestine, prevents the recolonization
of commensal microbiota [180]. Candida spp. produces ammonia and toxins and also
causes the malabsorption of minerals and carbohydrates, which could play a role in the
pathophysiology of ASD [205].

All the cited studies have reportedd a dysbiotic bacterial proﬁle in ASD children. The
direction of causation, i.e., whether alterations in microbial proﬁles are related to the onset
of ASD, is still under study.

6. Role of Probiotics in ASD

Evidence of the beneﬁcial effects of probiotic and symbiotic formulations in individ-
uals with ASD has been evaluated over the years through numerous studies (Table 2).
Supplementation with probiotics allows for the use of an easy and noninvasive approach in
modulating the composition and functions of GM and likely also in affecting host immune
signaling, resulting in improved or prevented inﬂammation [187,206].

In a recent study conducted in an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
the administration of L. casei Shirota reduced obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms,
which are likely secondary to the regulation of serotonin-related gene expression [216].
In another mouse model study, treatment with Bacteroides fragilis effectively reduced gut
permeability and altered levels of tight junction proteins and cytokines, proving to be an
attractive treatment for improving a leaky gut and behavioral symptoms [107].

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted by Parracho et al., supplemen-
tation with L. plantarum WCSF1 for three months in children with ASD resulted in an
amelioration of gut symptoms (p < 0.01) but also, more importantly, in an improvement in
behavioral scores (p < 0.05) [207]. The authors observed an augmentation in enterococci
and lactobacilli and a decrease in Clostridium cluster XIVa compared with those in the
placebo group [207].

Kału ˙zna-Czapli ´nska and Blaszczyk performed an open-label study by supplementing
22 ASD children aged 4 to 11 years with L. acidophilus Rosell-11 for two months [208]. The
authors found that probiotic supplementation helps to mitigate behavioral issues that are
characteristic of ASD and signiﬁcantly reduce urinary levels of D-arabinitol, a metabolite
of Candida spp., compared with the baseline (p < 0.05) [208].

West et al. examined the efﬁcacy of Delpro®, a probiotic supplement with a mixture
of ﬁve strains of biﬁdobacterial and lactobacilli with the addition of the immunomodulator
Del-Immune V® (L. rhamnosus V, cell lysate) in children with ASD (n = 33, 3–16 years) [210].
After three weeks of treatment, participants reported a 48% reduction in diarrhea severity
and a 52% reduction in constipation severity [210]. In addition, 88% of the children showed
an improvement in ASD symptoms with a decrease in ASD severity scores [210].

Another pilot study by Tomova et al. treated ASD children (n = 10, 5–17 years), their sib-
lings (n = 9) and neurotypical controls (n = 10) with a mixture of probiotics (Biﬁdobacterium,
Lactobacillus and Streptococcus spp.) for four months [182]. The researchers described a
signiﬁcant reduction in Biﬁdobacterium and Desulfovibrio spp. and in the normalization of
the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in the stools of children with ASD, but also a reduction in
TNF-α levels, a key inﬂammatory cytokine in intestinal inﬂammation (p < 0.05) [182].

Treating ASD children (n = 30, 5–9 years old) for three months with a mixture of
probiotics (L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and Biﬁdobacterium longum), Shaaban et al. found a
signiﬁcant increase in Biﬁdobacteria and Lactobacilli in stool samples along with a reduction
in autism severity scores compared to baseline results (p = 0.0001) and total GI symptom
severity (p < 0.0001) [211].

A more recent cross-over, a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study by Arnold
et al., evaluated the magnitude of the effect and safety of VISBIOME (formerly VSL#3), a
mixture of eight probiotic strains of Lactobacilli, Biﬁdobacteria and Streptococcus thermophiles in
children with ASD and comorbidities of anxiety and GI disorders (n = 13, 3–12 years) [212].

Probiotic supplementation produced nonsigniﬁcant and temporary improvements in GI
symptoms compared with the placebo (p = 0.02) and did not change bacterial species
diversity and microbiome composition [212].

Also, in another recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial con-
ducted by Santocchi et al., VISBIOME was administered in preschool children with ASD
(n = 63, 18–72 months) for six months [213]. Probiotic treatment did not lead to signiﬁ-
cant differences in autism severity or in fecal or blood inﬂammatory markers between
groups [213]. In the subgroup analysis of patients without GI symptoms, probiotic supple-
mentation signiﬁcantly reduced total autism severity scores compared with the placebo
(p = 0.026). Similarly, in the subgroup of patients with GI manifestations, there was a signif-
icant decrease in GI symptom severity scores compared with the placebo (p = 0.0191) [213].
Furthermore, if probiotics are used together with prebiotics, a substrate selectively
used by host microorganisms that confers a health beneﬁt, synbiotics are created, which
are a mixture that includes live microorganisms and substrates selectively used by host
microbiota that confer a health beneﬁt to the host [217].

In a randomized clinical trial conducted by Sanctuary et al., children with ASD and
GI comorbidities such as chronic constipation, diarrhea and/or irritable bowel syndrome
(n = 8, 2–11 years) were randomized to receive Biﬁdobacterium infantis UCD272 in combina-
tion with a bovine colostrum product (BCP), a prebiotic or BCP alone [214]. Subjects had
both treatments for ﬁve weeks, but in a different order according to randomization with a
2-week washout period. These supplementations showed that both were well tolerated by
the patients; both treatments signiﬁcantly reduced abdominal pain; a signiﬁcant reduction
in the incidence of diarrhea was only found in the BCP arm (p = 0.021); there was a decrease
in the total aberrant behavior scores in the BCP group (p = 0.006); and there were no overall
alterations in the GM or associated metabolites (fecal, urinary or blood) in either treatment
arm [214]. According to researchers, an improvement in GI symptoms may be due to a
signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of helper T lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells) expressing
IL-13, a cytokine involved in allergic disorders, after treatment with a symbiotic, and in
the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing TNF-α (a cytokine involved in inﬂammatory
responses) after treatment with BCP alone observed in the analysis of blood samples after
treatment [214]. However, this study had a signiﬁcant limitation determined by the low
number of patients and the lack of a placebo arm [214].

In a 2020 randomized controlled trial, Wang et al. administered a probiotic mix-
ture (one packet per day containing L. rhamnosus HN001, Biﬁdobacterium lactis BL-04,
Biﬁdobacterium infantis Bi-26 and L. paracasei LPC-37) in combination with a prebiotic con-
sisting of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or a placebo in ASD children (n = 26, 2–8 years)
for 30–108 days [215]. Supplementation showed a signiﬁcant improvement in GI mani-
festations (diarrhea, constipation and fecal odor) in the treatment arm (p < 0.001), signiﬁ-
cantly reduced autism severity scores (p = 0.009), increased levels of Biﬁdobacterium longum
(p < 0.001) and reduced levels of potentially pathogenic species, such as Clostridium spp.
(p < 0.05) [215]. In addition, the normalization of blood serotonin and fecal SCFAs levels
and decreased blood levels of zonulin (a marker of intestinal permeability) were observed
(p < 0.01) [215].

Finally, in a study conducted by Pärtty et al., supplementation with L. rhamnosus
GG was performed for its potential preventive role in neurodevelopmental diseases [209].
Seventy-ﬁve infants were randomized to receive the probiotic or placebo for 6 months with
a 13-year follow-up. The researchers found that, after 13 years of follow-up, no children
in the probiotic arm developed Asperger’s syndrome or attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) (0%) compared with 17.1% in the placebo arm (p = 0.008). In addition,
children with neurological impairment signiﬁcantly showed a minor abundance of fecal
Biﬁdobacteria in the ﬁrst six months of life compared to healthy children (p = 0.03) [209].

In a 2019 systematic review conducted by Qin Xiang et al. on the effects of prebi-
otics/probiotics on ASD and its associated symptoms, the authors stated that the literature
supporting the role of probiotics in alleviating GI or behavioral symptoms in ASD indi-

viduals is limited because there is no standardized probiotic regimen because of various
species, concentrations and varying durations of supplementation [218].

Preliminary results on probiotic supplementation in ASD suggest that it is a promising
approach to decrease the severity of ASD symptoms and to address GI comorbidities by
exploiting probiotics’ capability to decrease the inﬂammatory potential of GM.

Nevertheless, given the heterogeneity of clinical trials, the possibility of producing an

evidence base for targeted treatments is limited to date.

7. Conclusions

ASD is a complex disease that is typical of early age-related brain development
that affects the quality of life of not only patients but also caregivers. The etiology of
ASD remains unknown, but several factors may contribute to its onset, including genetic
variations and environmental inﬂuences, especially during the peri-natal period. Scientiﬁc
evidence in recent years has attributed a key role to GM in the pathogenesis of ASD, as
it inﬂuences the development of the CNS and neuropsychological and GI homeostasis
through the microbiota–gut–brain axis.
Indeed, a state of dysbiosis with a reduction
in the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and the level of Bacteroidetes is common in the ASD
community. Not surprisingly, there is a high incidence of functional GI disorders, especially
diarrhea, chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, which are often associated
with dysbiotic states and a “leaky gut” in ASD subjects. In recent decades, many authors
have attempted to study and identify the microbial signature on intestinal mucosa biopsies
and fecal samples in ASDs through in vivo and ex vivo studies. In this regard, the advent
of metabolomics has also been of great support. Based on these data, various therapeutic
strategies, primarily probiotics, have been investigated to improve ASD symptoms through
microbiota modulation. However, the heterogeneity of the studies precludes concrete
evidence, although preliminary results are promising. To date, a holistic approach with a
multidisciplinary team appears to be the winning weapon for the management of patients
with ASD in clinical practice.
