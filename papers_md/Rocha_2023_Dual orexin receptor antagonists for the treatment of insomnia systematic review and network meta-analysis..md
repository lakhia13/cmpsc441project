Background Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that dual orexin
receptor antagonists (DORAs) are effective in the treatment of chronic insomnia.
However, the superiority of one particular DORA over the others remains unclear.
Objective To perform a network meta-analysis to evaluate the efﬁcacy of different
DORAs in patients with chronic insomnia.
Methods The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for
RCTs that compared DORA with placebo in patients (cid:1) 18 years of age with a diagnosis
of insomnia disorder. We pooled outcomes for wake time after sleep onset (WASO),
latency to persistent sleep (LPS), total sleep time (TST), and adverse events (AEs).
Results We included 10 RCTs with 7,806 patients, 4,849 of whom received DORAs as the
intervention. Overall, we found that DORAs were associated with the improvement of all
analyzed efﬁcacy outcomes. Concerning TST, an apparent dose-dependent pattern was
noticed, with higher doses relating to a longer TST. Lemborexant 10mg provided the largest
reduction in WASO (at month 1) in minutes (standardized mean difference [SMD] ¼ -25.40;
95% conﬁdence interval [95%CI] ¼ -40.02–-10.78), followed by suvorexant 20/15mg (SMD
¼ -25.29; 95%CI ¼ -36.42–-14.15), which also appeared to provide the largest decrease in
long-term WASO (SMD ¼ -23.70; 95%CI ¼ -35.89–-11.51). The most frequent AEs were
somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and headache, with rates of up to 14.8%.
Conclusion Our results suggest that DORAs are associated with greater efﬁcacy when
compared with placebo in the treatment of insomnia, a complex 24-hour sleep
disorder. Additionally, dosing might play an important role in the management of
chronic insomnia.

Antecedentes
Inúmeros ensaios clínicos randomizados (ECRs) têm demonstrado que
os antagonistas duais do receptor de orexina (dual orexin receptor antagonists, DORAs,
em inglês) são eﬁcazes no tratamento da insônia. Contudo, restam dúvidas quanto à
superioridade de um DORA com relação aos outros.
Objetivo Realizar uma meta-análise em rede para avaliar a eﬁcácia de diferentes
DORAs em pacientes com insônia.
Métodos
Foram feitas buscas nas bases de dados Medline, Embase e Cochrane
Central por ECRs que comparassem DORAs e placebo em pacientes (cid:1) 18 anos de idade
com diagnóstico de insônia. Os seguintes desfechos foram selecionados: tempo
desperto após o início do sono (wake time after sleep onset, WASO, em inglês), latência
para o sono persistente (latency to persistent sleep, LPS, em inglês), tempo total de sono
(total sleep time, TST, em inglês), e efeitos adversos (EAs).
Incluímos 10 ensaios clínicos com 7,806 pacientes, 4,849 dos quais recebe-

ram DORAs como intervenção. Os DORAs foram associados à melhoria de todos os
desfechos de eﬁcácia analisados. Em relação ao TST, um aparente padrão de dependência
da dose foi identiﬁcado, com doses maiores se associando a um maior TST. Lemborexant
10 mg proporcionou a maior redução em WASO (no primeiro mês) em minutos (diferença
padronizada das médias [standardized mean difference, [SMD], em inglês) ¼ -25.40; inter-
valo de conﬁança de 95% [IC95%] ¼ -40.02–-10.78), seguido de suvorexant 20/15mg
(SMD ¼ -25.29; IC95% ¼ -36.42–-14.15), o qual também proporcionou a maior diminuição
em WASO no longo prazo (SMD ¼ -23.70; IC95% ¼ -35.89–-11.51). Os EAs mais frequentes
foram sonolência, nasofaringite e cefaleia, com taxas de até 14.8%.
Conclusão Nossos resultados sugerem que os DORAs estão associados a uma maior
eﬁcácia quando comparados com placebo no tratamento da insônia, um complexo
transtorno do sono de 24 horas. Além disso, a dosagem pode desempenhar um papel
importante no manejo da insônia crônica.

INTRODUCTION

Insomnia, which is deﬁned as difﬁculty in sleep induction or
maintenance along with daytime manifestations, is the most
prevalent sleep disorder.1 There are two main diagnostic
classiﬁcations for this condition. According to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition
(DSM-5),2 insomnia disorder can be of the short-term,
recurrent, and persistent (symptoms lasting more than 3
months) types, whereas The International Classiﬁcation of
Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3),1 categorizes it into
short-term, chronic or other types.

Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience short-
term insomnia, and up to 10% meet the criteria for chronic
insomnia, with a higher prevalence in older individuals.3 This
condition has been associated with a signiﬁcant social
burden,4 and patients may have an increased risk of devel-
oping cardiovascular5,6 and psychiatric diseases.7 At present,
the pharmacological treatment for insomnia still relies pre-
dominantly on GABA-modulating drugs such as benzodia-
zepines and Z-drugs. Nonetheless, they induce a global
depression of the brain, and are linked to substantial side

effects, potential risk of abuse, and rebound insomnia, which
limit their long-term use.8,9

In this context, dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs)
emerged over a decade ago10 with the prospect of being a
safer option in the treatment of insomnia. Orexin is a
neuropeptide that plays a role in the promotion of wakeful-
ness, with two associated postsynaptic G-protein coupled
receptors (orexin receptor 1, OxR1, and orexin receptor 2,
OxR2).11,12 The DORAs act by targeting the orexin cascade
through the antagonism of both receptors, promoting sleep
induction and maintenance, with a more localized effect.13
Over the last years, several clinical trials were developed
to assess the safety and efﬁcacy of DORAs in both adults and
including suvorexant,14–16 lemborex-
elderly individuals,
ant,17,18 ﬁlorexant,19 almorexant,20 and daridorexant.21,22
The variety of available DORAs represents important ther-
apeutic progress, but it also raises questions regarding the
optimal dosing and the superiority of one particular DORA
over the others. Therefore, we sought
to perform an
updated systematic review and network meta-analysis to
evaluate the efﬁcacy of different DORAs in patients with
chronic insomnia.

DORAs for the treatment of insomnia

METHODS

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion in the present meta-analysis was restricted to studies
that met all of the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), (2) comparing DORAs with placebo or DORAs
with placebo and zolpidem, (3) enrolling patients (cid:1) 18 years of
age diagnosed with insomnia disorder according to DSM-4 or
-5, (4) and reporting at least one of the outcomes of interest.
We excluded studies with (1) crossover design, (2) overlapping
patient populations, and (3) studies that used selective orexin
receptor antagonists (SORAs) as the intervention.

Of note, most studies included compared DORAs with
placebo, whereas some of them20,21,23 added zolpidem as an
active control drug (►Table 1). When available, we chose to
include data regarding zolpidem to maximize the compar-
isons among different drugs. The patient, intervention, con-
trol, outcome, study design (PICOS) question and eligibility
criteria are displayed in ►Table 2.

Search strategy and data extraction
We systematically searched the Medline, Embase, and
Cochrane Central Register databases for RCTs published in
English from inception to May 2022. The following search
strategy was used: (Insomnia OR sleep initiation and mainte-
nance disorders) AND (dual orexin receptor antagonist OR
dual orexin receptor antagonists OR DORA OR DORAs OR
orexin receptor antagonist OR orexin receptor antagonists
OR ORA OR ORAs OR almorexant OR suvorexant OR lembor-
exant OR ﬁlorexant OR daridorexant). Previous systematic
reviews, meta-analyses, as well as the references of the
selected studies were also manually screened for any addi-
tional applicable studies. Two investigators (FFB and RBR)
independently screened the search results using the Men-
deley (Elsevier B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) reference
manager software and performed data extraction using the
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, United
States) software. Discrepancies were solved by the senior
author (JPMT). The study protocol was registered in the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews24
in May 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022334400).

Endpoints
We extracted data from pre-speciﬁed efﬁcacy outcomes,
which included wake time after sleep onset (WASO), latency
to persistent sleep (LPS), total sleep time (TST), and the most
frequent adverse events (AEs). Depending on the protocol of
each clinical trial, the mentioned outcomes could be pre-
sented as subjective measures, objective measures, or both.
When both measures were available, objective measures
were the preferred choice. Subjective (s) outcomes included
sWASO and sTST, derived from electronic sleep diary entries
made by patients. Polysomnography was performed for the
objective outcomes.

Cochrane, London, United Kingdom). Two independent
authors (RBR and GBN) completed the risk of bias analyses
according to ﬁve domains: randomization process, devia-
tions from intended interventions, missing outcome data,
measurement of outcome, and selection of reported results.
The risk of bias was stratiﬁed into low risk of bias, high risk of
bias, and some concerns. Disagreements were solved by the
senior author (JPMT). Certainty of evidence was assessed
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach based on each
efﬁcacy outcome included in the present study (WASO, LPS,
and TST).

Statistical analysis
The present systematic review and meta-analysis followed
the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
statement guidelines.16 The outcomes were compared using
standardized mean differences (SMDs). The meta-analysis
for WASO was performed according to the treatment period
(1 month or (cid:1) 3 months). For LPS, data from up to one month
was used, and TST analysis was made using the longest
interval available from each study.
Inconsistency was
assessed using I-squared (I2) statistic, and values > 50%
were considered representative of substantial heterogeneity.
Random-effects models were used, and all analyses were
performed using the “netmeta” R package (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The R software
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used to perform
statistical analysis.

RESULTS

Study selection and baseline characteristics
The initial literature search yielded 1,704 results (►Figure 1).
A total of 622 records were found to be duplicated, and 1,054
studies were excluded after reading the title/abstract. After
full-text revision of the remaining 28 studies, 10 RCTs from 8
articles were included (2 articles14,22 reported 2 RCTs each),
accounting for 7,806 participants.

A total of 4,849 patients received a DORA as the inter-
vention. Suvorexant was used in 1,844 patients, daridorex-
ant, in 1,475, lemborexant, in 1,166, and almorexant, in 364
subjects. The follow-up ranged from 2 weeks to 12 months,
and the drug doses ranged from 5 mg (lemborexant and
daridorexant) to 200 mg (almorexant). Speciﬁcally, the
doses of suvorexant ranged from 15 mg to 40 mg. The
high doses (of 30 mg and 40 mg) included in these studies
are not currently approved. In contrast, for daridorexant,
the doses ranged from 5 mg to 50 mg. The lower doses (of
5 mg and 10 mg) are non-therapeutic, and not approved
either. The main characteristics of the included studies are
reported in ►Table 1.

Quality assessment and certainty of evidence
Quality assessment and risk of bias were evaluated using the
Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool, version 2 (RoB-2,

Pooled analysis of all studies
Four network meta-analyses were conducted for 3 efﬁcacy
outcomes: (1) WASO month 1 and WASO (cid:1) 3 months, (2)
LPS, and (3) TST.

Inclusion criteria

Exclusion criteria

(P) Patient

Insomnia disorder (according to the DSM-5) or
primary insomnia (according to the DSM-4)

Overlapping patient populations

(I) Intervention

Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs)

Selective orexin receptor antagonists (SORAs)

(C) Control

Placebo
or
placebo and zolpidem (active control drug)
Efﬁcacy outcomes:
wake time after sleep onset (WASO);
latency to persistent sleep (LPS);
total sleep time (TST)

(S) Study design

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

Studies not written in English; crossover design.

Abbreviation: DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

WASO month 1
A total of six studies14,15,17,20–22 (eight trials) contributed to
this outcome. ►Figure 2A presents the forest plot of the
treatment effect of the available DORAs compared with place-
bo. Negative values indicate a reduction in WASO and favor
DORAs. No signiﬁcant effects were observed for zolpidem
6.25 mg (p ¼ 0.13), zolpidem 10 mg (p ¼ 0.08), almorexant
100 mg (p ¼ 0.33), almorexant 200 mg (p ¼ 0.16), and lower
doses of daridorexant: 5 mg (p ¼ 0.68), and 10 mg (p ¼ 0.88).
Lemborexant and suvorexant had the largest reductions in
WASO in minutes. Lemborexant 10 mg and 5 mg had very
similar results (SMD ¼ -25.40 and -24.00 respectively), despite
using a double dose. For daridorexant, the highest dose (of
50 mg) showed a greater effect (SMD ¼ -18.32; 95% conﬁdence
interval [95%CI] ¼ -29.42–-7.22). I2 statistic tests revealed very
high heterogeneity among the studies (tau-2 ¼ 46.12; tau
¼ 6.79; I2 ¼ 76.1% [95%CI ¼ 54.2–87.5%]).

WASO (cid:1) 3 months
Four studies14,15,18,22 (six trials) evaluated this outcome
(►Figure 2B). The largest reductions in WASO (cid:1) 3 months
were observed with suvorexant 20 mg/15 mg (SMD ¼ -23.70;
95%CI ¼ -35.89–-11.51), suvorexant 30 mg/40 mg (SMD ¼
-20.56; 95%CI ¼ -30.12–-10.99), and daridorexant 50 mg
(SMD ¼ -18.30; 95%CI ¼ -34.26–-2.34). Lemborexant (in doses
of 5 mg and 10mg) and lower doses of daridorexant (of 10 mg

of 40 mg/30 mg

LPS
Four studies14,20–22 (six trials) were included regarding this
outcome. The results are shown in ►Figure 3, with negative
results indicating a reduction in LPS, thus favoring DORAs.
Signiﬁcant reductions in LPS were observed for high doses of
95%CI ¼
suvorexant,
-18.17–-5.15), daridorexant 50 mg (SMD ¼ -9.27; 95%CI ¼
-15.00–-3.55), suvorexant 20 mg/15 mg (SMD ¼ -9.27; 95%
CI ¼ -16.09–-2.25), and daridorexant 25 mg (SMD ¼ -8.81;
95%CI ¼ -14.55–-3.07). Almorexant (in doses of 100 mg and
200 mg) and daridorexant 5mg did not show signiﬁcant
results (95%CI includes 0). High heterogeneity was detected
(tau-2 ¼ 14.29; tau ¼ 3.78; I2 ¼ 56.5% [95%CI ¼ 4.2%–80.2%])
using I2 statistic.

TST
Five studies (seven trials)14–16,18,22 contributed to the meta-
analysis of this outcome. The corresponding forest plot is
displayed in ►Figure 4, with positive SMD values indicating
increases in TST, thus favoring DORAs. Signiﬁcant results
were observed for all DORAs, with increases in SMD values
following what appears to be a dose-dependent pattern for
each individual drug. The highest dose of almorexant
(200 mg) showed a signiﬁcant increase (SMD ¼ 27.00; 95%
CI ¼ 16.77–37.23), as did suvorexant 40 mg/30 mg (SMD
¼ 23.64; 95%CI ¼ 18.74–28.55),

¼ 22.69; 95%CI ¼ 9.43–35.95), and daridorexant 50 mg (SMD
¼ 19.80; 95%CI ¼ 9.66–29.94). Apparently smaller but signif-
icant increases in TST were observed for lower doses of each
DORA (daridorexant 10 mg/25 mg, suvorexant 20 mg/15 mg,
lemborexant 5 mg, and almorexant 100 mg). No signiﬁcant
results were detected for zolpidem 10 mg (SMD ¼ 6.0; 95%
CI ¼ -4.91–16.91). The I2 statistic tests revealed low hetero-
geneity (tau-2 ¼ 4.96; tau ¼ 2.23; I2 ¼ 18.9% [0.0%; 63.7%]).

AEs
The most frequent AEs were somnolence, nasopharyngitis,
and headache (►Table 3), with incidence rates ranging from
4.1% to 13.2%, 4.0% to 12%, and 4.9% to 14.8% respectively.
Somnolence appeared to be dose-dependent for both suvor-
exant and lemborexant. In contrast, the most common AEs in
studies using daridorexant21,22 were nasopharyngitis and
headache.

Quality assessment and certainty of evidence
Overall, the studies were found to be of high quality. Only one
study (Long-term Study of Lemborexant in Insomnia Disor-
der, SUNRISE 2)18 had a high risk of bias, which arose from
selective reporting (►Figure 5). Analyses of domains regard-
ing outcome data were performed based on WASO. One
study16 did not contribute to the mentioned outcome, so
TST was used.

According to the GRADE analysis, the quality of the
evidence was rated as moderate for WASO (month 1 and
(cid:1) 3 months). The quality of the evidence for LPS and TST was
considered high. The downgrade in the certainty of evidence
was due to inconsistency, which was stated as very serious,
serious, and not serious for WASO, LPS and TST respectively
(Supplementary Material ►Supplementary Figure S1 and
►Supplementary Table S1 [online only]).

DISCUSSION

In the present meta-analysis of 10 double-blinded RCTs
including 7,086 patients, we compared 4 different DORAs
(almorexant, daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant)
with placebo and zolpidem. Our ﬁndings can be summarized
as follows: (a) DORAs were associated with an improvement
in all analyzed efﬁcacy outcomes; (b) lemborexant and
suvorexant resulted in the greatest reductions in WASO
month 1; (c) suvorexant 20 mg/15 mg and 30 mg/40 mg,
and Daridorexant 50 mg, the greatest reductions in WASO
(cid:1) 3 months; (d) suvorexant 40 mg/30 mg and 20 mg/15 mg,
and Daridorexant 50 mg and 25 mg presented signiﬁcant
reductions in LPS; (e) regarding TST, signiﬁcant results
were observed for all DORAs, with an apparent dose-depen-
dent pattern; and (f) the most frequent AEs were mild, with
incidence rates of up to 14.8%.

Daridorexant is the most recent DORA, and it was ﬁrst
approved in early 2022. The recommended therapeutic doses
include both 25-mg and 50-mg formulations.25 According to
our analysis, lower doses of daridorexant did not show
signiﬁcant results for WASO (month 1 and (cid:1) 3 months) or
LPS, besides resulting in the smallest increases in TST.

These ﬁndings were already anticipated, because lower

ing with longer TST in minutes. Although dosing proved to be
an important aspect of TST, it was not the case for other
outcomes. For WASO and LPS, such a clear distinction was
not observed. Overall, lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg pre-
sented very similar results, despite dose differences. It is
also important to note that although higher doses of suvor-
exant are effective and outperform lower doses (of 15 mg/
20 mg) for some endpoints (LPS and TST), they are not
currently approved due to safety concerns.26 At present,
suvorexant is the only DORA recommended in the guide-
lines, with a maximum dosage of 20 mg a day.3

Regarding the safety proﬁle of DORAs, we observed
predominantly mild AEs with low incidence rates (from
4.1% to 14.8% overall). The most common AEs were somno-
lence, nasopharyngitis, and headache. According to a previ-
ous meta-analysis by Xue et al.,27 DORAs were also
associated with mild AEs, such as abnormal dreams, fatigue,
and dry mouth.17 This is another positive aspect of this drug
class, since conventional sleep medications are consistently
acknowledged for their negative side effects. Finally, a total of
three DORAs are approved by the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (suvorexant, lemborexant, and daridorexant), al-
though their availability is still limited throughout the world.

Limitations and strengths
The present study has limitations. First, the absence of direct
comparisons regarding different DORAs. The data extracted
for efﬁcacy outcomes from all trials incorporated were
restricted to differences between DORA and placebo, or
Zolpidem and placebo. In addition, the studies only included
adult individuals with insomnia disorder and excluded
patients with important comorbidities. Therefore, the results
of the present meta-analysis might not apply to all patients.
Finally, the tools to assess sleep parameters were hetero-
geneous. Most trials provided both subjective and objective
outcome measures, as shown in ►Table 1. Nonetheless, in
most cases, polysomnography was only available for the
primary outcomes, and additional outcomes were mainly
derived from electronic sleep diary entries made by patients.

DORAs for the treatment of insomnia

Rocha et al.

Although these are important tools and are widely used by
the scientiﬁc community, concerns regarding patient-related
outcomes must be taken into consideration, especially be-
cause there is a high degree of variability and uncertainty in
subjective patient evaluations of sleep.28

Despite the known limitations, the present study has
several strengths. It is the ﬁrst to include two recently
published trials on daridorexant,22 the newest drug in this
class, providing data from more than 1,800 patients. More-
over, the studies referenced in this meta-analysis were found
to be of high quality, with 8 of 9 studies showing a low risk of
bias.

In conclusion, our results suggest that DORAs are a safe
class of drugs associated with greater efﬁcacy when com-
pared with placebo in the treatment of insomnia, which is a
complex sleep-wake disorder. The pharmacological treat-
ment for insomnia is challenging, and it must address several
aspects of the disease, including sleep variables and next-day
functioning. When using a DORA, dosing may play an impor-
tant role in sleep maintenance, and higher doses correlate
with longer TSTs for each individual drug. Additional trials
comparing two or more DORAs are needed.
