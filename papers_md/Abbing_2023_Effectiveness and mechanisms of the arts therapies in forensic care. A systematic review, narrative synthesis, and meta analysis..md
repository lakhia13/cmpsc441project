Introduction: Mental health care provided to offenders with psychiatric problems
in forensic settings mainly consists of verbal oriented treatments. In addition,
experience-based therapies are used such as (creative) arts therapies: (visual) art
therapy, music therapy, drama therapy and dance (movement) therapy. There are
indications for effectiveness of arts therapies, but a systematic overview of effect
studies of all arts therapies in forensic care is lacking.

Methods: First, we performed a systematic review. Second, Thematic Analysis was
used to synthesize the qualitative narrative results and deﬁne the hypothesized
mechanisms of change. Third, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the
effects of arts therapies in reducing psychosocial problems of offenders. Twenty-
three studies were included in the review. Quality and risk of bias was assessed
using EPHPP (Effective Public Health Practice Project).

Results: The included studies were heterogeneous in type of outcome measures
and intervention characteristics. Synthesis of mechanisms of change involved
in the methodical use of the arts in arts therapies resulted in a description of
regulatory processes which are stimulated in arts therapies: perceptive awareness
(interoceptive and exteroceptive), the regulation of emotions, stress, impulses,
cognitions, social regulation, and self-expression. These processes play a role
in developing prevention, coping and self-management skills. Eighteen studies
were included in the meta-analyses (11 RCTs/CCTs; 7 pre-post studies). The
meta-analyses indicated signiﬁcant effects on both risk factors (psychiatric
symptoms and addiction) and protective factors for criminal behavior (social
functioning and psychological functioning). Effects on criminal and/or antisocial
behavior were not signiﬁcant, but this outcome measure was scarcely used among
the studies.

Discussion: The analyses in this study should be considered explorative. More
research is needed to gain more solid conclusions about effectiveness and
mechanisms of change of arts therapies in forensic institutions. However, the
results of this ﬁrst systematic review, synthesis of mechanisms and meta-analysis
in this ﬁeld are promising and show effects of arts therapies on risk and protective
factors in individuals in forensic institutions.

1. Introduction

Mental illness plays a role in criminal behavior; many detainees
in forensic institutions struggle with a combination of personality
problems, aggressive and disruptive behavior, psychosis, mild
intellectual disabilities and/or a traumatic history and these
problems increase the risk of recidivism (1). Detained individuals
with mental health problems often have more than one disorder
their behavior and
which for some individuals may impact
increase their risk of re-oﬀending. Many of these individuals
have committed violent crimes and pose an increased risk of
danger to society when left untreated. Treatment is provided
this review,
in several correctional settings. For purposes of
correctional settings include forensic institutions and correctional
settings where forensic mental health care is provided for detained
individuals. Forensic care focuses on understanding and treating
mental disorders in oﬀenders and is provided in settings where the
individual is involuntary detained. The aim of forensic care is to
treat and rehabilitate the patient and to assess risk of recidivism
and protect society (2–4). Long-term treatment is often needed,
consisting of forensic mental health care and addiction care.

Mental health care in forensic institutions and correctional
settings mainly consists of verbal treatments. For various reasons,
this speciﬁc population may also need treatment interventions
that make use of behavioral and experience-oriented techniques
(5–8). One of the reasons is that it can be diﬃcult for oﬀenders
with mental health problems to gain insight into own behavioral
patterns and possible underlying causes when it comes to complex
interactions. Other ways than verbal oriented interventions should
then be used to help people initiate change, especially when it
comes to long-established response patterns and when the range of
coping skills needs to be broadened. Then, experiential approaches,
including arts therapies, can be considered, which are characterized
by learning through action-based experiences and focusing on the
“here and now”, guided by a therapist (9). (Creative) arts therapies
can oﬀer oﬀenders an experiential insight into their own behavior
and how to change it. Arts therapies may promote motivation for
treatment and may therefore enhance protective factors against
future recidivism (10).

The arts therapies deployed in forensic care are: visual arts
therapy (from this point we refer to this modality as “art
therapy”), music therapy, drama therapy and dance (movement)
therapy. These forms of therapy consist of the psychotherapeutic
use of the diﬀerent art modalities (11–15): visual art, music,
play, roleplay, performance, improvisation, dance and movement.
sensory, perceptual, and
Interventions provide kinaesthetic,
symbolic opportunities to invite alternative modes of receptive and
expressive communication.

Arts therapies have been used in forensic institutions since
the 1950s. The importance of these therapies in forensic and
correctional settings is recognized by care providers, oﬀenders
with psychiatric problems and policymakers (16–18). With the
use of arts therapies interventions, behavioral patterns, limitations
and possibilities of patients can become visible and therapy can
focus on changes in thinking, feeling and acting. The experience-
and action-oriented nature of these interventions makes the arts
therapies suitable for descriptive observations that add to the

general diagnostics in the forensic setting [e.g., (19, 20)] and for
working on treatment goals such as tension regulation, improving
impulse control, aggression regulation, developing empathy and
improving social interaction. Other options are exploring one’s own
identity and improving the often negative self-image (21). Because
of the non-verbal character, the patient does not have to speak
about feelings and thoughts when they are still too threatening.
Even with a low level of intellectual functioning and problems in
verbal communication, the arts therapies can oﬀer an experiential
entrance to explore thoughts and feelings (22). Furthermore, arts
therapies can oﬀer the opportunity to mentally escape from the
restrictive environment for a while and it can provide space for the
(controlled) expression of emotions, whereby the intensity of the
emotions (such as aggression) can be calmed down (21). The arts
therapies can also have a training-oriented character, whereby new
behavior can be practiced, which is a prerequisite for breaking the
crime chain (23, 24).

Although arts therapies are widely used in forensic care, there is
still little insight into the eﬀectiveness and associated mechanisms
of change of the arts therapies in forensic psychiatry because of
the scarce research on this topic. Only three systematic reviews on
this topic have been performed that are related to this topic, but
two of these reviews were aimed at psychological therapies and
not exclusively on arts therapies (25, 26) and one concerned solely
music therapy (27). Despite several methodological shortcomings
of the included studies in these reviews, the conclusions were
that psychological (arts) interventions can have positive eﬀects in
prisons or forensic care. Main eﬀects were improved mental health
and better coping with emotions and feelings. It was indicated
that the outcomes could be linked to better anger management
and improved empathy,
important outcomes for the forensic
setting. Also, increasing self-conﬁdence and social functioning were
mentioned as eﬀects of music therapy. From these reviews can
be concluded that there are indications for eﬀectiveness of arts
therapies, but a systematic overview of eﬀect studies of all arts
therapies in forensic care is lacking.

To gain insight in the eﬀectiveness of arts therapies in forensic
institutions we focused on the following research questions: And
what are the hypothesized mechanisms of change of the arts
therapies in forensic care? And are arts therapies eﬀective in
reducing psychosocial problems of detained adults in forensic
institutions? Are these eﬀective in terms of protective or
risk factors?

2. Methods

2.1. Protocol and registration

The review protocol for this systematic review and meta-
analysis was registered at Prospero, number CRD42020217884
(28). The recommendations of
the Cochrane Collaboration
were followed, concerning study identiﬁcation, selection, data
extraction, quality appraisal and data analysis (29). The PRISMA
Guidelines were used for reporting (30) and PRISMA Checklist was
used (Supplementary material 8).

2.2. Search strategy

2.5. Data collection process

Multiple systematic searches were performed with the help of
a medical information specialist (TP) from inception until June
2020 in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL plus with
full text (EBSCO), APA PsycInfo (EBSCO), Web of Science Core
Collection and EMBASE (OVID). The following terms were used
(including synonyms and closely related words) as index terms or
free-text words to represent the following concepts: arts therapies
(art therapy, music therapy, drama therapy, and dance movement
therapy) AND forensic OR correctional setting AND eﬀect study.
No additional ﬁlters were used. The full searches are available in
the appendices (Supplementary material 1). Per database all results
were exported into a single ﬁle. Next, all ﬁles were merged and de-
duplicated using EndNote. The bibliographies of included studies
were hand searched for further relevant studies. Bibliographies of
reviews on arts therapies in forensic care were hand searched as
well to identify other relevant studies.

2.3. Study selection

Our research design was restricted to peer reviewed published
eﬀect studies with at
least pre and post-test. Included were
Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), Controlled Clinical Trials
(CCTs), case control studies, cohort studies and multiple case
studies, published in English, Dutch or German language, from
1980 until June 2020. The types of participants and setting were
restricted to detained individuals with mental health problems in
a correctional setting or a forensic institution, with or without
mental health services, aged 18–65 years, from any gender or
ethnicity. The studies investigated arts therapies: art therapy, music
therapy, drama therapy and dance movement therapy, provided by
an arts therapist, to individuals or groups with no limitations on
duration or number of sessions. Interventions without a trained
arts therapist were excluded. A trained arts therapist has received
a bachelor of master educational program in the ﬁeld of one of
the arts therapies. We included studies with the following types
of comparison: (1) Arts therapies vs. no treatment/waiting list,
(2) Arts therapies vs. inactive control, (3) Arts therapies vs. active
control (e.g., CBT), (4) No control. The type of outcome measures
were restricted to quantitative measures of psychosocial outcomes.

The data collection process was performed by four researchers
(AA, SH, RK, VB) who separately extracted the data from
standard extraction sheet
a
included publications using
(Supplementary material 2). Coding was replicated by one of
the researchers (SN).

2.6. Quality assessment

The Quality Assessment tool for Quantitative studies (31) was
used for assessing study quality and risk of bias. To reach a
conclusion, Quality Assessment Tool uses a number of factors along
with opinions of select experts who meet pre-determined criteria.
Once the assessment is fulﬁlled, each examined practice receives
a mark ranging between “strong,” “moderate,” and “weak” in eight
categories: Study design, Analysis, Withdrawals and dropouts, Data
collection practices, Selection bias, Invention integrity, Blinding as
part of a controlled trial, and Confounders.

2.7. Coding

Outcome measures of

the various studies were clustered
according to a predetermined set of clusters, based on the Risk-
Needs-Responsivity model (32), the Good Lives Model (33), and
the HKT- R (34). Clustering was made based on risk factors and
protective factors.

2.4. Selection process

2.8. Analyses

2.8.1. Narrative synthesis

Duplicate studies were removed and the references were
imputed in Rayyan (www.Rayyan.QCRI.org). Three researchers
independently performed study selection and recorded their
decisions in Rayyan QCRI in two separate rounds: (1) screening
the titles and abstracts of the included titles and (2) subsequently
reading and evaluating the full texts of the included articles. The
researchers were blinded for decisions of other reviewers. Conﬂicts
between scores of reviewers were resolved via discussion or by
consulting a fourth reviewer.

A narrative synthesis of the arts therapies interventions and
proposed mechanisms of change was made. In this synthesis,
a mechanism of change was deﬁned as the (components of)
the process by which an eﬀect seems to be produced (9). Parts
of the text were selected in which the authors interpret the
results of their study by means of supposed mechanisms. These
texts were summarized and clustered per modality. Based on
Thematic Analysis (35), the hypothesized mechanisms of change
were clustered for arts therapies in total.

2.8.2. Meta-analysis
2.8.2.1. Data RCT design

3.2. Study characteristics

First all records with design RCT or CCT were selected.
The standardized mean diﬀerence (36) eﬀect size (“SMD”) and
variance of the eﬀect size were computed using the escalc function
from the metafor package (37) and these variables were added to
the data.

The 23 included eﬀect studies on arts therapies in forensic care
included 1,118 oﬀenders in total with sample sizes ranging from 7
to 200. An overview is presented in Table 1, outcomes from studies
are reported in Supplementary material 2.

2.8.2.2. Data pre-post design

First all records with pre-post design were selected. The
correlation (r) between the two measurements was never reported.
The value of r = 0.5 was therefore used as a reasonable
approximation. Next, based on the means and SD’s of
the
experimental group at T1 and T2 and the correlation between
them, an eﬀect size (“SMCC”) and variance of the eﬀect size were
computed using the escalc function from the metafor package (37).
The “SMCC” is the standardized mean change using change score
standardization (38).

In both datasets, all eﬀects were coded such that a positive
eﬀect size implies an eﬀect in accordance with the expected eﬀect
of the intervention.

2.8.2.3. Meta-analysis on the two datasets

Meta-analyses with random eﬀects using metafor package
were run on these two datasets. First, on the total sample
and subsequently with moderators intervention type, and setting
[forensic (psychiatric) care and forensic/correctional] to determine
whether or not it makes a diﬀerence which form of arts therapies
is deployed and in which setting. IQ was included in data-
extraction. Additional meta-analyses with random eﬀects were run
for risk factors and protective factors separately, followed by meta-
analyses of each category of risk and protective factors separately.
For each analysis, heterogeneity was explored by calculating
the I2 statistics. Thresholds for the interpretation of I2 can be
misleading, since the importance of inconsistency depends on
several factors. A rough guide to interpretation is as follows: 0–
40%: might not be important; 30–60%: may represent moderate
heterogeneity; 50–90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;
75–100%: considerable heterogeneity (29).

Analysis scripts are included as Supplementary materials 3, 4.

3. Results

3.1. Study selection

3.2.1. Art therapy

The seven included studies were three RCTs (39–41), two
studies on one CCT (42, 43), and two pre-post designs (44, 45) with
29–158 participants (414 in total). Four studies concerned male and
female prisoners, three studies only male prisoners. Four studies
took part in forensic care settings and, three studies included
correctional settings,
involving inmates without a psychiatric
diagnosis but with psychological problems.

3.2.2. Music therapy

Ten studies were included: two RCTs, one CCT and seven pre-
post designs without a control group, with 11–200 participants
(561 in total). Participants were mostly male inmates with
various psychiatric problems. Seven studies concerned a forensic
care setting and three studies took place in a forensic, non-
psychiatric setting.

3.2.3. Drama therapy

Four studies were included: one CCT and three studies with
a single group pre-post design with a range of 7–66 participants
(104 in total). Two studies concerned a forensic care setting and
two a forensic/correctional setting with solely males. Psychiatric
problems were personality disorders (antisocial, bipolar, and
narcissistic) and substance abuse/addiction.

3.2.4. Dance movement therapy

One study was included, with a CCT design and 47 male prison

inmates (46).

3.2.5. Combination of arts therapies

One RCT pilot study (47) with 10 male oﬀenders with cluster B

personality disorders in a forensic care setting.

The search resulted in 1,423 unique citations (see Figure 1). The
search yielded seven systematic reviews. Screening of the titles of
the reference lists of these reviews resulted in 11 extra citations
that were eligible for further screening. Based on title and abstract,
1,365 citations were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The 69 remaining full-text original research articles
were screened for eligibility. Forty-six articles were excluded. See
Supplementary material 5 for references and reasons to exclude
studies and outcomes. Twenty-three studies were included in
the review.

3.3. Methodological quality of the studies

Of

the 23 studies, 5 studies had strong methodological
quality, seven medium quality and 11 weak quality (Table 1).
Key limitations included designs with the lack of a control
condition; the use of self-developed measurement instruments
and/or poor psychometric quality; small study populations also
often heterogeneous in nature; a relatively high dropout rate during
the studies. Details of the quality assessment can be found in
Supplementary material 6.

in a row (46). Interventions concerned both group therapy
and individual therapy. Art therapy interventions were mostly
based on a directive approach with structured art exercises
guided by the art
therapist. Music therapy mostly involved
active music therapy in a group setting, using musical rhythms,
singing, song writing, and improvisation. Two studies involved

3.4.2. Hypothesized mechanisms of change
3.4.2.1. Art therapy

Several supposed mechanisms of change were described. First,
art therapy is thought to create the possibility to express emotions,
distress, impulses, and individual identity [(39–41, 44, 45)]. In
this regard, the artistic process could be an acceptable emotional
escape [(39, 40, 44, 45)]. The process of creative expression was
also seen as an appropriate mean of self-expression, a status
builder and a process to earn respect and friendship [(42, 43, 45)].
Second, elements in the art making process (using more space,
detail, and compositional integration) may stimulate awareness of
surroundings and how clients relate to their surroundings. This
may lead to an improved attitude and increased acceptance of

each other and the environment, which may result in improved
interaction with peers and staﬀ [(40, 42–44)]. Third, the art
making process itself had a regulatory and positive eﬀect on mood.
Participants enjoyed the art making process and were amazed
at their end results, which may have improved their self esteem
(39, 41–45). Fourth, the art making process is self-directing and
undisturbed, which may allow prisoners to regain their sense of
self-control (41). Fifth, the artwork may shed light on their inner
world in a concrete way, which could therefore be acknowledged
and symbolically embodied in artwork [(40, 41)]. In this way,
negative feelings can be transformed into a motivating force,
regain courage and conﬁdence (41). In group discussions, the
artwork served as a useful mean for reﬂection [(40, 41)], e.g., on
anxious feelings toward life after release (41) or on life events
(40). The (group) discussion on artwork stimulated prisoners
to discover and formulate insights in cognitions and behavior;
the therapist guided this process toward helpful cognitions and
behavior. Also, working together artistically in a group created a
sense of belonging to the group, stimulated supportive interactions
and stimulated social acceptance. At last, the group art activities
would help to increase clients’ abilities to cooperate and solve
problems (44).

3.4.2.2. Music therapy

Several mechanisms of change were described for music
therapy. First, music came forward as calming the stress response,
which is explained by the incorporation of abdominal breathing
techniques, rhythmical entrainment, bilateral movement patterns
in music with body percussion, and musical attention control
training (53). Furthermore, alternation of tension and relaxation
through variously implementing strong and weak drumming and
fast and slow tempos may allow exploration of tension, negative
emotions and impulsiveness in a positive way (51). Second, music
supported to express, identify, and explore emotions in a positive
way during music making in which emotional and physiological
responses could be elicited and thereby be a mean to identify,
explore and eventually inﬂuence emotional experiences. This is
could lead the way toward insight, improving mood, self-awareness,
and (self-) acceptance (48, 49, 54). Third, structured music making
or listening can optimize attention processes and this is a proposed
mechanism toward inducing symptom reduction. Fourth, music
therapy oﬀered practice for using other coping skills and learning
impulse regulation skills (50). Also, music can support social
processes, by making music in a group which necessitates working
together and can strengthen relationships. In individual expression,
music could stimulate feelings of autonomy (52, 61).

3.4.2.3. Drama therapy

Dramatherapy oﬀered the opportunity to experiment, to ﬁnd
out more about a client’s feelings and thoughts through play.
The proposed mechanism of role-play and mirroring in drama
therapy lies in self-reﬂection and thereby increasing awareness
of problematic behaviors, prevention of this behavior, promoting
ability to empathize and developing solution skills (58), which may
increase self-esteem and improve relational attitudes. Roleplay also
provided understanding and insight by dramatizing past, present,
life situations and roles (59). Drama therapeutic techniques like

enactment, playing multiple parts of the self, role reversal, doubling,
soliloquy, and future projection (62–64) oﬀered preparation for
situations, in prison and when released (59). These drama roles
assist behavior change and self-expression.

3.4.2.4. Dance movement therapy

DMT uses a wide range of movement-oriented interventions.
In the included study, the mechanism of constant changing roles
of the inmate (perpetrator vs. victim) to reactivate situations
where violent behavior was executed/encountered. The dance-
based Aikido stick ﬁghting techniques combined with role play
and body psychotherapeutic interventions sensitized inmates to
perceive psychosomatic changes of self and others. The practicing
of alternative behaviors helped to develop constructive handling of
emotions and aggression, and improved social skills and empathy.

3.4.2.5. Combination of arts therapies

Van den Broek et al. (47) described the experiential character
and the potential of the arts therapies to trigger emotional states
and spontaneity through the use of artistic media and experiential
exercises. Evoking emotional states can help oﬀenders who are
emotionally detached to open up for therapeutic processes (47).

are described to be working through a number of regulatory
processes, shaped through the speciﬁc creative means of the
arts therapy. These regulatory processes take place on a base
of perceptive awareness, which includes both interoceptive and
exteroceptive awareness. The regulatory processes include: -
stress regulation (calming and relaxation); - impulse regulation
(e.g., handling aggression); - emotion regulation (e.g., mood
improvement, handling negative emotions, and recognition); -
cognitive regulation (mindful attention, stimulating reﬂection,
and helpful cognitions); - social regulation (stimulation of social
attunement, working together, acceptance, and empathy) and
the process of self-expression. Based on this layer of awareness
and regulation, behavior change could be focused on developing
prevention skills, social and coping skills, and improved self-
identity, empowerment,

For meta-analysis, ﬁve studies were excluded. Gussak (45) was
excluded because the study used the same data as Gussak (39). The
studies by Gussak (43), Van den Broek et al. (47), Gold et al. (56),
and Keulen-de Vos et al. (57) were excluded because these studies
did not meet the criteria for an eﬀect study with pre-and-post

3.5.1. Results meta analysis RCT/CCT designs

There were 11 studies included in the meta-analysis, which
accounted for 95 outcomes/records in this data set with non-
missing eﬀect sizes (see Table 2a). The number of eﬀect sizes
within each study ran from 0 to 25. Excluded from the analysis
were measures that were not validated, observer measures and
re-used data.

The ﬁrst analyses were done on the complete sample. First
without moderators and in addition, intervention type and setting
(forensic-psychiatric and forensic) were separately included as
moderators. On the complete sample, the mixed-eﬀects model
(k = 95), with a moderate between-study heterogeneity [Q(df=94)
= 165.397, p < 0.001, I2 = 46.926%], showed signiﬁcant eﬀects
[b = 0.209, 95%CI (0.127–0.290), SE = 0.042, p < 0.001]. The
moderator analyses on type of arts therapies and settings resulted
in a mixed-eﬀects model (k = 95), with a moderate between-study

and /correctional settings [b = 0.122, 95% CI (0.007, 0.238), SE =
0.059, p = 0.038].

Next, a random eﬀects meta-analysis (k = 94) with moderators
was examined. The mixed-eﬀects model showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on risk factors [b = 0.185, 95% CI (0.072, 0.297), SE = 0.057, p <
0.01] and on protective factors as well [b = 0.235, 95% CI (0.114,
0.357), SE = 0.062, p < 0.001]. The between-study heterogeneity
= 165.062, p < 0.001, I2 = 47.619%].
was moderate [Q(df=92)
Subsequently, analyses were done for each category of the risk and
protective factors separately. As IQ measures were present in only
one of the studies (52), we could not use this as a factor in the
meta analysis.

3.5.1.1. Criminal/antisocial

A multilevel, random-eﬀects meta-analysis (k = 11) indicated a
non-signiﬁcant and small negative experimental eﬀect on antisocial
behavior [b = −0.052, 95% CI (−0.255, 0.151), SE = 0.104, p =
0.615]. The between-study heterogeneity was moderate [Q(df=10)
= 16.509, p = 0.086; I2 = 40.77%]. Based on visual inspection
there was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (Figure 2). Egger’s
test gave z = −1.3 (p = 0.192), which indicated no funnel
plot asymmetry.

3.5.1.2. Psychiatric symptoms

The multilevel random-eﬀects meta-analysis (k = 32) indicated
an overall signiﬁcant eﬀect on psychiatric symptoms [b = 0.268,
95% CI (0.130, 0.406), SE = 0.070, p < 0.001]. The between-study

Subsequently, analyses were done for each category of the risk

therapy: - perceptive awareness (intero- and exteroception); -
emotion regulation; - stress regulation; - impulse regulation;
- cognitive regulation; - social regulation; - self-expression; -
behavior regulation; and - self management. Improvement of
these regulatory processes through arts therapies may lead to
improvements of protective factors such as psychological and
social functioning, and may possibly (more indirectly) contribute
to decrease of risk factors,
such as, psychiatric symptoms
and addiction. These changes may contribute to lowering
the risk of re-oﬀending, which needs to be investigated in
future studies.

The results of the meta-analysis based on 18 included studies
showed signiﬁcant eﬀects of the arts therapies on risk factors as well
as protective factors. Of the controlled studies, signiﬁcant outcomes
were shown on psychiatric symptoms, social functioning and
psychological functioning, but not on criminal/antisocial behavior,
the pre-post studies, signiﬁcant
due to insuﬃcient data. Of
outcomes were shown on addiction, psychiatric symptoms, social
functioning and psychological
functioning. In the RCT/CCT
studies, art
therapy and music therapy showed signiﬁcant
outcomes. Drama therapy and dance movement therapy both
concerned only one study, so no conclusions can be drawn for these
intervention types. Of pre-post designs, art therapy, music therapy
and drama therapy studies were included and all intervention
types indicated signiﬁcant outcomes. Art therapy concerned only
one study, so no conclusion can be drawn for this intervention
type. All setting types showed signiﬁcant improvements as well,
indicating that arts therapies are eﬀective in forensic care as well
as in correctional settings.

The relationship between the hypothesized mechanisms and
the eﬀects found in the meta-analyses can be illustrated with some
examples. The arts therapies use art, music, dance or drama to
create experiences. Many of the interventions found in the included
studies are aimed at experiencing the self, and then also in relation
to others. The self can be seen as a central aspect of the individual
that plays a role in motivation, cognition, aﬀect and emotion
identity (66). Through interoception—the process

of sensing bodily signals—social connection is targeted (67).
Improving interoceptive abilities through arts therapies may be
key for improving social connection. The meta-analyses also show
that arts therapies are eﬀective in improving social functioning.
Emotion regulation is targeted as well. By exploring emotions,
learning to feel and learning to correctly label these feelings
through experiences in the arts, interoception and introspection are
practiced. Arts therapies emphasize guiding the patient’s attention
to interoceptive, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive experience. This
kind of inner attention, in addition to imagery can lead to the
resolution of symptoms of chronic and traumatic stress (68). Using
these sensations might be an eﬀective therapeutic tool. A higher
interoceptive accuracy and awareness might lead to improved
impulse control. Also in this aspect, the meta-analyses show that the
art therapies have eﬀect. This is particularly relevant for the forensic
setting, as impulse control is an important predictor of criminal and
antisocial behavior [e.g., (69)].

A strength of this study is that this is the ﬁrst in this ﬁeld to
provide an overview of studies, a narrative synthesis of mechanisms
of change as well as a meta-analysis of results of the arts therapies
in forensic care. This study used a thoroughly systematic approach
following strict criteria. With this study we contribute to the
knowledge base of arts therapies in forensic care. We present
an overarching framework of regulatory processes based on the
narrative synthesis of mechanisms.

This study has also some limitations to consider. First, only
a limited number of the studies included in this review were of
strong methodological quality. This is often the conclusion of
literature reviews concerning psychological interventions, because
assessment tools have not been primarily developed for studies of
these types of interventions where blinding is not possible [e.g.,
(70)]. A second limitation is that some of the included studies
report a relatively high dropout rate. This might be caused by the
nature of the setting (when duration of stay does not depend on
the course of therapy, but on other matters) and characteristics
of the population; it concerns involuntary detained individuals
with psychiatric problems for whom motivation and adherence to
treatment is not naturally. A third limitation is that the studies are
very heterogeneous in type of outcome measures and intervention
characteristics. Furthermore, in a few cases, there were only two
studies in the analysis. These analyses should therefore be seen
as exploratory, as a ﬁrst step. Therefore, we ﬁrst investigated the
total set of outcomes and the involved moderators, followed by
exploratory analyses of clusters of outcomes. Hence, we cannot
make strong statements about the eﬀects. However, results are
visible on both protective and risk factors. Also, IQ might be an
important factor given the characteristics of the forensic population
in general. IQ measures were only present in one of the studies and
therefore IQ was not part of the meta-analysis. A last limitation is
that, based on the present review/meta-analysis, no conclusions on
the eﬀectiveness of arts therapies on addiction in forensic care could
be drawn because of lack of studies. However, there are publications
on arts therapies therapy for addiction problems [e.g., (71–74)], but
these studies concern no forensic setting or are not eﬀect studies.

therapeutic interventions in forensic care. This study contributes
to these priorities and provides an impetus for further elaboration
and deepening. An example of a potential working mechanism
of arts therapies is the better regulation of emotions. As a result,
individuals learn to better manage their anger, which reduces the
risk of recidivism and leads to recovery from psychiatric problems.
For a targeted and relevant use of arts therapies for the purposes of
forensic treatment, it is important to properly recognize what works
and how it works.

Because there are no other reviews or meta-analyses in this
particular area our results are a ﬁrst step in gaining insight in
recent evidence-based knowledge about eﬀects and mechanisms in
forensic care. Our ﬁndings are in line with a previous practice-
based study (24) which investigated arts therapies in the Dutch
forensic psychiatric practice focusing speciﬁcally on aggression
problems. In this study the diﬀerent regulatory processes that
were found in the present study can be recognized. This study
mapped out which indications, objectives,
interventions and
(observed) eﬀects were mentioned by the diﬀerent arts therapists
in forensic psychiatry. It pointed out diﬀerent indications, with
an overlap between the diﬀerent arts therapies. For example,
drama therapy is aiming at aggression regulation based on
the mechanism to trigger responses,
learning self-control and
distancing oneself by ﬁctional roles and scenes. Music therapy
was indicated to develop recognition of emotions using the
mechanism of self-expression through music. Art therapy was
aimed at gaining insight in thoughts, beliefs, feelings, behavior
and problems using the mechanism of imaging. Dance therapy
was also aimed at anger regulation through body and movement
expression, using controlled force to transform destructive into
constructive behavior.

Another consideration is that about 40% of the people in
the criminal justice system have a mild to borderline intellectual
disability and an estimate of 20% has MID (75, 76). This is more
than twice as much as in the general population. With the right
treatment and guidance, the chance of recurrence of criminal
behavior is reduced. Because of their experiential,
less verbal
approach, arts therapies may be relevant for this target group.
However, IQ measures were present in only one of the studies (52).
It is recommended to describe this in future studies.

Future research should examine eﬀects of the arts therapies
more sound using strong research designs, adequate sample
sizes and strict quality criteria. Only with studies with a strong
rigor there can be built on an evidence base for the arts
therapies. Furthermore, mechanisms of change should be clearly
deﬁned as the deﬁnition varies. Also, mechanisms are often only
implicitly mentioned. For building a theory base mechanisms of
change should be described and studied more speciﬁcally. The
articulated central regulatory processes can be a helpful guideline
in developing and underpinning practice-based interventions in
clinical practice and as a framework for future research. We
recommend practitioners and researchers to use this overarching
framework as a shared language for communication and building a
shared knowledge base.

A recent report (23) describes two priorities for future
research for arts therapies in forensic psychiatry: formulating
mechanisms of change of arts therapies and describing art

In conclusion, the analyses in this study should be considered
exploratory. More research is needed to gain more solid
the eﬀectiveness and mechanisms of arts
