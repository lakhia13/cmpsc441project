Bereaved children

Karen Schultz, MD, CCFP

OBJECTIVE To describe the unique aspects of childhood grief. To provide a framework for family
physicians to use in assisting children to grieve.
QUALITY OF EVIDENCE A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 1999 using the key words children,
childhood, grief, mourning, and bereavement revealed mainly expert opinion articles, some non-
randomized observational studies, and retrospective case-control studies.
MAIN MESSAGE Although children are influenced by similar factors and need to work through the
same tasks of grief as adults, their unique psychological defences and evolving cognitive and emotional
development make their grieving different from adults'. Understanding these unique childhood
features will allow family physicians to more effectively help children through the tasks of
acknowledging a death, working through the pain of that death, and accommodating it.
CONCLUSIONS With a framework for grief counseling that incorporates unique features of children's
mourning, family physicians will be in a better position to assist their young bereaved patients.

OBJECTIF Decrire les aspects particuliers du deuil chez l'enfant. Procurer aux medecins de famille des
parametres a utiliser pour assister les enfants dans leur deuil.
QUALITE DES DONNEES Une recension dans MEDLINE, couvrant de 1996 'a 1999 et effectuee 'a l'aide
des mots cles en anglais pour enfant, enfance, deuil, affliction et d'autres synonymes, a fait ressortir
principalement des articles sur l'opinion d'experts, certaines etudes d'observation non aleatoires et des
etudes retrospectives avec cas temoins.
PRINCIPAL MESSAGE Si les enfants sont influences par des facteurs semblables et doivent surmonter
les memes etapes dans le deuil que les adultes, leurs mecanismes particuliers de defense psycholo-
gique, et leur developpement cognitif et emotionnel en evolution les distinguent des adultes dans ce
processus. La comprehension de ces caracteristiques uniques 'a l'enfance permet aux medecins de
famille d'aider plus efficacement les enfants 'a passer 'a travers les etapes de la prise de conscience de la
mort et de la souffrance qu'elle cause, et de s'y adapter.
CONCLUSIONS Grace 'a des parametres de counseling des personnes affligees qui tiennent compte
des caracteristiques uniques chez l'enfant dans le deuil, les medecins de famille sont mieux places pour
aider leurs jeunes patients affliges.

"Our job is not to protect children from feeling but to help
them bear it."'

-M. Adams-Greenley and R. T. Moynihan Sr
* hree years ago a young woman in my prac-
tice died suddenly, leaving her husband
and two children aged 7 and 4. The differ-
ences between how the father and children
express their grief have been striking. Childhood
bereavement is common. United States statistics
reveal 5% of children will lose a parent by age 16 (no
equivalent Canadian statistics are available).2
Understanding childhood mourning is, therefore, rele-
vant to family physicians to help not only bereaved
children but also their concerned relatives.

This article provides information about childhood
bereavement, particularly as it relates to the death of
a parent. Tasks of grieving and factors influencing
the expression of grief are outlined and principles of
grief counseling examined. Ways to assist bereaved
children through these tasks of grieving are offered.
A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 1999 using the key
words children, childhood, -grief, mourning, and
bereavement shows much of grief literature to be expert
opinion,7132 non-randomized observational studies,"S'6 or
retrospective case-control studies.'7'18 Although evidence
from such studies is not as scientifically rigorous as evi-
dence from other areas of research, numerous experts
appear to agree on the basic features of children's grief.

Factors influencing expression of grief
Children need to work through the same tasks of grief
as adults (Table 1).3-5 Several factors (Fgre 1)4681719
influence expression of grief as children and adults alike
work through these tasks. Unique features, including
psychological defences and intellectual (cognitive) and
emotional development, affect children's expression of
grief. Their preferred psychological defence mecha-
nisms, including regression, denial, fantasy, and self-lim-
ited exposure to overwhelming emotions, can make
their grieving seem very different from adults'.5 Their
cognitive and emotional development, as outlined by
Jean Piaget, also affects how they express grief
(Table2117,)). Understanding these defences and devel-
opmental steps will help physicians understand the fears
of death children have and the behaviours they exhibit

Principles of grief counseling
Several general principles of grief counseling apply to
both adults and children.4 These include being aware of

your own grief issues as a counselor, being able to inter-
pret the range of normal grief behaviours (Table 1),
allowing for individual differences in behaviour and cop-
ing strategies, and being aware of the need for people to
go over issues repeatedly both to acknowledge the
death and to accommodate the cyclical nature of grief.
For children, however, there are two additional
principles: the need to support surviving parents,"'
and the need to reinterpret the death as their cognitive
understanding of death evolves.3'5"4 Given the intermit-
tent and hence prolonged nature of children's grief
and the fact that each new developmental step
requires children to reinterpret the death, it is ideal if
parents can support their children's bereavement.
Supporting and educating grieving parents, there-
fore, provides care not only for the adults, but also
indirectly for their children. Grieving parents worry
about how their children will survive the death of
someone close to them. Reassurance that it is proba-
bly not the loss per se that can lead to subsequent
pathological reactions (ie, adult depression) but the
disruption that follows such a loss"'8 is helpful. This
underscores the importance of helping surviving par-
ents minimize disruption by providing an environ-
ment in which children's expression (whether in
words or actions) of grief is accepted and by maintain-
ing consistency and stability in routine and discipline.1
It is also important to promote stability in other
areas of children's lives.'0 Although parents often have
a strong desire to move and start afresh after a death,
it is better, if at all possible, to stay put and maintain
children's schools, club activities, and friends.

Bereaved children

Given that grief is cyclical, families need ongoing
opportunities to discuss their grief; parents should be
encouraged to do this with their children. Much of
grief work is repetition. Certain anniversaries are
commonly associated with accentuation of grief:
1 month after the death when outside support for the
family starts to wane, 3 months, the first anniversary
of the death, holidays, birthdays, wedding anniver-
saries, and Mother's and Father's days. Family physi-
cians should consider contacting families to see
how they are coping at these times. These are also
opportune moments for families to remember the
deceased, by looking at photo albums, watching fami-
ly videos, or going to the cemetery.4 Making such
memory sessions part of family rituals can ensure
that the loss is not ignored in the day-to-day bustle of
life. Memory sessions give children natural opportu-
nities to reinterpret the loss in the light of new cogni-
tive understandings as they age.

With these principles family physicians can help
bereaved children through the tasks of acknowledg-
ing the death, working through the emotions, and
accommodating the death.

Ackmowledging death
Encouraging acknowledgment of death involves talk-
ing about the circumstances around a death. For older
children this could mean providing an opportunity to
talk about death, the deceased, the funeral, and their
relationship with the deceased.4 During these ses-
sions (and there could well be more than one), it is
important to help the child paint a complete picture of
; what
the deceased: "what do you miss about
don't you miss; what was good about your relationship
; what was difficult?" Without this com-
with
plete picture, certain emotions, if present, become dif-
ficult to express (for example, idealizing the deceased
can block anger; seeing only negative aspects of the
deceased can block sadness).4

Younger children might need to understand death
before they can acknowledge it. Young children ask
common questions about death.10 These include wanti-
ng to know what dead is, how the person died, what has
happened to them, and about their own security-wili
they die and who is going to take care of them? They
need concrete answers to these questions, such as
"Dead means not being able to see or hear or feel."10'11

Ambiguous language used to gentle the blow confuses
children (Table 3). It is best not to use euphemisms for
death, such as "a long sleep" and "on a trip," which feed
into their misconceptions about death."1"4 Also helpful
for children in acknowledging a death is being part of
the funeral." Funerals help to move the deceased to a
position of memory and are a time when bereaved peo-
ple are supported in their grief. Most children, after
being told what to expect, will benefit from this experi-
ence. They should know they have the option to leave if
a funeral becomes overwhelming for them.

younger children and those artistically inclined, creating
pictures, memory books, or memory boxes'5 can help.
Teenagers, for whom it is important not to feel different
from their peers, can benefit from support groups.

The most troublesome emotions associated with
grief are anger, guilt, anxiety, and helplessness.4
Pointing out the normality of anger, confronting guilt,
and stressing survivors' strengths and hopes can be
helpful.4'" Anger can be displaced to surviving parents,
family physicians, teachers, or friends. Anticipating this
reaction prevents support from being withdrawn at a
time when it is most needed. Acknowledging what is
happening so the anger can be appropriately focused at
the loss can help the bereaved. It is also important to
address children's universal fear of further abandon-
ment directly.' Children must know whether surviving
parents are healthy. Backup plans of guardianship
could also be discussed. If fears have not been
expressed at each developmental stage (Table 2), it is
important to explore if they are present.

Emotional work
To work through the emotional pain of grief, children
should be helped to identify and express their emotions.
If these emotions are not discussed and validated, the
misconception that they are too terrible to discuss could
emerge. Younger children often express their feelings
through art and play.'4 It is helpful to start attaching
words to the emotions they display nonverbally so they
will start to make the association themselves. Older chil-
dren might have the words but not be able to say them.
Some tools to assist verbalization are reading stories
(Table 4), writng a letter to the deceased, role playing,
using photos or keepsakes as a springboard, or talking
directly to the deceased using visualized imagery.4 For

Fantasies and faulty concrete connections need to be
discussed. When dispelling fantasies it is very important
to get to the underlying emotion.5"' ("I know you wish

MISCONCEPTIONS
They do not understand
what has happened; they
are too young
Going to the funeral
would just upset them

I must protect them
from loss and pain

Children do not feel
grief the same as adults

I will not say or do the
right thing; I must be in
control to talk to them

They will not want to
talk about it
I might upset them

They need to keep busy

Getting rid of reminders
helps; encourage only
good memories
I will not mention it
unless they do

Once they have been
angry or guilty, that
should be the end of it
It is morbid to want to
touch or talk about the
body
Use terms like "passed
away," "gone to heaven"
If they are not
expressing grief,
children are not grieving

FACTS
Even the very young know when
those around them are upset. Most
understand more than adults realize
Not being included in family rituals
could be more upsetting. It helps to
see how adults grieve
All children experience losses and
need help in learning ways to deal
with them
Everyone grieves in his or her own
way, depending on circumstances,
developmental level, and life
experiences. This is usual and healthy

grieve losses in light of new
understanding and abilities
There are no right answers, only
honest ones. Saying "something"
acknowledges their grief and dispels
fears and misunderstandings
Let that be their choice, not yours. That
is often all they do want to talk about
They are already upset; that is a
natural part of grieving
Routine activities are important, but
new activities can be confusing. Not
thinking about it delays grief
This suggests it is wrong to think
about the person who died or to
have bad memories
This suggests it is wrong to mention
the person who died, that there is
something bad about them or their
death, that you do not care
Grief is a process, not steps, so the
same feelings will surface repeatedly,
as each aspect of the loss is realized
This is normal for children. It is a
good way to say goodbye and make
the death real
These are misleading, and will confuse
and frighten children. "Dead" is better
They might not know how to express
feelngs or knowifthey have
permission to grieve. They might delay
their grief to avoid upsetting others

"Grandma died in her sleep, but going to sleep didn't kill
her. Her heart stopped beating, which sometimes hap-
pens with older people. You will be fine going to sleep."

Accommodation
In accommodating the loss, families should employ
adaptive role reassignment,'6 for both the task roles
and the emotional roles that the deceased carried out
in the family. These reassignments need to be healthy
and age-appropriate (ie, a little boy is not the man of
the family when his father dies). In time it is impor-
tant to encourage resumption of normal childhood
development. School-aged children sometimes need
to be encouraged to continue developing their physi-
cal mastery of their world. Teenagers should be
allowed to resume their connections with their peers
and ongoing separation from their families.

New relationships should, in time, be added to
bereaved families' lives. If there is guilt about new rela-
tionships, reassurance that they do not replace the rela-
tionship with the deceased, although they may serve a
similar emotional role, can be helpful. Adding new peo-
ple to the famrily unit (eg, a stepparent) will almost cer-
tainly trigger a "grief attack."910"'1 Other losses not
necessarily due to death and significant life events (ie,
graduations, marriage) can do the same. If this is expect-
ed and seen for what it is-mourning the loss of a loved
one-the emotions are easier to understand and accept

Personal experience
Where have the family I mentioned at the beginning
of this article been and where do we plan to go from
here with working through their grief?

My first task was to deal with my own feelings of
loss due to my patient's death. In addition to being
someone I had liked and respected, this woman was
also a friend and neighbour whose children are simi-
lar in age to my own. I needed to go to the funeral
and talk to friends and colleagues to grieve myself.
Initially the father, children, and I met regularly
and frequently. Helping the father and the children
with their grief has been integrally connected. The
most helpful strategy of our work together has been
creating memory books of their mother. This involved
collecting photos, the funeral notice, pictures, and sto-
ries about their mother that the children had written
at school and had created in the office.

The stories and pictures that they made in the office
have served several purposes. While the children are
drawing, the father and I have a chance to talk about
his grief and his concerns about his children. Sometimes
the children participate in these conversations,

2918 Canadian Family Physician .Le Medecin defamille canadien * VOL 45: DECEMBER *DECEMBRE 1999

sometimes not, but the atmosphere of open communica-
tion is apparent Comments made by the children indi-
cate they are listening to more than they appear to be.
When they draw a picture or write a story of their moth-
er, it provides an easy opening to discuss her as well as
their ideas and their feelings about the death (Figure2).
The pace of our grief work is set by the children.
At times they choose to talk of other events in their
lives and at times they do not come to the appoint-
ments. This variability in their needs gives the father
and me time to focus more intensely on his grief
issues. As the children age and reinterpret their
mother's death, the memory books are one tool to
assist them. The meetings have established an atmos-
phere of trust and interest. With this trust the chil-
dren feel the office is a safe and familiar place where
they can discuss their mother now and in the future.
Throughout this process I have been impressed by
several things. The first is the need for repetition; the
stories, concerns, and feelings have needed to be
expressed again and again. The children's ideas about
death have correlated with those in the literature, but I
have been impressed with how much their apparent
understanding fluctuates when they are ill, tired, or
upset The resurgence of grief at key times in this fami-
ly's life has been intense. Anticipation of this resurgence
has not dininished its intensity.

The need for close support has decreased with
time. We plan to meet at the times grief is expected to
recur: Mother's Day, the wedding anniversary, birth-
days, and the anniversary of her death. We will leave
the door open for the unexpected. As the children
age and reinterpret the death, we will explore issues
with their new level of understanding. It has been a
privilege and a learning experience for me to be with
this family during this difficult time in their lives.

Conclusion
Children have a gradually evolving understanding of
death, and the psychological defences they have at their
disposal are different from adults'. Their mourning will
appear different from adults'. Counseling children to
assist them in their grief involves understanding these
differences and providing an honest and accepting envi-
ronment in which they can express their grief. Very
importantly, it also means providing support and educa-
tion for surviving parents.

This approach will assist most people to work
through their grief, but when personal, circumstantial, or
social factors inhibit grief, children will not be able to
resume normal developmental growth. In these cases
more in-depth grief therapy is needed.
