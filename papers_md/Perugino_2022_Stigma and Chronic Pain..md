ABSTRACT

Stigma is deﬁned by the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) as ‘‘a mark of shame, disgrace or
disapproval that results in an individual being
rejected, discriminated against and excluded
from participating in a number of different
areas of society’’. Extensive literature searches
have documented stigma in the context of
health. Among the physical health conditions
that are associated with stigma, chronic pain
deserves particular attention. Stigma experi-
enced by individuals with chronic pain affects
their entire life. Literature identiﬁes multiple
dimensions or types of stigma, including public
stigma and internalized
stigma,
stigma. Recent literature supports the biopsy-
chosocial model of pain, according to which
biological, psychological
and sociocultural
variables interact in a dynamic manner to shape
an individual’s
response to chronic pain.

INTRODUCTION

Deﬁnition of Stigma

Stigma is deﬁned by the World Health Organi-
sation (WHO) as ‘‘a mark of shame, disgrace or
disapproval that results in an individual being
rejected, discriminated against and excluded
from participating in a number of different
areas of society’’ [1]. This deﬁnition has its roots
in the classical conceptualisation of stigma
given in 1963 by the Canadian sociologist Erv-
ing Goffman, who deﬁned stigma as an

1086

Pain Ther (2022) 11:1085–1094

‘‘attribute that is deeply discrediting’’, the ‘‘sit-
uation of the individual who is disqualiﬁed
from full social acceptance’’ [2]. In the wake of
Goffman but focusing on the power relations in
society [3], Link and Phelan conceptualise
stigma as the co-occurrence of four compo-
nents: (1) the distinguishing and labelling of
human differences;
the association of
(2)
human difference with negative attributes; (3)
the separation of ‘‘us’’ from ‘‘them’’; (4) status
loss and discrimination against those labeled
[4]. The concept of stigma thus becomes closely
related to the social consequences of the iden-
tiﬁcation and labelling of the ‘‘other’’ in terms
of creation of social inequalities such as disap-
proval, rejection, exclusion and discrimination
[5].

Stigma and Health Conditions

Extensive literature searches have documented
stigma in the context of health [6]. Examples of
mental and physical health conditions that are
commonly stigmatised include major depres-
sion [7], schizophrenia [8], epilepsy [9], HIV/
AIDS [10], tuberculosis [11], obesity [12] and
chronic pain [13]. Experiencing stigma for
having a particular health condition is a perva-
sive barrier interfering with patient health. In
fact, individuals with stigmatised health con-
ditions tend to avoid treatment [14] and to have
poor
treatment outcomes, decreased social
[15], difﬁculty in obtaining
opportunities
employment [16] and a decreased overall qual-
ity of life [14].

Deﬁnition of Chronic Pain

Among the physical health conditions that are
associated with stigma, chronic pain deserves
particular attention. Chronic pain is one of the
most common reasons people seek medical care
[17] and is a leading source of human suffering
and disability in the world [18]. Recently, the
WHO, in collaboration with the International
Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), has
proposed a new deﬁnition of ‘‘chronic pain’’,
updating the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases (ICD-11), to focus on chronic pain as a

global health priority [19]. Chronic pain is
deﬁned as persistent or recurrent pain lasting [
3 months and it affects [ 30% of people
worldwide [20]. Examples of chronic primary
pain conditions include ﬁbromyalgia, complex
regional pain syndrome, chronic migraine,
temporomandibular disorder,
irritable bowel
syndrome and non-speciﬁc low-back and neck
pain.

STIGMA AND CHRONIC PAIN

Individuals affected by chronic pain are vul-
nerable to stigmatising the reaction of others:
‘‘Pain is all in your head’’, ‘‘You must be crazy’’,
‘‘If you look healthy, you cannot be in pain’’,
‘‘You must have complete control over every-
thing in your life’’, ‘‘You just want attention’’,
‘‘It’s just anxiety’’, and ‘‘It must be nice to not
work’’ are just some of the stigmatising sen-
tences aimed to people with chronic pain.

Several factors contribute to chronic pain-
related stigma: the absence of clear medical
evidence such as clear tissue damage, which
does not ﬁt with the largely accepted biomedi-
cal model [13], the invisibility of pain symp-
toms as well as
the subjectivity of pain
assessment [21]. Among chronic pain condi-
tions, migraine stigma has been one of the most
durable and remarkably stable over time [22].

Impact of Stigma on the Public Life
of Individuals with Chronic Pain

Stigma experienced by individuals with chronic
pain affects their entire life. It inﬂuences their
social relationships because they do not feel
understood by relatives, romantic partners and
friends [5, 13, 23].

Stigma matters also in clinical

settings,
causing underassessment and underestimation
of pain by health care staff [24], with scepticism
and suspicion about the reality of suffering,
tendency to attribute lower pain in ratings
[13, 25, 26] and consequent undertreatment
and overpsychologisation of pain [27]. Even
dismissal in clinical settings has been reported
by patients [28].

Stigma is also experienced in the workplace
[13]. Patients perceive unfriendliness
and
antagonism from their fellow workers [23], and
they can continue to work while sick, a phe-
nomenon known as presenteeism—resulting in
a decline in productivity and efﬁciency in
addition to poor well-being [29, 30]. Moreover,
in turn, the resulting distress can lead to sick-
ness absence and burnout [31]. In particular,
migraine, whose prevalence estimates increased
over the years [32], is the most common cause
of lost work time due to disability in the world
among people \ 50 years of age, with substan-
tial losses in productivity and employer cost
[33, 34]: for instance, in Japan the estimated
cost of productivity loss associated with pre-
senteeism has been calculated at 21.3 billion
US$/year, while the annual economic loss due
to absenteeism has been calculated to be US$
2.7 billion [33]. Furthermore, missed and lost
productive days per year for individuals with
frequent migraine attacks have been estimated
to
respectively,
accounting for approximately 20% of the work
individuals with chronic
year, while
migraine ([ 15 headache days per month) the
estimated number of days per year missing from
work and with reduced productivity are 3.5 days
and 87 days, respectively, accounting for 38% of
the work year [33].

Impact of Stigma on Personal Well-Being
of Individuals with Chronic Pain

Stigma of chronic pain is therefore pervasive,
weaving its way in multiple dimensions of life.
Its impact on personal well-being is very
variable [13]. Some individuals are more resi-
lient and seem not to be affected [13, 35], while
others show psychological distress, especially
those with chronic musculoskeletal pain in
head and neck regions [36], depressive symp-
toms, social withdrawal, decline in self-esteem,
failed attempts at self-realisation and insomnia
[24, 37, 38]. Moreover, individuals with chronic
pain are twice as likely to report suicidal beha-
viours or to complete suicide, and according to

suicidality, in addition to depressive symptoms
and other general risk factors [39] associated
with higher lethality [40]: so it is extremely
important for clinicians to provide an in-depth
investigation into the suicidal mind, an assess-
ment in addition to the psychiatric evaluation,
adopting a phenomenological approach [41].

Types of Stigma

In accordance with Corrigan’s progressive
model of self-stigma, the stigmatising attitudes
and reactions of others have a detrimental
impact on personal well-being only when a
series of stages, namely ‘‘awareness, agreement
and application’’ of these stigmatising attitudes,
occur in the self [13, 42, 43].

Literature identiﬁes in fact multiple dimen-
including public
stigma and internalised

types of stigma,

structural

sions or
stigma,
stigma.

Public stigma refers to negative attitudes and
stereotypes circulating in the general public
[30, 44].

Structural stigma refers to an organisation’s
policies or culture of negative attitudes and
beliefs toward stigmatised individuals [45].

Finally,

internalised or self-stigma can be
described as a process whereby affected indi-
viduals absorb negative stereotypes, considering
them self-relevant, and anticipate social rejec-
tion [16, 46–48].

Stigma is internalised by a large percentage
of people living with chronic pain. Speciﬁcally,
a study conducted by Waugh et al. [37] reported
that 38% of people affected by chronic pain
endorsed the experience of internalised stigma,
including alienation, social withdrawal and
discriminatory experiences based on pain. This
proportion is comparable to levels observed in
the mental health literature [37, 48, 49]. The
study showed that internalised stigma has a
negative relationship with self-esteem and pain
self-efﬁcacy. In fact, individuals with chronic
pain who experience internalised stigma may
anticipate devaluation and discrimination and
adopt avoidance coping behaviours such as
social withdrawal, resulting in decreased sense
of hope and self-esteem [50]. This state of

1088

devaluation and demoralisation may in turn
make people reluctant to approach life goals
and engage in satisfying and rewarding activi-
ties despite their pain [42].

Furthermore, internalised stigma was associ-
ated with cognitive functioning in relation to
pain in terms of a greater tendency to catas-
trophise about pain and a lower perception of
personal control over pain [37]. Several studies
have demonstrated that catastrophic thinking
in relation to pain affects long-term disability
and represents a psychological barrier to recov-
ery: it is a risk factor for pain condition’s per-
sistence,
levels,
medication overuse and longer length of hos-
pital stay [51, 52]. Therefore, in the context of
these ﬁnding, internalised stigma represents a
potentially important area to enhance our
understanding and to treat individuals with
chronic pain through cognitive restructuring
techniques [37].

Internalised stigma is in fact a sociocultural
construct derived from the endorsement of
attitudes, judgements and reactions of other
people about pain through interactions with
family and friends, healthcare professionals and
work colleagues. This in turn affects individual’s
psychology, decreasing self-esteem and self-ef-
ﬁcacy, inﬂuencing cognitive processes in rela-
tion to

behaviour. Therefore, there is a reciprocal and
dynamic interaction between social and psy-
chological variables in the experience of pain.

Gender Gap Pain

The biopsychosocial model can also be used as
an explanatory framework to understand the
‘‘gender pain gap’’.

Chronic pain affects a higher proportion of
women than men around the world [55–58].
Women are at greater risk for several chronic
painful disorders, such as ﬁbromyalgia, tem-
poromandibular disorders, migraine headache,
interstitial cystitis, joint pain, irritable bowel
syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome
and trigeminal neuralgia [59]. The reasons for
this are complex, but there are convincing
ﬁndings that both biological and psychosocial
factors play important and interacting roles
[55]. Biological factors include differences in
sex-hormone production, anatomy, neuromus-
cular control and inﬂammatory responses that
in turn cause differences in processing, modu-
lation and inhibition of painful stimuli and in
response to opioids [60]. Nevertheless, studies
show that psychosocial factors exert a greater
inﬂuence. Expression of pain and behavioural
responses to perceived pain are inﬂuenced by
gender and reﬂect societal norms [60]. Men are
expected to be stoic, in control, tolerating pain
and avoiding seeking health care, whereas
women are presented as being more emotion-
ally vulnerable, more sensitive to pain and more
willing to report pain [56, 61]. Therefore, it is
more accepted for women to show pain and
men with chronic pain risk being perceived as
more feminine than the typical man [62].

These factors may explain why more women
are diagnosed with chronic pain syndromes.
Yet, paradoxically, studies show that female
patients are taken less seriously by health-care
providers, their pain is psychologised, they
receive less adequate pain medication and more
antidepressants compared to men, and they are
more likely to report medication overuse head-
ache (MOH), which is three times more com-
mon in women than in men [63–67]. Therefore,
chronic pain in female patients is more stig-
matised. Several studies showed that women
with chronic pain are often perceived as hys-
terical, emotional, complaining, not wanting to
get better, malingerers and fabricating the pain,
as if it is all in their heads, and they are assigned
psychological rather than somatic causes for
their pain [56]. This apparent paradox, in which
more women than men suffer from chronic
pain but many remain under-diagnosed and
inadequately treated, reﬂects the current state

Pain Ther (2022) 11:1085–1094

1089

of our healthcare, in line to the hegemonic
masculinity and andronormativity of our soci-
ety [56]. Moreover, there is behavioural and
electrophysiological evidence that sexism-re-
lated stigma increases female individuals’ pain
perception, thus creating a vicious circle [68].

CAUSES AND MECHANISMS
OF CHRONIC PAIN-RELATED
STIGMA

As widely discussed, stigma has a great impact
on well-being of individuals living with chronic
pain and existing studies tend to focus on it.
Conversely, little work has considered causes
and mechanisms of stigma. In their Topical
Review, De Ruddere and Craig proposed some
potential mechanisms underlying the stigma-
tising responses of observers towards individu-
als living with chronic pain [13].

First, reactions to people in pain depend on
input from the individual in pain (‘‘bottom up’’
sources). While acute pain evokes spontaneous
facial expressions, nociceptive reﬂexive with-
drawal or nonverbal vocalisations, chronic pain
expression is less likely to be automatic or
reﬂexive and, especially in contexts of the
commonplace, the absence of automatic pain
behaviour could make people suspicious of the
credibility of the pain.

Moreover, reactions to people in pain are
determined by ‘‘top-down’’ factors, such as per-
sonal belief and attitudes. From an evolutionary
perspective, stigmatising behaviour could be
explained because of the tendency of people to
value others as contributing to their personal
well-being and the good of the community and
to be suspicious of possible freeloaders, those
who take a common good without earning or
deserving it [13, 24, 69–71]. In the context of
chronic pain, the lack of clear tissue damage, in
contrast with the widely held biomedical
model, makes people doubt the authenticity
individuals with
and the trustworthiness of
pain [72]. Additionally,
it has been demon-
strated being part of a social ‘‘out group’’, such
as people with a different skin colour, raises
suspiciousness. This suspiciousness is reported

be higher toward members of social out-groups
[73, 74].

Another potential mechanism underlying
the observer stigmatising responses arises from
the causal attribution theory, which is the pro-
cess of trying to determine the causes of peo-
ple’s behaviour. In the context of chronic pain,
people tend to reward and punish other people
if they perceive them to be responsible for their
pain condition.

Finally, reactions to people in pain can be
determined by the fact that health care profes-
sionals often do not receive adequate education
regarding pain assessment and feel uncertain
about managing patients with chronic pain
[75, 76]. A recent systematic review on patients’
perceptions of prescription opioids, commonly
prescribed in chronic pain, revealed a certain
unease of health care professionals about pre-
scribing and discussing opioids with patients
[77].

INTERVENTION STRATEGIES
TO REDUCE CHRONIC PAIN-
RELATED STIGMA

In addition to focusing on underlying mecha-
nisms in observer stigmatising responses, De
Ruddere and Craig, in their Topical Review,
dealt with intervention strategies to address
stigma at different levels: intrapersonal, inter-
personal and structural [13]. The intrapersonal
level describes interventions directed at indi-
to enhance resilience and coping
viduals
strategies
through emotion regulation and
enhanced psychological ﬂexibility in people
with chronic pain and to help them to over-
come stigma-related cognitive and emotional
distress [13, 24, 78]. The interpersonal
level
describes interventions directed at small-group
interactions (e.g., promoting less prejudicial
manners of social interaction). The structural
level describes interventions directed at the
social-political environment, such as laws and
policies.

Pain Education and the Biopsychosocial
Model

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Considering the above-mentioned inadequate
education of health care professionals regarding
pain assessment and their insecurity to manage
patients with chronic pain, a ﬁrst-line inter-
vention strategy could be to promote pain
education [75] and to expand knowledge and
assessment of chronic pain, as recently high-
lighted for headache disorders [79, 80], espe-
cially for resistant or refractory migraine, whose
diagnosis, without an adequate education to
understand the possible ﬂuctuations of the dis-
ease, may have profound psychological impli-
cations with the idea of unsolvability and
contribute to stigmatising the patient [81, 82].
Nonetheless, this would also imply overcoming
deeply rooted prejudices, behaviours and values
embedded in our society and reversing Eccle-
ston’s ‘‘analgesic culture’’ [24, 83], characterised
by ‘‘the dominant belief that pain should be
short-lived, diagnostically meaningful, and
denote a ﬁxable problem’’. Because of its per-
sistent condition and diagnostic uncertainty,
chronic pain does not ﬁt this model. Likewise,
the absence of clear medical tissue damage does
not ﬁt with the narrow biomedical perspective
on acute pain [84] which presupposes a clear
pathophysiology to explain the pain experience
and is focused on tissue damage and nocicep-
tive afferent systems. Even the models proposed
by psychology were found to be inadequate and
often stigmatising [85].

The limits of models adopted so far compel
transition to a more comprehensive and holistic
model, like the biopsychosocial one, as previ-
ously discussed. This model includes the role of
the central nervous system and neuroplasticity
as biological substrates of the cognitive and
affective processes of chronic pain [86] and
integrates them with psychological and socio-
cultural variables that interact in a dynamic
manner to shape an individual’s response to
chronic pain.

A broader understanding of the processes
involved in chronic pain and its transmission in
clinical settings and in the wider community
would contribute to reduce the stigma attached
to individuals living with chronic pain.
