Abstract
Social anxiety can have an adverse effect on social connections, educational achievement, and wellbeing. However, the extent 
to which students stigmatize their peers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in female educational settings remains unknown. 
This study investigated the relationship between SAD, peer-liking and stigma in a cohort of early adolescent girls. The sample 
was 103 sixth and seventh graders attending three girls’ schools in Australia. The students, aged between 10- and 13-years, 
were randomly allocated to either a control (n = 52) or experimental (n = 51) group. Participants completed an online survey 
while at school to examine their responses to one of two age-and-gender matched vignettes: a hypothetical peer with SAD 
(experimental condition), or without SAD (control condition). Contrary to expectations, group comparisons revealed that 
students with the SAD vignette liked their peer more than students with the non-SAD vignette. Also, students endorsed 
higher levels of pity, lower levels of fear, but similar levels of anger when considering their SAD (versus non-SAD) peer. In 
the SAD group, higher levels of pity were associated with greater peer-liking. The opposite pattern was evident in response 
to the non-SAD peer. Importantly, students discriminated less (preferred less social distance) in response to their peer with 
SAD. This points to the potential benefit of adolescent peer programs that aim to promote positive peer-relationships as a 
protective factor for students with SAD. Future research may examine gender and socio-economically diverse students to 
increase the confidence with which findings can be generalized to other educational settings.

Introduction

Mental health difficulties in adolescents are prevalent and 
have reportedly risen in recent years with the prevalence of 
anxiety disorders surpassing that of depression [1, 2]. The 
onset of social anxiety, usually during adolescence, has been 
linked with adverse developmental outcomes in social, aca-
demic, physical and mental health domains [3]. As a broad 
construct, social anxiety exists on a continuum from sub-
clinical feelings of nervousness to a clinical diagnosis of

a mental health disorder [4]. According to the Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [5], a 
clinical diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD), requires 
symptoms that cause significant distress and/or impairment 
to the individual affected [6]. The core symptom of SAD is 
a fear of being negatively evaluated by peers, that is often 
combined with difficulty functioning in social settings [7]. 
As such, the association between SAD and peer relationships 
has been examined in clinical [8], developmental [9], and 
social-cognitive psychological domains [10].

Social anxiety is most prevalent in western societies, 
females, and adolescents, with almost 1 in 10 adolescents 
affected [11]. Age-of-onset data specifically identifies early 
adolesence is a developmentally sensitive time period for the 
onset of SAD [12]. Early adolescence has been associated 
with greater abstract thinking and perspective taking [9], 
which could contribute to greater self-consciousness, fear 
of negative evaluation, and social avoidance [8]. In addi-
tion, prevalence data suggest social anxiety is most com-
mon amongst young females and young cohorts [1]. If left

untreated, anxiety disorders can persist with an increased 
risk of educational underachievement, substance abuse dis-
orders and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Further, SAD 
treatment has low efficacy rates in comparison to other anxi-
ety disorders (e.g., [13]). This is the case regardless of treat-
ment variations such as the inclusion of parents, homework 
completion, and group versus individual treatment (e.g., 
[14, 15]). However, it has also been suggested that adoles-
cence is a developmental period of heightened flexibility 
and learning [1]. This raises a question as to whether early 
adolescence might be an appropriate time-period to target 
risks associated with SAD, especially in educational settings 
[1]. For these reasons, the present study is focused on the 
links between SAD, peer-stigma and peer-liking amongst 
early adolescent girls (10–13 years). To examine the possi-
ble role of peer relationships in contributing to the negative 
impacts of social anxiety, we used vignettes to examine how 
peers respond to their peers who exhibit socially-anxious 
behaviours. It is anticipated that findings will give direc-
tion to appropriate time periods for targeting interventions, 
particularly in female educational settings.

SAD and Peer‑Liking

It has been proposed that a number of factors can contribute 
to the etiology and maintenance of SAD, including biologi-
cal, social and interpersonal influences (see [8] for a review). 
One example of a social influence is the role of peer rela-
tionships (see [8, 16, 17] for theoretical models). If socially 
anxious adolescents are not liked by their peers, there may 
be fewer opportunities for them to social engage with their 
peers. This together with social avoidance could contribute 
to the maintenance of anxiety symptoms for early adoles-
cents. While there is consensus that adolescents with SAD 
perceive themselves as less likeable [18], there are mixed 
findings concerning their peer-rated likeability. Some stud-
ies suggest that children with anxiety disorders are less liked 
and experience more rejection than their non-anxious peers. 
Verduin and Kendall [19], for example, found that children 
with SAD (but not other anxiety disorders) were liked less 
by their peers after delivering a speech. Similarly, Barrow 
et al. [20] found that the children with SAD received lower 
peer-ratings, compared to the children without SAD. Baker 
et al. [21] conducted a similar study with 7–12-year-old 
actors who were instructed to give a verbal speech in either 
an anxious manner or in a non-anxious manner. The children 
who delivered the non-anxious (versus anxious) presenta-
tions received higher peer-rated liking scores. However, find-
ings linking peer-liking and child social anxiety are mixed 
[22]. Baartmans et al. [18], for example, conducted a study 
with a large sample of 7–13-year-olds to find that children 
with higher levels of social anxiety were more liked by their 
peers than children with lower levels of social anxiety. These 

mixed results provide a challenge to drawing strong conclu-
sions and raises a question about whether there is a moderat-
ing role of other variables such as peer-stigma.

Stigmatization

Goffman [23] described stigma as a sign or a mark designat-
ing the bearer as flawed or compromised when compared 
to the non-stigmatized person. A common assumption in 
stigma theory is that individuals are categorized according 
to undesirable social stereotypes [24] that evoke prejudice 
[25]. For example, Weiner's [26] model proposes that stereo-
types about personal responsibility for deviance can result 
in anger (when the individual is deemed responsible) or pity 
(when deemed blameless). Weiner's model was developed 
for adults but has been tested and validated in adolescents 
with respect to schizophrenia-related stigma [27] Although 
theoretical models of stigma differ, the construct is generally 
framed as a function of human cognition and discrimina-
tion (e.g., social rejection [28]). Corrigan [29] developed 
the attribution model of mental illness stigma, which is com-
monly applied in stigma research. The model predicts that 
appraising a person's behaviour as dangerous leads to fear, 
which in turn results in social avoidance and segregation. 
Social-cognitive attribution theories of stigma [26, 29] sug-
gest that if we can identify the stereotypes, attributions and 
prejudicial feelings that children attach to peers with SAD, 
it may be possible to design interventions to challenge these 
assumptions and mitigate the risks of negative peer interac-
tions [30].

Stigma theory also implicates the prejudicial feelings of 
pity, anger, and fear as causal mechanisms in the relation-
ship between mental health problems and peer discrimi-
nation  [26,  29].  Research  examining  stigmatization  has 
therefore traditionally employed measures of prejudicial 
feelings (pity, anger, and fear) in addition to measures of 
discrimination (preference for social distance). While there 
is evidence that the prejudicial feelings of fear and anger 
are associated with depression [31], there is also evidence 
that this is not the case with feelings of pity [32, 33]. Over-
all, however, the affective components of peer-stigma and 
mental health disorders has received little research atten-
tion [34, 35]. Further, adolescent stigma studies are scarce 
and have largely focused on the stigmatization of adoles-
cents with ADHD and depression [36]. A qualitative study 
by O’Driscoll et al. [31], for example, asked adolescents to 
imagine making friends with a peer diagnosed with ADHD. 
Participants anticipated that the peers’ impulsive behaviour 
would attract negative social consequences, leading to preju-
dicial feelings including anger, frustration, and embarrass-
ment. Similarly, when considering a male hypothetical peer 
with depression, adolescents reported feelings of anger [32]. 
Further, Jorm and Wright [37] used one of four vignettes to

examine stigma in youth (15–25 years) in response to dif-
ferent mental health conditions; depression, depression with 
alcohol misuse, social phobia, and schizophrenia. Results 
suggest that youth perceive their peers with social phobia 
(versus depression) to be weaker, but they do not discrimi-
nate against them more (i.e. prefer social distance). How-
ever, despite SAD being one of the most common mental 
health disorders in adolescence [6], the association between 
peer-stigma and SAD is unknown. This is surprising given 
the risk that peer-stigma can negatively impact psychologi-
cal development [38].

Theoretical models of stigma together with empirical 
research examining SAD and peer stigma could inform the 
design of interventions that prevent stigmatizing attitudes 
and promote positive peer interactions in educational set-
tings [39]. If negative peer responses are related to social 
anxiety in early adolescence and contribute to the aetiology 
and maintenance of SAD, then it is important to understand 
the mechanisms underlying these responses. Also, there 
may be unique ways in which stigma is expressed in all-
girl educational settings. Jorm and Wright [37] for exam-
ple, found that females endorsed lower levels of stigmatizing 
attributions and preference for social distance compared to 
males. Females have also been observed to express more 
benevolence  and  less  discrimination  and  stigmatization 
toward those with mental health concerns (e.g., [40]). In 
contrast, males have been observed to blame peers for their 
depression when compared to their female counterparts [31]. 
This finding, together with the higher incidence of SAD in 
females, points to the value of examining the relationship 
between SAD in peer-stigma in female educational settings. 
Findings may assist with the development of gender specific 
interventions for this cohort and improve the management 
of SAD in female schools.

The Present Study

Although evidence is mixed, the majority of the research 
evidence suggests that early adolescents with social anxiety 
are less liked by their peers [20]. However, to the authors’ 
knowledge,  no  studies  have  examined  peer-stigma  (dis-
crimination and prejudicial feelings) in early adolescent 
girls. This is despite the high prevalence of SAD for this 
cohort [8], and the gender difference in discrimination in 
response to other mental health conditions [40]. The delete-
rious effect peer-stigma could have on recovery and help-
seeking of early adolescent girls in female girl schools is 
unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the effect 
of SAD on peer-stigma and peer-liking in an educational 
setting of female early adolescents. To achieve this aim, all 
participants were randomly allocated to a SAD or non-SAD 
condition and asked to complete an online survey examin-
ing their responses to an age-and-gender matched vignette. 

Peer-stigma was examined using measures of discrimination 
(preference for social distance) and prejudicial feelings (pity, 
anger, and fear). To achieve our aim, we employed two com-
plementary analytical approaches. First, we adopted a cat-
egorical approach to assess group differences (SAD versus 
non-SAD) in discrimination, and the affective components 
of peer-stigma: pity, anger, and fear. Second, we adopted a 
continuous approach to assess the relationship—in the SAD 
and non-SAD groups—between discrimination, peer-liking, 
and the prejudicial feelings of pity, anger and fear. This sec-
ond analytical approach was exploratory.

Two primary predictions are made based on the literature 

reviewed.

1.  SAD and peer-liking: compared to participants in the 
control group, early adolescent girls in the SAD group 
will  endorse  significantly  lower  levels  of  liking  in 
response to a hypothetical peer vignette [19, 20].

2.  SAD and peer-stigma: in response to a hypothetical peer 
vignette, early adolescent girls in the SAD (versus con-
trol) group will endorse significantly higher levels of the 
discrimination [31], fear and anger [31], but not pity [32, 
33].

Methods

Participants

Participants were recruited from a convenience sample of 
private school girls by contacting parents of early adoles-
cents attending one of three female educational settings—
two secondary and one primary elementary school—located 
in Sydney, Australia. All families expressing interest were 
eligible to participate. One hundred and three early adoles-
cent girls participated in this study. At the time of recruit-
ment, participants’ age ranged from 10 to 13 years  (Meanage 
11.96;   SDage  0.60).  All  participants  attended  a  private 
school. Mean fees for grades 6 and 7, at the time of the 
study, were $20,592 per annum which was equivalent to 
approximately one-quarter of the average total annual cash 
earnings for full-time employees in Australia at the time 
(Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2014). No additional 
demographic information was obtained due to school pri-
vacy regulations.

Participants were randomly allocated to either experi-
mental (n = 52) or control conditions (n = 51). Independent 
samples t-test confirmed that there were no significant dif-
ferences in student age between experimental and control 
groups, t(101) = 0.33, p = 0.743. To control for the known 
effect  of  peer-raters’  social  anxiety  on  their  responding 
[21], children’s thoughts of social threat were measured (see 
‘Materials and Measures’ below for details of the Social 

1 31234

Threat Subscale of the Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale 
[41]. An additional independent samples t-test confirmed 
no  significant  group  difference  in  participants’  anxiety 
(thoughts of social threat, t(101) = − 0.53, p = 0.597.

The study was approved by the Macquarie University 
Human  Research  Ethics  Committee  approval  number: 
5201500195. All caregivers provided written informed con-
sent prior to their adolescent child participating in the study. 
This research did not receive any specific grant from funding 
agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Materials and Measures

Vignettes

The vignettes described an age-and-gender matched early 
adolescent who engaged in behaviours that were either (a) 
consistent with a SAD diagnosis (experimental condition), 
or (b) inconsistent with a SAD diagnosis (control condi-
tion). The vignette used in the experimental condition was 
a social phobia vignette originally developed by Jorm et al. 
[42] and adapted by clinical researchers [43]. In the present 
study, the vignette was modified to describe an early ado-
lescent that would meet DSM-5 [5] criteria for SAD (see 
‘Appendix’). This included social avoidance, nervousness 
during class talks, and avoidance of eating in social situa-
tions. Further modifications include; removal of the refer-
ence to answering the telephone (to ensure the vignette was 
contemporary) and removal of the word “vomit” (to comply 
with the school principal’s request). The final version of the 
vignette was validated and rated for accuracy by a group of 
clinical researchers (n = 4) with experience working with 
adolescents and social anxiety, who provided a score from 
1 (very inaccurate) to 6 (very accurate). Accuracy ratings 
(M = 4.25, SD = 1.5), support the validity and accuracy of 
the SAD vignette for use in the present study.

The vignette used in the control condition described an 
early adolescent female demonstrating behaviours that were 
not consistent with a SAD diagnosis, such as socializing 
with friends and playing group sports. The description of the 
control peer was an adaptation of the non-clinical vignette 
developed by Martin et al. [44] (see ‘Appendix’). The control 
vignette was validated and rated for accuracy as described 
above. Accuracy ratings (M = 5, SD = 0) support the valid-
ity and accuracy of the SAD vignette for use in the present 
study. Based on group feedback, the final version included 
the phrase “sometimes has a problem with feeling annoyed 
if she doesn't get her own way” (as opposed to “sometimes 
has some problems with needing to have her own way”).

To reduce the risk of bias, the name ‘Sarah’ was used for 
both vignettes and the self-reported measures below. ‘Sarah’ 
was a name that was not shared by any of the participants.

Peer‑Liking

To measure peer ‘liking’ in relation to their hypothetical 
peer, students completed the 4-item Peer Liking Scale (PLS: 
[19]). Items were modified to refer to Sarah. An example 
item includes: “How much do you like Sarah?”. Items were 
rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all/definitely 
not) to 4 (very much/definitely), with higher scores indicat-
ing greater liking. Reliability of the PLS is good (α = 0.91 
and 0.89; see [19, 20] respectively) and Cronbach's alpha 
indicated good internal consistency (α = 0.82) in the present 
study.

Peer‑Discrimination

Peer-discrimination was operationalized as self-reported 
preference for social distance in relation to a hypothetical 
peer and was measured using the five-item Social Distance 
Scale (SDS: [45]), using a version modified for adolescents 
[37]. An example item is: ‘Would you be happy to work on 
a school project with Sarah?’ Items were rated on a 4-point 
scale from 1 (yes, definitely) to 4 (definitely not), with higher 
scores indicating greater preference for social distance from 
Sarah. Previous findings have established good reliability 
(α = 0.86 and 0.87; see [37, 46] respectively) and construct 
validity [45]. Cronbach's alpha indicated good reliability in 
the present sample (α = 0.83).

Prejudicial Feelings

Students self-reported their feelings of anger, fear, and pity 
in relation to their hypothetical peer. Each feeling was meas-
ured using a single item from the Revised Attribution Ques-
tionnaire (r-AQ: [47]). The r-AQ is comprised of the single 
items that loaded most strongly onto each of the factors iden-
tified in the 28-item Attribution Questionnaire. The r-AQ is 
valid and subscales for pity, anger, and fear have adequate 
reliability (α = 0.74, 0.89, and 0.96 respectively [47]). Each 
item included a self-statement in relation to the hypothetical 
peer (e.g., “Sarah makes me angry”). Scoring details were 
followed as specified in the Short Form for Children Attribu-
tion Questionnaire (AQ-8-C) [48]

Thoughts of Social Threat

To control for the known effect of peer-raters’ social anxiety 
on their responding [21], students’ thoughts of social threat 
were measured using the 10-item social threat subscale of 
the Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS) [41]. An 
example item includes: “Everyone is staring at me.” Partici-
pants rated the frequency of thoughts in the past week using 
a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time), with 
higher scores indicating more automatic thoughts of social 

1 3

1235

threat. The subscale has demonstrated good discriminant 
validity and internal consistency (α = 0.92), and adequate 
test–retest reliability at 3 months (r = 0.73) [41]. Reliability 
of the CATS in the current sample was good (α = 0.92).

Pilot

The online survey was piloted in a small sample of age-
matched early adolescent girls (n = 6). Pilot participants 
answered  questions  assessing  their  understanding  of 
instructions  and  questions,  and  whether  they  found  the 
questionnaire tiring to complete. Responses indicated that 
the wording and length of the survey were age and content 
appropriate.

Procedure

Data collection took place on-location at two secondary 
and  one  primary  elementary  educational  setting  during 
class time. Prior to accessing the questionnaire, participants 
watched a short PowerPoint presentation of survey instruc-
tions, such as details of how to record their ratings. Partici-
pants then received an envelope containing a number and 
a randomly assigned unique identifier to allocate them to 
either the Experimental (SAD) or Control (non-SAD) condi-
tion. Participants used their own devices to access a school-
issued email that contained a link to the online survey. Stu-
dents were prompted to enter their age and identifier prior to 
completing the survey. Two information technology staff, a 
researcher and a teacher were present to provide instructions 
and assist participants with technical issues and questions.

Results

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for all measures for the Experimental 
and Control conditions are displayed in Table 1. Preliminary 
t-tests assessed the effects of participant’s age on discrimina-
tion and prejudicial feelings measures, and the relations of 
these measures to student’s thoughts of social threat (con-
trol measure). As all results were non-significant ‘age’ and 
‘thoughts of social threat’ were not included in subsequent 
analyses. All data were screened for outliers, and statistical 
assumptions were deemed satisfactory.

The Social Consequences of SAD

We examined whether there were between group differ-
ences in peer-liking, discrimination and prejudical feelings 
based on whether or not the hypothical peer ‘Sarah’ exhib-
ited symptoms of social anxiety. This analysis indicated that

students with the SAD vingnette differed in their response 
to their hyothetical peer with regard to the majority of affec-

An adjusted t-statistic is reported in cases where Leven’s

Do Students in Female Schools Like Their Peers 
with Social Anxiety?

An independent samples t-test was conducted to test for 
group differences in peer liking. Contrary to our prediction, 
the significant group difference, t(101) = 2.89, p = 0.005 
indicated that students in the SAD group did not endorse 
lower levels of liking in response to their vignette. Results 
indicated that students in the SAD group expressed higher 
levels  of  liking  in  response  to  their  hypothetical  peer 
(M = 11.04, SE = 0.39) compared to students in the con-
trol  group  (M = 9.35,  SE = 0.44).The  difference  of  1.69, 
BCa 95% CI 0.44–3.04 represented a medium-sized effect, 
d = 0.57 [49].

In  conclusion,  students  with  the  SAD  vignette  liked 
‘Sarah’  more,  compared  to  students  with  the  non-SAD 
vignette.

Peer‑Discrimination

Next, to test the prediction that children in the SAD (ver-
sus non-SAD) group would endorse more discrimination in 
response to their hypothetical peer, an independent samples 
t-test was conducted. Contrary to our prediction the signifi-
cant group difference, t(101) = − 4.12, p < 0.001, indicated 
that students in the control group (M = 2.42, SE = 0.08) dem-
onstrated higher levels of discrimination toward their non-
SAD vignette (M = 1.95, SE = 0.08) compared to students 

1 31236

Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:1231–1241

in the experimental group toward their SAD vignette. This 
difference of 0.47, BCa 95% CI − 0.68, − 0.27, represented 
a large-sized effect, d = 0.81 [49].

In conclusion, students with the SAD vignette endorsed 
less  discrimination  (preference  for  social  distance  from 
‘Sarah’) compared to students with the non-SAD vignette.

Prejudicial Feelings

Finally, to test the prediction that early adolescent girls in 
the SAD group would endorse significantly higher levels 
of anger and fear but not pity compared to controls, one 
independent samples t-test and two Mann–Whitney U tests 
were conducted (see Table 2). Unexpectedly, there was a sig-
nificant group difference in pity, t(96.89) = 10.46, p < 0.001, 
with higher levels in the SAD group (M = 7.35, SE = 0.22), 
compared to the control group (M = 3.67, SE = 0.27). This 
difference, 3.68, BCa 95% CI 2.96–4.41 exceeded two stand-
ard deviations, representing a large effect size, D = 2.06 
[49]. Contrary to the prediction, there was no significant 
group difference comparing anger, U = 1395.50, p = 0.598, 
r = 0.05, in the Control (mean rank = 53.34) and SAD (mean 
rank = 50.64) groups. There was a significant group differ-
ence in levels of fear, U = 1544.50, p = 0.040, r = 0.20, in the 
control group (mean rank = 56.20), and SAD group (mean 
rank = 47.72). In contrast to our prediction, however, the 
direction of the difference indicated that fear was highest in 
the control group.

In summary, students with the SAD vignette endorsed 
greater feelings of pity, similar levels of anger, and lower 
levels  of  fear  compared  to  students  with  the  non-SAD 
vignette.

Is There a Relationship Between Discrimination, 
Liking and Prejudical Feelings?

Pearson correlations were carried out to determine whether 
discrimination was related to peer-liking and prejudical 
feelings, for students in the experimental (SAD) and con-
trol (non-SAD). In both groups, peer-liking was negatively 
and significantly negatively correlated with students’ dis-
crimination.  This  finding  indicates  that  as  peer-liking 
increased, discrimination decreased, regardless of whether 
students were given the SAD, r(51) = − 0.739,  p = 0.000, 
or the non-SAD vignette, r(52) = − 0.654,  p = 0.000.

Discrimination and peer-liking were not significantly 
correlated with the affective stigma responses of anger 
and  fear.  This  was  the  case  in  both  the  SAD  and  non-
SAD groups (see Table 3). However, there were some key 
group differences in the pattern of relationships between 
peer-liking,  discrimination,  and  the  affective  stigma 
response of pity. There was an interesting divergence in 
the relationships between pity and peer-liking according 
to vignette type (SAD or non-SAD). In the experimental 
(SAD) group, pity was significantly associated with peer-
liking, r(51) = 0.400,  p = 0.004 whereby higher levels of 
pity were associated with greater peer-liking. In contrast, 
in the control group, higher levels of pity were associ-
ated with less peer-liking, albeit with a very weak negative 
relationship r(52) = − 0.091, p = 0.520. A similar divergent 
pattern was evident in the association between feelings 
of pity  and discrimination. In the experimental (SAD) 
group, pity was negatively associated with discrimination,

levels of discrimination in response to the SAD vignette,

Discussion

There is mounting evidence to suggest that the prevalence 
of mental health concerns is rising as a result of the global 
COVID-19 pandemic [50, 51]. The social consequence of 
mental health disorders during early adolescence can impact 
negatively on disclosure and the help-seeking behaviour of 
students. This study is the first to examine whether early ado-
lescent girls discriminate against age-and-gender matched 
peers with SAD by disliking them and avoiding social inter-
action with them. This study also examined whether young 
adolescent girls have unique affective stigma responses to 
peers with SAD that might be linked with discrimination 
and liking. In the SAD group higher levels of pity were asso-
ciated with greater peer-liking. The opposite pattern was 
evident in response to the non-SAD peer. Although non-sig-
nificant, a similar divergent pattern was evident in the asso-
ciation between feelings of pity and discrimination in the 
SAD group. Overall, our results suggest that early adolescent 
girls with SAD are more liked, more pitied, less feared, and 
less discriminated against by their peers (in terms of desire 
for social interaction) than those without SAD.

Our finding that early adolescent girls did not endorse 
higher levels of discrimination in response to their hypo-
thetical SAD peer, was contrary to our prediction. How-
ever, when examined together with the unexpected affec-
tive stigma responses—high levels of pity and liking—this 
finding is congruent with theoretical frameworks of stigma. 
Weiner's theory [26], for example, suggests that sympa-
thetic peer-responses to people with psychological prob-
lems  evokes  feelings  of  liking  and  acceptance,  whereas 
angry responses will result in social distance and rejec-
tion.  Juvonen  [33]  tested  this  theory  by  examining  the 

relationship between perceived deviance, responsibility, 
liking,  attribution-dependent  emotions  (pity,  sympathy, 
irritation, and anger), social rejection, and social support 
in a sample of 12 year old Finnish children. Results sug-
gested that children's perception of deviance was related to 
social rejection and that peer-rejection varied as a function 
of their attribution of responsibility i.e. feelings of anger (if 
the individual is deemed responsible for their behaviour) 
or pity (if the individual is deemed blameless). Similarly, 
Dolphin and Hennessy [32] found that when an individual 
with depression is perceived by peers as having little or no 
control over the cause of their condition, then responsibility 
is not inferred. Rather, they found that feelings of sympathy 
and pity were evoked, and social acceptance was more likely. 
It could be that the hypothetical peer described in the SAD 
vignette in the current study was deemed blameless for their 
anxious behaviours, thus evoking the higher levels of pity 
and liking and lower levels of discrimination observed.

Although findings have been mixed, the higher levels 
of peer-liking in the present study are consistent with sev-
eral studies linking anxiety and greater peer-liking [18, 22, 
52]. These mixed findings could be attributed to the lack of 
homogeneity in methodological approaches to measuring 
‘peer-likeability’, such as using peer nominations of most-
liked and least-liked classmates [18] or peer-liking ratings 
of children giving oral presentations in an anxious and non-
anxious manner [21]. In the present study, adolescents were 
asked to consider a hypothetical vignette. A strength of this 
approach was that it enabled the experimental condition to 
be defined according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SAD 
symptoms [5]. This was considered advantageous as diag-
nostic criteria are considered to be consistent and reliable 
yielding improved accuracy and reduced risk of misclas-
sification such as those associated with high comorbidity in 
clinical samples [19]. However, unlike the methodology of 
using oral presentations, vignettes include contextual infor-
mation that can potentially influence participants’ responses. 

1 31238

Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:1231–1241

For example, the SAD vignette used in the present study 
suggested motivation for Sarah’s anxious behaviour (i.e. 
‘she is scared that she’ll do or say something embarrass-
ing’). This contextual information could have evoked affec-
tive responses in raters such as greater liking and pity, and 
less fear. A higher endorsement of peer-liking may in turn 
influence lower levels of discrimination for some partici-
pants. This possibility is suggested by our finding that in 
the experimental (SAD) group, but not in the control group, 
higher levels of pity were associated with greater peer liking 
and with lower levels of discrimination.

The use of a hypothetical SAD vignette could also have 
influenced other affective peer responses in our study, such 
as lower levels of fear, and higher levels of pity. A study with 
adolescents and young adults by Yap et al. [46], found that 
accurate labels of mental health disorders were associated 
with less peer-stigma. While labels were not used explic-
itly in the present study, the SAD vignette’s description of 
Sarah’s avoidance behaviours together with the reason given 
for her avoidance, may have lowered stigma responses. Also, 
other studies have examined peer attractiveness with SAD 
[20] to find that physical attractiveness is a stronger predic-
tor of peer-liking than anxiety. This raises the question of 
whether other factors, in addition to SAD, may have con-
tributed to the positive affective peer-ratings observed in 
the present study.

It is possible that the gender of our sample and links with 
empathy might have contributed to the high levels of posi-
tive peer-responding observed. It has been observed that 
patterns of stigmatizing responses may vary according to 
the gender of respondents [31, 37]. Female respondents, for 
example, tend to express more benevolence and less discrim-
ination and stigmatization toward those with mental health 
concerns (e.g., [37, 40]). In contrast, males tend to blame 
peers for their depression when compared to their female 
counterparts [31]. It could also be that early adolescent girls 
are particularly likely to empathize with their socially anx-
ious peers, and that this empathy could motivate a desire for 
social connection. Higher levels of empathy in young adults 
is associated with lower incidences of using stigmatizing 
nouns to label others (e.g., [53]) and interventions aimed at 
increasing empathy, also see a reduction in stigma [54]. Our 
study with early adolescent girls, raises a question regarding 
the role of empathy in the relationship between SAD and 
peer-stigma. While the examination of empathy is beyond 
the scope of the present study, this variable would be a fruit-
ful direction for future research in relationship to gender and 
mixed educational settings.

Rather than discrimination, peers in the present study 
endorsed a preference for social interaction with a peer 
with SAD. Interestingly, this pattern has not been evident 
in research examining other mental health conditions e.g., 
amongst peers with ADHD or depression [31]. Similarly, 

Jorm and Wright [37] found that psychosis, compared to 
depression, elicited greater peer-responses of preference for 
social distancing and Walker et al. [55] found that a diag-
nosis of depression was associated with greater stigma than 
one of ADHD. In contrast, O’Driscoll et al. [31] reported 
that a hypothetical peer with ADHD attracted greater peer-
stigma responses than a peer with depression. However, 
these results were based on explicit (vs. implicit) measures 
of stigma. It is unknown whether this pattern of respond-
ing with SAD would be similar if implicit stigma measures 
were employed. Taken together, these results highlight the 
importance of examining peer-stigma in relation to a broad 
range of mental health conditions, including social anxiety.
The promotion of positive peer relationships in female 
educational settings may be an important factor for mitigat-
ing risk associated with social anxiety during early adoles-
cence. The extant literature suggests that close friendships 
serve as a protective factor against the development and 
maintenance of social anxiety [56] and that strategies to sup-
port peer-friendships have a positive influence on social anx-
iety [57]. Studies have shown that general peer acceptance 
is associated with lower levels of internalizing problems 
during childhood and adolescence (e.g., [58]). Specifically, 
close friendships are associated with a decrease in symp-
tomatology over time [59] and the quality of friendships 
predicts better treatment outcomes for SAD [60]. There is 
opportunity for future research to consider mixed methods 
approaches to further examine the relationship between peer-
stigma and SAD, and the potential benefits of promoting 
positive peer relationships in female educational settings.

Limitations and Future Research

There are methodological aspects to the study that could 
have influenced the findings reported here. The non-SAD 
vignette, for example, includes the statement “Sarah … 
sometimes has a problem with feeling annoyed if she doesn’t 
get her way” to provide detail regarding typical “non-clini-
cal” problems for this peer. As this statement is not included 
in the SAD vignette, however, it may have contributed to 
the non-SAD being perceived as less likeable. Similarly, the 
SAD vignette includes detail concerning Sarah’s motivation 
for her anxious behaviour i.e., “She [Sarah] is scared that 
she’ll do or say something embarrassing when she’s around 
others.” The disclosure of Sarah’s internal motivation may 
have evoked empathy in participants and higher levels of 
pity and liking and lower preferences for social distance 
and fear. Future research could therefore explore the role of 
internal motivations in influencing peer-responses to SAD. 
For example, conducting a replication of the current study 
using vignettes that either contain or exclude internal moti-
vations for socially anxious behaviours. Additional measures 

1 3 
Child Psychiatry & Human Development (2023) 54:1231–1241 

1239

examining the validity of the vignettes could also address the 
above limitation. Validity information was sought through 
vignette accuracy ratings provided by a panel of experts for 
the SAD and non-SAD vignettes. A limitation of the pre-
sents study is that the accuracy ratings provided by the panel 
may not reflect true validity of the task. It is recommended, 
therefore, that future vignette-studies consider employing 
additional validation measures.

It is acknowledged that participants’ responses to the peer 
vignettes may not mirror their actual behavioural responses 
in real social situations. While self-report and attitudinal 
studies  provide  valuable  information  about  stigma,  it  is 
in the context of social interactions that peer-stigmas are 
formed. Future research could therefore consider the exami-
nation of peer-stigma using real-life social situations which 
provide participants with additional social information such 
as their peer’s temperament, interests, attitudes and peer 
group [61]. The use of technology such as 3-D virtual real-
ity could provide an opportunity for the SAD peer’s anx-
ious behaviours to be displayed and/or interacted with by 
the peer-rater. Using such technology could enable responses 
to be manipulated within vignettes to account for real-life 
variables such as social consequences. Manipulating the 
hypothetical peer’s acceptance or approval of the peer-rater’s 
avoidant or approach behaviour toward the SAD peer could 
provide a more nuanced indicator of factors that influence 
peer-liking and/or stigma of individuals with SAD.

As a preliminary study, the sample size was sufficient to 
reveal significant effects and were suitable for the statistical 
analyses reported. A larger sample size, however, may have 
allowed us to conduct sub-group analyses comparing SAD 
with other anxiety disorders and to gain further insights into 
the associations between SAD, peer-liking and peer-stigma. 
Including a measure of stigmatizing attitudes towards mental 
illness more broadly within our sample would have enabled 
comparison with norms (where available) or results from 
other studies. Also, a threat to the generalization of these 
findings is the use of a convenience sample that included 
educational settings with full-time psychologists on-staff. 
Prosocial attitudes and mental health literacy in the school 
environment could have influenced the findings here. Future 
research could consider the use of diverse gender and socio-
economic sample groups.

Summary

Social anxiety can have an adverse effect on social connec-
tions, educational achievement, and wellbeing. However, the 
extent to which students stigmatize their peers with SAD 
in female educational settings was previously unknown. 
The present study extends the existing SAD literature by 
investigating the relationship between SAD, peer-liking and 

stigma in a cohort of 103 early adolescent girls aged between 
10- and 13-years. Participants were randomly allocated into 
a control or experimental group where and completed an 
online survey in response to a control or SAD vignettes. 
Contrary to expectations, group comparisons revealed that 
students with the SAD vignette liked their peer more than 
controls and endorsed higher levels of pity, lower levels of 
fear, but similar levels of anger. In the SAD group, higher 
levels of pity were associated with greater peer-liking. The 
opposite pattern was evident in response to the non-SAD 
peer. Importantly, students discriminated less (preferred less 
social distance) in response to their peer with SAD. These 
findings have the potential inform the development of appro-
priate interventions including the promotion of positive peer 
relationships in female educational settings. Future research 
should consider the use of gender and socio-economically 
diverse samples economically diverse students to increase 
the confidence with which findings can be generalized to 
other educational settings.

Appendix

Vignette 1: Experiment (SAD) Condition

Sarah is in the same year as you. Kids at her school say 
that she is really shy. She often sits by herself during recess 
and lunch because she is scared that she’ll do or say some-
thing embarrassing when she’s around others. Also, she 
doesn’t like to eat in front of other people. Sarah has one 
close friend. Although Sarah does well at school, she hardly 
ever says a word in class and becomes incredibly nervous, 
trembles, blushes and looks like she is feeling ill if she has 
to answer a question or speak in front of the class. Sarah 
also finds it hard to talk if she has to meet anyone new. She 
refuses to join any clubs or group or go to parties or discos.

Vignette 2: Control (non‑SAD) Condition

Sarah  is  in  the  same  year  as  you.  She  likes  her  school 
because she has good friends in her class but complains 
about having to do too much homework. She usually hangs 
out with her friends at the weekend. She has several hob-
bies, including playing sports and listening to music. Sarah 
usually gets on well with other kids, but sometimes has a 
problem with feeling annoyed if she doesn't get her own 
way. Sarah does well at school—although she has to work 
hard at subjects that she finds difficult. She is well-behaved 
in school and hardly ever gets in trouble from her teacher.
