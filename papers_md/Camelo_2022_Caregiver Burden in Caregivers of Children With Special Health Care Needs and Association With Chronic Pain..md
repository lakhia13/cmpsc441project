Abstract

Background/Objectives:  Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) affects millions of individuals in 
the US but evidence of its prevalence among caregivers of children with special health care 
needs is sparse. We sought to estimate the prevalence of CNCP and its association with caregiver 
burden, in a nationally representative sample.

Methods:  Retrospective cross-sectional study using pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
data for 2010–2015. Within interviewed households, family groups consisting of at least one 
parent and one child (0–17 y) were identified. CNCP was identified by one or more ICD-9-CM 
codes utilizing previously published approaches. Level of caregiver burden was defined using a 
validated screener questionnaire identifying children with high burden of care (i.e. special health 
care needs), e.g., high or low burden. We estimated prevalence of CNCP as a function of caregiver 
burden, as well as the association of risk factors with CNCP, including parent sociodemographic 
features, clinical diagnoses, and family level characteristics.

Results:  We identified 46,525 caregivers of whom 3.6% reported experiencing high caregiving 
burden. The prevalence of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) was 25.5% and 14.0% among 
parents with high compared to low caregiving burden, respectively. Odds of CNCP were higher 
among parents with high compared to those with lower caregiver burden (OR 1.29 95% CI 
1.06 – 1.55). Being obese, experiencing disability, and having a mental health diagnosis were 
associated with higher odds of CNCP.

Conclusions:  Chronic pain is more common among caregivers with high caregiver burden. Our 
findings highlight the need to further explore the nature and impact of risk factors on caregiver 
health and disability.

Introduction

Approximately 14.1 million adult individuals in the United States care for a child with 
special health care needs (CSHCN). CSHCN include children with chronic physical, 
developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions; with different levels of disability or 
functional impairment.1,2 CSHCN vary in terms of medical needs and complexity of 
care; greater functional limitations in children are associated with more intensive 
home-care requirements and greater family burden.3,4 The burden and stress of caring 
for a child with special health care needs may contribute to worse parental overall 
health and quality of life.5–7

There is some evidence to suggest that pain or pain-associated conditions, such as low back 
pain or migraines, are more likely to be present among parents experiencing higher caregiver 
burden than among their counterparts.7 Caregiving may increase risk of chronic pain directly 
(e.g., accidental musculoskeletal injury caring for a child with behavioral outbursts) or 
indirectly by reducing opportunities for self-care (e.g., social isolation, poor preventative 
health care, sedentary lifestyle).5 Caregivers may also be more likely to be exposed to 
individual or environmental factors that increase the risk for chronic pain (e.g., depression 
or limited access to resources).6 There is limited evidence on the occurrence of chronic pain 
and associated individual, family, and contextual factors in the US population of CHSCN 
caregivers.

Although chronic pain is considered a public health issue, evidence is still limited on its 
prevalence and risk factors among vulnerable populations, such as caregivers of young 
children with special health care needs. Using the caregiver burden framework proposed 
by Raina et al, we explore the individual, family, and contextual characteristics 
associated with caregiving burden and chronic pain.8 Our goal was to estimate the 
prevalence of chronic pain among caregivers comparing those with high versus low 
caregiver burden, accounting for parental and family characteristics. As a secondary 
goal, we examined factors at the individual and family level associated with caregiver 
chronic pain.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using pooled Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey (MEPS) Household Component data from 2010 to 2015.9 MEPS collects detailed 
information on the relationship between individuals in each family unit, demographic 
characteristics, health status, health insurance coverage, medical conditions, income, and 
employment. Medical conditions are classified through International Classification of

Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes truncated at three digits to preserve subject 
confidentiality. Truncated ICD-9 codes limit the capacity to identify chronic pain per 
se, so Clinical Classification Codes were added to further specify conditions associated 
with chronic pain.10

Study Cohort

Variables

From every household in the respective full year consolidated data files, we identified all 
families that were comprised of: (i) civilian, noninstitutionalized members; (ii) at least 
1 parent, aged 18 years or older; and (iii) at least 1 child, aged 17 years or younger. 
MEPS defines a family as two or more persons living together in the same dwelling unit 
(household) who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption, as well as foster children. 
Unmarried individuals living together in the same household who consider themselves a 
family, are included in this definition.

Our study population was restricted to the parents in these families. We identified parents 
using a variable constructed by concatenating the dwelling unit identifier (DUID) and either 
the mother identifier (MOPID42X) or the father identifier (DAPID42X). These parent-
identifiers include biological, adopted and stepparents but not foster parents or non-parent 
guardians.

Dependent Variable:  Parents were classified as having chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) 
if, during the second interview round of each survey year, they communicated one or 
more conditions associated with chronic pain identified through ICD-9 and Clinical 
Classification Codes. The selection of these codes was informed by clinical expertise 
as well as by other studies that have identified chronic pain associated conditions in 
MEPS.10–12 (see Supplemental Digital Content A for list of ICD-9 codes).

Independent Variable:  Level of caregiving burden was derived from parents’ 
responses to the CSHCN Screener developed by the Child and Adolescent Health 
Measurement Initiative, and included as part of MEPS (see Supplemental Digital 
Content B)13. We classified parents as being exposed to higher caregiver burden if they 
had at least one child for whom the parent responded “yes” to all 5 stem questions and 
sub questions on the CSHCN Screener, otherwise they were deemed as exposed to lower 
caregiving burden. We excluded parents who were ineligible to answer the CSHCN Screener 
or who did not know, could not ascertain, or refused to answer any of the five questions in 
the tool.

Covariates:  We assessed parental sociodemographic and clinical characteristics potentially 
associated with chronic pain including: age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance coverage, 
highest educational degree attained, employment status, mental health comorbidities, obesity 
and parental self report of disability (see Supplemental Digital Content C). At the 
family level we assessed characteristics such as single parenting or co-parenting, family 
income category based on income as a percentage of the poverty line. Because parents 
of children with behavioral disorders experience additional care burden we also

measured whether families had at least one child with a mental health disorder.14 All 
parental characteristics were assessed in the second interview round of each survey year.

Statistical Analyses

We pooled annual 2010–2015 MEPS Household Component files and examined the 
differences between levels of caregiver burden by individual and family level characteristics. 
The six-year, snapshot provides average estimates over the pooled years.

Prevalence of CNCP was estimated by calculating the proportion of the parents who 
reported any of the included pain-associated chronic medical conditions, over the total 
number of parents in the sample. We compared the distribution of sociodemographic and 
clinical characteristics between a) parents with high or low caregiver burden, b) presence or 
not of chronic pain. Rao Scott Chi square tests and Student’s t-tests were used to compare 
the parent and family-level characteristics.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association (Odds Ratio [OR] 
and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) between caregiving burden and CNCP, adjusting 
for covariates. Robust variance estimation techniques were used to account for possible 
correlation between repeated measurement of parents’ characteristics, as parents in the 
pooled six-year cross section were assessed twice by MEPS panel design. Lastly, we 
applied a domain analysis approach, and person-level survey weighting to obtain appropriate 
estimates and standard errors for the national prevalence of CNCP and the association 
between caregiver burden and CNCP.

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 
We considered p<0.05 to be statistically significant for all multivariable analyses. The 
institutional review board at University of Maryland Baltimore authorized an exemption 
from review for this study.

Across pooled years (2010–2015) we identified 46,525 parents of whom, 3.6% were 
classified as experiencing high caregiving burden. Cohort characteristics are described 
in Table 1. Being female and a single parent were more common among parents with 
high caregiving burden (60.8%, and 26.7% respectively), compared to parents with lower 
caregiving burden (56.5% and 18.5%). About forty-nine percent (48.7%) of parents with 
high caregiving burden had one or more children with a mental disorder, compared to 
7.3% of parents with lower caregiving burden. A higher proportion of parents in the 
high burden group had disability, self-perceived fair/poor health status, at least one mental 
health condition, lower median family income, were on public insurance and unemployed 
compared to those with lower caregiver burden (Table 1). The prevalence of CNCP was 
25.5% among parents with high caregiving burden, compared to 14.0% among those 
with lower caregiving burden.

The proportion of parents experiencing high caregiver burden among those with CNCP 
was 6.4% (Table 2). Also, a larger proportion of parents with CNCP had one or more

children with a mental disorder. Parents with CNCP were overall more likely to be older, 
single, with higher prevalence of current mental health disorders, limitations in activities of 
daily living, and obesity.

Parents with higher caregiving burden had an increased odds of having CNCP, 
compared to those with lower burden (AOR 1.29 95% CI 1.06 – 1.55) (Table 3.) Odds 
were also higher among those with a child with a mental health diagnosis (AOR 1.39 95% 
CI 1.22 – 1.58). Being unemployed, experiencing limitations in daily living, and having a 
mental disorder diagnosis were associated with higher odds of CNCP.

Discussion

This study highlights the high prevalence of chronic pain among caregivers of CSHCN 
experiencing higher caregiver burden, among a nationally representative sample. In our 
sample, 21.4% of caregivers with high burden reported having fair or poor health. 
Recently, the BFRSS found that more than 19% of caregivers across the US report being 
in fair or poor health with variation across states.15 Caregivers who were obese, with 
current disability, and mental health conditions were more likely to have a clinical diagnosis 
associated with chronic pain. Despite the evidence on the psychological and emotional 
impact of caregiving, very little is known about the direct consequences on physical health. 
Poor caregiver health can have an effect on children’s development and health, especially for 
children with special health care needs. Parents who have poor health may have challenges 
attending frequent child appointments and implementing behavioral and physical health 
interventions at home to support the child’s development. To date few studies have explored 
the physical health impact of caregiving, especially among those providing care for a child 
with complex health care needs.

Caregiving is an important public health issue that impacts the health and quality of 
life across the lifespan of caregivers, care-recipients, and their families.16 A significant 
challenge in assessing the impact of caregiving is the limited availability of population-based 
data measuring caregiving burden. MEPS provides a unique opportunity to overcome this 
gap as it identifies family units, and collects detailed information on medical conditions 
and care among family members. This in turn allows estimation of chronic pain among a 
nationally representative sample, providing valuable information on the impact of caregiving 
at a national level.

This study has some limitations. First, the definition used for CNCP was based on truncated 
ICD-9 codes consistent with previously published work.10–12,17 To reduce overestimation 
of CNCP we used Clinical Classification Codes when possible as they are based on five 
digit ICD-9 codes.18–20 Second, our results are limited to caregivers who completed the 
CSHCN Screener, however these represent the majority of individuals in the sample. 
Third, for single or dual parent households we cannot identify which parent carries the 
highest burden as it is possible that other family provide support when caring for the child. 
Our assumption is that parents are likely to have the majority of responsibilities and as such 
were the only family members included in the analyses. The strengths of this study include 
identification of a large sample from a nationally representative dataset, ability to identify

households and family groups, and inclusion of covariates typically absent from secondary 
data such as caregiver body mass index and disability.

Having estimated the prevalence of chronic pain and associated risk factors among 
caregivers of children, this work raises new questions. For example, given the high 
prevalence of chronic pain among caregivers we need to understand access and use of health 
care, and pain management in this vulnerable population. Assessing the causality between 
burden of care and development of chronic pain is also critical to identify potential early 
intervention targets. Longitudinal studies that capture changes in caregiver burden as 
children develop could help identify primary and secondary chronic pain prevention 
targets. Further research on co-located pediatric and adult services, could provide 
unique opportunities to deliver adult chronic pain prevention and interventions. 
Moreover the role of community level factors in lessening burden or improving caregiver 
health remains to be explored.

Through this work we provide evidence of the high prevalence of chronic pain among 
caregivers of children with special health care needs who require high levels of care. Our 
findings suggest that chronic pain co-occurs with higher care burden among adults who 
are at the prime of their productive years and considered a high risk group for substance 
misuse or abuse. This work highlights the need to further explore risk factors for 
chronic pain and their impact on caregivers’ health and disability.
