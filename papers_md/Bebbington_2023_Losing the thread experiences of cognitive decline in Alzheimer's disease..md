Editorial

Losing the thread: experiences of
cognitive decline in
Alzheimer’s disease

Paul Bebbington

In an initiative to reduce stigma, an academic psychiatrist comes
out of the dementia closet: describing his own experience of
developing Alzheimer’s disease, the accompanying memory
problems, the restriction of some of his activities, emotional
lability and his increasing reliance on others.

Keywords
Dementia; social functioning; stigma and discrimination;
phenomenology; organic syndromes.

Lived experience narratives of dementia
I am saddened to bring this editorial to the readership. It is personal, about
a colleague and friend. Professor Paul Bebbington, an eminent social and
epidemiological psychiatrist, shows courage in talking about his diagnosis,
bringing personal experiences to challenge stigma and secrecy associated
with the diagnosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
more than 55 million people worldwide live with dementia, the seventh
leading cause of death. Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60–80% of
dementia and can affect people under the age of 65 years, although the
incidence increases with age. As we are living longer, so the prevalence of
dementia is increasing. WHO estimates 78 million people will have
dementia by 2030, and 139 million by 2050. Dementia has a significant
impact on the individual, the family and the community, in terms of
suffering and financial costs, apart from loss. There is no cure, although
newer forms of medication are argued to delay deterioration.1 There is a
genetic predisposition, but genes related to Alzheimer’s disease as a
causal pathway are distinct from genes that influence modifiable risk
factors.2 Emerging evidence shows it may be more common in ethnic
minorities, and poverty and socioeconomic status are relevant.3 An
association between dementia and depressive symptoms is also receiving
much needed attention by researchers as a potential marker for early
intervention.4 We have much to do as a research community and as
practitioners in order to support people through the process of diagnosis
and personalised care, tackle stigma and continue the search for more
effective preventive interventions.

Background

At the age of 77, having outlived both of my parents, I have recently
received a definitive but not unexpected diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease. This followed a computed tomography (CT) brain scan
and a thoughtful and detailed assessment by Dr Harwood and his
team at the Croydon Memory Clinic. As a psychiatrist with an inter-
est in phenomenology, I thought readers of the Journal might be
interested in a personal account of the experience of dementia. In

First signs of cognitive changes

Some medical problems preceded the development of my cognitive
difficulties. I have had moderate hypertension for over 20 years,
treated with antihypertensive medication, and probably not quite
well enough controlled. I think I first noticed cognitive difficulties
after episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. These were treated
in April 2016 and February 2017 under general anaesthesia, and
after each treatment I noticed my ability to remember things was,
and remained, appreciably reduced. I also noticed that I was
having more difficulty in delivering lectures, sometimes failing to
remember and to express succinctly the implication of the point I
was trying to make. These changes were significant enough for
me to discuss the matter with my UCL psychiatric colleague
Professor Gill Livingston in January 2018. At that time, she
agreed I did have mild cognitive impairment.

In November 2019, as a Biobank participant, I had a CT scan
while performing cognitive tasks to the point of failure, and felt
there had been a further diminution in my cognitive capacity. I
was asked to undertake similar tasks online some weeks before
writing this, and once more found them difficult, indeed appreciably
more difficult.

Current situation

Over the past few years my memory has worsened considerably. I
have to work harder to remember things that I want to remember,
and even then it quite often does not work. Indeed, if I do not con-
centrate hard, things are occasionally wiped in seconds. I have
trouble remembering the names of quite close acquaintances, par-
ticularly if I have not seen them for 2 or 3 months. The usual busi-
ness of forgetting when you cross a threshold what it was you set out
to do has become more prominent. I often forget which cupboard to
put something in, and unwisely try to compensate by thinking
where might be a reasonable option. This is rarely useful.

I have an increased difficulty in dating and ordering events in
the medium-term past, although I can often recall a lot of detail
in response to prompting. I easily forget future dates, for instance

when we are due to take a trip. I sometimes do not register what I am
told about events (even significant ones) experienced by other
people, which can be socially embarrassing. It has become consider-
ably harder to watch dramas on television because I can lose the plot
quite easily. I also have trouble remembering the faces of the char-
acters (an exaggeration of a lifelong propensity).

This is partly an attentional problem: my attention does stray if
it is not riveted, and I have to work quite hard to keep focused. Part
of the problem is motivational – I sometimes cannot be bothered to
deploy the increased energy that I need in order to focus. I some-
times do not finish books even though I initially found them
interesting.

Some types of immediate cognitive performance are relatively
unimpaired – I can still do the difficult sudokus the hard way
quickly and (usually) correctly. I can do things like serial 17s
without difficulty (although the fact I even think this is a good
idea is indicative).

I have other sorts of cognitive difficulty. I occasionally have a
problem in remembering the correct choices when travelling a
well-known route. This is a contrast to how I was. I can just
about learn a new route following several repetitions. I am still
driving, and feel reasonably competent to do so, but keep this
under continuous review.

Déjà vu

Given that Alzheimer’s disease has been linked to atrophic changes
in the temporal lobe,5 I found one of my symptoms of particular
interest: I have always been prone to occasional experiences of
déjà vu, but these have increased considerably in tandem with my
cognitive difficulties.

my family, particularly my wife Elizabeth. I do not like feeling
stupid. I also notice that I am more emotionally labile – I sometimes
feel near to tears when I hear something touching, in a way that is
new. I am still prone to disbelieve people who correct me, and some-
times become irritable or even angry, despite being aware of my dif-
ficulties (I am working on this!). My self-esteem has always been on
the high side, and interestingly appears to remain. This probably
contributes to my underestimating the degree of help I need:
Elizabeth now takes on all the routine organisational aspects of
our lives.

Finally, while I have always had a degree of physical clumsiness,

this too has noticeably increased.

I have been on donepezil for the past 6 months: although in con-
trolled trials this reduces the progression of dementia,1 there is, of
course, no way of knowing its effect in an individual. I have
noticed neither treatment effects nor side-effects.

A recommendation

Finally, I have discovered that by being open about my diagnosis I
have received enormous support and affection from colleagues and
friends. I recommend this approach!

Academic work

My thanks as always to my wife Professor Emerita Elizabeth Kuipers OBE, for her ongoing love,
support and the title of this paper.

Acknowledgements

I find intellectual effort more difficult, although there is some spe-
cificity to this. I find it too difficult to do the heavy lifting of formu-
lating and structuring a scientific paper, which I have now given up
entirely. However, I do still get a kick out of contributing by com-
menting on papers written by colleagues. I do not have any
trouble finding the words. However, I do have difficulty remember-
ing what exactly is in a paper once it has been out for a few months.
Likewise, I now decline invitations to review papers. When I have
reviewed a paper, I find it hard to remember the details of my criti-
cisms (I have occasionally discovered, on looking at a paper, that I
had already sent in my comments).

I found that I needed to rehearse in detail talks that I had pre-
viously presented routinely on teaching courses. As a result, I
have now completely stopped presenting papers and lecturing:
even after considerable effort and practice I could not rely on
getting the sequencing right.

I also have to work a lot harder than I might once have done to

learn Italian from Duolingo.

Impact on personal life

There are clear emotional components to this – obviously I do not
like the idea of being unreliable, or of being an inevitable burden to
