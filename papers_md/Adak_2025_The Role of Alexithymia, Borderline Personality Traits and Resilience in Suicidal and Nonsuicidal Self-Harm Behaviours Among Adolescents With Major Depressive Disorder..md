ABSTRACT
Background:  Depression  is  a  significant  health  issue  among  adolescents,  often  associated  with  decreased  academic  perfor-
mance,  self- harm  and  increased  suicide  attempts.  Suicidal  and  self- harm  behaviours  are  particularly  concerning  and  are  in-
fluenced by multiple factors beyond depression. This study aims to examine the factors contributing to suicidal behaviour and 
nonsuicidal self- harm in adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Materials and Methods: This prospective study included adolescent patients aged 12–18 years diagnosed with MDD accord-
ing  to  DSM- 5  criteria,  referred  to  our  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  Clinic  between  1  February  2023  and  1  August  2023. 
Participants with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders were excluded. 
Data collection tools included the Sociodemographic Data Form, Inventory of Statements About Self- Injury, Child Depression 
Inventory,  Borderline  Personality  Inventory  (BPI),  Toronto  Alexithymia  Scale  and  Child  and  Youth  Resilience  Measure- 12 
(CYRM- 12). Data were analysed using SPSS25.0.
Results: Out of the 185 participants initially screened, 153 completed the study and were evenly divided into three groups: those 
who had never engaged in self- harm or attempted suicide (n = 51), those who had engaged in self- harm at least once but had not 
attempted suicide (n = 51) and those who had both engaged in self- harm and attempted suicide (n = 51). There were no significant 
differences in sociodemographic variables among the groups. Cutting was identified as the most common method of self- harm 
(84.3%), followed by scratching (72.5%). In terms of resilience, measured by the CYRM- 12, the group with no history of self- harm 
or suicide attempts had significantly higher scores (M = 36.55) than the self- harm only group (M = 32.83) and the self- harm plus 
suicide attempt group (M = 31.03) (p < 0.001). For the BPI, the highest scores were observed in the group that had both engaged 
in self- harm and attempted suicide (M = 29.28), followed by the self- harm only group (M = 24.91) and the no self- harm or suicide 
group (M = 19.26) (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Adolescents with MDD who exhibit suicidal or self- harm behaviours have higher borderline personality traits and 
alexithymia levels, and lower resilience compared to their counterparts without such behaviours. These findings suggest the im-
portance of early identification and intervention targeting these factors to mitigate the risk of self- harm and suicidal behaviour 
in depressed adolescents.

Summary

•  Self- harm and suicide attempts stratify depressive pa-

tients into clinically distinct subgroups.

•  Cutting,  scratching  and  blunt- force  trauma  are  the 

most common forms of self- harm.

•  Borderline personality traits are a strong predictor of 

NSSI, while psychological resilience is protective.

•  Alexithymia's  effect  on  NSSI  is  mediated  by  border-

line personality traits.

•  Despite  similar  demographics,  psychological  profiles 

differ markedly across self- harm subgroups.

1   |   Introduction

Depression  is  a  significant  health  issue  affecting  many  ado-
lescents  worldwide.  Depression  in  adolescents  is  associated 
with  decreased  academic  performance,  school  dropout,  self- 
harm behaviours and increased suicide attempts (Brittain and 
Vaillancourt 2023; Thapar et al. 2012; Miller and Campo 2021). 
Suicidal tendencies, suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviour 
are major problems that can be seen in major depressive disor-
der (Lu et al. 2023). However, not every adolescent diagnosed 
with  major  depressive  disorder  develops  suicidal  thoughts, 
suicidal  behaviour  or  self- harm  behaviour  (Mullen,  2018; 
Crowell et al. 2012). This indicates that suicidal behaviour and 
self- harm are the result of the interaction of a series of addi-
tional factors beyond depression (Carballo et al. 2020).

Nonsuicidal  self- harm  behaviour  refers  to  the  deliberate,  so-
cially  unacceptable  and  direct  injury  to  one's  own  body  tissue 
without the intent to die. This behaviour is relatively common 
during adolescence, is a multifaceted phenomenon and signifies 
a  significant  health  problem  for  this  age  group.  Furthermore, 
self- harm behaviour is known to be a crucial risk factor for com-
pleted suicide (Weedage et al. 2025).

Alexithymia, which is identified as difficulty in recognizing, 
distinguishing  and  verbalizing  emotions,  is  a  symptom  that 
can  predispose  to  psychiatric  illnesses  and  is  not  defined  as 
a separate disease on its own (Hogeveen and Grafman 2021). 
Alexithymia  is  associated  with  many  psychiatric  diagnoses, 
including  autism  spectrum  disorders  (ASDs),  post- traumatic 
stress  disorder,  eating  disorders,  major  depressive  disorder, 
substance use disorders and anxiety disorders (Vuillier et al. 
2020).  As  well  as  being  defined  as  a  personality  trait,  alex-
ithymia  is  also  associated  with  a  deficiency  in  coping  skills 
that arise secondarily to a stressful situation. Extensive stud-
ies  have  found  that  alexithymia  is  associated  with  self- harm 
behaviour and suicide attempts (Bordalo and Carvalho 2022). 

Even when comorbid psychopathology is controlled, alexithy-
mia has been found to be associated with self- harm behaviour 
(Bordalo and Carvalho, 2022). Furthermore, the relationship 
between  self- harm  behaviour  and  alexithymia  in  adoles-
cents  is  found  to  be  more  pronounced  than  in  adults  (Oskis 
et  al.  2013;  Norman  et  al.  2020).  Although  alexithymia  can 
be a barrier to psychological treatment, there is evidence that 
alexithymia  can  be  altered  with  appropriate  interventions 
(Cameron et al. 2014; Norman et al. 2020).

Borderline personality disorder (BPD), characterized by extreme 
sensitivity  to  abandonment,  inconsistency  in  interpersonal  re-
lationships  and  self- perception,  mood  instability,  difficulty  in 
coping  with  negative  emotions  and  impulsivity,  is  a  Cluster  B 
personality disorder typically beginning in adolescence or early 
adulthood that leads to impaired functioning. Despite the long- 
standing consensus that personality disorder symptoms begin in 
childhood and adolescence, diagnosing BPD before the age of 18 
remains controversial (Leichsenring et al. 2024).

Clinicians usually hesitate to diagnose BPD in adolescents due to 
four primary concerns: first, the belief that BPD is not valid in ad-
olescence; second, that typical features of BPD, such as emotional 
instability or negative self- image, are normal among adolescents; 
third, the view that ongoing personality development impedes di-
agnosis; and fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the desire to 
protect their patients from stigma and pessimistic attitudes (Kaess 
et al. 2014). Despite all these discussions, early diagnosis of BPD 
will allow for the development of early interventions for the disor-
der (Bozzatello et al. 2021). This situation underscores the impor-
tance of recognizing the symptoms specific to adolescence. Many 
symptoms of this disorder can be commonly seen as personality 
traits in adolescents. Studies have found significant relationships 
between borderline personality traits and suicidal behaviour and 
nonsuicidal self- harm behaviours. Among adolescents with BPD, 
self- harm and suicidal behaviour have been found to be the most 
common symptoms of the disorder. Additionally, impulsivity and 
difficulties  in  coping  with  negative  emotions,  which  are  charac-
teristically  seen  in  individuals  with  BPD,  have  also  been  associ-
ated  with  suicidal  behaviour  (Mirkovic  et  al.  2021).  Apart  from 
self- harm and suicidal behaviour, some other symptoms are more 
frequently seen in adolescents with BPD than in adults with the 
disorder.  These  include  sudden  anger  outbursts,  substance  use, 
risky sexual behaviour, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, 
behavioural problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
symptoms (Kaess et al. 2014).

On the other hand, resilience, conceptualized as the process of ad-
aptation in the face of significant sources of stress such as distress, 
trauma, threat, familial and social stress factors, has a protective 
quality regarding suicidal and self- harm behaviours, contrary to 
the aforementioned risk factors (Tian et al. 2020). Resilience can 
mitigate the impact of risk factors effective on suicidal behaviour.

Considering all these effects, it is thought that resilience could be 
an important feature that can support interventions for individu-
als at risk for suicidal and self- harm behaviours (Nagra et al. 2016).

Given the prevalence of self- harm and suicidal behaviours in de-
pressed adolescents, it is important to identify individuals at risk 
for suicide or nonsuicidal self- harm behaviours. Identifying fac-
tors that increase the risk of nonsuicidal self- harm and suicidal 
behaviour in these individuals is significant because interven-
tions related to these factors can lead to a reduction in suicide 
rates (Hawton et al. 2013; Richardson et al. 2024).

This study aims to examine the factors that are thought to con-
tribute positively or negatively to suicidal behaviour and nonsui-
cidal self- harm behaviour in adolescents diagnosed with major 
depressive  disorder  in  Turkey.  We  hypothesize  that  depressed 
patients with suicidal or self- harm behaviour will have higher 
levels of borderline personality traits compared to those without 
such behaviour. Additionally, we expect that these patients will 
exhibit higher levels of alexithymia and lower levels of resilience 
compared  to  their  counterparts  without  suicidal  or  self- harm 
behaviour.

different self- harm types and evaluates 39 items for autonomous 
and social functions (Klonsky and Glenn 2009). The validity and 
reliability of the Turkish version have been confirmed according 
to the study conducted by Bildik et al. (2013).

2.3.2   |   Child Depression Inventory (CDI)

The  CDI,  developed  by  Kovacs  (1981)  based  on  the  Beck 
Depression Inventory, is a self- report scale with 27 items, each 
scored  between  0  and  2,  with  higher  scores  indicating  higher 
levels of depression. The Turkish version's validity and reliabil-
ity were confirmed by Öy (1991).

2.3.3   |   Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI)

The BPI, based on O. Kernberg's structural personality organi-
zation  theory  and  developed  by  Leichsenring  (1999),  consists 
of  53  yes/no  items  with  a  cut- off  score  of  15/16  (Leichsenring, 
1999).  The  validity  and  reliability  of  the  Turkish  version  were 
confirmed by Aydemir et al. (2006) in the study they published.

2   |   Method

2.1   |   Study Sample

This  prospective  study  consisted  of  adolescent  patients  who 
met  the  inclusion  criteria  and  were  referred  to  our  child  and 
adolescent  psychiatry  clinic  between  1  February  2023  and  1 
August 2023.

2.2   |   Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria were participants aged between 12 and18 years 
at  the  time  of  the  interview,  a  diagnosis  of  major  depressive 
disorder  according  to  the  DSM- 5  based  clinical  interview  and 
informed consent read and signed by both the participant and 
their legal guardian. Exclusion criteria included the presence of 
intellectual disability (ID), ASD, schizophrenia (SCH) or other 
related  psychotic  disorders  that  could  complicate  the  clinical 
interview,  as  well  as  any  general  medical  condition  that  could 
interfere with the clinical interview.

2.3   |   Data Collection Tools

Data  collection  involved  several  tools.  The  Sociodemographic 
Data  Form,  prepared  by  the  researchers,  was  used  to  collect 
sociodemographic  information  and  clinical  history.  This  form 
included questions on the participant's age, educational status, 
parental age, educational and income status, psychiatric history, 
duration of illness, self- harm and suicide attempts.

2.3.1   |   Inventory of Statements About Self- Injury (ISAS)

The  Inventory  of  Statements  About  Self- Injury  (ISAS),  devel-
oped by Klonsky and Glenn in 2009, assesses the frequency of 

2.3.4   |   Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS- 20)

The TAS- 20 is a self- report measure for assessing alexithymia, 
composed  of  three  subscales  and  using  a  5- point  Likert  scale 
(Bagby  et  al.  1994).  The  validity  and  reliability  of  the  Turkish 
version  of  the  validity  and  reliability  have  been  confirmed  by 
Sayer et al. (2001).

2.3.5   |   Child and Youth Resilience Measure- 12 
(CYRM- 12)

This scale, which allows for the collection of information about 
the  psychological  resilience  of  children  and  adolescents,  was 
developed  based  on  data  collected  from  11  different  countries 
(Liebenberg,  Ungar,  and  van  de  Vijver  2012).  The  original 
form of the scale consists of 28 items, three subscales and eight 
subdimensions.  The  short  form  of  the  scale  was  developed  by 
Liebenberg, Ungar and LeBlanc (2013) and consists of 12 items. 
The  measurement  tool  is  structured  in  a  5- point  Likert  scale, 
ranging  from  ‘Completely  describes  me  (5)’  to  ‘Does  not  de-
scribe me at all (1)’. Higher scores indicate higher levels of re-
silience. The validity and reliability study of the Turkish short 
form,  consisting  of  12  items,  was  conducted  by  Arslan  (2015) 
(Arslan 2015).

2.4   |   Ethical Approval and Informed Consent

Ethical  approval  for  the  study  was  obtained  from  the  Clinical 
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Health Sciences 
Erenköy  Mental  Health  and  Neurological  Diseases  Training 
and Research Hospital (Decision No. 07, dated 27 January 2023). 
Participants who met the inclusion criteria and visited the hospi-
tal between 1 February 2023 and 1 August 2023 were included in 
the study. The purpose of the study was explained to those who 
agreed to participate, and scales were administered to those who 

3 of 10

signed the informed consent form. The researcher was present 
while participants completed the scales and provided informa-
tion about the scales.

3   |   Statistical Analysis

Data  were  analysed  using  the  Statistical  Package  for  the  Social 
Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) version 25.0. Prior to analysis, the 
dataset was examined for missing data and outliers. Categorical 
variables were presented with case numbers and frequencies. The 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to check the normality of the 
data distribution. Continuous variables with normal distribution 
were  reported  as  means  and  standard  deviations,  while  non- 
normally  distributed  continuous  variables  were  reported  as  me-
dians and interquartile ranges (Q1–Q3). The chi- square test was 
used to compare categorical variables. MANCOVA was used for 
multiple  group  comparisons  of  continuous  variables,  controlling 
for one or more covariates. The Bonferroni method was applied in 
post hoc analyses to reduce the Type I error rate. Binary logistic re-
gression analysis was conducted to examine factors increasing the 
risk of nonsuicidal self- injury. Mediation analyses were performed 
using Hayes' Process Macro. A significance level of  p < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.

4   |   Results

A total of 185 participants diagnosed with major depressive disor-
der were initially screened for our study. Among these, 28 partic-
ipants were excluded based on specific exclusion criteria: 20 had 
ID, 16 had ASD and 2 had SCH, with some participants meeting 
multiple exclusion criteria. From the remaining 157 participants, 4 
chose to withdraw from the study without providing any reasons, 

resulting in 153 participants who completed the study. Of these, 51 
had never engaged in self- harm behaviour or attempted suicide, 
51 had engaged in self- harm behaviour at least once but had not 
attempted suicide and 51 had both engaged in self- harm behaviour 
and attempted suicide. The flow diagram illustrating the inclusion 
process of the participants is presented in Figure 1. The sociode-
mographic  data  comparison  of  the  participants  is  presented  in 
Table 1. According to the results, there were no significant differ-
ences among the three groups in terms of average age, gender, birth 
season, family structure and family income (all p- values > 0.05).

Table 2 presents the data on the types and frequencies of self- 
harm behaviour among participants with a history of self- harm. 
According to the results, the most common form of self- harm is 
cutting the body (84.3%). This is followed by scratching (72.5%) 
and deliberately hitting the body against a hard surface (66.7%).

The data comparing CYMR- 12, BPI and TAS- total scores between 
groups according to the presence of NSSI are presented in Table 3, 
with CDI scores controlled. The established model was found to 
be statistically significant (p < 0.001). When CDI scale scores were 
controlled, it was found that there was a significant difference in 
CYMR- 12 scores between groups based on the presence of NSSI 
(p < 0.001).  When  the  groups  were  compared  among  themselves 
in  terms  of  CYMR- 12  scores,  the  mean  score  of  those  who  had 
never engaged in self- harm behaviour or attempted suicide (36.55) 
was  found  to  be  significantly  higher  than  the  other  two  groups. 
However, there was no significant difference between the mean 
scores of those who had engaged in self- harm behaviour at least 
once but had not attempted suicide (32.83) and those who had both 
engaged  in  self- harm  behaviour  and  attempted  suicide  (31.03). 
Similarly,  it  was  found  that  there  was  a  significant  difference 
between the groups in terms of BPI scores (p < 0.001). When the 
groups were compared among themselves in terms of BPI scores,

the mean score of those who had never engaged in self- harm be-
haviour or attempted suicide (19.26) was found to be lower than 
that of the group of those who had engaged in self- harm behaviour 
at least once but had not attempted suicide group (24.91). The mean 
score  of  those  who  had  engaged  in  self- harm  behaviour  at  least 
once but had not attempted suicide was also found to be lower than 
that of those who had both engaged in self- harm behaviour and at-
tempted suicide (29.28). Furthermore, it was found that there was 
a significant difference between the groups in terms of TAS- total 

scores (p = 0.005). When the groups were compared among them-
selves in terms of TAS- total scores, the mean score of those who 
had  never  engaged  in  self- harm  behaviour  or  attempted  suicide 
(63.98) was found to be significantly lower than that of those who 
had both engaged in self- harm behaviour and attempted suicide 
(70.65). However, the mean score of those who had engaged in self- 
harm behaviour at least once but had not attempted suicide (66.22) 
was not significantly different from the other two groups.

The  results  of  the  binary  logistic  regression  analysis  conducted 
to identify the factors predicting the probability of NSSI are pre-
sented  in  Table  4.  The  logistic  regression  model  shows  good  fit 
(Hosmer and Lemeshow p > 0.05) and explains 28.8% of the varia-
tion in the dependent variable (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.288). According 
to the model, the level of borderline personality traits significantly 
increases the likelihood of individuals engaging in self- injurious 
behaviour (p < 0.001, OR = 1.115). However, the level of psycholog-
ical resilience significantly decreases the likelihood of individuals 
engaging  in  self- injurious  behaviour  (p = 0.014,  OR = 0.927).  On 
the other hand, the level of alexithymia does not have a significant 
effect on self- injurious behaviour (p > 0.05).

To  determine  whether  borderline  personality  traits  mediate  the 
relationship between alexithymia and NSSI, a mediation analysis 
was conducted using Hayes' method. This analysis was performed 
on participants with a history of NSSI (n = 102). In this analysis, a 
model was developed in which the level of alexithymia (measured 
by TAS- Total score) was the independent variable (X), the severity

of NSSI (measured by the ISAS) was the dependent variable (Y) 
and borderline personality traits (measured by the BPI) were the 
mediator variable (M). The results of the mediation test regression 
analysis are presented in Table 5, and the data related to the medi-
ation model are presented in Figure 2.

Accordingly, TAS- total scores significantly predicted BPF scores 
(b = 0.440,  p < 0.001).  Additionally,  in  the  model  that  included 
TAS- total scores, the BPF score significantly predicted the NSSI 
Inventory  score  (b = 0.676,  p < 0.001).  The  mediating  effect  of 
the severity of borderline personality traits on the relationship 
between alexithymia severity and NSSI severity was determined 

based  on  confidence  intervals  obtained  using  the  ‘bootstrap’ 
technique. Accordingly, it was found that the severity of border-
line  personality  traits  mediated  the  relationship  between  alex-
ithymia and NSSI severity (b = 0.298, 95% CI [0.100–0.415]).

5   |   Discussion

This  study  investigated  the  relationship  between  NSSI,  SUI, 
borderline  personality  traits,  alexithymia  and  resilience  in  ado-
lescents  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder.  Our  major 
findings  revealed  that  adolescents  who  engaged  in  NSSI  and/

into  three  distinct  groups  based  on  self- harm  behaviour  and 
suicidal  ideation,  He  et  al.  identified  two  subgroups  within  a 
Chinese adolescent population, highlighting the nuanced rela-
tionship between major depressive disorder and self- harm; spe-
cifically, we observed that individuals in the group of those who 
had never engaged in self- harm behaviour or attempted suicide, 
exhibited significantly higher psychological resilience and lower 
borderline  personality  traits  compared  to  those  who  had  both 
engaged in self- harm behaviour and attempted suicide, contrast-
ing with He et al.'s emphasis on the sociopsychological factors, 
such as peer victimization and family background, influencing 
the likelihood of high suicidal ideation in their NSSI subgroups 
(He et al. 2023).

When the results from the study of Cao et al. also compared with 
our findings, which included analysis of alexithymia, childhood 
trauma and body investment on NSSI behaviours in adolescents 
with depressive disorder, we observed both similarities and dif-
ferences.  Our  study,  which  involved  153  participants,  revealed 
significant  differences  in  psychological  resilience  and  border-
line  personality  traits  among  groups  based  on  their  self- harm 
behaviour and suicidal ideation. In contrast, the study on child-
hood  trauma  and  body  investment  included  225  participants 
and highlighted how lower scores on measures of body care and 
higher exposure to childhood emotional abuse were predictive 
of  NSSI  behaviours  (Cao  et  al.  2024).  While  both  studies  em-
phasize the role of psychological factors in NSSI, our research 
underscores  the  mediating  role  of  borderline  personality  traits 
between alexithymia and self- injurious behaviours, whereas the 
other  study  focuses  more  on  the  impact  of  childhood  trauma 
and  body  investment  as  independent  predictors  of  NSSI.  This 
suggests that while our findings point to the importance of per-
sonality traits in understanding NSSI, the other study identifies 
childhood experiences and body investment as crucial diagnos-
tic and predictive factors in adolescents with depressive disorder.

The findings from the study by Tang et al., which investigated 
the roles of alexithymia and depression in predicting NSSI, have 
alignments especially in terms of alexithymia and NSSI severity. 
Both studies recognize the significant predictive power of alex-
ithymia  and  depression  on  NSSI;  however,  while  our  research 
indicates that borderline personality traits mediate the relation-
ship  between  alexithymia  and  NSSI  severity,  the  other  study 
underscores that depression fully mediates the relationship be-
tween alexithymia and NSSI (Tang et al. 2022). This highlights 
the complex interplay of personality traits and emotional regu-
lation in NSSI, suggesting that interventions may benefit from 
considering both intrapersonal vulnerabilities and broader psy-
chological frameworks, as proposed by Nock's integrated model.

Our  study's  findings  align  with  the  existing  literature  on  the 
interplay  between  emotional  regulation,  personality  features 
and  NSSI  in  adolescents  (Chen  et  al.  2023;  Zhang  et  al.  2023; 
Sleuwaegen et al. 2017). High prevalence rates of NSSI are ob-
served among depressed adolescents, often linked to borderline 
personality  features  and  difficulties  in  emotional  regulation. 
Alexithymia emerges as a critical predictor of NSSI, suggesting 
that  adolescents  with  difficulties  identifying  and  expressing 
their emotions are at increased risk for self- injurious behaviours. 
This  indicates  a  need  for  targeted  interventions  that  enhance 
emotional awareness and regulation, addressing the underlying

(n = 102). The figure illustrates the mediation model examining the role 
of Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI) scores in the relationship be-
tween Toronto Alexithymia Scale- Total (TAS- TOTAL) scores and Self- 
Injury Severity (ISAS) scores. The overall indirect effect (a*b) is signif-
icant with b = 0.298b = 0.298b = 0.298, 95% CI [0.100, 0.415], indicating

or  had  suicidal  tendencies  exhibited  higher  levels  of  borderline 
personality traits and alexithymia, along with lower levels of re-
silience.  Specifically,  those  who  had  both  engaged  in  self- harm 
behaviour and attempted suicide had the highest borderline per-
sonality  traits  and  alexithymia  scores  and  the  lowest  resilience 
scores  compared  to  those  who  had  engaged  in  self- harm  be-
haviour at least once but had not attempted suicide and those who 
had never engaged in self- harm behaviour or attempted suicide.

The  results  of  this  study  underscore  the  complex  interplay  of 
psychological  factors  that  contribute  to  self- harm  and  suicidal 
behaviours  in  depressed  adolescents.  The  higher  levels  of  bor-
derline  personality  traits  and  alexithymia  in  adolescents  who 
engage in NSSI and suicidal behaviours suggest that these traits 
may  increase  the  risk  of  self- harm.  Conversely,  resilience  ap-
pears to buffer against these risks, highlighting its importance 
as  a  target  for  intervention.  The  mediating  role  of  borderline 
personality  traits  between  alexithymia  and  NSSI  further  sug-
gests that interventions aimed at reducing borderline personal-
ity traits could potentially mitigate the impact of alexithymia on 
self- harm behaviours.

Our  findings  align  with  previous  research  highlighting  the 
strong  association  between  borderline  personality  traits  and 
self- harm behaviours in adolescents. Previous studies have con-
sistently shown that individuals with higher borderline person-
ality traits are more prone to engage in NSSI and exhibit suicidal 
tendencies (Mirkovic et al. 2021). The observed association be-
tween alexithymia and self- harm behaviours in our study is also 
supported by earlier research, which indicates that difficulty in 
recognizing  and  expressing  emotions  can  predispose  individ-
uals  to  self- injurious  behaviour  (Bordalo  and  Carvalho  2022). 
Moreover,  our  finding  that  resilience  serves  as  a  protective 
factor against NSSI and suicidal behaviours corroborates prior 
studies  that  emphasize  the  role  of  resilience  in  mitigating  the 
impact  of  stress  and  reducing  the  likelihood  of  self- harm  and 
suicide (Nagra et al. 2016).

In  comparing  the  findings  of  our  study  with  those  of  He 
et al. (2023), we found that while our study classified participants 

personality  traits  contributing  to  NSSI.  Collectively,  these  in-
sights  emphasize  the  importance  of  incorporating  emotional 
and personality assessments in clinical treatment strategies for 
adolescents at risk of NSSI.

The findings regarding the types and frequencies of self- harm 
behaviour among participants align with existing literature on 
the subject. Cutting the body emerges as the most prevalent form 
of self- harm, reported by 84.3% of individuals with a history of 
self- harm. This is followed by scratching, reported by 72.5%, and 
deliberately  hitting  the  body  against  a  hard  surface,  reported 
by  66.7%.  These  results  are  consistent  with  previous  studies, 
which also identify cutting as the most common method of self- 
injury  among  adolescents  and  adults  (Uh  et  al.  2021;  Klonsky 
and Glenn 2009). The high prevalence of these behaviours un-
derscores  the  need  for  targeted  interventions  that  address  the 
specific types of self- harm most frequently used by individuals 
at risk.

Our  study's  findings  align  with  and  extend  the  existing  litera-
ture on the psychological mechanisms underlying non- suicidal 
self- injury and cognitive- emotional dysfunctions in adolescents. 
Like Li et al., who found that core self- evaluation negatively pre-
dicted cognitive failure with alexithymia and depression acting 
as partial mediators, our results also emphasize the mediating 
role of emotional dysregulation processes in maladaptive behav-
iors  (Li  et  al.  2025).  Fasolato  et  al.  similarly  highlighted  more 
severe  alexithymia  and  emotional  dysregulation  in  inpatient 
adolescents engaging in NSSI, echoing your findings regarding 
heightened emotional vulnerability and poor affective process-
ing  in  more  clinically  severe  cases  (Fasolato  et  al.  2025).  Wen 
et al. and Li et al. both identified alexithymia as a critical medi-
ator linking adverse experiences (bullying or trauma) to NSSI, 
with Wen et al. also underscoring the role of rumination in this 
process (Wen et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024). These findings resonate 
with your observation of how emotional processing deficits may 
contribute  to  self- harming  behaviors,  particularly  among  vul-
nerable populations. Additionally, Goger et al. noted the lack of 
replicated mediator studies in suicide prevention research, rein-
forcing the importance of your contribution in identifying alex-
ithymia, depression, and other cognitive- emotional variables as 
robust mediators (Goger et al.  2025). Together, this body of ev-
idence  supports  a  growing  consensus  that  targeting  emotional 
awareness  and  regulation,  especially  in  the  presence  of  poor 
self- evaluation  or  trauma,  is  essential  for  preventing  NSSI  in 
adolescents. This study addresses critical knowledge gaps in un-
derstanding the interplay between borderline personality traits, 
resilience and self- harm behaviours in adolescents with MDD. 
Given the high prevalence and severe consequences of self- harm 
and suicidal behaviours in this population, it is essential to iden-
tify and understand the underlying factors contributing to these 
behaviours.  Addressing  these  knowledge  gaps  can  inform  the 
development of more effective, targeted interventions and pre-
ventative  measures,  ultimately  improving  outcomes  for  at- risk 
adolescents.  By  shedding  light  on  these  relationships,  this  re-
search contributes to the broader literature and underscores the 
need for continued exploration and innovation in mental health 
strategies for adolescents.

personality traits, alexithymia and resilience either individually 
or  in  pairs.  However,  our  study  is,  to  our  knowledge,  the  first 
to  simultaneously  assess  all  three  variables—borderline  traits, 
alexithymia and resilience—across three distinct groups of de-
pressed patients: those with no self- harm, those with nonsuicidal 
self- harm and those with suicidal self- harm. This multidimen-
sional and comparative approach allows for a more nuanced un-
derstanding of the interrelationships among these psychological 
factors and their association with self- harm behaviour.

Moreover,  our  findings  suggest  that  borderline  traits  inde-
pendently  increase  the  risk  of  self- harm,  and  that  alexithymia 
plays  a  mediating  role  in  the  relationship  between  emotional 
regulation  and  self- harm.  These  insights  underscore  the  crit-
ical  importance  of  considering  personality  traits—often  un-
deremphasized  in  the  psychiatric  assessment  of  children  and 
adolescents—as  potential  predictors  of  self- harm  behaviour. 
We believe these contributions offer meaningful advancements 
to  the  current  body  of  research  on  self- harm  in  depressive 
populations.

This study has several strengths, including its focus on a clinical 
sample of adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder 
and its comprehensive assessment of multiple psychological fac-
tors. However, the study is not without limitations. The cross- 
sectional  design  limits  the  ability  to  infer  causality,  and  the 
self- report  nature  of  the  measures  may  be  subject  to  response 
biases.  Furthermore,  the  study  sample  was  limited  to  adoles-
cents from Turkey, which may limit the generalizability of the 
findings to other cultural contexts.

6   |   Conclusion

In conclusion, this study highlights the significant role of border-
line personality traits, alexithymia and resilience in influencing 
self- harm and suicidal behaviours in adolescents with major de-
pressive disorder. The findings suggest that interventions aimed 
at  enhancing  resilience  and  addressing  borderline  personality 
traits and alexithymia could be beneficial in reducing the risk of 
self- harm and suicidal behaviours in this population. Future re-
search should consider longitudinal designs to further elucidate 
the causal relationships between these psychological factors and 
self- harm  behaviours  and  explore  the  effectiveness  of  targeted 
interventions in diverse cultural settings.
