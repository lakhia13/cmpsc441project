Abstract
The COVID-19 public health emergency created an aversive environment for people all around the world. Acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT), born of behavior analysis, can help address some of these problems by encouraging behavioral
change and increasing psychological flexibility. The mindful action plan (MAP) is designed to create a simple approach to
utilizing the ACT principles. The MAP utilizes the traditional ACT hexagon model and provides a checklist for learning and
following through on the 6 components that, when combined, lead to psychological flexibility. The MAP guides people to act in
the direction of their values and to be influenced by their verbal behavior while saying, “I am here now, accepting my feelings and
noticing my thoughts while doing what I care about.” Specific instructions and exercises are provided so the MAP can be used by
behavior analysts to assist their actions during stressful and anxiety-provoking times.

“I am here now, accepting my feelings and noticing my
thoughts while doing what I care about.” The verbal behavior
in this phrase sets the occasion for values-based responses in
the presence of aversive stimuli. When things are difficult—as
they are now for all of us faced with the social, economic, and
personal upheaval caused by the COVID-19 public health
emergency (hereafter referred to as the pandemic)—orienting
toward what matters most to us helps us find our footing and
move forward. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT;
Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2012) can assist behavior analysts

during this pandemic by providing a framework for address-
ing the kinds of aversive private events that often evoke es-
cape or avoidance behavior. Such experiential avoidance may
provide relief from uncomfortable private events in the short
term, but it can also create a barrier to contacting larger and
more delayed reinforcement in the long term. ACT focuses on
helping individuals live meaningful, values-directed lives
even under the most difficult of circumstances. Now more
than ever, this focus is needed.

ACT has been applied to many clinical concerns, such as
anxiety (Kelson, Rollin, Ridout, & Campbell, 2019), and sub-
stance abuse (Ii et al., 2019), and has a substantial evidence
base across diagnostic categories (A-Tjak et al., 2015). ACT
also contributes more generally to well-being (Howell &
Passmore, 2019). ACT training (ACTraining, e.g., Little,
Tarbox, & Alzaabi, 2020; Moran, 2015) has emerged as a
framework for teaching skills to help individuals live more
meaningful lives, whether that be in one’s personal or profes-
sional spheres. For example, applications of ACTraining in
the workplace have demonstrated a significant influence on
improving productivity, reducing errors, accelerating leader-
ship skills, and acquiring new skills from recent training
(Moran, 2011). ACTraining has also been shown to result in
improved client engagement by direct care workers in applied
behavior analysis (ABA; Castro, Rehfeldt, & Root, 2016) and

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

has improved the use of behavioral skills training by staff
trainers (Little et al., 2020).

Both ACT and ACTraining have a primary aim to increase

psychological flexibility, which is the ability to

contact the present moment while also being aware of
thoughts and emotions—without trying to change those
private experiences or be adversely controlled by
them—and depending upon the situation, persisting in
or changing behavior in the pursuit of values and goals.
(Moran, 2015, p. 26)

Doorley et al. (2020) define psychological flexibility as “the
ability to pursue valued life aims despite the presence of pain”
(p. 2). Key to both these definitions is the focus on one behav-
ing in line with his or her pursuit of larger, long-term rein-
forcers, despite the presence of aversive private events.

When one is faced with stress, crisis, and trauma—whether
personal or global—aversive private events will occur.
Uncomfortable conditioned and unconditioned responses of
fear, sadness, and worry (i.e., feelings) are elicited, along with
private verbal behavior (i.e., thoughts) evoked by both envi-
ronmental stimuli and our own emotional responses. That ver-
bal behavior in turn transforms the stimulus functions of en-
vironmental events, which then elicit and evoke even more
aversive feelings and thoughts. Oftentimes, our culturally re-
inforced response is to try to avoid all of it. It is an unwinnable
cycle.

A complete explication of complex human behavior and
the impact of trauma is beyond the scope of this article (c.f.
Walser & Westrup, 2007). It is self-evident that behavior an-
alysts often work under stressful conditions in typical circum-
stances, and the pandemic has highlighted the need for us to
have tools to handle the significant increase in stress. Whether
we are discussing the typical stress of working with individ-
uals with severe challenging behaviors, the new stress of con-
tinuing to provide essential services where social distancing is
unfeasible, the anxiety of isolation, the frustrations of having
to deal with telehealth technology, or the worries about receiv-
ing the next paycheck, behavior analysts are certainly faced
with aversive situations. Under the current conditions, we all
need help improving skills for psychological flexibility and
for acting effectively toward valued living. ACT provides
such a framework for behavior change.

The traditional method of applying ACT is using the ACT
hexagon model (see Fig. 1); the six components of the hexa-
gon include (a) self-as-context, (b) contact with the present
moment, (c) acceptance, (d) defusion, (e) committed action,
and (f) values. Each of these components is skills based and
contributes to psychological flexibility, whether taught within
a therapeutic context or in ACTraining (e.g., in an organiza-
tional behavior management context). The mindful action
plan (MAP), rooted in ACT, creates a checklist with these

six component skills to help build psychological flexibility:
(a) I am (b) here now, (c) accepting the way I feel and (d)
noticing my thoughts while (e) doing (f) what I care about.

Checklists have been shown to assist productivity
(Gawande, 2011) and can contribute to organizational behav-
ior management initiatives (Bacon, Fulton, & Malott, 1982).
As a checklist, the MAP (Fig. 2; bit.ly/MindfulActionPlan)
can help individuals stay committed to the six processes of
utilizing ACT for self-directed activities. You are encouraged
to print out a copy of the MAP and follow along with the
instructions throughout this article to get the most out of your
reading. Doing this exercise with pen and paper can make this
process more impactful (see Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014).
The ACT statement is printed at the top of the MAP, and
Table 1 demonstrates the point-to-point relationship that the
six components of the MAP have with the six components of
the ACT hexagon model. Basically, the MAP is a simplified
version of ACT, with the integration of reminders related to
performance management principles, which are fundamental
to traditional behavior analysis. The MAP can be used for
many different human endeavors, including group psycho-
therapy (Westrup & Wright, 2017) and safety endeavors
(Moran, 2013). This article will focus on how the MAP can
assist ABA professionals in learning the skills to harmonize
productivity and self-care during the pandemic. With the
MAP and ACT, ABA can help applied behavior analysts.

ACT and the Components of the MAP

Self-as-Context: I Am

Self-as-context skills aim to build psychological flexibility by
shaping an individuals’ perspective taking on who they are
and how they describe themselves. ACT teaches people to
come in contact with the experience that they are a verbally
skilled individual, and therefore, has a consistent perspective
from which they experience all changing events, and that such
a perspective remains unchanged by these events. The per-
spective of self-as-context (also known as “the observing
you” or “pure awareness”) helps individuals let go of any
self-descriptions that are unhelpful to values-based action.
For example, during the pandemic, a Board Certified
Behavior Analyst (BCBA) who works 60 hr a week at the
clinic that she founded is told that she needs to close her
facility for a month due to state guidelines to shelter in place.
She immediately starts having private verbalizations describ-
ing her current sense of herself given the anxiety-provoking
situation: “I am a hard worker and must continue to be mas-
sively productive during this shutdown! I have to write articles
and publish data while the clinic is shuttered!” Such state-
ments, which reflect her previous ideas about her professional
role and what it means to be a good behavior analyst, may lead

332

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

her to develop an unhealthy work process. Given the global
influence of the health crisis, the BCBA may be trying to
measure up to an ideal work rate given the new “time off”
from work, but because of the ubiquitous uncertainty about
the state of the world, and palpable environmental obstacles to
productivity, she may begin judging that her productivity is
not enough. ACTraining invites individuals to simply observe
their unhelpful self-talk and take a wider point of view on who
they are. ACT helps you learn to identify that you are not your
roles, titles, emotions, sensations, thoughts, or urges, but that
these are simply experiences you have. This perspective al-
lows the person to behave more flexibly in the presence of
these stimulus events that could increase stress levels. Such
psychological flexibility allows individuals to engage in
values-based actions for self-compassion and sets the occa-
sion for people to actually not be driven to work themselves
to exhaustion because they are no longer attached to labels
such as “a hard worker” or “massively productive.”

The “I am” component of the MAP comports with the
perspective of self-as-context and gives this suggestion:
Notice if you are being influenced by any unhelpful self-de-
scriptions. Let go of any problematic thoughts that you are
believing about yourself.

Letting go is certainly easier said than done, but it is a
skill that can be learned, practiced, and continually im-
proved. Try this:

Take a few moments to sit quietly and focus on your
breathing. Bring up a memory of something you were

doing 1 year ago and try to remember it as vividly as you
can. Imagine you are watching a movie from your per-
spective of what was happening back then. See the
sights and hear the sounds. Make it very clear to yourself
that you were there, then, experiencing that. Continue
viewing that memory for a few more moments before
reading more of this exercise. After watching these
thoughts, take another slow inhale and make it very
clear to yourself that you are here, now, experiencing
this. Immerse yourself in this experiential fact:
Something about you has been you throughout your life.
The experience of “you” that is here now was there then
in the memory from last year. There is something about
all verbally skilled people that sets up a context for us to
perceive events from a “self.” This experience has been
available to you throughout your life after you started
acquiring verbal behavior skills and getting social rein-
forcement for talking about your responses to the envi-
ronment. You were, and continue to be, reinforced for
making statements about your environment-behavior in-
teractions by saying “I am . . .” You may make state-
ments describing your roles, body, emotions, and sen-
sations, such as “I am a behavior analyst,” “I am tall,” “I
am happy,” and “I am nauseous.” Those statements vary
from each other, but they all include perspective taking
and the phrase “I am.” Can you—in this exercise right
now—come as fully into contact with that “I am” expe-
rience? At the very core, you are not your roles, body,
emotions, or sensations. You are the context within
which you have those experiences. The “I am” core to

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

The Mindful Action Plan

Notice if you are being influenced by any unhelpful self-descriptions. Let go of any 
problematic thoughts that you are believing about yourself.

Center your situational awareness on what you are doing. Notice what is happening 
here and now, and rather than getting wrapped up in events not in your present 
control, let go of these distracting events. Focus on what is relevant to your actions.

Allow yourself to acknowledge any emotions you are having without trying to 
control the emotions. Be willing to simply have those feelings while moving 
forward with valuable actions.

Prepare to simply notice thoughts that arise while moving forward with your valued 
actions. Let those thoughts go if they are not helpful. Treat distracting thoughts as 
disconnected from action while choosing to act in a meaningful manner.

-- Personal Values: Describe your motivation for engaging in your chosen actions  
    and why you aim for optimal performance.

Fig. 2. The mindful action plan

your verbal behavior remains solid and is unbroken and
unchanged throughout your life. Take a moment in this
exercise to fully ground yourself in the “I am” experi-
ence. And now, turn to letting go of the other verbal self-
descriptions. The core “you” is not “a behavior analyst”
or “tall.” Those are verbal descriptions of a role that you

engage in and the relative size of your body. Those
verbalizations are not you. Can you also let go of other
verbalizations from the “I am” perspective? Can you
simply notice that you have a history of tacting “happy”
when a temporary emotion is present and that such a
description is not of you but of a temporary feeling?

The same can go for the sensation of being “nauseous.”
Sensations, emotions, and other private events come and
go, and therefore you can build a skill of relating differ-
ently to the verbalization about these experiences and let
go of those events being you. When faced with stress
and psychological inflexibility, aim to come back to that
steadfast context of the “I am” experience, while letting
go of other descriptions related to the self and other
private events.

Present Moment Mindfulness: Here Now

Contact with the present moment relates to the core concepts
of mindfulness and meditation training. “Now” is the only
time people can engage in any response; however, according
to Killingsworth and Gilbert (2010), for 47% of the day, peo-
ple are attending to something other than their current actions.
The human ability to engage in verbal behavior gives people
the skills for remembering past events, comparing the current
situation to an ideal situation, and planning future actions.
This repertoire pays handsome dividends but also can prevent
individuals from paying attention to what is going on in the
current moment. This is the downside to verbal behavior. For
example, during the pandemic, a Board Certified Assistant
Behavior Analyst who has been deemed an essential worker
at the residential facility where she is employed worries
throughout the day if she is exposing her clients to the virus
or if she is going to expose her family to the virus. She worries
that she is not doing a good enough job with her clients and
that she is not doing enough to help her child with his virtual
school lessons. She ruminates, “What if I get sick and can’t
work? How will I protect my family, and what will we do for
income?” At home, when trying to help her son, she finds
herself worrying about whether or not she disinfected properly
when she left the residential facility and snaps at him when he
asks about his math problems.

These private verbal events influence her to focus on things
not in her present control, and in turn, reduce her focus on
executing behavior that is in her control: following safety
protocols, doing a good job as a behavior analyst supervising

staff and managing behavior plans, and being present with her
son. Her distracted thoughts lead her to occasionally stare off
into space with worry, and her managers begin noticing that
she is not interacting as much with the clients who need her
assistance. Her psychological inflexibility with respect to her
thoughts and actions is actually exacerbating her problems.
The more she worries about doing a good enough job at work
or at home, the worse her performance actually is. Engaging in
mindfulness exercises from an ACTraining perspective can
assist her to attend to the present moment—which is the only
time she can take effective action—and help her engage in
effective committed actions related to her values.

The “here now” component to the MAP comports with the
contact with the present moment, and gives this directive:
Center your situational awareness on what you are doing.
Notice what is happening here and now, and rather than get-
ting wrapped up in events that are not in your present control,
let go of these distracting events. Focus on what is relevant to
your actions.

It may seem very difficult right now to focus on any-
thing at all, but again, this is a skill to be learned. Try this
now:
Take a moment to embrace what is happening in this
moment. Contact your five senses. Look at five things
you can see, and realize that you are seeing them now.
Observe what you can smell and taste, and realize that
you are engaging in those actions right now. Touch
something, even if that just means sensing the clothes
on your skin or your body in the chair, and simply ob-
serve your sense of touch right now. Listen. Hear three
things if you can. Attempt to perceive a sound close by,
one from a middle distance, and one from far away, and
realize that you are doing this in the present moment. Be
in this present moment. Reorienting your attention to
being here now is a skill, and it is a worthy capability
to pursue because, whereas your verbal behavior may
influence you to focus on past and future events, your
behavior only happens in the present moment. If you
can link your values to what you do with your response,
then it can be highly reinforcing to continue to use the
skills that keep you in the present moment because the
“here now” is the only time and place behavior happens.

Acceptance: Accepting

Acceptance skills contribute to psychological flexibility by
influencing individuals to behave successfully in the presence
of private events (e.g., sensations and emotions) that are com-
monly perceived as stressful (Hayes, Wilson, Gifford,
Follette, & Strosahl, 1996). During ACTraining, individuals
acquire the skills to view and relate with private psychological

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

335

experiences as natural reactions to environmental stimuli and
learn that such feelings, urges, and sensations do not need to
be escaped or avoided. The ACT perspective advocates that
willingly coming in contact with such private events and ex-
periences is healthier and allows the individual to behave
more effectively. Engaging in responses to escape or avoid
private experiences may actually contribute to ineffective
and potentially clinically relevant behavior (Boeschen, Koss,
Figuerdo, & Coan, 2001; Roemer, Litz, Orsillo, & Wagner,
2001). For instance, during the pandemic, when a registered
behavior technician is told that the clinic where he is
employed has to close indefinitely, this loss of connecting
with his students and coworkers, and the potential loss of
income, can elicit fear responses. If he engages in fear avoid-
ance by drinking copious amounts of alcohol, he may be cut-
ting himself off from opportunities for engaging in other
values-based activities, such as engaging in his hobbies or
interacting more with his family, because he is intoxicated
more frequently or dealing with feeling hungover.
ACTraining aims to develop a willingness to experience a
range of psychological events—such as stress—so avoidance
responses do not divert the person’s performance from values-
based ends.

The “accepting” component of the MAP comports with
acceptance in the ACT model and gives the following recom-
mendation: Allow yourself to acknowledge the emotions you
are feeling without trying to control the emotions. Be willing
to simply have those feelings while moving forward with
valuable actions.

We will keep saying it—this too is a skill that can be
learned. Even if accepting your difficult emotions right
now seems impossible, you can learn to do so.
Acceptance is often taught with metaphor in ACT
(Törneke, 2017), and the following exercise can be ap-
plicable for any uncomfortable emotion you are
experiencing, such as rage, grief, or exhaustion. Before
beginning, make a point of tacting your most recent
painful feeling and contact the experience of having an
emotion you find aversive. Attempt to apply this meta-
phorical exercise to this feeling:
Focus on how you are feeling right now, especially the
challenging emotions and sensations that are coming up
at this time. Perhaps you feel anxious, sad, angry, or
dull, and you might be interacting with these private
events as if they were aversive, or with personal experi-
ences you are working to avoid. Can you perceive these
emotions and sensations as things that are uncomfort-
ably attached to you and inescapable? Imagine the ex-
perience is truly a ball and chain. Don’t just think of it
figuratively, but rather imagine—as literally as you
can—that you are burdened with a 17th-century shackle
that was used on prisoners. Come in contact with the

weight, the discomfort, and the difficulty in dealing with
this thing that you do not want and did not ask for. As
you try to live your day moving around your environ-
ment, this ball and chain prevents you from traveling in
your valued directions. You try to escape from the man-
acles, but the harder you pull and the faster you try to run
away, the more exhausting and painful they become.
What can be done when you are shackled to this burden?
Consider doing something unconventional and counter-
intuitive: Accept the burden. What if you willingly
allowed yourself to fully come in contact with that thing
you are trying to escape? What if you looked at the ball
and chain directly, and then picked it up with both
hands, and held it close to you? What if you accepted
its presence, fully and without defense, to the point of
embracing it? Can you then cradle the ball and chain
tightly under your arm, the way a mother holds a new-
born? What would then happen to your movement
around your environment as you travel in your valued
directions? Accepting that which you find aversive, em-
bracing it, and holding it closely can assist you in en-
gaging in vital and meaningful behaviors.

Defusion: Noticing

Defusion skills assist individuals to observe their own private
verbal behavior (i.e., thinking) without being governed by it.
In contrast, fusion is when private verbal behavior rigidly
directs an individual’s actions (Blackledge, 2007). It is impos-
sible to “control” one’s thoughts (as anyone who has tried not
to think of a pink elephant can testify to), especially in stress-
ful environments, and such environments are likely to evoke
unproductive or unhelpful thoughts. For instance, consider a
director of a preschool who thinks to herself, “This world is a
mess, and nothing matters anymore!” If she is fused to her
thoughts, those stimulus events might occasion her to engage
in actions that have a deleterious impact on her career goals.
She might resist writing up case notes that were due last week,
prevent herself from establishing her clinic’s first teleconfer-
encing meeting, and avoid taking advantage of free online
continuing education opportunities. ACTraining teaches
defusion skills to help individuals mindfully witness unpro-
ductive thoughts, and encourages individuals to engage in
purposeful action in the occurrence of these verbal hindrances.
The “noticing” component of the MAP comports with
defusion in the ACT model and gives this recommendation:
Prepare to simply notice thoughts that arise while moving
forward with your valued actions. Let those thoughts go if
they are not helpful. Treat distracting thoughts as disconnect-
ed from action while choosing to act in a meaningful manner.
The mindfulness exercise we introduced earlier is a good

place to begin with practicing this skill. Let us extend that.

336

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

Find an environment where you can take a few moments
to engage in a simple and brief mindfulness exercise.
Begin by repeating the aforementioned tasks for
contacting the present moment. Become aware of your
five senses. Take this opportunity to taste, see, hear,
smell, and feel something.
Now become aware of private verbal behavior that ac-
companies these behaviors. While engaged in sensing,
do you also have thoughts about your behaviors and
what you are sensing? Throughout our lives as verbally
able adults, the private events of thoughts are going to
happen with a great deal of regularity. Human beings
fluently make judgments, descriptions, or evaluations
about their environment and their own responses.
These private verbal events often govern overt behavior,
but they do not have to cause behaviors to happen.
Behavior analysis adamantly denies the causality of
thinking on overt actions, and mindfulness traditions
agree.
Can you simply notice that you are making judgments,
descriptions, and evaluations? When you have a
thought, rule, or provocative idea, you are invited to
simply observe these events that are not in your control
(and that are not in control of you). Imagine that your
thoughts were sounds from a disc jockey on the radio
and that you cannot turn off the radio or change the
channel. Recall a real-life experience you had when
the radio was playing, and you could hear it, but you
were not listening to it. The sounds were there, and you
could focus on them if you chose to, but they were not of
interest to you, so you went about your business while
the disc jockey introduced the next unstimulating song.
You can notice that these events happen but not let them
influence you to dance or sing along. Similarly, you can
notice or be mindful of your private events as they hap-
pen but not let them influence you to do things that are
not values based.

Committed Action: Doing

Engaging in committed action is a skill executed by psycho-
logically flexible individuals, and can be learned through
ACTraining. Committed action is overt behavior in the service
of values. Psychological inflexibility is evidenced when an
individual is inactive, avoidant, or impulsive. For instance,
during the pandemic, a graduate student engages in a psycho-
logically inflexible repertoire (given his values) of ditching the
newly established distance-learning classes being taught
through teleconferencing. Because the campus is closed, he
stays in bed all day, does not answer his texts and e-mails,
scrolls through TikTok for hours, puts whiskey in his coffee
so he can “catch a buzz,” and simply puts an avatar up during

class time to deceive the professor into thinking he is present
in class. These responses show inactivity, impulsivity, and
avoidance, and ACTraining would encourage the develop-
ment of a list of responses that are more in line with his values,
as well as a contingency plan to support an increased rate of
these behaviors.

The bottom rows of the MAP set the occasion for “design-
ing success with performance management.” Utilizing perfor-
mance management will support the execution of this new list
of committed actions that you will be “doing,” and behavior
analysts know full well the power of behavioral contracts. The
suggestions from this section help to codify how performance
management can be applied to the new task list of replacement
behaviors. The MAP guides you to use a checklist to provide
yourself with antecedent support (e.g., “Make sure all required
resources for successful actions have been acquired.”) and
contingency-management directives (“Publicly announce
your commitment to meet performance goals,” and “Alert
your accountability partner about your commitment and
goals.”). The inclusion of a place to develop a clear behavioral
contract (“Describe incentives, performance criteria, and
deadlines.”) shows how firmly ACT is attached to traditional
behavior analysis and that the domains of ACT (i.e., accep-
tance, defusion, self-as-context, values, and contacting the
present moment) aim to support the performance management
approach.

The “doing” component of the MAP comports with com-
mitted action in the ACT model and gives instructions to
develop an objective to-do list. Behavior analysts are, in gen-
eral, already very good at setting goals and breaking down
tasks to create a to-do list. What might be needed now is
improvement in the skill of prioritizing your tasks in line with
a radically new context—either you may be overwhelmed
with things to do as your work requirements radically shift,
or you may be stuck feeling helpless, “doing nothing” at
home. For now, genuinely and authentically take a few mo-
ments to put pen to paper and develop your to-do list. After
you have created the list, select some objectives and write
them in your printed-out version of the MAP worksheet.
Once completed, look at your to-do list. Does it seem in line
with what is most important right now? Hold that thought, and
we will return to this list after looking at the next component.

Values: What I Care About

Authoring, clarifying, and being influenced by one’s values is
another skill that ACT helps develop by inviting people to
explore the significant purpose of their lives and their choices.
Values are verbally constructed, freely chosen directions for
responses that establish reinforcement for engaging in those
personally relevant actions (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009). When
one has not clarified his or her values, he or she is more likely
to engage in psychologically inflexible behaviors that are

Behav Analysis Practice  (2022) 15:330–338

337

influenced by short-term reinforcers or contingencies that are
more socially conventional and expected rather than what is
personally meaningful. For example, during the pandemic,
we, the authors of this article, found ourselves and many of
our friends struggling with the same thoughts as the aforemen-
tioned preschool director—that with the world and our coun-
try in the state it is in, nothing really matters, and there is
nothing we can do about it anyway. We, too, found ourselves
drinking more, watching quite a few more escapist shows than
usual, and dropping projects that had once been important to
us. But this article itself reflects our reorientation to what
seems most important in this moment—to focus on how we
can help, in our own way, even though we are not making
masks or engaging in “essential” work during this crisis.

Let us be perfectly clear: Everyone has the right to imbibe
their favorite beverage and watch television shows that are
entertaining. People can choose the values of “recreation”
and “entertainment” to be a part of their repertoire. The same
person can also choose “contribution” and “ambition” as
values. The context sets the occasion for certain choices to
be reinforced. The purpose of values clarification is develop-
ing verbal behavior about what is reinforcing to the individual
simply by the manner in which the person executes his or her
behavior. The ACTraining model suggests that authoring and
clarifying one’ s values can increase psychological
flexibility—the ability to change given certain contextual
variables—when the environment presents certain difficulties.
The “what I care about” component of the MAP comports
with values in the ACT model, gives instructions to develop a
list of values, and instructs the person to take the following
action: Describe your motivation for engaging in your chosen
action and why you aim for optimal performance.

Everything discussed in this article rests on identifying
what is important to you, right now, in this moment, as well
as what will continue to be important in the future. For most
people, times of crisis result in a realignment of priorities and a
questioning of what is most important. The shelter-in-place
order from the pandemic is like hitting a pause button on the
trajectory of life, and so it is a good time for all of us to ask the
question “What do I care about?” The pandemic pause button
is setting the occasion for everyone to genuinely ponder how
we want to be in the world—as individuals unto ourselves and
as group members—and reflect on what characteristics will be
evident in the quality of our actions.

One solid exercise you can attempt is taking 10 min and
writing out what you want to talk to your loved ones about in
the future about how you handled the 2020 pandemic. Truly
put pen to paper, and think about a gathering you are poten-
tially attending next year. How do you want to say you be-
haved during the public health crisis? Imagine attending a
major convention in the future and catching up with your close
colleagues. What will you be able to say you did, and what
were the qualities and characteristics of your actions? This

exercise can easily lead to answers that will make us seem
like we want to do things that get other people’s admiration
and social reinforcement, but ponder this exercise a bit more
personally and complexly. What do you truly care about deep-
ly, so much so that you will be proud to have acted this way
during a challenging time, whether other people reinforce
such choices or not? Your values have personal meaning,
and simply by acting in the directions governed by these ver-
bal events, such behavior is reinforced. Life is asking us a
question: “How do you want to be?” What is your answer?

Now, come back to the to-do list you created in the last
section. Recall that we asked: “Does it seem in line with what
is most important right now?” Now that you have spent time
thinking about what is vital to you, and the characteristics that
bring vitality to your behavior, can you see your list as worthy
and worthwhile? You might also take the time to make a list of
things you have been doing that are not necessarily on your to-
do list—whether that is “make sourdough,” “run on the
beach,” “have a virtual happy hour with friends,” or “binge-
watch Netflix and eat popcorn”—and add some of those to
your MAP. Can you see how the actions on both these lists
align with your values? Are there actions you would like to
engage in more effectively? Are there actions on either of
these lists that do not seem so important? Now is the time to
identify your priorities and commit to them. It may help to use
strategies that are well researched in the performance manage-
ment literature (as discussed previously) and establish a rela-
tionship with an accountability partner where you can both
develop a contract including incentives, performance criteria,
and deadlines for committed actions. And at the same time, we
encourage you to be gentle with yourself—“productivity” is
not the goal in times of crisis. Simply doing the next right
thing, in the face of adversity, is more than enough.

As you try to engage in values-directed actions, various
barriers—distractions and aversive feelings and thoughts—
will continue to show up. Notice what is not making it off
your to-do list. What have you been doing instead? What
might you be avoiding? Come back to the cycle of “I am here
now, accepting my feelings and noticing my thoughts while
doing what I care about,” and see if you can manage some of
those barriers a little more easily every time you practice the
skills. As you engage in values-directed committed actions
while managing distractions, worry, fear, and sadness, you
are showing psychological flexibility and achieving the pro-
cess and outcome of ACTraining.

Conclusion

The MAP is a flexible tool that can be used in many other
environments addressing a myriad of challenges, and it will
continue to be useful to you long after this pandemic is over.
Because ACT is a transdiagnostic intervention, this checklist

and related skills can not only be applied to countless human
tribulations but also simply improve your ability to live in
alignment with your personal and professional values on an
ongoing basis. We encourage you to learn more about psy-
chological flexibility as a worthy construct in applied behav-
ioral science, as well as learn more about applying ACT for
clients and yourself. The Association for Behavior Analysis
International and the Association for Contextual Behavioral
Science provide more resources for learning about this pow-
erful intervention. We hope that you continue to use the MAP
as an effective guide to engaging in psychological
flexibility—not only now in this time of global crisis, but also
in the future, as you continue to do good work in the face of all
the typical stress and adversity we face as humans in a helping
profession.
