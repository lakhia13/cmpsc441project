Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder vulnerable individuals can develop following a traumatic event,
whereas others are resilient. Enhanced insight into the mechanistic underpinnings contributing to these inter-individual differences
in trauma susceptibility is key to improved treatment and prevention. Aberrant function of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)
may contribute to its psychopathology, with the dorsal DG potentially encoding trauma memory generalization and the ventral DG
anxiety. Using a mouse model, we hypothesized that susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptoms following trauma will be
underpinned by aberrant DG structure and function. Mice were exposed to a traumatic event (unpredictable, inescapable foot
shocks) and tested for PTSD-like symptomatology following recovery. In four independent experiments, DG neuronal morphology,
synaptic protein gene and protein expression, and neuronal activity during trauma encoding and recall were assessed. Behaviorally,
trauma-susceptible animals displayed increased anxiety-like behavior already prior to trauma, increased novelty-induced freezing,
but no clear differences in remote trauma memory recall. Comparison of the ventral DG of trauma susceptible vs resilient mice
revealed lower spine density, reduced expression of the postsynaptic protein homer1b/c gene and protein, a larger population of
neurons active during trauma encoding, and a greater presence of somatostatin neurons. In contrast, the dorsal DG of trauma-
susceptible animals did not differ in terms of spine density or gene expression but displayed more active neurons during trauma
encoding and a lower amount of somatostatin neurons. Collectively, we here report on speciﬁc structural and functional changes in
the ventral DG in trauma susceptible male mice.

INTRODUCTION
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder one
can develop after exposure to a traumatic event. PTSD patients
experience excessive arousal, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle
responses, and insomnia (DSM-V [1]), which severely impact their
quality of life. Moreover, one of the hallmark features of PTSD is
the re-experiencing of the trauma through ﬂashbacks, sponta-
neous recollections, and recurrent nightmares of the trauma [2].
However, whereas over 80% of individuals ever experience a
traumatic event, only a relatively small
fraction (~15%) will
develop PTSD [3, 4]. Understanding the neural basis of this
inter-individual variability in PTSD susceptibility is critical
for
understanding PTSD psychopathology [5], and likely holds unique
insights for optimized treatment and even prevention.

An over-generalization of

to safe, non-trauma-related
fear
situations is thought to contribute to PTSD psychopathology
[6, 7], but the exact underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
Previous research has implicated the aberrant function of the
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in fear generalization, impairing
hippocampal pattern separation [8], a process resolving inter-
ference in encoding and retrieving similar experiences [9–14].

Robust
inhibition of DG granule cells by inhibitory
interneurons in the hilar region [11, 15] ensures the sparse
activation necessary for efﬁcient pattern separation, with a
prominent role for somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons
[16]. However, pattern separation capacity has mainly been
attributed to the dorsal DG (dDG), whereas the ventral DG (vDG)
seems to be more involved in affective processing [17–20]. Activity
in the vDG is associated with anxiety [18, 21–23], the return of
extinguished fear [24], and mediating the anxiolytic effects of
antidepressant treatment [25–27]. These ﬁndings suggest that the
dDG might contribute to PTSD symptomatology by impaired
pattern separation processes, whereas
the vDG might be
implicated by mediating increased anxiety. Supporting a role for
aberrant overall DG function in PTSD, patients show poor
performance on a memory task testing pattern separation [28],
as well as a smaller DG volume [29, 30], which correlates with
PTSD symptom severity [29]. Rodent work has added to these
ﬁndings by showing reduced dendritic complexity and spine
density in the DG of animals most sensitive to a trauma [31–34],
and a reduced expression of DG synaptic proteins
[35].
Importantly, most of these studies did not investigate the DG

function and structure along its dorso-ventral axis, and the exact
functional and structural changes in the susceptible brain are still
largely unknown.

Here, we set out to investigate potential DG abnormalities in a
PTSD model in male mice, in which mice were ﬁrst exposed to a
traumatic event (foot shocks) and then behaviorally tested for
PTSD-like symptomatology, dissociating susceptible from resilient
mice. We compared dorsal and ventral DG structure (neuronal
morphology and synaptic protein gene expression) and function
(activity during trauma memory encoding and remote recall)
between susceptible and resilient mice. Affected genes were
followed up by the assessment of synaptic protein levels.
Moreover, behavioral readouts of anxiety and fear generalization
were assessed prior to or immediately following trauma exposure,
to obtain insights into important predictors of
trauma
susceptibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
The study consisted of four separate experiments: experiment 1 (n = 24) to
assess DG spine density, experiment 2 (n = 48) for assessing DG gene
expression, experiment 3 to validate DG gene expression ﬁndings at the
protein level (n = 44), and experiment 4 (n = 45) to assess DG neuronal
activity. Sample sizes were based on previous experiments with this PTSD
model39,40. For experiments 1–2, C57BL/6 J mice (Charles River, France)
were used. For experiment 3, ArcCreERT2xROSA offspring (ArcTRAP [36])
was used that was generated by crossing heterozygote male ArcCreERT2
(B6.129(Cg)-Arctm1.1(cre/ERT2)Luo/J, 021881, Jackson Laboratory) and homo-
zygote conditional ROSA mice (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J,
007909,
Jackson Laboratory). For experiment 4, heterozygote male
FosCreERT2 mice (B6.129(Cg)-Fostm1.1(cre/ERT2)Luo/J, 021882, Jackson Labora-
tory) were crossed with homozygote ROSA females to generate hetero-
zygote offspring (FosTRAP [36]). Based on sex differences in stress
sensitivity [37, 38], and the fact that the used PTSD model has only been
validated in males [39, 40], only male mice were used. Mice were group
housed (3–4 mice per cage) in individually ventilated cages on a reverse
12 hour (9.00–21.00 h) dark/light cycle. Food and water were provided ad
libitum. All behavioral testing was performed at least 4 h into the animals’
active phase (i.e., the dark). The experimental protocols were in line with
international guidelines, the Care and Use of Mammals in neuroscience
and Behavioural Research (National Research Council 2003), the principles
of laboratory animal care, as well as the Dutch law concerning animal
welfare and approved by the Central Committee for Animal Experiments,
Den Haag, The Netherlands.

PTSD model
All mice were exposed to PTSD-induction model (Fig. S1) as described
before [39, 40]. On day 1, mice were exposed to a traumatic event, i.e., the
exposure to 14 × 1 s 1 mA foot shocks at variable intervals for an 85 min
session in a certain context A. Locomotor activity during trauma exposure
was assessed by analyzing beam break data, on infrared beams located at
both sides of the context. On day 2, 21 h post-trauma, mice were subjected
to a subsequent trigger, i.e., 5 × 1 s 0.7 mA foot shocks at a ﬁxed 1-min
interval for 5 min session, in a different context (context B). Mice were
videotaped during trigger exposure, and videos analyzed for freezing
behavior by a researcher blind to the experimental group, to assess
novelty-induced anxiety as well as shock-induced fear. Mice were allowed
to recover, and at a week post-trauma tested for their behavioral response
by assessing PTSD-like behavior;
impaired risk assessment (dark-light
transfer test), increased anxiety (marble burying), hypervigilance (acoustic
startle), impaired sensorimotor gaiting (pre-pulse inhibition), and disturbed
circadian rhythm (locomotor activity during the light phase)
[40].
Additionally, to assess the neuroendocrine stress response, mice were
exposed to restraint stress. See the Supplementary Materials for further
details.

Behavioral categorization
In order to categorize mice as either PTSD-like or resilient, mouse behavior
on each of the tests was sorted and the 25% of mice who had the lowest
values were attributed 3 points for percentage risk assessment, 3 points for
latency to peak startle amplitude, and 2 points for percentage PPI.

Similarly, 25% of mice showing the highest values were attributed 1 point
for light locomotor activity and marble burying [39]. Points for each test
were determined by factor analysis as described before [40]. The points per
animal were tallied to generate an overall PTSD symptom score (Fig. S2),
and mice that had totals of 5 or more points (necessitating extreme
behavior in multiple tests) were termed susceptible. Only mice that had 0
points were termed resilient.

Experiment 1: DG neuronal morphology
Sacriﬁce. Mice were subjected to the PTSD model and sacriﬁced under
baseline conditions on day 23 under anesthesia (5% isoﬂurane inhalation
injection with 200 μl pentobarbital) by perfusion with
followed by i.p.
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
followed by phosphate-buffered 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were surgically removed and post-
ﬁxed for 24 h in 4% PFA, after which they were transferred to 0.1 M PBS
with 0.01% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C.

Golgi staining. Brains of susceptible (n = 4) and resilient (n = 5) mice were
processed for rapid Golgi-Cox staining (FD Rapid GolgiStainTM FDNeur-
otechnologies,
to examine the neuronal
morphology of dorsal and ventral DG granule cells. For every animal, 5 cells
per region were reconstructed, on which spines were counted in an
average of 6 segments. Statistics were performed on animal averages.
Details about the Golgi procedure, neuronal reconstruction, and spine
density analysis are given in the Supplementary Materials.

Experiment 2: DG gene expression
Design and sacriﬁce. Mice in this experiment were ﬁrst tested in the Open
Field and Elevated Plus Maze tests for assessing pre-trauma anxiety
(Supplementary Materials). Additionally, the mice were exposed to two
functional neuroimaging sessions (7 days prior to trauma induction and
20 days post-trauma) in an 11.7 T BioSpec Avance III small animal MR
system (Bruker BioSpin), while anesthetized by 0.5% inhalation isoﬂurane
and subcutaneous infusion of medetomidine (Dexdomitor, Pﬁzer, 0.1 mg/
kg/h [41]). These data are, however, beyond the scope of the present
study. Mice were sacriﬁced on day 28 by rapid decapitation, and brains
were surgically removed, quickly frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C
until further processing.

Isolation of target tissue. Brains of susceptible (n = 9) and resilient (n = 12)
mice from experiment two were sliced into 300 μm coronal slices on a
Leica CM3050 S Research Cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands), with a chamber temperature of −12 °C and an object
temperature of −10 °C, after which regions of interest were punched out.
dDG punches were taken bilaterally with a 0.5 mm diameter hollow needle
from three subsequent slices (Bregma −1.70: −2.30 mm), for a total of six
punches per subregion. Similarly, six 0.75 mm diameter punches were
taken from the vDG (Bregma −2.80: −3.40 mm).

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. RNA was extracted from the isolated
tissue using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Nether-
lands), after which cDNA was synthesized using the SensiFAST™ cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bioline, Taunton, MA, USA).

Quantitative PCR. Gene expression was compared in dorsal and ventral DG
of susceptible and resilient mice using qPCR. We chose to look speciﬁcally at
pre- and postsynaptic markers to tie into the spine density measurements
and added a spine-localized immediate early gene and a neuronal marker to
be able to relate gene expression to the amount of neuronal material
included in the punch. Assays included genes encoding synapsin I (Syn1) and
synaptophysin (Syp), both present in synaptic vesicles [42]; postsynaptic
density-95 (Psd-95), encoding a postsynaptic membrane protein [43];
homer1b/c (Homer1 splice variant), an postsynaptic density scaffolding
protein involved in glutamate receptor
transporter protein availability;
homer1a (Homer1 splice variant), an immediate early gene and shown to
be in direct competition with the longer transcript homer1b/c [44]; and
neuroﬁlament H (Nefh), a neuronal marker [35]. Hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) and cytochrome c1 (Cyc1) were chosen as
housekeeping genes. Details are given in the Supplementary Materials.

Experiment 3: DG postsynaptic protein expression
Design and sacriﬁce. Mice in this experiment were injected with
tamoxifen solution 7 h prior to trauma exposure to label trauma-related

neuronal activity by the induction of tdTomato expression. Since results
revealed high background staining in the DG (see Fig. S9), tdTomato
signals of this experimental group were not analyzed. On day 23, mice
were sacriﬁced under anesthesia (5% isoﬂurane inhalation followed by i.p.
injection with 200 μl pentobarbital) by perfusion with PBS followed by 4%
PFA. Their brains were surgically removed, post-ﬁxed for 24 h in 4% PFA,
and stored at 4 °C in 0.1 M PBS with 0.01% sodium azide.

Immunohistochemistry. Right hemispheres of the brains of the susceptible
(n = 9), resilient (n = 12) animals were sliced into 30 μm coronal sections
and immunostained for Homer1b/c and DAPI. Further details on this
cohort are given in the Supplementary Materials.

Experiment 4: DG neuronal activity
Design and sacriﬁce. Mice in this experiment were injected with
tamoxifen solution 7 h prior to trauma exposure to label trauma-related
neuronal activity by the induction of tdTomato expression (see Supple-
mentary Materials). On day 23, the FosTRAP mice were placed back in
context B for the duration of 10 min, following the exact same procedures
as during the trigger session, to induce fear memory recall. No shocks were
administered during this context
re-exposure session. Behavior was
videotaped and freezing behavior was scored manually by an observer
blind to the experimental condition (The Observer XT12, Noldus). To
conﬁrm successful fear recall in traumatized mice, freezing behavior was
compared to that of control mice, which were exposed to the shock boxes
without receiving foot shocks. Mice were sacriﬁced 90 min post re-
exposure under anesthesia (5% isoﬂurane inhalation followed by i.p.
injection with 200 μl pentobarbital) by perfusion with PBS followed by 4%
PFA. The brains were surgically removed and treated similarly to
experiment 3.

Immunohistochemistry. Right hemispheres of the brains of the susceptible
(n = 9), resilient (n = 8), and intermediate (n = 17) animals were sliced into
30 μm coronal sections and immunostained for c-Fos and somatostatin
protein. Further details are given in the Supplementary Materials.

Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Data points deviating
more than three interquartile ranges from the group median were
considered outliers and removed from further analysis (see Supplementary
Materials for the exact data points excluded). Normality was checked using
the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Comparisons between susceptible and
resilient animals were done using independent sample t tests when
assumption for normal distribution was met. In case the assumption for
normal distribution was not met, a Mann–Whitney U test was used to
compare susceptible vs resilient mice. In case of repeated measures within
an animal (i.e., effects of dorsal-ventral axis or distance to soma in case of
morphological data) a repeated measures ANOVA was used.
In case
Mauchly’s test
for sphericity indicated that sphericity could not be
assumed, Greenhouse-Geisser tests were reported. Results were consid-
ered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05. Signiﬁcant ANOVA group × axis interaction
effects were followed up with post hoc independent samples t-tests.

RESULTS
Ventral DG spine density is reduced in male mice susceptible
to trauma
To assess potential differences in DG neuronal morphology
associated with differential susceptibility to PTSD-like symptoms
following trauma, a batch of 24 mice was exposed to the PTSD-
induction protocol and, following a week of recovery, assessed on
PTSD-like symptomatology (Fig. S3). Susceptible mice were
characterized by a signiﬁcantly higher PTSD-like symptom score
than resilient ones (U = 20, p = 0.016), as well as a suppressed
corticosterone stress response (Fig. S4A). DG neuronal morphol-
ogy of susceptible (n = 4) and resilient animals (n = 5) was
assessed by Golgi staining (Fig. 1A). Sholl analyses revealed no
signiﬁcant differences between groups in the total dendritic
material (length) in the dorsal and ventral DG (dDG: F(1,7) = 1.041,
p = 0.342, vDG: F(1,7)<1), nor in its distribution across distance to
soma (group × distance interaction. dDG: F(24,168) = 1.010,
p = 0.456, vDG: F(22,154) = 1.037, p = 0.424), whereas there was
a clear effect of distance to soma (dDG: F(24,168) = 62.784,
p < 0.001, vDG: F(22,154) = 50.742, p < 0.001, Fig. 1B). Spine
density was comparable between susceptible and resilient mice
in the dDG (U = 10, p = 1.000), but susceptible animals displayed a
slightly, but signiﬁcantly, reduced spine density in the vDG (U = 0,
p = 0.029, Fig. 1C). No signiﬁcant group differences were observed
in either the dendritic trunk length (dDG: t(7) = 0.085, p = 0.935,
vDG: U(9) = 5, p = 0.286, Fig. S5A) or position within the granule
cell layer (dDG: U(9) = 7, p = 0.556, vDG: t(7) = −0.569, p = 0.587,
Fig. S5B) of the neurons traced. Both these measures are potential
indicators of the developmental stage at which the traced neurons
were born [45], suggesting that differences between susceptible
and resilient mice were not caused by a selection bias towards
either older or younger neurons. Yet, as information on trunk
length, as well as the location of the soma within the granule cell
layer, do not allow for the distinction between mature and
immature neurons,
to be determined whether
phenotypic differences are observed for both types of granule
cells or primarily affect one over the other.

Homer1b/c expression is reduced in the ventral DG of mice
susceptible to trauma
Next, potential differences in DG gene expression associated with
differential susceptibility to PTSD-like symptoms following trauma
were assessed in a new batch of 48 mice. To test whether pre-
trauma anxiety constitutes a risk factor for later PTSD develop-
ment, all animals of this batch were additionally tested for anxiety-
like behavior prior to trauma exposure.

the ventral DG of susceptible animals, whereas no differential spine density was observed in the dorsal DG (C). Behavioral results for this
cohort are depicted in Figure S3. *p < 0.05.

Animals later categorized as susceptible (n = 10) vs resilient
(n = 12) (Fig. S6) signiﬁcantly differed in their PTSD-like symptom
score (U = 108, p < 0.001), but not in their corticosterone stress
response (Fig. S4B). Moreover,
they did not display different
behavior in the open ﬁeld test prior to trauma exposure. The
distance traveled through the center, total distance traveled, the
number of crossings through the center, the time spent in the
t(20)’s < 1) and the latency to enter
the center
center
(t(20) = 1.581, p = 0.129) of the open ﬁeld (t(20) < 1) were not
different between groups (Fig. S7A). However, groups did differ in
the distance traveled on the open arms of the elevated plus maze
(t(19) = 2.307, p = 0.033), with the susceptible animals walking a
shorter distance (mean ± stdev: 137.56 ± 51.02 cm) compared to the
resilient animals (197.99 ± 64.84 cm). No differences were observed
in the time spent on the open arms (t(20) = 1.395, p = 0.178), nor in
the total distance traveled on the maze (t(11.812) = 1.005, p = 0.335,
Fig. S7B). Interestingly, signiﬁcant behavioral differences between
susceptible vs resilient groups were also observed during the trigger
session, where the susceptible mice showed a shorter latency to
start freezing than resilient animals (U = 22, p = 0.017). Furthermore,
a majority of susceptible mice –in contrast to resilient mice– showed
freezing behavior before the ﬁrst foot shock was administered in this
(U = 88, p = 0.020, Fig. 2A). Subsequent shock-
novel context
induced freezing was not different between susceptible and resilient
ones (t(20) = 1.216, p = 0.238, Fig. 2A), suggesting similar threat
coping mechanisms.

We continued with analyzing the DG’s expression levels of
genes encoding excitatory presynaptic (Syn and Syp) and
postsynaptic (Homer1b/c and Psd-95) markers related to spine
density, a spine-localized immediate early gene (Homer1a) and a
neuronal marker (Nefh), previously found to be affected by stress
[35, 46]. The dorsal (Fig. 2B) and ventral DG (Fig. 2C) did not reveal
differential expression of Nefh mRNA between susceptible vs
resilient mice (p’s > 0.13), suggesting that the number of neurons
did not differ between groups [35]. Moreover, no differences were
found in mRNA levels of the presynaptic vesicle markers Syn and
Syp (p’s > 0.1), indicating that synaptic release in the susceptible
mice was not altered. Interestingly, mRNA levels for Homer1b/c
showed a main effect of axis (F(1,13.058) = 41.810, p < 0.001),
group (F(1,14.981) = 4.868, p = 0.043) and a group × axis
interaction (F(1,13.058) = 34.321, p < 0.001), which was caused
by substantially lower expression in the vDG of susceptible
animals compared to resilient animals (t(7.388) = 3.475, p = 0.009),
the dDG (t(6.285) = 1.107, p = 0.309). These effects
but not
seemed to be driven by three susceptible animals that showed
extremely low levels of Homer1b/c expression (<1% of the levels of
resilient animals), but exclusion of these animals still revealed
signiﬁcant group differences (t(13) = 2.540, p = 0.025). No differ-
ences in the Homer1a splice variant were observed between
groups (p’s > 0.35). Moreover, no group differences in Psd-95
mRNA levels were observed (p’s > 0.23).

To test whether these differences in Homer1b/c expression
translate to the protein level, we assessed Homer1b/c protein
levels in the dDG and vDG by immunohistochemistry in a new
cohort of 44 mice, dissociating the molecular layers in the upper
and lower blade of the DG, as well as the hilar region. Mice were
behaviorally phenotyped and susceptible (n = 12) and resilient
(n = 10) mice identiﬁed. Susceptible animals showed a signiﬁ-
cantly higher PTSD-like symptom score (U(21) = 120, p < 0.001,
Fig. S8), as well as trend-level signiﬁcant reductions in corticoster-
one stress levels (Fig. S4C). Homer1b/c expression was quantiﬁed
in each DG subregion by analyzing both total cluster area size
(reﬂecting postsynaptic density (PSD) size [47, 48]), as well as
cluster signal intensity (Fig. 2D), as a proxy for protein expression
levels [49]. Whereas no differences in cluster area size were
observed in any of the dDG and vDG subregions (all p’s > 0.167),
signal intensity tended to be lower in the molecular layer of the
the vDG (t(14) = 1.893, p = 0.079), and this
upper blade of

reduction reached signiﬁcance in the molecular layer of the lower
blade of the vDG (t(14) = 2.375, p = 0.032, Fig. 2E) in susceptible
intensity were observed in the
mice. No differences in signal
ventral hilar region (U(17) = 36, p = 1.00), nor in any of the dDG
subregions (all p’s > 0.21), suggesting a speciﬁc effect for the vDG
molecular layer.

Trauma susceptible mice exhibit larger DG neuronal ensemble
activation during trauma encoding
Next, we wanted to investigate whether differential
trauma
susceptibility was also related to distinct DG functionality in terms
of its activity during trauma memory encoding and retrieval. To do
so, we used FosTRAP mice [36], in which the injection of tamoxifen
induces the expression of the ﬂuorescent marker tdTomato in all
c-Fos-expressing (i.e., activated) neurons. For the study of DG
function, the FosTRAP mouse line was preferred over the ArcTRAP
mouse line [36, 50, 51], as the latter is characterized by substantial
background staining of DG neurons in non-injected animals (i.e.,
labeled neurons in the absence of tamoxifen (Fig. S9)), which is
not observed in FosTRAP mice (Fig. S10) [36]. Pilot experiments
indicated that FosTRAP mice showed no alterations in fear
behavior or memory performance, and signiﬁcant labeling of DG
neuronal activity upon tamoxifen injection (Fig. S10, S11),
qualifying them for the experiment.

To investigate whether DG activity during trauma encoding can
predict trauma susceptibility, we injected 40 FosTRAP mice with
tamoxifen prior to trauma induction, followed by the trigger the
next day. Again, following a week of recovery, mice were tested
for PTSD-like symptoms, dissociating susceptible (n = 9)
from
resilient (n = 8) mice (Fig. S11) with differing PTSD-like symptom
scores (U = 72, p < 0.001). Susceptible mice also showed a
suppressed corticosterone stress response (Fig. S4D). To addition-
ally test whether trauma susceptibility is associated with altered
DG recruitment during the recall of the traumatic experience,
animals were re-exposed to the trigger context prior to sacriﬁce,
and their brains analyzed for recall-induced c-Fos expression. To
compare behavioral responses as well as neuronal activity during
trauma exposure and remote memory recall to that of a neutral
memory, we also included control animals (n = 5,
randomly
assigned). Control animals were injected with tamoxifen at the
same time point as the trauma group, but did not receive any foot
shocks, nor were they tested for PTSD-like symptomatology to
prevent testing-induced stress.

As expected, during the trigger session controls started freezing
later
than both shock-exposed groups (median ± interquartile
range: 68.68 ± 106.82, U = 10, p < 0.001), and froze less following
shock delivery in the shock-exposed group (mean ± stdev:
0.84 ± 0.57 s, t(35.917) = 27.713, p < 0.001).

Moreover, control mice displayed lower freezer behavior during
the ﬁrst minute of the trigger session (i.e., prior to the ﬁrst shock
administration in the shock-exposed groups)
(mean ± stdev:
13.14 ± 11.13 s, t((15.759) = 6.086, p < 0.001), suggesting increased
context-induced anxiety in shock-exposed mice. Retrospective
analyses revealed no differential locomotor behavior in the trauma
context between susceptible vs resilient mice (overall mobility;
t(12) < 1). However, signiﬁcant differences were again observed
between groups during the trigger session, when the susceptible
mice showed a shorter latency to start a freezing bout (deﬁned as
a period of complete immobility for >2 s) than resilient animals
(t(8.910) = 2.374, p = 0.042), and on average started freezing well
before the ﬁrst foot shock administration in this novel context (Fig.
3A). Overall freezing prior to the ﬁrst shock administration was not
different between susceptible and resilient animals (t(13) < 1), nor
were subsequent shock-induced freezing levels (t(12.786) < 1,
p = 0.561, Fig. 3A).

animals showed a lower latency to freeze in the trigger context, with substantial freezing already prior to the ﬁrst foot shock in this novel
context. Subsequent shock-induced freezing was not different between groups (A). Gene expression levels of synaptic proteins were not
different between susceptible and resilient animals in the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) (B), but revealed a strong reduction in the expression of
the Homer1b/c gene (Hom1b/c) in the ventral DG (C). Behavioral results for cohort 2 on PTSD-like symptoms are depicted in Figure S6, whereas
anxiety measures are displayed in Figure S7. Behavioral cohort 3 was used for immunohistochemistry experiments aimed at validating that
Hom1b/c gene expression differences translated to the protein level. Homer1b/c protein expression levels were assessed in the upper (ML1)
and lower (ML2) molecular layers, as well as the hilus of the dorsal and ventral DG (D, E). Susceptible animals appeared to be characterized by
lower Homer1b/c expression in the ventral DG molecular layers, but not ventral hilus or dorsal DG (E). Behavioral results for cohort 3 on PTSD-
like symptoms are depicted in Figure S8. Nefh: neuroﬁlament H, Syn: synapsin I, Syp: synaptophysin, Psd-95: postsynaptic density-95, Hom1a:

When comparing the DG neuronal populations active during
the trauma and trigger exposure (i.e., the number of tdTomato-

the susceptible animals displayed a signiﬁcantly larger active

(main effect of group; F(1,12) = 4.841,

p = 0.048), and that this difference was independent of ventral-
dorsal axis (group × axis interaction; F(1,12) < 1, Fig. 4B). The
amount of active DG neurons during fear memory recall as
assessed by c-Fos expression was not signiﬁcantly different
between groups (main effect of group; F(1,12) < 1, group × axis
interaction; F(1,12)<1, Fig. 4C). In terms of the reactivation rates
(deﬁned as the number of neurons double-positive for tdTomato
and c-Fos divided by the total number of tdTomato positive cells
[52, 53]), no signiﬁcant group differences were observed for the
dDG (median ± interquartile range: dDGresilient = 0.44 ± 2.20%,
dDGsusceptible = 0.00 ± 1.21%, U = 19.5, p = 0.573), whereas the

vDGsusceptible = 0.41 ± 1.88, U = 32.5,
p = 0.065). However, reactivation rates were overall very low.
Remarkably, the number of DG somatostatin neurons –primarily
located in the DG hilar region (Fig. 4A)– was signiﬁcantly lower in
the dDG of susceptible vs resilient mice (t(12) = 2.691, p = 0.020),
whereas a trend towards increased counts of somatostatin
neurons was observed in the vDG (t(11) = 1.845, p = 0.087),
resulting in a signiﬁcant group × axis interaction (F(1,10) = 8.511,
p = 0.015, Fig. 4D). Both the number of active DG somatostatin

neurons during encoding and remote recall were very low (Table
S1) and not different between groups (all p’s > 0.5).

Based on signiﬁcant correlations between overall PTSD-like
symptom score and the number of active neurons in the vDG
during the trauma and trigger exposure (i.e., number of tdTomato
positive cells; ρ(14) = 0.703, p = 0.005), as well as the number of
somatostatin neurons within the vDG (ρ(13) = 0.623, p = 0.023),
we additionally analyzed the brains of 17 animals that showed an
intermediate PTSD phenotype (1 ≤ PTSD-like symptom score ≤ 4).
All DG outcome measures were subsequently tested for signiﬁcant
associations with PTSD-like symptom score,
instead of group
differences between the extreme-scoring animals only. These
analyses conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings of a larger active DG
population during trauma+trigger processing predicting greater
PTSD-like symptomatology (ρ(30) = 0.426, p = 0.019), and sug-
gested that this correlation was particularly prominent for the vDG
(ρ(30) = 0.420, p = 0.021, Fig. 4E), whereas
the association
between PTSD-like symptom score and dDG activity failed to
reach signiﬁcance (p = 0.153, Fig. S12A). Furthermore,
these
analyses conﬁrmed an increased presence of
somatostatin
neurons
in the dDG;
ρ(29) = −0.028, p = 0.884, Fig. S12B)
in the development of
PTSD-like symptomatology, although this association reached
trend-level signiﬁcance only (ρ(29) = 0.354, p = 0.059, Fig. 4G).
When testing for correlations between the number of active DG
neurons and trauma memory recall, DG activity during trauma
encoding appeared not predictive of later re-exposure-induced
freezing (p’s > 0.5), but increased recall-induced activity in the dDG
(ρ(31) = 0.495, p = 0.005, Fig. 4F) (but not vDG (p = 0.236)) was
associated with enhanced memory recall. These data implicate
particularly the dDG in fear memory recall, which seems
unaffected in susceptible compared to resilient animals. Devia-
tions in vDG function however seem to correlate more strongly
with differences in PTSD-like symptomatology.

DISCUSSION
We investigated the association between DG structure and
function and the susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptoms
following trauma. Besides trauma-induced PTSD-like symptoma-
tology,
susceptible animals displayed increased anxiety-like
behavior already prior to trauma, and greater anxiety in a novel
context following trauma exposure. No clear differences between
susceptible and resilient mice were observed in remote trauma
memory recall. Comparison of the vDG of susceptible vs resilient
mice revealed lower spine density, reduced expression of the
postsynaptic protein homer1b/c gene and protein,
increased
population of neurons active during trauma encoding, and
increased presence of somatostatin neurons to be associated
with trauma susceptibility.
In contrast, the dDG of susceptible
animals did not differ in terms of spine density or synaptic protein
gene expression, but displayed more active neurons during
trauma encoding and fewer somatostatin neurons. As such, these
data implicate mainly the vDG in establishing PTSD-like symptoms
of trauma-related arousal in this animal model.

Fig. 3 Behavioral freezing in susceptible and resilient mice (cohort 4). Behavioral assessment of cohort 4 conﬁrmed a shorter latency to
freeze in susceptible animals in the trigger context (A), and revealed a trend towards a longer latency to freeze upon re-exposure to this
context compared to resilient animals (B), with no differences in overall freezing levels or their reduction across prolonged exposure between
these groups. Behavioral results on PTSD-like symptoms for this cohort are depicted in Figure S12. *p < 0.05, ~p = 0.066, effect of PTSD-like

Here, we used an animal model for PTSD that induces substantial
heterogeneity in the behavioral consequences of trauma exposure
(i.e., risk assessment, anxiety, hypervigilance, pre-pulse inhibition,
and activity during the inactive phase) in male mice. Noteworthy,
mice were classiﬁed as susceptible or resilient based on a compound
score comprising multiple behavioral PTSD-like symptoms, rather
than single behavioral features. This classiﬁcation resembles the
situation in patients [54], which can be diagnosed with PTSD based
on 20 criteria across four distinct symptom categories, resulting in a
highly heterogeneous patient population (DSM-V [1]). Accordingly,
we observed substantial behavioral variability both within and
across the four different cohorts in this study, as well as when
comparing our ﬁndings to previous reports on this PTSD model [39],
[40]. However, altered vDG function/structure was observed for all
cohorts, supporting its involvement in a wide range of PTSD
symptoms. Besides modeling behavioral phenotypic traits resem-
bling symptoms in PTSD patients, the animal model recapitulates
deviations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response
to stress (i.e., suppressed stress peak corticosterone levels [40]),
which were previously linked to increased glucocorticoid receptor
expression in the ventral subiculum of susceptible animals [40]. In
line with this,
the HPA axis in PTSD patients seems to be
characterized by enhanced negative feedback inhibition (for review,
see [55]). However, patient ﬁndings are not always consistent (for
meta-analyses, see [56, 57]), and it has been suggested that clinically
and biologically distinct subtypes of PTSD exist, with only speciﬁc
subtypes displaying enhanced negative feedback [58, 59]. Likewise,
we here did not observe similarly suppressed corticosterone
responses across behavioral cohorts. Future studies should investi-
gate if the DG of susceptible mice is characterized by alterations in
corticosteroid receptor expression, and how this relates to the
aberrancies in HPA axis function.

Dissociating susceptible vs resilient animals, we found that
susceptible mice traveled shorter distances on the open arms of
the elevated plus maze,
indicative of a reluctance to explore
relative danger zones, reﬂecting increased anxiety. However, no
behavioral differences were observed in the open ﬁeld, a
potentially less adverse environment. These ﬁndings match prior
animal work on reduced exploratory drive [60] and enhanced
anxiety [61] predicting trauma sensitivity, as well as human reports
on trait anxiety being predictive of PTSD risk and symptom
severity [62, 63]. Furthermore, susceptible animals displayed
increased behavioral freezing upon exposure to the unfamiliar
trigger context post-trauma. This is in line with reports on elevated
distress/arousal soon after trauma being predictive of later PTSD
symptom severity [64, 65] and intrusions [66]. It is tempting to
relate the increased novelty-induced anxiety to generalized fear in
susceptible mice, as has been reported by others [67], but future
dedicated assays on the extent to which fear generalizes across
contexts are required to warrant such a claim.

Susceptible animals revealed decreased spine density speciﬁ-
cally in the vDG, but no differences in dorsal or ventral DG
dendritic length. Alterations in DG morphology have been linked
to inter-individual differences in stress susceptibility before, with
only the animals most susceptible to trauma [32, 34],
learned
helplessness [33], or chronic social defeat [68] showing reductions
in DG spine density. In our PTSD mouse model these effects seem
to apply to the vDG speciﬁcally. Similarly, we observed a reduction
in the expression of the postsynaptic protein homer1b/c gene in
the vDG, as well as lower Homer1b/c expression levels in the vDG
molecular layer. Homer1b/c is an excitatory postsynaptic density
scaffolding protein [44], regulating spine morphogenesis, synaptic
plasticity and the stabilization of synaptic changes during long-
term potentiation (LTP)
[48]; suggesting an active role in
behavioral plasticity [69]. Its hippocampal expression levels have
been found reduced following traumatic stress and are associated
with generalized fear [35]. Previous work has also described
alterations in the other synaptic genes assessed following stress or
trauma [35, 46], but our study is the ﬁrst in assessing alterations in
speciﬁcally the DG and contrasting susceptible vs
resilient
individuals, providing more nuance to earlier ﬁndings. A limitation
is that we measured protein expression levels through immuno-
histochemistry,
instead of Western blots, although this has the
beneﬁt of increased spatial speciﬁcity. Overall, our assessments of
DG synaptic contacts suggest altered vDG synaptic signaling of
glutamatergic input, without any dDG differences.

Importantly,

larger active populations of DG neurons during
trauma encoding predicted later PTSD symptoms, predominantly
in the vDG, where the number of active neurons signiﬁcantly
correlated with PTSD-like symptom score. These ﬁndings corre-
spond with the suggested role for the vDG in mediating anxiety-
related behaviors [18, 21–23], and a reduction of vDG neuronal
activity during anxiogenic situations conferring stress resilience
[70]. In contrast, larger dDG neuronal populations active during
trauma encoding predicted increased freezing upon remote
memory recall, which supports its critical role in fear memory
acquisition [18, 71, 72]. DG activity is under tight control of local
GABAergic interneurons [11, 15, 73], with a prominent role for
somatostatin-expressing interneurons [16], which increase the
threshold of input required for acquisition of new memories,
ﬁltering out irrelevant environmental cues [74]. Correspondingly,
activation of somatostatin neurons has been found to reduce the
size of the activated granule cell population upon encoding to
ensure memory speciﬁcity [16]. The reduction in dDG somatos-
tatin neurons and increased number of DG granule cells ﬁt these
observations. Similarly, a recent report showed that the activation
of a larger DG granule cell ensemble upon fear memory formation
results in fear memory generalization [75], matching our ﬁndings.
No differences between phenotypes were observed in DG activity
during memory recall, nor reactivation rates. Although reactivation

Fig. 4 DG somatostatin expression and neuronal activity related to trauma encoding and recall in susceptible and resilient mice. In
cohort 4, dentate gyrus (DG) activity during trauma memory encoding (marked by tdTomato expression), remote trauma memory recall
(marked by c-Fos expression), as well as somatostatin (SOM) interneuron levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry (A). Susceptible
animals displayed an increased population of DG neurons active during trauma encoding (B), but no differences during its remote retrieval
(C). The number of somatostatin neurons identiﬁed in the dorsal (dDG) and ventral (vDG) differed between groups as well (D). Correlational
analyses involving also mice with an intermediate PTSD phenotype revealed associations between speciﬁcally the ventral DG and PTSD
symptom score (E, G), whereas the dorsal DG seemed to relate to trauma memory strength (F). Quality checks for the FosTRAP method are
presented in Figures S9 to S11. *p < 0.05, ~p = 0.087, effect of PTSD phenotype; $p < 0.05, hippocampal axis × PTSD-like phenotype interaction.

of DG neurons activated during encoding has been shown to
sufﬁce to induce recent memory recall [76, 77], memories are
known to reallocate to either cortical representations over time
[78, 79], or to different cells within the hippocampus [80]. This
might explain our low DG reactivation rates upon remote recall
[50]. Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that aberrant activity of
the vDG is implicated in establishing PTSD trauma-related and
arousal symptoms modeled in our mouse model, whereas the
dDG seems to be more involved in actual trauma memory
processing, which seems unaffected here. Noteworthy,
the
absence of a clear memory recall phenotype, as might be
expected in PTSD1, may suggest that our model strongly relies
on the trauma-related arousal and reactivity’ symptom cluster of
the DSM-V1. As such, our PTSD model may have high validity to
study excessive post-trauma anxiety, but other models may be
better suited to study memory-related abnormalities. However,
these abnormalities could also surface only upon re-exposure to a
broad array of contexts (testing for fear generalization/pattern
separation), or prolonged exposure triggering fear extinction, in
which the DG is also involved [81, 82].

Findings of an increased vDG population of active neurons
during trauma memory processing may seem at odds with the
increased potential for inhibition (i.e., more somatostatin neurons)
and reduced capacity for excitation (a reduction in glutamatergic
spines and excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein gene
expression). However, all assessments of DG excitatory/inhibitory
structural markers have been obtained post-trauma, posing the
question of whether these are cause or consequences of the
acquired symptomatology. Previous research has implicated
aberrant hippocampal function and structure as both [83, 84].
Therefore,
it could well be that the observed alterations in
excitatory/inhibitory regulation reﬂect a compensatory response
[85]. However, prior
to an initial excess of excitatory input

observations that particularly vDG granule cell morphology is
related to overall anxiety-like behavior,
independent of an
animal’s stress history [31], may suggest that these alterations
trauma-associated
are rather caused than a consequence of
symptoms. Interestingly, we also observed a signiﬁcant correlation
between vDG homer1b/c gene expression and pre-trauma anxiety
(distance moved on open arm; ρ(17) = −0.498, p = 0.042),
supporting that the synaptic differences are a pre-disposing trait
rather than a state marker of pathology.

Some limitations should be mentioned. Firstly, the structural
assessments of glutamatergic/GABAergic
regulation cannot
directly be related to the neurons involved in trauma memory
processing, as these implicate generic DG changes independent of
the functional population. Future studies should further investi-
gate this by analyzing morphology and gene expression patterns
of trauma-activated neurons speciﬁcally. Secondly, we did not
consider the heterogeneity of DG granule cells in terms of age.
Whereas particularly newborn neurons seem to be involved in
pattern separation [86, 87], we most likely mainly included mature
granule cells into our analyses, since vast majority of the DG
granule cell population is mature [88–90]. Future studies should
assess the structure and function of DG newborn neurons in this
PTSD model. Thirdly, similar
to other hippocampal memory
engram labeling studies [76, 91, 92], almost exclusively excitatory
cells were labeled by tdTomato expression, leaving the contribu-
tion of local
interneurons unresolved. Also, the majority of the
behavioral cohorts lacked comparison to naïve control mice.
Control groups that were subjected to behavioral testing were
originally included in these experiments, but the associated stress
exposure disqualiﬁed them as adequate controls. Inclusion of non-
stressed (naïve) control mice instead, would have allowed us to
additionally assess the main effects of trauma exposure, and
subsequently determine whether differences between susceptible

and resilient phenotypes were related to either excessive
(maladaptive) responses or the lack of adaptive responses to
stress in susceptible mice. Future studies should include these
comparisons. Lastly, current observations are only descriptive and
further mechanistic studies will be necessary to elucidate a causal
link between the observed vDG alterations and trauma-related
behavior.

Concluding, we found little evidence for aberrant dDG
structure and function being related to PTSD-like symptomatol-
ogy in our PTSD model. In contrast, the vDG displayed several
deviations indicative of aberrant glutamatergic and GABAergic
regulation of granule cell activity in PTSD susceptible mice
compared to those that are resilient. These changes appeared
associated with elevated anxiety-like behavior even prior to
trauma exposure, and higher
to novel
contexts. Thereby, the vDG seems critically involved in establish-
ing the PTSD-like symptoms as assessed in our mouse model,
and may be an important target for further research into the
psychopathology of PTSD.
