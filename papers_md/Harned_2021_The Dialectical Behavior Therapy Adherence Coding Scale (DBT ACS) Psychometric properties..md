Abstract

The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Adherence Coding Scale (DBT ACS) is an observer-rated 
measure used to evaluate the extent to which therapists deliver individual and group DBT with 
adherence to the manual. Despite its frequent use in clinical trials of DBT, relatively little is 
known about its psychometric properties. The present study utilized data from six clinical trials 
conducted in research and community settings with a variety of patient populations. Across 
these studies, the DBT ACS was used to code a total of 1,271 DBT individual therapy sessions 
and 180 DBT group sessions. Results indicate the DBT ACS computed global score has good 
internal consistency (α = 0.81) and excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.93). A confirmatory 
factor analysis found that a single factor yielded acceptable goodness of fit indices. The DBT 
ACS discriminated between DBT and another treatment and between research and community 
therapists. Across studies, variability in adherence scores was attributable more to therapists (33%) 
than to patients (15%). Both therapist and patient variability were higher in effectiveness than 
efficacy trials. Generalizability coefficients indicated that 5 sessions are needed to estimate a 
dependable adherence score at the patient level, whereas 9–15 sessions are needed to achieve 
adequate generalizability at the therapist level. Fewer sessions were needed to yield dependable 
scores for community therapists compared to research therapists. The DBT ACS appears to be a 
reliable, valid, and dependable method of assessing therapist adherence to individual and group 
DBT across diverse treatment settings, therapist types, and patient populations.

which the therapist utilizes the prescribed procedures and avoids proscribed procedures” of 
a treatment (Perepletchikova, Treat, & Kazdin, 2007; p. 829). In psychotherapy research, 
standardized measures of therapist adherence are a crucial element of conducting high­
quality research as they enable researchers to demonstrate that the treatment that was studied 
was delivered as intended (Kocsis et al., 2010). In clinical practice, these measures can 
be used to inform hiring decisions, certify therapists, evaluate the effectiveness of clinical 
training, and monitor and provide feedback about the quality of treatment delivery in routine 
care (Schoenwald et al., 2011). As increasing emphasis has been placed on the need to 
measure therapist adherence, there has been a proliferation of measures developed to assess 
adherence to many different treatment models.

A systematic review by Schoenwald and Garland (2013) identified 249 unique adherence 
measures that have most often been used to assess therapist adherence to cognitive 
behavioral treatments (59.0%), motivational interviewing (15.3%), family therapy (14.5%), 
and interpersonal psychotherapy (14.1%). These measures have utilized direct observational 
methods (71.5%; e.g., rating video-recorded sessions) and indirect written methods (26.1%; 
e.g., therapist or patient report). A variety of rating scales have been used, including 
occurrence (yes/no), frequency counts, and numeric values that require raters to make a 
judgment about the extent to which something occurred. Information about psychometric 
properties was only reported for 35% of these measures and most often included evaluating 
reliability, including inter-rater reliability (23.7%) and internal consistency reliability 
(7.6%). Indices of validity (concurrent, convergent, discriminant, or predictive) were 
reported for less than 5% of the measures. This lack of knowledge about the reliability 
and validity of many measures of therapist adherence limits the ability to draw conclusions 
from the scores they generate.

One such measure is the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Adherence Coding Scale (DBT ACS; 
Linehan & Korslund, 2003), which is the gold standard measure of therapist adherence to 
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a well-studied psychotherapy with a large 
body of research supporting its effectiveness in treating suicidal and self-injurious behavior 
(DeCou, Comtois, & Landes, 2018), borderline personality disorder (BPD; Storebø et al., 
2020), and a wide range of other disorders and problems in both adults and adolescents 
(Miga, Neacsiu, Lungu, Heard, & Dimeff, 2019). As the evidence base for DBT began to 
accumulate in the 1990s, it became increasingly clear that a measure of therapist adherence 
to DBT was needed. After many years of iterative development, the 66-item observer-rated 
DBT ACS was finalized in 2003. From 2003 to 2015, 24 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
of standard or adapted DBT were conducted of which 8 (33.3%) used the DBT ACS 
and 16 (66.7%) did not use any standardized measure of therapist adherence (Miga et 
al., 2019). Since 2015, the DBT ACS has remained the only standardized measure of 
therapist adherence used in DBT clinical trials (e.g., Harned, Schmidt, Korslund, & Gallop, 
2020; McCauley et al., 2018). However, studies utilizing the DBT ACS have typically 
only reported descriptive data about the degree to which therapists were adherent to the 
model. Only one study has reported psychometric information about the DBT ACS with 
results indicating that the measure had excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99; Harned, 
Korslund, & Linehan, 2014). Thus, despite its use in many clinical trials of DBT, the 
psychometric properties of the DBT ACS are largely unknown.

As with other treatments, a significant challenge of measuring therapist adherence to DBT 
is that it is not a stable quality and can be influenced by factors associated with the 
therapist and the patient. Studies evaluating therapist adherence to other psychotherapies 
(e.g., Boswell et al., 2013; Imel, Baer, Martino, Ball, & Carroll, 2011) have found significant 
variability in adherence between therapists (i.e., when aggregating across patients on each 
therapist’s caseload) as well as within therapists (i.e., between patients treated by the same 
therapist). Given this variability, the DBT ACS manual specifies that the score should be 
interpreted as a description of the degree to which the therapist delivered DBT according to 
the treatment manual in a given individual or group therapy session, and not as an indicator 
of the therapist’s general degree of adherence (Linehan & Korslund, 2003). However, it 
is sometimes necessary to make judgments about whether a specific therapist generally 
delivers DBT with adherence (e.g., for hiring purposes) and/or whether a specific patient 
generally received adherent DBT (e.g., as a manipulation check in clinical trials). Therefore, 
it is important to know how many sessions must be coded with the DBT ACS before 
a reliable and stable judgment about adherence can be made at both the therapist and 
patient level. This form of reliability is referred to as the “dependability” of a measure in 
generalizability theory, which is defined as the accuracy with which one can generalize 
from specific measurements to the universe of potential measurements (Webb, Shavelson, & 
Haertel, 2006). Given that observational coding of sessions is highly resource-intensive, it 
would be ideal if a reliable estimate of therapist adherence could be generated by the DBT 
ACS without requiring a prohibitively large number of sessions to be coded.

Another complicating factor in measuring therapist adherence is that the degree of therapist 
variability is likely to differ between DBT therapists working in research versus community 
settings. Therapists hired to work in DBT clinical trials are typically highly trained, selected 
based on their ability to consistently deliver the treatment with adherence, and closely 
monitored during the trial to reduce drift (e.g., Linehan et al., 2006; McCauley et al., 2018). 
These procedures are intended to minimize therapist variability in order to maximize internal 
validity of the treatment being studied. In contrast, DBT therapists working in community 
settings have a wide range of training backgrounds, are not required to demonstrate 
adherence to DBT, and are not formally monitored for adherence during routine treatment 
delivery (e.g., Feigenbaum et al., 2011; Landes et al., 2016). As a result, there is likely to be 
substantially more variability in therapist adherence in community settings. Indeed, studies 
of therapist adherence to Motivational Interviewing have found that therapists account for 
less than 15% of the variability in adherence in efficacy trials (Imel et al., 2011) compared 
to an average of 40% in dissemination trials involving community therapists (Imel et al., 
2014). Given that the dependability of therapist adherence scores increases as the proportion 
of variance in adherence attributable to therapists increases (Baldwin, Imel, & Atkins, 2012), 
fewer sessions may need to be coded to achieve adequate generalizability of DBT ACS 
scores among community therapists than research therapists.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the reliability (internal consistency, 
interrater, dependability) and validity (structural, discriminant) of the DBT ACS using 
archival data from six clinical trials of DBT, including four efficacy RCTs conducted in 
academic research settings (Linehan et al., 2009; Linehan et al., 2015; Harned et al., 2014; 
McCauley et al., 2018) and two effectiveness trials conducted in community practice settings

(Harned et al., 2020; Priebe et al., 2012). Given that the DBT ACS is used to generate 
a global adherence score, we sought to confirm that a one-factor structure adequately 
represented the data and that the computed global score had good internal consistency. 
Based on prior research (Harned et al., 2014), we also hypothesized that the DBT ACS 
would have excellent interrater reliability. Consistent with adherence measures for other 
treatments (e.g., Southam-Gerow, et al., 2016), we hypothesized that the DBT ACS would 
discriminate between DBT and a different treatment as well as between research and 
community therapists who were expected to have different levels of expertise in DBT. 
Finally, we hypothesized that therapist variance in adherence would be smaller among 
research therapists compared to community therapists and, as a result, more sessions would 
need to be coded to achieve a dependable DBT ACS score among research than community 
therapists.

Measure

Data for this study were derived from six clinical trials in which the DBT ACS was used 
to evaluate adherence to DBT (see Table 1). Across these studies, the DBT ACS was used 
to code a total of 1,271 DBT individual therapy sessions involving 84 therapists and 292 
patients as well as 180 DBT group skills training sessions involving 31 therapists and 13 
groups of patients. Descriptive data on the number of patients, therapists, and individual 
and group sessions coded in each study, as well as the average DBT ACS computed 
global scores, are presented in Table 2. This project was approved by the VA Puget Sound 
Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Across the six studies, a total of 15 raters coded sessions using the DBT ACS, including the 
gold standard DBT adherence rater (K. Korslund) and 14 additional raters. Training involved 
reading the DBT ACS manual (Linehan & Korslund, 2003), independently coding a set of 
calibration tapes, and discussing discrepancies from the gold standard ratings to ensure that 
raters were interpreting items similarly. Raters were considered reliable when their scores 
on the DBT ACS computed global score were within 0.3 points from the gold standard 
rating for at least 5 sessions. Once deemed reliable, raters began coding sessions as part of 
the studies in which they were involved. In each study, reliability checks were periodically 
conducted for each rater to ensure they had not drifted from the gold standard coder and to 
re-calibrate if needed.

The DBT ACS (Linehan & Korslund, 2003) is used to code both individual and group 
therapy sessions for adherence to DBT. It is comprised of 66 items arrayed across 12 
subscales that reflect the major therapeutic strategies used in DBT as specified in the 
treatment manual (Linehan, 1993). Because DBT is a principle-driven treatment (rather than 
a protocol-based treatment), the therapist strategies that are used in any given session are 
not pre-determined and are instead influenced by the patient’s behavior and the theories 
underlying the treatment. Accordingly, strategies (items) are contextual and include “if/then”

rules for when they must be coded. Raters are therefore required to first determine if a 
particular strategy (item) was present. If not present, the rater must then determine if the 
strategy was necessary given the context of the session. If present, the rater must determine 
if the strategy was done sufficiently (frequency, duration, execution) given the context of 
the session. Each item is rated on a scale where 0 = not used/not necessary, 1 to 3 = below 
adherence, 4 = minimum threshold for adherence, and 5 = adherent with high sufficiency. 
The 4.0 threshold for adherent delivery of each item is based on the description of the 
strategy provided in the DBT manual (Linehan, 1993). All non-zero items are averaged 
to create a computed global score where 4.0 and higher is considered “adherent.” For 
individual therapy sessions, the entire session is coded. For group therapy sessions, either 
the homework review portion (first half) or the skills teaching portion (second half) are 
coded and the group leader and co-leader are treated as if they were one therapist (i.e., 
coding is based on their combined behaviors).

Data Analysis

SAS 9.4 statistical software was used for the analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to 
provide information about average scores, ranges, and rates of non-adherent observations by 
mode of treatment, study, and subscale. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested how 
well the DBT ACS items conformed to a single dimension. To determine goodness of fit, 
the following indices and thresholds were used: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation 
(RMSEA < 0.06; Hu & Bentler, 1999), Comparative Fit Index (CFI > 0.95; Byrne, 2006), 
Normed Fit Index (NFI > 0.90; Bentler & Bonett, 1980), and Nonnormed Fit Index (NNFI 
> 0.90; Bentler & Bonett, 1980). Internal consistency for the computed global score 
was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Interrater reliability was computed as 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using the random-effects estimate with two raters 
pooled (ICC[2,2]; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). All ICCs compared the gold standard DBT 
adherence coder (K. Korslund) to another randomly selected coder. ICCs were calculated for 
the DBT ACS computed global score using all available observations as well as separately 
by study, subscale, and mode of treatment. According to Cicchetti’s (1994) criteria for 
interpreting ICCs, less than .40 is poor, .40–.59 is fair, .60–.74 is good, and .75–1.00 is 
excellent. Discriminant validity was evaluated by calculating DBT ACS scores when the 
measure is used to code a non-DBT treatment: individual drug counseling sessions that 
were randomly selected from the control condition of Study 2. Individual drug counseling 
(Mercer & Woody, 1999) is a substance use disorder treatment that applies the 12-step 
approach to treating addiction and is not a cognitive-behavioral treatment. In addition, 
discriminant validity was evaluated by conducting an independent samples t-test to compare 
average scores between research and community therapists.

Mixed effects models (MEM) were used to estimate ICCs indicating the proportion of 
variance in adherence scores for DBT individual therapy that was explained by therapists 
(i.e., between-therapist variability) and patients (i.e., within-therapist variability). The data in 
this study included three levels: adherence scores (Level 1) nested within patients (Level 2) 
and patients nested within therapists (Level 3). Variance explained by patients is accounted 
for at Level 2, whereas variance explained by therapists is accounted for at Level 3. Both 
patients and therapists were treated as random effects to allow for examination of variability

at multiple levels and study and session included as fixed effects. Pooled ICCs were 
estimated across all studies as well as separately by study and type of therapist (research 
versus community).

Finally, to evaluate the reliability (dependability) of the DBT ACS across multiple 
measurements, generalizability coefficients (GCs) were calculated based on a random effects 
model incorporating therapists, patients, and sessions in the design. Using equations for 
GC given in Webb, Shavelson, and Haertel (2006), we calculated the patient-level GCs as 
follows:

GCp =

σ2

t + σ2

p:t +

σ2

t

p:t + σ2
σ2

ps: t, e

The therapist-level GCs were calculated as follows:

GCt =

σ2

t +

σ2
p:t
np

+

σ2
t
σ2
ts

+

σ2

ps: t, e

where p = patients, t = therapists, s = sessions, and e = residual error. As these equations 
indicate, GCs are impacted by the proportion of total variance attributable to the therapist 
such that the larger the amount of between-therapist variance, the fewer observations are 
needed to achieve a particular GC. This is because the more variance that can be accounted 
for by therapists, the less variance remains unexplained (i.e., residual error variance) making 
it easier to predict a therapist’s “true” adherence score (Baldwin et al., 2012).

Using these formulas, GCs were calculated to determine: (1) the number of individual 
therapy sessions needed to determine a dependable (stable) adherence score for a single 
patient-therapist dyad (i.e., patient-level generalizability), and (2) the number of individual 
therapy sessions and/or patients needed to determine a dependable (stable) adherence score 
for a therapist (i.e., therapist-level generalizability). Using the cut-offs recommended by 
Webb et al. (2006), a GC of 0.80 was considered adequate. GCs were calculated for the 
sample as a whole and by therapist type (research vs. community). A benefit of these models 
is that they yield robust GC estimates in unbalanced designs (Cnaan, Laird, & Slasor, 
1997) such as the present study in which the number of coded sessions per therapist varied 
considerably (M = 15.1, SD = 17.8, range = 1–93). Nonetheless, to ensure the stability of the 
results we used the approach by Clarke and colleagues (Clarke & Wheaton, 2007; Clarke, 
2008) to conduct sensitivity analyses in which the GCs were re-calculated after trimming 
the available observations per therapist by 10% (retaining therapists who had between 2–39 
sessions coded) and 20% (retaining therapists who had between 3–25 sessions coded).

Descriptive data for the DBT ACS computed global score by study and mode of treatment 
are provided in Table 2 and descriptive data for the DBT ACS computed global score and 
subscale scores across all studies are provided in Table 3.

Internal Consistency

To calculate the internal consistency of the DBT ACS, all items were first recoded to create a 
continuous rating scale with higher scores indicating greater adherence. Specifically, the two 
values from the original rating scale that meet the minimum threshold for adherence (0 and 
4) were collapsed into a single value (4). The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the computed 
global score was 0.81, indicating that the DBT ACS has good internal consistency.

Structural Validity

A CFA with one dimension that included all of the items (with 0 recoded to 4 as described 
above) yielded an acceptable fit: RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.95, NNFI = 0.92. This 
indicates that the use of a computed global score adequately represents the data.

Interrater Reliability

Interrater reliability was computed using data from 94 DBT individual and group sessions 
from Studies 1–5 that were randomly selected to be coded for the purpose of evaluating 
inter-rater reliability as part of the procedures of the original studies. As shown in Table 3, 
interrater reliability was excellent for the DBT ACS computed global score (ICC = 0.93) 
and subscale scores (ICCs = 0.78 – 0.90). In addition, the DBT ACS had excellent interrater 
reliability when used to code DBT individual therapy (n = 78 sessions, ICC = 0.92) as well 
as DBT skills groups (n = 16 sessions, ICC = 0.96). Finally, the DBT ACS had excellent 
interrater reliability in 4 studies (Study 1: n = 37 sessions, ICC = 0.93; Study 2: n = 28 
sessions, ICC = 0.89; Study 3: n = 9 sessions, ICC = 0.99; Study 5: n = 6 sessions, ICC = 
0.83) and good interrater reliability in one study (Study 4: n = 14 sessions, ICC = 0.70).

Discriminant Validity

Discriminant validity was evaluated by using the DBT ACS to rate a total of 53 individual 
drug counseling sessions involving 4 therapists and 16 patients. As expected, 100% of these 
sessions were rated as not adherent to DBT and the average DBT ACS computed global 
score was 3.53 (SD = 0.22, range = 2.89 – 3.92). In addition, if the DBT ACS is a valid 
measure of adherence to DBT, the expectation would be that it would discriminate between 
DBT therapists with different levels of expertise. To evaluate this, adherence scores were 
compared between highly trained research therapists delivering DBT as part of efficacy trials 
(n = 62, Studies 1–4) and community therapists delivering DBT in effectiveness trials (n = 
22, Studies 5 and 6). To conduct this comparison, an average DBT ACS computed global 
score was computed for each therapist across all available sessions and patients. Research 
therapists had significantly higher average computed global scores (M = 4.14, SD= 0.12) 
than community therapists (M = 3.96, SD = 0.21; t (82) = 4.77, p < .001). In addition, a 
significantly higher proportion of sessions conducted by research therapists were adherent

(M = 0.84 SD = 0.22) than sessions conducted by community therapists (M = 0.52, SD= 
0.41; t (82) = 4.60, p < .001).

Variance Attributable to Therapists and Patients

Using data from individual therapy sessions, the pooled ICC for therapists was 0.33 (range 
= 0.05 – 0.54) and the pooled ICC for patients was 0.15 (range = 0.11 – 0.35), indicating 
that therapists and patients accounted for 33% and 15% of the variance in adherence, 
respectively. Table 4 includes the therapist and patient ICCs for each study as well as by 
therapist type. Consistent with our hypothesis, therapist variance in adherence was higher 
among community therapists (45%) than research therapists (27%). In addition, patients 
accounted for more of the variance in therapist adherence among community therapists 
(32%) than research therapists (14%).

Reliability (Dependability) Across Multiple Measurements

Using data from individual therapy sessions, generalizability coefficients (GC) were 
calculated at the patient- and therapist-level to determine the number of sessions and/or 
patients that would need to be coded using the DBT ACS to generate a reliable (dependable) 
score across studies as well as separately for research versus community therapists. At the 
patient level, results indicate that 5 sessions are needed to achieve adequate generalizability 
(GC = 0.82) in the sample as a whole. Consistent with our hypothesis, the number of 
sessions needed to achieve adequate patient-level generalizability was larger among research 
therapists (8 sessions, GC = 0.82) than community therapists (2 sessions, GC = 0.84).

At the therapist level, GCs were calculated for various numbers of sessions per patient 
(ranging from 1 to 5). As shown in Table 5, in the full sample the total number of 
sessions needed to achieve adequate generalizability at the therapist level ranged from 9 
(1 session per 9 patients) to 15 (5 sessions per 3 patients). Consistent with our hypothesis, 
the number of sessions needed to achieve adequate therapist-level generalizability was larger 
among research therapists (20–25 sessions) than community therapists (6–15 sessions). 
Figure 1 illustrates the number of patients and sessions per patient that were needed to 
achieve adequate generalizability (GC = 0.80) among all therapists, research therapists, and 
community therapists. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the patient- and therapist-level GC 
estimates remained stable (0.79–0.81) after trimming the data to reduce variability.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dialectical 
Behavior Therapy Adherence Coding Scale (DBT ACS) when used by trained coders to 
rate DBT individual and group therapy sessions. Analyses were conducted using data from 
six clinical trials in which the DBT ACS was used to code a total of 1,271 individual therapy 
sessions and 180 group therapy sessions. The results indicate that the DBT ACS can be 
used to reliably assess therapist adherence to DBT, differentiate DBT from other treatments, 
and discriminate between DBT therapists with varying levels of expertise. Additionally, the 
DBT ACS captures variability in adherence between and within therapists and can be used 
to generate dependable estimates of therapist adherence to DBT.

The DBT ACS is a comprehensive measure that includes the full spectrum of therapist 
strategies articulated in the DBT manual. Given that DBT is a principle-driven treatment, 
most strategies are not pre-determined or required; instead, therapists select strategies based 
on the patient’s behavior and the principles underlying the treatment. Accordingly, the DBT 
ACS requires raters to determine the degree to which each strategy was used and/or needed 
given the context of the session. Strategies that were present or needed are averaged to create 
a computed global score indicative of the overall adherence of the session. The present 
results confirmed that a single factor fit the data well and the measure had good internal 
consistency (α = 0.81), both of which support the use of the computed global score as the 
recommended scoring method.

The DBT ACS was also found to have excellent interrater reliability for the computed global 
score (ICC = 0.93) and 11 of the 12 subscales (ICCs = 0.78 – 0.90). Interrater reliability 
could not be calculated for the Exposure subscale due to the lack of non-zero scores for 
the item measuring use of formal exposure. These estimates of interrater reliability compare 
favorably to those found for standardized measures of adherence to other psychotherapies 
(e.g., Barber, Liese, & Abrams, 2003; Bjaastad et al., 2015; Segal, Teasdale, Williams, & 
Gemar, 2002; Southam-Gerow et al., 2016). Additionally, interrater reliability was excellent 
(ICCs = 0.83–0.99) in 4 of the 5 studies for which these data were available and good 
(ICC = 0.70) in the one study that was restricted to adolescent patients (McCauley et al., 
2018). It is possible that therapists’ delivery of DBT to adolescents may be more challenging 
to code at excellent levels of reliability, and this should be examined in future research. 
Finally, interrater reliability was excellent for both individual and group DBT (ICCs = 0.92–
0.96), indicating that the DBT ACS can be used to reliably code both modes of treatment. 
Altogether, these findings suggest that the existing methods of training raters to use the DBT 
ACS appear to be effective in creating high levels of rater accuracy and agreement.

A critical element in determining the construct validity of the DBT ACS is to ensure that it 
can distinguish DBT from other treatments. In the present study, this was evaluated by using 
the DBT ACS to code sessions from individual drug counseling (Mercer & Woody, 1999), 
a substance use treatment that uses the 12-step approach and was expected to be unrelated 
to DBT. Results indicated that the DBT ACS accurately identified 100% of individual 
drug counseling sessions as not being DBT, suggesting that it can effectively discriminate 
between DBT and dissimilar treatments. Future research might also evaluate the degree to 
which the DBT ACS discriminates between DBT and other cognitive-behavioral treatments 
that utilize some similar therapist strategies (e.g., cognitive modification and contingency 
management), but should also be distinct from DBT in other areas (e.g., structural and 
dialectical strategies). The DBT ACS was also found to discriminate between therapists of 
differing levels of expertise. Similar to studies of other treatments (e.g., Southam-Gerow 
et al., 2016), research therapists in efficacy trials were found to demonstrate significantly 
higher adherence than community therapists in effectiveness trials. This difference would 
be expected given that research therapists were highly trained and required to demonstrate 
the ability to consistently deliver DBT with adherence, whereas therapists delivering DBT 
in routine practice settings vary widely in terms of training and are not held to rigorous 
adherence standards. This finding also supports the validity of the DBT ACS as a measure

that can be used to identify therapists with higher and lower levels of proficiency in 
delivering DBT.

The DBT ACS was also found to capture significant variance both between and within 
therapists in their delivery of DBT individual therapy, which is consistent with prior studies 
of therapist adherence to other psychotherapies (e.g., Boswell et al., 2013; Imel, Baer, 
Martino, Ball, & Carroll, 2011). Across the six clinical trials, a greater proportion of the 
variance in therapist adherence was attributable to therapists (33%) than to patients (15%), 
indicating that differences in adherence tend be larger between therapists than between 
patients treated by the same therapist. Future research is needed to identify therapist factors 
that may influence adherence to DBT. In addition, given that a majority of the variance in 
therapist adherence (52%) was not explained by therapists or patients, additional research 
is needed to identify other factors that may influence therapists’ delivery of DBT (e.g., 
characteristics of the dyad, team, or organization). As hypothesized, between-therapist 
variability in adherence to DBT was higher among community therapists (45%) than 
research therapists (27%), a finding similar to studies of therapist adherence to other 
psychotherapies (e.g., Imel et al., 2011; Imel et al., 2014). This suggests that DBT programs 
in community settings are likely to include therapists who vary considerably in their ability 
to deliver the treatment adherently. Therefore, efforts to improve the quality of DBT in these 
settings should include strategies to identify and provide additional support to therapists 
struggling to deliver DBT with adherence, perhaps by using a model in which therapists 
with higher levels of adherence function as coaches or consultants to their less adherent team 
members.

Within-therapist variability in adherence to DBT was also higher among community 
therapists (32%) than research therapists (14%), indicating that the ability of community 
therapists to adhere to DBT varies considerably based on the characteristics of the patient, 
whereas research therapists’ delivery of DBT is more consistent across patients. This may be 
due to the fact that patients treated in community settings are typically more heterogeneous 
than those treated in efficacy trials and therapists may find it harder to deliver DBT 
consistently across patients with diverse diagnoses and presenting problems. There may 
also be specific patient characteristics that tend to pull therapists out of adherence, perhaps 
particularly among therapists with less expertise in DBT. For example, greater patient 
interpersonal aggression and Axis II traits are associated with lower therapist adherence 
to CBT for panic disorder (Boswell et al., 2013; Zickgraf et al., 2016). Future research 
is needed to identify patient characteristics that may be associated with higher or lower 
adherence to DBT among therapists with varying levels of expertise. Additionally, therapist 
training and supervision should be structured to include review and feedback across multiple 
cases to account for variability in adherence across patients.

Given the significant variability evident in therapists’ delivery of DBT, if judgments are 
made about a therapist’s general practice of DBT based on a single session or a single 
patient, they are likely to be unreliable and unstable. Indeed, using data from the full 
therapist sample, the present results indicated that a minimum of 9 sessions (1 session 
each for 9 patients) must be coded with the DBT ACS to generate a reliable estimate of 
a therapist’s typical level of adherence. As hypothesized, the number of sessions needed

to achieve adequate therapist-level generalizability was lower among community therapists 
(6–15 sessions) than research therapists (20–25 sessions) due to the different levels of 
therapist variance in adherence in the two groups. Given the resource-intensive nature of 
observational coding, it is likely to be infeasible to code this number of sessions in most 
contexts. For example, these estimates exceed the number of sessions that are typically 
coded with the DBT ACS when hiring research therapists to work in DBT efficacy trials 
where the goal is to select therapists who generally deliver DBT with adherence (e.g., 
Linehan et al., 2006). Of note, fewer sessions (2–8) are needed to generate a reliable 
estimate of whether a given patient received adherent DBT, which may be more feasible for 
those who need to make these decisions (e.g., as a manipulation check in clinical trials). In 
general, it is important for those who use the DBT ACS to be clear about the conclusions 
that can be drawn depending on the number of sessions that are coded. For example, coding 
a single session may be useful to determine if a therapist has the capability to deliver DBT 
adherently, but should not be used to draw conclusions about a therapist’s general practice of 
DBT.

From a content perspective, it is also important to highlight that therapists generally 
delivered DBT according to the manual: over 85% of coded sessions met the criterion 
for adherence on the DBT ACS computed global score and, in all but one study, 75% 
or more of sessions were adherent. The study with the lowest rate of adherent sessions 
(52%) included primarily master’s level therapists (88%) working in public mental health 
agencies who were relatively inexperienced in delivering DBT (M = 15 months; Harned et 
al., 2020). In terms of specific strategies, the highest levels of adherence were found for 
the Reciprocal Communication and Validation subscales, which are the primary acceptance 
strategies used in DBT and involve therapists being warm and communicating that the 
patient’s responses make sense. Therapists exhibited relatively lower levels of adherence on 
the Problem Solving and Dialectical subscales, which measure a variety of change strategies 
(e.g., generating solutions, activating new behavior) and dialectical strategies (e.g., balancing 
therapeutic style and strategies, working for synthesis) that are essential to DBT. Only the 
Exposure subscale was delivered below adherence on average and these strategies were 
also the least likely to be used by therapists (4.3% of sessions). This is consistent with 
studies of other multi-component treatments that have found that therapists use exposure less 
often than other techniques (Jensen-Doss, Cusack, & de Arellano, 2008). Overall, these data 
suggest that therapists may find it easier to deliver the acceptance strategies of DBT, which 
involve behaving in a generally caring and nonjudgmental manner, compared to the change 
and dialectical strategies, which may require increased knowledge and technical skill to 
deliver effectively. These findings also highlight potential areas for improvement in therapist 
training and supervision efforts.

A significant strength of this study was the use of a large archival dataset that included 
1,451 coded sessions delivered by 115 therapists in six clinical trials of DBT conducted 
in diverse treatment settings. We also utilized rigorous statistical analyses to examine these 
data that took into account the nested and longitudinal nature of the data. Limitations of the 
study include that a majority of the data were from individual therapy sessions, and more 
ratings of group sessions would help to build confidence in the use of the DBT ACS to 
code this mode of treatment. In addition, most of the data were from efficacy trials in which

DBT was delivered by research therapists in academic settings, and the two effectiveness 
trials in which DBT was delivered by community therapists in routine practice settings 
accounted for less than 10% of the coded individual therapy sessions and none of the coded 
group sessions. Additional research is needed to expand on these initial findings with larger 
samples of community therapists, and particularly to establish the psychometric properties 
of the DBT ACS for groups led by community therapists. With one exception, the studies 
also included predominantly female patient samples, and research examining the DBT ACS 
in trials with a larger proportion of male patients would be useful. Another limitation is that 
the concurrent validity of the DBT ACS could not be investigated because there are no other 
established psychometrically sound measures of adherence to DBT.

The DBT ACS appears to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing adherence to 
DBT individual and group therapy when delivered by research and community therapists 
to adolescent and adult patients with varying clinical presentations. These findings provide 
support for the continued use of the DBT ACS for high stakes purposes where the need 
for accuracy is critical, such as in efficacy trials and DBT therapist certification programs. 
At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the DBT ACS is time-intensive, 
expensive, and can only be used by trained raters, making it impractical for widespread use 
as a quality assurance method. Therefore, in addition to the DBT ACS, pragmatic measures 
of therapist adherence to DBT are needed that can be used for lower stakes purposes such as 
training therapists and monitoring and improving the quality of DBT in routine care settings.

Public Significance Statement:

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy for individuals 
at high risk for suicide as well as those with borderline personality disorder. This study 
shows that the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Adherence Coding Scale is an effective 
measure for determining whether therapists deliver DBT according to the manual.

Figure 1. 
The number of patients and individual therapy sessions per patient that need to be coded to 
achieve adequate therapist-level generalizability (GC = 0.80). The lines indicate where the 
number of sessions results in a GC of 0.80 for all therapists (solid line), research therapists 
(dotted line), and community therapists (dashed line).
