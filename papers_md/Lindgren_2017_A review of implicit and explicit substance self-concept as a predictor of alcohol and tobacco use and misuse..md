Abstract

Background—This paper provides an overview of the self-concept as it relates to substance use. 
Self-concept has a long history in psychological theory and research; however, substance self-
concept (e.g., viewing one’s self as a drinker or smoker) is an understudied area of research with 
the potential to expand existing conceptualizations of substance use, addiction, and prevention and 
treatment efforts, and should receive greater research attention.

Objectives—First, we review and provide a theoretical framework of substance self-concept that 
draws from dual process models and distinguishes between implicit and explicit self-concept. 
Next, we summarize key findings related to substance use in the extant literature, focusing on 
alcohol and tobacco (smoking).

Results—Across both substances, there is converging evidence that substance self-concept is 
associated with substance use outcomes, including quantity and frequency of use and problems 
associated with use, and that change in substance self-concept is associated with recovery from 
substance misuse. Recommendations for the substance self-concept research agenda include 
routine assessment of substance self-concept, expanded use of implicit measures, investigation of

moderators of substance self-concept, and targeting substance self-concept directly in prevention 
and intervention efforts.

Conclusion—Ultimately, we suggest that substance self-concept is a promising, but 
understudied, construct. Greater research attention to substance self-concept could clarify its 
potential as an important risk factor for hazardous use and addiction as well as its utility as a 
prevention and treatment target.

Keywords

self-concept; identity; implicit self-concept; substance use; alcohol; smoking

Cognitive factors have long been studied in substance use (1–3). Explicit (reflective, slow, 
controlled) and implicit (reflexive, fast, automatic) cognitive factors have been investigated, 
with the majority of published research emphasizing the former and, recently, with 
increasing attention to the latter. When considering the content of cognitions about substance 
use, scant attention has been paid to cognitions about the self (i.e., self-concept) as relates to 
substance use. This scarcity is surprising given the long-standing emphasis on the self in 
psychology (4–6). Moreover, findings from studies that have evaluated substance use self-
concept (e.g., viewing one’s self as a drinker) have been promising (7–11), suggesting that 
increased research attention may be fruitful. Thus, we suggest that substance self-concept 
has been underemphasized in substance use research; that substance self-concepts may be 
important risk factors for substance misuse; and that targeting substance self-concepts may 
have clinical utility.

Accordingly, we provide a theoretical framework of the self-concept; extend that framework 
to substance self-concept; review the available literature; and offer recommendations for 
future research. We consider both explicit and implicit constructs and measures of substance 
self-concept and limit our review of findings to alcohol and tobacco because the bulk of the 
extant literature falls in those domains. Our review is not exhaustive, but rather highlights 
key theory, methodology, findings, and identifies important gaps and reflects our background 
in social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Cognitions about the self and substance use 
have been alternatively referred to as aspects of the self, one’s identity, one’s self-image, 
one’s self-schema, and/or one’s self-concept. We consider those terms interchangeable and 
use the term self-concept in this paper. We begin with a primer on self-concept.

What is Self-Concept?

The self is a complex system of processes, beliefs, and states, from which different 
constructs can be posited, including self-concept (12). At the same time, the self is a social 
phenomenon that arises from social experience and changes with it (13). Psychological 
interest in the self can be traced to the theorizing about the “I” and the “me” by William 
James (4). According to James, the “I” represents the aspect of the self that actively and 
subjectively perceives, organizes, and interprets our experience. In contrast, the “me” 
represents the aspect of the self that becomes the object of our attention or perception when 
we think about ourselves. It is the “me” aspect of the self that maps most closely onto the 
self-concept.

With respect to locating self-concept within a larger theoretical formulation of behavior, 
including substance use, we draw from dual process models (14,15), which focus on the 
contributions of two types of cognitions to behavior. One type, explicit cognitions, refers to 
cognitions that are slower, reflective, and introspective, and are posited to have a greater 
impact on behavior under conditions when an individual can process information 
deliberately (14). The other, implicit cognitions, refers to cognitions that are faster, reflexive, 
and impulsive, and are posited to have a greater impact on behavior when self-regulation or 
cognitive control is impaired or when affect is strong (14). The dual process formulation has 
been extended to delineate two types of self-concept: implicit self-concept and explicit self-
concept (16,17), with the implicit self-concept referring to views about the self that are 
faster, reflexive, and impulsive, and explicit self-concept referring to views about the self 
that slower, reflective, and introspective. Consistent with that formulation, we distinguish 
between the construct (how one theorizes about implicit and explicit self-concept) and its 
measurement (how one measures implicit and explicit self-concept). We, therefore, discuss 
the construct and measurement of implicit and explicit self-concept in turn.

The Construct of Implicit Self-Concept

Individual differences in associative representations of the self may be referred to as the 
implicit self-concept. This definition follows from Greenwald and colleagues’ associative 
model (18), which conceptualizes the self or “me” as a central node in a network of mental 
associations representing social information (see Figure 1). This network also includes 
nodes representing positive or negative valence (e.g., good or bad) as well as nodes 
representing other, non-valence attributes (e.g. male or female). Implicit self-concepts are, 
thus, associations between the self (or “me”) node and a non-valence attribute node. An 
implicit self-concept could consist of an association about the self and a personality trait (me 
= shy; (17), gender (me = female; (19) or substance use (me = drinker; (20)). An individual 
would, therefore, have many implicit self-concepts. Further, an implicit self-concept’s 
strength would reflect the potential for one node to activate the other (e.g., how much does 
activation of drinker lead to activation of me?) and be bi-directional (18). Consistent with 
associative (and connectionist) theories of how information is represented mentally (21), 
activation of a node is presumed to occur by external stimuli (e.g., seeing an advertisement 
for beer leads to activation of drinker) or by internal stimuli, including an already activated 
node in the network (e.g., activation of college leads to activation of alcohol) as well as 
emotions or physiological states (e.g., feeling depressed leads to activation of alcohol). 
Implicit self-concepts that are activated repeatedly are posited to become activated more 
rapidly, possibly without awareness, and/or conscious control (22). A critical implication of 
this formulation is that individuals likely have limited insight into and control over implicit 
self-concept. For example, individuals may be unaware of and/or unable to consciously 
control their me = alcohol association or that association’s influence on their behavior. A 
second implication is that an individual’s implicit self-concepts can be differentially 
activated: some self-concepts will be stronger (or weaker); some will be highly interrelated, 
some will not; and each self-concept will activated by a unique set of external or internal 
stimuli.

The Construct of Explicit Self-Concept

The explicit self-concept may be defined as propositional representations of the self (e.g., “I 
am a drinker,” (14,16)). From this framework, representations of the self stem from an 
individual’s experience and rely on reflective processes (e.g., attention, awareness, 
introspection) and ultimately become condensed into a propositional statement about who 
the individual is (see Figure 1). This conceptualization is not only consistent with dual 
process models (14–16) but also with classic theories of personality, such as Bem’s Self-
perception Theory (23), which holds that individuals learn or “know” who they are from 
observing their own behavior and the circumstances surrounding their behavior. Across dual 
process models and Self-perception Theory, self-statements/self-knowledge are theorized to 
influence an individual’s intentions and ultimately, actual behavior.

Like implicit self-concept, explicit self-concept is dynamic and context-dependent. An 
individual is assumed to have many explicit self-concepts, and due to limits of attention and 
awareness, a subset would be available at any given moment (24). A critical implication of 
this formulation is, thus, the reliance on individuals’ awareness and introspection. This 
reliance would suggest that, in contrast to implicit self-concept, explicit self-concept is 
substantially more “know-able” – that is, all individuals need to do is to introspect. However, 
some caution is warranted given research demonstrating that individuals’ self-knowledge is 
limited, whether by motivation, opportunity, ability, and/or awareness (25), and that 
individuals often and unwittingly tell more than they actually know about themselves (26). 
This formulation also sheds light on how implicit and explicit self-concepts in the same 
domain (e.g., smoking) could differ within the same person. Depending upon awareness, 
ability, motivation, or opportunity, an individual might not have a strong explicit self-
concept but might have a strong implicit self-concept (or vice-versa).

Measurement of Self-Concept

When considering the measurement of self-concept, we describe the ways that implicit and 
explicit self-concepts are most commonly measured and their strengths and limitations. The 
Implicit Association Test or IAT (27) is the most commonly used measure of implicit self-
concept. It is a computer-based reaction time measure that requires participants to sort 
stimuli belonging to four different categories (e.g., me, not-me, smoker, non-smoker) using 
only two response buttons (e.g., computer keys “E” and “I”). In the critical blocks of an IAT, 
participants use one response button (e.g., “E”) to categorize stimuli representing the 
categories of me and smoker and another response button (e.g., “I”) to categorize stimuli 
representing the categories not-me and non-smoker. Then, the pairings are switched such 
that me and non-smoker require the “E” response and not-me and smoker require the “I” 
response. The difference in reaction times when responding under the two sets of 
instructions is considered a proxy for the relative strengths of the associations in memory.

IATs are quick to administer, are relatively resistant to faking (28,29), and have relatively 
high internal consistencies (17). The IAT does not require awareness of what is being 
measured and does not rely on verbal self-report, making it less subject to self-presentation 
concerns. Like any measure, it has limitations. It is computer-based, which inherently makes 
administration more complex than a self-report questionnaire. Test-re-test reliability

correlations for self-related IAT scores – often between .60–.70 – are higher than other 
implicit measures (e.g., evaluative priming tasks) but lower than self-report questionnaires 
(17). Further, the IAT is a relative measure – that is, by its nature, it evaluates the strengths 
of pairs of associations and cannot speak to the strength of a single set of associations. 
Finally, it is not process pure –while the IAT is described as a measure that evaluates implicit 
associations and processes, it most likely requires some use of controlled processes, too 
(30).

Explicit self-concept, in contrast, is typically evaluated by self-report. Such evaluation is 
straight-forward and technically uncomplicated: one simply asks individuals about how they 
view themselves. Thus, questionnaires are commonly used. To the degree that individuals’ 
knowledge about explicit self-concept is accessible via introspection, measures of explicit 
self-concept are useful, simple and inexpensive to administer, and often have high internal 
and test-re-test reliabilities (17). They also have limitations, including that individuals may 
not be aware of some explicit self-concept and/or may be motivated to present themselves in 
a particular light as well as measurement error. Perhaps the best illustration of the respective 
value of implicit and explicit measures comes from a meta-analytic review of 184 research 
studies (31). This meta-analysis found that, across nine different domains (e.g., intergroup 
behavior, political preferences, close relationships), implicit and explicit measures had 
predictive validity, suggesting that both are useful and not redundant.

Self-Concept and Substance Use

We now turn to extending dual process-models to implicit and explicit substance use self-
concept, specifically. Regarding implicit self-concept, we posit that engagement in substance 
use, exposure to cues or consequences of substance use, and how one’s culture regulates and 
perceives substance use will activate associations related to substance use and motivational 
orientations (e.g., alcohol = approach associations) and attitudes (e.g., alcohol = good 
associations) and coalesce into self-relevant associations (e.g., alcohol = me; implicit alcohol 
self-concept). We also posit that the same substance use behaviors and cues will contribute 
to one’s reflective, introspective experience of who one is, leading to the development of an 
explicit self-concept (e.g., the propositional statement “I am a drinker;” explicit alcohol self-
concept). Finally, we hypothesize that multiple substance self-concepts are possible at the 
implicit and explicit level: substance self-concept (e.g., alcohol self-concept), substance 
behavior self-concept (e.g., drinking self-concept), substance using group self-concept (e.g., 
drinker self-concept), and substance dependence self-concept (e.g., alcoholic/recovering 
alcoholic self-concept). Whether those self-concepts represent meaningful differences, and 
how those differences may vary for different stages of substance use is unknown.

A key issue is how substance self-concepts develop and change across stages of substance 
use (e.g., initiation, escalation, addiction, recovery). It is possible that children and 
adolescents could develop a substance self-concept before using (e.g., via exposure to family 
member’s use, peer use or media) and greater exposure to those sources could strengthen 
that self-concept. Initiation and escalation of substance use, in turn, could provide 
experiences that strengthen/weaken substance self-concept to the degree that experiences are 
reinforcing/non-reinforcing. Substance self-concepts might also become stronger and more

easily activated than other valued self-concepts, consistent with qualitative research that the 
loss of positive identities combined with the increase of a user self-concept appears to be 
one pathway into addiction (32). Conversely, abstaining from substance use may weaken 
substance self-concepts over time and lead to the development of new, incompatible self-
concepts (e.g., non-drinker self-concept) – consistent with theory and findings that that 
increased (explicit) recovery self-concept is associated with better treatment outcomes (33–
35).

Beyond the literature and frameworks common to social/personality and cognitive 
psychology, cognitive neuroscience approaches to addiction also have important 
implications for the development of substance self-concept and its influence on substance 
use. Specifically, recent reviews suggest that individuals who are addicted to alcohol or other 
substances may have impairments in neural circuits and/or cortical structures (e.g., the 
insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cortical midline structures) critical for self-
awareness, introspection, interoception, exteroception, and controlled decision-making (36–
38). Depending on the specific circuit or region of interest, different impairments or deficits 
related to self-awareness have been proposed. For example, a model by DeWitt and 
colleagues (36) suggests that individuals who are addicted to a substance become 
hypersensitive to substance-related cues over time. Those cues are posited to be increasingly 
“tagged” as self-relevant, which in turn, can lead to the development of a substance-related 
identity, which in turn can influence subsequent substance use. Additional work by Moeller 
and Goldstein (37) adds complexity to the picture; individuals with addictions appear to 
have impairments in their ability to introspect, their awareness of “who” they are, and their 
decisions. Taken together, these models might suggest that on the one hand, individuals with 
severe substance problems would have strong substance-related self-concepts, and that on 
the other hand, those individuals may be less aware of those self-concepts. This supposition 
would also imply a limit to a substance self-concept’s strength and/or usefulness as a 
predictor: its increasing strength (assuming that its strength is a function of heavy, chronic 
substance use) would also be accompanied by compromises to neural pathways critical for 
self-awareness and reflection. Although speculative, it may be that at heavy, chronic levels 
of use, explicit substance self-concept (the assessment of which relies on awareness) may be 
less helpful/predictive than implicit substance self-concept (the assessment of which does 
not rely on awareness). This reasoning would not only be consistent with research and 
models that focus on self-awareness deficits as a potential mechanism underlying addiction, 
but also with dual process models of substance use, which suggest that implicit cognitive 
processes generally become more dominant when substance use is habitual. Translational 
research that integrates social/personality/cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience 
approaches will be critical for understanding the underlying neural substrates of substance 
self-concept and how substance self-concept does (or does not) fit within current 
formulations of impaired self-awareness as potential mechanisms of addiction.

Implicit and Explicit Measures of Substance Self-Concept: Findings

We now turn to findings related to implicit and explicit measures of substance self-concept, 
focusing first on alcohol and then on tobacco.

Alcohol

Page 7

We conducted a PsycINFO search (with no date limitations) pairing all possible 
combinations of the terms alcohol or drink* with self-concept, self concept, self-schema, 
self schema, self association, or identity, and we found 26 published papers. We consider 
implicit and explicit alcohol self-concept in turn and summarize key findings therein.

First, researchers have assessed explicit alcohol self-concept using brief questionnaires 
adapted from the smoking literature (9) that ask individuals to rate their agreement with 
three to five statements concerning the extent to which drinking plays a part in one’s life and 
personality (e.g., Drinking is part of ‘who I am’). From a face validity standpoint, these 
items appear to map well onto the construct of explicit alcohol self-concept as 
conceptualized as a propositional statement about who one is with respect to drinking 
alcohol. These measures have good internal consistency, have been shown to predict unique 
variance in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and cravings with large effects 
sizes (9,39,40). Explicit alcohol self-concept also predicts attitudes towards drinking (41), 
binge drinking (42), is associated with greater difficultly in refusing a drink (43), and 
differentiates heavy drinking college students with severe AUDs from those with less severe 
AUDs (44). Explicit measures of alcohol self-concept have been added to prominent 
theoretical models of drinking (e.g., the Theory of Planned Behavior) and have been found 
to improve them (45). Recent studies have examined moderators of the relationship between 
explicit alcohol self-concept and drinking outcomes and have demonstrated that explicit 
alcohol self-concept is a stronger predictor of drinking outcomes among younger individuals 
(46) as well as in individuals high in individualism (47), high in levels of self-control (48), 
and low in motivation to reduce their drinking (49). Finally, explicit alcohol self-concept 
appears to mediate the positive relationship between drinking motives and alcohol 
consumption (49). To date, research is largely been cross-sectional. However, two studies 
have found that explicit alcohol self-concept predicts future drinking and problems even 
after controlling for current drinking (39,40). Additional longitudinal and experimental 
studies will be important to determine whether there is a causal relationship between alcohol 
self-concept and drinking outcomes.

A few studies have evaluated alcohol self-concept with respect to misuse and recovery. For 
example, a cross-sectional study evaluated two explicit alcohol-group self-concepts in a 
sample of recovering alcoholics (34). One four-item questionnaire asked individuals to rate 
their agreement with statements concerning the extent to which they identify with 
Alcoholics Anonymous and a second asked individuals to rate their agreement with 
statements about identifying as an addict (e.g., “Being an AA member/addict is a central part 
of who I am”). Having a recovering addict self-concept versus a using addict self-concept 
was correlated with higher recovery self-efficacy and reduced rates of relapse. Similarly, a 
prospective study of new residents at a treatment community for substance problems found 
that increases in seeing oneself as part of that community (treatment community self-
concept) predicted greater treatment retention among alcoholics (33).

Implicit alcohol self-concept has been evaluated using two variants of the IAT: the Alcohol 
Identity IAT (50) and the Drinker Identity (9). These IATs are similar, but not identical, in 
construction. The Drinker Identity IAT measures associations between words describing me

(me, my, mine, and self) versus not me (they, them, theirs, other) and words describing 
drinker (drinker, drink, drunk, and partier) versus non-drinker (non-drinker, abstain, sober, 
and abstainer). The drinker/non-drinker categories and stimuli, thus, include a combination 
of words describing the substance, behavior, and substance group. The Alcohol Identity IAT 
uses the same words as stimuli for me and not me but uses the category label alcohol 
(instead of drinking) and images of alcohol and the category label water (instead of non-
drinking) and images of water. Thus, the Alcohol Identity IAT specifically and exclusively 
evaluates the substance. These IATs have only been evaluated in separate studies, thus it is 
unknown whether these differences are meaningful.

Both IATs have good psychometrics and predict unique variance in multiple alcohol-related 
outcomes among college student and adult samples, including self-report and lab-based 
alcohol consumption, problems, harm, cravings, and behavioral economic indices of alcohol 
demand (9,20,41,46,50–53). The Drinker Identity IAT also predicted unique variance in 
drinking after controlling for explicit alcohol self-concept, other well-validated alcohol-
related IATs (9,20,39), and other well-validated cognitive factors (e.g., alcohol expectancies, 
drinking motives, social norms) associated with drinking outcomes (40). The Drinker 
Identity IAT was also the most consistent and unique predictor of drinking outcomes when 
multiple alcohol-related IATs were evaluated simultaneously (9,20). Preliminary evidence 
suggests both alcohol self-concept IATs prospectively predict risky alcohol behaviors and 
consumption, and that they do so after controlling for current drinking (39,40,50). Studies 
investigating moderation effects have found that implicit alcohol self-concept is a slightly 
stronger predictor of hazardous drinking for women, and may have small synergistic effects 
with explicit alcohol self-concept such that individuals who are low in both are especially 
unlikely to be drinkers (46).

Most studies with these IATs have had younger and non-clinical samples, raising questions 
about whether the IATs will generalize to older and/or clinical samples. There is some 
indirect and direct evidence suggesting they will. First, the IAT psychometric literature (54–
56) indicates that an IAT’s category labels (e.g., me, not me, drinker, and non-drinker) are 
more influential an IAT’s score than the IAT’s stimuli. Essentially, if stimulus items (drunk, 
partier) can easily be sorted into the higher order category (drinker), the higher order 
category will be more influential on the IAT score. Underlining this point, IATs have been 
created in which X’s and O’s were used as stimuli to represent categories (arts and math), 
and typical IAT effects (i.e., associating men with math and women with arts) were elicited 
(54). This suggests that even if a stimulus item (e.g., partier) is less relevant to individuals 
who are older and/or have more severe alcohol problems, the overall IAT would still be a 
valid measure of implicit drinker self-concept. Second and more directly, recent studies with 
large samples (< 10,000 individuals) that include a broad age range (18 to 80+) and the full 
range of scores on a measure of alcohol use disorder, indicate that the drinking identity IAT 
is a robust predictor of risk of an alcohol use disorders (46,53). Thus, while additional work 
with older and clinical samples is needed, preliminary evidence suggests that findings may 
generalize.

Tobacco (Smoking)

Page 9

We identified 60 published studies using the same “self” search terms combined with 
smok*, tobacco, or nicotine. Most studies assessed explicit smoking self-concept to predict 
current smoking behaviors or future intentions to smoke. Commonly, a categorical approach 
was used: participants were asked if they identify as a smoker or a type of smoker such as 
“social smoker” (57–59). While high in face validity, many individuals who reported 
smoking within the previous 30 days did not identify themselves as smokers of any type 
(60). These individuals (“deniers”; (57,59)) tend to smoke less frequently and report no 
failed quit attempts or addiction (59). The next most common approach to evaluating explicit 
smoking self-concept is to use brief questionnaires (57,61,62). For example, the smoking 
self-concept scale asks individuals to indicate their agreement with five statements 
describing how much smoking plays a part in one’s life and personality (e.g., Smoking is 
part of my personality; (63)). This measure has good internal consistency, and stronger 
explicit smoking self-concept appears to predict smoking escalation (8). The predictive 
utility of explicit measures has been demonstrated across a range of populations, 
differentiating daily smokers from intermittent and experimental smokers among college 
students (62), predicting greater usage of electronic cigarettes (64), and predicting the degree 
of tobacco dependence among patients in treatment settings (61). Further, explicit measures 
have examined the development of smoking self-concepts, which appear to be associated 
with increases in negative affect coping motives for smoking over time (65).

Smoking self-concept has been evaluated in relation to quitting and relapse. For example, 
quit attempts were negatively correlated with smoking self-concept and positively correlated 
with quitting smoking self-concept (e.g., “[Quitting] smoking within the next three months 
fits with the kind of person I want to be”; (66)). Smoking self-concept is also negatively 
correlated with prospective confidence in quitting at 1 and 6 months following assessment 
(61). For many smokers, smoking self-concept persists after quitting, but decreases over 
time, with less than a fifth reporting a residual smoker self-concept after two or more years 
of abstinence (11). To this end, self-reported identification as a non-smoker is positively 
correlated with intentions to quit (67), and continued abstinence among ex-smokers (68). 
The development of a recovery self-concept may also be protective for smokers attempting 
to quit. Greater preference for an “ex-smoker” as opposed to a “smoker” self-concept 
predicted lower relapse rates over a two-year period among ex-smokers who had been 
smoke-free at the time of self-concept assessment (34). Thus, explicit smoking self-concept 
predicts important smoking-related behaviors for current and former smokers.

Implicit smoking self-concept research is scant. Two published studies have evaluated 
implicit smoking self-concept using the IAT. Swanson and colleagues (69) developed an IAT 
evaluating self words (me, mine, self) and other words (they, them, other) and smoking 
words (smoke, cigarette, smokers) and stealing words (steal, robbery, thief). The stealing 
category was selected as a contrast to smoking because it is a negative behavior: most 
smokers and non-smokers view smoking as negative (on both implicit and explicit 
measures), and the researchers wanted to match smoking with another negatively-valenced 
category. An alternative version was also developed by the same research team; it used 
pictures of household scenes but varied whether or not smoking cues were present (69). Both

IATs were positively correlated with self-reported smoking behavior and self-reported 
preference for smoking. Further, there were significant differences in smoking self-concept 
IAT scores among smokers and non-smokers, with smokers having stronger self = smoking 
associations than non-smokers. A second study investigated whether context (i.e., movie 
clips with smoking or non-smoking actors) affected implicit smoking self-concept (70). 
Stronger implicit smoking self-concept was found among those participants who identified 
with the smoking actor, regardless of whether they actually smoked (70). That finding 
suggests that watching another person smoking could activate one’s implicit smoking self-
concept and that the IAT may be sensitive to that activation.

Summary and Integration

Several important themes emerge from the alcohol and tobacco self-concept literatures. 
There is substantial cross-sectional evidence that both explicit and implicit substance self-
concepts are positively associated with substance use behaviors. There is preliminary 
evidence that substance self-concept predicts prospective substance use, and that changes in 
substance self-concept are associated with treatment outcomes. Third, there is substantial 
evidence that implicit and explicit alcohol self-concept predicts unique variance in drinking 
behaviors. We would expect similar findings in the tobacco domain, but this question has yet 
to be investigated. Fourth, implicit alcohol self-concept is a more robust predictor of 
outcomes relative to other, well-validated implicit alcohol-related associations; we would 
predict similar (but know of no published) findings for smoking. Finally, moderation studies
—largely in the alcohol literature and largely focusing on explicit self-concept—are 
beginning to identify subsets of individuals for whom substance self-concept is a particularly 
robust predictor of substance use outcomes, with low motivation to change, self-control, and 
individualism emerging as significant moderators.

Recommendations

We now turn to recommendations for future research.

1. Assess Substance Self-Concept in Substance Use Research

An overarching recommendation is for substance self-concept to be routinely assessed in 
substance use research and evaluated as a candidate mechanism for substance use initiation, 
escalation, maintenance, and relapse. The extant literature demonstrates the promise of 
substance self-concepts as predictors of important substance use behaviors substances across 
the stages of use and misuse. However, it is critical to deepen our understanding of alcohol 
and tobacco self-concept via research with clinical and child/adolescent samples and to 
broaden our understanding of substance self-concept by extending its assessment to other 
substances (e.g., marijuana, opioids, stimulants). Additionally, there are critical, unanswered 
questions with respect to the exact role substance self-concept plays in use and misuse, 
which are important to address. For example, during early stages, substance self-concept 
may function largely as a marker of an individual’s use and level of risk whereas during later 
stages, its role may expand to become an additional driver of use.

2. Expand the Use of Implicit Measures of Substance Self-Concept

We particularly recommend expanded use of implicit measures of substance self-concept. 
Theory suggests and findings demonstrate that they account for unique variance in substance 
use outcomes. Further, implicit measures are less subject to self-presentation and social 
desirability concerns, and expanding their use may be particularly helpful because of the 
stigma surrounding substance use, misuse, and treatment. Additionally, findings and models 
from cognitive neurosciences regarding impairments in neural circuits and regions related to 
self-awareness and introspection among individuals with addictions suggest that implicit 
measures could be particularly valuable among heavier users and clinical samples.

3. Identify Moderators of Substance Self-concept

We recommend investigating potential moderators of substance self-concept. For example, 
individual will encounter situational or emotional cues (e.g., stress, other people, and 
particular street corners) that are likely increase or decrease the activation of substance self-
concepts and ultimately, substance use. Gaining an understanding of this interplay would 
provide important information on the boundary conditions of substance self-concept as a 
predictor. In addition, translational research that investigates how changes or impairments in 
neural circuits or regions critical for self-relevant processes might moderate the influence of 
substance self-concept would be useful for advancing theory and intervention.

4. Consider Substance Self-Concept as Potential Prevention and Treatment Targets

Substance self-concept should be investigated as a specific target for prevention and 
intervention efforts. One possible strategy would be to help individuals develop more 
adaptive identities. This might include the development of a recovery identity, which has 
been found to be associated with improved treatment outcomes (33–35); the development of 
a lower risk identity (e.g., a moderate drinker); and/or the development of another, valued 
aspects of an individual’s identity (e.g., family identity, professional identity). Motivational 
interviewing (MI) (71) may be ideally suited to changing individual substance self-concept 
because it includes an exploration of substance use’s fit with an individual’s overall values 
and goals. Further, positive treatment outcomes in MI have been linked to changes in self-
referential processes (72), and it is possible that could extend to self-concept. Cognitive bias 
modification (CBM) techniques, which typically adapt an implicit measure (e.g., an IAT) 
such that participants over-practice the adaptive bias (for example, pairing me and non-
drinker stimuli), might also offer a means to target substance self-concept. A recent study 
made an attempt (73), but both experiments in the study yielded null results, suggesting that 
much remains to be learned with respect to feasibility of this approach. Finally, mindfulness 
techniques, which are thought to target self-relevant processes more broadly (36), might also 
offer a means to reduce the activation, and ultimately, strength of substance self-concept.

Conclusion

Substance self-concept is underemphasized in research, which is surprising given 
psychology’s long tradition of studying the self. Although substance domains vary with 
respect to the amount and type of attention paid to self-concept, there is converging evidence 
that it is a unique predictor of drinking and smoking outcomes at different stages of the

increased attention to substance self-concept by using both implicit and explicit measures, 
investigating how substance self-concept develops, and evaluating it as a potential 
prevention and intervention target.

Figure 1. 
Illustration of implicit and explicit self-concept, adapted from dual process models. 
Individuals would have multiple self-concepts that can be activated via internal and external 
stimuli, with implicit self-concepts thought to reflect faster, more impulsive processes and 
explicit self-concepts thought to reflect slower, more deliberate processes. An implicit self-
concept is defined an associative representation of the self (e.g., me = shy, me = female, me 
= drinker). An explicit self-concept is defined as a propositional statement about who one is 
(e.g., I am shy, I am female, I am a drinker).
