Abstract: Background and Objective Burnout syndrome is well-documented and highly prevalent
among healthcare professionals. The literature search found studies mainly aimed at front-line
medical specialties, cardiologists, or physicians working in intensive care units. Workload and work
conditions favor the occurrence of burnout syndrome among social insurance physicians, with many
consequences on health status and a decrease in the quality of their work. We aimed to assess the
degree of vulnerability to developing burnout syndrome, factors associated with stress, and coping
strategies at social insurance physicians. Materials and Methods: Social insurance physicians working
in territorial services for medical assessment of work capacity from Romania participated in the
study. An observational study was performed to describe the extent of the exhaustion syndrome
among social insurance physicians (SIPhs). Three questionnaires were ﬁlled out by the participants: a
short version of MBI-HSS to analyze the degree of burnout, an interview with speciﬁc questions for
the source of stress and Brief-COPE for stress control. Brief demographic data were also collected.
Data were statistically analyzed with appropriate tests using PSPP software. Results: Seventy-four
physicians were included in the study. Fifty-six were females (75.7%) and twenty-eight (38%) had
moderate or high burnout and cognitive distortions with depression resulting as a major side-effect
(p < 0.001). Professional factors, mainly deadline pressure (p < 0.001) and high workload (p = 0.012),
have emerged as contributing factors to burnout syndrome. Mental disengagement (p = 0.001),
active coping (p = 0.006), and acceptance (p = 0.014) would improve stress control. Conclusion: More
than two-thirds of social insurance physicians had moderate and high burnout syndrome. The
development of strategies to standardize workload was identiﬁed as an important action area, along
with the long-term preservation of health status and professional performance.

1. Background

Burnout is deﬁned as a psychological syndrome resulting from chronic workplace
stress that has not been successfully managed, characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and
reduced professional efﬁciency. World Health Organization gives increasing importance to
the occurrence of burnout syndrome among employees. In 2019, the 72nd World Health
Assembly introduced it as an occupational phenomenon for the 11th revision that takes
effect in 2022 [1].

Burnout syndrome is well-documented and highly prevalent among healthcare profes-
sionals [2]. Studies reported ﬁgures of up to 80% of physicians, with substantial variability
in prevalence, as showed by Rotenstein et al. in a systematic review [3]. Differences in study
designs, burnout deﬁnition, and assessment methods were also found. This information
highlights the impossibility of obtaining clear ﬁgures on the prevalence of burnout and

emphasizes the importance of reaching an agreement on the deﬁnition of burnout and the
standardization of measurement tools to assess the effects of chronic occupational stress on
physicians [3].

It is mainly described in front-line medical specialties, cardiologists [4], emergency
physicians [5,6], or physicians working in intensive care units [7,8]. More than one-third of
primary care practitioners stated that they felt exhausted [9–12].

Social insurance physicians or medical advisers are physicians specialized in social
security, which assess the eligibility for work disability pension and other social insurance
rights [13,14]. Their activity involves mainly “in person” evaluations and requires good
quality evaluation, attention to claimants’ satisfaction, but also fair examination reported
to the administrative institutions and state budget.

Dealing with pressure from both sides, insurers and clients, and the need for an
accurate evaluation, given that decisions turn into public money expenses, may trigger
burnout among social insurance physicians. This results in long-term health problems and
decreased performance.

Physician burnout is linked with low job satisfaction and may have negative conse-
quences also to the healthcare system as a whole. Career dissatisfaction in physicians is
linked with leaving medicine, thus, contributing to workforce shortages [4]. The loss of
physicians through career dropout, reduced work, or early retirement [15] is a phenomenon
also occurring among SIPhs. This disrupts workﬂows and reduces efﬁciency, which is
detrimental to the good functioning of medical assessment services.

In European social security organizations, several countries have reported shortages
of social insurance physicians [16], and Romania is no exception. According to the national
records, around 30% of SIPhs have left the national network or reduced their activity in the
last 15 years.

With a signiﬁcant number of physicians leaving the system, the amount of work has
been transferred and increased for those who remain until a viable long-term solution
is found, including attracting other specialists into the system. Several hypotheses have
been discussed for this lack. Like their European colleagues, Romanian SIPhs frequently
reported organizational problems and computer system deﬁciencies. Other aspects were
also considered besides the increased demand for medical evaluations: a greater focus on
professional reintegration; case assessments became increasingly demanding and time-
consuming due to the shift to more complex or migrant cases [17].

The medical assessments for short-term (sickness) and long-term (disability) beneﬁts
have traditionally been undertaken by social insurance physicians [18]. Other tasks were
also described and these vary considerably between countries. In Romania, SIPhs also
coordinate the return to work program, and some participate in appeals commissions [14].
From a different perspective, effective handling of stress improves quality of work life
(QWL) important factor which is tied to satisfaction at the workplace and better results.
According to different authors, the quality of work life is divided into the work environ-
ment, work conditions, organizational and interpersonal relationships, occupational stress,
possibilities of professional development, wages, and social support [19].

Job satisfaction was found as a negative predictor of each type of burnout subscale
by some authors, while the conﬂict was a factor contributing positively both to emotional
exhaustion and depersonalization scores [20].

Good QWL increases the level of employee retention. The result is for the beneﬁt of

both the employees and the institution’s long-term viability [21].

The most widely used measure of burnout is the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which
has high reliability and validity [22]. As shown by Rotenstein et al. in a systematic review,
85.7% of studies used a version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess burnout [3].
However, there are different versions of this scale. MBI-HSS was designed to assess the
intensity of perceived burnout among professionals active in human services. The MBI-
HSS assesses all three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion (feeling emotionally
overextended by work), depersonalization (an unfeeling and impersonal response to

Medicina 2023, 59, 436

3 of 14

people), and personal accomplishment (feelings of incompetence and lack of achievement
at work) [2]. The MBI-HSS is translated, validated [23], and widely used [24] in Romania in
different studies, and some researchers made individual analyses of its items [25] or used
adapted MBI-HSS [26,27].

Coping strategies play an important role in the process of adapting to challenging
conditions. Coping is deﬁned as dealing with stressful factors and events and the reactions
of individuals in an attempt to overcome these situations [28]. Appropriate coping strate-
gies may increase individual resistance and protect from developing mental disorders [29].
Conversely, an inappropriate way to deal with high-level stress is for employees to psycho-
logically withdraw from others, leading to dehumanized and depersonalized contact. This
dysfunctional coping strategy will lead to further deterioration of the relationship with
others [30,31]. Each person may act differently depending on various factors such as age,
gender, cultural background, or personality traits [32].

COPE questionnaire (Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences Scale) was de-
signed to measure the different coping strategies people use in response to stress. COPE
is a self-reporting scale consisting of 60 questions and 15 subscales. Each subscale con-
tains four questions and provides information on separate coping skills. In conclusion,
the scores obtained in different subscales allow interpretation of which coping strategy is
predominantly used by the individuals. The subscales measure problem-based methods
(including planning, use of instrumental social support, active coping, restraint, suppres-
sion of competing activities), emotion-based methods (including use of emotional, social
support, positive reinterpretation and growth, religious coping, humor, and acceptance) or
non-functional coping strategies (venting of emotions, denial, behavioral disengagement,
mental disengagement, and substance use) [33].

2. Objective

The main objective of this study was to assess the degree of vulnerability to developing
burnout syndrome, factors associated with stress, and coping strategies of social insurance
physicians. To our knowledge, no other study has investigated burnout in this particular
category of healthcare professionals.

In this paper, the following research questions were addressed: What is the prevalence
of different components of burnout? Which are predictive factors for burnout? Which are
burnout side-effects? Which are the stress factors? Which are the coping strategies used for
stress control?

3. Methods

An observational study was performed to describe the extent of the exhaustion syn-
drome among social insurance physicians. This type of study was considered the most
appropriate considering the low cost and possibility of analyzing a well-deﬁned population
in a relatively short period of time. Questionnaires were sent by email to eliminate the
respondents’ reluctance to be evaluated by the research team. We took into consideration
also other advantages: fast sending of questionnaires, the integrity of data obtained, ﬂexi-
bility, and low costs because it does not require printing, multiplication, or travel expenses
for the operator.

We aimed to obtain the most accurate answers, so through an information letter, it
was explained to the participants that the study was conducted for research purposes.
The medical staff were assured of their privacy being respected, and responses were
analyzed anonymously.

Some sociodemographic data were collected: age, gender, marital status, children,
and length of service duration. The participants also reported on: vacations, sick leave,
psycho-traumatic events, daily commutes, or workload. We considered psycho-trauma
a stressful, disruptive event such as the death of a close relative, divorce, change of city
residence, job change, or major workplace conﬂict.

Medicina 2023, 59, 436

The shortened version of the scale MBI-HSS translated into Romanian was used to
analyze burnout syndrome components [34]. Two items were excluded from the original
scale, 12 (“I feel very energetic”) and 16 (“Working directly with people puts too much
stress on me”), as recommended by several authors to obtain a more valid tool [35–39].

This 20-item scale consists of 8 items for nervous exhaustion, 5 items for depersonal-
ization, and 7 items for personal accomplishment. Burnout is identiﬁed by high scores at
nervous exhaustion and depersonalization and low scores at personal accomplishment.
The answers are based on the frequency the subject experiences the respective feelings,
from a range from 0 (never) to 6 (every day). The scores obtained for each dimension are
then classiﬁed into three categories: low, moderate, and high.

Coping mechanisms were analyzed using a 28-item Brief-COPE with questions trans-
lated into Romanian [40]. Brief COPE is considered an efﬁcient tool to evaluate various
coping strategies, having adequate psychometric properties. Different ways of coping with
stress are addressed, and all the items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1—usually, I
do not do this at all to 4—usually, I do this a lot. This instrument was subsequently analyzed
in detail. First, 14 subscales were used, composed of two items each: active coping, plan-
ning, suppression of competing activities, restraint from action, seeking instrumental social
support, seeking emotional, social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial,
emotional discharge, religious coping, mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement,
and substance abuse.

Further, following Carver’s approach, we grouped three different categories as problem-
based methods (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint from
action, seeking instrumental social support), emotion-based methods (seeking emotional,
social support, positive reinterpretation, religious coping, acceptance) and non-functional
coping strategies (denial, emotional discharge, mental disengagement, behavioral disen-
gagement, and substance abuse) [33].

The study was carried out with the aim of characterizing this population group
and testing the possible response rate by reducing the number of questions and offer-
ing anonymity.

Following a comprehensive evaluation and validation by statistical analysis, we pro-
posed a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate stressors and coping strategies for social
insurance physicians, with the following items: sociodemographic data, short MBI-HSS,
brief COPE, and a set of questions focused on the potential inducing factors for burnout.
Thus, a complex assessment tool was obtained, easy to apply, and with reduced costs.

4. Statistical Analysis

All parameters were compared between the group with and without burnout syn-
drome by chi-square test for nominal and categorical variables (gender, marital status,
children, psycho-traumatic events, daily commute or workload) or by independent-sample
t-test for numerical variables (e.g., age, length of service duration, number of days of vaca-
tion, number of days of sick leave). Multiple logistic regression was used to obtain odds
ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals for each variable to be assessed as a potential predictor
for burnout syndrome. The type of association of different parameters with the presence
of burnout components was studied by correlation analysis. All statistical analyses were
performed by PSPP software.

5. Ethical Statement

The study was approved by the Scientiﬁc Research Ethics Committee of the Carol
Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest. This study complied with the
World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Participation in this survey was
regarded as agreeing to the study, and all data were de-identiﬁed.

6. Results
Participants

Seventy-four social insurance physicians working in territorial services for medical
assessment of work capacity from all over the country voluntarily participated in the study.
The 49% survey response rate was considered satisfactory for the results to be representative
of this professional category.

i. Prevalence

Females were 56 (75.7%) of the responders. The average age of participants was
48.86 years old. Of the responders, 81.08% were in a couple, and 78.38% had children. All
participants were working in territorial medical services of the National House of Pensions
with an average length of service of 17.09 years, and 35.14% reported having a second job.
Twenty-four participants used sick leave in the last year with a mean duration of 5.95 days,
and 72 participants took vacations for an average of 18.43 days.

Twenty-six respondents experienced at least one psycho-traumatic event in the past
year. About one-third of participants do not work in their place of residence, and three-
quarters reported having high or excessive workloads. The sociodemographic and profes-
sional characteristics of participants are summarized in Table 1.

Of the 74 respondents, 28 respondents (38%) suffered from moderate or high burnout.

The average scores for this population were 18.64(± 4.75) vs. 6.43 (± 4.67); p < 0.001.

ii. Socio-demographic risk factors for burnout

We investigated the relationship between burnout and different factors (age, gender,
marital status, children, length of service, workload, daily commute, second job, psychodra-
matic events, sick leave, and days off).

Persons with burnout had a signiﬁcantly lower number of days off (15.07 ± 7.91
vs. 20.48 ± 8.22 days; p = 0.007). Of 14 singles, 10 (71.43%) had burnout (p = 0.005).
Of 48 persons without psycho-traumatic events, 34 (70.83%) did not develop burnout
syndrome (p = 0.033). Correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between the
number of days off and the degree of burnout syndrome in the sense that if the number
of days off decreases, the degree of nervous exhaustion increases (r = −0.31, p = 0.007),
the same for being in a relationship (r = −0.33, p = 0.004) and a positive correlation
between psycho-traumatic experiences and the degree of burnout syndrome in the sense
that psycho-traumatic experiences worsen the degree of nervous exhaustion (r = 0.24,

Medicina 2023, 59, 436

p = 0.037). Therefore, being single, having experienced psychotraumas, and having fewer
vacations appear as contributing factors to developing burnout syndrome (Table 2).

These variables were also demonstrated by multivariate logistic regression (Table 3).
Several variables were signiﬁcantly associated with burnout syndrome: being single
(p = 0.036), psycho-traumatic experiences (p = 0.041), and a lower number of days off
(p = 0.023).

The backward selection type of multiple logistic regression revealed that only 3 out of
11 socio-demographic variables taken into account could be considered predictive factors
for burnout. In conclusion, the participants more vulnerable to burnout seemed to be single
with psychological trauma and who took less time off.

iii. Burnout side-effects

Participants with burnout experienced hostility (p = 0.010), professional routine
(p < 0.001), lack of career development (p < 0.001), inefﬁciency (p < 0.001), reduced or-
ganization (p < 0.001), altered family relationships (p = 0.016), cognitive distortions with
depression (p = 0.002) and poor performance at work (p < 0.001). The burnout indices are
presented in Table 4.

B. Depersonalization or professional detachment was analyzed as part of the ques-
tionnaire. It refers to the adoption of negative and indifferent attitudes toward
others. A higher rate of average and high depersonalization (35%) was found
(Table 5).

A positive correlation was obtained between depersonalization and gender and having
children, and a negative one was found for daily commute. This means that being a man
and having children predispose to depersonalization; instead, the daily commute was
found to favor the absence of depersonalization (Table 6).

The backward selection type of multiple logistic regression retained only two of these
variables to be taken into account as predictive factors for depersonalization. As a result,
having children seems to make persons more vulnerable to depersonalization, probably by
focusing on their own family wellness, while daily commute appears as a protective factor
(Table 7).

It was also analyzed as part of the short version of MBI-HSS. All participants had low

personal accomplishment with a mean of 11.62 (±6.13).

Stage 2. Personal and professional risk factors for burnout syndrome that emerged from

the interview

During the interview, the stressful situations that may contribute to the onset of
burnout were investigated. Professional factors (taking on additional tasks, deadline
pressure, high workload, low efﬁciency), as well as personal factors (extended family,
personal surroundings), have been identiﬁed as potential inducing factors for burnout.
(Table 8).

The backward selection type of multiple logistic regression highlighted that only
two of the six factors taken into account were ascertained as the strongest contributing
factors for burnout. In conclusion, professional factors, mainly deadline pressure and high
workload, might have a greater potential to induce burnout than personal ones (Table 9).

Stage 3. Stress control using Brief-COPE

We investigated possible strategies adopted by the participants to manage stress
effectively. Planning, active coping, emotional and social support, acceptance, mental
disengagement, and emotional discharge were found to improve stress control. Stress
control strategies are presented in Table 10.

Using the backward selection type of multiple logistic regression, mental disengage-
ment through other activities (p = 0.023), active coping by taking action (p = 0.041), and
accepting the reality (p = 0.001) has emerged as the most effective attitudes for dealing with
burnout (Table 11).

The gender analysis of coping mechanisms found that men preferred problem-based
methods, while for women, even if this type was also dominant, they made use of a high

Physicians constantly suffer from distress due to burnout, which may affect their
daily activity and performance [41]. This study examined markers of social insurance
physicians’ well-being. We found that in 38% of cases, there were average and high levels
of nervous exhaustion; in 35%, there were average and high levels of depersonalization,
and all respondents had low personal accomplishment.

When comparing with similar studies using MBI-HSS, it is important to highlight the
variability that exists around prevalence rates, how burnout measurement cut-off points are
utilized, and how total scores and subscale results are reported [22]. In a systematic review
made by Rotenstein et al., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal
accomplishment prevalence ranged from 0% to 86.2%, 0% to 89.9%, and 0% to 87.1%,
respectively [3].

When looking separately at the three dimensions of burnout, low personal accom-
plishment was found surprisingly in all participants. Other researchers also have found
high rates (from 49% to 66.9%) of low personal accomplishment among non-therapeutic
medical specialties (e.g., radiologists or occupational physicians), and it was associated
with low job satisfaction [42,43].

Social insurance physicians like radiologists or occupational physicians do not beneﬁt
from positive feedback from patients; on the contrary, the feedback from clients is often
negative when the evaluation shows that the applicant cannot beneﬁt from a social insur-
ance right. While doing their job, social insurance physicians have to deal with clients’
requests, sometimes insufﬁcient data, or the permanent requirement to make a decision by
a set deadline.

Like occupational physicians, social insurance physicians are frequently undervalued
among other specialists and do not have well-established communication procedures

with colleagues from other specialties or administrative staff. It was appreciated that
these characteristics might be detrimental to their self-esteem. As pointed out by other
researchers, the threat to identity and to self-esteem is the key to burnout syndrome in
some medical specialties [43].

In our study, those unmarried who experienced psychotraumas or took fewer va-
cations were prone to develop burnout syndrome. Speciﬁc risk factors were associated
with burnout in the literature: gender (female), marital status (single), age (older), or job
demands (excessive) [44–46]. Older age [22,42] and being single [42] were reported as
independent risk factors for high emotional exhaustion scores also by other researchers.

Depressive symptoms have positively correlated with burnout (r = 0.38; p = 0.001).
Different studies showed an increased risk of depression for physicians compared to
the general population. Occupational stress was associated with depression; besides
personality factors, work-related factors were relevant [47].

Panagioti et al. reported difﬁculties in balancing work and personal life as an important
factor contributing to burnout in physicians. Prioritizing work over personal time has been
associated with burnout in physicians, especially women. This can lead to difﬁculties in
maintaining personal relationships and enjoying a fulﬁlling private life [4].

When subjects were asked about adverse situations, professional rather than personal
factors were incriminated as possible inducers of burnout. There is pressure for social
insurance physicians to see more patients in shorter visits and to work a long time. In
addition to seeing patients, they have to take on administrative duties and deal with
increased computerization of their activities (registration of medical ﬁles and issues of
various documents on the computer). These tasks signiﬁcantly burden social security
physicians in terms of energy demands and time management. Like other professionals,
social insurance physicians need to continually update their medical knowledge and
changes in social insurance legislation. The excessive workload was described as making
the greatest contribution to overall job stress in other papers [4,42,48,49].

Physician’s burnout is particularly dangerous and should be avoided since it can
increase medical errors and reduce the quality of care for patients [29]. Maintaining health
and safety in the workplace is an important occupational health issue, and, in this regard,
early evaluation of risk factors for burnout allows one to take preventive measures [50].

Interventions for burnout can be classiﬁed into two main categories, physician-directed
interventions targeting individuals and organization-directed interventions targeting the
working environment. Overall, physician-level interventions have been more frequently
evaluated compared to organization-directed interventions. The most likely reason is that
burnout was primarily viewed as a personal problem of physicians; only recently, a shift
has been endeavored to view burnout as a problem of the health care organization driven
by workplace factors. Two meta-analyses have suggested that both physician-directed and
organization-directed interventions are effective for reducing burnout in physicians, but
organization-level interventions are associated with greater improvements [51].

Physician well-being must be seen as the shared responsibility of healthcare systems
and individuals. The system contribution should involve ﬁrm reforms such as the reduction
of administrative tasks for physicians and increases in non-physician support staff. On the
other hand, social insurance physicians should be aware of the importance of life-work
balance and help-seeking for mental health problems.

Modifying changeable risk factors (mainly professional factors such as deadline pres-
sure and high workload) and promoting professional help would ensure strong mental
health for professionals. These aspects should also be taken into account by the managers
of the institutions, knowing that good quality of work life increases engagement, efﬁciency,
and results of social insurance physicians, thus, contributing as important players to a
well-functioning social security system.

The gender analysis of coping mechanisms found that men preferred planning and
active coping, while for women, even if the same mechanisms were dominant, their
preferences were spread across several types. Our ﬁndings are consistent with other

Medicina 2023, 59, 436

11 of 14

existing studies on coping and stress among physicians. Popa-Velea et al. found that
women made use more than men of social support (be it emotional or instrumental),
positive reframing, planning, and religious coping. Virtually, all of these variables had
a buffering effect against stress, suggesting that females may beneﬁt from a wider array
of tools to ﬁght or prevent burnout compared to men [49]. However, data about gender
differences are divided. Some studies reported differences between men and women in
coping strategies, while no signiﬁcant differences between age or gender subgroups and
coping mechanisms were reported by others [52].

Other studies investigated coping strategies using a brief-COPE questionnaire among
physicians [52–54]. Attitudes adopted to cope with stress are very diverse, and many
factors should be considered. Gender, age, personality traits, religion, geographic region of
origin, or cultural speciﬁcity were cited [55].

There were described relationships between culturally learned values, beliefs, attitudes,
and consecutive behavioral patterns. This concept refers to the fact that individuals operate
and behave accordingly to traditionally dictated attitudes and beliefs about how life should
be lived, including the manner in which one copes with life’s problems [44]. Cultural
norms and family characteristics inﬂuence their ability to function. Traditional large
families of certain ethnic communities facilitate seeking social support from extended
family members [44], while in societies strongly inﬂuenced by religion, this becomes the
most frequently used stress-coping strategy [43]. Active coping, planning, and acceptance
were reported as the principal coping strategies in other studies [52,54].

From all ways of dealing with burnout, one draws particular attention in our study: the
use of instrumental support from the larger category of problem-focused methods as this
includes seeking medical care. The majority of persons with moderate nervous exhaustion did
not try to get advice from a mental health professional. Only persons with severe form have
made this step; three-quarters of women and all men did not seek professional advice. These
findings might be linked to the widespread traditional social attitude of avoiding asking for
specialized advice and handling the situation alone. Moreover, in Romanian society, there still
is a strong current of the traditional, authoritarian-patriarchal family/traditional educational
values, where the father/man is the master of the house, making the final decisions, naturally
endowed with physical and intellectual strength and resistance.

Most probably, avoiding seeking treatment is due to concerns about social stigma and
discrimination, but the lack of information from reliable sources often leads to less effective
coping mechanisms.

Other studies reported low percentages of physicians getting professional help as a
helpful coping way to make them feel less stressed. Key reasons for avoiding professional
care, especially psychological ones among physicians, were cited: the belief they could
manage independently, time, conﬁdentiality, license issues, and embarrassment [46,54].

These ﬁndings are expected to draw attention to the importance of psychological
support for SIPhs and their early referral to specialized services when the ﬁrst signs of
nervous overload are detected.

The current research represents an important step in a strategic approach to dealing
with burnout in the case of social insurance physicians. The ability to identify developing
problems early on, before they become more serious, can enable timely, preventive solu-
tions. It points to the possibility of being able to customize interventions to this speciﬁc
category. The potential power of this approach rests on the fact that it can function like an
organizational “checkup” with repeated assessments on a regular basis.

Future management and health policy improvements are expected, and managers of
the institutions and occupational physicians should be sensitized and pay more attention
to these aspects.

8. Study Limitations

The low number of subjects, self-selection of the respondents, and the risk of conformist
attitude limit the analysis. Moreover, questionnaires filled out by email generate both

Medicina 2023, 59, 436

12 of 14

benefits (comfort for the respondent, reduced influence of the interview operator) and
disadvantages (lower response rate, lack of representativeness caused by respondents’ self-
selection). Additionally, no personality traits were analyzed, with a relevant variable missing.
This study is a cross-sectional survey, and despite assessing associations between outcomes
and different variables, it does not allow to support the causal relationship between them.
Predictive factors found in this study and the effects of changes over time need to be assessed
in future research. Considering that personality plays an important causal role in burnout
development, individual characteristics should be considered in the future. Moreover,
external validation of a larger sample of physicians would add value to the results.

9. Conclusions

An important percentage of SIPhs are suffering from work-related burnout. Burnout
was reported not only as a stress-induced syndrome but as a low self-esteem-induced
syndrome, too.

Identifying predictive factors allow for a personalized and evidence-based approach
to disease prevention. Raising awareness of the disease triggers makes early intervention
possible and improves management effectiveness.

It is expected that promoting social insurance physicians’ role in the social security
system and value their knowledge, responsibilities, and actions to strengthen their position
in relation to public ofﬁcials and other medical specialties.

Modifying changeable mainly professional risk factors and promoting professional
help would bring beneﬁts to health professionals. Good quality of work life increases
engagement, efﬁciency, and results.
