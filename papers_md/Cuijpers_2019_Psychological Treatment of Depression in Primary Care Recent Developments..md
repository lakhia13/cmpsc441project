Abstract
Purpose of Review We give an overview of recent developments on psychological treatments of depression in primary care.
Recent Findings In recent years, it has become clear that psychotherapies can effectively be delivered through e-health applica-
tions. Furthermore, several studies in low and middle income countries have shown that lay health counselors can effectively
deliver psychological therapies. Behavioral activation, a relatively simple form of therapy, has been found to be as effective as
cognitive behavior therapy. Treatment of subthreshold depression has been found to not only reduce depressive symptoms but
also prevent the onset of major depression. In addition, therapies are effective in older adults, patients with general medical
disorders and in perinatal depression.
Summary Psychological therapies are effective in the treatment of depression in primary care, have longer lasting effects than
drugs, are preferred by the majority of patients, and can be applied flexibly with different formats and across different target
groups.

Introduction

Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, disabling, and cost-
ly disorders that are linked with considerably diminished role
functioning and quality of life, medical comorbidity, and mor-
tality [1–4]. In the past decades, considerable progress has
been made in the research and development of treatments of

depression in several settings, including primary care. Many
different types of antidepressant medication and psychothera-
py are now available that have shown to be effective in mul-
tiple randomized trials [5(cid:129)(cid:129), 6]. Based on these significant and
positive effects, many of these treatments are included in treat-
ment guidelines and are widely used across clinical practice.
The majority of depressed patients are treated in primary
care and only a small proportion of these are referred to mental
health services [7, 8]. Despite the hundreds of randomized
trials on drugs and therapy, only a limited number of these
trials on drugs and therapy have focused on primary care
patients. The results found for treatments in specialized mental
health care may, however, not be valid in depressed primary
care patients, also because depression is assumed to be less
severe in primary care patients [9].

Although both antidepressant medication and psychother-
apies have small, but positive effects on depression, with no
clinically relevant differences at the short-term, many general
practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe antidepressant medica-
tions to depressed patients [10]. The majority of patients, how-
ever, prefer psychological treatments [11, 12, 13(cid:129)]. In a sys-
tematic review of 34 studies among different settings, it was
found that on average 75% of patients with mental disorders

129 Page 2 of 10

preferred psychotherapy over drug treatment, especially in
younger patients [12], although there are indications that this
may be related to severity of depression with more severe
patients more often preferring drugs [14].

In this paper, we will give an overview of the available
psychological treatments that have been tested in randomized
trials in primary care patients. We will also examine the rela-
tive effects of therapies, antidepressants, and their combina-
tion. We will summarize what is known about how these ther-
apies can be delivered (individually, in groups, by telephone,
through the internet) and who can deliver them. Then we will
focus on new developments in the field, including the use of
therapies that are delivered through new technologies, the in-
creasing number of trials on psychotherapy in primary settings
in low and middle income countries (LMICs), the recent evi-
dence that simple forms of therapy are as effective as more
complicated forms, that treating subthreshold depression can
have important preventive effects, and that there is increasing
knowledge about the treatment of specific target groups, such
as older adults, women with postpartum depression, comorbid
substance use, and comorbid general medical disorders.

many cases suboptimal and publication bias is a major
problem [39]. After adjustment for these problems, the
effect sizes (Cohen’s d) are between 0.3 and 0.4, which
corresponds with a numbers-needed-to-be-treated (NNT)
between 8 and 11 [40].

There is no evidence that the effects of different types of
therapy significantly differ from each other. Trials directly
comparing different types of therapy [41], as well as network
meta-analyses [6], suggest that all major types of therapy have
comparable effects. There is one meta-analysis examining dif-
ferential effects of psychotherapies conducted in primary care
[42], which supports this finding of no major differences be-
tween therapies, although the number of studies was limited
and some difference was found between IPT and internet-
based CBT, but that was based on a small number of studies
and mostly indirect evidence.

Psychotherapies in primary care can be delivered by GPs
themselves, by trained nurses, by social workers, or clinical
psychologists. There is hardly any research examining wheth-
er who delivers the treatment is related to the effects that are
found for therapies.

Psychotherapy for Depression

Drugs or Therapy?

In the past decades, several different types of psychotherapy
for depression have been developed and tested in primary
care. Psychotherapy can be defined as “the informed and in-
tentional application of clinical methods and interpersonal
stances derived from established psychological principles for
the purpose of assisting people to modify their behaviors,
cognitions, emotions, and/or other personal characteristics in
directions that the participants deem desirable” [15].

The types of therapy that have been examined best in pri-
mary care settings are cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), be-
havioral activation therapy (BAT), interpersonal psychothera-
py (IPT), problem-solving therapy, and non-directive counsel-
ing. In Table 1, definitions of each of these therapies are given,
as well as some major sources of evidence for their effective-
ness. There are many other types of therapy, which are some-
times used in mental health care but have not extensively been
tested in primary care settings. Examples include brief psy-
chodynamic therapies, life review therapy, and mindfulness-
based CBT. In Table 2, the main meta-analyses of trials on
psychotherapies in primary care patients have been
summarized.

There is a considerable body of evidence that psycho-
therapies are effective in the treatment of depression. In
randomized trials, therapies are usually compared with
care-as-usual, waiting list, pill placebo, or other control
conditions. Compared with these control conditions, the
effects are moderate to large (Cohen’s d ranging from 0.6
to 0.9) [19]. However, the quality of these trials is in

Apart from psychotherapies, drugs have also been found to be
effective in the treatment of depression in large-scale meta-
analyses of randomized trials across settings [5(cid:129)(cid:129)]. One meta-
analysis of 17 trials of antidepressants in primary care patients
found a modest, but significant effect of drugs on response
compared with placebo [43(cid:129)(cid:129)]. However, most of these trials
were in patients with moderate to severe depression, while the
majority of patients are in the mild to moderate range.
Therefore, these findings have to be considered with caution.
In addition, a large recent trial in primary care patients with
moderate depression could not confirm that sertraline was
more effective than placebo [44].

At the short term, the effects of psychotherapies across all
settings are comparable with those of antidepressants [45(cid:129)(cid:129),
46, 47]. Direct comparisons between antidepressants and ther-
apies result in small, non-significant differences [46–48], also
when blinding is taken into account (when a placebo condition
is included) [48], as well as sponsorship bias [49]. However, at
the longer term (up to 1 year), there are indications that psy-
chotherapy is more effective than medication [50], especially
when during follow-up, the patients stop taking the medica-
tion [51]. When the patient continues to take medication dur-
ing follow-up, the effects are comparable with those of CBT
without continuation treatment during follow-up.

Combined treatment is more effective than either psycho-
therapy or pharmacotherapy alone [47], but this has been ex-
amined mostly in moderate to severe depression and it is not
clear whether this is also true for milder forms of depression.

therapy (CBT)

− The best examined type of psychotherapy that is currently

available, also in primary care.

− Although it is the best studied type of therapy, there is no
evidence that it is more effective than other therapies.
− The therapist focuses on the impact a patient’s present

dysfunctional thoughts have on current behavior and future
functioning.

− CBT is aimed at evaluating, challenging, and modifying a
patient’s dysfunctional beliefs (cognitive restructuring).

− Therapists exert an active influence over therapeutic

interactions and topics of discussion, use a
psycho-educational approach, and teach patients new ways
of coping with stressful situations.

− BAT is often combined with CBT but can also be offered as a

separate treatment [19].

− The patient registers pleasant routine and essential activities.
− The patient is stimulated to increase positive interactions with

his or her environment.

− The delivery of BAT is less complicated than CBT.
− Social skills training can also be a part of the intervention.
− A highly structured manual-based psychotherapy that

addresses interpersonal issues in depression to the exclusion
of all other foci of clinical attention [20, 21(cid:129)(cid:129), 22].

− In secondary care, usually the full version of 16 sessions is

used, but there is also a brief version interpersonal
counseling (IPC) that was developed for primary care [23].
− IPT has no specific theoretical origin although its theoretical
basis can be seen as coming from the work of Sullivan,
Meyer, and Bowlby.

− The current form of the treatment was developed by the late
Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman in the 1980s [22].

− In PST, patients learn how to systematically solve their

problems in a number of steps.

− First, the problems are defined, then as many solutions as

possible are generated, the best one is chosen, a plan is made
to actually do it, the plan is executed and finally evaluated
whether the problem is solved. If not, the patient should go
back to the first step.

− PST was originally developed as a 12-session intervention
which was aimed at problem-solving and also on changing
attitudes and beliefs that inhibit effective problem-solving
[24, 25].

− However, in the 1990s, a brief 6-session version of PST was

developed specifically for primary care [26, 27].

− Counseling is an unstructured therapy without specific

psychological techniques other than those common to all
approaches, such as helping people to ventilate their
experiences and emotions and offering empathy [19, 28].

− It is not aimed at solutions or acquiring new skills.
− The assumption is that relief from personal problems may be

achieved through discussion with others.

− Often described in the literature as either counseling or

(non-directive) supportive therapy.

− Counseling is examined in primary care in several studies.

Other types of therapy There are many other types of therapy that have been tested in

other settings, but not extensively in primary care:

− Psychodynamic therapies are based on the

psycho-analytic framework and try to help patients
through resolve depression through enhancing the
patient’s understanding, awareness, and insight about
repetitive conflicts [29].

− Several meta-analyses of several dozens of trials have
shown that CBT is effective in primary care [16–18].
− Meta-analyses of trials across setting have included more
than 200 comparisons between CBT and control groups,
overall indicating comparable effects as in primary care
[19].

− No meta-analysis of trials of BAT in primary care has been

conducted.

− Meta-analyses of BAT across settings have included several
dozens of trials, resulting in comparable effects as other
therapies [19, 20].

− A large non-inferiority trial found that BAT delivered by

nurses is non-inferior to CBT delivered by therapists [21(cid:129)(cid:129)].
− No meta-analysis of trials of IPT in primary care has been

conducted.

− Meta-analyses of IPT across settings have included several
dozens of trials, resulting in comparable effects as other
therapies [19, 23].

− A meta-analysis of 11 trials of PST in primary care found

comparable effects as other therapies [25].

− A meta-analysis across settings has included a few dozen of

trials [19].

− No meta-analysis of trials of counseling in primary care has

been conducted.

− Meta-analyses of counseling across settings have included
several dozens of trials, resulting in effects that may be
somewhat smaller than other therapies, but this is not clear
[19, 28].

− For the effects of 15 different therapies, see the recent

meta-analysis of Cuijpers et al. 2019 [19].

− Life review therapy is mainly used in older adults and is

aimed at resolving conflicts from the past and make up the
balance of one’s life [30, 31].

− Third wave therapies are a heterogeneous group of treatments

that introduce new techniques to CBT. They have in
common that they abandon or only cautiously use
content-oriented cognitive interventions and the use of skills
deficit models to delineate the core maintaining mechanisms
of the addressed disorders [32].

− Mindfulness-based CBT, in which CBT is combined with
mindfulness and meditation, is an important example.
Significant effects have been obtained with this therapy in
patients with diagnostic levels of depression [33], being a
treatment of choice for depression recurrence recommended
by NICE guidelines [34].

a The definitions given in this table are based on a broader meta-analysis of 15 evidence-based therapies for adult depression [20]

Acceptability has been found to be better for psychotherapy
and combined treatment compared with antidepressants alone.
Most of the meta-analyses in this field have examined these
issues across settings, and it has not been established whether
these findings are also true in primary care.

Technologically Delivered Therapies

One interesting development in the past years is the remote
delivery of psychotherapies through the internet and mobile
apps. It is becoming increasingly clear that the effects of these
interventions are comparable with those of face-to-face thera-
pies. In one recent meta-analysis of trials in which a face-to-
face therapy was compared with the same intervention that

was offered as an internet-based treatment, no significant dif-
ferences between these formats were found [52]. However, in
this meta-analysis, interventions for a broad range of mental
disorders were pooled together. In another recent meta-analy-
sis, aimed specifically at depression, the treatment format was
examined in more detail [53(cid:129)]. This was a network meta-
analysis of 155 studies on CBT for depression in which dif-
ferent kinds of treatment formats were compared with each
other and with different control conditions. No significant
differences were found between individual, group, tele-
phone-based, or guided self-help format [53(cid:129)]. In guided
self-help, the patient independently works through a standard-
ized protocol, with support from a professional therapist. The
protocol can be in book format or available on the internet,
and the support from the therapist can be delivered by

telephone, by email, or by chat [54]. This meta-analysis found
no difference in effects of these different formats (including
internet-based guided self-help). It was found, however, that
although the effects of guided self-help were comparable with
that of other treatment formats, the acceptability was signifi-
cantly lower. Acceptability was defined as drop-out from the
study for any reason. When applying guided self-help in pa-
tients, clinicians should be cautious for early drop-out in
patients.

Unguided internet-based self-help is also increasingly ex-
amined in randomized trials. These are also CBT-based inter-
ventions in which the protocol is delivered over the internet,
but in which no professional support is given and the patient
has to go through the intervention independently. In one large
“individual patient data” meta-analysis, with the primary data
of 3876 patients from 13 trials on unguided internet-based
self-help, it was found that the effects of these unguided inter-
ventions are smaller than those of guided self-help, but still
significant compared with care-as-usual and waiting list con-
trol groups [55]. In the network meta-analysis comparing dif-
ferent treatment formats of CBT, self-help without any profes-
sional support was more effective than waitlist controls, but
not more effective than care-as-usual. Self-help without pro-
fessional support may therefore be useful as alternative for
watchful waiting in mild depression, and may be effective in
some patients, but the effects are not as large as those of
internet-based guided self-help or face-to-face therapies
[53(cid:129),56].

Although most of this research has been done across dif-
ferent settings, there are also a growing number of randomized
trials in primary care. One recent meta-analysis of 8 random-
ized trials on computerized CBT in primary care confirmed
the general findings described above that guided self-help is
effective with small to moderate effects (g = 0.37), while un-
guided has little effect compared with control conditions (g =
0.04) [57]. This suggests that the findings across different
treatment settings are also valid in primary care settings.
General practitioners may, however, be less inclined to recom-
mend low intensity interventions for their patients [58].

LMICs

Another interesting development is that there is an increasing
number of studies in primary settings in low and middle in-
come countries (LMICS). Most research on psychotherapies
in general, including therapies in primary care settings, has
been conducted in high-income Western countries across
North America, Europe, and Australia. Depression, however,
is not only an important public health problem in these high-
income countries. Although 12-month prevalence rates differ
considerably across countries [59], these rates are overall very
comparable in high income countries (5.5%) and LMICs

(5.9%) countries [60, 61]. In China, for example, it is estimat-
ed that 54 million people suffer from depression, which is
more than the total population of Spain. Depression is there-
fore a worldwide public health problem, with very low rates of
access for people living in LMICs. Although the number of
depressed people seeking help in high-income countries is
also low (about 1 in 5), only one in 27 LMICs gets adequate
treatment [62, 63].

Because the financial and human resources to deliver treat-
ments for mental health problems in LMICs are typically not
available, most projects on psychotherapy use a task shifting
approach. Task shifting can be defined as “the rational redis-
tribution of tasks among health workforce teams” [64], and it
means that psychotherapies are delivered by trained non-spe-
cialist, lay health counselors, such as nurses or trained lay
persons. Usually therapies are also very brief, often with only
4 to 6 sessions. In recent years, several randomized trials in
primary care settings have been conducted using the approach,
examining behavioral activation treatment in India [65–67]
and Pakistan [68], problem-solving therapy through the
Friendship Bench in Zimbabwe [69(cid:129)(cid:129)], CBT in Pakistan
[70], and Problem Management Plus (which combines CBT,
BA, PST, anxiety management, and social support) in
Pakistan [71, 72] and Kenya [73]. These efforts build on ear-
lier work in which task shifting approaches were used in the
treatment of common mental disorders [74, 75]. It should be
noted, however, that not all trials in this field have found better
results when compared with usual care [76, 77].

Although no meta-analysis has yet integrated the results of
trials using task shifting approaches for depression in primary
care settings in LMICs, the individual studies described above
find positive results and suggest that this is an effective and
efficient strategy to implement psychotherapies in LMICs.

Behavioral Activation

The question whether all therapies for depression have com-
parable effects has been examined for several decades, and
several meta-analyses have shown that the effects of different
manualized therapies are indeed comparable [6, 41]. This
raises the question whether therapies can be simplified with-
out reduction of the effects. Both internet-based interventions
and task shifting interventions, in which lay health counselors
deliver therapies, can be seen as examples of this develop-
ment, because they use considerably less resources, but have
comparable effects as conventional individual therapies.

One other development in this area is research on behav-
ioral activation treatment in primary care. CBT is the domi-
nant type of treatment that has been recommended in most
guidelines as first line treatment of depression [34, 78, 79].
However, it is also rather complicated and requires patients to
be able to understand and observe their own thinking and

129 Page 6 of 10

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2019) 21: 129

change this. Behavioral activation is much more simple and
straightforward. It only requires patients to know which activ-
ities they find pleasurable and in theoretical terms result in “an
increase of positive interactions between a person and his or
her environment” [18, 80]. These pleasant activities should
then be integrated more into their daily life. Behavioral acti-
vation is included in most manuals for CBT, but as we saw
earlier, it can also be delivered as a separate treatment without
the cognitive restructuring.

The question whether CBT and behavioral activation have
comparable effects goes back to the 1970s [81], and has been
examined in several trials over the years [82, 83]. However, all
of these trials were heavily underpowered with far too few
participants to show small differential effects of either of the
two [84]. In 2016, however, a large, sufficiently powered non-
inferiority trial was published in which behavioral activation
delivered by junior mental health workers was compared with
CBT from licensed psychological therapists for depressed pri-
mary care patients [21(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Behavioral activation treatment was
found to be non-inferior to CBT. This means that it is no less
effective than CBT in primary care, but is much simpler and
easier for patients, and can be effectively delivered by thera-
pists that have less training than the CBT therapists.

Prevention

Depressive disorders that are treated in primary care are usu-
ally less severe than disorders treated in specialized mental
health care. Many of these disorders would not meet the
criteria for a major depressive disorder but can better be un-
derstood as subthreshold depression or minor depression.
These patients have clinically relevant depressive symptoms.
It has become increasingly clear that this group can benefit
from preventive psychological interventions aimed at reduc-
tion of symptoms and at preventing the onset of major
depression.

A recent large randomized trial in patients recruited from
the community showed that a preventive internet-based inter-
vention consisting of the combination of behavioral activation
and problem-solving can have significant effects in patients
with subthreshold depression [85(cid:129)]. After the intervention, the
level of depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the
treatment group compared with the enhanced care-as-usual
control group (Cohen’s d = 0.69). More importantly, however,
at 1-year follow-up, the number of patients who developed a
major depressive disorder was significantly lower in the treat-
ment group (27%) compared with the control group (41%),
with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.42~0.82; p = 0.002) and
a number-needed-to-be-treated of 5.9.

This finding is in line with previous studies showing that
brief psychological interventions in people with subthreshold
depression can prevent the onset of major depression at

follow-up. A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials in sub-
threshold depression found that the incidence rate was signif-
icantly reduced in those who received a preventive interven-
tion compared with those who did not [86]. The incidence rate
ratio was 0.74 (95% CI 0.61~0.90), which means that the
incidence of depressive disorders was 26% lower in the pre-
vention group compared with the control group. Several of
these studies were conducted in primary care [87–89].

This suggests that general practitioners can play an impor-
tant role in the prevention of major depression by referring
patients with subthreshold depression to brief psychological
preventive interventions or offering such interventions them-
selves. Another group of studies has focused on psychosocial
interventions focused on perinatal depression, suggesting that
preventive interventions may also be effective in this target
group [90(cid:129)].

Specific Target Groups

Most studies examining psychotherapies in primary care pa-
tients are aimed at patients in general. However, there are also
considerable numbers of studies examining psychotherapies
for depression in specific target groups, such as older adults,
patients with comorbid general medical disorders, such as
diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, women with perinatal de-
pression, and patients with comorbid substance use. In a large
meta-analysis of 256 trials with 332 comparisons between a
therapy and a control group, it was examined whether there
are differences between studies in such specific target groups
[91]. There was some risk of bias in more than 75% of the
studies, heterogeneity was considerable in most comparisons,
and the risk for an overestimate of the effect size because of
publication bias was high.

Although only thirty of these studies were conducted in
primary care, the studies in older adults and patients with
general medical disorders did not significantly differ from
studies in adults in general. For other target groups, the num-
ber of studies with low risk of bias was too small to draw any
definite conclusion, although a recent meta-analysis of 10 tri-
als in primary care on therapies in women with perinatal de-
pression found that psychotherapy was significantly more ef-
fective than care-as-usual and waiting list control groups
(Cohen’s d = − 0.38; 95% CI − 0.49 to − 0.27).

The effects of treatments for comorbid depression and sub-
stance use disorders are probably more modest. A meta-
analysis of 20 studies in these patients found a small but sig-
nificant effect of therapy on depression, but no significant
effect on substance use [92]. None of these studies were con-
ducted in primary care because these patients are usually treat-
ed in specialized mental health or substance use disorder
settings.

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2019) 21: 129

Therapies in depressed children and adolescents have also
been examined in a considerable number of studies [93], but
these studies are typically conducted among children recruited
from schools or who are treated in specialized mental health
care. The effect sizes found for therapies in children and ado-
lescents compared with control conditions are smaller than
those in adults, especially those in children below the age of
12, although the number of studies is small and the quality of
many of these studies is suboptimal [94]. It is important, how-
ever, that both the effects in children (Cohen’s d = 0.35) and
those in adolescents (d = 0.55) are still significant.

Conclusions

In this review, we saw that psychotherapies are effective in the
treatment of depression in primary care patients. The effects
are comparable with those of antidepressant medication in the
short term and probably more effective in the longer term.
Combined treatment is more effective than either psychother-
apy or pharmacotherapy alone. The majority of patients prefer
psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy and it is also more ac-
ceptable. In recent years, it has become clear that therapies can
effectively be delivered in different formats, including
internet-based formats. It can also be delivered through trained
lay health counselors, as has been shown in a growing number
of studies in LMICs. The type of therapy can also be simpli-
fied, as recent research comparing cognitive behavior therapy
and behavioral activation has shown. Another interesting re-
cent development is the use of psychological treatment as
prevention of major depression in people with subthreshold
depression. Finally, a considerable number of studies have
shown that psychotherapies can effectively be used as treat-
ment in older adults, patients with general medical disorders,
and in perinatal depression. The effects are probably smaller
in those with comorbid substance use problems, chronic de-
pression, and in children and adolescents.

Although psychotherapies are effective in the treatment of
depression, we have to remember that the effects are still
modest as are those of antidepressant medication. The major-
ity of patients improve during treatment, but a considerable
number of these would also have improved without treatment.
Improvement rates without treatment have been estimated to
be about a quarter after 3 months and 50% after 1 year [95].
And on the other side of the spectrum, there is a considerable
minority of about 30% of patients who do not respond to any
treatment [96, 97]. Furthermore, the quality of much of the
research on psychotherapies is suboptimal. So there is still a
lot of room for improvement, both in terms of quality of re-
search and in terms of treatments outcomes.

Despite these limitations, however, psychotherapy is effec-
tive and can be considered to be one of the main treatment
options for depression in primary care.
