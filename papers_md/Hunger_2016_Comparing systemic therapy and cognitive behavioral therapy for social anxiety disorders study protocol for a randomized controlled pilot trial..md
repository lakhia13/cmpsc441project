disorders: study protocol for a randomized
controlled pilot trial

Abstract

Background: Social anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent anxiety disorders in the general population.
The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorders is well demonstrated. However, only
three studies point to the efficacy of systemic therapy (ST) in anxiety disorders, and only two of them especially
focus on social anxiety disorders. These ST studies either do not use a good comparator but minimal supportive
therapy, they do not use a multi-person ST but a combined therapy, or they do not especially focus on social
anxiety disorders but mood and anxiety disorders in general. Though ST was approved as evidence based in
Germany for a variety of disorders in 2008, evidence did not include anxiety disorders. This is the first pilot study
that will investigate multi-person ST, integrating a broad range of systemic methods, specifically for social anxiety
disorders and that will compare ST to the "gold standard" CBT.

Design: This article describes the rationale and protocol of a prospective, open, interventive, balanced, bi-centric,
pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 32 patients with a primary SCID diagnosis of social anxiety
disorder will be randomized to either CBT or ST. Both treatments will be manualized.
The primary outcome will include social anxiety symptoms at the end of therapy. Therapy will be restricted to no
more than 26 hours (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes will include psychological, social systems and
interpersonal functioning, symptom adjustment, and caregiver burden, in addition to change measures, therapist
variables and treatment adherence. At the secondary endpoints, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of therapy,
we will again assess all outcomes.

Discussion: The study is expected to pilot test a RCT which will be the first to directly compare CBT and multi-
person ST, integrating a broad range of systemic methods, for social anxiety disorders, and it will provide empirical
evidence for the calculation of the number of patients needed for a confirmatory RCT.

Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02360033; date of registration: 21 January 2015.

Background
Both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and systemic
therapy (ST) have a long tradition in the psychothera-
peutic treatment of various disorders. However, CBT has
a much stronger history of manualization and evalu-
ation, especially for patients with anxiety disorders [1]. It
is also part of insurance-funded German psychotherapy,
which ST is not. ST was approved as evidence based in
Germany for a variety of disorders, but evidence did not
include anxiety disorders [2, 3]. Three randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) for anxiety disorders are available
[4–6]. However, they either do not especially focus on
social anxiety disorders but mood and anxiety disorders
in general [4], they do not use a multi-person ST but a
combined therapy [5], or they do not use a "gold stand-
ard" comparator but minimal supportive therapy (MST)
[6]. We therefore need more studies that investigate the
efficacy of ST specifically for social anxiety disorders,
and that use a multi-person ST compared to a well-
investigated comparator, such as CBT.

Epidemiology
Social anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent
anxiety disorders (prevalence of 7–16 %). In general,
women are affected more frequently (3:2) [7]. In clinical
populations, we find women and men in equal shares
[8]. Both women and men are affected by the many sig-
nificant psychosocial and occupational
limitations that
accompany social anxiety disorders [9]. Those affected
have lower income and education, higher unemploy-
ment, are more often unmarried and have fewer friends
[10]. The age of onset of social anxiety disorders aver-
ages 10–13 years [7]; spontaneous remission in the first
2 years is below 20 % [11, 12].

Clinical picture
Social anxiety disorders are interpersonal disorders.
Symptoms of fear such as shaking or flushing arise when
the affected person experiences that he or she may at-
tract attention, and that symptoms such as shaking or
flushing constrain his or her ability to build up social re-
lationships [13]. Socially anxious individuals display little
emotionality,
intimacy and secure bonding [14]. The
performance anxiety type describes, for example, fears
being seized with stage fright, behaving awkwardly if
aware of being scrutinized by others and/or getting flur-
ried in larger groups when speaking publicly or eating in
restaurants. The interpersonally anxiety type describes,
for example, fear of giving an impression of being a bore,
an odd fellow and/or difficult to get along with so that
the individual is the only one out of keeping with com-
pany in everyday situations in medium-sized groups, for
example, during lunch with work colleagues or at a gar-
den party with neighbors [15]. People with the specific

subtype fear to speak or to eat in public in some specific
social situations. Individuals with the generalized sub-
type fear such behavior in a greater number of situa-
tions. The generalized subtype shows stronger burden
caused by the generalized socially anxious symptomatol-
ogy and by more severe comorbidity [7].

Psychotherapy
CBT explains the disposition of social anxiety disorders
by cognitive schemas which stimulate misleading in-
ternal information processing. Socially anxious individ-
uals
show increased self-focused attention when
interacting with others stimulated by the assumption
that others can see their anxiety. Based on a linked re-
duction in observation of other people, they focus on
negative reactions and tend to interpret ambiguous and
neutral feedback in a negative way. This results in exces-
sively negative inferences about how they appear to
others. Incorrect cognitions induce avoidance of social
situations and/or the extensive use of safety behavior
(e.g. avoiding eye contact, speaking low). The intention
is on the prevention of feared catastrophes. However,
avoidance and safety behavior contributes to the main-
tenance of negative beliefs and the increase of feared
symptoms. They make patients come across to others in
ways that are likely to elicit less friendly responses [8,
16, 17].

CBT aims to reverse the maintaining processes speci-
fied in the cognitive model of Clark and Wells [17]. The
goal is to establish a realistic self-perception. The CBT
manual [8] differentiates between five phases which are
described in detail in the method section.

ST explains the development of social anxiety disor-
ders by reciprocal interpersonal interactions. Symptoms
of social anxiety serve the near-distance regulation when
interacting with others. They represent the (non-verbal)
communication of dyadic or multi-person “between-us”
quality of relationship in private (e.g.
family, couple,
friends) or professional (e.g. work colleagues, superior-
inferior) social systems. Social anxiety indicates that an
actual development task has not yet been accomplished
and that socially anxious behavior, feelings and thoughts
appear to be the best solution currently available. ST
thus interprets social anxiety as an individual’s sensitive
reaction when fearing being scrutinized and socially
rejected. However, maintaining social system structures
reciprocally maintains social anxiety [18, 19].

As we did not find a multi-person ST manual for
treating specifically social anxiety disorders, JS and CH
developed the first manualization of ST,
integrating a
broad range of systemic methods, for this type of dis-
order. We reviewed ST manuals for social anxiety disor-
ders in child and adolescent psychotherapy [19] and

Hunger et al. Trials  (2016) 17:171

treating patients,

well-established ST manuals for different disorders [20–22].
We used general ST concepts [18], integrating constructiv-
ist, solution-oriented [5, 23] and strategic [24–27] methods,
in addition to attending disorder-specific relational ST dy-
namics [19, 28, 29]. According to the literature and our ex-
periences of
the aim of ST is to
contextualize symptoms of social anxiety by addressing an
individual’s important private and/or professional social sys-
tem. Social anxiety disorders indicate the disturbance of an
entire social system and most if not all of its members. It
does not rely on one single individual only. Consequently,
the primary goal of ST is to identify and involve all import-
ant social system members. Thus, they will be invited to
therapy sessions in addition to the individual patient. If they
cannot attend physically, circular questions serve their in-
clusion into the room on a cognitive level. The analysis of
transgenerational relationships, of past and present inter-
personal interactions serve the development of a new un-
derstanding of the important roles, places and resources of
all system members.

The systemic model of Schweitzer and Hunger [30]
combines three different therapy settings with different
participants in a multisystemic therapy concept. The first
two therapies, and the majority of all therapy sessions
alike, are individual but with a strong focus on relationship
issues. They are combined with sessions with partners, par-
ents or closest friends, and with one 3-hour group therapy
session bringing together project patients and therapists.
The ST manual differentiates between four phases which
are described in detail in the method section.

Efficacy
The efficacy of CBT for social anxiety disorders is well
established [31]. A meta-analysis of 29 RCT studies
showed a general effect size of 0.70 [32]. The largest
German multicenter RCT investigating social anxiety
disorders is the Social Phobia Psychotherapy Network
(SOPHO-NET; n = 495) [18]. The SOPHO-NET was ini-
tiated by the lack of evidence for the efficacy of a new
psychotherapy method for social anxiety disorders. In
the SOPHO-NET, this was psychodynamic therapy (PD)
which was compared to CBT. Based on the Liebowitz
Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the authors investigated re-
mission (LSAS score ≤30) and response (LSAS score re-
duction of at least 31 %) demonstrably comparable to an
improvement of ≤2 in the Clinical Global Impression
(CGI) [33]. The authors expected superiority of CBT
with a small effect (Cohen’s h = 0.30; i.e. CBT response
rate of 70 %, PD response rate of 55 %) [34]. With
smaller effect than expected, results demonstrated su-
periority for remission (36 % CBT, 26 % PD; h = 0.22)
but not for response (60 % CBT, 52 % PD) [35]. Again
with small effect sizes, secondary interpersonal outcome

Problems (IIP) [36] also showed significant differences in
favor of CBT. At 6, 12 and 24 months after the end of
treatment, significant between-group differences were no
longer found in any outcome. Contrariwise, some other
studies found that CBT patients tend to continue with
problems in relationship formation after the end of ther-
apy [37, 38].

Considering ST, we found only three RCTs for anxiety
disorders [4–6], and only two of them investigated social
anxiety disorders. One RCT (n = 120, Poland) compared
10 weeks of brief strategic therapy (BST) with MST. The
outcome relied on the Interpersonal Sensitivity, Anxiety
and Global Severity Index of the Symptom Checklist-90-
R (SCL-90-R) [39, 40]. This trial demonstrated BST su-
periority for patients with social anxiety disorders only
(response: 50 % BST, 20 % MST) but no significance of
any treatment for patients with comorbid personality
disorders (response: 7 % BST and MST) [6]. The second
RCT (n = 83, Germany) compared a combined resource-
oriented cognitive-behavioral
therapy (ROCBT) with
CBT. The main outcomes were the Social Interaction
Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS).
SIAS and SPS are original German scales and were de-
veloped by the leading German CBT researcher for so-
cial anxiety disorders [41–43]. This trial demonstrated
ROCBT superiority (Cohen’s d = 1.29, for both SIAS and
SPS) compared to CBT (d = 0.86, for SIAS; d = 0.97, for
SPS). Therapy effects were stable over the 2- and 10-
year follow-up in both treatment conditions [5]. The
third RCT (n = 326, Finland) compared long- and short-
term PD with solution-focused ST. This study included
patients with both mood and anxiety disorders. Results
indicated a statistically significant reduction of symp-
toms on all outcomes in all three treatment groups dur-
ing the 3-year study period,
including the SCL-90-R
anxiety subscale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
(HAM-A). Both instruments measure anxiety but not
social anxiety [44]. The reduction was faster in short-
term psychotherapies, including the solution-focused ST
during the first year of follow-up. However, the reduc-
tion continued during the 3-year follow-up only for the
long-term PD [4].

social

anxiety disorders

Consequently, none of the above described ST RCTs
used the LSAS, though it is most often used for the
assessment of
[45]. The
SOPHO-NET used the LSAS as the main outcome for
that reason [35]. Willutzki and colleagues decided to
use the original German SIAS and SPS, which highly
correlate with the LSAS [5]. We therefore miss infor-
mation regarding the efficacy of multi-person ST on
established social anxiety assessments,
the
LSAS, SIAS and SPS. Additionally, we also miss infor-
mation regarding the efficacy of multi-person ST when
compared to a well-established comparator, the CBT.

are often complex,
Before a large RCT is undertaken, a pilot
study
should be conducted that mimics all the major essen-
tials of the planned larger study [46]. As this study is
the first trial that includes both a multi-person ST,
integrating a broad range of systemic methods, and
CBT, especially focusing on social anxiety disorders,
we will have to conduct this pilot RCT before plan-
ning in detail the future main trial. Due to the mis-
match of this study with previous investigations of ST
for social anxiety disorders, reliable information that
is needed for the sample size calculation for the main
RCT is missing. Thus, this pilot study will help us to
pay careful attention to sample size calculation, it will
aim to save costs and use patients efficiently in the
future RCT [47].

Hypotheses
The main focus of this paper is to answer the question
of what effect sizes of ST can be expected compared to
CBT, to calculate how many patients will be needed to
replicate effects indicated in this study. For that purpose,
we descriptively and exploratively analyze the following
hypotheses.

H1: Effects for social anxiety at the end of therapy
(primary endpoint). According to the SOPHO-NET
[36] and the study by Willutzki and colleagues [5], we
expect both CBT and ST to demonstrate a reduction of
social anxiety symptoms, and that CBT will show a
major change compared to the new ST.
H2: Effects for secondary outcomes at the end of
therapy (primary endpoint). According to the SOPHO-
NET [36], we expect CBT to demonstrate a major
change compared to the new ST on psychological func-
tioning, social system and interpersonal functioning,
symptom adjustment, and caregiver burden.
H3: Effects 9 and 12 months after the beginning of
therapy (secondary and tertiary endpoint). According
to the SOPHO-NET [36] and the study by Knekt and
colleagues [4], we expect both CBT and ST to show
stable effects on primary and secondary outcomes dur-
ing the follow-up period.

CBT and ST, respectively (Fig. 1). Cocks and Torgerson
used a confidence interval (CI) approach to calculate
pilot sample sizes for continuous outcome measures.
They supposed 0.3 of a standard deviation between two
groups to be worthwhile, and stated that such a study
would require 350 participants (assuming 80 % power
and a two-sided alpha of 5 %). For pilot studies of which
the primary goal is testing of the recruitment rate, they
found 32 patients (approximately 9 % of the main sam-
ple size) to be required to produce a one-sided 80 %
confidence limit. Cocks and Torgerson concluded that a
pilot trial with that sample size, showed an estimate lar-
ger than zero and demonstrated feasibility to recruit and
retain the patients, and so forth, should move forward
with the main study.

Study procedures
Screening and diagnostic process
Interested individuals will initially take part in a tele-
phone screening assessment of the main socially anxious
symptoms (SCID, social anxiety disorder). Persons meet-
ing the inclusion criteria will then receive the LSAS-SR
self-report measure and SCID screening questionnaires
together with the study information, informed consent
and declaration about the DVD record use by post. After
signing and sending back these documents, the docu-
mentation will be checked and the LSAS-SR score will
be calculated and analyzed. If all documents are signed
and the interested person shows a LSAS-SR >30, then
the individual will be invited to a SCID-I and -II face-to-
face interview, including the assessment of the general
level of functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning;
GAF). These pre-SCID interviews will be rated by inde-
pendent raters with respect to both primary and second-
ary diagnoses. After inclusion based on shared decision
making by clinical experts in the bi-centric case confer-
ence, persons will be randomized. Subsequently, they
will be informed whether they will be treated in the CBT
or ST study arm. Individuals will then attend a social
network interview. In this interview they will select a
family member, best
significant other
friend) who will then be asked to fill in a questionnaire
booklet assessing significant others' burden.

(e.g. partner,

Therapy (T1 to T5) We will assess study outcomes be-
fore the start of therapy, after the 8th, 15th and 20th
hour of therapy, as well as after therapy has ended. At
each time of assessment, patients will participate in an
online survey (UNIPARK)
including study outcomes
(Table 1). The assessment will be conducted at the IMP.
Baseline data (T1) will be scheduled no more than 5 days
before the first therapy session. Therapy process (T2 to
T4) will be assessed no more than 5 days after the 8th,
15th and 20th hour of therapy. The primary endpoint
(T5) will be defined by a joint patient-therapist decision
to end therapy or by the end of 26 hours of therapy. All
outcome variables will be assessed anew, along with in-
and outpatient health care service data. A post-SCID
and social network interview will also be conducted.
Like the pre-SCID, the post-SCID interviews will be
rated by independent raters considering primary and
secondary diagnoses.

Follow-up (T6 and T7) We will assess patients at 9 and
12 months after the beginning of therapy. Again, pa-
tients will participate in the online survey including the
outcomes (Table 1). The assessment will be conducted
at the IMP. The study will close 12 months after the be-
ginning of therapy of the last included patient.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients
Inclusion criteria require patients: 1) to be primarily diag-
nosed with a social anxiety disorder (SCID [50]; corre-
sponding ICD diagnosis: F40.1); 2) to have a LSAS-SR total
score >30; 3) to be on stable medication for at least 4 weeks,
in cases of concurrent pharmaceutical treatment; 4) to
agree to participate in the pilot study and to be randomized
into one of the study arms; 5) to agree to not use additional
therapeutic support during the study period; and 6) to be
18–65 years old. Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1) acute
substance dependency; 2) psychotic disorders; 3) eating
disorders (BMI <14); 4) severe physical diseases; 5) acute
suicidality; 6) insufficient German language skills; and 7)
private health insurance and participation in psychotherapy
financed by the national health insurance companies
within the past year due to administrative regulations at
one of the centers. Comorbid disorders are allowed as long
as the social anxiety disorder is of primary concern.

Therapists
Inclusion criteria required therapists: 1) to be advanced
trainees with more than 300 hours of theoretical and
clinical training; 2) to have therapeutic self-experience of
at least 100 hours; 3) to have completed an internship in
psychosomatic medicine, psychotherapy or psychiatry of
at least 600 hours; and 4) to participate in the CBT or
ST training and supervisions. If therapists have training
in both approaches, they will be assigned to the ap-
they consider their primary therapeutic
proach that
identity. We will choose advanced trainees due to their
strong treatment adherence and ability to deliver treat-
ments effectively in outpatient settings [51].

Randomization
Following inclusion, patients will be randomized, using
block randomization in a 1:1 ratio to obtain equal group
sizes [52]. We will use a randomization plan generator
research
(www.randomization.com). An independent
team will conduct the assignment of patients to study
arms. Therapists will be randomly assigned to patients
as they enter the project.

procedures, but not about specific hypotheses. Blinding
will not be feasible since both the CPP and IMP are well
known for their specific therapy orientation, and because
of the focus on the external validity and generality of the
pilot study to routine care [53]. Outcome assessments at
all points in time will be conducted online (UNIPARK),
and no blinding of assessors will be needed. Pre- and
post-SCID diagnostics will be blinded and the assessors
will not know the study arm in which each patient will
be treated.

Allegiance
The preference of researchers and therapists for a par-
ticular treatment may account for bias in outcome data
[54]. To avoid such bias, we will balance direct and in-
direct allegiance by a bi-centric trail. In this trail, CBT
and ST trainers, supervisors and therapists will be dis-
tinct persons but equally allegiant to their method. They
will be well trained, follow equally elaborate but quite
distinctive manuals. They will receive equal support, and
contribute an equal number of hours and days to the
project [55].

Intervention
Manuals
The CBT manual [8] is well established. The goal is to
establish a realistic self-perception. It includes: 1) gener-
ation of an idiosyncratic version of the disorder and
identification of individual safety behaviors; 2) manipula-
tion of self-focused attention and safety behaviors in role
plays, and using video feedback to demonstrate their ad-
verse effects; 3) training in attentional redeployment and
reduction of safety behaviors through behavioral experi-
ments (expositions), cognitive restructuring and chan-
ging of dysfunctional convictions; 4) relapse prevention;
5) booster sessions after the end of therapy to refresh
therapeutic gains.

The ST manual was written by JS and CH, with con-
sultations from Dr Rüdger Retzlaff (Heidelberg Univer-
sity Hospital). It is the first manual that reviewed ST
manuals for social anxiety disorders in child and adoles-
cent psychotherapy [19] and well-established ST man-
uals for different disorders [20–22], in addition to the
well-written CBT and PD manuals for social anxiety dis-
orders [8, 56, 57]. It is based on general ST concepts
[18], integrating constructivist, solution-oriented [5, 23]
and strategic [24–27] methods, in addition to attending
disorder-specific relational ST dynamics [19, 28, 29]. JS
and CH tested the manual with two patients before
teaching it to the study therapists. Training experiences
were utilized for a last revision before study therapies
started. According to this manual [30], ST combines
three different therapy settings with different partici-
pants in a multisystemic therapy concept. The first two

therapies, and the majority of all therapy sessions alike,
are individual but with a strong focus on relationship is-
sues. They are combined with sessions with partners,
parents or closest friends, and with one 3-hour group
therapy session bringing together project patients and
therapists. The ST manual differentiates between four
phases: 1) generation of an idiosyncratic version of the
function of the social anxiety symptoms including the
identification and inclusion of important private and/or
professional social systems and the important members
within these systems; 2) experimentation with changes
intention,
through symptom prescription, paradoxical
externalization, deconstruction of shared belief systems
and enactment of socially anxious interactions with and
without important social system members; 3) relapse
prevention involving important social system members;
and 4) booster sessions after the end of therapy includ-
ing important social system members to gain a shared
refreshment of therapeutic gains.

Training and supervision
All therapists participated in a 3-day CBT or ST train-
ing. Dr Denise Ginzburg (Institute of Psychology, Johann
Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany)
conducted the CBT workshops; JS and CH conducted
the ST workshops. Supervisions were obligatory for one
out of four therapy hours. Eva Vogel and Dr Meike Pe-
ters (CPP) supervised the CBT group; JS supervised the
ST group.

Adherence
Therapists will estimate their adherence after each ses-
sion. Independent raters will rate therapy session video
recordings for manual adherence. We are currently de-
veloping a Systemic Therapy Adherence Scale (STAS)
and will utilize the Cognitive Therapy Adherence Scale
for Social Phobia (CTACS) [58] as well.

Participation and attrition, responses to crises and
suicidality
We will measure participation and attrition by counting
the number of interested persons who will 1) contact the
recruiting office, 2) participate in the initial screening, 3)
will be SCID-interviewed, 4) included into the pilot
study, 5) drop out before the beginning of therapy, 6)
start therapy, 7) drop out during therapy, 8) end therapy,
9) participate in the 9 months follow-up, and 10) partici-
pate in the 12 months follow-up. We will describe
causes for withdrawing, and calculate the retention rate
for both study conditions separately and together.

Patients will be instructed to contact the therapist
and/or research team whenever experiencing adverse
events. No constraints will exist regarding additional
therapeutic consultations. Inclusion criteria will, however,

Hunger et al. Trials  (2016) 17:171 

Page 9 of 13

not allow for use of additional counseling or therapeutic
support during the study period.

Measures
Screening and assessments
In the screening phase, interested persons will receive
pilot study information, will be asked for the fulfillment
of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and will be SCID-
interviewed for a social anxiety disorder. Potential pa-
tients will receive the LSAS-SR and screening questions
for the SCID interview. In bi-centric case conferences,
supervising experts of both the CPP and IMP, together
with the SCID-diagnosticians, will discuss whether the
cases will fulfil the inclusion criteria.

Primary outcome measures: social anxiety The 24-
item LSAS-SR assesses social interaction and perform-
ance situations feared and the degree of avoidance in the
past week [59, 60] with excellent internal consistency
[61] and good sensitivity to change [45]. The 20-item
SIAS and SPS assess social anxiety in interpersonal in-
teractions (SIAS) or while being observed by others
(SPS) with good to excellent internal consistencies and
sensitivity to change [41–43].

Secondary outcome measures: psychological functioning
The GAF scale measures clinicians’ evaluation of pa-
tients’ psychosocial functioning [62, 63] with high levels
interrater reliability [64] and sensitivity to change
of
[62]. The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)
detects cognitive, motivational, affective and somatic
symptoms of depression with excellent to good internal
consistencies [65, 66] and high sensitivity to change [67].
The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) assesses a variety of
mental symptoms, and is highly correlated to the ori-
ginal SCL-90-R [68–70].

Social system and interpersonal functioning The 12-
item Experience in Social Systems Questionnaire (EXIS)
assesses patients' experience within their important so-
cial systems. The EXIS shows excellent to satisfactory in-
ternal consistencies and good sensitivity to change [71].
The 12-item Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS-12) mea-
sures the quality of marital relationships showing satis-
factory internal consistency [72]. We apply the DAS-12
not only to romantic or marital partners, but also to
other caregivers (e.g. family member, best friend). The
32-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32)
identifies a person’s interpersonal difficulties revealing
excellent to satisfactory internal consistencies [36, 73]
and satisfactory sensitivity to change [74].

Symptom adjustment We developed a 5-item Adjust-
ment to Symptomatology Scale (ASS), inspired by the

Couples Interaction Checklist (CIC) [75], but with a
focus on a patient’s adjustment to psychological prob-
lems in terms of social interactions between the patient
and significant others. We are currently investigating its
psychometric structure in a separate research project
[76].

Caregiver burden The 19-item Burden Assessment
Scale (BAS) measures burden by intimate others with
excellent to good internal consistencies and satisfactory
sensitivity to change [77]. Our German validation found
the BAS psychometric reliable with good internal con-
sistencies [78].

Change measures The 21-item Scale for the Multiper-
spective Assessment of General Change Mechanisms
in Psychotherapy (SACiP) measures general change
mechanisms with excellent
to satisfactory internal
consistencies and demonstrated validity by predicting
outcome [79, 80]. The 4-item Session Rating Scale
(SRS) measures therapeutic alliance [81], and its val-
idity is confirmed by positive correlations with out-
come [82]. The 16-item University of Rhode Island
Change Assessment Scale (URICA) measures stages of
change with excellent to satisfactory internal consist-
encies and demonstrated validity by predicting symp-
toms [83].

and expectancy questionnaire,

Credibility The Opinion About Treatment (OAT) ques-
tionnaire, adapted from Borkovec and Nau’s (1972) cred-
ibility
assesses how
successfully patients think the treatment will be and ap-
pears with excellent internal consistencies [84]. We will
adapt the OAT to a therapist version as well.

Therapist variables The Development of Psychotherap-
ist Common Core Questionnaire (DPCCQ) characterizes
therapists on several subscales [85], of which we chose
interpersonal style, relational skills, quality of therapists’
personal lives and difficulties in practice to be suitable
for this pilot study. The scales have been found predict-
ive of the therapeutic alliance and outcome [86–88].

Service receipt The Client Sociodemographic and Ser-
vice Receipt Inventory (CSSRI-EU) can be used for the
calculation of costs for health service utilization and
medication [89]. Face validity and cross-cultural adapta-
tion are achieved [90].

Statistical analyses
All statistics will be descriptive and explorative using the
SPSS statistical package (version 19.0; IBM, Frankfurt,
Germany). In addition to descriptive measures such as
interquartile range
mean, standard deviation, median,

Hunger et al. Trials  (2016) 17:171 

Page 10 of 13

and confidence intervals, comparisons of primary end-
points between the two groups will be performed using
t-test, Mann–Whitney U test and chi-square test, as ap-
propriate. Missing values on less than 20 % of items for
each scale of all outcome measures will be replaced with
the conditional mean values for the CBT or ST group.

Interrater reliability
Interrater reliability will be calculated by independent
raters for SCID diagnoses before therapy starts (T1) and
at the end of therapy, respectively after 26 hours of ther-
apy (T2). We will also calculate interrater reliability for
the treatment adherence. The percentage of agreement
between the raters on SCID diagnoses, or treatment
adherence, will indicate interrater reliability. Based on
adequate total observer variance, we will also calculate a
more robust measure (e.g. Cohen’s Kappa).

Therapist effects
One-way univariate ANOVA on primary outcome mea-
sures will show intra-group differences within both
treatment conditions at the end of, and 9 and 12 months
after the beginning of therapy. As there will be only
eight CBT and ST therapists each, resulting in low
power, the conclusion that each of them will be equally
effective is tentative. Therefore, potential therapist ef-
fects will not be examined in this pilot study.

Clustering effects
CBT and ST will be administered in two independent
centers. There will be considerable interaction among
the therapists within each study arm, particularly during
training and supervision. Within the ST condition, there
will also be interaction between patients, above all in the
group therapy session. Due to data dependency, we will
conduct two-level (patients, treatment condition) linear
regression analysis to account for positive intra-class
correlations (ICCs) with respect to the primary outcome
measures [91, 92].

Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses
The main analyses of all outcomes will be conducted on
the intention-to-treat sample, comparing both treatment
groups with 32 participants originally allocated after
randomization [93]. This calculation will be regardless of
whether the patients are detected to violate inclusion
criteria, whether they complete therapy or not, or
whether they are withdrawn from the study sample due
to protocol deviations (e.g. changed use of medication,
concurrent psychotherapy during the study period [94]).
This will be followed by per-protocol analysis for the pri-
mary outcome measures (LSAS, SIAS, SPS) with only
patients who fulfill all inclusion criteria, complete the
intervention and do not deviate from the protocol.

Mixed-design ANOVA
We will perform mixed-design ANOVA to identify dif-
ferences between treatment conditions [95]. Factors will
be group (CBT or ST) and time (baseline, 8th, 15th,
20th therapy hour, end of therapy, respectively 26th
therapy hour, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of
therapy). Contrasts A will compare baseline with end of
therapy. Contrasts B will indicate change between end of
therapy, respectively 26th therapy hour, and 9 months
after the beginning of therapy. Contrasts C will indicate
change between end of therapy and 12 months after the
beginning of therapy. We will control for differences in
the length of treatment.

for

Time X Group interaction effect sizes will be assessed
with partial eta-squared (η2)
the mixed-design
ANOVA. Classification of effect sizes will be: η2 ≥ 0.01,
small effect; η2 ≥ 0.06, medium effect; and η2 ≥ 0.14, large
effect. Subsequently, for significant Time X Group inter-
actions,
simple effect analyses within and between
groups will be performed [96]. Between-group effect
sizes will be assessed with η2 and Cohen’s d. Classifica-
tion of Cohen’s d will be: d ≥0.20, small effect; d ≥0.50,
medium effect; and d ≥0.80, large effect [34]. In accord-
ance with Coe [97], we will interpret Cohen’s d in terms
of percentiles. Within-group effect sizes will be assessed
with η2.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first
interventive, balanced, bi-centric,
prospective, open,
explanatory pilot RCT comparing CBT,
thoroughly
evaluated for social anxiety disorders, and ST, a well-
approach that needs more
researched treatment
evaluation with socially anxious patients. For study
purposes, it is a challenge to make these two different
approaches comparable in terms of manualization,
duration of treatment, number of sessions, qualifica-
tions of
and
allegiances of
therapists and researchers. There are
many differences that we will need to bridge. CBT is
paid for by health insurances; ST is not. CBT training
is state-regulated; ST training is regulated by profes-
sional associations. CBT is practiced almost exclu-
sively by psychologists; ST by psychologists, social
workers and other mental health professionals. CBT
tends to use more sessions with shorter between-
session intervals, and it does not intend to include
important caregivers in treatment like ST does.

Innovative aspects
This trial will be the first pilot study that directly com-
pares CBT and ST, integrating a broad range of systemic
methods,
for social anxiety disorders. Former studies
used either MST [6], an incremental design [5], PD, or

Hunger et al. Trials  (2016) 17:171 

Page 11 of 13

did not focus on social anxiety disorders but mood and
anxiety disorders in general [4]. The times of measure-
ment and the instruments we will use are aligned with
these three studies and the SOPHO-NET [48], allowing
for direct comparisons of results.

Biases and limitations
This trial is a pilot study and all statistical analyses will
be descriptive and explorative, with the aim to obtain
data that can then be used for planning a confirmatory
RCT. Consequently, the main RCT is necessary before
any confirmatory statement about the efficacy of ST for
social anxiety disorders can reliably be made. It is also
an open study, and patients and therapists will be in-
formed about the study arm to which they will be allo-
cated. Patients will present
themselves to the study
team, and no patient will be referred. The openness of
this trial and type of recruitment is a naturalistic fact of
“real world delivery of care” ([53]; p. 6). We try to bal-
ance direct and indirect allegiance by conducting a bi-
centric trial, involving equally experienced ST and CBT
experts, and implementing high methodological quality
that appears to buffer allegiance [55]. The additional use
of the OAT questionnaire [84] will help to test if we
could balance allegiance. However, due to the small sample
size, we will not perfectly control for allegiance effects.

Perspectives of a confirmatory trial
We strive for a subsequent confirmatory multi-centric
RCT comparing CBT and ST for social anxiety disorders.
In addition to the psychological correlates we will assess
in this pilot study, we hope to integrate biopsychological
markers (e.g. alpha-amylase, cortisol, heart rate, heart
rate variability).

Trial status
The trial is ongoing and is currently recruiting.
