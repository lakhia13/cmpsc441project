INTRODUCTION

Bullying of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth persists in the United 
States, with harmful and sometimes fatal consequences. Media reports about LGBT youth 
who have died by suicide frequently describe experiences of bullying victimization. For 
example, after being the target of bullying for several years, Adam Kizer died by suicide 
at age 16, 6 months after coming out as bisexual. Adam’s father reported that he was 
bullied starting at age 9, when his peers identified him as “different.”1 Adam suffered 
substantial mistreatment from his peers that was both verbal (eg, suggestions that he should 
kill himself) and physical (eg, tied to a tree, doused in gasoline, and almost set on fire). 
Another example is that of Taylor Alesana, a young transgender woman who experienced 
significant bullying victimization at school and online, and died by suicide at age 16.2,3 She 
described social isolation and rejection on Transgender Day of Remembrance, stating in a 
YouTube video: “Finding friends when you’re transgender, that to me is one of the hardest 
parts because you don’t find a lot of friends. And when you do, a lot of them will leave you 
just because you’re different.”3 The ridiculing comments on YouTube continued even after 
Taylor’s suicide.4

Adam and Taylor’s experiences of bullying by peers are common among LGBT youth. 
Although extreme in their consequences, these examples underscore the need to address 
bullying of LGBT youth. Pediatricians can play an important role in preventing and 
reporting LGBT bullying, supporting LGBT youth who are bullied, and promoting the 
health and well-being of LGBT youth. In this article, we define key concepts relevant 
to LGBT bullying; discuss its prevalence in the United States; review evidence of its 
psychological, behavioral, and physical health consequences; and make recommendations 
for how pediatricians can address it.

KEY CONCEPTS

Sexual orientation is a relational construct involving a pattern of romantic relationships 
with, or desires for, people of a particular gender.5 Sexual orientation is inclusive of 
behavior (eg, whether individuals are sexually engaged with same-gender and/or opposite-
gender partners), identity (eg, how individuals understand and represent themselves based 
on identities such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “bisexual,” or “heterosexual”), and/or attraction or 
desire.6 The first 3 letters of the LGBT abbreviation (LGB; lesbian, gay, bisexual) refer to 
a range of sexual minority orientations that are not exclusively heterosexual. We include 
individuals who are “queer” or “questioning” under the LGBT umbrella.

Gender identity is one’s internal sense of being male, female, or outside these categories, 
and gender expression is the manifestation of culturally defined feminine or masculine 
traits in personality, appearance, and behavior.5,7 The last letter of the LGBT abbreviation 
(T; transgender) refers to a range of gender minority identities and expressions that are 
not aligned exclusively with one’s assigned sex at birth. Some LGBT people display 
a nonconforming gender expression during development; some do not. Children with a 
conforming gender expression may grow up to be LGB or heterosexual; they may be 
transgender or they may not. People have a sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender 
expression, and these are related in complex ways throughout youth development (for a 
discussion of the development of sexual orientation and gender, including their associations, 
see Stewart L. Adelson and colleagues’ article, “Development and Mental Health of LGBT 
Youth in Pediatric Practice,” in this issue).

Having perceived to have a minority sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender 
expression may increase youths’ risk of being bullying. Bullying is defined by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and US Department of Education as:

Bullying is any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of 
youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed 
or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to 
be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including 
physical, psychological, or educational harm.8

This definition emphasizes that bullying behavior is unwanted, meaning that the bullied 
youth wants the behavior to stop. It is aggressive, meaning that it involves the intentional 
use of harmful behavior. A power imbalance refers to a real or perceived ability of the 
perpetrator to control the target’s behaviors or outcomes. Power can be drawn from a variety

of sources, such as physical strength, popularity, or wealth. Incidents are considered repeated 
if they occur multiple times or there is a concern that they are likely to recur. Moreover, 
bullying may result in harm involving negative experiences or injuries.

Mistreatment of LGBT youth is also referred to by other terms in the literature, including 
discrimination and bias. Although we use the term bullying in this article, we acknowledge 
that LGBT bullying is stigma-based and therefore fundamentally discriminatory in nature.

SCOPE OF PROBLEM

Data from US national samples suggest that the majority of LGBT youth experience some 
form of bullying. In 2011, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network surveyed more 
than 8500 LGBT youth aged 13–20 years old in all 50 US states and Washington DC.9 
All forms of bullying were prevalent among these youth (Table 1). Most (92.3%) reported 
experiencing verbal bullying, involving harmful oral or written communication including 
taunting, name calling, and threats. Close to one-half (44.7%) reported physical bullying, 
including the use of physical force such as hitting, kicking, tripping, and spitting. About 
one-fifth (21.2%) reported more extreme physical assault, such as being punched, kicked, 
or injured with a weapon. Most (89.5%) reported social or relational bullying, involving 
behavior intended to harm reputations and relationships including spreading rumors, posting 
embarrassing media content, and socially isolating the target. Nearly one-half (47.7%) 
reported damage to property, such as stealing, damaging, or altering property. More than 
one-half of youth (55.2%) reported bullying via technology, or cyberbullying. Although 
youth attributed experiences of bullying to multiple socially devalued characteristics (eg, 
religion, race/ethnicity, disability), they attributed the majority of bullying to their sexual 
orientation or gender expression. Other data sources suggest similarly high prevalence 
estimates of bullying among LGBT youth.10

LGBT youth generally experience more bullying than non-LGBT youth. In an online study 
of youth ages 13 to 18 years, LGB youth reported more than twice as much online and 
in-person peer victimization as heterosexual youth.11 Moreover, these different rates of 
bullying seem to begin before youth generally identify as LGB: youth who identify as LGB 
in 10th grade are more likely to have reported bullying than non-LGB youth when they were 
in 5th grade.12 Similar differences are documented for transgender youth: approximately 
83% of transgender or gender nonconforming youth reported bullying victimization in the 
past year in comparison with 58% of cisgender (ie, nontransgender) youth in a recent 
study.13 Adolescent boys who are bullied because they are perceived to be gay owing to 
nonconforming gender expression (even if they do not identify as gay themselves) also 
experience more verbal and physical bullying than boys who are bullied for other reasons.14

Although understudied, some work suggests variability in the prevalence of bullying among 
LGBT youth. For example, LGBT youth who have disclosed their sexual orientation or 
gender identity to their peers or school staff report greater bullying relative to youth who 
have not disclosed their LGBT status,9,15 although it is possible that LGBT youth who are 
bullied are more likely to disclose to adults and be discovered as being LGBT by peers. 
Youth who identify as bisexual also seem to report greater bullying.16 The prevalence of

bullying also seems to vary by social context. LGBT youth report more bullying in states 
that do not have laws that prohibit bullying or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation 
or gender identity, and LGBT youth in the Midwest and South report more bullying than 
youth in the North and West.9 Moreover, LGB youth who live in neighborhoods with high 
rates of LGBT assault hate crimes are more likely to report relational and cyberbullying, 
possibly because violence toward LGBT adults in neighborhoods signals acceptance of 
LGBT bullying.17

CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND 

TRANSGENDER BULLYING

Multiple factors contribute to youths’ engagement in bullying against LGBT individuals. 
At the societal level, LGBT stigma (social devaluation and discrediting of LGBT people) 
leads to discrimination and bullying of LGBT youth (see Mark L. Hatzenbuehler and John 
E. Pachankis’ article, “Stigma and Minority Stress as Social Determinants of Health among 
LGBT Youth: Research Evidence and Clinical Implications,” in this issue). At the social 
level, youth socialize and influence LGBT bullying within their peer groups. Certain norms 
within peer groups contribute to greater LGBT bullying, including traditional masculinity 
norms, dominance norms, and overall aggression levels.18,19 Having fewer LGBT friends 
is associated with greater engagement in LGBT bullying. At the individual level, a 
prominent contributing factor is prejudice, or negative attitudes toward others based on their 
minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity and expression that are rooted in LGBT 
stigma.20,21 Greater engagement in LGBT bullying is also associated with holding stronger 
attitudes in support of social dominance, hierarchies, and power differentials among peers 
as well as at a broader societal level against socially devalued groups (eg, racial minorities, 
women).22 Heterosexual youth who place greater importance on their heterosexual identity 
as part of their overall sense of identity and those who are less empathic tend to perpetrate 
more LGBT bullying.20 Boys tend to engage in LGBT bullying more than girls. Also, 
youth who engage in bullying in general are more likely to perpetrate LGBT bullying 
specifically.20

LGBT bullying undermines the mental, behavioral, and physical health of youth, ultimately 
leading to health inequities for LGBT compared with non-LGBT youth that may last across 
the lifespan. As highlighted in the introduction, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and 
completion are a concern for youth experiencing LGBT bullying. Sexual minority youth 
are more likely to think about and attempt suicide than non-LGBT youth, and bullying 
plays a role in these thoughts and behaviors.23,24 Other mental health effects of LGBT 
bullying include greater symptoms of depression and anxiety, and lower self-esteem.9,23,24 
Longitudinal evidence among youth in general suggests that bullying is associated with 
worse mental health outcomes over time, with past experiences of bullying predicting worse 
psychosocial quality of life, more depression symptoms, and worse self-worth.25 Some 
evidence suggests that youth who disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity to 
school peers and staff report greater psychological well-being than those youth who do not, 
despite experiencing greater bullying.9 It is possible that youth who choose to disclose a 
sexual or gender minority status at school gain resilience resources, such as social support,

after disclosing. More research is needed to understand associations among disclosure, 
bullying, and well-being, including the ways in which resilience resources and supportive 
environments affect these associations.

Bullying plays a role in harmful health behaviors among LGBT youth. LGBT bullying is 
associated with greater engagement in substance use, including tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, 
and other illicit drugs (eg, methamphetamines, inhalants).13,26 It is also associated with 
engagement in risk behaviors related to substance use, such as drunk driving.26 Although the 
topic is understudied, LGBT youth who are bullied may engage in high levels of sexual risk 
behaviors (eg, condomless sex, substance use before sex, transactional sex), similar to LGBT 
adults.27,28 Also of concern, LGBT middle and high school students who experience greater 
bullying have higher rates of school absenteeism (often related to fears of being bullied at 
school), lower grade point averages, and lower postgraduation educational aspirations.9

Bullying further affects the physical health of LGBT youth. LGBT youth who are physically 
bullied may suffer cuts, bruises, broken bones, and other direct health sequelae of physical 
violence. Other physical health outcomes are understudied among LGBT youth specifically, 
but a robust body of research describes outcomes of bullying among youth in general. Youth 
who experience bullying are more likely to experience a range of physical health symptoms, 
including increased abdominal pain, headache, poor appetite, sleeping problems, and skin 
problems, as well as greater body mass index, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 
and decreased self-rated health, relative to youth who are not bullied.29,30,31,32 These health 
outcomes seem to be driven, in part, by the mental and behavioral health consequences 
of bullying.30 That is, similar to the ways in which discrimination affects health among 
adults,33 depression, anxiety, and other poor mental health effects of bullying may lead to 
worse physical health. Additionally, youth may engage in harmful coping behaviors (eg, 
substance use to manage anxiety), which ultimately undermine physical health.

The consequences of bullying among LGBT youth seem to be worse than the consequences 
among non-LGBT youth. Youth who experience LGBT-based bullying engage in greater 
substance use and other risk behaviors (eg, drunk driving), and experience higher rates 
of depression than youth who experience bullying that is not bias-based.26 Similarly, 
adolescent boys who are bullied because they are perceived to be gay experience greater 
anxiety and depressive symptoms than boys bullied for other reasons.14

Although rates of bullying among LGBT youth seem to decrease with age,12,34 the mental, 
behavioral, and physical health consequences of bullying may last into adulthood. LGBT 
young adults who self-report frequent bullying as adolescents are more likely to be 
depressed, have had a suicide attempt, engage in sexual risk behaviors including condomless 
sex, and be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection.15,34,35 Similarly, adults who 
experienced bullying associated with having a nonconforming gender expression as youth 
report greater depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction as young adults.36,37 LGBT 
adults who experienced greater bullying as youth are more likely to report posttraumatic 
stress disorder.38

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS

Pediatricians and other clinicians practicing pediatric care have an opportunity and 
professional responsibility to address LGBT bullying to improve the well-being of LGBT 
youth. Here, we make recommendations to pediatricians regarding how to address LGBT 
bullying with patients and parents as well as within communities. We focus on LGBT 
bullying, but many of these recommendations generalize to other forms of bullying. These 
recommendations are largely guided by the American Academy of Pediatrics,39 American 
Medical Association,40 and the US Department of Health and Human Services.41,42 It 
may also be useful for pediatricians to learn about local policies on bullying to help 
individual youth and their families navigate bullying at school. Pediatricians may contact 
representatives of school districts (eg, principals, guidance counselors, school nurses) and 
explore school websites for more information on school bullying policies. Some states also 
have laws that protect students from bullying on the basis of sexual orientation and gender 
identity. The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network maintains state-specific resource 
guides on local bullying policies that may be useful for pediatricians.43 In addition, Title IX 
has been used in several legal cases related to students experiencing discrimination on the 
basis of gender expression.44

Several of our recommendations encourage pediatricians to work with other adults, 
including parents, teachers, school administrators, and other community stakeholders, to 
address LGBT bullying. It is important for pediatricians to bear in mind that these other 
adults may actively or passively mistreat LGBT youth (eg, use antigay epithets to mock 
gay students, ignore bullying).45 Societal LGBT stigma leads both youth and adults to 
discriminate against LGBT youth. Pediatricians must be sensitive to this issue. In some 
cases, it may be possible for pediatricians to identify and work with other accepting adults 
to support LGBT youth. In other cases, when accepting adults are not present within youths’ 
lives, it is critical for pediatricians to act as allies of and advocates for LGBT youth 
experiencing bullying to promote their well-being (eg, by connecting them to community-
based health or social organizations that are LGBT affirming).

Box 1 suggests several steps that pediatricians can take to address bullying. Importantly, 
addressing bullying starts with prevention. Pediatricians can include bullying in anticipatory 
guidance by describing bullying and its consequences to parents and youth.45 They can 
describe what bullying is, and what forms it may take. Pediatricians can also discuss 
techniques to address bullying with youth (eg, tell an adult) so that youth are prepared to 
respond to bullying should they witness or experience it. Pediatricians can also encourage 
parents to promote positive social skills among youth (eg, nonaggressive behavior).46 Any 
youth may experience LGBT-related bullying—not only those who are LGBT—based on 
perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Pediatricians therefore should not limit their 
discussion of LGBT bullying to youth who are LGBT themselves. Similarly, LGBT youth 
may experience many forms of bullying, such as based on race or disability. Pediatricians 
should not limit their discussions with LGBT youth to LGBT bullying, but instead discuss 
all forms of bullying.

Pediatricians should seek to identify youth who are targets of LGBT bullying. This is 
particularly important because many LGBT youth do not disclose their experiences of 
bullying to other adults, including teachers.9 LGBT youth report not telling teachers about 
bullying because they are concerned about teachers’ reactions, they fear making the situation 
worse, and they feel that teachers will not effectively address the situation.9

Pediatricians can contribute to the creation of safe and welcoming spaces wherein LGBT 
youth feel comfortable discussing LGBT bullying (see Scott E. Hadland and colleagues’ 
article, “Caring for LGBTQ Youth in Inclusive and Affirmative Environments,” in this 
issue). Although LGB youth often do not disclose their sexual orientation to their 
physicians, many report that they would be open to discussing it if the subject were raised 
by their physician.47 When seeking to identify bullying, pediatricians should pay particular 
attention to LGBT youth, who are at increased risk of experiencing bullying, and youth 
exhibiting mental, behavioral, or physical symptoms of bullying (eg, anxiety, substance use, 
unexplained physical injury).45 Physicians may ask both youth and parents about bullying. 
Example questions to identify bullying are included in Box 2. Direct questions ask about 
bullying explicitly, whereas indirect questions are meant to generate conversation that may 
provide insight into bullying. If patients or parents indicate that patients have experienced 
bullying, pediatricians may ask follow-up questions to gain more information and determine 
whether it is LGBT bullying. For example, they should listen to see whether homophobic 
epithets are involved in the bullying or whether the youth attributes bullying to their real 
or perceived sexual minority orientation, gender nonconforming behavior, or transgender 
identity.

Pediatricians should provide counsel to youth who are experiencing LGBT bullying. 
Pediatricians can advise youth regarding how to react if they are bullied, including by 
staying calm, walking away, and telling an adult.41 Pediatricians can help youth to identify 
supportive adults (eg, parents, teachers, school administrators) to whom they can turn when 
bullied. Teachers involved in gay—straight alliances, for example, may be advocates for 
LGBT students. LGBT youth report that social support received from these adults at school 
helps them cope with bullying.48 In addition, pediatricians can provide support for youth 
who decide to tell their parents or other adults about experiences of LGBT bullying. 
Pediatricians can further encourage youth to join safe and supportive extracurricular 
activities to reduce social isolation and strengthen their relationships with others.

Pediatricians can also counsel parents of youth who are experiencing LGBT bullying. If 
the pediatrician has learned of the bullying through a private, confidential conversation with 
the youth, he or she cannot tell parents about a patients’ experiences of bullying without 
permission unless the patient is in danger. Moreover, it is worth bearing in mind that many 
LGBT youth (28.4% in a recent survey)9 have not disclosed their sexual minority orientation 
or transgender identity to either one or both of their parents. Some parents, however, may 
raise concerns about LGBT bullying to pediatricians. Pediatricians can encourage parents 
to regularly speak about bullying with their children to identify experiences of bullying and 
provide support if children are bullied. For example, parents can provide emotional support 
by emphasizing to youth that they do not deserve to be bullied. Pediatricians can also advise 
parents on how to report bullying to school officials and connect parents with resources on

bullying. If bullying is not handled by school authorities, parents may be able to file a formal 
grievance with the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and/or the US 
Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.49

Pediatricians may engage in advocacy in their local schools and communities to address 
LGBT bullying. For example, pediatricians may voice support for enumerated laws that 
protect students from bullying and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 
gender identity in states where they do not yet exist. They may also speak out against LGBT 
bullying to school officials and parents. Efforts to reduce LGBT bullying victimization 
should include addressing LGBT stigma in the broader community context. For example, 
physicians can advocate on behalf of transgender individuals by weighing in on bathroom 
use controversies in legislative hearings and amicus briefs.7 LGBT bullying will likely 
persist as long as LGBT stigma exists within society.

DISCUSSION

LGBT bullying is prevalent among LGBT youth, with significant mental, behavioral, and 
physical health consequences. LGBT youth may be denied support from parents, teachers, 
and school administrators. Pediatricians therefore have a vital role to play in promoting the 
well-being of LGBT youth by preventing bullying, identifying bullying, offering counsel 
to youth who experience bullying and to their parents, and advocating for programs and 
policies to address LGBT bullying. Pediatricians have the power, ability, and responsibility 
to contribute to destigmatizing sexual and gender minority youth in their communities, 
thereby making the world a healthier place for their LGBT patients.

KEY POINTS

•

•

•

Bullying of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth is prevalent 
in the United States; the majority of LGBT youth experience some form of 
bullying.

Bullying undermines the mental, behavioral, and physical health of LGBT 
youth, with consequences lasting into adulthood.

Pediatricians can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of LGBT youth 
by preventing and identifying bullying, offering counsel to youth and their 
parents, and advocating for programs and policies.
