Abstract
This paper seeks to determine the extent to which individuals with borderline personality disorders can be held morally 
responsible for a particular subset of their actions: disproportionate anger, aggressions and displays of temper. The rationale 
for focusing on these aspects lies in their widespread acknowledgment in the literature and their plausible primary association 
with blame directed at BPD patients. BPD individuals are indeed typically perceived as “difficult patients” (Sulzer 2015:82; 
Bodner et al. 2011), significantly more so than schizophrenic or depressive patients (Markam 2003). The “responsibility 
question” for patients with BPD has already been raised (Martin 2010; Zachar and Potter 2009; Bray 2003), but this paper 
tackles it from a novel perspective. First, I narrow down the category of things for which the responsibility question is 
specific to individual with BPD. After that, I argue that some of the diagnosis criteria of BPD such as emotional instability 
or impulsivity might serve as excusing factors targeting the “control condition” on moral responsibility. Second, this paper 
also considers another widely accepted condition on moral responsibility: the epistemic condition. The view defended in 
the paper is that the answer to the responsibility question for individuals with BPD, concerning both the control condition 
and the epistemic condition, hinges on an understanding of their epistemic profile.

This paper seeks to determine the extent to which individu-

rationale for focusing on these aspects lies in their wide-
spread acknowledgment in the literature1 and their plausible 
primary association with blame directed at BPD patients.

patients” (Sulzer 2015: 82, Bodner et al. 2011), significantly

more so than schizophrenic or depressive patients (Markham 
2003).2

The  “responsibility  question”  for  patients  with  BPD 
has already been raised (Martin 2010; Zachar and Potter 
2010; Bray 2003), but this paper tackles it from a novel per-
spective. First, I narrow down the category of things for 
which the responsibility question is specific to individual 
with BPD. While it is intuitive that most of us are morally 
responsible for acting aggressively, it is unclear whether the 
same holds of individuals with BPD. As I will explain, some 
of the diagnosis criteria of BPD such as emotional instabil-
ity or impulsivity3 might serve as excusing factors targeting 
the “control condition” on moral responsibility. The control 
condition on moral responsibility claims that S is respon-
sible for x only if S had control over the happening of x 
(Fischer & Ravizza 1998). This condition has, implicitly or 
explicitly, been at the center of the debate of whether people 
with certain personality disorders could be held responsible 
for their actions. When we ask whether psychopaths should 
be blamed, for instance, we often wonder whether they can 
help it.

Second, this paper also considers another widely accepted 
condition on moral responsibility: the epistemic condition. 
This condition posits that for S to be held responsible for 
x, S must possess a certain knowledge or understanding of 
what they are doing (Harman 2011; Mason 2015; Rosen 
2003; Levy 2014).

The view defended in the paper is that the answer to the 
responsibility question for individuals with BPD, concern-
ing both the control condition and the epistemic condition, 
hinges on an understanding of their epistemic profile. People 
with BPD exhibit various pathological cognitive patterns, for 
instance paranoid ideation and dichotomous thinking. As we 
shall see, dichotomous thinking manifests as the inclination 
to make extreme interpersonal evaluations (“This person is a 
monster!”) while paranoid ideation is the tendency to believe 
that one is being threatened by others and their malevolent 
intentions (“I am certain that the nurse is trying to hurt 
me!”). It thus becomes plausible that individuals with BPD 
do not meet the epistemic condition for moral responsibility 
(Kyratsous & Sanati 2016: 974), challenging the common 
assertion that they precisely "know what they are doing."

The  discussion  also  extends  to  the  degree  of control 
individuals with BPD have over their beliefs, focusing on 
the epistemic dimension of the control condition on moral 

2  As an example of this tendency, Sarah Sulzer, notes that “The very 
symptoms  and  behaviors  associated  with  BPD  are  linked  with  how 
providers define the “difficult patient” (2015: 82).

responsibility. The conclusion of the paper highlights the 
fact that while BPD patients are not necessarily devoid of 
indirect control over their beliefs and actions (Levy 2011, 
chap. 5, Meylan 2015) several conditions must obtain. Inso-
far as these conditions are only rarely met, BPD patients 
should not be held to the same degree of responsibility for 
their aggressions as neurotypical individuals. 

The plan of the paper is as follows: In §1, a definition of 
borderline personality disorders is given. In §2, the focus 
shifts to the emotional instability of individuals with BPD, 
specifically addressing anger and aggressivity. §3 delves 
into the potential impairment of empathy in individuals 
with BPD, §4 examines their pathological thinking patterns, 
exploring tendencies for dichotomous thinking and paranoid 
ideation. § 5 provides some background on the notion of 
moral responsibility. In §6, the discussion extends to the 
question of whether individuals with BPD can control their 
frequent aggressions as well as their pathological thinking 
patterns, addressing the control condition on moral responsi-
bility. In §7 I shift focus to the epistemic condition on moral 
responsibility. Finally, I conclude in §8.

While this paper is, to my knowledge, the first attempt 
to provide a detailed philosophical analysis of the extent 
to  which  individuals  with  BPD  meet  the  conditions  for 
moral responsibility, it is also driven by practical concerns. 
Families and caregivers face significant challenges in navi-
gating the tumultuous emotional lives of individuals with 
BPD, which can dramatically affect behavior and relation-
ships (Giffin 2008). Often, they find themselves grappling 
with whether to attribute responsibility and blame to their 
loved ones with BPD or to exempt them due to their condi-
tion. Hopefully, the present discussion will shed some light 
on these issues.

What is borderline personality disorder?

Borderline personality disorder is a complex mental disorder 
that seriously impacts the quality of life of those affected by 
it and that usually develops during early adulthood (Mishra, 
Rawekar and Sapkale 2023: 3). Its severity is underscored by 
a correlation with important emotional instability, impulsive 
and self-harming behaviors as well as with recurrent suicidal 
behavior (Stanley & Brodsky 2005). Consider for instance 
the fact that the mortality rate by suicide is extremely high 
(Mishra, Rawekar and Sapkale 2023: 1): 10% of individuals 
with BPD commit suicide, that is a rate 50 times higher than 
in the general population (Skodol 2005: 3). This disorder is 
also relatively prevalent with estimates placing its preva-
lence between 1 and 2% in the general population. In addi-
tion, approximately 10% of all psychiatric outpatients and 
15%–20% of inpatients are estimated to have BPD (Skodol 

Borderline personality disorder and moral responsibility  

5

2005: 3, Widiger & Weissman 1991; Swartz et al. 1990). 
Therefore, this is a relevant problem that includes a consid-
erable part of patients’ population.

BPD comprises no less than 9 diagnostic criteria, five of 
which are necessary to establish a diagnosis (Mishra, Raw-
ekar and Sapkale 2023: 4). The criteria are as follows:

1.  Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.
2.  A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relation-
ships characterized by alternating between extremes of 
idealization and devaluation.

3.  Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable 

self-image or sense of self.

4.  Impulsivity in at least two potentially self-damaging 
areas (e.g. spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driv-
ing, binge eating).

5.  Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures or threats, or self-

mutilating behavior.

6.  Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood 
(e.g. intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety 
usually lasting a few hours and rarely more than a few 
days).

7.  Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8.  Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling 
anger (e.g. frequent displays of temper, constant anger, 
recurrent physical fights).

9.  Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dis-

sociative symptoms.

Criterion 1 highlights the tendency of individuals with 
BPD to perceive an impending abandonment from those 
close and significant to them (Skodol 2005: 5, Palihawadana 
2019, Matthies et al. 2018). Criterion 2 is about the fact 
that BPD patients often grapple with exceptionally unstable 
relationships, particularly with those closest to them, such 
as family members, roommates, or romantic partners (Scott 
Lori et al. 2017:1). BPD patients typically invest heavily in 
their close relationships and exhibit a tendency to swiftly 
idealize the person. Disappointment with this individual, 
even at minor levels within close relationships, can trigger 
a rapid shift to devaluing the other person, who is now per-
ceived as not caring nearly enough (Skodol 2005: 6; Jeong 
et al. 2022). As we shall see, such dramatic shifts often occur 
in response to the perception of rejection or abandonment. 
Criterion 3 will be discussed in the last part of the paper: 
individuals  with  BPD  have  exceptionally  unstable  self-
images which can lead to further interpersonal difficulties 
such as failing to accept blame and taking responsibility. 
Criteria 4, 5, 6 and 7 are relatively straightforward. Further 
insights into criterion 8 will be provided in §3, where the 
focus shifts to aggression in BPD patients. Paranoid idea-
tion (criterion 9) entails the feeling of being threatened or 

persecuted. For example, a BPD patient may believe that 
nurses are conspiring against her.

These 9 diagnostic criteria conjure up a number of differ-
ent concepts. There are (at least) three categories of patho-
logical symptoms in BPD: symptoms related to pathological 
actions, symptoms tied to pathological emotional regula-
tion, and symptoms associated with pathological thinking 
patterns. The following table sums up these observations:

Concerning the epistemic dimension of the disorder Veen 
& Arntz 2000 note that “Three basic schemata are assumed 
to play a central role in BPD. These can be summarized by 
the following assumptions: ‘‘The world is (i.e. others are) 
dangerous and malevolent’’, ‘‘I am powerless and vulner-
able’’, and ‘‘I am inherently bad and unacceptable’’ (Beck 
et al. 1990, quoted in Veen & Arntz 2000: 24). A schema or 
schemata is a type of belief structure around which the indi-
vidual understanding of the world is organized (Sieswerda 
et al. 2013:36–37). I will argue that it is precisely the influ-
ence of these schemata on individuals with BPD that leads 
to difficulties in reaching verdicts of moral responsibility.

Adding to the complexity of this disorder is its classifica-
tion within diagnostic cluster B. In recent literature, this cat-
egory is frequently associated with moral rather than solely 
medical impairments (Zachar & Potter 2010, Horne 2013). 
Personality disorders are typically divided into three clus-
ters. Cluster A encompasses odd/eccentric disorders, such as 
paranoid personality disorder or schizoid personality disor-
der. Cluster B includes disorders characterized as dramatic/
erratic, such as borderline personality disorder, antisocial 
personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. 
Lastly, cluster C comprises disorders classified as anxious/
inhibited, such as dependent personality disorder or avoidant 
personality disorder.

An intriguing yet perplexing aspect of this classifica-
tion is that the disorders in clusters A and C can be defined 
without referring to any moral terms. By contrast, disorders 
in cluster B incorporate references to moral terms in their 
definitions. For instance, borderline personality disorder 

6 

A. Baehni 

includes a tendency towards disproportionate anger. Antiso-
cial personality disorder is defined by the propensity for vio-
lent behavior towards others without displaying guilt (Black 
2015,) and individuals with narcissistic personality disorder 
exhibit a tendency to exploit those who admire them, among 
other traits (Yakeley 2018).

As a result, some philosophers have suggested the con-
troversial idea that members of diagnostic cluster B are not 
medical conditions but rather moral conditions, arguing that 
the treatment they require is not medical but moral (Char-
land 2004). This is a controversial view, but it does not mean 
(at least as I read it), that individuals with BPD can never be 
exempted from moral responsibility, unlike “real” medical 
patients. Rather, this view emphasizes that the distinction 
between the moral and the medical is not always sharp, espe-
cially when it comes to cluster B disorders and is silent on 
whether they can be morally responsible.

Zachar and Potter note that “the diagnosis cannot rid itself 
of saturated moral value, but (…) it may have indispensable 
nonmoral features that allow us to classify it as a mental 
disorder” (2010: 102). One such non-moral feature is the fact 
that BPD individual suffer intensely from their conditions, 
since they constantly fear being abandoned by those they 
love. Their disorder is also quite clearly rooted in a con-
junction of genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the fact 
that the diagnosis of BPD refers to moral notions does not 
prevent its classification as a medical condition and leaves 
the responsibility question open.

As  these  admittedly  brief  remarks  indicate,  BPD  is 
located at the intersection of fundamental and interconnected 
moral questions. To allow clinicians, patients and families 
to approach challenging situations with the right conceptual 
tools, we should thus strive to clarify these issues. As a first 
step in this direction, the next section discusses the preva-
lence of aggression and disproportionate anger in BPD.

Anger management in BPD

studies, Porter et al. (2020) also found that 95% of individu-
als with BPD reported difficult childhoods.

As indicated, individuals with BPD have a propensity 
toward anger and aggression. These frequent displays of 
anger and aggression can be particularly difficult for family 
members and caregivers, hindering both the patient's healing 
process in therapy and his or her social integration (Scott 
et al. 2017:1). This symptom thus does not come without a 
cost for the individual as it prevents them both from receiv-
ing quality care and from forming fulfilling social bonds 
(Neukel et al. 2022: 2).

It is somewhat difficult to define aggression, but I shall 
use as a starting point the definition suggested by Scott et al. 
(2017: 1): “Aggression, defined as behavior intended to harm 
another person, emotionally, socially, or physically”. This 
definition fits our pre-theorical understanding of aggression 
with the exception that we might want to count as aggres-
sions some behaviors that are not properly intended to harm, 
maybe because they are very impulsive, but that still have 
such an effect.

BPD patients are often referred to as difficult patients, so 
much so that they represent a real challenge for therapists. 
To those around them, these patients can also project an 
image of being violent, aggressive and mean. As an illustra-
tion, consider the following exchange from Nancy Potter’s 
discussion of manipulation in BPD, where Ms A is a patient 
with BPD (2006: 140):

Ms A: You could be dying before you got any help 
around here! My arm is killing me! This place is crazy!
Therapist: Ms. A, I would like to introduce myself. I 
am Dr. Wheelis.
Ms. A: Oh, no kidding! I didn’t expect you. You’re a 
resident? Interesting. You must be either very good or 
very crazy to have taken me on.
Therapist: I can’t tell if that’s an invitation, a warning, 
or both (patient smiled at the comment), but we have 
an appointment tomorrow. For now, perhaps I should 
take a look at your arm.
Ms. A: No, it’s okay, just a little bang.

Diagnostic criterion 6 for borderline personality disorder 
refers to borderline patients' difficulty in controlling their 
anger and aggression levels. These difficulties can manifest 
in a number of ways, some self-directed and some directed 
outwards, towards objects or people (Cackowski et al. 2017: 
2). These intense emotional episodes are often caused by 
and directed at others whose behavior individuals with BPD 
interpret as “being neglectful, withholding, uncaring, and 
abandoning” (Skodol 2005: 6). In his seminal work on the 
treatment of BPD patients, Kernberg showed that aggressive 
behavior and affect in BPD individuals finds deeper roots in 
severe trauma during early childhood, such as physical or 
sexual abuse (Kernberg 1994). In their meta-analysis of 97 

This situation, although relatively mild, illustrates how 
patient with BPD can display anger and aggressivity through 
sarcasm towards a medical professional. But, unfortunately, 
BPD patient’s difficulty to regulate their anger can also man-
ifest in more dramatic situation.

In  their  study  about  anger  and  aggressivity  in  BPD, 
involving 117 adult women between 18 and 24 years old 
with recent history of aggressivity, Scott et al. found that 
66.7% of the participant reported “Aggressive urges, threats, 
or behaviors” (2017: 8) at least one time during the time of 
assessment (three weeks) (2017:8). The study showed that 
aggressive behaviors were almost always directed at others 
“within close relationships (romantic partner or ex-partner: 

Borderline personality disorder and moral responsibility  

7

48%; family member, friend, or roommate: 39%)” (2017:8). 
These findings are consistent with other diagnostic crite-
ria for borderline personality disorder, notably criterion 
2,  which  refers  to  the  fact  that  patients  with  BPD  have 
extremely  tumultuous  close  interpersonal  relationships. 
Typically,  BPD  individuals  react  the  most  aggressively 
towards those from whom they expect care and attention, 
which, tragically, prevents them for entering the satisfying 
and securing close interpersonal relationships they need. 
BPD individuals fear that they will be abandoned by their 
loved ones from whom they expect to be constantly reas-
sured. When these demands are not met, BPD individuals 
typically experience strong emotional responses which in 
turn lead them to react with anger and aggressivity (Scott 
et al. 2017: 2). On the long run, one can see how these vio-
lent reactions can make their worst fear come true: that the 
people they care about will distance themselves.

A final point to address is the connection between BPD 
and criminal behavior. In their review of the literature on 
BPD and criminality Sansone & Sansone observe that a 
significant proportion of inmates suffer from BPD (2009: 
16). Citing Jordan et al. (2016) and their study involving 
female inmates, they observe that, while individuals with 
BDP represent approximately 2% of the population, they 
represent as much as 28% of the female inmate population. 
Another study by Riesco et al. 1998 (also quoted in Sansone 
Randy and Sansone 2009) about male inmates found that 
41% of the inmates have BPD. The overwhelming majority 
of studies cited found a strong correlation between criminal-
ity and BPD. Sansone & Sansone (2009: 18) conclusions are 
that most studies land support to an important asymmetry in 
BPD rates between prison population and regular communi-
ties with BPD individual sometimes forming as much as 50 
percent of prison inmates. In studies comparing men and 
women’s rates of BPD in prison population, they found that 
significantly more female than male inmates could be diag-
nosed with BPD, an asymmetry that is still to be explained 
(2009: 18).4 We can thus see a clear connection between a 
diagnosis of BPD and higher levels of anger and aggression. 
It is also worth noting that these episodes of anger often 
stem from feeling rejected by loved ones. In the next sec-
tion, I turn to one possible way of explaining high levels of 
aggression in individuals with BPD: a potential impairment 
in empathy.

Lack of empathy in BPD

Here,  I  briefly  discuss  a  hypothesis  that  could  explain 
the violent tendencies of patients with BPD: an empathy 
impairment. Drawing an analogy with antisocial personal-
ity disorder, which also falls within diagnostic cluster B, 
we might attempt to explain the violent tendencies of both 
types of personality disorders through a similar impairment 
in empathy. It is widely acknowledged that the violent acts of 
patients with antisocial personality disorder can be attributed 
to their inability to feel empathy (Shoemaker 2015: 146; 
Gao and Adrian 2010). This explanation could potentially 
be extended to patients with BPD.

There are, broadly speaking, two meanings to the word 
empathy in the psychological literature. The first is “cogni-
tive empathy”, that is, the ability to adopt someone else’s 
perspective (Shoemaker 2015: 146). The other one is “affec-
tive empathy” (Shoemaker 2015: 146). In a nutshell, affec-
tive empathy is the ability “to feel what others feel” (Shoe-
maker 2015: 146). It is this second form of empathy that is at 
stake in assessing the moral responsibility both of antisocial 
personality disorders and BPD. Do BPD patients, like anti-
social personality disorder, suffer from an impairment in 
affective empathy?

The  short  answer  is  “no”.  Recent  empirical  findings 
show that individuals with BPD have a higher capacity for 
empathy than neurotypical individuals. This is paradoxical, 
especially in light of the fact that they typically encounter 
difficulties in maintaining stable and fulfilling interpersonal 
relationships (Dinsdale et al. 2013: 172). This increased 
empathy might be explained by the necessity for the border-
line patient to maintain a stable image of those whom they 
perceive as their caregiver. In order to maintain such a stable 
image, the BPD individual develops enhanced sensitivity to 
the subtle, subconscious cues indicating the mental states of 
the person (Dinsdale et al. 2013: 187). This could explain, 
at least partly, BPD patients’ propension to aggressivity as 
they will often perceive hostility that is either absent or so 
mild that others would not notice it (Ripoll et al. 2013: 6). 
Typical examples include individuals with BPD perceiving 
a potential abandonment or hostility if their loved ones don’t 
answer their texts fast enough, if they disagree with them or 
cancel a plan.

In light of the findings discussed in this section, it seems 
implausible that BPD individuals’ tendency for anger and 
aggression could be explained by an empathy deficit, rather 
the opposite. In the next section, I discuss two pathologi-
cal reasoning patterns typical of individuals with BPD that 
could  provide  us  with  a  fuller  picture  of  the  difficulties

diagnosis  in  women,  as  well  as  important  consequences  to  this 
asymmetry.  For  a  recent  discussion  see  Dorfman,  Natalie,  and  Joel

encountered by individuals with BPD in relating to others: 
dichotomous thinking and paranoid ideation. As we shall 
see, they might be especially helpful to explain BPD indi-
viduals’ proclivity towards violence and aggressivity.

Dichotomous thinking & paranoid ideation

Dichotomous and negativistic thinking

As Matt King and Joshua May rightly remark: “the diver-
sity of the ways in which the symptoms of mental disor-
ders affect action makes them an extremely heterogenous 
class, such that there is no supported general inference from 
having a disorder to any claim about moral responsibil-
ity” (2018:20). Before drawing any conclusion, it is thus 
important to get clear on the link between symptoms and 
action. Let us begin with the symptom usually referred to as 
“dichotomous thinking”.

Dichotomous  thinking  is  the  inclination  to  “evaluate 
experiences in terms of mutually exclusive categories rather 
than to see experiences as falling along continua” (Veen & 
Arntz 2000: 23). It is consistent with criterion 2, according 
to which individuals with BPD are especially prone to alter-
nating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. 
Dichotomous thinking is characteristic of BPD individuals 
(Sieswerda et al. 2013) and, like other of their symptoms, 
these schemata stems from traumatic experiences during 
childhood, often involving care givers (Veen & Arntz 2000: 
24).5

Another resembling schemata that is helpful in character-
izing borderline personality disorder is negativistic think-
ing (Sieswerda et al. 2013: 37). Negativistic thinking is the 
tendency to make negative interpersonal evaluations. BPD 
patients tend to evaluate others more negatively than con-
trol groups, especially when presented with schemata related 
stimuli: “Finding negativistic thinking in BPD is in line with 
clinical observations of strong tendencies towards victimi-
zation and suspiciousness in this patient group (e.g. Kroll, 
1988)” (2013: 47). These remarks are in line with studies 
that found that BPD patient typically evaluate others more 
negatively than neurotypical people when presented with 
different stimuli like movie characters, facial expressions, 

5  There  are  two  main  kinds  of  dichotomous  thinking,  unidimen-
sional  and  multidimensional.  Unidimensional  dichotomous  thinking 
is the tendency to make extreme evaluations where these evaluations 
are  always  either  all  good  or  all  bad  (Veen  &  Arntz  2000:  24).  On 
the  other  hand,  “multidimensional”  dichotomous  thinking  is  defined 
as  the  making  of  extreme  evaluations  with  different  valences  on  the 
positive–negative  dimension.  In  this  case,  a  person  can  be  simul-
taneously  evaluated  as  ‘‘totally  reliable’’  and  ‘‘totally  lacking  self-
confidence’’  and  is  therefore  not  seen  as  ‘‘all  good’’  or  ‘‘all  bad.’’ 
(Veen & Arntz 2000: 24). Extreme evaluations can explain that BPD 
patients react in extreme ways. (Sieswerda et al. 2013: 36).

ink blots etc. (2013: 47).6 Importantly, negativistic evalua-
tions in BPD patients are worse when it comes to schemata-
related characters, for instance a parent or a romantic part-
ner. (2013: 48).

It thus seems that BPD patients exhibit two tendencies 
in their interpersonal evaluations: first, they tend to make 
extreme evaluations and, second, they tend to typically eval-
uate those around them more negatively than control groups. 
Taken together, these two inclinations conjure up a picture 
on which BPD patients tend to make extremely negative 
evaluations of those they perceive as being ill-intentioned.
Before discussing the relation of dichotomous and nega-
tivistic thinking to anger and aggression I say a few words 
about paranoid ideation.

Paranoid ideation

Paranoid ideation refers to the persistent belief or suspicion 
that others intend harm or malevolence towards oneself, 
despite lacking sufficient evidence to support such beliefs 
(Beck, Aaron.T., Freeman, Arthur., & Associates 1990). Par-
anoid ideation is often accompanied by a difficulty to trust 
others, a sense of vulnerability (cf. the schemata discussed in 
the introduction) and a readiness to defend oneself through 
aggressive behaviors (Gilbert et al. 2005: 125). Coid et al. 
for instance (2016) observed a strong connection between 
paranoid ideation and violence that couldn’t be explained by 
other psychiatric comorbidities.

Paranoid ideations often lead individuals with BPD to 
interpret neutral or benign interactions as threatening or hos-
tile. It is interesting to note that the perception of mistreat-
ment and neglect has been observed to be comparatively as 
high in BPD patient than in individuals with other person-
ality disorders such as schizophrenia (Kingdon et al. 2010: 
402). The underlying fear of abandonment, another core fea-
ture of BPD, may contribute to the development of paranoid 
thoughts, as individuals with this disorder may perceive any 
rejection or criticism as confirmation of their fears.

Dichotomous thinking, Paranoid ideation 
and Aggressivity

Since individuals with BPD believe that others are malevo-
lent (paranoid ideation) and, generally, tend to make more 
extreme and negative evaluations than neurotypical people 
(dichotomous or negativistic thinking), it does not seem far-
fetched to link their readiness to display aggressive behav-
iors to these thinking patterns. Butler further observes that 

6  See aksi Barnow et al., 2010

Borderline personality disorder and moral responsibility

(2002: 1238): “Several of the beliefs associated with BPD 
patients appear to be not only dysfunctional, but contradic-
tory as well. This internal dissonance may further contribute 
to the maladaptive behavior and distressed affective state 
exhibited by many BPD patients.” For instance, let us imag-
ine that a BPD patient holds the belief that those close to 
them are trying to hurt them and are not to be trusted, but 
that, at the same time, he feels helpless and fears abandon-
ment. It is not difficult to imagine how holding such con-
tradictory and inherently painful beliefs can lead to violent 
emotions.

Having  provided  some  empirical  background  on  the 
symptoms and causes of BPD, we are now in a good posi-
tion to consider whether BPD individuals should be held 
responsible for their frequent aggressions. In the next sec-
tion, I begin by providing some theoretical background on 
the notion of moral responsibility. After that, I move on to 
discussing the control condition on moral responsibility in 
Sect. 6” and the epistemic condition in Sect. 7.

Moral responsibility: some theoretical 
background

A common approach to understanding moral responsibility 
centers on the concept of basic desert (Menges 2023) and 
defines it as "the degree of control over one's actions nec-
essary for those actions to truly deserve blame or praise" 
(Caruso 2021). Derk Pereboom explains that for an agent 
to be morally responsible in the basic desert sense for an 
action: 

“(…) is for the action to be hers in such a way that 
she would deserve to be blamed if she understood that 
it was morally wrong, and she would deserve to be 
praised if she understood that it was morally exem-
plary. The desert at issue here is basic in the sense that 
the agent would deserve to be blamed or praised just 
because she has performed the action, given an under-
standing of its moral status, and not, for example, by 
virtue of consequentialist or contractualist considera-
tions (Pereboom 2014, 2).7

In  the  literature,  this  form  of  responsibility  is  often 
referred to as "responsibility as accountability" (Watson 
2004). Holding someone responsible in the accountability 
sense has practical implications: they can be blamed, pun-
ished and subjected to attitudes like resentment and indig-
nation. Thus, when we ask whether individuals with BPD 
should be held morally responsible, we are asking whether 
they merit to be blamed or punished.

However, it is important to note that moral responsibility 
can also be conceptualized differently. A well-known alter-
native is to understand moral responsibility as attributability, 

the key issue being then whether actions can be rightfully 
attributed to the subject. Attributability, for Watson, is the 
“aretaic face of responsibility”. When is an action attribut-
able to someone? On most views, an action is attributable 
to someone when it reveals something about who they are, 
such as their commitments or values. For David Shoemaker 
for instance, an attitude can be attributed to someone if it 
“expresses (…) the agent’s cares, commitments, or care-
commitments clusters (2015: 59). On the prominent quality 
of will view (Arpaly 2003), one can be held morally respon-
sible for an action if it expresses a lack of concern for those 
it affects. One difference between responsibility as account-
ability and responsibility as attributability is that the former 
is concerned with the appropriateness of reactive attitudes 
such as blame, while attributability centers on attribution 
of virtues and vices. Since this paper aims to clarify how 
people should adjust their relationships with individuals who 
have BPD, for instance by renouncing blaming them, our 
focus will be on responsibility as accountability.

Different theories offer various answers to the question of 
what it takes to be an appropriate target for accountability 
practices. I will adopt a strategy similar to that of King and 
May in their discussion of mental illness and responsibility, 
where they “highlight a few features of agency that differ-
ent theories of responsibility have emphasized, exploring 
the ways in which different disorders will be more or less 
threatening to those features” (2018:15). While King and 
May focus on choice, control, and coherence, I will con-
centrate on the control and epistemic conditions of moral 
responsibility. As is standard in the literature, I will consider 
these conditions to be necessary for the attribution of moral 
responsibility (Rudy-Hiller 2022; Montminy 2021: 168).

Up to this point, I have been speaking in a way that sug-
gests that our practice of holding others responsible, at least 
neurotypical individuals, is justified. In this paper, I will 
not challenge this traditional approach to moral responsibil-
ity. Note however that recent findings in neuroscience and 
philosophy challenge this picture. Prominent philosophers 
have indeed advocated for skepticism about moral respon-
sibility (Levy 2011, 2014; Pereboom 2014, 2022; Caruso 
2021; Caruso & Pereboom 2022, Sommers 2009). Their 
reasons are varied, stemming from concerns about free will 
and determinism (Levy 2011 ), the neuroscience of decision-
making processes (Nisbett and Wilson 1997; Kahneman 
2011), and luck (Levy 2011). However, these skeptics do 
not necessarily reject the practice of holding others respon-
sible—such as through blame—entirely; they merely deny 
that individuals can truly deserve it based on any backward-
looking considerations (Zawadzki 2022). According to these 
views, our responsibility practices can still be justified by 
forward-looking considerations, such as the development of 

7  Quoted in Menges 2023 p. 616.

moral agency (Vargas 2013) and moral formation (Pereboom 
2022).

While the forward-looking approach to moral responsi-
bility is an exciting and promising field, I will neverthe-
less stick to the traditional view, mostly due to its intuitive-
ness. The argument I will present in the next two sections 
is thus conditional: if it is ever possible for anyone to be 
truly deserving of blame and praise, then the epistemic and 
control conditions are the things that needs to be fulfilled. 
The goal then, is to see if individuals with BPD can fulfill 
these conditions.

Do individuals with BPD fulfill the Control 
Condition on Moral responsibility?

The idea behind the control condition is that one must be 
appropriately connected to one’s actions. The most popular 
approach takes this appropriate connection to be a matter of 
whether the agent acted for their own reasons (Wolf 1990; 
Nelkin 2011; Fischer and Ravizza 1998). On Fischer and 
Ravizza’s view, for instance, moral responsibility for an 
action does not presuppose that one could do otherwise; it 
is enough that one is responsive to reasons.

Now, there are two sides to reason-responsiveness. On 
the one hand, reason-responsiveness has a receptivity or 
recognitional component that requires the agent’s ability to 
form beliefs based on evidence. On the other hand, reason-
responsiveness has a reactivity or motivational component 
that requires the agent to acquire the relevant motivational 
states, such as desires, emotions and volitions. As Pereboom 
and  McKenna  (2016:  219)  explain:  “Receptivity  is  the 
capacity to recognize and evaluate a spectrum of reasons for 
action, while reactivity is the capacity to act in accord with 
such recognition and evaluation of reasons”. This means that 
a responsible agent must be able to form beliefs based on his 
reasons and to be motivated to act according to such reasons.
As  it  is  difficult  to  think  about  responsibility  in  the 
abstract, in this section and the next, I will anchor my dis-
cussion in the following case:

Inheritance: Mario is a young man diagnosed with 
borderline personality disorder (BPD). His condition 
is  rooted  in  his  early  life  experiences,  particularly 
his abandonment by his biological parents when he 
was two years old. Following this trauma, Mario was 
adopted by a caring and loving family, who later had 
two additional children. As Mario grew older, his dis-
order manifested in frequent outbursts of aggression 
towards his siblings and adoptive parents, whom he 
accuses of "not loving him as much as his other sib-
lings." He often blocks them on social media, shouts 
at them in public, and has even slapped his mother on 

several occasions. Additionally, Mario has developed 
paranoid fears, accusing his siblings and parents of 
attempting to "rob him of his money" and of "conspir-
ing against him". Despite these beliefs, none of his 
accusations are true; his siblings and parents love him 
dearly and are deeply saddened by his tendency to per-
ceive their actions as malevolent. As of today, Mario 
does not receive proper therapeutic help.

Does Mario fulfill the control condition on moral respon-
sibility for slapping his mother and blocking his family on 
social media? Does he possess the receptivity and reactivity 
components of reasons responsiveness?

Let us start with the reactive component. One way to 
argue  that  individuals  with  BPD  partly  lack  reactive  or 
motivational control is by noting that, according to diag-
nosis criterion 4, they are very impulsive. In addition, we 
also noted that these individuals are prompt to experiencing 
disproportionate level of anger (criterion 8). This supports 
the claim that individuals with BPD may lack some moti-
vational control. When in the grip of anger, they usually 
swiftly respond with aggression to what they perceive as 
harmful behavior, for instance by blocking their family on 
social media, ripping pictures apart, deciding to move out of 
the house, or break up, even when their loved ones do every-
thing in their power to calm the situation. They might know 
that they shouldn’t scream in public or slap people, but they 
will do it nonetheless for the reasons we just mentioned such 
as their impulsivity. It is nevertheless important to note that 
saying that Mario partly lacks motivational control for his 
aggressions does not mean that Mario does not satisfy this 
condition concerning many of his other everyday actions.

So, individuals such as Mario lack motivational control 
on their aggressions insofar as these actions are not normally 
responsive to reasons. This is relatively uncontroversial: we 
usually regard people who lack motivational control due to 
their emotional immaturity and impulsivity, such as ado-
lescents, at least somewhat responsible to a lesser degree.

However, the way in which BPD individuals fail to fulfill 
the control conditions runs deeper than the purely motiva-
tional level. Consider the receptivity or recognitional com-
ponent (Pereboom & McKenna 2016: 219). As Neil Levy 
remarks, there is an important epistemic dimension to the 
control condition, having to do with the control we have 
over our belief acquisitions (Levy 2011: 112). The problem 
with BPD individuals is thus not only that they have diffi-
culties in controlling their reactions, but also that they face 
difficulties in controlling their beliefs. Following Levy, if 
one’s beliefs are reasons-responsive and if one’s reasons for 
action are one’s beliefs, one’s actions are reasons-responsive 
(Levy 2011: 111). We will deny that individuals with BPD 
have such a capacity.

Borderline personality disorder and moral responsibility  

11

In earlier sections, we identified two cognitive patterns 
prevalent in BPD patients, dichotomous thinking and para-
noid ideation, which could account for their  inclination 
toward aggression. Some core beliefs of individual with 
BPD, such that others are generally malevolent and that 
their loved ones are on the verge of abandoning them are 
not responsive to reasons. This is why we have called them 
“basic schemata” in Sect. 1 . They are exceptionally hard to 
revise in the face of countervailing evidence. As an illustra-
tion, let us imagine that Mario’s parent would tell him “Of 
course we are not going to take your money away, we love 
you!”. Individuals with BPD are likely to respond with even 
more suspicion, fearing that this is only a strategy to prevent 
them from getting their share. So, if these cognitive patterns 
are inherent to the BPD diagnosis, not responsive to reasons 
and plausibly explain their conduct, does this mean that we 
should not hold them accountable for their actions?

One tempting stance is to exempt them entirely, attrib-
uting these thinking patterns solely to diagnostic criteria 
rooted, as we have seen, in childhood trauma and genetic 
causes. However, while Mario lacks direct control over 
his belief acquisition, he might still be able to exert indi-
rect control over her beliefs (Levy 2011: 130), in a way 
that could ground moral responsibility (Meylan 2015). 
Mario lacks direct control over the belief that his family 
is malevolent and is trying to harm him, but he might have 
indirect control over it. For example, he might work on 
his underlying fear of abandonment with a therapist and, 
over time, come to revise his belief. Now imagine that 
Mario was offered professional help and that he decided to 
stop going because it was too time consuming and didn’t 
like that the therapist wasn’t always agreeing with him. In 
this case, Mario’s direct responsibility for believing his 
parents are malevolent remains limited due to his limited 
reason-responsiveness. However, he would still be indi-
rectly blameworthy because he is directly blameworthy for 
refusing to attend therapy when it was available.

Levy defines indirect control as “control in virtue of 
having control over something else” (2011: 130) adding 
further that “So far as responsibility is concerned, there 
seems little reason to treat direct and indirect modifica-
tions in our doxastic states differently: full-blooded moral 
responsibility could as easily be the product of indirect 
as direct modification (…) (2011: 130)”. Indirect control 
could be relevant to revising pre-existing beliefs such as 
“people are generally malevolent” as well as to the forma-
tion of new ones such as “right now, my parents are being 
unfair towards me and love my siblings more”.

Under what circumstance could BPD exert indirect con-
trol over their pathological cognitive patterns? Addressing 
this question requires considering the broader context of 
their condition. It is plausible that not all BPD patients 
are equipped to exert indirect control over their beliefs, 

especially if they are unaware of their condition or lack 
access to adequate professional help. For those receiving 
appropriate therapeutic assistance, the responsibility ques-
tion becomes pertinent. In such cases, it falls upon their 
therapist to elucidate the various facets of their condition 
and its underlying causes. Ideally, an individual would 
then be empowered to mitigate the effects of their cogni-
tive patterns, though it is unlikely that they would disap-
pear entirely. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms at 
play could enable them to temper some of their cognitive 
behaviors, for instance, refraining from interpreting every 
setback as an abandonment, or tempering extreme evalu-
ations of those close to them. This is, in fact, the goal of 
the therapeutical process for BPD patients and in many 
cases, it has showed promising results. It now becomes 
increasingly clear that contrary to some common miscon-
ception, BPD patients are not beyond therapeutic help. 
Studies such as Stone’s (2017), focusing on the long-term 
follow-up of BPD patients (25–50 years) notably show 
that over two-thirds reach clinical remission. Dialectical-
behavioral therapies for instance have been shown to be 
very efficient in mitigating most manifestation of the dis-
order, especially when combined with appropriate medica-
tion (Mishra, Raweka and Sapkale 2023; Choi-Kan, Finch, 
Masland et al. 2017). Such therapies include revising some 
of their core beliefs as well as learning to manage their 
emotional reaction and their aggression levels.

In conclusion, the intermediate answer to our initial ques-
tion—whether individuals with BPD can be held account-
able for their displays of aggression when it comes to the 
control condition—is nuanced. They can be held account-
able to the extent that they are equipped with the necessary 
tools to indirectly revise their beliefs as well as to learn to 
manage their emotional reaction and aggressions. I have 
explained how dialectical-behavioral therapy can target the 
basic schemata discussed in Sect. 1.. It will also be useful 
to note that it can be very efficient in managing individuals 
with BPD’s reaction since it is focused on behavior, thus 
increasing their motivational control. For instance, they can 
learn how to avoid such and such situations, learn to take 
some distance from their own emotions and so on.

However, given that this scenario represents an ideal, 
and potentially rare, circumstance, it is plausible that BPD 
patients  often  bear  diminished  responsibility  for  their 
aggressive behaviors because they often fail to fulfill (even 
indirectly) the control condition on moral responsibility both 
on the recognitional and motivational aspect. I now move on 
to the epistemic condition on moral responsibility.

12 

A. Baehni 

Do individuals with BPD fulfill the Epistemic 
Condition on moral responsibility?

The epistemic condition on moral responsibility tells us that 
for S to be responsible for x, S must have some knowledge 
or understanding of what S is doing. There are two main 
ways in which one can lack knowledge or understanding: 
factual and moral.

Consider a paradigmatic case of factual ignorance: if S 
believes that she is pouring sugar into her mother's tea but 
is actually pouring cyanide because someone replaced the 
sugar with cyanide, she cannot be held morally responsible 
for her mother's death, as she was justified in believing it 
was sugar (Harman 2011: 448). In contrast, consider a para-
digmatic case of moral ignorance: a father who believes it 
is permissible to save money for his son’s college tuition 
but not for his daughter’s. While it is clear that the person 
in the first scenario is excused, the situation with the father 
is more complex. On the one hand, he appears blameworthy 
for his sexist treatment of his daughter. On the other hand, 
his ignorance may not be entirely culpable, given that he was 
shaped by the sexist norms of his time. While it is widely 
accepted that factual ignorance can exculpate, extending this 
verdict to moral ignorance is thus more contentious (Har-
man 2011: 450). Before we address this question, we must 
first ask whether individuals with BPD are ignorant in one 
of the two ways.

At first glance, individuals with BPD possess factual 
knowledge; for example, they know they are shouting or 
hitting someone. Thus, one might argue that individuals with 
BPD cannot be excused on the grounds of factual ignorance. 
However, when we examine Mario’s case more closely, it 
becomes clear that while he may have some factual aware-
ness of his actions, he remains ignorant of key elements of 
the situation: he does not know that his family has good 
intentions and is not trying to hurt him. Similar to a person 
unknowingly pouring cyanide into tea, Mario is unaware 
that his actions—his violent behavior—are directed toward 
people who are, in fact, benevolent. In this way, Mario lacks 
factual knowledge and, therefore, can be excused. This rea-
soning can be extended to many cases involving individuals 
with BPD, where paranoid ideations and negativistic think-
ing result in a form of factual ignorance that can serve as 
grounds for excuse. These symptoms of their condition ren-
der them particularly at risk to have inaccurate factual beliefs 
about their loved ones and caregivers. The story could end 
here if all cases of aggressions in BPD were due to factual 
errors.

However, there are also numerous instances where indi-
viduals with BPD do not believe their caregivers or family 
members are malevolent but still act aggressively toward 
them due to impulsivity. In such cases, they often fail to 

recognize their actions as morally wrong. Typically, they 
might say things like, “I have a right to express my feelings 
even if it hurts others,” or “People should accept me as I am, 
unconditionally,” or dismiss the harm with statements like, 
“It’s not a big deal.” They may also shift the blame to others 
when confronted. As Sieswerda et al. (2013: 47) explain, 
individuals with BPD exhibit a strong tendency toward self-
victimization, making it harder for them to take responsibil-
ity for their actions. This frequent failure to take respon-
sibility is well documented8 and can be explained by the 
unstable self-image of individuals with BPD (Leichsenring 
et al. 2024). Admitting that they are wrong is nearly impos-
sible for them insofar as doing so threatens their already 
fragile sense of self (criterion 2). In such cases, it seems 
clear that the kind of ignorance that is at stake is moral rather 
than factual ignorance: it is about what is permissible and 
what is not. So, the question essentially becomes under what 
circumstance one is blameworthy for one’s moral ignorance. 
This question has been much discussed. In what follows I 
offer a brief summary of the existing views.

There exist different answers to the question of whether 
and when moral ignorance exculpates. They can be, roughly, 
classified in three categories. The first category comprises 
views such as Rosen’s (2003) and Zimmerman’s (1997) on 
which an agent is only culpable for acts done out of igno-
rance if he is culpable of some action that “directly caused 
the agent’s current ignorance” (Mason 2015: 3039). On 
the proposed view, one can be derivately responsible for 
acts done out of ignorance if one is directly responsible for 
one’s ignorance. In turn, one’s ignorance is culpable only 
if it stems from a case of clear-eyed akrasia. As Fitzpatrick 
notes “we don’t get culpability until we arrive at a relevant 
episode of clear-eyed akrasia—either in the present action 
or in antecedents that contributed to the ignorance involved 
in the present actions” (2008: 593).

In my opinion, these views are not demanding enough. 
As others (Fitzpatrick 2017: 31) have noted, it lets too many 
people off the hook as we only rarely do wrong while think-
ing it is wrong. Rapist, for instance, often seem to think 
that their victim “deserved it” or that they were “asking for 
it”. On this view, people can be accused of being culpably 

8  Although  it  is  somehow  difficult  to  find  academic  works  on  the 
topic,  references  to  this  difficulty  abound  on  website  dedicated  to 
helping  families  cope  with  individuals  with  BPD.  See  for  instance 
https:// www. group ortth erapy. com/ blog/ borde rline- perso nality- disor

Quora

BPD,  testifying  that  their  loved  ones  with  BPD  can  never  admit 
that they are wrong. It is surprising that not more academic work is 
devoted  to  this  aspect  of  living  with  an  individual  with  BPD.  See

morally ignorant only when they voluntarily cause their own 
ignorance. One example could be that of someone who, 
knowing that their victim will probably confront them about 
what they did, decides to block her on social media to avoid 
having to face difficult truths.

However, it is evident that we are often culpably morally 
ignorant even when we cannot be accused of having vol-
untarily caused our ignorance. For instance, many people 
think that it is morally permissible to drown kittens, a moral 
belief which seems to me to be culpable, even if they didn’t 
voluntary caused their own ignorance.

The second category of views admits that one can be mor-
ally responsible for an action while being ignorant of its 
moral significance as long as this action reveals something 
bad about one, such as, for instance, one’s insufficient moral 
concern for others. According to these views, blamewor-
thiness presupposes a bad quality of will. Elizabeth Har-
man (2011) and Nomy Arpaly (2003) are advocates of such 
views. As Mason notes, their views differ in that Harman’s 
does not take epistemic error to be necessary for blame-
worthiness. One can be blameless as a believer, and still 
be blameworthy as a moral agent. Contrary to that, Arpaly 
has it that, in order to have a bad quality of will, an agent 
must have ignored evidence (2003: 104, Mason 2015: 3044). 
This seems to me to be on the right track. One concern with 
Harmann’s view is that it might not let enough people off 
the hook. Imagine that someone behaves epistemically in a 
way that fulfills reasonable expectations towards them: they 
consider evidence carefully and take other people’s testimo-
nies seriously. In this case, it would be unfair to deem their 
ignorance culpable and thus to hold them responsible for 
ensuing actions.

This brings us to a third category of views, which take 
epistemic fault to be necessary for blameworthiness, where 
this epistemic fault need not be “freely and knowingly pass 
an opportunity for knowledge” (Levy 2011: 117) or the igno-
rance of relevant evidence. Michelle Moody-Adams (1994), 
Williams Fitzpatrick (2008, 2017) and Alex Guerrero (2007, 
2017) have defended such views. I will focus on Fitzpatrick’s 
approach. On his view, the knowledge condition on moral 
responsibility should be spelled out as follows:

Ignorance, whether circumstantial or normative, is cul-
pable if the agent could reasonably have been expected 
to take measures that would have corrected or avoided 
it, given his or her capabilities and the opportunities 
provided  by  the  social  context,  but  failed  to  do  so 
either due to akrasia or due to the culpable, nonakratic 
exercices of such vices as overconfidence, arrogance, 
dismissiveness, laziness, dogmatism, incuriosity, self-
indulgence, contempt and so on. (2008: 609).

He illustrates this with the case of a greedy businessman, 
Mr Potter, who engages in clearly morally objectionable 

practices in order to enhance profit and honestly thinks what 
he does is morally permissible. On the proposed view, Mr 
Potter is blameworthy because his ignorance is culpable to 
the extent that it stems from the above-mentioned vices. If he 
wasn’t, for instance, over-confident or dogmatic, he wouldn’t 
have believed that what he does is permissible. As Fitzpat-
rick notes, three aspects of Potter’s situation should lead us 
to conclude that his ignorance is culpable. First, there is “no 
relevant limitations in his social context” (2008: 605) that 
could have limited his abilities to reflect on these matters. 
Second, his failure to properly reflect on these issues is the 
result of “voluntary exercises of vices”. Finally, he could 
“reasonably have been expected to take steps that would 
have eliminated that ignorance, by refraining from exercis-
ing those vices and instead taking advantage of the epistemi-
cally relevant opportunities available to him” (2008: 605).
One might object that it is unreasonable to expect Mr. Pot-
ter to revise his belief, given that the people around him—
such as his colleagues—share his view that their business 
practices are just “how business is done”. One could thus 
argue that Mr. Potter lacks epistemically relevant opportu-
nities to reconsider his beliefs. However, this defense likely 
fails. If we assume that Mr. Potter consumes news media 
like many of us, he must be aware that businesses like his 
exploit vulnerable populations and contribute to the climate 
crisis. Additionally, it’s plausible that not all of Mr. Potter’s 
acquaintances share his views. Perhaps his stepbrother is an 
environmental activist, or his young cousin frequently posts 
about the human rights issues in fast fashion on Instagram. 
He may even witness protests in his town. Given these epis-
temic opportunities, Mr. Potter has more than enough access 
to information that could challenge his belief. Fitzpatrick’s 
view thus leads to the intuitive conclusion that Mr. Potter is 
blameworthy for his moral ignorance. One further advan-
tage of this view is that its focus on reasonable demands 
is helpful in thinking about responsibility in the account-
ability sense as we have defined it: one is culpable for one’s 
ignorance in the accountability sense if it would be reason-
able for others to expect him to e take measure to correct 
or avoid it.

Now, is Mario responsible for his moral ignorance when 
he fails to take responsibility for his actions? Again, the 
answer is likely to be no. Recall that the three criteria iden-
tified by Fitzpatrick for the culpable moral ignorance of Mr 
Potter are the following.

First, there is “no relevant limitations in his social con-
text” (2008: 605) that could have limited his abilities to 
reflect on these matters. In Mario’s case, it is clear that there 
are such limitations in his social context. As I emphasized, 
it is important that individuals with BPD are diagnosed and 
receive proper therapeutic help to revise their problematic 
beliefs. As Mario is not diagnosed, there are limitations on 
his social context for understanding what is really going on.

A. Baehni 

The second criterion is that Mr. Potter’s failure to prop-
erly reflect on these issues is the result of the “voluntary 
exercises of vices”: if he didn’t have those vices, he would 
probably  have  different  beliefs.  By  contrast  with  this, 
Mario’s moral ignorance does not stem from the voluntary 
exercise of vices such as arrogance or overconfidence. It is 
of course possible that there are arrogant people with BPD 
or that they sometimes are overconfident. However, even 
if they weren’t arrogant or overconfident, individuals with 
BPD are likely to maintain the same beliefs concerning the 
moral permissibility of their actions for the reasons we men-
tioned: because of their unstable sense of self (Leichsenring 
et al. 2024), they have a hard time recognizing their actions 
as morally wrong.One indication of this is found in a study 
by Peters et al. (2016), in which they found that individu-
als with BPD typically experience relatively low degrees of 
guilt compared to control groups. As I have explained, this is 
becauseadmitting that they did wrong, either to others or to 
themselves, would further threaten their internal coherence. 
There is thus a clear explanation as to why they regard their 
actions as incorrectly being permissible and harm their loved 
ones by not apologizing to them: their beliefs are not caused 
by the individual’s vices but by the well-known symptoms 
of their disorder.

Finally, the last criterion is that he could “reasonably 
have been expected to take steps that would have eliminated 
that ignorance, by refraining from exercising those vices 
and instead taking advantage of the epistemically relevant 
opportunities available to him” (2008: 605). Can we reason-
ably demand of Mario that he had different moral beliefs? 
Were there epistemically relevant opportunities available to 
him? In Mario’s specific case, the answer to the first question 
is “no” as it is said in the example that he does not receive 
appropriate therapeutic help.9 Further, it seems unreason-
able to expect him to recognize the true moral nature of her 
actions when doing so is psychologically so costly for him.

Conclusion

In this paper, I have explored the moral responsibility of 
individuals with BPD by focusing my discussion in two key 
aspects. First, I focused on a specific aspect of their behav-
ior: their frequent expressions of anger and aggression. Sec-
ond, rather than solely delving into the concept of control, I 
also examined the epistemic condition of moral responsibil-
ity. The overall conclusion is that BPD patients’ control and 
epistemic capacities are limited. In typical circumstances, 

9  Of  course,  depending  on  some  circumstances  such  as  his  age,  his 
education, his wealth, social context and so on, one could expect that 
Mario seeks therapeutic help by himself. It is thus difficult to render 
definitive verdict in the abstract.

we should thus generally renounce holding them morally 
responsible for their aggression to the same degree as we 
would hold responsible a neurotypical individual for their 
anger and aggressions. We should also keep in mind that 
capacities in regulating one’s belief and actions will vary 
from one individual to another, depending, for instance, 
on whether they receive appropriate treatment or not and 
on the gravity of the disorder. In ideal circumstance, when 
individuals with BPD receive proper care and information 
about their conditions from medical professional, they might 
become fitting targets for moderate attribution of moral 
responsibility.
