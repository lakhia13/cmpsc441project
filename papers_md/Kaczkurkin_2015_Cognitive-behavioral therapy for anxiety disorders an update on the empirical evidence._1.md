Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety  
disorders: an update on the empirical evidence 
Antonia N. Kaczkurkin, PhD; Edna B. Foa, PhD

Introduction

  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  has  been 

shown  to  be  effective  for  a  wide  variety  of  mental 
health  disorders,1  including  anxiety  disorders.2-6  CBT 
has also been associated with improvements in quality 
of life in anxiety patients.7 CBT is typically conceptual-
ized as a short-term, skills-focused treatment aimed at 
altering maladaptive emotional responses by changing 
the patient’s thoughts, behaviors, or both. The origins of 
CBT can be traced back in part to the theories of early 
researchers  such  as  B.  F.  Skinner  and  Joseph  Wolpe, 
who pioneered the behavioral therapy movement in the 
1950s.  Behavioral  therapy  supposes  that  changing  be-
haviors leads to change in emotions and cognitions such 
as appraisals. Since its introduction, behavioral therapy 
has  evolved  to  include  cognitive  psychotherapy,  pio-
neered by the early work of psychologists such as Albert 
Ellis and Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy focuses on 
changing cognitions, which is proposed to change emo-
tions and behaviors. Subsequently, the terms cognitive

A large amount of research has accumulated on the ef-
ficacy and effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral thera-
py (CBT) for anxiety disorders including post-traumatic 
stress  disorder,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  panic 
disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  social  anxiety 
disorder, and specific phobia. The purpose of the cur-
rent  article  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  two  of  the 
most commonly used CBT methods used to treat anxi-
ety disorders (exposure and cognitive therapy) and to 
summarize  and  discuss  the  current  empirical  research 
regarding the usefulness of these techniques for each 
anxiety  disorder.  Additionally,  we  discuss  the  difficul-
ties that arise when comparing active CBT treatments, 
and we suggest directions for future research. Overall, 
CBT appears to be both efficacious and effective in the 
treatment  of  anxiety  disorders,  but  dismantling  stud-
ies are needed to determine which specific treatment 
components lead to beneficial outcomes and which pa-
tients are most likely to benefit from these treatment 
components.

therapy,  behavioral  therapy,  and  cognitive-behavioral 
therapy have emerged. For the purposes of parsimony 
and to facilitate discussion of this diverse set of treat-
ments, in this article we group the cognitive and behav-
ioral  therapies  under  the  umbrella  term “CBT”  while 
acknowledging that the relative emphasis of cognitive 
vs behavioral techniques differs across treatment pro-
grams. 
  Over the years a large number of diverse protocols 
have  been  created  for  providing  CBT  to  patients  with 
post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD), panic disorder (PD), specific phobias, and social 
anxiety disorder, as well as those with nonspecific anxi-
ety symptoms. There is a wealth of information regarding 
these treatments and their use, and entire books are ded-
icated to describing CBT-based therapies for each specif-
ic anxiety disorder. Therefore, a systematic review of the 
CBT treatments for each anxiety disorder is beyond the 
scope of this paper. However, despite the large number 
of diverse CBT protocols for treating anxiety disorders, 
important similarities exist between these various treat-
ments which provide a basis for discussion. 
  The purpose of this article is to provide an overview 
of  two  categories  of  CBT  methods  that  permeate  a 
wide variety of anxiety disorder-specific treatments and 
to  provide  a  review  of  the  current  empirical  research 
related to these techniques. We start by describing two 
of  the  most  commonly  used  CBT  treatment  methods 
(exposure and cognitive therapy) followed by a review 
of the empirical literature investigating the efficacy and 
effectiveness of these methods in treating each anxiety 
disorder. We end with a discussion of the nuances that 
arise  in  comparing  CBT  treatments  for  anxiety  disor-
ders and we propose directions for future research. In 
structuring  our  review  of  these  CBT  methods,  we  ac-
knowledge that these techniques are often interrelated 
and not necessarily applied in isolation from each other. 
For clinicians wanting to learn more about the particu-
lars of applying CBT protocols in practice, we encour-
age them to seek out one of the many anxiety disorder-
specific CBT books available (for an overview, see CBT 
for Anxiety  Disorders: A  Practitioner  Book,  edited  by 
Gregoris  Simos  and  Stefan  G.  Hofmann,8  or  Clinical 
Handbook of Psychological Disorders, edited by David 
H. Barlow9). Additionally, this paper is meant to be an 
introduction to CBT for anxiety; therefore, this discus-
sion of CBT methods is neither meant to be exhaustive 

nor static, and is expected to be adapted and revised as 
future research dictates. 

Exposure therapy

Exposure-based techniques are some of the most com-
monly  used  CBT  methods  used  in  treating  anxiety 
disorders.  One  theoretical  framework  for  understand-
ing  the  rationale  for  exposure-based  treatment  comes 
from emotional processing theory.10 According to emo-
tional processing theory, fear is represented by associa-
tive networks (cognitive fear structures) that maintain 
information  about  the  feared  stimulus,  fear  responses 
(eg, escape, avoidance, psychophysiological responses), 
and the meaning of the stimuli and responses (eg, tiger 
=  danger,  increased  heart  rate  =  heart  attack).  When 
a  stimulus  in  the  environment  is  encountered  that  re-
sembles the feared stimulus, these associative networks 
activate the fear structure. The fear structure is patho-
logical when the relationship among stimuli, responses, 
and their meaning do not match reality, such  as when 
it is activated for safe stimuli or responses that resem-
ble the feared ones. Furthermore, the fear structure is 
maintained by avoidance behaviors which do not allow 
for new learning to occur. 
  Exposure  is  proposed  to  modify  the  pathological 
fear  structure  by  first  activating  it  and  then  providing 
new information that disconfirms the pathological, un-
realistic  associations  in  the  structures  (eg,  tachycardia 
does not lead to heart attack, crowded malls do not lead 
to violent attack). By confronting the feared stimulus or 
responses and integrating corrective information in the 
fear memory, fear is expected to decrease. Exposure can 
take  several  forms  including  imaginal,  in  vivo  (in  real 
life), and interoceptive. Imaginal exposure occurs when 
the patient vividly imagines the feared situation/conse-
quences and does not avoid their subsequent anxiety. In 
vivo exposure involves gradual approach to places, ob-
jects, people, or situations that were previously avoided 
although they are safe. Interoceptive exposure, which is 
mostly used in treating panic disorder, involves deliber-
ately inducing the physical sensations the patient fears 
are  indicative  of  a  panic  attack. These  exposure  tech-
niques are similar in their function because they allow 
the patient to acquire new learning in order to modify 
the  fear  structure.  In  general,  exposure  therapy  is  of 
limited duration and is typically completed in about 10 
sessions.

Efficacy/effectiveness of exposure 
for anxiety disorders

Exposure  therapies  for  each  anxiety  disorder  tend  to 
take on similar forms, with differences emerging most 
often in the emphasis on the content of exposure, which 
is  specific  to  the  patient’s  presenting  concerns.  Expo-
sure therapies also differ in their relative emphasis on 
the  different  exposure  techniques  (in  vivo,  imaginal, 
and/or interoceptive). The efficacy and effectiveness of 
exposure therapy has been well documented for anxiety 
disorders, and exposure therapy is considered the treat-
ment of choice for many forms of pathological anxiety. 

Post-traumatic stress disorder

PTSD is often treated with prolonged exposure thera-
py (PE) which incorporates both imaginal and in vivo 
exposures.11 PE involves having the patient repeatedly 
revisit  the  trauma  memory  by  visualizing  the  trauma 
events in their imagination while recounting the events 
aloud in session with the therapist. The revisiting is fol-
lowed  by  processing  and  digesting  the  content  of  the 
imaginal exposure with the goal of acquiring new per-
spectives about oneself, others, and the world, and shift-
ing negative perceptions into positive or neutral ones. 
The narrative during imaginal exposure is recorded and 
patients continue to receive exposure between sessions 
by  listening  to  the  recording,  which  further  provides 
opportunities  for  processing  the  traumatic  memory. 
PTSD  patients  are  also  asked  to  use  in  vivo  exercises 
as  homework,  typically  involving  gradual  exposure  to 
safe  activities,  objects,  or  places  that  were  previously 
avoided.  Other  forms  of  psychotherapy  for  PTSD  in-
corporate some elements of exposure. For example, the 
original  cognitive  processing  therapy  protocol  (CPT) 
has patients process their trauma by writing a detailed 
account of the event and reading it aloud.12 
  A  meta-analysis  of  prolonged  exposure  therapy 
studies revealed that PE resulted in significant improve-
ments in PTSD symptoms and secondary outcome mea-
sures  at  both  post-treatment  and  follow-up  compared 
with  control  conditions.13  However,  this  study  also 
found that PE was not significantly different compared 
with  cognitive  processing  therapy  (CPT),  eye-move-
ment desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), cogni-
tive therapy (CT), and stress inoculation training (SIT), 
which the authors suggest may be due to different but 

equally  efficacious  therapeutic  mechanisms  or  due  to 
the  common  implementation  of  exposure  techniques 
in each of the comparison treatments. Conversely, oth-
ers have found that PE resulted in better outcomes in 
terms of symptom reduction, rate of improvement, and 
proportion of participants no longer meeting criteria for 
PTSD compared with relaxation training and EMDR.14 
Regarding treatment combination, several studies have 
found that the addition of cognitive therapy to PE did 
not yield superior outcomes,15-17 whereas the addition of 
exposure techniques to cognitive therapy enhanced the 
outcome of the latter.16 

Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Exposure  and  response  prevention  (EX/RP)  therapy 
for individuals with OCD also uses both imaginal and 
in  vivo  exposure.18  In  vivo  exposures  are  completed 
both in the therapy session with the encouragement of 
the therapist and outside the session as homework (eg, 
touching faucets in a public restroom while engaging in 
washing  behavior  without  performing  the  compulsive 
ritual;  washing  with  the  goal  of  disconfirming  the  ex-
pected  harm  of  getting  ill).  Refraining  from  engaging 
in  compulsive  behaviors  (response  prevention)  is  an 
important  aspect  of  the  treatment  since  compulsions 
function as safety behaviors that preserve the associa-
tion between obsessions and the feared consequences. 
For situations where it would be difficult or impossible 
to conduct an in vivo exposure (eg, fear of the conse-
quences of contracting HIV), imaginal exposure is used 
with the same goal of exposing the patient to the feared 
imagined  situation  and  letting  anxiety  decrease  on  its 
own without relying on compulsions. The imaginal ex-
posure  thereby  disconfirms  the  patient’s  expectation 
that  thinking  about  the  obsessional  thought  and  not 
engaging in a compulsion would lead to the anticipated 
harm.
  A meta-analysis showed that EX/RP resulted in su-
perior outcomes compared with placebo and/or waiting 
list.19 Exposure therapy was also found to be superior in 
comparison with progressive muscle relaxation in OCD 
patients.20 However, EX/RP has also shown similar effect 
estimates  when  compared  with  cognitive  restructuring 
alone and EX/RP with cognitive restructuring.19 A more 
recent meta-analysis also found no differences between 
cognitive therapy alone and EX/RP in OCD treatment 
outcomes.21  However,  these  results  were  based  on  the 

339

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

comparison  of  a  substantial  number  of  EX/RP  stud-
ies, with only three studies examining cognitive therapy 
alone.  An  additional  complication  arises  in  that  many 
cognitive  therapy  studies  on  OCD  include  exposures, 
often  called  behavioral  experiments,  in  their  treatment 
protocol. There is also evidence that the characteristics 
of the exposure treatment are important. A meta-anal-
ysis on variants of EX/RP found that exposure therapy 
for OCD was most effective when it involved therapist-
guided exposure rather than self-guided exposure, when 
requiring  complete  response  prevention  as  opposed  to 
partial or no response prevention, and when in vivo and 
imaginal exposure were combined as compared with us-
ing in vivo exposure alone.22

Panic disorder

As mentioned previously, a hallmark of exposure ther-
apy for panic disorder involves interoceptive exposure 
(eg,  increasing  heart  rate  by  running  or  hyperventi-
lating)  which  is  aimed  at  disconfirming  the  idea  that 
physical sensations will lead to harmful events such as a 
heart attack or embarrassing oneself in public. A meta-
analysis of studies on panic disorder showed that CBT, 
which primarily consisted of exposure therapy with or 
without cognitive therapy components, performed bet-
ter  than  no  treatment  or  a  placebo  control.23  In  addi-
tion, another study found that CBT with interoceptive 
exposure treatment yielded the largest effect sizes for 
panic  disorder  patients;  however,  these  interventions 
also included cognitive restructuring in addition to ex-
posure.24 Although interoceptive exposure is commonly 
used  with  panic  disorder,  there  is  less  support  for  the 
usefulness  of  supplementing  interoceptive  exposure 
with in vivo exposure in the treatment of panic disorder 
at this time.25 

Generalized anxiety disorder

has  shown  that  CBT  including  imaginal  exposure  re-
sulted  in  greater  functioning  in  GAD  patients  after  a 
12-month follow-up compared with applied relaxation 
and nondirective therapy.27 A more recent study com-
paring cognitive therapy, applied relaxation with a form 
of imaginal exposure (self-control desensitization), and 
the  combination  of  these  treatments  found  no  differ-
ences  between  them  in  terms  of  outcomes  in  treating 
GAD patients.28 Additional research is needed on the 
effectiveness of exposure therapy in treating GAD.

Social anxiety disorder

In  vivo  exposure  is  commonly  used  for  social  anxiety 
disorder  (eg,  participating  in  social  situations  without 
using  avoidance  or  safety  behaviors).  According  to 
Rapee  and  Heimberg’s  CBT  model  of  anxiety,  those 
with social anxiety show distortions and biases in how 
they process social/evaluative information which leads 
to increases in anxiety.29 Avoidance of social situations 
in  turn  maintains  this  anxiety  and  exposure  to  social 
situations  can  be  used  to  provide  disconfirming  evi-
dence  regarding  cognitive  distortions  related  to  social 
expectations. Exposure with or without cognitive ther-
apy  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  reducing  social 
anxiety symptoms.30-32 More recent research found that 
exposure therapy with applied relaxation and cognitive 
therapy both resulted in better outcomes than wait-list 
control  in  treating  social  anxiety  disorder  patients.33 
However, compared with each other in the same study, 
cognitive therapy performed better than exposure plus 
applied  relaxation.  In  addition,  meta-analytic  results 
demonstrated that both cognitive and exposure thera-
py performed better than applied relaxation or waitlist 
control in treating social anxiety disorder patients.34,35

Specific phobias

GAD  treatment  can  include  both  imaginal  exposure 
(eg, imagining the worst-case scenario associated with 
their  worries)  and  less  frequently,  in  vivo  exposures. 
For  example,  a  GAD  treatment  protocol  by  Craske 
and  Barlow  has  patients  engage  in  self-guided  expo-
sures  where  patients  repeatedly  recount  their  worries 
using imaginal exposure to reduce the intensity of the 
worry.26 There  are  relatively  few  studies  that  examine 
exposure-based  treatment  in  GAD  patients.  Research 

In vivo exposure is considered the treatment of choice 
for specific phobia. In vivo exposure may involve flood-
ing  (exposure  to  the  most  intense  feared  stimulus)  or 
gradual exposure (systematic exposure of gradually in-
creasing intensity). Meta-analytical studies have shown 
that  in  vivo  exposure  therapy  is  highly  effective  for 
specific phobias compared with no treatment, placebo 
treatment, and non-exposure-based active therapy con-
ditions.36 Although relaxation was shown to have some 
benefit for those with specific phobia, it was not found 

340

CBT for anxiety disorders - Kaczkurkin and Foa 

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 17 . No. 3 . 2015

to  be  more  effective  than  exposure.36  In  addition,  one 
study compared patients receiving a single 3-hour ses-
sion of exposure, five sessions of exposure, or five ses-
sions  of  cognitive  therapy  and  found  that  all  three 
treatments  performed  better  than  the  waitlist  control 
condition; however, no differences were found between 
the exposure and cognitive therapies.37

Cognitive therapy

Cognitive  therapy  is  another  widely  used  method  for 
treating  anxiety  disorders.  Cognitive  therapy  is  based 
on  Beck’s  tri-part  model  of  emotion  which  proposes 
that  thoughts,  feelings,  and  behaviors  are  interrelat-
ed.  According  to  this  theory,  changing  maladaptive 
thoughts is proposed to alter the patient’s maladaptive 
affect and behavior. Cognitive therapy targets distort-
ed thoughts using a number of techniques such as iden-
tifying  inaccurate  thinking,  examining  the  evidence 
for  and  against  automatic  thoughts,  challenging  and 
changing  maladaptive  thoughts,  altering  problematic 
behaviors, and relating to other people in more adap-
tive ways. Psychoeducation about the tri-part model of 
emotion, the different forms of distorted thinking (eg, 
all-or-nothing  thinking,  jumping  to  conclusions,  dis-
qualifying  the  positive,  etc),  and  cognitive  restructur-
ing is an integral part of cognitive therapy. Homework 
is  typically  assigned  to  give  patients  opportunities  to 
practice  these  skills  in  their  daily  life,  allowing  them 
to gain mastery of the techniques so they will be able 
to  apply  what  they  have  learned  after  treatment  has 
ended. In treating anxiety disorders, cognitive therapy 
is most often used in conjunction with behavioral tech-
niques,  which  may  include  exposure  exercises.  Cogni-
tive  therapy  is  typically  time-limited  to  about  20  ses-
sions or less, and is problem-focused on the issues the 
patient identifies as of primary concern. 

Efficacy/effectiveness of cognitive therapy 
for anxiety disorders

The  use  of  cognitive  techniques  in  treating  anxiety 
disorders  is  widely  implemented. Yet  the  research  on 
the  efficacy  and  effectiveness  of  cognitive  techniques 
alone for anxiety disorders has shown variable results. 
For  example,  a  study  comparing  transdiagnostic  CBT 
therapy  with  relaxation  training  in  anxiety  disorder 
patients  found  both  treatments  to  be  equally  benefi-

cial,  although  relaxation  training  was  associated  with 
a  higher  dropout  rate.38  The  results  regarding  the  ef-
ficacy  and  effectiveness  of  cognitive  therapy  for  anxi-
ety  disorders  are  also  limited  by  the  small  number  of 
studies examining cognitive methods in isolation from 
exposure. Many of the treatment protocols investigated 
in  treatment  outcome  studies  combine  both  exposure 
and  cognitive  therapy  techniques,  making  conclusions 
about  the  relative  contributions  of  each  method  diffi-
cult to disentangle.

Post-traumatic stress disorder

Several  cognitive  therapy  techniques  have  been  pro-
posed  for  treating  PTSD.  For  example,  cognitive  pro-
cessing therapy (CPT) for PTSD postulates that erro-
neous beliefs about the causes and consequences of the 
traumatic event prevent the patient from processing the 
emotions  surrounding  the  trauma  memory.12  In  CPT, 
the  therapist  helps  the  patient  to  identify  their “stuck 
points,” learn new ways to handle distressing thoughts, 
and gain a better understanding of the changes in be-
liefs  that  occur  after  experiencing  a  traumatic  event. 
CPT  begins  with  the  therapist  providing  psychoedu-
cation about PTSD symptoms and a rationale for this 
treatment. Patients are asked to write an “impact state-
ment”  or  a  one-page  description  of  why  the  patient 
thinks the traumatic event happened to them and how 
the event has changed their view of themselves and the 
world. The impact statement is used to begin identify-
ing  the  patient’s  stuck  points  or  cognitive  distortions 
about  the  event  (eg, “I  am  a  weak  person”).  Patients 
then learn to identify their thoughts and feelings with 
the goal of understanding the interconnected relation-
ship between them. Next, two sessions of treatment in-
volve having the patient write down the details of the 
worst traumatic incident, which are then read aloud to 
the  therapist. The  majority  of  the  subsequent  sessions 
are  used  to  challenge  the  patient’s  stuck  points  using 
Socratic questioning (gently challenging the accuracy of 
the patient’s thoughts to draw out alternative and more 
balanced  ways  of  thinking).  Patients  are  also  taught 
cognitive-behavioral skills, and treatment may focus on 
specific problematic areas for the patient such as trust, 
self-esteem,  and  power/control.  Other  forms  of  cogni-
tive therapy for PTSD may include imaginal and in vivo 
exposures  (cognitive  therapy  for  PTSD)39  or  may  not 
include any exposure exercises.40

341

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

Research  has  shown  that  CPT  is  effective  in  reducing 
PTSD symptoms in both veterans and nonveterans.41-45 
For example, Resick and colleagues found that CPT led 
to greater improvements in PTSD symptoms compared 
with a minimal attention control group.46 CPT was also 
found in the same study to be equally beneficial com-
pared  with  prolonged  exposure  therapy.  Furthermore, 
cognitive therapy (CT) for PTSD has also been shown 
to  be  more  effective  than  wait-list,  self-monitoring,  or 
self-help booklet control groups.39,47 However, as men-
tioned previously, CPT and CT for PTSD are not exclu-
sively  cognitive  therapies  since  they  both  incorporate 
variations  of  exposure  exercises  as  well.  Other  stud-
ies have found similar outcomes for cognitive therapy 
alone compared with imaginal exposure.40 

Obsessive-compulsive disorder

EX/RP,  also  a  primarily  exposure-based  therapy,  inte-
grates  cognitive  processing  following  or  during  expo-
sure to allow OCD patients to gain insights regarding 
their  feared  consequences.18  However,  EX/RP  does 
not  mandate  the  use  of  any  specific  cognitive  tech-
niques.  Cognitive  therapy  protocols  for  OCD  often 
involve identifying and altering distorted cognitive be-
liefs  about  the  significance  of  intrusive  thoughts  (eg, 
intrusive  thoughts  mean  the  patient  is  a  bad  person). 
For  example,  a  cognitive  therapy  protocol  tested  by 
McLean  and  colleagues  begins  with  psychoeducation 
about OCD symptoms and an introduction to the treat-
ment rationale.48 Patients are then engaged in a discus-
sion  about  the  relationship  between  triggers  that  lead 
to intrusive thoughts and the patient’s faulty appraisals 
of  these  thoughts  which  leads  to  anxiety  and  urges  to 
perform compulsions. Patients are then taught to recog-
nize the different types of distorted appraisals including 
overimportance of thoughts, overestimation of danger, 
inflation of responsibility, overestimation of the conse-
quences of danger, overestimation of the consequences 
of responsibility, and need for certainty-control-perfec-
tionism.48 Patients then began challenging these faulty 
appraisals by conducting behavioral experiments to test 
the evidence for and against their beliefs.
  As mentioned previously, a meta-analytic investiga-
tion  of  treatment  outcomes  in  OCD  patients  did  not 
find any significant differences between cognitive ther-
apy alone and EX/RP, but only a relatively small num-
ber of studies have examined cognitive therapy alone in 

OCD.19,21 Furthermore, as can be seen in the description 
of  the  McLean  et  al  treatment  procedures  described 
previously, many cognitive therapy protocols for OCD 
incorporate  behavioral  experiments.  During  these  be-
havioral  experiments,  patients  confront  their  feared 
stimuli/beliefs, which causes the patient to engage in a 
form of exposure. Therefore, it is difficult to determine 
the  relative  contributions  of  the  cognitive  aspects  of 
these treatments from these behavioral experiments. In 
spite of this, research has shown that group EX/RP for 
OCD patients is associated with better outcomes than 
group cognitive therapy with a behavioral experiment 
component.48  Due  to  the  relatively  few  studies  that 
investigate  the  usefulness  of  cognitive  therapy  alone 
(without a behavioral component), it is difficult to draw 
conclusions  about  the  relative  effectiveness  of  cogni-
tive therapy compared to exposure in the treatment of 
OCD. 

Panic disorder

Interoceptive exposure for panic disorder is often com-
bined with cognitive skills such as learning that physi-
cal  sensations  are  not  necessarily  always  harmful  and 
learning  to  reappraise  the  meaning  of  physical  symp-
toms  instead  of  catastrophizing.49  A  meta-analysis  on 
panic disorder did not find a difference in effectiveness 
whether cognitive therapy techniques were included or 
not with exposure-based therapy, but the author did find 
improved results with the addition of cognitive compo-
nents in patients with comorbid depressive symptoms.23 
Furthermore,  another  study  found  that  applied  relax-
ation,  exposure,  and  cognitive  therapy  were  all  about 
equally effective in treating patients with panic disorder 
with agoraphobia.50

Generalized anxiety disorder

GAD  treatment  also  involves  a  significant  cognitive 
aspect  such  as  using  cognitive  techniques  to  reduce 
excessive worrying. For example, Craske and Barlow’s 
GAD  treatment  manual  teaches  patients  to  learn  to 
change  patterns  of  thinking  that  lead  to  anxiety,  chal-
lenge thoughts that overestimate risk, and identify and 
change  catastrophic  thinking.26  Cognitive  therapy  has 
been  shown  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  GAD 
patients. The  results  of  a  meta-analysis  suggested  that 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy  showed  better  long-term 

342

outcomes  than  applied  relaxation  in  GAD  patients.51 
Additionally, although Dugas and colleagues found that 
CBT treatment which included both cognitive therapy 
and exposure was generally comparable to relaxation in 
treating GAD, the authors noted that when compared 
with a waitlist control group, cognitive therapy plus ex-
posure  was  superior  to  applied  relaxation.52 These  re-
sults are limited by the combination of both cognitive 
and exposure techniques in the CBT group. Conversely, 
other research suggests that relaxation is equally effec-
tive as cognitive therapy in terms of symptom improve-
ment  in  patients  with  GAD  at  post-treatment  and  at 
follow-up.53,54 

Social anxiety disorder

Cognitive techniques are routinely used in treating so-
cial  anxiety  disorder  to  help  the  patient  identify  and 
change  cognitive  factors  that  maintain  social  anxiety. 
For  example,  in  Hofmann’s  model  of  social  anxiety, 
patients learn that social anxiety is maintained in part 
by  holding  negative  perceptions  about  oneself,  over-
estimating  the  cost  of  a  social  mishap,  perceiving  that 
one  has  little  control  over  one’s  emotional  responses, 
and  believing  that  one’s  social  skills  are  inadequate.55 
In terms of effectiveness, a meta-analysis found individ-
ual CBT to be effective in treating social anxiety com-
pared  with  a  waitlist  control.35  Additionally,  another 
meta-analysis of treatments for social anxiety disorder 
including  exposure,  cognitive  restructuring,  and  expo-
sure  plus  cognitive  restructuring  found  no  differences 
in outcomes between these treatments suggesting equal 
effectiveness for cognitive therapy only interventions.34

Specific phobia

Although exposure therapy is considered the most ef-
fective  therapy  for  specific  phobias,  exposure  can  be 
supplemented with cognitive restructuring strategies as 
well. For instance, treatment protocols for specific pho-
bia may involve helping the patient identify unrealistic 
expectations and replace them with more accurate pre-
dictions  and  interpretations.56  Research  on  the  effec-
tivness  of  cognitive  therapy  for  specific  phobia  shows 
mixed  results.  For  example,  one  study  found  that  one 
session of cognitive therapy was equally effective as one 
session of exposure therapy for small animal phobia; in 
addition, cognitive therapy was viewed by participants 

as less intrusive in this study.57 However, meta-analytic 
results regarding the augmentation of exposure thera-
py  with  cognitive  techniques  for  patients  with  specific 
phobias did not show a benefit for combined treatment 
compared  to  exposure  alone,36  supporting  the  general 
recommendation of exposure therapy as the first line of 
treatment for specific phobias. 

Discussion

The results of this review demonstrate the efficacy and 
effectiveness  of  using  CBT  methods  to  treat  anxiety 
disorders  as  well  as  revealing  areas  in  need  of  addi-
tional  research.  Exposure  and  cognitive  methods  rep-
resent  the  most  frequently  implemented  and  widely 
studied CBT techniques. Exposure methods in particu-
lar  are  often  thought  of  as  the  first  line  of  treatment 
for many anxiety disorders. The effectiveness of expo-
sure remains relatively unchallenged for some anxiety 
disorders such as specific phobias and OCD. However, 
despite research showing the superior benefits of expo-
sure  techniques  compared  with  no  treatment,  the  col-
lective research has not consistently shown that expo-
sure  techniques  are  significantly  better  than  cognitive 
therapy. For example, we previously discussed the find-
ing by Powers and colleagues that PE was not found to 
be  significantly  different  than  eye-movement  desensi-
tization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR),  cognitive  therapy 
(CT), or stress inoculation training (SIT).13 Additional-
ly, although EX/RP for OCD showed large effect sizes 
compared  with  control  conditions  and  showed  better 
results than cognitive therapy in several individual stud-
ies, two separate meta-analytic studies found EX/RP to 
be similar to cognitive therapy.19,21 However, the meta-
analyses on OCD treatment were based on only three 
studies analyzing cognitive therapy alone. Additionally, 
many  cognitive  treatments  for  OCD  incorporate  be-
havioral experiments, a form of exposure. There are a 
disproportionately larger number of studies investigat-
ing exposure therapy than cognitive treatments in OCD 
patients,  suggesting  that  further  research  is  needed  in 
this area before conclusions can be drawn about the ef-
fectiveness of cognitive therapy for OCD.
  Complexities  arise  in  attempting  to  disentangle 
these results due to the frequent overlap in techniques 
used  in  many  of  these  therapies.  For  example,  PE  for 
PTSD patients is primarily based on exposure but also 
includes processing of the imaginal exposure where the 

343

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

patient discusses their perceptions and feelings associ-
ated  with  the  traumatic  memory,  introducing  a  cogni-
tive element to the treatment (although no formal cog-
nitive techniques are used). Likewise, although CPT for 
PTSD focuses on the cognitive beliefs about the causes 
and consequences related to the trauma, a component 
of CPT involves writing a detailed account of the trau-
matic event and reading it to the therapist, thereby en-
gaging the patient in exposure in addition to cognitive 
therapy. The overlap in techniques between CBT thera-
pies may explain why different active therapies do not 
necessarily result in superior outcomes. If exposure and 
cognitive therapies tap into separate but equally effica-
cious therapeutic mechanisms, then the combination of 
therapies  might  be  expected  to  show  superior  results. 
Yet,  for  example,  dismantling  studies  typically  find  no 
difference between PE therapy alone and combined PE 
plus  cognitive  restructuring,  suggesting  that  PE  is  not 
enhanced  by  the  addition  of  cognitive  therapy.15,16 An 
additional consideration is that there are a larger num-
ber  of  exposure  therapy  studies  and  relatively  fewer 
studies of cognitive therapy alone without an exposure 
component.  Additional  studies  examining  cognitive 
therapy alone are needed to adequately compare expo-
sure and cognitive techniques. 

In  summary,  the  research  on  CBT  in  anxiety  dis-
orders supports the efficacy and effectiveness of these 
methods, with most of the current research demonstrat-
ing the usefulness of providing exposure therapy in the 
treatment of anxiety disorders. However, these results 
may change as additional research is conducted on cog-
nitive  therapy  alone  and  cognitive  therapy  combined 

with exposure. In terms of future directions, it is appar-
ent from this review that additional studies are needed 
that can dismantle effective treatments for anxiety dis-
orders to determine which specific components are re-
sponsible for beneficial outcomes. At the same time, the 
repeated  finding  of  equal  or  near-equal  effectiveness 
across CBT therapies suggests that the commonalities 
underlying  these  treatments  may  be  more  important 
than  any  specific  differences  between  the  techniques. 
Studies aimed at identifying these commonalities have 
been sparse, and represent an important but relatively 
underdeveloped  area  of  clinical  treatment  research. 
In  addition  to  determining  what  treatments  work,  it 
is  equally  important  to  understand  which  patients  are 
most likely to benefit from a given treatment or from 
given components. Studies aimed at identifying predic-
tors of beneficial treatment outcome are invaluable in 
determining  what  factors  and  patient  characteristics 
are  most  likely  to  lead  to  improvements.  Lastly,  there 
is  an  increasing  interest  in  transdiagnostic  CBT  tech-
niques that transcend specific diagnoses in acknowledg-
ment  of  the  fact  that  anxiety  disorders  are  frequently 
comorbid with each other and with other disorders like 
depression and in recognition of the significant overlap 
in symptoms between anxiety disorders. Research sup-
ports  the  notion  that  anxiety  disorder  patients  share 
common  psychological  and  biological  vulnerabilities, 
suggesting that effective treatments for anxiety are tap-
ping into these shared mechanisms. Future directions in 
treatment research would benefit from a better under-
standing of the common mechanisms underlying effec-
tive CBT treatments.   o

Terapia cognitivo conductual para los trastornos 
de ansiedad: una puesta al día de la evidencia 
empírica

Thérapie cognitivo-comportementale dans les 
troubles anxieux : une mise à jour des données 
empiriques

Se  ha  acumulado  una  gran  cantidad  de  investigación 
acerca  de  la  eficacia  y  efectividad  de  la  terapia  cogni-
tivo  conductual  (TCC)  para  los  trastornos  de  ansiedad, 
los que incluyen el trastorno por estrés postraumático, 
el trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, el trastorno de páni-
co, el trastorno de ansiedad generalizada, el trastorno 
de ansiedad social y las fobias específicas. El propósito 
de  este  artículo  es  entregar  una  panorámica  sobre  los 
dos métodos de TCC más comúnmente empleados para 
tratar  los  trastornos  de  ansiedad  (exposición  y  terapia 
cognitiva), y resumir y discutir la investigación empírica 
actual con respecto a la utilidad de estas técnicas para 
cada uno de estos trastornos. Además se discuten las di-
ficultades que surgen al comparar tratamientos activos 
de TCC y se sugieren directrices para la investigación fu-
tura. En forma global la TCC parece ser eficaz y efectiva 
en el tratamiento de los trastornos de ansiedad, pero se 
requieren  estudios  desagregados  para  determinar  qué 
componentes  específicos  del  tratamiento  conducen  a 
resultados beneficiosos y qué pacientes tienen más pro-
babilidades  de  beneficiarse  de  estos  componentes  del 
tratamiento.  

L’efficacité et l’efficience des thérapies cognitivo-com-
portementales (TCC) dans le trouble anxieux, dont le 
trouble  stress  post-traumatique,  les  trouble  obses-
sionnel compulsif, le trouble panique, l’anxiété géné-
ralisée,  l’anxiété  sociale  et  les  phobies  spécifiques, 
ont  fait  l’objet  de  beaucoup  de  recherches.  L’objec-
tif  de  cet  article  est  de  donner  un  aperçu  des  deux 
TCC les plus couramment utilisées dans le traitement 
des troubles anxieux (thérapie cognitive et technique 
d’exposition) et de résumer et d’analyser la recherche 
empirique actuelle basée sur l’utilité de ces techniques 
pour chaque trouble anxieux. De plus, nous analysons 
les  difficultés  inhérentes  à  la  comparaison  entre  des 
TCC  actives  et  proposons  des  axes  de  recherche  fu-
ture. Globalement, les TCC semblent à la fois efficaces 
et efficientes dans le traitement des troubles anxieux 
mais  des  études  détaillées  sont  nécessaires  afin  de 
déterminer quels éléments spécifiques du traitement 
donnent  de  bons  résultats  et  quels  patients  sont  le 
plus susceptibles d’en bénéficier.
