Abstract
Sleep disorders and nightmares are core symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The relationship seems to 
be  bidirectional,  and  persistent  disturbed  sleep  may  influ-
ence the course of the disorder. With regard to sleep quality, 
insomnia and nocturnal anxiety symptoms, as well as night-
mares and stressful dreams, are the most prominent sleep 
symptoms. Polysomnographic measurements reveal altera-
tions  of  the  sleep  architecture  and  fragmentation  of  rapid 
eye  movement  sleep.  In  addition,  sleep  disorders,  such  as 
sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias are fre-
quent  comorbid  conditions.  The  complex  etiology  and 
symptomatology of trauma-related sleep disorders with fre-
quent  psychiatric  comorbidity  require  the  application  of 
multimodal  treatment  concepts,  including  psychological 
and pharmacological interventions. However, there is little 
empirical evidence on the effectiveness of long-term drug 
treatment for insomnia and nightmares. For nondrug inter-

ventions,  challenges  arise  from  the  current  lack  of  PTSD-
treatment concepts integrating sleep- and trauma-focused 
therapies. Effective therapy for sleep disturbances may con-
sequently also improve well-being during the day and prob-
ably even the course of PTSD. Whether early sleep interven-
tions exert a preventive effect on the development of PTSD 
remains to be clarified in future studies.

Introduction

For  more  than  3  decades,  sleep  disorders  have  been 
classified  among  the  core  symptoms  of  post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) [1]. According to the DSM-5 cri-
teria,  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  requires  exposure  to  a  trau-
matic event of catastrophic intensity or an extraordinary 
threat [2]. In addition, the symptomatology of PTSD is 
conceptualized within the framework of 4 symptom clus-
ters,  with  nightmares  being  classified  as  an  “intrusion 
symptom” and insomnia as an “alteration in arousal and 
reactivity.” Typically, symptoms occur with a latency of 
several  weeks  to  months  after  the  trauma.  The  present 
review provides an updated overview of the characteris-

tics of sleep disorders related to PTSD and traumatiza-
tion, including an overview of psychological and pharma-
cological  interventions.  Moreover,  it  highlights  the  sig-
nificance  of  sleep  disorders  as  important  therapeutic 
target symptoms and also as risk and prognostic factors 
of PTSD.

Bidirectional Relationship

Studies in recent years have expanded upon the clas-
sic model of PTSD; namely in considering sleep disor-
ders as symptoms of PTSD insofar as sleep seems to be 
of  major  importance  regarding  the  development  and 
course of the disorder. This relationship between PTSD 
and sleep disorders is suggested to be bidirectional [3]. 
It has also been shown that pretraumatically disturbed 
sleep  may  be  a  risk  factor  for  later  developing  PTSD 
[4–7]. In addition, insomnia symptoms that occur im-
mediately after a trauma may be predictive for PTSD [8, 
9]. Pronounced sleep disturbances in PTSD also repre-
sent an important prognostic factor for the outcome, as 
they  may  increase  the  severity  of  the  condition  and 
thus, significantly impair quality of life and daily func-
tioning  [10],  in  addition  to  increasing  risk  of  alcohol 
and drug misuse [11]. Disturbed sleep may also persist 
despite  the  improvement  of  other  PTSD  symptoms 
[12–14], which may promote the maintenance of PTSD 
over the course of the disorder [15, 16]. Conversely, ef-
fective  treatment  of  sleep  disorders  and  nightmares 
may  lead  to  a  clinically  significant  decrease  in  PTSD 
symptoms during the day [17–19]. A recent study re-
ported  that  in  individuals  with  PTSD,  sleep  duration, 
trouble falling asleep, and difficulties staying asleep the 
prior  night  predict  PTSD  symptom  severity  the  next 
day [20]. Accordingly, interventions that enable people 
to sleep better are likely to be of particular therapeutic 
importance, as they may have an immediate remedial 
effect on PTSD symptoms.

Subjective Sleep

Current epidemiological studies suggest that over 90% 
of patients with PTSD suffer from clinically relevant sleep 
disorders [21]. In particular, difficulties falling and stay-
ing  asleep  as  well  as  post-traumatic  nightmares  lead  to 
irritability and exhaustion during the day and can impair 
emotional processing [22]. In addition, fear of the dark, 
lying awake at night ruminating about the trauma [23], 

talking or screaming during sleep, and waking up disori-
entated may also frequently occur [3].

Insomnia
Insomnia  symptoms,  that  is,  difficulty  initiating  or 
maintaining sleep is reported in 35–61% of patients with 
PTSD;  various  factors  such  as  comorbidities,  different 
criteria for insomnia diagnosis across classification sys-
tems, or trauma type may influence the broad range of 
prevalence estimates [24]. PTSD often leads to acute in-
somnia with behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Perpet-
uating factors (e.g., poor sleep hygiene) and a state of hy-
perarousal may contribute to the maintenance and exac-
erbation of insomnia [24]. Fear of sleep is thought to play 
an important role in the development and maintenance 
of  trauma-associated  insomnia  in  the  context  of  PTSD 
and sleep disturbances [25]. According to a recent model 
by Werner et al. [25], PTSD symptoms such as negative 
beliefs about safety and loss of control or re-experiencing 
the  trauma  (including  nightmares)  increase  the  fear  of 
sleep. The hyperarousal symptoms, including insomniac 
complaints, in turn favor the emergence of insomnia-re-
lated maladaptive processes and therefore, contribute to 
the maintenance of insomnia. Avoidance behavior is like-
ly  to  contribute  to  the  maladaptive  processes  of  both 
pathways and thus, has an equally reinforcing influence 
[25]. Treatment of fear of sleep could be integrated into 
both trauma-focused and sleep-focused approaches [25]. 
It remains unclear whether treatment-resistant insomnia 
[12–14] may also be due to lack of adequate consideration 
of fear of sleep.

Post-Traumatic Nightmares
Frightening post-traumatic nightmares occur in up to 
67% of patients with PTSD [26] and may have a signifi-
cant effect on the emotional state the following day. The 
spectrum of post-traumatic dreams ranges from trauma-
related dreams to nightmares in which the trauma is re-
experienced [27]. The different subtypes are summarized 
in Table 1.

While nightmares without a traumatic cause typically 
occur in the second half of the night and are associated 
with longer rapid eye movement (REM) episodes, night-
mares  in  PTSD  can  occur  during  both  REM  and  non-
REM sleep [28]. Physiological changes, such as increases 
or fluctuations in heart and respiratory rate, can lead to 
awakening if significantly pronounced, and these events 
are  often  associated  with  nightmare  awakenings.  Typi-
cally, affected patients are fully oriented quickly despite 
marked anxiety symptoms.

Polysomnographic Findings

Although video polysomnography (PSG) is not a stan-
dard diagnostic tool for PTSD-associated sleep disorders, it 
may  be  indicated  for  the  diagnosis  of  comorbid-specific 
sleep  disorders,  such  as  sleep-related  breathing  disorders 
(SRBD) or parasomnia (e.g., a behavioral disorder in REM 
sleep) [29]. Compared to healthy controls, sleep studies in 
patients with PTSD show partially heterogeneous results in 
overall sleep continuity and sleep architecture depending 
on the time of the examination (acute vs. chronic PTSD), 
psychiatric  comorbidities  (especially  major  depression), 
and  age.  With  respect  to  non-REM  sleep,  an  increase  in 
light sleep (stage 1) and a decrease in slow-wave sleep (SWS) 
may be found (overview in [30, 31]). More consistent al-
terations, however, are observed in REM sleep, character-
ized by a fragmentation with a higher number of transitions 
from REM sleep to stage 1 or awake state [32]. In addition, 
an increased REM sleep pressure – a shortening of REM 
latency (time between falling asleep and the first REM epi-
sode)  and  a  higher  REM  density  (number  of  rapid  eye 
movements) – has been reported [30, 32].

The current body of research suggests that individuals 
with  PTSD  typically  exhibit  low  parasympathetic  tone 
during  awake-resting  states,  resulting  in  an  elevated 
mean  heart  rate  (HR)  and  reduced  cardiac  reactivity. 
During sleep, however, increased sympathetic activation 
characteristically  occurs  in  PTSD  patients  and  is  ob-
served  primarily  during  REM  sleep,  resulting  in  in-
creased  HR  and  decreased  reactivity  [33].  One  older 
study  demonstrated  that  altered  nocturnal  heart  rate 
variability (HRV) was predictive of the development of 
PTSD in traumatized patients [34]. This relationship was 
confirmed in further studies and is now considered es-
tablished [33]. In addition, a study has shown that pre-
traumatic pathological HRV increases the risk of devel-
oping PTSD after trauma [35]. One study showed that 
elevated autonomic nervous system arousal indexed by 
HR with PTSD might be specific to the early part of sleep 
and that PTSD is possibly associated with impairment in 

regulating autonomic nervous system activity related to 
REM sleep [36].

A promising approach for gaining insight into the un-
derlying  pathophysiological  mechanisms  of  PTSD  and 
disturbed  sleep  is  the  topographic  spectral  analysis  of 
sleep  EEG.  A  recent  study  demonstrated  alterations  in 
EEG  spectral  topologies  during  non-REM  and  REM 
sleep  that  correlated  positively  with  nightmare  activity 
and insomnia. Based on these findings, a spectral index 
was developed to differentiate between patients and con-
trols, thus serving as a candidate biomarker [37]. More-
over, a strong correlation of sleep EEG coherence mark-
ers with the diagnosis and severity of PTSD has been re-
ported  [38].  Studies  using  high-density  EEG  markers 
have demonstrated reduced sleep depth indicated by re-
duced  centro-parietal  non-REM  delta  power  and  in-
creased gamma power in the anterofrontal regions dur-
ing  both  non-REM  and  REM  sleep,  indicating  high-
arousal  levels  in  patients  with  PTSD.  These  alterations 
were replicable across consecutive nights and subpopu-
lations [39]. Similar findings were reported in a recent 
study  on  sleep  and  emotion  processing  in  pediatric 
PTSD, revealing a marked decrease in slow-wave activity 
and an increase in EEG gamma power during non-REM 
sleep in the patient group compared to healthy controls. 
In  addition,  a  correlation  between  slow-wave  activity 
power and affective habituation was most significant in 
a frontal cluster, indicating the importance of SWS for 
emotional processing in adolescence [40]. Sleep spindles 
are associated with sleep protection and sleep-dependent 
memory consolidation [41]. Recent studies demonstrat-
ed alterations in sleep spindle frequency and interchan-
nel phase differences possibly reflecting defective senso-
ry-gating  mechanisms  and  thalamocortical  circuits  in 
patients  with  PTSD  [42,  43].  It  remains  to  be  clarified 
whether these neurophysiological candidate biomarkers 
are suitable parameters for diagnosis or follow-up assess-
ments  under  treatment.  Interestingly,  a  study  of  idio-
pathic  nightmares  demonstrated  that  early  childhood 
adversity  was  associated  with  adult  nightmare  severity

and disruption in basic sleep spindle expression, suggest-
ing  pathophysiological  mechanisms  similar  to  those  of 
PTSD nightmares [44]. Blaskovich et al. [45] found an 
increased  number  of  arousals  in  individuals  with  fre-
quent  nightmares,  reflecting  hyperarousal  during  pre-
REM periods; the authors further emphasized that anal-
yses of arousals should focus specifically on state transi-
tory periods.

Sleep and Emotion Regulation

Sleep disturbances are thought to play a mechanistic 
role  in  the  emotional  memory  and  learning  model  of 
PTSD. This postulates maladaptive fear conditioning, ex-
tinction learning, extinction memory, and safety learning 
as central mechanisms of PTSD. Following a traumatic 
event, an acute stress response may lead to sleep distur-
bances that may facilitate fear learning. Efficient fear ex-
tinction results in a downscaling of the stress system. If 
these  processes  are  maladaptive,  a  trauma  may  lead  to 
PTSD. While healthy sleep promotes resilience, sleep dis-
turbances  favor  the  development  and  maintenance  of 
PTSD [22] (Fig. 1). In animal studies in mice, it has been 
shown that trauma-associated sleep disturbances were as-

sociated  with  electrophysiological  parameters  of  im-
paired  memory  acquisition,  consolidation,  and  recall 
[46], corroborating clinical findings.

Human  and  animal  sleep  studies  indicate  that  REM 
sleep plays an essential role in the processing of emotion-
al and traumatic events. It has been postulated that under 
the  special  neurochemical  conditions  of  normal  REM 
sleep  (i.e.,  low  adrenergic  activity  combined  with  high 
cholinergic  activity),  traumatic  events  are  transformed 
into  less  stressful  memory  content  (overview  in  [47]). 
This process is hypothesized to be altered in PTSD, as re-
flected by fragmented REM sleep. Accordingly, a recent 
functional MRI study showed that the amygdala respon-
siveness decreased proportionally to the duration of con-
solidated  REM  sleep,  whereas  experimentally  induced 
“restless”  REM  sleep  impaired  amygdala  adaptation  in 
healthy subjects [48]. A constellation of fragmented REM 
sleep  with  excessive  adrenergic  neurotransmission  and 
reduced activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may also 
lead to maladaptive consolidation of traumatic memory 
content [49] and promote the development of PTSD [22]. 
Acute REM sleep changes after stress exposure have also 
been  demonstrated  in  rats.  These  changes  were  signifi-
cantly correlated with impaired fear-associated memory 
processing  and  the  onset  of  PTSD-like  symptoms  [50].

Recently, it has been reported that SWS may also play a 
role in adaptive emotional processing. In a study of chil-
dren with PTSD, impairments in slow-wave activity were 
correlated with reduced affective habituation [40]. Espe-
cially in the field of emotion regulation and the neurobi-
ology of processing traumatic memory content, experi-
mental sleep research can provide new insights that aim 
at  specific  sleep  interventions  as  preventive  measures 
[51]. Animal studies have yielded mixed results; in a ro-
dent  model,  optogenetically  induced  prolongation  of 
sleep duration after trauma exposure led to a significant 
improvement  in  fear-associated  memory  processing, 
suggesting a beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms [52]. In 
contrast to these findings, prior studies in rodents pro-
vided  evidence  that  preventing  sleep  in  the  early  after-
math of trauma resulted in attenuated trauma stress re-
sponses [53, 54].

Comorbid Sleep Disorders

Apart from insomnia and nightmares, additional sleep 
disorders may frequently co-occur in patients with PTSD 
(Table 2). Factors mediating this association are largely 
unknown. Studies on the prevalence of SRBD and PTSD 
reveal highly mixed results. However, there is a concur-
rence that individuals with PTSD have a disproportion-
ately higher rate of SRBD, such as upper airway resistance 
and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) than the 
general  population  [55].  Consequently,  patients  with 
PTSD are more likely to suffer from hypertension, dyslip-
idemia,  and  diabetes.  It  is  hypothesized  that  post-trau-
matic  sleep  fragmentation  adversely  influences  the  air-
way and increases vulnerability to the subsequent devel-
opment  of  OSAS,  which  in  turn  might  worsen  PTSD 
symptoms through further sleep fragmentation [55]. Ac-
cordingly, an association between effective OSAS treat-
ment and reduced PTSD severity has been found [66, 67]. 

Untreated  OSAS  may  exacerbate  sleep-related  symp-
toms,  including  nightmares,  insomnia,  and  daytime 
sleepiness.  Interestingly,  a  recent  study  in  otherwise 
healthy patients revealed that OSAS was associated with 
a significantly lower sleep spindle density in SWS and a 
shorter spindle duration in sleep stage 2 [68]. Given the 
changes in spindle characteristics in patients with PTSD, 
these findings support further investigations in the basic 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the associa-
tion between SRBD and PTSD.

Previous  studies  have  also  reported  that  prevalence 
rates of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are higher in 
psychiatric disorders in general [69] and particularly in 
PTSD [60–64]. RBD is characterized by violent dream en-
actment behavior due to a loss of REM sleep atonia. The 
underlying pathophysiology of this disorder remains un-
clear;  however,  the  use  of  antidepressants  altered  neu-
rotransmitter  metabolism  and  intense  nightmares  may 
play a role [70]. The use of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) has been reported to be associated with 
REM sleep without atonia but not full-blown RBD [71]. 
Moreover,  there  is  evidence  that  SSRIs  can  exacerbate 
REM  sleep  without  atonia  in  psychiatric  patients  both 
with pre-existing RBD and without RBD [72]. The clini-
cal significance of RBD symptoms in PTSD is undisputed 
[73], and a recent study has shown that their occurrence 
is an indicator for the consolidation of intrusive memo-
ries [74]. RBD, OSAS, and other comorbid sleep disor-
ders,  such  as  pavor  nocturnus  and  nocturnal  panic  at-
tacks, should be included in the differential diagnosis of 
nightmares, namely because the available specific treat-
ment options may lead to a further improvement in sleep 
quality.  Periodic  limb  movement  disorder  (PLMD)  has 
also been found more frequently in patients with PTSD; 
however, the mechanism of this association remains un-
clear [60, 65]. It has repeatedly been shown that seroto-
nergic  agents,  such  as  Mirtazapine  or  SSRIs,  which  are 
also used to treat PTSD, can exacerbate or trigger PLMD 
[75,  76];  however,  systematic  studies  in  the  context  of 
PTSD are lacking.

Trauma-Associated Sleep Disorder

First described in 2014, trauma-associated sleep disor-
der (TSD) is characterized by a constellation of parasom-
nia  symptoms  and  is  thought  to  result  from  a  trauma 
without  the  presentation  or  development  of  full  PTSD 
[77].  There  is  evidence  that  the  time  of  traumatization 
(childhood vs. adolescence/adulthood) may influence the

more  likely  to  lead  to  nightmares,  whereas  childhood 
trauma is more likely to lead to acting out dreams) [78]. 
The  obligatory  diagnostic  criteria  postulated  by  Mysli-
wiec et al. [27] are summarized in Table 3.

Whether TSD is a separate pathology, remains under 
debate among experts [70, 73, 79]. Interestingly, TSD and 
RBD share some clinical features such as dream enacting 
behavior. However, the differential diagnosis of both dis-
orders is important, as treatment with clonazepam is ef-
fective in RBD but not TSD [80]. Longitudinal studies are 
necessary to clarify whether TSD is consistently associ-
ated with loss of REM sleep atonia and to determine the 
risk of transition to neurodegenerative synucleinopathies 
[79].

PTSD, Sleep, and Suicidality

Chronic severe sleep disturbances and nightmares are 
a risk factor for suicidal behavior independently of any 
other  comorbid  mental  illness  [81].  The  association  of 
sleep disturbances with increased suicidality is seen in ad-
olescents [82, 83] and the elderly [84]. Self-injurious be-
havior  has  also  been  linked  to  sleep  disturbances  [85], 
with these being thought to play a mediating role between 
PTSD  and  self-injury  [86].  A  recent  systematic  review 
concluded that both sleep disturbances, such as low sleep 
efficiency, and increased HR are associated with suicidal-
ity  [87].  Autonomic  dysfunction  (including  nocturnal 
symptoms),  such  as  altered  HR  or  HRV,  is  well  estab-
lished in the context of PTSD [33, 88]. A study of trauma-
tized individuals demonstrated that a standard index of 
autonomic activity (low-frequency/high-frequency ratios 
in the HRV index) was predictive of the extent of PTSD 
symptoms and also of suicidality [89]. On the other hand, 
PTSD is in itself a risk factor for suicidality [90, 91]. Al-
though sleep disorders and PTSD are established risk fac-

tors for suicidality and, conversely, the reciprocal influ-
ence of sleep and PTSD is well established, little is known 
about  the  complex  interplay  between  sleep,  PTSD,  and 
suicidality. A recent review of the literature revealed in-
consistent  study  results  due  to  different  patient  demo-
graphics,  target  parameters,  and  methodological  short-
comings  [92].  A  longitudinal  study  including  a  large 
number of US soldiers showed that insomnia before mil-
itary service is predictive for the development of PTSD 
and  suicidal  thoughts  after  service  [7].  However,  when 
looking at all relevant studies, the question of an increased 
risk of suicidal behavior due to sleep disorders in the con-
text  of  PTSD  cannot  be  answered  conclusively.  This 
would,  however,  be  of  importance  insofar  as  targeted 
treatment of sleep disorders and nightmares could con-
tribute to reducing the risk of suicidality in PTSD patients 
[93].

Treatment

The  primary  goal  of  sleep-  and  nightmare-focused 
therapy is an effective reduction of nocturnal symptoms, 
which may also lead to an improvement in daytime well-
being  [17–19].  Similarly,  trauma-focused  therapy  can 
also  positively  influence  sleep-related  symptoms  [94], 
and  synergistic  effects  can  be  achieved  with  regard  to 
PTSD symptoms [26]. However, there is a lack of con-
cepts in clinical practice that equally integrate day- and 
night-time symptoms into the treatment [95]. In particu-
lar,  psychiatric  comorbidities  have  to  be  taken  into  ac-
count for the development of multimodal therapy con-
cepts.

Psychotherapy
The first choice of treatment for chronic insomnia is 
disorder-specific cognitive behavioral therapy for insom-
nia (CBT-I) [96, 97], comprising treatment modules that

are also successfully used for PTSD-associated insomnia 
(Table 4) [98]. Effective techniques for the treatment of 
post-traumatic  nightmares  include  Imagery  Rehearsal 
Therapy (IRT) and Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescript-
ing  Therapy  (ERRT),  as  well  as  Exposure  Therapy  and 
Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and  Reprocessing 
(EMDR) therapy. The basic principle of IRT is a modifi-
cation of the nightmare into less stressful dream content. 
The patient replaces the traumatizing situation with new, 
positive images. The modified scenario is then practiced 
several times during the day in order to implement the 
new imaginative “script” in the dreams [99]. Meta-analy-
ses  suggest  that  IRT  is  the  most  effective  treatment  for 
post-traumatic and idiopathic nightmares [26, 100]. IRT 
via  the  Internet  seems  to  be  similarly  effective  [101]. 
ERRT combines psychoeducational elements with imag-
inatively altered nightmares [102] and may also be effec-
tive in an abbreviated form [19]. It can also be used to 
treat  residual  nightmares  after  regular  PTSD  treatment 
[103]. In addition, ERRT was also shown to reduce sui-
cidal ideation, although this effect did not remain after 
controlling for PTSD and depression [104]. Within the 
framework of exposure therapy, the traumatizing event is 
recalled in as much detail as possible under the guidance 
of  a  therapist  and  processed  step  by  step  [105].  EMDR 
therapy is characterized by bilateral sensory stimulation 
(induced  eye  movements  and  touching  of  the  hands) 
while  recalling  distressing  images;  this  stimulates  new 
processing and integration of traumatic experiences, es-
pecially on a sensory-somatic level, which can lead to a 
reduction in the intensity of nightmares [106]. There is 
also a trend to combine different treatments and to de-
velop therapies tailored to specific target groups. For ex-
ample, in a case series of patients with PTSD, the combi-
nation  of  CBT-I  and  IRT  was  shown  to  be  effective  in 
treating nightmares and insomniac symptoms [107]. In a 
pilot study, the combination of CBT-I and prolonged ex-
posure proved effective in reducing insomnia and PTSD 
[108]. Special therapy programs have been developed and 
successfully used for veterans with PTSD and depression 

who  had  residual  nightmares  and  insomnia  [109].  An-
other example in this context is Firefighter’s Therapy for 
Insomnia and Nightmares, which combines brief CBT-I 
with elements of IRT [110]. Lucid dreaming may also be 
used  [111],  but  a  reduction  of  PTSD-associated  night-
mares could not be demonstrated in a recent study [112]. 
The conclusiveness of this study, however, is limited due 
to  various  factors  (i.e.,  low  number  of  cases  and  high 
dropout rate). It is a great challenge to develop effective 
protocols for the induction of lucid dreaming, since only 
about  50%  of  all  people  have  the  basic  ability  to  lucid 
dream, and only about 20% of them dream lucidly with 
some regularity [113].

Pharmacotherapy
In clinical practice, PTSD-associated insomnia is often 
treated using sedative antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine, 
doxepin,  trimipramine,  and  amitriptyline)  or  sedative 
atypical  antipsychotics  (e.g.,  quetiapine).  However,  the 
evidence is limited, given the small number of studies and 
the potential side effects, especially when treatment over 
a longer period is required [114–117]. Z-drugs (zolpidem 
and  zopiclone)  or  benzodiazepines  may  be  used  in  the 
short-term (2–4 weeks) treatment of insomnia [96]. Due 
to their addictive potential, these drugs should  be used 
with caution, and long-term treatment should be avoid-
ed,  especially  considering  that  the  risk  of  dependency 
seems to be increased in patients with PTSD [118]. Inter-
estingly,  an  altered  benzodiazepine  receptor-binding 
profile in patients with PTSD has been reported in a func-
tional  neuroimaging  study  [119].  In  the  current  guide-
lines  of  the  American  Academy  of  Sleep  Medicine 
(AASM), single drugs are evaluated with regard to their 
efficacy and benefit-risk profile. No recommendation for 
single drugs in the treatment of insomnia is higher than 
“weak.” A “weak” recommendation represents lower cer-
tainty in the appropriateness of the treatment strategy for 
all patients, but this is not an indicator of ineffectiveness 
[120]. Among antidepressants, only doxepin and trazo-
done  are  evaluated  in  the  guidelines;  quetiapine  is  the

Drug treatment of post-traumatic nightmares is a mat-
ter of controversial discussion. In recent years, prazosin 
(α1 adrenergic receptor antagonist) has increasingly be-
come  the  focus  for  drug  treatment.  Initially,  randomly 
observed in the treatment of hypertension, the efficacy of 
prazosin on PTSD-associated nightmares has been shown 
in  several  randomized  studies  [121].  As  a  result,  the 
AASM initially recommended the use of prazosin for the 
treatment of PTSD-associated nightmares [122]. In 2018, 
however, a multicenter randomized study could not con-
firm the favorable results [123], leading to the recommen-
dation level being downgraded to “may be used” by the 
AASM [100], decision which has raised some concerns by 
other authors [124]. Recent meta-analyses revealed that 
prazosin  is  effective  in  the  treatment  of  post-traumatic 
nightmares, whereas its effects on sleep quality and PTSD 
symptoms in general are less favorable [125, 126]. Inter-
estingly, a recent study has shown that prazosin was as-
sociated  with  an  increased  risk  of  OSAS  [127],  finding 
that may help to explain why some patients do not expe-
rience an increase in their sleep quality [128]. Prazosin is 
not available in some European countries. Alternatively, 
doxazosin or terazosin (also α1-antagonists but with dif-
ferent pharmacodynamics) may be used [129]. For sub-
stances with different mechanisms of action, the evidence 
regarding  their  effectiveness  in  the  treatment  of  post-
traumatic nightmares is limited [100]. The pharmacolog-
ical  treatment  of  post-traumatic  nightmares  is  summa-
rized in Table 5.

Because there are no official recommendations for any 
of the substances, they should be used only following a 
strict  risk-benefit  analysis,  especially  considering  that 
their use would be considered off-label. Specifically, the 
noradrenergic-serotonergic reuptake inhibitor venlafax-
ine and the benzodiazepine clonazepam exert no effect on 

nightmares in PTSD, and their use is explicitly discour-
aged [100]. It should also be taken into account that sero-
tonergic antidepressants in particular may induce or in-
tensify nightmares [130]. In the context of a change  or 
adjustment of medication, it may be helpful to monitor 
the  frequency  and  intensity  of  nightmares.  Preliminary 
results of medically prescribed cannabis for trauma-relat-
ed nightmares seem to be promising [131]; however, the 
evidence to date for this indication is low [132]. In the 
case of pharmacological treatment of sleep-related target 
symptoms, concomitant somatic diseases, such as arterial 
hypertension or neuropathic pain should also be consid-
ered to avoid polypharmacy.

Integrating Sleep Disorders in a Broader PTSD-
Treatment Concept
Improvement of symptoms at night might also be ac-
companied by an amelioration of PTSD symptoms dur-
ing the day [17–19]. Conversely, residual sleep disorders 
may contribute to the maintenance of PTSD if they are 
not adequately treated [15, 16]. Therefore, a close integra-
tion of different interventions for day and night symp-
toms in the sense of an integrative concept would be de-
sirable  [95].  Moreover,  the  implementation  of  specific 
techniques, such as CBT-I, ERRT, EMDR, and IRT in a 
broader  PTSD-treatment  concept  requires  adequate 
knowledge  of  corresponding  methods  or  experience  in 
the treatment of sleep disorders. Further studies are need-
ed comprising medical, psychological, and sociocultural 
factors to establish optimized-treatment algorithms [95].

Sleep Interventions in the Early Aftermath of Trauma
Whether an early effective treatment of sleep disorders 
and nightmares can mitigate or even prevent the develop-
ment of full PTSD remains to be clarified. However, sleep 
interventions after traumatic events, such as sleep facilita-
tion and targeted sleep deprivation have been discussed

as  possible  therapeutic  approaches  [133].  Already  in 
2006, theoretical considerations led to the suggestion that 
sleep  deprivation  immediately  after  a  traumatic  event 
could prevent the transition to PTSD [134]. Because it is 
rarely possible to study sleep so shortly after a traumatic 
event,  the  so-called  trauma  film  paradigm  (an  experi-
mental  model  for  traumatic  events)  was  developed.  By 
exposing participants to analog trauma (film-represent-
ing traumatic experiences), researchers are able to study 
immediate effects of trauma and the effects of treatments 
on the re-experience of trauma and other PTSD symp-
toms [135]. Using this method, it was reported [134] that 
sleep  deprivation  immediately  after  an  induced  trauma 
led to fewer intrusions [136]. These findings contrast with 
results from another study with rare and mild intrusive 
memories after sleep episode following an experimental 
trauma [137]. A  subsequent  study found no significant 
group difference of intrusive symptoms in the week fol-
lowing  a  trauma  film  [138].  Additional  experimental 
studies have demonstrated that longer REM sleep dura-
tion  was  associated  with  reduced  PTSD  severity,  and 
higher REM theta activity with fewer intrusive memories 
[139];  furthermore,  napping  was  associated  with  fewer 
intrusive memories [140]. Overall, these studies provide 
some evidence for a possible protective role of sleep after 
(experimentally induced) trauma in the development of 
intrusive symptoms and PTSD [133]. Naturalistic studies 
have found that sleep disorders directly following a trau-
matic  event  may  increase  the  risk  for  the  development 
and increased severity of PTSD [133]. In addition, sleep 
disturbances in the first week after a trauma correlated 
with the extent of intrusive symptoms [141]. In particu-
lar, sleep in the first night following trauma may be cru-
cial, and both too little and too much sleep was found to 
promote intrusive symptoms [142]. Taken together, re-
search on targeted sleep interventions has revealed het-
erogeneous  results  requiring  further  study.  The  use  of 
home-based  PSG  immediately  after  a  traumatic  event 
may be a promising approach to gain further insights into 
the complex relationship between sleep and PTSD [51].

PTSD. Therefore, a targeted exploration of sleep distur-
bances,  including  the  recognition  of  comorbid-specific 
sleep disorders, such as OSAS and parasomnias, is essen-
tial. As sleep disturbances may emerge as prodromes of 
PTSD, this applies also to people who have been exposed 
to a traumatic event. An effective treatment of sleep dis-
orders and nightmares may not only improve symptoms 
at night but also daytime well-being and quality of life. 
Overall, there is robust evidence for the effectiveness of 
behavioral therapy methods and less evidence for phar-
macological treatment. Identifying subgroups of patients 
with PTSD, who benefit from drug treatment to a greater 
extent  is  of  great  interest.  In  addition,  integrative  con-
cepts and optimized treatment algorithms for sleep and 
daytime symptoms are needed. Adequate therapy might 
also reduce the risk of suicidality in these patients; how-
ever, the complex interactions between PTSD, sleep, and 
suicidality are not well understood and should be inves-
tigated in more detail. We have also reviewed the growing 
literature on the macro- and microstructure of sleep us-
ing PSG and quantitative high-density EEG analyses. Al-
though promising results have been published, it still has 
to be clarified whether EEG spectral topologies may serve 
as biomarkers in PTSD. Future studies should also make 
efforts to clarify the effects of sleep alterations on emo-
tional  processing  and  traumatic  memories.  Specifically, 
experimental research can provide new insights that aim 
at specific sleep interventions as preventive measures for 
PTSD [51].
