Abstract
Purpose of Review We review recent evidence on suicide among older adults, examine risk factors contributing to vulnerability
to late-life suicide, and summarize possible interventions.
Recent Findings We found a steadily increasing rate of late-life suicide in the USA in the past decade. Evidence supporting the
integration of depression care managers into primary care for risk reduction is among the strongest to date. Pharmacologic and
neuromodulation studies should be considered in geriatric depression complicated by suicidality. Broad societal campaigns about
suicide education, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevent suicidal behavior.
Growing research supports an integrative multidisciplinary approach.
Summary Suicide is a complex and multifaceted behavior with numerous casual points for intervention. Access to deadly means,
presence of depression, disease, disability, and social disconnection are factors that increase vulnerability. Quality geriatric care,
regular screening in primary and emergency care settings, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary to mitigate risk factors.
The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies need for a more aggressive approach.

Introduction

Although crude death rates have declined over the last five
decades, having peaked in the 1950s, a slow and steady rise in
suicides occurred in the last 10 years (CDC fatal injury re-
ports). The actual number of deaths by suicide in late life is
expected to rise with increasing percentage of older
Americans (expected to reach 22% of the population by
2050). Despite its prevalence, late-life suicide receives little
attention from media to healthcare initiatives to funding agen-
cies [1(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Ageist views tend to consider depression and
thoughts of death as a normal feature of the aging process.
Accumulation of physical illnesses, disabilities, life events,
and losses is seen as the explanation for so-called rational
suicide to opt out of this end-stage of life [2]. A systemic

review of “rational suicide” identified depression, self-deter-
mination, mental competence, and ageism in both physicians’
and population’s perspectives [3(cid:129)]. Geriatricians are increas-
ingly encountering older adults expressing suicidal wishes in
the absence of overt mental illness, which is expected to grow
[4] more so in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic [5].
In this review, we provide an update on suicide rates and
related vulnerabilities. We summarize notable prior literature
and highlight more specific findings from the past 3 years.
Finally, we end with a review of population-based approaches
for reducing its risk.

Suicide Rates Among Older Adults

Table 1 shows suicide rates among adults ages 65 and older
from 2009 to 2019. In the most recent decade, the highest rate
was 16.67 per 100,000 seniors in 2019, reflecting a nearly
stepwise annual increase, and a 60% increase as compared
with 10.4 per 100,000 seniors 20 years prior. The nation’s
65-and-older population has grown rapidly since 2010, by
over a third (34.2% or 13,787,044) during the past decade
and by 3.2% (1,688,924) from 2018 to 2019. In 2019, older
adults made up 16.5% of the American population but they

accounted for more than 19.4% of suicides. Approximately
71% of late-life suicides in the USA are the result of firearm
use. Suicide attempts in this age group are usually fatal in the
first attempt due to the lethality of means, existing fragility
and lack of desire or opportunity for rescue [6]. While the
crude suicidal death rate was 16.67 per 100,000 seniors in
2019 including all races, ethnicities and genders, the highest
death rate was observed in white males ages 85 and above, at
54.41 per 100,000. Suicide rates among white males grow
from late adolescence and see an abrupt increase from age
65, in contrast to elderly women, whose rates remain constant
from 65. The prevalence of late-life suicide among white
males, a group least likely to seek treatment for depression,
has been the case since the early 2000s [7] (Fig. 1).

Systemic reviews suggest that older adults who died by
suicide are different from younger suicide victims. Older vic-
tims had less evidence of maladaptive personalities and the
majority did not meet the threshold for psychiatric diagnosis.
The only significant association was with a relatively small
number of older suicide victims who had obsessive-
compulsive and avoidant personality disorders, which re-
searchers suggest may account for more difficult transitions
into later-life changes. They also noted that older suicide vic-
tims were more diverse in both risk factors and experiences
compared with early-life suicide victims [8]. A cross-sectional
case-control study comparing the personalities of 200 late-
and early-onset elderly suicide attempters using the Five
Factor Model echoed similar findings where older attempters
scored higher on orderliness and conscientiousness. In con-
trast, younger attempters displayed higher neuroticism, bor-
derline traits, lower extraversion, and higher antisocial traits
[6]. Gujral’s 2020 [9] study examined whether late-onset
(versus early-onset) suicidal behavior is associated with worse
cognition. They found that both attempter groups displayed
worse executive functioning than non-suicidal depressed
older adults. Late-onset attempters additionally displayed
poorer global cognition and processing speed than non-

The majority of suicide decedents encounter primary or emer-
gency care settings in the year prior, rather than a professional
in mental health. According to a review of forty studies, 45%
of suicide victims visited their primary care provider in the
month before suicide, while only 20% saw mental health pro-
fessional in the same period [10].

Unfortunately, the level of suicide screening and subse-
quent mental health evaluation is less among older adults.
Of those discharged from the emergency department with a
positive suicide screen, less than half (42%) of older adults
received a mental health evaluation during their visit com-
pared with 66% of younger adults who met the same criteria.
Similarly, fewer older, than younger patients with current sui-
cidal ideation following an attempt received referral to mental
health treatment (34 vs 60%) [11]. Similar findings were sup-
ported by medical records from a military veterans’ clinic,
where patients older than 50 were less likely to have evidence
of (1) screening for impulsivity and firearms access (2) en-
gagement in safety planning and (3) referrals for mental health
services including psychiatric hospitalization [12].

Risk Factors

Pain, cancer, and chronic illness account for an elevated risk
for suicide. As the number of comorbid diseases mount, rela-
tive risk of suicide is thought to increase substantially. In
Choi’s 2019 review [13], physical health problems were re-
corded as a suicide precipitant for 50% of the older decedents.
Compared with those without, those with physical health
problems as a precipitant were older and twice as likely to
have had depressed mood. They were also more likely to have
disclosed suicide intent, left a suicide note, and used a firearm.
Coroner, medical examiner, and law enforcement reports
found pain (29%) and cancer (28%) mentioned most frequent-
ly, dementia-related functional decline, fear of becoming a
burden to loved ones, refusal of nursing homes, and loss of
independence also named. Even a recent diagnosis of mild
cognitive impairment with its threat of progression to demen-
tia has been associated with attempted suicide [14(cid:129)].

A number of small-sample cross-sectional studies have
specifically looked at neurocognitive impairments as diathesis
to late-life suicide, suggesting that executive dysfunction, al-
tered decision-making, impaired control of intrusive thoughts,
and reduced social emotion recognition underlie decreased
problem-solving ability, which may lead to suicidal ideation
[10].

Alessi’s 2019 two-part study measured motivations for
attempting suicide based on self-report with the Reasons for

Attempting Suicide Questionnaire (RASQ), followed by a
semi-qualitative assessment. Measures of personality for both
studies included assessments of impulsivity, the Five-Factor
Personality Domains, interpersonal dysfunction, and border-
line traits. In study 1, escape/self-punishment motives on the
RASQ were associated with multiple attempts and borderline
pathology, while interpersonal motives were less frequently
endorsed and associated with poorly planned attempts. In
study 2, experiences of defeat (powerlessness, poor coping
to threats to autonomy/status) were more frequently endorsed
by men and associated with disagreeableness. Study 1 re-
vealed that attempters high in dysfunctional psychopathology
were more likely to report self-oriented escape motives for
suicide, while study 2 identified a putative pathway to suicide
in men involving antagonism and the experience of defeat
[15].

Another study examining motivation for suicide by
Bickford 2019 emphasized “perceived stress” as a significant
risk factor. He suggested screening for perceived stress using
the Perceived Stress Scale as part of suicidal prevention efforts
[16].

Both active suicidal ideation and ambivalence about living
are associated with suicide attempt within 6 months.
Clinicians should be mindful that differentiating between ac-
tive suicidal ideation and ambivalence about living are both
presentations that warrant follow-up [8].

Given the multitude of physical, psychological, and
sociodemographic factors that contribute to suicidal ideation,
an individual factor may have little predictive value. However,
mitigating social isolation has been suggested to reduce pop-
ulation attributable risk of suicide by 27% [17].

Late-Life Depression Older adults are less likely than younger
adults to recognize depression symptoms as an illness and less
likely to alert their primary care provider. [18]. In primary care
settings, 6% meet criteria for major depressive disorder.
Another 6% meet criteria for minor depression or dysthymia
(persistent depressive disorder), and an additional 10% meet
criteria for subsyndromal depression (short duration or insuf-
ficient symptoms), scoring above the recovery threshold of the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). As a result,
clinically significant depressive symptoms which may repre-
sent partial remission or the beginning of a major disorder can
be easily missed [19].

Depression predisposes both young and old to somatic ill-
nesses and the relationship is reciprocal. Studies suggest that
white matter changes on MRI and executive dysfunction may
underlie geriatric depression and predict poor antidepressant
response [18]. Depression may then predispose and precipi-
tate vascular events [20]. In Mikami’s 2014 study, low-dose
escitalopram provided to persons free of depression symptoms
and anxiety within 90 days of an embolic stroke halved the

incidence of depression, reduced the emergence of anxiety
and was well-tolerated [21].

That geriatric depression is mediated by inflammation is a
provocative theory. Plasma studies suggest that peripheral in-
flammatory markers are elevated in late life depression and
associated with severity of both mood and cognitive symp-
toms. A recent prospective study found that inflammation
predicted new onset depression in men more so than women.
Participants (n = 10,357) with no evidence of depression at
baseline (based on the nine-item Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), lifetime diagnoses, and current anti-
depressant medication) were evaluated for depression 5 years
later. Multivariate logistic regression predicted the onset of
depression based on C-reactive protein and white blood cell
count. Based on both markers, inflammation was predictive of
new cases of depression 5 years later, even after adjusting for
sociodemographic, physical health, health behavior, and base-
line depression symptoms. Inflammatory markers were pre-
dictive of depression in men, but not in women. Additional
predictors for the onset of depression were younger age, lone-
liness, smoking (in men), cancer, and less alcohol consump-
tion (in women). These gender differences in the etiology of
depressive disorders within the community suggest a greater
role of physical factors in men [22].

Unfortunately, studies targeting inflammation in geriatric
depression have not been promising to date. Taking 100 mg of
daily aspirin compared with placebo was not preventative
[23].

Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions

Anxiety disorders, often comorbid with depression, are in-
volved in one of every six older adult suicides. A cohort study
from the Veterans Affairs National Patient Care Database and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National
Death Index found that psychiatric disorders strongly associ-
ated with suicide include bipolar disorder, depression, sub-
stance use disorders (both alcohol and drugs), schizophrenia,
anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
PTSD was linked to suicide risk in both military and civilians.
Treatment approaches include increased access care, sustained
engagement, care coordination, reinforcement of family, and
peer relations and limiting access to lethal means. A meta-
analysis of interventions following self-harm in late life found
that cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective ther-
apy [24].

Screening for the Wish for Death

The wish to die in older patients admitted to rehabilitation can
be validly assessed with two novel instruments, with a high
concordance rate of 90.1% The Categories of Attitudes toward
Death Occurrence (CADO) allows for passive death wishes to

be distinguished from wishes to actively hasten death.
Associations were observed between the Schedule of
Attitudes Toward Hastening Death (SAHD) and advanced
age, depressive symptoms, lower quality of life, and lower
cognitive function [25].

However existing scales for depression and suicidal idea-
tion are not sufficiently reliable or clinically useful in
predicting the small subgroup of suicide ideators whose death
by suicide is imminent. An ecological momentary assessment
method found that suicidal ideation fluctuates from moment
to moment. In a sample of participating inpatients, who
attempted suicide in the past year, there were dramatic fluc-
tuations in the intensity of suicidal ideation. “All participants
had ideas of suicide which varied in intensity by a full stan-
dard deviation on most days. Many had one standard devia-
tion fluctuations several hours apart within the same day” [8].
This highlights the need to monitor fluctuations and not dis-
miss the possibility of sudden increases in suicidal urges,
even when the current risk appears low. Additionally, suicidal
ideation is considered a better predictor of lifetime risk for
suicide than imminent risk, so assessments should include
describing the characteristics and impact of prior SI as well
as current.

A Separate Psychiatric Phenomenon

The idea that suicide is a separate phenomenon from tradition-
ally associated mood disorders has gained attention. A recent
retrospective analysis concluded that most older adults in the
USA who die from suicide did not have a known mental
health condition. The study was completed in 2019 using the
National Violent Death Reporting System, 2003–2016 (n =
26,884) for suicide deaths for adults aged ≥ 65 years. ORs
compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics,
cause of death, and precipitating circumstances based on
coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement reports.
Older male (69.1%) and female (50.2%) suicide decedents
did not have a known mental illness. A physical health prob-
lem was the most prevalent precipitating circumstance but was
more common among older adults without known mental ill-
ness. Past suicide attempt, disclosure of suicidal intent, de-
pressed mood, and substance use were more common among
those with a known mental illness. More than three fourths of
suicide decedents did not disclose their suicidal intent. Most
suicide deaths involved firearms, which were disproportion-
ately used by decedents without known mental illness (81.6%
of male and 44.6% of female decedents) compared with those
with known mental illness (70.5% of male and 30.0% of fe-
male decedents) [26]. Disconnection between prior mental
illness and suicide completion perhaps warrants the consider-
ation of suicide as a separate psychiatric illness with its dis-
tinct symptoms and pathological processes.

Opportunities to Reduce Suicide Risk

The challenge of tackling suicide lies in its complex and multi-
determined nature; however, it also presents opportunities to
intervene at multiple points in the causal web. Conwell and
Lutz [27] recently suggested the 5D’S framework as a practi-
cal way of looking at the risk factors for late-life depression,
summarized in Table 2. Similar strategies were suggested by
Moutier in 2020 [28(cid:129)(cid:129)]; though some strategies were targeted
toward suicide prevention during COVID-19, they have broad
applicability.

Pharmacotherapy and Other Somatic Interventions

A range of somatic therapies promise to reduce the risk of
suicide among older adults seeking behavioral health care.
These include antidepressants alone and augmentation with
antipsychotics, lithium [10], and electroconvulsive therapy
[29]. However, pharmacotherapy is not without risk [30].
Evidence that transcranial magnetic, direct current stimula-
tion, or ketamine is effective among older patients has yet to
emerge. The larger limitation with these interventions is that
so many people who die by suicide in old age did not seek and
were not identified as needing care.

Nonpharmacological Interventions

The SEEDS study, a trial of 121 patients with late-life depres-
sion, compared the antidepressant effectiveness of sertraline
(S) and sertraline plus exercise (S + EX) and showed greater
improvements in depression in the (S + EX group) [31].
Findings from a recent meta-analysis of randomized con-
trolled trials directly compared the effectiveness of three major
exercise types (aerobic, resistance, and mind-body exercise) in
clinically depressed adults aged 65 and older. Symptoms of
depression improved at 3 months follow-up compared with
baseline regardless of the type of exercise. No statistical dif-
ference was found between the types of exercise. Clinically
depressed older adults, indeed all adults, should be encour-
aged to select their preferred exercise type for physical and
mental benefits [32].

Lethal Means Restriction

Targeted initiatives like gun violence restraining orders, smart
gun technology, and gun safety education campaigns poten-
tially reduce access to already purchased firearms by suicidal
individuals but are too new to have evidence of effectiveness
[34]. Suicide prevention training and vigilance working with
distressed individuals may help in firearm retail settings.
Other means restrictions actions include increasing expired
medication disposal efforts, building bridge barriers [28(cid:129)(cid:129)].

Access to Treatment for Mental Illness and Substance
Use

Increasing the availability of virtual mental health and sub-
stance use treatment is a strategy to increase access.
Especially beneficial to elderly patients with mobility prob-
lems, home-based tele-treatment has been shown to be feasi-
ble and well accepted in the areas of inpatient and nursing
home consultation, cognitive testing, dementia diagnosis and
treatment, depression in integrated and collaborative care
models, and psychotherapy [35, 39, 43, 50, 51]. The
PROSPECT and IMPACT studies demonstrated that a greater
percentage of depressed patients receiving collaborative care
(medication, psychotherapy or both) experienced a decline in
suicidal ideation than depressed patients receiving routine
care.

Addressing Disease and Disability

Suicide is associated with functional disability and specific
conditions such as cancer, neurologic disorders, chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, arthritis/
arthrosis, and pain [10]. The significant contribution of dis-
ease and disability on suicide risk highlights the importance of
comprehensive, quality geriatric medical care. Several cross-
sectional studies indicate an association between clinical frail-
ty and gut microbiota composition (lower levels of butyrate-
producing bacteria). Findings suggest that the causal link be-
tween microbiota and physical fitness is still uncertain due to a
lack of targeted studies and the influence of covariates, includ-
ing diet, exercise, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, on both
microbiota and physical function in older age. However, the
relationship between microbiota and physical function re-
mains a very promising area of research for the future [36].

Broadly reducing availability and access to firearms has
lowered firearm suicide rates in other countries but does not
appear feasible in the USA. Firearm legislation strength is
inversely associated with firearm suicide rates [33, 42]. Gun
safety is critical to restricting access for those at risk.
Screening in both primary care and mental health settings is
needed to identify those at risk. When found to be at high-risk,
utilizing social supports to remove access to weapons is help-
ful. Most suicides involve guns purchased years earlier.

Ageism and Stigma

Ageism has a negative impact on older people’s health and
wellbeing. Anti-stigma education and pro–help-seeking mes-
saging may be effectively delivered through creative partner-
ships with media, community organizations, and entertain-
ment platforms. Performing arts may be an intervention to
lessen age stereotypes among both the young and old. A study
comparing pre-and post-programming attitudes toward aging

Curr Psychiatry Rep           (2021) 23:58 

Page 7 of 9    58 

indicated a successful increase in positive age stereotypes and
decrease in negative age stereotypes after a performance art
program [37]. The scale utilized in this study, “Expectations
Regarding Aging” met minimum requirements for psycho-
metric validation (i.e., internal consistency, adequate content
and structural validity) for assessing the “stereotypes” dimen-
sion of ageism, but not for the other two ageism dimensions
“prejudice and discrimination,” highlighting the need to de-
velop and validate a scale that more broadly captures the mul-
tidimensional nature of ageism [38]. Similar community-level
campaigns were tested in Nuremberg compared with
Würzburg Germany, which resulted in a decline in suicide
attempts after year one and even more in year two in
Nuremberg. However, reductions were most noticeable in
the use of lethal means and among persons less than 70 years
of age [39].

Increasing Social Connectedness

A substantial body of evidence indicates that loneliness and
social isolation increase suicide risk. Quality of perceived so-
cial support is linked to health status [10]. Data suggest that
those who died by suicide were less likely to be married, have
children, or be involved in religious practice. Association be-
tween low social integration and suicide remained significant
after controlling for psychiatric disorders and employment
status. In addition to poor social integration and sense of be-
longing, the death of close relatives is a highly disruptive loss
that constitutes a major risk factor for suicide. Mogensen re-
ported the highest suicide risk during the 6 months following
the loss of a close relative (40). The highest odds ratios for
suicide were found in persons aged 45 and older who had lost
a partner within the last month. Interestingly, loss of a spouse
was associated with lower levels of belongingness in men, but
not in women. The differential link between bereavement and
sense of belongingness between men and women may be due
to the different psychosocial function of marriage or lower
ability for men to maintain social ties compared with women.
Detecting high-risk patient populations with recent suicide
attempts and those likely to be socially disconnected is a start.
Connecting them with community activities, support groups and
individual and group skills training may be effective. Provide
training to maximize elderly use of technology to connect with
health care providers, internet communities and existing social
supports, like family and friends. Van Orden suggests creating “a
Connections Plan,” for the depressed elderly, similar in concept a
Safety Plan in Emergency Settings. They propose its widespread
use in outpatient clinics and long-term care settings, as well as in
early sessions of psychotherapy [1(cid:129)(cid:129)].

For patients presenting with a prior suicide attempt, studies
demonstrate a 50–60% reduction of subsequent attempts by
providing a series of caring messages in the form of postcards,
letters, emails, or telephone messages after discharge [28(cid:129)(cid:129)].

Within healthcare settings, the systemic use of virtual check-
ins has a strong suicide risk-reducing effect.

Clinicians should also address sensory impairment that
could hamper the safety planning process (e.g., vision/hear-
ing) and employ frequent repetition and memory aids to ad-
dress age-related cognitive changes and cognitive impairment
when present [41(cid:129)]. Animal studies demonstrate that hearing
loss and social isolation independently target the serotonergic
system with vast implications for psychiatric disorders [42(cid:129)(cid:129)].

Other

At the legislative level, striving for mental health parity and
promoting integration into primary care are priorities.
Providing fiscal safety nets may also help, as studies suggest
that economic downturns have deleterious effects on popula-
tion suicide rates. Communities may also promote social co-
hesion through social media, influencing policy, and other
campaigns.

Conclusions

A far greater percentage of older patients see their primary
care providers rather than mental health professionals prior
to suicide completion. Training primary care physicians in
depression recognition and treatment prevents suicide.
Training healthcare providers and informal support systems
to assess suicide risk and in evidence-based intervention
plans/guidelines is needed. Evidence supporting the integra-
tion of depression care managers into primary care is
convincing.

Ongoing treatment for associated mental disorders remains
critical. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent sui-
cide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials ap-
pear to be underpowered.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior ther-
apy prevent suicidal behavior. Exercise and nutrition interven-
tions may be beneficial; given few adverse effects is worth-
while to pursue as a treatment adjunct. Clinically depressed
older adults should be encouraged to self-select their preferred
exercise type to achieve therapeutic benefit (no one type of
exercise significantly outperformed another). Electroconvul-
sive therapy is generally safe in geriatric patients, with tran-
sient neurocognitive side effects.

In contrast to their younger counterparts, a significant por-
tion of older suicide completers do not have mental illness.
Recent evidence describes different personality traits in old vs.
young suicide attempters, which may warrant development of
screening tools specific to suicide. CADO and SAHD are 2
novel scales with promise.

Targeting the vulnerability factors to suicide using the 5D’s
framework should be standard practice (Table 2). Providers

should consider implementing a “Connections Plan” as a form
of safety planning for individuals at risk for social
disconnection.

Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide
but is sporadically employed in the USA, even though fire-
arms are used in > 70% of late-life suicides. Restricting fire-
arm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use; specific
strategies are an ongoing area of research as well as
controversy.

Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-
related crisis should be routine and may reduce subsequent
attempts; providers should advocate to maximize virtual com-
munications and access to telemedicine. Suicide rate reduction
requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic
health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening
methods, and passive monitoring of dangerous fluctuation of
acute suicide. The aftermath of the pandemic may well usher
in a surge in deaths of despair [44] due to social isolation,
reduced access to care both mental and physical, complicated
by onset of COVID-19 related cognitive impairment.
However, in 2020, COVID-19 rose to be the third leading
cause of death, suicides fell by 5% from 2019 [45] but drug
overdose deaths rose by 4.8% from 2019 [46], although age-
specific data were not reported. It remains to be seen if the use
of telemedicine and technology can repair the longer-term
damage done to older adults who survived the pandemic
[35, 47].
