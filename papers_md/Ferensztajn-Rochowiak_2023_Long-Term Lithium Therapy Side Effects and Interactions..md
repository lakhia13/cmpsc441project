Abstract: Lithium remains the drug of ﬁrst choice for prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder,
preventing the recurrences of manic and depressive episodes. The longitudinal experiences with
lithium administration greatly exceed those with other mood stabilizers. Among the adverse side
effects of lithium, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, thyroid, metabolic, cognitive, dermatological,
cardiologic, and sexual are listed. Probably, the most important negative effect of lithium, occurring
mostly after 10–20 years of its administration, is interstitial nephropathy. Beneﬁcial side-effects
of long-term lithium therapy also occur such as anti-suicidal, antiviral, and anti-dementia ones.
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of lithium, mostly those with other drugs,
may have an impact on the success of long-term lithium treatment. This paper makes the narrative
updated review of lithium-induced side-effects and interactions that may inﬂuence its prophylactic
effect in bipolar disorder. Their description, mechanisms, and management strategies are provided.
The papers appearing in recent years focused mainly on the long-term lithium treatment are reviewed
in detail, including recent research performed at Department of Psychiatry, Poznan University of
Medical Sciences, Poland. Their own observations on ultra-long lithium treatment of patients with
bipolar disorder are also presented. The review can help psychiatrists to perform a successful lithium
prophylaxis in bipolar patients.

Lithium therapy makes the gold standard for the long-term prophylactic (recurrence-
preventing) treatment of bipolar disorder (BD), recommended by most guidelines [1,2].
The experiences with long-term lithium therapy, where the cases over 40 or even 50 years
of incessant administration have been described, greatly exceed those with other mood
stabilizers. Along with the prophylactic efﬁcacy, preventing recurrences of manic and
depressive episodes, long-term lithium administration is connected with many adverse
but also some beneﬁcial side effects. A comprehensive review of the adverse side effects
of lithium was performed by Gitlin in 2016 [3]. The recent meta-analysis on the anti-
suicidal effect of lithium treatment was conducted by Smith and Cipriani in 2017 [4], while
the antiviral, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties of this drug made the
subject of a recent review by Rybakowski [5]. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
interactions of lithium may be also important for an appropriate lithium administration and
its combination with other medications. The recent evaluation of lithium interactions with
other drugs was made by Finley in 2016 [6]. This paper is the narrative updated review of
lithium-induced side-effects and interactions including the papers on this topic appearing
in recent years, including research performed at the Department of Adult Psychiatry,
Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland. The main focus is put on those making
a signiﬁcant impact on long-term lithium treatment. The prevalence, clinical symptoms,
and management strategies for the adverse effects and unfavorable interactions of lithium
are described. The aim of the review is to help psychiatrists to perform a successful lithium
prophylaxis in bipolar patients.

2. Adverse Side Effects

Adverse side effects of lithium can be divided with respect to the systems or organs,
such as renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, thyroid, metabolic, cognitive, dermatological,
cardiologic, and sexual. Some occur in the initial period of lithium treatment and a part
of them may subside during longer administration. However, several adverse side effects
can appear at any stage of lithium maintenance therapy, and a far few of them may have
a signiﬁcant impact on the success of lithium treatment. For managing adverse side effects
of lithium, several approaches are recommended. Watchful waiting may be sufﬁcient
if tolerance occurs (e.g., nausea). The most frequent procedure is modifying the drug’s
administration such as lowering the dose, resulting in the decrease in serum concentration,
but also altering the time of its providing or switching to a different lithium formulation.
Antidotes for speciﬁc side-effects can be employed. In rare cases, the decision can be made
of lithium discontinuation or/and change to a different mood stabilizer [3].

2.1. Renal Side Effects
2.1.1. Polyuria

Lithium reduces renal concentrating ability, resulting in excessive urination (polyuria)
with concomitant polydipsia. This effect can appear in the ﬁrst weeks of lithium therapy,
whereas a reduction in urinary speciﬁc gravity can in some patients last over years of
lithium treatment. In its most extreme manifestation, the polyuria may have a form of
diabetes insipidus. The mechanism is due to lithium’s effect on the collecting tubules
which generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate in response to antidiuretic hormone. In
our study of 78 bipolar patients using lithium for 5–38 (mean 16) years, we found urinary
speciﬁc gravity of ≤1.005 in 21% of males and 14% of females. A molecular-genetic analysis
revealed an association of polyuria with glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3β) gene
polymorphism [7], which corresponds to the role of this enzyme in the regulation of urinary
concentrating ability [8].

Polyuria is usually alleviated when the dose of lithium is reduced. If the effects of
lithium are very good, a trial of amiloride could be also recommended. In the case of
diabetes insipidus, a decision of lithium discontinuation can be made, and following this,
the polyuria usually disappears [3].

2.1.2. Nephropathy

The most serious concern in patients on long-term lithium therapy is the possibility of
nephropathy in the course of interstitial nephritis. In such conditions, the main changes
in laboratory results are increased creatinine concentration and decreased glomerular
ﬁltration rate (GFR). The biopsy ﬁndings reveal interstitial ﬁbrosis of the cortex and medulla,
interstitial changes with benign lymphatic invasion, glomerular ﬁbrosis, and focal nephron
atrophy [9]. The renal sonography discloses the presence of microcysts and macrocysts,
punctate echogenic foci, and hyperechoic cortex, where the presence of macrocysts is
associated with impaired renal function [10]. A recent pharmacogenetic study suggests an
association of decreasing GFR during long-term lithium treatment with a polymorphism of
the Acid Sensing Ion Channel Neuronal-1 (ACNN1) gene [11].

The International Group for The Study of Lithium Treated Patients (IGSLI) evalu-
ated lithium’s impact on kidneys in patients treated with lithium for 8–48 years (mean
18 years). It was concluded that long-term lithium treatment was associated with a gradual
decline of renal functioning by about 30% more than that that due to aging alone. The
GFR declined by 0.7%/year of age and 0.9%/year of treatment, both by 19% more among
women than men [12]. Recently Rej et al. [13] demonstrated that lithium was associated
with a greater risk for impairment of renal function compared to valproate in the population
of older adults (mean age 71 years), and the effect was more evident with higher lithium
concentrations (>0.7 mmol/L). Swedish investigators studying the cohorts of the LISIE
and MONICA projects (more than two thousand patients) concluded that lithium was the
commonest cause of moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease, although comorbidities

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

3 of 14

also played a role. The decline was signiﬁcantly greater in patients being on more than
10 years of lithium than in all other groups [14]. A meta-analysis by Schoretsanitis et al. [15]
showed that one-fourth of patients receiving long-term lithium may develop impaired
kidney function, which is two-fold higher compared with the non-lithium population. How-
ever, it is thought that generally, the long-term renal outcome of lithium administration in
contemporary studies may be better compared with those before the 21st century which
may be due to the recommendations for lower prophylactic lithium concentrations [16].

In summary, the risk factors for long-term lithium-induced kidney impairment include
older age, concomitant comorbidities, higher serum lithium concentrations, and longer
duration of lithium treatment [12]. Hayes et al. [17], using a 5-year kidney failure risk
equation in a group of over 1600 patients, found predictive factors of high risk of chronic
kidney diseases such as younger age at the commencement of lithium, female sex, and
lower baseline GFR. The authors point out that individuals at high risk of poor GFR
trajectory may be identiﬁed before starting lithium treatment.

In patients in which progressive kidney damage occurs, a decision may be considered
to discontinue lithium and replace it with another mood-stabilizing drug. However, such
an option should be taken with great caution because other mood-stabilizing drugs, espe-
cially in excellent lithium responders, may not be effective, and the further course of the
disease may be drug-resistant [3].

In Pozna ´n, a ﬁve-year observation of four patients exhibiting very good lithium pro-
phylactic effects was conducted. In three males and one female aged 67–69, with an average
lithium treatment duration of 27 ± 9 years, the GFR was less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2.
During the follow-up period, in three patients (two males and one female) with an initial
GFR of 47–48 mL/min/1.73 m2, renal parameters such as GFR, creatinine concentration,
and urinary speciﬁc gravity did not show any signiﬁcant changes. Therefore, these pa-
tients were advised to continue taking lithium at the current doses and to have an annual
check-up of renal condition. In a patient with GFR of 32 mL/min/1.73 s m2 whose GFR
decreased by 14% and creatinine concentration increased by 10%, the lithium dose was
reduced by half, and a periodic consultation with a nephrologist was recommended [18].
Two cases were reported on reintroducing lithium treatment in bipolar patients after
renal transplantation due to end-stage renal disease [19,20]. The second case describes the
65-year-old woman, an excellent lithium responder, who after lithium discontinuation was
hospitalized more than 40 times within two years and after re-starting lithium therapy was
able to achieve remission of symptoms once again [20].

The recommendations for monitoring renal status in patients treated longitudinally
(ten years or more) with lithium suggest that serum lithium levels measurement as well
as those of urea, electrolytes, and creatinine should be performed every 3 to 6 months.
A referral to nephrologist’s evaluation should be considered if GFR is <30 mL/min/
1.73 m2 and a progressive decline in GFR is observed, particularly if the decrease is
more than 4/mL/min/1.73 m2 [21]. Other cautions should include avoiding combin-
ing lithium with medications that can increase nephrotoxic potential (e.g., nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, some antibiotics as
well as cytostatic and immunosuppressive drugs). Acute episodes of renal toxicity should
be warded off, and, if possible, lithium should be administered in one daily dose. In the case
of exacerbation of chronic kidney disease, the lithium dose must be reduced. Sometimes,
even very low lithium doses providing a concentration of 0.2–0.3 mmol/L may be sufﬁcient
and a decision to discontinue lithium may not be necessary [21].

2.2. Gastrointestinal Side Effects

Gastrointestinal side effects present most commonly as nausea and diarrhea. Nausea
occurs in 10–20% of lithium-treated patients being more frequent at the initiation of lithium
treatment. The symptom is usually rather tolerated by the patients and gradually subsides
during long-term therapy. Nausea may correlate with lithium levels, especially peak levels.
Therefore, if it causes a major inconvenience, the patient can be advised to take lithium after

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

4 of 14

meals, to use a multiple daily dose regimen or, if possible, to switch to sustained release
preparations. Vomiting is rare in the beginning period of lithium treatment if the lithium
level is kept at the therapeutic range. If it occurs, the lithium dose should be reduced. In
the ﬁrst months of treatment, diarrhea may occur in up to 10% of lithium-treated patients.
Higher serum lithium levels (e.g., 0.8 mmol/L) may be connected with a predisposition
to this symptom and lowering the dose may be recommended. Perhaps in some patients,
diarrhea may be associated with sustained-release lithium preparations due to more distal
absorption of the drug. In such cases, switching to regular lithium formulation may be
helpful. Both vomiting and diarrhea develop in the situation of lithium poisoning [21].

2.3. Neurological Side Effects
2.3.1. Tremor

The most common of lithium side effects is tremor, mainly of the hands, reported in
about 20–25% of the patients, perhaps more often in men. Usually, it appears in the ﬁrst
few weeks after starting lithium therapy, especially in patients with other predisposing
factors such as older age and combined therapy with antipsychotics, antidepressants, and
antiepileptic drugs. Some research indicated that hand tremor is related more to brain
lithium concentration than serum lithium levels. The tremor is ﬁne, similar to essential
tremor, different than Parkinson-type tremor, and most apparent when taking planned
actions such as lifting the cup or other precise hand movements. The recommended action
to alleviate symptoms of tremors is the reduction of lithium dose. If such treatment is
not efﬁcient, the administration of propranolol at doses of 20–80 mg/day is a potentially
effective strategy [22].

2.3.2. Other

The extrapyramidal symptoms, such as parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, or akathisia
can also occur during lithium treatment, especially in older age and with combined therapy
with neuroleptics. There are also reports on cerebellar symptoms such as nystagmus and
gait disturbances, sometimes occurring even with the therapeutic level of lithium. In such
cases, if they do not disappear after major reduction of lithium dose, discontinuation of the
drug should be considered [22].

2.3.3. Lithium Intoxication

The symptoms of neurotoxicity always appear during lithium poisoning. This can be
caused by overdosing, both intentional and accidental, dehydration, infection with fever,
and the addition of other drugs. Symptoms appear when lithium concentration reaches
1.2 mmol/L and above. Mild poisoning manifests as weakness, severe hand tremor, mild
ataxia, concentration disorders, and diarrhea. Severe poisoning presents with vomiting and
neurological disturbances, mainly cerebellar symptoms (tremor, nystagmus, dysarthria,
dizziness, ataxia), less often parkinsonian symptoms, choreoathetoid movements, or epilep-
tic seizures. The disturbance of consciousness develops, which is mostly manifested as
a stupor. Treatment of lithium poisoning includes intensive somatic care with forced lithium
elimination by the infusion of physiological saline. For severe poisoning and high lithium
concentration (>2 mmol/L), hemodialysis is very effective for a rapid decrease in lithium
concentration [23].

In some patients, cognitive disorders and neurological deﬁcits, mostly as symptoms
of cerebellar damage (ataxia), may be a sequel of lithium poisoning. For deﬁning such
cases, the acronym SILENT (syndrome of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity)
was coined [24]. Lithium intoxication may also predispose to further kidney damage [9].

2.4. Thyroid Side Effects

Adverse lithium effects on the thyroid were observed as early as in the 1960s [25].
Lithium accumulates in the thyroid gland at three- to four-fold higher concentrations than
in plasma. Administration of the drug causes a reduced production and release inhibition

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

5 of 14

of thyroid hormones. The most common thyroid side effects associated with long-term
lithium treatment are hypothyroidism and goiter.

The prevalence of hypothyroidism during lithium treatment varies from 6% to 50%,
with signiﬁcantly higher female preponderance. Recently we studied 98 bipolar subjects
receiving lithium for mean of 19 years, and 39 subjects, matched for gender and dura-
tion of the illness, never receiving lithium. The concentration of the thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) was signiﬁcantly higher in patients receiving lithium. The frequency of
hypothyroidism in the course of the illness was similar in both groups (24% vs. 18%) and
higher in women than in men (32% vs. 7% and 22% vs. 8%, respectively). This may suggest
that bipolar illness itself may predispose to such a condition. In lithium-treated subjects,
hypothyroidism usually developed in the ﬁrst years of lithium therapy, more frequently
in subjects with a family history of thyroid dysfunction. All hypothyroid patients were
successfully treated with levothyroxine [26].

The prevalence of goiter is estimated at 30–59% of lithium-treated patients. The
mechanisms of lithium-induced goiter can include the inhibition of thyroid hormone
release resulting in an increase in TSH that leads to the increment of the thyroid volume.
Additionally, the activation by lithium of tyrosine kinase and the inﬂuence on intracellular
signaling by cyclic AMP and Wnt/beta-catenin induces the proliferation of thyrocytes [27].
In our study mentioned above, the thyroid volume was signiﬁcantly higher in the lithium-
treated group than in the lithium-naïve group as were more numerous focal changes >1 cm.
The percentage of goiter was signiﬁcantly higher in the lithium-treated group (40%) than
in the lithium-naïve group (18%). In lithium-treated patients, the incidence of goiter was
similar in male and female patients (37% vs. 41%). Importantly, the structural changes were
not related to the concentrations of thyroid hormones [26]. Additionally, although lithium
is supposed to interfere with thyroid immunity, no difference in thyroid autoantibodies
was found between the two groups [28].

After starting lithium, it is recommended to monitor thyroid functions every 6 months.
The presence of elevated TSH, hypothyroidism, and/or goiter during successful lithium
therapy makes by no means evidence to discontinue the drug. All such conditions constitute
indications for the thyroxine treatment; the dose can be consulted with an endocrinolo-
gist. Whereas, in very rare cases of hyperthyroidism, an endocrinologist’s intervention is
a necessity, and possible lithium discontinuation may be considered [23].

2.5. Metabolic Side Effects
2.5.1. Weight Gain

Weight gain is an inconvenient side effect in lithium-treated patients, and in rare
cases, may lead to clinical obesity. In some subjects, especially women, it can signiﬁcantly
impair compliance. The mechanisms of action may include the consumption of high-calorie
drinks, insulin-like actions of lithium on carbohydrate and fat metabolism, as well as
sodium retention. Bopp et al. [29] showed that in lithium augmentation of antidepressants,
weight gain could be associated with leptin gene polymorphism. Whereas, in a recent
meta-analysis, it was shown that weight gain on lithium cannot be remarkable and lower
than on some active comparators (e.g., valproate) [30].

The main preventive and therapeutic strategies include diet, physical activity, and
monitoring of thyroid function. Combined therapy with drugs of low weight-gain potential
(lamotrigine, aripiprazole) or the addition of topiramate may be considered. Some case
reports describe the use of metformin with good results [31].

2.5.2. Calcium and Bone Metabolism

Lithium can increase calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, stimulate parathormone
(PTH) secretion, and cause a calcium-phosphate imbalance in the form of primary lithium-
induced hyperparathyroidism. A meta-analysis has found that patients undergoing lithium
therapy have on average higher concentrations of calcium and PTH [32]. In Poznan, in
the study of 90 patients (30 males and 60 females) aged 60 ± 10, and treated with lithium

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

6 of 14

for 16 ± 10 years, hypercalcemia was found in 10% of them (7% males and 12% females).
Among the nine patients with hypercalcemia, three were found to have hyperparathy-
roidism [33]. Lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism can be due to lithium’s action on
the calcium-sensing receptor and GSK-3, revealed by unmasking hyperparathyroidism in
patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular
hyperparathyroidism [34]. Therefore, in people treated with lithium for a long time, it
is advisable to monitor serum calcium levels, and in a situation of their increase, also
PTH levels. In the case of lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism with signiﬁcant clinical
symptoms, treatment is similar to that of primary hyperparathyroidism.

In contrast to possible disturbances in calcium metabolism, there are some data on
the positive effect of lithium on bone mineral density [35]. A recent retrospective cohort
study performed in Denmark showed that while bipolar disorder was associated with
an increased risk of osteoporosis, the treatment with lithium resulted in a decrease in such
risk [36].

2.6. Cognitive Side-Effects

Moderate cognitive impairment is perceived by clinicians as associated with lithium
treatment. Contrary to that, the results of animal research in various models point to lithium
exerting a favorable effect on cognitive functions. Additionally, patients with BD have
cognitive problems of various intensity, worsening during manic or depressive episodes,
and sometimes also persisting during euthymia. Therefore, this should be adjusted when
assessing the lithium effect. It seems that lithium treatment may not negatively affect
previously impaired cognitive functions in bipolar patients [37]. Italian authors have
carried out neuropsychological tests on lithium-treated bipolar I patients in the state
of euthymia, gender- and age-matched patients with the illness receiving other mood-
stabilizing drugs, and healthy individuals. It was found that bipolar patients showed
deﬁcits in visual memory and executive functions. However, after taking into account
the method of treatment, it turned out that these deﬁcits occurred only in patients using
mood stabilizers other than lithium [38]. Additionally, in a more recent study, longitudinal
monotherapy with lithium resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement in the global cognitive
index score [39].

In Poznan, an attempt was made to correlate the cognitive functions of lithium-treated
patients with the quality of lithium prophylactic effect. Lithium non-responders had
signiﬁcantly worse performance on many domains of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
compared to excellent and partial responders [40]. We also demonstrated that bipolar
patients who are excellent lithium responders have cognitive functions comparable to those
of matched control subjects [41]. Therefore, an important mechanism of the effect of lithium
on cognitive functions could be related to the prevention by lithium of affective recurrences.
Previous studies also showed a correlation between neuropsychological deﬁcits, a greater
number of affective episodes, and a more severe course of the illness.

The neurobiological processes connected with the favorable effect of lithium on cogni-
tive functions may include an enhancement of the BDNF system and inhibition of GSK-3β.
Interestingly, because of the pathogenic importance of herpes viruses in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease [42] and lithium’s antidementia activity (see later), the antiviral effect of lithium against
herpes viruses may also be taken into account. It was found that infection with herpes
simplex virus type 1 in BD was connected with a decrease in cognitive functioning [43],
and the association between cognitive impairment and HSV-1 positivity both in BD and
schizophrenia was recently conﬁrmed [44].

From the practical point of view, in cases of suspected cognitive problems in lithium-
treated patients the reduction of lithium dose should be considered. The experience shows
that using lithium in the lowest useable dose could be a protective factor against possible
cognitive problems.

2.7. Dermatological Side-Effects

Among the lithium-induced dermatological side-effects, exacerbated acne and pso-
riasis, as well as de novo occurrence of such conditions, should be mentioned. Psoriasis
of moderate to severe intensity may be a contraindication for the introduction of lithium.
Dermatological symptoms may be related to the concentration of lithium, and therefore
an attempt at dose reduction may be made. If the effects of lithium are good, drugs rec-
ommended for these diseases can be used. Only in very severe cases, it may be necessary
to replace lithium with another mood stabilizer. Recently, a case of a treatment-resistant
female bipolar patient with psoriasis was presented, in whom, after the introduction of
lithium, a remission of bipolar illness was achieved as well as a reduction of psoriatic
changes. This could be explained by lithium’s immunomodulatory activity [45].

2.8. Cardiological Side-Effects

According to a recent review, the most important cardiological side effect of lithium
is sinus bradycardia. In persons with genetic predisposition, a clinical presentation of
Brugada syndrome may occur. Additionally, electrocardiographic changes (ECG) can
appear, such as reversible T wave inversion, sinus node dysfunction, sinoatrial blocks, PR
prolongation, QT prolongation/dispersion, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The rare
cases of ST elevation, myocardial infarction, and heart blocks were also described. The ECG
changes are generally dependent on both the duration of lithium treatment and the serum
concentration of the drug [46]. Therefore, periodic ECG monitoring in patients during
long-term prophylactic lithium treatment is recommended. In severe cases of arrhythmia,
if lithium therapy is necessary, cardiological consultation should be considered.

Recently, studies appeared indicating a possible beneﬁcial effect of lithium on cardiac
functions. Taipei’s authors showed that patients who received lithium as the maintenance
treatment had signiﬁcantly lower mean values of left ventricular internal diameters at
end-diastole and end-systole, higher mean values of mitral valve E/A ratio, and superior
performance of global longitudinal strain than those without lithium treatment. As pos-
sible mechanisms, they postulate lithium’s effect on cardiac remodeling involving many
signaling pathways as well as its inﬂuence on a chemokine, fractalkine [47].

2.9. Sexual Side Effects

Sexual side effects are rarely reported by lithium-treated patients, and they also are
under-researched. The literature survey from 2015 indicates that lithium may reduce sex-
ual thoughts and desire, worsen erectile function, and diminish sexual satisfaction, and
an increased risk of such dysfunctions may appear with concomitant benzodiazepine use.
The mechanism behind this should be a reduction by lithium of testosterone concentra-
tion and impairing nitric oxide-mediated relaxation of cavernosal tissue [48]. A report
from 2014 suggests the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the group of bipolar patients
with mean duration of lithium treatment of 10 years one-third of them [49]. In a recent
multicenter cross-sectional study, lithium in monotherapy or in combination with benzodi-
azepines was found to be related to worse total sexual functioning than anticonvulsants in
monotherapy [50].

Although sexual dysfunction during lithium treatment appears associated with a lower
level of overall functioning and may reduce compliance, limited treatment approaches
were suggested. In one study, aspirin 240 daily, was reducing overall sexual dysfunction
and improved erectile dysfunction [51]. However, it seems that, especially in diminished
arousal, modern phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors should be considered.

3. Beneﬁcial Effects of Long-Term Lithium Treatment
3.1. Anti-Suicidal

Long-term lithium treatment is connected with a signiﬁcant anti-suicidal effect. It was
conﬁrmed by the three meta-analyses performed in the 21st century [4,52,53].
A signiﬁcantly better effect of lithium than a placebo in decreasing the number of suicides

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

8 of 14

and deaths from any cause both in bipolar disorder and recurrent depression, superior
to other mood-stabilizers or antidepressants, was found [4]. Currently, the anti-suicidal
effect of lithium in mood disorders is well documented and the largest among other mood-
stabilizing drugs. According to German researchers, the anti-suicidal effect of lithium is
most prominent after 2 years of lithium administration and is not correlated with the quality
of prevention of mood recurrences [54]. As suicides are the most common cause of death of
people with mood disorders, this effect of lithium translates into providing signiﬁcantly
lower mortality in patients using it. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider long-term
lithium administration in each patient with a mood disorder having a high suicidal risk.

3.2. Antiviral

The antiviral effect of lithium, especially against herpes viruses, has been known
since 1980 when British researchers showed that lithium inhibits the replication of the
herpes simplex virus (HSV) in an experimental model [55]. In 1991, the “Lithium” journal
presented the results of a Polish–American retrospective study of the occurrence of labial
herpes in patients receiving lithium for prophylactic purposes.
In the Polish sample,
nearly half of the patients with recurrent labial herpes experienced a complete elimination
of recurrences, and in the remaining—the frequency decreased. A better “anti-herpes”
effect was observed in patients with serum lithium concentration over 0.65 mmol/L, and
erythrocyte concentration over 0.35 mmol/L. In the American sample, the frequency
of recurrences of oral herpes, compared to ﬁve years before the treatment, decreased
in the group receiving lithium by 73%, while there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
group taking antidepressants [56]. The results obtained may show that long-term lithium
treatment may bring about additional therapeutic advantage in bipolar patients with
recurrent herpes infections.

In experimental studies, promising results were found for using lithium also against
RNA viruses, including coronaviruses [57]. Therefore, interest was kindled in the possible
beneﬁts of lithium in COVID-19 patients [58]. Recently, De Picker et al. [59] assessed the
relationship between the presence of COVID-19 infection and serum lithium levels in more
than 26 thousand patients. The incidence of infection was signiﬁcantly lower in those
with lithium levels maintained within therapeutic limits (0.5–1.0 mmol/L) compared with
those with lithium levels <0.5 mmol/L. It may correspond to the relationship between
the concentration of lithium and its therapeutic effect on labial herpes [56]. Furthermore,
in those with a therapeutic level of lithium, the incidence of infection was signiﬁcantly
lower compared with patients using valproate [59]. Therefore, a possible antiviral effect of
lithium in patients with COVID-19 remains a promising issue.

3.3. Anti-Dementia

In the 21st century, evidence was also obtained on the neuroprotective and „antide-
mentia” effects of lithium [60]. Lithium treatment was shown to increase the volume
of cerebral grey matter, especially that of the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and
hippocampus. Such an effect was not observed for any other mood-stabilizing drug. In
the IGSLI study, lithium-treated bipolar patients had a larger volume of the hippocampus
than non-lithium patients; such volume in BD subjects was similar to healthy controls [61].
The suggestions were also put forward that lithium could protect against dementia. The
association between lithium treatment and a diminished risk of dementia was noticed
in a recent 15-year study by Chen et al. [62] including 29,618 patients of whom 548 were
exposed to lithium. After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors it turned
out that lithium use was associated with a lower risk of dementia, with a hazard ratio (HR)
0.56, including Alzheimer’s disease (HR = 0.55) and vascular dementia (HR = 0.36). The
data from the Danish nationwide register showed that BD patients treated with lithium
for a long time had the rate of dementia similar to or lower than in the general population.
However, such a rate was increased in patients who received longitudinally anticonvulsant,
antidepressant, and antipsychotic drugs [63]. In studies performed in Denmark and the

USA, a negative correlation was found between the concentration of lithium in drinking
water and the frequency and severity of dementia [64,65]. Finally, possible beneﬁt of using
lithium in dementia was found in a recent meta-analysis [66].

As bipolar disorder itself increases the risk of dementia, the results obtained may show
an additional advantage of the long-term lithium treatment in a form of decreasing such
a risk.

4. Lithium Interactions
4.1. Pharmacokinetic Interactions

Pharmacokinetic interactions with lithium are connected with the effect of other
substances on renal lithium clearance resulting in an increase or decrease in serum lithium
concentration. Interactions that increase lithium levels, which may lead to lithium poisoning
and cause symptoms of neurotoxicity and organ toxicity, should be of special interest.

A decrease in lithium clearance can be due to stimulation of proximal tubular sodium
reabsorption resulting in concomitant reabsorption of lithium. The drugs reducing lithium
clearance are diuretics such as thiazides, amiloride, and spironolactone. Loop diuretics
(e.g., furosemide) exert a lesser effect. Such lithium clearance reduction is also caused by
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
Drugs that are lowering blood pressure such as ACE-I, beta-blocking agents, or calcium
entry blocker verapamil can also decrease lithium clearance by reducing renal perfusion
pressure. Other calcium-channel antagonists can cause lithium toxicity; however, the
postulated mechanism of action is probably different (an increase in lithium concentration
in cells). Furthermore, a decrease in lithium clearance using nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) is due to the reabsorption of lithium in the distal neuron being induced by
these drugs. Aspirin does not exert such an effect [6].

Accelerating lithium elimination (increase in lithium clearance) can be obtained
through decreasing lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubule by osmotic diuresis (e.g.,
mannitol), carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, and sodium bicarbonate [67]. Some
calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine or isradipine can cause an increase in lithium
clearance by producing afferent arteriolar vasodilatation. The same mechanism pertains to
xanthines such as aminophylline, theophylline, and caffeine. Patients who abruptly stop
excessive drinking of coffee or tea may be at risk of decreasing lithium clearance which
may even result in intoxication [6].

Pharmacokinetic interactions between lithium and other drugs are shown in Table 1.

lithium clearance).

From a practical point of view, the use during long-term lithium treatment of antihy-
pertensive drugs and non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is probably the most
important. The employment of thiazides, ACE-I, and ARB in combination with lithium is
generally not recommended. However, Hommers et al. [68] suggest that a combination of
lithium with ACE-I would be possible when sufﬁcient hydration is provided and a combi-

nation with hydrochlorothiazide is avoided. Additionally, NSAIDs, which can decrease
lithium clearance, are frequently used. Therefore, when the employment of NSAIDs is
required for longer time for non-psychiatric reasons, the recommended procedure is to
lower the dose of lithium with frequent concentration testing [69].

4.2. Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Pharmacodynamic interactions may result from the combination of lithium with other
mood stabilizers as well as with antidepressive and antipsychotic drugs. As monotherapy
with lithium is prophylactically effective in about 30% of bipolar patients, a combination
with other mood-stabilizing drugs is frequently performed for reaching an optimal effect.
The combination of lithium with all ﬁrst-generation (carbamazepine and valproate) and
second-generation mood stabilizing drugs (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole,
and risperidone) seems pretty safe as for any combinations; there is no signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the level of each drug. Since lithium increases the number of leukocytes, a combina-
tion of the drug with carbamazepine or clozapine may prevent leukopenia induced by
these substances.

Increased lithium neurotoxicity can be caused by many drugs especially if they are
administered in high doses. They include, among others, typical antipsychotics (chlorpro-
mazine and other phenothiazines, haloperidol), tricyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine,
and topiramate. The use of lithium with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), e.g., for augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression can in
rare cases intensify its serotoninergic effect, leading to the symptoms of serotonin syndrome
such as tremors, dizziness, agitation, confusion, or diarrhea.

Other interactions include the enhancement and prolongation of the action of muscle
relaxants, both competitive (e.g., pancuronium) and depolarizing (succinylcholine), and
in rare cases, it triggers attacks of congenital muscle fatigue. Therefore, a temporary
withdrawal of lithium during electroconvulsive therapy (ETC) could be advised. Lithium
has been also reported to inhibit the action of amphetamine derivatives [23].

5. Ultra-Long Lithium Therapy

In many patients, especially good responders, the treatment with lithium can be
a life-long procedure. In 2016, we described ﬁve cases (two men and three women, aged
64–79 years) treated with lithium for over 40 years. In four of them, the average lithium
concentration was 0.60–0.65 mmol/L, and in one male, 0.7–0.8 mmol/L. The renal status
of three women was asymptomatic stage 2 chronic kidney disease; one male patient
was diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and the second male had stage 2/3
of kidney impairment, however, without the signs of progress. The thyroid status in
four patients was normal. One female patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease
characterized by very high levels of anti-thyroid antibodies and treated with thyroxine.
Serum calcium levels were normal or borderline in all patients. Their cognitive functioning
was satisfactory, and they continued occupational activity until 55–65 years of age. In all of
them, lithium administration had started in the initial years of the illness, which is thought
a good prognostic factor for prophylactic efﬁcacy. These cases may show that, in good
lithium responders, ultra-long-term treatment with lithium enables good professional and
psychosocial functioning, and the possible somatic side effects are manageable [70].

Recently, a case of a 79-year-old female, who reached the 50-year anniversary of
lithium treatment was presented. Lithium treatment was started after the third depressive
episode which appeared within four years. The treatment resulted in a complete prevention
of depressive or manic episodes, enabling the patient to lead a satisfying personal and
professional life. The patient worked successfully as an ophthalmologist until 65 years
of age. The kidney status in 2012 was asymptomatic stage 2 chronic kidney disease, and
the thyroid function in 2013 was within the normal range as was serum calcium level. In
this person, apart from maintaining a euthymic state, long-term treatment with lithium
also exerted a favorable effect on general health preventing viral and other respiratory

Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 74

infections as well as producing a disappearance of recurrent herpes. Among the factors
that facilitated a good response to lithium, a hyperthymic personality and early start of
lithium treatment can be listed. The patient may be regarded as the epitome of an excellent
lithium responder [71].

6. Conclusions

Long-term lithium therapy is the maintenance treatment of choice in bipolar mood
disorder which can be successfully performed for 40 years or more. Promising results were
also obtained for the long-term prophylaxis of recurrent depression [72]. As shown in this
review, such treatment may be connected with several adverse side effects and interactions
but also with some beneﬁcial events. The adverse side effects and interactions, with proper
knowledge, can be successfully managed. Such an expertise could help the psychiatrist to
perform successfully lithium prophylaxis for mood disorders.

Unfortunately, despite clinical efﬁcacy surpassing other mood-stabilizing drugs, man-
ageable side effects and interactions, as well as advantageous properties, that of anti-
suicidal would be the most important; lithium currently is greatly under-prescribed. There-
fore, its therapeutic potential in mood disorders is not fully utilized. The claims for allowing
a larger number of mood disorder patients to became beneﬁciaries of lithium use have been
voiced, also by the authors of this paper [73,74]. It may be hoped that this review could
also serve such a purpose.
