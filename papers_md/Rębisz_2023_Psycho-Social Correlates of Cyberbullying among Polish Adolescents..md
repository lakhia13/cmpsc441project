Abstract: Cyberbullying has recently attracted attention due to its increasing prevalence and serious
consequences for both victims and perpetrators. The objective of this population-based study was to
examine the determinants of a person becoming a perpetrator of cyberbullying, including personal
resources (emotional self-regulation, self-esteem, internal locus of control, optimism), social skills
(prosocial behavior, assertiveness, cognitive empathy, cooperation), peer relationships (peer support,
threats from peers, peer rejection, dislike of peers), and problematic Internet use (excessive Internet
use, impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation). Participants (N = 541) were students at elementary
schools (age 14–15) in Ostroleka, a city in central-eastern Poland. Two-part regression was used to
explore protective/risk factors of the likelihood of an individual using cyberviolence (dichotomous
part: involvement in violence) and how often it is used (continuous part: frequency of cyberbullying).
The results showed that the emotional component is crucial to cyberbullying, as indicated by the
importance of emotional self-control, which reduces the frequency of cyberbullying. Other important
factors are assertiveness, impulsive response to limited Internet access (which increases the likelihood
of engaging in cyberbullying) and fear of peers (which reduces its frequency). In turn, the importance
of pro-sociality (which inhibits engagement) and peer support (which promotes engagement) points
to the second important component of cyberbullying—that is, group mechanisms. At the same time,
the results indicate that while the importance of Internet addiction as a risk factor for cyberbullying
should not be underestimated, the amount of time spent online cannot be seen as the source of the
problem. The study leads to the conclusion that effective interventions targeting cyberbullying should
focus on the development of more adaptive styles of coping with emotions.

1. Introduction

In contrast to previous generations, today’s youth are growing up in a culture in
which being online is an integral part of everyday life [1]. Although the development
of technology opens up a world of opportunities, it also carries the danger of adverse
phenomena, such as cyberbullying [2], which is experienced by between 10% and 53%
of young people, depending on the various deﬁnitions of cyberbullying and the age of
respondents in the groups studied [3].

1.1. Bullying and Cyberbullying

Bullying is commonly defined as repeated exposure to negative behaviors of one or
more peers that are intended to cause harm and involve a power imbalance in favor of
the perpetrator [4]. Due to its nature (physical, verbal, or relational), bullying behavior is
associated with negative psychological outcomes for both the perpetrator and the victim [5,6].
Cyberbullying, in turn, is deﬁned as being cruel to others by sending or posting
harmful material or engaging in other forms of social cruelty while using the Internet or

other digital media. Cyberbullying shares many characteristics with “traditional” violence,
such as intentional harm, repetitive engagement, and power imbalances [7]. Unsurprisingly,
the existing meta-analyses show positive associations between involvement in traditional
bullying and cyberbullying [8,9].

However, as Kowalski [8] notes, despite their co-occurrence, the two behaviors differ
in important ways. First, cyberbullies are often anonymous, which signiﬁcantly expands
the pool of potential perpetrators of cyberbullying compared to the traditional type. Second,
the difference lies also in the accessibility of the victim. Traditional bullying by children
or adolescents occurs most often at a particular educational institution during the school
day, whereas the perpetrators of cyberbullying can be active via electronic devices round
the clock and seven days a week. Third, as a result of the use of networks and electronic
devices for cyberbullying, the potential audience for violent behavior is much larger than
for traditional bullying. Fourth, those who engage in cyberbullying are not exposed to the
direct effects their actions have on the victim. Fifth, due to the nature of the technology used
for cyberbullying, the victim’s response may be delayed [8]. Sixth, cyberbullying is, on the
whole, more indirect and involves minimal physical force [10]. Seventh, whereas traditional
bullying consists mainly in physical, verbal, and social forms of violence, cyberbullying
takes visual and textual forms [11].

1.2. Cyberbullying—Age and Gender

Research ﬁndings on the age determinants of cyberbullying are inconclusive [12].
Some studies suggest that it is more prevalent in middle schools [13], while others suggest
that older students (15+) are more likely to cyberbully than younger ones (10–14 years
old) [14,15]; also, it seems that involvement in cyberbullying increases in high school,
while other forms of bullying peak in late elementary or middle school and decline in
high school [16,17]. Some reviews suggest that engagement in cyberbullying peaks during
adolescence. Accordingly, the experience of victimization of cyberbullying peaks among
12–14 year-olds [18].

Various studies demonstrate that when it comes to traditional bullying, boys are
more likely to engage in it than girls, particularly in regard to direct physical abuse [10].
Many studies have found that men are also more likely to participate in cyberbullying
than women [6,10,17]. One meta-analysis [19] concluded that the main reason adolescents
engaged in cyberbullying was relationship problems, and that girls fell victim to it in most
cases. Research conducted among students showed that girls were more likely to report
being victims of relational and verbal cyberbullying, while boys were more likely to report
physical harassment [17].

Although many previous studies indicate that males are more likely to engage in
cyberbullying than females, there is now evidence that perpetration and victimization are
equal in both genders [12,20,21]. However, research indicates that gender differences in
cyberbullying behavior vary by geographical region; hence, as Barlett and Coyne [22] note,
cyberbullying should be conceptualized as a social and cultural phenomenon [10].

1.3. Cyber Perpetrator vs. Cyber Victim: The Cyclic Process Model

Many studies show that a lot of teenagers who are targets of aggression become
perpetrators of online violence. This mechanism is explained by the Cyclic Process Model
theory, which assumes that face-to-face victimization in teens triggers feelings of anger
and frustration, and individuals who experience anger and frustration are more likely to
engage in deviant behavior. Increased levels of tension in bullied teens may thus ﬁnd an
outlet in cyberbullying behavior [18]. Additionally, a meta-analysis conducted by Guo [3]
found that the variables related to prior experiences of being cyberbullied or exposed to
traditional bullying are the two strongest predictors of engaging in cyberbullying.

1.4. Personal Resources and Cyberbullying

Of the constructs describing characteristics of students, the following have been chosen
for consideration in this article: emotional self-regulation, self-esteem, internal locus of
control, and optimism.

Contemporary approaches to self-regulation stem from the work of Albert Ban-
dura [23], who argued that, according to the theory of social cognition, human behavior is
motivated and regulated by the constant exertion of self-inﬂuence. This inﬂuence concerns
the self-control of behavior and its social context, evaluation of one’s own behavior in
relation to personal standards and environmental circumstances, and affective reactions.
Even though there are many other theoretical approaches to self-regulation, it is usually
deﬁned as the ability to control one’s behavior, emotions, thoughts, and attention in order
to achieve goals [24].

As already mentioned, many studies expose the disturbing fact that adolescents who
are objects of aggression become the perpetrators of online violence [9,18]. One way
to explain this is that feelings of anger and frustration ﬁnd expression in cyberbullying
others [25]. It seems that this self-perpetuating cycle of violence may disrupt an individual’s
ability to self-regulate, especially emotionally. Since research shows that anger mediates
the relationship between being a victim and carrying out acts of cyberbullying [26], it is the
self-control of negative emotions that may be the key to breaking the cycle of aggression.
A study by A. Baroncelli and E. Ciucci [27] showed that the emotional intelligence
dimension of emotional regulation (that is, a factor strongly related to emotional self-
regulation) was linked negatively to both traditional violence and cyberbullying. However,
the relationship disappeared when traditional bullying was controlled for, while it contin-
ued when cyberbullying was controlled for ofﬂine violence and being a victim. This means
that self-regulation is probably more relevant to cyberbullying than to ofﬂine aggression.
Cyberbullying can result from a lack of sufﬁcient emotional self-regulatory capac-
ity, but the picture is even more complicated by the fact that aggression, especially in
its instrumental form, can itself be a manifestation of self-regulation. For example, in
individuals with high-level narcissism, aggression may be an attempt to regain social status
after their social reputation has been threatened [28]. Studies on the relationship between
self-regulation and cyberbullying also emphasize the complexity of the relationship; for
example, A.H. den Hamer and E.A Konijn [29] found in their longitudinal study that using
positive emotional regulation strategies to cope with anger did not reduce cyberbullying
behavior, although, on the other hand, adolescents who blamed others and ruminated on
their negative experiences were more likely to engage in cyberbullying.

Thus, presenting self-regulation as a simple remedy for cyberbullying has no clear
empirical grounds. Certainly, the inhibitory effect of self-regulation is worth exploring
further, especially while considering multiple potential causal factors.

Another construct under consideration in this context is general self-esteem, under-
stood as an overall and subjective self-evaluation. Self-esteem is a dynamic phenomenon;
studies show that it undergoes particularly big ﬂuctuations during childhood, adolescence,
and old age [30]. The level of self-esteem of boys and girls in late childhood (between 7 and
10–12 years of age) is similar. Differences become apparent only in adolescence (between
10–12 and 20–22 years of age), especially in its initial phase. This implies the need to take
gender into account when analyzing the correlates of self-esteem.

The associations of self-esteem with cyberbullying relate primarily to being a victim.
Self-esteem, including suicidal thoughts and suicidal behavior, has been found to be signifi-
cantly associated with being a victim of cyberbullying [31]. However, a study of Australian
elementary school students between the ages of 10 and 12 showed a more complex picture.
Children who reported a single episode of cyberbullying had the highest levels of self-esteem,
while those who reported multiple acts of cyberbullying had the lowest [32].

The impact of being a victim of online violence on self-esteem is well documented
empirically, but does the inverse relationship also hold? It is known that being a victim and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

perpetrator of online aggression are strongly, positively related (Cyclic Process Model). Is it
to be expected, then, that low self-esteem fosters cyberbullying?

Research usually points to a negative relationship, but the picture is far from clear. The
results of some research reviews [33] show that low self-esteem is associated with the risk
of both cyberbullying and cybervictimization, as conﬁrmed by a 2018 meta-analysis [34].
However, the authors themselves point out as a limitation that it is impossible to say
whether high self-esteem protects against bullying, or bullying is the cause of low self-
esteem. One of the more recent meta-analyses using the results of longitudinal studies
has provided stronger evidence, conﬁrming a negative association of being a victim with
self-esteem, but not conﬁrming the correlation of self-esteem with being a perpetrator of
cyberbullying [35].

In fact, a study of students in grades 6–12 in the US [31] provides even more complex
results. The participants were categorized as belonging to one of four groups: victims,
perpetrators, both perpetrators and victims, and those not involved in violence at all.
Students in the victim/perpetrator group, both online and ofﬂine, had the most negative
scores on most measures of mental and physical health, and academic performance. Self-
esteem was also at its lowest in this group. The most positive results were found in the
group completely uninvolved in violence. Surprisingly, however, no differences were
recorded in the groups of ‘perpetrators only’ and ‘victims only’ and students who belonged
to them had higher levels of self-esteem than the victim/perpetrator group (but signiﬁcantly
lower than the group not involved in any kind of violence). The results for traditional and
online violence were similar. This is an unexpected outcome, as one would presume that
the students who were only victims of cyberbullying would have the lowest self-esteem.
A recent study of the relationship of interest, conducted in Italy on a group of
13–16-year-old students, also tells a complex story [36]. Students classiﬁed as belong-
ing to a group with a self-derogation proﬁle were more exposed to being both a victim and
perpetrator of violence, online and ofﬂine equally. In contrast, high body- and peer-oriented
self-esteem signiﬁcantly increased the risk of engaging in problem behaviors such as mob-
bing. Finally, students with consistently high self-esteem proﬁles were more protected
from bullying/cyberbullying and victimization/cybervictimization behaviors compared to
students with a self-destructive proﬁle.

As in the case of self-regulation, research does not provide a clear answer to the question
of the impact of self-esteem on cyberbullying. While the relationship between being a victim
of cyberbullying and having low self-esteem seems to be well confirmed [8,37], the inﬂuence
of self-esteem on cyberbullying is not certain, although is likely.

Another predictor of cyberbullying is internal locus of control. The construct of locus
of control was introduced into psychology in the 1950s by Julian B. Rotter [23] and is
conceptualized as a generalized expectation of internal or external reinforcement control.
In other words, it refers to people’s beliefs about where factors inﬂuencing events in their
lives are located (i.e., inside or outside the subject) and whether they can be controlled.

Some studies have shown that people develop more internal locus of control with age,
but it seems more appropriate to treat internal and external loci of control as orthogonal
dimensions with different developmental trajectories [38]. Thus, internal locus of control
increases until middle age, while external locus of control ﬁrst weakens and then again
increases in adulthood.

Internal and external locus of control are predictors of many behavioral, cognitive,
and affective characteristics of an individual, including psychological well-being or job
satisfaction [39]. However, no meta-analysis on protective factors against cyberbullying
has found that locus of control matters [34,35]. Only isolated reports indicate the existence
of a relationship. For example, a study involving a group of Turkish adolescents found
that external locus of control was signiﬁcantly associated with both being a victim and
perpetrator of cyberbullying [40]. In contrast, in a Chinese population of elementary school
students, locus of control was proven to moderate the relationship between victimization
and the developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems. Children

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

5 of 34

who experienced higher levels of victimization and exhibited a concomitant external locus
of control were more likely to experience internalizing and externalizing problems [41].
These unclear empirical correlations suggest that research into the relationship between
locus of control and cyberbullying should be treated as exploratory.

The last of the constructs analyzed in terms of students’ personal resources is opti-
mism. In the 1990s, hope began to be viewed as a one-dimensional construct involving
the perception that certain goals could be achieved [42]. Dispositional optimism and pes-
simism are deﬁned as personality traits characterized by a tendency to expect positive or
negative outcomes in life [43]. Optimism has been linked to a wide range of measures of
psychological well-being and health [44].

Few studies have directly examined any association of optimism as a personality
disposition with cyberbullying. One of them is a study conducted on a large sample of
Spanish 10- to 12-year-old students, which explored whether victim and perpetrator roles in
cyberbullying are related to dispositional optimism [45]. The results showed that optimism
correlates negatively with violence when it came to being a victim and a perpetrator.

While emotional self-regulation can break the cycle of aggression by controlling nega-
tive emotions, it seems that optimism, with its expectation of a positive resolution of conﬂict,
can be a factor in reducing the likelihood of aggressive responses. An interesting study
indirectly illuminating this hypothesis was conducted on a group of Israeli adolescents [46],
revealing that the extent of exposure to armed conﬂict via the media was directly related to
psychological distress and post-traumatic symptoms. Dispositional optimism moderated
the relationship between traditional media exposure to war images and psychological
distress. However, in the case of social media exposure, none of the factors—including
optimism—were protective against negative effects.

The signiﬁcance of optimism in countering cyberbullying is indirectly conﬁrmed by
interventions aimed at combating traditional bullying which focused on various aspects
of well-being, and also on optimism; they have yielded positive results in terms of im-
proved coping with conﬂict [47]. Although the theoretical rationale and a small number
of studies [8] suggest a negative association between optimism and being a perpetrator of
cyberbullying, it is still an area of great uncertainty.

1.5. Social Skills and Cyberbullying

Social skills are a multidimensional construct that refer to the ability to integrate
cognition, affect, motivation, and behavior to succeed in social tasks and achieve positive
developmental outcomes [48]. They are an essential tool for appropriate human develop-
ment and the formation of satisfying interpersonal relationships [2]. They include several
related inter- and intrapersonal skills that can be organized into sub-dimensions, such as a
person’s ability to interact, cooperate, and communicate effectively with others, but also
the ability to be assertive, empathetic, and responsible [48].

According to research, violence is linked to the level of such social skills as empathy,
assertive behavior, cooperation, and responsibility [49–51]. Low social skills can cause a
person to be selﬁsh, indifferent, and lacking in empathy. This can give rise to various social
problems, such as aggressive behavior, coercion of will, destruction, intergroup conﬂict,
and ﬁghting [52]. In fact, studies by Barlinska, Lalak and Szuster, [53] Martínez, Rodríguez-
Hidalgo, and Zych [2] suggest that having well-developed social skills is protective against
bullying, including cyberbullying and victimization.

In broad terms, empathy is primarily an affective reaction in response to the situa-
tion of another, encompassing the ability to understand and vicariously experience their
feelings [54]. A distinction can thus be made between affective empathy (the ability to
perceive and feel the emotions of others) and cognitive empathy (the ability to understand
and anticipate the emotions and mental states of others by taking their perspective) [53].

Although research suggests that empathy may play an important role in cyberbul-
lying [55], the results of studies on the relationship between the two are inconclusive.
Martínez et al. [2], citing the results of meta-analyses, indicate that high levels of affec-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

6 of 34

tive and cognitive empathy are usually protective factors, while low levels of empathy
are a risk factor for cyberbullying [56–59]. The results of the study by these researchers
showed, however, that being a cyberbully was associated with higher affective empathy.
These inconsistent results can be explained in several ways—for example, it is possible
that perpetrators of cyberbullying understand, and even share, the feelings of others but
continue to hurt victims because it is related to their psychosocial proﬁle. They use their
high affective empathy to hurt and subjugate their peers, as part of their Machiavellian and
manipulative character [2].

Assertiveness is another important social skill, often discussed in this context, defined
as one’s ability to express opinions, feelings, and attitudes openly within certain limits. It
contributes to self-confidence, and better interpersonal communication and well-being [60,61].
Assertiveness and self-esteem are important factors in adolescence, playing signiﬁcant
roles in relationships and social interactions. Thus, assertiveness is a life skill that, if
mastered in adolescence, can help increase awareness of personal rights and distinguish
between assertiveness, submissiveness, and aggression. Research indicates that individuals
who exhibit assertive behavior tend to have higher self-esteem and are more successful
in life [61]. Some ﬁndings also suggest that being a victim of bullying (a cybervictim)
is unequivocally associated with low assertiveness. In contrast, being a perpetrator of
violence, including cyberbullying, is predicted by high assertiveness [2].

Cooperation is the joint effort of individuals intended to achieve a speciﬁc goal. It
occurs when two or more people work together to solve a problem or create something
that cannot be done by one person alone [49]. According to Man, Liu, and Xue [62],
student cooperation can result in a variety of outcomes, often being related to the extent of
pro-social behavior.

Pro-social behavior, on the other hand, is behavior intended to beneﬁt another person
or group of people; it is the ability to share things, help, and support others. The basic
condition for the emergence of pro-social behavior is the appropriate interpretation of
a situation, i.e., seeing another person’s need (empathy) and recognizing that it can be
met [63,64]. Empathy is often considered as an important motivating factor for proso-
cial behavior [65,66]. A study by Jenkins, Demaray, Fredrick, and Summers [67] found a
positive relationship between prosocial behavior and adolescents’ ability to cooperate. In
contrast, several other studies have pointed out that, for example, a school climate in which
competition and rivalry dominate provokes and escalates aggressive behavior in students.
In such an environment, violent behavior, including cyberbullying, is more common [68,69].
As Nasaescu, Zych, Ortega-Ruiz, Farrington, and Llorent [70] state, bullying and cyber-
bullying tend to create patterns of antisocial behavior. Thus, a cooperative environment
and friendly interpersonal relationships are factors needed to effectively reduce violent
behaviors, including cyberbullying [34,62].

Considering the above considerations, it is possible to hypothesize that anti-social
behavior and low levels of cooperativeness, in addition to low levels of empathy and high
assertiveness, will be predictors of cyberbullying behavior.

1.6. Peer Relationships and Cyberbullying

During adolescence, the ongoing separation-individuation process [28,71] results in
the relocation of important attachments from parents to peers [72,73]. Supportive peer rela-
tionships serve a protective function for an individual and contribute to a number of short-
and long-term beneﬁts, promoting the development of complex socio-emotional, cognitive,
and educational skills see review by [74]. In contrast, a lack of satisfying peer relationships
acts as a stressor [75], leading to long-term negative academic and psychopathological
consequences (for review, see [73]).

Empirical studies show, for example, that supportive peer relationships signiﬁcantly
reduce the risk of victimization among adolescents for review see [76]. The meta-analysis
conducted by Mitic et al. [74] estimates this effect at −0.27. Moreover, the protective func-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

7 of 34

tions of positive peer relationships relate not only to ofﬂine but also to online victimization,
although in the latter case the effect of the inﬂuence is smaller and estimated at −0.14 [74].
Although positive peer relationships reduce the chances of a person becoming a victim,
they do not prevent someone from becoming a perpetrator [76]. Research suggests that
perpetrators are not socially isolated and do not feel isolated [77]. Bullies tend to afﬁliate
with other aggressive adolescents [78], have reciprocal friendships, mostly among other
bullies [79], and receive affection from other bullies [80]. Therefore, it can be reasonably
expected that they may not feel they lack peer support. Such conclusions are supported by
the results of other studies [81,82]. However, results from previous research indicate that
poor perceived peer support increases the likelihood of involvement in the perpetration
of cyberbullying [83–87]. Given the mixed results of previous research on the role of peer
support in online bullying, we do not hypothesize about the relationship between the
two phenomena.

As previous research indicates that a perception of the quality of peer relationships
is associated with lower levels of being liked by others, although these relationships are
not strong [88,89], the fact that perpetrators are more often disliked may lead to their
worse perception of the quality of their peer relationships. Correlation studies suggest
that cyberbullies perceive more negative peer relationships among classmates than young
people not involved in cyberbullying. For example, they more often reported that students
at their school have difﬁculty getting along, were mean to one another, and picked on other
students [90]. Additionally, experimental studies found that teenagers exposed to rejection
and manipulation responded more aggressively than others who were included [91,92], and
that negative perceptions of one’s own peer status promoted increased levels of aggression
in response to negative feedback from a peer in a controlled laboratory situation [93]. In
this light, it can be expected that negative perceptions of peer relationships, indicators of
which could be the level of perceived rejection by peers or the level of being disliked by
them, will promote active cyberbullying behaviour.

Meta-analyses indicate that bullying victimization and perpetration correlate strongly
and that the experience of being bullied by others—both ofﬂine and online—is a risk factor
for the subsequent perpetration of bullying [9]. It is suggested that previous victimization
activates a mechanism causing an individual to tend violate social norms [94]. Another
mechanism contributing to the cycle of violence [95] may be motivation for revenge [25,96].
Research shows that individuals who are victims “are hypervigilant of potential threats
from peers and interpret benign or innocuous stimuli as a threat, thereby increasing
state-level anxiety” [97]. To minimize such anxiety, young people may tend to engage in
aggressive behaviour to protect themselves from additional victimization. In general, it can
therefore be expected that a perceived threat from peers can intensify the tendency to be
a cyberbully.

1.7. Problematic Internet Use and Cyberbullying

Cyberbullying takes place through the various means of information and communica-
tion technologies (ICT), so the way we use them provides a context for the analysis of the
phenomenon [21]. ICT have become an integral part of our lives, facilitating the acquisition
of data, communication, work, study, and entertainment. However, the boundary beyond
which we are exposed to their problematic use is increasingly being crossed [98–100].

Problematic Internet Use (PIU; otherwise known as Internet Addiction) has been the
subject of much research, although researchers neither agree on a single deﬁnition nor on
the diagnostic criteria. The World Health Organization’s International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, in its 11th edition, included only Internet gaming disorder as a new condition.
However, it did not address the broader concept of Internet addiction [101], even though it
is a multifaceted problem that goes beyond online gaming abuse and encompasses a variety
of online behaviors that impair normal functioning [102,103]. Compulsive thinking about
the Internet (Internet-related activities), excessive use of its resources, inability to control
the time spent online, and neglecting other responsibilities due to Internet use are taken as

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

8 of 34

hallmarks of PIU [104]. The symptoms are in fact similar to those of psychoactive substance
addiction, including withdrawal symptoms, unpredictable behavior, or mood swings [98].
According to a recent systematic literature review, Internet addicts are more likely
to be perpetrators or victims of violence and cyberbullying [5]. All the studies described
in the referenced article, involving adolescents between the ages of 11 and 22 from ten
countries and three continents, found a positive correlation between PIU and cyberbullying
(11 studies, two of which involved only victims of cyberbullying) and/or school violence
(5 studies). A meta-analysis by Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder, and Lattaner [8] estimated
the effect of frequency of Internet use on the likelihood of perpetrating cyberbullying to be
0.20, and slightly lower (0.17) for cyberbullying victimization. However, most of the reports
were from cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies verifying possible mechanisms of
inﬂuence may help determine the direction of the relationship.

Some researchers [21], in their attempt to explain the mechanism underlying the
relationship between PIU and cyberbullying, suggest that excessive screen time increases
one’s chances to interact with violent media content, which, according to social learning
theory [23], can result in increased aggressive behavior. The claims of this theory in
relation to cyberbullying are supported by contemporary research. For example, a large
longitudinal study involving Cypriot adolescents found that exposure to media violence is a
risk factor for cyberbullying perpetration and victimization [81]. The correlations obtained
in this study were not strong, but, importantly, they were determined when controlling for
prior levels of violence and cyberbullying and other control variables. The association of
exposure to media presenting content including antisocial and risky behavior with the use
of cyberbullying was also conﬁrmed in a Dutch longitudinal study involving adolescents
aged 11–17 [105]. This study additionally found that high exposure to violence in the media
translated signiﬁcantly higher into incidences of cyberbullying among boys than girls, and
among those with initially high levels of interaction with violent media content.

However, it is not always that more time spent online is linked to higher exposure
to violent media content. Therefore, alternative explanations of the relationship between
time spent online and cyberbullying have been proposed, which emphasize the relevance
of prior levels of aggression as an explanatory variable [106], suggesting that individuals
with higher levels of aggression spend more time online because it facilitates exposure to
aggressive content and engagement in aggressive behavior. A longitudinal study of Cana-
dian adolescents found that, when controlling for prior levels of cyberbullying, frequency
of Internet use was not a signiﬁcant predictor of the perpetration of cyberbullying [107].
Similarly, a longitudinal study of German students aged 9–17 showed that frequency of
Internet use was not a risk factor for committing and experiencing cyberbullying, but may
rather be a consequence of these [106]. On the other hand, a longitudinal study of the
problematic use of the Internet found that prior PIU predicts an increase in the committing
of cyberbullying, but that prior cyberbullying does not predict an increase in PIU [108].
This means that it is likely that it is not the amount of time spent online that is the risk
factor for an increase in cyberbullying, but rather the loss of control over when and how
digital technologies are used.

Another hypothesis of interest in this context is that Internet addiction leads to poorer
psychosocial functioning, translating into increased irritability, which can result in aggres-
sion [6,21]. Keles, McCrae, and Grealish [109], who performed a systematic review of
studies, found that time spent on social media, active use of social media and social media
addiction are signiﬁcant risk factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological distress.
Additionally, while these authors conclude that the problem is complex, they also stress
that a link between excessive social media use and mental health problems exists without a
doubt. Other studies also show a link between PIU and depression [110–112], substance
abuse [110,113,114], and higher impulsivity and aggression [112,115,116].

In light of the above ﬁndings, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that PIU, both in the
dimension of excessive use and irritability linked to Internet withdrawal, will be positively
correlated with the use of cyberbullying.

1.8. Research Objective and Hypotheses

The article focuses on the perpetration of cyberbullying, and the primary objective
of the study was to establish the determinants of a young person becoming a perpetrator
of cyberbullying. This is an important area of inquiry because, as shown in the literature
review, the empirical ﬁndings to date for some personal characteristics (self-regulation,
self-esteem, empathy, sense of peer group support) are inconclusive, and for others (locus
of control, optimism) there is far too little research data. Multivariate studies would seem
to be particularly important in this context.

An important contribution of the study presented here is the use of a new approach
to operationalize cyberbullying. Studies of cyberbullying lack a convincing standard in
this regard. Some researchers operationalize cyberbullying with a single global question,
although most use indicators that relate to multiple questions (a summary of studies from
this angle can be found, for example, in [4,8]). As Kowalski [8] notes, single-question
measurement of cyberbullying, as opposed to multi-question measurement, has a number
of serious limitations, such as the rather lower, though incalculable, reliability of the
measurement; the inability to take into account the multifaceted nature of the trait under
scrutiny and test its structure, and the fact that single-question indicators give lower
estimates of the level of cyberbullying, as people are less likely to give honest answers to a
global assessment heavily weighted with the label of ‘perpetrator’.

The studies also differ in terms of the reference period used in the questions for
the frequency of cyberbullying incidents (e.g., last 6 months, last school year). Since the
questions are retrospective in nature, a short period of time favors the quality of recollection;
on the other hand, a longer period reduces uncertainty related to possible changes over
time in the severity of cyberbullying.

Extremely important for the operationalization of cyberbullying is the determination
of the criteria for categorizing the respondent as a perpetrator. Often a classiﬁcation ap-
proach is used (cyberbullying index as a nominal variable), which involves the problem
of determining the cutoff point at which someone is assumed to be a perpetrator of cy-
berbullying [4]. A signiﬁcant problem with dividing respondents into perpetrators and
non-perpetrators using a cutoff point is that its determination is highly arbitrary [117]. In
addition, the problem with such an approach is that it loses sight of much of the variance in
respondents’ responses, especially when measuring cyberbullying in a multivariate manner.
Because of the well-documented, strong relationship between being a perpetrator
and being a victim, a challenge for operationalizing the phenomenon is to use a model
for analysis that helps separate the variance in the variable of being a perpetrator of
cyberbullying, mediated by being a victim, from the variance speciﬁc to being a perpetrator.
Past studies have typically addressed this problem by creating a nominal variable that takes
into account both aspects of cyberbullying [31,32,118,119]. This procedure is also loaded
with a reduction in the variance of the explained variable.

Another important methodological problem is the discontinuity of the phenomenon
under study. Cyberbullying studies using a multivariate approach typically show that the
distribution of raw or scaled measure results is far from normal and is clearly bivariate; a
sizable group of respondents declare no involvement in cyberbullying, while the remainder
differ signiﬁcantly in the frequency of their involvement in cyberbullying. The classiﬁcation
approach does not fully capture the diversity of the latter group.

Given the limitations of previous research, this study considers a very wide range
of characteristics so as to control for possible mediating effects and spurious correlations.
Predictors of cyberbullying perpetration are analyzed while controlling for being a victim
of cyberbullying and for the gender variable. A total of 14 independent variables (in
addition to gender and being a cybervictim) are included in the analyses, looking at the
determinants of cyberbullying from four different perspectives: personal resources, social
skills, peer relationships, and problematic Internet use. Few studies on cyberbullying have
simultaneously considered such a wide range of variables.

Cyberbullying was measured using a multi-item scale, the reliability and structure of
which were veriﬁed. In addition, the variability of the trait was not reduced to categories,
but two-part regression modeling was used, which allows for taking into account both the
incidence of the phenomenon (participated or did not participate in cyberbullying) and the
frequency of its occurrence (severity of the phenomenon). This helped us determine which
variables were particularly relevant to becoming involved in cyberbullying, and also which
were responsible for the frequency of violent behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst study to propose such a model for analyzing the determinants of cyberbullying.

The study is mainly exploratory, but in several cases prior research has helped us

formulate the hypotheses.

It is difﬁcult to make strong hypotheses when it comes to personal resources. In
the case of emotional self-regulation and self-esteem, arguments in favor of a negative
correlation with perpetration of cyberbullying dominate, and one can risk the hypothesis
that the two characteristics are protective factors (H1, H2). However, in the case of locus of
control and optimism, there are too few arguments to put forward a hypothesis. Therefore,
a research question was raised about whether these variables are signiﬁcant predictors of
cyberbullying at all (Q1, Q2).

In the case of the social skills investigated in the study, the state of knowledge to
date allows us to formulate the hypothesis that anti-social behavior and low levels of
cooperativeness, in addition to low-level cognitive empathy and high assertiveness, will
act as predictors of cyberbullying behavior (H3, H4, H5, H6).

When it comes to peer relationships, a review suggests that the level of perceived
rejection by peers and the level of disliking of classmates may foster cyberbullying behaviors
(H7, H8). Additionally, it seems that a perceived threat from peers will exacerbate the
propensity to become a cyberbully (H9). Given the inconclusive ﬁndings on the role of peer
group support in cyberbullying, a research question was posed as to whether cyberbullying
is related to peer group support (Q3).

The study speciﬁcally addressed the importance of the elements of the immediate
context of cyberbullying—that is, the selected aspects of problematic Internet use. Based
on a review of previous research, it was assumed that both excessive use and irritability
in the situation of Internet withdrawal would be positively correlated with the use of
cyberbullying (H10, H11).

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants, Procedure and Context of the Study

The research was conducted as part of the Ostroleka Educational Observatory project
implemented by the Faculty of Pedagogy of the University of Warsaw in cooperation with
the local government of Ostroleka (see: www.pedagog.uw.edu.pl/ostroleka/, accessed
on 26 October 2022), which is a city in central-eastern Poland with a population of more
than 50,000, with negative dynamics (5.2%, close to the average for small and medium-
sized cities in Poland) between 2002–2021. In terms of the education of the city’s adult
population (higher education 22%) and salary, the city ranks slightly above the national
average (according to the ranking Poland in Numbers. https://www.polskawliczbach.pl/,
accessed on 26 October 2022).

The town manages 28 educational institutions, including eight elementary schools (one
special needs school). The study population consisted of eighth-grade students (aged 14–15)
from seven elementary schools. The results of the end of primary school exams indicate
that in the schools surveyed the distribution of students’ achievements in mathematics was
very close to the nationwide distribution, and in Polish language it shifted slightly towards
high scores (according to data and a report by the Central Examination Board in Warsaw).
The size of the target population was 698. The study group thus represents nearly
78% of the target population (N = 541), with a slight overrepresentation of girls. The
study involved a local school population but given the demographic and educational

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

characteristics of Ostroleka it can be assumed that the results obtained are typical for
Poland. The characteristics of the respondents are shown in Table 1.

Data were collected in the spring of 2022 using computer-based online questionnaires
completed by each student during school hours in the presence of a trained interviewer.
The written consent of parents was obtained before the survey. Then students were asked
for consent. The project was favorably reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee at the
Faculty of Pedagogy of the University of Warsaw.

2.2. Measures

The tools used in the study are self-report scales. All but one (the Self-Regulation Scale)
are from the Battery of Social Functioning Questionnaires developed for the diagmatic sys-
tem for psychopedagogical diagnosis [120]. The content characteristics of the measurement
scales applied are presented ﬁrst, followed by the psychometric characteristics.

2.2.1. Cyberbullying Perpetration and/or Victimization

The measurement of cyberbullying referred to Willard’s concept [7] and included:
harassment (sending repeated, offensive messages), exclusion (excluding someone from a
group of friends), ﬂaming (an online ﬁght), outing and trickery (revealing private information
without someone’s permission), cyber-stalking (blackmailing someone by, for example, post-
ing compromising photos online), denigration (posting false information about someone’s
life), and impersonation (pretending to be someone in order to bring them into conﬂict
with others).

The study used two scales of perpetrating and experiencing cyberbullying from the
Disorders in Media-related Functioning Questionnaire [120]. Each consisted of seven items,
to which the respondents gave answers using a ﬁve-point scale ranging from ‘never’, to
‘four times or more’. Indicators of violence taking place in the private sphere were included
(experiencing cyberbullying: “How many times, in the past 6 months, have you received
abusive text messages from someone for an extended period of time”) and public (use
of cyberbullying: “How many times, in the past 6 months, have you posted disparaging
photos of a person on the Internet without their permission (e.g., on social media”).

2.2.2. Personal Resources

The Self-Regulation Scale (SRS) [121], speciﬁcally the Polish adaptation developed
by Gajda [122], was used to measure emotional self-regulation. The abbreviated version
of the emotional dimension of the SRS consists of 4 items (for example: “I have difﬁculty
controlling my temper.”) to which interviewees respond using a 4-point scale ranging from
1 (Strongly agree) to 4 (Strongly disagree). For the purposes of the analysis, the results
were recoded so that higher scores signiﬁed higher levels of self-regulation. The shortened
version of the emotional dimension of the SRS demonstrates reliability and validity indices
equivalent to the original longer (8 items) version compare Table 2 from [122].

The Individual Functioning Questionnaire [120] was used to measure self-esteem
(e.g., “I am pleased with myself”), internal locus of control (e.g., ”The effect of my work
depends mostly on how well I plan it”), and optimism (e.g., ”I will certainly achieve what I
want.”). Each scale consists of 4 items to which answers are given on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 (I disagree) to 5 (I agree). A higher score indicates a higher level of the trait.

2.2.3. Social Skills

Four social skills were measured by the Social Relationship Functioning Question-
naire [120]: prosocial behavior (4 items, for example: “I am happy to help if someone needs
it”), assertiveness (5 items, for example: “I usually say directly what I think”), cognitive
empathy (4 items, for example: “I easily recognize people’s feelings by looking at their
faces”), and cooperation skills (4 items, for example: “I am able to reconcile people in my
team who have quarreled”).

2.2.4. Peer Relationships

Peer group functioning was shown from the perspective of resources (feeling sup-
ported by a peer group) and deﬁcits (feeling threatened, rejected by peers, and having
negative attitudes toward peers). The Peer Support scale is derived from The Educational
Relationship Functioning Questionnaire [120] and consists of 6 items (e.g., “I can count on
my peers in any situation”) with a 5-point response scale. Higher scores indicate higher
levels of perceived support.

The Disrupted Peer Role Questionnaire [120] allowed for the measurement of feelings
(real or imagined) of being under threat from peers (5 questions, e.g.,: “At school, I am
often exposed to taunts from other students”), feelings of rejection from peers (4 questions,
such as: “In many situations at school, no one wants to cooperate with me”) and negative
attitudes toward peers, disliking them (5 questions, e.g.,: “I dislike many of my classmates”).
Answers are given on a 5-point scale from 1 (I disagree) to 5 (I agree). Higher scores indicate
higher levels of deﬁcit.

2.2.5. Problematic Internet Use (PIU)

Two PIU indicators were created on the basis of items from the Disorders in Media-

related Functioning Questionnaire [120]:

Excessive Internet use, measured with 5 items with a 5-point response scale (e.g., “I
often use a smartphone, tablet or computer instead of studying”), refers to the misuse of the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

13 of 34

Internet in terms of time, compulsive use, and loss of control over time spent online, with
the result that an individual’s life becomes dominated by or subordinated to the Internet.
Impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation, measured with 4 items on a 5-point
response scale (e.g., “I sometimes explode with anger when I can’t play on my smartphone,
tablet or computer”), refers to the loss of control over emotions when it is impossible to use
the Internet.

For both scales, higher scores indicate higher levels of PIU.

2.2.6. The Factor Structure and Psychometric Properties of the Applied Scales

A conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to conﬁrm the factor structure of
the dependent variable and predictors. The CFA was conducted on a polychoric correlation
matrix [123,124] using the weighted least squares with a mean- and variance-adjusted
(WLSMV) estimator [125] to account for polytomous items [126].

For each construct, we tested the (assumed) single-factor model [120]. The CFA results
were evaluated on three goodness-of-ﬁt statistical measures: (1) root mean square error of
approximation RMSEA—[127], (2) Tucker-Lewis index TLI—[128], and (3) comparative
ﬁt index CFI—[129]. According to the accepted rules [130,131], we assumed that a model
that is adequately ﬁtted to the data should be characterized by RMSEA values that are
equal to or lower than 0.08, and values of CFI and TLI higher than 0.90. The modelling was
performed using the R [132] package Lavaan [133].

Reliability was analyzed using an alpha internal consistence coefﬁcient (based on
the Pearson correlation matrix) and McDonald’s omega coefﬁcient [134] (based on the
polychoric correlation matrix). Simulation studies suggest that the alpha coefﬁcient under-
estimates true reliability unless the items are tau equivalent, i.e., that the factor loadings
are equal [135]. The latter coefﬁcient does not require the assumption of essential tau-
equivalence. Therefore, the omega coefﬁcient is deemed to be a practical alternative to
the alpha coefﬁcient in estimating measurement reliability of the total score [136]. Al-
pha and omega coefﬁcients over 0.70 indicate that the scale is reliable [137]. Both the
alpha and omega coefﬁcients were calculated using Lavaan [133] and the Bifactor Indices
Calculator [138], operating in the R environment [132].

The reliability of all the measures used in the regression analyses proved at least
satisfactory. Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency coefﬁcients ranged from 0.64 to 0.93
(M = 0.77). The omega reliability coefﬁcients were also within a satisfactory (range 0.63 to
0.93; M = 0.77). In addition, the results of the conﬁrmatory factor analyses showed a good
ﬁt of the data to the univariate models tested (although in some cases it was necessary to
correlate the residuals). In the ﬁnal models, the RMSEA did not exceed the value of 0.049,
while the CFI and TLI did not fall below 0.970. Detailed data are shown in Table 2.

2.3. The Plan of the Main Analyses

Due to the right-skewed distribution of the dependent variable (see Figure 2), two-
part regression modelling [139] was used in the analyses. This model allows for a better
understanding of the results when, for example, a signiﬁcant proportion of respondents do
not show the presence of a particular phenomenon (relatively low prevalence), e.g., alcohol
consumption, drug use, being a cyber-perpetrator, or bully victimization [140]. Generally,
this model allows us to check whether the predictors have the same or different effects on:
(1) the occurrence of a phenomenon (does not appear vs. appears) and (2) the frequency
of its occurrence. In the case of interest to us, the use of the two-part regression allows us
to check whether the likelihood of using cyberviolence and how often it is used may be
affected by other factors.

The idea behind the model is to simultaneously test the predictors of two forms of
the dependent variable: the dichotomous and the continuous. In the dichotomous part
(logistic regression model), we are looking for the factors that inﬂuence the occurrence or
non-occurrence of an outcome. In the continuous part, we are interested in predictors of
the intensity of the phenomenon of interest if it occurs—that is, excluding cases where the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

14 of 34

phenomenon does not occur [141]. This corresponds to the hurdle model [142], except that
the dependent variable does not have to be expressed as an integer—it can also be any
rational number.

In the model we used, the dichotomous part refers to the prediction of being the
perpetrator of cyberbullying regardless of its frequency and form (any use). The continuous
part was used to examine the factors that have an effect on the frequency of a person
becoming a perpetrator of cyberbullying, provided that the respondent declared that they
had been a perpetrator of at least one of the seven forms of cyberbullying. As shown in
Figure 2, nonzero values exhibit positive skewness. Therefore, in our analyses we decided
on log transformation of the data (in the continuous part of the model), which is the default
procedure used in Mplus [141].

Regression analyses were performed with Mplus 8.3 [143] using maximum likelihood
estimation with robust standard errors (MLR), which is more than classical maximum
likelihood estimation (ML), robust to violations of nonnormality and some forms of model
misspeciﬁcation, such as heteroscedasticity [141].

As is typical of studies conducted in the educational context, data in the present study
were hierarchical—children were nested in classes. To correct for potential bias associated
with class membership, we performed all analyses using the complex sample option in
Mplus, which takes into account any clustering of the data and thus helps to avoid bias
towards standard errors and test statistics [144].

The following Figure 1 shows a grid of explanatory variables (personal resources, social
skills, peer relations, and problematic Internet use) and control variables (cyberbullying
victimization, gender).

3. Results
3.1. Frequency of Cyberbullying and Its Various Forms

Preliminary analyses included calculating means (M) and standard deviations (SD) or
percentages, as appropriate, for all study variables, and Pearson product-moment corre-
lations between the key constructs. These analyses were performed using the apaTables
package [145] under the R environment [132].

An analysis of the students’ responses to the question about the frequency of their
use of the various forms of cyberbullying showed quite signiﬁcant variation (see Table 3).
For all seven forms of cyberbullying analyzed, a one-sample t-test was calculated to check
which of them was used signiﬁcantly more often than others, i.e., which of them differed
from the overall mean (the mean for all forms). Since for each form of cyberbullying the
score could range from 0 to 4, the overall mean could also take values in this range. In fact,
it was 0.35 (SD = 0.56).

The t-test for one sample revealed that two out of seven forms of cyberbullying,
i.e., harassment (M = 0.78, t(546) = 7.32, p < 0.001, d = 0.31) and exclusion (M = 0.61,
t(546) = 4.98, p < 0.001, d = 0.21) were mentioned more often than others. The severity of one
form (ﬂaming) did not differ from the overall mean (M = 0.41, t(546) = 1.44, p = 0.150,
d = 0.06), whereas four of the forms were indicated relatively rarely:
impersonation
(M = 0.11, t(546) = −11.05, p < 0.001, d = −0.47), denigration (M = 0.14, t(546) = −8.89,
p < 0.001, d = −0.38), cyberstalking (M = 0,14, t(546) = −8.94, p < 0.001, d = −0.38), and
outing and trickery (M = 0.25, t(546) = −3.02, p = 0.003, d = −0.13).

From the point of view of the statistical analyses, it is signiﬁcant that almost half of
the students (49.2%) declared that they had not engaged in any cyber-related activities in

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

the previous six months (Figure 2), as a result of which the distribution of the dependent
variable deviated signiﬁcantly from normal (t(547) = 0.291, p < 0.01).

3.3. Predictors of Cyberbullying

The two control variables (being a victim of cyberbullying, and gender) included in
Model 1 (Table 5 and Figure 3) signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the level of the dependent variable in
both the binary and continuous parts of the model. Being a victim and a male increased the
chances of not only being involved in at least a single episode related to being a perpetrator
of cyberviolence (the dichotomous part of the model), but also increased the number of
such episodes (the intensity of being a perpetrator; the continuous part of the model). At
the same time, a comparison of the values of the regression coefﬁcients indicates that, in
both parts of the model, being a victim was a stronger predictor than gender. Both control
variables explain a signiﬁcant portion of the variance in the dependent variable: 24% in the
dichotomous part of the model and 32% in its continuous part.

Figure 3. Model 1. Standardised regression coefﬁcients with 95% conﬁdence intervals. Note: Black
circle-coefﬁcient signiﬁcant at 0.05.

The inclusion of variables related to personal resources, social skills, and peer rela-
tionships in the next model (Model 2; see Table 5 and Figure 4) signiﬁcantly increased
the percentage of explained variance in both the dichotomous and continuous parts of
the model (up to 42% in both). Of the four personal variables—when controlling for the
other variables entered into the model—only emotional self-regulation was found to be
signiﬁcantly associated with being an offender. Negative beta coefﬁcients indicated that
higher levels of emotional self-regulation reduce both the probability of even a single
episode related to being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the dichotomous part of the model)
and the number of such episodes (the intensity of being a perpetrator; the continuous part
of the model).

In contrast, of the four social skills variables, two-prosocial behavior and assertiveness
signiﬁcantly translated into being a perpetrator of cyberviolence. Interestingly, while a
higher level of prosociality lowered the chances of being involved even in a single episode
of cyberviolence (the dichotomous part of the model), higher assertiveness increased the
likelihood. None of the variables describing students’ social skills translated into the
number of episodes associated with being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the continuous
part of the model).

A similar pattern of correlations occurred for variables related to peer relations. Again,
only two of them, peer support and dislike of peers, were found to be signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with being a perpetrator. At the same time, while disliking one’s peers was associated
with being a cyber-perpetrator only in the dichotomous part of the model, peer support
increased not only the chances of being a cyber-perpetrator but also the frequency of
such behavior.

circle-coefficient significant at 0.05; white square-coefficient insignificant (p > 0.05); tails = standard errors.

It is still worth noting that while being a cyber-victim remained signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with being a perpetrator in both the dichotomous and continuous parts of the model,
once the new variables were introduced, gender ceased to be a signiﬁcant predictor in the
dichotomous part while still signiﬁcantly interacting in the continuous part. When control-
ling for the variables describing personal resources, i.e., social skills and peer relationships,
male students were more often involved in cyberbullying acts.

In the next model (Model 3; Table 5 and Figure 5), the variable of excessive Internet
use was added. It proved to be a signiﬁcant predictor of a person being a perpetrator of
cyberviolence, although only for the dichotomous part of the model. In the continuous
part, a conﬁdence interval “hooked” to zero dictates caution. Overall, however, it can be
assumed that excessive Internet use translated into a higher probability of cyberviolence.
Notably, adding a new predictor to the model hardly changed the impacts of other
variables. When controlling for excessive Internet use, prosocial behavior still reduced
the chances of involvement in cyberviolence, whereas assertiveness, peer support, and
disliking one’s peers increased these chances.
In the dichotomous part of the model,
only emotional self-regulation (which in the previous model reduced the likelihood of
cyberviolence episodes) ceased being signiﬁcantly related to being a cyber-perpetrator.

The inclusion of a new variable (excessive Internet use) in the model also resulted in
relatively small changes in the continuous part of it. Being a victim of cyberviolence, being
a male, and emotional self-regulation were still signiﬁcantly associated with the frequency
of being a perpetrator. The ﬁrst two are risk factors, while emotional self-regulation is a
protective element. Compared to Model 2, only peer support lost statistical signiﬁcance.
Additionally, the variables included in the model explained 45% of the variance of the
dependent variable in the dichotomous part and 43% in the continuous part.

circle-coefficient significant at 0.05; white square-coefficient insignificant (p > 0.05); tails = standard errors.

Another Internet-related variable introduced to the ﬁnal model (Model 4; Table 5
and Figure 6) was ‘impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation’. As expected, the more
impulsive the reactions to Internet deprivation, the greater the likelihood of even a single
episode related to being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the dichotomous part of the
model). At the same time, impulsive response to Internet deprivation was not signiﬁcantly
linked to the number of episodes of being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the continuous
part of the model). Thus, Internet deprivation translated into being a perpetrator, but
not into the number of episodes associated with being a perpetrator of cyberviolence.
Signiﬁcantly, with the inclusion of a new predictor in the model, the variable of excessive
Internet use was no longer signiﬁcantly associated with being a perpetrator of cyberviolence
(dichotomous part).

The analysis of the results shows the importance of one more change in relation to
the previous model. In the continuous part, we found that feeling threatened by peers
reduced the involvement in cyberbullying acts in a statistically signiﬁcant way. This is
despite controlling for being a victim of cyberbullying (if not, the effect would be obvious:
victims fear peers).

Summing up, in the results of the last regression model test that involved a broad set
of independent variables, six variables turned out to be the risk factors for cyberbullying
(the dichotomous part), i.e., being a victim of cyberbullying, assertiveness, peer support,
disliking peers, and impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation. Only one predictor—pro-
social behavior—proved to be a protective factor.

Another Internet-related variable introduced to the final model (Model 4; Table 5 and Figure 6) was ‘impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation’. As expected, the more impulsive the reactions to Internet deprivation, the greater the likelihood of even a single episode related to being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the dichotomous part of the model). At the same time, impulsive response to Internet deprivation was not significantly linked to the number of episodes of being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (the continuous part of the model).

In contrast, four factors translated into the frequency of being a perpetrator of cy-
berviolence (continuous part). Apart from being a victim and a male, which increased the
number of episodes of cyberviolence perpetration, these were: emotional self-regulation
and feeling threatened by peers, which reduce the number of such episodes. The predictors
in Model 4 explained 47% of the variance in the dependent variable in the dichotomous
part and 44% in the continuous part.

4. Discussion

In the surveyed population of a medium-sized city in Poland, almost half of the stu-
dents in the eighth grade (49.2%) declared that they had not engaged in any cyberbullying
as a perpetrator in the previous six months, i.e., slightly more than half were involved
in at least one such episode during that period. An analysis of the students’ responses
to the question about the frequency of their use of various forms of cyberbullying shows
quite considerable variation. Two of the seven forms of cyberbullying, i.e., harassment and
exclusion, were mentioned more frequently than others. The level of intensity of ﬂaming
was not signiﬁcantly different from the overall average, while four forms were indicated
relatively infrequently, i.e., impersonation, denigration, cyberstalking, and outing and
trickery. Our ﬁndings with regards to the frequency of various forms of cyberbullying are
typical of the Polish adolescent population [118,146]. Notably, the types of online violence
included in the study are arranged on a continuum of private-to-public space, and their
placement is correlated with their declared frequency by the respondents.

The model testing the signiﬁcance of the control variables yielded two important re-
sults. First, it conﬁrmed the strong association between being a perpetrator of cyberbullying
and having a prior experience of being a victim. The effects for both zero-one cyberbullying
(the binary part of the model) and its frequency (the continuous part of the model) are

The analysis of the results shows the importance of one more change in relation to the previous model. In the continuous part, we found that feeling threatened by peers reduced the involvement in cyberbullying acts in a statistically significant way. This is despite controlling for being a victim of cyberbullying (if not, the effect would be obvious: victims fear peers). Summing up, in the results of the last regression model test that involved a broad set of independent variables, six variables turned out to be the risk factors for cyberbullying (the dichotomous part), i.e., being a victim of cyberbullying, assertiveness, peer support, disliking peers, and impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation. Only one predictor—pro-social behavior—proved to be a protective factor. In contrast, four factors translated into the frequency of being a perpetrator of cyberviolence (continuous part). Apart from being a victim and a male, which increased the number of episodes of cyberviolence perpetration, these were: emotional self-regulation and feeling threatened by peers, which reduce the number of such episodes. The predictors in Model 4 explained 47% of the variance in the dependent variable in the dichotomous part and 44% in the continuous part. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

signiﬁcant. This relationship also holds when a wide range of student characteristics are
included in the analysis models. This is another strong support for the Cyclical Violence
Model [18]. Second, the gender variable proved to be a signiﬁcant predictor of cyberbully-
ing. However, the model including the full set of explanatory variables showed that the
relationship held only for the frequency of cyberbullying acts with a higher occurrence
to be expected in boys. Engaging in cyberbullying itself vs staying away from it was not
linked to gender.

Within the group of constructs describing students’ personal resources, our analyses
showed that, when controlling for the variables of being a victim and gender as well as a
wide range of factors describing social skills and peer relationships, the only signiﬁcant
personal resource for engaging in cyberbullying is emotional self-regulation (H1). The three
other variables, including self-esteem, are not signiﬁcant predictors of being a perpetrator
of cyberbullying (H2, Q1, Q2). That is, the prediction of a negative association between self-
esteem and the perpetration of cyberbullying has not been conﬁrmed. An analysis model
that additionally considers the factors describing the immediate context of cyberbullying—
excessive Internet use and impulsive response to constraints (deprivation)—has conﬁrmed
the direct, protective effect of self-regulation, but indicated that it is more signiﬁcant for the
frequency of cyberbullying acts than for zero-one-deﬁned engagement in cyberbullying
(the latter effect was not statistically signiﬁcant). This is despite the presence in the model
of a variable describing an emotional indicator of Internet addiction-impulsive reactions to
Internet deprivation.

The protective effect of self-control conﬁrmed in the study is consistent with the
theoretical, even deﬁnitional prediction of its importance in inhibiting cyberbullying. If
the Cyclical Model of Violence [29] is accurate, such a result was to be expected. However,
doubts were already signaled in the introduction. Both the theoretical rationale (the
interaction of narcissism with self-regulation) and research ﬁndings suggest that high
self-esteem may be both conducive or unrelated to cyberbullying [18,28]. Additionally,
a recent longitudinal study [147] found that while compulsive Internet use preceded
the development of some aspects of emotion dysregulation, there was no evidence that
difﬁculties in emotional regulation were the cause of addiction. Admittedly, Internet
addiction is not the same as cyberbullying, but a certain afﬁnity of mechanisms would be
expected. However, the result obtained in this study should be taken as an argument for
the thesis that cyberbullying has a signiﬁcant emotional component [148].

Another result worth commenting on is the lack of a signiﬁcant relationship between
self-esteem and perpetration of cyberbullying, which is not entirely surprising. Although
the introduction tended to favor the thesis that high self-esteem is a protective factor, it
is worth recalling that a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies indicated a lack of correla-
tion [35], i.e., the result obtained in the study is not a rarity, but conﬁrms the lack of a direct,
straightforward relationship between self-esteem and cyberbullying.

Let us move on to social skills. The results of the study allow us to accept only some
of the hypotheses regarding social skills as predictors of cyberbullying behavior (H3–H6).
It turns out that of the four variables (empathy, assertiveness, pro-social behavior, and
cooperativeness), only two, i.e., assertiveness and pro-social behavior, are associated with
cyberbullying in each of the multivariate regression models tested (in the binary part).
High assertiveness is among the risk factors for such behavior, while prosociality turns
out to be a protective factor against cyberbullying. It should be noted, however, that our
study suggests that none of the variables describing students’ social skills translate into the
frequency of cyberbullying acts (the continuous part of the models).

The results obtained in our study regarding the association of two social skills with
cyberbullying are not surprising: both the effect for assertiveness [2,8] and prosociality are
consistent with the previous literature [34,62,68,69,149,150]. In contrast, we ﬁnd that the
lack of an association of cognitive empathy and cooperativeness with cyberbullying found
in this study is not clearly supported by previous research.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

Previous ﬁndings indicate that cooperative skills and friendly interpersonal rela-
tionships among adolescents are effective in reducing cyberbullying behavior [34,62,151].
Hence, the lack of a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between cooperativeness and cy-
berbullying yielded by the present study comes as a certain surprise and suggests the need
for further research.

Next comes empathy, an intuitive ability that has been associated with inhibiting
violence. Some of the literature considers low levels of affective and cognitive empathy to
be predictors of more frequent involvement in cyberbullying [34,152–154], but the results
of other studies suggest that perpetrators of cyberbullying exhibit higher levels of these
traits [2]. In contrast, the lack of a signiﬁcant relationship found in the present study is
consistent with the ﬁndings by Kowalski, Giumetti, Schroeder, and Lattanner [8] and Zych,
Farrington, and Ttoﬁ [34].

In fact, in order to explain the lack of a relationship between empathy and cyber-
bullying, reference can be made to the studies by Lockwood, Hamonet, Zhang, Ratnavel,
Salmony, Husain, and Apps [155]. They have demonstrated that when affective empathy is
too high, an individual ignores other people’s suffering to cope with their own emotions. In
contrast, as Kool, McGuire, Rosen, and Botvinick [156] note, engaging in cognitive empathy
is taxing on the brain, and studies show that individuals avoid cognitive tasks that require
high effort. Simply put, cognitive empathy is exhausting, and individuals decide whether
to invest in it before they engage in prosocial behavior [157]. Research clearly indicates that
the greater the number of individuals suffering (e.g., as a result of cyberbullying), the less
distress people feel and the less they engage in pro-social behavior [54], which our research
has shown to be a statistically signiﬁcant protective factor against cyberbullying.

In the case of peer relationships, higher levels of peer support increase the chances of
being a perpetrator of cyberbullying (Q3). This relationship proved statistically signiﬁcant
in each of the regression models in the dichotomous part.
In the continuous part, it
disappeared when the variables related to the problematic use of the Internet were included
(in the last two models). Therefore, our analyses conﬁrm the ﬁndings of some research [158]
to the effect that peer support can, by providing sense of security, push adolescents towards
risky behavior, including cyberbullying.

This suggestion is in line with some studies, which indicate that bullies are popular
among peers [159,160] and that peer groups perceived as highly popular tend to do a lot
of bullying [78]. Therefore, bullying may be explained by the high status it confers on its
perpetrators, which is something they aim for [161]. It might be speculated that the higher
social status of perpetrators associated with peer support and the growth of power that
perpetrators exert over their victims constitutes a prerequisite for bullying [162].

Notably, popularity is an indicator of admiration, reputation, social dominance, and
power but it is not synonymous with being liked. While liking is a dyadic construct,
reﬂecting an individual’s personal relationship with one of their peers, popularity is a
belief shared within a group [163]. Previous research shows that although perpetrators are
perceived (and perceive themselves) as popular, they are less liked and are expected to be
more disliked by their schoolmates than other children [161,164,165], and that bullying is
positively associated with a tendency to value being popular more than being liked [166].
These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that bulling is a way to achieve/maintain a dominant
social position, i.e., social status (popularity) associated with greater social power [167–171].
At the same time current research, contrary to our hypothesis (H7), indicates that
feelings of peer rejection are not associated with being a perpetrator (nor with cyberbullying
as such). One possible hypothesis explaining why perpetrators might not be viewing their
relationships with others as negative is that they hardly see themselves as rejected by their
peers (despite potentially being liked less than others) and that the social status they have
achieved is more important to them than their position in the affective network [166]. In
this case, popularity can compensate for the deﬁcit in likeability.

Moreover, our research shows that the perpetrators’ social support and not necessarily
negative perception of their own peer relationships are linked to evaluating other students

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

25 of 34

in their school more negatively. In line with our hypothesis, the research we have conducted
conﬁrms that for cyberbullying (but only in the dichotomous parts of each of the estimated
models), disliking one’s peers is a risk factor (H8). What matters, then, is not so much how
the offender perceives his position in the group (the cognitive aspect), but his dislike of peers
(the affective aspect), which may be a reaction to peer rejection [163,172]. Disliking a person
with whom one has to interact on a daily basis, such as a classmate, is psychologically
stressful [173], while aggressive behavior, especially at a heightened level of emotional
instability [174], may be a maladaptive coping style [175]. The fact remains that it is
resentment toward peers that proves to be one of the factors activating violent behavior.

Interestingly, the relationship between feeling threatened by peers and being a per-
petrator of cyberbullying took the opposite direction to that assumed in this study (H9).
When controlling for being a victim, gender, personal characteristics, interpersonal skills,
perceptions of peer relationships, and Internet use, higher levels of perceived threat from
peers reduce the extent and/or frequency of forms of cyberbullying used (although it does
not translate into the likelihood of being or not being a perpetrator of cyberbullying). It may
be that previous victimization causes retaliation, but with a relatively low level of activity.
Finally, our attention shifts to the variables introduced into the explanatory model that
describe the immediate context of cyberbullying, i.e., problematic Internet use (H10, H11).
Our analyses only partially conﬁrmed the hypotheses regarding the use of the Internet.
An excessive engagement with the Internet increased the likelihood of cyberbullying but
was not signiﬁcantly associated with the frequency of such behavior (the severity of the
problem). In addition, the relationship was no longer signiﬁcant when impulsive responses
to Internet deprivation were included in the explanatory model. Emotional control disor-
ders associated with the inability to use the Internet proved to be signiﬁcantly associated
with the likelihood of ﬁnding oneself in a cyberbullying space, but also failed to predict the
number of episodes associated with being a perpetrator. Thus, of the two variables describ-
ing problematic Internet use, only impulsive reactions to Internet deprivation proved to be
associated with committing online violence, and none of the variables analyzed translated
to the number of episodes of cyberbullying.

In the introductory section, it was noted that previous correlational studies have indi-
cated a weak positive association between problematic Internet use and being a perpetrator
of cyberbullying [5,8]. However, they differed from ours in that they failed to include many
important control variables, including being a victim of cyberbullying [108,110,176]. The
likelihood of experiencing cyberbullying is increased by the risk of problematic Internet
use [177], so it is probable that previous correlational studies that did not control for being a
victim of cyberbullying overestimated the importance of this group of factors for becoming
a perpetrator.

Our study has shown that excessive use of the Internet while controlling for the emo-
tional reaction associated with Internet deprivation is not associated with the perpetration
of cyberbullying, which is consistent with reports from longitudinal studies to the effect that
the amount of time spent online is irrelevant as far as the development of cyberaggression
is concerned [106,107]. On the other hand, it has been shown that impulsive reactions
to Internet deprivation promote the perpetration of cyberbullying. Note that impaired
emotional control in situations of Internet deprivation can be regarded as a manifestation
of impulsivity or lack of self-control, but they are also responses typical of an addict [98].
In our study, we controlled for overall levels of emotional self-control, so the latter track
seems reasonable. Some studies have shown that adolescents addicted to the Internet are
more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior [178]. However, others have found that common
neurobiological characteristics and mechanisms underlie Internet addiction and aggressive
behavior [115,116]. The inclusion of two indicators of problematic Internet use in the study
thus allowed us to see that the problem may be more complex. It may be particularly
important to distinguish between excessive Internet use and Internet addiction. Previous
studies have not been able to show these differences, as they included one general indicator
of this syndrome [108,110,176]. Considering the complexity of the phenomenon and the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

prior level of aggressive behavior could be an important direction for further research on
the determinants of cyberbullying associated with problematic use of digital technologies.
However, it should be emphasized that the effect obtained in the study had moderate
strength and was reﬂected only in the dichotomous part of the model.

The results presented also have practical signiﬁcance, suggesting the areas in which
psychologists, educators, teachers, and parents may become more aware and actively
involved in the prevention of cyberbullying. Because our research indicates that (1) being a
victim of cyberbullying is the most important predictor of being a perpetrator (cyberbul-
lying may therefore be a maladaptive response to problematic situations) and (2) being a
perpetrator is associated with the variables relating to emotional regulation in the broadest
sense (such as emotional self-control, assertiveness, resentment toward peers, or impulsive
responses to Internet use restriction), effective interventions aimed at reducing the intensity
of cyber-perpetration should therefore focus on the development of more adaptive styles
of anger expression [179,180]. In this context, a review of the available meta-analyses by
Lee and DiGiuseppe [181] indicates that “cognitive-behavioral and other approaches to
treatment of anger are comparable and at least moderately effective, with limited evidence
favoring relaxation treatments over other types” [181]. The training offered on the adaptive
styles of responding to problematic situations should not be limited to ofﬂine violence, but
it should also include violence and emotions occurring in the online environment [26]. It is
worth making parents and teachers aware that reducing teenager’s time online is not an
effective remedy against cyberbullying.

Finally, we come to the limitations of this study. First, the study population was
eighth-grade students in one medium-sized city, so its ﬁndings cannot be generalized to all
teenagers in Poland, even though the demographic and educational characteristics of the
city suggest that the study group was representative.

For testing causal hypotheses, an obvious limitation is its cross-sectional nature, so
any conclusions about causal relationships between the variables should be treated with
caution (hence the authors’ caution when it comes to using the language of causality).
However, it should be also remembered that 14 independent variables and two control
factors were included in the model describing the determinants of cyberbullying, which
certainly increases our conﬁdence in the relationships discovered.

Although the data analyzed meet the standards of psychometric quality, its short-
coming is that it is the result of using self-reporting tools. For constructs relating to the
feelings and opinions of respondents, this way of collecting data is natural, but when we are
interested in the behavior of individuals it poses a serious threat to data accuracy. However,
observational methods in the study of cyberbullying are extremely difﬁcult and using them
encounters barriers of time and high cost, which would radically limit the sample size and
the statistical power of empirical generalizations.

In terms of the potential factors responsible for cyberbullying that are absent from
the study discussed here, one must point out the lack of control of traditional aggression
and potential protective/threatening factors related to family and peer environments. The
family should certainly address methods of controlling an adolescent’s online behavior,
while the clues emerging in this study regarding peer relationships point to the need
to address group processes, e.g., by measuring sociometric popularity. A ﬁnal factor
absent from this study—which the authors believe is worth pursuing in future research—
is including the various dimensions of cyberbullying in its measurement, e.g., reactive
vs. proactive aggression, instrumental vs. hostile aggression, analogously to research on
ofﬂine aggression.

5. Conclusions

The survey found that in the population of students in the eighth grade (modal age 15)
of a medium-sized city in Poland, the prevalence of cyberbullying is signiﬁcant. Half of the
teenagers declared that they had been involved in at least one episode of cyberbullying as
a perpetrator in a six-month period. The most common form of cyberbullying was harass-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 5521

ment and exclusion, the least common were cyberstalking, denigration, and impersonation.
The study conﬁrmed that being a perpetrator is strongly correlated with an experience
of being a victim, and that the correlation is strongest across a broad set of psychosocial
characteristics of adolescents. This conﬁrms the validity of including cybervictimization as
a control variable in the analysis model.

The distribution of the multi-item cyberbullying index clearly showed the non-continuity
of the phenomenon. To adjust the analysis model for the fact that the study group broke
into two subgroups—those who shunned cyberbullying and those who engaged in it, albeit
with varying frequency—a two-part regression model was used. It allowed for avoiding
the need to omit some of the variance in the cyberbullying indicator inevitably associated
with the categorization of the dependent variable. The results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach. Some factors proved signiﬁcant in predicting that a teenager will remain
outside the cyberbullying space, while others predicted the frequency of violent acts once a
teenager was already in that space.

Our research, thanks to the simultaneous inclusion of a very wide range of charac-
teristics of adolescents, whose association with cyberbullying had been studied before,
provided an opportunity to detect the factors crucial to cyberbullying. Controlling for so
many variables in the model, including those directly linked to the context of Internet use,
made it possible to detect aspects that are directly, and not through the mediation of other
variables or the mechanism of apparent correlation, likely to affect cyberbullying.

In light of our ﬁndings, the hypothesis that an emotional component is crucial to
cyberbullying has gained even more support. This is indicated by the importance of
emotional self-control (frequency of cyberbullying), assertiveness, impulsive response to
limited Internet access (engaging in cyberbullying), and fear of peers (frequency). In turn,
the importance of pro-sociality (which inhibits engagement) and peer support (which
promotes engagement) points to a second important component of cyberbullying—namely,
group mechanisms. This is a clue that requires further research to clarify the social factors
responsible for this problem.

The introduction of variables related to problematic Internet use into the explanatory
model made it possible to show that, although the importance of Internet addiction as a
risk factor for cyberbullying should not be underestimated, the time spent online cannot be
seen as the main source of the problem.

The results obtained are of methodological signiﬁcance due to the use of two-part
regression for the statistical description of cyberbullying. Of theoretical importance is
the conﬁrmation of the relevance of the emotional control factor and its link to group
mechanisms. Finally, its practical relevance lies in pointing to emotional self-control
training as a promising form of reducing the severity of cyberbullying.
