Finding the cause of swollen lymph nodes involves the following:

- Your medical history.This includes how the swollen lymph nodes started and if there are other symptoms.

- A physical exam.This includes checking lymph nodes just under the skin to see where they are and how they feel, and how big, tender and warm they are.

- Blood tests.A complete blood count (CBC) and other tests can look for the cause of the swollen lymph nodes.

- Imaging studies.A chest X-ray or CT scan of the affected area might show sources of infection or find tumors. Sometimes, a mammogram might be used.

- Lymph node biopsy.A sample from a lymph node or a whole lymph node might be removed and sent to a lab for study.

The swelling of lymph nodes caused by a virus usually goes down after the virus goes away. Antibiotics don't help viral infections. Treatment for swollen lymph nodes from other causes depends on the cause.

- Infection.The usual treatment for swollen lymph nodes caused by a bacterial infection is antibiotics. Swollen lymph nodes that are due to an HIV infection will need treatment for HIV.

- Immune disorder.Treatment for swollen lymph nodes from conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis targets the cause.

- Cancer.Swollen nodes caused by cancer require treatment for the cancer. Depending on the type of cancer, treatment may involve surgery, radiation or chemotherapy.

## Preparing for your appointment


You'll likely start by first seeing your family healthcare professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

- Your symptoms and when they started.Include every symptom that you've had since your lymph nodes began to swell.

- What's causing my symptoms?

- What are other possible causes for my symptoms?

- What tests do I need?

- Can I infect others? How can I lower the risk?

- How can I prevent this from happening again?


### What to expect from your doctor


Questions your healthcare professional might ask include:

- Have your lymph nodes gotten larger over time?

- Are your lymph nodes tender?

- What, if anything, makes your symptoms worse?

### What you can do in the meantime
