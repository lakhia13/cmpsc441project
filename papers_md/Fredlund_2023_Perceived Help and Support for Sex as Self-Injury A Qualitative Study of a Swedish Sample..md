Abstract
Earlier research has found that sexual acts could be used as a means of self-injury, with comparable functions to nonsuicidal 
self-injury (NSSI) such as cutting or burning the skin. However, no previous study has investigated the experience of help 
and support in relation to sex as a means of self-injury (SASI), which this study aims to investigate. The study was based on 
an anonymous open-ended questionnaire published from December 2016 to April 2017 on the websites of NGOs working 
with help and support for women and youths in Sweden. In total, 197 participants (mostly women, mean age 27.9 years, range 
15–64 years) with self-reported experiences of SASI were included in the study. Three main themes were found concerning 
experiences of help and support for SASI. The need for: (1) Framing the behavior of SASI, to find a word for SASI—to know 
it exists, to get questions and information about SASI and its function; (2) Flexible, respectful, and professional help and sup-
port from an early age, to be listened to and confirmed in one’s experience of SASI; and (3) Help with underlying reasons to 
exit SASI such as finding one’s own value and boundaries through conventional therapy, through life itself, or through therapy 
for underlying issues such as earlier traumatic events, PTSD, dissociation, or anxiety. In conclusion, similar interventions 
could be helpful for SASI as for NSSI, irrespective of the topographical differences between the behaviors, but the risk of 
victimization and traumatization must also be addressed in SASI.

Introduction

What Is Sex as Self‑Injury?

In recent years, research has found that despite the topo-
graphical differences, sexual acts could be used as a means 
of self-injury, with comparable functions to nonsuicidal self-
injury (NSSI) such as cutting or burning the skin. However, 
no previous study has investigated experiences of help and 
support in relation to the phenomenon described in the lit-
erature as sex as self-injury (SASI).

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) was included as a suggested 
diagnosis in need of more research in the fifth edition of 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM 5). It was defined as self-inflicted damage to the sur-
face of the body without suicidal intention, with underlying 
motives of relieving negative feelings, resolving interper-
sonal difficulties, or inducing positive feelings (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013), and it often refers to behav-
iors such as cutting, burning, or striking the skin. NSSI can 
be considered a direct form of self-injurious behavior, while 
abusive relationships, substance use, eating disorders, and 
risky or reckless behaviors can be considered indirect forms 
of self-injury (Nock, 2010; St. Germain & Hooley, 2012). 
However, the co-occurrence of indirect and direct forms of 
self-injury is common, and the behaviors can overlap regard-
ing function and intention to cause direct injury to oneself. 
This might indicate that direct and indirect forms of self-
injury are related behaviors that could be on a psychopatho-
logical continuum (D’Agostino et al., 2020; Fox et al., 2019; 

Vol.:(0123456789)1 3

Jonsson et al., 2019). Emotional regulation and interpersonal 
functions are the most reported functions in relation to self-
injury (Cipriano et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018).

The use of sex as a means of self-injury (SASI) has been 
described in studies in Swedish context in recent years. SASI 
could share the same function as NSSI such as cutting or 
burning the skin, and the two behaviors could even replace 
each other (Fredlund et al., 2020; Jonsson et al., 2019). Both 
NSSI and SASI have been found to function as a means of 
emotion regulation, for example “to relieve feeling numb 
or empty,” “to stop bad feelings,” or “to punish oneself.” 
However, social functions such as “to try to get a reaction 
from someone, even if it is a negative reaction” and “to get 
attention” were more commonly reported for SASI compared 
to NSSI (Jonsson et al., 2019). This has also been described 
in qualitative research. SASI can be used to regulate negative 
emotions such as depression, anxiety, numbing, dissociation, 
poor self-esteem, self-hatred, or reexperiences of earlier trau-
matic events. SASI could function as means to get positive 
confirmation, to be seen and validated, or to feel good at 
doing something (sex). It could also function in means to get 
negative confirmation of a poor self-image and self-contempt 
that was confirmed in sexual situations by being beaten or 
mistreated (Fredlund et al., 2020). Even though SASI lacks 
a common definition, it has been described as sexual situa-
tions that can include both psychological and physical harm 
that is sought as a means of self-injury. The manifestations 
of SASI could be diverse, such as having sex with a person 
without any attraction or desire, or letting the other person do 
whatever he wanted with the body without feeling any desire. 
SASI could include behaviors such as having sex despite not 
feeling attraction or desire, having new sexual partners every 
evening, contacting older men through the Internet for whom 
there was no attraction or desire, exposing oneself to sexual 
or physical violence in sexual situations, or repeating experi-
ences of earlier sexual abuse by causing injury to one’s own 
genitals (Fredlund et al., 2020). Some have even described 
selling sex as a means of self-injury (Fredlund et al., 2018, 
2020; Jonsson et al., 2015), although other reasons are more 
commonly reported in relation to selling sex among youths 
(Fredlund et al., 2018). SASI has been found to often start 
during adolescence (Fredlund et al., 2020). In a study includ-
ing almost 6000 students from the third year of Swedish high 
school (mean age 18 years), 3.2% of girls and 0.8% of boys 
reported having used sex to intentionally hurt themselves 
on at least one occasion (Fredlund et al., 2017). In the same 
study, 11% of the adolescents with SASI also reported hav-
ing sold sex on at least one occasion. In a pilot study of a US 
collage sample, 12% reported to have used sexual activities 
to self-injure (Mellin & Young, 2022). SASI could lead to a 
vicious circle with more and more self-destructive and dan-
gerous sexual situations, including an increasing amount of 

violence and risk of victimization, which could be hard to 
break without help and support (Fredlund et al., 2020).

According to a review by Bresin (2020), behaviors such as 
NSSI, aggression, substance use, binge eating, and risky sex-
ual behaviors are all examples of dysregulated behaviors with 
short-term benefits and long-term distress and impairment 
that can be hard to control. These behaviors can result in harm 
to the patient that can be explained by similar ethology and 
helped by similar interventions (Bresin, 2020). Self-injurious 
behaviors are related to a variety of psychiatric conditions 
such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, 
posttraumatic stress disorders, dissociation, substance use 
disorder, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Cipriano et al., 
2017; Forbes et al., 2019; Kiekens et al., 2018a, 2018b), and 
strong associations have been found with earlier traumatic 
events, especially sexual abuse (Cipriano et al., 2017).

Sex as Self‑Injury and Sexual Abuse

SASI has been closely associated with experiences of earlier 
sexual abuse (Fredlund et al., 2017, 2020; Zetterqvist et al., 
2018). Risk factors for SASI in comparison to NSSI were expe-
riences of earlier sexual abuse, trauma symptoms of posttrau-
matic stress and dissociation, and a higher number of sexual 
partners (Zetterqvist et al., 2018). Earlier sexual abuse has been 
described as one reason for SASI to start, since SASI can give 
a feeling of control of the situation; it can be a way to regulate 
negative emotions or a way to punish oneself with regard to 
self-hatred after sexual abuse (Fredlund et al., 2020). Finkelhor 
and Brown (1985) described the long-lasting traumatic effects 
that can be seen after sexual violence in the Traumagenic 
Dynamics model. This model included the four traumagenic 
dynamics—traumatic sexualization, betrayal, stigmatization, 
and powerlessness—that are identified as the core psycho-
logical injuries inflicted by child sexual abuse (CSA), and are 
described as influencing the person’s self-concept, emotional 
state, and sexual relationships. Traumatic sexualization can 
explain sexual preoccupation, compulsive sexual behavior, 
and sexual aggression after CSA. It can also lead to negative 
attitudes toward sexuality and the body, sexual dysfunctions, 
and aversion to sex as an adult. Stigmatization is common after 
CSA, and is closely associated with shame, guilt, and a feeling 
of being different, which can lead to self-destructive behaviors 
including drug and alcohol abuse, criminal activity, prostitu-
tion, and suicide attempts. The betrayal in CSA may lead to a 
great need to regain trust and security, which in turn can result 
in impaired judgment about the trustworthiness of other people 
and a desperate search for relationships. It can also result in 
distrust, leading to isolation and aversion to intimate relation-
ships. The dynamic of powerlessness may lead to the need to 
take back control, which can result in reenacting the experi-
ence of abuse but also a desire to dominate others (Finkelhor 

1 3Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160

& Browne, 1985). These dynamics might be helpful when 
understanding SASI and the implications of interventions.

replace NSSI has been described as helpful, as has help with 
underlying mental illness (Lewis et al., 2019).

The association between earlier sexual abuse and later 
sexual risk-taking behaviors is well described in the litera-
ture, including increased risk of a greater numbers of sexual 
partners, a higher frequency of sexually transmitted infec-
tions, teenage pregnancy, selling sex, and younger age of 
sexual debut (Abajobir et al., 2017; Hailes et al., 2019; Lalor 
& McElvaney, 2010; Messman-More & Long, 2003; Scoglio 
et al., 2021; Senn & Carey, 2010; Steel & Herlitz, 2005). Child 
sexual abuse has been associated with compulsive sexual 
behaviors including sexual impulsivity, hypersexuality, out-
of-control sexual behavior, problematic sexual behavior, and 
sexual addiction (Slavin et al., 2020). Emotional dysregula-
tion has been found to be an important factor for sexual risk-
taking behaviors in relation to posttraumatic stress disorder 
(Weiss et al., 2019), and dysregulated emotional control has 
been found to explain the indirect relationship between self-
injurious behavior and sexual risk-taking behavior (Marraccini 
et al., 2019). As described earlier, SASI can be forced by the 
function of the behavior and can include sexual risk-taking, 
including sex with poorly known partners and sexual situa-
tions including physical and sexual violence. Hence, this can 
increase the risk of further victimization and might be one 
reason for the association between earlier sexual abuse and 
later sexual risk-taking behaviors and revictimization.

Sex as Self‑injury, and Help and Support

A recent interview study investigating the connections 
between child sexual abuse, disclosure, and self-injurious 
thoughts and behaviors found that self-injury was a way to 
cope with the experience of abuse, end victimization, and 
deal with the self-hatred and loneliness associated with the 
sexual abuse. Negative disclosure experiences can result 
in increased self-injury (Collin-Vézina et al., 2021). To 
our knowledge, experiences of help and support regarding 
SASI have not been studied previously. However, a system-
atic review has been carried out concerning experiences of 
professional care and support among persons with NSSI. 
Important factors described were healthcare professionals 
who were competent, supportive, and prepared to listen, and 
who provided satisfactory treatment. The person needed to 
be respected, seen, and heard, which gave them confidence 
and helped them to make progress. Staff needed to be under-
standing, non-judgmental and encouraging, proactive, and 
competent. Continuity was also important, and therapy was 
vital. Negative experiences from health care that discourage 
people from seeking help might accelerate self-injury (Lind-
gren et al., 2018). Recovery from NSSI has been described 
as a process that might not have a definitive endpoint, but 
building up resilience by developing other skills that can 

Barriers to seeking health care and disclosure have been 
studied for sexual violence, such as in sexual exploitation, 
and can include stigma, feelings of shame, and worries about 
negative reception from professionals (Barnert et al., 2017). 
Symptoms of PTSD are the most common reason for seeking 
health care after sexual abuse (Amstadter et al., 2010), but 
other psychiatric problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, 
anxiety, depression, and pain are also common reasons for 
seeking health care in relation to sexual abuse (Rajan et al., 
2017). Help and support for the psychological effects of 
sexual abuse are often delayed; in a Swedish study, the aver-
age time before seeking help was found to be 15.9 years for 
victims of sexual abuse (Rajan et al., 2021).

In conclusion, the phenomenon of SASI is a relatively new 
field of research that has been studied in Swedish contexts 
that share common functions with NSSI. SASI is closely con-
nected to earlier experiences of sexual abuse and is a behavior 
that might increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, 
unwanted pregnancies, and further traumatization and vic-
timization. In the literature, there are studies investigating 
help and support in relation to sexual violence and NSSI, but 
there is currently a lack of knowledge concerning experiences 
of help and support regarding SASI. It is important to under-
stand how help and support can be modeled and experienced 
in relation to SASI, and whether similar interventions could 
be used for SASI as for NSSI or sexual violence.

Aim of the Study

The aim of the study was to increase the understanding of per-
ceived help and support for persons with experience of SASI. 
There were three research questions, investigating how persons 
with SASI experience help and support:

•  What kind of help and support is perceived as helpful 

versus not helpful?

•  What is helpful in the exit process?
•  How can sufficient professional support be structured 

regarding SASI?

Method

Participants

The study used a qualitative design and was based on an 
open-ended questionnaire. In total, 197 participants with self-
reported experience of SASI were included in the study. Data 
were analyzed following the six steps for inductive thematic 
analysis described by Braun and Clarke (2006).

Participants were recruited to the study during the period 
December 2016–April 2017 via advertisements published 
on the websites of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
such as women’s shelters or NGOs supporting women’s 
and young people’s sexual or mental health. The study was 
advertised as follows: “Do you have experience of sex as 
self-injury and are over 15 years of age? Do you want to 
participate in an anonymous questionnaire-based study in 
order to increase understanding of SASI and improve help 
and support? Click on this link.” In total, 37 NGOs from 
all parts of Sweden agreed to publish the link to the study. 
The NGOs were chosen in view of earlier findings indicating 
that adverse events are common among persons with experi-
ence of SASI, and the study group was therefore expected to 
visit these kinds of websites (Fredlund et al., 2017). To be 
included in the study, participants had to have self-reported 
experience of SASI and be 15 years of age or older, since 
according to the 2003 Swedish Ethical Review Act, consent 
is not required from parents when participants are 15 years of 
age or older. The questionnaire was answered anonymously 
in view of the sensitive topic, and in the introduction to the 
questionnaire a definition of SASI was presented as having 
“Repeatedly sought sexual situations that have caused you 
physical and/or mental harm and that have affected you in 
your life.” To collect the answers, web-based survey soft-
ware—Artologik Survey and Report, procured by Linköping 
University (Artologik, 2021)—was used.

In total, 199 participants (190 women, four men, four peo-
ple with non-binary gender identification, and one person 
with unknown gender) answered the questionnaire, but 197 
were included in the analysis since two women did not answer 
the questions concerning help and support. The age range 
for the participants was 15–64 years, with a mean age of 
27.9 years (SD = 9.3). SASI had started during adolescence 
for most of the participants (85.4%).

Measure

The questionnaire was written in Swedish and included 12 
open-ended questions that were specifically designed for the 
study. The questionnaire was tested in a pilot study including 
five informants in October 2016. The pilot study participants 
requested more precise follow-up questions, and the question-
naire was amended accordingly. The questionnaire included 
open-ended questions concerning coping strategies for nega-
tive feelings, experiences of sex as self-injury, and the reasons 
why SASI started, continued, and stopped, and can be read in 
full (see Fredlund, 2019). The questions concerning experi-
ences of help and support and reasons for exiting SASI were 
formulated as follows: (1) If you have stopped, what made 
you stop? (2) What experiences do you have of help and sup-
port when you had sex as self-injury? (3) What did you want 
regarding help, support, and treatment from health care or 

other organizations working with help and support when you 
had sex as self-injury?

Data Analysis

Thematic analysis followed the six steps described by Braun 
and Clarke (2006). The data set was first read and re-read 
several times to become familiar with the data by the two 
authors. Initial codes were generated throughout the data 
set and themes were identified by sorting and re-reading 
the initial codes and the data connected to the codes. The 
themes were checked in relation to the coded extracts and 
the total data set, and were processed again to be redefined 
and clarified into more distinct themes with regard to internal 
and external homogeneity. Themes were strengthened using 
quotations in the written text and presented in a coherent 
pattern. The NVivo 12 Pro software was used as support 
for the analysis and to keep track of the citations used. The 
coding and thematization of the total data set were carried 
out by the first author (CF), and triangulation was conducted 
by the last author (LJ) by both researchers coding parts of 
the data separately, enabling discussion and comparisons 
of coding categories and coherence. A coding protocol was 
used to keep track of decisions and to map the path toward 
the themes. Decision trails were kept ensuring the accuracy 
of the coding during the process. To gain validity or trust-
worthiness in relation to the coding, different strategies have 
been used. The first author started coding and developed the 
code book. After that the two authors independently coded 
part of the data and the results were compared. Thereafter 
the codebook was adjusted, and some codes were merged, 
some erased and some added. During the further analysis and 
thematization, a throughout discussion took place and the 
themes and subthemes were named and renamed until both 
authors were satisfied with the results. Quotes were picked 
out and the original data file revisited before everything was 
finalized.

The length of the answers varied considerably from one  
participant to another, consisting of between a few words per 
question and half a page. All the included informants contrib-
uted at least one coded extract to the analysis. All answers 
were written in Swedish, and the quotations were translated 
into English for the article with the support of professional 
translators in dialogue with the researchers.

Results

Three main themes were identified in relation to experiences of 
help and support for SASI in the study: (1) Framing the behavior 
of SASI, (2) Flexible, respectful, and professional help and sup-
port from an early age, and (3) Help with underlying reasons to 
exit SASI—see Table 1. An additional important finding, not

related to the study question, was that 137 out of 197 participants 
reported having received no or unsatisfactory help and support 
regarding SASI and has to be investigated in further research.

I wanted it to hurt more. If someone had explained 
to me why I did it, I probably wouldn’t have had as 
much guilt.”

Framing the Behavior of Sex as Self‑Injury

To find a word for SASI—to know it exists was the most fun-
damental need in order to receive help and support for SASI. 
Because without a word for SASI, it was hard to frame the 
behavior with regard to the function, it was hard to ask for 
help and support, and it was hard to receive proper help and 
support. The informants described how it could take time 
to understand that the sexual act was destructive and that 
it was a form of self-injury. A 22-year-old woman (Ax150) 
described her experiences as follows:

“It became like a compulsion and an addiction. First 
because I did not understand that it was destructive, 
and later because I could not stop. I tried to sign a con-
tract with myself. Use all the strategies I used to stop 
cutting myself. But I could not resist. The shame also 
contributed. Although I have been in therapy for the 
last few years, I did not dare to talk about this. I was so 
ashamed. I was sure my therapist would hate me, think 
I was disgusting, and throw me out if I told her. […] I 
could not ask for help.”

The behavior included severe feelings of shame and guilt, 
which made the informants unwilling to talk about the behav-
ior, but finding a word for SASI was helpful in terms of reduc-
ing the shame and guilt. A 15-year-old girl (ax177) wrote:

“If I had sought help, I would have wanted to meet 
someone who explained that sex as self-injury was 
a thing. I didn’t know why I did what I did, I just 
wanted it to stop while I wanted it to continue, while

To be asked about SASI was frequently described as desir-
able by the informants, especially that the question should 
be asked within a healthcare context and in relation to other 
kinds of self-injuries. This desire was expressed by a 28-year-
old woman (Ax110) as follows: “First of all, I wish someone 
had asked me/talked to me about this, because I had several 
other self-injurious behaviors. I needed help to understand 
that this could also be self-injury.”

Informants experienced that not being asked about SASI 
increased their shame about the behavior, but it sometimes 
took time to be ready to talk about the behavior. Informants 
described that the first time the question was asked, the 
person might not be ready to talk about the behavior, but 
the question concerning SASI needed to be asked repeat-
edly. A 27-year-old woman (Ax84) wrote: “I wish someone 
had just asked at all. I also wish I had been asked several 
times. I would have liked to talk to someone about it, to 
have turned to someone who understands what it’s about.”
Informants even believed that just being asked about 
SASI by healthcare workers and putting SASI into words 
could be helpful for leaving the behavior. A 33-year-old 
woman (Ax47) wrote about her desire for help and support:

“To help me understand that I had an unhealthy rela-
tionship with sex. I had contact with psychiatric care 
throughout this whole period. The question could 
have been asked. Then it might not have had to last 
for so many years.”

Informants had experiences of long-term contact with psy-
chologists, psychiatric clinics, or other parts of the healthcare 
system, but had never been asked questions related to SASI. 
Informants described that they had tried to talk about SASI 
with their caregivers but had not been listened to or under-
stood. A 35-year-old woman (Ax46) wrote:

“Mentioned it to several different therapists over the 
years, and was just met with silence and it was not 
something that we ever talked about again. Therefore, 
I did not dare to tell my last therapist until after two 
years when I had stopped doing it myself. Experi-
enced peace and security, and was able to let it go for 
good after that.”

To get knowledge and information about SASI and the 
function of the behavior were described as important to 
be able to leave the behavior, but informants found it hard 
to find a professional care unit with knowledge regarding 
SASI. Informants even described experiences of encounter-
ing ignorance within health care regarding the function of 
SASI. This was described by a 28-year-old woman (Ax63):

1 3154 

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160

“I wish the psychologist I went to for several years 
had understood and listened to me, heard the warning 
signs and talked to me about this. Everything was just 
to be medicated away, but it led to me living even more 
destructively. I wish they had talked to me about this, 
to turn bad feelings, panic, and traumatic stress toward 
oneself, that self-injurious behavior could take different 
forms and so on.”

However, other areas of society also needed to address 
SASI to break the taboo and shame. A 30-year-old woman 
(Ax170) wrote: “Would never dare to talk about it. The 
stigma and taboo are too great. Society needs to talk about 
it. That it exists.”

Flexible, Respectful, and Professional Help 
and Support from an Early Age

Respectful and professional contact with health care was 
described as important for the informants. To be confirmed 
and seen was the most crucial aspect of contact with a person 
with experience of SASI—not only within health care and 
with therapists, but also in other parts of society. The inform-
ants described that they wanted to be treated with respect 
and understanding. They wanted to be listened to, to be seen, 
and confirmed in their experiences. They wanted to be taken 
seriously, and for the person to believe in them. A 24-year-
old woman (Ax111) wrote: “If I had sought help, I would 
have liked to be met with understanding and someone who 
listened.” Another 33-year-old woman (Ax156) described 
it as follows:

“I had wanted to talk to someone who was more under-
standing and did not look at me as if I was crazy and 
awful. Someone who could help me to sort through my 
feelings and not just make me feel awful.”

Shame and self-blame were common in relation to SASI, 
and were important reasons for not talking about SASI and 
hence not getting help. However, experiences of caregivers 
blaming the person and giving her more shame and guilt were 
also described. A 27-year-old woman (Ax122) described her 
experiences as follows:

“I have not received help. If I spoke about it in situa-
tions that involved seeking help, people looked at me 
strangely and seemed to think I should blame myself. 
Including at the women’s shelter. They do not think 
that the men did anything wrong, even though there 
was very serious and dangerous violence at times, 
such as strangulation. The attitude I usually encounter 
is that I should blame myself for getting myself into 
it. Including within psychiatry. But the most common 
thing in psychiatry is that they just do not understand 

that it is a problem for me, even though I have often 
tried to make them understand. They think I have 
the right to do as I please. And then I stop talking 
about it.”

Caregivers needed to remain professional and deal with 
their own feelings and reactions in relation to what were 
sometimes very traumatic life stories from persons with 
SASI. A 55-year-old woman (Ax65) wrote: “My counselors 
and psychologists cried when I talked about my life story, 
and I never felt any support.”

To receive help early on, during childhood was a recur-
rent theme among the informants in relation to SASI. 
Most of the informants had started to use SASI during 
adolescence, while aged 12–19, and the informants found 
it important to get help at this age. A 27-year-old woman 
(Ax75) expressed this desire as follows: “That the staff at 
the youth clinic would have seen my patterns and dared to 
ask. I was there more than once a week for various tests.” 
Another 27-year-old woman (Ax163) wrote:

“I wish someone had noticed me as a child and could 
have stopped it then. I had early sexually risky behavior 
(and other things as well) that was visible. Neverthe-
less, no report was made to social services. If someone 
had dared to pay attention to me and protect me, it might 
never have had to be that way. Then maybe I would 
have felt well enough not to be attracted by destructive 
behavior. I have been raped so many times that I cannot 
keep count. I wish it could have been stopped before it 
happened. Back when I was a child […].”

Informants said that it was important to ask about SASI 
not only within healthcare contexts, such as child and adoles-
cent psychiatry, and youth clinics working with sexual health, 
but also within school health, social services, and other ser-
vices working with young people. It was suggested that sex-
ual relationships, consent, and SASI should be discussed in 
school lessons. A 19-year-old woman (Ax115) wrote: “First 
of all, shame must be removed. You are shamed for allowing 
yourself to be exploited. Schools need to talk on a broader 
and deeper level about sex, sex as self-injury, consent, etc.”
The need for flexibility in help and support for SASI was 
important. This involved issues such as the need to offer 
female therapists (since dealing with men could trigger 
memories of earlier traumatic events), the need for ano-
nymity (such as receiving online support), and the need for 
continuity and not being sent from person to person to get 
a feeling of security. A 28-year-old woman (Ax180) wrote:

“I have tried to seek help many times, but I have only 
been sent to person after person. I’ve had to tell my 
story easily 30 times to completely different people, 
and then I have not received any help anyway or then 
they have realized that they do not have the skills to 

1 3Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160 

155

help me, so they send me on once again to someone 
else […].”

Respondents described a need for accessible care with 
drop-in appointments, which might not be limited to daytime 
hours, such as internet forums and support. Knowing that 
there are others with SASI was also found to be helpful, and 
was suggested to be achieved via group therapy, help organi-
zations, or online forums. A 39-year-old woman (Ax113) 
wrote:

“I told the healthcare workers that I had been sexually 
exploited, sexually assaulted, and raped, but said that 
I did not want to go into detail and did not want to tell 
them more. What I wished for was to have been given 
advice about a forum where you can be anonymous and 
read how others have handled the situation, and maybe 
then I would had dared to start talking about it.”

A 34-year-old man (Ax149) wrote:

“The years I devoted myself to this I had no support at 
all. I sometimes looked for information online. It gave 
me the impression that there is not much help avail-
able. After I sought care that consisted of conventional 
group therapy, it was very valuable to realize that I 
was not alone in this. To share one’s own experiences 
with others who can relate to them has been the key to 
healthy sexuality.”

Help with Underlying Reasons to Exit Sex 
as Self‑Injury

Finding one’s own value and boundaries was an important 
factor for leaving SASI. Poor self-esteem, self-hatred, and 
self-contempt were common reasons for SASI. The inform-
ants asked for help to find their own value and boundaries 
to be able to leave SASI, as well as help with other underly-
ing reasons for SASI. A 25-year-old woman (Ax117) wrote: 
“Above all, I was helped to realize my own value as a person 
and an individual. I was helped to put my feelings into words 
and to stay in the anxiety instead of numbing the pain inside.” 
A 27-year-old woman (Ax101) wrote:

“I had wanted to be supported by the counselor. For her 
to tell me it was not my fault, that only I have the right 
to my own body, and for her to try to help me to report 
my perpetrator. Maybe I would never have started using 
sex as self-injurious behavior if I had received that 
help then. I had wanted help with setting boundaries, I 
couldn’t do it by myself.”

Finding their own value and boundaries could be achieved 
in different ways, such as through therapy, but another 
common theme was that the person had entered a stable 

relationship or met a partner who helped her to find her value 
and boundaries. A 25-year-old woman (Ax130) wrote: “I met 
a partner who appreciates me and makes me look at myself 
as an individual. Someone who deserves to decide for myself 
about my sexuality. As well as many hours of therapy.”

Life events as turning points were often described as occa-
sions when the person realized that she must stop or find a 
way out of SASI. This could involve meeting a stable partner, 
getting into therapy, having children, simply growing older, 
improving her mental health, or her secret life of SASI being 
revealed. A 28-year-old woman (Ax180) wrote about her 
reasons for stopping using SASI as follows:

“That I met my current boyfriend and partner. He ques-
tioned my approaches, and when he saw that I did not 
want to. He has followed me and paid for therapy so 
I will feel better. He has been a huge support for me, 
and would never have sex with me if he knew I didn’t 
want to. He himself has stopped several times when he 
noticed that I was not committed, and encouraged me 
to say no when I don’t want to.”

A 27-year-old woman (Ax101) wrote: “I found the 
strength to quit when I got older and made better friends. 
I felt better myself and began to understand my own value 
better. I think it was a lot about getting older.”
A 25-year-old woman (Ax108) wrote:

“I became pregnant and felt that my child did not 
deserve that treatment. I did not think she deserved to 
be hurt, it was just me who would be hurt. My body 
was no longer just mine, so I couldn’t subject it to bad 
treatment.”

Another turning point could be “reaching the bottom” of very 
poor mental health, in the form of either a suicide attempt or a situ-
ation where the person was raped or badly abused during SASI. 
A 20-year-old woman (Ax1) wrote: “After trying to kill myself, I 
had to see a psychologist. That was where things turned around. I 
found peace and understanding for myself on a whole new level.” 
A 24-year-old woman (Ax111) wrote: “After I was raped, it was 
as if I had had enough and decided that now it should be enough.”
Avoiding situations that could trigger SASI and instead 
being in environments that respected the individual’s value 
and boundaries were also described as turning points for 
leaving SASI. This could involve not having sex with men 
and having sex with women instead, not drinking alcohol, 
making new friends with different views about sex, avoiding 
the internet, or stopping having sex entirely. A 26-year-old 
woman (Ax70) described how SASI stopped for her:

“Better living conditions. I got a job that I managed 
to do well, and became popular. A little better men-
tal state that meant that even though I can’t feel it 
emotionally, I can admit intellectually that I deserve 

1 3156 

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160

better. Because I can see that, I avoid all situations 
where I can fall back, and I have realized that I have to 
isolate myself to some extent until I can really value 
and respect myself. I cannot trust myself to make wise 
decisions in vulnerable situations, and therefore I 
must not be in such situations.”

A 23-year-old woman (Ax197) wrote: “I fell in love with 
a girl when I was 16. Since then, I have gradually stopped. 
Partly because I stopped having sex, but also because I have 
started being with girls instead of boys.”

Informants found it important to be seen and helped by 
family and friends. A 28-year-old woman (Ax33) wrote: 
“A close friend realized what was going on and made me 
understand what I was doing, which helped me stop. But I 
also got a steady partner.”

Conventional therapy and help with underlying reasons 
for SASI were the most important kind of help and sup-
port informants had received or wanted to receive from 
health care. Different forms of therapy were described as 
helpful, such as trauma therapy, therapy for self-injury, or 
simply conventional therapy. Getting therapeutic help and 
help with the underlying causes—such as traumatic expe-
riences, posttraumatic stress syndrome, poor self-esteem, 
dissociation, anxiety, sleeping problems, need for confir-
mation, emotional regulation, and self-injury—were found 
to be desirable and helpful. A 40-year-old woman (Ax119) 
wrote: “I have tried to cut down on it because I have real-
ized that it injures me. But it is hard!! Because I have to find 
another channel for anxiety relief that does not injure me.”
Earlier traumatic events were frequently described as 
underlying reasons leading to the use of SASI. A 17-year-
old girl (Ax87) wrote: “I would have liked more compe-
tent psychologists and doctors who had been educated 
that young people who have been raped often do this to 
themselves.” A 20-year-old woman (Ax83) wrote: “No, I 
have not stopped. But I think if I can start and complete the 
PTSD therapy I have been offered, I can process everything 
enough to find myself again.”

Some had experiences of dialectical behavior therapy 
(DBT), which is often used for borderline personality dis-
order, suicidal ideation, and self-injury. Some had found it 
helpful, but others had never been able to talk about SASI 
in therapy. A 24-year-old woman (Ax30) wrote about her 
experiences of help and support: “None at all. I have been 
in DBT and had a psychologist for other reasons, but the 
topic never came up in the conversations and I didn’t bring 
it up myself.” A 33-year-old woman (Ax40) wrote about 
her desire for help:

“Some tool to get over the total feeling of worthless-
ness. I got help with cutting, my shitty relationship with 
food and drink, but no one ever mentioned sex. Neither 
did I, in fact, but I was not fully aware that what I was 

doing was self-injury. I have understood that after-
wards. Caregivers need to be aware of the existence of 
the behavior and need to get their patients to talk about 
it. Especially in DBT, as it is a fairly common behavior 
among borderline persons.”

Discussion

SASI is a relatively new phenomenon that is still sparsely 
described in the literature. The aim of this study was to inves-
tigate experiences of help and support among informants 
with SASI, since no previous study has been found on the 
subject. The most important findings regarding experiences 
of help and support for SASI were: (1) The need to frame the 
behavior of SASI, (2) Flexible, respectful, and professional 
help and support from an early age, and (3) Help with under-
lying reasons to exit SASI. These findings will be discussed 
further below.

First, the informants found it important to get a word for 
the behavior to be able to frame what they had experienced. 
This was necessary to get help and support, but also to be able 
to leave the behavior. Questions, knowledge, and informa-
tion were found to be helpful for quitting the behavior, but a 
lack of questions, information, and knowledge increased the 
stigma, shame, and self-blame. Some informants were unable 
to put their experiences into words because of shame and 
self-blame, which is why the questions needed to be asked 
repeatedly. SASI is a new and sensitive issue in the research 
field, since there is currently no common definition and the 
research is sparse and limited with regard to cultural contexts, 
hence the knowledge within society is limited. Questions may 
even be raised about whether it actually exists as a problem, 
since there are only a few studies framing the phenomenon 
as SASI. However, in Sweden, there is a debate related to the 
phenomenon where people, both professionals and victims, 
can relate to the concept and view it as helpful, and it has also 
been discussed in court cases. SASI could possibly be a cul-
tural problem, since it has only been described in a Swedish 
context, but the description and functions of the behavior are 
most likely relevant to other nationalities as seen in a recent 
pilot study from the USA (Mellin & Young, 2022). Reflec-
tions could further be made on whether it could be harmful 
to define SASI as a self-injurious behavior, since it could 
be perceived as imposing guilt on a person with experience 
of sexual violence. According to this study, putting SASI 
into words was not experienced by the informants as impos-
ing guilt, but rather increased the possibility of getting help 
and being able to leave the behavior. However, making the 
behavior invisible by not asking questions, not framing it as 
a self-injury, or not understanding the underlying reasons 
for the behavior increased the shame and guilt. On the other 
hand, when a new phenomenon such as SASI is described, 

1 3Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160 

157

it is also important to not stigmatize or pathologize normal 
sexual behaviors such as experiences of many sexual part-
ners or norm-breaking sexual preferences that could have 
nothing to do with self-injury. The informants in this study 
reported a great lack of knowledge and information among 
healthcare and social workers, and requested greater com-
petence concerning how SASI could be forced by the func-
tion of the behavior. In Sweden, there is an ongoing project 
to facilitate the screening of sexual risk-taking behaviors 
within the school health system and youth clinics, using an 
instrument as a tool for asking sensitive questions concern-
ing sexual risk-taking behaviors (Hammarström et al., 2019). 
This might also be a way to ask questions about SASI. The 
informants highlighted the importance of asking about SASI 
within health care, especially in areas such as psychiatry, 
youth clinics, and clinics working with sexual health and 
self-injurious behaviors, but also in school health.

Second, earlier literature concerning help and support 
for NSSI has found that how the person is treated is very 
important (Lindgren et al., 2018), and validation is a key 
component of DBT that is commonly used for personality 
disorders with NSSI or suicidal behaviors (DeCou et al., 
2019; Linehan, 1993). As has been found in studies concern-
ing NSSI, informants with SASI described in this study that 
they wanted to be confirmed in their experiences, to be seen 
and treated with respect and understanding. The person needs 
to feel that she has been listened to and that the caregiver 
believes in her. Caregivers need to be non-judgmental and 
encouraging, proactive, and competent. Negative experiences 
from health care discourage people from seeking help, which 
might accelerate self-injury (Collin-Vézina et al., 2021; Lind-
gren et al., 2018).

Third, knowledge about NSSI has grown in recent dec-
ades, and NSSI was included as a suggested diagnosis in need 
of more research in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychi-
atric Association, 2013). It was defined as injuries directed 
directly to the surface of the body, such as cutting, hitting, 
and burning the skin, without suicidal intention and with 
underlying motives of relieving negative feelings, resolv-
ing interpersonal difficulties, or inducing positive feelings. 
However, research in recent years has found that indirect 
forms of self-injury, such as aggression, substance use, 
binge eating, and risky sexual behaviors, are dysregulated 
behaviors that can share common functions with NSSI, with 
short-term benefits and long-term distress and impairment 
that can be hard to control (Bresin, 2020; D’Agostino et al., 
2020; Fox et al., 2019; Jonsson et al., 2019). These kinds of 
behaviors can result in harm for the patient, which can be 
explained by similar ethology and helped by similar interven-
tions (Bresin, 2020), as also described by the informants in 
this study. Comorbidity between indirect and direct forms of 
self-injury is common, and the behaviors can overlap with 

regard to function and intention of causing direct injury to 
oneself (D’Agostino et al., 2020; Fox et al., 2019; Jonsson 
et al., 2019). Earlier research found that SASI can share com-
mon functions with NSSI, and that these behaviors can even 
replace each other (Fredlund et al., 2020; Jonsson et al., 2015, 
2019). This means that if the person stops cutting herself, she 
might continue with other forms of self-injury that could be 
even more destructive and dangerous with regard to physical 
and mental injury, such as SASI (Fredlund et al., 2020). It 
is therefore not enough to address one kind of self-injurious 
behavior in treatment; instead, the function of the behav-
ior should be addressed, and the person should be helped to 
find tools to deal with all kinds of dysregulated behaviors 
such as NSSI, eating disorders, SASI, or substance abuse. If 
not, these behaviors might evolve into other self-destructive 
behaviors (Fredlund et al., 2020). This was also highlighted 
in this study by informants describing the importance of talk-
ing about SASI in treatments such as DBT and other therapies 
for self-injurious behaviors.

Fourth, the need for proper help and support in relation to 
SASI during adolescence was a theme identified in this study, 
since this was the age when SASI often started. Informants 
reported that it was hard to get help during adolescence, and 
that they found it important to highlight SASI within school 
health, social services, and other care units for adolescents. 
Another important issue regarding the organization of help 
and support was the need for anonymity and the need to meet 
others with the same experiences. In this respect, the inter-
net was found to be an important forum for information and 
for meeting others with similar experiences, e.g., via chat 
forums. Internet-based treatment is a growing area within 
psychiatry, and the knowledge concerning interventions in 
self-injurious behavior is promising but still limited (Arshad 
et al., 2020). This form of intervention might be helpful for 
SASI.

Fifth, instead of just putting SASI into words, informants 
also found it important to get help with the underlying rea-
sons for SASI. This includes treatment for earlier traumati-
zation, including experiences of rape and physical violence, 
treatment for PTSD, anxiety, depression, emotional instabil-
ity, and self-injury. Informants found it important to work on 
their own self-esteem and the ability to maintain their own 
boundaries. Conventional therapy was frequently described 
as helpful in this respect, as were support from friends and 
family, and not least meeting a stable partner. Lifechanging 
events were described as a point where the person got help or 
realized that she needed help and started to find her own value 
and boundaries. For some informants, life itself—due to get-
ting older or having children—was sometimes enough to find 
the way out of a destructive pattern of self-injury including 
SASI. As seen in previous studies, SASI has been associated 
with earlier traumatization, not least sexual victimization, 
PTSD, dissociation, and poor mental health, and informants 

1 3158 

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160

have also described SASI as increasing the risk of revictimi-
zation (Fredlund et al., 2017, 2020; Zetterqvist et al., 2018). 
This means that therapy focusing on PTSD and trauma might 
be an important part of helpful treatment for SASI, since self-
injury might be just one way to cope with the experience of 
abuse, end victimization, and deal with the self-hatred and 
loneliness associated with the sexual abuse, as seen in pre-
vious studies (Collin-Vézina et al., 2021). According to this 
study, trauma treatment such as therapy for PTSD, dissocia-
tion, anxiety, and sexual violence, combined with therapy for 
emotional regulation, could be helpful in SASI.

Sixth, according to earlier research on SASI, experiences 
of sexual abuse before SASI are common, even though not all 
the informants had these experiences (Fredlund et al., 2017, 
2020; Zetterqvist et al., 2018). SASI can be a way to take 
back control after sexual abuse, but it can also be a way to 
regulate negative emotions or a way to punish oneself with 
regard to self-hatred after the experience of sexual abuse 
(Fredlund et al., 2020). SASI can be understood as a sexual-
ized behavior after sexual abuse that has been described as 
traumatic sexualization in earlier research (cf. Finkelhor & 
Browne, 1985), with the function of emotional regulation just 
like other kinds of self-injury (Fredlund et al., 2020; Jonsson 
et al., 2019). However, the relationship between SASI and 
sexual abuse is rather complex, since it has been described 
how SASI can also include sexual violence such as sex 
without inner desire or attraction as a way to punish oneself, 
physical and sexual violence, sexual exploitation through 
selling sex, exposing oneself to situations that involve a risk 
of victimization, and being exposed as a child (Fredlund 
et al., 2020). These are situations that should be described 
as sexual violence, and the person must of course be consid-
ered as a victim of violence, but to understand the function 
of SASI could be helpful for the understanding of underly-
ing motives for returning to the violence repeatedly. More 
research is needed with regard to understanding SASI as trau-
matic sexualized behavior after sexual abuse (Finkelhor &  
Browne, 1985), or whether it could rather be described as 
an entity of sexual violence or as a self-injurious behavior 
alone. This is important not least in legal cases, since SASI 
could include extremely vulnerable situations that the person 
has been forced into due to poor mental health and a need 
for emotional regulation. When such cases come to court, 
the victim is often blamed for seeking risky sexual situa-
tions of her own accord. We suggest that the person should 
instead be seen as a victim of both sexual violence and poor 
mental health which leads to a more vulnerable position of 
exploitation and hence could be seen as more severe kind of 
victimization. This kind of exploitation should be seen as 
more severe and more resources for help and support might 
be needed since the poor mental health is forcing the vicious 
loop of the behavior (Fredlund et al., 2020).

Strengths and Limitations of the Study

In this study, anonymous questionnaires were used instead 
of interviews, in view of the sensitive questions asked. This 
gave the study both strengths and limitations. First, the design 
made it possible to reach a large and diverse group of inform-
ants, including both those with ongoing SASI and those who 
had stopped using SASI. The informants were diverse in 
terms of age (15–64 years of age), but also in terms of their 
experiences of help and support. However, the design of the 
study made it impossible to ask further questions and to go 
into themes in greater depth. The answers were also shorter 
and less detailed than what we would expect in interview situ-
ations. On the other hand, the number of participants (197) 
who answered the questionnaire was high, suggesting that 
we have found the most important themes concerning experi-
ences of help and support.

An important limitation concerning the concept of SASI 
is the limited number of studies and the lack of descriptions 
from other cultural contexts. This study was initiated in 
2016–2017, but in recent years the concept of SASI has been 
more widely addressed within society in Sweden and SASI 
has also been included in the definition of self-injury used by 
the Swedish National Self-Injury Project (Nationella Självs-
kadeprojektet, 2021). This means that the situation described 
by the informants—with regard to the way they were treated 
and the lack of information and knowledge about the behav-
ior—might now be slightly different in Sweden today. More 
education has been provided concerning self-injury in recent 
years, but also concerning SASI within different forums such 
as conferences for school nurses, NGOs working with vulner-
able young people and adults, healthcare staff, and midwives.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study aimed to investigate perceived help 
and support with regard to SASI, which to our knowledge has 
not been investigated previously. The study found that the most 
important experiences regarding help and support in relation 
to SASI were to get a word for SASI, to know it exists, and to 
get knowledge, information, and questions about the behavior. 
As with other kinds of self-injurious behaviors, the treatment 
needed to be flexible, respectful, and professional, and under-
lying reasons needed to be addressed. Conventional therapy 
or working with one’s own value and boundaries through life 
were helpful to be able to leave SASI. This means that similar 
interventions that have been found helpful for other kinds of self-
injurious behaviors could also be helpful for SASI. However, in 
contrast to NSSI, SASI often includes another person, meaning 
that SASI could entail less control over the self-injury in the 
actual situation, and the person could be more vulnerable and 
at risk of victimization. More research is needed to understand 

1 3Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:149–160 

159

the complex relationship between SASI and sexual violence, 
as well as studies of SASI in other cultural contexts, which is a 
limitation in the current field. It is hoped that the findings from 
this study will be helpful when developing help and support for 
SASI at healthcare units such as youth clinics, psychiatry, and 
school health, and in a further step prevent victimization and 
traumatization, which can be serious consequences of SASI.
