Advanced cancer, with its considerable physical symptoms and psychosocial burdens, represents an existential
threat and major stressor to patients and their caregivers. In response to such stress, patients and their caregivers
use a variety of strategies to manage the disease and related symptoms, such as problem-focused, emotion-
focused, meaning-focused, and spiritual/religious coping. The use of such coping strategies is associated with
multiple outcomes, including quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety, illness understanding, and end-
of-life care. Accumulating data demonstrate that early palliative care, integrated with oncology care, not only
improves these key outcomes but also enhances coping in patients with advanced cancer. In addition, trials of
home-based palliative care interventions have shown promise for improving the ways that patients and family
caregivers cope together and manage problems as a dyad. In this article, we describe the nature and correlates of
coping in this population, highlight the role of palliative care to promote effective coping strategies in patients and
caregivers, and review evidence supporting the beneﬁcial effects of palliative care on patient coping as well as the
mechanisms by which improved coping is associated with better outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations of the state of science, future directions, and best practices on the basis of available evidence.

INTRODUCTION

life stressors or

When confronting major
threats,
coping represents the strategies that individuals use to
manage the internal and external demands that are
perceived as burdensome or exceeding their personal
resources.1 From the moment of diagnosis of ad-
vanced cancer, patients and their caregivers experi-
ence a variety of practical, social, emotional, and
existential concerns due to the nature of the disease,
treatments, and prognosis. To manage such stressors,
patients and families engage in various coping strat-
egies, which may evolve over time and be more or less
effective for improving adjustment and well-being.
Researchers have conceptualized coping strategies in
multiple domains, such as: problem-focused (ie, ef-
forts to modify or resolve the stressor), emotion-
focused (ie, efforts to reduce or regulate the distress
from the stressor), and meaning-focused (ie, efforts to
maintain positive well-being) coping, among others.1-3
Another common distinction in the literature pertains
to whether coping methods reﬂect engagement,
consisting of active or approach-oriented strategies to
manage the stressor directly, or disengagement, in
which individuals seek to avoid or withdraw from

dealing with the stressor.4 Faced with a serious illness,
patients and families use multiple forms of coping
through a dynamic process that both affects and is
inﬂuenced by one’s environment,
resources, and
emotional well-being.

The aims of this review are to describe coping pro-
cesses in patients with advanced cancer and their
caregivers as well as the role palliative care may play in
promoting effective coping. Given that research on
coping with cancer is vast, spanning decades, we limit
the scope of this review to studies of patients with
advanced cancer and their caregivers. After high-
lighting the correlates of coping in this population, we
discuss the role and evidence for palliative care to
improve coping, limitations of
future
the research,
directions, and recommendations for practice.

COPING AND ITS CORRELATES IN PATIENTS WITH
ADVANCED CANCER

Qualitative studies have helped to elucidate the ex-
periences of patients coping with advanced cancer
from the time of diagnosis to approaching the end of
life. After the initial diagnosis of cancer, key concerns
for patients include physical symptoms and adverse

effects, loss of functioning, possibility of progressive dis-
ease, persistent uncertainty, and management of
life-
limiting illness.5,6 In response to these stressors, patients
often initially draw on their existing coping strategies before
their cancer diagnosis to manage distress and psycho-
logical well-being.7 These strategies further develop as
patients ﬁnd ways to live with the disease and may include
a combination of remaining positive, avoiding disease-
related thoughts, soliciting social support, maintaining
normal life routines to the extent possible, modifying ex-
pectations, ﬁnding acceptance, and engaging in religious
and/or spiritual coping.5,7-11 For some patients, the ad-
vanced cancer experience can also be a stimulus for
ﬁnding a deeper sense of meaning and personal growth at
the end of life.12

The process of coping across the disease trajectory is
dynamic, often inﬂuenced by context. Patients may move
moment-to-moment from being more or less hopeful and
conﬁdent in their ability to cope based on how they feel
physically and emotionally or whether they received difﬁcult
news about their prognosis. The diagnosis of advanced
disease often triggers intense emotions for patients, who
may vacillate between periods of directly contemplating
dying versus restraining thoughts of death either through
optimistic thinking or by drawing on their resources to
engage in meaningful connections with life.13 When dis-
cussing prognosis in clinical encounters, patients, care-
givers, and palliative care professionals agree that a variety
of strategies can foster effective coping. These strategies
include emphasizing control of physical symptoms, pro-
viding emotional and practical support, identifying and
working toward realistic goals, focusing on present day-to-
day living, and balancing prognostic disclosure with nur-
turing hope.14

In addition to using qualitative methods, investigators have
quantitatively examined the use of different coping strat-
egies in patients and caregivers with a variety of validated
self-report tools. No single gold standard for assessing
coping strategies currently exists. Some measures are
speciﬁc to patients with cancer, and others are more
general checklists of a broad array of coping behaviors.
Table 1 lists examples of coping inventories commonly
used in oncology, including descriptions of their subscales
and domains of assessment. Several of these tools have
undergone iterative rounds of psychometric testing, with
both long and brief forms.

In numerous cross-sectional studies, researchers have
investigated associations between various coping strategies
and clinical, psychological, and quality-of-life (QOL) out-
comes in patients with cancer. To date, no consistent
evidence demonstrates that psychological coping in-
creases or decreases the risk of cancer recurrence or
survival.24-26 Nonetheless, patient coping seems to be re-
lated to symptom severity and health behaviors. For ex-
ample, one study showed that women with recurrent breast

cancer and lower coping capacity reported experiencing
more symptoms and higher levels of symptom distress
compared with those with greater coping capacity.27 In this
study,
a
sense of coherence in perceiving the world and one’s life
as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful.27 In
addition, men with prostate cancer who engage in avoid-
ance coping (ie, behavioral disengagement, denial, and
distraction) report greater severity of sleep-related symp-
toms and interference in functioning.28 Finally, patients
with advanced cancer who are current smokers experience
worse pain, require higher doses of opioid medications, and
are more likely to cope by using substance use, denial, and
self-blame compared with former or never-smokers.29
These studies highlight potential targets of intervention to
enhance coping efforts and ideally ameliorate the burden of
disease and treatment.

With respect to psychological and QOL outcomes, recent
reviews suggest that disengaged coping (eg, avoidance)
and poor self-efﬁcacy for coping with cancer (ie, lack of
conﬁdence in one’s ability to perform various behaviors to
cope with cancer and its treatment) are associated with
higher distress and worse QOL.30,31 However, the types of
coping strategies that patients use and their relationships to
these outcomes may differ depending on a variety of fac-
tors, including the population, assessment measure, and
whether treatment is curative versus palliative.32-34 In a
sample of 350 patients who completed the Brief COPE
questionnaire within 8 weeks of a diagnosis of incurable
lung or GI cancers, the most commonly endorsed strategies
included emotional support, positive reframing, and active
coping (eg, taking action to make the situation better),
followed by acceptance, self-blame, and denial.35 Emo-
tional support and acceptance coping correlated with
better QOL and mood, whereas the use of denial and self-
blame was associated with worse QOL and symptoms of
anxiety and depression.35 Also, longitudinal studies suggest
that coping capacity and self-efﬁcacy are salient factors in
predicting QOL over time in patients with advanced lung
cancer.36,37 Adjusting one’s life goals, ﬁnding acceptance,
and taking action are related to less anxiety and depression
and better QOL after a diagnosis of advanced breast and
ovarian cancers, respectively.38,39

Investigators have also examined patient coping as
a moderator of outcomes. For example, among patients
with advanced breast cancer, engagement coping (eg,
active coping, planning, seeking support, positive refram-
ing) and self-efﬁcacy for coping with cancer seem to
moderate the effects of symptom stress and distress on
QOL.40,41 That is, the negative correlations of symptom
stress and distress with QOL seem to be mitigated in pa-
tients with advanced breast cancer who report higher
engagement coping and greater self-efﬁcacy for coping
with cancer.40,41 In a study of patients with incurable lung or
GI cancers, those who had accurate prognostic awareness

status or goal of treatment. Thus, the use of particular
coping strategies may buffer the relationships between
prognostic awareness and worse QOL and mood
outcomes.

Another salient target of investigation has been on the
important role of spiritual and religious coping in patients
with advanced cancer. The majority of patients consider
themselves spiritual or religious, often relying on their
beliefs, communities of faith, and practices to cope with
cancer.43,44 Spiritual and positive religious coping (eg,
seeking a stronger connection with or help from God) is
associated with higher QOL and better mental health.44-47
Furthermore, patients with advanced cancer who report
using positive religious coping have lower rates of com-
pleting a living will and a greater likelihood of receiving
intensive life-prolonging medical care near death.48-50 The
underlying mechanisms for these relationships remain
unclear.

Many patients with advanced cancer also struggle with
religion and spirituality; one study showed that 44% of
patients report some degree of spiritual pain.43,51 Spiritual
struggle and negative religious coping (eg, feeling punished
or abandoned by God) are correlated with psychological
distress, suicidal ideation, and worse QOL.46,51,52 Although
most patients with advanced cancer believe their medical
team ought to address spiritual concerns,44,51 such care is
often lacking. Thus, to promote spiritual support for patients
and families, the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality
Palliative Care underscore spiritual, religious, and exis-
tential aspects of care as a central domain of high quality,
comprehensive palliative care.53

ROLE OF PALLIATIVE CARE TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE COPING

Before the recent growth of outpatient palliative care pro-
grams, palliative care (PC) clinicians principally provided
consultations for hospitalized patients with serious illnesses
near the end of life who require acute symptom man-
agement, advance care planning, and referral to hospice
services. Shifting the model of care to the outpatient setting
and integrating palliative care early in the course of disease
have allowed PC clinicians to develop longitudinal re-
lationships with patients and families, expanding their role
beyond symptom management to include helping patients
live well through adaptation and effective coping with the
serious illness.54 Studies have shown that the predominant
focus of palliative care consultations in the early, integrated
model for patients with advanced cancer was on symptom
management and coping support.55,56 Although addressed
less often, clinicians also consistently assessed and dis-
cussed patient
illness understanding and prognostic
awareness across visits, whereas topics pertaining to ad-
vance care planning, treatment decisions, and disposition
(eg, hospice referral) increased in frequency in latter visits
as patients neared death (Fig 1).55,56

In the early, integrated model, PC clinicians work collab-
oratively with oncologists to provide complementary yet
distinct care for patients with advanced cancer and their
caregivers. Analyses of clinician documentation as well as
audio-recorded visits of patient consultations with oncology
and palliative care reveal that both specialists discussed
symptom management, medical understanding, and
treatment decision making at key clinical time points, such
as disease progression.56,57 However, PC clinicians more
often than oncologists addressed patient coping and

assessed understanding of treatment process and prognosis.56,57
In the outpatient oncology setting, PC clinicians viewed
their complementary role through three domains: (1)
managing symptoms to improve functional status and QOL,
(2) facilitating patient coping, acceptance, and planning,
and (3) serving as an interpreter between the patient and
oncologist.58

PC clinicians emphasize coping with patients and care-
givers not only to bolster resilience, adaptation, and well-
being but also to help patients with advanced cancer and
their caregivers come to a deeper understanding of prog-
nosis and tolerate having a terminal diagnosis. Jacobsen
et al59 have conceptualized the process by which the early,
integrated palliative care model helps improve QOL and
end-of-life care outcomes in patients with advanced cancer
as a dual framework of focusing on living well while ac-
knowledging the possibility of dying. That is, as patients
experience greater symptom control and enhance their
coping repertoire by working with palliative care, they de-
velop increased psychological capacity to understand and
accept their prognosis. Ideally, this process unfolds over
time, within the context of a longstanding patient-clinician
relationship, enabling patients and caregivers to prepare for
the future and make informed treatment decisions that are
consistent with their goals and values.59 Indeed, prior
studies demonstrated that patients who received early,
integrated palliative care retained and developed more
accurate prognostic awareness over time and had higher-
quality end-of-life care compared with those who received
usual care.60,61
To enhance coping, PC clinicians should ﬁrst assess,
normalize, and validate patients’ prior coping efforts for
managing difﬁculties and crises in the past. Yet, even with
these skills, many patients with advanced cancer feel a
tremendous loss of self and inability to rely on their normal
coping mechanisms because of decrements in functioning
from disease progression and treatment adverse effects.
Therefore, PC clinicians should work with patients and
caregivers to process the grief associated with such losses
while introducing new coping strategies that are consistent
with the patient’s functional status.62 Table 2 details various
cognitive, behavioral, emotional/physiologic, and existen-
tial/spiritual coping strategies that PC clinicians discuss
with patients and caregivers. An analysis of palliative care
visits from an early, integrated palliative care trial of patients
with incurable lung or GI cancers showed that PC clinicians
often focused on ways to redirect hope toward realistic
goals and used behavioral approaches (eg, soliciting social
support), especially early on in the disease course, and
then shifted to counseling support in later visits. Clinicians
also drew on spiritual and existential (eg, life review) coping
with patients and caregivers.55

Moving palliative care to the outpatient setting and earlier in
the disease course has necessitated the development of
new skills for clinicians who have had limited training in

how to assess, support, and teach effective coping strat-
egies. Results from a pilot study of a training program to
teach psychological skills to oncology and PC nurse spe-
cialists (under the supervision of clinical psychologists)
showed that nurse specialists gained conﬁdence in their
ability to provide psychoeducation to support coping
strategies in patients and caregivers.63 The successful
deployment of early, integrated palliative care may require
additional training and supervision within multidisciplinary
teams to ensure clinician competence in these care
domains.

EVIDENCE FOR PALLIATIVE CARE TO IMPROVE COPING AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES

Recent meta-analyses of palliative care interventions for
patients with life-limiting illness, including cancer, dem-
onstrate that the beneﬁts of palliative care are most robust
for
improving patient QOL and reducing symptom
burden.64,65 The results are mixed with respect to the effect
of palliative care on patient mood symptoms.64,65 Other-
wise, data on the role of palliative care in improving patient
coping are limited. A qualitative study of patients with
advanced cancer who participated in a trial of concurrent
oncology and palliative care (ENABLE II: Educate, Nurture,
Advise, Before Life Ends) highlighted the potential beneﬁts
of the intervention on patient coping. Speciﬁcally, partici-
pants perceived the intervention to be helpful by enhancing
problem-solving skills, coping with uncertainty and con-
cerns about
the future, empowerment, support, and
reassurance.66

Only one clinical trial has demonstrated that early palliative
care can enhance patient coping. In a sample of 350
patients with incurable lung or GI cancers, early palliative
care integrated with oncology care signiﬁcantly increased
the use of approach-oriented coping strategies (ie, active
coping, positive reframing, and acceptance) compared
with usual care.67 Moreover, the positive changes in
approach-oriented coping mediated the beneﬁcial effects
of early, integrated palliative care on patient-reported QOL
and depression symptoms.67 Subgroup analyses suggest
that the effect of the palliative care intervention on coping
may be more pronounced in younger than older patients.68
In a separate analysis of 2,921 palliative care visits from the
intervention group of this trial, investigators observed that
the most commonly addressed topics between clinicians
and patients were symptom management (74.5% of visits)
and coping with cancer (64.2% of visits). Among patients in
the intervention group, a higher proportion of visits involving
discussions of coping was associated with improved QOL
and fewer depression symptoms from baseline to week 24.55

Other studies of palliative care interventions to improve
coping in patients with advanced cancer are emerging. For
example, a single-group pilot trial of a chaplain-led spiritual
care intervention for patients with advanced cancer re-
ceiving outpatient palliative care showed signiﬁcant

coping and to identify which coping strategies most strongly

and dyadic psychological support intervention in patients
with advanced cancer and their caregivers led to im-
provements in common coping (ie, how the dyad manages
problems together) among couples but not among parent-
child dyads or other dyads in the study.87

COPING IN CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH
ADVANCED CANCER

Because the considerable stress and psychological se-
quelae of advanced cancer are shared by patients and their
loved ones alike,71 a growing body of research has emerged
detailing the coping responses of informal caregivers. Al-
though not always consistent, ﬁndings from observational
studies suggest that avoidant, dysfunctional, or emotion-
focused coping strategies are associated with distress,
caregiver burden, and psychiatric morbidity in caregivers of
patients with advanced cancer.72-76 In contrast, caregivers
using active coping strategies are more likely to have
positive expectations and a hopeful attitude for the future.77
In addition, a small study of caregivers of patients with
advanced cancer receiving palliative care revealed that
58% reported spiritual pain associated with dysfunctional
coping strategies.78 Finally, caregivers of patients with
terminal cancer who engage in negative religious coping
(eg, feeling punished or abandoned by God) are more likely
to have higher burden, poorer QOL, and depressive and
anxiety disorders.79

The dyadic relationship may play an important role in how
patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers cope.
For example, patient use of acceptance coping is associ-
ated with lower caregiver depression symptoms, whereas
patient coping through seeking emotional support is related
to higher caregiver depression symptoms.80 Moreover,
caregiver use of avoidance, emotion-focused, and
problem-focused coping strategies signiﬁcantly correlate
function and symp-
with patient outcomes of physical
toms.81 These ﬁndings underscore the potential value of
targeting dyadic adjustment to enhance coping and well-
being when managing the stress of advanced cancer.82
Although recent evidence demonstrates the beneﬁts of
early palliative care in improving caregiver depression
symptoms,83,84 data are limited regarding its effects on
caregiver coping. McMillan et al85 conducted a randomized
trial to test the efﬁcacy of a hospice plus coping skills
training intervention with family caregivers of hospice pa-
tients with cancer. The intervention led to improvements in
caregiver QOL and burden but did not affect caregiver
mastery or problem- or emotion-focused coping.85 More
recently, two large trials of dyadic interventions have shown
some promise. Speciﬁcally, a home-based education and
support intervention for patients with advanced cancer and
family caregivers resulted in improved dyadic coping (ie,
reduced avoidance strategies) and self-efﬁcacy at 3 months,
although effects generally were not sustained at 6 months.86
In addition, a home-based specialized palliative care

LIMITATIONS OF THE SCIENCE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Criticisms of coping research have focused on method-
ological considerations,
including the use of general
checklists to assess coping strategies, reliance on cross-
sectional designs, and potential confounding in accounting
for associations between coping and outcomes.88 Despite
the abundance of studies on coping in response to major life
stressors, including cancer, no speciﬁc strategies consis-
tently predict better outcomes across patients or situations,
questioning the utility of established coping assessments.
For example, an emotion-focused coping strategy like self-
distraction may be a helpful approach for managing stress in
one circumstance, while reﬂecting maladaptive avoidance in
another. Moreover, with cross-sectional study designs, we
are unable to discern whether certain coping strategies lead
to speciﬁc outcomes or vice versa.88 Research on coping
and distress has been confounded by the diverse array of
measures and operational deﬁnitions for coping and the fact
that those who experience worse symptoms or psychological
difﬁculties have a greater need to engage in various coping
efforts.4,89

To overcome the aforementioned limitations, prospective
intervention research with randomized designs that clearly
specify coping targets is needed. As research on palliative
care has evolved to new models emphasizing longitudinal
relationships with patients and caregivers in the outpatient
setting, researchers should consider the speciﬁc ways that
palliative care promotes effective coping over time. Coping
measures that assess those processes should also be in-
corporated in trials to explicate the mediating mechanisms
by which the interventions lead to desired clinical out-
comes.90 Finally, although a diagnosis of advanced cancer
likely represents a universal stressor, coping responses
may differ across time, context, or patient populations.
Additional research is needed to examine heterogeneity in
coping and outcomes on the basis of diverse clinical and
demographic characteristics.

Although current evidence is limited, recent palliative care
studies lay the necessary foundation for continued pursuit
of research on the assessment and promotion of coping in
patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. Nu-
merous trials have conﬁrmed the beneﬁts of early, in-
tegrated palliative care for patient QOL and symptom
burden.65 The next generation of research should focus
on the means by which these improved outcomes are
achieved. Patient and caregiver coping strategies represent
key targets of this investigation, given clinical, theoretical,
and accumulating empirical evidence demonstrating

links among coping, QOL, mood, prognostic

With respect to the delivery of clinical care, best practice
guidelines do not yet exist regarding the role of palliative
care to improve patient and caregiver coping. Nonetheless
studies of early, integrated palliative care clearly show that
a primary focus of intervention is on enhancing patient and
caregiver coping throughout the disease course.55,56 The
types of coping strategies vary over time and include
cognitive, behavioral, spiritual, and existential approaches,
among others.62 Therefore, clinicians should ideally in-
corporate routine assessment of patient and caregiver
coping in practice. The aims of these discussions are to
reinforce existing effective coping and support the patient
and family to broaden their coping repertoire with novel
strategies that are reasonable and meaningful, given
ﬂuctuations in patient status over time. In addition, home-
based dyadic interventions may further enhance how pa-
tients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers
cope as a unit.

Exciting advances in palliative care delivery models in the
outpatient setting have improved comprehensive care
and outcomes for patients with advanced cancer and
their caregivers. With the innovations in the early in-
tegration of palliative and oncology care, clinicians and

researchers have focused particular attention on the
ways that patients and caregivers cope with cancer
throughout the disease course and at the end of life.
Numerous qualitative and observational studies have
elucidated the diverse array of coping strategies that
patients and caregivers use, which are associated with
key clinical outcomes such as QOL. Moreover, data
suggest that PC clinicians play an essential role in the
ongoing evaluation and promotion of coping strategies to
manage effectively the burdens of disease, cancer
treatment, and existential distress in patients and
caregivers. Although prior research has been limited
because of cross-sectional study designs and use of
general checklists to assess coping, the ﬁeld is now
progressing, with prospective randomized controlled
trials that demonstrate the positive effects of palliative
care on particular coping strategies and the mechanisms
by which changes in coping relate to improved QOL and
mood in patients with advanced cancer. As this body of
research matures and clinicians are called on to address
coping in practice, evidence-based guidelines and mul-
tidisciplinary training will be valuable tools to support PC
clinicians in empowering patients and families to cope
successfully with the numerous stressors of advanced
cancer and evolving medical therapies.
