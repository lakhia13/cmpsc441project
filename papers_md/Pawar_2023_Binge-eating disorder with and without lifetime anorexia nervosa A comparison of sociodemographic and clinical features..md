Method:  Participants (N = 898) met criteria for lifetime BED and reported current binge eating. 
Approximately 14% had a lifetime diagnosis of AN. Analyses compared BED AN+ and BED 
AN− on sociodemographic variables and clinical history.

Results:  The presence of lifetime AN was associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms 
including earlier onset, more frequent, more chronic, and more types of eating disorder behaviors 
over the lifetime, and a higher lifetime prevalence of bulimia nervosa (BN). Participants with 
lifetime AN reported being more likely to have received treatments for BED or BN, had 
significantly lower minimum, current, and maximum BMIs, more severe general anxiety, and were 
significantly more likely to be younger and female. In the full sample, the lifetime prevalence of 
unhealthy weight control behaviors was high and treatment utilization was low, despite an average 
15-year history since symptom onset. Gastrointestinal disorders and comorbid anxiety, depression, 
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms were prevalent.

Discussion:  Individuals fared poorly on a wide array of domains, yet those with lifetime AN 
fared considerably more poorly. All patients with BED should be screened for mental health and 
gastrointestinal comorbidities and offered referral and treatment options.

Introduction

Diagnostic crossover is commonly observed in eating disorders (EDs) (Milos et al., 2005; 
Schaumberg et al., 2019). Between 43% and 62% of individuals with anorexia nervosa 
restricting type (AN-R) develop binge-eating symptoms (Eddy et al., 2002) and between 
21% and 54% of individuals with AN transition to bulimia nervosa (BN) (Castellini et 
al., 2011; Monteleone et al., 2011). Limited evidence suggests that a smaller percentage, 
between 0% and 10%, of individuals with AN transition to binge-eating disorder (BED) 
(Mathisen et al., 2018; Utzinger et al., 2015). Comorbidity, both within discrete periods of 
time or over the lifetime—such as from AN to BED or vice versa—is important to research 
because comorbidity can bear negatively on course and prognosis, involve broader and more 
complex therapeutic approaches, increase severity of illness and psychosocial and medical 
burden, and reveal developmental paths toward and etiologies of a condition.

Several studies of BN report that a history of AN predicts poorer outcome. Longitudinal 
studies have shown lower recovery rates, poorer treatment response, and higher odds of 
subsequent AN episodes in individuals with BN with a history of AN (Eddy et al., 2007; 
Vaz-Leal et al., 2011). Further, greater hospitalization, depression, substance abuse, purging, 
and longer duration of illness have been found in those with BN with a history of AN 
(Bardone-Cone et al., 2008; Eddy et al., 2007; Sullivan et al., 1996; Vaz-Leal et al., 2011). 
A history of AN also predicts lower BMI in BN (Bardone-Cone et al., 2008; Goldschmidt 
et al., 2013; Sullivan et al., 1996; Vaz-Leal et al., 2011). In a ten-year follow-up study of 
mortality in BN, lower minimum BMI and previous suicide attempt were the two significant 
predictors of death (Huas et al., 2013).

Much less is known about the prognostic significance of lifetime AN in individuals with 
BED. One study found that patients with BED with a history of AN or BN (AN/BN) had 
elevated mood disorder prevalence and ED symptoms before and after BED treatment than 
those without such a history (Utzinger et al., 2015). That study considered AN/BN as a 
composite variable, and so did not isolate the unique effect of history of AN. In another 
study, history of multiple EDs (AN, BN, or BED) was associated with a higher prevalence 
of gastrointestinal disorders than a history of a single ED (Wiklund et al., 2021). The broad 
literature on comorbidity in psychopathology suggests that comorbidity increases burden of 
illness, outcomes, severity of the component illnesses, and treatment utilization (Angold et 
al., 1999).

The clinical phenomenology of comorbid lifetime BED and AN contrasted with BED only 
is expected to be influenced by the epidemiology and naturalistic course of AN. Whereas 
BED has a roughly equal gender distribution, AN disproportionately affects females (Udo 
& Grilo, 2018), and decades-long follow-up studies find a lower weight status in AN than 
controls even after recovery from AN (Bulik et al., 2000; Fichter et al., 2017). Hence, those 
who have experienced BED and AN may be more likely to be female and to report lower 
minimum, current, and maximum BMIs than those who have experienced BED only.

This study compared adults BED and AN in their lifetime (BED AN+) to those with BED in 
their lifetime only (BED AN−). We compared sociodemographics, history of ED behaviors, 
treatment history, weight history, and current ED and comorbid symptoms. Based on the 
literature, we hypothesize that compared with BED AN−, BED AN+ will have a female 
preponderance, worse ED history (i.e., prevalence, chronicity, frequency, and earlier age 
at onset of behavioral symptoms), greater treatment utilization for BED, lower minimum, 
current, and maximum BMIs, and greater current ED symptoms, anxiety, depression, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and gastrointestinal comorbidity. These 
hypotheses are based on the aforementioned comorbidity and epidemiology research 
(Angold et al., 1999; Bardone-Cone et al., 2008; Bulik et al., 2000; Eddy et al., 2007; 
Fichter et al., 2017; Sullivan et al., 1996; Utzinger et al., 2015; Vaz-Leal et al., 2011; 
Wiklund et al., 2021). We selected anxiety, depression, ADHD, and gastrointestinal 
comorbidity based on studies in the literature that indicated a higher prevalence of these 
conditions in people with EDs and because of the emergent focus on the gut microbiome, 
genomic, and neurobiological mechanisms underlying binge eating and EDs, which is the 
focus of the parent study from which these data were drawn (Bulik et al., 2020; Bulik et 
al., 2022). The findings are expected to provide clinicians and researchers with insights into 
BED that may inform clinical care.

2.  Methods

2.1  Participants and Procedure

The study included 898 participants. Participants were from the Binge Eating Genetics 
Initiative-United States (BEGIN-US) study (Bulik et al., 2020). The goal of BEGIN-US was 
to recruit 1000 individuals with BN or BED to investigate the behavioral, genomic, and 
gut microbiota factors that underlie etiology, risk, and course of illness. BEGIN participants 
were recruited online and through a smartphone app, Recovery Record, which is an ED

self-monitoring tool that assists with meal, ED behavior, and emotion tracking. BEGIN-
US participants met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria. 1) 
lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 5th edition criteria (DSM-5) 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnosis of BN or BED with self-reported 
current binge eating; 2) resident of US; 3) age 18-45 years; 4) reads, speaks English; 5) 
existing iPhone user with iPhone 5 or later; 6) willing/able to wear Apple Watch for entire 
study period; 7) willing/able to use Recovery Record for the entire study period; 8) provides 
informed consent to have activity and self-reported Recovery Record data harvested; and 
9) ambulatory (able to walk). Exclusion criteria. 1) currently pregnant or breastfeeding; 2) 
bariatric surgery due to the impact on eating patterns, including the following: (Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, duodenal switch 
with biliopancreatic diversion, other gastrointestinal or weight loss surgery); 3) current use 
of hormone therapy; 4) inpatient treatment or hospitalization for EDs in the 2-weeks prior to 
study enrollment; 5) suicidal ideation at enrollment; or 6) antibiotic or probiotic use in the 
past 30 days (related to fecal sampling). For the present study, BEGIN-US participants with 
a lifetime history of BED were included (n = 904), and of these, six were excluded from 
this analysis because lifetime history of AN could not be determined. BEGIN participants 
completed all screening measures, consent, and measures within the Recovery Record app.

BEGIN-US was approved by the Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and all participants provided informed consent. 
BEGIN is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04162574).

2.2  Measures

2.2.1  Sociodemographic variables—Age, race, ethnicity, and biological sex were 
measured. Age, race, and ethnicity were self-reported in a survey and race and ethnicity 
were self-reported according to NIH categories. Sex was ascertained by DNA genotyping 
and/or survey self-report, as discussed in the Supplement.

2.2.2  ED diagnoses and history of ED behaviors—The Eating Disorders 100,000 
Questionnaire version 2 (ED100K.v2) was used to yield lifetime diagnoses of AN, BN, and 
BED based on DSM-5 criteria (Thornton et al., 2018). The ED100K, developed as part of 
the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI) to enable rapid, cost-effective recruitment 
of 100,000 ED cases for large-scale global genetic studies, aims to capture community-
recruited individuals with a personal history of EDs. The measure is self-report and 
web-based, and was developed based on the interviewer-administered Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) assessment of lifetime ED diagnoses (Eating Disorders 
Module H). Diagnostic questions from Module H were adapted to a self-report format 
(Thornton et al., 2018). A key challenge in differential diagnoses among the EDs is the 
challenge in specifying the time frame of symptoms to ensure that symptoms co-occur at the 
requisite frequency and duration and are distinct from exclusionary criteria, such as presence 
of AN for diagnoses of BN and BED and presence of recurrent inappropriate compensatory 
behaviors or BN for a diagnosis of BED. The ED100K meets these requirements by careful 
wording and computerized diagnostic algorithms that provide diagnoses according to DSM 
criteria. The ED100K.v2 has been updated to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

In addition to establishing history of ED diagnoses, the ED100K contains questions on the 
history of ED behaviors, including objective binge eating; self-induced vomiting; laxative, 
diuretic, diet pill use; excessive exercise; and fasting. With these questions, we formed 
variables on: i) prevalence; ii) age at onset; iii) chronicity, defined as the duration of an ED 
behavior for longer than one year; and iv) frequency, defined as whether an ED behavior 
occurred at least weekly for vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, and fasting, and for 
excessive exercise, every or nearly every day. The ED behaviors were combined to form 
a composite of “any ED behavior”. Binge eating was not included in the composites for 
“prevalence” and “frequency” because, by definition, all participants had engaged in binge 
eating at least once per week. Questions on chronicity began with the question stem, “for 
how long a period of time did you…” for each ED behavior, followed by the response 
options: “less than 1 month”, “1 to 2 months”, “3 to 5 months”, “6 to 12 months”, “more 
than 1 year”, and “don’t know”. Binary yes/no variables indicating whether duration was 
longer than a year were created from the responses. A duration of longer than a year was 
chosen a priori for analyses to reflect chronicity of symptoms. The variable distributions 
were checked for appropriateness before analysis to ensure this coding scheme did not 
produce small cell sizes in analyses, and thus prevent meaningful comparability. The 
question stem for the frequency variables was “how often did you usually use…” for each 
ED behavior, followed by the options “less than once a week”, “at least once a week”, 
“at least twice a week”, “every day/nearly every day”, and “don’t know”. Binary yes/no 
variables were created to indicate whether each behavior occurred at least once per week; 
for exercising excessively, once a week was considered unsuitable for conceptual reasons. 
“Every day/nearly every day” was chosen since this aligns with thoughts about this construct 
in previous research where “at least 5 times a week” has been used (Mond & Gorrell, 2021). 
The distributions of the frequency variables were checked before analysis to make sure the 
coding scheme did not produce small cell sizes. “Don't know” responses were recoded to 
missing.

Initial validation evidence supports the validity of the ED100K (Thornton et al., 2018). 
Random subsets of individuals drawn from samples in two countries completed ED100K 
and trained interviewers administered the SCID for comparison. The ED100K proved valid 
at assessing binge eating and also AN diagnosis, according to associations with SCID AN 
criterion B and C (positive predictive value ranged from .96-1.00 and negative predictive 
value was 1.00) and the high correlation between interview and self-report responses 
for lowest illness-related BMI (rs ranged between .91-.92). The validity of binge eating 
measured by the ED100K was also supported (Thornton et al., 2018).

2.2.3  Treatment and weight—BEGIN participants completed self-report questions on 
treatment and weight history. Participants were asked, “Have you ever received any of 
the following treatments for binge-eating disorder or bulimia nervosa? Check all that 
apply”, with a list which included inpatient treatment, residential treatment, emergency 
room treatment, cognitive-behavioral treatment (individual or group) (CBT), interpersonal 
psychotherapy (individual or group) (IPT), other type of psychotherapy, and never received 
any outpatient treatment for BED or BN. A question asked, “Have you ever received any 
of the following medications for binge eating? Check all that apply”. Participants were

presented with a list of prescribed psychiatric medications used in the treatment of BED and 
BN, weight-loss agents, the option to select “other medication” and provide information in 
a free-text comment (see Supplement), and the option to select never having ever taken any 
medication for binge eating. The list included chemical and brand names of drugs. Examples 
include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., Prozac, Zoloft), lisdexamfetamine 
(Vyvanse), topiramate (Topamax), bupropion (Wellbutrin), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and 
weight loss agents such as phentermine (Adipex), orlistat (Alli), phentermine/topiramate 
(Qsymia), naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave), and lorcaserin (Belviq). After data collection, 
responses were reviewed for each participant and binary yes/no variables were created for 
“psychiatric medication to treat BED or BN” and “prescription weight-loss medication”. 
Participants reported their current weight, and their lowest and highest (nonpregnancy) 
weight at their adult height, from which current, minimum, and maximum BMI (kg/m2) 
were calculated.

2.2.4  Current mental health—Current ED symptoms were assessed with the Eating 
Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) v6.0 (Fairburn & Beglin, 2008). Several 
screening instruments measured current depression, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms: the 
9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001), which is based on 
the nine criteria for depression in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000); 
the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006), which was 
developed and validated according to DSM-IV GAD criteria, and the 6-item World Health 
Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Screener (ASRS-6) (Kessler et al., 2005), 
which is consistent with DSM-IV ADHD criteria and was developed in conjunction with 
revisions of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. 
These validated measures have excellent psychometric properties (Johnson et al., 2019; 
Kessler et al., 2005; Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 2006). The theoretical scores range 
from 0 to 27 (PHQ-9), 0 to 21 (GAD-7), and 0 to 24 (ASRS-6). These measures had 
acceptable internal consistency in this study: EDE-Q Restraint (α = .80), Eating Concern (α 
= .75), Shape Concern (α = .82), Weight Concern (α = .68), and Global (α = .89), PHQ-9 
(α = .84), GAD-7 (α = .89), and ASRS-6 (α = .85). The cut-offs for positive screens for 
major depression (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are 10 on the PHQ-9 
and GAD-7, and for ADHD, four or more checkmarks in the shaded boxes of the ASRS-6 
(Kessler et al., 2005; Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 2006).

2.2.5  Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs)—Current diagnoses of DGBIs 
(formerly called functional gastrointestinal disorders; FGIDs) were assessed with the Rome 
III Adult Questionnaire (RIIIAQ). RIIIAQ is consistent with Rome III diagnostic criteria and 
was developed and validated by the Rome Foundation (Drossman, 2006, 2006). Participants 
completed the functional bowel disorders section, which assesses irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, and unspecified 
functional bowel disorder diagnoses. A variable summing these diagnoses represented the 
number of current DGBIs.

2.3  Statistical analysis

Page 7

Descriptive statistics summarized the full sample and group characteristics. Comparisons 
between the BED AN+ and BED AN− groups on i) sociodemographic variables, ii) history 
of BN and ED behaviors, iii) treatment and weight, and iv) current mental health and 
gastrointestinal comorbidity (DGBIs) involved analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi square 
test of independence, and Fisher’s exact test. The false discovery rate (FDR) procedure 
was applied to reduce the probability of Type I errors due to multiple testing (Benjamini 
& Hochberg, 1995). Effect sizes quantified the magnitude of the group differences (e.g., 
Cohen’s d, phi (φ)) (Cohen, 1988). Group differences were interpreted if FDR P < .05. 
Uncorrected P values are also presented for completeness.

Several participants did not complete these psychometric measures: EDE-Q (11%), PHQ-9 
(7%), GAD-7 (7%), ASRS-6 (7%), and RIIIAQ (7%). Seven further variables had a non-
negligible amount of missing data (i.e., >5%): six had 5-9% missingness and one had 14% 
missingness. There was no specific pattern to these missing values. Multiple imputation 
handled missing data and the results were pooled according to Rubin (1987) and Schafer 
(1997). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to rule out lifetime BN as a confound, to 
compare methods for handling missing data, and to address an acute diagnosis of BED on 
core and comorbid symptoms at the time of the study. The key findings were unchanged, as 
reported in the Supplement.

3.  Results

3.1  Participants

The full sample had 898 participants, of whom 14% had a lifetime AN diagnosis (BED 
AN+: n = 126) and 86% had no lifetime AN diagnosis (BED AN−, n = 772). In the BED 
AN+ group, 79% reported binge eating or vomiting, laxative use, or diuretic use for weight 
control while ill with AN, suggesting a lifetime prevalence of 11% for AN binge-purge 
subtype (AN-B/P) and 3% of AN-R in the full BED sample.

3.2  Sociodemographic characteristics

The mean age was 29.67 years (SD = 7.18) and sex was mostly female (87%), otherwise 
male (13%) or missing (0.3%). Most participants identified as White (86%) and non-
Hispanic (89%). Non-White participants reported their race as African American, Asian, 
Native American or mixed race (breakdowns of these race categories are suppressed due 
to small numbers to comply with regulatory frameworks on protection of personal health 
information). BED AN+ participants were significantly more likely to be younger (27.87 ± 
7.14 v 29.97 ± 7.15 yrs, F(1,896) = 9.31, FDR P = .01, Cohen’s d = −0.15) and female (95% 
v 86%, χ2(1) = 9.74, FDR P = .01, φ = .10) than BED AN− participants. There were no 
group differences on race (Fisher’s exact test FDR P = .49) or ethnicity (χ2(1) = 4.19, FDR 
P = .06, φ = .07).

3.3  History of BN and ED behaviors

BED AN+ and BED AN− were compared on history of BN and ED behaviors as shown in 
Table 1 and Figure 1. Supplementary Table 1 contains the sample descriptives and detailed

analysis results for the findings in Figure 1. A lifetime diagnosis of BN was common in 
BED AN+ and BED AN−, and significantly more common in BED AN+. Most participants 
reported engaging in ED behaviors besides binge eating at some point in their life (92%), 
particularly fasting and excessive exercise (Table S1). BED AN+ were significantly more 
likely to report excessive exercise, vomiting, laxative use, diuretic use and younger onset 
of ED behaviors compared to BED AN− (φs: .08–.16). Many reported chronic (i.e., lasting 
longer than 1 year) and frequent (occurred at least once per week at some time(s) in their 
lives, and for excessive exercise, every or nearly every day) ED behaviors, although a 
significantly higher proportion in BED AN+ (Figure 1B-C). Effect sizes on the chronicity 
and frequency variables ranged from φ = .04–.24 and φ = .03–.23, respectively. There was 
no significant difference in binge eating age at onset between BED AN+ and BED AN−. 
Participants were asked whether they had ever used vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, 
excessive exercise, or fasting to compensate for binge eating. The majority of participants 
had used compensatory behaviors (87%). The BED AN+ group was significantly more 
likely than the BED AN− group to have compensated for binge eating with vomiting, 
laxative use, diuretic use, excessive exercise, and any ED behavior (φs: .09–.18) (Figure 1D).

In further analyses, only individuals with a lifetime history of each specific ED behavior 
were analyzed. AN was still associated with significantly more frequent and chronic ED 
behaviors (Figure 1E-F). Effect sizes for the significant findings ranged from φ = .14–.23 
for the frequency and φ = .10–.20 for the chronicity comparisons. These analyses addressed 
whether BED-AN+ demonstrated greater chronicity and frequency simply due to these 
behaviors being more common in the BED-AN+ sample, and therefore greater opportunity 
to observe more chronic and frequent behaviors (i.e., a confound). The results established 
that BED-AN+ participants had greater chronicity and frequency of these behaviors in 
their lifetime compared with BED AN−, irrespectively, thus supporting the hypothesis that 
comorbidity is associated with greater burden.

3.4  History of ED treatment, weight, and prescription weight-loss treatment

As shown in Table 1, 62% of the full sample reported being treated for BED or BN. 
Supporting our hypothesis, those in the BED AN+ group reported significantly greater 
treatment utilization for their binge-eating problem compared to those in the BED AN− 
group, more specifically, significantly higher utilization of psychiatric medication, CBT, 
IPT, residential, inpatient treatment, and emergency room services.

The majority in the full sample had a BMI ≥ 25 (79%) and 20% had a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9. 
Supporting our hypothesis, BED AN+ had a significantly lower current BMI, minimum 
adult BMI, and maximum adult BMI compared to BED AN−. There were no significant 
group differences in the percentage who had received prescription weight-loss treatment.

3.5  Current mental health

Descriptive statistics and group comparisons on ED, depression, anxiety, and ADHD 
symptoms at the time of the study can be found in Table 1. The full sample EDE-Q 
Global M ± SD score was 3.9 ± 1.0 and the EDE-Q frequency of binge eating over the 
past 28 days was 13.2 ± 9.6. These scores are comparable to clinical samples, including

a treatment-seeking sample of 86 people with BED (EDE-Q Global, 3.5 ± 0.8, EDE-Q 
frequency of binge eating 13.7 ± 11.7) (Aardoom et al., 2012; Reas et al., 2006). GAD-7 
was significantly higher in the BED AN+ group compared to the BED AN− group, in 
support of our hypothesis of a higher burden of illness in participants with lifetime AN. 
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the other measures. 
A sensitivity analysis incorporating current BED diagnostic status as a covariate produced 
the same findings (Supplementary section 3.3). A supplementary analysis comparing current 
symptoms among those with current BED did not reveal any statistically significant 
differences and effect sizes were small to nil (Supplementary section 4, Supplementary 
Table 4).

3.6  DGBIs

In the full sample, DGBI screening-based diagnoses were common, particularly IBS, 
functional bloating, and unspecified functional bowel disorder (Table 3). Cohen’s d 
indicated a higher mean number of DGBIs in the BED AN+ group compared to the BED 
AN− group.

4.  Discussion

We compared adults with lifetime BED with and without lifetime AN to characterize 
and compare the clinical phenomenology. Due to the recruitment criteria, all participants 
endorsed current binge eating. Both groups reported substantial clinical burden over the 
average 15 years between reported symptom onset and study recruitment; however, a 
diagnosis of AN was broadly associated with more pathology.

The BED AN+ group had a younger onset of ED behaviors, broader range of ED symptoms, 
and were more likely to have frequent and chronic ED behaviors and a lifetime BN 
diagnosis, and worse general anxiety compared to the BED AN− group. These findings 
align with research demonstrating poorer outcomes for people with BN with a history 
of AN (Eddy et al., 2007; Vaz-Leal et al., 2011) and evidence that comorbidity, broadly-
speaking, increases burden of illness (Angold et al., 1999). Unlike anxiety, other symptoms 
including eating pathology, depression, ADHD, and gastrointestinal problems were not 
significantly more severe in the comorbid group. This suggests that the absence of lifetime 
AN comorbidity does not diminish impairment or association in these areas, which were 
highly impacted across the whole sample. Since those findings were not in line with 
expectations, future studies with other samples will be helpful for clarifying the association 
between lifetime AN comorbidity and illness burden. Group differences hypothesized from 
the epidemiological and clinical profile of AN were supported (Bulik et al., 2000; Fichter 
et al., 2017; Udo & Grilo, 2018). Those in the BED AN+ group were more likely to be 
female with lower current, minimum, and maximum BMIs, and to have a younger onset of 
ED behaviors and higher prevalence of weight control and compensatory behaviors in their 
clinical history.

Several findings have clinical implications. Many participants screened positive for GAD, 
MDD, and gastrointestinal disorders. Screening for major mental health comorbidities in all 
ED patients at clinical assessment is therefore recommended. As many patients commonly

report that negative moods drive binges, mental health comorbidities are an essential 
component of case conceptualization (Dingemans et al., 2017). The triad of EDs, anxiety, 
and DGBI is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential mechanism of risk and 
maintenance of EDs (Bulik et al., 2021; Peters et al., 2021; Wiklund et al., 2021; Zucker & 
Bulik, 2020). Our findings encourage referral for management of comorbid gastrointestinal 
conditions in order to improve health outcomes for ED patients. The prevalence of IBS of 
31% and unspecified functional bowel disorder of 73% in our sample are relatively higher 
than the 9% (95% CI: 7-10%) and 10% (95% CI: 9-11%) prevalence, respectively, among 
adults in the general population in the United States (Palsson et al., 2020). It remains to be 
seen whether the higher prevalence of DGBIs is specific to EDs or common to psychological 
disorders.

Both groups reported near universal prevalence of ED behaviors besides binge eating (i.e., 
vomiting, laxative use, diuretic use, excessive exercise, and fasting) in their lifetime clinical 
history. These behaviors are sometimes referred to as unhealthy weight control behaviors 
(UWCB). Given that the hallmark of BED is a prolonged period of binge eating in the 
absence of the regular use of UWCB, this finding is notable. There is a large theoretical 
and empirical literature implicating restraint as a developmental precursor to binge eating, 
but how emergence of UWCB relates to onset of BED is unclear. A recent prospective 
study indicated that recurrent UWCB predicted future onset of clinical EDs, including BED 
marginally (OR = 1.17; 95% 0.99-1.35) (Stice et al., 2021). In over a third of individuals 
seeking treatment for BED, UWCB had predated binge eating (Stice et al., 2021). Similarly, 
in our study, UWCB emerged an average two years prior to binge eating and during 
adolescence. Identifying and intervening with adolescents who engage in UWCB may help 
to prevent the onset of future EDs, including BED. A clinical implication is that if there is a 
history of such behaviors in BED patients, clinicians may want to incorporate these features 
into case formulation and address them in relapse prevention. Our clinical experience with 
patients with BED is that within their clinical history some extensively ruminate on these 
behaviors and then abandon them after early attempts, some regularly engage in these 
behaviors outside BED episodes, and some engage in them occasionally.

The 14% prevalence of lifetime AN in our BED population is higher than the 1%-10% 
previously reported in treatment-seeking BED samples (Mathisen et al., 2018; Utzinger et 
al., 2015). This finding could be due to differences in diagnostic assessment, for instance, 
Utzinger et al. used a clinical diagnostic interview for diagnosing EDs. Mathisen et al. used 
a similar approach to us of screening for DSM-5 criteria using a self-report questionnaire. 
Longitudinal studies have found very low crossover between AN and BED in either 
direction (0%-2%) while actively following research participants over an average 6 to 8 
years (Castellini et al., 2011; Schaumberg et al., 2019; Stice et al., 2013). The lower rate in 
these studies is due to the more limited time frame and reliance on assessment of current 
diagnosis at each wave, whereas the aforementioned studies measured lifetime history. 
Longitudinal epidemiological samples using well-validated diagnostic methods are needed 
to fully understand the prevalence of comorbid lifetime BED and AN, sequence of onset, 
and risk factors for diagnostic crossover.

In this study, individuals with lifetime AN endorsed greater treatment utilization. The 
questions regarding treatment utilization captured treatment received for either BN or BED 
(BN/BED). The difference remained apparent in sensitivity analyses that addressed BN as 
a confound, suggesting that something about lifetime AN history might influence treatment 
utilization. The perceived severity of AN, or the experience of AN treatment may lead 
patients, family, and health care providers to be more likely to engage in or recommend 
treatment among these BED patients. Treatment for AN-B/P and treatment for BN may 
also have been conflated by participants because clinically, many patients have difficulty 
distinguishing between these diagnoses, and thus treatment for AN-B/P may have been 
reported as treatment for BN. Recognizing all types of EDs is crucial for primary care 
providers and screening for EDs facilitates access to care (Citrome, 2017). Patients may not 
disclose their BED symptoms because of embarrassment or may lack knowledge that they 
have a mental health condition that is treatable (Citrome, 2017). Participants in this study, 
who were all community-recruited, reported an average age at onset of binge eating 12 years 
prior to the study and 2 in every 5 people had never been treated for BN/BED.

Future research in other samples and comparisons of more diverse factors would be helpful. 
Although we compared a large range of variables, they were focused in nature. AN and 
BED lifetime comorbidity is an intriguing clinical presentation. Some with AN are never 
able to override restrictive eating behaviors, and become chronically unwell and at risk of 
starvation-related death. The comorbidity pattern of AN and BED involves extreme nutrition 
transitions, and points to “switches” for turning up and down self-starvation and control over 
eating. Such mechanisms might reside in novel biological, genomic, or behavioral factors 
that inform treatment development. Further investigation into the factors associated with AN 
and BED comorbidity might also yield insight into the developmental course and etiology of 
particular presentations of BED.

There were several study limitations. There was a reliance on self-report instruments 
and a clinician-administered diagnostic interview was not used. Evidence that self-report 
instruments can produce reliable and valid diagnoses has largely been restricted to current 
ED diagnosis, and further validation of the ED100K to capture lifetime diagnoses is 
warranted. We had no data to determine if BED occurred before or after AN, although 
AN is reported to predate BED in most instances (Castellini et al., 2011; Stice et al., 2013; 
Welch et al., 2016). As recruitment involved community-based methods, the findings can 
be generalized to individuals in the community who have had BED and are still engaging 
in binge eating. However, it is unclear whether the findings generalize to BED clinic 
samples. The use of convenience sampling means that population representativeness cannot 
be assured. We were unable to investigate the role of AN subtype because of small sample 
cell sizes. White women comprised the majority of participants and only adults aged 18-45 
years were recruited, which limits generalizability. Some of the measures in this study were 
retrospective, which raises the possibility that memory or reporting bias may have affected 
the results.

In summary, our findings suggest that lifetime AN may be associated with poorer outcomes 
and a greater burden of illness in people with BED. Mental health and gastrointestinal 
comorbidity was very common in our full sample, emphasizing the importance of a

Figure 1. Comparison of the history and course of eating disorder behaviors in the lifetime 
binge-eating disorder with lifetime anorexia nervosa (BED AN+; n = 126) and lifetime binge-
eating disorder only (BED AN−; n = 772) groups.
(A) Comparison of unhealthy weight control behaviors in the full sample. (B) Comparison 
of the chronicity of eating disorder behaviors in the full sample. (C) Comparison of the 
frequency of eating disorder behaviors in the full sample. (D) Comparison of the prevalence 
of binge-eating compensatory behaviors in the full sample. (E) Comparison of the chronicity 
of eating disorder behaviors in the subsample analyses: subsample analyses only included 
individuals who endorsed ever using that behavior. (F) Comparison of the frequency of 
eating disorder behaviors in the subsample analyses: subsample analyses only included 
individuals who endorsed ever using that behavior. Eating disorder behaviors were measured 
with the ED100K. In each figure, “any” is a composite of vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, 
diet pills, excessive exercise, and fasting, and for B and E also includes binge eating. 
For exercise, the frequency plotted in C and F is “every day/nearly every day”; for all
