Abstract
Background and aims  The concept of "Food Addiction" has been based on criteria of Substance Use Disorder. Several studies 
suggested a relationship between food addiction and eating disorders, but little is known about its extent or role.
We aim at exploring if food addiction is coincident with a specific eating disorder (binge eating disorder appears the closest) 
or it is a separate diagnostic entity that afflicts in comorbidity with eating disorders or other conditions like obesity or even 
in the general population.
Methods  This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed observational studies with a comparative estimation on rates 
of subjects affected by binge eating disorder and food addiction.
Results  Binge eating disorder shows higher comorbidity with food addiction compared to other eating disorders (OR = 1.33, 
95% CI, 0.64–2.76;  c2 = 4.42; p = 0.44;I2 = 0%), or each eating disorder [anorexia nervosa purging type (OR = 1.93, 95% 
CI, 0.20–18.92; p = 0.57) and restrictive type (OR = 8.75, 95% CI, 1.08–70.70; p = 0.04)], obese patients (OR = 5.72, 95% 
CI, 3.25–10.09; p =  < 0.0001) and individuals from the general population (OR = 55.41, 95% CI, 8.16–376.10;  c2 = 18.50; 
p < 0.0001; I2 = 0%)but has decreased prevalence when compared to bulimia nervosa (OR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.33–2.22; 
 c2 = 0.35; p = 0.74; I2 = 0%).
Discussion and conclusions  Our data show that the prevalence of food addiction in binge eating disorder is higher than in 
other eating disorders except in bulimia nervosa. Moreover, it is a separate diagnostic reality and can be detected in people 
without mental illness and in the general population.
Food addiction might have a prognostic value, since in comorbidity, and should be addressed to boost treatment efficacy 
and patient’s recovery.
Level of evidence  I: Evidence obtained systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Background

Overeating, obesity and eating disorders are serious issues 
of the modern wealthy societies worldwide.

The reasons why some people chronically overeat and 
are unable to limit their food intake have been examined. A 
growing number of clinical and neurobiological evidence

has shown that, in vulnerable subjects, persistent overeating 
may lead to a pattern of compulsive behavior similar to that 
of drug abuse and other addictive disorders  [1–4].

The need of a better definition of this behavioral model 
led to the formulation of the concept of "Food Addiction" 
which gained a growing interest in the scientific literature 
focused on eating disorders with particular attention to the 
underlying neurobiological and phenomenological mecha-
nisms [5].

The term "Food Addiction" has been built on behavior 
and subjective experiences related to food consumption 
that resemble criteria of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) 
(e.g., strong urge to consume, exacerbated by abstinence,

and failure to limit consumption despite the awareness of 
toxicity)  [6].

From a biological perspective, many neurobiochemical 
and  neurogenetic  studies  proved  typical  mechanisms  of 
addictions are crucial in problematic nutrition. Genetic simi-
larities between overeating and substance addiction are vari-
ants in the genes encoding the dopamine D2 receptor allele 
of the ANKKI gene (e.g., Taq1 (rs1800497) and transporter 
(e.g., SLC6A3, DAT1) and opioid receptor genes (OPRM1 
gene) [7]. Furthermore, illicit drugs and food exert the same 
gratifying effect through the activation of dopamine neu-
rons in the ventral tegmental area with consequent release 
of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and effects on the 
mesolimbic pathway  [8].

Although the definition of Food Addiction (FA) is not yet 
categorized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders, the academic debate on a possible addictive 
potential of food keeps going [9]. In fact, many overlapping 
criteria with the DSM-5 drug addiction include: (1) sub-
stance taken in larger quantities and for a longer period than 
expected; (2) persistent desire or repeated failed attempts 
to quit; (3) a large amount of time and energy spent on 
obtaining, using or disposing of substances; (4) reduction 
of important social, occupational, or recreational activities 
because of substance use; (5) continued use despite knowl-
edge of the negative consequences; (6) tolerance; and (7) 
withdrawal symptoms  [10].

The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS)

The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) has been developed 
by Gearhardt [10], as a first categorical attempt of the con-
cept of FA.

The YFAS is a 25-item self-report questionnaire that 
adapts the diagnostic criteria of substance dependence of the 
DSM IV-TR to eating behavior or abuse of specific foods. 
Currently, it is the only validated tool for assessing symp-
toms of "food addiction".

It  has  several  categories  of  scoring:  symptoms  count 
(seven diagnostic criteria) and a diagnostic threshold that 
reflects the criteria for the diagnosis of substance depend-
ence (the presence of three or more symptoms plus clinically 
significant impairment or distress).

Up to 11.4% of the general population may show symp-
toms of food addiction, while approximately 25–42% of 
obese patients meet the YFAS criteria [11].

The concept of binge eating

Binge eating disorder (BED) is an eating disorder charac-
terized by recurrent episodes of bingeing, in the absence of 
compensatory behaviors (purging, overexercize etc.). [12].

A binge episode is defined as eating an unusually large 
amount of food over a discrete period of time associated 
with a subjective sense of loss of control while eating  [13].
The presence of BED in individuals with obesity has been 
associated with a significant increase in the risk of psycho-
social, psychiatric, and medical problems [14].

It is estimated that 15.7% to 40% of obese patients suffer 
from BED [15, 16] as well as between 1.12% and 6.6% of 
the general population  [17, 18].

The Binge Eating Scale (BES) is the basic tool used to 

confirm a clinical diagnosis of BED [18].

Association/overlaps between BED and FA

As  mentioned  above,  phenotypic  overlaps  have  been 
observed between the definition of food addiction and binge 
eating disorder [19].

Both BED and food addiction are characterized by the 
loss of control over consumption, continued overuse despite 
negative  consequences,  and  repeated  failed  attempts  to 
reduce consumption. Because of these similarities, meas-
ures of binge eating disorder (BED) and food addiction 
(YFAS) are often highly correlated, highlighting difficul-
ties in assessing and distinguishing those two different con-
structs [20, 21]. Some preliminary evidence reporting high 
frequencies of FA in patients with BED suggests that the co-
occurrence of BED and FA may represent a more disturbed 
BED subgroup  [22].

Emerging research suggests that binge eating and food 
addiction, while sharing many characteristics, may have 
important distinctions. In samples of individuals with BED, 
the frequency of food addiction ranges from 42 to 57%, sug-
gesting that, despite the multiple similarities, the constructs 
do not completely overlap. Furthermore, in the study by Ger-
hardt et al., authors show that, compared to patients with 
BED without food addiction, participants with BED and 
food addiction had significantly higher levels of low self-
esteem, depression, negative affect, emotional dysregulation, 
but they did not show significantly different levels of dietary 
moderation. A link between the severity of food addiction 
and eating disorders was, therefore, hypothesized, providing 
FA with a prognostic value  [10, 20].

Food addiction and other eating disorders (EDs)

Food addiction shows significant diagnostic overlaps with 
other EDs as well, especially with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), an 

1 3

1965

eating disorder characterized by the presence of binge eating 
episodes with compensatory behaviors that do not occur in 
BED. Furthermore, BN is linked to impaired reward sensi-
tivity in dopaminergic brain circuit, increasing the addictive 
potential [23]. Moreover, some studies emphasize that many 
patients affected by BN may have a body weight within the 
normal range but may also be addicted to food [24,  25]. 
Additionally, even if without a systematic evaluation, some 
studies attest an association between FA and BN ranging 
from 81 to 97% [26, 27]. Even with fundamental differences, 
in fact, common overlapping symptoms between FA, BED 
and BN exist (e.g., reduced feeding control, continued use 
despite negative consequences)  [1, 11].

An interesting further point ascribes food restriction, 
typical of anorexia nervosa (AN) to addictive behaviors (or 
"hunger addiction") [28]. Szmukler e Tamtam suggest that 
"patients with AN are dependent on the psychological and 
possibly physiological effects of starvation. Increased weight 
loss results from tolerance to starvation necessitating greater 
restriction of food to obtain the desired effect, and the later 
development of unpleasant ‘withdrawal’ symptoms on eat-
ing” [29].

The existence of food addiction as a separate entity, as 
well as its role in several eating disorders is still unclear and 
poor explored. The aim of the present systematic review and 
meta-analysis is to attest to the prevalence of FA in different 
eating disorders and its existence.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed 
according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology guidelines [30]. Procedures and study inclu-
sion criteria were defined a priori and registered in PROS-
PERO (an international prospective register of systematic 
reviews-CDR42020215998).

of the following search terms: binge eating disorder, food 
addiction. We contacted corresponding authors of selected 
studies if additional information was required.

Eligibility criteria

We included observational studies with a comparative esti-
mation on rates of subjects affected by binge eating disorder 
and food addiction. We included studies that defined binge 
eating disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria. We 
excluded studies without an appropriate comparison group, 
those that did not clearly define food addiction, and case 
reports. To reduce the risk of misclassification errors, we 
included only high-quality studies, with unequivocal defi-
nitions. If data from the same sample were published in 
multiple works, we retained only the studies published in 
peer-reviewed journals, excluding conference abstracts and 
dissertations.

Terms and definitions

According  to  Randolph,  who  introduced  the  concept  in 
1956, the term “Food Addiction” refers to specific food 
related behaviors characterized by excessive and dysregu-
lated consumption of palatable and high calorie food.

More  recently,  food  addiction  has  been  defined  as  a 
chronic, relapsing condition caused by the interaction of 
many complex variables that increase the desire for certain 
specific foods to achieve a state of elevated pleasure, energy 
or arousal, or to alleviate negative emotional or physical 
states, coming closer to the criteria defining addictive dis-
orders [11, 31].

A food addiction or eating addiction is characterized by 
the compulsive consumption of palatable (e.g., high fat and 
high sugar) foods which markedly activate the reward system 
in humans and other animals despite adverse consequences.

Data sources and search strategy

Data collection process

A  systematic  search  for  articles  published  in  electronic 
databases (PubMed, Embase and PsychINFO) through Sep-
tember 24, 2020, was performed with no time or language 
restrictions. The selected databases report documents whose 
titles and abstracts are in written in fluent English, some-
times together with titles and abstracts in authors’ native 
language. The manuscript main text might be in English or 
in authors’ native language, depending from each journal 
rules. Our search produced five results whose main text was 
not written in English but their titles/abstracts entailed their 
exclusion according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Search 
phrases combined thesaurus and free-search indexing terms 
related to eating disorder and addiction, using combinations 

Three authors (E.d.G, F.P., and F.A.) preliminarily reviewed 
titles and abstracts of traced articles. The initial screening 
was followed by the analysis of full texts to check compat-
ibility regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discord-
ances were analyzed and disagreements were resolved by 
discussion among all the authors. When reported informa-
tion was unclear or ambiguous or numerical data were not 
obtainable by percentages, the relevant corresponding author 
was contacted for clarification.

Data extraction

930 Records identified through database searching 

A standardized form was used to extract data, including 
information on year of publication, country, setting, charac-
teristics of study participants (sample size, age, and percent-
ages of men and women), eating disorders, and food addic-
tion. If raw numerical data were not reported, they were 
calculated by percentages, deriving crude odds ratios (ORs). 
Two authors (E.d.G. and F.A.) conducted data extraction 
independently; extraction sheets for each study were cross-
checked for consistency, and any differences were resolved 
by discussion among the coauthors.

Statistical analysis

Meta-analysis of the overall comparison of food addiction 
rates among subjects affected by eating disorders and each 
type of eating disorder compared with binge eating was 
performed, and pooled ORs with 95% CIs were generated 
using inversed variance models (DerSimonian–Laird) with 
random effects [32, 33]. Results were summarized using 
conventional forest plots. Standard χ2 tests and the I2 sta-
tistic (i.e., the percentage of variability in prevalence esti-
mates attributable to heterogeneity rather than sampling 
error or chance, with values ≥ 75% indicating high hetero-
geneity) were used to assess between-study heterogeneity 
[34]. To test for publication bias, we performed funnel 
plot analysis and the Egger test on all studies stratified by 
eating disorder (bulimia nervosa, other eating disorders) 
and general population. Thus, three separate Egger tests 
were performed. The Egger test quantifies bias captured 
in the funnel plot analysis with linear regression using the 
value of effect sizes and their precision (SE) and assumes 
that the quality of study conduct is independent of study 
size. If analyses showed a significant risk of publication 
bias, we would use the trim and fill method to estimate 
the number of missing studies and the adjusted effect size 
[35–37]. Meta-regression analysis was performed to exam-
ine sources of between-study heterogeneity if of a high 
level (I2  > 75%) on a range of study prespecified charac-
teristics (i.e., sample size, age, and country).

All  analyses  were  performed  using  R,  version  3.2.3 
(meta and metaphor packages; R Foundation for Statisti-
cal Computing). Statistical tests were two sided and used 
a significance threshold of P < 0.05.

Results

Study characteristics

Six studies that involved a total of 2476 subjects (539 
affected  by  binge  eating  disorder,  178  by  bulimia  ner-
vosa, 18 by eating disorder NOS, 65 by anorexia nervosa 
restrictive, 33 by anorexia nervosa purging, 442 subjects 
with obesity and 1146 people from the general population 
without eating disorders) were included in the analysis 
(see Fig. 1). The studies were conducted in 5 countries 
(Australia, Canada, France, Spain and the United States). 
All articles were published after 2014 (one in 2014, two 
in 2017, two in 2019 and one in 2020). Most of the studies 
had sample weight of less than 10%, whereas one study 
had sample weight of 20% and one higher than 50%. All 
study characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Prevalence of food addiction in binge eating

Patients  affected  by  binge  eating  disorder  have  an 
increased  prevalence  of  food  addiction  compared  to 
patients with other eating disorders (OR = 1.33, 95% CI, 
0.64–2.76;  c2 = 4.42; p = 0.44; I2 = 0%)(see Fig. 2).

The  prevalence  of  food  addiction  in  patients  affected 
by  binge  eating  disorder  is  reduced  compared  to  that 
of  patients  with  bulimia  nervosa  (OR = 0.85,  95%  CI,

Prevalence of food addiction in binge eating

Patients affected by binge eating disorder have an increased 
prevalence of food addiction compared to subjects from the 
general population without eating disorders (OR = 55.41, 
95% CI, 8.16–376.10;  c2 = 18.50; p =  < 0.0001;  I2 = 89%)
(see Fig. 4).

Publication bias

There was no evidence of publication bias in studies focused 
on the bulimia nervosa group (Egger test; SE,  – 1.20; 95% 
CI,  – 18.01 to 15.60; P = 0.26), for studies focused on other 
EDs (Egger test; SE, 1.65; 95% CI,  – 4.29 to 7.60; P = 0.24) 
and studies focused on the general population (Egger test; 
SE, 3.77; 95% CI,  – 10.23 to 17.78; P = 0.09).

Sources of heterogeneity

Univariable and multivariable meta-regressions weighted for 
the study weight were performed on the following variables 
that were potentially associated with heterogeneity: (1) the 
country where the study was conducted (2) the year of pub-
lication. The mean age of the samples and the percentage of 
females within each group were not available or calculable 
in most of the studies.

None of the parameters, including the sample weight, or 
a combination of parameters was sufficient to explain het-
erogeneity detected in the studies focused on the general 
population.

Discussion

The concept of “Food Addiction” arose thanks to the iden-
tification of common features between drug addiction and 
some behavioral disturbance in food intake. Even if it is not 
classified in the DSM-5, a diagnostic tool has been devel-
oped applying diagnostic criteria of drug addiction to food.
Starting from evidence of a comorbidity between food 
addiction and eating disorders, this meta-analysis focus on 

measuring the extent of that comorbidity in each eating dis-
order. Binge eating disorder was theoretically the closest 
construct to that of food addiction. On the contrary, data 
proves that the prevalence of food addiction in binge eating 
disorder is higher than in other eating disorders except in 
bulimia nervosa. People affected by bulimia nervosa, in fact, 
dwell with food addiction more than people with binge eat-
ing disorder, even if the result is not statistically significant. 
Such evidence is fascinating and deserves considerations. 
First of all, BED, BN and FA have overlapping symptoms 
that may contribute to those results. More interestingly, 
some authors supported the description of BN as an eating 
behavior similar to addiction. [25–27], thus reinforcing the 
addictive nature of that disorder.

Beyond overlaps that may justify the presence of FA in 
patients affected by a specific eating disorder or another, it is 
crucial to underline that FA is detected in subjects without any 
eating disorder, even if with obesity, but also in subjects from 
the general population and without any psychiatric issue. Even 
though the prevalence of FA in those people is sensibly lower, 
it is observed, encouraging the idea that FA might be a dif-
ferent and separate entity from a specific eating disorder. The 
presence of an addictive component in some subjects affected 
by eating disorders might influence their treatments and out-
comes if not rightly addressed. A further consideration, which 
is supportive to the need of recognizing the presence of addic-
tive characteristics in some subjects with eating disorders is 
stressed by authors who blame impulsivity for EDs treatment 
failure or relapses [38].

•  Strength and limits—This study relies on a large and inclu-
sive sample size, recruited through a systematic search of 
well planned and carried out studies without any restric-
tion (language, time, country). A possible limitation is that 
the Yale Food Addiction Scale is a self-reported tool, but, 
at the moment, it is the only acknowledged instrument to 
measure food addiction.

•  Other  psychiatric  comorbidities  were  not  specifically 
reported in all studies as well as gender composition among 
participants. Furthermore, patients with eating disorders 
were recruited in Eating Disorders Psychiatric Depart-

What is already known on this subject?

References

The concept of “Food addiction” gained more and more 
interest  in  recent  years.  Its  neurobiology  and  possible 
comorbidity or inclusion within eating disorders are still 
poor examined.

What does this study add?

This is the first systematic research, to our knowledge, that 
demonstrates the existence of food addiction as a separate 
entity from any eating disorder or other psychiatric illness. 
This evidence stresses the need of further studies for a better 
comprehension and treatment implications.

Conclusion

Food addiction is a reality that gained more and more atten-
tion in the last years. Our work provides important evidences 
that FA is a separate entity from different eating disorders 
and afflicts each of them to a different degree. Some authors 
hypothesize that food addiction could have a prognostic 
value [26] and results from this systematic review allow the 
possibility to credit food addiction as worsening a comorbid 
eating disorder As a consequence, we strongly encourage 
the evaluation of the presence of food addiction in patients 
with eating disorders as well as in those with obesity to tailor 
their treatment with greater precision and address all the 
components that may influence patient’s response to treat-
ment and his/her outcomes.
