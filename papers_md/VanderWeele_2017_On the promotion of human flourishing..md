PERSPECTIVE

On the promotion of human flourishing

Many empirical studies throughout the social and biomedical sciences focus only on very narrow outcomes
such as income, or a single specific disease state, or a measure of positive affect. Human well-being or
flourishing, however, consists in a much broader range of states and outcomes, certainly including mental
and physical health, but also encompassing happiness and life satisfaction, meaning and purpose,
character and virtue, and close social relationships. The empirical literature from longitudinal, experimen-
tal, and quasiexperimental studies is reviewed in attempt to identify major determinants of human
flourishing, broadly conceived. Measures of human flourishing are proposed. Discussion is given to the
implications of a broader conception of human flourishing, and of the research reviewed, for policy, and
for future research in the biomedical and social sciences.

The World Health Organization defines health as “a
state of complete physical, mental, and social well-
being” (1). Much of the discipline of economics is al-
legedly devoted to the maximization of some notion
of expected utility, supposedly taking into account all
aspects of an agent’s preferences. The goal of the dis-
cipline of positive psychology is sometimes articulated
as “the scientific study of the strengths that enable in-
dividuals and communities to thrive” (Positive Psychol-
ogy Center, University of Pennsylvania; https://ppc.sas.
upenn.edu/). However, our actual empirical studies in
medicine and public health, in psychology, in econom-
ics, and in many other disciplines are often restricted to
very narrow outcomes. Empirical research in health typ-
ically addresses only a single disease; many psycholog-
ical studies focus only on the alleviation of symptoms;
empirical studies in economics not infrequently only
examine effects on income or the production and con-
sumption of goods and services. If a central goal of
these disciplines is more fundamentally contributing
to some broader notion of human well-being, then it
would seem that the empirical studies and the mea-
sures used should more often consider a broader con-
ception of well-being and flourishing, and that our
investigations into etiology should likewise examine
the causes and interventions that most contribute to
human flourishing, broadly conceived. In this paper, I

would like to outline a proposal concerning shifting
empirical research in that direction. I will discuss a num-
ber of broader outcome measures that might be used,
and I will discuss, based on current evidence, what
seem to be substantial determinants of human flourish-
ing. I will finally comment on the implications of this for
policy and for future empirical research in the biomed-
ical and social sciences (2–10).

On Human Flourishing
Various measures of subjective well-being have been
proposed in the positive-psychology literature (11–14).
Some of the most widely used measures concern either
happiness conceived of as a positive affective state,
sometimes referred to as “hedonic happiness,” or alter-
natively overall life satisfaction, sometimes referred to as
“evaluative happiness” (15). Representative questions,
often rated on a scale of 0–10, include the following: “In
general, how happy or unhappy do you usually feel?”
(14) or “Overall, how satisfied are you with life as a whole
these days?” (16). More recently, broader composite
measures have been proposed encompassing numer-
ous aspects of psychological well-being (17–21). These
composite measures sometimes include positive affect
and life satisfaction but also a collection of others such
as meaning, purpose, autonomy, self-acceptance, opti-
mism, positive relationships, mastery, self-determination,

resilience, personal growth, vitality, engagement, and self-esteem.
Different measures combine different subsets of these various at-
tributes. These broader composite measures or certain items of
these broader measures are sometimes referred to as measures
of “eudaimonic” happiness or well-being (15). As measures of
psychological well-being, many of these may be reasonable. How-
ever, there are long-standing traditions that suggest that flourishing
consists of something more than one’s mental state and how one
feels about various aspects of life.

Notably absent from most of these lists is, for example, virtue.
However, in the philosophical literature, arguments have been put
forward that virtue is a central component of flourishing; Aristotle
argued that happiness is attained by action in accord with virtue
(22). There is a tradition in philosophy of the cardinal virtues: that
at the foundation of all of the moral virtues and character strengths
lie four fundamental virtues upon which all others depend. These
four are sometimes referred to as: prudence or practical wisdom;
justice; fortitude or courage; and temperance or moderation (23).
Perhaps aspects of fortitude are touched upon in “resilience”; per-
haps aspects of temperance in “self-determination”, but what of
justice or wisdom? A focus on purely psychological aspects of life
misses these.

Also notably absent from the aforementioned list of aspects of
psychological flourishing is health. However, health is arguably
central to a person’s sense of wholeness and well-being. Possibly
some of the reason health is excluded is so as to be able to ex-
amine relationships between positive psychological states and
subsequent physical health, and indeed there is a reasonably well-
established literature that has done this (24–26). Composite
measures of psychological well-being might indeed be better
predictors of subsequent health than simply using life satisfaction.
However, if what is of principal interest is an overall assessment of
complete well-being, or flourishing, then health should arguably
be included.

Moreover, even if we were to restrict consideration to an as-
sessment of psychological well-being, it is not clear why the
composite measures of psychological well-being are preferable to
overall self-assessed life satisfaction, as a fundamental assessment
for tracking the progress of life. The life satisfaction measure al-
lows an individual to weight the various components of psycho-
logical well-being, and other aspects of life, as he or she sees fit.
Must one include all of the psychological states above? Someone
might not want to give much weight to optimism on the grounds
that those who are overly optimistic may be more likely to have a
distorted view of reality (27–29). Someone might likewise not want
to give much weight to “self-acceptance” because excessive self-
acceptance might hinder growth in virtue or character. Life satis-
faction measures, in which an individual weights the various as-
pects of their life as they see fit, might thus be a better summary of
psychological well-being.

However, life satisfaction or psychological well-being do not
capture all that we would ordinarily mean by flourishing. That
flourishing is yet broader seems clear from the possibility that a
person may feel satisfied with life, and yet be utterly depraved, or
without meaningful social relationships, or entirely dependent upon
narcotics. Would we say such persons are flourishing? Something
beyond psychology seems to be in view with flourishing. If some
notion of flourishing is ultimately of interest, then health itself, along
with psychological well-being, and virtue, would all seem to be
central components.

state as complete human well-being, which is again arguably a
broader concept than psychological well-being. Conceptions of
what constitutes flourishing will be numerous and views on the
concept will differ. However, I would argue that, regardless of
the particulars of different understandings, most would concur
that flourishing, however conceived, would, at the very least,
require doing or being well in the following five broad domains
of human life: (i) happiness and life satisfaction; (ii) health, both
mental and physical; (iii) meaning and purpose; (iv) character
and virtue; and (v) close social relationships. All are arguably at
least a part of what we mean by flourishing. Each of these do-
mains arguably also satisfies the following two criteria: (i) Each
domain is generally viewed as an end in itself, and (ii) each
domain is nearly universally desired. I would suggest that these
two criteria—of being ends and being universally desired—may
be useful guides in decisions concerning the domains that
should be included in national surveys and polls to assess
flourishing.

If, however, we think about flourishing not only as a mo-
mentary state but also as something that is sustained over time,
then one might also argue that a state of flourishing should be
such that resources, financial and otherwise, are sufficiently sta-
ble so that what is going well in each of these five domains is
likely to continue into the future for some time to come. Financial
and material stability would generally not be viewed as ends in
themselves but may be important in the preservation of those
goods that are their own ends. For flourishing over time, it might
thus also be good to assess financial and material stability as
well. I would in no way claim that these domains above entirely
characterize flourishing. Someone who is religious for example
would almost certainly include some notion of communion with
God or the transcendent within what is meant by flourishing. I
would only argue here that, whatever else flourishing might
consist in, these five domains above would also be included, and
thus these five domains above may provide some common
ground for discussion.

The measurement of well-being in each of these domains is in
no way straightforward. Each has a large literature devoted to it
(12, 13, 15, 16, 30–33). There will be no perfect measures. How-
ever, to make progress, some summary measure seems better
than none at all
(34). There are of course numerous existing
composite measures of psychological well-being (17–21), and
some might argue that these should be adequate; but, as noted
above, these generally do not capture broader components of
flourishing such as health, and often also do not assess virtue. I
have, in the Appendix: Flourishing Measures, proposed two sum-
mary measures. The first measure includes questions on each of
these five domains described above; the second measure, in ad-
dition to these five domains, also includes questions on having
sufficient stability and financial resources so that flourishing is likely
to continue. The former measure is perhaps conceptually more
satisfactory as a measure of flourishing, at a given point in time, as
each of the domains arguably constitutes its own end. The latter
measure, which includes financial and other resources, may be the
better measure in practice as it will likely indicate flourishing over a
longer stretch of time. For these proposed measures, I have se-
lected two questions in each of these five, or six, domains based
principally on prior measures that have some empirical validation
and are already used with some frequency in the literature (14, 16,
30, 31, 34–36).

Flourishing itself might be understood as a state in which all
aspects of a person’s life are good. We might also refer to such a

There is of course a certain arbitrary element in the selection
of questions and, in some of these domains, such as virtue or

VanderWeele

meaning, considerable work remains to be done on measure
development and validation. An attempt was, however, made to
select these questions on principled grounds. It seemed good,
whenever possible, to make use of questions that are already
being frequently used in surveys, polls, and past research, so as to
facilitate comparison when used for evaluative or research pur-
poses. Often these questions used in prior surveys had been
subject to some degree of prior empirical validation. Thus, the
questions on life satisfaction, positive affect, mental and physical
health, and meaningful activities were selected as those already
used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De-
velopment (16), the United Kingdom (34), US General Survey (35),
the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview (36), and many others. The questions on close social re-
lationships which likewise have been asked regarding prior
research, were taken from the Campaign to End Loneliness
measure (31). Only the items on character and virtue are entirely
newly proposed here, because, although several multiitem mea-
sures of specific virtues have been developed (32), there appears
to be essentially no literature on more global single-item virtue
measures. Any attempt at such assessment is of course only going
to be partially adequate. Of the two character–virtue questions in
Appendix: Flourishing Measures, the first is intended to provide
some assessment of prudence and justice, and the second of
fortitude and temperance. I would propose, with no clear way of
weighting across domains, to simply sum the scores of each.
This too is, of course, not entirely adequate, as, for example,
financial resources may play a more important role at levels
below the poverty line than in higher ranges. I in no way view
this as being the best possible measure, but see it rather as a
proposal that might be used until something more satisfactory
emerges. The measurement of flourishing using the various
domains above could also of course be carried out with
alternative or additional questions.

Undoubtedly, the components will be correlated. Mental health
is known to be correlated with happiness and life satisfaction (8, 9,
15); a life lived in the pursuit of virtue is likely to give rise to a strong
sense of purpose, etc. Nevertheless, the components, although
correlated, are still arguably conceptually distinct. Someone, for
example, may have a strong sense of purpose, but pursue means
that he or she knows to be morally suspect to attain their ends. The
components then do arguably assess distinct aspects of flourishing.
Further empirical work will be necessary to assess the correlations
between the components, and the psychometric properties of the
flourishing measures; and the ultimate utility and coherence of the
proposal will only be possible to judge positively if it also proves
useful empirically in understanding the determinants of flourishing.
Certainly, when feasible, more specific multiitem measures
within each of these domains could also be used in research that
aims to better understand human flourishing (12, 13, 30–33).
Again, single-item measures of constructs like meaning, purpose,
and virtue are certainly not entirely satisfactory, and considerable
work on measurement in these domains still needs to be carried
out. However, the insertion of even single-item measures into
surveys or cohort studies can often be leveraged for tremendous
benefit in subsequent research studies. My primary purpose in this
paper, however, is not principally measurement, but to promote
the use of a broader range of outcomes related to flourishing in
medicine, public health, psychology, and social science research
and to consider what major pathways to flourishing, broadly
conceived, may be. It is to this latter topic that we now turn.

Prominent Pathways to Human Flourishing
The public health impact of an exposure is often assessed as a
function of (i) how common the exposure is, that is to say, its
prevalence, and (ii) the size of its effect. If our focus is to be the
uncovering of important pathways to flourishing, one would thus
want to focus on aspects of human life that have relatively large
effects on each of the five or six domains described above and
that are common. From my reading of the empirical literature on
these topics, and the suggestions and comments of others (37), I
would like to propose here that four major pathways are both
relatively common and have reasonably sizeable effects on each
of the aforementioned domains of flourishing. The four pathways,
which I will subsequently discuss, are family, work, education, and
religious community. In what follows, I will review the empirical
evidence for each concerning their prevalence and their contri-
butions to the various domains of flourishing. The review of the
empirical evidence for how each pathway contributes to each
domain of flourishing will be restricted to longitudinal, experi-
mental, and quasiexperimental data and designs. Cross-sectional
studies will not be considered. Certainly, there are numerous prior
reviews of the correlates of subjective well-being (https://ppc.sas.
upenn.edu/) (8, 9). However, many reviews on this topic do not
clearly differentiate, when summarizing the evidence, between
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and, in many of these
areas, cross-sectional studies constitute the vast majority of the
literature. In evaluating evidence for causality, this is problematic,
because, for many of these pathways and domains, there is likely
to be feedback, with effects in both directions. Cross-sectional
designs then cannot in general provide evidence for causality.
For example, although religious community may protect against
subsequent depression, it is also the case that those who become
depressed are more likely to stop participating in religious com-
munity (38). Likewise, although it may be the case that marriage
makes people happier, it is also the case that happy people are
more likely to marry (39). Without longitudinal data, assessing the
direction of causality is generally not possible. Ideally, for longi-
tudinal studies to provide evidence for causality, control for prior
levels of the outcome under consideration should be made and
changes in the exposures being studied should be examined so as
to obtain more reliable causal inferences (40).

Some of evidence for the effects of each of the four pathways
on the flourishing domains is summarized in Fig. 1. Each arrow on
this graph is accompanied by a series of references. These refer-
ences provide evidence from either longitudinal studies with
good confounding control, or from randomized trials or qua-
siexperimental designs, for the corresponding effects. Relations
among the pathways themselves, and among the flourishing do-
mains themselves, are not here represented. Each of the five or six
domains of flourishing is also likely to have effects on the others.
Understanding these too is an important area of empirical re-
search, and considerable progress has been made in studying
these relationships as well, for example, how positive affect, life
satisfaction, and purpose in life might affect physical health (24–
26). Although considerable progress has been made in under-
standing these relations, much empirical work with longitudinal
designs still needs to be done. Our focus here, however, will be on
the effects of each of the pathways on the various flourishing
domains. However, again, the relations between the pathways
and between flourishing domains themselves, and the relevant
mechanisms governing these relations, will continue to be im-
portant areas of research.

The four pathways that will be considered here—family, work,
education, and religious community—are not intended to be ex-
haustive with respect to major determinants of flourishing. There are
of course other pathways—engagement with the arts, for example—
that may contribute substantially to a person’s life across the
various flourishing domains, but for which regular participation is
perhaps not as widespread. Likewise, other forms of community
involvement, beyond that found in religious institutions, may
positively affect the various flourishing domains, but, in today’s
society at least, such participation likewise does not seem par-
ticularly common (41). The four pathways upon which I will focus
here are common and, as we will see, have powerful effects
across the domains of flourishing. The argument here is not that,
for any individual, all four must be present for flourishing. Nor is
the argument that these four are exhaustive. Rather, it is that
these four pathways are important, and common, and that if
efforts were made to support, improve, and promote participa-
tion in these pathways, the consequences for human flourishing
would be substantial.

Let us begin with family. Although not universal, the vast ma-
jority of children grow up in some type of family context. More-
over, although marriage rates have been declining, marriage
continues to be a very common phenomena with ∼80% of Americans
aged 25 and older, at some point in time, having been married (42)
and thereby having formed a family structure beyond their family of
origin. Participation in family life is thus a very common experience.
The effects of family life, and of marriage, are profound. The vast
majority of studies on marriage and happiness or life satisfaction are

cross-sectional. However, the existing longitudinal studies in-
dicate, like the cross-sectional studies, that marriage is associ-
ated with higher life satisfaction (39, 43) and greater affective
happiness (44). Evidence moreover suggests that marriage is
associated with better mental health, physical health, and lon-
gevity, even controlling for baseline health (45–55). Concerning
character and virtue, although understudied and current out-
come measures are inadequate, there is longitudinal evidence
that marriage is associated with higher level of personal growth
(44), and with a reduction in crime for those at high risk (56). It is
also associated with higher levels of meaning and purpose in life
(44). Marriage is moreover associated longitudinally with higher
levels of positive relationships with others, higher levels of per-
ceived social support, and lower levels of loneliness (44, 57).
Marriage likewise tends to be associated with better financial
outcomes, even controlling for baseline financial status and
education (45).

Conversely, divorce is associated longitudinally with
poorer mental and physical health outcomes, even controlling
for baseline health (44, 49, 51, 52, 55, 58–60), lower levels of
happiness and life satisfaction (44, 61), lower levels of meaning
and purpose in life (44), lower levels of positive relations with
others (44), poorer relationships between children and par-
ents (62), and greater levels of poverty for both children and
mothers (45).

Marriage also has profound effects on the lives of children.
Children within, rather than outside of, marriage are more likely to
have better mental and physical health, to be happier in childhood

and later in life, are less likely to engage in delinquent and criminal
behaviors, are more likely to have better relationships with their
parents, and are themselves less likely to later divorce (45, 47, 57,
63–65).

The effects of marriage on health, happiness and life satis-
faction, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social
relationships, and financial stability are thus profound. Divorce,
in contrast, has adverse effects on all of these outcomes. Al-
though there may be instances in which tensions between
married partners seem irreconcilable, the evidence on marriage
and divorce suggests that, if interventions were perhaps avail-
able earlier in the relationship, when problems first began to
develop, the consequences for the flourishing of both the
spouses and their children could be substantial. We will return to
this point below. Marriage and family thus appear to be an im-
portant pathway to flourishing.

We will now consider work and employment as pathways to
flourishing. Approximately 81% of the US civilian noninstitutionalized
population aged 25–54 is employed, including about 88% of men
and 73% of women (66). Relatively high proportions, for both gen-
ders, thus have some form of employment; moreover, the effects of
employment on a number of outcomes are fairly pronounced.
Metaanalyses suggest that those who are employed have higher
levels of life satisfaction and of family or marital satisfaction, and
better mental and physical health (67, 68). Longitudinal studies also
indicate that reemployment of the unemployed results in im-
provement in life satisfaction, and in self-reported physical health
and mental health, and further indicates that loss of a job results in
reductions in mental health and in life satisfaction (67–71). In-
terventions to provide employment have been found, in ran-
domized trials, to have effects on quality of life, better mental
health, and fewer hospitalizations, even among those with se-
vere mental health problems at baseline (72, 73). There is some
evidence that past work and education experiences explain
some of the variation in purpose in life (74), but rigorous lon-
gitudinal studies are still needed. The relationship between
employment and crime is complex and likely bidirectional, be-
cause those with criminal records have more difficulty obtaining
employment, but there is some, albeit not conclusive, evidence
that vocational training programs reduce crime (75, 76). With
regard to social relationships, longitudinal studies, and even a
randomized trial of a vocational training program, suggest that
employment increases the likelihood of marriage (77). Longi-
tudinal studies likewise suggest that unemployment renders
divorce more likely for most groups (78). Employment is of
course a source of income and financial stability.

Let us turn now to education. Some form of education is of
course a near-universal phenomenon, but the extent varies con-
siderably across people and populations. There is reasonably
good evidence that higher levels of education are longitudinally
associated with higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction
(79–81). Although cross-sectional analyses that control for many
covariates at once sometimes suggest no association, or even a
negative association (80), such analyses typically control for in-
come, employment, and marital status, which may be the pri-
mary pathways. Longitudinal analyses that take this temporal
ordering into account suggest an effect of education on higher
happiness and life satisfaction through these pathways (79, 80).
Education is a strong cross-sectional predictor of health (82, 83),
but the extent to which this is causal is debated. Although some
longitudinal and quasiexperimental designs do indicate a pro-
tective effect (83–86), other strong designs suggest that this

effect may be more modest than may have been previously
thought, or may not apply to all contexts (83, 87, 88), with
possibly a larger effect in the United States than in Europe (83).
Concerning virtue and character, there is some evidence from
longitudinal studies that education decreases the likelihood
of criminal activity and increases the likelihood of voting and
of democratic participation (83, 89, 90). There is some evi-
dence that past education and work experiences explain some
of the variation in purpose in life (74), but rigorous longitudinal
studies are still needed. Higher levels of education are associ-
ated with subsequently higher levels of club membership, par-
interaction (91). Concerning marriage,
ticipation, and social
there is some evidence that education may delay the timing of
first marriage (92, 93) but increases the overall likelihood of
marriage (80, 94, 95), and decreases the likelihood of sub-
sequent divorce (96). Education can of course strongly affect
subsequent income (97–99).

We will conclude our consideration of the four pathways with
religious community. Approximately 84% of the world’s population
report a religious affiliation (100). Within the United States, 89%
believe in God or a universal spirit, 78% consider religion a very
important or fairly important part of life, 79% identify with a par-
ticular religious group, and 36% report having attended a religious
service in the last week (101). Not only is participation substantial,
but there is now fairly good evidence that participation in religious
community is longitudinally associated with the various domains of
flourishing. There is a large literature suggesting that attending
religious services is associated with better health (102–104). Al-
though much of the literature is methodologically weak, there
are now numerous well-designed longitudinal studies that sug-
gest that regular religious service attendance is associated with
greater longevity (105–110), a 30% lower incidence of de-
pression (38, 107, 111), a fivefold lower rate of suicide (112),
better survival from cancer, and numerous other outcomes (102,
104). Importantly, the evidence suggests that it is attending re-
ligious services, rather than private practices or self-assessed
spirituality or religiosity, that is most strongly predictive of
health (106, 113). It is the communal form of religious practice
that appears to bring about better health outcomes. Numerous
studies have also demonstrated an association between at-
tending services and happiness and life satisfaction; almost all of
these are cross-sectional, but the existing longitudinal evidence offers
confirmation of this and suggests that it may be causal (114).
There is likewise some evidence from longitudinal studies that
service attendance is associated with greater meaning in life (115).
With the relationship between religion and virtue, once again,
many of the studies use cross-sectional designs. However, there
have been a number of randomized priming experiments sug-
gesting at least short-term effects of religious prompts on pro-
social behavior (116). There is longitudinal evidence that those
who attend services are subsequently more generous and more
civically engaged (117). There is also some experimental evi-
dence that encouragement to prayer increases forgiveness,
gratitude, and trust (118–120). Finally, concerning close rela-
tionships, there is evidence from longitudinal studies that at-
tending religious services decreases the likelihood of divorce
(107, 121, 122), increases the likelihood of subsequently making
new friends, and of marrying, and increases social support (107,
114, 123). The effect of religious community, and specifically re-
ligious service attendance, on these various aspects of flourishing,
is thus substantial.

On the Promotion of Human Flourishing
If it is the case that the family, work, education, and religious com-
munity are important determinants of various aspects of human
flourishing, as indeed they seem to be, then this has profound
implications for societal organization and resource allocation. If
we desire societal good, broadly construed as human flourish-
ing, and crudely represented by the measures described above,
then the structures, policies, laws, and incentives, financial or
otherwise, that contribute to family, work, education, and re-
ligious community will likely be important ways in which society
itself can better flourish.

Policies can be put into place to support marriage; current
marriage penalties for the poor embedded within the welfare
system should be eliminated (6, 7); resources could be expanded
to assist and support those with marital conflict. Randomized trials
of certain online marriage support programs have been shown to
have important effects on relationship confidence and satisfac-
tion, and on individual functioning and mental health (2), and
the potential for outreach of these is considerable. Concerning
employment, welfare policy could be structured so as to not dis-
incentivize work. Supportive employment programs could be
established for vulnerable populations. Such supportive employ-
ment interventions have been found, in randomized trials, to have
effects on competitive employment, health, and quality of life,
even for mentally ill and homeless populations (3, 4, 72, 73). Ed-
ucation that ensures both adequate school resources and de-
voted competent teachers, for all students, would of course both
contribute toward employment and income (5), as well as also
further promote the various domains of flourishing. With respect
to religious community as a pathway, society could continue to
preserve and promote the tax-exempt status of these organiza-
tions so as to facilitate their important contributions. The regular
media portrayals of various negative aspects of religion can
and should be balanced with the numerous ways, documented
in which religious community and service attendance
above,
promotes health, well-being, and human flourishing. Further dis-
cussion of these issues could be included within public health and
health care.

With respect to research, if empirical studies are to better
promote human flourishing, several implications would seem to
follow. First, broad human flourishing outcome measures, rather
than just specific disease outcomes, should be the focus of more
empirical research studies, and should be incorporated into more
designs so as to better understand the causes and determinants
of, and interventions to promote, human flourishing. Moreover,
outcomes such as meaning and purpose or character and virtue
should not simply be viewed as being justified because of their
relations with physical health, but also as ends in themselves.
Second, it would be good to examine multiple outcomes simul-
taneously rather than the common practice of only examining
single individual outcomes (10). That is not to say that specific
outcomes and individual diseases ought to be neglected, but
simply that the balance should shift. Third, research resources,
both human and financial, would perhaps be better allocated to
allow for more of a balance across broader human flourishing
outcomes measures, versus more narrow, but still
important,
specific disease outcomes. A shift along these lines would have
important implications for government funding agencies, student
dissertation choices, and departmental hiring and promotion
decisions. These institutional decisions concerning resource allo-
cation and hiring have profound effects on the content of research
and could be better balanced so that more research on broader

aspects of human flourishing takes place. Fourth, it is unfortunate
that with topics as important as these, so much of the existing
research continues to be with cross-sectional data, which, as
noted above, severely compromise our ability to reason about
causality or to assess determinants.
Incorporation of broader
flourishing measures into existing longitudinal cohort studies
could help address this, as would greater research funding for
these topics. Finally, governments could begin to collect data on
broader outcome measures and to track and measure prog-
ress not only on gross domestic product but on various other
measures of well-being and flourishing (8), including meaning
and purpose, and perhaps even character and virtue. Self-
reported measures of character and virtue of course have their
weaknesses, but there is some evidence that they do bear some
relation to other, potentially more objective measures of character
(124). Some progress in this regard has already been made.
Bhutan rather famously put forward the idea of a Gross National
Happiness Index. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development now collects data on measures such as of life satis-
faction, health, individual financial security, and meaningful and
purposeful activity for each of the participant nations (16). Recently,
the United Kingdom began collecting such data on several of these
measures in their annual population survey (34). The incorporation
of such measures into government surveys can both alter discourse
about policy priorities, and also prove useful in research. As noted
above, although not entirely adequate, the insertion of even single-
item measures of the flourishing domains into surveys could be
leveraged for important research purposes.

The focus of this essay has been on individual pathways to
personal flourishing, that is, on decisions or actions an individual
might take to flourish. However, a well-functioning government
and society, with sufficient material resources, is of course also cru-
cial in sustaining the pathways described above that promote
individual flourishing. An efficient and effective government, a well-
functioning financial system, the absence of corruption, and civic
stability are all important in supporting families, work, education,
and religious communities in the promotion of individual flourish-
ing; and the study of how more macro- and state-level factors in-
fluence individual flourishing is needed as well. However, the
relevant effects here are arguably in both directions. The state of
government and the policies it undertakes will influence individual
flourishing. However, individual health, relationships, life satisfac-
tion, purpose, and, perhaps especially, virtue will likely also con-
tribute to the strengthening of the institutions that allow a society to
thrive. A deeper consideration of, focus on, and understanding of
outcomes such as purpose, and virtue, moving beyond measures of
only income or health, may contribute not only to a broader and
more profound individual flourishing, but also to a better func-
tioning society as well.

Appendix: Flourishing Measures
The “Flourish” measure is obtained by summing the scores from
each of the first five domains. The “Secure Flourish” measure is
obtained by summing the scores from all six domains including
the financial and material stability domain. Each of the questions is
assessed on a scale of 0–10.

Domain 1: Happiness and Life Satisfaction.

Overall, how satisfied are you with life as a whole these days?

0 = Not Satisfied at All, 10 = Completely Satisfied

VanderWeele

PNAS | August 1, 2017 | vol. 114 | no. 31 | 8153

In general, how happy or unhappy do you usually feel?

0 = Not True of Me, 10 = Completely True of Me

0 = Extremely Unhappy, 10 = Extremely Happy

Domain 2: Mental and Physical Health.

In general, how would you rate your physical health?

0 = Poor, 10 = Excellent

How would you rate your overall mental health?

0 = Poor, 10 = Excellent

Domain 3: Meaning and Purpose.

Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life
are worthwhile?

0 = Not at All Worthwhile, 10 = Completely Worthwhile

I understand my purpose in life.

0 = Strongly Disagree, 10 = Strongly Agree

I am always able to give up some happiness now for greater
happiness later.

0 = Not True of Me, 10 = Completely True of Me

Domain 5: Close Social Relationships.

I am content with my friendships and relationships.

0 = Strongly Disagree, 10 = Strongly Agree

My relationships are as satisfying as I would want them
to be.

0 = Strongly Disagree, 10 = Strongly Agree

Domain 6: Financial and Material Stability.

How often do you worry about being able to meet normal
monthly living expenses?

0 = Worry All of the Time, 10 = Do Not Ever Worry

Domain 4: Character and Virtue.

I always act to promote good in all circumstances, even
in difficult and challenging situations.

How often do you worry about safety, food, or housing?

0 = Worry All of the Time, 10 = Do Not Ever Worry
