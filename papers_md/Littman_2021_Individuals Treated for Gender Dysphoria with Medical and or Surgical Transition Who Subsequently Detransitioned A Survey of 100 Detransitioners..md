Abstract
The study’s purpose was to describe a population of individuals who experienced gender dysphoria, chose to undergo medi-
cal and/or surgical transition and then detransitioned by discontinuing medications, having surgery to reverse the effects of 
transition, or both. Recruitment information with a link to an anonymous survey was shared on social media, professional 
listservs, and via snowball sampling. Sixty-nine percent of the 100 participants were natal female and 31.0% were natal male. 
Reasons for detransitioning were varied and included: experiencing discrimination (23.0%); becoming more comfortable 
identifying as their natal sex (60.0%); having concerns about potential medical complications from transitioning (49.0%); and 
coming to the view that their gender dysphoria was caused by something specific such as trauma, abuse, or a mental health 
condition (38.0%). Homophobia or difficulty accepting themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual was expressed by 23.0% as a 
reason for transition and subsequent detransition. The majority (55.0%) felt that they did not receive an adequate evaluation 
from a doctor or mental health professional before starting transition and only 24.0% of respondents informed their clini-
cians that they had detransitioned. There are many different reasons and experiences leading to detransition. More research is 
needed to understand this population, determine the prevalence of detransition as an outcome of transition, meet the medical 
and psychological needs of this population, and better inform the process of evaluation and counseling prior to transition.

Introduction

Detransition is the act of stopping or reversing a gender tran-
sition. The visibility of individuals who have detransitioned 
is new and may be rapidly growing. As recently as 2014, it 
was challenging for an individual who detransitioned to find 
another person who similarly detransitioned (Callahan, 2018). 
Between 2015 and 2017, a handful of blogs written by indi-
vidual detransitioners started to appear online, private support 
groups for detransitioners formed, and interviews with detran-
sitioners began to appear in news articles, magazines, and

blogs (Anonymous, 2017; 4thwavenow, 2016; Herzog, 2017; 
McCann, 2017). Although few YouTube videos about detran-
sition existed prior to 2016, multiple detransitioners started 
to post videos documenting their experiences in 2016 and the 
numbers of these videos continues to increase.1 In late 2017, 
the subreddit r/detrans (r/detrans, 2020) was revitalized and in 
four years has grown from 100 members to more than 21,000 
members. A member poll of r/detrans conducted in 2019 esti-
mated that approximately one-third of the members responding 
to the survey were desisters or detransitioners (r/detrans, 2019). 
The Pique Resilience Project, a group of four detransitioned 
or desisted young women, was founded in 2018 as a way to 
share the experiences of detransitioners with the public (Pique 
Resilience Project, 2019). In late 2019, the Detransition Advo-
cacy Network, a nonprofit organization to “improve the well-
being of detransitioned people everywhere” was launched (The

Detransition Advocacy Network, 2020) and the first formal, in-
person conference for detransitioned people was held (Bridge, 
2020). In the face of this massive change, clinicians have called 
for more research into the experiences of detransitioners (Butler 
& Hutchinson, 2020; Entwistle, 2021; Marchiano, 2020).

Although there were rare published reports about detran-
sitioners prior to 2016, most of the published literature about 
detransition is recent (Callahan, 2018; D’Angelo, 2018; Djordje-
vic et al., 2016; Kuiper & Cohen-Kettenis, 1998; Levine, 2018; 
Marchiano, 2017; Pazos Guerra et al., 2020; Stella, 2016; Tur-
ban & Keuroghlian, 2018; Turban et al., 2021; Vandenbussche, 
2021). The prevailing cultural narratives about detransition are 
that most individuals who detransition will retransition and that 
the reasons for detransition are discrimination, pressures from 
others, and nonbinary identification (Turban et al., 2021). How-
ever, case reports are shedding light on a broader and more 
complex range of experiences that include trauma, worsened 
mental health with transition, re-identification with natal sex, 
and difficulty separating sexual orientation from gender identity 
(D’Angelo, 2018; Levine, 2018; Pazos Guerra et al., 2020).2 
Detransitioners and desisters, in their own words, have provided 
additional depth to the discussion, describing that:

(1)  Trauma (including sexual trauma) and mental health con-
ditions contributed to their transgender identification and 
transition (Callahan, 2018; Herzog, 2017; twitter.com/
ftmdetransed & twitter.com/radfemjourney, 2019)
(2)  Their dysphoria and transition were due to homopho-
bia and difficulty accepting themselves as homosexual 
(Bridge, 2020; Callahan, 2018; upperhandMARS, 2020)
(3)  Peers, social media, and online communities were influ-
ential in the development of transgender identification 
and desire to transition (Pique Resilience Project, 2019; 
Tracey, 2020; upperhandMARS, 2020)

(4)  Their dysphoria was rooted in misogyny (Herzog, 2017)

Two recently published convenience sample reports provide 
additional context about the topic of detransition. First, Turban 

2  The debate about the terminologies used to describe an individual’s 
sex  (including  “assigned  sex  at  birth,”  “biological  sex,”  “natal  sex,” 
“birth sex,” “sex,” etc.) is far from settled. Although some profession-
als have argued for the use of “assigned sex at birth,” others argue that 
this terminology is misleading and not consistent with the events that 
occur at birth and prior to birth (Bouman et al., 2017; Byng et al., 2018; 
Dahlen, 2020; Griffin et al., 2020). Supporting the unsettled nature of 
the discussion, I received conflicting comments from the reviewers of 
this  manuscript  about  my  selection  of  natal  sex  terms–one  reviewer 
asked that I justify my preference for natal sex over the other termi-
nologies; another reviewer expressed support for my use of natal sex. I 
prefer to use “natal sex” and “birth sex” because they are accurate and 
objective. Further, I propose that “natal sex” and “birth sex” might be 
seen as reasonable, polite compromise terms between “biological sex” 
and “assigned sex at birth.”

et al. (2021) analyzed data from the United States Trans Survey 
(USTS) (James et al., 2016). The USTS contains data from 
27,715 transgender and gender diverse adults from the U.S. 
who were recruited through lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer (LGBTQ), and allied organization outreach. The USTS 
included the question, “Have you ever detransitioned? In other 
words, have you ever gone back to living as your sex assigned 
at birth, at least for a while?” with the multiple choice options 
of “yes,” “no,” and “I have never transitioned.” For the 2,242 
participants who answered “yes,” Turban et al. analyzed the 
responses to the multiple choice question, “Why did you de-
transition? In other words, why did you go back to living as 
your sex assigned at birth? (Mark all that apply).” Although 
most of the offered answer options were about external pres-
sures to detransition (pressure from spouse or partner, pressure 
from family, pressure from friends, pressure from employer, 
discrimination, etc.), participants could write in additional rea-
sons that were not listed. Turban et al.’s sample included more 
natal males (55.1%) than natal females (44.9%). Roughly half 
(50.2%) had taken cross-sex hormones and 16.5% had obtained 
surgery. The findings revealed that most (82.5%) of the sample 
expressed at least one external factor for detransitioning and 
15.9% expressed at least one internal factor (factors originat-
ing from self).

The second study by Vandenbussche (2021) recruited 
detransitioners from online communities of detransitioners and 
analyzed data for the participants who answered affirmatively 
to the question, “Did you transition medically and/or socially 
and then stopped?” The sample of 237 participants was pre-
dominantly natal female (92%), and from the U.S. (51%) and 
Europe (32%). Most (65%) had transitioned both medically and 
socially. Participants selected from multiple choice options to 
indicate why they detransitioned with options covering a range 
of experiences. Respondents also had the option to write in 
additional reasons. Frequently endorsed reasons for detransition 
included realizing that their gender dysphoria was related to 
other issues (70%); health concerns (62%); observing that tran-
sition did not help their dysphoria (50%); and that they found 
alternatives to deal with their dysphoria (45%). In contrast to 
Turban et al. (2021), external factors such as lack of support, 
financial concerns, and discrimination were less common (13%, 
12%, and 10%, respectively). Many in the sample described that 
when they detransitioned they lost support or were ostracized 
from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communi-
ties, suggesting that many of the participants in Vandenbussche 
(2021) would not have been reached by the recruitment efforts 
of the USTS (James et al., 2016).

The objective of the current study was to describe a popula-
tion of individuals who experienced gender dysphoria, chose 
to undergo medical and/or surgical transition and then detransi-
tioned by discontinuing medications, having surgery to reverse 
the effects of transition, or both. In contrast to Turban et al. 
(2021) and Vandenbussche (2021), this study focused only on

individuals who transitioned and detransitioned medically, sur-
gically, or both. For the purpose of this study, medical transition 
refers to the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or 
anti-androgens and surgical transition refers to any of a variety 
of surgical procedures (common surgical procedures include 
mastectomy, genital surgery, and breast augmentation). This 
study does not describe the population of individuals who 
undergo medical or surgical transition without issue nor is it 
designed to assess the prevalence of detransition as an outcome 
of transition. Instead, the goal was to identify detransition rea-
sons and narratives in order to inform clinical care and future 
research.

Method

Participants and Procedure

During the recruitment period, 101 individuals who met the 
study criteria completed online surveys. Inclusion criteria were 
(1) completion of a survey via Survey Monkey; (2) answer-
ing that they had taken or had one or more of the following 
for the purpose of gender transition: cross-sex hormones, anti-
androgens, puberty blockers, breast surgery, genital surgery, 
other surgery; and (3) answering that they had done any of the 
following for the purpose of detransitioning: stopped taking 
cross-sex hormones, stopped taking anti-androgens, stopped 
taking puberty blockers, had any surgery to reverse transition. 
One survey was excluded for nonsense answers leaving 100 
surveys for analysis. The sample included more natal females 
(69.0%) than natal males (31.0%) with respondents who were 
predominantly White (90.0%), non-Hispanic (98.0%), resided 
in the U.S. (66.0%); had no religious affiliation (63.0%), and 
support the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry legally 
(92.9%) (see Table 1). At the time of survey completion, the 
mean age of respondents was 29.2 years (SD = 9.1) though natal 
females were significantly younger (M = 25.8; SD = 5.0) than 
natal males (M = 36.7; SD = 11.4), t(98) = − 6.56, p < .001. 
Prior to transitioning, natal females were more likely to report 
an exclusively homosexual sexual orientation and natal males 
were more likely to report an exclusively heterosexual sexual 
orientation.

A 115-question survey instrument with multiple choice, 
Likert-type, and open-ended questions was created by the 
author and two individuals who had personally detransitioned. 
The author had met both detransitioners by way of introduc-
tions from colleagues. The author and both individuals who 
had detransitioned created questions for the survey, provided 
feedback, and revised the survey questions collaboratively 
with a focus on content, clarity, and relevance to a variety of 
transition and detransition experiences. The survey instrument 
included two questions that were adapted from an online survey 
of female detransitioners (Stella, 2016). Once completed, the 

survey was uploaded onto Survey Monkey (SurveyMonkey, 
Palo Alto, CA) via an account that was HIPAA-enabled.

Recruitment information with a link to the survey was posted 
on blogs that covered detransition topics and shared in a pri-
vate online detransition forum, in a closed detransition Face-
book group, and on Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit. Recruitment 
information was also shared on the professional listservs for 
the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, 
the American Psychological Association Section 44, and the 
SEXNET listserv (which is a listserv of sex researchers and 
clinicians) and the professionals on the listservs were asked 
to share recruitment information with anyone they knew who 
might be eligible. Efforts were made to reach out to communi-
ties with varied views about the use of medical and surgical 
transition and recruitment information stated that participation 
was sought from individuals regardless of whether their transi-
tion experiences were positive, negative or neutral. Potential 
participants were invited to share recruitment information with 
any potentially eligible person or community with potentially 
eligible people. The survey was active from December 15, 2016 
to April 30, 2017 (4.5 months). The median time to complete a 
survey was 49 min; 50% of the surveys were completed between 
32 and 71 min. There were no incentives offered for participat-
ing. Data were collected anonymously, without IP addresses, 
and stored securely with Survey Monkey.

Participation in this study was voluntary. Electronic con-
sent was obtained from all participants in the following man-
ner. The first page of the online survey informed respondents 
about the research purpose, potential risks and benefits, that 
participation was voluntary, and provided contact information 
for the researcher. Survey questions were only displayed if the 
participant clicked “agree” which indicated that they read the 
information, voluntarily agreed to participate and were at least 
18 years of age.

Measures

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

Information was collected about participant age, natal sex, race/
ethnicity, country of residence, educational attainment, socio-
economic status, religion, attitudes about legal marriage for 
gay and lesbian couples, and where they first heard about the 
study. The term sexual orientation in this article is intended to 
refer to the natal sex of the participant and the natal sex of the 
individuals with whom they are sexually attracted. Participants 
were asked to select one or more labels for how they identified 
their sexual orientation prior to transition with options inclu-
sive of participant sex (e.g., asexual female, bisexual female, 
heterosexual female, etc.). These responses were coded to be 
consistent with participant natal sex and were categorized into 
homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, and 
multiple. The multiple category included respondents who

selected more than one response where responses indicated 
more than one pattern of sexual attraction (e.g., lesbian female 
and heterosexual female). Other questions about baseline 
characteristics included questions about diagnosed psychi-
atric disorders and neurodevelopmental disabilities, trauma, 
and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) before the onset of gender 
dysphoria.

Gender Dysphoria Onset and Typologies

Participants were asked how old they were when they first expe-
rienced gender dysphoria and whether this was during child-
hood, at the onset of puberty, during puberty, or later. Respond-
ents were categorized as having early-onset gender dysphoria if 
they indicated that their gender dysphoria began “during child-
hood” and late-onset gender dysphoria if their gender dysphoria 
began “at the onset of puberty” or later. To evaluate typologies, 
participants were characterized by Blanchard’s (1985, 1989) 
typology as homosexual (if the sexual orientations listed prior 
to transition were exclusively homosexual) or non-homosexual 
which includes heterosexual, asexual, bisexual, pansexual, and 
multiple responses.

Transition

Participants were asked for their age and the year that they 
first sought care to transition, sources that encouraged them to 
believe that transition would be helpful to them, and whether 
they felt pressured to transition. The friendship group dynamics 
that were identified in previous work were assessed by asking 
respondents whether their friendship group mocked people 
who were not transgender, whether people in their pre-existing 
friend group transitioned before the participant decided to tran-
sition, and how participant popularity changed after announc-
ing that they would transition (Littman, 2018). Questions were 
asked about participant experiences with clinicians, the social, 
medical, and surgical steps they took to transition, and the dura-
tion of time spent taking each medication.

Detransition

Participants were asked for their age and the year that they 
decided to detransition, how long they were transitioned 
before deciding to detransition, their reasons for wanting to 
detransition, what sources encouraged them to believe that 
detransition would be helpful to them, and whether they felt 
pressured to detransition. Participants were also asked which 

social, medical, and surgical steps they took to detransition and 
whether they contacted the doctor or clinic that they used for 
their transition to tell them that they detransitioned.

Transition and Detransition Narratives

In this article, “narratives” denote participant interpretations of 
their experiences and rationales surrounding their decisions to 
transition and detransition. To associate each participant sur-
vey with a set of relevant narratives, the data were reviewed 
with horizontal (beginning to end) passes and vertical passes 
for selected questions (these questions are listed in the sup-
plemental materials). Surveys were coded as belonging to zero 
or more of the following narrative categories: discrimination, 
nonbinary, retransition, trauma and mental health, internalized 
homophobia, social influence, and misogyny. Each narrative 
and the responses that were associated with them are detailed 
below. Example quotes were selected with care taken to avoid 
quoting a participant more than once per narrative. Narratives 
are ordered and reported with the more commonly accepted 
narratives first and the newer narratives next.

The discrimination narrative was defined as when some-
one detransitioned due to experiencing discrimination or 
external social pressures. The nonbinary narrative consisted 
of answering that their current identification was “nonbinary/
genderqueer” or providing open-text responses that described 
aspects of discovering or maintaining a nonbinary identifica-
tion. Although there were no questions in the survey specifi-
cally asking about retransition, the retransition narrative was 
identified if participants expressed that they had retransitioned 
or resumed transition in any of the open-text responses in the 
survey. The gender dysphoria was caused by trauma or a men-
tal health condition narrative was identified by selection for the 
answers, “what I thought were feelings of being transgender 
were actually the result of trauma,” “what I thought were feel-
ings of being transgender were actually the result of a mental 
health condition,” “I discovered that my gender dysphoria was 
caused by something specific (ex. trauma, abuse, mental health 
condition)” or open-text responses consistent with these rea-
sons. The internalized homophobia/difficulty accepting oneself 
as a lesbian female, gay male, or bisexual person narrative 
consisted of descriptions that the respondents’ discomfort and 
distress about being lesbian, gay, or bisexual was related to 
their gender dysphoria, transition, or detransition, or that they 
assumed they were transgender because they did not yet under-
stand themselves to be lesbian, gay or bisexual. The social pres-
sure to transition narrative was identified with an affirmative 

1 33358

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2021) 50:3353–3369

answer to whether they felt pressured to transition with an open-
text response indicating that the pressure came from a person 
or group of people. The misogyny narrative was identified for 
natal female respondents with open-text responses using the 
word “misogyny” or expressing a hatred of femaleness.

Gender Identification at Start of Transition and at Survey 
Completion

Participants were asked how they identified their gender when 
they started their transition and at the time of survey comple-
tion. They were given options of female, male, nonbinary/
genderqueer, trans man/FTM, trans woman/MTF, none of 
the above, and other. Responses were coded by natal sex and 
categorized as transgender, birth sex, nonbinary, and other. 
Answers that were combinations of the above categories were 
reported as combinations such as “birth sex and nonbinary.”

Self‑Appraisal of Transition and Detransition

One question asked if participants believe they were helped and 
another if they were harmed by their transition with options 
of “very much,” “a little,” or “not at all.” These results were 
categorized into exclusively helped, exclusively harmed, and 
both helped and harmed. Participants were asked which of 
the following reflected their feelings about their transition: “I 
am glad that I transitioned,” “I wish I had never transitioned,” 
“Transitioning distracted me from what I should have been 
doing,” “Transition was a necessary part of my journey.” Par-
ticipants were asked to rate their regret about their transition 
(“no regrets,” “mild regrets,” “strong regrets,” and “very strong 
regrets”) and were asked to indicate their satisfaction with their 
decisions to transition and detransition (“extremely satisfied,” 
“very satisfied,” “somewhat satisfied,” “somewhat dissatisfied,” 
“very dissatisfied,” and “extremely dissatisfied”). Satisfaction 
options were collapsed into “satisfied” and “dissatisfied.” In 
addition, participants were asked if they knew then what they 
know now, would they have chosen to transition.

Data Analysis

After data were cleaned, statistical analyses were performed 
using google sheets. Results are presented as frequencies, 
percentages, medians, means and standard deviations. t tests 
and chi-square tests were performed for selected variables and 
were considered significant for p < .05. Qualitative data were 
obtained from the open-text answers to questions that allowed 
participants to provide additional information. Selected open-
text responses were categorized, tallied, and reported numeri-
cally. Salient respondent quotes and summaries from the quali-
tative data were selected to illustrate the quantitative results and 
to provide relevant examples.

Results

Before Transition

Mental health diagnoses and traumatic experiences before the 
onset of gender dysphoria. Table 2 shows data about psychiatric 
disorders, neurodevelopmental disabilities, NSSI, and trauma 
that were reported as occurring prior to the onset of gender 
dysphoria. Because these conditions and events occurred before 
participants began to feel gender dysphoric, they cannot be con-
sidered to be secondary to gender incongruence or transphobia.
Gender dysphoria onset and typology. Most participants 
(82.0%) were living with one or both parents when they first 
experienced gender dysphoria at a mean age of 11.2 years 
(SD = 5.6). The mean age of gender dysphoria onset was 
not statistically different between natal females (M = 11.3; 
SD = 5.4) and natal males (M = 11.0; SD = 5.9), t(96) = 0.25. 
By Blanchard typologies, 26.1% of natal females were exclu-
sively homosexual and 73.9% non-homosexual while 6.5% 
of natal males were exclusively homosexual and 93.5% non-
homosexual (Blanchard, 1985, 1989). Slightly more than half 
of the respondents (56.0%) experienced early-onset gender 
dysphoria and slightly less than half (44.0%) experienced late-
onset gender dysphoria. Although late-onset gender dysphoria 
in natal females was largely absent from the scientific literature 
prior to 2012 (Steensma et al., 2013; Zucker & Bradley, 1995; 
Zucker et al., 2012a), 55.1% of the natal female participants 
reported that their gender dysphoria began with puberty or later. 
Because the information about the timing of gender dysphoria 
onset was obtained from participants reporting on their own 
experiences, it can be assumed that these cases were indeed 
late-onset rather than early-onset gender dysphoria that was 
concealed from parents and other people.

Transition reasons. Table 3 shows data about the reasons 
that individuals wanted to transition and the most frequently 
endorsed were: wanting to be perceived as the target gender 
(77.0%); believing that transitioning was their only option to 
feel better (71.0%); the sensation that their body felt wrong the 
way it was (71.0%), and not wanting to be associated with their 
natal sex (70.0%). Most participants believed that transition-
ing would eliminate (65.0%) or decrease (63.0%) their gender 
dysphoria and that with transitioning they would become their 
true selves (64.0%).

Sources of transition encouragement and friend group 
dynamics. Participants identified sources that encouraged them 
to believe transitioning would help them. Social media and 
online communities were the most frequently reported, includ-
ing YouTube transition videos (48.0%), blogs (46.0%), Tumblr 
(45.0%), and online communities (43.0%) (see supplemental 
materials). Also common were people who the respondents 
knew offline such as therapists (37.0%); someone (28.0%) or a 
group of friends (27.0%) that they knew in-person. A subset of

participants experienced the friendship group dynamics identi-
fied in previous work, including belonging to a friendship group 
that mocked people who were not transgender (22.2%), having 
one or more friend from the pre-existing friend group transi-
tion before the participant decided to transition (36.4%), and 
experiencing an increase in popularity after announcing plans 
to transition (19.6%) (Littman, 2018). Most did not have this 
experience (68.7%, 61.6%, and 62.9%, respectively).

Pressure to transition. More than a third of the participants 
(37.4%) felt pressured to transition. Natal sex differences in 
feeling pressured to transition were significant by chi-square 
test with natal females > natal males χ2(1, 99) = 4.22, p = .04. 
Twenty-eight participants provided open-text responses of 
which 24 described sources of pressure (17 described social 
pressures and 7 described sources that were not associated with 
other people). Clinicians, partners, friends, and society were 
named as sources that applied pressure to transition, as seen in 
the following quotes: “My gender therapist acted like it [tran-
sition] was a panacea for everything;” “[My] [d]octor pushed 
drugs and surgery at every visit;” “I was dating a trans woman 
and she framed our relationship in a way that was contingent on 
my being trans;” “A couple of later trans friends kept insisting 
that I needed to stop delaying things;” “[My] best friend told me 
repeatedly that it [transition] was best for me;” “The forums and 
communities and internet friends;” “By the whole of society 
telling me I was wrong as a lesbian;” and “Everyone says that 
if you feel like a different gender…then you just are that gender 
and you should transition.” Participants also felt pressure to 
transition that did not involve other people as illustrated by the 
following: “I felt pressured by my inability to function with 
dysphoria” and “Not by people. By my life circumstances.”

Experiences with clinicians. When participants first sought 
care for their gender dysphoria or desire to transition, more than 
half of the participants (53.0%) saw a psychiatrist or psycholo-
gist; about a third saw a primary care doctor (34.0%) or a coun-
selor (including licensed clinician social worker, licensed pro-
fessional counselor, or marriage and family therapist) (32.0%); 
and 17.0% saw an endocrinologist. For transition, 45.0% of 
participants went to a gender clinic (44.4% of those attending a 
gender clinic specified that the gender clinic used the informed 
consent model of care); 28.0% went to a private doctor’s office; 
26.0% went to a group practice; and 13.0% went to a mental 
health clinic (see supplemental materials).

The majority (56.7%) of participants felt that the evalua-
tion they received by a doctor or mental health professional 
prior to transition was not adequate and 65.3% reported that 
their clinicians did not evaluate whether their desire to transi-
tion was secondary to trauma or a mental health condition. 
Although 27.0% believed that the counseling and information 
they received prior to transition was accurate about benefits 
and risks, nearly half reported that the counseling was overly 
positive about the benefits of transition (46.0%) and not nega-
tive enough about the risks (26.0%). In contrast, only a small 

minority found the counseling not positive enough about ben-
efits (5.0%) or too negative about risks (6.0%) suggesting a bias 
toward encouraging transition.

Transition

Participants were on average 21.9 years old (SD = 6.1) when 
they sought medical care to transition with natal females seek-
ing care at younger ages (M = 20.0; SD = 4.2) than natal males 
(M = 26.0; SD = 7.5), t(97) = − 5.07, p < .001. Given that the 
majority of natal males were categorized as Blanchard typology 
non-homosexual, the finding that natal males sought medical 
care to transition at older ages than natal females is concord-
ant with previous research (Blanchard et al., 1987). The aver-
age year for seeking care was more recent for natal females 
(M = 2011; SD = 3.8) than natal males (M = 2007; SD = 6.9), 
t(96) = 2.78, p = .007, and thus, there may have been differ-
ences in the care they received due to differences in the culture 
surrounding transition and the prevailing medical approaches 
to gender dysphoria for the time.

At the start of transitioning, nearly all (98.0%) of the par-
ticipants identified as either transgender (80.0%), nonbinary 
(15.0%), or both transgender and nonbinary (3.0%). Partici-
pants identified which social, medical, and surgical steps they 
had taken to transition. Table 4 shows these steps, separated by 
natal sex where appropriate. Most respondents adopted new 
pronouns (91.0%) and names (88.0%), and the vast major-
ity (97.1%) of natal females wore a binder. Most participants 
took cross-sex hormones (96.0%) and most natal males took 
anti-androgens (87.1%). The most frequent transition surgery 
was breast or chest surgery for natal females (33.3%). Genital 
surgery was less common (1.4% of natal females and 16.1% 
of natal males). Natal females took testosterone for a mean 
duration of 2.0 years (SD = 1.6). Natal males took estrogen for 
a mean duration of 5.1 years (SD = 5.9) and anti-androgens 
for 2.8 years (SD = 2.6). The minority of patients who took 
puberty blockers took them for a mean duration of less than a 
year (M = 0.9 years; SD = 0.6).

Detransition

Before deciding to detransition, participants remained transi-
tioned for a mean duration of 3.9 years (SD = 4.1) with natal 
females remaining transitioned for a shorter period of time 
(M = 3.2 years; SD = 2.7) than natal males (M = 5.4 years; 
SD = 6.1), t(96) = − 2.40, p = .018. When participants decided 
to detransition they were a mean age of 26.4 years old (SD = 7.4) 
though natal females were significantly younger (M = 23.6; 
SD = 4.5) than natal males (M = 32.7; SD = 8.8), t(97) = − 6.75, 
p < .001. The mean calendar year when participants decided to 
detransition was 2014 (M = 2014; SD = 3.3), but the difference

between natal females and natal males was not significant 
(M = 2014, SD = 3.3; M = 2014, SD = 3.5), t(95) = 0.52.

Respondents detransitioned for a variety of reasons and most 
(87.0%) selected more than one reason. The most frequently 
endorsed reason for detransitioning was that the respond-
ent’s personal definition of male and female changed and they 
became comfortable identifying with their natal sex (60.0%) 
(see Table 5). Other commonly endorsed reasons were concerns 
about potential medical complications (49.0%); transition did 
not improve their mental health (42.0%); dissatisfaction with 
the physical results of transition (40.0%); and discovering that 
something specific like trauma or a mental health condition 
caused their gender dysphoria (38.0%). External pressures 
to detransition such as experiencing discrimination (23.0%) 
or worrying about paying for treatments (17.0%) were less 
common.

Encouragement and pressure to detransition. Participants 
were asked to select sources that encouraged them to believe 
that detransitioning would help them. These included blogs 
(37.0%), Tumblr (35.0%), and YouTube detransition videos 
(23.0%) (see supplemental materials). At some point in their 
process, 23.2% felt pressured to detransition. There was no sig-
nificant difference between natal females and natal males for 
feeling pressured to detransition, χ2(1, 99) = 1.11. Of the 21 
open-text responses provided, 14 respondents expressed social 
pressure to detransition; three expressed internal pressure to 
detransition and four provided responses that were neither

or unclear. Regarding social pressure to detransition, seven 
participants expressed that the pressure came from partners, 
parents, or other family members as shown in the following 
example quotes: “I was threatened that if I did not immediately 
detransition I would NEVER see my […] children again,” “My 
father very much wanted me to desist,” and “Parents constantly 
encouraging me to detransition.” Five participants expressed 
societal pressure to detransition as expressed in the following 
quotes: “I did not pass, I was mocked in public, I could not get 
a job. It was not ok to be trans” and “Well, I mean basically the 
entire world was against me transitioning, so yeah.” One par-
ticipant felt pressured by doctors and another one from a blog.
Detransition steps. Table 6 shows data about the social, med-
ical, and surgical steps participants took to detransition. Nearly 
all participants medically detransitioned by ceasing cross-sex 
hormones (95.0%). Social detransition steps were also common 
and included returning to the use of previously used pronouns 
(63.0%) and birth names (33.0%) and changing one’s clothes 
and hair presentations (48.0%). Surgical detransition steps were 
less common (9.0%).

Finding better ways of coping with gender dysphoria. Partic-
ipants were asked to select responses that that they considered 
to have been better ways for them to cope with their gender dys-
phoria. Responses included community (44.0%), mindfulness/
meditation (41.0%), exercise (39.0%), therapy (24.0%), trauma 
work (24.0%), medication to treat a mental health condition 
(18.0%), and yoga (14.0%).

Transition and Detransition Narratives

Several transition and detransition narratives emerged from the 
data. A sizable minority of participants (41.0%) expressed more 
than one narrative in their responses.

The discrimination and external pressures to detransition 
narrative was described by 29.0% of participants. Examples 
include: “I had to detransition in order to get a job”; “I was 
afraid of being homeless and unable to support myself”; “I felt 
much happier with myself but I couldn’t go anywhere without 
being afraid. I passed okay but not perfectly. I was stared down 
and sneered at in the women’s clothes section, I wouldn’t dare 
use a public toilet because I’d find either violent men or women 
who wished an encounter with a violent man on me.”

A nonbinary narrative was expressed by 16.0% of partici-
pants. Some described that they discovered their nonbinary 
gender identity during their transition, as in the following 
quotes: “I still was uncomfortable with my body and figured I 
should stop and make sure I really wanted to keep going. I didn’t 
and I decided I must be nonbinary, not FTM”; “Transitioning 
didn’t do what I thought I wanted it to. I had transitioned to the 
wrong gender. I still felt wrong. Then, I realized I was not male, 
but genderqueer. I detransitioned to suit my true identity.” And 
others described a consistent nonbinary identification, as in the 
following quote, “I identified the same way that I did before.

I had gotten what I wanted out of HRT and was ready to stop 
taking it.” (Cross-sex hormones are sometimes referred to as 
“hormone replacement therapy” and abbreviated as HRT).

Three participants (3.0%) expressed the retransition nar-
rative in open-text answers indicating that they had retransi-
tioned, including the following quotes: “I am now transitioning 
for a second time”; I retransitioned after 5 years of detransi-
tioning”; and “Anyway, I retransitioned over 10 years after 
detransitioning.”

Most participants (58.0%) expressed the gender dysphoria 
was caused by trauma or a mental health condition narrative 
which included endorsing the response options indicating that 
their gender dysphoria was caused by something specific, such 
as a trauma or a mental health condition. More than half of 
the participants (51.2%) responded that they believe that the 
process of transitioning delayed or prevented them from deal-
ing with or being treated for trauma or a mental health condi-
tion. The following are example quotes that were in response 
to why participants chose to detransition: “I slowly began 
addressing the mental health conditions and traumatic experi-
ences that caused such a severe disconnect between myself and 
my body…”; “I was starting to become critical of transition 
because I felt that many people were doing it out of self-hatred 
and started to realize that applied to me as well”; “I was deeply 
uncomfortable with my secondary sex characteristics, which I 
now understand was a result of childhood trauma and associat-
ing my secondary sex characteristics with those events.”

Despite the absence of any questions about this topic in the 
survey, nearly a quarter (23.0%) of the participants expressed 
the internalized homophobia and difficulty accepting oneself 
as lesbian, gay, or bisexual narrative by spontaneously describ-
ing that these experiences were instrumental to their gender 
dysphoria, their desire to transition, and their detransition. All

of the participants in this category indicated that they were 
either same-sex attracted exclusively or were same-sex attracted 
in combination with opposite-sex attraction (such as bisexual, 
pansexual, etc.). The following responses were written in as 
“other” for the question about why participants transitioned: 
“Transitioning to male would mean my attraction to girls would 
be ‘normal’”; “being a ‘gay trans man’ (female dating other 
females) felt better than being a lesbian, less shameful”; “I felt 
being the opposite gender would make my repressed same-sex 
attraction less scary”; “I didn’t want to be a gay man.” Some par-
ticipants described that it took time for them to gain an under-
standing of themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual as seen in 
the following: “At the time I was trying to figure out my identity 
and felt very male and thought I was transgender. I later discov-
ered that I was a lesbian…”; and “Well, after deep discovery, I 
realized I was a gay man and realized that a sexual trauma after 
puberty might [have] confused my thought. I wanted to live as 
a gay man again.” Several natal female respondents expressed 
that seeing other butch lesbians would have been helpful to 
them as shown by the following: “What would have helped me 
is being able to access women’s community, specifically lesbian 
community. I needed access to diverse female role-models and 
mentors, especially other butch women.”

The social influence narrative was identified where par-
ticipants added information to the question about if they had 
felt pressured to transition and the response described pres-
sure from a person or people. One-fifth (20.0%) of participants 
expressed that they felt pressured by a person or people to tran-
sition. Example quotes for social influence were described in 
a previous section.

Of the natal females, 7.2% expressed the misogyny narra-
tive. Example quotes include: “…I realized how much of it 
[dysphoria] may have been caused by internalized misogyny 
and homophobia”; “Finally realizing there’s nothing wrong or 
disgusting or weak about being female”; and “My transition 
was a desperate attempt to distance myself from womanhood 
and femaleness due to internalized lesbophobia and misogyny 
combined with a history of sexual trauma.”

After Detransition

Disposition. At the time of survey completion, most par-
ticipants had returned to identifying solely as their birth sex 
(61.0%) with an additional 10.0% identifying as their birth sex 
plus another identification. Fourteen percent of the participants 
identified solely as nonbinary with an additional 11.0% iden-
tifying as nonbinary plus a second identification. Eight per-
cent of the participants identified solely as transgender with 
an additional 5.0% identifying as transgender plus another 
identification. Four percent of the responses did not fit into the 
above categories and were coded as “other.” Figure 1 illustrates 
the distribution of participants’ current gender identification 
(post-detransition). Only 24.0% of participants had informed 

Fig. 1   Distribution of participants’ current gender identification (after 
detransition)  (n = 100).  Notes:  The  sum  of  the  numbers  appearing 
in  the  “Birth  Sex”  circle  indicates  the  number  of  participants  who 
returned  to  identifying  with  their  birth  sex  (71)—either  as  birth  sex 
alone (61) or birth sex in addition to a second identification (10) rep-
resented  in  the  overlap  between  two  circles.  For  example,  eight  par-
ticipants identify as their birth sex and as nonbinary. The sum of the 
numbers  appearing  in  the  “Nonbinary”  circle  indicates  the  number 
of  participants  who  identify  as  nonbinary  (25)—either  as  nonbinary 
alone  (14)  or  nonbinary  in  addition  to  a  second  identification  (11). 
The sum of the numbers appearing in the “Transgender” circle indi-
cates  the  number  of  participants  who  identify  as  transgender  (13)—
either as transgender alone (8) or transgender in addition to a second 
identification (5). Four participants had responses that did not fit the 
categories above and were coded as “other”

the doctor or clinic that facilitated their transitions that they 
had detransitioned.

Self-appraisal of past transgender identification. Table 7 pre-
sents the data for responses endorsed by participants to reflect 
how they feel currently about having identified as transgender 
in the past. The statements most frequently selected included: 
“I thought gender dysphoria was the best explanation for what I 
was feeling” (57.0%), “My gender dysphoria was similar to the 
gender dysphoria of those who remain transitioned” (42.0%), 
“What I thought were feelings of being transgender actually 
were the result of trauma” (36.0%), “What I thought were feel-
ings of being transgender actually were the result of a mental 
health condition” (36.0%).

Self-appraisal of transition and detransition. When asked to 
select which statement best reflects their feelings about their 
transition, nearly a third (30.0%) indicated that they wish they 
had never transitioned while 11.0% indicated they were glad 
they transitioned. Some (34.0%) selected the statement that 
transition “was a necessary part of [their] journey” but others 
(21.0%) indicated that the process of transitioning distracted 
them from what they should have been doing. Responses about

harmed and 17.2% indicated that they were only helped. The

Discussion

This study was designed to explore the experiences of individu-
als who obtained medical and surgical treatment for gender 
dysphoria and then detransitioned by discontinuing the medica-
tions or having surgery to reverse the changes from transition. 
The findings of this study, however, should not be assumed to be 
representative of all individuals who detransition. Although this 
study further documents that detransitioners exist, the preva-
lence of detransition as an outcome of transition is unknown. 
Only a small percentage of detransitioners (24.0%) informed 
the clinicians and clinics that facilitated their transitions that 
they had detransitioned. Therefore, clinic rates of detransition 
are likely to be underestimated and gender transition special-
ists may be unaware of how many of their own patients have 
detransitioned, particularly for patients who are no longer under 
their care.

This research demonstrates that the experiences of individu-
als who detransition are varied and the reasons for detransition 
are complex. Nearly all participants identified as transgender or 
nonbinary at the start of their transition and most sought transi-
tion because they did not want to be associated with their natal 

sex, their bodies felt wrong the way they were, and they believed 
that transition was the only option to relieve their distress. Some 
were helped by transition and only detransitioned because they 
were pressured to do so by people in their lives, society, or 
because they had medical complications. Some were harmed 
by transition and detransitioned because they concluded that 
their gender dysphoria was caused by trauma, a mental health 
condition, internalized homophobia, or misogyny—conditions 
that are not likely to be resolved with transition. These findings 
highlight the complexity of gender dysphoria and suggest that, 
in some cases, failure to explore co-morbidities and the context 
in which the gender dysphoria emerged can lead to misdiag-
nosis, missed diagnoses, and inappropriate gender transition. 
Some individuals detransitioned because their gender dyspho-
ria resolved, because they found better ways to address their 
symptoms, or because their personal definitions of male and 
female changed and they became comfortable identifying as 
their natal sex.

The study sample was predominantly young natal females, 
many of whom experienced late-onset gender dysphoria which 
mirrors the recent, striking changes in the demographics of gen-
der dysphoric youth seeking care as well as the youth described 
by their parents in Littman (2018) (see also Aitken et al., 2015; 
de Graaf et al., 2018; Zucker, 2019). Concerns have been raised 
that this new cohort of gender dysphoric individuals is unlike 
previous cohorts. Professionals have started to call for caution 
before treating this cohort with interventions with permanent 
effects because the etiologies, desistance and persistence rates,

expected duration of symptoms, and whether this new popula-
tion is helped or harmed by gender transition is still unknown 
(D’Angelo et al., 2021; Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2018). The natal 
females and natal males in this sample differed on several 
dimensions, including that natal females were younger than 
natal males when they sought transition, when they decided 
to detransition, and at the time of survey completion. Natal 
females were more likely than natal males to have experienced 
a trauma less than one year before the onset of their gender dys-
phoria and were more likely to have felt pressured to transition. 
Compared to natal males, natal females remained transitioned 
for a shorter duration of time before deciding to detransition. 
Additionally, natal females transitioned more recently than 
natal males, so their experiences may vary due to changing 
trends in the clinical management of gender dysphoria and the 
cultural settings in which they became gender dysphoric.

The study findings covered a wide range of detransition 
experiences that are consistent with the diversity of experiences 
described in previously published clinical case reports and case 
series. Overlap of findings include: transition regret; absence 
of transition regret; re-identification with birth sex; continued 
identification as transgender; improvement or worsening of 
well-being with transition; retransitioning; detransitioning 
due to external social pressures; nonbinary identification; and 
recognizing and accepting oneself as homosexual or bisexual 
(D’Angelo, 2018; Djordjevic et al., 2016; Levine, 2018; Pazos 
Guerra et al., 2020; Turban & Keuroghlian, 2018; Turban et al., 
2021; Vandenbussche, 2021). The population in this study is 
similar to the population in Vandenbussche in that both were 
predominantly natal females in their mid-20s. Because the cur-
rent study recruited in 2016–2017 and Vandenbussche recruited 
in 2019, the similar mean age of participants may reflect the 
age of individuals who can be reached in online detransitioner 
communities. Several findings in this study were consistent 
with Vandenbussche’s findings, including similar reasons for 
detransition (realizing that their gender dysphoria was related 
to other issues, finding alternatives to address gender dyspho-
ria, gender dysphoria resolved, etc.). Although these two stud-
ies were recruited in different years, had different eligibility 
criteria, and included participants from several countries, it is 
possible that there may be some overlap of study populations.
The current study findings provide additional insight into the 
complex relationships between internalized homophobia, gen-
der dysphoria, and desire to transition. Contrary to arguments 
against the potential role of homophobia in gender transitions 
(Ashley, 2020), participants reported that their own gender dys-
phoria and desire to transition stemmed from the discomfort 
they felt about being same-sex attracted, their desire to not be 
gay, and the difficulties that they had accepting themselves as 
lesbian, gay or bisexual. For these individuals, exploring their 
distress and discomfort around sexual orientation issues may 
have been more helpful to them than medical and surgical tran-
sition or at least an important part of exploration before making 

the decision to transition. This research adds to the existing 
evidence that gender dysphoria can be temporary (Ristori & 
Steensma, 2016; Singh et al., 2021; Zucker, 2018). It has been 
established that the most likely outcome for prepubertal youth 
with gender dysphoria is to develop into lesbian, gay, bisexual 
(LGB) (non-transgender) adults (Ristori & Steensma, 2016; 
Singh et al., 2021; Wallien & Cohen-Kettenis, 2008; Zucker, 
2018). And, temporary gender dysphoria may be a common 
part of LGB identity development (Korte et al., 2008; Patterson, 
2018). Therefore, intervening too soon to medicalize gender 
dysphoric youth risks iatrogenically derailing the develop-
ment of youth who would otherwise grow up to be LGB non-
transgender adults. Participants who detransitioned because 
they became comfortable identifying as their natal sex and 
because their gender dysphoria resolved further support that 
gender dysphoria is not always permanent.

The data in this study strengthen, with first-hand accounts, 
the rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) hypotheses which, 
briefly stated, are that psychosocial factors (such as trauma, 
mental health conditions, maladaptive coping mechanisms, 
internalized homophobia, and social influence) can cause or 
contribute to the development of gender dysphoria in some indi-
viduals (Littman, 2018). Littman also postulated that certain 
beliefs could be spread by peer contagion, including the belief 
that a wide range of symptoms should be interpreted as gender 
dysphoria (and proof of being transgender) and the belief that 
transition is the only solution to relieve distress. The current 
study supports the potential role of psychosocial factors in the 
development of gender dysphoria and further suggests, by par-
ticipant responses that transitioning prevented or delayed them 
from addressing their underlying conditions, that maladaptive 
coping mechanisms may be relevant for some individuals. The 
potential role of social influence is demonstrated as well. First, 
when respondents were asked to describe how they currently 
feel about having identified as transgender in the past, more than 
a third endorsed the option, “Someone told me that the feelings 
I was having meant that I was transgender, and I believed them.” 
Second, a subset of participants experienced the unique friend-
ship group dynamics reported in Littman where peer groups 
mocked people who were not transgender and popularity within 
the friend group increased when respondents announced their 
plan to transition. Additionally, respondents identified several 
social sources that encouraged them to believe that transitioning 
would help them including: YouTube transition videos, blogs, 
Tumblr, and online communities. And finally, 20.0% of partici-
pants felt pressured to transition by social sources that included 
friends, partners, and society. More research is needed to further 
explore these hypotheses.

The current study and the Turban et al. (2021) analysis of the 
USTS data share some similarities and differences. Similarities 
include the use of convenience samples, targeted recruitment, 
and anonymous data collection. The findings of Turban et al. 
(including external pressures to detransition and transgender 

1 33366

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2021) 50:3353–3369

identification after detransition) are a subset of the array of 
experiences described in the current study. The current study 
differed from James et al. (2016) and Turban et al. in that it 
enrolled participants based on the criterion of detransition 
after medical or surgical transition regardless of how they 
currently identified, recruited from communities with diverse 
perspectives about transition and detransition, used a precise 
definition for detransition that specifies the use of medication 
or surgery, and included answer options that were relevant to 
many different types of detransition experiences. In contrast, 
the USTS only enrolled transgender-identifying individuals 
regardless of whether they medically or surgically transitioned, 
recruited from communities likely to have similar perspectives 
about transition and detransition, and provided multiple choice 
answer options that were relevant to a narrower range of detran-
sition experiences (James et al., 2016). Further, the definition 
used by the USTS for “detransitioned” (having “gone back to 
living as [their] sex assigned as birth, at least for a while”) is 
quite vague. Although Turban et al. provide valuable informa-
tion about the subset of transgender-identifying people who 
may have detransitioned, the current study provides a more 
comprehensive view of individuals who detransition after 
medical or surgical transition.

Over the past 15 years, there have been substantial changes 
in the clinical approach to gender dysphoric patients notable 
for a shift from approaches that employ thorough evaluations 
and judicious use of medical and surgical transition (the watch-
ful waiting or Dutch approach, the developmentally informed 
approach, and the medical model of care) to approaches with 
minimized or eliminated evaluation and liberal use of transi-
tion interventions (the affirmative approach and the informed 
consent model of care) (Cavanaugh et al., 2016; de Vries & 
Cohen-Kettenis, 2012; Meyer et al., 2002; Rafferty et al., 2018; 
Schulz, 2018; Zucker et al., 2012b). This trend is prominent in 
the U.S. where the American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed 
the affirmative approach in 2018 and Planned Parenthood cur-
rently uses the informed consent model to provide medical tran-
sition in more than 200 clinics in 35 states (Planned Parenthood, 
2021; Rafferty et al., 2018). It is plausible that an unintended 
consequence of these clinical shifts may be an increase in peo-
ple who detransition. Many participants in this study believe 
that they did not receive an adequate evaluation by a clinician 
before transition. The definition of “adequate evaluation” was 
not provided in the survey and may be open to respondent inter-
pretation. But given the complexities of the gender dysphoria 
described in the current study, one might consider a low bar 
of “adequate” to be the exploration of factors that could be 
misinterpreted as non-temporary gender dysphoria as well as 
factors that could be underlying causes for gender dysphoria. 
The most recently emerging approach to gender dysphoria is 
called the “exploratory approach” which is a neutral psycho-
therapeutic approach to help individuals gain a deeper under-
standing of their gender distress and the factors contributing to 

their dysphoria (Churcher Clarke & Spiliadis, 2019; Spiliadis, 
2019). The study’s findings suggest that an exploratory type of 
approach may have been beneficial to some of the respondents. 
Future research is needed to determine which patients are best 
treated by which approaches long term.

Patients considering medical and surgical interventions 
deserve accurate information about the risks, benefits, and 
alternatives to that treatment. In this sample, nearly half of the 
participants reported that the counseling they received about 
transition was overly positive about the benefits of transition 
and more than a quarter reported that the counseling was not 
negative enough about the risks. Several participants felt pres-
sured to transition by their doctors and therapists. If these types 
of clinical interactions are verified, exploration is needed to 
determine the extent to which this situation occurs and what 
measures might be taken to ensure that clinicians provide 
patients with their options accurately and dispassionately.

There are several obstacles to obtaining accurate rates of 
detransition and desistance, including stigma and the low num-
bers of detransitioners who inform their clinicians that they 
detransitioned. One approach to bypass some of these barri-
ers would be to incorporate non-judgmental questions about 
detransition and desistance into nationally representative sur-
veys that collect health data. For example, the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System contains an optional module about 
sexual orientation and gender identity that includes two ques-
tions to explore gender issues (Downing & Przedworski, 2018). 
By changing one existing question, “Do you consider yourself 
to be transgender?” into two questions, “Have you ever, at any 
point in your life, considered yourself to be transgender?” and 
“Do you currently consider yourself to be transgender?” and 
by adding a follow-up question if answers indicate past but not 
current transgender identification, “Did you ever take puberty 
blockers, cross-sex hormones, anti-androgens, or have any sur-
gery as part of your transition?”, valuable information about 
desistance, detransition, and current transgender identifica-
tion could be obtained. These types of questions may also be 
of use in clinical practice and electronic medical records. The 
information gained about rates of detransition and desistance 
would enhance transgender healthcare by aiding informed con-
sent processes at the start of any medical or surgical transition.
One of the strengths of this study is that it is one of the larg-
est samples of detransitioners to date. Other strengths include 
the use of a precise definition for detransition, enrollment of 
detransitioners regardless of their post-detransition gender iden-
tification, recruitment from communities with likely divergent 
views about transition and detransition, and collaboration with 
two individuals who had detransitioned which helped to cre-
ate a survey instrument with questions relevant to a variety of 
detransition experiences and enhanced the recruitment efforts.
There are several limitations to this study that should be 
considered when interpreting the findings. Like Vandenbussche 
(2021), James et al. (2016), and Turban et al. (2021), this study 

1 3

3367

used a cross-sectional design, anonymous surveying, and a con-
venience sample and therefore shares the same limitations that 
are inherent to these methodologies. These limitations include 
that conclusions about causation cannot be determined, iden-
tities of participants cannot be verified, and the findings of 
this study may not be generalizable to the entire population of 
people who detransition or to people outside of the countries 
where participants were from. Although this study reached out 
to communities with differing perspectives about transition 
and detransition, targeted recruitment and convenience sam-
ples always introduce the limitations associated with selection 
biases which should be addressed in future research. Finally, 
many of the participants in this study had less than ideal out-
comes to their medical and surgical transitions, and it is possible 
that these experiences may have colored some of the responses.
Additional research is needed to determine the prevalence of 
detransition as an outcome of transition and to identify and meet 
the psychological and medical needs of the emerging detran-
sitioned population. Because many individuals who detransi-
tion re-identify with their birth sex, are no longer connected to 
LGBT communities, and don’t return to gender clinics, future 
research about detransition needs to expand recruitment efforts 
beyond gender clinics and transgender communities. The devel-
opment and testing of non-medical interventions for gender 
dysphoria could provide valuable options to be used as alterna-
tives or in conjunction with medical and surgical treatments. 
Because of the potential for some to experience trauma, men-
tal health conditions, internalized homophobia, and misogyny 
as gender dysphoria, research needs to be conducted on the 
evaluation process before transition to find approaches that 
respectfully and collaboratively explore factors that might 
contribute to gender-related distress. There continues to be 
an absence of long-term outcomes evidence for youth treated 
with medical and surgical transition and a lack of information 
about the trajectories of youth experiencing late-onset gender 
dysphoria–research is needed to address these gaps. Continued 
work is needed to reduce rigid gender roles, increase repre-
sentation of gender stereotype nonconformity, and to address 
discrimination and social pressures exerted against people who 
are transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and gender stereotype 
non-conforming.

Conclusion

This study described individuals who, after transitioning with 
medications or surgery, have detransitioned. The prevalence of 
detransitioning after transition is unknown but is likely under-
estimated because most of the participants did not inform the 
doctors who facilitated their transitions that they had detransi-
tioned. There is no single narrative to explain the experiences 
of all individuals who detransition and we should take care to 
avoid painting this population with a broad brush. Some detran-
sitioners return to identifying with their birth sex, some assume 

(or maintain) a nonbinary identification, and some continue 
to identify as transgender. Some detransitioners regret transi-
tioning and some do not. Some of the detransitioners reported 
experiences that support the ROGD hypotheses, including that 
their gender dysphoria began during or after puberty and that 
mental health issues, trauma, peers, social media, online com-
munities, and difficulty accepting themselves as lesbian, gay, 
or bisexual were related to their gender dysphoria and desire to 
transition. Natal female and natal male detransitioners appear 
to have differences in their baseline characteristics and experi-
ences and these differences should be further delineated. Future 
research about gender dysphoria and the outcomes of transition 
should consider the diversity of experiences and trajectories. 
More research is needed to determine how best to provide sup-
port and treatment for the long-term medical and psychologi-
cal well-being of individuals who detransition. Findings about 
detransition should be used to improve our understanding of 
gender dysphoria and to better inform the processes of evalua-
tion, counseling, and informed consent for individuals who are 
contemplating transition.
