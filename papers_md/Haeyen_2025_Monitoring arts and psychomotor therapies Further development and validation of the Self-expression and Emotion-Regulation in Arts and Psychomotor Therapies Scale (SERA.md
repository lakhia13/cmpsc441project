pose of this study was to examine the extended reliability and sensitivity to change of 

the adapted version of the above scale, now called the Self-expression and Emotion 

Regulation in Arts and Psychomotor Therapies Scale (SERAPTS) for art, dance, 

drama, music and psychomotor therapy.

Methods

A pre-post design study was conducted on adult patients diagnosed with emotion 

regulation problems or personality disorder(s) cluster B/C. The study’s sample size 

was determined by the researchers to be 96 participants for the purpose of testing 

internal consistency, and 67 participants for the purpose of testing sensitivity for 

change.

Results

An excellent internal consistency was found for all domains of therapy combined 
(Cronbach’s α = 0.95). Additionally, high to excellent internal consistencies were iden-
tified for dance (α = 0.88), drama (α = 0.89), music (α = 0.95), and psychomotor ther-
apy (α = 0.95), when considered separately. Furthermore, a significant sensitivity for 
change was identified within a 3-month timeframe (t = −4.39, p < .001), accompanied 
by a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.54).

Discussion

The validity of the tool has been established in previous research. The present 

study sought to establish the applicability and reliability/sensitivity to change of the 

SERAPTS, with a view to extending it to the broad spectrum of all creative arts 

and psychomotor therapies. The SERAPTS was shown to be a valid and sensitive 

instrument for monitoring the effects of creative arts and psychomotor therapies, 

indicating healthy self-expression and emotion regulation skills that serve positive 

self-regulation.

Introduction

Creative arts and psychomotor therapies are frequently utilised in the treatment 
of individuals experiencing mental and psychosomatic problems, underpinned by 
a systematic utilisation of experiential approaches [1,2]. These therapies encom-
pass visual art therapy, dance therapy, drama therapy, music therapy, psychomotor 
 therapy and play therapy. These forms of therapy are particularly prevalent in the 
treatment of individuals experiencing emotion regulation difficulties or personality 
disorders [3]. The experiential approach of arts and psychomotor therapies, incor-
porating music, dance, drama and art, along with attention to body awareness and 
movement, facilitates the creation of a space for the triggering, exploration and expe-
rience of emotions, inner conflicts, the practise of new behaviours, self-reflection and 
self-insight [4].

The significance and meaningfulness of these forms of arts and psychomotor 
therapies is recognised by both patients and therapists, despite the paucity of stud-
ies indicating their effectiveness [1,4–6]. The scientific evidence for the effective-
ness of these therapies in individuals experiencing emotion regulation difficulties or 
personality disorders is primarily derived from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
[7,8] and two pilot RCTs [9,10]. Arts and psychomotor therapies can be considered 
for purposes of coming into emotional contact with difficult aspects of patients and 
their experiences, to work on goals such as regulation of emotions, stress, identity/
self- image, self-expression, mood/anxiety, relaxation, changing patterns and social 
functioning [1]. In addition, there are several other relevant indications in studies that 
arts and psychomotor therapies are effective in the treatment of emotion regulation 
problems and personality disorders (e.g., [11–16]). The relevance of these studies is 
evidenced by the fact that a significant proportion of the study group had been diag-
nosed with emotion regulation problems or personality disorders.

Notwithstanding these indications, robust scientific evidence regarding the util-
isation of arts and psychomotor therapies remains highly sought after [1]. In con-
ducting research, a specific outcome measure is required. As a result, an instrument 
designed to measure specific aspects of arts and psychomotor therapies is needed. It 
is important to note that a single instrument that can be utilised across all these forms 
of therapy is not currently available. Consequently, the outcomes of therapies that are 
specifically focused on experience must be measured using instruments developed 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336170  November 14, 2025

for psychological, often cognitive forms of therapy. This discrepancy may potentially result in a misalignment between the 
intended and actual outcomes. It is therefore essential to develop a specific outcome measure designed from the princi-
ples of arts and psychomotor therapies, in order that specific outcomes can be reliably monitored.

Creative arts and psychomotor therapies constitute components of a comprehensive clinical treatment programme, 
frequently encompassing a duration of one day. As such, determining the specific and isolated effect of the art therapy 
intervention itself is challenging [17]. Optimal alignment of treatment can be promoted by regularly evaluating treatment 
progress with patients [3]. The monitoring of treatment and the discussion of scores with patients has been shown to have 
a positive impact on the treatment effect [18]. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a substantial increase in 
the use of Routine Outcome Monitoring or measurements (ROM) across a range of therapeutic settings [19,20]. ROM is 
utilised to evaluate treatment outcomes at regular intervals to monitor patients’ progress during treatment and can addi-
tionally be employed for effectiveness research [21,22]. ROM is optimally employed as an integral component of therapy, 
encompassing the decision-making process, treatment progress monitoring, and real-time adjustment when necessary 
[19,23].

In previous research, the Self-expression and Emotion Regulation in Art Therapy Scale (SERATS) was developed and 

validated for solely visual art therapy [5,24]. The development of this instrument was necessitated by the absence of a 
specific measurement instrument to monitor and evaluate art therapy. The SERATS is a tool designed to measure the 
effect of creative arts on the development of healthy self-expressive and emotion regulation skills, which in turn promote 
positive self-regulation. The development of the SERATS involved rigorous psychometric analysis, ensuring its reliability 
and validity as a measurement tool.

The initial round of analyses comprised two independent samples (n = 335; n = 34) of patients diagnosed with person-

ality disorders of the Cluster B/C variety, which yielded a unidimensional 9-item scale. The scale demonstrated a high 
internal consistency (n = 335; Cronbach’s alpha = .94) and high test-retest reliability over a period of 1–3 weeks (n = 75; 
r = .96). Furthermore, the SERATS demonstrated sensitivity in monitoring the individual changes of participants in art 
therapy over a period of 13 weeks (n = 34; t(27)=3.13, p < .004; effect size d = .60) [24]. Nevertheless, it should be noted 
that the observed change, as measured by a pretest-post-test design, could not be exclusively attributed to the art therapy 
sessions. It is important to note that the participants in this particular sample received art therapy as a component of a 
more extensive treatment programme.

In contrast, in a subsequent study (n = 57), the SERATS was used in a randomised controlled trial with an isolated art 

therapy intervention of 10 weeks. A significant change over time was identified (F(1,31)=111.55, p = .00) with a substan-
tial effect size (d = 2.03) [25]. In the study by Haeyen et al. [24], a further analysis examined the correlations between the 
SERATS and other relevant instruments including the AAQ-II (mental flexibility; Acceptance and Action Questionnaire) 
[26], the MAAS [27] and the OQ45 (general mental functioning, i.e.,; Outcome Questionnaire 45) [28], the SMI (presence 
of different maladaptive and adaptive mental modes; Schema Mode Inventory) [29], and the MHC-SF (social-, emotional-, 
and psychological well-being, i.e.,; Mental Health Continuum—short form) [30]. The findings indicated a low correlation 
(r < .4), suggesting that the SERATS exhibited discriminant validity but lacked convergent validity. Overall, the SERATS 
demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in these studies; however, it lacked convergent validity and consequently 
construct validity.

Subsequent research was thus conducted [5] in order to examine the convergent validity of the SERATS correlation 
with the Emotional Expressivity Scale (EES), the Emotion Regulation Strategies for Artistic Creative Activities Scale (ERS-
ACA) and the Healthy-Unhealthy Music Scale (HUMS). The study population comprised 179 individuals diagnosed with a 
personality disorder, characterised by difficulties in self-regulation and emotion regulation, and a population of 53 healthy 
students who completed the relevant questionnaires (N = 232). The findings demonstrated that the SERATS exhibited high 
reliability and convergent validity in relation to the ERS-ACA approach strategies and self-development strategies in both 
populations, and regarding the HUMS healthy scale in the patient population. The SERATS measures have been found 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336170  November 14, 2025

to be strongly related to emotion regulation strategies such as acceptance, reappraisal, discharge and problem solv-
ing, as well as to improving a sense of self, including self-identity, increased self-esteem and improved agency, and the 
healthy side of art making. Participants indicated that the SERATS was relatively easy to complete in comparison to the 
other questionnaires. In conclusion, the SERATS has been shown to be a valid, useful, context-specific and user-friendly 
instrument for monitoring the outcomes of art therapy, which is indicative of making art in a healthy way that serves pos-
itive emotion regulation and self-development. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the SERATS exclusively delineates 
patients’ experiences within the domain of visual arts therapy. Consequently, the scale is presently only utilised within the 
domain of art therapy, with its application in other arts or psychomotor therapies not yet explored.

Following the publication of these results, there was a high demand for the use of the SERATS for monitoring and 
evaluating other creative arts and psychomotor therapies, in addition to art therapy. The present study aims to inves-
tigate the reliability and sensitivity to change of the slightly adapted SERATS for the other forms of creative arts and 
psychomotor therapies for which this scale has been developed and studied. This scale is now referred to as the 
Self-expression and Emotion-Regulation in Arts and Psychomotor Therapies Scale (SERAPTS). The confirmation of 
reliability and sensitivity to change would enable the scale to be used for creative arts and psychomotor therapies in 
general.

Materials and methods

The objective of this study was to examine the internal consistency and sensitivity to change of the SERATS for other 
forms of arts and psychomotor therapy, other than art therapy, which has been studied in previous research. A pre-post 
design study was performed, given that other aspects of the SERATS had previously been examined. The target sample 
size was set at a minimum of 20 participants per therapy form (music, dance, drama, and psychomotor) for the purpose of 
assessing internal consistency, with a further 10 participants per therapy form allocated for the evaluation of sensitivity to 
change.

Participants

The present study included participants diagnosed with emotion regulation problems or personality disorders classified as 
Cluster B or C. Furthermore, they were receiving various creative arts and/or psychomotor therapies (i.e., music, dance, 
drama, psychomotor) as part of a specialised treatment programme. Participants were excluded from the study for the 
following reasons: being under the age of 18 years; being unable to complete the questionnaire (e.g., severe psychiatric 
comorbidity, insufficient knowledge and understanding of the Dutch language); and not having provided informed consent 
to participate in the study. Excluding severe psychiatric comorbidity minimized major medication changes, and medication 
largely reflected standard treatment. Diagnostic criteria were relatively heterogeneous within Cluster B and C personality 
pathology, consistent with routine practice in specialized settings.

Procedures and ethics

The participants were informed about the study by a participating arts/psychomotor therapist, who provided a detailed 
explanation. The participants were provided with comprehensible information and consent forms. Both verbally and in the 
written information, it was emphasised that participation was voluntary, and that withdrawal was possible at any moment 
without any consequence for the receiving treatment. Participants were requested to provide written informed consent 
prior to the administration of the initial measurement, following a period of at least one week. The participants were 
informed that they could contact the researcher or the participating therapist if they had any questions regarding the study. 
The rationale behind this was to ensure the delivery of optimal care, with the results from the measurements being utilised 
for the evaluation of the treatment.

The present study was conducted over the period from March 1st 2023 to August 31th 2024. The processing and 

analysis of the data was conducted in a manner that ensured confidentiality. Furthermore, the consent forms and the data 
were stored in a secure Research Drive environment at HAN University of Applied Sciences. The Ethical Research Com-
mittee of the HAN University of Applied Sciences had previously approved the study (ref. no. ECO 415.12/22). The study 
is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.

Measures

The Self-expression and Emotion Regulation in Arts Therapies Scale (SERATS) [5,7,24] is a reliable, valid and user-
friendly instrument to monitor art therapy. The SERATS measures emotion regulation and self-expression in art therapy. 
The questionnaire contains nine items, with examples including the statements “I am able to depict my feelings in art 
therapy” and “Making art is kind of an outlet for me”. Participants are invited to indicate their level of agreement with each 
statement on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “Never true” to “Nearly always true”. Scores on this scale are interpreted 
as follows: a score of ‘Never true’ indicates poor self-expression and emotion regulation in art therapy, while a score of 
‘Nearly always true’ indicates strong self-expression and emotion regulation in art therapy.

The SERATS is a one-factor instrument with a high internal reliability (α = .94) and a high test-retest reliability (r = .96). 

The SERATS has been shown to be sensitive to measuring therapeutic change over time in the context of art therapy 
[7,24]. The SERATS demonstrates both discriminant and convergent validity [5,7,24]. In addition, the SERATS appears to 
be comparatively uncomplicated in terms of completion by patients and students in comparison to similar questionnaires 
[5]. For the described purposes of this study, the SERATS was modified in that wherever art therapy was mentioned, this 
was replaced by the words: arts and psychomotor therapies. The adapted version is shown in Table 1.

In this study, the initial measurement was conducted at random during the treatment period. Consequently, the sam-
ple comprised a mixture of participants who had recently initiated treatment and those who had been in treatment for a 
considerable duration. It is imperative to note that the inclusion criteria stipulated that participants must have been under-
going treatment for a minimum of three months (rather than at the conclusion of their treatment). The objective of this 
study was not to measure the effect of treatment, but rather to ascertain whether the instrument can measure change over 
time. Participants might have received various forms of art therapy during their treatment but completed the SERAPTS 
per art therapy form separately. The second measurement was taken three months after the first, as recommended by the 
SERATS [5]. The rationale behind this recommendation is that the use of the instrument at more frequent intervals could 
potentially interfere with the therapeutic process, while its less frequent use may be less efficacious. Furthermore, a range 
of participant characteristics were collected, including age, sex, treatment setting and treatment form.

Statistical analyses

Participant characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. Cronbach’s alphas were conducted for the 
SERAPTS of arts and psychomotor therapies separately. The sample size was determined at a minimum of 20 partic-
ipants per therapy form, based on the number of SERAPTS items with an anticipated Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70 and a 
power of 90% [31]. Inter-item reliability of the SERATS was examined in our previous validation study, which demon-
strated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α values reported in Haeyen et al., [5,24]. For this reason, we did not repeat 
this analysis in the present study, which focused on validating the questionnaire for multiple therapy modalities beyond art 
therapy. Paired sample t-tests, with a minimum of 10 participants per therapy form, were used to examine sensitivity to 
change between first and second measurement 3 months later. This test was two-sided, with a p-value of.05 or less being 
considered to indicate statistical significance. Finally, Cohen’s d was computed in order to establish the effect size [32]. 
According to Cohen, effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are classified as small, medium, and large, respectively. All statistical 
analyses were performed using SPSS 27 for Windows [33,34].

Results

The present study comprised a total of 96 participants. Table 2 presents the demographic details of the participants. The 
majority of participants were female and received outpatient group treatment.

Reliability

As illustrated in Table 3, the internal consistency of the complete dataset and each form of therapy is indicated by Cron-
bach’s alpha. A high level of reliability was demonstrated by SERAPTS across all therapy forms, with a Cronbach’s alpha 
of.95 being attained. Additionally, the same high reliability scores of 0.95 were observed for music and psychomotor ther-
apy. Furthermore, high reliability scores of 0.88 and 0.89 were found for dance and drama therapy, respectively.

Sensitivity to change

A total of 67 participants completed both measurements of the SERAPTS. A significant difference was measured between 
both measurements (t = −4.39, p < .001). The analysis revealed an increase in SERAPTS scores within a period of three

months, indicating an enhancement in emotion regulation and self-expression across all therapeutic modalities. For 
detailed information per therapy form, please see Table 4. A notable increase in score was observed across all therapy 
forms. Significant changes were observed within two therapy forms. The objective of these analyses was to ascertain the 
sensitivity of the SERAPTS in measuring therapeutic change over time. The analysis yielded an overall medium effect 
size for this variable (d = 0.54). Higher effect sizes were identified for the two therapy forms that demonstrated significant 
change over time (d = 0.77; d = 0.91). The comparatively lower effect sizes observed in the Dance Therapy and Music 
Therapy groups can be attributed to the too small sample sizes in these groups, clearly below 20 cases, the minimum 
case number to achieve a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05 (34).

Discussion

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity to change of the Self-expression and 
Emotion-Regulation in Arts and Psychomotor Therapies Scale (SERAPTS) in relation to dance, drama, music and psycho-
motor therapy. The results of this study demonstrated analogous findings to those of previous studies and indicated that 
the SERAPTS exhibited high to excellent reliability. Furthermore, a significant medium effect size was observed for the 
sensitivity of change over a three-month period.

A divergence in the significance and effect sizes of the therapy forms was observed. This discrepancy can be attributed 
to the small number of participants within some of the therapy groups consequently not demonstrating significant change 
over time. Overall effect size was above the threshold for moderate, which is given the number of cases quite satisfactory. 
Consequently, the SERAPTS has been determined to be a reliable and sensitive instrument for monitoring the effects of 
art, dance, drama, music, and psychomotor therapy. Previous research has already established the validity of the scale 
[5,24]. Monitoring is especially useful as an effect measurement during treatment and to adjust ongoing treatments if nec-
essary, when the client is not “on track”. To this end, the discussion of the scores with the patient is of paramount impor-
tance. The subsequent discussion is imperative for the effective implementation of the scale.

The provision of feedback regarding routine outcome monitoring scores has some potential to engender adverse 
effects in cases where such feedback is repeatedly received by vulnerable patients suffering from severe psychopathol-
ogy or personality disorder [35]. This is one of the factors that should be taken into account when selecting a monitoring 
instrument. The SERAPTS has been developed to measure positive outcomes in an accessible manner, ensuring ease of 
completion and brevity.

A limitation of the SERAPTS is that the questionnaire is context specific. Consequently, its utilisation is contingent upon 

the participant having undergone one or more sessions (1–3 sessions) of arts and psychomotor therapy sessions. The 
initial measurement is only feasible after at least one session. Conversely, the context-specificity of the SERAPTS is also 
a strength, in that it enables the focus to be directed specifically on this form of therapy within a broader treatment pro-
gramme consisting of several components. This approach aligns well with the prevailing circumstances in clinical practice, 
where arts and psychomotor therapies frequently constitute components of an integrated treatment programme.

It is also important to emphasise that the SERAPTS specifically focuses on self-expression and emotion regulation, 
whereas creative arts and psychomotor therapies consist of more aspects. This focus was deliberately chosen because 
these are important core objectives of creative arts and psychomotor therapies, as for example with clients with per-
sonality disorders. It is acknowledged that other domains of creative arts and psychomotor therapies, such as structur-
ing skills, material handling, experimentation with varied behavioural expressions, and the therapeutic alliance, are not 
encompassed in the present questionnaire. Emotion regulation is not a strictly delimited construct. In line with current 
perspectives of Gross, Neumann and colleagues [e.g., 36, 37], we conceptualize emotion regulation as a multidimen-
sional process, encompassing awareness, acceptance, modulation, and expression of emotions. Within personality 
disorders, dysregulation manifests across this continuum rather than as a discrete, uniform deficit. The SERAPTS aims 
to capture this broader process-based understanding by assessing observable change in emotion awareness, tolerance, 
and expression through artmaking, domains empirically linked to emotion regulation and dysregulation. Thus, the instru-
ment’s operationalization is complementary to, rather than divergent from, clinically recognized mechanisms of emotion 
regulation. Self-expression and emotion regulation are assessed as core domains in the SERAPTS because creative arts 
and psychomotor therapies engage clients in expressive and bodily activities that elicit, modulate, and integrate their self- 
expression and emotional experiences, making changes in emotion regulation a key indicator of therapeutic progression.

At the present time, no norming is available for the SERAPTS. The establishment of such a norm has proven challeng-

ing, primarily due to the context-specific nature of the questionnaire. Consequently, the establishment of a healthy norm 
group, against which to benchmark, is complicated by the absence of a creative arts and psychomotor therapies compo-
nent in such a group. However, future research plans may include norm development or cross-cultural validation. Different 
translations have been established based on international interest in this questionnaire. A norm group would strengthen 
the generalizability of the results. The norm puts individual scores into perspective and makes them interpretable, com-
parable, and clinically or practically useful. In any case, with this study we have shown how the SERAPTS appears to 
improve the measurability of art and psychomotor therapies.

In conclusion, the SERAPTS has been demonstrated to be an internally consistent, reliable, valid and sensitive instru-
ment for monitoring the effect of the broad spectrum of creative arts and psychomotor therapies. The SERAPTS indicates 
healthy self-expression and emotion regulation skills that serve positive self-regulation. It is imperative to acknowledge 
that healthy self-expression and emotion regulation are fundamental basic needs that contribute to mental health and 
well-being. The questionnaire has been developed for the purpose of evaluating progress in creative arts and psychomo-
tor therapy and facilitating research on the effects of these interventions.
