Abstract: For the past 70 years, the dopamine hypothesis has been the key working model in
schizophrenia. This has contributed to the development of numerous inhibitors of dopaminergic
signaling and antipsychotic drugs, which led to rapid symptom resolution but only marginal outcome
improvement. Over the past decades, there has been limited research on the quantifiable pathological
changes in schizophrenia, including premature cellular/neuronal senescence, brain volume loss,
the attenuation of gamma oscillations in electroencephalograms, and the oxidation of lipids in
the plasma and mitochondrial membranes. We surmise that the aberrant activation of the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor by toxins derived from gut microbes or the environment drives premature
cellular and neuronal senescence, a hallmark of schizophrenia. Early brain aging promotes secondary
changes, including the impairment and loss of mitochondria, gray matter depletion, decreased gamma
oscillations, and a compensatory metabolic shift to lactate and lactylation. The aim of this narrative
review is twofold: (1) to summarize what is known about premature cellular/neuronal senescence in
schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders, and (2) to discuss novel strategies for improving long-
term outcomes in severe mental illness with natural senotherapeutics, membrane lipid replacement,
mitochondrial transplantation, microbial phenazines, novel antioxidant phenothiazines, inhibitors of
glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists.

The discovery of chlorpromazine in the 1950s revolutionized psychiatry and con-
tributed to the deinstitutionalization of people with severe mental illness. Subsequently, the
homelessness and incarceration of individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizophrenia-
like disorders (SLDs) dramatically increased, suggesting that symptomatic relief in these
conditions rarely translates into sustained recovery [1,2].

Although most patients treated with antipsychotic drugs attain partial remission
or amelioration of symptoms, few return to premorbid levels of functioning, measured
by stable employment, attending school, raising a family, and being independent in all
activities of daily living (ADLs) [3]. For this reason, large public institutions for the
treatment of mental illness, such as state hospitals, are still in existence, while sanatoria for
tuberculosis or leprosy were closed almost a century ago.

The early antipsychotic drugs were derived from methylene blue (MB), a phenoth-
iazine synthesized in 1876 in Germany. The interest in this agent dramatically surged
after the realization that it exerts antidepressant actions by inhibiting monoamine oxidase

A (MAO-A), a surreptitious discovery that commenced the era of modern psychophar-
macology [4]. Upon chlorpromazine’s approval in the US, over 40 dopamine-blocking
antipsychotic drugs were developed, aiming at restoring premorbid functioning by target-
ing major symptoms.

Although antipsychotic drugs are extremely efficacious for acute psychosis as the
symptoms are often cleared within hours or days, sustained recovery is achieved by only
13.5% of patients after an initial psychotic episode [5]. Moreover, looking at the entire 20th
century, in the early decades, long-term recovery was at 20%, not differing from the end of
the century when antipsychotic drugs were being widely utilized [6]. At present, 33% of
patients with SCZ relapse within 12 months after an initial psychotic episode, 26% remain
homeless at the 2-year follow-up, and 5 years after the first psychotic outbreak, only 10% are
employed [7–9]. Together, these data indicate that the blockade of dopamine (DA) receptors
seldom improves the outcomes of SCZ or SLDs. Moreover, some antipsychotic drugs,
including clozapine and aripiprazole, upregulate DA, suggesting that this neurotransmitter
may play an indirect role in the etiopathogenesis of severe mental illness [10,11].

The aims of this narrative review are as follows:

1.

2.

To summarize what is known about the role of premature cellular/neuronal senes-
cence in the pathogenesis of SCZ and SLDs.
To discuss potential strategies for improving sustained recovery in SCZ and SLDs
via natural senotherapeutics, microbial phenazines, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
antagonists, membrane lipid replacement (MLR), and mitochondrial transplantation.

2. Premature Cellular Senescence in Schizophrenia

Patients with SCZ and SLDs live, on average, 15–20 years less than the general popula-
tion, exhibit shortened telomeres, and develop age-related diseases earlier in life, suggesting
that premature cellular senescence plays an important role in this pathology [12–15]. In-
deed, many researchers and clinicians refer to SCZ as a “segmental progeria” to highlight
the accelerated aging of tissues and organs, including the brain, in this disorder [12].

Cellular senescence is a program of permanent cell cycle arrest with an active metabolism,
shortened telomeres, accumulation of macromolecular aggregates, increased levels of
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and a toxic secretome, known as the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can spread senescence to neigh-
boring healthy cells [16]. It is believed that cellular senescence defends against tumorigene-
sis by preventing oncogene-driven malignant transformation. However, the accumulation
of aged cells and the subsequent inflammation may paradoxically promote cancer and dis-
rupt biological barriers, facilitating the dissemination of metastases [16,17]. Inflammation
and senescent cells increase the permeability of the gut barrier, facilitating the translocation
of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacteria (or their molecules) into the systemic circulation, a
phenomenon encountered in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders [18]. In an-
other example, microbiota-derived gallic acid converts p53, the key anticancer protein, into
an oncogene that drives tumorigenesis [19–21]. As p53, an SCZ risk gene, also promotes
cellular senescence, it likely connects microbial translocation to severe mental illness [22,23].
Indeed, bacterial molecules were demonstrated to induce cellular senescence in neurons
and microglia, as documented in SCZ [24–27]. For example, Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced
psychosis was reported in epidemics as well as in urinary tract infections (UTI), connecting
bacteria to SCZ and SLDs [28].

Recent studies have found that downregulated DA receptors and transporters induce
premature neuronal senescence, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling is required to
avert early brain aging [29]. These findings were further substantiated by virus-induced
senescence (VIS), a phenotype documented during the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by
brain aging due to the infection of DA neurons [29,30]. Clostridium sp. are gut microbes
also known for interfering with dopaminergic signaling, further linking cellular senescence
to insufficient DA [31,32]. This is significant since both treated and untreated SCZ patients
were found to exhibit body-wide premature cellular/neuronal aging, linking this condition

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 5904

to abnormal intestinal permeability [33,34]. Indeed, SCZ has been associated with increased
microbial migration into the host’s systemic circulation [35–37]. Furthermore, premature
cellular senescence may contribute to the other SCZ markers, including gray matter loss,
decreased mitochondrial abundance, the attenuation of gamma (γ)-oscillations in EEGs,
and the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.

2.1. Ferrosenescence vs. Ferroptosis

Fe2+ is an essential nutrient for both hosts and pathogens. It is also a cofactor in
the biosynthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, enzymes involved
in the synthesis of DA and serotonin (5-HT), respectively. In the gut, DA acts as a mi-
crobial siderophore, which clears Fe2+ from the microenvironment, lowering the risk of
ferroptosis [38,39].

Senescent cells, including neurons, upregulate intracellular Fe2+, which in the vicinity
of cytosolic lipids, may increase the risk of peroxidation and neuronal death by ferroptosis.
In addition, senescence-upregulated lactate may also increase intracellular Fe2+ levels
further, predisposing to neuronal demise [40]. Moreover, Fe2+ and lactate are known to
enhance the biosynthesis of ceramide, a cell membrane lipid, which, in excess, can cause
neurotoxicity [41,42]. Ferroptosis has been documented in SCZ; however, senescent cells
are often resistant to programmed cell death, suggesting that impaired autophagy may
drive iron-mediated brain aging [43–45]. Conversely, inducing ferroptosis in senescent cells
precipitates their clearance by the immune system, indicating that this mechanism may be
compensatory [46].

In our previous work, we introduced the concept of ferrosenescence, senescent cells,
including neurons, with damaged DNA and dysfunctional p53-mediated genomic repair, as
well as defective NKCs that are incapable of clearing senescent cells [47–49]. Ferrosenescent
cells are resistant to ferroptosis due to impaired ferritin autophagy as well as the upreg-
ulation of ferroptosis inhibitors [glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) and apolipoprotein E
(APOE)] [50–53]. For example, in SCZ, upregulated APOE, low ferritin levels, and increased
intracellular Fe2+ levels likely reflect ferrosenescence [43,54]. Consequently, we believe that
ferrosenescence may be more prevalent in SCZ than ferroptosis. Moreover, ferrosenescence
may account for the other SCZ markers, including a decreased brain volume, γ-oscillations
in EEGs, and mitochondrial dysfunction [55–58].

2.2. Senescent Gut Barrier

The relationship between the gut microbiome and senescent intestinal epithelial cells
(IECs) is an emerging field that likely plays a major role in SCZ and SLDs [59,60]. For
example, antibodies against translocated microbes, such as Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were demonstrated in SCZ with neg-
ative symptoms, connecting microbial translocation to this pathology [61]. Moreover,
translocated gut microbes may trigger nutritional immunity and iron sequestration in
macrophages to withhold it from microbes, decreasing total circulatory Fe2+ levels [62].
In conditions of low circulatory Fe2+ levels, translocated bacteria may adopt a dormant
state in human tissues, including the brain, awaiting increased Fe2+ availability to be
reactivated [63,64].

The gut microbiota is immunologically tolerated in the gut lumen; however, upon
translocation into the systemic circulation, the immune system is activated, triggering
inflammation and, often, antibodies against microbial molecules. Since the microorganisms
populating the GI tract express receptors identical or structurally related to human pro-
teins, antibodies against these molecules may be construed as autoantibodies. Moreover,
translocated microbes elicit inflammation, promoting cellular senescence, engendering
a vicious circle in which senescent IECs facilitate the translocation of bacteria across the
lamina propria, while inflammation triggered by these pathogens promotes further senes-
cence [65–67].

Senescent cells were recently found to play a major role in the pathogenesis of inflam-
matory bowel disease (IBD), a condition marked by the translocation of microbes from
the GI tract into the host tissues, including the brain [68]. This is further enhanced by the
increased prevalence of SCZ in patients with IBD, emphasizing the role of the GI tract
in severe mental illness [68,69]. Microbial translocation has been extensively studied in
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a condition marked by the massive exit of
microbes from the GI tract due to interleukin-22 (IL-22) deficiency [70,71]. For this reason,
we believe that recombinant IL-22 may comprise a new SCZ treatment [72].

3. Aryl Hydrocarbon, the Master Regulator of Cellular Senescence

The AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor originally characterized as the
receptor for dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Later, it was revealed that the
AhR is also activated by various endogenous and exogenous ligands, driving multiple
physiological processes and pathologies, likely including SCZ [73,74]. Aside from being
the master regulator of cellular senescence, the AhR negatively regulates lactate and, by
extension, the posttranslational modification, lactylation. As such, a dysfunctional AhR
may drive both premature neuronal and glial aging as well as the excessive lactylation
documented in SCZ and SLDs [75,76].

Several AhR ligands are molecules of interest in neuropsychiatry, including DA,
phenazines, phenothiazines, serotonin, melatonin, and clozapine, suggesting that this tran-
scription factor may play a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of SCZ (Figure 1) [77–79].
In prokaryotes, DA exerts iron-chelating properties; therefore, depletion in this neurotrans-
mitter may upregulate intracellular Fe2+, leading to ferroptosis or ferrosenescence [39,43].
In addition, DA enhances the phagocytic properties of NKCs, facilitating the elimination of
senescent and damaged cells [80]. Moreover, DA, via the DA 1 receptor (D1R), enhances
the generation of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter required for maintaining both
the gray matter volume and rapid brain oscillations [81]. Conversely, lowering DA levels
may promote inflammation by the accumulation of aged cells.

Compared with young neurons, senescent neuronal cells downregulate most surface
receptors, including the dopaminergic and cholinergic ones, contain fewer mitochondria,
and undergo metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming via lactate and lactylation, respec-
tively [82]. Indeed, the lactylation of histone 3 (H3) lysine opposes neuronal senescence
and restores the pre-senescent cellular status, suggesting that harnessing lactylation may
comprise a potential neuropsychiatric therapy [83]. However, dysfunctional lactylation was
shown to induce cell cycle reentry in senescent neurons, as demonstrated in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders [84]. Moreover, senescent microglia
with histone 3 (H3K18) lactylation were demonstrated to adopt a neurotoxic phenotype,
engaging in the elimination of healthy synapses and neurons, a phenomenon documented
in SCZ and neurodegeneration [85–89]. Following this line of research, preclinical studies
have revealed that neuronal excitation and social stress enhance the lactylation of histones,
further linking this posttranslational modification to the pathogenesis of SCZ and SLDs [90].
Furthermore, previous studies have associated SCZ with increased brain lactate levels and
the alteration of histone proteins, suggesting that lactylated neurotoxic microglia may be
more detrimental to severe mental illness than previously thought [91–94].

Figure 1. In the cytosol, the AhR is stabilized by two HSP90 molecules. DA, oxidized lipids (and toxic
ceramide), clozapine, serotonin, melatonin, and vitamin D3 are AhR ligands [95,96]. Pollutants, such
as phthalate and bisphenol A (BPA), are also AhR ligands. In contrast, aripiprazole binds to the AhR
chaperone, HSP90. HSP90 prevents AhR’s entry into the nucleus where it drives the transcription of
genes, including those for cellular senescence.

3.1. Gray and White Matter Loss

The data on sustained remission in SCZ match with neuroimaging studies, showing
life-long gray matter loss in both medicated and unmedicated patients. This is significant,
as preventing or restoring brain volume homeostasis likely improves outcomes in severe
mental illness [97–101]. Indeed, preclinical studies have shown that AhR homeostasis
is directly correlated with brain volume, suggesting that DA/AhR binding is critical
for averting parenchymal loss [95]. The AhR also preserves the gray matter volume by
regulating the availability of ACh, which, like DA, acts as a brain volume guardian [102].
Low brain DA levels also induce white matter loss, but to a lesser extent in SCZ compared
with demyelinating disorders [103,104]. This is significant, as microbial toxins, including
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as environmental pollutants, such as plasticizers, are AhR
ligands associated with SCZ. For example, the high comorbidity between SCZ and IBD
may be the result of bacterial molecules “escaping” through the hyperpermeable intestinal
barrier, a hallmark of IBD [105–107]. In addition, the higher prevalence of SCZ in northern
regions of the world compared with the equatorial countries may be explained by AhR
binding to vitamin D3 [96].

In contrast, aripiprazole binds to the AhR chaperone, HSP90. HSP90 prevents AhRʹs entry into the nucleus where it drives the transcrip-tion of genes, including those for cellular senescence. 3.1. Gray and White Matter Loss The data on sustained remission in SCZ match with neuroimaging studies, showing life-long gray matter loss in both medicated and unmedicated patients. This is signiﬁcant, as preventing or restoring brain volume homeostasis likely improves outcomes in severe mental illness [97–101]. Indeed, preclinical studies have shown that AhR homeostasis is directly correlated with brain volume, suggesting that DA/AhR binding is critical for averting parenchymal loss [95]. The AhR also preserves the gray matter volume by regu-lating the availability of ACh, which, like DA, acts as a brain volume guardian [102]. Low brain DA levels also induce white matter loss, but to a lesser extent in SCZ compared with demyelinating disorders [103,104]. This is signiﬁcant, as microbial toxins, including lipo-polysaccharide (LPS), as well as environmental pollutants, such as plasticizers, are AhR ligands associated with SCZ. For example, the high comorbidity between SCZ and IBD may be the result of bacterial molecules “escaping” through the hyperpermeable intestinal barrier, a hallmark of IBD [105–107]. In addition, the higher prevalence of SCZ in northern regions of the world compared with the equatorial countries may be explained by AhR binding to vitamin D3 [96]. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 5904

Taken together, DA is an indispensable neurotransmitter that prevents gray matter
depletion by acting as an AhR ligand. Conversely, DA-blocking antipsychotic drugs
may induce iatrogenic gray matter loss. This is further substantiated by the fact that
clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug, is an AhR ligand that also upregulates DA
levels [77,78,108].

3.2. Dopamine-Sparing Antipsychotics

Like SCZ itself, treatment with first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs is
associated with gray matter loss, suggesting that brain DA levels are strictly regulated
so that minimal fluctuations in this neurotransmitter may cause brain volume deple-
tion [99,100,109–114].

Novel studies have found that antipsychotic drugs transfer positive or negative electri-
cal charges to their substrates, donating or accepting electrons. For example, DA, lithium,
clozapine, novel phenothiazines, and aripiprazole give away electrons, preserving the gray
matter volume, while most other antipsychotics are electron acceptors and associated with
brain volume loss [115–117]. More studies are needed to identify and develop DA-sparing,
electron-donor antipsychotics.

4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Loss of Gamma-Band Oscillations

According to the endosymbiotic hypothesis, mitochondria are derived from ancestral
bacteria and can communicate with the gut microbes via chemical messengers, such as
ROS and sphingolipids [118–120]. Ceramide, one of the sphingolipids, is secreted by the
microbiome and, in excess, can be toxic to mitochondria [121]. Senescent cells, including
neurons, upregulate ceramide, probably accounting for the paucity of mitochondria in
the aging brain [122–124]. Moreover, senescence-upregulated intracellular Fe2+ disrupts
ceramide metabolism, further contributing to mitochondrial loss [125]. Indeed, ceramide-
induced mitochondrial damage has been associated with atherosclerosis and SCZ, disorders
associated with premature cellular senescence [126,127].

Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of sphingomyelin
into ceramide, has been identified as an SCZ target, and ASM inhibitors, such as fluvox-
amine and rosuvastatin, appear to ameliorate clinical outcomes in this disorder [128]. In
addition, a natural alkaloid, berberine, decreases ceramide levels as well as inflammation,
indicating a potentially beneficial effect on SCZ and SLDs [129,130].

Neurons have the capability of replacing defective mitochondria by importing them
from microglia and astrocytes via tunneling nanotubules or extracellular vesicles (EVs)
Indeed, preventing neuronal loss by supplying mitochondria to
(Figure 2) [131,132].
neurons is one of the main functions of astrocytes.

Interestingly, antidepressant drugs in the class of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
including fluvoxamine, facilitate mitochondrial export to neuronal cells, emphasizing the
neuroprotective role of these agents (Figure 3) [133]. Indeed, SSRIs were demonstrated
to delay the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into dementia, indicating
that mitochondrial import contributes to neuronal rescue [134]. In addition, ferroptosis-
blocking drugs and iron chelators, including halogenated phenazines, may delay or prevent
neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach (see the section on
phenazines and phenothiazines) [135,136].

Aside from supplying healthy mitochondria to neurons, astrocytes also export antioxi-
dants, including GPX-4, an enzyme involved in rescuing neuronal cells from ferroptosis.
Additionally, ASM inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine, facilitate GPX-4 biosynthesis, averting
ferroptosis. Indeed, fluvoxamine and other SSRIs preserve neuronal cells by both inhibit-
ing ferroptosis and facilitating mitochondrial transfer [137,138]. GPX-4 is derived from
cysteine, which enters astrocytes via the cystine/glutamate antiporter (Xc−) and enables
the biosynthesis of glutathione and GPX-4 (Figure 2).

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 5904

Figure 2. Glial cells, including astrocytes, supply neurons with healthy mitochondria via tunneling
nanotubules, preventing apoptosis [137,138]. In addition, astrocytes prevent neuronal ferroptosis
by transferring antioxidants, including GPX-4. Astrocytes uptake cystine via the cystine/glutamate
antiporter (Xc−). Cysteine can also be obtained from methionine via glutathione. Fe2+ enters neurons
through the transferrin receptor-1 (TRF-1), which is stored in ferritin and requires ferritinophagy to
be released. Excess Fe2+ exits the neurons via ferroportin (FPT) channels.

Given that γ-band frequencies are energy-consuming, mitochondria are essential for
the generation of these rapid brain oscillations [139]. In this regard, preclinical studies have
shown that lost γ-oscillations can be restored by inhibiting GSK-3β, an enzyme previously
implicated in SCZ and SLDs [140,141]. Several antipsychotic drugs, including lithium, and
natural compounds, kaempferol, are GSK-3β inhibitors and, therefore, capable of restoring
the γ-rhythm (Figure 3).

Entrainment of Gamma-Band Oscillations in Schizophrenia

Oscillations in the γ-range are rhythmic patterns of high-frequency (25 Hz to 100 Hz)
EEG waves, playing a key role in cognition, attention, perception, and movement [142].
Under normal circumstances, this neuronal activity is synchronized across numerous
brain regions, while in SCZ, there are γ-rhythm abnormalities, especially those elicited by
auditory stimuli [143,144].

Interneurons, including parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP),
and somatostatin (SST), are the main drivers of γ-rhythms, indicating that the defective
inhibition of pyramidal cells may trigger the loss of rapid rhythms [145,146]. Regarding

In addition, astrocytes prevent neuronal ferroptosis by transferring antioxidants, including GPX-4. Astrocytes uptake cystine via the cystine/glutamate an-tiporter (Xc−). Cysteine can also be obtained from methionine via glutathione. Fe2+ enters neurons through the transferrin receptor-1 (TRF-1), which is stored in ferritin and requires ferritinophagy to be released. Excess Fe2+ exits the neurons via ferroportin (FPT) channels. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 5904

neurotransmitters, γ-oscillations are dependent on ACh, an AhR-regulated biomolecule
controlled by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a direct AhR ligand [147].

Figure 3. The AhR is represented in the cytosol and mitochondria (mitoAhR). Akt negatively
phosphorylates GSK-3β, inhibiting its function. Toxic ceramides and iron activate GSK-3β, resulting
in excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels, which activate the mitoAhR, triggering organelle
death. mtROS can also cause mitochondrial demise by activating cytochrome-C and caspase-3. The
natural compounds berberine and kaempferol inhibit GSK-3β, averting organelle death.

Several studies have connected γ-oscillations to the microbiome-derived ACh, linking
rapid EEG rhythms to intestinal microbes [148,149]. This is significant, as decreased brain
ACh levels in SCZ have been associated with gray matter loss, emphasizing the key role
of the AhR and AChE in maintaining both brain volume and rapid oscillations [150,151].
Given the important role of the cholinergic system in SCZ, it is not surprising that novel
ACh-based antipsychotics have been developed [130,152].

Aside from ACh and mitochondrial import, lost γ-oscillations may be restored by
entrainment with sensory stimuli, such as ultrasound or transcutaneous vagal nerve stim-
ulation (tVNS) at 40 Hz, emphasizing a potential strategy for SCZ and SLDs [149,153].
Interestingly, tVNS improves not only neuronal function but also optimizes gut permeabil-
ity, decreasing microbial translocation [149,154].

5. Senotherapeutics

It is currently established that severe mental illness is associated with cellular/neuronal
senescence, indicating that endogenous or exogenous toxins may play a key role in this
pathology [155–157]. For example, viral or bacterial infections induce premature aging in
brain cells by eliciting immune responses, likely triggering psychosis [158,159]. Indeed,
new-onset psychosis was documented in infections with senescence-inducing viruses
including HIV and SARS-CoV-2 [160,161].

Senotherapeutics are natural or synthetic compounds that can delay, prevent, or
reverse cellular/neuronal senescence. Senotherapeutics comprise senolytic agents that
facilitate the elimination of senescent cells, and senomorphic compounds capable of deleting

Toxic ceramides and iron activate GSK-3β, resulting in excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels, which activate the mitoAhR, triggering organelle death. mtROS can also cause mitochondrial demise by activating cytochrome-C and caspase-3. The natural compounds berberine and kaempferol inhibit GSK-3β, averting organelle death. Aside from supplying healthy mitochondria to neurons, astrocytes also export anti-oxidants, including GPX-4, an enzyme involved in rescuing neuronal cells from ferropto-sis. Additionally, ASM inhibitors, such as ﬂuvoxamine, facilitate GPX-4 biosynthesis, averting ferroptosis. Indeed, ﬂuvoxamine and other SSRIs preserve neuronal cells by both inhibiting ferroptosis and facilitating mitochondrial transfer [137,138]. GPX-4 is derived from cysteine, which enters astrocytes via the cystine/glutamate antiporter (Xc−) and ena-bles the biosynthesis of glutathione and GPX-4 (Figure 2). Given that γ-band frequencies are energy-consuming, mitochondria are essential for the generation of these rapid brain oscillations [139]. In this regard, preclinical studies have shown that lost γ-oscillations can be restored by inhibiting GSK-3β, an enzyme pre-viously implicated in SCZ and SLDs [140,141]. Several antipsychotic drugs, including lith-ium, and natural compounds, kaempferol, are GSK-3β inhibitors and, therefore, capable of restoring the γ-rhythm (Figure 3).

senescence markers, including SASP and SA-β-gal [162]. While, in the past, it was thought
that cellular senescence could not be reversed, newer studies have found that inhibiting
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) can revert cellular senescence in
humans [163]. Interestingly, PDK1 is an upstream modulator of SCZ-linked GSK-3β.

Senolytic antibiotics belong to a distinct class of agents that include azithromycin,
minocycline, and roxithromycin and possess neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and
senolytic properties [164]. For example, it has been known for some time that minocycline
may be beneficial for SCZ, suggesting that senolytics have a place in the treatment of SCZ
and SLDs, probably by clearing neurotoxic glial cells [165].

Other senolytic agents relevant to SCZ and SLDs are summarized in Table 1.

A senolytic vaccine recently tested in progeroid mice may usher in a new era of
neuropsychiatry, raising the possibility of vaccination or serum treatment for SCZ and
SLDs [174]. Another immunological intervention, an antibody–drug conjugate against a
membrane senescence marker, was demonstrated to clear senescent, damaged, or infected
cells, emphasizing a new therapeutic strategy [175].

6. Membrane Lipid Replacement (MLR)

MLR refers to the oral administration of natural cell membrane glycerophospholipids,
along with kaempferol (3,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), a flavonoid found in tea, broccoli,
cabbage, kale, beans, endive, leek, tomato, strawberries, and grapes [176]. Like lithium and
some antipsychotics, kaempferol is an inhibitor of GSK-3β, suggesting that it may exert
antipsychotic properties without the typical adverse effects of psychotropic drugs [177,178].
The administration of MLR + kaempferol gradually replaces damaged phospholipids,
ceramides, and oxysterols from neuronal and/or mitochondrial membranes with natural
glycerophospholipids and a polyphenol.

Oxidized membrane lipids are AhR ligands that have previously been implicated in
the pathogenesis of SCZ (Figure 1). MLR and kaempferol exert a dual mechanism of action:
the elimination of lipid peroxides and GSK-3β inhibition [179]. Replacing oxidized plasma
and/or mitochondrial membrane fats with healthy natural lipids averts ferroptosis and
optimizes neurotransmission by correcting membrane distortion. Conversely, oxidized
membrane lipids can trigger neuronal demise by ferroptosis [180]. Indeed, MLR reverses
biophysical changes in the plasma and mitochondrial membrane induced by oxidized
lipids. This action is not different from that of phenothiazines, which insert themselves into
the lipid bilayer, lowering the curvature of cell membranes (Figure 4). In contrast, oxidized
lipids form looped structures and generate membrane curvatures and pores, which leads
to cell death [181].

Figure 4. The lipid bilayer of neuronal membranes is easily oxidated when intracellular iron is
upregulated [182]. Oxysterols, including 7-ketocholesterol (a toxic oxide), and oxidated phospho-
lipids alter the biophysical properties of cell membranes, disrupting neurotransmission [183]. In
addition, oxidized lipids activate the AhR, triggering premature neuronal senescence. Phenazines,
phenothiazines, and their derivatives intercalate themselves into the lipid bilayer, repairing the lipids
in cellular and/or mitochondrial membranes.

7. Phenazines and Antioxidant Phenothiazines

Phenazines are microbial metabolites produced by various soil and water microorgan-

isms that exert antibacterial, anticancer, antimalarial, and antipsychotic properties [184].

7.1. Natural Phenazines

Natural phenazines are synthesized by bacteria, including Streptococcus species and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter known for generating pyocyanin (5-N-methyl-1-hydroxyphenazine),
a compound with electron-shuttling properties [185,186].

Neuroprotective natural phenazines such as geranyl-phenazine, an AChE inhibitor,
upregulate ACh, exerting antipsychotic effects via muscarinic receptors [187,188]. An-
other natural phenazine with neuroprotective functions, bara-phenazines A–G, are fused
molecules with antipsychotic properties derived from Streptomyces sp. PU-10A [189].

7.2. Synthetic Phenazine Derivatives

Synthetic phenazine derivatives consist of over 6000 compounds, exerting antimi-
crobial, antiparasitic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Pon-
temazines A and B are neuroprotective phenazines derived from Streptomyces sp. UT1123,
which, in animal studies, rescued hippocampal neurons from glutamate cytotoxicity, high-
lighting their pro-cognitive properties that could benefit patients with negative SCZ symp-
toms [190]. Pontemazines exert antioxidant, radical-scavenging properties and inhibit

Membrane Lipid Replacement (MLR)  MLR refers to the oral administration of natural cell membrane glycerophospholipids, along with kaempferol (3,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), a flavonoid found in tea, broccoli, cab-bage, kale, beans, endive, leek, tomato, strawberries, and grapes [176]. Like lithium and some antipsychotics, kaempferol is an inhibitor of GSK-3β, suggesting that it may exert antipsy-chotic properties without the typical adverse effects of psychotropic drugs [177,178]. The administration of MLR + kaempferol gradually replaces damaged phospholip-ids, ceramides, and oxysterols from neuronal and/or mitochondrial membranes with nat-ural glycerophospholipids and a polyphenol. Oxidized membrane lipids are AhR ligands that have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of SCZ (Figure 1). MLR and kaempferol exert a dual mechanism of ac-tion: the elimination of lipid peroxides and GSK-3β inhibition [179]. Replacing oxidized plasma and/or mitochondrial membrane fats with healthy natural lipids averts ferroptosis and optimizes neurotransmission by correcting membrane distortion.

lipid peroxidation, suggesting beneficial effects on SCZ [191]. Halogenated phenazines act
as iron chelators and are probably helpful against ferroptosis [192,193]. We believe that
pontemazines and halogenated phenazines should be assessed for their antipsychotic and
anti-neurodegenerative properties (Figure 4).

From a biochemical standpoint, phenazines are almost identical to phenothiazine
antipsychotics and likely possess similar properties (Figure 5). Phenothiazines are typ-
ical antipsychotic drugs utilized primarily for SCZ and SLDs that block dopaminergic
transmission at the level of postsynaptic neurons. They also correct the curvature and
receptor alignment on neuronal/mitochondrial surfaces, restoring signaling homeosta-
sis (Figure 4) [182]. In contrast, oxidized lipids, toxic ceramides, and 7-ketocholesterol
(7KCl) form looped structures, generating membrane curvatures and pores that may lead
to neuronal death [183].

Figure 5. Phenazine vs. phenothiazine: similarities and differences.

7.3. Antioxidant Phenothiazines and Their Derivatives

Antioxidant phenothiazines and their derivatives have recently been developed for
cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Mycobacterium leprae, and other antibiotic-resistant
microbes [194].

Phenothiazine derivatives exert anti-peroxidation properties and protect against lipid
pathology and ferroptosis, suggesting their efficacy as antipsychotic drugs [195]. Phenoth-
iazine nuclei possess hydrophobic properties that facilitate their insertion into the plasma
or mitochondrial membranes [196].

Propenyl-phenothiazine is a potent antioxidant with electron-donor capabilities that
likely prevents gray matter loss in patients with SCZ or SLDs. Moreover, a new category
of tetracyclic and pentacyclic phenothiazines with antioxidant properties have recently
been developed, suggesting their likely efficacy for cognitive impairment and negative SCZ
symptoms [197,198]. Furthermore, N10-carbonyl-substituted phenothiazines were demon-
strated to inhibit lipid peroxidation, suggesting their enhanced antipsychotic efficacy [100].

8. Mitochondrial Transfer and Transplantation

Mitochondrial transplantation experiments started in the 1980s, wherein naked or-
ganelles were co-incubated with various cell types, attempting to facilitate internaliza-
tion [199]. Using HeLa cells and mesenchymal stem cells as mitochondrial sources, this
transplantation technique takes only 1–2 h to supply organelles to mitochondria-depleted
cells [200–202]. At present, mitochondrial transplantation in cardiomyocytes is possible and
can be confirmed by the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the heart [203,204].
Mitochondrial transplantation to rescue neurons from ferroptosis is currently possible
and has been successfully performed in both animals and humans; however, to the best of
our knowledge, it has not been attempted as a treatment for mental illness [205].

Rescuing the mitochondria with MLR, kaempferol, and berberine (Figure 6) is a
strategy for averting GSK-3β overactivation by toxic ceramides, oxysterols, or oxidized
phospholipids [130,206]. In addition, SSRIs, GJA1-20K, and CD38 signaling were demon-
strated to facilitate mitochondrial transfer, emphasizing potential strategies for restoring
neurometabolic homeostasis in severe mental illness and neurodegeneration [207,208].

Figure 6. Membrane lipid replacement (MLR) replenishes oxidized lipids from the plasma and mito-
chondrial membrane, such as oxysterols, ceramide, and oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) with natural
glycerophospholipids. Oxidized lipids inhibit AKT (by serine-9 phosphorylation), activating GSK-3β,
an enzyme associated with SCZ, SLDs, and cancer (by p53 inhibition). Berberine and kaempferol
inhibit GSK-3β activation by different mechanisms, generating beneficial effects. Ceramide activates
GSK-3β by the dephosphorylation of serine-9.

9. Using AhR Antagonists as Antipsychotics

Aberrant AhR overactivation has been associated with psychosis, while several antag-
onists of this receptor exert antipsychotic properties. The following natural and synthetic
AhR inhibitors were found to be therapeutic for SCZ:

1.

Quercetin is a natural flavonoid and plant pigment that exerts antioxidant and anti-
cancer properties. In the CNS, quercetin is a negative allosteric modulator of GABARs
as well as an enhancer of glutamatergic neurotransmission, a signaling pathway defi-
cient in SCZ [209]. In addition, quercetin inhibits the apoptosis of cortical neurons,
likely preventing gray matter loss.

3.

2. Apigenin is a plant-based remedy extract from Elsholtzia rugulosa used by traditional
practitioners from Africa for treating mental illness. Aside from antagonizing the
AhR, apigenin exhibits vasorelaxant, antioxidant, and antipsychotic properties [209].
Alstonine is an indole alkaloid with antipsychotic effects that increases serotonergic,
but not dopaminergic, signaling, possibly facilitating mitochondrial transfer [209,210].
Luteolin is a natural antipsychotic that exerts its beneficial actions by reducing mi-
croglial inflammation [202]. Luteolin is currently under clinical trials for SCZ treat-
ment (NCT05204407).

10. Synthetic AhR Antagonists

Synthetic AhR antagonists are anti-inflammatory and anticancer compounds that

likely exert antipsychotic properties.

IK-175 (structure undisclosed) was shown to block ligand-mediated AhR activation in
preclinical studies. IK-175 was recently approved for cancer treatment, and it may possess
antipsychotic properties [211].

HBU651 is a novel synthetic AhR antagonist developed primarily for cancer treatment
that appears to be a suitable candidate for SCZ treatment [212]. Figure 7 summarizes AhR
agonists/antagonists relevant for neuropsychiatry.

11. Recombinant Interleukin-22

Recombinant interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a pleiotropic cytokine known for facilitating
tissue regeneration and protecting the GI tract barrier. Recombinant IL-22, comprising two
molecules connected by a fusion protein, exerts better efficacy with reduced systemic side
effects [223].

In our previous work, we hypothesized that SCZ and SLDs may be initiated by
aberrant AhR hyperactivation by endogenous or exogenous ligands, including intestinal or
environmental toxins, such as LPS or plasticizers, respectively [224].

This hypothesis is supported by the following findings:

SCZ is often comorbid with IBD, conditions associated with increased gut barrier
permeability and microbial translocation from the GI tract into host tissues, including
the brain.
Translocation markers, including soluble CD14 (sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide-
binding protein (LBP), are elevated in SCZ, suggesting bacterial translocation.
Increased BBB permeability in SCZ enables translocated gut microbes to reach the brain.

The following are examples of pathogens triggering psychosis:

The Escherichia coli (E. coli) outbreak in 2011 in Germany has been associated with
cases of new-onset psychosis.

IL-22 has been successfully used to restore the integrity of the gut barrier in various
conditions, including IBD, HIV, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [225,226]. We construe
that recombinant IL-22 would be effective for SCZ by limiting the translocation of bacteria
and/or their molecules.

12. Vehicles: Lipid Nanoparticles

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs), vehicles for drug delivery. As LNPs are liposoluble, they can access specific body
niches, including the brain [227].

The COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are
incorporated in LNPs comprising four lipids: 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC), PEG, an alternative cholesterol, and ionizable lipids such as SM-102 or ALC-
0315 [228]. SM-102, ALC-0315, and the alternative cholesterol are proprietary molecules
and have not been revealed. However, looking at the previous LNP research, the ionizable
lipids likely resemble DLin-MC3-DMA, which was approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [229–231]. Like phenothiazines,
LNPs enter cells, including neurons, through the endocytic pathway (EP). Subsequently,
LNPs travel from the early to late endosomes, but not to lysosomes because the organelle
pH of 4.5–5.0 could degrade the nanoparticles. Therefore, “lysosomal escape” into the
cytosol must occur from the late endosomes without interfering with autophagy, as most
antipsychotic drugs do.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 5904

15 of 24

Utilizing LNPs not for vaccination, but as a vehicle for transporting psychotropic
drugs directly to the neuronal networks could revolutionize psychopharmacology. As
nano-doses of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers would be utilized for the treatment of
psychotic symptoms or affective disorders, systemic adverse effects would be avoided. We
surmise that LNPs would be extremely efficacious as vehicles for psychotropic drugs.

13. Conclusions

Antipsychotic drugs are extremely helpful for the acute symptoms of SCZ or SLDs;
however, sustained recovery (measured by the ability to hold a job, go to school, raise a
family, or be independent in ADLs) is rarely achieved. For this reason, the next chapter in
neuropsychopharmacology will have to improve functionality rather than symptom resolution.
Over the past 70 years, it has become obvious that lowering dopaminergic trans-
mission does not restore premorbid functions in patients with SCZ and SLDs. DA is an
indispensable neurotransmitter that maintains the integrity of the brain parenchyma, a
physiological function disrupted by both SCZ and its treatment.

The study of neuronal senescence-induced neuropsychiatric disorders is in its infancy
but is rapidly developing, especially after the advent of age-accelerating viruses, such as
HIV and COVID-19. Aberrantly activated AhR, the master regulator of cellular senescence,
explains not only how gut microbes and/or their molecules trigger psychosis but also how
environmental pollutants precipitate SCZ or SLDs. AhR hyperactivation likely accounts
for gray matter reduction, the loss of rapid brain oscillations, and oxidized lipids in
the plasma and mitochondrial membranes. The recent discovery that DA, serotonin,
vitamin D3, clozapine, and melatonin are AhR ligands has opened new horizons in the
management of chronic psychosis. Novel strategies, such as natural senotherapeutics,
MLR, GSK-3β, ceramide inhibitors, recombinant IL-22, mitochondrial transplantation
or transfer, and AhR antagonists, could improve long-term recovery in SCZ or SLDs.
Senescence-associated downregulation of ACh and DA likely reduces brain volume and
rapid oscillations, contributing to deficit symptoms.

The utilization of natural compounds, such as kaempferol or berberine, alone or in
conjunction with LNP-delivered DA-sparing antipsychotic drugs, may improve sustained
recovery in patients with severe mental illness.
