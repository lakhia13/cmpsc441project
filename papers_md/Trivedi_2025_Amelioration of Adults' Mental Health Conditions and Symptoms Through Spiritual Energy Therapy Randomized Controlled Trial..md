ABSTRACT
Reduced physical activities, social support, old age, and increased exposure to regular stressful life events are crucial factors for 
poor mental health. Although several medicines are available to support mental health- related symptoms, due to more side ef-
fects and non- compliance for long- term use, these conventional medicines are not appropriate to tackle these symptoms. In this 
context, the study aimed to determine whether spiritual energy therapy with an experienced spiritual energy practitioner could 
manage adults' psychological and mental health- related symptoms. A single- blind, active- controlled, randomized trial was per-
formed. Enrolled participants (n = 80) exhibited at least one psychological symptom. Spiritual energy therapy was given to sub-
jects at two time points (Days 0 and 90) in physical presence. Psychological scores and physiological biomarkers were assessed. 
Treatment group subjects were reported to have a significant (p ≤ 0.0001) improvement in psychological scores related to stress, 
depression, mental restlessness, emotional trauma, hopelessness, etc., compared to the control group subjects. Additionally, sub-
jects in the treatment group also showed significant improvement in biological markers compared to those in the control group. 
No treatment- related adverse effects were observed. The current study data unveiled a significant effect of spiritual energy ther-
apy on improving adults' mental health conditions and symptoms, and significantly decreased elevated proinflammatory and 
oxidative stress biomarker levels in the treatment group.

1   |   Introduction

Biofields are electromagnetic fields that surround and permeate 
living bodies, affecting them in various ways [1]. Biofield ther-
apy is a complementary and integrative health practice in which 
practitioners  use  “subtle  energy”  to  help  their  clients  restore 
energetic balance and promote healing [2]. Previously, comple-
mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) had been considered 
a  fringe  science.  However,  some  cases  provided  novel,  effica-
cious therapeutic interventions against pathophysiological con-
ditions, intensifying the growing popularity of biofield therapy 

modalities  in  the  general  community  [3].  However,  the  exact 
mechanism of action is still uncertain;  the  widespread accept-
ability,  therapeutic  effectiveness,  and  beneficial  effects  among 
Americans  are  very  lucrative  [4].  Over  the  past  20 years,  com-
plementary,  alternative,  and  integrative  medicine  (CAIM)  has 
been showing popularity in patients with psychiatric disorders 
either to combat their symptoms or to counter side effects that 
arise from other treatments [5]. Biofield treatment modalities in-
clude Reiki, Healing Touch, Therapeutic Touch, Spiritual/Faith 
Healing,  and  External  Qigong,  all  targeting  various  physical 
and mental health issues [1]. Baldwin et al., 2014, reported little

robust  evidence  of  the  effectiveness  of  biofield  energy  therapy 
on  unique  physiological  changes  [6].  Researchers  have  shown 
statistically significant declines in anxiety, depression, phobias, 
post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, pain, and other 
psychological symptoms in clinical trials using energy psychol-
ogy.  It  also  demonstrated  improved  endocrine,  cardiovascular, 
and immune function, including reduced cortisol levels, resting 
heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, etc. [7, 8].

Spiritual energy is an intriguing aspect of alternative and com-
plementary  medicine  (ACM)  that  involves  systematic  inter-
ventions  by  individuals  to  help  others  improve  their  physical, 
emotional,  or  spiritual  condition  [9,  10].  Its  use  has  increased 
worldwide,  with  over  64%  of  Americans  engaging  in  prayer 
and  spiritual  energy  healing.  Spiritual  energy  therapy  is  one 
form  of  biofield  energy  therapy,  which  involves  blessings  and/
or prayer, where the healer does not physically contact the pa-
tient but offers treatment from a distance [11]. Different forms 
of energy, like electrical signaling, brain waves, and electromag-
netic fields, exist. All forms of energy presumably influence the 
body's  electrical  signaling,  brain  waves,  and  electromagnetic 
fields,  which  activate  or  deactivate  specific  neural  processes 
[12].  Alternatively,  there  can  be  subtle  energies,  referred  to  as 
“biofields,”  which  fall  within  energy  psychology.  It  is  believed 
that  these  energies,  which  have  not  yet  been  detected  by  con-
ventional instruments, are the infrastructure of the body's elec-
tromagnetic  and  physiological  systems,  which  are  involved  in 
health and healing worldwide [13].

The  Trivedi  Effect  is  one  of  the  scientifically  validated  and 
widely reported spiritual energy healing approaches (one form 
of  biofield  energy  therapy),  based  on  data  from  preclinical 
(cell- based  and  animal- based)  and  clinical  (human)  studies 
[14,  15].  Trivedi  healing  practitioners  can  harness  the  con-
sciousness  energy  from  the  universe  and  transfer  it  to  both 
living  and  non- living  objects  through  their  unique  inherent 
thought transmission process in a positive way; this phenom-
enon  is  called The Trivedi Effect. Evidence suggests  that pa-
tients  with  refractory  diseases  who  have  not  benefited  from 
conventional  medical  treatments  may  find  improvement 
through  healing  prayer  and/or  blessing,  although  the  exact 
mechanisms  remain  unclear  [16].  Given  the  growing  interest 
in complementary and alternative therapies, especially among 
those with chronic or incurable conditions, this study aimed to 
explore the effects of spiritual energy therapy on psychological 
disorders and physiological biomarkers in adults.

2   |   Materials and Methods

2.1   |   Experimental Regimen

This  study  was  a  randomized,  open- label,  active- controlled, 
parallel- group,  and  single- center  trial.  To  generate  the  ran-
dom  allocation  sequence,  a  simple  randomization  technique 
was used through a random- number table. At the initiation of 
this trial, 104 subjects were screened; 80 were eligible based on 
inclusion–exclusion  criteria  and  enrolled  randomly  into  two 
groups  namely,  control  (n = 43)  and  biofield  energy  treatment 
(n = 37).  Spiritual  (blessing)  energy  therapy  was  provided  on 
Days  0  and  90  for  the  subjects  of  the  blessing/biofield  energy 
treatment  group.  Control  subjects  did  not  receive  any  treat-
ment. Parameters like psychological and mental health- related 
scores  and  physiological  biomarkers  were  measured  at  three 
time points (at Days 0, 90, and 180) in both control and spiritual 
blessing  energy  treatment  groups  (Figure  1).  However,  at  the 
end of this trial, 77 subjects were presented with control (n = 42; 
male- 24 and female- 18) and biofield treatment (n = 35; male- 15 
and  female- 20)  (Figure  2).  Following  Day  180  observation,  a 
safety follow- up was conducted for 1 week (±2 days). This study 
was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki  [17].  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approval  was 
obtained from the Sangini Hospital Ethics Committee (Reg. No. 
ECR/147/Inst/GJ/2013/RR- 16),  Gujarat,  India,  for  this  study. 
The control data were adopted from Trivedi et al. 2023 [18], for 
better analysis and interpretation of results.

2.2   |   Criteria for Inclusion, Exclusion, 
and Withdrawal of Subjects

Participants  from  the  South  Asian  population  (India;  both 
male and female) aged 20–45 years old at the time of providing 
written informed consent were eligible for the trial. An adult 
population was selected, as the chances of interference from 
concurrent  diseases  were  very  unlikely.  Most  adults  suffer 
from psychological and mental health symptoms. Individuals 
who reported at least one or more of the following symptoms 
were  included:  anxiety/depression/post- traumatic  stress  dis-
order (PTSD), asthenia (general weakness/tiredness/fatigue), 
fear  of  the  future/ongoing  negative  thoughts,  sleep  distur-
bances  (poor  quality  sleep),  emotional  trauma,  stress  and 
confusion,  mental  restlessness/mind  chattering,  lack  of  self- 
worth,  menstrual  cycle  disorders,  and  hopelessness/suicidal

tendencies.  Participants  were  deemed  ineligible  if  they  met 
any of the following criteria: (a) a history of allergic responses, 
alcohol dependence, or drug abuse; (b) significant diseases or 
clinically  relevant  abnormal  findings  identified  during  the 
screening  of  medical  history,  physical  examination,  or  labo-
ratory  evaluations;  (c)  known  history  of  positive  HIV,  HCV, 
HBsAg, or VDRL/RPR tests.

2.3   |   Spiritual (Blessing/Biofield) Energy Healing 
Therapy Modalities

The  control  group  subjects  did  not  receive  any  treatment. 
However,  the  energy  treatment  subjects  received  spiritual 
(blessing/prayer)  energy  therapy  on  Days  0  and  90  in  physi-
cal  presence  (at  Cliantha  Research  Ltd.,  Gujarat,  India)  from 
a  renowned  (> 15 years)  spiritual  energy  practitioner.  Briefly, 
the  healing  practitioner  sat  about  half  a  meter  from  each  sub-
ject. The treatment was provided through his unique inherent 
thought  transmission  process  via  laying  his  hands  for  about 
3 min  per  subject.  During  spiritual  energy  therapy/blessing/
prayer, his palms were positioned about 10–20 cm above the sub-
ject's head, and the healing timing was noted in the electronic 
case report forms.

2.4   |   Safety Assessment

According to Brown et al., 1999, adverse effects were monitored 
through  physical  presence  and/or  phone  calls  to  each  subject 
to determine safety [19]. The investigator performed a physical 
examination, including temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, 
and respiratory rate at all the time points to evaluate the adverse 
effects. Before vital signs were taken, subjects were instructed to 
remain seated for about 5 min.

2.5   |   Psychological Scoring by 7- Point Likert Scale

Symptoms  related  to  psychological  and  mental  health 
were  scored  using  a  psychological  questionnaire  (PQ)  (Ref. 
Annexure  S1:  Supplementary  document)  using  fourteen  (14) 
categories of symptoms (asthenia, sleep disturbances, anxiety/
depression/PTSD, stress, etc.), based on a 7- point Likert scale 
of scoring (1 never, 2 rarely, 3 occasionally, 4 periodic (some-
times), 5 frequently, 6 more frequent (usually), 7 continuously 
(every  time))  (Likert,  1932  [20];  Diefenbach  and  Weinstein, 
1993  [21]).  The  PQ  was  made  by  in- house  renowned  experi-
enced  psychologists  based  on  literature  with  some  modifica-
tions,  and  these  PQs  were  routinely  used  in  various  clinical 
trial  projects.  Briefly,  each  subject's  score  in  terms  of  symp-
toms/perception  was  calculated  in  each  category,  and  the 
total scores of the treatment group were compared to the con-
trol group.

2.6   |   Assessment of Physiological Biomarkers

On Days 0, 90, and 180, blood was withdrawn from all the par-
ticipants, and serum was isolated using the standard method by 
LabCorp  (Salt  Lake  City,  Utah,  USA).  Biomarkers  like  proin-
flammatory  cytokines,  vitamins,  hormones,  klotho  protein, 
etc. were analyzed from the serum samples stored at −20°C by 
ELISA as per the manufacturer's instructions.

2.7   |   Analysis

The  data  were  represented  as  mean ± standard  deviation/
standard  error  of  the  mean  (SEM).  Psychological  scores  were 
performed  using  one- way  Repeated  Measure  Analysis  of 
Covariance  (RM- ANCOVA)  with  a  95%  confidence  interval 

3 of 9

(CI)  of  the  difference  between  treatments  using  SAS  9.4  (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, USA). Physiological biomarkers were ana-
lyzed using one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by 
post  hoc  analysis  using  Dunnett's  test  for  multiple  group  com-
parisons  using  SigmaPlot  (v11.0).  The  p ≤ 0.05  was  considered 
statistically significant.

3   |   Results

3.1   |   Demographic Features and Adverse Effects

The  demographic  characteristics  of  study  subjects  were  noted 
and shown in Table 1. No clinically significant abnormalities in 
physical  findings  like  body  weight,  body  mass  index  were  ob-
served between the two groups during the trial.

3.2   |   Psychological Scoring by 7- Point Likert Scale

The spiritual blessing energy therapy subjects scored were sig-
nificantly  (p < 0.0001)  lower  than  the  subjects  assigned  to  the 
control group on both Day 90 as well as Day 180. The data were 
consistent from Day 0 to the end of the study, Day 180 (Table 2).

3.3   |   Determination of Biological Markers 
in Serum

Pro- inflammatory  cytokines,  interleukin- 6  (IL- 6)  and  IL- 1β 
were  significantly  reduced  by  76.86%  and  94.7%  at  Day  180  in 
the  spiritual  blessing  energy  treatment  group  compared  to  the 
control group. The level of IL- 8 was significantly decreased by 
53.67% at Day 90 and 72.04% at Day 180 in the spiritual bless-
ing  energy  treatment  group  compared  to  the  control  group. 
Furthermore,  the  level  of  TNF- α  was  significantly  reduced 
by  71.97%  (at  Day  90)  and  95.70%  (at  Day  180)  in  the  spiritual 
blessing energy treatment group compared to the control group 
(Table  3).  Vitamin  C  was  significantly  (p ≤ 0.001)  increased  in 
the  spiritual  blessing  energy  treatment  group  by  81.63%  and 
169.41% at Days 90 and 180, respectively, compared to the con-
trol  group.  Vitamin  B12  was  non- significantly  increased  in  the 
spiritual blessing energy treatment group by 20.64% and 15.77% 
at Days 90 and 180, respectively, compared to the control group. 
Vitamin D3 metabolite like 25- OH vitamin D3 was significantly 
(p ≤ 0.001) increased in the spiritual blessing energy treatment 
group  by  31.62%  and  42.71%  at  Days  90  and  180,  respectively, 
compared to the control group.

There  was  a  significantly  increased  CD8+CD28−  cell  count 
in  the  spiritual  blessing  energy  treatment  subjects  by  25.41% 
(p ≤ 0.001)  at  Day  180,  while  it  non- significantly  increased  by 
10.05% at Day 90 compared to the control group. An expression 
of  the  anti- aging  protein,  klotho,  was  significantly  (p ≤ 0.001) 
increased  by  392.89%  (at  Day  90)  and  685.33%  (at  Day  180)  in 
the  spiritual  blessing  energy  treatment  group  with  respect  to 
the  control  group.  Insulin  was  significantly  increased  in  the 
spiritual blessing energy treatment group by 25.78% and 88.97% 
on  Days  90  and  180,  respectively,  compared  to  the  control 
group.  Oxidation  of  low- density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol, 
oxidized- LDL,  was  significantly  (p ≤ 0.001)  reduced  in  the

In the holistic care model, a human being is viewed as a com-
plex entity, encompassing biological, social, psychological, and 
spiritual  aspects,  with  all  these  elements  taken  into  account 
during the health care process. Since these dimensions are dy-
namic  and  interconnected,  it  is  essential  to  consider  each  one 
for its potential health benefits [22]. The spiritual dimension, in 
particular, encompasses other aspects of human existence and 
is  a  vital  component  of  an  individual's  well- being  and  health. 
During times of personal crisis and illness, spirituality becomes 
increasingly significant, and spiritual needs often become more 
pronounced  [23].  Additionally,  patients  frequently  utilize  spir-
itual  coping  strategies  throughout  the  illness  process.  Among 
the  most  commonly  employed  spiritual  resources  are  spiritual 
energy via spiritual blessings and prayer [24].

Other biofield therapies such as Healing Touch and Reiki show 
the safety aspect of this therapy and simultaneously increase re-
laxation,  decrease  anxiety  and  stress,  and  improve  mood  [25]. 
In  the  conventional  system,  the  treatment  options  for  anxiety 
and  depression  include  antidepressant  and  anti- anxiety  med-
ications;  however,  these  can  be  unpopular  with  people  due  to 
side effects and non- compliance with taking long- term medica-
tion. Based on the randomized controlled trials, about 36.9% of 
people  treated  for  anxiety  with  the  second- generation  antipsy-
chotic drug quetiapine withdrew during the studies [26]. CAM 
efficacy can often be based on a single case of results. The social 
media sites and various scientific literature described evidence 
that a CAM practitioner had treated many years of patients who 
have bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophrenia just with a 
naturopathic treatment like homeopathy [27]. Some CAMs are 
considered efficacious in the absence of controlled clinical trials: 
yoga, adequate diet, and physical exercise might help in cases of 
depression.  Thus,  adding  these  CAMs  to  a  conventional  treat-
ment  might  be  helpful  too  [28].  The  combination  of  yoga  and 

antidepressants  can  reduce  the  symptoms  of  depression  in  pa-
tients  with  major  depression.  Yoga  is  an  ideal  complementary 
and alternative therapy for mental health disorders [29]. Around 
the world, 154 million people suffer from mood disorders asso-
ciated with suicide and physical comorbidities. The use of com-
plementary and alternative therapies has been used either alone 
or in conjunction with conventional therapies in the treatment 
of mood disorders [30]. In this study, the authors found absolute 
support  for  the  hypothesis  that  the  psychological  and  mental 
health- related symptoms were significantly reduced after spiri-
tual energy therapy/biofield energy treatment. These reductions 
in  psychological  symptoms  also  correlated  with  a  decrease  in 
proinflammatory  cytokines  (IL- 6,  IL- 1β,  IL- 8,  TNF- α).  Some 
data  demonstrated  that  not  all  psychological  symptoms  cor-
relate  with  elevated  levels  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  [31]. 
One of the study data reported that increased inflammation is 
due to a subgroup of depressed patients who failed to respond to 
conventional antidepressant therapy [32].

The  correlation  between  nutritional  deficiencies  and  mental 
health is one of the most important and relevant aspects of over-
all society's well- being on a global scale [33]. Nutrient (protein, 
vitamins, and minerals) deficiencies can affect the appearance 
of depressive symptoms. However, it is also true that apart from 
diet,  many  other  aspects  are  also  responsible  for  maintaining 
good mental health and quality of life [34]. A growing number of 
researchers are very keen to know whether diet can be a modi-
fiable factor in mental health. Some evidence suggests that diet 
and  related  eating  habits  protect  against  psychiatric  disorders 
[35].  Current  clinical  trial  data  showed  a  significant  improve-
ment of vitamin C and D in the spiritual energy therapy/biofield- 
treated subjects compared to the control subjects, possibly that 
might be the reason for the improvement of psychological symp-
toms. Researchers have already reported that low vitamin D lev-
els  are  associated  with  increased  symptoms  of  depression  and 
anxiety. Vitamin D is very important for preventing psychologi-
cal disorders due to its antioxidant properties [36].

A  deficiency  of  antiaging  protein  (klotho)  leads  to  behavioral 
disorders or neurodegeneration. The importance of α- klotho in 
the aging process has been well documented. Further, klotho's 
antioxidant  and  anti- inflammatory  effects  were  reported  [37]. 
In  this  study,  spiritual  energy  healing  treated  individuals

4.1   |   How This Therapy Acts?

The main challenge to accepting spiritual energy in healthcare 
is the unknown mechanism behind it. Studies on biofield energy 
healing  suggest  that  healers  can  transmit  energy,  with  experi-
ments showing the emission of strong signals of low- frequency 
magnetic fields from their hands, similar to those used in elec-
trotherapy for tissue healing [38–40]. EEGs reveal that a healer's 
brain waves often synchronize with those of the patient, indicat-
ing  potential  energy  transmission  [41].  The  philosophy  behind 
spiritual energy is rooted in the interconnectedness of all things 
at  an  energetic  level,  a  concept  supported  by  quantum  physics 
[42]. While understanding healing mechanisms is important for 
credibility,  patients  primarily  care  about  the  beneficial  effects. 
Positive outcomes from spiritual energy therapy by The Trivedi 
Effect practitioners may be due to a “channel of energy” transmit-
ted to clients. These effects might connect thought transmission 
with the universe and consciousness [43], potentially explained 
by quantum entanglement [44, 45], and bioresonance [46].

The  research  on  biofield  energy  therapy  suggests  that  individ-
uals can interact either physically or remotely, challenging the 
traditional  understanding  of  human  interactions  and  commu-
nication. There are various theories about how biofield energy 
therapy  and  spiritual  healing  may  be  effective.  Recent  studies 
propose  that  biofield  energy  therapies  may  involve  a  spiritual 
aspect that operates at the quantum level through the healer's 
energy and thoughts, leading to healing through instantaneous 
communication  at  the  quantum  level  via  quantum  entangle-
ment  [44].  Quantum  entanglement  allows  for  instantaneous 
connection between separated system elements and can be uti-
lized for signaling across vast distances [47]. The study's authors 
speculate that the healer's responses might be due to the quan-
tum entanglement phenomenon. However, the idea that healing 
works through quantum fields is largely theoretical, and further 
scientific trials need to be conducted in this area [48].

quality  of  life.  Elevated  proinflammatory  and  oxidative  stress 
biomarkers  may  be  relevant  to  the  severity  of  psychological 
symptoms in all subjects. However, the study results showed an 
overall association, characterized by a reduction in inflamma-
tory and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as an improvement 
in other functional physiological biomarkers, which reflects an 
improvement in overall psychological and mental health- related 
symptoms.  Furthermore,  in- depth  disease-   and/or  symptom- 
specific  clinical  studies  can  be  designed  and  conducted  using 
the  findings  from  this  study,  enabling  the  implementation  of 
effective interventions that integrate spiritual energy into their 
holistic approach to patient care.

5   |   Conclusion

In  conclusion,  the  spiritual  energy  therapy  provided  by  the 
healer  to  adult  participants  with  perceived  psychological  and 
mental  health  symptoms  led  to  noticeable  and  significant  im-
provements. Additionally, the experiences reported by the treat-
ment  group  subjects  indicated  that  healing  through  spiritual 
blessing  and  prayer  therapy  led  to  enhanced  feelings  of  hope, 
happiness, and calmness, as well as many positive outcomes, in-
cluding improved mental health, psychological well- being, and
