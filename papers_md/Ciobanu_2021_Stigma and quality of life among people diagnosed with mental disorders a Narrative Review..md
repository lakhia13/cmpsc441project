ABSTRACT

InTRODUCTIOn: The anti-psychiatric movements that emerged in the early 1960s led to the appearance of stigma 

in  psychiatry.  The  misunderstanding  of  the  concept  of  mental  disorder,  the  negative  way  in  which  associated 

hospitalization was perceived, the inclination to treat patients through psychological therapies, and the criticism 

of pharmacological treatment led to the discrediting of psychiatry.

AIm: The current paper aims to review the available literature regarding the impact of stigma on the quality of life 

of people diagnosed with mental disorders. 

mATERIAL AnD mETHODS: A narrative review of relevant literature published between 1999 and 2021 was conducted. 

The authors analysed studies found on PubMed and the Web of Science electronic databases. The search terms 

combined two overlapping areas with keywords such as "stigma" and "mental disorders". A descriptive analysis was 

employed to synthesize the obtained data.

RESULTS: Stigma continues to be an important challenge to the management of health conditions in people with 

mental disorders. A lack of comprehension may give the impression that all psychiatric patients are aggressive 

and are unable to function adequately. Such stigmatizing beliefs and habits have proven to be very difficult  

to change.

COnCLUSIOnS: Due to the stigmatization and repulsive attitudes in society, patients are reluctant to be linked to any 

form of mental disorder or to be seen as having any contact with mental health professionals. This undermines the 

beneficial effects of treatment, resulting in a poor quality of life and diminished socio-occupational functioning. 

АннотАция

АКтУАЛЬноСтЬ: Антипсихиатрические течения, возникшие в начале 1960-х гг., привели к стигматизации 

психиатрии.  Неправильное  понимание  концепции  психических  расстройств,  негативное  отношение 

к госпитализации, тенденция к лечению пациентов посредством психологии и критика фармакологических 

методов лечения стали причиной дискредитации психиатрии.

цЕЛЬ: Целью данной работы является анализ доступных литературных источников, касающихся влияния 

стигматизации на качество жизни людей с диагностированными психическими расстройствами. 

МАтЕРиАЛ  и  МЕтоДЫ:  Был  выполнен  нарративный  обзор  релевантных  литературных  источников, 

опубликованных в период с 1999 г. по 2021 г. Авторы проанализировали работы, представленные в электронных 

базах данных PubMed и Web of Science. Используемые для поиска ключевые слова, например, «стигматизация» 

и «психические расстройства», объединяли две взаимосвязанные области. Для обобщения полученных данных 

применялся метод описательного анализа.

РЕЗУЛЬтАтЫ: Стигматизация остается важной проблемой при лечении людей с психическими расстройствами. 

Из-за недостаточного понимания проблемы может создаваться впечатление, что все пациенты с психическими 

заболеваниями агрессивны и неспособны адекватно функционировать. Как оказалось, такие стигматизирующие 

мнения и стереотипы очень сложно изменить. 

ВЫВоДЫ: Из-за стигматизации и отторжения обществом пациенты не хотят, чтобы их каким-либо образом 

ассоциировали с психическими расстройствами или знали о том, что они посещают специалистов в области 

психиатрии. Это снижает положительный эффект терапии, а также приводит к ухудшению качества жизни 

и ограничению социального и профессионального функционирования.

The concept of stigma originally referred to the mark, the 

to comprise stigma, including distinguishing and labelling 

sign made with red iron by powerful people in society 
disgusted by Greek slaves, murderers, or others.1 Since 

ancient times, this has been used to differentiate and 

label people from what are considered to be inferior social 
classes, leading to their social marginalization.2 Within the 

differences, the association of human differences with 

negative  attributes,  the  notion  of  “us”  and  “them”  as 

two  distinct  categories,  and  the  loss  of  social  status

others as different, associating differences with negative

stereotypes, separating different people from the rest 

of  the  population,  and  stigmatizing  the  experience 

attempted  to  theorize  the  subject  of  stigma.  Link  and 
Phelan4 suggest that stigma is a complex phenomenon, 

which cannot be explained sufficiently by a single, unique 

of discrimination based on labelling. 

Today, stigma remains a fundamental problem, linking 
psychiatry, psychology, and public health,5 as its negative

through marginalization.19

that almost one-third of psychiatric patients experience 

self-stigma, worsening their ability to have a normal life 

and complete recovery, and leading to a low subjective 
quality  of  life.23,24  Cavelti  et  al.  assessed  the  insight,

education.46 In an American national poll, young people 

who  had  received  anti-stigma  education  were  more

in comparison with adults over the age of 55 who had 
not received such training.47
