Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae 
were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks. The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  could  be  associated  with  psychiatric  implications.  We  investigated  the 
psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory 
predictors. 

We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month 
follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to 
investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) 
symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and 
follow-up oxygen saturation levels. 

A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for de-
pression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological 
range  in at least one clinical  dimension. Despite significantly lower  levels of  baseline inflammatory markers, 
females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis 
showed  increased  scores  on  most  psychopathological  measures,  with  similar  baseline  inflammation.  Baseline 
systemic  immune-inflammation  index  (SII),  which  reflects  the  immune  response  and  systemic  inflammation 
based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression 
and anxiety at follow-up. 

PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years 
of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current 
insights  on  inflammation in  psychiatry, and  the  present observation  of  worse  inflammation  leading  to  worse 
depression,  we  recommend  to  assess  psychopathology  of  COVID-19  survivors  and  to  deepen  research  on  in-
flammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.     

“After three weeks of treatments, I was healing from COVID, at home, 
had no fever, and just a little cough. But sometimes at night, my breath 
could go away all of a sudden, making me feel as if I was to die. I knew 
what  it  was  because  I  had  suffered  from  panic  attacks  in  the  past.  I 

stayed there out on the balcony, for hours, trying to put fresh air into my 
lungs. It was terrible. Panic made me suffer more than COVID.”

1.  Introduction 

Respiratory viral diseases are associated with both acute and long- 
lasting  psychopathological  consequences  in  the  survivors  (Bohmwald 
et al., 2018). Coronaviruses are negatively stranded RNA viruses, which 
cause infections ranging from common colds to severe acute respiratory 
syndrome  (Peiris  et  al.,  2003).  Coronavirus  exposure  has  also  been 
implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases during and after Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
(MERS) outbreaks (Rogers et al., 2020). SARS survivors reported psy-
chiatric  symptoms,  including  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD), 
depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) at 
1  to  50 months  follow  up  (Wu  et  al.,  2020;  Cheng  et  al.,  2004;  Lam 
et al., 2009). Moreover, seropositivity for coronaviruses associated with 
suicide  and  psychosis  persisting  one  year  after  SARS  (Okusaga  et  al., 
2011). 

The  recent  spreading  of  the  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome 
Coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  seems  yet  to  be  associated  with 
psychiatric implication (Troyer et al., 2020). Preliminary data suggest 
that  patients  with  COVID-19  might  experience  delirium,  depression, 
anxiety, and insomnia (Rogers et al., 2020). Coronaviruses could induce 
psychopathological sequelae through direct viral infection of the cen-
tral nervous system  (CNS) or  indirectly via an  immune response (Wu 
et  al., 2020).  Clinical, post-mortem,  animal,  in  vitro,  and  cell  culture 
studies  demonstrated  that  coronaviruses  are  potentially  neurotropic 
and  can  induce  neuronal  injuries  (Desforges  et  al.,  2019).  Notwith-
standing possible brain infiltration, “cytokines storm” involved in the 
immune response to coronaviruses may cause psychiatric symptoms by 
precipitating neuroinflammation (Dantzer, 2018; Netland et al., 2008). 
Current  insight  into  inflammation  in  psychiatry  suggests  that  in-
fection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could specifically 
foster psychopathology, adding to the psychological stress of enduring a 
potentially fatal disease, and to stress-associated inflammation (Miller 
and  Raison,  2016).  The  interaction  between  innate  and  adaptive  im-
mune systems and neurotransmitters emerged as a mechanism under-
pinning mood disorders, psychosis, and anxiety disorders (Najjar et al., 
2013). In  addition  to  the  immunological  mechanisms,  fear  of  illness, 
uncertainty of the future, stigma, traumatic memories of severe illness, 
and social isolation experienced by patients during the COVID-19 are 
significant  psychological  stressors  that  may  interact  in  defining  psy-
chopathological outcome (Brooks et al., 2020; Carvalho et al., 2020). 
Taking  into  account  the  sparse  preliminary  studies  on  COVID-19 
and  considering  the  previous  evidence  about  SARS  and  MERS  out-
breaks,  we  hypothesize  that  COVID-19  survivors  will  show  a  high 
prevalence  of  emergent  psychiatric  conditions  including  mood  dis-
orders, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and insomnia. Available data indicate 
that  confusion  and  delirium  are  common  features  in  the  acute  stage, 
while to date, no data exist on psychopathology in the post-illness phase 
(Rogers et al., 2020; Vindegaard and Eriksen Benros, 2020). Thus, the 
present  study  aims  to  investigate  the  psychopathological  impact  of 
COVID-19  in  survivors  at  one  month  follow  up,  also  considering  the 
effect of possible risk factors.

2.2.  Data collection and analysis 

An  unstructured  clinical  interview  was  conducted  by  well-trained 
psychiatrists in charge using the best estimation procedure, taking into 
account available charts, computerized medical records, and, if needed, 
the information provided by a relative. Sociodemographic and clinical 
data  were  collected  using  a  data  extraction  form,  including  age,  sex, 
psychiatric history, duration of hospitalization, baseline inflammatory 
markers, and follow-up oxygen saturation level. Baseline inflammatory 
markers during acute COVID-19 were extracted from ED charts: C-re-
active  Protein  (CRP),  neutrophil/lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR),  monocyte/ 
lymphocyte  ratio  (MLR),  and  systemic  immune-inflammation  index 
(SII)  (SII = platelets X neutrophils/lymphocytes)  (Feng  et  al.,  2020). 
Oxygen saturation level was recorded at the follow-up visit, soon after 
the psychiatric evaluation, to provide an index of respiratory efficiency. 
Current  psychopathology  was  measured  using  the  following  self- 
report questionnaire: Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) (Creamer 
et al., 2003), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) (Armour et al., 2016), 
Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) (Zung, 1965), 13-item Beck’s 
Depression Inventory (BDI-13) (Beck and Steer, 1984), State-Trait An-
xiety Inventory form Y (STAI-Y) (Vigneau and Cormier, 2008), Medical 
Outcomes  Study  Sleep  Scale  (MOS-SS)  (Hays  et  al.,  2005),  Women’s 
Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS) (Levine et al., 2003), 
and  Obsessive-Compulsive  Inventory  (OCI)  (Foa  et  al.,  2002).  Scores 
were considered in the pathological range when higher than generally 
accepted  standard  cutoff  scores  (IES-R ≥ 33;  PCL-5 ≥ 33;  ZSDS 
index ≥ 50; 
STAI-trait ≥ 40; 
WHIIRS ≥ 9; OCI ≥ 21) 

STAI-state ≥ 40; 

BDI-13 ≥ 9; 

Statistical  analyses  to  compare  group  means  and  frequencies 
(Student’s t-test, Pearson χ2  test) exploring effects of sex, hospitaliza-
tion,  or  previous  history  of  psychiatric  illness  on  symptoms  severity 
were  performed, and  Pearson’s  correlation  analysis  was  performed  to 
explore the correlation between age, duration of hospitalization, time 
after discharge, baseline inflammatory marker, and oxygen saturation 
level and current psychopathology scores. To account for the multiple 
covarying  variables,  we  also  tested  the  effect  of  predictors  (in-
flammatory markers, sex, previous psychiatric history) on the current 
psychopathological  status  (self-report  scores)  by  modelling  the  influ-
ences of the predictors on the outcomes in the context of the General 
Linear Model (GLM) and calculating the statistical significance of the 
effect of the single independent factors on the dependent variables by 
parametric  estimates  of  predictor  variables  (least  squares  method). 
Analyses of multivariate and univariate effects were perfomed by using 
a  commercially  available  software  package  (StatSoft  Statistica  12, 
Tulsa,  OK,  USA)  and  following  standard  computational  procedures 
(Dobson, 1990; Hill and Lewicki, 2006). 

3.  Results 

We  screened  for  psychiatric  symptoms  402  patients  surviving 
COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 57.8, age range from 18 to 87 years), 
from  April  6  to  June  9,  2020,  during  an  ongoing  prospective  cohort 
study at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in Milan. All patients included in 
the  present  study  had  been  first  evaluated  at  the  Emergency 
Department  (ED),  where  they  underwent  clinical  evaluation,  electro-
cardiogram,  hemogasanalysis,  and  hematological  analysis  (complete 
blood  cell  count  including  differential  white  blood  cell  count,  and  C- 
reactive  protein  (CRP)).  After  that,  patients  were  admitted  for  severe 

Psychiatric  symptoms  in  COVID-19  survivors  and  measures  of  in-
flammation  at  first  clinical  contact  (ED  evaluation)  are  resumed  in  
Table 1. 

A significant proportion of patients self-rated symptoms in the pa-
thological range: overall, 55.7% scored in the clinical range in at least 
one  psychopathological  dimension  (PTSD  according  to  IES-R  and/or 
PCL-5, depression according to ZSDS and/or BDI-13, anxiety according 
to STAI-Y state, and OC symptomatology according to OCI), 36.8% in 
two,  20.6%  in  three,  and  10%  in  four. Severity  of  depression  also

included suicide ideation and planning, with 2.9% scoring 1 (suicidal 
ideation) at the BDI suicide item, 0.8% scoring 2 and 0.8% scoring 3 
(suicidal planning). 

Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients influenced 
the  severity  of  psychopathological  sequelae  of  COVID-19.  Females, 
patients  with  a  positive  previous  psychiatric  diagnosis,  and  patients 
who were managed at home showed an increased score on most mea-
sures (Table 1). 

Consistent  with  known  gender  effects  we  found  a  2.9:1F:M  ratio 
(χ2 = 54.98, p =  < 0.001) according to IES-R and 2.8:1 (χ2 = 17.91, 
p =  < 0.001) according to PCL-5 for clinical PTSD; 2.8:1 (χ2 = 45.45, 
p  <  0.001)  according  to  ZSDS  and  3:1  (χ2 = 15.13,  p  <  0.001)  ac-
cording  to  BDI  for  clinical  depression;  2.2:1  for  clinical  state  anxiety 
(χ2 = 42.15,  p =  < 0.001)  and  2.3:1for  clinical 
trait  anxiety 
(χ2 = 36.11,  p =  < 0.001); 
(χ2 = 15.70, 
and  finally  1,7:1 
p =  < 0.001) for sleep disturbances according to WHIIRS. 

Considering the previous need for psychiatric interventions, prior of 
COVID-19, 36 patients had been diagnosed with major depressive dis-
order, 28 with generalized anxiety disorder, 20 with panic attack dis-
order,  5  with  bipolar  disorder,  5  with  social  phobia,  3  with  eating 
disorders, and 4  with other disorders. These patients suffered  a  more 
significant  impact  on  mental  health,  as  rated  on  most  measures 
(Table 1). 

Duration  of  hospitalization 

inversely  correlated  with  PCL-5 
(r = −0.15,  p = 0.019),  ZSDS  (r = −0.16,  p = 0.009),  BDI-13 
(r = −0.13, p = 0.036), STAI-Y state (r = −0.18, p = 0.003), and OCI 
(r = −0.12, p = 0.044). Age inversely correlated with BDI (r = −0.12, 
p = 0.018), and MOS (r = −0.18, p = 0.001). 

A  multivariate  GLM  analysis  of  the  effects  of  sex,  previous  psy-
chiatric  diagnosis,  and  hospitalization,  on  the  current  psychopatholo-
gical  status  confirmed  a  significant  multivariate  effect  of  sex  (Wilks’ 
λ = 0.78; F = 9.55; d.f. 8,266; p  <  0.0001) and previous psychiatric 
history (Wilks’ λ = 0.89; F = 4.07; d.f. 8,266; p  <  0.0001), but not of 
hospitalization  (Wilks’  λ = 0.98;  F = 0.84;  d.f.  8,266;  p = 0.570). 
Univariate testing showed significantly worse effects on all measures of 
current  psychopathological  status  in  females  (IES-R:  β = 0.389, 
F = 45.84,  d.f.  1,273,  p  <  0.0001;  PCL-5:  β = 0.371,  F = 40.93, 
p  <  0.0001;  ZSDS:  β = 0.396,  F = 47.33,  p  <  0.0001;  BDI: 
β = 0.293,  F = 22.90,  p  <  0.0001;  STAI-Y:  β = 0.396,  F = 47.27, 
p  <  0.0001;  OCI:  β = 0.195,  F = 9.29,  p = 0.0025;  IRS:  β = 0.292, 
F = 21.37, p  <  0.0001; MOS: β = 0.346, F = 31.93, p  <  0.0001) and 
in patients with a previous positive psychiatric history, except for MOS 
(IES-R:  β = 0.274,  F = 25.86,  d.f.  1,273,  p  <  0.0001;  PCL-5: 
β = 0.267,  F = 24.11,  p  <  0.0001;  ZSDS:  β = 0.237,  F = 19.25, 
p  <  0.0001;  BDI:  β = 0.221,  F = 14.74,  p = 0.0002;  STAI-Y: 
β = 0.238,  F = 19.39,  p  <  0.0001;  OCI:  β = 0.190,  F = 9.98, 
p = 0.0018;  IRS:  β = 0.123,  F = 4.29,  p = 0.0393;  MOS:  β = 0.099, 
F = 0.96, p = 0.329). 

Baseline  inflammatory  markers  (CRP,  NLR,  MLR,  and  SII)  were 
higher in males and in patients that were treated as inpatients, while 
follow-up  oxygen  saturation  level  was  higher  in  patients  that  were 
managed at home (Table 1). Baseline inflammatory marker as well as 
follow  up  oxygen  saturation  levels  did  not  correlate  with  psycho-
pathological scores except for a nominal direct correlation between OCI 
and  baseline  MLR,  not  surviving  correction  for  multiple  comparisons 
(Table  2).  A  comparison  (Student’s  t  test)  of  mean  baseline  in-
flammatory  markers  between  patients  who  showed  or  not  psycho-
pathological scores in the clinical range did not show significant effects. 
A multivariate GLM analysis of the effects of baseline inflammatory 
markers (CRP, NLR, MLR, and SII) on the current psychopathological 
status  revealed  however  a  significant  effect  of  SII  (Wilks’  λ = 0.92; 
F = 2.12; d.f. 8,185; p = 0.0357), with no effect of the other markers 
surviving  the  statistical  threshold.  Univariate  testing  showed  that  SII 
significantly  and  positively  influenced  ZSDS  (β = 0.411,  F = 5.18, 
p = 0.0238),  STAI-Y  (β = 0.372,  F = 4.26,  p = 0.0404),  and  MOS 
(β = 0.572, F = 10.49, p = 0.0014).

4.  Discussion 

This is the first study that investigates psychopathology in a sample 
of COVID-19 survivors at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. 
We reported high rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and OC 
symptomatology.  Our  findings  mirror  the  results  from  previous  cor-
onaviruses outbreak studies, where the psychiatric morbidities ranged 
from 10% to 35% in the post-illness stage (Rogers et al., 2020; Sheng 
et al., 2005). 

Psychiatric  consequences  to  SARS-CoV-2  infection  can  be  caused 
both,  by the  immune response  to the virus itself,  or by  psychological 
stressors such as social isolation, psychological impact of a novel severe 
and  potentially  fatal  illness,  concerns  about  infecting  others,  and 
stigma. The immune response to coronaviruses induces local and sys-
temic  production  of  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  other  inflammatory 
mediators (Cameron et al., 2008). COVID-19 patients, such as SARS and 
MERS patients, show high levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Interferon 
(IFN)-γ, CXCL10, and CCL2 suggesting an activation of T-helper-1 cell 
function. Moreover, in COVID-19, unlike in SARS and MERS, elevated 
levels of T-helper-2 cell-secreted cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) were 
found  (Ye  et  al.,  2020;  Channappanavar  and  Perlman,  2017).  Higher 
concentrations of these cytokines seem to suggest a more severe clinical 
course (Huang et al., 2020). Cytokines dysregulation (especially IL-1β, 
IL-6,  IL-10,  IFN-γ,  TNF-α,  and  transforming  growth  factor-β  (TGF-β)) 
are known to involve factors that others and we associated with psy-
chiatric disorders (Kohler et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2011; Renna et al., 
2018; Poletti et al., 2019; Benedetti et al., 2017; Benedetti et al., 2020). 
Neuroinflammation, blood-brain-barrier disruption, peripheral immune 
cell  invasion  into  the  CNS,  neurotransmission  impairment,  hypotha-
lamic-pituitary  adrenal  (HPA)  axis  dysfunction,  microglia  activation 
and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) induction, all represent inter-
action  pathways  between  immune  systems  and  psychopathological 
mechanism underpinning psychiatric disorders (Dantzer, 2018; Najjar 
et al., 2013; Benedetti et al., 2020; Jones and Thomsen, 2013). 

With  regard  to  the  risk  factor  related  to  psychopathology,  con-
sistently  with  previous  epidemiological  studies,  we  have  found  that 
females,  and  patients  with  positive  previous  psychiatric  diagnoses, 
suffered  more  in  all  psychopathological  dimensions  (Vindegaard  and 
Eriksen  Benros,  2020;  Ozamiz-Etxebarria  et  al.,  2020;  Pappa  et  al., 
2020). Moreover, outpatients showed increased anxiety and sleep dis-
turbances,  while  the  duration  of  hospitalization  inversely  correlated 
with  PTSD,  depression,  anxiety,  and  OC  symptomatology.  Also  con-
sidering the worse severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, this 
observation suggests that less healthcare support could have increased 
the social isolation and loneliness typical of COVID-19 pandemics, thus 
inducing  more  psychopathology  after  remission  (Ozbay  et  al.,  2007; 

598

Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017). Finally, younger patients showed higher levels 
of depression and sleep disturbances, in agreement with previous stu-
dies describing a worse psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in 
younger people (Wang et al., 2020). 

Neither  oxygen  saturation  level  at  follow  up  nor  baseline  in-
flammatory markers associated with depression, anxiety, PTSD nor in-
somnia,  suggesting  that  psychiatric  symptomatology  was  not  a  mani-
festation of physical symptoms, with the exception of baseline SII that 
positively associated with measures of anxiety and depression at follow- 
up. The SII is an objective marker of the balance between host systemic 
inflammation  and  immune  response  status  considering  together  neu-
trophil,  platelet,  and  lymphocyte  all  of  them  involved  in  different 
pathway  of  immune/inflammatory  response  (Huang  et  al.,  2019). 
Higher  levels  have  been  associated  with  worse  prognosis  in  several 
medical diseases, in particular in the field of oncology. In a single study, 
higher SII levels were associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
(Zhou  et  al.,  2020),  suggesting  that  it  could  be  a  marker  of  the  low- 
grade inflammation observed in mood disorders (Benedetti et al., 2020; 
Arteaga-Henríquez  et  al.,  2019).  Interestingly,  we also  found  a  direct 
correlation between OCI and MLR and a trend for a direct correlation 
between  OCI  and  NLR  and  SII,  suggesting  that  higher  baseline  in-
flammation could be associated whit later OC symptomatology. Recent 
evidence,  in  agreement  with  our  observation,  suggests  an  impact  of 
COVID-19 on OCD related both to an immune and inflammatory dys-
regulation  both  to  an  increased  perceived  risk  about  contamination 
(Shafran et al., 2020; Banerjee, 2020; Teixeira et al., 2014). Moreover, 
baseline inflammatory parameters where higher among males and in-
patients, who showed less psychopathology at follow-up, corroborating 
the  complexity  of  the  interaction  between  psychopathology  and  phy-
sical status. 

In the light of the above, interest to deepen research on biomarkers 
of  inflammation  is  warranted,  to  investigate  the  possible  association 
between  possible  persistent  low-grade  inflammation  as  observed  in 
mood disorders (Benedetti et al., 2020; Arteaga-Henríquez et al., 2019), 
and psychopathological symptoms at follow-up in COVID-19 survivors. 
This approach could also allow to identify possible new specific targets 
for the treatment of inflammation-related neuropsychiatric conditions 
(Capuron and Miller, 2011). 

The main limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional nature 

that does not allow interpretation for causality. 

5.  Conclusions 

In conclusion, our study hypotheses were supported by the present 
results  based  on  a  cohort  of  402  patients.  As  predicted,  COVID-19 
survivors presented a high prevalence of emergent psychiatric sequelae, 

M.G. Mazza, et al.   

Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 89 (2020) 594–600

with 55% of the sample presenting a pathological score for at least one 
disorder. Higher than average incidence of PTSD, major depression, and 
anxiety, all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with 
years  of  life  lived  with  disability,  is  expected  in  survivors.  Moreover, 
depression  associates  with  a  markedly  increased  risk  of  all-cause  and 
cause-specific  mortality  (Cuijpers  et  al.,  2014).  Considering  the 
alarming  impact  of  COVID-19  infection  on  mental  health,  we  now 
suggest assessing psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors, to diagnose 
and  treat  emergent  psychiatric  conditions,  monitoring  their  changes 
over  time,  with  the  aim  of  reducing the  disease  burden,  which  is  ex-
pected to be very high in patients with psychiatric conditions (Williams, 
2016). This will also allow investigating how the immune-inflammatory 
response translates into psychiatric illness improving our knowledge in 
the etiopathogenesis of these disorders.
