Aim: There is an extensive body of research examining the efﬁcacy of Eye-Movement
Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in treatment of Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). This systematic narrative review aimed to systematically, and narratively,
review robust evidence from Randomized-Controlled Trials examining the efﬁcacy of
EMDR therapy.

Method: Eight databases were searched to identify studies relevant to the study
aim. Two separate systematic searches of published, peer-reviewed evidence were
carried out, considering relevant studies published prior to April 2017. After exclusion
of all
two meta-analyses and four
irrelevant, or non-robust, studies, a total of
Randomized-Controlled Trials were included for review.

Results: Data from meta-analyses and Randomized-Controlled Trials included in this
review evidence the efﬁcacy of EMDR therapy as a treatment for PTSD. Speciﬁcally,
EMDR therapy improved PTSD diagnosis, reduced PTSD symptoms, and reduced other
trauma-related symptoms. EMDR therapy was evidenced as being more effective than
other trauma treatments, and was shown to be an effective therapy when delivered with
different cultures. However, limitations to the current evidence exist, and much current
evidence relies on small sample sizes and provides limited follow-up data.

Conclusions: This systematic narrative review contributes to the current evidence base,
and provides recommendations for practice and future research. This review highlights
the need for additional research to further examine the use of EMDR therapy for PTSD
in a range of clinical populations and cultural contexts.

INTRODUCTION

(EMDR)

Eye-Movement Desensitization Reprocessing
is
a form of Psychotherapy developed by Shapiro (1995).
Ostensibly, EMDR therapy is a trans-diagnostic,
integrative
psychotherapy that has been extensively researched and there is a
growing empirical base for eﬀective for the treatment of adverse
life experiences, namely Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
(Farrell, 2016). EMDR therapy utilizes a theoretical framework
of Adaptive Information Processing (AIP), which posits that the
primary source of psychopathology is the presence of memories
of adverse life experiences inadequately processed by the brain
(Felitti et al., 1998). There is much evidence examining the use
of EMDR therapy as a treatment for trauma, however, much of
this evidence centers upon non-Randomized Controlled Trials
(RCTs).

This report intends to systematically, and narratively, review

robust RCT evidence examining the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy.

METHODS

A systematic literature search of the databases was carried
out, as outlined in Figure 1. After an initial scoping review of
the literature, it became apparent that relevant meta-analyses
of RCT studies were available. Therefore, the ﬁrst systematic
search gathered evidence of all systematic reviews and meta-
analyses, which have synthesized and presented collective RCT
evidence, examining the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy. All of the
meta-analyses returned from this search speciﬁcally focused
on the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy on PTSD symptoms - the
most recent meta-analysis included papers prior to 2014. As a
result, a second search was carried out to look at RCT studies
investigating the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy on PTSD symptoms
between 2014 and 2017, to ensure the most recent evidence was
considered.

Search 1
A database search of published peer-reviewed systematic
evidence relevant to the aim of this review was carried out,
considering all relevant papers prior to April 2017 (Table 1). All
databases were accessed using Northumbria University library’s
online subscription.

The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool (CASP, 2017a,b)
for systematic reviews inﬂuenced the search strategy and was
used to determine the quality of papers, and only those deemed
of medium-high quality were included for review. Papers were
excluded if they were not written in English, they reviewed
non-Randomized-Controlled Trials (RCTs), they were not peer-
reviewed, the review included RCTs including only children
or adolescents, or EMDR therapy was not the focus of the
report. A wildcard search strategy was utilized, to ensure that
relevant papers were not excluded based on international spelling
variations. A total of 24 papers were retrieved from the database
search: ASSIA 2; CINAHL 2; Cochrane library 4; Medline 6;
Psyc Articles 1; PubMed 0; Science Direct 1; Web of Science 8
(Figure 2). Fifteen papers were removed after an initial title and
abstract search, and ﬁve papers were removed as duplicates. Four

papers were read in full, and two papers were further removed
as one was not written in English, and one involved children and
adolescents only. A reference and citation search was conducted
on all relevant papers to maximize the identiﬁcation of relevant
studies, however, no further papers were included as a result
of this. A total of two papers were included in this review
(Table 2).

Search 2
Search 2 aimed to examine the evidence underpinning the use of
EMDR as a form of therapy that has been published since 2014.
All databases, search ﬁelds, language and exclusion criteria were
identical to those search 1, however search terms and year of
publication diﬀered (Table 3). All databases were accessed using
Northumbria University library’s online subscription.

All papers published prior to April 2017

The most recent meta-analysis included evidence prior to
2014, therefore it is imperative that studies between 2014 and
2017 are also considered. A second database search was therefore
carried out, considering RCT evidence of studies examining
the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy on PTSD symptoms between
January 2014 and April 2017. As with search 1 papers were
excluded if they were not written in English, they were not
RCTs, they were not peer-reviewed, they were a pilot study or
reported protocol data, they involved only children/adolescents
under 18 years old, or EMDR therapy was not the focus of the
report. A wildcard search strategy was utilized, to ensure that
relevant papers were not excluded based on international spelling
variations. Again, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool
(CASP, 2017a,b) for RCT evidence was used to determine the
quality of papers, and papers were excluded if they did not
satisfy CASP criteria. A total of 72 papers were retrieved from
the database search: ASSIA 4; CINAHL 1; Medline 5; Psyc
Articles 2; PubMed 3; Science Direct 10; Web of Science 47
(Figure 3).

Sixty-ﬁve papers were removed after an initial title and
abstract search, and three papers were removed as duplicates.
Four papers were read in full. A reference and citation search was
conducted on all relevant papers to maximize the identiﬁcation
of relevant studies, however no further papers were included as a

result of this. A total of four papers were included in this review
(Table 4).

RESULTS

Search 1
Two meta-analyses were included in this review (Chen et al.,
2014, 2015). One was carried out in Taiwan (Chen et al., 2014)
and one was carried out in China (Chen et al., 2015). One
review focused on the use of EMDR therapy for adults with
PTSD (Chen et al., 2015), whereas, one review included studies
with both adults and children (5 of 26 RCTS involved children)
(Chen et al., 2014). One meta-analysis focused on the eﬃcacy of
EMDR therapy compared to various interventions and control
conditions (Chen et al., 2014) whereas, one study speciﬁcally
focused on the eﬃcacy of EMDR compared to CBT (Chen et al.,
2015). Although this meta-analysis speciﬁcally compared EMDR
therapy to CBT, many variants of CBT were included: image
habituation training, trauma-treatment protocol, exposure plus
cognitive reconstruction, prolonged exposure, stress inoculation
training with prolonged exposure,
imaginal exposure, brief
eclectic psychotherapies, and “less standardized” CBT (Chen
et al., 2015). Neither meta-analysis reported the length of follow-
up for RCTs (Chen et al., 2014, 2015).

A total of 37 RCTs, and 1557 participants, were included
over both meta-analyses. A total of seven RCTs were included
in both of the reviews. It is evident that a vast number of
comparator interventions and control conditions were used as
comparisons to EMDR therapy. Furthermore, it is clear that there
are severe inconsistencies between the outcome measures used to
assess symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, among other
symptoms. Inconsistences also persist in use of scale sub-sections,
as well as the scale version used.

Both meta-analyses followed PRISMA reporting guidelines
(Chen et al., 2014, 2015). Meta-analyses provided in-depth,
transparent evidence of their systematic search strategy. When
examining the quality of RCTs, both studies utilized the Cochrane
collaboration tool (Higgins and Green, 2011). The guidelines
stipulate that a research quality score of 6–10 indicates an
acceptable level of quality. One meta-analysis did not give
quality indicators but described the quality assessment process
(Chen et al., 2015), whereas, one meta-analysis stated that
research quality of RCTs varied from 6 to 8 (Chen et al.,
2014). Homogeneity among studies was measured in both meta-
analyses (Chen et al., 2014, 2015) and publication bias was
measured using funnel plot (Chen et al., 2014, 2015), Egger’s test
(Chen et al., 2014, 2015), and Begg’s test (Chen et al., 2015). One
study calculated eﬀect size using Hedge’s g and Cohen’s d (Chen
et al., 2014), and one study calculated eﬀect size using Standard
Mean Diﬀerence (Chen et al., 2015).

Both meta-analyses

reported EMDR therapy as being
signiﬁcantly more eﬀective in reducing PTSD symptoms than
control conditions and other interventions, including CBT. Chen
et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis speciﬁcally looking
at the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy on the symptoms of PTSD
(Chen et al., 2014). Twenty-two of the 26 studies examined

the eﬀect of EMDR therapy on PTSD symptoms. The meta-
analysis data reported that EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly reduced
PTSD symptoms overall (p < 0.001), with moderate eﬀects sizes
being evident (g = −0.662). In this instance, there were no
reported publication biases, however, substantial heterogeneity
was reported between studies.

Similarly, within the meta-analysis conducted by Chen et al.
(2015) examining the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy to CBT, EMDR
therapy was determined as being signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than CBT in reducing PTSD symptoms (p = 0.05)(Chen et al.,
2015). No publication bias was reported, however, heterogeneity
was high. Focusing on sub-scales of PTSD, EMDR therapy
was also signiﬁcantly more beneﬁcial than CBT in reducing
intrusion (p = 0.02) and arousal (p = 0.04)
severity of
(Chen et al., 2015). Only symptoms of avoidance failed to
show a signiﬁcant diﬀerence, and both EMDR therapy and
CBT were comparable for this outcome (p = 0.1) (Chen
et al., 2015). No publication bias was reported, however,
heterogeneity ranged from moderate to high on all three sub-
scales.

Further analyses within the meta-analysis carried out by
Chen et al. (2014) revealed that group therapy carried out with
experienced therapists showed a signiﬁcantly larger eﬀect size on
PTSD symptoms than when carried out with an inexperienced
therapist (g = −0.753; g = −0.234, respectively; p = 0.007)(Chen
et al., 2014).

Chen et al. (2014) also investigated the eﬃcacy of EMDR
therapy on symptoms of depression and anxiety (Chen et al.,
2014). Twenty of
the 25 RCTs examined the eﬀect of
EMDR therapy on symptoms of depression, as the primary
outcome. Findings
report EMDR
therapy as signiﬁcantly reducing symptoms of depression overall
(p < 0.001), with moderate eﬀects being evident (g = −0.643)
(Chen et al., 2014). Once more, no publication bias was reported,
however, heterogeneity was moderate.

from the meta-analysis

Sixteen of the 26 RCTs within the meta-analysis carried out
by Chen et al. (2014) measured symptoms of anxiety as a primary
outcome (Chen et al., 2014). EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly reduced
symptoms of anxiety (p < 0.001) with a moderate eﬀect size being
evident (g = −0.640)(Chen et al., 2014). No publication bias was
reported, but heterogeneity was moderate. Finally, 12 of the 26
RCTs within the meta-analysis conducted by Chen et al. (2014)
reported a signiﬁcant reduction of subjective distress (p < 0.01)
(Chen et al., 2014). A large eﬀect size was evident illustrating the
eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy on subjective distress (g = −0.956)
(Chen et al., 2014). Once more, no publication bias was reported
but heterogeneity was moderate to high.

Chen et al. (2014) further reported that longer treatment
sessions, of more than 60 min, were signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than shorter sessions for symptoms of depression (p = 0.007) and
were also signiﬁcantly more eﬀective for symptoms of anxiety
(p = 0.045). In this instance, homogeneity was reported over
studies.

Summary Search 1
Both meta-analyses demonstrated the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy
in treating symptoms of PTSD. Both studies concluded that
EMDR therapy was more eﬀective in treating symptoms of PTSD
than various interventions and control conditions (Chen et al.,
2014), including forms of CBT (Chen et al., 2015). Furthermore,
Chen et al. (2014) demonstrated that EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly
reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective distress
(Chen et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2014) extrapolated further factors
from RCT ﬁndings to determine that therapist experience of
group therapy was a factor in reducing symptoms of PTSD. The
meta-analysis identiﬁed that treatments lasting more than 60 min
per session was a factor in improving symptoms of depression
and anxiety (Chen et al., 2014).

There are however limitations to these studies. Both meta-
analyses acknowledge that there is a lack of homogeneity between
the RCTs reviewed, as variances exist between study design,
interventions or control conditions used (including variations
of CBT), sample sizes, and outcome measures including the
use of various sub-scales or versions. The diﬀerences in study
characteristics compromise the conclusions carried forward from
these studies. Furthermore, one meta-analysis compares the
eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy to other interventions and control
conditions, however, does not distinguish the diﬀerences of
eﬃcacy between these groups (Chen et al., 2014).

Search 2
All studies examined the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy with
individuals diagnosed with PTSD (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto
et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016), with
all but one study examining the impact of EMDR therapy on
symptoms of PTSD (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016;
ter Heide et al., 2016). Two studies examined the use of EMDR
therapy with refugees diagnosed with PTSD (Acarturk et al.,
2016; ter Heide et al., 2016), one study examined the use of
EMDR therapy for symptoms of PTSD in patients diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis (Carletto et al., 2016), and one study looked at
eﬀect of PTSD, depression and social functioning in patients with
chronic psychotic disorders (de Bont et al., 2016). All studies used
EMDR therapy as the intervention (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto
et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016). Two studies
used additional intervention therapies; prolonged exposure (de
Bont et al., 2016) and relaxation therapy (Carletto et al., 2016).
Two studies included a waiting list group as a control measure
(Acarturk et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016) and one study utilized
stabilization as a control measure (ter Heide et al., 2016).

The number, and length, of sessions diﬀered over the studies.
One study did not provide details of treatment sessions (Acarturk
et al., 2016), one study provided ten 60-min sessions (Carletto
et al., 2016), one study provided eight sessions but provided no

further detail (de Bont et al., 2016), and one study provided
three 60-min sessions, followed by six 90-min sessions (ter Heide
et al., 2016). Studies included between 50 and 155 participants
(Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016; de Bont et al.,
2016; ter Heide et al., 2016) and all studies reported a low
dropout rate, with two of these studies reporting non-signiﬁcant
diﬀerence across conditions (Acarturk et al., 2016; ter Heide
et al., 2016). All studies randomized participants to treatment
groups (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016; de Bont
et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016). In all studies, the treatment
groups were blind to the assessor only (Acarturk et al., 2016;
Carletto et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al.,
2016) as EMDR therapy is a healthcare treatment administered
by a professional, therefore a blind or double blind study is
inappropriate.

Only one study described power analyses, and indicated 80%
power to detect medium eﬀect size (ter Heide et al., 2016). All
studies utilized diﬀerent outcome measures to report symptoms
of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and others, with 19 diﬀerent
measures being used of the four studies. The time of assessment,

and follow-up, also diﬀered between the studies. All studies
reported pre-test measures, post-test measures were carried out
between 1 and 12/15 weeks post-test, and follow-up also varied
between 5 weeks to 6 months post-intervention. One study
was carried out in Turkey (Acarturk et al., 2016), one was
carried out in Italy (Carletto et al., 2016), and two were carried
out in the Netherlands (de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al.,
2016).

All three studies directly measuring symptoms of PTSD found
EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly improved these symptoms (Acarturk
et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016). One study
reported EMDR therapy as being signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than another intervention therapy (Carletto et al., 2016), one
reported EMDR therapy as being signiﬁcantly more eﬀective
than a waiting list control-group (Acarturk et al., 2016), and one
study found EMDR therapy to signiﬁcantly improve some PTSD
symptoms, but no more than a stabilization control group (ter
Heide et al., 2016).

Carletto et al. (2016) utilized both EMDR therapy and
relaxation therapy as intervention therapies to reduce PTSD

individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
symptoms of
(Carletto et al., 2016). The study determined that 17 of 20
EMDR therapy participants no longer met PTSD diagnosis
12–15 weeks after treatment, and none of these 20 EMDR
therapy participants met PTSD diagnosis
6-month
at
signiﬁcantly
follow-up assessment. EMDR therapy was
more eﬀective than relaxation therapy when considering
post-treatment PTSD diagnosis (p = 0.049) (Carletto et al., 2016).
Acarturk et al. (2016) also concluded that EMDR therapy
signiﬁcantly reduced post-test PTSD diagnosis, compared to a
waiting list control group (p < 0.01) (Acarturk et al., 2016).
The study examined the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy for PTSD
and depression among Syrian refugees. The results indicated
that individuals in the waiting-list control group were 24.21
times more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD immediately
post-test, compared to participants in the EMDR therapy
group. Furthermore, the reduced likelihood of PTSD diagnosis
remained signiﬁcant at 1-month follow up, with individuals in
the waiting-list control group being 23 times more likely to be
diagnosed with PTSD, compared to EMDR therapy participants
(p < 0.01)(Acarturk et al., 2016). Further analyses carried out
by Acarturk et al. (2016) found EMDR therapy to signiﬁcantly
reduce the severity of PTSD compared to the waiting list control
group (p < 0.001) and this eﬀect was maintained over time.
Speciﬁcally, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between EMDR
therapy and control group for avoidance (p < 0.01), intrusion
(p < 0.01), and hyper-arousal (p < 0.01). EMDR therapy also
signiﬁcantly improved reports of exposure of traumatic events
compared to the control group condition (p < 0.01), and once
more, this eﬀect was maintained over time (Acarturk et al., 2016).
Similar to the study carried out by Acarturk et al. (2016), ter
Heide et al. (2016) examined the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy for
refugees diagnosed with PTSD (ter Heide et al., 2016). However,
results were not as promising for the use of EMDR therapy in
comparison. Over all of the reported primary and secondary
outcomes, ter Heide et al. (2016) only reported signiﬁcant
improvement of trauma symptoms for both EMDR therapy and
the stabilization control group (p < 0.05; p < 0.05), with no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences being reported between these conditions
(ter Heide et al., 2016).

All four RCTs also considered the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy
on symptoms of depression (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto
et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016), and
three of these also considered its eﬃcacy on symptoms of
anxiety (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016; ter Heide
et al., 2016). Carletto et al. (2016) identiﬁed that both EMDR
therapy and relaxation therapy signiﬁcantly improved anxiety
symptoms (p < 0.001), depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and
mood (p < 0.001), although there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between treatment eﬃcacy (Carletto et al., 2016). EMDR therapy
was also determined as being eﬀective in reducing symptoms
of depression and anxiety in the study carried out by Acarturk
et al. (2016) (Acarturk et al., 2016). The study reported a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between EMDR therapy intervention group
and a waiting-list control group for the symptoms of depression
(p < 0.01) and anxiety (p < 0.01), with both eﬀects being
maintained over time.

Although de Bont et al. (2016) utilized EMDR therapy as a
treatment for individuals diagnosed with PTSD, the RCT did
not report PTSD symptoms as an outcome measure (de Bont
et al., 2016). Instead, de Bont et al. (2016) looked at the eﬀect of
EMDR therapy on symptoms of psychosis, depression and social
functioning. The results presented by de Bont et al. (2016) are less
favorable for the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy than other studies.
The study reported prolonged exposure as being signiﬁcantly
more eﬀective in reducing symptoms of depression than EMDR
therapy (de Bont et al., 2016). The study showed that depressive
symptoms for those in the prolonged exposure intervention, were
signiﬁcantly reduced compared to participants in a waiting-list
control group at all follow-up points, and to EMDR therapy
(p < 0.05) at both 6 month follow-up and over time (de
Bont et al., 2016). Similarly, ter Heide et al. (2016) did not
report statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences for symptoms of either
depression or anxiety either over time, or between EMDR therapy
and the stabilization control group (ter Heide et al., 2016).

(p < 0.05) and over

Other outcome measures were also considered within
these RCTs; paranoid thoughts (de Bont et al., 2016), social
functioning (de Bont et al., 2016), functional assessment (Carletto
et al., 2016), fatigue (Carletto et al., 2016), and quality of
life (ter Heide et al., 2016). In addition to symptoms of
depression, de Bont et al.’s (2016) main outcome measures
were symptoms of psychosis and social
functioning. This
study demonstrated the impact of prolonged therapy exposure
and EMDR therapy in reducing psychotic symptoms over
the waiting list control condition (de Bont et al., 2016).
EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly reduced paranoid thoughts post-
time (p < 0.05), but
treatment
interestingly not at 6-month follow up. Prolonged exposure
was also signiﬁcantly more eﬀective in reducing paranoid
thoughts compared to waiting list controls (p < 0.05) at
all follow-up points. Neither EMDR therapy nor prolonged
exposure signiﬁcantly impacted auditory hallucinations or
personal social performance compared to waiting list control
group (de Bont et al., 2016). Carletto et al. (2016) also
assessed the impact of EMDR therapy, and relaxation therapy,
on functional assessment (p = 0.001) and fatigue severity
(p = 0.029). Although both EMDR therapy and relaxation
therapy were eﬀective in improving these symptoms, there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between reported between
treatment groups (Carletto et al., 2016).
ter Heide et al.
(2016) examined quality of life, however, like other ﬁndings
from this study, there were no signiﬁcant outcomes for the
eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy, or for eﬀects between the EMDR
therapy intervention group, and the stabilization control group
(ter Heide et al., 2016).

Summary Search 2
Four RCTs have been published between 2014 and 2017
examining the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy for individuals
diagnosed with PTSD (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al.,
2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016). EMDR
therapy was reported as signiﬁcantly improving PTSD diagnosis
and PTSD symptoms, over time, compared to relaxation
therapy and a waiting-list control group (Acarturk et al., 2016;

Wilson et al.

Using EMDR to Treat PTSD

Carletto et al., 2016). EMDR therapy was also reported as
signiﬁcantly improving trauma symptoms (ter Heide et al.,
2016).
All

four RCTs also measured symptoms of depression
and anxiety. EMDR therapy was reported as signiﬁcantly
reducing both depression and anxiety (Acarturk et al., 2016;
Carletto et al., 2016). This eﬀect was signiﬁcant compared
to control group (Acarturk et al., 2016) but
there were
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences reported between EMDR therapy
and relation therapy in reducing these symptoms (Carletto
et al., 2016). Contradictory to this, one study did not
report any diﬀerences in depression or anxiety symptoms
between EMDR therapy and stabilization control group (ter
Heide et al., 2016), and one study reported prolonged
exposure as being signiﬁcantly more eﬀective in reducing
symptoms of depression than EMDR therapy and waiting-
list control group at post-test and over time (de Bont et al.,
2016).

Finally, EMDR therapy and prolonged exposure therapies
were reported as being an eﬀective therapy to improve paranoid
thoughts both at post-treatment assessment and over time (de
Bont et al., 2016), but had not impact on auditory hallucinations
or personal social performance compared to a waiting-list control
group. Both EMDR therapy and relaxation therapy signiﬁcantly
improved functional assessment and fatigue severity (Carletto
et al., 2016), however EMDR therapy was not eﬀective in
improving quality of life compared to a control stabilization
group (ter Heide et al., 2016).

Study limitations were present. Similar to the meta-analyses
reviewed,
there was a lack of homogeneity across study
design, intervention, control, outcome measures, and follow-up
procedures. This makes it diﬃcult to synthesize ﬁndings across
studies, and reduces the impact of conclusions derived from the
evidence. Furthermore, only one of the four studies reported
power analyses which reduces the impact of the ﬁndings. Finally,
only two of the four studies followed up at 6 months, therefore
restricting the evidence of impact over time.

DISCUSSION

2014),

recommended by

EMDR therapy is an empirically validated form of Psychotherapy
(Shapiro,
the World Health
Organization to treat
trauma (World Health Organisation,
2013). Meta-analysis and RCT data within this review evidence
the eﬃcacy of EMDR therapy in primarily treating symptoms of
PTSD, depression and anxiety. Studies covered a wide range of
counties including East and West aﬃrming the eﬀective delivery
of EMDR therapy to diﬀering cultures (Acarturk et al., 2016;
Carletto et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016).
EMDR therapy signiﬁcantly improved PTSD diagnosis (Carletto
et al., 2016), and signiﬁcantly reduced symptoms of PTSD (Chen
et al., 2014, 2015; Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016), and
other trauma symptoms (ter Heide et al., 2016). Speciﬁcally, this
review also evidenced EMDR therapy as signiﬁcantly reducing
symptoms of depression (Chen et al., 2014; Acarturk et al.,
2016; Carletto et al., 2016), anxiety (Chen et al., 2014; Acarturk

et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016), subjective distress (Chen
et al., 2014), paranoid thoughts (de Bont et al., 2016), functional
assessment (Carletto et al., 2016), and severe fatigue (Carletto
et al., 2016). Despite the variations in methodology and analysis,
the meta-analyses found EMDR therapy more eﬀective than
comparative interventions and control groups (Chen et al.,
2014), resulting in PTSD below clinically signiﬁcant levels.
EMDR therapy was, however, more eﬀective when delivered
by more experienced therapists (Chen et al., 2015) and when
sessions lasted more than 60 min (Chen et al., 2014). Overall,
EMDR therapy was eﬀective with a range of presenting problems
and symptoms (Acarturk et al., 2016; Carletto et al., 2016; de
Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al., 2016). Low drop-out rates
across all studies indicates EMDR therapy is well tolerated
by clients,
including in comparison to prolonged exposure
(Ironson et al., 2002; Evans, 2003; Bisson and Andrew, 2013;
World Health Organisation, 2013; Shapiro, 2014; Acarturk et al.,
2016; Carletto et al., 2016; de Bont et al., 2016; ter Heide et al.,
2016). There were methodological limitations of the studies,
which compromises the quality of data examined in this review.
Initially, many of the RCT studies were low-powered due to
small sample sizes used. Furthermore, studies reported limited
follow-up data, and follow-up data that was reported was often
diﬀered between studies, limiting evidence of long-term eﬃcacy.
These limitations have been reported in other meta-analytic
evidence examining PTSD therapies more widely, and it was
acknowledged that these issues similarly hindered conclusions
derived from the synthesized evidence (Bisson and Andrew,
2013).

Another limitation of the evidence to date is the lack of
homogeneity between RCT evidence, due to the inconsistencies
in study design, intervention characteristics, sample, outcome
measures and follow-up procedures in each study. This lack of
homogeneity limits comparability between data, and ultimately
impacts conclusions. Furthermore, none of the retrieved studies
reported economic factors of EMDR therapy, and this is
seldom reported in wider EMDR therapy literature. It
is
acknowledged that EMDR therapy can reduce healthcare costs,
whilst maintaining patient care, due to substantial patient
improvement in relatively short time periods (Shapiro, 2014).
However, evidence is required to examine these economic
factors, speciﬁcally in comparison to similar therapies such
as CBT.

Search Limitations
A strength of the review is that all papers were reviewed using the
Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools for systematic
reviews or RCTs, and studies were not included if they did not
meet CASP criterion. It is also acknowledged that this review is
limited to RCT evidence speciﬁcally of adults receiving EMDR
therapy, a speciﬁc population with deﬁnite characteristics, and
therefore ﬁndings cannot be more widely generalized. There
were some limitations to the ﬁrst literature search. Only meta-

the reﬁnement of the search strategy, which initially included
syntheses of multiple forms of therapy. However, by including

evidence looking at multiple forms of therapy, some syntheses
included only one or two studies investigating EMDR therapy,
and often did not speciﬁcally analyse the eﬃcacy of EMDR
therapy as a stand-alone treatment. Therefore, limited evidence
could be retrieved from these papers, and a decision was made
to only examine papers directly investigating the eﬃcacy of
EMDR therapy. The second systematic search examined RCT
evidence only as RCT evidence is considered gold standard
evidence for the eﬃcacy of healthcare interventions (Evans,
2003), and alternative evidence was therefore excluded from this
report.

CONCLUSION

the global burden of psychological

As
trauma continues
unabated, the need for more research and investigation into
treatment interventions that are both eﬀective and eﬃcient is
essential. It is clear from this extensive, robust evidence that
EMDR therapy is an eﬀective treatment to improve diagnosis of
PTSD, and reduce symptoms of PTSD, and other trauma-related
symptoms. More RCT evidence is required to further enhance
our collective understanding of PTSD and co-morbid symptoms.

Recommendations for Practice
EMDR therapy should be available for adults who present
with PTSD and co-morbid symptoms including depression and
anxiety and EMDR therapy can be delivered eﬀectively within the
countries identiﬁed within this study.

Recommendations for Future Research
Further RCTs of EMDR therapy with larger sample sizes are
required with a wide range of presenting mental health problems.
Additional research examining the diﬀerences between adult
and child PTSD to ascertain which psychological treatment
approaches for children and adolescents are more eﬀective
and eﬃcient, as current evidence is weak. However emerging
Practice-Based Evidence increasingly supports the utilization of
Group Trauma Treatment Interventions (Jarero et al., 2013).
• More standardization of the normative outcome measures is

required to facilitate comparison across studies.

• Studies need to include longitudinal evaluation beyond 6

months.

• Analysis is required of the economic beneﬁts of EMDR therapy
in comparison with other trauma-focused interventions.
• Comparative studies are needed of the eﬃcacy of EMDR

therapy across cultures.
