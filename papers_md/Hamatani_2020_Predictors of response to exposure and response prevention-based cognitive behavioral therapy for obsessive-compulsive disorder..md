Abstract

Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which includes exposure and response prevention (ERP), is
effective in improving symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, whether poor cognitive
functions and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits affect the therapeutic response of patients with OCD to ERP-
based CBT remains unclear. This study aimed to identify factors predictive of the therapeutic response of Japanese
patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT.

Methods: Forty-two Japanese outpatients with OCD were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III
(WAIS-III), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, and Autism Spectrum
Quotient (AQ) at pre- and post-treatment. We used multiple regression analyses to estimate the effect on
therapeutic response change. The treatment response change was set as a dependent variable in multiple
regression analyses.
Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that among independent variables, communication as an AQ sub-
scale and Letter Number Sequencing as a WAIS-III sub-test predict the therapeutic response to ERP-based CBT .

Conclusions: Our results suggest that diminished working memory (Letter Number Sequencing), poor
communication skill (AQ sub-scale) may undermine responsiveness to ERP-based CBT among patients with OCD.

Background
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric
disorder characterized by repeated compulsive and ob-
sessive behavior, and its 12-month prevalence in the
world is 1.1 to 1.8% (DSM-5) [1]. NICE guidelines rec-
ommend the use of CBT including exposure response
prevention (ERP) as a first-line of treatment for OCD, and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or more in-
tensive CBT including ERP or combined treatment (CBT
including ERP plus SSRI) for moderate to severe OCD [2].
With a treatment response change of approximately 45 to
70% [2, 3], the efficacy of the CBT including ERP has been
demonstrated [4–7]. However, about 20% of OCD don’t
have good enough response to ERP [3]. Numerous studies
have been conducted on cognitive functions of individuals
to account for their lack of response to CBT including
ERP [8–11]. Neuropsychological functioning has so far
been studied as a predictor of the responsiveness of pa-
tients with OCD to CBT including ERP, but the results
are inconsistent [8–11]. Predictor variables of CBT includ-
ing ERP for OCD can be classified into various categories
[12]: demographic variables; OCD symptom characteris-
tics such as severity; comorbidities and associated symp-
tom severity; cognitive influences; motivational
factors
such as treatment expectations; treatment factors such as
compliance and therapeutic alliance; biological
factors;
other factors such as personality, family dysfunction, and
treatment-specific characteristic [12, 13].

Previous studies have suggested that responses to CBT
including ERP are diminished among patients whose
symptoms overlap with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
criteria [14, 15]; treatment resistance may thus be attrib-
utable the presentation of ASD characteristics. More-
over, severe major depressive disorder has been shown
to inhibit therapeutic response to CBT including ERP
[12]. It has also been suggested that the severity of
obsessive-compulsive symptoms and beliefs may influ-
ence the response to CBT including ERP treatment [16].
Conversely, several previous studies have reported that
comorbidities such as depression and anxiety do not
affect treatment responsiveness to CBT including ERP
[17–19]. Therefore, the results are inconsistent [12–19],
and further research is needed to identify predictors of
response to CBT including ERP.

Furthermore, no studies have examined the factors
that affect treatment effects including the full-version of
the WAIS for patients with OCD. Specifying people that
need an adapted treatment strategy is very important,
and it is necessary to specify predictors of treatment re-
sponse. Here, the present study aimed to elucidate fac-
tors related to therapeutic responses to ERP-based CBT,
focusing on ASD propensity, cognitive function, OCD
severity, and depression severity.

Methods
Study design
The present study was included patients who visited the
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Center of Chiba Univer-
sity between March 2013 to May 2018; it included 106
patients who were diagnosed with OCD by a psychiatrist
using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis
I Disorders [20]. At the time of the visit to our center,
the patient was already diagnosed with OCD at another
institution, and he/she brought a referral
letter. The
diagnosis and evaluation were performed by a well-
educated psychiatrist and clinical psychologist at the
IAPT of Chiba University. The exclusion criteria were
any organic central nervous system disorder, psychosis,
intellectual disability, high risk of suicide, substance
abuse or dependence, or unstable medical condition; pa-
tients for whom cognitive function could not be measured
in terms of outcomes and those who did not complete the
ERP intervention were also excluded. A total of 64 pa-
tients were therefore excluded, so that eventually 42 pa-
tients (mean age = 33.2 years, standard deviation =7.6
years, female = 26, male = 16) with OCD were included in
the analysis (Fig. 1). Moreover, none of the participants
were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity dis-
order. Nine patients were pharmacotherapy-free, and 33
patients were taking psychotropic drugs at the time of as-
sessment [29 patients (SSRI), 2 patients (Noradrenergic
and specific serotonergic antidepressant), 5 patients (Tri-
cyclic antidepressant), 17 patients (Benzodiazepine), 6 pa-
tients (Dopamine system stabilizer), 2 patients (Dopamine
serotonin antagonist), 1 patient
(Serotonin-dopamine
antagonist), 3 patients (Multi-acting receptor targeted
antipsychotic), 2 patients (Benzamide antipsychotics), 2
patients (Branched fatty acid), and 1 patient (Butyrophe-
none)](See supplemental material).

Intervention
ERP-based CBT was performed on patients with OCD
according to a treatment manual created by our research
group designed for adult outpatients with OCD(https://
www.mhlw.go.jp/file/06-Seisakujouhou-12200000-Sha-
kaiengokyokushougaihokenfukushibu/0000113840.pdf).
The modules were derived from a previous study on in-
person ERP for OCD in Japan [7]; these modules in-
cluded psychoeducation, exposure exercises, and home-
work assignments [7]. Sixteen ERP-based CBT sessions
of 50 min in length were scheduled each week. All thera-
pists who participated in this study completed the Im-
proving Access to Psychological Therapies project at
Chiba University [21]. The quality of ERP-based CBT
was controlled through weekly group supervisions led by
a psychiatrist. It was recommended that the therapist
should record the content of the session using videog-
raphy and an integrated chip (IC) recorder. However, it

was possible for the patient to refuse to consent to this
recording.

Outcomes
Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale
To assess the severity of the obsessive-compulsive symp-
toms, we used the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (Y-BOCS) [22, 23]. This scale consists of 10 items
(5 obsessions and 5 compulsive items). The question-
naire items are scored on a 4-point Likert-scale; with
0 = no symptoms to 4 = extreme symptoms. The total
score range is 0–40, with individual subtotals for obses-
sions and severity of obsessions. This scale was used in a
semi-structured interview setting.

Obsessive-compulsive inventory
The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI) consists of
42 items and is a 5-point Likert-scale [24, 25]. It consists
of seven subscales (washing, checking, doubting, order-
ing, obsessions, hoarding, and neutralizing).

Patient health Questionnaire-9
The presence and severity of symptoms of depression
experienced in the previous 2 weeks were evaluated
using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [26,
27]. The self-administered questionnaire items are
scored on a 4-point Likert-scale; with 0 = not at all to
3 = almost every day. The total score range is 0–27 (0 to
4 indicates no symptoms, 5 to 9 indicates mild symp-
toms, 10 to 14 indicates moderate symptoms, 15 to 19
indicates moderate to severe symptoms, and 20 to 27 in-
dicates severe symptoms). The cut-off score for clinically
significant symptoms of depression is 10.

Generalized anxiety disorder − 7 (GAD-7)
The presence and severity of generalized anxiety dis-
order was assessed using the GAD-7 [28, 29], a self-
administered questionnaire that assesses the severity of
generalized anxiety disorder in the previous 2 weeks on
a 4-point Likert scale; with 0 = not at all to 3 = almost
every day. The total score range is 0–21 (0 to 4 indicates
no symptoms, 5 to 9 indicates mild symptoms, 10 to 14
indicates moderate symptoms, and 15 to 21 indicates se-
vere symptoms). The cut-off score for clinically signifi-
cant symptoms of anxiety is 10.

Autism-spectrum quotient
Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-managed in-
strument that can use any of the dichotomous evalua-
tions to measure autistic characteristics [30, 31]. The
total score range is 0–50. It consists of five subscales
(social skills, attention switching, attention to detail,
communication, and imagination). The cut-off score for
clinically significant symptoms of ASD is 33.

Wechsler adult intelligence scale-third edition
The Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-third edition
(WAIS-III) is a comprehensive test of intellectual func-
tioning [32, 33]. A total of 13 subtests assessing either
verbal IQ (VIQ) or performance IQ (PIQ) were adminis-
tered to patients with OCD. The subtests evaluating
VIQ included Vocabulary, Similarities,
Information,
Comprehension, Arithmetic, Digit Span, and Letter-
Number Sequencing; those assessing PIQ included Pic-
ture Completion, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, Vis-
ual Puzzles, Digit Symbol Coding, and Symbol Search.
The Object Assembly subtest was excluded from the
present analysis because it has a lower confidence factor

Hamatani et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:433 

Page 4 of 8

than the other subtests [34]. The aforementioned subtests
were grouped into the following four indices: VCI (Vo-
cabulary, Similarities, and Information), POI
(Picture
Completion, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning), WMI
(Digit Span and Arithmetic, and Letter-Number Sequen-
cing), and PSI (Symbol Search and Digit Symbol Coding).

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statis-
tics, version 26.00 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). To
investigate the predictive effects that patient pretreat-
ment background may have had on the treatment re-
sponse change post treatment, a series of analyses were
performed. First, the treatment response change was ob-
tained in terms of the difference between pre- and post-
treatment Y-BOCS scores. Next, Pearson correlation co-
efficients were used to investigate the factors affecting
the ERP-based CBT response change and to explore the
relationships between such changes and other clinical
variables
severity of obsessive-
sex,
compulsive symptoms in Y-BOCS at pretreatment, the
traits associated with the autistic spectrum in AQ total
scores or its sub-scales, intelligence index in WAIS-III
or its sub-tests, OCI total score or its sub-scales, and se-
verity of depression in PHQ-9. Finally, forward stepwise
regression analysis was performed with the variables that
remained significant in the correlation analysis as inde-
pendent variables and the ERP-based CBT response
change as the dependent variable. Moreover, the un-
paired t-test was used to compare the ERP-based CBT
plus pharmacotherapy group and ERP-based CBT with-
out pharmacotherapy group, to investigate the effects of
medication.

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics and WAIS
scores of patients with OCD are shown in Table 1. The
correlations between the ERP-based CBT response
change and other clinical variables in OCD group are
presented in Table 2. Significant differences in the ERP-
based CBT response change were observed according to
sex (p = 0.017), Attention switching (p = 0.029), Commu-
nication (p = 0.026), and Letter Number Sequencing
(p = 0.005). No significant correlation was found between
the ERP-based CBT response change and any other clin-
ical variable. Multiple regression analysis was performed
with sex, communication, attention switching, and Letter
Number Sequencing as explanatory variables and the
ERP-based CBT response change as the dependent vari-
able. Multiple regression analyses showed that commu-
nication as an AQ sub-scale and Letter Number
Sequencing as a WAIS-III sub-test were significant pre-
dictors of ERP-based CBT response, if sex and attention
switching were excluded for a better fit (Table 3). To

investigate the effects of medication, the comparison of
the treatment response of
the ERP-based CBT plus
pharmacotherapy group and ERP-based CBT without
pharmacotherapy group did not reveal any significant
differences (t (40) =0.876, p < 0.386).

Discussion
The present study investigated whether clinical symp-
toms and cognitive functions are predictive of differen-
tial
therapeutic response to ERP-based CBT among
patients with OCD. We found that the ERP-based CBT
response change was affected by diminished working
memory as a Letter Number Sequencing and poor com-
munication skill as an AQ subscale in Japanese partici-
pants with OCD.

A retrospective study of randomized control

trials
assessing 108 obsessive-compulsive patients receiving se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reported that co-
morbidity affected treatment response [35]. Our results
were not consistent with those of a previous study [35].
The results of the present study suggest that depressive
mood severity was excluded, but that partial ASD pro-
pensity impairs treatment response. A previous review
has suggested that CBT including ERP for obsessive-
compulsive disorder with ASD is effective [36], but that
the response to CBT including ERP is relatively poor
[15]. The novelty of this study was that the ability to
communicate in AQ predicted treatment response.
it is difficult to set
Without good communication,
appropriate therapeutic goals and exposure tasks.
Therefore, it is natural that communication disorder,
one of the core disorders in ASD [1], impairs treat-
ment response.

The results of this study did not suggest that OCI’s
sub-tests predict of response to ERP-based CBT. A sub-
type of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
the hoarding
state, was reported to reduce patient outcomes due to
adherence [37]. Additionally, a previous study showed
that reductions in obsessive beliefs influenced improve-
ments in patients with OCD [38], which are inconsistent
with the results of the present study. Previous studies
suggested that patient consensus on therapeutic goals
and tasks is probably also an important factor in imple-
menting CBT including ERP [39, 40]. The present study
did not measure patients’ adherence to ERP-based CBT
or the degree of agreement on treatment. Future re-
search should consider these as well. A previous repre-
sentative study suggested that maleness was predictive of
better treatment outcomes [41]. However, our results
show that sex was not a predictor of the response to
ERP-based CBT, and are consistent with some previous
studies for children to adults [18, 42–44].

cortex,

working memory [45], the results of the present study
suggested that a subtest of working memory, “Letter
Number Sequencing,” predicts treatment response. This
suggests that the executive function, including working
memory, of obsessive-compulsive patients undergoing
ERP-based CBT may predict responsiveness. When pa-
tients with OCD have poor executive function, they
might cannot understand their problem or conduct and
complete ERP tasks appropriately. A previous brain im-
aging study showed that abnormalities in the left dorso-
region that has been
lateral prefrontal
implicated in working memory [46], negatively affect
CBT including ERP outcomes [15]. Mental flexibility, as
measured using the California Verbal Learning Test, was
predictive of a good response to CBT including ERP; in
contrast, it was interesting to note that fluoxetine re-
sponsiveness was impaired [9]. Executive function weak-
ness is also known to affect treatment response [9, 47–
49]. The present study, for the first time in the world,
has found that a WAIS-III full-version subtest, Letter
Number Sequencing, predicts the response of ERP-based
CBT treatment in patients with OCD. In other words,
supplementing poor working memory may be beneficial
for treatment and results of this study may be helpful to
clinicians and cognitive behavioral practitioners choose
more effective treatment strategy. In one example, to
promote better responsiveness among patients with poor
working memory, clinicians can provide more sessions
and use visual aids during interventions [50]. Letter
Number Sequencing is a simple test that can be per-
formed in about 5 to 10 min. Therefore, clinicians and
cognitive behavioral practitioners may be able to esti-
mate response to treatment based on the results of
WAIS-III Letter Number Sequencing and AQ communi-
cation score before conducting ERP-based CBT in pa-
tients with OCD.

This study had several

limitations. First, while our
findings implicate ASD traits as a risk factor affecting
the treatment response change, cohort studies for chil-
dren and early adolescents have shown that OCD is pre-
dicted by beliefs such as intolerance to uncertainty [51].
Since patients with ASD are characterized by intolerance
to uncertainty, it remains unclear whether ASD traits it-
is a risk factor or whether the intolerance to
self

uncertainty accounts for the lower responsiveness to
ERP-based CBT. To clarify this point, it will be necessary
to also use the Obsessive Belief Questionnaire in future
investigations. Second, in this study, we found that the

**p < 0.01

response of ERP-based CBT was not good when the AQ
communication score was high. However, AQ is a self-
administered scale, and it is unclear whether this accur-
ately reflects the communication ability. Therefore, it is
necessary to measure the quality of communication ob-
jectively by behavioral observation, and not by using a
self-reported scale. In the future, a more detailed assess-
ment, including the Second Edition of the Autism Diag-
nosis and Observation Schedule, will be needed to
identify ASD [52]. Third, the effects of the participants’
medication were not included, because their administra-
tion might have changed according to their condition
during ERP-based CBT, though we asked the physicians
to maintain the medication content and dose constant
as much as possible. Research that regulates the content
of pharmacotherapy should be conducted in the future.

Fourth, Y-BOCS evaluations were conducted by thera-
pists who were in charge of the patients. Therefore, in-
dependent assessors would be needed to evaluate the
primary outcomes,
including Y-BOCS. Finally, we did
not include patients who did not consent to ERP-based
CBT in this study, because we could not obtain their
post-treatment score (if they did not receive ERP-based
CBT) or the reason for refusal.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that diminished working memory
(Letter Number Sequencing), and poor communication
skill (AQ sub-scale) score may undermine responsive-
ness to ERP-based CBT among patients with OCD. The
corresponding predictors (working memory, communi-
cation skill) of response to ERP-based CBT explain 33%
of the responsiveness to ERP-based CBT among patients
with OCD. To validate our findings and overcome the
limitations of this study, future research should also con-
sider the intolerance to uncertainty and the quality of
ERP-based CBT.
