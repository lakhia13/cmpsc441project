A look into telepsychology in the Philippines: 
an exploratory-cross-sectional research
Jason Clark Perez1* 

Abstract 
The debate surrounding telepsychology and its integration into professional practice remains a critical issue. 
This study explores telepsychology in the Philippines, focusing on its acceptance, appropriateness, and feasibil-
ity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing an exploratory cross-sectional research design, data were collected 
through an online survey using purposive sampling. Results indicate that Filipinos generally perceive telepsychology 
as acceptable, suitable, and feasible under pandemic conditions. This aligns with studies emphasizing telepsychol-
ogy’s potential to enhance accessibility and address geographic barriers. The findings contribute to the growing body 
of evidence supporting telepsychology as a viable mental health intervention.

Keywords  Telepsychology, Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, Pandemic, COVID-19, Future of Telepsychology

Background
The  development  of  telepsychology  has  accelerated  in 
response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  emphasizing  the 
need for alternative mental health service delivery meth-
ods. Historically, telepsychology emerged as an extension 
of  communication  innovations  such  as  telephone  coun-
seling and email-based interventions [11]; [14]. Research 
highlights  its  potential  to  enhance  accessibility,  address 
logistical challenges, and reduce barriers to mental health 
care [5]; [15]. However, its effectiveness compared to tra-
ditional in-person therapy remains debated [13].

While several studies affirm the efficacy of telepsychol-
ogy  [3];  [18],  challenges  persist.  These  include  difficul-
ties  in  building  therapeutic  rapport  due  to  the  absence 
of  non-verbal  cues,  privacy  concerns,  and  the  need  for 
specialized training among professionals [4]; [19]. More-
over,  younger  populations  face  additional  barriers  such 
as  stigma  and  uncertainty  about  seeking  virtual  mental 
health  services  [10].  In  the  Philippines,  telepsychology’s

adoption must account for cultural preferences for face-
to-face  interactions  and  the  geographic  dispersion  of 
mental health resources, which underscores its potential 
to fill critical service gaps [7].

Methods
Research design

An  exploratory  cross-sectional  research  design  was 
employed  to  examine  the  relationships  between  demo-
graphic  factors  and  perceptions  of  telepsychology.  This 
approach enabled the analysis of naturally occurring data 
groups, consistent with Johnson [12].

Setting, participants and sampling technique

The  study  targeted  Filipino  residents,  including  psychol-
ogy students, graduates, and the general population who 
could  benefit  from  telepsychology.  Participants  were 
recruited  through  social  media  and  professional  net-
works, employing purposive sampling to ensure relevance 
to  the  research  objectives.  This  demographic  diversity 
provided  insights  into  the  acceptability,  appropriateness, 
and feasibility of telepsychology during the pandemic.

Data gathering tools

Data  were  gathered  using  three  validated  scales:  the 
Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention 
Appropriateness  Measure  (IAM),  and  Feasibility  of  Inter-
vention Measure (FIM) [17]. These tools, with high reliabil-
ity (Cronbach’s alpha: AIM = 0.85, IAM = 0.91, FIM = 0.89), 
were  designed  to  evaluate  perceptions  of  telepsychology’s 
practicality and relevance in the Philippine context.

Data gathering procedures

The survey, hosted on Google Forms, included informed 
consent,  terminology  explanations,  and  researcher  con-
tact  information.  After  data  collection,  responses  were 
encoded  in  Microsoft  Excel,  with  outliers  removed  to 
improve  data  accuracy.  Statistical  analyses,  including 
descriptive  statistics  and  main  effects  ANOVA,  were 
conducted using Statistica to explore demographic influ-
ences on telepsychology perceptions.

Data analysis

The data was first analyzed with descriptive statistics in a 
table form to display multiple demographics provided by 
the participants. The participants were described accord-
ing to their gender (male or female), age (young adult or 
adult) and occupation (general population or psychology 
affiliate).  The  researcher  also  provides  a  table  depicting 
the means for each variable, as well as the mean per ques-
tion on each of the instruments used and tally the scores 
to prove a total mean for each instrument. This will indi-
cate a general view for the answers of the participants on 
whether  they  accept  telepsychology,  deem  telepsychol-
ogy  appropriate,  and  view  telepsychology  as  a  feasible 
intervention. Main effects ANOVA is also utilized by the 
researcher  to  assess  if  the  demographics  influence  the 
dependent variable.

Ethical considerations

The  researcher  emphasizes  adherence  to  ethical  consid-
erations throughout the study, focusing on informed con-
sent,  beneficence,  and  anonymity  to  ensure  participant 
well-being  and  ethical  research  practices.  The  ethical 
principle informed consent ensures that participants will-
ingly agree to participate based on a clear understanding 
of the study’s purpose [2]. The researcher will explain the 
study in simple terms, answer any questions, and ensure 
participants  know  they  can  withdraw  at  any  time.  The 
ethical principle beneficence emphasizes the importance 
of  conducting  research  that  is  beneficial  and  causes  no 
harm  [8].  The  researcher  must  clearly  communicate  the 
study’s goals and intentions to participants, who are inte-
gral  to  the  research  process  [1].  Lastly,  respecting  ano-
nymity  means  participants’  responses  are  not  linked  to 
their identities, which is crucial for protecting their rights 

[9].  The  researcher  is  responsible  for  informing  par-
ticipants  about  their  rights  and  maintaining  anonymity 
through codes, numbers, or pseudonyms.
The main ethical standards include:

1.  Anonymity: Participants’ identities are protected.
2.  Dignity  and  Well-Being:  The  well-being  of  partici-

pants is prioritized.

3.  Informed  Consent  Process:  Participants  must  sign  a 
consent  form  before  data  collection,  ensuring  they 
understand the research.

4.  Confidentiality: All data and personal results are kept 
confidential, with no real names used in transcripts.

Results
Table  1  describes  the  demographics  of  the  participants 
gathered; this includes the gender, age and occupation of 
the participants (see Table 1).

Acceptability of intervention measure (Table 2)

Intervention appropriateness measure (Table 3)

Feasibility of intervention measure (Tables 4 and 5)

Based  on  the  results  of  the  main  effects  ANOVA  (see 
Table 5), there are no significant demographic variable that 
influences Telepsychology. The results show that Filipinos 
and their demographics play no role in their views.

Discussion
This  study  contributes  to  the  growing  evidence  base 
supporting  telepsychology  as  a  viable  intervention  in 
the  Philippine  context.  Findings  indicate  a  positive

perception  of  telepsychology’s  acceptability,  appro-
priateness,  and  feasibility,  consistent  with  previous 
research  [4].  These  results  emphasize  telepsychology’s 
potential  to  address  geographic  and  logistical  barriers 
to mental health care delivery [7], [15].

However,  the  study’s  findings  diverge  from  those 
of  Lazuras  &  Dokou  [13],  who  reported  gender-based 

differences,  with  women  perceiving  telepsychology 
more favorably. Gatti et al. [10] similarly noted genera-
tional  disparities,  with  younger  individuals  displaying 
greater  openness  to  virtual  interventions  due  to  their 
familiarity  with  technology.  These  discrepancies  high-
light  the  influence  of  sociocultural  factors  on  telepsy-
chology’s reception.

While  this  study  found  no  significant  demographic 
effects,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  underscored  the 
urgency  of  adopting  telepsychology  to  sustain  mental 
health  services  during  crises.  Brooks  et  al.  [6]  empha-
sized  the  psychological  toll  of  quarantine  measures, 
including increased stress and emotional disturbances, 
further validating telepsychology’s relevance. The find-
ings  also  support  Wind  et  al.  [18],  who  advocated  for 
e-health  solutions  as  transformative  tools  for  mental 
health care.

Despite its promise, telepsychology faces limitations, 
including challenges in establishing therapeutic rapport 
due  to  the  absence  of  non-verbal  communication  cues 
[19]. Addressing these barriers requires targeted train-
ing  and  resource  allocation  to  build  competency  and 
confidence among mental health professionals [4].

Future research should adopt longitudinal designs to 
evaluate  the  sustainability  of  telepsychology’s  accept-
ability  and  effectiveness  over  time.  A  qualitative 
approach  focusing  on  psychology  professionals  could 
provide deeper insights into implementation challenges 
and opportunities for innovation.

As  digital  technology  continues  to  evolve,  telepsy-
chology  presents  an  opportunity  to  expand  access  to 
mental  health  services,  particularly  in  geographically 
dispersed  regions  like  the  Philippines.  The  findings 
affirm its potential as a practical and sustainable inter-
vention,  provided  that  ethical  considerations  and  cul-
tural sensitivities are addressed.

Declarations

Ethics approval and consent to participate
Although this research did not undergo a formal ethics review, the researcher 
diligently adhered to and implemented a comprehensive set of ethical 
considerations outlined within the study. As mentioned by the Philippine 
Health Research Ethics Board on page 48 of their National Ethical Guidelines 
For Research Involving Human Participants, provided that protocols do not 
involve more than minimal risks or harms, the following is considered by the 
REC for exemption from review protocols for institutional quality assurance 
purposes, evaluation of public service programs, public health surveillance, 
educational evaluation activities, and consumer acceptability tests, which fits 
the criteria of the research that utilized a “consumer acceptability test”. Further-
more, the Philippine Health Research Ethics Board deems that research that 
only includes interactions involving survey procedures, interview procedures, 
or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording), 
if the following criteria are met: There will be no disclosure of the human 
participants’ responses outside the research that could reasonably place 
the participants at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to `their 
financial standing, employability, or reputation; and The investigator records 
the information obtained in such a manner that the identity of the human 
participant cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked 
to the participant [16]. All of the points highlighted by the Philippine Health 
Research Ethics Board were diligently followed by the researcher.
All of the participants in this study were given an informed consent form and 
the participants gave their informed consent to participate in the study.

Consent for publication
Not Applicable.
