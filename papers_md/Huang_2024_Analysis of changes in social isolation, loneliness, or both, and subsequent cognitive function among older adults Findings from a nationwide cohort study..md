Abstract

INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate the associations of changes in social

isolation, loneliness, or both, with cognitive function.

METHODS: Data were from 7299 older adults in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy

Longevity Survey. We defined four change patterns (no, incident, transient, and per-

sistent) for social isolation and loneliness, and created nine-category variable to

represent the joint changes. Tobit regression models and Cox models were performed.

RESULTS: Incident, transient, and persistent social isolation or loneliness may accel-
erate cognitive decline (p < 0.05). Incident, transient, and persistent social isolation

were associated with higher cognitive impairment risk, while only persistent loneliness
was associated with higher cognitive impairment risk (p < 0.001). Notably, short-

term or persistent social isolation was associated with accelerated cognitive decline

and incident cognitive impairment, regardless of different loneliness change status
(p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION: Short-term or persistent social isolation and persistent loneliness may

be a salient risk factor for cognitive decline and cognitive impairment.

Highlights
∙ Incident, transient, and persistent social isolation were associated with accelerated

cognitive decline and higher cognitive impairment risk.

∙ Persistent loneliness was associated with accelerated cognitive decline and higher

cognitive impairment risk.

∙ Short-term or persistent social isolation with concurrent different loneliness change

status accelerated cognitive decline and higher cognitive impairment risk.

BACKGROUND

The prevalence of impoverished social relationships and its associ-

ated burden of disease pose a threat to healthy aging. According to

the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, impoverished social

relationships are considered a noteworthy modifiable risk factor for
poor cognitive health outcomes in later life.1 Impoverished social

relationships—defined as social isolation or loneliness—have received

considerable attention. Social isolation is defined as the objective

absence of social contact and a diminished social network, whereas

loneliness represents a subjective assessment of the degree to which
individuals find contentment in their social connections.2 Despite rich

evidence regarding the association of social isolation and/or loneli-

ness with cognitive health in older adults, the majority of previous

studies relied on a singular measurement of social isolation and lone-

liness at the baseline, which ignored the dynamic features of social

isolation and loneliness over time, potentially introducing the issue of
reverse causation.3–5 Capturing changes in social isolation and loneli-

ness, rather than solely assessing them at baseline, holds significance

as it reflects the associated risks individuals face when modifying their

social relationships in the real world, particularly from public health
standpoint.6,7

Several studies, primarily conducted in Western populations, have

explored the longitudinal association between change in loneliness and
cognitive function; however, the findings remain inconclusive.7–9 A lon-

gitudinal study in the United States reported that persistent loneliness,

but not transient loneliness, was strongly associated with acceler-
ated cognitive decline,7 which is similar to the findings for the risk
of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in another study.10

By contrast, a longitudinal study in the United States found that the
experience of loneliness at one-time point, two-time points, and ≥

three-time points were all associated with a faster rate of cognitive
decline compared to those who never experienced loneliness.8 Simi-

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review: We reviewed the literature using

traditional (e.g., PubMed and Web of Science) sources.

Several studies have explored the association between

change in loneliness and cognitive function; however, the

findings remain inconclusive. Few studies have explored

the association between change in objective evaluation of

impoverished social relationships, that is, social isolation,

and cognitive function. It is also worth noting that lim-

ited research has explored the associations between joint

changes in social isolation and loneliness with cognitive

health.

2.

Interpretation: We showed that incident, transient, or

persistent social isolation and persistent loneliness were

independently associated with accelerated cognitive

decline and higher cognitive impairment risk. Notably,

short-term or persistent social isolation with concur-

rent different loneliness change status were associated

with accelerated cognitive decline and higher cognitive

impairment risk among older adults.

3. Future directions: The mechanisms through which

changes in social isolation and loneliness, individually and

simultaneously, may affect memory function should be

investigated.

socially connected individuals may feel lonely, just as socially isolated

individuals may find satisfaction in their social relationships. Emerging

evidence also suggests that these two constructs may exert synergis-
tic effects on health.14,15 Hence, examining the concurrent changes

in social isolation and loneliness may further clarify the role of social

chronic loneliness was significantly associated with lower Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) scores.9 Due to inconsistent results among

guidelines for public health and clinical practice.

To fill the knowledge gap, using data from the Chinese Longitudinal

current studies, differences in socioeconomic levels, and cultural differ-
ences in loneliness,11 it remains unclear to what extent the association

pants with persistent social isolation, those with no, short-term, and

persistent loneliness had accelerated cognitive decline of 0.562 (95%

CI: 0.502 to 0.622), 0.346 (95% CI: 0.294 to 0.399), and 0.463 (95% CI:

0.390 to 0.536), respectively.

During the follow-up of 61,963 person-years, 1396 incident cogni-

tive impairment cases were reported. Table 3 shows the associations of

changes in social isolation and loneliness with the risk of incident cogni-

tive impairment. In the fully adjusted model (model 2), compared with
no social isolation, incident social isolation (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.24
to 1.83), transient social isolation (HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.68),
and persistent social isolation (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.41 to 1.96) were

associated with a higher risk of incident cognitive impairment. Com-

pared with no loneliness, persistent social isolation, but not incident or

transient loneliness, was associated with a higher risk of incident cog-
nitive impairment (HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.74). When changes

in social isolation and loneliness were added into the model simulta-

neously (model 3), the associations of changes in social isolation and

loneliness with the risk of incident cognitive impairment were generally

similar.

When changes in social isolation and loneliness were combined, the

associations between joint changes in social isolation and loneliness

and the risk of incident cognitive impairment are shown in Figure 2.

Specifically, compared with participants in the no social isolation and

loneliness category, those who experienced no social isolation but

persistent loneliness had higher risk of incident cognitive impairment
(HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.29 to 2.32). Participants who experienced short-

term or persistent social isolation were associated with a higher risk

of incident cognitive impairment, regardless of different loneliness

DISCUSSION

In this population-based cohort of Chinese older adults, we found

that incident, transient, and persistent social isolation or loneliness

may accelerate cognitive decline. Meanwhile, incident, transient, and

persistent social isolation were associated with a higher risk of incident

cognitive impairment, while only persistent loneliness was associated

with a higher risk of incident cognitive impairment. Notably, all

participants with short-term or persistent social isolation were asso-

ciated with accelerated cognitive decline and higher risk of incident

cognitive impairment, regardless of different loneliness change status.

on the joint changes in social isolation and loneliness. The
multivariate-adjusted model included the joint changes in social

CONCLUSIONS

This longitudinal study found that short-term or persistent social iso-

lation and persistent loneliness were independently associated with

accelerated cognitive decline and higher risk of cognitive impairment.

Notably, short-term or persistent social isolation with concurrent

different loneliness change status were associated with accelerated

cognitive decline and higher cognitive impairment risk. Hence, from

the perspective of public health, the disease burden of cognitive

impairment could be reduced through effective interventions aimed

at preventing or reducing social isolation and loneliness, especially

persistent social isolation and loneliness.
