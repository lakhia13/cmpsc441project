Gratitude is the expression of appreciation for what one has. It is a recognition of value independent of monetary worth. Spontaneously generated from within, it is an affirmation of goodness and warmth. This socialemotionstrengthens relationships, and its roots run deep in evolutionary history—emanating from the survival value of helping others and being helped in return. Studies show that specific areas of the brain are involved in experiencing and expressing gratitude. Brain scans of people assigned a task that stimulates expression of gratitude show lasting changes in the prefrontal cortex that heighten sensitivity to future experiences of gratitude.

In fact, the cultivation of gratitude may be at least a partial remedy for narcissism.

Just being around your family and friends can help youfeel more grateful. Also, being more appreciative of life and feeling less cynical pushes you in a more thankful frame of mind.

This depends on the person, and we all differ in the degree to which we are inclined toexperience and express gratitude. It can be something as simple as a healthy spring shower, just because the rain washes everything clean. Engaging in a more specific act, such as volunteering to help others, makes people feel good about themselves.

Gratitude is a social emotion and theexpression of gratitudetoward others compounds its benefits. The emotion literally pays itself forward. And it almost does not matter whether the gratitude is communicated or reciprocated by others.
