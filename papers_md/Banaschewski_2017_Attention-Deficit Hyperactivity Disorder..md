Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 

A Current Overview

A ttention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD; 

according  to  the  DSM-5)  (1)  and  hyperkinetic 
disorder (HKD; according to the ICD-10) (2) describe a 
childhood-onset  developmental  disturbance 
that 
 persists  for  at  least  six  months  and  across  different 
 situations, and comprises the three core symptoms in -
attentiveness,  impulsivity,  and/or  motor  unrest.  These 
core  symptoms  are  present  to  an  extent  beyond  what 
would be expected for the patient’s age, developmental 
level, and intelligence. To diagnose the disorder, clini-
cally relevant functional psychosocial impairment must 
be present in different settings, e.g., family, school, or 
work. In the general population, these core symptoms 
are  dimensionally  distributed  along  a  continuum,  the 
upper  end  of  which  constitutes  clinically  relevant 
ADHD  symptoms  (e1).  In  this  selective  review,  we 
focus on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, large reg-
istry studies, and randomized controlled trials. The aim 
is  to  provide  the  reader  with  an  evidence-based  over-
view  of  the  developmental  trajectories  in ADHD,  the 
various and often controversial treatment options, and 
the current state of etiological research.

Classification 
The  two  most  commonly  used  nosological  classifi-
cation systems worldwide, the ICD-10 and the DSM-5, 
are broadly consistent in their operationalizations of the 
various symptoms of ADHD, but differ with respect to 
subtypes  and  additional  criteria.  The  “subtypes”  de-
fined in the DSM-IV have been attenuated to “presenta-
tions”  in  the  DSM-5,  due  to  their  temporal  instability 
and frequent developmentally dependent changes from 
one category to another (e2, e3). The DSM-5 is the first 
classification  system  to  define  specific  features  of 
ADHD  in  adults,  reducing  the  number  of  symptoms 
necessary for diagnosis from the age of 17, due to the 

Core symptoms
The core symptoms of ADHD and HKD are in -
attentiveness, impulsivity, and/or motor unrest. 

SUMMARY
Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) is a common, early-onset, persistent develop -
mental disorder of childhood and adolescence, with a 
prevalence of approximately 5%. 

Methods: This article is based on publications retrieved by 
a selective search in PubMed with an emphasis on perti-
nent guidelines and systematic reviews. 

Results: At least 75% of affected children and adolescents 
develop a comorbid disorder, which impedes diagnosis 
and treatment and worsens prognosis. The etiology of 
ADHD is complex and heterogeneous, involving a major 
genetic component and diverse neurobiological altera -
tions. Prenatal environmental factors also seem to elevate 
the risk of ADHD. The mainstays of treatment are psycho-
education, behavioral therapy, and psychoactive drugs, 
which generally have only mild side effects, such as in-
somnia or decreased appetite. The indication for treatment 
in the individual case is based on severity, comorbidity, 
previous therapy attempts, and the familial, social, and 
educational framework conditions. 

Conclusion: Translational research is needed to clarify the 
etiology of ADHD. Epidemiological studies published since 
1987 do not reveal any increase in the prevalence of ADHD 
among children and adolescents. Improved diagnosis 
necessitates an evidence-based and need-adapted 
 approach to treatment.

fact  that  functional  impairment  can  persist  or  worsen 
with age despite an age-dependent reduction of symp-
toms (e3, e4). Moreover, the age of onset criterion has 
been raised to 12 in the DSM-5, as an older age of onset 
(between 7 and 12 years) was found to show no effect 
on clinical manifestation, symptom severity, nature and 
extent  of  comorbid  disorders,  neuropsychological 
 findings  and  functional  impairment,  progression  or 
treatment response (e5). 

of 

prevalence 

epidemiological 

Epidemiology
ADHD as defined by the DSM-IV criteria has a world-
wide 
5.3% 
[5.01%–5.56%]  and  is  thus  one  of  the  most  common 
mental illnesses in childhood and adolescence (3, e5). 
Use  of  the  stricter  ICD-10  research  criteria  leads  to 
lower  prevalence  estimates  of  approximately  1–2% 
(e6−e8).  According  to  the  DSM-IV  criteria,  around 
2.5%  of  the  general  adult  population  suffers  from 
ADHD  (4).  The  higher  prevalence  in  males  is  more 
pronounced  in  clinical  samples  (3–4 : 1)  than  in  epi-
demiological studies (2 : 1). ADHD is associated with a 
lower socio-economic status (e9). Although the rate of 
diagnosis has risen markedly around the world in recent 
decades,  currently  lying  at  approximately  4%  of 
children and adolescents in Germany, epidemiological 
studies have shown no change in the worldwide popu-
lation-based prevalence of 5.3% over the last 30 years 
(6). Rising rates of diagnosis are thus not due to a real 
increase  in  prevalence,  but  rather  to  improved  diag-
nosis or to an increase in functional impairment (5, 6, 
e10).

Developmental psychopathology
Symptom levels vary across different areas of life and 
according to the extent of external demands. In this re-
spect, situations that require attention, sitting still, and 
impulse control are often the first in which the symp-
toms  are  experienced  as  causing  impairment  (e.g., 
classroom  behavior,  homework,  chair-circle  activities, 
etc.). Marked motor unrest before the age of four years, 
however, is very hard to distinguish from a variant of 
normal behavior. Moreover, the novelty of a situation, a 
high  specific  motivation  or  expectation  of  a  reward, 
and  strong  external  behavioral  control  can  reduce 
symptoms in certain situations, but not in a long-lasting 
manner. Thus, a lack of symptoms in a circumscribed 
observational situation does not automatically rule out 
the  diagnosis.  In  children  of  elementary-school  age, 

increasingly  evident  and 
 inattentiveness  becomes 
causes greater impairment as the external demands in-
crease.  Motor  unrest  often  lessens  from  adolescence 
onward and is often reduced to a subjectively unpleas-
ant inner feeling of restlessness and drive, while diffi-
culties such as inattentiveness, deficient planning abil-
ity, and impulsivity often persist (5). In adulthood, the 
core  symptoms  of ADHD  may  be  accompanied  more 
prominently by symptoms of emotional dysregulation, 
including reduced frustration tolerance, irritability, and 
marked mood swings (7, 8, e11). 

Prospective  longitudinal  studies  have  shown  a 
 continuous  reduction  of  the  core  symptoms  over  the 
lifespan.  Generally  speaking,  only  around  5–15%  of 
patients  continue  to  completely  fulfill  the  diagnostic 
criteria  for  ADHD  in  adulthood,  although  persistent 
symptoms or functional impairment remain in approxi-
mately  70%  (3,  e12);  however,  findings  vary  widely 
across  studies  due  to  methodological  differences  and 
other reasons. Comorbid disorders may be more promi-
nent  than ADHD  itself  and  dominate  the  clinical  pic-
ture. A positive family history of ADHD, unfavorable 
psychosocial conditions (severe early childhood depri-
vation, psychopathology in one or both parents), severe 
core  symptoms,  and  comorbid  mental  illnesses  (par-
ticularly  conduct  disorders  and  depressive  disorders) 
are  risk  factors  for  an  unfavorable  course  and  for  the 
persistence of the disorder (9, e13–e16). 

ADHD  is  associated  with  psychosocial  functional 
impairment and a markedly reduced subjective health-
related quality of life (10, 11). Children with ADHD are 
about four times less likely than their peers to obtain a 
college  degree,  and  attain  a  lower  socio-economic 
status on average (12). Their relationships with parents, 
siblings,  peers,  and  partners  are  often  conflict-ridden 
(10, 12). Their risk of delinquent behavior is elevated 
by a factor of 2–3 (12, e17). From preschool age up to 
age  13,  the  risk  of  suicidal  ideation  is  almost  6  times 
higher than in their peers (e18), and they show a four-
fold-increased  lifetime  risk  of  suicide  (13,  e17,  e19); 
the severity of ADHD is correlated with the frequency 
of  suicidality  (e19).  Accident-proneness,  particularly 
regarding road traffic accidents, is the major reason for 
the 50% increase in mortality seen among persons with 
ADHD across all age groups (9, 11).

Although, according to the definition of ADHD, the 
disorder  first  manifests  in  childhood,  more  recent 
longitudinal cohort studies suggest that symptoms can 
also begin (or become clinically relevant) in adulthood 

Epidemiology
ADHD has a worldwide epidemiological prev -
alence of 5.3% [5.01%–5.56%] according to the 
DSM-IV criteria and is thus one of the most 
 common mental illnesses in childhood and 
 adolescence.

Developmental psychopathology
Prospective longitudinal studies have shown a 
continuous reduction of the core symptoms of 
ADHD as patients grow older.

(14,  e20,  e21).  The  interpretation  of  these  findings  is 
currently a matter of debate (e21). One possible expla-
nation is that protective factors prevent an early clinical 
manifestation  of  the  disorder,  and  symptoms  only  be-
come  evident  once  the  individual  is  subjected  to  the 
greater demands of adulthood. 

Developmentally dependent trajectories  
of comorbidity 
Approximately  75%  of  persons  with  ADHD  have  an 
additional  mental  disorder  and  around  60%  have 
multiple comorbid mental disorders; this can adversely 
affect  prognosis  and  may  necessitate  specific  thera-
peutic  measures  (15).  Circumscribed  developmental 
disorders (motor function, language, scholastic skills), 
anxiety  disorders,  tic  disorders,  and  oppositional-
 defiant  disorder  emerge  early  in  child  development 
(16). In contrast, depressive disorders and severe con-
duct disorders often emerge later on, toward the end of 
the elementary school years and during the transition to 
adolescence. From adolescence onward, such disorders 
are  often  associated  with  substance  abuse  and  depen -
dence (odds ratios [OR] 1.7 and 2.5, respectively) (12) 
and  with  the  development  of  personality  disorders  (8, 
e22, e23). Approximately one in four children receiving 
treatment  for  ADHD  also  have  an  affective  disorder 
(15, 16), while over half of all adults with ADHD have 
clinical  depression  (2.3-fold  increased  risk)  (12,  e24). 
Thus, the age-dependent development of comorbid dis-
orders  often  occurs  in  specific  sequential  steps  (e.g., 
from oppositional disorders, through conduct disorder, 
to depression with increased suicidality), particularly as 
comorbid  disorders  constitute  specific  risk  factors  for 
the development of further mental disorders (16).

Pathophysiology
Genetics
ADHD  tends  to  run  in  families.  First-degree  relatives 
have  a  five-  to  tenfold  increased  risk  of  developing 
ADHD  (e25,  e26,  17).  Twin  studies  have  revealed  a 
high degree of heritability: 70–80% of the phenotypic 
variance is attributable to genetic factors, sometimes in 
interaction  with  environmental  factors  (epigenetic 
changes  in  gene  expression  due  to  specific  environ-
mental  factors)  (17).  The  remaining  variance  is 
 explained  by  pre-,  peri-,  and  postnatal  environmental 
factors that twin siblings do not share. Shared environ-
mental  effects  are  of  secondary  importance.  Meta-
 analyses  of  candidate  gene  studies  have  shown  that 

M E D I C I N E

genes  encoding  the  receptors  and  transporters  of  the 
catecholaminergic  and  serotonergic  neurotransmitter 
systems play a role in the etiology of the disorder (17, 
18).  Genome-wide  association  studies  have  revealed 
many  other  potential  risk  variants,  and  their  findings 
suggest  that  some  40%  of  the  genetically  determined 
variance is due to common variants (i.e., variants with a 
frequency higher than 5%), which alone only increase 
the risk to a small degree (Table 1) (19, 20). Rare risk 
alleles (frequency <1%) and copy-number variants also 
elevate the risk; they can have relatively strong effects 
on individuals or within a single family, but account for 
only a small amount of the variance in the overall popu-
lation;  nicotinergic  and  glutamatergic  systems  and 
genes  regulating  neural  development  and  synaptogen-
esis also play a role in the etiology of ADHD (21, 22). 
Moreover,  there  are  a  number  of  genetic  syndromes 
which are known to be associated with the symptoms of 
ADHD,  including  fragile  X  syndrome,  microdeletion 
22q11  syndrome, 
tuberous  sclerosis,  and  Wil-
liams–Beuren syndrome (11, 23). 

toxins 

Environmental risk factors
Epidemiological  studies  have  shown  associations  be-
tween ADHD and various environmental factors. These 
primarily  include  pre-  and  perinatal  risk  factors  (ma-
ternal  stress,  smoking  or  alcohol  consumption  during 
pregnancy,  low  birth  weight,  prematurity),  environ-
mental 
(organophosphates,  polychlorinated 
 biphenyls,  lead),  unfavorable  psychosocial  conditions 
(severe  early-childhood  deprivation,  maternal  hostil-
ity),  and  dietetic  factors  (11,  23).  The  causal  role  of 
most  of  these  putative  environmental  risk  factors  has 
not  yet  been  proven:  The  variables  are  not  randomly 
distributed  in  the  population  and  the  observed  associ-
ations may be due to confounding factors and selection 
effects. Moreover, for some variables, causality may lie 
in the opposite direction, as ADHD itself may lead to 
increased  exposure  to  certain  environmental  factors 
(11, 23, e27). 
Multiple 

that  negative 
mother–child  interactions  can  be  a  result  (but  not  a 
cause) of ADHD symptoms in early childhood, but that 
maternal  hostility  negatively  influences  symptoms  in 
the  further  course  of  the  disorder  (e28,  e29).  The  as-
sociations of ADHD with prenatal exposure to maternal 
stress and maternal smoking seem to be partially due to 
confounding  factors,  although

school years and during the transition to adoles-

pregnancy, low birth weight, prematurity, environ-
mental toxins, unfavorable psychosocial condi -
tions, and dietetic factors.

 exposure  is  probably  not  explained  by  confounding 
variables;  they  make  only  a  small  contribution  to  the 
overall  variance,  however  (23,  24,  e29–e31).  By 
contrast,  the  causal  role  of  severe  early  childhood 
deprivation has been demonstrated (25, e32).

Neuropsychology
In  group  comparisons,  studies  have  shown  various 
neuropsychological  impairments  in  the  area  of  execu-
tive  functions  (inhibitory  control,  working  memory, 
planning  ability)  and  non-executive  functions  (regu-
lation  of  activation  and  arousal,  temporal  processing, 
memory,  reaction-time  variability).  Motivational  pro-
cesses and learning mechanisms are also affected, e.g., 
an aversion to delayed rewards and reduced behavioral 
control  and  error  processing  mechanisms.  However, 
these impairments and their profile are not specific to 
ADHD  (26,  e33,  e34);  as  they  show  only  medium 
 effect sizes, there is considerable overlap with healthy 
control  subjects.  Only  about  half  of  all  persons  with 
ADHD  have  marked  neuropsychological  impairment. 
Currently,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  associated  abnor-
malities are of causal relevance or should rather be seen 
as  epi-phenomena  of  the  etiological  mechanisms 
(26–28, e34, e35).

Structural and functional brain abnormalities
Global brain volume is reduced by 3–5%, with the gray 
matter  preferentially  affected  (29,  e36,  e37).  More 
marked volume loss, correlated with the severity of the 
symptoms of ADHD, is seen in the prefrontal areas, the 
basal  ganglia,  and  the  cerebellum  (29,  e36).  Cortical 
maturation  is  delayed,  particularly  in  the  prefrontal 
areas  (e38).  These  abnormalities  develop  to  differing 
degrees  across  brain  regions  and  patient  populations. 
The persistence of ADHD symptoms into adulthood is 
correlated with the persistence of these neuroanatomi-
cal  abnormalities  (e39).  Functional  imaging  reveals 
 hypoactive activation patterns in the prefrontal cortical 
areas,  the  anterior  cingulate  gyrus,  and  associated 
 parietal, striatal, and cerebellar structures (29, 30, e38, 
e40, e41). 

The  pathophysiological  mechanisms  of  ADHD  are 
not  yet  adequately  understood.  On  the  basis  of  the 
available  study  findings,  ADHD  is  presumed  to  be 
multifactorial in most cases. Genetic factors and early 
environmental  risk  factors  that  interact  in  complex 
ways  to  affect  the  structural  and  functional  develop-
ment of the brain play a major role and account for a

Diagnostic evaluation
The diagnostic evaluation integrates information 
from a detailed developmental history and family 
history, a psychological diagnostic evaluation, and 
a physical diagnostic evaluation including a differ -
ential diagnostic evaluation.

high degree of etiological heterogeneity. Each individ-
ual factor accounts for only a small part of the variance, 
i.e., each one is relevant only to a small percentage of 
affected persons or else has only a weak effect. The risk 
factors  that  have  been  identified  are  not  specific  for 
ADHD; they elevate the risk of other mental illnesses 
as well, and they also increase the extent of subclinical 
ADHD  symptoms  in  healthy  persons  without ADHD. 
These  findings  support  the  hypothesis  that  ADHD 
 represents one end of a dimension of traits that is con-
tinuously  distributed  in  the  general  population.  Its 
multifactorial  etiology  corresponds  to  the  hetero -
geneous overall profile of cerebral structural abnormal-
ities  and  functional  neuropsychological  and  psycho-
pathological disturbances (11, 23).

Diagnostic evaluation
Like  all  other  neuropsychiatric  disorders,  ADHD  is 
diagnosed  on  a  clinical  basis.  No  biomarker  has  yet 
been  found  with  adequate  sensitivity  and  specificity. 
Nonetheless,  ADHD  can  be  reliably  diagnosed  if  the 
diagnostic criteria are carefully scrutinized and differ-
ential diagnoses are excluded.

The  diagnostic  evaluation  integrates  information 
from a detailed developmental history and family his-
tory,  a  psychological  diagnostic  evaluation,  and  a 
physical  diagnostic  evaluation  including  a  differential 
diagnostic evaluation. If the patient is a child or adoles-
cent, the current clinical symptoms and their severity in 
multiple  areas  of  life  are  primarily  assessed  through 
 information  from  the  parents  and/or  other  adults  who 
interact  with  the  child.  Information  from  multiple 
 observers who deal with the patient in different areas of 
life  should  always  be  considered.  In  adulthood,  the 
diagnostic  evaluation  is  based  mainly  on  talking  with 
the patient, although information from family members 
or third parties (e.g., school report cards) can be help-
ful. Useful diagnostic aids include structured or semi-
structured interviews and checklists to assist in clinical 
judgments,  and  disorder-specific  questionnaires  to 
 determine  how  the  patient  is  viewed  by  parents  and 
teachers, as well as by him- or herself. Such question-
naires are now available in German for the diagnosis of 
ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults according to 
either  the  ICD-10  or  the  DSM-5  (e.g.,  DISYPS-III, 
IDA) (e42, e43) (eTable). For diagnosis, the symptoms 
must have led to a marked impairment of the patient’s 
performance  and/or  functioning  in  the  social  environ-
ment.  In  ADHD/HKD,  the  degree  of  severity  of  the 

core symptoms is not simply a function of the affected 
person’s  age  and  developmental  state.  Questionnaires 
and  checklists  enable  inexpensive,  systematic,  and 
standardized data collection from multiple areas of life 
but may yield misleading findings. If discrepancies in 
the assessment of the patient remain, it may help to try 
to  resolve  these  with  the  aid  of  more  information, 
which  can  be  obtained  over  the  telephone  (e.g.,  from 
teachers  or  carers)  or  in  further  face-to-face  conver-
sation  (e.g.,  with  the  patient’s  grandparents).  Persons 
filling  out  questionnaires  are  often  reluctant  to  give 
answers that cast the child in a negative light, or they 
may have other personal reasons for giving a modified 
answer (eTable). 

The diagnostic evaluation can also be supplemented 
with  psychological  tests,  which  are  necessary  when 
 certain  specific  differential-diagnostic  questions  have 
to be answered. About half of all persons with ADHD 
have  normal  neurocognitive  test  findings  despite 
marked  core  symptoms  of  the  disorder  (e33,  e34). 
 Reduced intelligence must be ruled out; a valid intelli-
gence assessment (e.g. with the WISC, or with another 
test such as the CFT-20R for a preliminary assessment) 
is  an  obligate  component  of  a  comprehensive  diag-
nostic evaluation. 

Laboratory tests and ancillary tests can be helpful for 
the  investigation  of  possibly  underlying  somatic  dis-
ease  (e.g.,  thyroid  disease,  disturbances  of  sight  and 
hearing,  organic  sleep  disorders,  drug-induced  dis-
orders) or in differential diagnosis (e.g., to distinguish 
ADHD from absence epilepsy). 

ADHD often needs to be distinguished from a con-
duct  disorder  or  depression.  Very  careful  distinctions 
must be drawn between the core symptoms of ADHD 
(impaired  concentration,  impulsivity,  hyperactivity) 
and the dissocial and aggressive symptoms that charac-
terize conduct disorder. Further observation over time 
can  clarify  whether  an  observed  lack  of  ability  to 
 concentrate  combined  with  heightened  irritability  is 
primarily or entirely due to a depressive mood distur -
bance,  rather  than  being  a  chronic  manifestation  of 
ADHD. Other, less common and very rare differential 
diagnoses  include  attachment  disorders  and  schizo-
phrenic and bipolar prodromes. 

The clinician must make the diagnosis in the light of 
all  the  findings,  and  not  merely  on  the  basis  of  ques-
tionnaires  or  behavior  observation  in  a  test  setting  in 
the absence of a thorough developmental history. Dif-
ferential  diagnoses  must  be  considered  and  ruled  out. 

Aids for the assessment of ADHD patients
Remaining discrepancies in the assessment of the 
patient may be resolved with the aid of further 
 information obtained over the telephone (e.g., 
from teachers or carers) or in face-to-face con-
versation (e.g., with the patient’s grandparents).

Differential diagnosis
ADHD often needs to be distinguished from a con-
duct disorder or depression. The core symptoms 
of ADHD can be difficult to distinguish from those 
of a conduct disorder.

 assessment (verbal: 0.52 [0.24; 0.80]; visual: 0.47 [0.23; 0.70]) and 
small but significant effect on ADHD core manifestations (35)

In blinded assessment, no statistically significant effect when all 
 studies are included (32); nonetheless, an exploratory secondary 
analysis (34) reveals a moderately strong, statistically significant 
 effect with the use of a standardized neurofeedback protocol (0.36 
[0.04; 0.69])

In blinded assessment, no statistically significant reduction of ADHD 
core manifestations (32), but (33) there is significant improvement in 
positive parenting behavior (0.63 [0.47; 0.7]),  reduction in negative 
parenting behavior (0.43 [0.24; 0.62]), and reduction of abnormal 
 conduct (0.31 [0.05; 0.57])

Nor can the diagnosis of ADHD be made or excluded 
solely on the basis of psychological testing. The lack of 
essential information, e.g., prohibition of contact with 
the school, weakens the validity of the diagnosis. 

Treatment
ADHD is generally treated in the outpatient setting. If 
outpatient treatment fails due to poor compliance, inad-
equate family resources, difficult drug adjustments, or 
impending expulsion from school, it may be necessary 
to  conduct  partial  or  full  inpatient  treatment.  Certain 
differential  diagnostic  questions  or  a  complex  burden 
of comorbidities constitute further possible reasons for 
inpatient treatment. 

Treatment  guidelines  from  Germany  and  abroad  now 
recommend  a  combination  of  multiple,  individually 
adapted  treatment  components  (multimodal  treatment) 
(31, e6, e62). The foundation of all therapeutic interven-

tions is psychoeducation to impart information about the 
disorder and potential treatment approaches to the parents, 
as  well  as  to  the  child  or  adolescent  patient  in  an  age-
 appropriate  manner.  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  tech-
niques are also used, in both individual and group settings: 
● In  childhood  and  adolescence:  parent  training, 
 interventions in kindergarten and in school, e.g., a 
therapy  program  for  children  with  problematic 
hyperkinetic and oppositional behavior (e63). 
● In adulthood: specific psychotherapy manuals. 
An  unblinded  assessment  showed  low  to  moderate 
effects on the core ADHD symptoms, which remained 
stable even after the end of treatment (32). However, so 
far,  significant  effects  have  not  been  conclusively 
 demonstrated in blinded assessment (32). By contrast, 
blinded  assessment  has  revealed  positive  effects  on 
 parental  child-rearing  behavior,  problems  of  conduct, 
and the functional level of the affected children (33).

Treatment
ADHD is usually treated on an outpatient basis. 

Therapeutic intervention 
The foundation of all therapeutic interventions is 
psychoeducation to impart information about the 
disorder and potential treatment approaches to 
the parents, as well as to the child or adolescent 
patient in an age-appropriate manner.

Meta-analyses have shown that food supplementa -
tion with unsaturated fatty acids has a weakly statisti-
cally significant but clinically irrelevant effect on the 
core  symptoms  of  ADHD  (32).  Nor  are  any  other 
 dietetic  measures  generally  of  therapeutic  use.  The 
utility  of  neurofeedback  as  part  of  a  multimodal 
 overall  treatment  plan  remains  unclear  (34).  So  far, 
an  insufficient  number  of  studies  with  high-quality 
training protocols have been performed. Such studies 
would  probably  yield  better  results  than  other 
 approaches (Table 2).

Alongside these treatments, pharmacotherapy (Table 
3) is a further essential component of ADHD treatment. 
The  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  treatment  with  stimu-
lants have been demonstrated repeatedly in many meta-
analyses,  e.g.,  that  of  the  National  Institute  of  Excel-
lence (e6). A recent Cochrane Review (36) cast doubt 
on the quality of the evidence supporting the efficacy of 

methylphenidate.  This  review,  however,  was  widely 
criticized  by  experts  around  the  world  and  aroused 
 vigorous  debate  due  to  its  unusually  strict  categoriza -
tions of bias, questionable inclusion criteria, methodo-
logical  errors,  and  an  inadmissible  clinical  interpre-
tation of the data (36, 37, e64–e69). 

Randomized trials on the long-term efficacy of treat-
ing  ADHD  with  stimulants  cannot  be  performed  for 
ethical  reasons.  The  last  three  decades  have  seen  a 
marked rise in the number of studies on the long-term 
results of treatment (e70, e71). Longitudinal studies of 
brain  development  (e36,  e72,  e73)  have  revealed  a 
structural  normalization  of  brain  development  under 
treatment  with  stimulants.  The  findings  of  Scandi -
navian  registry  studies  that  have  been  adjusted  for 
 potential  confounding  factors  suggest  that  drug  treat-
ment for ADHD reduces the risk of delinquent behavior 
(38),  substance  abuse  (e74),  suicidal  behavior  (e75), 

Positive effects
Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques have 
 positive effects on parental child-rearing behavior, 
problems of conduct, and the functional  level of 
the affected children.

Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy is an essential component of 
the treatment of ADHD.

and  accidents  (e76)  to  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically  relevant  extent.  Further  studies  have  also 
shown  a  reduction  of  functional  impairment  and  an 
 improvement in health-related quality of life (e77). In 
general,  (drug)  treatment  leads  to  a  more  favorable 
temporal  course  of  the  core  symptoms,  associated 
 psychiatric  disorders,  and  relevant  functional  impair-
ments, even though a fully normal state still cannot be 
 achieved in most cases (e71, e78, e79). 

The decision for drug treatment should be made only 
after  careful  consideration  in  all  cases,  as  should  the 
further decisions about when to treat, for what duration, 
and at what dosage. Behavioral therapy is always pref -
erable  to  drug  therapy  for  preschool  children  and  for 
school-age children with only mild symptoms. Primary 
treatment  with  drugs  is  indicated  from  school  age 
 onward  in  the  case  of  pronounced  and  situationally 
 independent ADHD symptoms that are causing marked 
functional  impairment  (e6).  Moreover,  there  is  evi-
dence  to  support  primary  drug  treatment  for  some 
children  with  moderate ADHD  symptoms.  For  adults 
with ADHD, drugs are the first line of treatment (e80). 
Patients  must  be  followed  up  regularly  over  the  long 
term  to  check  for  possible  side  effects  of  drug  treat-
ment;  in  particular,  their  blood  pressure,  heart  rate, 
height, and weight should be regularly monitored (39). 
The effect of treatment should also be monitored with 
regular  brief  periods  of  discontinuation  of  the  drug, 
generally once per year (39). 

For  the  treatment  of  associated  mental  disorders, 
further psychotherapeutic interventions on the basis of 
behavioral  therapy,  family  systems  therapy,  or  depth 
psychology may be helpful. Drugs may also be useful 
to treat certain comorbid psychiatric problems such as 
depression,  tic  disorders,  and  obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. 

Overview
ADHD is a developmental disorder that has not become 
any more prevalent in the general population in recent 
decades  but  that  has  nonetheless  become  increasingly 
well recognized. As it leads to functional impairment in 
multiple areas of life, is often associated with the devel-
opment  of  comorbid  mental  disorders,  and  can  have 
lifelong  adverse  consequences  for  the  patient, ADHD 
requires early, need- and age-adapted treatment consist-
ing of psychoeducation, behavioral therapy, and treat-
ment  with  psychoactive  drugs.  There  are  effective 
methods of treatment for both the core and accompany-

CLINICAL SNAPSHOT

Is Idiopathic Always Idiopathic? What the Teeth Can Tell Us

A 25-year-old woman presented to the periodontology clinic 
of the dental hospital because of generalized hyperplastic 
swelling of the gingiva. Her fasting blood sugar was normal 
(01/2013: 97 mg/dL), but her inflammatory parameters were 
elevated (01/ 2013: ESR 90 mm/hr, CRP 1.9 mg/dL, WBC 
11.1/nL). Her body-mass index (BMI) was over 30. As there 
was no other evidence of systemic illness and her medica -
tion use was unknown, the initially presumed diagnosis was 
of idiopathic gingival hyperplasia associated with chronic 
 periodontitis. Systematic non-surgical periodontal treatment 
along with adjuvant antibiotics led to moderate improvement, but the hyperplasia did not resolve. Repeated laboratory testing 
 value of 9.5%. Antidiabetic treat-
one year later revealed an elevated fasting blood sugar (03/2014: 204 mg/dL) and an HbA
ment and continued local mechanical treatment led to the near-total resolution of gingival hyperplasia. 

The initial findings: gingival hyperplasia

1c

We conclude from this case that patients who present with gingival hyperplasia should undergo intensified diagnostic testing 

for diabetes mellitus even if their initial fasting blood sugar is normal.
