ABSTRACT
Background: Firefighters, in the course of their professional responsibilities, confront an array 
of stressors contingent upon the distinctive characteristics of their duties.
Objective: This study investigated the longitudinal impact of trauma incidents during duty on 
firefighters using latent transition analysis.
Method: Data from 346 firefighters in South Korea who had experienced trauma events while 
on duty were utilized. Initially, latent groups were identified based on the relationship between 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Groups were labelled 
based  on  the  analysis  of  differences  in  PTSD,  mental  health,  and  growth-related  factors 
among  classified  groups.  Subsequently,  transition  probabilities  and  patterns  from  Time  1  to 
Time  2  were  examined,  followed  by  an  investigation  into  variances  based  on  demographic 
factors (gender, age) and occupational factors (work experience, shift pattern) using variance 
analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results:  First,  at  Time  2,  a  five-group  model  was  classified  into  ‘Growth,’  ‘Resilience  or 
Numbness,’  ‘Struggle,’  ‘Partial  Struggle,’  and  ‘PTSD’  groups.  Second,  upon  examining  the 
transition  patterns  between  latent  groups,  four  patterns  emerged:  ‘continued  distress,’ 
‘growth,’  ‘adaptation,’  and  ‘escalated  distress.’  Third,  the  ‘Struggle’  group  showed  a  0% 
probability  of  transitioning  to  the 
it  displayed  the  highest 
probability  among  the  groups  transitioning  to  the  ‘PTSD’  group.  Fourth,  latent  transition 
analysis  results  showed  a  strong  tendency  for  the  ‘Growth’  group  and  ‘Resilience  or 
Numbness’  group  to  remain  in  the  same  category.  Fifth,  age  was  found  to  be  a  significant 
factor affecting the transition of latent groups.
Conclusion:  This  research  represents  the  inaugural  attempt  to  longitudinally  investigate  the 
interplay between PTSD and PTG among firefighters.

Análisis  de  transición  latente  sobre  el  estrés  postraumático  y  el 
crecimiento postraumático en bomberos  

Antecedentes: Los bomberos, en el curso de sus responsabilidades profesionales, se enfrentan 
a  una  serie  de  factores  estresantes  que  dependen  de  las  características  distintivas  de  sus 
funciones.
Objetivo: Este estudio investigó el impacto longitudinal de los incidentes traumáticos durante 
el servicio en los bomberos mediante el análisis de transición latente.
Método:  Se  utilizaron  datos  de  346  bomberos  en  Corea  del  Sur  que  habían  experimentado 
eventos  traumáticos  mientras  estaban  de  servicio.  Inicialmente,  se  identificaron  grupos 
latentes  en  función  de  la  relación  entre  el  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  (TEPT)  y  el 
crecimiento  postraumático  (CPT).  Los  grupos  se  etiquetaron  en  función  del  análisis  de  las 
diferencias  en  el  TEPT,  la  salud  mental,  y  los  factores  relacionados  con  el  crecimiento  entre 
los  grupos  clasificados.  Posteriormente,  se  examinaron  las  probabilidades  y  los  patrones  de 
transición  del  momento  1  al  momento  2,  seguido  de  una  investigación  de  las  varianzas  en 
función  de 
factores  ocupacionales 
(experiencia  laboral,  patrón  de  turnos)  mediante  análisis  de  varianza  y  análisis  de  regresión 
logística multinomial.
Resultados: En primer lugar, en el momento 2, un modelo de cinco grupos se clasificó en los 
grupos  ‘Crecimiento,’  ‘Resiliencia  o  entumecimiento,’  ‘Lucha,’  ‘Lucha  parcial’  y  ‘TEPT.’  En 
segundo  lugar,  al  examinar  los  patrones  de  transición  entre  los  grupos  latentes,  surgieron 
cuatro  patrones:  ‘angustia  continua,’  ‘crecimiento,’  ‘adaptación’  y  ‘angustia  intensificada.’  En 
tercer  lugar,  el  grupo  ‘Lucha’  mostró  una  probabilidad  del  0%  de  transición  al  grupo 
‘Crecimiento,’ mientras que mostró la probabilidad más alta entre los grupos de transición al 
grupo  ‘TEPT.’  En  cuarto  lugar,  los  resultados  del  análisis  de  transición  latente  mostraron  una 
fuerte  tendencia  a  que  el  grupo  ‘Crecimiento’  y  el  grupo  ‘Resiliencia  o  entumecimiento’

1.  Introduction

Firefighters, in the course of their professional respon-
sibilities,  confront  an  array  of  stressors  contingent 
upon  the  distinctive  characteristics  of  their  duties. 
The  irregularity  inherent  in  their  work  schedules, 
coupled  with  the  manifold  hazards  intrinsic  to  their 
occupational milieu, along with poignant experiences 
at  the  scenes  of  incidents,  collectively  precipitate 
both  physical  and  psychological  stress.  This,  in  turn, 
can culminate in the manifestation of profound trau-
matic  experiences  of  a  serious  nature.  According  to 
the Korean National Fire Agency (2018), the exposure 
to  severe  traumatic  incidents  during  professional 
duties  occurs,  on  average,  7.8  times  annually,  with  a 
prevalence  rate  of  experiencing  such  events  at  least 
once  a  month  standing  at  17%,  indicating  a  notably 
elevated  frequency.  Furthermore,  the  prevalence  of 
(PTSD)  among 
stress  disorder 
post-traumatic 
firefighters,  as  compared  to  the  general  population, 
is reported to be 10.5 times higher. PTSD poses a sub-
stantial  risk  of  impairing job  performance,  diminish-
functional 
ing 
deterioration,  often  leading  to  adverse  health  out-
comes  such  as  depression  and  sleep  disorders  (Boffa 
et al., 2017; Del Ben et al., 2006).

and  overall 

satisfaction, 

job 

To  address  these  risks,  various  studies  are  under-
way  to  facilitate  the  recovery  of  mental  health  and 
job  adaptation  for  individuals  coping  with  PTSD.  In 
this context, the exploration of post-traumatic growth 
(PTG)  among  firefighters  holds  significant  impor-
tance.  As  highlighted  by  Calhoun  and  Tedeschi 
(2012), 
individuals  post-trauma  may  experience 
growth, showcasing enhanced functionality compared 
to  their  pre-traumatic  state,  achieved  through  a  pro-
cess  of  comprehending  and  integrating  the  shocking 
events.  Stressing  the  development  of  strengths  and 
resilience  rather  than  exclusively  concentrating  on 
the  trauma  itself  (Richardson,  2002),  it  is  imperative 
to integrally consider PTG in the endeavour to assist 
firefighters in adeptly adapting to their responsibilities 
without  succumbing  to  professional  attrition  in  the 
aftermath of trauma.

Given  that  both  occurrences  unfold  in  the  after-
math  of  distress,  a  noteworthy  correlation  exists 
between  PTSD  and  PTG  (Calhoun  &  Tedeschi, 
2012).  Intrusive  rumination  and  hyperarousal  trig-
gered  by  traumatic  events  may  result  in  profound 
suffering but also have the potential to stimulate per-
sonal  growth  by  instigating  a  reassessment  of  life 

(Cann  et  al.,  2011;  Dekel  et  al.,  2012).  Growth  may 
not happen unless an individual’s core beliefs and cog-
nitive frameworks undergo some level of challenge or 
change  (Calhoun  &  Tedeschi,  2012).  However,  the 
process  of  moving  towards  post-traumatic  growth, 
influenced  by  the  complex  nature  of  trauma  and  an 
individual’s  subjective  responses  to  stress,  presents 
inconsistent  outcomes, 
including  positive  (Zalta 
et  al.,  2017),  negative  (Ssenyonga  et  al.,  2013),  and 
independent (Joseph et al., 1993) relationships. There-
fore, for a more comprehensive understanding of the 
connection  between  PTSD  and  post-traumatic 
growth,  research  should  delve  into  individual  vari-
ations  in  responding  to  distress  and  consider  how 
these  patterns  evolve  over  time.  Prior  LPA  studies 
on the  relationship between  PTSD and  PTG are pre-
sented in Table 1.

Even  when  extending  the  consideration  beyond 
studies solely  focused on  PTG  to encompass  broader 
research on trauma-related aspects among firefighters, 
there remains a scarcity of longitudinal investigations. 
into  the  psychological  and 
Studies  have  delved 
emotional  consequences  following  traumatic  inci-
dents  (Berninger  et  al.,  2010;  Pineles  et  al.,  2013; 
VanderVeen  et  al.,  2012),  as  well  as  interventions 
(Skeffington 
assessing  changes  post-intervention 
et  al.,  2016).  However,  there  is  a  notable  absence  of 
comprehensive 
specifically 
addressing  PTG  among  firefighters.  Lee  (2009)  exam-
ined  firefighters’  PTSD  and  PTG  levels  over  a  seven- 
month  period,  finding  that  PTSD  tends  to  decline 
over  time,  and  that  greater  initial  PTSD  levels  might 
lead  to  more  significant  PTG  later.  However,  the  study 
was  conducted  over  a  relatively  short  duration,  and 
did  not  identify  specific  patterns  of  change  considering 
individual  differences.

longitudinal 

studies 

Thus,  the  study  aimed  to  comprehend  the  trajec-
tory of post-traumatic changes in firefighters and pin-
point the factors influencing this process. The research 
followed a dual approach. Initially, it investigated the 
correlation  between  PTSD  and  PTG  among 
firefighters  using  latent  profile  analysis  (LPA)  to  dis-
cern intergroup distinctions by creating latent groups 
that consider individual differences. Subsequently, the 
study  longitudinally  explored  the  transition  patterns 
of  these  latent  groups  across  different  time  points 
through 
transition  analysis  (LTA).  LTA 
involved  executing  LPA  separately  for  Time  1  and 
Time  2,  followed  by  scrutinizing  the  transition

patterns of latent groups across the two time points. In 
a  LTA  study  conducted  on  the  general  public,  there 
was  a  high  probability  that  the  latent  groups  for 
PTSD  and  PTG  would  transition  into  the  same 
group  (Chen  &  Wu,  2017).  However,  considering 
that  firefighters  routinely 
face  traumatic  events 
owing  to  their  line  of  work,  and  they  have  relatively 
easy access to mental health services for related experi-
ences, it is crucial to explore the longitudinal changes 
in this demographic.

In  this  investigation,  preliminary  data  from  Shin 
et  al.  (2023)  were  employed  as  Time  1  data.  At  each 
time  point,  latent  groups  were  categorized  based  on 
the levels of PTSD and PTG. Recognizing the multifa-
ceted nature of trauma, challenges were acknowledged 
in  distinguishing  groups  solely  based  on  the  general 
levels  of  PTSD  and  PTG.  Therefore,  in  alignment 
with Shin et al.’s (2023) approach, latent group charac-
teristics  were  examined  through  the  levels  of  specific 
factors related to PTSD and PTG, such as dissociation, 

depression,  rumination,  suicidal  ideation,  emotion- 
based  response,  mentalization,  and  psychological 
acceptance. In examining the relevance of each factor, 
dissociation  is  a  key  symptom  of  PTSD  and  rumina-
tion  is  not  only  a  primary  symptom  of  PTSD  but 
also  an  influential  factor  when  progressing  towards 
PTG  (Ahn  et  al., 2013;  Cann  et  al.,  2011).  Moreover, 
depression  and  suicidal  ideation  are  closely  linked 
to PTSD and are seen as particularly high-risk factors 
for  firefighters,  given  the  hazardous  nature  of 
their  work  (Jo  &  Park,  2012;  Kim  &  Yook,  2018). 
(Tedeschi  &  Calhoun, 
Emotion-based  response 
2004) and mentalization (Seo & Kim, 2018) play cru-
cial roles in the handling and comprehension of nega-
tive emotions associated with trauma, which are vital 
when advancing towards PTG. Furthermore, the con-
struct  of  psychological  acceptance  (Hass,  1994)  has 
been utilized to assess the extent to which individuals 
accept  pain  and  emotions  after  experiencing  a  trau-
matic event.

Demographic variables such as age, gender, years of 
service,  and  shift  pattern  were  examined  to  under-
stand  the  factors  affecting  the  transition  of  latent 
groups.  These  variables  were  previously  explored  in 
Shin  et  al.’s  (2023)  study,  which  served  as  the  Time 
1 data for this research, revealing that years of service 
and shift pattern significantly impacted group classifi-
cation.  These  factors  have  also  been  reported  in  pre-
vious  studies 
to  affect  either  PTSD  or  PTG. 
Specifically,  older  age  was  associated  with  a  higher 
use  of  deliberate  rumination,  and  being  female 
increased the likelihood of experiencing PTG through 
emotion-based response (Jin et al., 2014; Shakespeare- 
Finch  &  Lurie-Beck,  2014;  Vishnevsky  et  al.,  2010). 
Work  schedule,  particularly  shift  work,  has  been 
linked to an elevated risk of PTSD due to factors like 
sleep  quality  and  circadian  rhythm  disruption 
(Åkerstedt  &  Kecklund,  2017;  Germain,  2013;  Sopp 

et al., 2021). In contrast, the impact of work experience 
yielded  diverse  results;  certain  studies  indicated  that 
accumulating stress over time increases the likelihood 
of PTSD (Martin et al., 2017; Morris et al., 2016), while 
others suggested that greater expertise might facilitate 
PTG (Kwak & Bae, 2017).

In sum, this study analyzes the impact of traumatic 
experiences  on  firefighters,  considering  individual 
differences and the passage of time. It aims to provide 
distinct  findings  compared  to  previous  research  and 
offer insights into counselling and psychological inter-
ventions  based  on  individual  resources  and  trauma 
levels post-firefighters’ experiences.

2. Methods

2.1.  Participants  and  procedures

Time 1 data were obtained from a latent profile analy-
sis conducted in February–March 2021 as part of the 
2020 4.16 Foundation Life Safety Academic Research 
Support Project (Shin et al., 2023). Approximately 20 
months later, the Time 2 survey targeted 448 individ-
uals from the original 483, excluding 35 due to incom-
plete personal information (24), retirement (5), death 
(2),  or  unclear  workplace  (4).  Among  the  403  actual 
respondents,  57  participants  provided  unreliable 
responses  and  were  excluded.  The  demographic 
characteristics of 346 participants for Time 2 are sum-
marized  in  Table  2.  The  results  of  the  traumatic 
experience are as shown in Table 3.

2.2.  Measures

2.2.1.  Survey  of  possible  trauma  experiences  as 
firefighter
The traumatic incidents that firefighters faced during 
their service were surveyed using a trauma experience 
questionnaire  developed  by  Choi  (2010).  Certain 
items  were  adjusted,  such  as  transforming  item  4 
from  ‘physically  assaulted’  to  ‘verbally  or  physically

assaulted’  and  item  6  from  ‘threatened’  to  ‘sued  or 
threatened.’ This survey comprised a total of 17 ques-
tions, prompting respondents to indicate whether they 
have  experienced  various  types  of  traumatic  events 
(e.g.  life-threatening  injuries)  and  the  frequency  of 
those  experiences  (never  experienced,  experienced). 
This  was  done  to  assess  the  presence  of  traumatic 
experiences  and  the  number  of  traumatic  events 
encountered.

2.2.2. Intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep & 
numbness
The  Korean  Version  of  the  Impact  of  Event  Scale- 
Revised  (IES-R-K;  Eun  et  al., 2005)  was  utilized. The 
Impact  of  Event  Scale  (IES)  is  a  self-report  measure 
developed  based  on  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders-IV  (DSM-IV)  criteria 
(Weiss  &  Marmar,  1997).  IES-R-K  consists  of  intru-
sion  (5  items,  e.g.  ‘Other  things  kept  making  me 
think  about  it.’),  avoidance  (6  items,  e.g.  ‘I  tried  not 
to  think  about  it.’),  hyperarousal  (6  items,  e.g.  ‘I  was 
jumpy  and  easily  startled.’),  and  sleep  &  numbness 
(5  items,  e.g.  ‘I  had  trouble  staying  asleep.’)  as  four 
subscales.  It  is  evaluated  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale 
(0:  Not  at  all,  4:  Extremely),  with  a  total  of  22  items. 
Scores  of  17  or  below  are  considered  normal,  18  to 
24  as  partial  PTSD,  and  25  or  above  as  full  PTSD 
(Eun  et  al.,  2005).  In  Eun  et  al.’s  (2005)  study,  the 
internal consistency was reported as 0.63 for intrusion, 
0.70 for avoidance, and 0.87 for hyperarousal. In this 
study,  to  enhance  clarity  of  individual  symptom 
characteristics and interpretability as a sub-dimension 
of trauma experiences, each of the four subscales was 
separately  used  to  assess  the  level  of  PTSD.  In  this 
study,  Cronbach’s  α  was  0.92  for  intrusion,  0.94  for 
avoidance,  0.92  for  hyperarousal,  and  0.80  for  sleep 
& numbness.

2.2.3.  Dissociative  experiences
We utilized the Korean version of Dissociative Experi-
ences  Scale  (DES;  Bernstein  &  Putnam,  1986),  a 
measure  adapted  and  validated  in  South  Korea  by 
Park et al. (1995). The Korean version of DES consists 
of 28 items, grouped into four subfactors (Park et al., 
amnesia,  depersonalization- 
1995): 
derealization,  and  inattention.  A  total  score  of  20 
points  or  higher  is  classified  as  indicative  of  a  high 
likelihood  of  a  dissociative  disorder  (Park  et  al., 
1995). While the original DES used a somewhat com-
plex  scoring  system  with  a  horizontal  line  from  0  to 
100%,  this  study  employed  the  DES-II,  which 
addresses this complexity by using an 11-point Likert 
scale (ranging from 0, ‘never,’ to 10, ‘always’) to rep-
resent  scores  on  a  continuum  from  0  to  100%.  In 
Park  et  al.’s  (1995)  study,  Cronbach’s  α  was  .94,  and 
in  our  study,  it  was  found  to  be  .97,  indicating  high 
reliability.

2.2.4.  Post-traumatic  growth
We utilized the Revised Korean Version of the Stress 
Related Growth Scale (SRGS-R-K),  adapted and  vali-
dated  by  Shin  and  Kim  (2019)  from  the  work  of 
Boals  and  Schuler  (2018).  The  SRGS-R-K  consists  of 
a  total  of  13  items  rated  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale 
(−3:  Intense  negative  changes,  0:  No  change,  +3: 
Intense  positive  changes).  It  is  composed  of  two  fac-
tors: enhanced personal resources (e.g. ‘I experienced 
a  change  in  the  extent  to  which  I  find  meaning  in 
life.’)  and  enhanced  social  resources  (e.g.  ‘I  experi-
enced a change in the extent to which I communicate 
honestly  with  others.’).  A  lower  total  score  indicates 
negative changes, while a higher score indicates posi-
tive  changes.  In  the  study  conducted  by  Shin  and 
Kim  (2019),  the  Cronbach’s  α  for  total  scale  was  .93. 
In  the  current  study,  the  reliability  was  .95  for 
enhanced  personal  resources  and  .95  for  enhanced 
social resources.

2.2.5.  Intrusive  rumination  and  deliberate 
rumination
We  utilized  the  Korean  version  of  the  Event-Related 
Rumination  Inventory  (K-ERRI),  adapted  and  vali-
dated  by  Ahn  et  al.  (2013)  based  on  the  work  of 
Cann  et  al.  (2011).  The  K-ERRI  comprises  20  items, 
with  10  items  each  measuring  intrusive  rumination 
(e.g.  ‘Thoughts  about  the  event  came  to  mind  and  I 
could  not  stop  thinking  about  them.’)  and  deliberate 
rumination  (e.g.  ‘thought  about  whether  changes  in 
my life have come from dealing with my experience.’), 
rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0: Not at all, 3: Often). 
Ahn  et  al.  (2013)  reported  a  Cronbach’s  α  of  .93  for 
both  intrusive  and  intentional  rumination.  In  our 
study, the reliability was .96 for intrusive rumination 
and .96 for deliberate rumination.

2.2.6.  Depression
To  measure  depression,  we  utilized  the  Integrated 
Korean  version  of  the  Center  for  Epidemiologic 
Studies  Depression  Scale  (CES-D),  adapted  and  vali-
dated  by  Chon  et  al.  (2001)  based  on  the  work  of 
Radloff  (1977).  The  scale  consists  of  20  items  (e.g.  ‘I 
thought  my  life  had  been  a  failure.’)  rated  on  a 
4-point Likert scale (0: Rarely or none of the time, 1: 
Some  or  a  little  of  the  time,  3:  Most  or  all  of  the 
time, 5-7 days). A total score of 16 or higher indicates 
severe  depressive  symptoms.  Chon  et  al.  (2001) 
reported  a  Cronbach’s  α  of  .91,  while  our  study 
showed .90.

2.2.7.  Suicidal  ideation
The Scale of Suicidal Ideation (SSI; Beck et al., 1979) 
adapted  and  validated  by  Park  and  Shin  (1990)  was 
employed. SSI consists of a total of 19 items rated on 
a 3-point Likert scale (0: No ideation, 2: Strong idea-
tion).  A  score  of  9–11  suggests  a  need  for  attention, 

6 

Y. SHIN ET AL.

12–14  is  considered  a  risk  level,  and  15  or  above 
signifies  high-risk  for  suicide.  In  Park  and  Shin’s 
(1990) study, Cronbach’s α was reported as 0.87, and 
in this study, it was found to be 0.81.

2.2.8.  Emotion-based  response
Emotion-based response was conceptualized based on 
the  theory  of  Greenberg and  Safran  (1987), compris-
ing  three subfactors:  emotional awareness,  emotional 
processing,  and  emotional  expression.  Emotional 
awareness  utilized  11  items  from  the  Korean  version 
of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS; Salovey et al., 
1995)  adapted  and  validated  by  Lee  and  Lee  (1997). 
TMMS  employs  a  5-point  Likert  scale  (1:  Not  at  all, 
5:  Very  much).  Emotional  processing  and  emotional 
expression  each  utilized  8  items  from  the  Emotional 
Approach  Coping  Scale  (EAC;  Stanton  et  al.,  2000) 
adapted  and  validated  by  Kang  and  Yang  (2015). 
EAC  is  structured  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale  (1:  Not 
at  all,  4:  Very  much),  and  higher  scores  in  both 
TMMS  and  EAC  indicate  higher  levels  of  emotional 
awareness,  processing,  and  expression.  In  the  study 
by  Seo  and  Kim  (2018),  Cronbach’s  α  for  emotional 
awareness  was  .75,  emotional  processing  was  .88,  and 
emotional expression was .88. In this study, emotional 
awareness  was  .71,  and  emotional  processing  and 
expression were .93.

2.2.9.  Mentalization
The Self-Rated Mentalization Questionnaire (SRMQ), 
developed  by  Park  and  Chung  (2019)  based  on 
Fonagy’s  (1991)  operational  definition  of  reflective 
function  as  mentalization,  was  utilized.  The  SRMQ 
comprises four subdomains: reflection of the self and 
other,  absolute  certainty  about  others’  minds,  deficit 
of  emotion  awareness,  and  concrete  thinking.  In  this 
study,  ‘absolute  certainty  about  others’  minds’  was 
excluded  due  to  potential  interpretation  variation  by 
readers  (Park  &  Chung,  2019).  A  total  of  25  items 
were used to assess mentalization. The SRMQ employs 
a 5-point Likert scale (1: Not at all, 5: Very much), and 
when concrete thinking and deficit of emotion aware-
ness are reverse-coded and summed with reflection of 
the  self and  other, higher total scores indicate  higher 
levels  of  mentalization.  In  Park  and  Chung  (2019)’s 
study,  Cronbach’s  α  was  .87  for  concrete  thinking, 
.84  for  reflection  of  the  self  and  other,  and  .80  for 
deficit  of  emotion  awareness,  while  in  this  study,  the 
overall Cronbach’s α was .91.

2.2.10.  Psychological  acceptance
The  Korean  version  of  the  Acceptance  and  Action 
Questionnaire  II  (AAQ-II)  revised  by  Heo  et  al. 
(2009)  was  used.  This  version  is  based  on  the  trans-
lation  and  validation  of  the  original  instrument  by 
Hayes  et  al.  (2004),  which  was  subsequently  revised 
by Bond et al. (2011). The AAQ-II consists of a single 

factor  with  a  total  of  8  items  (e.g.  ‘My  painful 
memories  prevent  me  from  having  a  fulfilling  life.’), 
rated  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  (1:  Never  true,  4: 
Somewhat  true,  7:  Always  true).  Higher  total  scores 
indicate  higher  levels  of  psychological  acceptance.  In 
Heo  et  al.’s  (2009)  study,  Cronbach’s  α  was  .85, 
while in this study, it was .75.

2.3.  Data  analysis

This study employed SPSS 21.0 and Mplus 8.0 for stat-
istical  analysis.  Initially,  descriptive  statistics  (mean, 
standard  deviation,  range)  for  the  utilized  factors 
were  examined.  Additionally,  Confirmatory  Factor 
Analysis  (CFA)  was  conducted  to  determine  if  the 
sub-factors  of  PTSD  and  PTG  –  excluding  demo-
graphic factors  and related factors – fit the covariance 
matrix of the research model. Subsequently, to conduct 
LPA for Time 2, the analysis focused on the sub-factors 
of  PTSD  (intrusion,  hyperarousal,  avoidance,  sleep  & 
emotional  numbness)  and  PTG  (enhanced  personal 
resources,  enhanced  social  resources).  To  determine 
the  number  of  latent  groups,  information  criterion 
indices  (BIC,  sample  size  adjusted  BIC),  Entropy,  and 
Bootstrap  Likelihood  Ratio  Test 
(BLRT)  were 
employed.  Group  proportions  and  interpretability 
were  also  considered  in  the  decision-making  process 
(Kwon,  2011;  Kwon  &  Yang,  2014).  Lower  BIC  and 
saBIC  values,  Entropy  above  0.8,  and  significant 
BLRT  (p < .05)  were  considered  appropriate.  Group 
proportions  were  set  based  on  a  threshold  of  1%  of 
the sample size (Hill et al., 2000).

Subsequently,  the  study  examined  the  character-
istics  and  differences  of  each  latent  group  based 
on  the  levels  of  PTSD-related  factors  (intrusive 
rumination,  deliberate 
rumination,  depression, 
suicidal  ideation)  and  PTG-related  factors  (emotion- 
based  response,  mentalization,  psychological  accep-
tance),  naming  each  group  accordingly.  At  this  time, 
the  relevant  factors  were  examined  by  looking  at  the 
group mean and standard error, and significant differ-
ences  between  groups  were  investigated  using  the 
DCON  command  through  a  difference  analysis.  The 
study  then  examined  the  transition  patterns  between 
latent  groups  at  Time  1  and  Time  2.  The  variances 
of  the  LPA  indicators  for  the  two  time  points  were 
estimated with no constraints imposed.

Although  an  attempt  was  made  to  explore  the 
influence  of  age,  gender,  work  experience,  and  shift 
pattern on group transitions, the estimation of models 
including  these  factors  proved  infeasible  due  to  the 
complexity, preventing the identification of the global 
maximum  of  the  likelihood  function.  Consequently, 
the analysis of these factors was not possible.

Therefore, to meet the study’s objectives of under-
standing group-specific transition features, an alterna-
tive  approach  was  taken.  Initially,  the  groups  were 

classified  based  on  the  transition  characteristics  from 
Time  1  to  Time  2.  Then,  descriptive  statistics  and 
one-way  ANOVA  were  conducted  for  each  group, 
examining gender, age, work experience, and shift pat-
tern. Additionally, Multinomial Logistic Regression was 
employed  to  explore  the  impact  of  age,  gender,  work 
experience, and shift pattern. The transition character-
istics  of  each  group  were  treated  as  independent  vari-
ables  in  the  ANOVA  and  as  dependent  variables  in 
the logistic  regression analysis. Gender and shift work 
were  treated  as  binary  variables,  while  age  and  length 
of service were analyzed as continuous variables.

3.  Results

3.1.  Descriptive  statistics  and  confirmatory 
factor  analysis

The mean (standard deviation, range) for each factor 
included in the analysis is as follows: PTSD sub-factors 
ranged  from  1.40  to  2.40  (2.54∼3.88,  14∼21),  PTG 
sub-factors  ranged  from  2.67  to  3.48  (5.44∼6.38, 
36∼42),  dissociative  symptom  was  14.70  (23.92, 
164), intrusive rumination was 3.95 (6.00, 30), deliber-
ate  rumination  was  4.87  (6.48,  27),  depression  was 
10.30.43  (8.72,  49),  suicidal  ideation  was  2.15  (3.11, 
25), emotion awareness was 39.66 (6.27, 28), emotion 
processing  and  expression  were  43.68  (10.70,  48), 
mentalization was 62.30 (13.22, 100), and psychologi-
cal acceptance was 47.03 (5.95, 33). Before performing 
LPA, skewness and kurtosis were examined to assume 
normal  distribution.  The  results  did  not  exceed  the 
absolute  values  of  3  and  10,  respectively,  therefore 
the analysis proceeded (Kline, 2005). The CFA results 
confirmed that all factors were adequately represented, 
with  factor  loadings  ranging  from  β = .50  to  .98,  stan-
dard  errors  (SE)  from.031  to  .237,  and  critical  ratios 
(C.R.)  from  5.08  to  31.23  (p < .001).  Additionally,  the 
Tucker-Lewis Fit Index (TLI) was .94, the Comparative 
Fit  Index  (CFI)  was  .96,  and  the  Root  Mean  Square 
Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was .058. According 
to  the  fit  index  criteria  established  by  Browne  and 
Cudeck (1993), the analysis was deemed suitable.

proportions, and interpretability while incrementing 
the  number  of  latent  groups  from  2  to  6,  both  BIC 
and saBIC showed a decreasing trend as the number 
of groups increased, and the BLRT was significant for 
all groups. Beyond 6 groups, a distinctly meaningful 
interpretation  for  the  groups  was  not  feasible.  The 
the  most  substantial 
3-group  model  exhibited 
decrease  in  both  BIC  and  saBIC.  However,  the 
5-group model was considered the most appropriate, 
as  it  structurally  resembled  the  Time  1  model 
(Figure  1)  and  provided  clear  interpretability  for 
both  PTG  and  PTSD.  Table  5 presents  the  means, 
standard  deviations,  and  standard  errors  for  each 
indicator  of  PTSD  and  PTG  in  the  5-group  model. 
The distribution of subfactors at Time 2 is illustrated 
in Figure 2.

3.3.  Differences  in  relevant  factors  among 
latent  groups  at  Time  2

Table  6 displays  the  outcomes  of  the  analysis  of 
variance  concerning  the  naming  of  groups  based  on 
their characteristics.

Group 1, constituting 13.5% of the total, earned the 
label ‘Growth Group’ due to its highest PTG level and 
lowest  PTSD  level,  indicating  an  adaptive  experience 
of  PTG.  Group  1  exhibited  the  lowest  levels  of 
dissociation,  intrusion,  and  depression,  which  are 
PTSD-related  factors,  and  higher  levels  of  emotion- 
based  response  and  acceptance,  which  are  PTG- 
related factors.

Group  2,  accounting  for  13.3%  of  the  total,  was 
named  the  ‘Partial  Struggle  Group’  as  it  experienced 
a  moderate  level  of  both  PTSD  and  PTG,  indicating 
a  struggle  to  resolve  some  aspects  of  trauma.  Group 
2  displayed  somewhat  lower  PTG-related  factors 
than  the  ‘Growth  Group,’  but  lower  PTSD-related 
factors  compared  to  Groups  3  and  5,  suggesting  a 
mild struggle.

Group 3, comprising 3.5%, had the highest level of 
PTSD and a negative experience of PTG, leading to its 
classification as the ‘PTSD Group.’ Group 3 exhibited 
the highest levels of dissociation, intrusive rumination, 
deliberate  rumination,  depression,  and 
suicidal 
thoughts,  while  acceptance  was  low,  indicating  a 
very high level of distress from the traumatic event.

The fit indices for each latent profile model in the LPA 
are presented in Table 4. Upon examining the fit, class 

Group  4,  representing  62.9%,  showed  minimal 
experience  with  both  PTG  and  PTSD.  As  the  exact

cause of this phenomenon could not be determined in 
this  study,  Group  4  was  named  the  ‘Resilience  or 
Insensitive  Group.’  Group  4  had  low  PTSD-related 
factors  and  PTG-related  factors  that  were  either 
lower  or  similar  to  those  of  Group  1,  suggesting  less 
impact from the traumatic event.

Lastly, Group 5, comprising 6.9%,  demonstrated a 
high PTSD level but experienced average growth, indi-
cating a struggle to move beyond PTSD. Hence, it was 
named  the  ‘Struggle  Group.’  Group  5  showed  lower 
levels  of  dissociation,  rumination,  and  depression 
than Group 3 but still high; it also showed an average 
level of PTG but low in acceptance and emotion-based 
response, indicating simultaneous experiences of pain 
from trauma and growth.

3.4.  Transition  probability

Table 7 outlines the likelihood of latent group types at 
Time  1  transitioning  to  latent  group  types  at  Time 
2.  Most  groups  with  similar  characteristics  showed 
the  highest  transition  probabilities,  and  notably, 
there  was  a  0%  probability  of  transitioning  from  the 
‘Struggle’  group  at  Time  1  to  the  ‘Growth’  group  at 
Time 2.

When  using  the  ‘escalated  distress’  group  as  a  refer-

a  lower  age  increases  the  likelihood  of  an  individual 
belonging  to  either  the  ‘growth’  group  or  the  ‘adap-
tation’  group  as  opposed  to  the  ‘escalated  distress’ 
group.

This  study  used  LTA  to  examine  how  the  levels  of 
PTSD and PTG among firefighters change over time. 
The LPA results at Time 2 revealed the categorization 
of  latent  profiles  into  five  groups:  ‘Growth’  group 
(13.5%),’  ‘Resilience  or  Insensitive’  group  (62.9%), 
‘Struggle’  group  (6.9%), 
‘Partial  Struggle’  group 
(13.3%), and ‘PTSD’ group (3.5%). Except the addition 
of the PTSD group, characterized by the highest PTSD 
symptoms and negative changes in PTG variables, this 
classification  replicated  the  4-group  composition 
observed  at  Time  1  (Shin  et  al.,  2023).  These  results 
indicate  that  viewing  the  experiences  of  individuals 
after  trauma  through  a  dichotomy  of  high  and  low 
PTSD  symptoms  may  overly  simplify  the  post-trau-
matic  experiences.  Notably,  the  PTSD  levels  in  the 
‘PTSD’  group  were  comparable  to  or  slightly  higher 
than those in the ‘Struggle’ group at Time 1. However, 
a crucial distinction was made based on whether indi-
viduals  were  undergoing  negative  changes  or  experi-
concurrent  positive  growth.  Upon 
encing 
examining  the  numerical  values  related  to  the 
‘Struggle’  group  at  Time  1  (Shin  et  al.,  2023)  and 
those pertaining to the ‘PTSD’ group at Time 2, several 
distinctions become apparent. The ‘PTSD’ group dis-
plays  increased  levels  of  dissociation,  rumination, 
depression,  and  suicidal  ideation  when  compared  to 
the  ‘Struggle’  group,  while  also  exhibiting  decreased

levels  of  factors  traditionally  associated  with  PTG. 
These  findings  illustrate  the  complex  characteristics 
of  trauma  as  delineated  by  Calhoun  and  Tedeschi 
(2006). Additionally, the results indicate that individ-
uals experiencing a comparable degree of distress may 
follow divergent paths: some may engage in a struggle 
that catalyzes growth and development (Fletcher et al., 
2023); others may undergo what is described as decep-
tive self-enhancement (Maercker & Zoellner, 2004) or 
experience a negative growth trajectory (Boals & Schu-
ler, 2018). Thus, the present study suggests that PTSD 
symptom levels alone are insufficient to fully compre-
hend  the  scope  of  an  individual’s  traumatic  experi-
ence.  This  underscores  that  even  with  similar  PTSD 
levels,  the  subjective  perceptions  of  how  individuals 
navigate trauma can significantly differ.

‘Resilience  or 

Next, LTA results across time points revealed that 
the  ‘Growth’  group  and  ‘Resilience  or  Insensitive’ 
group  showed  a  strong  tendency  to  consistently 
remain in the same group. Specifically, the ‘Resilience 
or  Insensitive’  group  showed  remarkable  stability, 
with  77.3%  maintaining  their  status  unchanged.  In  a 
study  examining  the  relationship  between  PTG  and 
PTSD  in  earthquake  survivors  through  LTA,  Chen 
and Wu (2017) found that individuals were most likely 
to remain within their initial group. Notably, the ‘Resi-
lient’ group had the highest probability of consistency, 
with  a  retention  rate  of  88%.  This  finding  supports 
research  indicating  that  resilience  reflects  a  steady 
trait,  unaffected  by  changes  in  individual  character-
istics,  demographics,  and 
social  environments 
(Bonanno  et  al.,  2011).  Contrary  to  the  findings  of 
Chen  and  Wu  (2017),  our  study  indicates  that  both 
the  ‘Struggle’  group  and  the  ‘Partial  Struggle’  group 
exhibited  the  highest  likelihood  of  transitioning  to 
the 
Insensitivity’  category.  This 
phenomenon implies that constructive changes occur-
ring at the onset of an incident can play a crucial role 
in  bolstering  resilience.  Furthermore,  the  findings 
reveal that for firefighters, a decrease in psychological 
pathologies  is  more  indicative  of  an  increase  in 
resilience  rather than  growth.  In  the  Korean  context, 
there  is  a  consistent  expansion  of  efforts  to  survey, 
provide  counselling, 
implement  stress  resilience 
enhancement  programmes,  and  offer  support  for 
firefighters  classified  as  high-risk  groups  for  con-
ditions such as PTSD, depression, and sleep disorders 
(Korean  National  Fire  Agency,  2023).  This  ongoing 
initiative seems to have a positive impact on increasing 
and sustaining resilience among firefighters. This indi-
cates  that  although  individuals  may  initially  become 
vulnerable  due  to  the  circumstances  of  their  experi-
ence,  the  utilization  of  various  resources  appears  to 
support the recovery of resilience without challenging 
their  existing  schemas  and  core  beliefs,  thereby  pre-
venting  progression  towards  growth  (Calhoun  & 
Tedeschi,  2012).  Considering  the  dynamic  nature  of

resilience  evolving  through  the  interplay  between 
individuals and their environment (Laureys & Easton, 
2020),  continuous  support  in  this  aspect  emerges  as 
crucial.

that 

Additionally, 

the  analysis  revealed 

the 
‘Struggle’ group had a 0% probability of transitioning 
to  the  ‘Growth’  group,  while  displaying  the  highest 
likelihood of transitioning to the ‘Resilience or Insen-
sitive’  group.  The  interpretation  here  hinges  on  the 
idea that threatening events, while causing psychologi-
cal distress, may not lead to growth if they fall within a 
manageable and  predictable range without shattering 
one’s  beliefs  and  cognitive  frameworks  (Calhoun  & 
Tedeschi, 1999, 2012). Trauma, in this context, occurs 
when  an  event  is  unexpectedly  shocking,  challenging 
to  control,  and  difficult  to  cope  with  (Weaver  & 
Clum, 1995). Furthermore, the fact that there was no 
transition  to  the  ‘Growth’  group  but  a  shift  to  the 
‘Resilience  or  Insensitive’  group  could  be  interpreted 
as  individuals  in  this  group  successfully  alleviating 
psychological  distress  during  duty-related  events 
using their available resources, without  undergoing a 
growth experience.

In contrast, the ‘Struggle’ group exhibited the high-
est  probability  of  transitioning  to  the  ‘PTSD’  group. 
This  implies  that  individuals  who  moved  from  the 
‘Struggle’  group  at  Time  1  to  the  ‘PTSD’  group  at 
Time 2 initially experienced both growth and distress 
but are now encountering an escalation in distress and 
negative  changes.  While  PTSD  symptoms  resulting 
from traumatic events are crucial predictors of growth 
(Cann  et  al.,  2011;  Michl  et  al.,  2013),  sustaining 
growth  may  become  challenging  if  ongoing  distress 
fails to foster positive mood changes, as suggested by 
research  (Dekel  et  al.,  2012;  Zoellner  &  Maercker, 
2006).  Another  study  proposes  that  post-traumatic 
growth  may  involve  a  deceptive  element,  generating 
self-enhancing  illusions  leading  individuals  to  report 
growth as a coping strategy, even when actual growth 
may not occur (Maercker & Zoellner, 2004). The wor-
sening  of  symptoms  over  time,  a  pattern  noted  in 
other studies (Adams et al., 2019; Goodman-Williams 
et al., 2022; Meijer et al., 2019), suggests an experience 
of severe symptoms to the point where the perception 
of  ‘things  are  changing’  is  turning  negative.  The 
‘PTSD’ group, characterized by high levels of deliber-
ate  rumination  in  an  attempt  to  move  beyond  trau-
matic  experiences, 
facing 
worsening  symptoms.  Therefore,  future  research 
should  delve 
factors  predicting  differences 
among  individuals  transitioning  to  the  ‘Resilience  or 
Insensitive’ group, such as cumulative trauma experi-
ences and the types of traumatic events encountered. 
This  exploration  could  yield  valuable  insights  for 
implementing  practical  measures 
enhance 
firefighters’  job  adaptation,  return  to  work,  and 
resilience.

the 

To explore differences and impacts of gender, age, 
work experience, and shift patterns at Time 2 among 
groups  classified  according  to  transition  patterns, 
both  ANOVA  and  logistic  regression  analyses  were 
conducted.  While  the  ANOVA  results  were  not  sig-
nificant, 
logistic  regression  analysis,  which 
included all predictors and controlled for the influence 
of  other  variables,  yielded  noteworthy  findings.  It 
demonstrated that younger  individuals have a  higher 
probability  of  being  in  the  ‘adaptation’  or  ‘growth’ 
groups  as  opposed  to  the  ‘escalated  distress’  group. 
The  finding  that  older  individuals  are  more  likely  to 
belong  to  a  group  experiencing  pain  compared  to 
the  general  group  can  be  understood  in  the  context 
of  studies  such  as  Cao  et  al.  (2018).  Examining  prior 
studies,  including  research  on  age-related  increases 
in  PTSD  levels  among  children  and  adolescents 
(Chen  &  Wu,  2017;  Fan  et  al.,  2015),  sheds  light  on 
the  observation  that  deliberate  rumination  efforts  to 
comprehend  events  and  a  preference  for  emotion- 
based response strategies tend to strengthen with age 
(Folkman  et  al.,  1987;  Shakespeare-Finch  &  Lurie- 
Beck,  2014).  While  deliberate  rumination  is  a  crucial 
aspect of the process leading to post-traumatic growth, 
it’s  important  to  note  that  it  can  also  contribute  to 
higher PTSD symptoms during the attempt to under-
stand  events  (Pineles  et  al.,  2017).  Despite  some 
studies  indicating  that  younger  firefighters  are  more 
susceptible  to  psychological  distress  (Goh  et  al., 
2021),  this  vulnerability  may  be  contingent  on  job 
conditions.  Generally,  younger  individuals  are  more 
inclined  to  seek  help  in  crisis  situations  (Jeong  & 
Kim,  2021),  increasing  their  likelihood  of  benefiting 
from  various  support  mechanisms  provided  by 
firefighting  agencies.  This  insight  suggests  that  being 
younger  could  be  an  asset  in  coping  flexibly  with 
threatening  situations  (Amiri  et  al.,  2023).  While 
older  age  is  typically  associated  with  longer  work 
experience, the non-significant impact of work experi-
ence  in  this  study  implies  that  individual  character-
in 
istics  may  play  a  more 
maintaining stability than job-related factors.

substantial 

role 

In the Time 1 LPA study conducted by Shin et al. 
(2023),  age  did  not  emerge  as  a  significant  factor, 
whereas work-related aspects such as years of service 
and  shift  pattern  were  identified  as  significant.  How-
ever,  in  our  current  study,  the  lack  of  significance 
for years of service and shift pattern can be attributed 
to the intricacies of model estimation during the LTA 
analysis,  preventing  an  exhaustive  exploration  of 
influencing  factors.  Additionally,  the  dynamic nature 
of  shift  pattern,  contingent  on  job  responsibilities, 
complicates  establishing  a  direct  link  with  transition 
features.  In  our  investigation,  the  shift  pattern  was 
examined  at  the  time  of  the  survey,  and  the  20- 
month  interval  between  Time  1  and  Time  2  posed 
challenges  in  understanding  how  alterations  in  the 

shift  pattern  might  impact  transition  patterns.  How-
ever,  when  considering  the  results  of  the  Time  1 
study  collectively,  it  appears  that  shift  work  creates 
an environment that renders firefighters more suscep-
tible to experiencing PTSD symptoms. Moreover, age 
seems  play  a  role  in  shaping  the  long-term  mainten-
ance,  promotion,  or  persistence  of  a  psychologically 
healthy  state  or  PTSD  symptoms.  To  delve  deeper 
into these processes and gain a clearer understanding, 
further  in-depth  research,  incorporating  a  larger 
sample  size  for  comparing  groups  with  unchanged 
and  changed  shift  pattern  or  enabling  more  complex 
model estimation, is warranted.

5. Clinical implications

This  study  provides  important  clinical  insights  for 
firefighters  who  are  frequently  exposed  to  traumatic 
events.  First,  the  findings  offer  valuable  information 
for  determining  tailored  intervention  strategies  for 
firefighters.  It  emphasizes  the  need  to  differentiate 
the  direction  of  interventions  based  on  whether  the 
perceived  impact  of  the  traumatic  event  is  positive 
or  negative,  even  if  individuals  exhibit  similar  levels 
of  PTSD  symptoms.  If  the  individual  perceives  the 
impact  as  positive,  they  may  be  more  amenable  to 
change.  Conversely,  if  the  impact  is  perceived  nega-
tively,  it  becomes  essential  to  identify  factors  that 
may  exacerbate  distress  over 
time  post-trauma 
(Adams et al., 2019), or the collapse of self-enhancing 
illusions  (Maercker  &  Zoellner,  2004),  and  consider 
strategies that promote a positive shift.

Secondly, the study underscores the importance of 
considering the firefighter’s age, in addition to making 
adjustments  to  work  patterns  (Shin  et  al.,  2023),  in 
efforts  to  alleviate  the  distress  associated  with  trau-
matic events. The influence of age over length of ser-
vice  in  impacting  group  classifications  suggests  a 
greater  need  to  focus  on  personal  characteristics 
than  on  traits  associated  with  tenure.  Features  com-
mon in older individuals, such as reduced help-seek-
ing  behaviour  (Jeong  &  Kim,  2021)  and  rigid 
thinking  (Amiri  et  al.,  2023),  may  elevate  the  risk 
after  a  traumatic  event.  Therefore,  interventions  that 
account  for  these  general  traits  may  facilitate  the 
shift from distress to growth or resilience.

6. Limitations

The limitations of this study and suggestions for future 
research are as follows. First, during the data collection 
for  longitudinal  analysis,  the  sample  size  comprised 
483  individuals  at  Time  1  and  346  individuals  at 
Time  2.  Unfortunately,  this  limited  sample  size  hin-
dered  our  ability  to  analyze  the  transition  factors  in 
LTA,  which  aimed  to  explore  20  different  transition 
patterns  across  4  groups  at  Time  1  and  5  groups  at 

Time 2. Additionally, the ‘PTSD group’ at Time 2 had 
only 13 individuals (3.5%). The complexity of the data 
also introduced methodological constraints, making it 
impractical to analyze latent transitions and the effects 
of  independent  variables  within  a  unified  model, 
potentially  risking  family-wise  type  I  errors.  Despite 
the  convention  in  LPA  studies  which  typically  rec-
ommend  a  minimum  group  ratio  of  4%  to  5%,  we 
chose to proceed with the analysis. This decision high-
lights our commitment to accurately reporting specific 
experiences, regardless of the group sizes involved. We 
also  considered  that  the  lifetime  prevalence  rate  of 
PTSD  is  1.5%  (Korean  National  Center  for  Mental 
Health,  2022).  This  situation  diverges  from  the  com-
monly  proposed  3-step  approach  (Ryoo  et  al.,  2018), 
and challenges such as a small sample size may com-
plicate  predictions 
latent  transition 
models. These challenges can be mitigated by increas-
ing  the  sample  size;  therefore,  future  studies  should 
ensure  a  sufficient  number  of  participants,  such  as 
firefighter panels, are available for analysis.

in  complex 

Second,  the  results  revealed  that,  apart  from  age, 
the  influencing  factors  based  on  transition  features 
were  not  significant.  This  contrasts  with  the  findings 
of  a  cross-sectional  study  at  Time  1  (Shin  et  al., 
2023), where shift pattern emerged as a significant fac-
tor  influencing  the  relationship  between  PTSD  and 
PTG.  Given  this  discrepancy,  future  research  could 
conduct  more  nuanced  investigations,  comparing 
groups  with  unchanged  shift  pattern  and  those  with 
changed shift pattern. A qualitative analysis of experi-
ences  of  change  after  traumatic  events  could  also  be 
pursued.

Finally,  the  ‘Resilience  and  Insensitivity’  group 
exhibited the highest proportion and transition prob-
ability,  underscoring  the  pivotal  role  of  resilience  in 
job  adaptation  and  well-being.  As  this  study  did  not 
delve  into  a  detailed  analysis  of  factors  contributing 
to  increased  resilience,  future  research  could  explore 
individual  characteristics  like  social  support  (Sattler 
et al., 2014) and engagement in physical leisure activi-
ties  (Lim  et  al.,  2020)  to  better  understand  resilience 
among firefighters.

7.  Conclusions

This  research  marks  the  inaugural  attempt  to  longi-
tudinally investigate the interplay between PTSD and 
PTG  among  firefighters.  While  the  majority  of 
firefighters  maintained  good  mental  health  through 
resilience,  a  notable  portion  of  the  sample  (22.7%), 
specifically those in groups characterized by continued 
or  escalated  distress  in  transition  features,  continued 
to report stress from traumatic events. This indicates 
ongoing exposure to risks such as job maladaptation, 
severe depression due to PTSD, and suicidal thoughts. 
Therefore, in addition to supporting resilience, there is

a critical need for continued attention to and research 
on  job  characteristics  and  individual  traits  that  con-
tribute to elevated levels of PTSD symptoms. Notably, 
the  higher  likelihood  of  distress  in  older  age  groups, 
particularly  those  aged  40  and  above,  suggests  a  ten-
dency to avoid seeking professional help, as indicated 
in  previous  research  (An  &  Seo,  2017).  This  under-
scores the need for customized intervention strategies 
specifically  designed  for  older  firefighters,  distinct 
from  those  applicable  to  their  younger  counterparts. 
In  line  with  the  suggestions  by  Jeong  and  Kim 
(2021), broadening the scope of counselling could be 
beneficial,  enabling  older  firefighters  to  access  inter-
ventions  addressing  practical  issues  such  as  family, 
interpersonal  relationships, 
job  satisfaction,  and 
efficiency.
