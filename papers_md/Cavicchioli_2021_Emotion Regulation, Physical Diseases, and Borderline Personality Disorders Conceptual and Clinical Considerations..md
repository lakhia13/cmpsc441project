This perspective paper aims at discussing theoretical principles that could explain
how emotion regulation and physical diseases mutually inﬂuence each other in the
context of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Furthermore, this paper discusses
the clinical
implications of the functional relationships between emotion regulation,
BPD and medical conditions considering dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) as a well-
validated therapeutic intervention, which encompasses these issues. The inﬂexible
use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression, experiential
avoidance, and rumination) might directly increase the probability of developing
physical diseases through a physiological pathway, or indirectly through a behavioral
pathway. Some metabolic and chronic medical conditions could signiﬁcantly impact
emotional
functioning through biological alterations involved in emotion regulation.
Several empirical studies have shown high co-occurrence rates between BPD and
several chronic physical diseases, especially ones linked to emotion-based maladaptive
behaviors. DBT addresses physical diseases reported by individuals with BPD reducing
problematic behaviors functionally associated to emotion dysregulation and identifying
physical health as a goal for Building a Life Worth Living.

INTRODUCTION

The inﬂuence of emotional processes on physical health has long been hypothesized and
investigated. For instance, Hippocrates aﬃrmed that the bodily humors, which represent the
basis of personality and related emotional experiences, inﬂuence diseases (Allport, 1961). In the
mid-20th century, psychoanalysts hypothesized that psychological conﬂicts could be involved in
the development of somatic symptoms that represent the manifestation of underlying repressed
unacceptable feelings and emotions (e.g., Alexander et al., 1968). Similarly, Selye (1955), who

physiological impacts of emotional reactions to environmental
demands and their possible links to physical health. Accordingly,
it has been historically assumed that emotional diﬃculties play a
causal role in diseases (Kubzansky and Winning, 2016). However,
the onset and persistence of diﬀerent physical diseases might
also signiﬁcantly aﬀect the quality of emotional reactions and the
ability to manage them (De Ridder et al., 2008).

Therefore, the current perspective paper aims at discussing
theoretical principles that could explain how emotion regulation
and physical diseases mutually inﬂuence each other. Accordingly,
a functional behavioral approach (for an overview of core
principles see: Sugai et al., 2000) is adopted to clarify: (a)
how diﬃculties with emotion regulation and related behaviors
increase the probability of developing and maintaining diseases,
and (b) how physical diseases constitute relevant vulnerability
factors for engaging in maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.
Furthermore,

the therapeutic implications of
are discussed. Particularly, we consider the clinical condition
borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is well-recognized
to be characterized by emotion dysregulation and high comorbid
rates with several chronic medical conditions. Furthermore, the
paper discussed the clinical utility of dialectical behavior therapy
(DBT; Linehan, 1993), which is a third-wave cognitive-behavioral
intervention (Masuda and Rizvi, 2019) based on the application
of mindfulness principles (Robins, 2002) speciﬁcally developed
to treat BPD, as an evidence-based approach (Panos et al.,
2014) to eﬀectively address the maladaptive associations between
emotional dysregulation and medical diseases.

associations between maladaptive

According to these aims, the current perspective paper was
structured as follows. First of all, several models of emotion
regulation were discussed in order to provide a conceptual
framework to identify adaptive and maladaptive processes.
Subsequently,
emotion
regulation and physical diseases were reviewed in order to
highlight how these aspects mutually inﬂuence each other.
Starting from this evidence, the work described the key role of
diﬃculties in emotion regulation as core features of BPD that
could explain its clinical manifestations and its high comorbid
rates with several chronic medical conditions. Ultimately,
the main principles of DBT were discussed in terms of how
this structured therapeutic framework could be applied to
address diﬃculties in emotion regulation, their relationship with
maladaptive behaviors and the consequences of physical diseases
among individuals with BPD.

Emotion Regulation Processes
Although there is not a deﬁnitive consensus on operationalizing
emotion regulation (e.g., Cole et al., 2004), diﬀerent theoretical
perspectives refer to this construct by considering all
the
processes involved in consciously or automatically inﬂuencing
positive and negative emotions,
in terms of their intensity,
duration, and/or quality (Naragon-Gainey et al., 2017). With
respect to this broad conceptualization, Naragon-Gainey et al.
(2017) identiﬁed three groups of theoretical models of emotion
regulation. The temporal process model of emotion regulation
(e.g., Gross, 1998, 2015) posits that it can be implemented

“adaptive”

at any of the four stages of emotion generation—an emotion
is elicited by a situation, attention to contextual features of
situation, cognitive appraisal of the situation and emotional
response (i.e., behavioral, physiological, and experiential).
Accordingly, the temporal process model of emotion regulation
yields speciﬁc emotion regulation strategies for each stage of
emotion generation, namely situation selection (e.g., avoidance
of environmental contexts altogether) and situation modiﬁcation
(e.g., changing or avoiding speciﬁc features of a situation),
(e.g., distraction), cognitive change
attentional deployment
(e.g., reappraisal), and response modulation (e.g., expressive
suppression). Strategy-based models of emotion regulation
(e.g., Aldao et al., 2010; Aldao and Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012)
acceptance, problem solving,
recognize
mindfulness) and “maladaptive” (e.g., experiential avoidance
[EA], rumination, worry) emotion regulation strategies in
the light of
their positive and negative relationships with
psychopathological symptoms, respectively. Focusing on the
maladaptive mechanisms of emotion regulation, EA has two
related parts: (a) unwillingness to remain in contact with aversive
private experiences (e.g., bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts,
memories, and behavioral predispositions), and (b) action
taken to alter aversive experiences or the events that elicit them
(Chawla and Ostaﬁn, 2007). Rumination describes “a mode
of responding to distress that involves repetitively and passively
focusing on symptoms of distress and on the possible causes and
consequences of these symptoms” (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008;
p. 400). Worry is largely considered a speciﬁc form of rumination
focused on anxious symptoms (Watkins et al., 2005).

(e.g.,

Additionally, Naragon-Gainey et al. (2017) have described
a third group of emotion regulation models, ability-based
models (e.g., Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Berking et al., 2008)
that capture dispositional abilities — emotion recognition,
responses to emotions, modulation of emotion-based behaviors,
perceived access to eﬀective emotion regulation strategies —
involved in diﬀerent emotion regulation strategies and situations,
which are hypothesized to facilitate healthy emotion regulation
and to maintain psychopathological conditions. Figure 1
provides an integration of
temporal process and strategy-
based models of emotion regulation based on the meta-analytic
results of Naragon-Gainey et al. (2017).

Reciprocal Inﬂuences Between Emotion
Regulation and Physical Diseases
Empirical research has shown signiﬁcant relationships between
several emotion regulation processes and diﬀerent physical
diseases. For instance,
there is a growing consensus that
supports the impact of negative aﬀectivity in the development
of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and coronary heart diseases
(CHD) (e.g., Roest et al., 2010; Kupper and Denollet, 2018).
These ﬁndings are largely consistent with several studies that have
found that suppression, which is linked to persistent negative
emotionality (e.g., Wegner and Zanakos, 1994; Moore et al.,
2008), was rigidly used by individuals with CVD and CHD
(Mund and Mitte, 2012). Furthermore, additional maladaptive
emotion regulation strategies, such as worry and rumination

were also associated to the previous clinical conditions (Tully
et al., 2013). Similar ﬁndings were highlighted among individuals
with chronic pain. Speciﬁcally, the systematic review published
by Koechlin et al. (2018) based on the results of 15 studies
showed that individuals aﬀected by chronic pain reported a
recurrent use of response-focused emotion regulation strategies
(e.g., expressive suppression, EA), which were associated to the

several
maladaptive emotion regulation processes, especially related to
dysfunctional attention mechanisms (i.e., rumination and worry)
and response-focused strategies (i.e., suppression and EA), played
a role in clarifying the onset and maintenance of CVD, CHD,
and chronic pain. Accordingly, these ﬁndings might suggest that
maladaptive emotion regulation processes have a direct impact
on physical diseases. This direct link might be partially explained
considering the eﬀects of these emotion regulation strategies
on the activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)
axis and the sympathetic nervous system, which increase
inﬂammatory mechanisms associated with the subsequent onset
of physical conditions (e.g., Appleton and Kubzansky, 2014).

et al., 2017; Thornton et al., 2017; Walker and Druss, 2018).

Hence, the inﬂexible use of maladaptive emotion regulation
strategies — suppression, EA, rumination, worry — might
directly increase the probability of developing physical diseases
through a physiological pathway (e.g., heightened activity of
HPA), or indirectly through a behavioral pathway. However,
it has also been demonstrated that people with chronic
medical conditions have an elevated risk of reporting emotional
diﬃculties. Indeed, results from meta-analytic studies have
indicated that people with diﬀerent chronic physical conditions
(e.g., diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis) have a higher
risk of developing depressive symptoms compared to healthy
individuals (e.g., Dickens et al., 2002; Rotella and Mannucci,
2013; Li et al., 2015). Similar ﬁndings were also replicated when
the impact of several chronic medical diseases on the onset of
anxiety-related conditions were considered (e.g., Smith et al.,
2013; Pan et al., 2015). This evidence has led some scholars
to hypothesize shared biological mechanisms between physical
and aﬀective conditions. For instance, Moulton et al. (2015)
suggested that type two diabetes causes an overactivation of
innate immunity that leads to a cytokine-mediated inﬂammatory
response and a dysregulation of the HPA axis. These biological
reactions might directly aﬀect the brain, causing depressive
symptoms. The dysregulation of the HPA axis induced by
CHD was also linked to the development of depressive and
anxious symptoms frequently reported by individuals with
these medical conditions (e.g., Grippo and Johnson, 2002).
Consistently with this evidence, it could be possible to conclude
that some metabolic and chronic medical conditions could
signiﬁcantly impact the emotional functioning of individuals

Borderline Personality Disorder: Emotion
Dysregulation and Maladaptive Emotion
Regulation Strategies
Borderline personality disorder is a severe mental disorder
characterized by dysfunctions in a wide range of emotional,
behavioral,

Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). The second edition
(Lingiardi and

emotional domain,
individuals with BPD are described as
persons that feel “emotions that easily spiral out of control
intensity, compromising their capacity
and reach extremes of
for adaptive functioning (Lingidardi and McWilliams p. 53)”.
Intense aﬀective reactions of being rejected and abandoned
characterized the interpersonal functioning of individuals with
BPD, especially regarding close relationships. These intense
emotional states dispose individuals with BPD to misunderstand
the attitudes and behaviors of others as signs of present or future
rejection and abandonment. Their interpersonal functioning is
also characterized by broad impairments in mentalization, which
are reﬂected in frequent misinterpretation of other people’s
behaviors, intentions, and emotions together with diﬃculties in
taking other perspectives. The rapid oscillations of emotions

may make suicide threats or gestures for the same reasons.
Suicide attempts might also have an interpersonal function as a
form of manipulation of others together with the intention to
attract other people’s attention. Ultimately, problematic sexual
and aggressive behaviors that characterized individuals with
BPD could be linked to interpersonal relationships, especially
when attachment needs are stirred up. The dysfunctional
relationships existing among the emotional, cognitive, behavioral
and interpersonal domains might explain how individuals with
BPD tend to have trouble making and maintaining long-lasting,
gratifying close relationships and stable, satisfying work lives.

Starting from this clinical description, several clinicians have
proposed diﬀerent etiopathogenetic theories of BPD (for a
review see: Gunderson et al., 2018). One of the most inﬂuential
clinical theories of BPD was proposed by Linehan (1993),
who hypothesized that
the core feature of the disorder is
emotional dysregulation. Consistently with this model, BPD
emotion dysregulation was considered the result of repetitive
transactions between an individual biological vulnerability
and the eﬀects of invalidating environments (Crowell et al.,
2009). The biological vulnerability includes three diﬀerent,
albeit interrelated, characteristics of emotional response: (a)
hyper-sensitivity — low threshold for emotional reactions;
(b) hyper-reactivity — intense emotional responses; (c) slow
return to emotional baseline — long-lasting emotional reactions.
Several experimental studies have provided support for this
conceptualization of emotion dysregulation among individuals
with BPD (for meta-analytic reviews see: Ruocco et al., 2013;
Mitchell et al., 2014; Kaiser et al., 2016; Schulze et al., 2016,
2019; Bortolla et al., 2020). However, other scholars (e.g.,
Selby and Joiner, 2009; Chapman et al., 2011; Carpenter and
Trull, 2013) have developed Linehan’s original formulation of
emotion dysregulation. These authors have sustained that several
maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a key role in

Emotion Regulation and Physical Diseases

sustaining the biological alterations of Linehan’s biosocial model
and in explaining core dysfunctional behaviors in BPD, such
as suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury behaviors, substance
abuse and other problematic eating behaviors. According to
these hypotheses, empirical research has shown that individuals
with BPD rigidly use response-focused emotion regulation
strategies (i.e., suppression, EA and dissociation) (for meta-
analytic reviews see: Cavicchioli et al., 2015; Scalabrini et al.,
2017) and other emotion regulation strategies
linked to
altered attentional mechanisms, such as rumination and worry
(Cavicchioli and Maﬀei, 2020, under review). Several studies
have also demonstrated that all these strategies have deleterious
eﬀects on emotional responses, chieﬂy increasing their intensity
and duration (e.g., Sloan, 2004; Barnow et al., 2012; LeMoult
et al., 2013). Furthermore, empirical evidence has shown
that these maladaptive emotion regulation strategies represent
signiﬁcant mediators of relationships between BPD emotional
vulnerabilities and core dysfunctional behaviors, especially self-
harm, binge eating and substance-use behaviors (e.g., Chapman
et al., 2005; Selby et al., 2009).

Taking these ﬁndings together, emotion dysregulation in BPD
should be conceptualized taking into account two interrelated
levels. The ﬁrst level refers to biological alterations of emotional
response. The second level is related to the inﬂexible use of
maladaptive response-focused emotion regulation strategies
together with the engagement
in dysfunctional attentional
emotion regulation processes. These levels are mutually
inﬂuenced and, they are reinforced through core problematic
behaviors in BPD. The interdependence among such mechanisms
over time might explain the chronic and pervasive dysregulation
of the system of emotions characterizing individuals with BPD.

Borderline Personality Disorder and
Physical Diseases: Empirical Evidence
Taking together the direct and indirect eﬀects of maladaptive
emotion regulation strategies on the onset and maintenance of
several chronic physical diseases and the key role of emotion
dysregulation in BPD, it could be hypothesized that individuals
with BPD have an elevated risk of developing comorbid medical
conditions. Considering the direct physiological pathway linking
maladaptive emotion regulation to physical diseases through
alterations of the HPA axis, several studies have demonstrated
persistent abnormalities in the HPA axis among individuals
with BPD, especially for those with other comorbid conditions
such as depressive and posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD)
(e.g., Zimmerman and Choi-Kain, 2009). With respect to the
indirect pathway sustained by frequent engagement in unhealthy
behaviors (e.g., substance use and maladaptive eating behaviors),
high co-occurrence rates between BPD and substance use
disorders are well-documented (22% across diﬀerent settings),
especially alcohol (17%), cocaine (22%), and opioid (34%)
use disorders (Trull et al., 2018). The signiﬁcant associations
between BPD and eating disorders have also been supported.
A recent meta-analysis showed that up to 20% of individuals
with anorexia and bulimia nervosa meet criteria for BPD
(Martinussen et al., 2017). Similar results were found considering

the portion of individuals with binge eating disorder and BPD
(e.g., Sansone et al., 2004, 2008).

Empirical evidence seems to conﬁrm the hypothesis linking
BPD to an elevated risk of developing several physical diseases.
Considering CVD,
individuals with BPD showed a risk of
reporting ischemic heart disease and stroke that was eight
times higher than non-BPD subjects (Moran et al., 2007). The
elevated risk of reporting CVD in later adulthood among patients
with BPD was replicated in another large sample and, it was
explained by a mediating role of obesity, which is signiﬁcantly
associated to maladaptive eating behaviors frequently reported
by individuals with BPD (Powers and Oltmanns, 2013). The
high comorbidity with metabolic syndromes (e.g., hyperglycemia
and hypertriglyceridemia) related to obesity was also conﬁrmed
among individuals with BPD, showing a two-fold risk over non-
BPD subjects (Kahl et al., 2013). Furthermore, El-Gabalawy et al.
(2010) conducted an epidemiological study using a nationally
representative sample (N = 34,653) evaluating associations
between BPD and diﬀerent physical conditions — arteriosclerosis
or hypertension; hepatic disease; diabetes; cardiovascular disease;
venereal disease; gastrointestinal disease; obesity; arthritis; and
stroke. Results showed that up to 50% of individuals with
BPD suﬀered from at least one of these medical conditions.
The most recurrent physical diseases were obesity (33.6%),
arteriosclerosis or hypertension (28.2%) and arthritis (27.7%),
followed by cardiovascular disease (15.3%) and gastrointestinal
the analyses also showed an
disease (12.1%). Interestingly,
elevated risk of developing the medical conditions previously
mentioned (i.e., adjusted odd ratios ranged from 1.46 [1.21–
1.78] to 2.80 [1.80–4.36]), even controlling for sociodemographic
and clinical variables (i.e., any anxiety, mood, or substance use
disorders (SUDs), and any personality disorder). Ultimately,
Quirk et al. (2016) reviewed results from 13 population-based
studies examining the prevalence of personality disorders and
their associations with physical comorbidities across diﬀerent
continents (i.e., North America, Western Europe, and Oceania).
The results of this review further conﬁrmed a speciﬁc association
between BPD and CVD. An additional medical condition
signiﬁcantly associated with BPD is chronic pain. With respect
to this physical disease, Sansone and Sansone (2012) summarized
results of eight studies showing that roughly 30% of patients
with chronic pain met the criteria for BPD and, individuals
with BPD consistently reported higher levels of pain than those
without this disorder. More recently, several empirical studies
have replicated the signiﬁcant association between BPD and
chronic pain (e.g., Reynolds et al., 2018; Reynolds and Tragesser,
2019; Johnson et al., 2020).

Therefore, this evidence consistently supports that individuals
with BPD have an elevated risk of developing severe chronic
physical diseases, especially CVD, obesity-related conditions
and chronic pain. According to the hypotheses mentioned
above, this elevated risk might be explained by a direct eﬀect
of emotion dysregulation on alterations of
the HPA axis
together with the indirect eﬀects of maladaptive behaviors
robustly associated to diﬀerent dysfunctional emotion regulation
strategies. However, taking into account the biological eﬀects
of these medical conditions on emotional functioning (Grippo

and Johnson, 2002), they should be considered relevant factors
involved in sustained emotion dysregulation in BPD. Hence,
medical conditions should be included in clarifying mechanisms
determining the broad diﬃculties
in regulating emotion
reporting by BPD patients. Consistently, a comprehensive
assessment of medical conditions becomes one of the primary
target of BPD treatments, and the adequate resolution of physical
diseases should be considered an objective of psychotherapeutic
interventions for BPD in the light of their impact on the
core features of the disorder. Figure 3 depicts the functional
relationships between emotion dysregulation and physical
diseases in BPD.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy for the
Treatment of BPD: Core Principles
Dialectical behavior therapy was originally developed as an
attempt to apply behavioral principles for the treatment of highly
suicidal women (Linehan, 1981). Currently, the latest meta-
analytic review (Cristea et al., 2017) aggregating the results of
13 randomized controlled trials evaluating the eﬀects of DBT
for BPD highlighted that this therapeutic model should be
considered one the most eﬀective treatments for this disorder
with the largest empirical support of eﬃcacy. From its origin,
DBT has been modiﬁed using a trial-and-error approach based on
problem solving and social learning theory for addressing clinical
problems of highly suicidal and BPD patients (Linehan and
Wilks, 2015). However, the exclusive use of cognitive-behavioral
strategies has produced invalidating experiences in clients,
causing hostility toward therapists or recurrent termination

of treatment. Consequently, acceptance and distress tolerance
strategies have been combined with change strategies and
suggestions for a dialectical use of them. Accordingly, Linehan
has introduced mindfulness behavioral skills that could be taught
to both clients and therapists (Linehan and Wilks, 2015).

therapy treatment

Dialectical behavior

includes various
modes — individual psychotherapy, group skills training,
telephone coaching, and team consultation. Individual therapy
primarily aims to reinforce motivation for change and to
overcome obstacles to achieving personal goals and values. DBT
skills training is delivered in a learning group format and has the
purpose of helping patients substitute maladaptive behaviors with
goal-oriented behaviors based on four skill modules: mindfulness,
emotional regulation, interpersonal eﬀectiveness, and distress
tolerance (Linehan, 1993). The main role of telephone coaching
is helping clients to use skills in their everyday lives between
sessions, supporting the learning and generalization of DBT skills
in diﬀerent contexts and environments. Ultimately, the weekly
consultation team ensures adherence to the treatment model,
prevents therapist burnout, and provides additional support to
those patients who are at high risk of engaging in severely
dysfunctional behaviors.

The main treatment goal of DBT is to “build a life worth living”
(Linehan, 1993; Coyle et al., 2019). Considering the clinical
complexity of individuals with BPD, DBT provides guidelines
for clinicians to prioritize problems within sessions in order to
eﬀectively achieve the main treatment goal. Accordingly, targets
of the treatment are grouped into four stages. Stage 1 focuses
on clients ceasing problematic behaviors by improving their
use of adaptive skills. The behavioral targets are hierarchically

organized as follows: (i) decrease imminent life interfering
behaviors (e.g., suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury);
(ii) reduce therapy interfering behaviors (e.g., missing treatment
and behaviors that burn out the therapist); (iii) decrease quality-
of-life interfering behaviors (e.g., substance use, unemployment,
and homelessness); (iv) increase behavioral skills. The second
stage is called “quiet desperation.” Targets of stage 2 are
improving the quality of emotional experiences and the treatment
of PTSD. Stage 3 is aimed at reducing ordinary problems in living.
Finally, stage 4 is provided to increase a sense of completeness
and/or achieve transcendence.

the
Consistently with the hierarchical organization of
treatment, DBT postulates a thorough assessment of clinical
problems through functional behavioral analysis (FBA), which is
also called “chain analysis.” FBA refers to a systematic process of
understanding factors that contribute to and maintain a speciﬁc
behavior (e.g., Horner, 1994). The conceptual assumptions of
FBA have their roots in the work of the early behaviorists
and in principles of operant and classical conditioning (for a
review see: Baum, 2004). Speciﬁcally, FBA attempts to identify
which internal and external contingencies (e.g., rewards and
punishments) maintain a behavior and which change it. Chain
analysis is largely used in the early stages of treatment when
clients engage in problematic behaviors. Speciﬁcally, a clinician
conducts a chain analysis following the hierarchy of target
behaviors. FBA in DBT provides a complete sequence of events,
including both internal and external cues and triggers that
lead to target behaviors. Furthermore, the chain analysis is
composed of ﬁve key elements that a therapist must consider for a
comprehensive and eﬀective behavioral assessment: vulnerability
factors, prompting events, links on the chain, problem behaviors,
and consequences (Rizvi and Ritschel, 2014).

The Inclusion of Physical Diseases in
Treating BPD With DBT
Summarizing the evidence previously discussed, a large portion
of individuals with BPD suﬀer from severe and chronic physical
diseases (i.e., CVD, obesity-related conditions, and chronic
pain). These medical conditions are robustly associated with
problematic behaviors (e.g., substance abuse and binge eating)
linked to emotion dysregulation in BPD. Furthermore, severe and
chronic physical problems represent relevant biological factors
that interfere with adaptive emotional functioning. Consistently,
physical health should be considered a key aspect within
psychotherapy interventions, especially for BPD.

With respect

to DBT, a therapist

focuses on physical
diseases and related behaviors in diﬀerent stages of treatment.
Independently of the stage in the therapy, chain analysis is
the key therapeutic tool to eﬀectively clarify the functional
relationships between medical conditions and diﬀerent clinical
features of BPD. During stage 1, the onset and maintenance of
a speciﬁc physical condition, such as CVD, might be treated as
a consequence of the recurrent engagement in several quality-
of-life interfering behaviors, especially substance abuse and
binge eating. With respect to this scenario, the clinician’s and
patient’s primary treatment goal in individual psychotherapy

is to work on improving the eﬀective use of behavioral skills
learned during the group DBT skills training. Mindfulness skills
(e.g., observing non-judgmentally and being eﬀective) (Linehan,
2014; pp. 151–213) and behavioral abilities (e.g., STOP, TIP,
pros and cons, distraction, self-soothe with ﬁve senses, dialectical
abstinence, and clear mind) (Linehan, 2014; pp. 419–490)
included in the distress tolerance module might be particularly
appropriate for reducing or ceasing these problematic behaviors
and consequently, they might address factors that sustain related
medical conditions.

Alternatively, it is possible that physical conditions, especially
chronic pain (Kirtley et al., 2020), might be the prompting
event for other life-interfering behaviors in BPD (i.e., suicide
attempts and non-suicidal self-injury behaviors), as empirically
demonstrated in epidemiological studies (e.g., Druss and Pincus,
2000; Singhal et al., 2014). Considering this functional
link
between the onset of medical diseases and the engagement
in these problematic behaviors,
the primary goal of DBT
intervention might be to reinforce emotion regulation skills
(e.g., checking the fact, problem solving, accumulating positive
emotions, and mindfulness of current emotions), within both
individual and group settings, (Linehan, 2014; pp. 350–408)
and reality acceptance skills (e.g., radical acceptance, turning
the mind, and willingness) included in the distress tolerance
module (Linehan, 2014; pp. 451–469). The improvement of these
cognitive-behavioral skills should help individuals with BPD and
chronic pain to eﬀectively regulate distressing, justiﬁed emotions
elicited and sustained by a severe medical condition without
making it worse through life interfering behaviors.

Conducting a chain analysis, the patient and the therapist
might also highlight the role of physical diseases as signiﬁcant
vulnerability factors for diﬃculties in regulating emotions.
Several studies have demonstrated that chronic pain and
diﬀerent cardiovascular and metabolic diseases linked to obesity
signiﬁcantly alter the functioning of HPA (e.g., McBeth et al.,
2005; Pasquali et al., 2006; Bose et al., 2009; Ortiz et al., 2020).
According to the DBT model and this empirical evidence, BPD
vulnerability to emotional dysregulation — heightened sensitivity
and reactivity to emotional stimuli, together with a slow return to
the emotional baseline — might be sustained by an inadequate
management of physical illness in the light of intense fear of
going to a physician or behavioral diﬃculties aﬀecting getting to
doctor’s appointments. Consistently, the clinician and patient, or
patient and other participants of DBT skills training might work
on speciﬁc abilities, such as checking the fact and problem solving,
to resolve interfering emotions with eﬀective self-care behaviors.
Furthermore, other emotion regulation skills, such as cope ahead
(Linehan, 2014; p. 394), could address behavioral dysregulation
that does not allow individuals with BPD engage in behaviors
necessary to manage diﬀerent medical conditions. An additional
goal that is considered within the DBT model is to maintain
a healthy physical condition long-term in order to reinforce
emotional stability over time. Accordingly, the PLEASE skill,
which refers to an emotion regulation module (Linehan, 2014;
pp. 396–397), might be included in reaching this therapeutic
goal through the development of a more adaptive and healthy
lifestyle. This skill focuses on diﬀerent domains of self-care,

which are identiﬁed by the acronym as follows: PL – treat
PhysicaL illness (i.e., take care of your body. See a doctor when
necessary. Take prescribed medication); E – Balance Eating (i.e.,
Try to eat the amounts and kinds of foods that help you feel
good. Eat regularly and mindfully throughout the day); A –
avoid mood-Altering substances (i.e., stay oﬀ illicit drugs and
alcohol); S – balance Sleep (i.e., Try to get the amount of sleep
that helps you feel good, usually between 7 and 9 h); E – get
Exercise (i.e., Do some sort of exercise 5 to 7 days per week for
20 min each time).

Taking together the clinical scenarios mentioned above,
the management of physical diseases among BPD individuals
treated with DBT might be a relevant target of intervention
starting from its early stages, considering their robust functional
associations with the core features of BPD. However, severe
and chronic medical conditions could also appear during
later stages of the therapy when emotional and behavioral
dysregulation are resolved. During stage 3 in which the
to achieve “ordinary” happiness
clinician helps the patient
and unhappiness through the resolution of problems, self-care
might become the main goal of the therapy. Consistently,
the clinician sustains and shapes the problem-solving and
acceptance skills of the patient which were acquired during
the early stages of intervention (e.g., interpersonal eﬀectiveness
skills module — DEAR MAN, FAST, and GIVE — Linehan,
2014; pp. 248–260), especially in an individual
setting.
This is in order to solve any diﬃculty linked to medical
conditions (e.g., relational diﬃculties with doctors,
fear of
medical
treatments or lack of money to access adequate
medical assistance).

DISCUSSION

this

This perspective paper has sought to highlight the reciprocal
relationships between maladaptive emotion regulation strategies
and the onset and maintenance of diﬀerent physical diseases.
Starting from a theoretical discussion of
topic, an
additional aim of this study was to provide a prototypical
clinical scenario to show the functional associations between
emotional dysregulation and physical diseases namely in
the case of BPD. Considering this clinical population,
the
current work also sought
to show how DBT could be
an eﬀective approach to simultaneously address diﬃculties
with emotion regulation and their relationships with medical
conditions among individuals with BPD. This
theoretical
discussion has laid the theoretical background for adapting
and empirically implementing the DBT model as an eﬀective
psychotherapeutic intervention to prevent the onset of severe
and chronic physical conditions in high-risk populations and
to manage the maladaptive eﬀects of medical conditions on
emotional functioning.

The empirical evidence regarding the role of emotion
regulation mechanisms on the onset and maintenance of
physical diseases, especially chronic ones (e.g., cardiovascular
and metabolic diseases and chronic pain), suggested that the
inﬂexible use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies

linked to attentional functioning (i.e., rumination and worry)
together with dysfunctional response-focused emotion regulation
processes (i.e., EA and suppression) could have a direct
link to medical conditions through a physiological pathway,
sustaining altered HPA activity. Maladaptive emotion regulation
the probability of
strategies might also indirectly impact
developing physical diseases through a behavioral pathway,
which is characterized by a recurrent engagement in unhealthy
behavior (e.g., substance use and binge eating) to suppress
or avoid distressing emotional states. However, studies on the
eﬀects of several medical diseases on emotional functioning
demonstrated that they might be biological vulnerability factors
for adaptive emotion regulation taking into account
the
physiological consequences of physical illness on HPA alterations
(McEwen, 2007; Moulton et al., 2015). Moreover, medical
conditions might be triggers for the onset and stabilization
of depressive and anxious symptoms, which are recognized as
epiphenomena of diﬃculties in regulating negative emotions
(e.g., Garnefski and Kraaij, 2006; Cisler et al., 2010) linked to
physical diseases.

Therefore, the previous empirical ﬁndings suggested that
maladaptive emotion regulation mechanisms and medical
conditions show complex interrelationships that reciprocally
inﬂuence and reinforce each other over time. The complexity
of the mutual relationships between these conditions ﬁnds a
prototypical expression among individuals with BPD. Indeed,
consistent evidence has conﬁrmed that biological alterations
(Crowell et al., 2009; Schulze et al., 2016, 2019) and dysfunctional
psychological mechanisms (e.g., emotional suppression and
avoidance) (Carpenter and Trull, 2013; Cavicchioli et al., 2015)
sustain BPD emotional dysregulation. Diﬃculties in regulating
emotions among individuals with BPD are also manifested
in recurring and rigid maladaptive behaviors, which might
become comorbid clinical conditions such as SUDs and binge
eating disorder. Individuals aﬀected by BPD show signiﬁcantly
higher rates of chronic physical diseases (e.g., cardiovascular
and metabolic obesity-related diseases, and chronic pain) than
the general population. This is consistent with the role of
emotional dysregulation and related behaviors in BPD and
with the hypothesis linking these clinical aspects with medical
conditions. This high prevalence of chronic illness among
individuals with BPD should be considered a relevant biological
vulnerability factor of emotional dysregulation (i.e., altered
activity of HPA) and as a persistent negative emotional-eliciting
situation, which might trigger the disorder’s core maladaptive
behaviors (e.g., suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury
behaviors) (Druss and Pincus, 2000; Singhal et al., 2014).
Hence, medical conditions should be carefully considered for a
comprehensive examination of BPD emotional and behavioral
dysregulation. Accordingly, clinical interventions for BPD should
focus on the managing this biological dimension in order
to provide appropriate treatments for individuals aﬀected
by this disorder.

Taking these considerations together, the DBT model might
be a well-validated approach to address these complex clinical
issues among individuals with BPD. The principles of FBA,
in particular, represent the key assessment tools to precisely

and quality of life. After the clinician identiﬁes the clinical
priorities, the patient learns a wide set of cognitive behaviors to
improve acceptance toward experiences and external events (i.e.,
mindfulness and distress tolerance skills) and implement eﬀective
problem-solving strategies to manage distressing emotions and
related situations (i.e., emotion regulation and interpersonal
eﬀectiveness skills) during group skills training. The clinician
and patient work together in individual psychotherapy to
reach a dialectical balance between acceptance and problem-
solving skills

and individualized functional relationships among emotional

conditions on psychological functioning.

this model

The clinical principles of DBT mentioned above have
made it possible to eﬀectively adapt
to treat
several conditions among adolescents and adults aside from
BPD (e.g., Ritschel et al., 2015; Valentine et al., 2020),
which are characterized by high levels of emotional and
behavioral dysregulation. Consistently with the ﬂexibility of
the DBT model and empirical evidence linking emotional
dysregulation to medical conditions, this theoretical and clinical
framework might be implemented as a valid prevention
program for populations at high-risk (e.g., tobacco smokers
and emotional eaters) of developing severe medical conditions
(e.g., cardiovascular and metabolic obesity-related diseases).
Furthermore, the DBT model could be adapted and carried
out as a psychotherapeutic intervention for patients aﬀected by
chronic physical illness with a relevant impact on emotional
functioning (e.g., chronic pain, diabetes, hypertension, and
rheumatoid arthritis) in order to improve the eﬀects of gold-
standard pharmacological treatments.

Despite these considerations based on robust empirical
evidence, some limitations must be discussed. First of all, future
mediational and longitudinal studies on the general population
should be carried out in order to empirically support the
hypothesis concerning physiological and behavioral pathways
linking maladaptive emotion regulation strategies to a heightened
risk of developing diﬀerent medical conditions. This should
also be replicated using case-control studies comparing high-risk
or clinical populations with low-risk or healthy controls. The
mediating role of physiological changes, especially concerning
in maladaptive emotion regulation strategies
the HPA axis,
should be investigated with adequate psychophysiological (e.g.,
levels of corticototropin-releasing hormone and cortisol) and
neuroimaging indexes (e.g., adrenal gland volume) (Golden
et al., 2011). Considering comprehensive, valid assessment
procedures, future studies should include neuropsychological
measures of impulsivity (e.g., GO NO-GO task; IOWA gambling
task) (Rochat et al., 2018) in order to support the behavioral

pathway linking maladaptive emotion regulation strategies to
the onset and maintenance of medical conditions, especially
chronic ones. An additional
limitation is the absence of
empirical data regarding the improvement of co-occurrent
physical illness among BPD patients treated with standard DBT
or DBT skills training as a stand-alone treatment. Therefore,
future clinical trials on the DBT model
for the treatment
of BPD should include the assessment of medical conditions
and their remission as a relevant outcome for testing the
eﬃcacy of the intervention. Ultimately, there are no clinical
studies regarding the implementation of the DBT model as
a structured psychotherapeutic intervention supporting well-
validated pharmacological
treatments for diﬀerent medical
diseases. Hence, future empirical adaptions of the DBT model are
needed to sustain the theoretical considerations discussed in the
current work, especially regarding the eﬀectiveness of this clinical
framework for long-term remission of several physical illnesses.

CONCLUSION

Empirical evidence suggests that physiological alterations and
unhealthy behaviors to suppress or avoid emotional states
play a role in the mutual relationship between maladaptive
emotion regulation strategies and the onset and maintenance of
several chronic physical diseases. These functional relationships
are particularly expressed among individuals with BPD, who
show high levels of emotional and behavioral dysregulation.

aﬀected by diﬀerent physical diseases are needed in order
