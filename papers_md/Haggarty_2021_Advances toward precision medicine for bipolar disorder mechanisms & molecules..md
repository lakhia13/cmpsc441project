Abstract

Given its chronicity, contribution to disability and morbidity, and prevalence of more than 2%, 
the effective treatment, and prevention of bipolar disorder represents an area of significant 
unmet medical need. While more than half a century has passed since the introduction of 
lithium into widespread use at the birth of modern psychopharmacology, that medication 
remains a mainstay for the acute treatment and prevention of recurrent mania/hypomania and 
depression that characterize bipolar disorder. However, the continued limited understanding of 
how lithium modulates affective behavior and lack of validated cellular and animal models have 
resulted in obstacles to discovering more effective mood stabilizers with fewer adverse side 
effects. In particular, while there has been progress in developing new pharmacotherapy for 
mania, developing effective treatments for acute bipolar depression remain inadequate. Recent 
large-scale human genetic studies have confirmed the complex, polygenic nature of the risk 
architecture of bipolar disorder, and its overlap with other major neuropsychiatric disorders. Such 
discoveries have begun to shed light on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Coupled with 
broader advances in human neurobiology, neuropharmacology, noninvasive neuromodulation, and 
clinical trial design, we can envision novel therapeutic strategies informed by defined molecular 
mechanisms and neural circuits and targeted to the root cause of the pathophysiology. Here, we 
review recent advances toward the goal of better treatments for bipolar disorder, and we outline

Inadequate nature of current treatments for bipolar disorder

With a lifetime prevalence estimate of more than 2% [3], BPD is a common 
neuropsychiatric disorder representing one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, 
impacting individuals, their families, and society as a whole [4, 5]. While episodes of mania 
in BPD are increasingly effectively managed through a number of medications, including 
antipsychotics, recurrent major depressive episodes continue to represent a significant 
challenge in clinical practice. Longitudinal studies indicate that some individuals with 
bipolar I and II disorder are burdened by significant depressive symptoms, syndromal or 
subsyndromal, for much of their course despite standard treatments [6, 7]. These symptoms 
contribute to the substantial morbidity and mortality observed in BPD, including persistent 
functional impairment [8] as well as suicide [9]. National and international treatment 
guidelines recognize the challenges in treating BPD, particularly depression, as existing 
mood stabilizers are only effective at reducing depressive symptoms in ~1/3 of patients 
[10–13]. Standard antidepressants have repeatedly failed to show benefit in randomized, 
placebo-controlled trials [13, 14]. Lithium [1], considered a gold standard treatment in 
preventing recurrence by all major guidelines, nonetheless does not consistently show 
superiority to placebo for treatment of depression. Lamotrigine also failed to separate 
consistently from placebo in large acute depression monotherapy trials [15]. While some 
atypical antidepressants have demonstrated efficacy for BPD, they benefit only a subset of 
individuals [16–19], while metabolic risks are substantial [20] and rates of discontinuation 
are high [21]. Taken together, there is a clear need to advance the discovery of treatments for 
BPD, for acute episodes as well as prevention of recurrence.

Challenge of modeling & target identification for bipolar disorder

The development of therapeutics for BPD continues to be a challenge due to the limited 
understanding of the mechanism of action of existing therapeutics, their polypharmacology, 
and the lack of validated cellular and animal models that are etiologically based [4, 22, 23]. 
While recognizing no nonhuman model will be able to fully capture the complexity and full 
range of symptoms relevant to BPD [22], advances in three main areas seeking to develop 
innovative new model systems to investigate the pathophysiology of BPD and to discover 
novel therapeutic targets have begun to turn the tide on this historical challenge for the field 
of psychopharmacology.

The first is based upon the application of reprogramming technology that now enables the 
generation of genetically accurate, patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as 
novel types of “ex vivo” cellular models [24–33]. In general, 2-dimensional iPSC-derived 
cultures are well suited to the identification of cell autonomous phenotypes that depend 
less on cell-cell interactions, but success in measuring network-level electrophysiological

properties, including lithium-sensitive hyperexcitability phenotypes of BPD patients has 
been reported [28, 32, 34]. Recent advances in the development of protocols for 3-
dimensional cultures of brain organoids have the potential to allow greater investigation 
of cell nonautonomous phenotypes related to higher-order properties due to the greater 
cell-cell interactions inherent to tissue-like architectures [35]. These models bring their 
own challenges regarding variability and heterogeneity, but standardization of protocols 
has significantly improved these features and will continue to in the future [36]. A major 
limitation to date of the studies published to date is the relatively small number of 
patients that have been characterized, particularly given the recognition that line-to-line 
variability can be substantial. Multiple efforts are underway in the community to expand to 
much larger sample sizes in the hundreds. For example, one publicly-available biobank 
includes more than 400 patient-derived iPSC lines (among them ~80 individuals with 
bipolar disorder) [37], including neurocognitive testing and self-report battery capturing 
NIMH Research Domain Criteria features [38, 39]. In conjunction with performing detailed 
clinicopathological phenotyping, this generation of a “living library” of BPD patient cells 
opens up new avenues to elucidate the underlying neurobiology of BPD and to aid in the 
discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, understanding the ex vivo response of 
patients as assessed using iPSC-derived, or additionally or alternatively other peripheral cells 
such as primary lymphocytes, ultimately at the single cell level [40], in advance of in vivo 
testing has the potential order to reveal stratified, subpopulations of individuals likely to 
respond differentially and thereby facilitate clinical investigation [41].

Second, based upon an emerging genetic understanding of risk factors for BPD, new rodent 
models have begun to be characterized with lithium and related pharmacological agents. An 
excellent example of this advance that provides a direct link to the potential etiological basis 
of BPD as supported by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comes from 
studies of the ankyrin 3 gene (ANK3) encoding the adaptor protein Ankyrin-G (AnkG). 
While the precise mechanisms of the genetic association remain unclear, BPD-associated 
SNPs have elevated brain-specific expression patterns and there is emerging evidence that 
rare loss-of-function, splice-site SNPs may be protective for BPD [42–44]. Studies of AnkG 
in mouse models have begun to elucidate its potential role in disease pathophysiology, 
connections to key pathways regulating neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, and ability of 
lithium to normalize behavioral abnormalities detected upon AnkG loss of function [45–51].

Finally, as a higher-throughput and lower cost alternative to rodents, zebrafish are being used 
as vertebrate animal model system for characterization of existing and novel agents for BPD 
through both quantitative behavioral [52] and functional imaging studies that combined the 
generation of large-scale brain activity maps through the use of transgenic zebrafish with 
a genetically encoded calcium indicator, utilizing machine learning for predictive analysis 
[53].

Lithium & the GSK3 hypothesis: pathways & probes

A long-standing hypothesis concerning the mechanism of action of lithium relevant to the 
treatment of BPD is that of the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) family of 
serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of the two paralogs GSK3[alpha] and GSK3[beta]

[54–56]. GSK3 activity is dynamically regulated through the combined effects of activating 
autophosphorylation of Tyr279/216 ([alpha] and [beta] isoforms respectively), its inhibitory 
phosphorylation on Ser21/9 ([alpha] and [beta] isoforms, respectively) on its N-terminal tail, 
and the activity of protein phosphatase that counteract its phospho-inhibition.

At the biochemical level, lithium has been shown to directly inhibit GSK3 kinase activity 
through competition for magnesium in the ATP binding site of GSK3 [54, 55, 57]. 
In addition, lithium indirectly inhibits GSK3 kinase activity through activation of the 
AKT kinase family of kinases leading to N-terminal, inhibitory phosphorylation and the 
inhibition of phosphatases that dephosphorylate GSK3 [56, 58–61]. Outside of cellular 
and rodent studies, additional support for the relevance of GSK3 comes from studies of 
peripheral blood of BPD patients treated with lithium that also show elevated N-terminal 
inhibitory GSK3 phosphorylation levels [62, 63]. Furthermore, multiple structurally distinct 
antipsychotics and antidepressants indirectly modulate GSK3 activity [56, 64, 65]. Despite 
this growing knowledge, since the precise mechanisms of GSK3 relevant for regulation 
of affective behavior remain incompletely understood, the elucidation of lithium-sensitive 
neural substrates and downstream pathways remain an active area of investigation [56, 59, 
66–72].

WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin signaling pathways

One of the early cellular pathways implicated in lithium’s regulation of neuroplasticity as 
a result of GSK3 inhibition is that of WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin signaling [54, 55, 
67]. Here GSK3 inhibition leads to reduced phosphorylation and attenuated proteasomal 
degradation of [beta]-catenin, resulting in accumulation of [beta]-catenin in the cytoplasm, 
its interaction with membrane-localized, cell-adhesion molecules like cadherin [73], as 
well as the translocation of [beta]-catenin to the nucleus where it acts as an activator of 
transcription of TCF/LEF-dependent genes that form the basis of canonical WNT signaling 
pathway [66, 67, 71, 72, 74–76]. WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin signaling also plays 
a fundamental role in memory consolidation [77] and regulating neurogenesis [75, 76, 
78–80]. Besides GSK3 inhibition pharmacologically or genetically, the overexpression of 
[beta]-catenin itself has been shown to cause an antidepressant-like phenotype in the forced 
swim test of behavioral despair in mice [70]. However, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, 
which occurs over a much longer time frame, is not necessary for the response to 
lithium in mouse behavioral assays like the forced swim test in which acute lithium 
administration is effective [81]. In the treatment of BPD though, the onset of clinical 
benefit of lithium generally requires weeks of administration leaving open the possibility of 
the contribution of neurogenesis and other adaptive changes. Finally, besides evidence that 
lithium can modulate WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin signaling that may be of relevance 
for its therapeutic effects in BPD, a number of rare genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric 
disorders are also known to regulate or be regulated by WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin 
signaling [82–84]. In particular, loss of function mutations in the CTNNB1 gene encoding 
[beta]-catenin are now recognized as a frequent cause of intellectual disability and autism 
spectrum disorder [85, 86], which further points to the fundamentally important role of 
[beta]-catenin in the neurocircuits important for brain development and cognition.

[beta]-Arrestin-2/AKT/PP2A-GSK3 signaling

In addition to lithium’s regulation of WNT/GSK3[beta]/[beta]-catenin, elegant studies from 
the Caron and Beaulieu laboratories have shown that multiple lithium-sensitive behaviors, 
in particular amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, requires the scaffolding protein [beta]-
arrestin 2, which forms a complex with protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) and AKT 
leading to AKT dephosphorylation and inactivation in response to dopamine D2 receptor 
activation in a manner that can be antagonized by lithium treatment [66, 71, 87]. Building 
off these studies, Klein and colleagues have now shown using both pharmacological 
inhibitors and in vivo genetic approaches involving the overexpression or loss of one 
copy of the GSK3[beta] gene, that GSK3 activity is a critical regulator of the stability 
of the [beta]-arrestin-2/AKT/PP2A complex with lithium disrupting this complex and 
GSK3[beta] overexpression restoring the complex in lithium treated mice [88]. Since 
the activity of PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT can in turn 
lead to elevated GSK3 activity due to a loss of reduced inhibitory Ser9/21 N-terminal 
tail phosphorylation, the disruption of the stability [beta]-arrestin-2/AKT/PP2A complex 
by lithium would serve to amplify its direct inhibitory effects on GSK3. In line with 
these findings, using acute administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of AKT, Pan et 
al. [72] have demonstrated that AKT kinase activity is required for lithium to regulate 
inhibitory GSK3 phosphorylation and affective behaviors in mice with the viral-mediated 
expression of activated AKT shown conversely to confer lithium responsively both to 
cultured cell lines and a strain of mice that does not normally respond behaviorally to 
lithium. In contrast, when GSK3 was inhibited directly using the selective, ATP-competitive 
inhibitor CHIR099021, a requirement for AKT activation was no longer observed for the 
behavioral effects of lithium in either lithium responsive or non-responsive mouse strains 
[72]. Collectively, while the precise mechanisms remain uncertain, the findings implicating 
a key role for AKT activity and the disruption of [beta]-arrestin-2/AKT/PP2A complex in 
response to lithium could possibly explain how such a weak direct inhibitor of GSK3 as 
lithium has sufficiently robust pharmacodynamic effects to control affective behavior in the 
context of BPD. Such interwoven and specific mechanisms suggest potentially important 
aspects of lithium’s specificity at the level of neurocircuits since not all cell types appear to 
form [beta]-arrestin-2/AKT/PP2A complexes [71, 88]. In support of the latter notion, studies 
using cell-type selective Cre-recombinase expressing mice and floxed GSK3 alleles [89, 
90], as well as with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering [91], have demonstrated 
that the hyperlocomotory response to amphetamine is dependent on GSK3[beta] activity 
specifically in dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs). These 
MSNs mediate neurotransmission within the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia circuit, 
separate from dopamine D1 receptor-expressing MSNs within the direct pathway where the 
loss of GSK3[beta] had no effect on the response to amphetamine. Besides lithium, there 
is further evidence for the therapeutic relevance of antagonizing [beta]-arrestin-2 complexes 
coming from studies of antipsychotics targeting the dopamine D2 receptor many of which 
are commonly used to treat BPD [92]. Finally, to expand this notion of neurocircuits outside 
those formed by dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons, similar studies inactivating 
GSK3[beta] selectively in forebrain, pyramidal neurons of mice have revealed enhanced 
social interaction and anxiolytic-like effects [90]. These findings pointing to a broader role

of GSK3[beta] activity in aspects of neurotransmission that are potentially relevant to mood 
and anxiety symptoms in BPD. In support of this notion, the anxiolytic-like effects of 
GSK3[beta] inhibition have been further revealed through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic 
knockout in medial prefrontal cortex neurons of adult mice [93]. These behavioral effects 
occurred in concert with reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission through reduction of 
AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and were mimicked by overexpression of 
FXR1P (fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1), an RNA binding protein that is 
a known phospho-substrate regulated by GSK3[beta] [93, 94]. Beyond anxiolytic effects, 
the cell-type-specific deletion of GSK3[beta] in dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons 
has been shown to have pro-cognitive effects in a test of working memory impairment 
due to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (MK-801) treatment [95]. In 
concert, the resistance to cognitive dysfunction was related to alterations of synaptic 
plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex with NMDA receptor activity increased in layer V 
pyramidal neurons, enhanced dopamine-dependent modulation of NMDA receptor currents, 
and increased dendritic spine density of layer V pyramidal neurons [95]. These changes in 
NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity were further related to elevated expression 
levels of GRIN2A and GRIN2B in a manner correlated with chromatin modifications 
(elevated histone H3 Lys18 and Lys27 acetylation) in the corresponding promoter regions 
[95]. Although the precise causal relationship to the pro-cognitive effects of GSK3[beta] 
ablation in D2 receptor expressing neurons and mechanistic basis is unclear, these changes 
in epigenetic status of the NMDA receptor subunits were associated with a reduction of total 
levels and the specific loss at the GRIN2B promoter of HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) [95], 
a major suppressor of synaptic plasticity and target for pro-cognitive and mood stabilizing 
therapeutic development [96–107]. Overall, these findings further emphasize the potential 
developmental- and cell-type-specific effects of deletion of GSK3[beta] such that the age 
of the mouse and neurocircuit being targeted are important factors when extrapolating the 
relevance of mouse model studies to novel therapeutic development.

Advances in pharmacological targeting & imaging of GSK3

To further advance the pharmacological targeting of GSK3 from a neuropsychiatric 
disease perspective continued efforts have largely focused on the development of GSK3 
inhibitors with different levels of potency, selectivity (including between the two isoforms 
GSK3[alpha] and GSK3[beta]), and modes of action [72, 82, 108–113]. For example, 
Wagner et al. have reported highly selective, brain penetrant, and behaviorally active 
GSK3 inhibitors that have lithium-like effects in cellular assays and behavioral models 
of psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity [108, 111]. Similarly, in a study addressing 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies Griebel et 
al. [112] reported on a novel, potent GSK3 inhibitor SAR502250 that reduced the 
depressive-like state of mice in a chronic mild stress paradigm, attenuated aggression in a 
mouse defense test and decreased psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity. In addition, using 
structure-guided drug design and an integrated panel of cell-based assays, including ones 
assessing GSK3 substrate phosphorylation in human iPSC-derived neuronal cells, Bernard-
Gauthier et al. [113] recently described the development of a series of highly potent and 
selective, brain-penetrant oxazole-4-carboxamide-based inhibitors of GSK3. This included

OCM-51, one of the most potent (picomolar IC50) and selective (>tenfold GSK3[beta] vs. 
GSK3[alpha]) GSK3[beta] inhibitor known to date [113]. The achievement of picomolar-
selective GSK3[beta] inhibition, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of achieving at 
least 10-fold [beta]-isozyme specificity, is a significant advance over mostly double-digit 
nanomolar inhibitors of GSK3 that lacked selectivity. To allow neuroimaging of GSK3, 
these studies also radiolabeled the lead compound OCM-44, which showed excellent brain 
exposure in rodent pharmacokinetic studies with equal partitioning between brain tissue 
and plasma, and performed microdosed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 
nonhuman primates [113]. The continued optimization of this series of GSK3 inhibitors as 
PET tracers and progression into human studies is ongoing and may provide a critically 
needed tool to help address in vivo target engagement of GSK3 inhibitors to aid in finding 
appropriate doses and administration schedules.

While improvement in potency and selectivity along with the synthesis of PET tracers 
for assessing in vivo target engagement are important developments for the field’s efforts 
to advance GSK3 inhibitors, a number of other critical hurdles remain to be addressed. 
While details of multiple GSK3 programs that were initiated but terminated have not been 
disclosed, a recent summary of studies by AstraZeneca outlined the challenges encountered 
in progressing efficacious and safe compounds that had been originally being developed 
for the purpose of treating Alzheimer’s disease starting in 2003 [109, 114]. While highly 
potent (Ki 5–30 nM) and orally bioactive compounds within different structural classes were 
identified that showed in vivo efficacy in preclinical models assessing tau phosphorylation 
and precognitive effects, preclinical toxicological effects on the musculoskeletal system, as 
well as histopathological changes in the gallbladder and cholecystitis observed in dogs and 
biliary hyperplasia in rats, required abandoning clinical development of multiple compound 
series [114]. This included the compound AZD1080 that was demonstrated in a Phase I 
clinical trial in healthy controls to show GSK3 target engagement in peripheral cells and 
was reported to be well tolerated, but without a sufficient exposure margin its further 
development was forced to halt [109].

With these pre-clinical and clinical issues in mind, numerous opportunities still exist to 
tackle selective GSK3 inhibition with different modes of inhibition, including allosteric 
inhibitors and substrate competitive inhibitors. An alternative approach can tackle enhancing 
safety by tuning the pharmacokinetic properties, including enhanced brain to plasma ratios 
and minimized peripheral target engagement. Understanding the key substrates driving the 
neurobehavioral effects of GSK3 inhibition provides the potential to guide the clinical 
development of a new generation of efficacious and safe GSK3 inhibitors by allowing 
optimization of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. In addition, since the 
kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrates can vary widely, having 
knowledge of the pharmacodynamics will enable exploration of appropriate alternative 
dosing regimens to maximize efficacy and enhance safety.

Novel target discovery via lithium mimetics

As an alternative to a direct GSK3 inhibitor, one approach to understanding the 
therapeutically relevant mechanism of action of lithium is to identify pharmacological

“lithium mimetics” that recapitulate the effect of lithium on specific molecular targets in 
order to determine whether such agents have similar neurochemical and behavioral effects. 
Such a screening strategy may also yield a lithium ‘enhancer’ that improves the benefit of 
a lower dose of lithium, which given its narrow therapeutic index could reduce toxicity, 
or restore lithium responsivity to patients that are refractory or lose sensitivity to lithium, 
thereby broadening the clinical population that could obtain benefit. While therapeutically 
lithium represents a gold standard, pharmacologically it poses challenges as a target because 
of the complexity of its effects-- that is, the wide variety of effects in vitro raises the 
possibility that mirroring its effects on a single target pathway may have no therapeutic 
relevance. To attempt to refute this hypothesis, a number of innovative approaches have been 
taken aiming to discover pharmacological probes with potential for clinical translation.

Targeting phospho-CRMP2

In an effort to identify lithium mimetics, Tobe et al. [30] recently demonstrated that 
p-CRMP2T514, the inactivated form of Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), 
was elevated in lithium-responsive BPD patient iPSC-derived neuronal models as compared 
with nonlithium responsive BPD patients, as well as patients with other psychiatric and 
neurological disorders. This particular phospho-substrate of GSK3 is of interest based upon 
global quantitative proteomic profiling in human iPSC-derived neuronal cells using stable 
isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) methodology that showed it to 
be one of the most highly regulated phosphoproteins in response to treatment with the 
selective GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 [115], which has been shown to have lithium-like 
effects in mouse behavioral models [72]. Previous biochemical and cellular studies have 
also shown that p-CRMP2T514 is regulated by GSK3[beta] and not GSK3[alpha] and that its 
phosphorylation levels is regulated by lithium and other GSK3 inhibitors in rodent neurons 
[116, 117]. In addition, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering in mice, a double 
knockout of GSK3[beta] and CRMP2 in dopamine D2 receptor-expressing MSNs was 
demonstrated to block the suppression of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity that occurs 
when GSK3[beta] is knocked out in the same dopamine D2 receptor-expressing MSN in a 
manner that lead to decreased dendritic branching complexity and spine density [91]. These 
data further implicate a critical role for GSK3[beta]’s regulation of neurotransmission in 
MSN within the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia as a critical regulator of affective 
behavior [89, 91].

Since these collective data strongly suggest that CRMP2 serves as a key neural substrate 
downstream of GSK3[beta] that regulates the neurocircuitry involved in affective behaviors 
in mouse models, and since p-CRMP2T514 levels served as robust marker of GSK3[beta] 
inhibition in human neurons, Zhao et al. [115] performed an unbiased screen of a 
chemogenomic library for novel regulators of p-CRMP2T514. This screen yielded both 
known GSK3 inhibitors, many of which were previously shown to have lithium-like 
effects in the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity model, as well as a series of nondirect 
GSK3[beta] modulators that decreased p-CRMP2T514 levels, like lithium, both in neural 
progenitor cells (NPCs) and post-mitotic neurons. This latter class included both FDA-
approved drugs, which have the potential for more readily being repurposed for testing in

the clinic, as well as novel natural products and bioactive probes not previously shown to 
regulate CRMP2 activity.

In connecting ex vivo iPSC-derived assay results to in vivo data with intact neurocircuits, 
systemic administration of a subset, but not all, of the CRMP2-phosphorylation suppressors 
was found to mimic lithium’s attenuation of amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in 
mice. For example, of the class of non-GSK3[beta] targeting p-CRMP2T514 suppressors that 
were identified, NNC-711, a reported blocker of GABA uptake via inhibition of SLC6A1 
(solute carrier family 6 member 1; (GAT1)), suppressed amphetamine-induced hyperactivity 
when administered on its own to mice, but showed no additive effect in combination 
with lithium administration. In contrast, the known D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, an 
agent shown in a double-blind comparative study to have equivalent antidepressant activity 
to amitriptyline in BPD patients with recurrent depression that were being treated with 
lithium [118], only suppressed hyperlocomotion when administered in combined with 
lithium. An additional interesting p-CRMP2T514 suppressor identified by this screen was the 
natural product, and widely consumed nutritional supplement, huperzine A, a sesquiterpene 
alkaloid, which suppressed locomotion on its own and showed an additive effect with 
lithium in the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity assay. Mechanistically, huperzine A 
is known to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and to be an antagonist of NMDA receptors, 
and has been investigated as a disease-modifying drug for dementia and shown in a 
series of randomized, controlled trials as an adjunctive treatment to modestly improve 
neurocognitive function in schizophrenia patients [119]. In preclinical mouse models 
of Alzheimer’s disease, huperzine A has been shown to enhance cognition and its 
neuroprotective activities were linked to increased levels of inhibitory GSK3[alpha]S21/
[beta]S9 phosphorylation [120]. Although the precise mechanism through which huperzine 
A suppressed p-CRMP2T514 levels in human neurons is unknown, given recent GWAS 
studies in BPD that have implicated the GRIN2A subunit of the NMDA receptors 
(see below), these findings potentially link together CRMP2 to a genetically implicated 
mechanism in BPD as discussed further above in the context of Ankyrin-G (ANK3) [51]. 
Taken as a whole, further testing of CRMP2 modulating agents may afford a new strategy 
to mimic the effects of lithium and direct GSK3 inhibitors on affective behavior while 
minimizing side effects due to the central role that GSK3 plays in multiple levels of cellular 
physiology.

Targeting inositol monophosphatase

An alternative mechanism to lithium’s GSK3 inhibition that continues to be explored is its 
inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) [121, 122], a key enzyme involved in Gq-
protein coupled receptor and other signaling pathways. While selectively targeting IMPase 
with brain penetrant agents has remained a challenge, recent studies seeking to identify a 
lithium mimetic identified ebselen as a blood-brain barrier-penetrant IMPase inhibitor [123]. 
In preclinical mouse models, ebselen preferentially reduced motor impulsivity over choice 
impulsivity through a mechanism at least in part through inhibition of 5-HT2A receptors 
[124]. Given the relationship of impulsivity to potential suicide risk, and putative suicide- 
and attempt-sparing ability of lithium [125], these data support the lithium mimetic activity 
of ebselen, at least indirectly. In partial support of these pre-clinical data, acute oral ebselen

was shown in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with healthy participants to reduce 
brain myo-inositol in cortical regions and to affect emotional processing, to decrease latency 
time in the acoustic startle paradigm, and to decrease the reinforcement of rewarding stimuli 
along with decreased slow-wave sleep [126]. Other placebo-controlled randomized studies 
in healthy controls also showed that ebselen treatment decreased impulsivity and produced a 
positive bias in emotional processing [127]. Future studies in BPD subjects of ebselen alone 
or in combination with lithium, with assessment of affective symptoms, will be needed to 
determine whether the effects translate to meaningful benefit for patients.

Novel targets & mechanisms emerging from human genetics

Twin studies of BPD indicate that it is highly heritable (~80%); children with an affected 
parent are at increased risk for a variety of symptoms and neurobiological abnormalities 
[128, 129]. In agreement with twin and family studies, recent data from large-scale GWAS 
have confirmed the risk for developing BPD is highly polygenic in nature [129]. This 
polygenicity overlaps incompletely with schizophrenia and other major neuropsychiatric 
disorders [130]. The incomplete overlap is consistent with the diagnostic challenge of 
distinguishing these disorders clinically, as well as the differences in prognosis as well 
as apparent pharmacological specificity. That is, mainstays of treatment in one disorder 
may be entirely ineffective in a genetically related disorder. Lithium is not an effective 
antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia; standard antidepressants remain largely 
ineffective as monotherapy for bipolar depression and may even worsen disease course in 
some individuals.

Simply identifying tens or hundreds of risk loci does not necessarily identify BPD 
treatment targets. Indeed, even largely monogenic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease 
or Huntington’s disease have required substantial work to move from a risk variant to a 
therapeutic strategy. This work may entail intersecting risk loci with knowledge of changes 
in the transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome from patient-derived cell models and post-
mortem tissue [131] - particularly if only common variants, rather than “smoking gun” 
functional variants, have been identified. As of the end of 2019, the most recent GWAS 
of 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls of European descent, with follow-up analysis in an 
additional 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls identified 30 loci as genome-wide significant 
[129]. Subsequently pathway analysis identified nine pathways that were significantly 
enriched for genes with BPD associations, including ones implicated in endocannabinoid 
signaling, regulation of insulin secretion, and motor control [129]. While any of these 
represent potential therapeutic targets [23], more work is required to understand the way 
in which these pathways may contribute either to neurodevelopmental effects, or to acute 
symptomatology, or both.

When considering formulating a therapeutic hypothesis on the basis of these data, the 
complex genetic architecture of BPD presents a number of formidable challenges. First, the 
nature of linkage disequilibrium amongst associated polymorphisms means that the index 
variant may not be the causal variant. Hence, what gene or set of genes to follow up on 
remains unclear in many if not all cases. Resolving the causal variant requires additional 
fine mapping to be performed along with analysis of functional data from transcriptomic

studies and epigenomic studies in order to link the variant to specific cell types, transcripts, 
or genomic regulator elements. On the basis of these data, it may be possible in the future 
to more clearly assign the directionality of the effect in terms of the “gain” or “loss” of 
a particular biological function to guide a clear therapeutic hypothesis. Here, inspirational 
examples come from other areas of medicine where the experiments of nature that genetic 
studies represent have been highly informative through the elucidation of an allelic series 
that points to a clear directionality of the effect and informs a therapeutic hypothesis in 
terms of what the expected physiological result should be by increasing or decreasing 
the target function by a specified amount [132]. The second major challenge comes from 
the fact that the effect size of the majority of the associated loci across the genome are 
small. Recognizing that the effect size is a statistical metric derived from a population 
level analysis the modulation of the function encoded by single genetic risk factor may 
not produce sufficient change to a complex biological system when considered in one 
particular individual’s cells. In addition, given the robustness of biological systems that are 
often buffered from change and subject to constraints for dynamic change in response to 
perturbations, the identification of central, highly connected nodes in networks of interaction 
may be required to ultimately impact the system.

A number of these BPD-associated genes, including GRIN2A, CACNA1C, SCN2A, and 
HDAC5 [129], have available pharmacological probes, including some of which are 
FDA-approved drugs with a history of investigation in the context of bipolar disorders. 
Most notable in this context are the L-type calcium channel antagonists that target the 
[alpha]1c subunit encoded by the CACNA1C gene discussed above as a focus of rodent 
model systems to investigate BPD pathophysiology. Prior to any of the present genetic 
observations concerning L-type calcium channels in BPD, as reviewed recently [133, 134], 
multiple clinical studies of different classes of L-type calcium channel antagonists were 
performed starting in the late 1980s. These agents were either investigated as monotherapy 
or in combination with lithium, an antipsychotic or anticonvulsant, with the majority 
of studies having been performed with verapamil. The overall results have been mixed 
with challenges to the interpretation of the findings due to the varied doses used and 
absence of clear data demonstrating in vivo target engagement in the brain, for example 
from a PET tracer, and mixed pharmacology particularly in the case of verapamil that 
limits precise conclusions regarding contributions of the L-type channel to efficacy as 
compared with other mechanisms [134]. For example, despite promising initial results with 
the dihydropyridine nimodipine, either as a monotherapy or in combination with lithium 
or the anticonvulsant carbamazepine on mania in BPD [135–138], the Phase IIa study 
of MEM-1003, a dihydropyridine of the same class that was defined to exhibit reduced 
peripheral side effects, especially blood pressure lowering, was found to be ineffective as 
a monotherapy for acute mania in BPD. A preliminary study with the dihydropyridine 
isradipine showed promise for this class of pharmacological agents [139].

Recent efforts are seeking to overcome these shortcomings of the earlier studies, for example 
with the Oxford study of Calcium channel Antagonism, Cognition, Mood instability 
and Sleep [140], which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the 
effect of the dihydropyridine LTCC nicardipine in healthy young adults with mood 
instability with a battery of psychiatric, cognitive, circadian, physiological, biochemical, and

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography neuroimaging 
parameters being collected over a 4-week period with subjects stratified by the CACNA1C 
risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1006737. While the benefit of such a study 
is premised upon the directionality of the risk variant in the CACNA1C locus causing 
increased L-type calcium channel activity, this mechanistic detail remains unclear, with 
published data from pre-clinical studies supporting both directionalities. Ultimately, ongoing 
human clinical studies combined with genetic markers stratified based upon risk SNPs 
within the CACNA1C may provide the most relevant, definitive answer to whether selective 
L-type calcium channel antagonists versus potentiators are desired since these will address 
the complex role that such channels play in different cell types of the nervous system.

Another example of a putative risk gene for BPD from the most recent large-scale GWAS 
studies that is of high-interest is the identification of HDAC5 encoding a member of the 
class II histone deacetylase family, though at this stage it has more limited pharmacological 
investigation and there is a need for fine mapping to pinpoint the true causal variant within 
the locus. In previous functional studies in rodent models, Tsankova et al. [141] had shown 
that viral-mediated HDAC5 overexpression in the hippocampus blocked imipramine’s 
ability to reverse depression-like behavior and found that chronic imipramine was associated 
with a selective downregulation of HDAC5. Studies by Renthal et al. [142] also showed 
that chronic but not acute exposure to stress decreased HDAC5 function in the nucleus 
accumbens, a brain region that plays a critical role in brain reward response, and loss of 
HDAC5 caused hypersensitivity to chronic but not acute stress, suggesting its regulation 
may play a causal role in the response to stress. Such observations point to the importance 
of elucidating the particular regions of the brain relevant to BPD pathophysiology that 
a putative genetic risk factor like HDAC5 may be important for, since the functional 
consequences of gain and loss of function may be distinct in different brain regions, thereby 
presenting a challenge for conventional pharmacological modulation that may lack brain 
region or cell type specificity. These observations, along with preclinical mouse model data 
looking at both antidepressant-like and antimanic-like activity of selective HDAC inhibitors 
[96–105], as well as the advent of the PET radiotracer [11 C]Martinostat [143] that allows 
for “neuroepigenetic” imaging of HDAC levels in the living human brain of psychiatric 
disease patients [144], support the notion that histone modifications may play a key role in 
the pathophysiology and future treatment of affective disorders.

Beyond specific targets implicated by the peak SNPs in large-scale BPD GWAS, the 
implication of the endocannabinoid system as a potentially important pathway determining 
risk, and most notably the implication of the gene FAAH as one of the key drivers 
of this association, is of potential relevance for therapeutic development [129]. FAAH 
encodes fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme that along with monoacylglyercol lipase 
(MAGL), breaks down endocannabinoids in the brain that serve as endogenous ligands 
of the principal cannabinoid receptors CB1/CB2. As reviewed in Arimand et al. [145], 
inhibition of FAAH and MAGL is the focus of ongoing efforts to develop new treatments 
for pain and neuropsychiatric disorders, including in BPD. Of note, whereas CB1 receptors 
are localized both pre- and post-synaptically on neurons throughout the nervous system, 
CB2 receptors are located largely peripherally in immune system cells and microglia 
with evidence that CB2 receptor agonist may have anti-neuroinflammatory properties

through the ability to suppress microglial activation and cytokine release [146]. This has 
led to the suggestion that potentiating CB2 receptor activity, either directly or through 
modulating the endocannabinoid system, may produce a novel pharmacotherapy that targets 
neuroinflammatory dysfunction in BPD [145]. Last, the implication of the regulation of 
insulin secretion in the pathway analysis with a broad set of potentially key driver genes 
[129], including calcium channel subunits (CACNA1C, CACNA1D), the dopamine receptor 
D2 (DRD2) that encodes the primary target of multiple atypical antipsychotics already 
clinically used to treat BPD, cyclic AMP regulated kinase and regulatory enzymes (PRKCA, 
ADCY2, PDE3B), and potassium ion channel subunits (KCNB1, KCNC2, KCNS3, 
KCNG2), is of interest given the existing and potential for novel pharmacological agents 
targeting these factors. Moreover, previous double-blinded, controlled trials of intranasal 
insulin on neurocognitive function in euthymic BPD patients suggests the potential for 
investigating this pathway more systematically in conjunction with the new knowledge of 
genetic variation that may determine response and thus be used to stratify patients [147].

Novel targets & mechanisms emerging from classical neuropharmacology

Since the findings from human genetics of BPD have only recently begun to resolve 
themselves into recognizable pathways, and multiple steps are still required to translate 
these findings into a clear therapeutic hypothesis [132], another path to continue to 
discover potential new therapies for BPD is to advance human experimental therapeutic 
trials with novel mechanism of action medications that have emerged from classical 
neuropharmacology, often interventions that are first FDA-approved for other indications.

A recent example of this effort is that of lurasidone, which was first approved as 
an antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia in 2010 with the desire of minimizing 
undesired side effects, namely extrapyramidal and metabolic effects, that plague first- and 
second-generation antipsychotics, respectively. Rather than pursuing mania as an indication, 
typically the path for preceding antipsychotics, lurasidone was approved in 2013 for the 
treatment of bipolar depression in adults as a monotherapy and as an adjunct therapy with 
either lithium or valproate [148] and then most recently in 2018 for bipolar depression 
in pediatric patients (aged 10–17) [149]. Lurasidone exhibits a mixed pharmacology 
showing high affinity binding as an antagonist to the dopamine D2, 5-HT2A, 5-HT7, and 
[alpha]2c adrenergic receptors, along with partial agonism of the 5-HT1A receptor [150]. 
Intriguingly, besides efficacy for treatment of bipolar depression, preliminary, randomized, 
open-label studies of cognition in euthymic patients with BPD suggest lurasidone is able 
to ameliorate cognitive impairment [151], and a 3-week, a double-blind, controlled study in 
schizophrenia patients also reported pro-cognitive effects for lurasidone whereas the atypical 
antipsychotic ziprasidone did not [152]. These observations, along with preclinical studies 
in rodent models showing that lurasidone, but not other antipsychotics such as ziprasidone, 
risperidone, aripiprazole, clozapine and haloperidol can suppress MK-801-induced cognitive 
deficits and shown other procognitive properties [150, 153, 154], point to potentially 
unique properties of this compound. Exploration of the underlying molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of the pro-cognitive effects of lurasidone could open up a critically needed 
new path to agents for BPD and related neuropsychiatric disorders. To this end, studies in 
patient-derived iPSC models and related systems are now underway with promising findings

pointing to differences in pathways critical for synaptic plasticity (SJH, RK, unpublished 
observations). More generally, work with lurasidone highlights efforts to find treatments that 
improve cognition in BPD, a complex set of impairments that may represent trait markers of 
the disease, compounded by state effects and particularly by other medications [155]. Such 
impairments contribute to the functional consequences and chronicity of bipolar disorder but 
have previously been underappreciated in light of the more evident mood symptoms.

Outside of lithium and atypical antipsychotics, BPD is often treated with anticonvulsant 
agents such as lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine. While the mechanistic rationale 
for the efficacy of some anticonvulsants but not others remains unclear, the proven 
clinical efficacy of such anticonvulsant agents suggests the value of continuing to explore 
the potential for repurposing new mechanism of action anticonvulsants as adjunctive or 
monotherapy. An exemplar of this strategy is recent studies being pursued in the context 
of BPD with lacosamide. Here, Cuomo et al. [156] have reported results of an open-label 
study of more than 100 individuals with acute BPD treated with lacosamide compared with 
a retrospective analysis of a BPD sample treated with other antiepileptics. While the study 
design limits firm conclusions, lacosamide was suggested to be well-tolerated and effective 
in reducing mania, depression, and anxiety and in improving global functioning, at doses of 
lower than those typically used in epilepsy [156].

Mechanistically, lacosamide is thought to target voltage-gated sodium channels, but unlike 
other anticonvulsants it does so through a unique mechanism of enhancing the slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels rather than through affecting their fast 
inactivation. While the mechanism through which this slow inactivation of sodium channels 
is not fully understood, of potential relevance is the fact that lacosamide has also been 
recently shown to modulate CRMP2 [157]. As discussed above, CRMP2 has emerged 
as a neural substrate sensitive to lithium and GSK3[beta] inhibitors and appears to be 
differentially regulated in BPD iPSC-derived neuronal models [30, 115]. Since CRMP2 can 
regulate microtubule dynamics [157], which may be involved in the regulation of the slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, future studies on lacosamide’s mechanism 
of action and testing of CMRP2 modulating small molecules, along with larger, placebo-
controlled randomized trials may yield a new mechanism for BPD pharmacotherapy.

Following a similar line of reasoning, besides lacosamide, additional novel anticonvulsant 
agents in the category that merit further investigation in BPD for benefit include: (1) 
rufinamide, an agent approved for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome whose use in BPD 
is supported by two case reports of potential mood stabilizing effects with a mechanism 
of action not conclusively known but may involve antagonism of voltage-gated sodium 
channels [158]; and (2) ezogabine (retigabine) [159], an opener of voltage-gated KCNQ/Kv7 
potassium channels approved as an add-on medication to treat seizures associated with 
epilepsy, which has been shown by in an open-label trial to have an acute antimanic effect 
in a subset of BPD patients [160], as well as demonstrated to have antimanic like activity 
in both the amphetamine plus chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperactivity model and repeated 
sensitization amphetamine-induced hyperactivity model [161–163].

Targeting trace amine-associated receptors

Outside of ideas for novel BPD pharmacotherapies emerging from consideration of 
anticonvulsants, recent studies have suggested Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 
(TAAR1) activation as a potential novel class of antipsychotics [164]. While not dependent 
on dopamine D2 receptor antagonism for efficacy, mechanistic evidence indicates the 
activation of TAAR1-D2R heterodimers induces biased signaling through [beta]-arrestin-
mediated mechanisms leading to a reduction of GSK3[beta] signaling [165], providing 
evidence independent from that of lithium for the importance of [beta]-arrestin-mediated 
regulation of GSK3 [71, 88]. Previous studies in both C. elegans and mice have also 
suggested that trace amine pathways signaling through TAAR1 are important for clozapine’s 
behavioral effects [166]. Together, these data suggest that, in addition to their current 
development as novel mechanism of action antipsychotics, there may be utility in 
considering TAAR1 agonists as BPD treatments. In particular, combinations of TAAR1 
agonists and lithium may yield an effective therapeutic and one that would enable lowering 
of the lithium dose, along with potential restoration of lithium sensitivity among otherwise 
non-responsive patients.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Another example of pharmacological agents outside of the anticonvulsants and more 
traditional ion channel and monoamine receptors that are the targets of current agents and 
ones in development, an intriguing example of a class of natural product supplements of 
potential interest for BPD therapeutic development are the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Deficits in these omega-3 
fatty acids have long been associated with the pathophysiology of BPD [167, 168]. Studies 
in preclinical animal models support the notion that omega-3 fatty acids promote synaptic 
maturation and plasticity in developing cortical brain circuits and their deficiency can lead 
to aberrant network connectivity. For example, a preclinical study in a nonhuman primate 
model using resting-state functional connectivity MRI demonstrated that lower levels of 
omega-3 fatty acids were associated with decreased functional connectivity in cortical 
regions critical for cognitive function [169].

In terms of treatment trials using omega-3 fatty acids as a dietary supplements in BPD, 
as reviewed in Saunders et al. [168], a total of five nonrandomized and open-label studies 
of omega-3 supplementation in bipolar disorder that consisted of administration of either 
of mixture of DHA and EPA or EPA alone found beneficial effects on clinical measures 
related to mood in four of the five studies. In contrast to these encouraging results, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation 
have been more varied with benefit observed in only two of the seven studies. However, 
multiple methodological differences in potentially critical variables such as the dose of 
the supplement, the exact nature of the ratio of EPA to DHA (and other fatty acids), 
concurrent pharmacotherapy, design of trials in addition to heterogeneity of diagnosis make 
this comparison of studies problematic, thus leaving open the question of the benefit of 
omega-3 fatty acids.

With these issues in mind, Zhao et al. [170] recently described the results of studies of DHA 
using human iPSC-derived NPCs and post-mitotic neurons to gain insight into the molecular 
and cellular mechanisms that may underlie the potential beneficial therapeutic effect of 
DHA on synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity, as well as to develop functional 
biomarkers that could be used to guide future experimental therapeutic trials in terms of 
optimal dosing and schedule of administration. These studies demonstrated, for the first 
time in the context of a living human neuron, that exposure to DHA at physiologically 
relevant levels led to a dose-dependent, significant upregulation of both CREB and WNT 
signaling pathways along with a dose-dependent gene-expression signature. Using live-cell 
imaging, they also showed that DHA treatment enhanced viability of proliferating NPCs and 
the complexity of axonal and dendritic branching on differentiating iPSC-derived neurons 
[170]. These studies provided direct experimental evidence that exposure of human neuronal 
cells to DHA can have a potentially beneficial effect on critical pathways regulating 
neuroplasticity. With the growing number of approved prescription omega-3 fatty acid 
products being used to treat hypertriglyceridema [171] it may be possible in the near future 
to leverage epidemiological data from BPD patients taking these agents and be beneficial to 
perform trials with purified omega-3 fatty acids, alone or in combination with other agents, 
rather than more complex mixtures derived from marine sources.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)

An additional target of potential relevance for BPD pharmacotherapy that connects to 
a different area of neurobiology through metabolism and mitochondrial function is that 
of the family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their regulation 
by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha [172]. As PPAR 
agonists have been developed and are clinically used as anti-diabetic agents in the case of 
the thiazolidines and anti-triglyceride fibrates (PPAR agonists), this has allowed both open-
label and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with promising results [173, 
174]. An additional proof-of-concept trial of bezafibrate for bipolar depression coupled with 
resting state fMRI analysis as a marker of neuronal changes is currently being performed 
[172].

Psilocybin and psychedelics

The use of psilocybin, a functionally selective, serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist (with 
additional effects on other serotonin receptors), which occurs naturally in over 200 known 
mushroom species through biosynthesis from L-tryptophan, is an area of growing interest 
in the context of treatment-resistant, unipolar depression, along with a range of other 
neuropsychiatric conditions, including alcohol dependence and anxiety [175]. Early, albeit 
still small, studies suggest have shown the safety and rapid efficacy of psilocybin in 
patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression [176, 177]. The psychedelic effects 
of psilocybin have been shown to correlate with 5-HT2A receptor occupancy [178]. 
Plasma levels of the pharmacologically active psilocin derived from dephosphorylation 
of the prodrug psilocybin, and blood oxygen-level dependent resting-state functional 
connectivity measured with fMRI have shown changes in depressed patients upon psilocybin 
administration [176]. Hence, psilocybin and its derivatives may be of interest to investigate

in the context of safety and placebo-controlled, randomized trials in BPD, particularly 
those with depression. Interestingly, earlier placebo-controlled, randomized studies in acute 
BPD mania with L-tryptophan [179], the biosynthetic precursor for both serotonin (5-
hydroxytryptamine) and psilocybin, suggested a beneficial effect, as did similar studies 
examining dietary L-tryptophan on affective behavior where decreased depressive and 
anxiety symptoms were observed [180].

Chronotherapeutic targets regulating biological rhythms

Disturbed sleep appears to be an early symptom of bipolar disorder [181], and growing 
evidence suggests that changes in sleep and daytime activity that are characteristic features 
of mania and depressive states are core features of BPD [182–184]. This is of clinical 
relevance as changes in sleep have been shown to be highly predictive of impending 
affective instability [185]. Although large-scale human genetic studies have failed to date 
to provide robust support for direct involvement of classical circadian genes (e.g., PER2), 
these clinical observations, on top of the evidence that lithium can have a beneficial 
effect on circadian abnormalities in BPD, in particular delaying sleeping-wake phase 
rhythms, suggests a potentially important area of investigation is the development of 
“chronotherapeutics” that seek to normalize abnormalities in biological rhythms that may 
be at the core of the disease pathophysiology [186–188].

Support for the notion that stabilizing circadian rhythms may be therapeutically beneficial 
in BPD has emerged from efforts to target melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. In a small, 
open-label, adjunctive study with the MT1/MT2 agonist agomelatine, within a week of 
treatment there was a beneficial response to more than 80% of the subjects, although 
multiple patients over an extended time period of one year experienced adverse effects 
and 4 patients who were on lithium at the same time experienced manic or hypomanic 
episodes [189]. These findings have been extended in additional open-label trials with 
similar beneficial response rates [190]. However, a more recent placebo controlled trial of 
adjunctive agomelatine in BPD patients with depression on either lithium or valproate failed 
to show benefit [191], and another randomized controlled trial was unable to demonstrate 
any efficacy of ramelteon, another M1/M2 agonist, as an adjunctive maintenance therapy 
for BPD [192]. These mixed results suggest that alternative mechanisms for modulating 
melatonergic transmission may need to be explored with heterogeneity of the circadian 
abnormalities in BPD potentially providing a barrier to translation without appropriate 
patient stratification.

Challenging a purely pharmaceutical-centric view to developing BPD therapeutics, but 
also potentially highly valuable when considered as an adjunctive treatment or for use 
with treatment-resistant patients, are recent advances in noninvasive approaches to BPD 
therapy that have come through consideration of the impact of light on depressive aspects 
of the disorder [188]. Most notably, exposure to morning bright light treatment for BPD 
depression, often as an adjunct to mood stabilizers, has been repeatedly shown to be 
efficacious and safe, including in two recent randomized placebo-controlled trials, as well 
as with studies that have extended the time period of efficacy of bright light administration 
the midday period [193, 194]. While there is need for careful consideration to prevent a

switch to mania and there are facets that remain to be understood regarding the optimal 
light intensity, wavelength spectrum, duration of exposure and mechanism of action in terms 
of effects on the circadian system and specific neurotransmitter pathways, the noninvasive 
nature of such modality, the rapid onset of benefit of less than a week, and the potential for 
personalizing the treatment for individuals based upon their personal physiology holds much 
promise [186, 188].

As an alternative nonpharmacological, chromotherapeutic strategy to stabilize circadian and 
sleep abnormalities in BPD, efforts are underway to create virtual darkness chronotherapy 
involving the blocking of blue light at critical periods in the night [187, 195]. Blue light 
in the wavelength of 400–500 nm has been shown to activate intrinsically photosensitive 
retinal ganglion cells that respond to blue light due to the expression of the photopigment 
melanopsin that upon interaction with light signals through G-proteins to activate 
phospholipase C leading to opening of TRPC-type ion channels resulting in depolarization 
of the neuron [196]. These neurons project to neurons located within the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus along with other brain regions [197], and through their activity are able to block 
the production of melatonin [198]. Thus, following the rationale that augmenting melatonin 
production at critical periods may normalize the circadian and sleep abnormalities in BPD, 
and with the pharmacology of the melanopsin receptor encoded by the OPN4 gene at 
a nascent stage [199], a particularly promising strategy that has been advanced involves 
simply the wearing of amber colored glasses that block blue light from entering the eye. 
In early studies with this concept, blue light blocking glasses improved sleep in BPD 
patients [200]. More recently, in a pioneering study, a randomized trial in BPD patients 
comparing the adjunctive use of blue-light blocking glasses compared with clear glasses for 
a 1-week period during the evening hours that entailed use of continuous demonstrated a 
rapid onset of antimanic effects within 3 days [201]. In addition to the low cost (~$7.00/pair) 
of the glasses, and the minimal harm that could come from their use, the notion of blue 
light blocking glasses opens up the possibility of potential new personalized strategy for 
prevention of BPD through stabilizing an individual’s biological rhythm disturbances, along 
with other options to reduce one’s exposure to blue light [195].

Reporting summary

There remains much to be learned regarding the neurobiology of BPD, along with a clear 
and present need for innovation by the next generation of neuroscientist, chemical biologist, 
biochemists, geneticists, computational scientists, and clinicians to address this challenge. 
Technological developments on a number of fronts ranging from genome sequencing, 
patient-derived iPSC models, CRISPR/Cas9 and related genome editing and epigenome 
editing techniques, and novel PET imaging probes are examples of unprecedented strategies 
to validate novel neurotherapeutic targets to advance the treatment and prevention of BPD. 
Balanced against the long-term promise of these approaches is the immediate need for better 
therapeutic strategies: waiting for future breakthroughs in neuroscience is simply not an 
option for patients, families, and clinicians seeking treatment today. The elegance of these 
new approaches cannot distract from the clinical imperative.

When contemplating the future, and specifically in weighing the role that technical 
versus conceptual innovation will have in revolutionizing the treatment of complex 
neuropsychiatric disorders like BPD, it is worth pondering lessons from the past in fields 
outside that of psychiatry. One such case is a field far from psychiatry, but one that 
underwent the type of revolutionary change that may be needed to seriously transform 
our understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders: astronomy. Here, individuals 
like Galileo Galilei were pivotal figures for the development of the foundations of modern 
astronomy in embracing the new technology of the telescope to discover a seemingly 
infinitely expansive groups of stars and a set of planets. The long-term impact of Galileo 
and his contribution to society at large, however, was not that he continued to map the 
skies in ever-increasing detail with the latest technical advances in telescopes. Rather, it 
was Galilelo’s scientific challenge to geocentricism and long-standing superstitions that 
ultimately were the catalyst for the change in understanding our place in the cosmos. By 
analogy, researchers in psychiatry should carefully consider the opportunities provided by 
new ‘telescopes’ to overturn outdated dogma and realize the full promise of precision 
medicine.
