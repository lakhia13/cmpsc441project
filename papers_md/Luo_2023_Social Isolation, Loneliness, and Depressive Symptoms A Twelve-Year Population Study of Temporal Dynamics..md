Abstract

Objectives:  Social  isolation  and  loneliness  are  two  different  aspects  of  social  connections. Whether  social  isolation  and 
loneliness precede depressive symptoms, or depressive symptoms precede feelings of loneliness and social isolation, or both, 
has  not  been  fully  established. This  study  aims  to  examine  the  possible  reciprocity  in  the  relationship  between  the  two 
aspects of social connections and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults.
Method:  This study analyzed four waves of data (2008–2016) from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 5,393 individ-
uals) and investigated within-person level cross-lagged associations of social isolation and loneliness with depressive symp-
toms using random intercept cross-lagged panel models.
Results:  This study revealed a unidirectional relationship between social isolation and depressive symptoms and a bidirec-
tional relationship between loneliness and depressive symptoms at the within-person level. Specifically, net of trait levels 
and prior states, earlier state depressive symptoms predicted future state social isolation. That is, when adults feel depressed 
more frequently than they usually do, they are more likely to be socially disconnected than usual at a later time. In the re-
verse direction, earlier state social isolation did not predict future state depressive symptoms. Within-person deviation in 
prior expected depressive symptoms predicted deviation in expected loneliness 4 years later and vice versa. Moreover, the 
strength of the two cross-lagged effects did not differ.
Discussion:  Social  isolation  and  loneliness  are  linked  to  depressive  symptoms  differently. Though  depressive  symptoms 
might be a potential antecedent of social isolation, they might be both a potential antecedent and an outcome of loneliness.

Social relationships have been identified as a key predictor 
of human health (Berkman & Krishna, 2014; Holt-Lunstad 
et al., 2017). Research has consistently documented a posi-
tive effect of social relationships on a wide range of health 
outcomes  (Cacioppo  &  Cacioppo,  2014;  Holt-Lunstad, 
2018; Umberson & Karas Montez, 2010; Umberson et al., 
2010),  with  behavioral,  psychosocial,  and  physiological 
pathways  proposed  to  explain  the  observed  associations. 
The  relationship  between  social  relationships  and  mental 
health has also been assessed extensively, with many studies 

demonstrating  a  positive  association  (Courtin  &  Knapp, 
2017; Santini et al., 2015).

Social  isolation  and  loneliness  are  conceptualized  as 
two separate domains of social connections: the structural 
and  functional  aspects,  respectively  (National  Academies 
of Sciences Engineering & Medicine, 2020). Despite much 
discussion about social isolation and loneliness in the liter-
ature, there remains a lack of clarity around the definitions 
and  the  relationship  between  the  two  concepts  (Wigfield 
et  al.,  2022).  Nonetheless,  in  line  with  recent  systematic

reviews and meta-analyses (Courtin & Knapp, 2017; Holt-
Lunstad et al., 2015; Landeiro et al., 2017), this study used 
social isolation and loneliness to denote the objective and 
subjective aspects of the lack of social connections. While 
social isolation reflects the structural aspect of social con-
nections  and  is  characterized  by  a  low  quantity  of  social 
contact,  loneliness  reflects  the  functional  aspect  of  social 
connections and is determined by the quality of social re-
lationships.  The  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19) 
has  accelerated  the  significance  of  social  connections  due 
to  the “lockdown”  measures  imposed  by  the  government 
(van  Tilburg  et  al.,  2021).  Prepandemic  research  reveals 
that  more  than  one  third  of  adults  aged  45  and  older  in 
the  United  States  report  feeling  lonely  and  that  24%  of 
community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older are socially 
isolated (Anderson & Thayer, 2018; Cudjoe et al., 2020).

Social isolation and loneliness are closely related to de-
pressive symptoms. Substantial research has documented a 
cross-sectional relationship: social isolation and loneliness 
are more common in adults with depressive symptoms than 
in  their  peers  without  depressive  symptoms  (Evans  et  al., 
2019; Lim et al., 2016). Beyond the cross-sectional associ-
ation, longitudinal studies and meta-analyses further indi-
cate that social isolation and loneliness have a significant 
effect on depressive symptoms (e.g., Cacioppo et al., 2006; 
Erzen & Çikrikci, 2018; Huxhold et al., 2020; Lam et al., 
2020).  For  instance,  Segel-Karpas  et  al.  (2022)  analyzed 
data from three waves of the Health and Retirement Study 
(HRS) and found that loneliness at time 2 predicted depres-
sive symptoms at time 3.

In  line  with  the  view  of  the  convoy  model  that  social 
relations  have  important  health  consequences  (Antonucci 
et al., 2014), these studies assume that social isolation and 
loneliness lead to depressive symptoms and do not test for 
the reversed direction. However, it is possible that depres-
sive symptoms may cause people to withdraw from social 
interactions  or  impair  the  quality  of  these  social  inter-
actions,  thereby  elevating  people’s  feelings  of  loneliness. 
Indeed, cognitive discrepancy theory suggests that depres-
sive  symptoms  affect  cognitive  processes  and  influence 
people’s  judgments  about  the  adequacy  of  social  interac-
tion (Perlman & Peplau, 1981). People with severe depres-
sive  symptoms  are  likely  to  recall  negative  information 
and experience social interactions as less rewarding (Lewis 
et al., 2017). Empirically, a small number of studies have 
examined  the  reversed  effect  and  showed  that  depressive 
symptoms  increase  the  risk  of  developing  loneliness  and 
isolation in late adulthood (Finlay & Kobayashi, 2018).

Though  the  majority  of  prior  research  has  examined 
only one effect while overlooking the other effect, a handful 
of  studies  explicitly  address  the  question  of  the  temporal 
direction  of  the  relationship  between  social  isolation  and 
depressive  symptoms  and  between  loneliness  and  depres-
sive symptoms. Results from individual studies concerning 
the  direction  of  both  social  isolation  and  loneliness  and 
depressive symptoms are mixed, however. Cacioppo et al. 
(2010) used a 5-year study of a sample of 229 middle-aged 

and older adults and concluded that it is a loneliness that 
predicted depressive symptoms, rather than the other way 
around. Consistent with this unidirectional effect, a more 
recent study using a national sample also found that loneli-
ness predicted subsequent changes in depressive symptom-
atology, but not vice versa (Domènech-Abella et al., 2021). 
In contrast, Domènech-Abella et al. (2019) analyzed data 
from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing and showed 
a  bidirectional  relationship  between  loneliness  and  major 
depressive disorder.

The  temporal  direction  between  social  isolation  and 
depressive  symptoms  is  uncertain  as  well  (Berkman  et  al., 
2000). The  same  study  by  Domènech-Abella  et  al.  (2019) 
showed  that  the  association  between  objective  social  iso-
lation  and  major  depressive  disorder  was  unidirectional. 
Schwartz and Litwin (2019) used data from two waves of 
the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe and 
found a reciprocal relationship between social networks and 
mental health, such that baseline social connectedness led to 
mental health improvement and a better initial mental state 
led to richer social networks. Using 10-year follow-up data 
from  the  National  Social  Life,  Health,  and Aging  Project, 
Santini et al. (2020) also documented a reciprocal relation-
ship between social isolation and depressive symptoms.

To conclude, results from prior longitudinal research con-
cerning the directionality of the two aspects of social con-
nections and depressive symptoms are largely inconsistent. 
These  heterogeneities  can  be  attributable  to  differences  in 
statistical approaches, populations, and measures. The un-
derlying direction of the associations is thus still not well un-
derstood. Overall, prior research has assessed longitudinal 
associations of social connections and depressive symptoms 
but  was  limited  without  assessing  the  bidirectionality;  so-
cial connection has been considered as a risk factor rather 
than  a  consequence  of  depressive  symptoms. Additionally, 
the few studies considering the possibility of reciprocal ef-
fects have been limited by analyzing only one aspect of so-
cial connections; few studies have considered both aspects 
of social connections and loneliness jointly in one sample.

The Present Study

The aim of this study is to further untangle the temporal 
dynamics  underlying  the  relationship  between  social  con-
nections  and  depressive  symptoms.  It  distinguished  two 
aspects of social connections: social isolation and loneliness. 
Examining both social isolation and loneliness is important 
because, for some individuals, the perceived isolation can 
be unrelated to objective social relationships (Cornwell & 
Waite, 2009). Moreover, this study investigated social iso-
lation  and  loneliness  not  only  as  potential  antecedents  of 
depressive  symptoms  but  also  as  outcomes  of  depressive 
symptoms in middle and later life. To pursue this aim, this 
study used data from a nationally representative sample of 
American adults from the HRS that were followed up for 
a  maximum  of  12  years.  Informed  by  the  convoy  model 
of  social  relations  and  cognitive  discrepancy  theory,  this

study  hypothesized  that  the  relationship  between  social 
isolation and depressive symptoms would be bidirectional; 
that is, depressive symptoms and the two aspects of social 
connections  reciprocally  influence  each  other  over  time. 
Additionally,  it  examined  which  effect  was  larger  when  a 
reciprocal effect was observed. Understanding the roles of 
social  isolation  and  perceived  isolation  in  the  etiology  of 
depressive  symptoms  could  have  implications  for  public 
health interventions aimed at preventing mental disorders 
and social disconnectedness.

Method

Data

Data from the HRS were used to explore the longitudinal 
dynamics between social connections and depressive symp-
toms. The HRS is a biennial longitudinal study involving a 
nationally representative sample of individuals aged 51 and 
older in the United States. The initial biennial core HRS in-
terview was conducted in 1992. In 2006, in addition to the 
core interview, the HRS team initiated what is referred to as 
an Enhanced Face-to-Face (EFTF) Interview that included a 
set of social relationship measures to a random half sample. 
This random half sample was followed every 4 years. HRS 
waves 8 (2006), 10 (2010), 12 (2014), and 14 (2018) half-
samples  thus  comprised  the  longitudinal  sample  for  the 
present  study.  The  study  sample  was  restricted  to  those 
aged over 50 and had reported information on social con-
nections and depressive symptoms. As required by the an-
alytic  method  (Hamaker  et  al.,  2015),  participants  were 
further restricted to those who attended at least three times 
of the EFTF. The final sample consisted of 5,393 individ-
uals with a total of 18,777 observations.

Social Isolation

In line with recent research (Read et al., 2020), social iso-
lation  was  captured  by  five  binary  items:  whether  the  re-
spondent  (a)  lived  alone;  had  less  than  monthly  contact, 
including face-to-face, telephone, or written/e-mail contact 
with (b) child(ren), (c) other family members, or (d) friends, 
and (e) did not attend meetings of nonreligious organiza-
tions, such as political, community, or other interest groups 
in the past month. This index incorporates living arrange-
ments, social network size, contact frequency with network 
numbers, and levels of social engagement. Social isolation 
scores  ranged  from  0  to  5,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
higher isolation.

Loneliness

widely used and shown to be a valid assessment of loneli-
ness in the HRS sample (Hughes et al., 2004). Respondents 
were asked how much of the time they feel lack of compan-
ionship, left out, and isolated from others (1 = hardly ever 
or never, 2 = some of the time, and 3 = often). The three 
items  were  summed,  with  higher  scores  indicating  more 
loneliness. Cronbach’s alpha of the loneliness scale for each 
wave was above 0.80.

Depressive Symptoms

Depressive  symptoms  were  measured  by  the  eight-item 
CES-D scale (Radloff, 1977; Steffick, 2000). Respondents 
were asked to respond either “yes” or “no” to statements 
about their feelings in the week before the interview. The 
eight  questions  covered  depression,  anxiety,  sleep  distur-
bance, loneliness, and sadness. Given the study objectives, 
one  item  that  directly  measured  loneliness  was  excluded. 
The  “yes”  responses  to  the  remaining  seven  items  were 
summed.  Cronbach’s  alpha  ranged  from  0.76  to  0.78 
across waves.

Covariates

The  analyses  adjusted  for  a  set  of  potential  confounding 
variables,  including  respondents’  sociodemographic  char-
acteristics  and  health  status.  These  characteristics  were 
measured  at  baseline.  Sociodemographic  characteristics 
included age (range = 51–96, in years), gender (0 = male, 
1 = female), race (0 = non-Hispanic white, 1 = racial/ethnic 
minorities), education (0 = less than college, 1 = college and 
above),  and  employment  status  (0  =  not  employed/unem-
ployed/retired/disabled, 1 = full-time/part-time employed). 
Health  conditions  were  indicated  by  physical  disabilities, 
functional  limitations,  chronic  diseases,  and  self-rated 
health. Physical disabilities were assessed by five activities 
of daily living and five instrumental activities of daily living 
(Katz  et  al.,  1963;  Lawton  &  Brody,  1969).  Functional 
limitations  indicated  difficulties  in  mobility  and  were 
measured by a count of 12 tasks that respondents had dif-
ficulty performing (Nagi, 1976; Rosow & Breslau, 1966). 
Chronic diseases indicated individuals’ physiological health 
and were measured by a count of eight chronic conditions 
(e.g.,  stroke)  that  respondents  were  diagnosed  with.  Self-
rated  health  was  assessed  by  a  single  question  ranked  on 
a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = excellent to 5 = poor. In 
addition,  given  the  positive  relationship  between  the  two 
dimensions of social connections, baseline social isolation 
and loneliness were each controlled for when fitting models 
for loneliness and social isolation, respectively.

The  HRS  provides  researchers  with  a  three-item  and  an 
11-item measure of loneliness. Given that the 11-item lone-
liness  measure  is  available  only  after  wave  9  (2008),  the 
three-item  measure  that  is  available  consistently  begin-
ning in wave 8 was used. This three-item measure has been 

Analytic Approach

Before  examining  the  longitudinal  relationships  between 
social  connections  and  depressive  symptoms,  measure-
ment  invariance  tests  were  performed  to  ensure  that 

Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2023, Vol. 78, No. 2 

283

observed  indicators  were  measuring  the  same  constructs. 
This  was  done  with  a  set  of  four  increasingly  stringent 
tests  (Meredith,  1993):  configural  measurement  invari-
ance,  weak  measurement  invariance,  strong  measurement 
invariance,  and  strict  measurement  invariance. A  baseline 
model in which the number of factors and pattern of load-
ings were constrained to be identical across measurement 
occasions  (configural  invariance  model)  was  first  tested. 
This  model  was  compared  to  a  more  constrained  model 
of equal factor loadings (weak invariance model), followed 
by a model of equal observed variables intercepts (strong 
invariance model), and a model of equal unique variances 
(strict invariance model).

The  next  step  was  to  examine  the  temporal  dynamics 
between  social  connections  and  depressive  symptoms.  The 
typical  modeling  approach  is  the  cross-lagged  panel  model 
(CLPM) method. Most prior research on the temporal order 
of social connections and depressive symptoms also used this 
method (Cacioppo et al., 2010; Domènech-Abella et al., 2021). 
However, recent research suggests that this method might con-
flate within-person and between-person effects due to that it 
assumes no stable between-person differences in the variables 
of interest (Mund & Nestler, 2019). To address this limitation, 
the random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPM) 
method was proposed. The RI-CLPM decomposes observed 
variables into two parts: trait-like, time-constant, or between-
person  effect  and  state-like,  time-varying,  or  within-person 
effect  (Hamaker  et  al.,  2015).  By  including  a  random  inter-
cept in the model, the RI-CLPM controls for trait-like, time-
invariant  stability.  Controlling  for  trait-like  components  is 
important because these components do not change over time 
and do not easily fit into notions of causality.

Figure  1  shows  the  illustration  of  the  RI-CLPM  for 
the  estimation  of  the  longitudinal  relationship  between 
social connections and depressive symptoms. Two sets of 
models examining the temporal directions of social con-
nections and depressive symptoms were fitted. These were

done separately for the two dimensions of social connec-
tions. In the first set, a standard RI-CLPM was fitted. In 
the second set, another RI-CLPM constraining the grand 
means  of  social  connections  and  depressive  symptoms 
was fitted. Additionally, the CLPM was fitted to the data 
to  produce  results  that  could  be  compared  with  prior 
studies. The goodness of fit was evaluated based on chi-
square  (χ 2),  comparative  fit  index  (CFI),  Tucker–Lewis 
Index  (TLI),  the  root  mean  square  error  of  approxima-
tion  (RMSEA),  and  the  standardized  root  mean  square 
residual (SRMR). CFI and TLI values of 0.95 or higher, 
RMSEA  values  of  0.06  or  lower,  and  SRMR  values  of 
0.08 or lower are considered a relatively good model fit 
(Hu & Bentler, 1999).

Missing  data  might  bias  the  results.  Two  things  were 
done  to  reduce  the  potential  bias.  First,  the  nearest-
neighbor interpolation method was used to fill in missing 
data by using the within-person information across waves. 
Second,  full  information  maximum  likelihood  (FIML)  es-
timation  was  used  to  further  handle  the  incomplete  data. 
This  method  utilizes  all  the  information  of  the  observed 
data  and  maximizes  the  likelihood  of  the  model  given 
the  observed  data  and  thus  is  superior  to  traditional  ap-
proaches  (e.g.,  listwise  deletion)  in  handling  missing  data 
(Enders & Bandalos, 2001). Additionally, I compared the 
characteristics of the study sample and the excluded sample 
(Supplementary Table S2). The maximum likelihood (MLR) 
estimator with robust standard errors was used to take into 
account  any  nonnormality  in  the  sample.  In  addition,  all 
continuous covariates were grand-mean centered for mean-
ingful interpretation.

Results

Table 1 presents weighted descriptive statistics of covariates 
and  longitudinal  information  on  social  isolation,  loneli-
ness, and depressive symptoms. These descriptive statistics 
of  all  variables  were  weighted  by  cross-sectional  weights 
designed specifically for the sample to account for the sam-
pling structure and nonresponse.

Supplementary Table S3 compares the characteristics of 
the excluded and included samples. Compared to individ-
uals who were included in the present study, these excluded 
were  more  likely  to  be  older  (mean  =  66.43  vs.  63.99, 
t  =  19.94),  male  (percentages  =  0.45  vs.  0.41,  t  =  5.93), 
non-White  (percentages  =  0.38  vs.  0.24,  t  =  24.30),  with 
low  education  (percentages  =  0.56  vs.  0.50,  t  =  9.31), 
nonemployed (percentages = 0.68 vs. 0.62, t = 8.99), phys-
ically disabled (mean = 0.71 vs. 0.28, t = 27.81), function-
ally  limited  (mean  =  3.12  vs.  2.46,  t  =  19.30),  and  have 
more  diagnosed  chronic  diseases  (mean  =  2.08  vs.  1.67, 
t = 23.39) and poor self-rated health (mean = 3.03 vs. 2.59, 
t  =  32.64).  Moreover,  they  also  reported  higher  levels  of 
social isolation (mean = 2.22 vs. 2.01, t = 12.56), loneliness 
(mean = 4.59 vs. 4.34, t = 11.49), and depressive symptoms 
(mean = 1.49 vs. 1.10, t = 17.68).

Table  2  shows  the  MLR-estimated  means  and  correl-
ations  among  the  two  forms  of  social  connections  and 
depressive  symptoms.  Over  the  12-year  follow-up,  mid-
dle-aged  and  older  adults  became  more  socially  discon-
nected;  the  social  isolation  score  increased  from  1.72  to 
2.33,  a  35%  jump.  However,  they  did  not  become  lone-
lier  or  more  depressed  over  time;  the  temporal  trends  of 
loneliness  and  depressive  symptoms  remained  relatively 
stable. Table  2  also  displays  the  correlations  between  the 
key  study  variables  within  each  wave  and  across  waves. 
Social  isolation  and  depressive  symptoms  were  correl-
ated  cross-sectionally  (rs  =  0.17–0.20)  and  longitudinally 
(rs = 0.13–0.19). This is even more true for the interplay be-
tween loneliness and depressive symptoms: cross-sectional 
relationship ranged from 0.36 to 0.41, and the longitudinal 
relationship ranged from 0.29 to 0.33.

The first step is to test for the measurement invariance. 
Supplementary Table  S1  reports  the  results. The  strict  in-
variance model showed an adequate model fit with a CFI 
of 0.94 and a TLI of 0.93 for social isolation and a CFI of 
0.99 and a TLI of 0.99 for loneliness, suggesting that the 
strict invariance models adequately captured the observed 
data. Thus,  social  isolation  and  loneliness  were  not  inter-
preted differently over time.

Testing the Temporal Dynamics Between Social 
Connections and Depressive Symptoms

The  next  step  is  to  examine  the  temporal  order  of  so-
cial  connections  and  depressive  symptoms.  Table  3  re-
ports  model  fit  indices.  The  model  fit  of  RI-CLPM  for

Notes: Social connections (SC) were captured by two forms: social isolation (SI) and loneliness (LN). Models controlled for age, gender, race, education, employ-
ment status, physical disabilities, functional limitations, chronic diseases, functional limitations, self-rated health, and baseline social connections. SE = standard 
error; DS = depressive symptoms; RI-CLPM = random intercept cross-lagged panel models.

symptoms  was  acceptable,  with  Akaike  information  cri-
terion  (AIC)  =  118,236,  Bayesian  information  criterion 
(BIC)  =  118,572,  CFI  =  0.98, TLI  =  0.96,  SRMR  =  0.02, 
RMSEA = 0.03, χ 2 (73) = 419, p < .001 (M1a). The model fit 
of the RI-CLPM that constrains the grand means over time 
was  not  satisfactory  (M1b).  Additionally,  the  chi-square 
difference  test  with  Satorra–Bentler  correction  that  takes 
the maximum likelihood estimation into account (Satorra 
&  Bentler,  2010)  showed  that  the  model  fit  of  M1a  was 
better  than  that  of  M1b  (∆χ 2  =  893,  p  <  .001).  Likewise, 
model  comparison  tests  showed  that  the  RI-CLPM  for 
the interplay between loneliness and depressive symptoms 

without  constraining  grand  means  fitted  the  data  better 
(∆χ 2 = 21, p < .001). Therefore, later analyses were based 
on M1a and M2a.

Table  4  shows  the  estimates  of  the  RI-CLPMs  for  the 
interplay  between  social  isolation  and  depressive  symp-
toms. Autoregressive and cross-lagged parameters obtained 
from  the  RI-CLPM  reflect  pure  within-person  estimates. 
Summarizing  the  within-person  autoregressive  effects,

toms) was above his or her average level of social isolation 
(depressive  symptoms)  at  a  specific  time  point,  he  or  she 
was expected to score above his or her usual level of social

isolation (depressive symptoms) 4 years later. Summarizing 
the  within-person  cross-lagged  effects,  the  positive  cross-
lagged path from depressive symptoms to social isolation 
suggested  that  a  score  above  the  person-specific  mean  in 
depressive symptoms at a given point in time was associ-
ated with an isolation score above the person-specific mean 
in social isolation at a later point in time, net of previous 
deviations from the person-specific mean in isolation. The 
path from social isolation to depressive symptoms was not 
significant (β = 0.001, p = .97).

For  the  longitudinal  relationship  between  loneliness 
and  depressive  symptoms,  the  autoregressive  pathways 
were also significant for state loneliness (β s = 0.17–0.19, 
p < .001), suggesting that state-like aspects of loneliness 
at an earlier time predicted loneliness years later. In ad-
dition,  earlier  state  depressive  symptoms  predicted  fu-
ture state loneliness (β s = 0.06, p < .001). The path from 
loneliness  to  depressive  symptoms  was  likewise  positive 
(β s = 0.04, p = .03). Given the reciprocal relationship be-
tween loneliness and depressive symptoms, the next step 
is to determine which of the two cross-lagged effects was 
larger. The Wald  test  of  parameter  constraints  indicated 
that ∆χ 2 = 0.51, df = 108, p = .48. Thus, the cross-lagged 
effect of loneliness on depressive symptoms did not differ 
significantly  from  the  effect  of  depressive  symptoms  on 
loneliness.

In addition, there were within-time correlations: within-
person increases in social isolation above his or her mean 
level were accompanied by his or her increases in depressive 
symptoms compared to his or her average (β s = 0.03–0.06). 
So  was  the  relationship  between  loneliness  and  depres-
sive  symptoms  (β s  =  0.15–0.22).  The  random  intercepts 
of  social  isolation  and  depressive  symptoms  that  indicate 
trait-like, stable between-person differences were also posi-
tively related, suggesting that those who were more socially 
disconnected  than  others  were  also  more  depressed  than 
others (β = 0.08, p = .02). Similarly, the random intercept 
of loneliness was closely linked to that of depressive symp-
toms,  such  that  those  who  perceived  more  isolation  than 
other individuals reported higher CES-D scores than others 
(β = 0.51, p < .001).

Given that prior research on the directionality between 
social connections and depressive symptoms has used the 
CLPM method, to compare with prior research, the CLPM 
was fitted to the data. Fit indices of the CLPMs were sat-
isfactory.  For  instance,  indices  for  the  interplay  between 
social isolation and depressive symptoms were acceptable 
(M1a),  with AIC  =  118,950,  BIC  =  119,267,  CFI  =  0.93, 
TLI = 0.90, SRMR = 0.03, RMSEA = 0.05, χ 2 (76) = 1,077, 
and p < .001. However, compared to the fit of RI-CLPM, 
it had higher values of AIC, BIC, SRMR, and RMSEA and 
lower  CFI  and  TLI  values.  The  chi-square  difference  test 
with  Satorra–Bentler  correction  also  suggested  that  the 
RI-CLPM  provided  a  better  representation  of  the  data 
than  the  CLPM  (∆χ 2  =  658,  p  <  .001).  Likewise,  the  fit 
of  RI-CLPM  for  the  relationship  between  loneliness  and 

depressive  symptoms  was  also  better  than  that  of  the 
CLPM (∆χ 2 = 514, p < .001).

Supplementary Table S3 reports standardized estimates 
for  both  autoregressive  and  cross-lagged  effects  obtained 
from the CLPMs. In terms of the relationship between social 
isolation and depressive symptoms, both the autoregressive 
paths amounted to 0.16 for depressive symptoms and for 
social isolation, indicating that the rank-order (i.e., the sta-
bility of between-person differences) of the two were sim-
ilar.  The  cross-lagged  path  from  depressive  symptoms  to 
social  isolation  reached  statistical  significance,  suggesting 
that  prior  CES-D  scores  were  associated  with  subsequent 
social  isolation.  The  cross-lagged  path  from  social  isola-
tion  to  depressive  symptoms  did  not  reach  statistical  sig-
nificance (p = .27). The within-time correlations indicated a 
codevelopment of social isolation and depressive symptoms 
over time such that more increases in isolation were associ-
ated with more increases in depressive symptoms. In terms 
of the relationship between loneliness and depressive symp-
toms, depressive symptoms and loneliness reciprocally in-
fluenced  each  other  over  time  (Supplementary  Table  S3). 
Thus,  the  results  replicated  findings  reported  in  the  main 
text  of  a  unidirectional  effect  of  depressive  symptoms  on 
social  isolation  and  a  bidirectional  relationship  between 
loneliness and depressive symptoms, although the estimates 
derived from CLPMs were much larger than those derived 
from  the  RI-CLPM,  which  was  expected  given  the  con-
flation  of  between-person  differences  and  within-person 
effect.

Discussion

Whether social isolation and loneliness predict depressive 
symptoms,  or  depressive  symptoms  increase  feelings  of 
loneliness and social isolation, or both, has not been fully 
established.  This  study  provides  further  evidence  on  the 
temporal dynamics between social connections and depres-
sive symptoms. Specifically, this study used data from na-
tionally representative middle-aged and older adults in the 
United States to examine whether a person’s deviation from 
their  average  level  of  social  connections  predicted  future 
deviation from their average level of depressive symptoms, 
and  vice  versa.  Results  showed  that,  at  the  within-person 
level, there was a unidirectional relationship between social 
isolation  and  depressive  symptoms  and  a  reciprocal  rela-
tionship between loneliness and depressive symptoms such 
that higher levels of depressive symptoms at an earlier time 
predicted higher levels of loneliness at a later time and vice 
versa.  Moreover,  the  strength  of  the  two  effects  was  not 
dissimilar.

First, this study did not reveal a reciprocal relationship 
between  social  isolation  and  depressive  symptoms  but  a 
unidirectional relationship. On the one hand, earlier state 
social isolation did not predict future state depressive symp-
toms.  In  other  words,  smaller  social  networks  or  poorer 
social  integration  might  not  affect  later  state  depressive

symptoms. Socioemotional selectivity theory provides some 
insights  into  understanding  this  relationship.  This  theory 
posits that individuals are selective in terms of whom they 
choose  to  keep  in  their  network,  particularly  in  old  age, 
when social networks begin to serve the function of emo-
tion  regulation  (Carstensen,  1995).  Thus,  as  individuals 
grow older, they tend to intensify close relationships and let 
go of less close relationships. Empirical research lends sup-
port to this idea. For instance, one study found that older 
Chinese  adults  who  live  alone  are  more  likely  to  be  in-
volved in social activities, even though they are more likely 
to feel lonely (Gu et al., 2019).

On  the  other  hand,  earlier  state  depressive  symptoms 
predicted future social isolation. When adults experience so-
cial isolation more frequently than they usually do, they are 
also more likely to report higher CES-D scores than usual 
at a later time. The finding of depressive symptoms as a pre-
dictor but not an outcome of changes in social isolation is in 
contrast with several prior studies (e.g., Domènech-Abella 
et al., 2019, 2021; Huxhold et al., 2020). This is because 
most  prior  studies  tend  to  assume  an  a  priori  path  from 
social isolation to depressive symptoms rather than the op-
posite direction (e.g., Chang et al., 2016; Lam et al., 2020). 
However,  this  finding  is  in  line  with  qualitative  research. 
One recent study using a convergent mixed-methods design 
reveals that poor mental health often results in social isola-
tion; people use solitude as a coping mechanism to manage 
their mental health (Finlay & Kobayashi, 2018).

Second, this study revealed a bidirectional relationship 
between loneliness and depressive symptoms. Earlier state 
depressive  symptoms  predicted  future  state  loneliness;  at 
the same time, earlier state loneliness predicted future state 
depressive  symptoms.  In  terms  of  the  former  association, 
the aforementioned cognitive discrepancy theory offers one 
explanation  for  the  loneliness–depressive  symptoms  link. 
Cognitive discrepancy theory suggests that perceived isola-
tion is unpleasant and distressing, resulting from a discrep-
ancy  between  one’s  desired  and  achieved  levels  of  social 
relations (Perlman & Peplau, 1981). Depressive symptoms 
affect  this  discrepancy  process:  people  with  depressive 
symptoms  are  more  likely  to  recall  less  positive  informa-
tion and appraise their social interactions more negatively 
(Burholt & Scharf, 2014). In terms of the cross-lagged ef-
fect  of  loneliness  on  depressive  symptoms,  Hawkley  and 
Cacioppo (2010) employed the loneliness regulatory loop 
to  explain  the  health  consequences  of  loneliness:  loneli-
ness is accompanied by impairments in attention, behavior, 
cognition, and affect, which can have health consequence 
through  their  impact  on  genetic,  neural,  and  hormonal 
mechanisms.

Moreover, the strength of the cross-lagged effect of de-
pressive symptoms on loneliness was not significantly dif-
ferent from that of the cross-lagged effect of loneliness on 
depressive symptoms. Indeed, loneliness is strongly linked 
to  depressive  symptoms  to  the  extent  that  prior  research 
claims that loneliness might be an associated symptom of 

depression  (Radloff,  1977).  Of  note,  the  equal  strength 
of  the  two  cross-lagged  effects  does  not  necessarily  mean 
that loneliness and depressive symptoms are identical. The 
two  constructs  are  empirically  and  theoretically  distinct 
(Hawkley  et  al.,  2008).  Loneliness  is  about  how  people 
feel about their social connections in particular and depres-
sive symptoms are about how people feel generally (Weiss, 
1973). Nonetheless, the reciprocal association between the 
two constructs suggests that middle-aged and older persons 
may face a “vicious cycle”: people with high perceived iso-
lation  will  experience  poor  mental  health,  and  such  poor 
mental health outcomes will further cause more feelings of 
loneliness by reducing their ability to maintain their usual 
social  interactions.  However,  on  a  positive  note,  reducing 
one symptom may mean alleviation of another symptom.

Several other findings are worth noting. Controlling for 
trait-like tendencies, earlier state depressive symptoms pre-
dicted  future  state  depressive  symptoms.  Likewise,  earlier 
state  isolation  and  loneliness  predicted  future  state  iso-
lation  and  loneliness,  respectively.  In  other  words,  when 
adults report more social isolation, loneliness, and depres-
sive symptoms than they usually do at a specific time point, 
4 years later, they will also experience more isolation, lone-
liness,  and  depressive  symptoms  than  usual,  respectively. 
Such results are consistent across the three 4-year intervals. 
Additionally,  positive  within-time  correlations  existed: 
within-person  increases  in  social  isolation  or  loneliness 
above  person-specific  mean  level  were  accompanied  by 
person-specific increases in depressive symptoms compared 
to his or her average. Beyond these within-person level as-
sociations, significant between-person level associations ex-
isted  as  well. The  two  aspects  of  social  connections  were 
positively associated with depressive symptoms, indicating 
that  individuals  with  higher  social  isolation  or  loneliness 
than  other  individuals  tended  to  report  higher  depressive 
symptoms  than  other  individuals. Thus,  the  temporal  dy-
namics among the trait- and state-like components of social 
isolation, loneliness, and depressive symptoms are nuanced 
and must be carefully disentangled to shed light on the un-
derlying processes.

The findings of this research have theoretical and prac-
tical implications. First, this study further suggests the ne-
cessity  of  disentangling  the  roles  of  social  isolation  from 
loneliness. The two are different aspects of social connec-
tions  and  are  linked  to  depressive  symptoms  differently. 
With  or  without  controlling  for  trait-like  aspects,  social 
isolation  was  predicted  by  depressive  symptoms  and  not 
the  other  way  around;  loneliness  both  predicted  and  was 
predicted by depressive symptoms. Second, that prior state 
social  isolation  did  not  lead  to  future  depressive  symp-
toms  suggests  that  public  health  interventions  aimed  at 
preventing or alleviating mental disorders shall not target 
promoting  social  connections  first.  However,  state  loneli-
ness led to future depressive symptoms such that individ-
uals who felt lonelier than they usually do were also more 
likely  to  display  higher  depressive  symptoms  than  usual 

288

years later. Thus, efforts to address loneliness could aid in 
the prevention of mental disorders. Meanwhile, clinicians, 
care providers, or social workers should also be aware that 
mid-  and  later-life  depressive  symptoms  can  precipitate 
loneliness; adults with depressive symptoms might need in-
tervention to combat loneliness. In short, it is essential to 
address both the structural and functional aspects of social 
connections in a complementary way to promote the psy-
chological health of the middle-aged and older population.
This study has several strengths. It contributes to the field 
by  examining  the  associations  of  both  social  isolation  and 
loneliness with depressive symptoms in the same sample. Prior 
studies have focused on only one aspect of social connections 
and  rarely  have  considered  the  three  constructs  together. 
Additionally, this study uses four measurement occasions that 
span 12 years from a large, nationally representative prospec-
tive study to investigate the temporal dynamics underlying the 
association between social isolation, loneliness, and depressive 
symptoms. Prior research on the direction of social connec-
tions and depressive symptoms only collected data for a short 
time period or used a small sample. Moreover, this study uses 
the RI-CLPM method to distinguish the trait- and state-like 
components of social connections and depressive symptoms, 
which can better assess the temporal precedence and causality.
This  study  entails  several  limitations.  First,  the  scales 
for depressive symptoms were based on the self-report of 
symptoms. The results might differ if depressive symptoms 
have  been  assessed  by  clinical  evaluation  and  diagnosis. 
Second, the excluded sample was older, more likely to be 
men, non-White, poorly educated, nonemployed, and had 
worse physical and mental health as well as more social 
disconnectedness.  Thus,  even  though  the  FIML  method 
was used to reduce selective attrition bias, attrition might 
still  affect  the  results.  Additionally,  social  isolation  and 
loneliness were only two aspects of social connections and 
might be insufficient to provide a full understanding of so-
cial relationships and their well-being consequences.

To conclude, within-person autoregressive effects reveal 
that state social isolation, loneliness, and depressive symp-
toms predict themselves over a 12-year observation period. 
Within-person  cross-lagged  effects  reveal  a  unidirectional 
effect  between  social  isolation  and  depressive  symptoms 
and a bidirectional effect between loneliness and depressive 
symptoms. Earlier state depressive symptoms predict future 
state  social  isolation  and  not  vice  versa;  thus,  when  mid-
dle-aged  and  older  adults  feel  depressed  more  frequently 
than  they  usually  do,  they  become  more  socially  isolated 
than  usual  at  a  later  time.  Earlier  state  depressive  symp-
toms predict future state loneliness and earlier state lone-
liness predicts future state depressive symptoms; moreover, 
the strength of the two bidirectional associations is not dif-
ferent.  In  addition  to  within-person  level  cross-lagged  ef-
fects, there are consistent between-person level cross-lagged 
effects  such  that  individuals  with  higher  levels  of  social 
isolation or loneliness than other individuals tend to have 
more depressive symptoms than other individuals.
