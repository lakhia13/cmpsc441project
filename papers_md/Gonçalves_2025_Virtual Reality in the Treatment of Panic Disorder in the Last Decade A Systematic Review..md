Abstract:

Introduction:  Virtual  Reality  (VR)  is  an  interactive,  three-dimensional  computing  environment  that  enables
individuals to experience a sense of presence as if they are immersed in a real-world setting. VR is currently being
implemented in therapeutic interventions for individuals with certain mental disorders.

Objective: To illustrate the implementation and evolution of VR in the treatment of panic disorder, agoraphobia, and
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia over the past decade.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted based on articles retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, and Web
of Science, covering the period from 2013 to 2023. A total of 21 studies were selected after analyzing the titles,
abstracts, and content in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines.

Results:  A  total  of  153  articles  were  initially  selected  and  included  in  the  study.  The  results  demonstrated  the
evolution and increasing use of VR-based technologies for the treatment of mental disorders, including panic disorder
and PDA.

Discussion: The utilization of VR exposure therapy (VRET) for patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, or PDA
yielded measurable outcomes, including the evolution of VRET applications, an increase in the number of scientific
articles and patients in recent years, as well as advancements in hardware devices, software, and other application
methods, such as self-guided applications.

Conclusions:  The  implementation  of  VRET  is  increasing  in  several  regions  worldwide,  and  its  evolution  is
indisputable for the treatment of panic disorder, agarophobia, and PDA. Comparisons with traditional in vivo methods
revealed that VRET yields satisfactory and promising outcomes. The continued evolution of VR technology is expected
to expand its potential application in patients with these disorders.

1. INTRODUCTION

Virtual Reality (VR) is emerging as a revolutionary tool
in  mental  health,
 offering  novel  strategies  for  the
treatment of psychiatric disorders [1]. VR is a computer-
generated,  three-dimensional  environment  that  enables
users  to  immerse  in  a  virtual  world,  where  they  can
interact  with  the  environment  as  though  they  were
physically  present  in  it  [2,  3].This  graphical  imple-
mentation ensures that the virtual world incorporates real-
world  aspects  (virtual  realism),  and  authentic  sound
(auditory realism), and enables the user to feel as though
they  are  part  of  the  environment  (haptic  realism)  [4].
Head-mounted displays (HMDs) represent the majority of
VR  tools  in  current  use,  which  facilitate  what  theorists
define as direct, immediate action [2].

VR  emerged  as  an  exposure  tool  over  20  years  ago,
providing  patients  and  therapists  with  more  appealing
strategies that, despite being undoubtedly effective, have
been rejected and consequently underused [5].

VR  makes  it  possible  to  replicate  environments  that
serve as triggers for individual manifestations, depending
on  the  specific  disorder.  It,  therefore,  enables  the
recreation  of  particular  environments  for  individual
disorders, enhances the replication of socio-psychological
experiments,  facilitates  a  shift  in  the  thinking  patterns
regarding social interactions, allows for the examination of
reciprocal
 and  enhances  the
potential  for  ecological  validity  and  controlled  real-life
situations  [6,  7].

 valid  scenarios,

VR  is  used  as  a  “simulative  tool”  for  recreating
logically
 enabling  the
reproduction  of  alarming  or  critical  situations,  such  as
public speaking, with precise control over the delivery of
stimuli tailored to the specific therapeutic requirement for
each  patient.  Patients  can,  therefore,  participate  in
simulated  situations  that  would  otherwise  be  extremely
dangerous  to  experience  in  real  life,  thereby  providing
insights into the limitations of existing treatments [8].

Immersive  VR  enables  the  creation  of  interactive
computer-generated  environments  that  can  replace  real-
world sensory perceptions with digitally generated stimuli,
thereby  producing  the  sensation  of  being  physically
present  in  novel,  life-sized  settings.  VR  has  several
benefits  in  mental  health,  including  the  generation  of

attractive,
 there  is  a  scarcity  of  research  on  the
therapeutic  efficacy  of  VRET  in  panic  disorder  and
agoraphobia,  which  limits  its  incorporation  into  clinical
practice [12].

VR  technologies  are  being  increasingly  implemented
as a critical tool for the diagnosis and treatment of various
mental  disorders.  They  are  regarded  as  a  potentially
revolutionary resource for psychological interventions and
may be gradually integrated into regular clinical practice
in the coming years [13].

 is
characterized  by  a  fear  of  experiencing  panic  attacks  or
panic-related  symptoms  in  situations  where  escape  is
perceived  as  difficult  and  is  characterized  by  a  sudden
rush of anxiety that manifests as physiologic and cognitive
symptoms, leading to a fear of specific situations [14, 15].

 (PDA)

In  vivo  exposure  therapy  (iVET)  is  the  most  common
therapeutic  strategy  for  PDA,  in  which  patients  are
exposed to stimuli in a gradual and controlled manner to
shift their responses to the object or situation causing the
fear. In vivo, therapies are associated with high costs and

 VRET  can,
therefore, provide a potential solution for addressing these
limitations associated with iVET [16].

The present research primarily aimed to examine the
applications of VR in the treatment of panic disorder over
the  last  decade.  To  achieve  this  general  objective,  the
specific  objectives  of  the  study  were  as  follows:  (a)  to
evaluate  the  evolution  of  VR  applications  in  the  last
decade;  (b)  to  assess  the  application  of  VR  in  the
treatment  of  panic  disorder  and  agoraphobia;  and  (c)  to
determine the therapeutic validity of VR in patients with
PDA or those with panic disorder without agoraphobia.

2. METHODS

2.1. Study Design and Registration

This systematic review has been registered in the OSF
Register  under  registration  number  OSF  2023-01-08  -
04:53  PM,  and  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and
Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  guidelines.  The  meta-analysis
was  conducted  using  a  keyword-based  search  strategy
against  the  Medical  Subject  Headings  (MeSH)  database,
using MeSH-indexed keywords. The adequacy of the study
structure  was  further  evaluated  using  the  PRISMA
checklist  that  served  as  a  guide.

2.2. Research Strategy

We  searched  the  PubMed,  Cochrane,  and  Web  of
Science  databases  for  articles  in  English  published
between  2013  and  2023,  using  individual  keywords  or
keyword  combinations  with  the  Boolean  connectives
“AND”  and  “OR”.  The  included  articles  are  provided  in
Fig. (1).

A  total  of  153  articles  were  initially  selected  by
database search, after which the titles were examined, and
70 articles were removed. The abstracts of the remaining

83 articles were reviewed, which led to the removal of 54
studies.  The  remaining  29  articles  were  considered
eligible  for  reading,  and  a  total  of  8  studies  were
subsequently  eliminated  after  reviewing  the  contents,
which  left  21  articles  for  inclusion  (Tables  1a–b  and  2).
The  study  was  conducted  at  the  RVSM  Lab  (Laboratório
Realidade  Virtual  na  Saúde  Mental),  affiliated  with
IPUB/UFRJ.

2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The articles selected herein were published in English
between 2013 and 2023 and were obtained from the three
aforementioned databases in accordance with the PRISMA
guidelines, using the 5 keywords from this article. These
articles  addressed  panic  disorder  and  agoraphobia,
specifically  in  relation  to  the  use  of  VR  technology.  The
excluded  studies  on  VR  applied  exclusively  to  other
disorders.

 the  quantitative
findings  leading  to  the  final  selection  of  articles  for
qualitative synthesis are presented in accordance with the
PRISMA diagram (Fig. 1). The quantitative data extracted
from  the  selected  articles  are  additionally  provided  in
Tables 1 and 2. A total of 14 (65%), 5 (25%), and 2 (10%)
articles were finally selected from the PubMed, Cochrane,
and Web of Science repositories, respectively.

3.2. Quantitative Data

The  enhanced  implementation  of  VR  techniques  for
mental  disorders  reflects  the  quantitative  results,  which
are  increasingly  accepted  by  therapists  and  patients,
which confirms the growing confidence in the application
of VR-based technologies.

VR-cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT) with a 360-
degree  video  is  a  feasible,  acceptable,  and  potentially
effective  treatment  option  for  PDA,  which  is  suitable  in

It  is  considered  that  the  implementation  of  VRET  in
patients with agoraphobia can significantly improve well-
established psychological and psychiatric treatments [17].

more  acceptable  than  traditional  approaches.  Patients
with PDA find VR to be an effective strategy for treating
the  symptoms  of  this  condition.  Studies  on  VR-based
exposure  therapy  for  PDA,  employing  rigorous  study
designs  and  methodologies,  support  the  efficacy  of  VR-
based tools for the treatment of PDA [15].

The growing number of studies using VRET reinforces
the quantitative results, driven by the improvement in the
quality of computational resources, particularly in terms of
the accuracy of images, among other factors.

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  VRET  is  an  effective
therapeutic  strategy  for  agoraphobia  when  implemented

 Numerous  studies  on  the
implementation of VRET for phobias collectively facilitate
the  development  of  specific  recommendations  for  the
optimal  implementation  of  VRET,  thereby  promoting
therapeutic  efficacy  [18].

The computer systems used for the implementation of
 hyper-
VRET  can  effectively  induce  panic,
ventilation, and electrodermal responses in patients with
PDA  but  do  not  produce  these  effects  in  healthy  control
subjects [19].

 anxiety,

It has been demonstrated that VR-based experiments
can  effectively  replicate  realistic  spatial  and  social
behaviors. VR additionally allows for experimental control
and  systematic  variations  that  would  be  difficult  in  real-
world  scenarios  [20].  Studies  have  additionally  revealed
that  VRET  yields  positive  outcomes  in  the  treatment  of
most phobias; however, the results may vary depending on
the specific disorder and resources employed [21].

Results demonstrated that VRET
has positive outcomes in the
treatment of PDA, but further
research with larger sample sizes
is necessary

VR experiments allow for a more
precise measurement of behavioral
and psychological data. VR allows
experimental control and
systematic variations that would
be difficult in real-life situations

Patients with PDA report
satisfaction with VR-based therapy
and may find it more acceptable
than traditional approaches

The implementation of VRET for
the treatment of patients with
agoraphobia can enhance
psychological and psychiatric
interventions

VRET is effective for the treatment
of agoraphobia when implemented
for 8–12 sessions. A large number
of studies on VRET allows for the
formulation of recommendations
on its implementation for
enhancing therapeutic efficacy

VR-CBT appears to be a feasible,
acceptable, and potentially
effective therapeutic strategy for
PDA. The patients reported high
satisfaction with the procedure
and a low rate of dropout

Exposure to the CS produced
effects similar to in vivo exposure,
including respiratory and caffeine
challenges. Further studies are
necessary for comparing the
various forms of PDA treatment

The increasing implementation of
VR technologies is both real and
significant and exhibits immense
potential for the diagnosis and
treatment of mental disorders

VRET is a potentially effective
approach for exposure therapy,
particularly in adolescents, due to
its low barriers and the
incorporation of engaging
elements. Given their connection
with a technology-driven
environment, the application of
VRET in adolescents is assumed to
potentially enhance treatment,
early intervention, and disease
prevention

that used HMD and customized VR
technologies showed superior
outcomes compared to the group
that did not use these resources

The application of VRET in anxiety
disorders demonstrated that VR
can effectively replicate exposure
scenarios simulating real-world
situations, leading to a reduction
in anxiety symptoms

VR can offer a promising strategy
for addressing body image
distortion and dysfunctional eating
disorders

Presence consists of two
orthogonal illusions referred to as
place illusion (PI, which represents
the illusion of being in the place
and is depicted by the VR) and
plausibility (Psi, which denotes the
illusion that the virtual situations
and events are actually occurring)

3.5. Demographic Analysis

Only  3  countries  were  represented  by  the  selected
articles  published  between  2013  and  2017,  while  12
countries  were  represented  between  2018  and  2023,  of
which 11 did not appear in the studies published between
2013 and 2017.

The  number  of  articles  on  the  application  of  VR  in
mental  health  was  analyzed  by  dividing  the  decade  into
two  halves  (2013–2017  and  2018–2023),  which  revealed
an exponential growth in the number of articles published
over the ten years studied herein. It was observed that of
the 21 articles selected in this study (including 14, 5, and
2  articles  from  PubMed,  Cochrane,  and  Web  of  Science,
respectively), the number of articles on the use of VR in
mental health therapy increased by more than 500%, from
3  to  18  articles,  from  the  first  half  of  the  decade  to  the
second  half,  reflecting  a  growing  interest  in  this  field
within  the  scientific  community.

The  literature  review  by  Yeung  (2021),  covering  28
years  from  1992  to  2019,  mapped  the  number  of  annual
publications on VR in the field of medicine, which revealed
a substantial increase in the number of published articles
on VR as well as the number of citations. Analysis of the
number  of  publications  from  2013  to  2019,  which  falls
within our temporal range of 2013–2023, revealed a four-
fold  increase  from  300  to  1250  publications  per  year,
while the number of annual citations on VR increased from
450 to 2000 citations per year [2].

3.6. Therapeutic Efficacy

 VR  offers  several

The  application  of

 therapeutic
advantages for patients with mental disorders, especially in
terms  of  outcomes,  compared  to  in  vivo  therapies.  Despite
the  absence  of  consistent  confirmation,  the  outcomes
described  in  the  selected  articles  on  the  use  of  VR  with
computers,  3D  glasses  with  supervision,  and  self-guided
methods  are  generally  positive.

The efficacy of CBT in the absence of a virtual therapist
remains  to  be  investigated;  however,  a  virtual  therapist

appears to be an essential component of fully self-guided VR
therapy  [22].  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  VRET  in  CBT-
based  psychological  therapies  for  panic  disorder  is  less
efficacious  in  certain  cases,  which  is  possibly  attributed  to
the technological resources employed [23].

4. DISCUSSION

VR  is  emerging  as  a  revolutionary  tool  in  mental
health,  providing  a  novel  strategy  for  the  treatment  of
psychiatric disorders [1].

There  is  substantial

 consensus  regarding  the
advantages  of  applying  VR  in  mental  health  disorders,
particularly  for  the  treatment  of  individuals  with  panic
disorder  and  agoraphobia.  These  advantages  include
enhanced therapeutic control compared to in vivo or self-
guided processes, as well as lower treatment costs. It has
been  additionally  reported  that  VRET  yields  positive
therapeutic outcomes in patients with agoraphobia [24].

However,  a  significant  number  of  patients  remain
untreated due to limited therapeutic resources, and digital
self-guided  short-term  treatment  applications  may  help
address this issue; however, there is a scarcity of data on
their efficacy [22, 25]. It is, therefore, necessary to further
evaluate  self-guided  treatment  strategies.  The  findings
suggest  that  VRET  does  not  achieve  the  same  level  of
immersion and presence as iVET for certain phobias [21].

VR  provides  a  dynamic,  engaging,  and  interactive
environment for patients suffering from certain disorders,
and its benefits in mental health include the enhancement
of treatment efficacy [10].

4.1. Geographic Expansion

The development of VR applications for the treatment
of  panic  disorder  and  agoraphobia  evolved  from  2013  to
2022.  This  duration  was  divided  into  two  periods  in  this
study,  namely,  2013–2017  and  2018–2023,  and  the
findings  revealed  significant  growth  in  the  field  across
multiple countries. The articles selected from the first half
of  the  last  decade  (2013–2017)  represented  3  countries,
while those selected from the second half represented 12

8   Clinical Practice & Epidemiology in Mental Health, 2025, Vol. 21

Gonçalves et al.

countries,  of  which  11  were  new  countries,  indicating
significant  geographic  expansion.

4.2. Analysis of the Number of Articles

A  total  of  3  and  14  articles  were  finally  selected
according  to  the  PRISMA  guidelines  for  the  periods
2013–2017  and  2018–2023,  respectively,  which  consti-
tuted 18% and 82%, respectively, indicating a substantial
growth in the number of publications.

Of the 17 studies selected herein, approximately 70%
employed or analyzed studies that implemented HMDs or
more accurate devices, while 30% utilized computers and
represented older articles. This highlights the evolution of
VR  technology  and  demonstrates  the  enhancement  of
accuracy  and  presence  in  more  recent  years.

4.3. Participant Profiles/Target Demographics

Despite the growth in the number of articles and authors
from countries that have started publishing studies on VRET,
several  of  these  articles  feature  small  sample  sizes,  which
reduces  the  ability  to  draw  generalized  conclusions
regarding  the  outcomes  of  implementing  VR-based  thera-
peutics.

Further studies with larger sample sizes are therefore
necessary,  as  several  studies  have  employed  smaller
sample sizes, which likely contributes to the inconclusive
results observed in several studies [21].

4.4. Hardware Devices and Software

The  development  of  software  and  the  selection  of
appropriate  hardware  for  the  implementation  of  VRET  are
key  discussions  that  require  a  high  degree  of  fidelity  to
replicate  real-world  environments.  The  use  of  VRET  should
reinforce  the  concepts  of  presence  and  customization  for
enhancing its efficacy and for stabilizing the evidence base
for  VR-based  clinical  therapies  [26].  VR  technologies  can
potentially enrich and reinforce therapies, providing a more
engaging,
 and  effective  diagnostic  and
therapeutic  experience  for  patients  [27].

 personalized,

4.5. Therapeutic Validity

Therapeutic  validity  is  typically  assessed  based  on
various factors, including the classification of the disorder to
be  treated,  its  stage,  the  strategy  used  for  evaluating
treatment outcomes, and various demographic factors such
as  age  group,  patient  profile,  and  technologies  employed,
among others.

VR  offers  unlimited  opportunities  that  enable  the
adaptation  of  specific  approaches  to  complex  problems
and facilitate the individualization of interventions. Meta-
analyses  of  articles  on  the  implementation  of  VR  for  the
treatment  of  panic  disorder  revealed  highly  significant
outcomes  [24,  28].

Another  meta-analysis  demonstrated  that  the  treat-
ment outcomes of VR are comparable to those of conven-
tional treatments and are transferable and generalizable
to real-life situations [20].

VRET  has  been  extensively  investigated  and  applied
for  the  treatment  of  anxiety  disorders.  Previous  studies
have  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  VR  in  generating

exposure  scenarios  that  simulate  real-world  situations,
leading  to  a  reduction  in  anxiety  symptoms.  It  has  been
reported that VRET is more effective in reducing disease
symptoms  compared  to  the  individuals  in  the  waitlist
group  [29].

VR  displays  immense  therapeutic  potential

 and
researchers  are  of  the  opinion  that  highly  standardized
exposure  procedures  should  be  utilized  for  achieving
therapy  [12].

It has been confirmed that VR-based therapy for panic
disorder displays significant correlations with assessments
conducted  without  VR.  The  application  of  VR  for  the
treatment of panic disorder has demonstrated its validity
as a potential therapeutic strategy for this disorder [30].

VR  has  been  explored  as  a  promising  strategy  for
addressing body image distortion and dysfunctional eating
behaviors in individuals with eating disorders [31].

 VR-based  therapy.

Another study demonstrated that VRET yields positive
outcomes during the treatment of most phobias, although
results  can  vary  depending  on  the  specific  disorder  and
the resources employed [21]. Among the various factors,
the  age  group  of  patients  can  significantly  influence  the
 The
evolution  and  efficacy  of
application  of  VR-based  treatment  in  children  and
adolescents within therapeutic contexts remains an aspect
that  has  been  scarcely  investigated  to  date.  VRET  is  a
potentially effective approach for exposure-based therapy,
especially  for  adolescents,  due  to  its  low  barriers  and
incorporation  of  engaging  elements;  however,  there  is  a
scarcity  of  research  in  the  area  [12].  The  treatment  of
adolescent patients, combined with the rapid evolution of
VR technology, can accelerate the implementation of this
technology  for  the  therapeutic  benefit  of  panic  disorder
and other mental conditions.

Therapeutic validity also encompasses the utilization of
self-guided  digital  VR  in  the  absence  of  face-to-face
therapists  interacting  virtually,  and  sometimes  even
without  any  online  therapist.  The  expansion  of  VRET  is
still  in  its  initial  and  exploratory  stages,  and  further
studies  are  necessary  to  confirm  its  therapeutic  validity.
The implementation of self-guided VR yields inconsistent
results  and  has  been  shown  to  have  limited  therapeutic
efficacy [25].

4.6. Limitations

Temporal  delimitations  can  impose  limitations  when
researching  VR-based  technologies,  as  the  articles  from
the beginning of the decade, although valuable, may have
certain limitations that could already have been resolved
by  the  end  of  the  decade.  In  several  cases,  the  articles
selected  from  2013  to  2017  are  based  on  technical
alternatives that evolved after this period. This limitation
was  mitigated  by  the  significantly  higher  number  of
selected  articles  (82%)  in  the  second  half  of  the  decade.
The use of CS on a regular TV screen, combined with the
lack of interactivity, can pose a limitation [21]. However,
these limitations were resolved in the second half of the
decade by implementing VRET using 3D glasses.

Virtual Reality in the Treatment of Panic Disorder

Another limitation is the use of protective factors, such
 which  are  frequently
as  counseling  interventions,
implemented  without  prescriptions  for  preventing  or
alleviating  disease  symptoms.  However,  this  aspect  was
not explored as it was beyond the scope of this study.

The  application  of  VR  for  the  treatment  of  panic
disorder has been less thoroughly researched compared to
other conditions, such as anxiety disorder. However, there
has been a notable increase in the number of studies on
the  application  of  VRET  for  the  treatment  of  panic
disorder in recent years, confirming positive developments
in this field.

VRET is most frequently implemented in universities,
irrespective of the type of disorder, which is advantageous
for  the  further  development  of  VRET  in  mental  health.
However, the evolution of VRET remains limited in clinical
practice,  which  restricts  an  exploration  of  its  outcomes.
Although  this  scenario  does  not  pose  a  limitation  to  the
advancement of the study, it is nevertheless structured to
facilitate its progression in the medical field.

The limitations of the selected articles were resolved
over  the  years  owing  to  the  evolution  of  VR-based
technologies  from  the  beginning  of  the  decade  to  the
present.

CONCLUSION

Digital  technologies  have  become  an  integral  part  of
our daily lives. The landscape of modern VR has evolved
significantly  compared  to  the  VR  systems  used  in  the
majority  of  studies  published  prior  to  2018.  Significant
progress  has  been  recorded  since  2018  in  terms  of  the
increase  in  the  number  of  studies,  number  of  countries
involved, sample sizes, and patient outcomes. It has been
reported that VRET has received positive responses from
participants  compared  to  traditional  iVET,  making  it  an
attractive alternative therapy. However, it should be noted
that  cost  and  performance  issues  may  depend  on  the
specific  disorder  targeted  for  therapy.  It  has  been
suggested  that  patients  are  satisfied  with  VR-based
therapy and may find it more acceptable than traditional
approaches.

Previous  studies  provide  evidence  supporting  the
positive  outcomes  of  VR-based  therapy  in  psychiatric
disorders;  however,  its  efficacy  depends  on  the  specific
area of the study.

Numerous  studies  on  the  use  of  VR-based  exposure
therapy  for  phobias,  in  general,  have  allowed  for  the
formulation of recommendations for the implementation of
VRET, thereby enabling therapeutic efficacy. It has been
demonstrated  that  VR-based  therapy  is  an  effective
therapeutic strategy for panic disorder, and its outcomes
are superior to those of standard interventions.

Despite  the  technological  complexity,  it  is  expected
that VR-based therapy will experience significant growth
within  the  field  of  mental  health,  as  indicated  by  its
evolution over the last decade, an increase in the number
of published articles, and the growing number of countries
engaged in research on VR-based therapy.

It has been demonstrated that the efficacy of VR-based
strategies  for  the  treatment  of  panic  disorder  and  the
outcomes are superior to those of standard interventions.

The  future  of  research  on  mental  disorders  appears
promising,  with  the  implementation  of  VR  poised  to
transform  diagnostic  and  treatment  practices  while
potentially  influencing  mental  health  policies.
