ADHD: Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, 
and Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in 
Children and Adolescents

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, STEERING 
COMMITTEE ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of 
childhood and can profoundly affect the academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions 
of children; the American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for the 
diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed 
in 2001.

INTRODUCTION

This document updates and replaces 2 previously published clinical guidelines from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on the diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children: “Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and 
Evaluation of the Child With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” (2000)1 and 
“Clinical Practice Guideline: Treatment of the School-aged Child With Attention-Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder” (2001).2 Since these guidelines were published, new information 
and evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD has become available. 
Surveys conducted before and after the publication of the previous guidelines have also 
provided insight into pediatricians’ attitudes and practices regarding ADHD. On the basis of 
an increased understanding regarding ADHD and the challenges it raises for children and 
families and as a source for clinicians seeking to diagnose and treat children, this guideline 
pays particular attention to a number of areas.

Expanded Age Range

The previous guidelines addressed diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children 6 through 
12 years of age. There is now emerging evidence to expand the age range of the 
recommendations to include preschool-aged children and adolescents. This guideline 
addresses the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in children 4 through 18 years of age, and 
attention is brought to special circumstances or concerns in particular age groups when 
appropriate.

Expanded Scope

Behavioral interventions might help families of children with hyperactive/impulsive 
behaviors that do not meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Guidance regarding the 
diagnosis of problem-level concerns in children based on the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Primary Care (DSM-PC), Child and Adolescent Version,3 as well as suggestions 
for treatment and care of children and families with problem-level concerns, are provided 
here. The current DSM-PC was published in 1996 and, therefore, is not consistent with 
intervening changes to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM). Although this version of the DSM-PC should not be used as a 
definitive source for diagnostic codes related to ADHD and comorbid conditions, it certainly 
may continue to be used as a resource for enriching the understanding of ADHD 
manifestations. The DSM-PC will be revised when both the DSM-V and ICD-10 are 
available for use.

A Process of Care for Diagnosis and Treatment

This guideline and process-of-care algorithm (see Supplemental Fig 2 and Supplemental 
Appendix) recognizes evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as a continuous process and 
provides recommendations for both the guideline and the algorithm in this single 
publication. In addition to the formal recommendations for assessment, diagnosis, and 
treatment, this guideline provides a single algorithm to guide the clinical process.

Integration With the Task Force on Mental Health

This guideline fits into the broader mission of the AAP Task Force on Mental Health and its 
efforts to provide a base from which primary care providers can develop alliances with 
families, work to prevent mental health conditions and identify them early, and collaborate 
with mental health clinicians.

The diagnosis and management of ADHD in children and youth has been particularly 
challenging for primary care clinicians because of the limited payment provided for what 
requires more time than most of the other conditions they typically address. The procedures 
recommended in this guideline necessitate spending more time with patients and families, 
developing a system of contacts with school and other personnel, and providing continuous, 
coordinated care, all of which is time demanding. In addition, relegating mental health 
conditions exclusively to mental health clinicians also is not a viable solution for many 
clinicians, because in many areas access to mental health clinicians to whom they can refer 
patients is limited. Access in many areas is also limited to psychologists when further 
assessment of cognitive issues is required and not available through the education system 
because of restrictions from third-party payers in paying for the evaluations on the basis of 
them being educational and not health related.

Cultural differences in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are an important issue, as they 
are for all pediatric conditions. Because the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD depends to a 
great extent on family and teacher perceptions, these issues might be even more prominent 
an issue for ADHD. Specific cultural issues are beyond the scope of this guideline but are 
important to consider.

METHODOLOGY

As with the 2 previously published clinical guidelines, the AAP collaborated with several 
organizations to develop a working subcommittee that represented a wide range of primary 
care and subspecialty groups. The subcommittee included primary care pediatricians, 
developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and representatives from the American Academy of 
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Child Neurology Society, the Society for Pediatric 
Psychology, the National Association of School Psychologists, the Society for 
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, 
and Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), as well 
as an epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This group met over a 2-year period, during which it reviewed the changes in practice that 
have occurred and issues that have been identified since the previous guidelines were

published. Delay in completing the process led to further conference calls and extended the 
years of literature reviewed in order to remain as current as possible. The AAP funded the 
development of this guideline; potential financial conflicts of the participants were identified 
and taken into consideration in the deliberations. The guideline will be reviewed and/or 
revised in 5 years unless new evidence emerges that warrants revision sooner.

The subcommittee developed a series of research questions to direct an extensive evidence-
based review in partnership with the CDC and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences 
Center. The diagnostic review was conducted by the CDC, and the evidence was evaluated 
in a combined effort of the AAP, CDC, and University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center 
staff. The treatment-related evidence relied on a recent evidence review by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality and was supplemented by evidence identified through the 
CDC review.

The diagnostic issues were focused on 5 areas:

1. ADHD prevalence—specifically: (a) What percentage of the general US population 
aged 21 years or younger has ADHD? (b) What percentage of patients presenting at 
pediatricians’ or family physicians’ offices in the United States meet diagnostic 
criteria for ADHD?

2. Co-occurring mental disorders—of people with ADHD, what percentage has 1 or 

more of the following co-occurring conditions: sleep disorders, learning 
disabilities, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant 
disorder?

3. What are the functional impairments of children and youth diagnosed with ADHD? 

Specifically, in what domains and to what degree do youth with ADHD 
demonstrate impairments in functional domains, including peer relations, academic 
performance, adaptive skills, and family functioning?

4. Do behavior rating scales remain the standard of care in assessing the diagnostic 

criteria for ADHD?

5. What is the prevalence of abnormal findings on selected medical screening tests 

commonly recommended as standard components of an evaluation of a child with 
suspected ADHD? How accurate are these tests in the diagnosis of ADHD 
compared with a reference standard (ie, what are the psychometric properties of 
these tests)?

The treatment issues were focused on 3 areas:

1. What new information is available regarding the long-term efficacy and safety of 
medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of ADHD (stimulants and nonstimulants), and specifically, what 
information is available about the efficacy and safety of these medications in 
preschool-aged and adolescent patients?

2. What evidence is available about the long-term efficacy and safety of psychosocial 
interventions (behavioral modification) for the treatment of ADHD for children,

based?

Evidence-Review Process for Diagnosis

A multilevel, systematic approach was taken to identify the literature that built the evidence 
base for both diagnosis and treatment. To increase the likelihood that relevant articles were 
included in the final evidence base, the reviewers first conducted a scoping review of the 
literature by systematically searching literature using relevant key words and then 
summarized the primary findings of articles that met standard inclusion criteria. The 
reviewers then created evidence tables that were reviewed by content-area experts who were 
best able to identify articles that might have been missed through the scoping review. 
Articles that were missed were reviewed carefully to determine where the abstraction 
methodology failed, and adjustments to the search strategy were made as required (see 
technical report to be published). Finally, although published literature reviews did not 
contribute directly to the evidence base, the articles included in review articles were cross-
referenced with the final evidence tables to ensure that all relevant articles were included in 
the final evidence tables.

For the scoping review, articles were abstracted in a stratified fashion from 3 article-retrieval 
systems that provided access to articles in the domains of medicine, psychology, and 
education: PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez), PsycINFO (www.apa.org/pubs/
databases/psycinfo/index.aspx), and ERIC (www.eric.ed.gov). English-language, peer-
reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2009 were queried in the 3 search engines. 
Key words were selected with the intent of including all possible articles that might have 
been relevant to 1 or more of the questions of interest (see the technical report to be 
published). The primary abstraction included the following terms: “attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder” or “attention deficit disorder” or “hyperkinesis” and “child.” A 
second, independent abstraction was conducted to identify articles related to medical 
screening tests for ADHD. For this abstraction, the same search terms were used as in the 
previous procedure along with the additional condition term “behavioral problems” to allow 
for the inclusion of studies of youth that sought to diagnose ADHD by using medical 
screening tests. Abstractions were conducted in parallel fashion across each of the 3 
databases; the results from each abstraction (complete reference, abstract, and key words) 
were exported and compiled into a common reference database using EndNote 10.0.4 
References were subsequently and systematically deduplicated by using the software’s 
deduplication procedure. References for books, chapters, and theses were also deleted from 
the library. Once a deduplicated library was developed, the semifinal database of 8267 
references was reviewed for inclusion on the basis of inclusion criteria listed in the technical 
report. Included articles were then pulled in their entirety, the inclusion criteria were 
reconfirmed, and then the study findings were summarized in evidence tables. The articles 
included in relevant review articles were revisited to ensure their inclusion in the final 
evidence base. The evidence tables were then presented to the committee for expert review.

Evidence-Review Process for Treatment

Page 6

In addition to this systematic review, for treatment we used the review from the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Effective Healthcare Program “Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder: Effectiveness of Treatment in At-Risk Preschoolers; Long-term 
Effectiveness in All Ages; and Variability in Prevalence, Diagnosis, and Treatment.”5 This 
review addressed a number of key questions for the committee, including the efficacy of 
medications and behavioral interventions for preschoolers, children, and adolescents. 
Evidence identified through the systematic evidence review for diagnosis was also used as a 
secondary data source to supplement the evidence presented in the AHRQ report. The draft 
practice guidelines were developed by consensus of the committee regarding the evidence. It 
was decided to create 2 separate components. The guideline recommendations were based 
on clear characterization of the evidence. The second component is a practice-of-care 
algorithm (see Supplemental Fig 2) that provides considerably more detail about how to 
implement the guidelines but is, necessarily, based less on available evidence and more on 
consensus of the committee members. When data were lacking, particularly in the process-
of-care algorithmic portion of the guidelines, a combination of evidence and expert 
consensus was used. Action statements labeled “strong recommendation” or 
“recommendation” were based on high- to moderate-quality scientific evidence and a 
preponderance of benefit over harm.6 Option-level action statements were based on lesser-
quality or limited data and expert consensus or high-quality evidence with a balance 
between benefits and harms. These clinical options are interventions that a reasonable health 
care provider might or might not wish to implement in his or her practice. The quality of 
evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of each recommendation were 
assessed by the committee member most experienced in epidemiology and graded according 
to AAP policy (Fig 1).6

The guidelines and process-of-care algorithm underwent extensive peer review by 
committees, sections, councils, and task forces within the AAP; numerous outside 
organizations; and other individuals identified by the subcommittee. Liaisons to the 
subcommittee also were invited to distribute the draft to entities within their organizations. 
The resulting comments were compiled and reviewed by the chairperson, and relevant 
changes were incorporated into the draft, which was then reviewed by the full committee.

ABOUT THIS GUIDELINE

Key Action Statements

In light of the concerns highlighted previously and informed by the available evidence, the 
AAP has developed 6 action statements for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of 
ADHD in children. These action statements provide for consistent and quality care for 
children and families with concerns about or symptoms that suggest attention disorders or 
problems.

Context

This guideline is intended to be integrated with the broader algorithms developed as part of 
the mission of the AAP Task Force on Mental Health.7

Implementation: A Process-of-Care Algorithm

The AAP recognizes the challenge of instituting practice changes and adopting new 
recommendations for care. To address the need, a process-of-care algorithm has been 
developed and has been used in the revision of the AAP ADHD toolkit.

Implementation: Preparing the Practice

Page 7

Full implementation of the action statements described in this guideline and the process-of-
care algorithm might require changes in office procedures and/or preparatory efforts to 
identify community resources. The section titled “Preparing the Practice” in the process-of-
care algorithm and further information can be found in the supplement to the Task Force on 
Mental Health report.7 It is important to document all aspects of the diagnostic and 
treatment procedures in the patients’ records. Use of rating scales for the diagnosis of 
ADHD and assessment for comorbid conditions and as a method for monitoring treatment as 
described in the process algorithm (see Supplemental Fig 2), as well as information provided 
to parents such as management plans, can help facilitate a clinician’s accurate 
documentation of his or her process.

Note

The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians might not be confident of their 
ability to successfully diagnose and treat ADHD in a child because of the child’s age, 
coexisting conditions, or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels that he or 
she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about making a diagnosis or continuing with 
treatment, a referral to a pediatric or mental health subspecialist should be made. If a 
diagnosis of ADHD or other condition is made by a subspecialist, the primary care clinician 
should develop a management strategy with the subspecialist that ensures that the child will 
continue to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model wherein the 
pediatrician partners with parents so that both health and mental health needs are integrated.

KEY ACTION STATEMENTS FOR THE EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, 

TREATMENT, AND MONITORING OF ADHD IN CHILDREN AND 

ADOLESCENTS

Action statement 1: The primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for 
any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or behavioral problems and 
symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong 
recommendation).

Evidence Profile

•

•

Aggregate evidence quality: B.

Benefits: In a considerable number of children, ADHD goes undiagnosed. Primary 
care clinicians’ systematic identification of children with these problems will likely 
decrease the rate of undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in children.

• Harms/risks/costs: Children in whom ADHD is inappropriately diagnosed might 
be labeled inappropriately, or another condition might be missed, and they might 
receive treatments that will not benefit them.

•

•

•

•

•

•

Benefits-harms assessment: The high prevalence of ADHD and limited mental 
health resources require primary care pediatricians to play a significant role in the 
care of their patients with ADHD so that children with this condition receive the 
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Treatments available have shown good 
evidence of efficacy, and lack of treatment results in a risk for impaired outcomes.

Value judgments: The committee considered the requirements for establishing the 
diagnosis, the prevalence of ADHD, and the efficacy and adverse effects of 
treatment as well as the long-term outcomes.

Role of patient preferences: Success with treatment depends on patient and family 
preference, which has to be taken into account.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: The limits between what can be handled by a primary care 
clinician and what should be referred to a subspecialist because of the varying 
degrees of skills among primary care clinicians.

Strength: strong recommendation.

The basis for this recommendation is essentially unchanged from that in the previous 
guideline. ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in children and occurs in 
approximately 8% of children and youth8–10; the number of children with this condition is 
far greater than can be managed by the mental health system. There is now increased 
evidence that appropriate diagnosis can be provided for preschool-aged children11 (4–5 
years of age) and for adolescents.12

Action statement 2: To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should 
determine that Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
(DSM-IV-TR) criteria have been met (including documentation of impairment in more than 
1 major setting), and information should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or 
guardians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians involved in the child’s 
care. The primary care clinician should also rule out any alternative cause (quality of 
evidence B/strong recommendation).

Evidence Profile

•

•

Aggregate evidence quality: B.

Benefits: The use of DSM-IV criteria has lead to more uniform categorization of 
the condition across professional disciplines.

• Harms/risks/costs: The DSM-IV system does not specifically provide for 
developmental-level differences and might lead to some misdiagnoses.

•

Benefits-harms assessment: The benefits far outweigh the harm.

Value judgments: The committee took into consideration the importance of 
coordination between pediatric and mental health services.

Role of patient preferences: Although there is some stigma associated with 
mental disorder diagnoses resulting in some families preferring other diagnoses, the 
need for better clarity in diagnoses was felt to outweigh this preference.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: None.

Strength: strong recommendation.

As with the findings in the previous guideline, the DSM-IV criteria continue to be the 
criteria best supported by evidence and consensus. Developed through several iterations by 
the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM-IV criteria were created through use of 
consensus and an expanding research foundation.13 The DSM-IV system is used by 
professionals in psychiatry, psychology, health care systems, and primary care. Use of 
DSM-IV criteria, in addition to having the best evidence to date for criteria for ADHD, also 
affords the best method for communication across clinicians and is established with third-
party payers. The criteria are under review for the development of the DSM-V, but these 
changes will not be available until at least 1 year after the publication of this current 
guideline. The diagnostic criteria have not changed since the previous guideline and are 
presented in Supplemental Table 2. An anticipated change in the DSM-V is increasing the 
age limit for when ADHD needs to have first presented from 7 to 12 years.14

Special Circumstances: Preschool-aged Children (4–5 Years Old)—There is 
evidence that the diagnostic criteria for ADHD can be applied to preschool-aged children; 
however, the subtypes detailed in the DSM-IV might not be valid for this population.15–21 A 
review of the literature, including the multisite study of the efficacy of methylphenidate in 
preschool-aged children, revealed that the criteria could appropriately identify children with 
the condition.11 However, there are added challenges in determining the presence of key 
symptoms. Preschool-aged children are not likely to have a separate observer if they do not 
attend a preschool or child care program, and even if they do attend, staff in those programs 
might be less qualified than certified teachers to provide accurate observations. Here, too, 
focused checklists can help physicians in the diagnostic evaluation, although only the 
Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales and the ADHD Rating Scale IV are DSM-
IV– based scales that have been validated in preschool-aged children.22

When there are concerns about the availability or quality of nonparent observations of a 
child’s behavior, physicians may recommend that parents complete a parent-training 
program before confirming an ADHD diagnosis for preschool-aged children and consider 
placement in a qualified preschool program if they have not done so already. Information 
can be obtained from parents and teachers through the use of validated DSM-IV–based 
ADHD rating scales. The parent-training program must include helping parents develop age-
appropriate developmental expectations and specific management skills for problem 
behaviors. The clinician may obtain reports from the parenting class instructor about the 
parents’ ability to manage their children, and if the children are in programs in which they

are directly observed, instructors can report information about the core symptoms and 
function of the child directly. Qualified preschool programs include programs such as Head 
Start or other public prekindergarten programs. Preschool-aged children who display 
significant emotional or behavioral concerns might also qualify for Early Childhood Special 
Education services through their local school districts, and the evaluators for these programs 
and/or Early Childhood Special Education teachers might be excellent reporters of core 
symptoms.

Special Circumstances: Adolescents—Obtaining teacher reports for adolescents 
might be more challenging, because many adolescents will have multiple teachers. 
Likewise, parents might have less opportunity to observe their adolescent’s behaviors than 
they had when their children were younger. Adolescents’ reports of their own behaviors 
often differ from those of other observers, because they tend to minimize their own 
problematic behaviors.23–25 Adolescents are less likely to exhibit overt hyperactive 
behavior. Despite the difficulties, clinicians need to try to obtain (with agreement from the 
adolescent) information from at least 2 teachers as well as information from other sources 
such as coaches, school guidance counselors, or leaders of community activities in which the 
adolescent participates. In addition, it is unusual for adolescents with behavioral/attention 
problems not to have been previously given a diagnosis of ADHD. Therefore, it is important 
to establish the younger manifestations of the condition that were missed and to strongly 
consider substance use, depression, and anxiety as alternative or co-occurring diagnoses. 
Adolescents with ADHD, especially when untreated, are at greater risk of substance 
abuse.26 In addition, the risks of mood and anxiety disorders and risky sexual behaviors 
increase during adolescence.12

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem 
Level)—Teachers, parents, and child health professionals typically encounter children with 
behaviors relating to activity level, impulsivity, and inattention who might not fully meet 
DSM-IV criteria. The DSM-PC3 provides a guide to the more common behaviors seen in 
pediatrics. The manual describes common variations in behavior as well as more 
problematic behaviors at levels of less impairment than those specified in the DSM-IV.

The behavioral descriptions of the DSM-PC have not yet been tested in community studies 
to determine the prevalence or severity of developmental variations and problems in the 
areas of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. They do, however, provide guidance to 
clinicians regarding elements of treatment for children with problems with mild-to-moderate 
inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. The DSM-PC also considers environmental 
influences on a child’s behavior and provides information on differential diagnosis with a 
developmental perspective.

Action statement 3: In the evaluation of a child for ADHD, the primary care clinician should 
include assessment for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including emotional 
or behavioral (eg, anxiety, depressive, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders), 
developmental (eg, learning and language disorders or other neurodevelopmental disorders), 
and physical (eg, tics, sleep apnea) conditions (quality of evidence B/strong 
recommendation).

Aggregate evidence quality: B.

Benefits: Identifying coexisting conditions is important for developing the most 
appropriate treatment plan.

• Harms/risks/costs: The major risk is mis-diagnosing the conditions and providing 

inappropriate care.

Benefits-harms assessment: There is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

Value judgments: The committee members took into consideration the common 
occurrence of coexisting conditions and the importance of addressing them in 
making this recommendation.

Role of patient preferences: None.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: None.

Strength: strong recommendation.

A variety of other behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions can coexist in 
children who are evaluated for ADHD. These conditions include, but are not limited to, 
learning problems, language disorder, disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic 
disorders, seizures, developmental coordination disorder, or sleep disorders.23,24,27–38 In 
some cases, the presence of a coexisting condition will alter the treatment of ADHD. The 
primary care clinician might benefit from additional support and guidance or might need to 
refer a child with ADHD and coexisting conditions, such as severe mood or anxiety 
disorders, to subspecialists for assessment and management. The subspecialists could 
include child psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental 
disability physicians, child neurologists, or child or school psychologists.

Given the likelihood that another condition exists, primary care clinicians should conduct 
assessments that determine or at least identify the risk of coexisting conditions. Through its 
Task Force on Mental Health, the AAP has developed algorithms and a toolkit39 for 
assessing and treating (or comanaging) the most common developmental disorders and 
mental health concerns in children. These resources might be useful in assessing children 
who are being evaluated for ADHD. Payment for evaluation and treatment must cover the 
fixed and variable costs of providing the services, as noted in the AAP policy statement 
“Scope of Health Care Benefits for Children From Birth Through Age 26.40

Special Circumstances: Adolescents—Clinicians should assess adolescent patients 
with newly diagnosed ADHD for symptoms and signs of substance abuse; when these signs 
and symptoms are found, evaluation and treatment for addiction should precede treatment 
for ADHD, if possible, or careful treatment for ADHD can begin if necessary.25

Action statement 4: The primary care clinician should recognize ADHD as a chronic 
condition and, therefore, consider children and adolescents with ADHD as children and

care needs should follow the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home 
(quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

Evidence Profile

•

•

Aggregate evidence quality: B.

Benefits: The recommendation describes the coordinated services most appropriate 
for managing the condition.

• Harms/risks/costs: Providing the services might be more costly.

•

•

•

•

•

•

Benefits-harms assessment: There is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

Value judgments: The committee members considered the value of medical home 
services when deciding to make this recommendation.

Role of patient preferences: Family preference in how these services are provided 
is an important consideration.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: None.

Strength: strong recommendation.

As in the previous guideline, this recommendation is based on the evidence that ADHD 
continues to cause symptoms and dysfunction in many children who have the condition over 
long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that the treatments available address 
symptoms and function but are usually not curative. Although the chronic illness model has 
not been specifically studied in children and youth with ADHD, it has been effective for 
other chronic conditions such as asthma,23 and the medical home model has been accepted 
as the preferred standard of care.41 The management process is also helped by encouraging 
strong family-school partnerships.42

Longitudinal studies have found that, frequently, treatments are not sustained despite the 
fact that long-term outcomes for children with ADHD indicate that they are at greater risk of 
significant problems if they discontinue treatment.43 Because a number of parents of 
children with ADHD also have ADHD, extra support might be necessary to help those 
parents provide medication on a consistent basis and institute a consistent behavioral 
program. The medical home and chronic illness approach is provided in the process 
algorithm (Supplemental Fig 2). An important process in ongoing care is bidirectional 
communication with teachers and other school and mental health clinicians involved in the 
child’s care as well as with parents and patients.

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem 
Level)—Children with inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity at the problem level (DSM-
PC) and their families might also benefit from the same chronic illness and medical home 
principles.

Action statement 5: Recommendations for treatment of children and youth with ADHD vary 
depending on the patient’s age.

Action statement 5a: For preschoolaged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care 
clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior 
therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and 
may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant 
improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child’s function. 
In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs 
to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying 
diagnosis and treatment (quality of evidence B/recommendation).

Evidence Profile

•

•

Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate.

Benefits: Both behavior therapy and methylphenidate have been demonstrated to 
reduce behaviors associated with ADHD and improve function.

• Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy 
requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some 
potential adverse effects.

•

•

•

•

•

•

Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits 
outweigh the risks.

Value judgments: The committee members included the effects of untreated 
ADHD when deciding to make this recommendation.

Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the 
treatment plan.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: None.

Strength: strong recommendation.

Action statement 5b: For elementary school-aged children (6–11 years of age), the primary 
care clinician should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD (quality of evidence 
A/strong recommendation) and/or evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered 
behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both (quality of evidence B/strong 
recommendation). The evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications and 
sufficient but less strong for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release 
clonidine (in that order) (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation). The school 
environment, program, or placement is a part of any treatment plan.

Medication

Page 15

Similar to the recommendations from the previous guideline, stimulant medications are 
highly effective for most children in reducing core symptoms of ADHD.44 One selective 
norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine45,46) and 2 selective α2-adrenergic agonists 
(extended-release guanfacine47,48 and extended-release clonidine49) have also demonstrated 
efficacy in reducing core symptoms. Because norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors and α2-
adrenergic agonists are newer, the evidence base that supports them—although adequate for 
FDA approval—is considerably smaller than that for stimulants. None of them have been 
approved for use in preschool-aged children. Compared with stimulant medications that 
have an effect size [effect size = (treatment mean — control mean)/control SD] of 
approximately 1.0,50 the effects of the nonstimulants are slightly weaker; atomoxetine has 
an effect size of approximately 0.7, and extended-release guanfacine and extended-release 
clonidine also have effect sizes of approximately 0.7.

The accompanying process-of-care algorithm provides a list of the currently available FDA-
approved medications for ADHD (Supplemental Table 3). Characteristics of each 
medication are provided to help guide the clinician’s choice in prescribing medication.

As was identified in the previous guideline, the most common stimulant adverse effects are 
appetite loss, abdominal pain, headaches, and sleep disturbance. The results of the 
Multimodal Therapy of ADHD (MTA) study revealed a more persistent effect of stimulants 
on decreasing growth velocity than have most previous studies, particularly when children 
were on higher and more consistently administered doses. The effects diminished by the 
third year of treatment, but no compensatory rebound effects were found.51 However, 
diminished growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm. An uncommon additional significant 
adverse effect of stimulants is the occurrence of hallucinations and other psychotic 
symptoms.52 Although concerns have been raised about the rare occurrence of sudden 
cardiac death among children using stimulant medications,53 sudden death in children on 
stimulant medication is extremely rare, and evidence is conflicting as to whether stimulant 
medications increase the risk of sudden death.54–56 It is important to expand the history to 
include specific cardiac symptoms, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, sudden death in the 
family, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and long QT syndrome. Preschool-aged children 
might experience increased mood lability and dysphoria.57 For the nonstimulant 
atomoxetine, the adverse effects include initial somnolence and gastrointestinal tract 
symptoms, particularly if the dosage is increased too rapidly; decrease in appetite; increase 
in suicidal thoughts (less common); and hepatitis (rare). For the nonstimulant α2-adrenergic 
agonists extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine, adverse effects include 
somnolence and dry mouth.

Only 2 medications have evidence to support their use as adjunctive therapy with stimulant 
medications sufficient to achieve FDA approval: extended-release guanfacine26 and 
extended-release clonidine. Other medications have been used in combination off-label, but 
there is currently only anecdotal evidence for their safety or efficacy, so their use cannot be 
recommended at this time.

Special Circumstances: Preschoolaged Children—A number of special 
circumstances support the recommendation to initiate ADHD treatment in preschool-aged 
children (ages 4–5 years) with behavioral therapy alone first.57 These circumstances include:

•

•

•

The multisite study of methylphenidate57 was limited to preschool-aged children 
who had moderate-to-severe dysfunction.

The study also found that many children (ages 4–5 years) experience improvements 
in symptoms with behavior therapy alone, and the overall evidence for behavior 
therapy in preschool-aged children is strong.

Behavioral programs for children 4 to 5 years of age typically run in the form of 
group parent-training programs and, although not always compensated by health 
insurance, have a lower cost. The process algorithm (see Supplemental pages s15–
16) contains criteria for the clinician to use in assessing the quality of the 
behavioral therapy. In addition, programs such as Head Start and Children and 
Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) (www.chadd.org) 
might provide some behavioral supports.

Many young children with ADHD might still require medication to achieve maximum 
improvement, and medication is not contraindicated for children 4 through 5 years of age. 
However, only 1 multisite study has carefully assessed medication use in preschool-aged 
children. Other considerations in the recommendation about treating children 4 to 5 years of 
age with stimulant medications include:

•

•

•

•

The study was limited to preschool-aged children who had moderate-to-severe 
dysfunction.

Research has found that a number of young children (4–5 years of age) experience 
improvements in symptoms with behavior therapy alone.

There are concerns about the possible effects on growth during this rapid growth 
period of preschool-aged children.

There has been limited information about and experience with the effects of 
stimulant medication in children between the ages of 4 and 5 years.

Here, the criteria for enrollment (and, therefore, medication use) included measures of 
severity that distinguished treated children from the larger group of preschool-aged children 
with ADHD. Thus, before initiating medications, the physician should assess the severity of 
the child’s ADHD. Given current data, only those preschool-aged children with ADHD who 
have moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication. Criteria for this 
level of severity, based on the multisite-study results,57 are (1) symptoms that have persisted 
for at least 9 months, (2) dysfunction that is manifested in both the home and other settings 
such as preschool or child care, and (3) dysfunction that has not responded adequately to 
behavior therapy. The decision to consider initiating medication at this age depends in part 
on the clinician’s assessment of the estimated developmental impairment, safety risks, or 
consequences for school or social participation that could ensue if medications are not 
initiated. It is often helpful to consult with a mental health specialist who has had specific 
experience with preschool-aged children if possible.

Dextroamphetamine is the only medication approved by the FDA for use in children 
younger than 6 years of age. This approval, however, was based on less stringent criteria in 
force when the medication was approved rather than on empirical evidence of its safety and 
efficacy in this age group. Most of the evidence for the safety and efficacy of treating 
preschool-aged children with stimulant medications has been from methylphenidate.57 
Methylphenidate evidence consists of 1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller 
single-site studies that included from 11 to 59 children (total of 269 children); 7 of the 10 
single-site studies found significant efficacy. It must be noted that although there is 
moderate evidence that methylphenidate is safe and efficacious in preschool-aged children, 
its use in this age group remains off-label. Although the use of dextroamphetamine is on-
label, the insufficient evidence for its safety and efficacy in this age group does not make it 
possible to recommend at this time.

If children do not experience adequate symptom improvement with behavior therapy, 
medication can be prescribed, as described previously. Evidence suggests that the rate of 
metabolizing stimulant medication is slower in children 4 through 5 years of age, so they 
should be given a lower dose to start, and the dose can be increased in smaller increments. 
Maximum doses have not been adequately studied.57

Special Circumstances: Adolescents—As noted previously, before beginning 
medication treatment for adolescents with newly diagnosed ADHD, clinicians should assess 
these patients for symptoms of substance abuse. When substance use is identified, 
assessment when off the abusive substances should precede treatment for ADHD (see the 
Task Force on Mental Health report7). Diversion of ADHD medication (use for other than 
its intended medical purposes) is also a special concern among adolescents58; clinicians 
should monitor symptoms and prescription-refill requests for signs of misuse or diversion of 
ADHD medication and consider prescribing medications with no abuse potential, such as 
atomoxetine (Strattera [Ely Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN]) and extended-release guanfacine 
(Intuniv [Shire US Inc, Wayne, PA]) or extended-release clonidine (Kapvay [Shionogi Inc, 
Florham Park, NJ]) (which are not stimulants) or stimulant medications with less abuse 
potential, such as lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse [Shire US Inc]), dermal methylphenidate 
(Daytrana [Noven Therapeutics, LLC, Miami, FL]), or OROS methylphenidate (Concerta 
[Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Titusville, NJ]). Because lisdexamfetamine is 
dextroamphetamine, which contains an additional lysine molecule, it is only activated after 
ingestion, when it is metabolized by erythrocyte cells to dexamphetamine. The other 
preparations make extraction of the stimulant medication more difficult.

Given the inherent risks of driving by adolescents with ADHD, special concern should be 
taken to provide medication coverage for symptom control while driving. Longer-acting or 
late-afternoon, short-acting medications might be helpful in this regard.59

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem 
Level)—Medication is not appropriate for children whose symptoms do not meet DSM-IV 
criteria for diagnosis of ADHD, although behavior therapy does not require a specific 
diagnosis, and many of the efficacy studies have included children without specific mental 
behavioral disorders.

Behavior Therapy

Page 18

Behavior therapy represents a broad set of specific interventions that have a common goal of 
modifying the physical and social environment to alter or change behavior. Behavior therapy 
usually is implemented by training parents in specific techniques that improve their abilities 
to modify and shape their child’s behavior and to improve the child’s ability to regulate his 
or her own behavior. The training involves techniques to more effectively provide rewards 
when their child demonstrates the desired behavior (eg, positive reinforcement), learn what 
behaviors can be reduced or eliminated by using planned ignoring as an active strategy (or 
using praising and ignoring in combination), or provide appropriate consequences or 
punishments when their child fails to meet the goals (eg, punishment). There is a need to 
consistently apply rewards and consequences as tasks are achieved and then to gradually 
increase the expectations for each task as they are mastered to shape behaviors. Although 
behavior therapy shares a set of principles, individual programs introduce different 
techniques and strategies to achieve the same ends.

Table 1 lists the major behavioral intervention approaches that have been demonstrated to be 
evidence based for the management of ADHD in 3 different types of settings. The table is 
based on 22 studies, each completed between 1997 and 2006.

Evidence for the effectiveness of behavior therapy in children with ADHD is derived from a 
variety of studies60–62 and an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review.5 The 
diversity of interventions and outcome measures makes meta-analysis of the effects of 
behavior therapy alone or in association with medications challenging. The long-term 
positive effects of behavior therapy have yet to be determined. Ongoing adherence to a 
behavior program might be important; therefore, implementing a chronic care model for 
child health might contribute to the long-term effects.63

Study results have indicated positive effects of behavior therapy when combined with 
medications. Most studies that compared behavior therapy to stimulants found a much 
stronger effect on ADHD core symptoms from stimulants than from behavior therapy. The 
MTA study found that combined treatment (behavior therapy and stimulant medication) was 
not significantly more efficacious than treatment with medication alone for the core 
symptoms of ADHD after correction for multiple tests in the primary analysis.64 However, a 
secondary analysis of a combined measure of parent and teacher ratings of ADHD 
symptoms revealed a significant advantage for the combination with a small effect size of d 
= 0.26.65 However, the same study also found that the combined treatment compared with 
medication alone did offer greater improvements on academic and conduct measures when 
ADHD coexisted with anxiety and when children lived in low socioeconomic environments. 
In addition, parents and teachers of children who were receiving combined therapy were 
significantly more satisfied with the treatment plan. Finally, the combination of medication 
management and behavior therapy allowed for the use of lower dosages of stimulants, which 
possibly reduced the risk of adverse effects.66

School Programming and Supports

Page 19

Behavior therapy programs coordinating efforts at school as well as home might enhance the 
effects. School programs can provide classroom adaptations, such as preferred seating, 
modified work assignments, and test modifications (to the location at which it is 
administered and time allotted for taking the test), as well as behavior plans as part of a 504 
Rehabilitation Act Plan or special education Individualized Education Program (IEP) under 
the “other health impairment” designation as part of the Individuals With Disability 
Education Act (IDEA).67 It is helpful for clinicians to be aware of the eligibility criteria in 
their state and school district to advise families of their options. Youths documented to have 
ADHD can also get permission to take college-readiness tests in an untimed manner by 
following appropriate documentation guidelines.68

The effect of coexisting conditions on ADHD treatment is variable. In some cases, treatment 
of the ADHD resolves the coexisting condition. For example, treatment of ADHD might 
resolve oppositional defiant disorder or anxiety.68 However, sometimes the co-occurring 
condition might require treatment that is in addition to the treatment for ADHD. Some 
coexisting conditions can be treated in the primary care setting, but others will require 
referral and co-management with a subspecialist.

Action statement 6: Primary care clinicians should titrate doses of medication for ADHD to 
achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects (quality of evidence B/strong 
recommendation).

Evidence Profile

•

•

Aggregate evidence quality: B.

Benefits: The optimal dose of medication is required to reduce core symptoms to 
or as close to the levels of children without ADHD.

• Harms/risks/costs: Higher levels of medication increase the chances of adverse 

effects.

•

•

•

•

•

•

Benefits-harms assessment: The importance of adequately treating ADHD 
outweighs the risk of adverse effects.

Value judgments: The committee members included the effects of untreated 
ADHD when deciding to make this recommendation.

Role of patient preferences: The families’ preferences and comfort need to be 
taken into consideration in developing a titration plan.

Exclusions: None.

Intentional vagueness: None.

Strength: strong recommendation.

The findings from the MTA study suggested that more than 70% of children and youth with 
ADHD respond to one of the stimulant medications at an optimal dose when a systematic 
trial is used.65 Children in the MTA who were treated in the community with care as usual

from whomever they chose or to whom they had access received lower doses of stimulants 
with less frequent monitoring and had less optimal results.65 Because stimulants might 
produce positive but suboptimal effects at a low dose in some children and youth, titration to 
maximum doses that control symptoms without adverse effects is recommended instead of 
titration strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram basis.

Education of parents is an important component in the chronic illness model to ensure their 
cooperation in efforts to reach appropriate titration (remembering that the parents 
themselves might be challenged significantly by ADHD).69,70 The primary care clinician 
should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a 
medication might be necessary for optimal medication management, that the process might 
require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be 
systematically monitored at regular intervals.

Because stimulant medication effects are seen immediately, trials of different doses of 
stimulants can be accomplished in a relatively short time period. Stimulant medications can 
be effectively titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis.65

It is important to note that by the 3-year follow-up of 14-month MTA interventions (optimal 
medications management, optimal behavioral management, the combination of the 2, or 
community treatment), all differences among the initial 4 groups were no longer present. 
After the initial 14-month intervention, the children no longer received the careful monthly 
monitoring provided by the study and went back to receiving care from their community 
providers. Their medications and doses varied, and a number of them were no longer taking 
medication. In children still on medication, the growth deceleration was only seen for the 
first 2 years and was in the range of 1 to 2 cm.

CONCLUSION

Evidence continues to be fairly clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of 
ADHD and the appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a 
diagnosis, identify co-occurring conditions, and treat effectively with both behavioral and 
pharmacologic interventions. However, the steps required to sustain appropriate treatments 
and achieve successful long-term outcomes still remain a challenge. To provide more 
detailed information about how the recommendations of this guideline can be accomplished, 
a more detailed but less strongly evidence-based algorithm is provided as a companion 
article.

AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Some specific research topics pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD or 
developmental variations or problems in children and adolescents in primary care to be 
explored include:

•

identification or development of reliable instruments suitable to use in primary care 
to assess the nature or degree of functional impairment in children/adolescents with 
ADHD and monitor improvement over time;

Summary of key action statements

1. The primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child 

4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or behavioral problems 
and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (quality of evidence 
B/strong recommendation).

2. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the primary care clinician should determine that 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria 
have been met (including documentation of impairment in more than 1 major 
setting); information should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or 
guardians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians involved in 
the child’s care. The primary care clinician should also rule out any alternative 
cause (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

3.

In the evaluation of a child for ADHD, the primary care clinician should include 
assessment for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including 
emotional or behavioral (eg, anxiety, depressive, oppositional defiant, and 
conduct disorders), developmental (eg, learning and language disorders or other 
neurodevelopmental disorders), and physical (eg, tics, sleep apnea) conditions 
(quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

4. The primary care clinician should recognize ADHD as a chronic condition and, 
therefore, consider children and adolescents with ADHD as children and youth 
with special health care needs. Management of children and youth with special 
health care needs should follow the principles of the chronic care model and the 
medical home (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation).

5. Recommendations for treatment of children and youth with ADHD vary 

depending on the patient’s age:

a. For preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care 
clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-
administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of 
evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe methylphenidate 
if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and 
there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child’s function. 
In areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, 
the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early 
age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (quality of 
evidence B/recommendation).

b. For elementary school–aged children (6–11 years of age), the primary 
care clinician should prescribe US Food and Drug Administration–
approved medications for ADHD (quality of evidence A/strong 
recommendation) and/or evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-
administered behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both 
(quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). The evidence is

particularly strong for stimulant medications and sufficient but less strong 
for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release 
clonidine (in that order) (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation). 
The school environment, program, or placement is a part of any treatment 
plan.

c. For adolescents (12–18 years of age), the primary care clinician should 
prescribe Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for 
ADHD with the assent of the adolescent (quality of evidence A/strong 
recommendation) and may prescribe behavior therapy as treatment for 
ADHD (quality of evidence C/recommendation), preferably both.

6. The primary care clinician should titrate doses of medication for ADHD to 

achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects (quality of evidence B/
strong recommendation).

Integrating evidence-quality appraisal with an assessment of the anticipated balance between 
benefits and harms if a policy is conducted leads to designation of a policy as a strong 
recommendation, recommendation, option, or no recommendation. The evidence is 
discussed in more detail in a technical report that will follow in a later publication. RCT 
indicates randomized controlled trial; Rec, recommendation.

Typical Outcome(s)

Median Effect Sizea

Behavioral parent training (BPT)

Behavioral classroom management

Behavioral peer interventions (BPI)b

0.55

0.61

Behavior-modification 
principles provided to parents 
for implementation in home 
settings

Improved compliance with parental 
commands; improved parental 
understanding of behavioral principles; 
high levels of parental satisfaction with 
treatment

Behavior-modification 
principles provided to teachers 
for implementation in 
classroom settings

Improved attention to instruction; improved 
compliance with classroom rules; decreased 
disruptive behavior; improved work 
productivity

Interventions focused on peer 
interactions/relationships; these 
are often group-based 
interventions provided weekly 
and include clinic-based social-
skills training used either alone 
or concurrently with behavioral 
parent training and/or 
medication

Office-based interventions have produced 
minimal effects; interventions have been of 
questionable social validity; some studies of 
BPI combined with clinic-based BPT found 
positive effects on parent ratings of ADHD 
symptoms; no differences on social 
functioning or parent ratings of social 
behavior have been revealed

a

Effect size = (treatment median − control median)/control SD.

b

The effect size for behavioral peer interventions is not reported, because the effect sizes for these studies represent outcomes associated with 
combined interventions. A lower effect size means that they have less of an effect. The effect sizes found are considered moderate.
