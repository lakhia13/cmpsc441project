Abstract: Pain is the most distressing and disruptive feature of recurrent acute pancreatitis 
(RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) resulting in low quality of life (QOL) and disabilities. 
There  is  no  single,  characteristic  pain  pattern  in  patients  with  RAP  and  CP.  Abdominal 
imaging features of CP accurately reflect morphologic features but they do not correlate with 
pain. Pain is the major driver of poor quality of life (QOL) and it is the constant pain, rather 
than  intermittent  pain  that  drives  poor  QOL.  Furthermore,  the  most  severe  constant  pain 
experience  in  CP  is  also  a  complex  condition.  The  ability  to  target  the  etiopathogenesis  of 
severe  pain  requires  new  methods  to  detect  the  exact  pain  mechanisms  in  an  individual  at 
cellular, tissue, system and psychiatric levels. In patients with complex and severe disease, it 
is likely that multiple overlapping mechanisms are simultaneously driving pain, anxiety and 
depression.  Quantitative  sensory  testing  (QST)  shows  promise  in  detecting  alterations  in 
central  processing  of  pain  signals  and  to  classify  patients  for  mechanistic  and  therapeutic 
studies. New genetic research suggests that genetic loci for severe pain in CP overlap with 
genetic loci for depression and other psychiatric disorders, providing additional insights and 
therapeutic targets for individual patients with severe CP pain. Well-designed clinical trials 
that  integrate  clinical  features,  QST,  genetics  and  psychological  assessments  with  targeted 
treatment  and  assessment  of  responses  are  required  for  a  quantum  leap  forward.  A  better 
understanding  of  the  context  and  mechanisms  contributing  to  severe  pain  experiences  in 
individual patients is predicted to lead to better therapies and quality of life.

Introduction
Chronic  pancreatitis  (CP)  is  a  pathologic  fibro-inflammatory  syndrome  of  the 
pancreas  that  results in  persistent  pathologic responses to  parenchymal injury  or 
stress, manifesting as debilitating abdominal pain in up to 90% of patients.1,2  CP 
is  the  end-stage  of  a  pathogenic  process  that  typically  includes  episode(s)  of 
acute  pancreatitis  (AP)  or  recurrent  AP  (RAP).  The  clinical  features  of  the 
established  and  end  stages  of  CP  differ  among  patients  as  the  failure  or 
dysfunction  of  the  different  cell  types  involved  in  pancreatic  physiology  reveals 
different  amounts  of  resilience  or  susceptibility  to  recurrent  or  sustained  injury 
or  stress.  Thus,  the  appearance  of  the  pancreas  on  cross-sectional  abdominal 
imaging  measures  fibrosis,  atrophy,  cysts,  calcifications,  etc.  but  cannot  predict 
whether  or  not  the  patient  has  exocrine  pancreatic  insufficiency  (EPI),3  diabetes 
mellitus  (DM)4  or  pain.5

Pain  in  RAP  and  CP  significantly  and  negatively 
impacts  the  quality  of  life  (QOL)  and  results  in  progres-
sively  higher  rates  of  disability.6,7  Pain  in  CP  is  multi-
factorial  and  is  notoriously  challenging  to  treat.8–11 
Currently,  pain  management  in  RAP  and  CP  is  based  on 
questionnaire-based  measurements  of  pain  severity12  and 
analgesic  therapy  is  based  on  general  recommendations 
from  the  World  Health  Organization  on  the  treatment  of 
chronic pain.13 Treatment options in CP focus on symptom 
relief  with  most  CP  patients  being  prescribed  opioids  for 
the  treatment  of  their  pain.13  In  some  patients,  duct- 
obstructing  pancreatic  duct  stones  or  strictures  can  be 
treated with invasive treatments (endotherapy, extracorpor-
eal  shockwave  lithotripsy  [ESWL]  or  surgery)  to  relieve 
suspected  intraductal  hypertension,  although  these  inter-
ventions  are  effective  in  only  a  subset  of  patients.9,14–17 
Total  pancreatectomy  with  islet  cell  auto-transplantation 
(TPIAT)  has  been  offered  as  radical  treatment  and  the 
last  resort  to  patients  with  severe,  unmanageable  pain.18 
Unfortunately,  these  current  pain  management  strategies 
for CP are suboptimal. National and international scientific 
and  clinical  teams  are  working  to  develop  methods  for 
assessing  and  treating  pain—an  important  unmet  need  in 
CP.19–21

Pain  is  a  complex  experience  that  includes  both  sen-
sory  input  to  the  brain  and  the  interpretation  of  the  pain 
based  on  many  adaptive  and  psychological  factors.  The 
experience  of  pain  and  impact  on  QOL  can  be  markedly 
exacerbated  by  the  coexistence  of  psychiatric  diagnoses 
such  as  depression.22–24  Our  knowledge  of  predisposing 
genetic  risks  and  how  to  treat  mental  health  issues  in 
patients with CP are in their early stages, but understand-
ing  the  interaction  between  mental  health  and  pancreatic 
pain  may  be  very  important  for  optimal  patient  manage-
ment  in  the  future.  We  conducted  a  literature  search  in 
PubMed  for  relevant  English-language  articles  published 
before  December  1,  2020.  Search  terms  included  chronic 
pancreatitis and pain, and each of the followings: genetics, 
genetic  mutations,  genetic  polymorphisms,  risk  factors, 
mental  health,  anxiety,  depression,  mood  disorder,  neural 
networks  and  pain,  neural  networks  and  mood  disorders, 
anxiety  and  depression,  psychiatric  condition,  mood  dis-
order, 
and  gabapentinoids. 
Publications  on  chronic  pancreatitis  and  pain  were 
reviewed  in  depth,  and  additional  references  from  those 
publications  were  reviewed  for  relevant  content  and 
included. Case reports and case series were excluded. All 
other relevant articles  were reviewed by the  author group 

cannabinoids,  opioids, 

and those with the greatest relevance were considered for 
inclusion.

Clinical Characteristics of Pancreatic Pain
Pain  is  a  subjective  and  emotional  response  to  actual  or 
potential  tissue  damage;  therefore,  objective  methods  of 
pain  assessment  based  on  end-organ  pathology  alone  are 
impossible.25  Furthermore,  assessment  of  pancreatic  pain 
is challenging due to the multiple pathologies contributing 
to  the  overall  experience,  including  pancreatic  parenchy-
mal oxidative/metabolic stress, inflammation, neuritis/neu-
ropathy,  pancreatic  ductal  obstruction,  ischemia,  and 
in  peripheral  and  central  neural  pain 
alterations 
processing.8  In  addition,  there  are  emotional  aspects  of 
pain  that  are  likewise  complex.  Multiple  general  pain 
assessment  tools  have  been  used  to  assess  some  aspects 
the 
of  pain 
Comprehensive Pain Assessment Tool for CP (COMPAT) 
and Pancreatic Quality of Life Instrument (PANQOLI) and 
they show promise for future evaluation and classification 
of characteristics specific to CP.26,27  However, these tools 
cannot  decipher  or  specify  the  mechanisms  of  pain  and 
how  risk  factors  interact  with  these  mechanisms  or  how 
they affect the QOL.

Historically,  pain  in  CP  was  divided  into  two  specific 
patterns  (Types  A  and  B)  by  Ammann  et  al  in  their  1999 
study  of  alcoholic  CP,  which  was  widely  adopted  for  the 
clinical  classification  of  CP  pain.28  Type  A  pain was  char-
acterized by short-lived pain episodes lasting fewer than 10 
days, and separated by long pain-free intervals. Type B pain 
was characterized by prolonged periods of daily pain, punc-
tuated  by  clusters  of  recurrent,  severe  pain  exacerbations. 
Some  patients  experience  both  types  of  pain:  of  the  207 
patients in their series, all patients experienced at least one 
attack of Type A pain, but only 116 (56%) reported experi-
encing Type  B  pain.  B-type  pain  was  associated with  pan-
creatic pseudocysts (or walled-off necroses), cholestasis, and 
presumptive pancreatic ductal hypertension.28

A  2011  publication  by  Mullady  and  the  investigators 
of  the  North  American  Pancreatitis  Study  (NAPS2) 
group  evaluated  over  400  CP  patients  of  all  etiologies 
from 20 tertiary medical centers across the United States, 
and  asked  patients  to  self-identify  their  pattern  of  pain 
from  5  choices  based  on  temporal  nature  (intermittent 
versus  constant)  and  severity  (mild,  moderate,  severe) 
(Table  1).29  Patients  with  constant  pain  (as  compared  to 
intermittent)  had  higher  rates  of  disability,  hospitaliza-
tion,  pain  medication  use,  and  lower  quality  of  life  as

measured  by  the  Short  Form  12  (SF-12)  instrument. 
A  similar  pattern,  but  at  an  intermediate  level  is  seen 
with  patients  with  RAP.7  In  addition  to  the  features 
described  above,  patients  with  constant  pain  were  more 
likely  to  have  an  alcoholic  etiology  of  CP  than  their 
intermittent  pain.6,29  Interestingly, 
counterparts  with 
approximately  10%  of  patients  with  CP  have  no  pain 
for reasons that are not yet understood.30  The variability 
indicates  unidentified  intrinsic  factors,  such  as  genetic 
variants,  psychiatric  or  other  risk  factors  that  affect  the 
nature  and  severity  of  pain  signaling  since  the  imaging 
features  of  pancreatitis  do  not  correlate  with  CP  pain 
pattern  or  severity.5

Biology of Pancreatic Pain
The variability in pain experiences and responses to treat-
ment  indicates  that  multiple  mechanisms  are  involved  in 
the detection, transmission, interpretation and responses to 
pain  generation  between  individuals.  While  there  is  com-
plex circuitry of the integrated sensory system in humans, 
pancreatic  pain  begins  with  pancreas-derived  noxious 
stimuli.31  However,  central  processing  including  psycho-
the  pain 
logical  and  emotional  states  also  shapes 
experience.

A  brief  summary  of  local  mechanisms  of  pain  is 
addressed  here  (Table  2).  A  more  in-depth  discussion  of

the central and psychological aspects of pain  is discussed 
in detail below.

Injury and Pain in Acute Pancreatitis
Acute  pancreatitis  typically  triggers  pain  through  initial 
injury  signals  from  acinar  cells  that  are  followed  by  an 
inflammatory  response  that  subsequently  activates  pan-
creatic afferents. The pain of acute pancreatitis is typically 
severe,  characterized  as  sharp  or  stabbing  in  nature.  As 
inflammation evolves the patient also develops nausea and 
even vomiting. The pain of acute pancreatitis may also be 
connected  to  visceral  ischemia  in  more  severe  acute  pan-
creatitis with capillary leak, hypovolemia and multi-organ 
dysfunction.32 Marked improvement in AP pain may occur 
with adequate fluid resuscitation (personal observation).

Inflammatory Pain
Pain  of  ongoing  inflammation  is  generally  not  sharp  and 
stabbing  as  in  acute  injury,  but  rather  gnawing,  burning, 
nauseating or tender. If pain is being driven by oxidative or 
metabolic stress, then antioxidants are often useful in treat-
ing  pain.33–37  In  some  animal  and  human  studies,  the  pain 
of  pancreatic,  as  well  as  other  types  of  visceral  inflamma-
tion,  is  also  effectively  treated  with  cannabinoids.38–40 
Further research is needed to evaluate these types of therapy 
specifically for pancreatic pain.

Chronic  pancreatitis  is  a  complex  syndrome  in  which 
patients  have  variable  types  and  degrees  of  pathology,  such 
as  fibrosis,  duct  dilatation,  calcifications,  atrophy  or  inflam-
matory masses. The importance of inflammation in pain can 
be argued by the fact that pancreatic atrophy is often painless, 
inflammation  can  be  painful.

Inflammatory masses in the head of the pancreas are typically 
highly  painful  and  debilitating,  more  common  in  alcohol 
etiologies, and are resistant to most non-surgical management 
approaches.41–43

Obstruction/Pressure
Obstruction  of  the  pancreatic  duct  can  also  cause  pain. 
This  type  of  pain  may  be  more  colicky  or  steady  and  is 
often linked to signs of obstruction on abdominal imaging 
studies,  including  endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopan-
creatography (ERCP). This type of pain may be alleviated 
by  endoscopic  procedures,  such  as  ESWL  to  break  up 
intraductal  stones,  ERCP  to  clear  the  pancreatic  duct  and 
cross strictures with pancreatic duct stenting, or by surgi-
cal drainage procedures.9,44,45

Neuritis and Neuropathies
Another source of severe pain arising from the pancreas in 
painful  CP  is  neuritis–the  infiltration  of  the  nerves  by 
leukocytes.  This  process  may  also  be  accompanied  by 
nerve  hypertrophy  and  is  typically  seen  in  inflammatory 
treatments.46–51

Surgical  resection  may  be  required,  and  it  should  be

nervous system.8,52

The  major  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  pan-
creatitis-like  pain  is  distinguishing  between  RAP,  CP  and 
functional  abdominal  pain  (ie  irritable  bowel  syndrome). 
Recent reports suggest that specific criteria on CT imaging 
of the pancreas can be useful.53  The differential diagnosis 
of less common types of abdominal pain that mimic pan-
creatic  pain  is  given  elsewhere.54–56  A  rapid  change  in 
pain  pattern,  especially  with  new  weight  loss  or  develop-
ment of diabetes, may be a sign of pancreatic cancer,57,58 
especially since patients with CP are at high risk of devel-
oping pancreatic cancer.52,59,60

Central Sensitization/Central Pain
Patients  with  severe,  painful  CP  that  is  not  controlled 
within 2–3 years  often develop a syndrome called  central 
sensitization  or  central  pain.8–10  In  its  early  stages  before 
spreading  to  the  central  nervous  system,  neurologic 
changes  may  be  confined  to  the  spinal  cord  and  peripan-
creatic  nerves  of  the  pancreatic  viscerotome,  resulting  in 
a condition termed segmental sensitization.61

There  are  multiple  localized  and  integrated  brain  net-
works involved in the perception of physical and psycho-
logical pain. Activation of nociceptors is an alarm signal to 

the brain. Under chronic pain conditions, a constant alarm 
drives  functional  reorganization  of  the  brain.  As  a  result, 
patients with chronic pain can exhibit a range of cognitive 
and  neurological  deficits.  Indeed,  different  chronic  pain 
conditions  are  associated  with  distinct  patterns  of  brain 
(reviewed 
activity 
elsewhere).62–64

and  morphological 

alterations 

Overlap of Pain and Emotion Areas of the 
Brain
Chronic  pain  also  drives  changes  in  psychological  pro-
cesses  including  perception,  attention,  mood,  motivation, 
learning  and  memory.65  Changes  in  corticolimbic  net-
works,  which  are  involved  in  these  psychological  pro-
cesses  are  direct  predictors  of  chronic  pain.66,67  With  the 
transition from acute to chronic pain, the brain representa-
tion  shifts  toward  emotional  circuits.68  There  is  also 
a  decrease  in  functional  connectivity  between  the  medial 
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.69 Patients with chronic 
low back pain or pain from irritable bowel syndrome also 
exhibit reduced gray matter volume in the striatum, parti-
cularly  the  nucleus  accumbens.66,70  Chronic  pain  patients 
with  reduced  striatal  function  exhibit  a  dampening  of 
incentive-related  behaviors,  a  common  feature  of  those 
with major depression.71  Patients with painful cranioman-
dibular  disorder  show  increased  activation  of  the  insula 
and  concomitant  increases  in  anxiety,  both  of  which  are 
reversed  with  successful  therapy.72  Similar  changes  may 
accompany pain from CP.

Effects of Emotions on Pain Perception
While chronic pain can drive changes in brain activity that 
influence  mood,  so  too  can  cognitive  or  emotional  state 
also directly modulate pain. For instance, subjects expect-
ing  analgesia  failure  report  no  relief  from  a  clinically 
efficacious  dose  of  opioids.73  Following  induction  of 
a sad state, subjects report significantly higher pain ratings 
as  compared  to  a  neutral  mood  state.74  In  patients  with 
major depression, thermal pain thresholds are significantly 
increased  and 
they  exhibit  altered  brain  activity 
patterns.75,76  Like  chronic  pain  patients,  people  with 
major depressive or  anxiety disorder  exhibit  altered  func-
tional  connectivity  (see  reviews).77–79  For  example,  in 
anticipation  of  a  painful  stimulus,  patients  exhibit 
increased  activity  in  the  amygdala  and  decreased  activity 
in  the  anterior  cingulate  and  prefrontal  cortices.80  This 
suggests  that  patients  with  major  depressive  disorder

Dunbar et al

have increased emotional reactivity during anticipation of 
pain that may impair their ability to modulate pain experi-
ence. Pain, anxiety, or depression can lead to alterations in 
signaling  in  overlapping  brain  regions,  including  hippo-
campus, amygdala, striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and 
medial  prefrontal  cortex.  Since  the  same  circuits  are  uti-
lized  for  pain  and  psychological  processing  it  is  not  sur-
prising that there is significant comorbidity in these patient 
populations.

Variation in Physical Pain 
Perception and Processing Among 
Patients with CP
Clinicians  recognize  that  pain  patterns  do  not  always  fol-
low the pathologic appearance of the pancreas on imaging 
studies.5  Some  patients  appear  to  be  hypersensitive  to 
various  types  of  pain,  while  others  either  feel  less  pain 
with the same injury or are less likely to externalize their 
pain.  The  variable  clinical  features  of  pain  (Table  1)  and 
the  multiple  mechanisms  of  pain  (Table  2)  must  be  con-
nected  to  decipher  the  pain  drivers  and  potentiators  in 
individual  patients.  New  clinical  tools  are  needed  to  sort 
out  the  components  of  the  pain  syndrome  in  individual 
patients  so  that  the  best  treatment  can  be  given  to  each 
person.  An  algorithm for  the  treatment  of  painful  chronic 
pancreatitis was previously developed through a consensus 
agreement  of  the  major  pancreatic  research  societies.9 
Figure 1 is a modification of this guidance on CP treatment 
using currently available therapies.

Quantitative Sensory Testing
While  pain  is  a  subjective  experience,  nociception  is 
defined  by  the  International  Association  for  the  Study  of 
Pain as the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli.83 
Thus,  unlike  pain,  nociception  is  amenable  to  evaluation 
by  systematic  testing.  Quantitative  sensory  testing (QST) 
is a method used to measure nociception by administering 
a  series  of  external  stimuli  of  controlled  intensity. 
A  collaboration  of  researchers  has  developed  and  tested 
a  pancreas-specific  quantitative  sensory  testing  protocol 
(P-QST)  that  can  separate  patients  into  three  phenotypes 
suggestive  of  normal  nociception,  altered  nociception  at 
the  level  of  the  pancreatic  viscerotome,  and  widespread 
central 
hyperalgesia 
sensitization.13  Although  this  method  does  not  test  pain 
per  se,  it  can  assess  alterations  in  neural  signaling.

lower  QOL,  and  lower  physical  functioning.61  Of  note, 
these  associations  were  seen  as  independent  of  any  psy-
chiatric comorbidities.

CP as a Complex Gene-Environment- 
Metabolic Disease
Understanding CP requires the transition from a traditional 
monolithic  view  of  disease  (eg  WHO  pain  step-up  model 
of pain management) to a more holistic view81 where each 
case  is  an  independent  combination  of  multiple  risk 
factors82 
to  cause 
disease.83–85  While  the  science  of  the  new  approach  is 
beyond the scope of this review, the importance of genet-
ics  cannot  be  underestimated.  Indeed,  the  role  of  genetic 
variants in drug-metabolizing genes (pharmacogenetics) is 
well  established  and  is  highly  relevant  for  variable 
responses  and  even  toxic  outcomes  in  the  treatment  of 
pain and depression.86–91

in  a  pathogenic  way 

that  act 

Genetic  variant  evaluation  is  a  powerful  tool  since  it 
can  direct the  analyst  to  specific  mechanisms  in  the  body 
that  are  likely  to  be  dysfunctional  under  injury  or  stress, 
and  other  systems  that  are  likely  to  be  normal.92  These 
tools  are  therefore  most  useful  early  in  the  course  of 
disease before the  damage of  poorly managed  pathogenic 
pathways  becomes  irreversible.93  The  primary  utility  of 
genetic  testing  is  to  identify  risk  factors  contributing  to 
pancreatitis  etiology  and  the  mechanism  of  disease. 
A secondary analysis is indicated as pharmacologic thera-
pies  are  being  considered  for  pain  management  including 
genetic  loci  and  variants  associated  with  psychiatric  dis-
orders  as  well  as  pharmacogenetics  to  select  medications 
that are most likely to be effective at standard or modified 
doses (Figure 1, orange box)

Future expert physicians and health care workers must 
adopt  a  more  sophisticated  analysis  of  patients  where 
multiple  risk  factors  (ie  factors  that  are  neither  necessary 
nor sufficient to cause disease alone but are more common 
in  patients  with  disease  than  controls)  combine  in  ways 
that can be modeled to determine their combined effect on 
cell  disorders  and  disease  development.83  Thus,  classic 
genetic  testing  reports  are  inadequate.  Integration  of  all 
known factors must be considered within appropriate con-
texts  so  that  strong  clinical  decision  support  reports  are 
available  to  provide  guidance.92  The  information  below 
these  complex 
insights 
may  provide  critical

Pancreatic Pain and Mental Health
Depression,  anxiety and  physical  pain  often  occur  conco-
mitantly,  and  their  co-occurrence  can  have  an  exponen-
tially  detrimental  effect.22,94–97  Approximately  85%  of 
patients  suffering  from  chronic  pain  also  suffer  from 
depression,  and  between  30%  and  60%  of  chronic  pain 
sufferers  also  experience  anxiety.22,96,98  The  combination 
of  pain with  depression  and/or  anxiety is  very  difficult to 
treat, and increases suicide risk as compared to individuals 
without pain.22

Pain  in  CP  significantly  and  negatively  impacts  the 
quality  of  life  and results in  higher  rates of  disability.6  In 
a  recent  cohort  study  of  171  patients  with  CP  by  Phillips 
et  al,  anxiety  and  depression  (as  defined  by  Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale scores of  >7) were present 
in 46.8% and 38.6% of patients, respectively.99  Overlap of 
anxiety  and  depression  was  seen  in  29%  of  patients. 
Patients  who  had  anxiety  or  depression  reported  higher 
prevalence  rates  of  pain,  pain  severity,  and  interference 
of  pain  with  their  daily  activities  compared  to  their  non- 
anxious, non-depressed counterparts. Patients with depres-
sion  were  more  likely  to  be  taking  opioids.  The  presence 
of  anxiety  or  depression  was  also  associated  with  lower 
QOL  as  measured  by  the  European  Organization  for  the 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire global 
health  score  and  subscores.  The  presence  of  pain  (inter-
mittent  or  constant)  was  independently  associated  with 
decreased global health, and an association between global 
health status and depression was confirmed independently 
of pain.99
In 

the  previously  mentioned  North  American 
Pancreatitis  Study  (NAPS2)  of  414  patients  with  CP, 
patients  with  constant  pain  exhibited  lower  physical  and 
mental health scores than their counterparts with intermit-
tent  pain  (Table  1,  BDE,  constant  vs  AC,  intermittent).29 
Additionally,  non-alcoholic  chronic  pancreatitis  patients 
with  depression  often  report  experiencing  higher  levels 
of pain and lower quality of life.100

The presence of a psychiatric comorbidity or substance 
use disorder in any patient may increase the risk of the patient 
developing the other.101–103 Although a unidirectional causal 
association  has  not  been  established  there  exists  a  strong 
association  between  addiction  to  alcohol,  anxiety,  post- 
traumatic  stress, and  depression.101–106  This  connection, as 

well as that between smoking, anxiety and depression, are of 
unique importance in painful CP. Alcohol and tobacco nega-
tively impact RAP and CP as well as promote progression of 
the  former  to  the  latter.107  Active  smoking  status  in  CP 
patients has been seen to associate with lower physical and 
frequent  use  of 
life  and  more 
mental  quality  of 
antidepressants.6,108,109

Mental Health in CP Patients and Links to 
the Genetics of Pain
The  mental  aversion  of  pain  is  encoded  in  brain  regions 
that  also  process  reward  and  motivation.  Evidence  from 
preclinical animal studies suggests that the neuroplasticity 
in corticolimbic circuits underlies the anxiety and depres-
sion  symptoms  that  are  often  associated  with  chronic 
pain.110  In  pain  patients,  striatal  hypofunction  correlates 
with mood alterations.71  With the overlap in both prefron-
tal  cortex  and  limbic  pathways,  it  is  not  surprising  that 
functional  alterations  driven  by  either  pain  or  mood  dis-
orders  affect  the  manifestation of  the  other.  However,  the 
fact that  there are  marked  effects  in  some people  and not 
others is not defined by brain activity alone. New evidence 
is  emerging  that  genetic  risk  for  depression  and  anxiety 
plays a major role in the psychiatric phenotypes, and that 
co-existence  of  genetic  risk  for  depression  and  anxiety  in 
patients  with  RAP  and  CP  results  in  a  more  severe  pain 
experience.

To  date,  and  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  only  one 
study  has  been  published  examining  the  overlap  of  psy-
chiatric  risk  genes  and  pancreatitis  pain.96  This  study 
identified  15  loci  significantly  associated  with  constant 
severe pain in pancreatitis that were also previously asso-
ciated  with  depression.96  Loci  represent  regions  of  DNA 
that  have  multiple  SNPs  and  genes  that  tend  to  be  trans-
mitted over multiple generations together. So, it is usually 
not  possible  to  pinpoint  the  actual  risk  factor(s)  within 
a  locus  without  extensive  genomic  tests  –  but  the  true 
risk  factor  and  the  SNP  under  evaluation  are  statistically 
and  physically  linked.  Several  of  these  CP  pain  loci  are 
also associated with response to antidepressants as well.96 
Identifying  associations  with  pain  in  pancreatitis  within 
psychiatric  risk  genes  shows  that  the  pain  in  pancreatitis 
is not only phenotypically associated with psychiatric dis-
orders but also genotypically associated.96 These are excit-
ing findings, but require replication and clinical studies to 
verify  that  the  candidate  risk  loci  do  not  represent 
a  statistical  aberration  (false  discovery),  and  so  that  the

Examples of Depression Risk Genes 
in Patients with CP and a Constant 
Severe Pain Phenotype
We recently identified five candidate genes with variants in 
the coding or regulatory regions of the patient’s DNA loci 
that  were  associated  with  the  constant  severe  pain 
phenotype.96  The  location  and  function  of  these  genes 
are briefly described.

The  ROBO2  (roundabout  guidance  receptor  2)  gene 
located  at  3p12.3  codes  for  the  roundabout  homolog  2 
protein.  ROBO2  is  an  immunoglobulin  transmembrane 
receptor  for  slit  homolog  2  and  is  most  well  known  for 
mediating cell migration and axon guidance during devel-
opment.  However,  ROBO2  plays  an  important  part  in 
maintaining  inhibitory  synapses  in  the  adult  ventral  teg-
mental area, which is a source of dopamine production.111 
Dysregulation of dopamine can have a profound effect on 
both pain and comorbid mood disorders.112

The  CTNND2  (catenin  delta  2,  5p15.2)  gene  encodes 
a protein in  the  armadillo/beta-catenin superfamily  that is 
an adhesive junction-associated protein. The catenin delta 
2  protein  interferes  with  E-cadherin-based  junctions  and 
promotes cell spreading. During development, CTNND2 is 
highly expressed in the fetal brain in humans and is asso-
ciated  with 
and 
functioning.113  However,  the  Rat  Genome  Consortium 
was the  first group  to  demonstrate  that CTNND2  is  asso-
ciated  with  hippocampal  volume  and  dysfunctional 
synapses in adult mice. Nivard et al replicated this finding 
in humans, showing an association between CTNND2 and 
anxiety and depression.113

adhesion,  migration, 

neuronal 

The protein zeta-sarcoglycan coded by the SGCZ (8p22) 
is  part  of  the  sarcoglycan  complex.  SGCZ  is  primarily 
expressed in the ovaries and brain.114 Bipolar disorder, schi-
zophrenia, and major depressive disorder have all been asso-
ciated  with  genes  on  chromosome  8  including  SGCZ.115 
Additionally,  SGCZ 
is  associated  with  antidepressant 
response and paliperidone efficacy in schizophrenia.116,117

Contactin 5  (CNTN5, 11q22.1) belongs to the  immuno-
globulin  superfamily  and  contactin  family  that  is  involved 
with nervous system development. Contactin 5 is expressed 
mainly  in  the  placenta,  thyroid,  and  brain.114  CNTN5,  an 
immunoglobulin cell adhesion protein, plays a role in axon 
connection  in  cortical  neurons  and  neurite  outgrowth.118 

There is evidence that autism spectrum disorder phenotypes 
may result from increased activity of glutamatergic neurons 
that only have a single copy of CNTN5.119 The role in altered 
pain  perception  is  not  yet  clear,  but  glutamate  is  a  key 
neurotransmitter in sensory, spinal and cortical neurons.

The  BAIAP2  (BAR/IMD  domain-containing  adaptor 
protein  2,  17q25.3)  gene  codes  the  brain-specific  angio-
genesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2, which is involved 
with  G-protein  coupling.  The  protein  is  involved  in  the 
regulation  of  neuronal  membrane  actin  dynamics  at  exci-
tatory synapses. In mice, deleting the gene homologous to 
BAIAP2  increases  the  activity  of  NMDA  receptors  and 
results  in  abnormal  behaviors.120  These  behaviors  are 
reversed  in  mice  treated  with  memantine,  an  uncompeti-
tive antagonist of NMDA receptors. BAIAP2 is also impli-
cated  in  psychiatric  disorders,  such  as  ADHD,  autism 
spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia in humans.

tools  are  needed 

Conclusions
Severe  pain  in  patients  with  CP  can  be  identified  and 
quantified,  but  tools  to  understand  the  underlying  and 
variable  mechanisms  contributing  to  the  severe  pain 
experience  in  these  patients  are  lacking.  Thus,  the  most 
effective  approach  remains  surgically  removing  some  or 
all  of  the  pancreas.  In  patients  with  complex  and  severe 
disease, it is likely that multiple overlapping mechanisms 
are  simultaneously  driving  pain,  anxiety  and  depression. 
New 
identify  key  pathogenic 
to 
mechanisms,  such  as  better  questionnaires,  QST  and 
genetic  testing  –  beginning  with  pharmacogenetics. 
New  investigations  of  the  overlap  of  pain,  depression 
and  anxiety  demonstrate  that  multiple  genetic  risk  loci 
for  depression  and  anxiety  are  associated  with  constant 
severe  pain  experience  and  that  the  effects  are  manifest 
in  the  brain.  Well-designed  clinical  trials  that  integrate 
clinical features, QST, genetics and psychological assess-
treatment  and  assessment  of 
ments  with 
responses  are  required  for  a  quantum  leap  forward.
