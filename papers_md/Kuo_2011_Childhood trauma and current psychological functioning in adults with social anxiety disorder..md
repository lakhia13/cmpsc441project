Abstract

Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that early childhood trauma
contributes to the development of this disorder. However, surprisingly little is known about the
link between different forms of childhood trauma and adult clinical symptoms in SAD. This study
(1) compared levels of childhood trauma in adults with generalized SAD versus healthy controls
(HCs), and (2) examined the relationship between specific types of childhood trauma and adult
clinical symptoms in SAD. Participants were 102 individuals with generalized SAD and 30 HCs
who completed measures of childhood trauma, social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-
esteem. Compared to HCs, individuals with SAD reported greater childhood emotional abuse and
emotional neglect. Within the SAD group, childhood emotional abuse and neglect, but not sexual
abuse, physical abuse, or physical neglect, were associated with the severity of social anxiety, trait
anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

1. Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common (12.1% lifetime prevalence) (Kessler et al.,
2005) and often debilitating disorder (Lochner et al., 2003; Schneier et al., 1994) that is
characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations in which an individual is
at risk for embarrassment, humiliation, or possible scrutiny by unfamiliar persons (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000). SAD affects more than 15 million American adults during
any 12-month period (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005).

These statistics are particularly compelling in light of evidence suggesting that SAD is
associated with significant distress and functional impairment in both work and social
domains (Lochner et al., 2003; Rapee, 1995; Schneier et al., 1994; Sherbourne et al., 2010).
SAD may be a risk factor for other clinical disorders with which it commonly co-occurs,

including major depression, substance abuse, and other anxiety disorders (Chou, 2009;
Lampe, Slade, Issakidis, & Andrews, 2003; Matza, Revicki, Davidson, & Stewart, 2003;
Ohayon & Schatzberg, 2010; Randall, Thomas, & Thevos, 2001). In addition, the number of
feared social situations reported by individuals with SAD is associated with comorbid major
depression, other anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation (Gabalawy, Cox, Clara, &
Mackenzie, 2010).

Contemporary models of SAD suggest that the development of SAD is a result of a
biological vulnerability coupled with negative social learning experiences (Clark & Wells,
1995; Heimberg, Brozovich, & Rapee, 2010; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). Findings from
family studies demonstrate a strong association between social anxiety in parent and
offspring (Bögels, Oosten, Muris, & Smulders, 2001; Lieb et al., 2000), and temperament
studies suggest a link between inhibited temperament in childhood and the development of
social anxiety in adolescence (Biederman et al., 2001; Schwartz, Snidman, & Kagan, 1999).
The impact of social learning experiences has been suggested as a key environmental factor
contributing to the development of the disorder (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997) and has received
substantial empirical attention. Prospective studies have found that parental overprotection,
rejection, and lack of warmth are associated with offspring SAD (Knappe, Beesdo, Fehm,
Hofler, et al., 2009; Knappe, Beesdo, Fehm, Lieb, & Wittchen, 2009; Lieb et al., 2000).

One specific social learning factor that has garnered recent attention is childhood trauma.
Although extant data indicate that childhood trauma experiences may contribute to the
development of SAD (Bruch & Heimberg, 1994; Arrindell, Emmelkamp, Monsma, &
Brilman, 1983; Arrindell et al., 1989), how childhood trauma impacts adult clinical
functioning in SAD remains unknown. The purpose of the current study was to address this
gap by comparing histories of childhood trauma between individuals with SAD and non-
clinical controls and examining associations between specific types of childhood trauma and
adult clinical symptoms in SAD.

1.1. The Role of Early Childhood Trauma in the Development of SAD

Studies investigating childhood trauma in SAD suggest that parental emotional abuse
towards the child (e.g., swearing, insulting, denigrating, and non-physical aggressing) and
emotional neglect (e.g., emotional deprivation or the absence of feeling special, loved, or
being part of a nurturing environment) may be important factors in the development of SAD.
For example, in a non-clinical sample, compared to women with low levels of social
anxiety, women high in social anxiety reported significantly more paternal rejection,
paternal and maternal neglect, and paternal authority-discipline (Klonsky, Dutton, & Liebel,
1990). In another study, Lieb and colleagues (2000) found that parental rejection was
associated with social anxiety in a community sample of adolescents.

Studies of adults with SAD also indicate that these individuals report childhood experiences
associated with emotional abuse and/or neglect. Individuals with SAD are more likely than
controls to perceive their parents as having used shame as a form of discipline (Bruch &
Heimberg, 1994). Two separate studies (Arrindell, et al., 1983; Arrindell et al., 1989) found
that, compared to non-anxious healthy controls, patients with SAD characterized their
parents as rejecting and lacking in emotional warmth , although these findings should be
interpreted with caution because of small sample sizes. Simon and colleagues (2009)
recently reported that 56% of individuals with SAD endorsed a history of childhood
emotional abuse, and 39% of individuals with SAD endorsed a history of childhood
emotional neglect. However, this study did not include a healthy control group, so it remains
unclear whether these rates differ from those in non-clinical samples.

In addition to emotional abuse and neglect, studies have investigated both (a) rates of SAD
in adults with a history of childhood sexual abuse and (b) rates of childhood sexual abuse in
adults with SAD. Using the former method, Pribor and Dinwiddie (1992) reported higher
rates of SAD in adults with a history of sexual abuse than an age- and race-matched control
group (SAD: 46.2% vs. Healthy Controls: 2.8%). Employing the latter method, adults with
SAD endorsed higher rates of childhood sexual abuse (SAD: 10.0% vs. Healthy Controls:
5.0%) (Bandelow et al., 2004). However, when familial anxiety was controlled, childhood
sexual abuse only predicted a diagnosis of SAD at a trend level. These findings suggest that
childhood sexual abuse may not play a unique role in the development of SAD.

1.2. The Psychological Correlates of Early Childhood Trauma

Given that individuals with SAD appear to differ from healthy controls in their exposure to
early childhood trauma, one important question is whether these early adverse experiences
are correlated with one or more aspects of negative psychological functioning in SAD. In
non-clinical samples, studies demonstrate associations between a history of childhood
trauma and a number of negative adult experiences including elevated levels of depression,
anxiety, substance use, suicidal behaviors, and emotional-behavioral problems (Briere &
Elliott, 1994; Briere & Runtz, 1988; Silverman, Reinherz, & Giaconia, 1996).

More recent studies have evaluated whether distinct forms of childhood trauma are related to
specific psychological problems in adulthood. In a sample of young women, physical abuse
was related to heightened aggression towards others and sexual abuse was related to
maladaptive sexual behavior (e.g., getting into trouble because of sexual behavior,
controlling others through the use of sex) (Briere & Runtz, 1990). By contrast, emotional
abuse was related to low self-esteem. In a separate study, women who reported a history of
emotional neglect reported greater problems in multiple domains (adult attachment styles,
anxiety, depression, somatization, paranoia) than those reporting a history of physical abuse
(Gauthier, Stollak, Messe, & Aronoff, 1996). Briere and Runtz (1998) found that maternal
physical abuse was associated with interpersonal sensitivity and dissociation, whereas
paternal emotional abuse was associated with anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity,
and dissociation. Gibb and colleagues found that childhood emotional abuse was more
strongly related to diagnoses of depression or social anxiety disorder than either physical or
sexual abuse (e.g., Gibb, Chelminiski, & Zimmerman, 2007).

Despite mounting evidence for the associations between different forms of abuse and
various adverse adult clinical symptoms, very few studies have extended this line of inquiry
to SAD. Simon and colleagues (2009) recently examined the relationship between various
types of childhood trauma and the severity of social anxiety, global severity of symptoms,
disability, resilience, and quality of life in a sample of adults with SAD. A history of
childhood emotional abuse or neglect was associated with greater severity of SAD and
global symptoms; emotional neglect was also associated with lesser resilience. Childhood
sexual abuse was associated with greater disability, whereas childhood physical abuse and
neglect were not associated with any of these psychological outcomes.

These findings indicate some specificity in the relationship between childhood trauma
subtypes and general functional impairment in SAD. However, whether subtypes of
childhood trauma might be differentially associated with specific clinical symptoms that
have been implicated in the non-clinical literature (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-esteem)
remains unknown. Given the evidence that SAD individuals with a history of childhood
trauma have poorer treatment outcomes (Alden, Taylor, Laposa, & Mellings, 2006), such
knowledge would be useful in developing treatment interventions for this group who does
not maximally benefit from current treatments.

1.3. The Present Study

Page 4

The present study was designed to address two goals. The first goal was to compare
differences in the frequency (how often an event occurred) and rates (what percent of the
time an event occurred) of different forms of childhood trauma (sexual abuse, physical
abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect) in a large sample of
individuals with generalized SAD versus a comparison group of healthy control participants
(HCs). This addresses limitations in the current literature which include small clinical
samples (Arrindell, et al. 1983; 1989) and the lack of an HC group (Simon et al., 2009). The
second goal was to build upon recent findings linking subtypes of childhood trauma and
functional impairment in individuals with SAD (Simon et al., 2009) by examining
associations between different forms of childhood trauma and specific adult clinical
symptoms (anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) in SAD.

We hypothesized that, compared to HCs, individuals with SAD would have greater
frequency and rates of childhood emotional abuse, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, physical
abuse, and physical neglect. In line with previous findings (Simon et al., 2009), we expected
that a greater frequency of childhood emotional abuse and neglect in the SAD sample would
be associated with greater severity of current social anxiety. Drawing upon findings in non-
clinical samples, we also predicted that greater frequency of childhood emotional abuse and
neglect, but not sexual abuse, physical abuse, or physical neglect would be associated with
greater anxiety, depression, and lower self-esteem within the SAD group.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Participants were part of two larger brain imaging studies evaluating the mechanisms
underlying cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based treatments for SAD. Participants
included 102 (53 females) individuals who met DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000) criteria for a primary diagnosis of generalized SAD and 30 healthy
controls (15 females) with no lifetime history of any DSM-IV psychiatric disorders that are
assessed as part of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Lifetime version
(ADIS-IV-L; DiNardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994). Because they were originally selected to
participate in the brain imaging study, potential participants were excluded based on the
criteria for that study: current use of any psychotropic medication or any history of
neurological or cardiovascular disorders. SAD individuals were also excluded if they met
criteria for any current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorder assessed by the ADIS-IV-L
other than generalized anxiety disorder (n = 24, 23.5%), agoraphobia (n = 1, 1.0%), or
specific phobia (n = 10, 9.8%). All participants provided informed consent in accordance
with Stanford University's Human Subjects Committee guidelines.

2.2. Measures

Eligible participants were administered the short form of the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; Bernstein et al., 2003), a 28-item questionnaire (25 clinical items
and three validity items) which assesses five specific forms of childhood trauma: sexual
abuse (e.g., “Someone tried to touch me in a sexual way, or tried to make me touch them”),
physical abuse (e.g., “I was punished with a belt, a board, a cord, or some other hard object),
physical neglect (e.g., “I had to wear dirty clothes”), emotional abuse (e.g., “People in my
family called me things like ‘stupid’, ‘lazy’, or ‘ugly’), and emotional neglect (“I felt
loved”- reverse coded). Respondents are asked to choose responses on a 5-point Likert-type
scale that ranges from never true to very often true. The subscales of the CTQ have
moderate to high internal consistency (alphas = .61-.92) in a community sample (Bernstein,
et al., 2003). In the current sample, the CTQ had moderate to high internal consistency

Kuo et al.

Page 5

(alpha = .49 for HC, alpha = .86 for SAD), as did the subscales (alpha = .27-.90 for HC,
alpha = .43-.92 for SAD).

Participants also completed questionnaires assessing clinical symptoms in several domains.
Severity of social anxiety was measured using the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS;
Mattick & Clarke, 1998), a 20-item self-report measure assessing anxiety related to social
interactions in dyads and groups. The SIAS has demonstrated high levels of internal
consistency (alphas = .88-.90 for undergraduate and community samples, alpha = .93 for
SAD individuals) and test-retest reliability (r = .91 for undergraduate sample, r = .92 for
SAD individuals) (Carter & Wu, 2010; Mattick & Clarke, 1998). Anxiety was measured
using the Trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T; Speilberger, Gorsuch,
& Lushene, 1970), a well-established measure of trait anxiety with high test-retest reliability
(ranging from r = .73 - .86) (Speilberger et al., 1970). Internal consistency for the STAI-T in
this sample was high (alpha = .81 in HC, alpha = .93 in SAD). Depressive symptoms were
measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), a
21-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms measured during the past week. The
BDI has good internal consistency (alpha = .90 in a college sample; Storch, Roberti, & Roth,
2004); alpha = .89 in a sample of individuals with SAD; Coles, Gibb, & Heimberg, 2001)
and concurrent validity (r = .69 with the State-Anxiety Inventory depression factor), and
good test-retest reliability (ICC = .91) in a sample of individuals with SAD (Coles et al.,
2001). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES;
Rosenberg, 1989), a 10-item self-report measure assessing beliefs and attitudes regarding
general self-worth. The RSES has been shown to have satisfactory convergent validity (rs
= .56-83) and good test-retest reliability (r = .85; Silbert & Tippett, 1965). Internal
consistency in this sample was high (alpha = .81 in HC, alpha = .89 in SAD).

Examination of assumptions of multivariate analysis of variance indicated violations of
homogeneity and normality for total CTQ scores as well as CTQ trauma subtype (sexual
abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, emotional neglect) scores.
Therefore, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to examine between-group
differences in the endorsed frequency of total childhood trauma and each trauma subtype.
To examine between-group differences in the rates of childhood trauma, we applied
previously validated cutoffs for each CTQ subscale to determine the presence of each type
of childhood trauma (Walker et al., 1999): sexual abuse ≥ 8, physical abuse ≥ 8, physical
neglect ≥ 8, emotional abuse ≥ 10, emotional neglect ≥ 15. The Mann-Whitney test was
then used to examine between-group differences in the rates of childhood trauma and each
trauma subtype.

To examine relations between the frequency of each childhood trauma subtype and current
clinical symptoms (social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) within the SAD
group, Spearman's rho was used. Given previous reports of significant associations between
childhood emotional neglect and depression (e.g., Gibb et al., 2007), we also examined the
associations between childhood emotional abuse and neglect with social anxiety, trait
anxiety, and self-esteem while controlling for current levels of depression using partial

correlations. Bonferroni adjustments were not employed as the purpose of these analyses
was not to examine the universal null hypothesis (Perneger, 1998).

3. Results

3.1. Preliminary Analyses

Preliminary analyses were conducted to assess (1) whether there were demographic
differences between SAD and HC groups, (2) the associations among childhood trauma
variables, (3) the associations among demographic variables and childhood trauma
variables, (4) the associations among clinical symptom variables, and (5) between-group
differences in the clinical symptom variables.

3.1.1. Demographic variables—There was no significant between-group difference in
age (SAD: M = 33.47, SD = 8.59, HC: M = 32.60, SD = 9.00, t(130) = 0.48, p = .63) or in
number of years of education (SAD: M = 16.69, SD = 2.22, HC: M = 17.48, SD = 2.03,
t(122) = 1.72, p = .09), although education data were missing for eight participants (7 SAD,
1 HC). Gender did not differ significantly across the groups, χ2(1, N = 132) = 0.04, p = .85.

3.1.2. Relationships among types of childhood trauma—See Table 1. Within the
SAD group, all five childhood trauma subscales (sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical
neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect) were significantly positively associated
with each other, with the exception of the correlations between sexual abuse and either
emotional abuse or neglect. Only emotional abuse and emotional neglect were significantly
positively associated in the HC group.

3.1.3. Relations among demographic variables and types of childhood trauma
—Age was significantly positively associated with childhood sexual abuse in the HC group
and was significantly positively associated with childhood emotional abuse and emotional
neglect in the SAD group (see Table 1). Mann-Whitney tests indicated that males had
greater histories of childhood physical abuse than females in the SAD group only (U =
913.00, p < .01). All other comparisons were non-significant (SAD: sexual abuse, U =
1237.50, p =.59; physical neglect, U = 1153.50, p = .90; emotional abuse, U = 1158.50, p = .
35; emotional neglect, U = 1090.00, p = .56; HC: sexual abuse, U = 105.50, p =.78; physical
abuse, U = 106.00, p = .81; physical neglect, U = 92.50, p = .51; emotional abuse, U =
96.50, p = .51; emotional neglect, U = 92.50, p = .41).

3.1.4. Relations among clinical variables—See Table 2. Associations between
clinical variables (social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) were moderate
for both groups.

3.1.5. Differences in social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-esteem
between patients with SAD and HCs—Independent-sample t-tests demonstrated
significant between-group differences in social anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and self-
esteem (see Table 3).

3.2. Differences in Childhood Trauma between Patients with SAD and HCs

Mann-Whitney tests demonstrated that, compared to HCs, individuals with SAD reported
greater frequency of emotional abuse (U = 816.00, p < .001), emotional neglect (U = 708.00,
p < .001), and total childhood trauma (U = 835.00, p < .001) (see Figure 1). There was a
trend toward greater childhood sexual abuse in the SAD group (U = 1289.00, p = .07). There
were no significant between-group differences in childhood physical abuse (U = 1276.00, p
= .14) or neglect (U = 1258.50, p = .25).

See Table 4 for rates of each trauma subtype for both groups. Consistent with the above
analyses examining differences in endorsed per-person frequencies of childhood trauma,
Mann-Whitney tests demonstrated that, compared with HCs, individuals with SAD had
greater rates of childhood emotional abuse (U = 954.00, p < .001) and childhood emotional
neglect (U = 1077.00, p < .01). There were no significant between-group differences in rates
of childhood sexual abuse (U = 1362.00, p = .14), childhood physical abuse (U = 1320.00, p
= .14), or childhood physical neglect (U = 1446.00, p < .32).

3.3. Relationships Between Types of Childhood Trauma and Adult Clinical Symptoms in
SAD

As shown in Table 5, within the SAD sample, child emotional abuse and neglect were
positively correlated with current social anxiety and trait anxiety, and negatively correlated
with self-esteem. Childhood emotional neglect was also significantly positively correlated
with depression. Childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect were not
correlated with any of these variables. Because of significant associations between age and
childhood emotional abuse/neglect found in our preliminary analyses, we examined whether
these significant relations remained when controlling for age. Results did not change
(emotional abuse-social anxiety, r = .26, p < .05, emotional abuse-trait anxiety, r = .28, p < .
01, emotional abuse-self-esteem, r = −.35, p < .001, emotional neglect-social anxiety, r = .
25, p < .05, emotional neglect-trait anxiety, r = .40, p < .001, emotional neglect-depression,
r = .31, p < .01, emotional neglect-self-esteem, r = −.44, p < .001). We further evaluated
whether the observed pattern of results might be an artifact of depressive affect by
conducting partial correlations between childhood abuse and neglect with social anxiety,
trait anxiety, and self-esteem, controlling for levels of depression. Results did not change
(emotional abuse-social anxiety, r = .23, p < .05, emotional abuse-trait anxiety, r = .24, p < .
05, emotional abuse-self-esteem, r = −.31, p < .01, emotional neglect-trait anxiety, r = .28, p
< .01, emotional neglect-self-esteem, r = −.35, p < .01), with the exception of the relation
between childhood emotional neglect and social anxiety, which was no longer significant (r
= .19, p > .10).

4. Discussion

Findings from this study indicate that, compared to HCs, individuals with SAD report more
frequent childhood trauma, specifically, emotional abuse and emotional neglect.
Furthermore, childhood emotional abuse and neglect were associated with current social
anxiety, trait anxiety, depression (neglect only), and self-esteem in individuals with SAD.

4.1.Differences in Childhood Trauma Between SAD and HC

The finding that adults with SAD endorsed histories of more frequent childhood emotional
abuse and neglect is consistent with prior reports of greater rejection, lesser emotional
warmth, and increased use of shame among parents of adults with SAD (Arrindell et al.,
1983; Arrindell et al., 1989; Bruch & Heimberg, 1994). In contrast to previous reports
(Bandelow, et al., 2004), we did not observe higher frequency or rates of sexual abuse
(although there was a trend towards differences in frequency) in adults with SAD.

One reason for this discrepancy may be differences in the study samples. We examined
adults with generalized SAD. Bandelow and colleagues (2004) did not specify whether their
participants met criteria for generalized SAD or non-generalized SAD. Differences in SAD
subtypes could potentially account for these conflicting findings. Additionally, the current
study excluded participants on medications or who met criteria for a variety of comorbid
diagnoses whereas previous studies did not. It is possible that SAD participants in our study
were higher functioning (as might be indicated by the education levels reported) than those

who participated in prior studies. Further, one notable finding was that all but one (98%) of
the HCs in the current study met threshold for physical neglect. This is substantially higher
than recently reported rate of 59% by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Administration on Children (2009). It is possible, therefore, that our null findings related to
sexual and physical abuse are accounted for by a higher functioning SAD and lower
functioning HC sample (however, it should be noted that individuals with SAD in our study
have very high rates of physical neglect as well; see below).

Another difference is in assessment methods. We used the CTQ, whereas Bandelow et al.
(2004) used semi-structured interviews. The two assessment modalities may influence what
types of childhood trauma are reported by patients with SAD. Roy and Perry (2004)
reviewed several childhood trauma interview-based and self-report instruments and noted
that many of the interviews assess responses to specific childhood trauma “vignettes” which
the interviewer subsequently codes as having occurred or not occurred. In contrast, such
specificity is less likely captured in self-report instruments which tend to rely on more
global questions. It is not clear whether patients with SAD will reveal more adverse
childhood information in a self-report versus an interview format.

It is also important to note that the rates of childhood trauma among individuals with SAD
in the current study are similar to those reported by Simon et al. (2009), with the exception
of physical neglect, for which our rates were substantially higher (91% versus 35%). This is
a surprising finding, particularly given the selective screening criteria used in this study
which likely recruited for a higher-functioning clinical group. However, taken in
conjunction with the elevated rates of physical neglect also found in the HC group, these
findings may reflect regional differences in childhood abuse across the U.S.

4.2. Childhood Trauma and Current Adult Psychological Functioning in SAD

Childhood emotional abuse and neglect were significantly associated with social anxiety,
trait anxiety, depression (neglect only), and self-esteem. There were no significant
associations between childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, or physical neglect with these
clinical symptoms among individuals with SAD. These findings replicate Simon and
colleagues' (2009) reports that childhood emotional abuse and neglect are associated with
severity of social anxiety among adults with SAD. They also extend prior studies as we
found these two trauma types were also related to other adult clinical dysfunctions,
specifically higher trait anxiety, greater depression, and lower self-esteem.

These results are generally congruent with what has been reported in the non-clinical
literature, that childhood emotional abuse and neglect are associated with internally-focused
symptoms, whereas childhood sexual and physical abuse are associated with externally-
focused symptoms (Briere & Runtz, 1988, 1990). Although there is an emerging literature
identifying a novelty-seeking, behaviorally disinhibited subtype of SAD (Kashdan &
Hofmann, 2008; Kashdan, McKnight, Richey, & Hofmann, 2009), whether childhood sexual
and physical abuse are associated with more externally destructive behaviors in SAD is a
question that warrants empirical examination.

It bears emphasizing that childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect were highly
correlated in this sample, as has been reported elsewhere (Bernstein et al., 2003). This calls
into question the differentiation of these two constructs and necessarily limits finer
delineation of the differential associations between these two trauma subtypes and adult
clinical symptoms. Rather, a more appropriate interpretation is that a history of emotional
trauma is associated with negative adult clinical symptoms among individuals with SAD,
whereas this relationship does not appear to exist with sexual or physical trauma.

4.3. Limitations and Future Directions

This was a cross-sectional study, and causal inferences cannot be made. Future studies
employing a longitudinal prospective design will be needed to determine whether childhood
emotional abuse and neglect are causal factors in the subsequent development of SAD and
other psychological outcomes. The current research relied on retrospective self-report,
which is limited by social desirability effects and recall bias and which may constrain the
validity of the findings. Indeed, incorporating other methods of assessment, such as
structured interviewing of the participants, as well as their childhood caregivers, would be
highly desirable.

The current study used the CTQ to assess childhood trauma and, therefore, was not designed
to explore differential relations between paternal versus maternal abuse and adult clinical
symptoms. Given that previous studies have shown differences in outcomes of paternal
versus maternal abuse (Briere & Runtz, 1988), future studies should examine how the
perpetrating parent's gender may moderate clinical and functional outcomes in SAD.

Given the evidence linking childhood trauma to various forms of psychopatholgy such as
depression, substance abuse, and PTSD (Gibb et al., 2007; Burnette, Ilgen, Frayne, Lucas,
Mayo, & Weitlauf, 2008; Bremner, Southwick, Johnson, Yehuda, & Charney, 1993), it is
also unclear whether the results from this study are specific to SAD. Although we were able
to somewhat address this issue by controlling for depression in our main analyses, future
studies should further delineate the specificity of the relation between different forms of
childhood trauma and SAD.

Future studies examining potential patient moderators such as comorbidity, subtypes of
SAD, and other individual differences (i.e., coping skills, personality) are also necessary, as
this approach might help clarify for whom childhood trauma will negatively impact adult
psychological functioning. Studies identifying psychological mechanisms that may mediate
the relationship between childhood emotional abuse/neglect and adult psychological
functioning could provide greater understanding of the crucial pathways that explain this
relationship.

Research Highlights

•

Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) have greater levels of childhood
emotional abuse and childhood emotional neglect than healthy controls (HC).
There are no between-group differences in levels of childhood sexual abuse,
physical abuse, or physical neglect.

• Within individuals with SAD, childhood emotional abuse and neglect are
associated with adult social anxiety severity, general anxiety, depression
(neglect only) and self-esteem.

• Within individuals with SAD, childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and

physical neglect are not associated with adult social anxiety severity, general
anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.
