Editorial on the Research Topic
Longitudinal data analysis in child and adolescent mental health

Compared to adults, children and adolescents undergo rapid and dynamic changes in
social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive development and functioning (1, 2). As such,
studies that track continuities and discontinuities of individual development, and that
elucidate factors inﬂuencing diﬀerent patterns of individual development, are essential in
child and adolescent mental health research. Critical questions in this area include: which
problems do children continue to exhibit over time; are there measurable characteristics
speciﬁc to those children; what factors predict future psychopathologies; and what are
the eﬀects of early interventions and treatment on mental health outcomes? These
questions are also important in clinical medicine, given that many psychiatric disorders
and problems, including depression, anxiety, attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, and
behavioral problems, can have their onset in childhood and persist into adolescence
and adulthood (3). However, cross-sectional designs, frequently used in research for the
simplicity of the data acquisition and the practicality in terms of cost and time, cannot
provide answers to research questions focused on functioning over the life course.

In contrast, longitudinal study designs that follow the same individuals over multiple
waves of data collection can shed light on complex developmental processes (4),
providing evidence that can address questions such as those posed above. Additionally,
with the development of standardized and valid assessment tools suitable for repeated
measurements, and advances in statistical modeling and analysis, longitudinal research
has considerable power to elucidate causal mechanisms of mental health disorders and
other disorders. A single-cohort design, where a sample of a deﬁned age is recruited
at one point in time and followed up at subsequent intervals, is the most commonly
used longitudinal design. A longitudinal sequential design, where two or more cohorts
of diﬀering ages are selected at the start of the study and are followed forwards, is
another strategy that overcomes limitations in the single cohort study design, such as

the inability to delineate age eﬀects (developmental changes
associated with age), period eﬀects (variations in the time
periods that aﬀect all population regardless of age and cohort at
the same time: war, infectious disease outbreaks, for example)
and cohort eﬀects (characteristics unique to the birth year of
the cohort). To reﬂect this growing research area, we developed
this Research Topic to present papers using longitudinal data
analyses in child and adolescent mental health.

Several articles published in this collection provided
ﬁndings related to predictive factors for future mental health
problems through their longitudinal study designs. In a Korean
study, 1,760 seventh-grade
community-based longitudinal
adolescents in Korea were followed for 2 years to examine the
eﬀects of exposure to online games before entering elementary
school on Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) occurrence during
the secondary school years (Jeong et al.). The authors employed
generalized-estimating-equation model and identiﬁed exposures
to online games during preschool years as predictors for the
high risk of IGD during the two-year study follow-up period
(adjusted relative risk:1.69; 95%conﬁdence interval:1.08–2.66).
In another study conducted in the Netherland, the authors
utilized longitudinal data prospectively collected from 2,523
individuals between 13 and 26 years of age in the Dutch Tracking
Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (Melo et al.). In this study,
they examined whether reward sensitivity measured at age 13
predicted the course of multiple psychopathology domains over
ﬁve measurement waves during the 14-year follow-up period,
and found that reward sensitivity had a stable main eﬀect on
some psychopathology domains (anxiety, aggression), but that
its eﬀect increased over time on some domains (alcohol and
cannabis use), indicating the transdiagnostic role of reward
sensitivity in the course of the development of psychopathology
between adolescence and adulthood. In addition to these two
articles, Japanese researchers reported the positive inﬂuence of
praise for the child’s prosocial behaviors at 10 years of age on
the child’s depressive symptoms at age 12, and the impact of
maternal stress related to child rearing during the ﬁrst 3 years
following birth on the child’s ADHD symptoms at 12 years of
age using data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study, a population-
based prospective study targeting adolescents (Nagaoka et al.,
Endo et al.). Adequate sample sizes in this cohort study
(3,171 households for the ﬁrst wave of data collection) allowed
the researchers to identify statistically signiﬁcant associations
between the variables tested. In the second study from this
research group, the researchers utilized data from the Maternal
and Child Health Handbook, a home health book distributed
by Japanese municipalities to all pregnant women who are
expected to prospectively record their pregnancy and delivery
and monitor the child’s development, minimizing recall bias
related to child-rearing stress.

In two articles, researchers employed cross-lagged analysis,
an analytical strategy used to describe reciprocal relationships or
directional inﬂuences between variables over time, to examine

the association between family functioning and adolescents’
depressive symptoms in China (Wang et al.), and between
maternal internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) and
the child’s tics in early adolescence in Japan (Yagi et al.). In the
ﬁrst article, 1,301 Chinese middle school students underwent
assessment for family functioning and depressive symptoms
three times over 3 years. This study revealed the negative
inﬂuence of the family function in the 7th grade on the
child’s depressive symptoms in the 8th grade, while the child’s
depressive symptoms in the 8th grade negatively impacted
the family function a year after, suggesting a circular eﬀect
between family function and adolescent depressive symptoms.
In the other article using data from the above-mentioned
cohort study established in Tokyo, researchers identiﬁed
bidirectional relationships between maternal depressive and
tics,
anxious symptoms and the frequency of adolescents’
measured at ages 10 and 12. Findings from these two articles
underscore the importance of advancing family-centered care in
this ﬁeld.

trajectory patterns of

Longitudinal research also enables researchers to distinguish
diﬀerent
the child’s development.
The researchers from Japan using the birth cohort data
in Hamamatsu city employed parallel process multigroup
trajectory
latent class growth analysis to identify distinct
patterns of
three diﬀerent domains of adaptive behaviors
(communication, daily living skills, and socialization) and
assessed sex diﬀerences
in the trajectory structures and
traits of children assigned to each
neurodevelopmental
trajectory class (Nishimura et al.). In this study, researchers
identiﬁed four distinct trajectories and sex diﬀerences in the
scale scores of adaptive behaviors and neurodevelopmental
traits. In another study, researchers retrospectively collected
data on healthcare utilization through medical chart review in
children with neurodevelopmental disorders who presented
to registered medical facilities in Japan (Aoki et al.). Data
related to the number of outpatient consultations, history
of hospitalization, and the use of multi-agency liaison over
the last 5 years, repeatedly measured once every 6 months
(i.e., 10-time points) were analyzed as longitudinal variables
using cluster analysis. Findings revealed that while many
children required consultations for a brief period, some needed
continued support/consultations. In school-age children and
adolescents, ADHD and other psychiatric comorbidities were
associated with clusters indicating the continuous, longer use
of healthcare.

This collection of articles demonstrates the scope and power
of longitudinal research, and we hope that the ﬁndings are
used to drive real change across a range of policy areas and
intervention approaches. The selection of articles represents
our collective belief that longitudinal research plays a vital role
in understanding the social, environmental and family factors
in early life that can aﬀect health and wellbeing over the
life course.
