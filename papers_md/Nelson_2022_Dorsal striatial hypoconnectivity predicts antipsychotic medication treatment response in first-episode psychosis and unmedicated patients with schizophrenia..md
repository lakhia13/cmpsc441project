Abstract

Introduction: The dorsal striatum, comprised of the caudate and putamen, is impli-

cated in the pathophysiology of psychosis spectrum disorders. Given the high con-

centration of dopamine receptors in the striatum, striatal dopamine imbalance is a

likely cause in cortico-striatal dysconnectivity. There is great interest in understand-

ing the relationship between striatal abnormalities in psychosis and antipsychotic

treatment response, but few studies have considered differential involvement of the

caudate and putamen. This study’s goals were twofold. First, identify patterns of dorsal

striatal dysconnectivity for the caudate and putamen separately in patients with a psy-

chosis spectrum disorder; second, determine if these dysconnectivity patterns were

predictive of treatment response.

Methods: Using resting state functional connectivity, we evaluated dorsal striatal con-

nectivity using separate bilateral caudate and putamen seed regions in two cohorts

of subjects: a cohort of 71 medication-naïve first episode psychosis patients and a

cohort of 42 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (along with matched controls).

Patient and control connectivity maps were contrasted for each cohort. After receiving

6 weeks of risperidone treatment, patients’ clinical response was calculated. We used

regression analyses to determine the relationship between baseline dysconnectivity

and treatment response.

Results: This dysconnectivity was also predictive of treatment response in both

cohorts.

Discussion: These findings suggest that the caudate may be more of a driving factor

than the putamen in early cortico-striatal dysconnectivity.
