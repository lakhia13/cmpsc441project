Abstract

Objectives:  We investigated whether spousal caregivers’ greater perception of being appreciated by their partner for their 
help was associated with caregivers’ better mental health and whether caregivers’ higher role overload was related to their 
poorer mental health. We further evaluated whether spousal caregivers’ greater perceived gratitude buffered the association 
between their role overload and mental health.
Methods:  We  examined  306  spousal  caregivers  of  older  adults  with  chronic  illness  or  disability,  drawn  from  the  2011 
National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. We defined mental health as better psycholog-
ical well-being and less psychological distress (i.e., fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms). Hierarchical regression models 
were estimated to test hypotheses.
Results:  Greater perceived gratitude was associated with better psychological well-being, and higher role overload was re-
lated to poorer psychological well-being and greater psychological distress. In addition, greater perceived gratitude buffered 
the associations between role overload and anxiety symptoms as well as psychological well-being.
Discussion:  Findings  suggest  that  spousal  caregivers’  role  overload  may  be  a  strong  risk  factor  for  their  poorer  mental 
health, especially when caregivers feel less appreciated by their partner. Couple-oriented interventions to improve spousal 
caregivers’ mental health could be aimed at reducing their role overload and enhancing perceived gratitude.

Individuals who receive benefits from another person often 
feel  gratitude  toward  the  benefactor  (Emmons,  2008). 
Although  spousal  caregivers  help  their  partner  with  var-
ious  tasks,  little  is  known  about  whether  spousal  care-
givers’ perception of being appreciated by their partner for 
their help relates to their own mental health. According to 
the  find-remind-and-bind  theory,  gratitude  helps  to  bind 
the people in the relationship closer together (Algoe, 2012). 
Indeed,  one’s  felt  or  expressed  gratitude  toward  his/her 
partner  related  to  the  partner’s  greater  relationship  con-
nection and satisfaction (Algoe et al., 2010; Gordon et al., 
2011), which is linked to lower depressive symptoms and 

better life satisfaction (Beach et al., 2003; Carr et al., 2014). 
Furthermore,  expressed  gratitude  increased  prosocial  be-
haviors of the benefactor by enhancing the feeling of being 
valued by others (Grant & Gino, 2010). Given the positive 
effects of gratitude on personal and relational well-being, 
we hypothesized that spousal caregivers’ greater perceived 
gratitude was associated with their better mental health.

We  also  focused  on  spousal  caregivers’  role  over-
load,  a  subjective  caregiving  stressor  that  represents 
caregivers’  appraisals  of  the  extent  to  which  the  care 
demands  are  depleting  their  time  and  energy  (Pearlin 
et  al.,  1990).  Role  overload  specifically  taps  caregivers’

feelings  of  having  more  to  do  than  they  can  handle, 
whereas  caregiver  burden  encompasses  broader  care-
giving  stressors  in  various  domains  including  health 
and finances (Zarit et al., 1986). According to the stress 
process  model  (Pearlin  et  al.,  1990),  caregivers’  higher 
role  overload  contributes  to  their  poorer  mental  health 
via increased intrapsychic strains (i.e., low mastery). The 
association between role overload and depressive symp-
toms was found in spousal caregivers of Alzheimer’s pa-
tients (Mausbach et al., 2012) and informal caregivers of 
functionally  disabled  older  adults,  including  those  with 
dementia (Yates et al., 1999). It remains unclear whether 
role overload is also a risk factor for poor mental health 
among  spousal  caregivers  of  older  adults  without  de-
mentia.  Considering  that  stressors  for  caregivers  may 
vary  by  the  care  recipient’s  health  conditions  (Bertrand 
et  al.,  2006),  this  study  examined  whether  higher  role 
overload is associated with poorer mental health among 
spousal  caregivers  of  older  adults  without  dementia.  In 
line with the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1990), 
we  hypothesized  that  spousal  caregivers’  higher  role 
overload was associated with their poorer mental health.
According to the stress process model, caregivers’ psy-
chosocial  resources  attenuate  the  impact  of  caregiving 
stressors  on  health  (Pearlin  et  al.,  1990).  Perceived  grat-
itude  may  be  an  important  psychosocial  resource  for 
spousal caregivers, given that spouses who feel appreciated 
may feel valued and satisfied with their relationship (Algoe 
et  al.,  2010;  Gordon  et  al.,  2011;  Grant  &  Gino,  2010) 
rather than focus on their role overload. Thus, we hypothe-
sized that greater perceived gratitude attenuated the nega-
tive association between role overload and mental health. 
We operationalized mental health as greater psychological 
well-being  and  less  psychological  distress  (i.e.,  depressive 
and anxiety symptoms).

Method

Participants

This study used data from the 2011 National Health and 
Aging  Trends  Study  (NHATS)  and  National  Study  of 
Caregiving  (NSOC).  If  participants  reported  in  NHATS 
that  their  spouse  or  cohabiting  partner  helped  them  with 
mobility,  self-care,  and/or  household  chores  in  the  past 
month,  we  included  them  as  spousal  caregivers  in  the 
sample (N = 422). Of these, we excluded six who did not 
reside  with  their  partner,  70  who  cared  for  their  partner 
with  dementia,  and  40  who  had  missing  data  on  at  least 
one analytic variable. Thus, the analytic sample consisted 
of  306  spousal  caregivers  with  complete  data  on  study 
variables who care for their partner without dementia (see 
Supplementary Table  1  for  demographic  information  and 
scores on study variables). This study was reviewed by the 
Pennsylvania  State  University  Institutional  Review  Board 
(IRB # STUDY00016565).

Measures

Perceived gratitude
Spousal  caregivers’  perceived  gratitude  was  measured 
with one item: “How much does the care recipient appre-
ciate what you do for him/her?” The item was rated from 
1  (a  lot)  to  4  (not  at  all)  and  reverse  coded,  with  higher 
scores  indicating  greater  perceived  gratitude  (M  =  3.83, 
SD = 0.56).

Role overload
Spousal  caregivers’  role  overload  was  assessed  with  three 
items derived from the Role Overload scale (Pearlin et al., 
1990). The following items were rated from 1 (very much) to 
3 (not so much): “You are exhausted when you go to bed at 
night,” “You have more things to do than you can handle,” 
and “You don’t have time for yourself.” These items were 
reverse coded and averaged, with higher scores indicating 
higher role overload (α = 0.74; M = 1.52, SD = 0.58).

Mental health
Spousal caregivers’ depressive and anxiety symptoms were 
measured with the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-2; Kroenke et al., 2009) and the two-item Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2; Kroenke et al., 2009), re-
spectively. Both scales were modified in NSOC to examine 
the past 1-month period rather than a 2-week period. Items 
were rated from 1 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day) and 
averaged  within  each  scale,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
greater  depressive  (α  =  0.61;  M  =  1.52,  SD  =  0.66)  and 
anxiety  symptoms  (α  =  0.58;  M  =  1.51,  SD  =  0.67). The 
reliability coefficients in this study were lower than those 
reported in a general population study (PHQ-2’s α = 0.78, 
GAD-2’s α = 0.75; Löwe et al., 2010), but comparable to 
that reported in a study of older adults (PHQ-2’s α = 0.57; 
Mogle  et  al.,  2020)  that  also  modified  the  original  ques-
tionnaire to examine the past 1-month period.

Spousal  caregivers’  psychological  well-being  was  as-
sessed  with  the  three  items  derived  from  the  Ryff  Scales 
of Psychological Well-Being (Ryff, 1989; Ryff et al., 1995). 
The following items were rated from 1 (agree strongly) to 4 
(disagree strongly): “My life has meaning and purpose,” “In 
general, I feel confident and good about myself,” and “I like 
my  living  situation  very  much.” These  items  were  reverse 
coded and averaged, with a higher score indicating better 
psychological well-being (α = 0.69; M = 3.59, SD = 0.55).

included  caregivers’  age 

Covariates
Covariates 
(in  years),  sex 
(0  =  male,  1  =  female),  educational  attainment  (1  =  no 
schooling completed to 9 = masters, professional, or doc-
toral  degree),  and  duration  of  relationship  (in  years). We 
also  controlled  for  caregivers’  self-rated  health  measured 
with one item (1 = excellent to 5 = poor), which was reverse 
coded. Furthermore, we covaried for caregivers’ assistance 
with their partner’s activities of daily living (range = 0–5) 

Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2022, Vol. 77, No. 2

and instrumental activities of daily living (range = 0–6) to 
account  for  the  effect  of  objective  caregiving  stressors  on 
mental health (Pearlin et al., 1990).

Statistical Analysis

We  tested  our  hypotheses  using  hierarchical  regression 
models.  Covariates,  predictors,  and  an  interaction  term 
(Perceived  Gratitude  ×  Role  Overload)  were  entered  in 
each step. All continuous predictors and covariates were 
grand-mean centered. For significant interactions, simple 
slopes  were  estimated  at  the  10th  and  90th  percentiles 
of grand-mean centered perceived gratitude, representing 
high  and  low  perceived  gratitude,  respectively.  We  in-
cluded  the  NSOC  sampling  analytic  weight  in  the  re-
gression  models  to  adjust  for  different  probabilities  of 
sample selection and responding to NSOC (Kasper et al., 
2016). We also accounted for clustering and stratification 
of NSOC’s sample design to compute standard errors ap-
propriately. Due to the skewness of three outcome vari-
ables  that  ranged  from  −1.79  to  1.37,  we  repeated  the 
regression  analyses  with  square-root  transformed  out-
come  variables. All  the  effects  of  interest  did  not  differ 
substantially; thus, we report nontransformed results to 
ease interpretation.

Results

As  given  in  Table  1,  greater  perceived  gratitude  was  as-
sociated  with  better  psychological  well-being  (β  =  0.18, 
p  =  .01),  but  not  with  depressive  (β  =  −0.06,  p  =  .20)  or 
anxiety symptoms (β = −0.09, p = .16), partially supporting 
our first hypothesis. Consistent with our second hypothesis, 
higher role overload was associated with more depressive 
(β = 0.30, p < .001) and anxiety symptoms (β = 0.35, p < 

.001) as well as lower psychological well-being (β = −0.40, 
p < .001). In partial support of our third hypothesis, per-
ceived gratitude moderated the effect of role overload on 
anxiety symptoms (β = −0.20, p = .001) and psychological 
well-being (β = 0.12, p = .03), but not on depressive symp-
toms (β = −0.06, p = .26). Simple slopes analyses showed 
that  the  associations  between  role  overload  and  anxiety 
symptoms were significant among both caregivers with low 
and high perceived gratitude, but the magnitude of the as-
sociation was greater among caregivers with low perceived 
gratitude  (B  =  0.68,  p  <  .001)  than  those  with  high  per-
ceived  gratitude  (B  =  0.32,  p  <  .001;  Figure  1).  Similarly, 
the  associations  between  role  overload  and  psychological 
well-being  were  significant  among  both  caregivers  with 
low  and  high  perceived  gratitude,  but  the  magnitude  of 
the  association  was  greater  among  caregivers  with  low 
perceived gratitude (B = −0.52, p < .001) than those with 
high  perceived  gratitude  (B  =  −0.34,  p  <  .001;  Figure  1). 
The  effect  sizes  of  the  interaction  term  for  anxiety  symp-
toms  (f2  =  0.05)  and  psychological  well-being  (f2  =  0.02) 
were small.

Discussion

This finding of the positive association between perceived 
gratitude and psychological well-being is in line with pre-
vious  research  showing  that  individuals  who  perceived 
their partners’ gratitude as more responsive showed greater 
improvement  in  their  psychological  well-being  over  time 
(Algoe  &  Zhaoyang,  2016).  However,  we  found  no  as-
sociation  between  perceived  gratitude  and  psychological 
distress. This may be explained by the fact that positive so-
cial  interactions  relate  to  psychological  well-being  rather 
than distress among older adults (Finch et al., 1989). Given 
that perceiving gratitude is a positive social interaction in

cross-sectional study. Second, caregivers’ race was not as-
sessed  in  the  2011  NSOC,  and  thus  we  were  unable  to 
account  for  potential  racial  differences  in  spousal  care-
givers’  mental  health.  Third,  most  spousal  caregivers  in 
this  study  chose  the  most  positive  answer  option  (i.e.,  a 
lot) when rating how much their partner appreciates their 
help,  which  suggests  that  a  ceiling  effect  might  have  oc-
curred. Furthermore, our sample reported high psycholog-
ical well-being and low psychological distress on average. 
Therefore,  our  findings  may  not  generalize  to  spousal 
caregivers  who  do  not  feel  appreciated  or  are  more  dis-
tressed.  Fourth,  the  role  overload  items  were  not  specific 
to  caregiving,  and  thus  caregivers’  overload  might  occur 
from other responsibilities (e.g., work). Fifth, reliability co-
efficients  for  the  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms  meas-
ures were low. Thus, our findings should be replicated with 
more reliable measures of psychological distress. Last, we 
did not examine the mechanisms through which perceived 
gratitude is related to psychological well-being. Future re-
search might investigate potential mediators (e.g., marital 
satisfaction  or  caregiving  mastery)  that  explain  how  per-
ceived gratitude influences psychological well-being.

Despite  these  limitations,  to  our  best  knowledge,  this 
study is the first to examine the effects of caregivers’ per-
ceived gratitude and role overload on their mental health, 
controlling for the effects of each other. If replicated, our 
findings suggest that spousal caregivers’ role overload may 
be a strong risk factor for their poorer mental health, espe-
cially when caregivers feel less appreciated by their partner. 
Couple-oriented  interventions  to  improve  spousal  care-
givers’ mental health could be aimed at reducing their role 
overload and enhancing perceived gratitude.

Figure 1.  The moderating effect of spousal caregivers’ perceived grati-
tude on the association between their role overload and mental health. 
Notes: Spousal caregivers’ role overload was plotted along the x-axes, 
and  their  mental  health  outcomes  were  plotted  along  the  y-axes. The 
values of low and high role overload were −0.52 and 0.81, which were 
10th  and  90th  percentiles  of  grand-mean  centered  role  overload,  re-
spectively.  Similarly,  the  values  of  spousal  caregivers’  low  and  high 
perceived  gratitude  were  −0.83  and  0.17,  which  were  10th  and  90th 
percentiles  of  grand-mean  centered  perceived  gratitude,  respectively. 
Each  grand-mean  centered  covariate  equaled  zero  and  caregiver  sex 
was fixed at its mean.

general  (Algoe,  2012),  spousal  caregivers  who  perceive 
greater gratitude may have better psychological well-being 
but not necessarily feel fewer depressive or anxiety symp-
toms than those who perceive less gratitude.

We  also  found  that  higher  role  overload  was  associ-
ated with more psychological distress and poorer psycho-
logical  well-being,  supporting  the  stress  process  model 
(Pearlin et al., 1990). These findings extend existing studies 
of  caregivers  of  older  adults  with  Alzheimer’s  disease  or 
functional  disability  (Mausbach  et  al.,  2012; Yates  et  al., 
1999),  indicating  that  role  overload  is  a  risk  factor  for 
poorer  mental  health  among  spousal  caregivers  of  older 
adults with chronic health conditions other than dementia. 
Our findings also suggest that spousal caregivers’ role over-
load—rather  than  perceived  gratitude—may  have  more 
pervasive  impacts  on  their  mental  health,  considering  its 
more  consistent  and  stronger  associations  with  all  three 
outcomes.

Yet,  the  impact  of  role  overload  on  psychological 
well-being  was  attenuated  by  perceived  gratitude.  This 
finding is in line with the evidence that spousal caregivers’ 
help was related to their greater positive affect when care-
givers  perceived  that  their  help  increased  the  partner’s 
well-being  (Monin  et  al.,  2017). We  also  found  that  per-
ceived  gratitude  buffered  the  impact  of  role  overload  on 
anxiety  symptoms,  but  not  on  depressive  symptoms.  One 
explanation  is  that  perceived  gratitude  may  elevate  care-
giving mastery, which more strongly mitigates the effect of 
caregiving stressors on anxiety symptoms than on depres-
sive symptoms (Pioli, 2010). The effect sizes of interactions 
were  small.  Still,  given  that  spousal  caregivers  help  their 
partner  in  everyday  life,  the  effect  of  perceived  gratitude 
may  accumulate  over  time  and  have  a  clinical  impact  on 
caregiver mental health.

Several  limitations  of  this  study  should  be  noted. 
First,  causal  associations  cannot  be  determined  in  this
