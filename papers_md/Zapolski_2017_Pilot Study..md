Abstract

A significant proportion of youth engage in health risk behaviors, which are of concern, as they are 
associated with adverse health consequences across development. Two factors associated with 
engagement in such behaviors are emotion dysregulation and impulsivity. Dialectical Behavioral 
Therapy (DBT) is an effective intervention that enhances emotion regulation skills to reduce 
problem behaviors among adolescent populations; however limited research has been conducted 
implementing the program within school settings. The current study was a 9-week DBT skills 
group conducted among 80 middle school youth, with pre-posttest data among 53 students. 
Findings indicated feasibility to implement the program in schools and preliminary evidence of 
efficacy in decreasing youth’s likelihood to engage in risky, particularly among youth high on an 
emotion-based impulsivity trait. Brief DBT skills group may be an effective program to be utilized 
by school nurses and health care teams to reduce health risk behaviors among school-aged youth.

Significant proportions of youth have tried alcohol, marijuana, and have engaged in sexual 
intercourse (Kann et al., 2016). Moreover, nearly a third of youth report being in at least one 
physical fight during the past year (Kann et al., 2016). Engagement in such high-risk 
behaviors is of concern, as they are associated with the leading causes of death among 
persons aged 10–24 in the United States (Eaton et al., 2012). Moreover, even 
experimentation in such behaviors, particularly substance use, during adolescence is of 
concern, as it is predictive of problematic use and adverse health consequences into 
adulthood (DeWit, Adlaf, Offord, & Ogborne, 2000; Tucker, Ellickson, Collins, & Klein, 
2006). Thus prevention programs are needed to mitigate engagement in such behaviors 
during adolescence.

Although adolescence is characterized by a normative increase in risk taking behavior, with 
80 percent of 11 to 15 year olds exhibiting at least one reckless act within the past month

(Maggs et al., 1995), there are some characteristics that place youth at higher risk. Two 
factors that have garnered much attention are emotion dysregulation and impulsivity. 
Emotion dyregulation is conceptualized as the inability to modulate one’s emotional state. 
During adolescence, psychosocial capacities that help with regulating emotions are not fully 
developed (Larson, Moneta, Richards, & Wilson, 2002; Steinberg, 2007), which increases 
the likelihood of adolescents engaging in health risk behaviors (Brown, Houck, Lescano, 
Donenberg, Tolou-Shams, & Mello, 2012; McLaughlin, Hatzenbuehler, Mennin, & Nolen-
Hoeksema, 2011; Raffaelli & Crockett, 2003; Tarter, 2002). For example, Hessler and Katz 
(2010) found that youth with poor emotional regulation had a higher likelihood of using hard 
drugs, having more sexual partners, and experiencing more behavioral problems.

Impulsivity is a complex construct that can be broadly defined as a disposition to engage in 
rash action. Over the past few decades, researchers have worked to disaggregate impulsivity 
into five specific traits (i.e., sensation seeking, lack of planning, lack of perseverance, 
negative urgency, and positive urgency), that, though associated, differentially predict 
behavior among youth populations, which has been since been replicated by other 
researchers (Tomko, Prisciandaro, Falls, & Magid, 2016; Zapolski, Stairs, Settles, Combs, & 
Smith, 2010). Among such studies, the impact of the emotion-based traits (i.e., negative and 
positive urgency) has been shown to have the strongest effect on health risk behaviors 
among adolescents.

Negative and positive urgency can be defined as the tendency to engage in rash acts when 
experiencing intense negative and positive emotions, respectively. There is strong evidence 
for elevated risk for engagement in drinking, smoking, marijuana use, and binge eating 
among youth who exhibit elevations in these emotion-based personality traits (Combs, 
Spillane, Caudill, Stark, & Smith, 2012; Pearson, Zapolski, & Smith, 2015; Robinson, Ladd, 
& Anderson, 2014; Zapolski, Cyders, & Smith, 2009; Zapolski et al, 2010). For example, 
Riley, Rukavina, & Smith (2016) found that urgency predicted subsequent drinking among 
youth followed from 5th grade to 8th grade. Moreover, Tomko and colleagues (2016) found 
among treatment seeking adolescent that positive urgency was associated with frequency of 
binge drinking and negative urgency was associated with marijuana use and substance use 
problems.

It thus appears important to focus on emotion-based rash action among adolescents. By 
addressing emotion regulation during adolescence, we may be able to reduce engagement in 
such health risk behaviors earlier in development, the likelihood of progression to more 
severe behaviors, and the occurrence of associated negative health outcomes (Eaton et al., 
2012; Kann et al., 2016). One of the leading treatments for addressing poor emotion 
regulation is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). DBT is cognitive behavioral treatment 
program, but differs from traditional cognitive behavioral programs by the inclusion of 
dialectical philosophy, radical behaviorism, and mindfulness. DBT was originally developed 
for chronically suicidal adults with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which comprised 
of a 12-month commitment for individual therapy and concurrent group-based skills training 
that taught modules on emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, 
and mindfulness (Linehan, 1993). To date, five randomized controlled trials have been 
conducted on DBT for BPD. A meta-analysis based on these studies by Panos et al. (2014)

found a benefit of DBT compared to treatment as usual in decreasing suicidal attempts. DBT 
has been adapted for a variety of disorders including substance abuse, depression, and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among adult populations (MacPherson, Cheavens, & 
Fristad, 2013), as well as self-injurious behavior, oppositional defiant disorder, and 
externalizing disorders among adolescents (MacPherson et al., 2013). A recent meta-
analysis examining the efficacy of DBT for adolescents found a large effect in reducing non-
suicidal self-injury and a small effect on depression (Cook & Gorraiz, 2016).

Studies have also documented the efficacy of the DBT skills group as a stand-alone 
treatment (Chugani, Ghali, & Brunner, 2013; Meaney-Tavares & Hasking, 2013). Blackford 
and Love (2011) conducted a weekly DBT skills group for a six-month period in a 
community mental health setting, finding a significant decrease in depression scores, with 
greater improvements on depression and other outcome variables (i.e., symptom severity, 
quality of life, and community functioning) based on number of sessions attended. Rizvi and 
Steffel (2014) conducted a shorter eight-week DBT skills group of the emotion regulation 
and mindfulness components among college students, finding significant improvements on 
measures of emotion regulation, positive and negative affect, use of coping skills in daily 
life, mindfulness skills, and work and social functioning.

To date, only a few studies have examined the use of the DBT skills group among adolescent 
populations (e.g., Memel, 2012; Nelson-Gray, Keane, Hurst, Mitchell, Warburton, Chok, & 
Cobb, 2006), with only one conducted in a school setting (Ricard, Lerma, & Heard, 2013). 
Specifically, Ricard and colleagues (2013) conducted a 4-week skills group among a sample 
of adolescents attending a Disciplinary Alternative Education Program. Pre-post test 
comparisons reveals improvements in both student and parent-reported indicators of 
behavioral distress compared to youth who did not receive the intervention. However, more 
evidence to support the efficacy of DBT skills groups among adolescent populations in 
school settings is needed, and is consistent with a recent call from the American 
Psychological Associations Division of School Psychology requesting 1) more studies 
documenting the efficacy of DBT as a prevention and treatment tool in school settings, even 
among youth not diagnosed with a disorder, and 2) further research exploring shorter 
treatment sequences of the program from the current 1 year program (Fiorillo & Long, 
2012).

The aims of this study were to: examine whether (1) a brief 9-week adaptation of DBT could 
be successfully implemented as a preventative intervention program in a school-based 
setting for middle-school youth (i.e., ability to recruit participants and administer all sessions 
of the 9-week program), (2) the program would show evidence of reducing risk for 
engagement in health risk health behaviors among participants, and (3) this program was 
particularly effective for youth exhibiting heightened urgency traits, such that decrease in 
likelihood to engage in health risk behaviors would be stronger for those with high scores on 
the urgency traits.

Procedures.

The current study is a one sample pre-post design of a 9-week DBT skills group. 
Participants were recruited into the study based on referrals from school staff and 
administration of youth who had been experiencing behavioral or academic problems within 
the school setting, in order to increase power to detect engagement in risk-taking behaviors 
and potential changes in behaviors post-intervention. The inclusion criteria for the study 
were youth who attended the designated school, were currently enrolled 7th or 8th grade, and 
could read and understand English. There were no exclusion criteria based on psychiatric 
diagnosis or treatment.

Study participants were 80 students from 4 urban middle schools in the Southeastern United 
States. Of the 80 participants, 20 did not complete the post-treatment questionnaire due to 
early dropout (retention rate=75%). Another 7 participants were excluded from analysis due 
to not completing study measures. The final sample for data analysis was 53 participants. 
The majority of participants were in 7th grade (64%; mean age = 12.7) and female (51%). 
Most participants identified themselves as African American (47%), followed by White 
(42%), Multiracial (9%), and Hispanic (2%). See Figure 1 for flow chart on recruitment and 
retention.

As approved by the university IRB, participants were recruited through 4 local public middle 
schools based on referrals from the guidance counselors, staff, and administration at the 
school. All participants were be told that the group would address factors that hinder 
reaching goals, such as stress, anger, sadness, and interpersonal difficulties, and will teach 
participants skills on how to manage those factors. A description of the group and a consent 
form was sent home to the guardians of the child participants by the school administration 
on behalf of the research team. The guardians were required to return a signed consent to the 
school administration or guidance counselor prior to the first day of the group in order for 
the student to be eligible to participate. The student also received information about the 
group and signed an assent form.

Each skills group consisted of 5–10 students with a mixture of boys and girls, co-led by two 
clinical psychology doctoral students who were trained by a licensed psychologist with 
intensive professional training in DBT. Sessions occurred during school hours, primarily 
during elective class periods, and were located on school campus in an unoccupied 
classroom or conference room. The program lasted for nine weeks, with one session a week. 
Each session ran for approximately 45 minutes (the length of a class period) and included a 
review of homework from the previous session, presentation of new material, in-session 
activities related to the topic, and assignment of homework for the following session. 
Session topics corresponded with the DBT modules on emotion regulation, distress 
tolerance, and interpersonal skills (see Table 1 for more details on content for each session). 
The content of the groups followed closely to that of the original manual (Linehan, 1993), 
but was modified to provide examples that were developmentally appropriate for school-
aged youth. To measure efficacy of the program, participants completed pre-post measures

assessing the urgency traits, lifetime engagement in risky behaviors, and intentions to engage 
in risky behaviors at the first and final group session.

Measures

Demographic Measure.

A series of demographic questions where included to assess the participant’s age, year in 
school, race/ethnicity, and gender.

The UPPS-P-Child Version (UPPS-P-C; Zapolski et al., 2010).

The UPPS-P-C is a 40-item Likert-type scale self-report measure designed to assess five 
impulsivity-related traits (negative urgency, lack of planning, lack of perseverance, sensation 
seeking, and positive urgency). Items are rated from 1 (not at all like me) to 4 (very much 
like me). Scale scores were calculated as the sum of item responses, with higher scores 
indicating more impulsive tendencies. For the current study, we were only interested in 
examining the moderating effect of the emotion-based impulsivity traits, negative and 
positive urgency, on the program outcome variables. Thus, only those trait scales were 
included in the study analyses. Consistent with past work, the two scales appear to be 
internally consistent (α = .78 and .92 for negative and positive urgency, respectively).

Mood-Based Questionnaire (MBQ-C; Zapolski et al., 2010).

The MBQ-C is a self-report measure that assesses lifetime endorsement and current 
likelihood to engage in 24 risky behaviors while being in either an unusually negative mood 
or an unusually positive mood. Lifetime endorsement is measured on a dichotomous, yes-no 
scale. Likelihood to engage in in risky behaviors is measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with 
1 (not at all), 3 (maybe) and 5 (will definitely try). Behaviors assessed on the measure 
include drank alcohol, broke the law, smoked a cigarette or cigar, kissed someone 
romantically, urinated outside, shoplifted, started a fight, trespassed, cheated on a test, 
disobeyed your parent. In previous research with adolescents, good evidence was reported 
for the MBQ-C’s reliability and validity (Zapolski et al., 2010). In the current sample, there 
was good internal consistency (negative: α = .86-.89; positive: α = .85-.92).

Data Analysis

Approximately 1 percent of the data among the 53 participants was missing. Little’s MCAR 
analysis was conducted with a non-significant effect, indicating that data in our sample was 
missing at random. Data were imputed using multiple imputation (Buuren & Groothuis-
Oudshoorn, 2011) on pre and post scale items for the urgency traits and intentions to engage 
in risky behaviors. A majority of these participants (91%) had three or fewer missing data 
points. All subsequent analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0. Correlations were 
conducted between the urgency traits, baseline risk-taking behavior, and baseline intentions 
to engage in risky behavior. To examine the effect of the intervention on intentions to engage 
in risky behavior paired t-tests were conducted. To examine whether changes in intentions to 
engage in risky behavior based on pre and post-treatment assessment were stronger for

youth higher on the urgency traits, Pearson correlations and linear regression analysis were 
conducted.

Results

Consistent with previous studies, most youth reported engaging in risky behaviors (mean = 
5). The types of behaviors engaged in did vary based on mood state. Approximately half of 
youth reported breaking/throwing something, starting a fight, and disobeying their parent/
teacher while in an extremely negative mood. Moreover, nearly one-third of youth reported 
hurting themselves/someone else and one-quarter reported trespassing or cheating on a test/
homework due to a negative mood. As for positive mood, approximately half of youth 
reported that they had kissed someone romantically and ate a large amount of food. One-
third of youth had broken or thrown something, did something they normally would not do, 
and disobeyed their parent/teacher due to being in a positive mood. Also consistent with 
previous literature, the urgency traits were significantly correlated with pre-treatment 
measures of lifetime risk-taking (negative urgency (NU): r = 0.43, p < .01; positive urgency 
(PU): r = 0.49, p < .001) and likelihood to engage in risky behaviors (NU: r = 0.52, p < .001; 
PU: r = 0.49, p < .001) while in intense negative and positive moods, respectively.

Pre- and post-treatment assessments were compared to examine changes in likelihood to 
engage in such behaviors due to mood states. There was a significant decrease in intentions 
to engage in risky behaviors due to positive mood (t(52) = −2.65, p < .01), and marginally 
significant changes for negative mood (t(52) = −1.59, p = .06). Moreover, an effect based on 
impulsivity was found, with elevations in negative urgency associated with steeper decreases 
in the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to negative mood by the end of 
treatment (r = −0.27, p < .05). This relationship was also significant based on regression 
analysis (b = −.745, p < .05). See Tables 2 and 3 for complete details.

Discussion

There is robust evidence for DBT as an effective treatment program for a variety of 
adolescent problem behaviors (MacPherson et al., 2012). Moreover, studies have 
documented the efficacy of the DBT skills group as a stand-alone treatment of problem 
behaviors (Blackford & Love, 2011; Chugani et al., 2013; Meaney-Tavares & Hasking, 
2013; Rizvi & Steffel, 2014). However, to date, only one study has been published using the 
DBT skills modules as a stand-alone program within a school setting. The current pilot study 
aimed to expand upon this work by providing evidence on the feasibility of conducting a 9-
week DBT skills group among middle school youth in a school-based setting and providing 
preliminary indication of its efficacy at reducing intentions to engage in risky behaviors.

This pilot study provided evidence for the feasibility of implementing the brief DBT skills 
program in a school setting, as all school administration who were provided information 
regarding the pilot program agreed to participate. Moreover, we were able to successfully 
recruit 80 youth to participate in the program and retained 66% throughout the 9 weeks of 
the intervention. It is possible that the timing of the intervention was related to drop out of 
some participants, as the end of the nine weeks was toward the end of each school semester.

Moreover, we were able to document preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the program to 
reduce the likelihood of engagement in risk-taking behaviors among middle school students. 
Study findings also suggest that though the program can be useful for all youth, it can be 
particularly beneficial for high-risk youth who exhibit elevations in negative urgency. 
Although the association between negative urgency and changes in risk was significant, the 
effect was weak in magnitude. It is possible that a stronger effect may be observed with a 
larger sample size.

Study limitations should be noted. Given that the current study was a pilot, the lack of a 
control group provides threats to internal validity, limiting interpretation that reductions in 
risk was due to participation in the intervention. Additionally, recruitment was based on 
referral by school staff and we did not assess participant’s diagnostic history or history of 
treatment. Obtaining such information would be beneficial to assess the impact of the 
intervention for a particular subgroup of youth, as well as the impact of the intervention 
above prior treatment exposure. Lastly, changes in emotion regulation skills and reduction in 
health risk behaviors were not assessed. Inclusion of such measures would allow for the 
assessment of mechanisms within the intervention to reduce risk-taking and specific 
behavioral outcomes.

In sum, implementing prevention programs, such as DBT, in school-based setting, is critical 
as it provides the opportunity to reach youth at earlier stages of risk, thus reducing the 
likelihood of progression to more severe behaviors and diagnosable levels of dysfunction. 
School nurses are particularly well suited to deliver such services, given their role within 
schools in promoting adaptive health behaviors. School nurses provide important resources 
to students, such as preventive and screening services, health education, and intervention 
programming (Broussard, 2004; Council of School Health, 2008; Krause-Parello & Samms, 
2010; National Association of School Nurses, 2016). Moreover, there is strong evidence to 
support the role of nurses in the areas of smoking cessation (Pbert et al., 2011), reducing 
obesity (Gellar, Druker, Osganian, Gapinski, LaPelle, & Pbert, 2012), and teaching health 
curricula more broadly (Krause-Parello & Samms, 2010) within school settings. Thus, it is 
plausible to extend upon this work to interventions focused on emotion regulation as an 
indicated intervention for at-risk youth or provided as part of health curricula, which can be 
coordinated by school nurses and delivered alongside teachers or collaboratively with school 
health service teams (Broussard, 2004; Council on School Health, 2008; Denehy, 2004). 
Training and consultation for DBT skills group could also be obtained through 
collaborations with trained local health professionals or by attending workshops provided by 
the Linehan Institute.
