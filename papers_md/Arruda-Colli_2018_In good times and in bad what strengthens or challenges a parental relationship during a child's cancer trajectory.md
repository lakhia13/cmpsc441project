Abstract

Objectives: To identify events during a child’s cancer trajectory when parents perceived their 
marriage/partnership to be most strengthened and/or challenged.

Research approach: Using a cross sectional qualitative design, participants completed a self-
administered questionnaire addressing changes in their relationship during their child’s cancer 
trajectory, including events perceived to strengthen/challenge their relationship, and 
recommendations for other parents.

Participants: 192 parents of pediatric oncology patients across 3 institutions. Data were 
analyzed using qualitative content analysis.

Findings: Themes included relationship-specific, illness experience-related, and external 
supports/stressors that impacted the relationship. Dyadic strategies, empathic communication and 
supportive behaviors strengthened the couple’s relationship, whereas physical and emotional 
distance most commonly challenged the relationship. Recommendations to other parents included 
open communication, couple’s connectedness, and use of external supports.

Interpretation: Offering psychosocial support and helping parents anticipate when their 
relationship can be strengthened/challenged can be an important part of ongoing care. Implications 
for psychosocial providers: Teaching communication and dyadic coping strategies can help parents 
manage stress and build cohesion.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE

When a child is diagnosed with cancer, there are a myriad of stressors that parents may 
experience. Besides handling the child’s diagnosis, symptoms and treatment needs, a cancer 
diagnosis requires an adjustment process that includes restructuring the family’s routine and 
roles, dealing with periods of separation, adapting plans for the future, as well as general 
uncertainty with regard to the child’s prognosis. These must be balanced with one’s work 
schedules and family activities.1–5 Families can be profoundly impacted by a child’s cancer 
diagnosis and, while the number of studies investigating the impact of childhood cancer on 
the parents’ relationship is increasing, there are still important gaps to be addressed.1,5

Parents of children with cancer experience psychological distress, such as anxiety, 
depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms.2,3,6,7 While some studies have found levels 
of distress are highest at diagnosis and improve during and off treatment, others have found 
that some parents still present with clinically elevated levels of distress years later, which 
reinforces the importance of evaluating psychosocial needs over time.8

Gender differences have also been identified as a factor impacting illness-related beliefs, 
psychological distress, and coping styles, suggesting the importance of looking at different 
approaches in helping fathers and mothers cope with their child’s cancer.9–11 How parents 
cope with stressors over the illness trajectory can impact their relationship as a couple and as 
a family, including the care of the child undergoing treatment and their healthy siblings.
2,12,13 Increased marital dissatisfaction has been reported after a child’s cancer diagnosis, in 
particularly when a child’s illness persists, relapses and/or requires continued therapy.
10,11, 14, 15. Experiencing a child’s long-term illness has been associated with depletion of 
parental resources, sense of coherence and social supports.10 Better understanding of the 
times when couples and families are most vulnerable is crucial for developing meaningful, 
targeted interventions to support families at these times.

Several studies have investigated the factors that impact a parental relationship after a child’s 
cancer diagnosis. These studies have described the importance of assessing interpersonal 
dynamics as well as individual strategies to adjust to stressors, highlighting the benefits of 
dyadic coping efforts couples use when facing stressors.9,16,17 Dyadic coping is seen as an 
interpersonal process used to cope with a stressor concerning both partners. This process 
includes identifying and interpreting partner’s stress signs; individual coping responses; and 
joint coping efforts to deal with daily concerns, critical situations and long-term stressors.
18,19

Bodenmann 18 divided a couple’s pattern of managing stress into positive and negative 
dyadic coping. Positive dyadic coping refers to situations when one partner assists the other 
in his/her coping efforts (i.e., helping with daily tasks, offering empathetic understanding or 
helping the partner to reframe the situation), takes over the other’s responsibilities in order 
to reduce the stress experienced by the other partner (i.e., one partner does groceries when 
the other picks up children from school), or the couple engages in the coping process 
symmetrically (i.e., seeking information together, jointly solving problems, or sharing 
responsibilities). Negative dyadic coping involves interactions that could lead to distance in

a relationship (i.e., use sarcasm or minimize the amount of stress experienced by the other 
partner, offer support without intention or capacity to help or one partner initiates 
conversations but is not truly invested in listening or understanding). Along with being a 
good resource to help partners reduce stress, recognizing dyadic coping patterns and 
prioritizing positive dyadic coping interactions can also contribute to maintaining a sense of 
“we-ness” (a couple’s mutual investment in their relationship and in each other, involving 
reciprocity and prioritization of the relationship) and to better marital functioning.18,19

As part of a larger cross sectional, multi-center study examining the impact of a child’s 
cancer diagnosis on the quality of the parents’ relationship and parental dyadic adjustment,12 
open-ended questions were designed to better understand parents’ perception of experiences 
and events that brought them closer as a couple during their child’s cancer trajectory. These 
data are unique in that it describes parents’ perception of changes within their relationship 
over time. The study also uses dyadic coping theory to not only illustrate participants’ 
perceived challenges to the partnership, but also identify the times they felt most emotionally 
connected, as well as participants’ recommendations for other couples who have a child 
diagnosed with cancer.

METHODS

Participants

Procedures

Parents of pediatric patients diagnosed with cancer treated in three different cancer centers 
were invited to participate in this study. Parents’ eligibility criteria included being: English-
speaking; in a partnership at the time the child was diagnosed with cancer; and at least one 
of the participants being the biological/legal parent of the child. Both parents were not 
required to participate. Child-related inclusion criteria were: ages 1–21 years old at the time 
of diagnosis, and between 3 months post-diagnosis and 3 years post completion of therapy. 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer Institute 
and participating sites.

During the child’s visit to the participating institutions, parents were invited to enroll in the 
study. Investigators at each site introduced the study, obtained consent and then participants 
were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire, either on paper or online. The 
questionnaire included open-ended questions about the participant’s perception of their 
relationship over the course of their child’s cancer trajectory.

Three open-ended questions were examined to explore the situations that significantly 
enhanced or caused distance for the parental partnership in addition to gathering 
recommendations parents had for other parents like them. The participants’ provided written 
responses to questions 1) “Is there any event or time that stands out in your mind that helped 
bring you closer together?”, 2) “Is there any event or time that stands out in your mind when 
you felt most distant from your partner/spouse?”, and 3) “What recommendations would you 
make to a couple whose child was recently diagnosed with cancer in terms of trying to keep 
their relationship strong?”.

Data Analysis

Page 4

A thematic analysis approach20 was used to analyze the data. Two investigators (LW, SZB) 
and one trained coder (MAC) independently read all answers, with all personal identifiers 
removed. Analysis began with an open coding process where the coders immersed 
themselves in the data to develop a thorough understanding of emerging themes and 
subthemes. Recurring themes and relational patterns were documented. Following open 
coding, categories and themes were grouped together to form a coding scheme. Themes 
were modified and finalized based on team consensus and a coding dictionary was then 
developed. The final coding system was then applied to all responses individually by the 
reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was determined based on the extent that the independent 
coders agreed on the coding of the themes. Inter-rater reliability was consistently >80% in 
all coding domains. Discrepancies were discussed face-to-face between reviewers and 
reconciled through review of the coded material until agreement was reached.

One hundred and ninety-two parents participated in this study, including fifty-two couples, 
with a response rate of 90.9%. Participants were between 19 to 62 years of age (mean of 
45.4, SD = 8.1) and 63.5% mothers (biological, step or foster/adoptive) of the child with 
cancer. The majority of the sample were married or partnered (95.9%), with mean 
relationship length of 17.4 years (range 0 – 40, SD = 8.8), Caucasian (78.6%) and had 
children actively receiving treatment (64.6%). Most common children’s diagnoses included 
sarcomas, blood cancers, brain and thyroid cancers. Table 1 provides demographic 
information. Further demographic information from this study was previously described in 
Wiener et al.12 Our results are presented by the main themes and sub-themes identified 
within each open-ended question.

RESULTS

Situations that Strengthen the Relationship

Overriding themes emerged about events that were perceived to bring the couple closer 
together. These included strategies and issues specific to the partners’ relationship, those 
related to the illness experience and supports external to the relationship (Table 2).

Relationship-specific issues—Managing stress as a couple was perceived to strengthen 
the relationship. Examples included events when one partner assisted the other in coping 
with a stressful situation by offering empathic understanding, providing practical advice, 
helping reframe an event, or expressing solidarity with the other partner. Other strategies 
frequently described as strengthening the relationship included joint problem solving and 
information seeking, sharing feelings, and having a mutual commitment.

Participants found the ability of one of the partners to take over responsibilities as a helpful 
strategy to reduce stress. In these situations, an explicit change in previous division of chores 
and responsibilities occurred, sometimes with partners reversing roles, which parents 
reported helped them deal with stressful moments individually or as a couple.

Participants valued their own and their partner’s perceived change of priorities and 
perspectives. An appreciation of the “little things in life” and daily moments shared with 
family were highlighted.

Illness experience-related—Specific medical events across the child’s illness trajectory 
were reported to bring the couple closer together. Examples included being together when 
experiencing a frightening medical event, such as an acute event and surgery, particularly 
when faced with the fear of a poor prognosis.

Experiencing renewed hope was also mentioned as an event that strengthened a couple’s 
relationship. In particular, participants cited finding out about a new treatment option or 
deciding on a new protocol as increasing a sense of unity or “we-ness”.

External supports impacting the relationship—Participants reported external 
sources of support helped them cope with the stressors of cancer treatment individually and 
as a couple. This included support from their faith community, family and friends. Faith and 
spirituality were described as contributing to a sense of peace, comfort, purpose, and 
connection to others. Some participants described being impressed by their child’s resilience 
when facing different moments of the illness trajectory. Witnessing the child’s strength of 
character, moral qualities and positive attitude were identified as situations that unified 
couples and gave them strength to overcome critical situations.

Situations that Challenge the Relationship

Participants provided examples of times they felt distant from their partner or perceived their 
partnership to weaken. As with situations that were perceived to strengthen the relationship, 
themes emerged that related to aspects of the partners’ relationship, to the illness experience 
and to external events impacting the relationship (Table 3).

Relationship-specific issues—Distance often occurred when one partner felt the other 
partner dismissed their emotional needs, minimized the seriousness of their stress, left them 
feeling inadequate or guilty, or lacked interest in the details of their child’s care. Some 
participants acknowledged their own role in inducing emotional distance in the relationship, 
for example when they didn’t prioritize having time alone with their partner or avoided 
difficult conversations.

Participants acknowledged the impact their own stress had on their relationship. Some 
described how challenging it was to cope with their partner’s emotional and physical needs 
on top of their own stress and the needs of their child(ren). Other participants described 
having a different coping style than their partner, which resulted in a lack of mutual 
understanding and more emotional distance in the relationship.

Difficulty making joint treatment decisions and lack of agreement on where or how 
treatment should be administered were also reported as issues that strained the relationship. 
For some families, decisions that pertained to daily family life (e.g. caring for the healthy 
siblings, having different discipline styles) were reported to cause the couple significant 
stress. Additionally, some participants noted that their relationship experienced the most

emotional distance at the end of treatment, at the time when they were trying to normalize 
their life, reorganize their routine and move forward from the cancer experience.

Illness experience-related—For many participants, physical time apart from their 
partner and family due to treatment was reported to have a negative impact on 
communication, and often resulted in a sense of isolation in the relationship. This sense of 
being emotionally alone was exacerbated when faced with difficult medical events, 
particularly those with an uncertain outcome.

External stressors impacting the relationship—Along with their child’s cancer 
treatment, participants described having to deal with stressful events such as the needs of 
extended family, financial worries, and job insecurities, each of which added stress to the 
relationship. The child’s physical and emotional needs led to limited time alone, reduced 
intimacy and reduced sense of needed togetherness. These situations were perceived to be an 
additional challenge to their relationship.

Recommendations to couples

When invited to make recommendations for other couples whose child was recently 
diagnosed with cancer, participants emphasized the importance of open and respectful 
communication. They also stressed the importance of finding ways to remain emotionally 
connected, emotionally and physically healthy, and of seeking and accepting outside support 
(Table 4).

What to do as a couple—The most common recommendation made by participants was 
to work towards open and respectful communication, especially during stressful times and 
events. They also emphasized the importance of not shielding difficult emotions from one 
another.

Participants underscored the need to stay emotionally connected. Suggestions included 
making time to be alone together, and maintaining physical touch and intimacy. Similarly, 
participants highlighted the importance of respecting individual coping styles and avoiding 
blame. While some participants suggested that parents should focus on the child and what 
needs to be done for his/her healing, they also reflected on the stress the child experiences 
when they perceive their parents are angry with each other and/or not coping well.

What to do individually—Some participants pointed out the importance of having a 
positive mindset during the cancer trajectory. Examples included being emotionally present 
and not taking any positive event, experience, or each other for granted.

Various strategies to relieve stress and maintain balance were described, such as regular 
physical activity, healthy eating habits, and time for oneself and to socialize with friends. 
Some participants emphasized the value of one’s faith or spiritual beliefs in finding strength 
and peace during challenging times.

Utilize external resources—Participants acknowledged the importance of the support 
received from professionals, family and friends. Opportunities to share experiences with

other parents with a similar experience were also valued. Other participants addressed the 
importance of being educated about the illness and treatment. Learning from and trusting the 
team taking care of their child was described as important in helping couples feel less 
burdened by their decisions. Education about their child’s disease and treatment options also 
provided a sense of shared responsibility with the team.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to qualitatively explore specific factors and events during the child’s 
cancer experience that can strengthen and/or challenge the parent’s relationship. Our data 
offers important information on how partners perceived the impact of their child’s cancer 
trajectory on their relationship. Three major themes emerged, which represent events and 
situations that resulted in emotional bonding or distancing.

First, as noted in earlier studies, opportunities for relationship growth can occur.2 Factors 
that were perceived to strengthen the relationship included the couple’s own style of relating 
to one another, illness-related experiences, and external stressors. Participants in this study 
valued their partner’s provision of support and recognition of their specific emotional needs. 
Being able to help each other reduce stress and problem solve jointly, particularly when 
faced with critical moments in their child’s care, resulted in feeling stronger as a couple. As 
noted by Compas et al.4 and Hoekstra-Weebers et al.17 new treatment options can also 
provide a sense of shared hope and the emotional energy needed to cope with the stresses 
ahead.

Participants in our study also acknowledged that a change in their priorities had a positive 
impact on their relationship. They seemed to direct more attention to family life events, and 
to value situations they would have previously “taken for granted”. Aligned with a recent 
literature review on factors associated with parental distress in the context of childhood 
cancer,7 the use of social support, practicing one’s spirituality, and appreciation for the 
child’s attitude or character were also considered helpful coping strategies to maintain a 
healthy relationship.

Second, when asked about factors that challenged the partnership, both physical and 
emotional situations were described. Participants reported that their relationships were 
negatively impacted by external stressors (i.e., dealing with extended family, financial 
insecurity) and the burden of the child’s illness and treatment (i.e., long hospitalizations 
limiting the couple’s time to have meaningful conversations, make decisions or experience 
intimacy). Despite recognizing the negative impact on their relationship, participants 
described finding it difficult to make the changes needed to improve their relationship or to 
make their relationship a priority. Interestingly, many participants felt the most distanced 
from their partner when treatment was completed. Perhaps, it is not until the crisis has 
passed and treatment demands have lessened (a point in time when parents are expected to 
return to “normal life”), that they recognize the impact that their child’s cancer has had on 
their relationship. Helping parents transition from active treatment to survivorship should 
include guidance on addressing relationship issues that might have been put aside due to 
competing priorities and needs.

Third, when asked about their recommendations for other couples after a child is diagnosed 
with cancer, participants often drew from their own experiences. They suggested couples 
utilize individual and joint strategies, as well as external resources. Individual strategies 
included taking care of oneself and finding ways of maintaining hope and strength 
throughout the child’s treatment. Specifically, participants reinforced the idea that one needs 
to remain as emotionally and physically healthy as possible in order to take care of their 
child, family, and their relationship.

Recommendations for strengthening the emotional connection included establishing 
emphatic communication, supporting each other emotionally and learning ways to manage 
stress as a couple. Additionally, participants reported the importance of couples openly and 
honestly sharing their ideas, thoughts and worries with each other, even when their first 
inclination is not to burden the other. The need to respect coping styles that are different than 
one’s own and to find moments to connect as a couple were also emphasized. Seeking (and 
accepting) help from others, both from professionals and their peers, was strongly 
recommended by participants. This reinforces the importance of medical centers working 
towards strong healthcare provider-family communication.

The need to assess and address parental mental health needs has recently become a standard 
of psychosocial of care.21 Access to assessment and counseling for parents should be offered 
at all cancer centers.22 Psychosocial providers have an important role to play in helping 
parents anticipate events that can strengthen or challenge their relationship, increase their 
communication abilities, and identify possible sources of support in the community.7 
Targeted interventions guided by dyadic coping strategies could impact parents ability to 
support one another by working together, learning to recognize the other’s emotional needs, 
and sharing responsibilities when facing challenging situations.18 Better care for the parental 
dynamic is an important part of ongoing psychosocial care for the whole family.5,16

There are several limitations to note. First, participants were only English‐speaking, with an 
underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, and an overrepresentation of mothers. However, 
considering it is often a mother who accompanies the child to the hospital visit, we were 
pleased with one-third of the sample being fathers. Second, this was a cross sectional study. 
A longitudinal design would provide deeper insight into how the couples communication 
and quality of their relationship changes over time. Finally, participants wrote in their 
responses without a researcher present. Though there was no space limitation to how much 
could be written, 1–1 interviews might provide richer data on the impact of childhood cancer 
on a parents’ partnership.

CONCLUSION

Specific events and partner behaviors that strengthen and/or challenge the parent’s 
relationship during the childhood cancer trajectory were identified. Psychosocial care should 
include promoting couple’s strengths along with dyadic stress management strategies. The 
data presents rich information for understanding partners’ experiences that can inform the 
development of a couples’ intervention.

Situations that strengthen the relationship

Table 2.

1. Relationship-specific issues

a. Managing stress as a 
couple

The time that comes to mind is when I received bad news about my 
daughter’s treatment. (…) I told my husband to leave me alone while we 
were staying in hospital. I cried so much he never left hospital. He knew I 
really did need him. (mother, 45 years old)
The way that my spouse has taken care of our son, making so many 
sacrifices along the way, has made my love for her increase exponentially. 
(father, 46 years old)

b. Valuing life and 
family

Right after my daughters first relapse my husband made a point of saying 
how much we wanted to make the most of life and not take life for granted. 
(mother, 29 years old)

2. Illness experience-related

a. Specific medical 
events

After the second relapse we realized this wasn’t going to be so easy and we 
really started to be a team. (mother, 36 years old)

b. Hope for a new 
treatment

Following the relapse to her lungs (…), we were told there was “nothing 
else” and to seek palliative care. We both believed we could not give up 
hope, that there was something else for her. NIH gave us both tremendous 
hope. (mother, 45 years old)

3. External supports impacting the 
relationship

a. Faith and spirituality Attending the chapel, listening to father preach. All of the time the words of 

the bible connected to our situation. (mother, 42 years old)

b. Social support

c. Child’s attitude

We are blessed to have each other and have a strong family unity and friends 
and family and neighbors to help us. (stepmother, 49 years old)

My son’s mantra is to “never say never” and he will not quit fighting the 
disease. And so, no matter what the relationship, we, as a couple, will fight 
with him until he wins or loses the war-battle by battle. (father, 57 years old)

Situations that challenge the relationship

Table 3.

Theme

Sub-Themes

Quotes

1. Relationship-specific issues

a. Self- and Partner-induced 
distance in their relationship

I would like him to understand what this is like. He downplays it all. 
When he asks me “what’s wrong”- it really bugs me. His response is 
“don’t worry about it”. There isn’t an off button. (mother, 33 years old)

b. Difficulty in recognizing 
own and partner’s emotional 
and physical needs

After the transplant, he was very anxious and stuck in obsessive thought 
patterns. He was being very negative and down at a time when we 
should have all been feeling hopeful and enjoying each other (…) I 
really had trouble dealing with his negativity and depression. (mother, 
45 years old)

c. Dealing with different 
coping styles

When I cried every day because there was no treatment to help my 
daughter and did not see my husband suffer the same way I did. (Felt 
very alone and angry). He did not express his emotions and that was 
baffling (shocking) to me.
(mother, 51 years old)

d. Difficulty making decision 
as a couple

When because of her fathers’ opinion she wanted to change the medical 
treatment we just agreed to minutes before. (father, 32 years old)

e. Trying to normalize and 
move forward

I feel the distance the most as we try to regain some normalcy in our 
lives--i.e., as we shift our 100% focus on our sick daughter to focusing 
equally on everyone in our family. (mother, 50 years old)

2. Illness experience-related

a. Physical distance

I felt most distant my first time staying at the hospital (…) I felt so far 
from home, felt so alone, felt I was on my own from that day on. I felt 
my spouse didn’t understand how I felt. We seemed very distant. 
(mother, 45 years old)
During hospital stays when I could not stay in the room with my wife 
and son. (father, 42 years old)

3. External stressors impacting 
the relationship

b. Burden of illness 
experience

Mid-treatment when my child was very ill and in ICU. I felt like I was 
carrying all of the burden to oversee care and medical decisions. 
(mother, 43 years old)

a. Stress from external events When my wife doesn’t control spending. (father, 46 years old)

b. Issues brought forth by 
child

Bedtime is hard, our child needs one of us with him now, or won’t sleep 
so we rarely sleep in the same bed. (mother, 44 years old)

Recommendations to couples whose child is diagnosed with cancer

Table 4.

Themes

Sub-Themes

Quotes

1. What to do as a 
couple

a. Communicate (share 
thoughts and feelings, laugh, 
cry)

Communication is totally key, listening and understanding your partner. (father, 39 
years old)
To hold hands, hug, cry together - don’t hide those feelings from each other. (mother, 
48 years old)

b. Stay connected as a 
couple (date and spend time 
together, physical touch and 
intimacy, be supportive and 
work together)

Allow yourself to go out and have fun - just the two of you. A grandparent can hang 
out with your child. It may be going out for just a cup of coffee the first time. Start 
small and build up. You’ll be better parents for that child if you keep your relationship 
strong. And it’s gonna help you be a better caregiver if you allow yourself a moment 
away. (mother, 45 years old)

c. Have patience and respect 
differences

Talk to each other about your stress, fears and needs. You are both going through the 
same thing although you may handle it differently. (mother, 46 years old)

d. Focus on the child

Be patient, focus on the child and making the child feel comfortable. They are very 
perceptive and even more so on treatment and they need the rock of the parents to 
anchor themselves. (father, 48 years)

2. What to do 
individually

a. Have a positive mindset

I would tell them to allow themselves to feel each emotion and recognize that they are 
all valid. I would also tell them to live in the moment. Not to get ahead of yourself, 
make each day as it comes, enjoy when your child feels good and when they’re not 
feeling good, keep in mind that it won’t last forever. (mother, 42 years old)
(…) when the good days come, soak them up and enjoy every smile!! (father, 33 years 
old)

b. Take care of yourself

Make sure that you do not get burnt out as caregivers. It is important that each parent 
get some time to his/her self. (mother, 50 years old)

c. Practice your religion

3. Utilize external 
resources

a. Get help from others 
(professional, social and 
household, meet other 
parents)

b. Patient treatment related 
(trust the team and use 
resources, share decision 
making and responsibilities, 
get educated)

Reach out away from your relationship to find strength. Then you can bring that peace 
back into the relationship. For instance, [spouse] and I pray separately. We give our 
worries to God and lean on Him. Then when we come back together, we can really be 
there for each other with a renewed strength that is not our own. (mother, 45 years old)

Get counseling. Talk to other parents facing the same issues. Build a support system, 
so many people want to help in some way. Develop a list of things that would help you 
and let people choose how they feel they can help out, i.e., meals, gas cards, 
babysitting, driving kids, going to hospital appts with you, giving you a night out, etc. 
(mother’s partner, 56 years old)

Feel comfortable with the care your child is receiving. You both have to trust your 
hospital. Our home clinic is like family. (mother, 45 years old)
