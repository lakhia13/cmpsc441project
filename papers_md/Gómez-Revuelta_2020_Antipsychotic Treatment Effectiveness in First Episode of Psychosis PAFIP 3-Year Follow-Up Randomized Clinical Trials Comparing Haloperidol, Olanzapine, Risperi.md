Abstract

Background:  Different  effectiveness  profiles  among  antipsychotics  may  be  a  key  point  to  optimize  treatment  in  patients 
suffering  a  first  episode  of  psychosis  to  impact  on  long-term  outcome. The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  compare  the  clinical 
effectiveness  of  olanzapine,  risperidone,  haloperidol,  aripiprazole,  ziprasidone,  and  quetiapine  in  the  treatment  of  first 
episode of psychosis at 3-year follow-up.
Method:  From  February  2001  to  January  2011,  2  phases  of  a  prospective,  randomized,  open-label  study  were  undertaken. 
A total of 376 first-episode drug-naïve patients were randomly assigned to olanzapine (n = 55), risperidone (n = 63), haloperidol 
(n = 56), aripiprazole (n = 78), ziprasidone (n = 62), or quetiapine (n = 62) and followed up for 3 years. The primary effectiveness 
measure  was  all  cause  of  treatment  discontinuation.  In  addition,  an  analysis  based  on  intention-to-treat  principle  was 
conducted in the analysis for clinical efficacy.
Results: The overall dropout rate at 3 years reached 20.75%. Treatment discontinuation rates were significantly different among 
treatment  groups  (olanzapine = 69.09,  risperidone = 71.43,  aripiprazole = 73.08%,  ziprasidone = 79.03%,  haloperidol = 89.28%,

Significance Statement

Despite the fact that antipsychotics are recommended for the maintenance treatment in schizophrenia, comparative long-term 
effectiveness among antipsychotics is unclear, as long-term head-to-head comparisons among SGAs are limited in clinical prac-
tice and, especially, in first-episode-psychosis. The present paper supplies evidence on the differences in terms of long-term ef-
fectiveness among 6 widely used SGAs (olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and ziprasidone). Results 
showed remarkable effectiveness, efficacy, and safety differences between the 6 antipsychotics included in the study. We distin-
guished 2 treatment groups according to their effectiveness performance: olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole presented 
clear advantages for the first-line treatment of FEP. Multiple tolerability profiles and different efficacy measures were identified 
and may lead to fit the best antipsychotic choice after FEP.

and quetiapine = 95.53%) (χ2 = 79.86; P = .000). Statistically significant differences in terms of lack of efficacy, adherence, and 
tolerability were observed among treatment groups along the 3-year follow-up, determining significant differences in time to 
all-cause discontinuation (log-rank = 92.240; P = .000). Significant differences between treatments were found in the categories 
of sleepiness/sedation, increased sleep duration, akinesia, weight gain, ejaculatory dysfunction, extrapyramidal-symptoms, 
and amenorrhea.
Conclusions: Olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole presented advantages for the first-line treatment of first episode of 
psychosis  in  terms  of  effectiveness.  Identifying  different  discontinuation  patterns  may  contribute  to  optimize  treatment 
selection  after  first  episode  of  psychosis.ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier:  NCT02526030  https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/

Introduction

Implementing  the  most  suitable  treatment  strategies  and 
making appropriate clinical decisions about individuals with a 
first episode of psychosis (FEP) is a complex and crucial task with 
relevant impact in illness outcome (Crespo-Facorro et al., 2016). 
Antipsychotics have demonstrated over the last 4 decades that 
they work both to treat acute psychotic episodes and to reduce 
relapse rates over the short to medium term (Correll et al., 2018). 
Prevention  of  recurrent  episodes  is  likely  to  be  critical  to  pre-
vent disease progression (Emsley et al., 2013; Pelayo-Terán et al., 
2017).  Relapses  involve  an  increased  risk  for  a  poorer  and  de-
layed response in the subsequent episode with higher treatment 
doses, potential side-effects emergence, and longer duration of 
active psychosis determining neurotoxicity (Pelayo-Terán et al., 
2018; Samara et al., 2015; Takeuchi et al., 2019). Nonadherence to 
medication seems to represent the highest risk for relapse after 
a FEP. Lack of efficacy, poor tolerability, and acceptability are the 
other  main  causes  that  increase  the  risk  for  discontinuation 
during early phases after a FEP. Hence, higher treatment discon-
tinuation rates are linked to higher relapse rates and a worsened 
prognosis  (Leucht  et  al.,  2013). That  is  why  FEP  first-line  anti-
psychotic choice is so critical. A recent meta-analysis focused on 
long-term patients with schizophrenia suggested that, although 
there are some significant differences in effectiveness, efficacy, 
and tolerability among second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) 
in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia due to the limited 
number of head-to-head clinical trials available so far, the com-
parative effectiveness of some SGAs is unclear (Kishimoto et al., 
2019).  Therefore,  knowledge  about  the  comparative  clinical 
characteristics of antipsychotics in the long-term treatment (in 
which the magnitude of benefits and risks of medications may 
be different from acute phase treatment) of schizophrenia is im-
portant albeit insufficient so far (Correll and Hert, 2013).

Thus, with this pool analysis, comparing head-to-head 6 anti-
psychotics widely used in routine clinical settings, we aim to add 
detailed  information  on  effectiveness,  efficacy,  and  tolerability 

outcomes  to  contribute  to  further  guide  the  evidence-based 
long-term  treatment  of  patients  with  schizophrenia  (Crespo-
Facorro et al., 2012; Gómez-Revuelta et al., 2018). This may lead 
to identify predictors of beneficial outcomes with specific anti-
psychotics, which would further enhance the ability to person-
alize treatments.

We hypothesize that differences regarding the efficacy, toler-
ability, and adherence would result in differential effectiveness 
to lead such a critical election as first antipsychotic choice may 
be for the outcome of FEP patients.

Experimental Procedures

Study Setting
Data  for  the  present  investigation  were  obtained  from  an  on-
going 3-year longitudinal intervention program of first-episode 
psychosis  called  PAFIP  (Programa  de  Atención  a  las  Fases 
Iniciales de Psicosis) conducted at the outpatient clinic and the 
inpatient unit of the University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla, 
Spain  (Pelayo-Terán  et  al.,  2008).  Conforming  to  international 
standards for research ethics, this program was approved by the 
local institutional review board. Patients meeting inclusion cri-
teria and their families provided written informed consent prior 
to their inclusion to the program.

Participants

From  February  2001  to  January  2011,  all  referrals  to  PAFIP 
were  screened  for  patients  who  met  the  following  criteria:  (1) 
15–60 years old; (2) living in the catchment area; (3) experiencing 
their first episode of psychosis; (4) no prior treatment with anti-
psychotic  medication  or,  if  previously  treated,  a  total  lifetime 
of  adequate  antipsychotic  treatment  of  less  than  6  weeks;  (5) 
DSM-IV  criteria  for  brief  psychotic  disorder,  schizophreniform 
disorder,  schizophrenia,  psychotic  disorder  not  otherwise

specified,  or  schizoaffective  disorder.  Patients  were  excluded 
for  any  of  the  following  reasons:  (1)  meeting  DSM-IV  criteria 
for drug dependence, (2) meeting DSM-IV criteria for mental re-
tardation,  (3)  having  a  history  of  neurological  disease  or  head 
injury.  The  diagnoses  were  confirmed  using  the  Structured 
Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-IV  (First  et  al.,  2002)  carried  out  by 
an experienced psychiatrist 6 months on from the baseline visit. 
Our operational definition for a “first episode of psychosis” in-
cluded  individuals  with  a  nonaffective  psychosis  (meeting  the 
inclusion  criteria  defined  above)  regardless  of  the  duration  of 
untreated psychosis.

Study Design

Patients included in this study were assigned in 2 different al-
beit consecutive phases of the PAFIP (2001–2004 and 2005–2011), 
encompassing  2  randomized,  flexible-dose,  and  open-label 
clinical  trials.  During  the  first  phase,  from  February  2001  to 
September 2005, patients were randomly assigned to treatment 
with  olanzapine,  risperidone,  or  haloperidol.  Consecutively, 
between  October  2005  and  January  2011,  patients  were  ran-
domly assigned to treatment with aripiprazole, ziprasidone, or 
quetiapine.

We  used  a  simple  randomization  procedure.  An  automated 
randomization  list  was  drawn  up.  At  study  intake,  all  patients 
but  11  (2.92%)  were  antipsychotic  naïve  (mean  duration  of  prior 
treatment = 2.75  weeks,  SD = 1.8,  range = 0.4–4.0).  Before  starting 
on the assigned drug, these participants underwent a 2- to 4-day 
washout period. Mean antipsychotic doses expressed as chlorpro-
mazine equivalents (CPZeq; mg/d) (Woods, 2003) were as follows: 
olanzapine 5–20 mg/d (100–400 CPZeq), risperidone 3–6 mg/d (150– 
300  CPZeq),  haloperidol  3–9  mg/d  (150–450  CPZeq),  quetiapine 
100–600 mg/d (133.33–800 CPZeq), ziprasidone 40–160 mg/d (66.67–
266.67  CPZeq),  and  aripiprazole  5–30  mg/d  (66,67–400  CPZeq). 
Rapid titration schedule (5 days), until optimal dose was reached, 
was used as a rule unless severe side effects occurred.

At the treating psychiatrist´s discretion, the dose and type of 
antipsychotic medication could be changed based on clinical ef-
ficacy and the profile of side effects during the follow-up period. 
Anticholinergic  medication,  lormetazepam,  and  clonazepam 
were  permitted  for  clinical  reasons.  No  anticholinergic  agents 
were administered prophylactically. Antidepressants and mood 
stabilizers  were  permitted  if  clinically  needed.  The  severity 
scale  of  the  Clinical  Global  Impression  (CGI)  scale  (Guy,  1976), 
the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (expanded version of 24 
items) (Overall and Gorham, 1962), the Scale for the Assessment 
of  Positive  symptoms  (SAPS)  (Andreasen,  1984),  the  Scale  for 
the  Assessment  of  Negative  symptoms  (SANS)  (Andreasen, 
1989),  the  Calgary  Depression  Scale  for  Schizophrenia  (CDSS) 
(Addington  et  al.,  1993),  and  the  Young  Mania  Rating  Scale 
(YMRS) (Young et al., 1978) were used to evaluate clinical symp-
tomatology. The scale of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser 
(UKU)  (Committee  of  Clinical  Trials)  (Lingjærde  et  al.,  1987), 
the  Simpson-Angus  Rating  Scale  (SARS)  (Simpson  and  Angus, 
1970), and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) (Barnes, 1989) were 
used to assess side effects. Clinical assessments and measure-
ments were completed at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 
6  months,  12  months,  18  months,  24  months,  30  months,  and 
36 months. All patients included in the analysis had at least the 
baseline and 3-year assessments, and they were considered for 
drop-out in those cases in which they did not attend 2 consecu-
tive  check-point  assessments.  The  same  trained  psychiatrist 
(B.C.-F.) completed all clinical assessments.

Outcome Measures

Primary Outcome Measures: Effectiveness
The  main  outcome  of  effectiveness  was  the  all-cause  treat-
ment discontinuation rate, which is the percentage of all-cause 
discontinuation  of  the  initially  assigned  treatment  (patients 
who completed the 3-year follow-up assessment and their ini-
tial  antipsychotic  treatment  were  switched  during  follow-up) 
and  the  mean  time  to  all-cause  medication  discontinu-
ation.  Four  reasons  for  the  discontinuation  were  recorded:  (1) 
nonsufficient or insufficient efficacy, (2) significant side effects, 
(3) nonadherence, and (4) other causes. Insufficient efficacy was 
established  at  the  treating  physician’s  judgment  only  after  at 
least  3  weeks  of  treatment.  Adherence  to  antipsychotic  drugs 
was assessed by the information obtained from patients, close 
relatives,  and  staff  (nurse,  social  worker,  and  psychiatrists)  in-
volved in the follow-up. According to previous definition (Gómez-
Revuelta et al., 2018), patients were consensually dichotomized 
into having a good (defined as patients regularly taking at least 
90% of prescribed medication) and a poor adherence (medium 
or poor compliance). If more than 1 reason for discontinuation 
was present, the most important reason according to the above 
ranking was selected.

Secondary Outcome Measures: Efficacy and Safety
The efficacy outcomes were the mean change from baseline to 
3  years  in  BPRS,  SAPS,  and  SANS  total  scores. Additional  ana-
lyses  included  changes  from  baseline  to  3  years  in  CGI, YMRS, 
and  CDSS  total  scores.  Patients  were  defined  as  responders  to 
the optimum dose of antipsychotic if they had a ≥50% reduction 
of BPRS total score and a CGI severity-score ≤4 after 6 months 
since  the  beginning  of  the  treatment.  Side  effects  were  evalu-
ated  using  the  UKU  side  effects  rating  scale.  Only  side  effects 
rated  as  moderate  or  severe  and  with  a  possible  causal  rela-
tionship  to  medication  were  recorded.  Treatment-emergent 
akathisia  and  extrapyramidal  symptoms  were  assessed  using 
BAS and SARS scales.

Statistical Analyses

All data were tested for normality (using Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test)  and  equality  of  variances  (using  Levene  test).  To  ensure 
group  comparability,  baseline  sociodemographic  and  clinical 
characteristics  were  tested  by  1-way ANOVA  or  Kruskal-Wallis 
tests for continuous variables or by chi-squared tests for quali-
tative variables.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to 
assess time to all-cause medication discontinuation. Concerning 
these 2 analyses, patients were followed-up from the inclusion 
in the study until discontinuation of the initial treatment or cen-
soring. Survival time could be censored by the end of the obser-
vation period or by lost to follow-up.

analyses 

and  per-protocol 

For  efficacy  and  safety  measures,  we  performed  both 
analyses. 
intention-to-treat 
Differences between groups in the degree of change in clinical 
scores  from  baseline  were  evaluated  with ANCOVA  after  base-
line scores were controlled. Finally, comparisons of the discon-
tinuation rates and the prevalence of side effects as well as the 
use  of  concomitant  treatment  between  the  6  antipsychotics 
were carried out, performing chi-squared tests with Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons when necessary.

STATA 15.1 was used for statistical analysis. Statistical tests 

were 2-tailed with a 95% confidence interval.

Results

Of 406 individuals who were initially randomized to treatments, 
30  were  finally  removed  from  the  dataset  after  verifying  they 
did not fully meet inclusion criteria or removed proper written 
consent during the first week. Thus, the final sample consisted 
of 376 participants who were randomly assigned to 6 different 
antipsychotic  treatments:  55  patients  were  randomly  assigned 
to the olanzapine group, 63 to the risperidone group, 56 to the 
haloperidol group, 78 patients to the aripiprazole group, 62 were 
assigned  to  the  quetiapine  group,  and  62  to  the  ziprasidone 
group  (Figure  1). The  overall  dropout  rate  at  3  years  was  small 
(n = 78;  20.74%);  46  patients  dropped  out  prior  to  treatment 
discontinuation  and  were  censored  for  the  survival  analysis 
(5-haloperidol,  9-olanzapine,  10-risperidone,  9-aripiprazole, 
8-quetiapine, and 5- ziprasidone). Our study gave the option to 
patients who were stable (symptom free for at least 12 months) 
and functionally recovered (at least 6 months under sustained 
recovery)  to  discontinue  use  of  antipsychotic  treatment  while 
continuing  to  be  followed-up  by  study  clinicians  (Mayoral-van 
Son et al., 2016). Seventeen patients entered this antipsychotic 
discontinuation  program  and  were  carefully  monitored  during 
the following 18 months after discontinuation. Sixteen of these 
17 patients completed the 3-year assessment but were censored 
for the primary outcome analysis.

Five patients committed suicide during the 3-year follow-up 
(1  olanzapine,  1  aripiprazole,  1  ziprasidone,  and  2  quetiapine) 
and there was 1 sudden death (aripiprazole; heart attack).

All but 11 individuals in the study were white Caucasian (no 
significant  differences  were  found  between  treatment  groups 
after Bonferroni correction). Instead, we found significant differ-
ences between treatment groups concerning some demographic 
variables  (living  with  parents,  single  status,  age  at  admission, 
age at FEP onset, and duration of illness), which were adjusted 
by Bonferroni correction later. Demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of patients are shown in Table 1.

Primary Outcome Measures

Treatment Discontinuation Rate and Time to Discontinuation
An impressive 79.25 % of the initial sample completed follow-up. 
Overall  treatment  discontinuation  rate  (the  cumulative  per-
centage of discontinuation considering the 6 arms of the study) 
also  reached  79.25%  by  3  years,  which  is  in  line  with  other 
medium  and  long-term  (52  weeks  or  more)  follow-up  studies 
(Lieberman  et  al.,  2005;  Kahn  et  al.,  2008a).  It  differed  signifi-
cantly  between  treatment  groups  (χ 2 = 79.860;  P = .000)  (Table  2). 
Patients on quetiapine showed a higher (95.16 %) treatment dis-
continuation rate than those on olanzapine (69.09%), risperidone 
(71.43%),  aripiprazole  (73.08  %),  ziprasidone  (79.03  %),  or  halo-
peridol (89.28%). The mean time (days) until discontinuation was 
855  days  for  olanzapine,  786  days  for  risperidone,  452  days  for 
aripiprazole, 295 days for haloperidol, 251 days for ziprasidone, 
and 60 days for quetiapine. There was a significant difference be-
tween groups (log rank = 90.240; P = .000) (see Figure 2). Log-rank 
pairwise comparisons showed no statistical differences between

risperidone group showed better adherence than those individ-
uals in the aripiprazole (χ² = 12.13; P = .001), quetiapine (χ² = 19.43; 
P = .000), and haloperidol groups (χ² = 10.59; P = .001); aripiprazole 
patients also demonstrated worse adherence than those under 
treatment  with  ziprasidone  (χ² = 8.45;  P = .003).  Mean  chlorpro-
mazine  equivalent  daily  doses  at  3  years  were:  aripiprazole 
16.3  mg = 216.8  (SD = 164.1)  CPZeq;  ziprasidone  121.3  mg = 202.2 
(SD = 136.5) CPZeq; quetiapine 195.9 mg = 261.1 (SD = 136.5) CPZeq; 
risperidone 2.9 mg = 145 (95) (SD = 136.5) CPZeq; olanzapine 8.74 
mg = 174.8 (SD = 92) CPZeq; and haloperidol 3.2 mg = 160 (SD = 60) 
CPZeq. No significant differences were observed (P = .279).

Secondary Outcome Measures

olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. However, results dif-
fered  significantly  favoring  any  antipsychotic  when  compared 
with  quetiapine:  aripiprazole  (χ 2 = 28.95;  P  <  .001),  ziprasidone 
(χ 2 = 14.29;  P  <  .001),  olanzapine  (χ 2 = 45.56;  P = .156),  haloperidol 
(χ 2 = 18.84; P  <  .001), and risperidone (χ 2 = 46.52; P  <  .001). Results 
also  highlighted  higher  effectiveness  of  risperidone  (χ 2 = 9.44; 
P = .002)  and  aripiprazole  (χ 2 = 7.657;  P = .022)  over  haloperidol. 
Olanzapine  also  took  significant  advantage  over  haloperidol 
(χ 2 = 11.23;  P = .001)  and  ziprasidone  (χ 2 = 8.81;  P = .003).  We  only 
found a trend towards nondiscontinuation favoring aripiprazole 
and  risperidone  over  ziprasidone  and  no  differences  were 
found  between  ziprasidone  and  haloperidol.  Non-  or  insuffi-
cient  efficacy  in  the  group  of  quetiapine  was  the  main  reason 
for discontinuation rate differences (χ 2 = 87.43; P = .000). Patients 
under  quetiapine  treatment  were  significantly  more  likely  to 
discontinue due to non- or insufficient efficacy compared with 
aripiprazole  (χ 2 = 32.15;  P = .000),  ziprasidone  (χ 2 = 19.35;  P = .000), 
olanzapine  (χ 2 = 39.91;  P = .000),  risperidone  (χ 2 = 41.17;  P = .000), 
or  haloperidol  patients  (χ 2 = 27.83;  P = .000).  No  significant  dif-
ferences were found between the remaining treatment groups. 
Mean (SD) doses (adjusted by chlorpromazine equivalents) prior 
to  discontinuation  due  to  non-  or  insufficient  efficacy  were 
aripiprazole-520  CPZeq  (SD = 131.7),  ziprasidone-386.5  CPZeq 
(SD = 149.5), haloperidol-351.8 CPZeq (SD = 164.9), olanzapine-510 
CPZeq  (SD = 292.4),  risperidone-550  CPZeq  (SD = 229.1),  and 
quetiapine-586.2  CPZeq  (SD = 251.1). Analysis  of  treatment  dis-
continuation  due  to  side  effects  revealed  significant  differ-
ences  between  groups  (quetiapine  12.9%,  ziprasidone  37.1%, 
risperidone  31.7%,  olanzapine  14.5%,  haloperidol  31.1%,  and 
aripiprazole 12.82 %; χ 2 = 19.800; P = .001). Patients on ziprasidone 
discontinued  treatment  due  to  side  effects  significantly  more 
frequently  than  those  on  aripiprazole  (χ² = 11.490;  P = .001), 
olanzapine (χ² = 12.400; P = .000), or quetiapine (χ² = 9.677; P = .006). 
We did not find significant differences in the direct comparisons 
between the remaining groups. Finally, there was a remarkable 
difference in terms of treatment adherence as individuals in the 

Clinical Efficacy
ANCOVA analyses showed multiple differences (Table 3) in the 
changes of the total scores of the clinical scales between treat-
ments after controlling by baseline measurements except for the 
SANS score (P = .265) and the negative dimension score (P = .314). 
Thereby,  significant  differences  on  clinical  scales  showed  CGI 
improvement: significantly larger for aripiprazole vs haloperidol 
and  ziprasidone  vs  haloperidol,  and  olanzapine;  SAPS  score: 
olanzapine  improvement  significantly  lower  compared  with 
aripiprazole  and  ziprasidone;  positive  dimension:  aripiprazole 
and ziprasidone scores were significantly lower than those pro-
ceeding from haloperidol and olanzapine patients; disorganized 
dimension: patients on aripiprazole, quetiapine, and ziprasidone 
got  significant  larger  improvements  than  olanzapine  patients; 
CDSS  score:  ziprasidone  and  quetiapine  patients  got  signifi-
cant  improvements  in  depressive  symptoms  compared  with 
haloperidol  patients;  YMRS  score:  significant  improvement 
for  aripiprazole  compared  with  olanzapine.  Per  protocol  ana-
lyses  solely  unveiled  significant  differences  concerning  CGI 
(P = .008)  and  YMRS  (P = .001)  baseline  scores.  Bonferroni  post-
hoc  analyses  showed  significantly  higher  baseline  scores  for 
aripiprazole compared with olanzapine and risperidone for both 
clinical scales (data available upon request).

Safety

Adverse Events
Intention-to-treat  analyses  of  moderate  and  severe  side  ef-
fects  that  were  frequent  (in  at  least  5%  of  patients  in  any  of 
the  treatment  groups)  are  displayed  in Table  4.  Significant  dif-
ferences  between  treatments  were  found  in  the  categories  of 
sleepiness/sedation, increased sleep duration, akinesia, weight 
gain,  ejaculatory  dysfunction,  and  amenorrhea.  After  adjust-
ment by Bonferroni correction, aripiprazole was shown to cause 
less  increased  sleep  duration  than  quetiapine  (P = .015)  and 
ziprasidone  (P = .05)  and  risperidone  was  also  less  likely  to  do 
so  than  olanzapine,  quetiapine,  haloperidol,  and  ziprasidone

(all  P < .05).  Quetiapine  was  associated  with  increased  somno-
lence  compared  with  aripiprazole  (P = .034),  but  amenorrhea 
was  significantly  less  likely  to  emerge  in  this  group  compared 
with haloperidol (P = .037) and risperidone (P = .022). Risperidone 
produced an greater frequency of ejaculatory dysfunction than 
aripiprazole  (P = .034).  Aripiprazole  patients  were  more  likely 
to  suffer  akinesia  compared  with  olanzapine  (P = .004)  and 
ziprasidone patients (P = .033). Finally, olanzapine caused a sig-
nificantly higher weight gain rate than ziprasidone (P = .001). Per-
protocol analysis showed rather similar results (data available in 
supplementary Material). In this sense, there were only 3 side-
effect categories that showed statistically significant differences 
(weight  gain,  sialorrhea,  and  ejaculatory  dysfunction).  None  of 
them resulted in statistical significance after post-hoc analyses.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms
Significant  differences  in  the  SARS  total  score  changes  at 
3 years between treatments were found (F = 13.441; P = .020). The 
percentage  of  patients  with  treatment-emergent  extrapyram-
idal  symptoms  (EPS)  was  statistically  different  between  treat-
ments (aripiprazole = 23.8%, ziprasidone = 23.5%, quetiapine 20%, 
risperidone 40%, olanzapine 30%, haloperidol 48.8%; χ 2 = 13.441; 
P = .020).  Haloperidol  supplied  a  significant  burden  of  extrapyr-
amidal side effects compared with aripiprazole, quetiapine, and 
ziprasidone (all P´s < .05) and so did risperidone compared with 
quetiapine  (P = .043).  There  was  no  significant  difference  be-
tween  treatments  in  the  severity  of  akathisia  (BAS  total  score) 
(F = 0.939; P = .456). Although the difference did not reach signifi-
cance, more individuals in the aripiprazole (22.6 %), haloperidol 
(27.7%), and ziprasidone groups (32.7 %) experienced treatment 
emergent akathisia compared with the other groups (quetiapine 
17.8  %,  olanzapine  4.7%,  and  risperidone  17.8%).  These  dif-
ferences  were  significant  for  the  UKU  scale  akathisia  item 
(χ² = 11.932; P = .036), but after Bonferroni correction only the dif-
ferences between ziprasidone and olanzapine groups remained 
significant  (P = .001).  Per  protocol  analyses  showed  no  statistic-
ally significant differences.

Concomitant Medication Use
Significant differences were found between treatment groups re-
garding the use of benzodiazepines (χ² = 21.52, P = .001), hypnotics 
(χ² = 47.76, P = .004), and anticholinergics (χ² = 43.76, P = .004). After 
adjustment by Bonferroni correction, we found that the benzo-
diazepine use in the aripiprazole group was significantly higher 
than in the quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone 
groups  (all  P < .05);  similarly,  aripiprazole,  quetiapine,  and 
ziprasidone  patients  needed  hypnotics  more  frequently  than 
olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol patients (all P < .05 ex-
cept  for  the  comparison  between  quetiapine  and  haloperidol). 
Almost  one-half  of  the  sample  required  treatment  with  anti-
cholinergics  at  any  time  of  the  follow-up.  Olanzapine  (27.27%) 
stood  out  for  being  the  treatment  group  that  least  frequently 
needed this sort of treatment (Table 5).

Discussion

Our aim with this research was to supply information from our 
experience to guide the choice of the first-line treatment for an 
FEP. Results show remarkable effectiveness, efficacy, and safety 
differences between the 6 antipsychotics included in the study. 
We distinguished 2 treatment groups according to their effect-
iveness performance, multiple tolerability profiles, and different 
efficacy measures.

Given that almost all the SGAs have reduced risk of EPS and 
tardive dyskinesia than FGAs, not all lead to important weight 
gain, and many are now available both in oral and long-acting 
intramuscular forms, treatment with an SGA would be the first 
choice in most cases (Smith et al., 2019).

Primary Outcome Measures

Treatment Discontinuation Rate and Mean Time to 
Discontinuation
Different  patterns  for  discontinuation  emerged  at  different 
phases during follow-up. This circumstance may determine dif-
ferent intensity interventions focused on efficacy, compliance, 
and tolerability adapted to each specific phase of the follow-up: 
over  one-half  of  the  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  did 
so  during  the  first  year  after  the  outbreak  (52.68%  by  the  end 
of 1 year), of whom 40.71% discontinued treatment due to lack 
of  efficacy. This  compelling  information  is  remarkable  in  that 
mean-time until all-cause discontinuation was after more than 
2  years  in  the  olanzapine  and  risperidone  groups  and  slightly 
after 1 year in the aripiprazole group. Instead, mean time until 
all-cause discontinuation appeared for patients on quetiapine 
barely reached 2 months follow-up. Mean time until all-cause 
discontinuation  occurred  after  half  a  year  follow-up  for  pa-
tients  on  haloperidol  and  ziprasidone  treatment.  Side  effects 
(36.3%)  were  the  following  cause  for  discontinuation  during 
the  first  year  of  follow-up,  while  nonadherence  (30.54%)  was 
the  main  cause  for  discontinuation  between  1-  and  3-year 
follow-up.  Concerning  the  all-cause  discontinuation  rate  and 
the  mean  time  to  discontinuation  variables,  we  may  split  the 
antipsychotic  treatments  used  for  this  research  into  2  dif-
ferent groups according to their performance on preventing pa-
tients from discontinuation due to any cause: a leading group 
composed  by  olanzapine,  risperidone,  and  aripiprazole  and 
an  underperformer  group,  including  ziprasidone,  quetiapine, 
and  haloperidol.  Therefore,  olanzapine,  risperidone,  and 
aripiprazole  proved  to  be  significantly  superior  to  quetiapine 
and  haloperidol.  Meanwhile,  though  ziprasidone  was  su-
perior  to  quetiapine  and  haloperidol  as  well,  it  was  signifi-
cantly  defeated  by  olanzapine  and  both  aripiprazole  and 
risperidone showed a trend towards superiority compared with 
ziprasidone.  There  were  no  significant  differences  between 
olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole concerning any-cause 
discontinuation risk and mean time to discontinuation, though 
olanzapine  performed  slightly  better,  especially  in  terms  of 
mean time to discontinuation, which was almost 2-fold longer 
compared with aripiprazole. Regarding these data aripiprazole 
effectiveness  approaches  that  for  other  well-stablished  ef-
fective antipsychotics have not been seen in other effectiveness 
studies (Leucht et al., 2013). Higher risk of all-cause treatment 
discontinuation  and  shorter  mean  time  to  discontinuation  in 

quetiapine  patients  had  already  been  described  during  early 
phases  of  treatment  (McEvoy  et  al.,  2007);  in  our  sample,  50% 
of patients on quetiapine discontinued treatment due to non- 
or  insufficient  efficacy.  Effectiveness  studies  using  standard 
dosage ranges pointed out that quetiapine may be less effective 
than some other widely used SGAs (Tiihonen et al., 2017) and 
FGAs (Vanasse et al., 2016). Our results are consistent with the 
notion  that  most  of  the  patients  who  start  quetiapine  stop 
taking  it  within  a  few  weeks  (Asmal  et  al.,  2013).  Inadequate 
and  transient  dopamine-2  receptor  occupancy  has  been  pro-
posed  as  a  possible  mechanism  underlying  quetiapine  lack  of 
efficacy. On the other hand, its weak dopamine antagonism al-
lows  low  maximal  occupancy  values  and  relatively  little  vari-
ability in occupancy values, suggesting that high doses of this 
antipsychotic are not likely to exceed thresholds of more than 
80% occupancy, indicative of D2-receptor–mediated side effects 
(Lako et al., 2013). This supports the idea that higher doses may 
be tolerable and more efficient (Wang et al., 2017). We did not 
find  significant  differences  between  groups  concerning  treat-
ment  dosage  adjusted  by  chlorpromazine  equivalents  prior 
to  discontinuation  due  to  non-  or  insufficient  efficacy.  The 
quetiapine  group  presented  with  the  second  highest  relative 
dosage compared with the other groups. According to other re-
ports (Tiihonen et al., 2017), it is difficult to discern whether the 
poorer  performance  of  quetiapine  is  due  to  the  product  itself 
or to nonoptimal dosage. The main reasons for discontinuation 
in the haloperidol group were nonadherence (28.57%) and side 
effects  (32.14%).  Ziprasidone  (37.1%)  and  risperidone  (31.75%) 
patients were also more likely to discontinue treatment due to 
side effects. Most discontinuations due to side effects accrued 
during  the  1-year  follow-up. This  difficulty  arose  during  anti-
psychotic  titration  in  these  groups,  explaining  why  patients 
on  ziprasidone  and  haloperidol  tolerated  lower  relative  doses 
than  the  remaining  quartet.  According  to  these  results,  EPS, 
sexual  adverse  events,  and  somnolence  (the  most  frequently 
reported secondary effects for discontinuation for risperidone, 
ziprasidone,  and  haloperidol)  seem  to  represent  the  worst 
tolerated  side  effects.  At  the  next  stage  of  follow-up  (from 
18 months on), we find an accumulation of treatment discon-
tinuation due to nonadherence basically affecting aripiprazole 
(33.3%)  and  olanzapine  (27.27%)  patients,  for  whom  this  was 
the  main  reason  for  discontinuation. The  increase  in  discon-
tinuations due to nonadherence observed during the last year 
of  follow-up  in  these  groups  might  be  explained  by  a  natural 
decrease in the acceptability mediated by long-term exposure 
to treatment (Lieberman et al., 2005). Improvements in educa-
tional  and  other  prophylactical  measures  like  the  use  of  long 
acting injectable formulations (Kishimoto et al., 2014; Jann and 
Penzak, 2018) may be of interest to deal with this preventable 
issue.

Secondary Outcome Measures

Efficacy
Our  first-episode  patients  showed  a  decrease  in  total  BPRS,  SAPS, 
SANS, and CGI scores during the 3-year follow-up. Previous studies 
using  pair-wise  meta-analytic  (Leucht  et  al.,  2009)  comparisons 
have shown that SGAs like olanzapine, risperidone, amisulpride, or 
clozapine  are  more  efficacious  than  FGAs.  Our  study  shows  clear 
advantages  for  SGAs  except  for  quetiapine  when  compared  with 
haloperidol. More recent network meta-analyses (Leucht et al., 2013) 
have been able to discern differences even between SGAs with the 
formerly mentioned SGAs leading the rankings in terms of efficacy 
for  positive  symptoms.  Curiously,  in  our  long-term  study,  we  find 
that after controlling for baseline and sociodemographic measures, 
efficacy  was  superior  for  aripiprazole  and  ziprasidone  compared 
with olanzapine for positive symptoms and CGI improvement after 
3 years. In previous short and mid-term studies involving the same 
sample,  we  did  not  find  significant  differences  by  1  year  (Crespo-
Facorro  et  al.,  2011,  2014).  Clinical  differences  for  positive  symp-
toms seem to establish from that point on. Despite that apparent 
inferior efficacy, olanzapine offered the best performance regarding 
long-term  discontinuation  due  to  non-  or  insufficient  efficacy.  It 
might be explained by the fact that most of non- or insufficient effi-
cacy discontinuations accrue during the first 6 months of follow-up. 
No differences for remission or efficacy on positive symptoms were 
found during the 1-year follow-up period in our sample, but there 
was a decreasing trend towards inferiority for quetiapine. Optimal 
efficacy  may  critically  impact  long-term  discontinuation  outcome 
during  this  early  phase.  Nevertheless,  long-term  beneficious  evo-
lution  concerning  positive  symptoms,  especially  for  aripiprazole, 
should  be  acknowledged  when  choosing  first-line  treatment  after 
FEP.  Regarding  depressive  symptoms,  quetiapine  is  acknowledged 
as  a  first-line  treatment  even  in  monotherapy  in  affective  psych-
oses  (Lindström  et  al.,  2017),  but  in  several  previous  first-episode 
nonaffective psychoses studies, no significant differences between 
SGAs  (including  quetiapine)  were  found  in  reducing  depressive 
symptoms after mid-term follow-up (Kahn et al., 2008b). No notable 
changes on negative symptoms were found with any of the 6 anti-
psychotics.  Per  protocol  analysis  did  not  show  statistically  signifi-
cant differences along follow-up.

Side Effects and Concomitant Medications
The  differences  in  the  percentage  of  patients  with  treatment-
emergent  parkinsonism  may  be  of  clinical  interest.  A  higher 
percentage of extrapyramidal side effects was identified among 
patients  treated  with  haloperidol  and  risperidone. As  reported 
in  previous  studies,  akathisia  (Juncal-Ruiz  et  al.,  2017)  repre-
sented a challenge among aripiprazole- and ziprasidone-treated 
individuals.  These  circumstances  may  partially  explain  that 
significantly  more  patients  on  aripiprazole  and  ziprasidone 
needed hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics to re-
lieve  akathisia.  In  agreement  with  previous  reports  (Lee  et  al., 
2011;  Vázquez-Bourgon  et  al.,  2018),  no  significant  differences 
were  found  in  the  frequency  of  body  weight  increase  between 
treatments  (except  for  the  comparison  between  ziprasidone 
and  olanzapine),  but  a  uniform  trend  to  weight  increase  was 
appreciated  with  all  of  them.  Intention-to-treat  analysis  re-
vealed  that  over  70%  of  the  individuals  on  olanzapine  showed 
a  rapid  body  weight  gain  (Table  4). This  should  be  regarded  as 
a  possible  limitation  for  its  first-line  use  as  it  contributes  to  a 
higher risk of metabolic issues (Smith et al., 2008). Interestingly, 
discontinuation  due  to  severe  or  intolerable  side  effects  was 
the main cause for discontinuation in our study but remained 
relatively  low  (23.14  %).  Nevertheless,  it  was  significant  in  the

case  of  ziprasidone  and  haloperidol  as  was  their  main  cause 
of  discontinuation.  Sleepiness/sedation  was  the  most  preva-
lent  reported  secondary  effect  for  discontinuation  in  the  case 
of  ziprasidone  (n = 8;  34.7%)  and  haloperidol  despite  low  doses 
prior to discontinuation due to side effects (58.5 mg [SD = 34.3] 
and 1.8 mg [SD = 1.2], respectively). In the case of risperidone, we 
distinguished  2  patterns  for  discontinuation  mediated  by  side 
effects;  during  the  acute  phase,  most  complaints  focused  on 
somnolence and EPS, while during the second half of follow-up, 
discontinuations  were  due  to  sexual  complaints  and  weight 
gain.  Olanzapine  and  quetiapine  patients  demonstrated  lower 
secondary effects rates and the lowest discontinuation rates due 
to side effects. However, they are linked with more incidence of 
metabolic  impairment  (Davy  et  al.,  2016)  and  a  higher  risk  for 
health events (Vanasse et al., 2016). Thus, their use as first-line 
treatments  should  be  considered  cautiously.  Per  protocol  ana-
lyses replicated the results for weight gain, showing a trend to-
wards significant weight gain in the olanzapine group consistent 
with  extensive  data  available  in  research  literature.  Sialorrhea 
and ejaculatory dysfunction also presented statistically signifi-
cant results under per protocol analyses, but no significant dif-
ferences were identified between treatment groups.

Limitations and Strengths

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our 
results. First, as a practical clinical trial, patients and observers 
(B.C.-F.)  were  not  blinded  to  treatments  in  our  study. The  fact 
that the observers knew the medications prescribed may have 
involuntarily  biased  the  outcomes.  As  a  non-industry–funded 
study, the risk for systematic biased measuring study outcomes 
favoring  any  of  the  treatments  is  limited.  Second,  the  mean 
doses of quetiapine used could be understood as somewhat low 
to treat first-episode individuals. However, controlled investiga-
tions have clearly confirmed that standard dosage range should 
be appropriate in everyday clinical practice (Johnsen et al., 2010). 
Optimal  doses  of  antipsychotics  within  licensed  range  were 
chosen based on clinical efficacy and the presence of side effects 
and were adjusted according to the clinical situation of each pa-
tient.  It  is  important  to  note  that  chlorpromazine  equivalents 
are a proxy measure for the comparison of antipsychotic dosage 
in  antipsychotic  effectiveness  studies.  Thus,  results  emerging 
from these comparisons should be considered cautiously. Third, 
treatment adherence measures were collected from self-report 
and close observers (family members and social assistants) but 
not from antipsychotic blood levels. This could have an impact in 
the accuracy of discontinuation measures due to nonadherence.
On  the  other  hand,  this  is  one  of  the  longest  head-to-head 
antipsychotic effectiveness studies regarding follow-up (3 years). 
It  was  performed  on  a  large  (n = 376),  well-characterized,  and 
homogeneous  sample,  as  most  of  patients  (97.08%)  were  anti-
psychotic naïve prior to their inclusion and comprised some of 
the most widely used antipsychotic treatments.

Conclusions

Establishing risks and benefits of SGA treatments and identifying 
different discontinuation patterns may contribute to make better 
treatment  selection  after  an  FEP.  In  our  research,  2  treatment 
groups were separated according to their performance: olanzapine, 
risperidone,  and  aripiprazole  presented  clear  advantages  for  the 
first-line  treatment  of  FEP  in  terms  of  effectiveness.  In  addition, 
guaranteeing  a  good  adherence  to  effective  antipsychotic  treat-
ments  is  one  of  the  priority  challenges  in  the  treatment  of  FEP

individuals to prevent a malignant course of the disease and has 
proven to be the main reason for discontinuation for the most ef-
fective  treatments.  Finally,  balancing  most  frequent  and  severe 
side effects (metabolic risk and EPS) should be considered to fit the 
antipsychotic choice to each individual case.
