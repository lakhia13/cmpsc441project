Abstract:  This  review  examines  the  impact  of  stigma  on  pregnant  people  who  use  sub-
stances. Stigma towards people who use drugs is pervasive and negatively impacts the care 
of  substance-using  people  by  characterizing  addiction  as  a  weakness  and  fostering  beliefs 
that  undermine  the  personal  resources  needed  to  access  treatment  and  recover  from  addic-
tion,  including  self-efficacy,  help  seeking  and  belief  that  they  deserve  care.  Stigma  acts  on 
multiple levels by blaming people for having a problem and then making it difficult for them 
to  get  help,  but  in  spite  of  this,  most  pregnant  people  who  use  substances  reduce  or  stop 
using when they learn they are pregnant. Language, beliefs about gender roles, and attitudes 
regarding fitness for parenting are social factors that can express and perpetuate stigma while 
facilitating punitive rather than therapeutic approaches. Because of stigmatizing attitudes that 
a person who uses substances is unfit to parent, pregnant people who use substances are at 
heightened risk of being screened  for substance use,  referred to child welfare services, and 
having their parental rights taken away; these outcomes are even more  likely for people of 
color. Various treatment options can successfully support recovery in substance-using preg-
nant populations, but treatment is underutilized in all populations including pregnant people, 
and  more  knowledge  is  needed  on  how  to  sustain  engagement  in  treatment  and  recovery 
activities. To combat stigma when working with substance-using pregnant people throughout 
the  peripartum  period,  caregivers  should  utilize  a  trauma-informed  approach  that  incorpo-
rates harm reduction and motivational interviewing with a focus on building trust, enhancing 
self-efficacy, and strengthening the personal skills and resources needed to optimize health of 
the parent-baby dyad.

Introduction
Stigma  is  a  dynamic  process  in  which  individuals  and  structures  continuously 
engage  in  exchanges  mediated  by  power,  control,  and  domination.  Stigma  can 
influence the care of people at the individual, intrapersonal, and institutional level 
and  can  vary  based  on  the  condition  that  the  stigma  is  applied.  In  the  instance  of 
substance  use  disorders  (SUD),  stigma  frames  addiction  as  a  personal  choice 
reflecting  moral  failing  and  deficiency  in  will  power  and  can  vary  by  substance. 
In this review, we will focus specifically on stigma related to substance use or SUD 
in pregnancy.1,2

Internalized stigma refers to the process in which a person using substances or 
with  a  SUD  cognitively  or  emotionally  absorbs  negative  messages  or  stereotypes 
about substance use and comes to believe them and apply them to themselves. This 
process  can  lead  to  anxiety,  isolation,  loss  of  self-love  and  facilitate  people

accepting  injustice  as  deserved  suffering.3,4  For  people 
using drugs or with SUD, this may manifest in decreased 
engagement  with  support  systems  and  avoiding  medical 
care at the detriment to their overall health and wellness.

Interpersonal stigma is the mechanism whereby stigma 
is reenacted or manifested in interactions with other people. 
This  form  of  substance-related  stigma  can  be  especially 
created  or  amplified  during  pregnancy.  Pregnant  people 
report  increased  or  even  new  judgment  and  shame  from 
those previously participatory or tolerant of their substance 
use, leading to further isolation.5 Such stigma can manifest 
even in those otherwise educated on SUD and their treat-
ability, such as health-care workers. For example, in a 2016 
national  survey,  75%  of  primary  care  physicians  were 
unwilling  to  have  a  person  with  opioid  use  disorder 
(OUD)  marry  into  the  family  and  66%  labeled  people 
with OUD as dangerous.6

Institutional stigma, whether at the level of organizations, 
communities,  or  public  policy,  is  the  process  in  which  an 
organization’s negative attitudes, beliefs, and subsequent poli-
cies negatively  effect, sometimes  invisibly,  how a  condition 
or  person  group  is  treated  in  an  establishment,  such  as 
a  workplace  or  other  institution.  Despite  increasing  accep-
tance of SUD as a medical condition rather than moral failing, 
stigma  against  people  who  use  drugs  (PWUD),  including 
pregnant  people,  remains  written  into  laws,  child  welfare 
service  policies,  and  how  we  allocate  social  services.  Such 
stigma contributes to underinvestment in addiction treatment 
infrastructure as well as the discrimination in societal support, 
such as insurance benefits, employment, and housing.2

The Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework was 
developed  by  Stangl  et  al  to  conceptualize  how  stigma  is 
operationalized  and  impacts  various  health  and  social 
outcomes.7  Figure  1  is  an  adaption  of  this  framework

specific  to  substance  use  and  pregnancy,  although  many 
types of health and societal-related stigma often intersect. 
Table 1 provides examples on how stigma can impact care 
of pregnant PWUD at each level, as per this framework.

Parents with SUD report 49% greater odds of incurring 
stigma  compared  to  non-parenting  people  with  SUD.8 
Some  authors  have  posited  that  women  who  use  drugs 
are  more  likely  than  men  who  use  drugs  to  experience 
stigma,  possibly  related  to  proscribed  gender  norms.9 
Substance use and how society treats PWUD is an exam-
ple  of  how  these  gender  norms  are  enforced  to  the  detri-
ment  of  parents.10  Being  labeled  as  an  “unfit”  parent 
comes  with  serious  consequences,  such  as  incarceration 
and  removal  of  parental  rights.11  Such  compounded  stig-
matization  results  in  pregnant  people  avoiding  substance 
use  treatment  and  perinatal  care,  ultimately  increasing 
harm to both parent and child.8,12

Women are socially assigned the roles of mother, wife, and 
caregiver,  which  is  especially  true  for  those  already  with 
children.  From  a  gender  perspective,  because  an  intoxicated 
woman is seen to be unable to fulfill her main societal roles, 
women with children who use drugs are more likely to experi-
ence stigmatization for violating this social construct.13  This 
amplified stigma towards pregnant people who use substances 
reflects  intersectionality,  a  concept  developed  by  Crenshaw 
whereby  compared  to  non-pregnant  people  who  use  sub-
stances or pregnant people without substance use, those who 
are  pregnant  are  judged  more  harshly,  and  experience  more 
discrimination, bias, and marginalization. Along the same line, 
pregnant people of color who use substances experience even 
more discrimination and marginalization due to intersection-
ality of sexism and racism.14

Language  can  have  significant  impact  on  perpetuating 
stigma towards all PWUD, particularly during pregnancy. 
The  American  Society  of  Addiction  Medicine  (ASAM), 
other  medical  journals,  and  journalists  with  expertise 
reporting  on  substance  use  and  SUD  continue  to  combat 
the  use  of  stigmatizing  and  pejorative  language  towards 
PWUD.15  For  example,  terms  like  “addict”,  “abuser”, 
“alcoholic”, “crack head”, etc. should be avoided comple-
tely and replaced with “a person with” a specific substance 
exposure or use disorder. To pregnant populations who use 
drugs, terms like “addicted baby” should be replaced with 
“baby  experiencing  substance  withdrawal.”  Precise  and 
person-centered language is not only necessary to preserve 
humanity in  our  clinical  spaces,  but it  has  been  shown  to 
reduce  the  likelihood  of  clinicians  utilizing  punitive 
approaches  towards  PWUD.16,17  Table  2  summarizes  the 
recommended  terminology  for  various  types  of  substance 
use based on the ASAM Policy Statements.15

To remain inclusive and patient-centered, we will refer 
to pregnant or birthing people to include the diverse popu-
lations  that  can  conceive  a  child  (eg,  non-binary,  gender 
non-conforming,  etc.).  Text 
that  directly  references 
women, pregnant women, or men refers to these terms as 
utilized by the research referenced. In addition, we refer to 
both chest and breast-feeding people to include all popula-
tions capable of lactation but may not identify as female or 
as having breasts.

For  the  remainder  of  this  review,  we  will  review  the 
epidemiology  of  substance  use  in  pregnancy,  review  var-
ious types and sources of  harm associated with substance 
use  in  pregnancy,  and  introduce  ways  in  which  different 
institutions  cause  or  perpetuate  stigma  as  it  relates  to 

Table 1 Example of How Each Level of Stigma Can Impact Outcomes for Pregnant Populations Using Substances

Level of 

Stigma

Example Situation*

Individual

A newly pregnant person believes they are a bad person because they use illegal substances and then delay seeking prenatal care.

Interpersonal

A newly pregnant person who uses drugs loses previously supportive friends or partners who may or may not also use drugs. 

The loss of support causes isolation, depression, and increased risk for overdose.

Organizational

A healthcare institution obtains a urine drug screen in a newly pregnant person without consent. They respond to the positive 

result by involving child welfare services but cannot provide further SUD care. As a result, the pregnant person loses trust in 

their new medical provider and is lost to further perinatal care.

Community

A substance use treatment facility does not offer a pregnant person evidence-based medications for the substance use disorder.

Public Policy

Criminalization of substance use and involvement of child welfare services in pregnancy decreases someone’s engagement in 

medical care, increasing morbidity and mortality of the substance use for the parent and child.

substance use in pregnancy. We will conclude with recom-
mendations for how healthcare can reduce stigma and the 
subsequent harms to pregnant PWUD.

Methods
To  conduct  this  narrative  review,  PubMed  and  Google 
Scholar  databases  were  searched  using  the  terms  <sub-
stance  use>  AND  [<pregnancy>  OR  <peripartum>  OR 
<perinatal>] along with <stigma>, <screening>, <crimina-
lization>,  or  <discrimination>  between  1980  and 
August  2021.  Inclusion  criteria  were  articles  in  English 
and  those  focused  on  the  forms  and  effects  of  stigma 
toward  pregnant  people  who  use  any  substance.  Articles 
that  were  not  available  in  English  or  were  not  focused 
specifically  on  pregnant  people  who  use  substances  were 
excluded from the review.

Epidemiology
Many pregnant people reduce their substance use, including 
alcohol  and  nicotine  products,  during  pregnancy.  Of  those 
who  reduce  their  use,  some  completely  abstain  from  sub-
stance use, while some continue to use substances less fre-
quently  or  in  smaller  amounts.  According  to  the  National 
Survey on  Drug Use  and  Health 2020  data report,  tobacco 
continues  to  be  the  most  widely  used  substance  reported 
during pregnancy for non-institutionalized participants ages 
15–44 years old, ranging from 14.9% of the pregnant popu-
lation  in  2015  to  9.6%  in  2019.18  Tobacco  is  followed  by 
alcohol and then substances characterized as “illicit drugs,” 
such as cannabis, opioids, and cocaine. The categorization of 
a  substance  as  “illicit”  is  an  example  of  institutionalized 

stigma,  given  that  criminalization  of  certain  substances  is 
often based on  racism or politics, not necessarily based on 
public  health  or  medical  harms.19  Of  the  illicit  drug  use 
category,  cannabis  is  by  far  the  most  widely  reported  sub-
stance used by pregnant populations, accounting for 112,000 
of  the  120,000  people  reporting  any  illicit  substance  use. 
Despite  cannabis  being  the  most  prevalent  federally  illicit 
substance used by pregnant populations, pregnant people still 
reported using significantly less cannabis than non-pregnant 
individuals in 2019 (5.4% versus 14.7%) with rates of overall 
cannabis  use  in  non-pregnant  women  rising  between  2015 
and  2019.  Past-month  opioid  use  among  pregnant  women 
has  not  changed  significantly  between  2016  and  2019  and 
past-month  cocaine  use  among  pregnant  women  remains 
low. Pregnant women who reported past-year cannabis use 
were  more  likely  to  report  other  substance  use,  including 
cocaine,  opioids,  and  alcohol.  They  were  also  more  likely 
to report suicidal ideation, major depression, and other ser-
ious mental illness. This association between substance use 
and mental health comorbidity suggests that any substance 
use reported in pregnancy, including cannabis, should be met 
with curiosity by health-care providers and prompt screening 
of  mental  health  needs,  physical  health  needs,  and  other 
forms  of  support  needed  to  reduce  substance-related  harm 
through the peri and postpartum periods.

Screening for and Monitoring 
Substance Use in Pregnancy
The rationale for screening pregnant people for substance 
use  is  that  it  may  reduce  the  potential  harms  associated 
with  substance  use  and  improve  parental  and  neonatal

outcomes.  Furthermore,  pregnancy  is  a  time  when  many 
are highly motivated for treatment.20 The potential benefits 
of  screening  must  be  weighed  against  the  potential  risks, 
including stigmatization, discrimination, legal charges, and 
the possibility of losing custody or parental rights. The act 
of  screening  for  substance  use  itself  presents  an  opportu-
nity  for  the  clinician  to  combat  stigma  by  using  person- 
centered,  non-stigmatizing  language  and  nonjudgmental 
and  compassionate  attitudes  aimed  at  identifying  and 
meeting  needs.  Yet  screening,  when  done  poorly,  can 
also  reinforce  stigma  and  leave  the  person  feeling  judged 
or blamed. Screening without a clear protocol based on the 
response can also further biases informed by racism, sex-
ism, and other forms of discrimination.

Because  of  potential  benefits  of  screening,  several 
organizations  have  issued  recommendations  regarding 
screening  pregnant  people  for  substance  use  (Table  3). 
The World  Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 
health-care  providers  ask  all  pregnant  people  about  their 
use of alcohol and other substances as early as possible in 
the pregnancy and at every antenatal visit.21 In the US, the 
Substance  Abuse 
and  Mental  Health  Services 
Administration (SAMHSA) recommends universal screen-
ing  for  substance  use  (including  alcohol),  brief  interven-
tion,  and  referral  to  treatment  (SBIRT)  as  part  of  routine 
healthcare,  including  during  pregnancy.22  The  American 
College  of  Obstetrics  and  Gynecology  (ACOG)  recom-
mends  universal  screening  with  a  validated  tool  at  the 
prenatal  visit.23  The  American  Psychiatric 
first 

Association  (APA)  recommends  screening  pregnant  and 
lactating people for substance use in a consistent and non- 
discriminating way, with or without drug testing.24 The US 
Preventive  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  recommends 
asking  all  pregnant  persons  about  tobacco  use  and 
unhealthy  alcohol  use  (see  Table  2  for  the  ASAM  defini-
tion);  USPSTF  also  recommends  screening  by  asking 
questions  about  unhealthy  drug  use  (defined  by  them  as 
the  use  of  illegal  drugs  and  the  nonmedical  use  of  pre-
scription  psychoactive  medications)  in  adults  18  years  or 
older and adolescents, including pregnant and postpartum 
persons.25–27  ASAM  issued  a  joint  policy  with  ACOG  in 
2017  calling  for  universal  verbal  screening  for  substance 
use  at  the  first  prenatal  visit  with  a  coordinated  multi-
disciplinary approach without criminal sanctions for posi-
tive screens.28

Acknowledging some of the potential harm that can be 
caused by testing for substance use during pregnancy, the 
ACOG  recommends  that  specimen  testing  be  performed 
only with the patient’s consent and that a positive test not 
be  a  deterrent  to  care,  a  disqualifier  for  coverage  under 
publicly  funded  programs,  or  the  sole  factor  in  determin-
ing  family  separation.29  An  updated  systematic  review  in 
2020 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ)  for  the  USPSTF  found  no  evidence  on  the  ben-
efits  or  harms  of  screening  versus  no  screening  for  drug 
use.30  Considering  the  widespread  recommendations  and 
use  of  screening  for  substance  use  and  the  potential  for 
harm,  more  research  is  needed  to  better  understand  the

Incorporating  verbal  questioning  from  a  health-care 
provider  during  a  clinical  encounter  to  screen  for  sub-
stance  use 
to  pregnant 
patients.31  One  study  found  that  most  pregnant  patients 
were  willing  to  honestly  disclose  their  use  of  alcohol, 
tobacco,  and  drugs  to  their  health-care  provider  when 
asked.31  Other studies have found self-report of substance 
use to be reliable when there are no negative consequences 
for  truthfully  reporting  substance  use,  such  as  refusal  of 
standard-of-care  for  medical  conditions,  legal  conse-
quences,  or  involvement  of  the  child  welfare  system.32,33 
These  findings  exemplify  how  punitive  policies  and  stig-
matizing attitudes can interfere with patient-provider com-
munication  and  lead  to  incomplete  or  inaccurate  history 
gathering.

Using screening tools can increase systematic information 
gathering while utilizing more consistent, deliberate language, 
potentially  reducing  the  impact  of  stigma  on  screening  and 
improving  the  ability  to  obtain  health  information  from 
patients.  Six  screening  instruments  have  been  validated  to 
screen for substance use in pregnancy. These include the 4Ps 
Plus/5Ps, Substance Use Risk Profile – Pregnancy, CRAFFT, 
NIDA Quick Screen, Wayne Indirect Drug Use Screener, and 
Drug Abuse Screening Tool (DAST) – 10.34–40 A study com-
pared 5 of these self-report instruments (all but the DAST – 
10) by having 1200 pregnancy women complete each of the 
questionnaires and comparing the screening results with 30- 
day calendar recall or urine analysis.37 They found that none of 
the tools had both high sensitivity and high specificity, and the 
area under the curve was low for nearly all measures, suggest-
ing low accuracy.

Urine, blood, sweat, amniotic fluid, breath, oral fluids, 
and hair specimens from the pregnant person can be tested 
during  pregnancy  and  at  delivery  to  assess  for  substance 
use  and  neonatal  substance  exposure.  In  the  neonate, 
meconium  is  the  most  analyzed  matrix  but  urine,  hair, 
blood,  umbilical  cord  tissues,  and  placenta  can  also  be 
analyzed  for  the  presence  of  substances.41  When  used, 
the role of specimen testing should be to monitor treatment 
goals, and positive testing should prompt treatment imple-
mentation  or  adjustment  rather  than  discharge  or  punish-
ment. Specimen testing performed only at delivery misses 
the opportunity to establish treatment and recovery during 
pregnancy  and  too  often  is  used  to  justify  removing  the 
newborn from the parent’s custody and care. This punitive 
approach  fails  to  optimize  chances  for  treatment  and 

recovery, is based on stigma (eg, the belief that treatment 
does  not  work,  or  the  person  is  not  worthy  of  treatment), 
and reinforces stigma (eg, the belief that if the person has 
continued to use substances during pregnancy, they are not 
worthy of being a parent).

Over the past 30 years, the benefits and risks of universal 
screening for substance use in pregnancy have been debated 
in the literature.  Potentially  desirable consequences  of uni-
versal  screening  may  include  improved  initiation  of  SUD 
treatment  and  recovery  support  services,  and  possibly 
improved  neonatal  and  maternal  outcomes.  Advocates  for 
universal screening argue that it provides equitable surveil-
lance, so provider biases, stigma, and other discriminations 
do  not  cause  some  populations  to  be  disproportionately 
screened, and thus disproportionately impacted by the con-
sequences of positive screens. Standardized (but not neces-
sarily  universal)  screening  protocols  use  specific  patient 
characteristics  to  determine  who  is  at  risk  for  substance 
use  during  pregnancy  and  selectively  screen  those  who 
have  been  deemed  “high  risk.”  Yet,  these  characteristics 
are  usually  biased  towards  people  of  color,  those  living  in 
poverty, and those from non-traditional households. Roberts 
et  al  compared  child  welfare  system  (CWS)  referrals  over 
3.5 years at 2 hospitals, one that implemented a protocol and 
one that  did  not. During  the  study period, the  protocolized 
hospital referred 5 times more Black families to CWS than 
white  families  and  did  not  reduce  disparities  in  CWS 
referrals.42  This further illustrates the impact of intersecting 
stigma, such as substance use and race.

Regardless of risk-benefit analysis regarding screening 
for substance use in pregnancy, most pregnant people who 
receive prenatal care in the US are screened for substance 
use.  A  recent  analysis  found  variability  in  prenatal  sub-
stance  use  screening  from  state  to  state,  but  overall,  95% 
of  pregnant  women  in  the  US  were  asked  about  alcohol 
and tobacco use during prenatal care, and 80% were asked 
about  drug  use.43  The  same  report  noted  that  states  with 
laws  that  criminalize  prenatal  drug  use  as  child  abuse  or 
neglect  have  lower  rates  of  screening,  while  states  that 
mandate  screening  for  prenatal  substance  use  had  higher 
rates  of  screening.  This  illustrates  a  double-edge  sword: 
screening  for  drug  use  where  criminal  penalties  exist  for 
a  positive  screen  making  it  less  likely  screening  occurs, 
thereby reducing potential criminal penalties. This reduced 
screening  also  means  that  individuals  who  may  benefit 
from  more  support  or  evidence-based  treatments  for  pos-
sible  SUD  may  stay  unrecognized  due  to  the  stigma  in 
less 
public  policy.  Individuals  who  were  younger,

educated,  unmarried,  Black,  non-Hispanic,  publicly 
insured,  had  a  history  of  smoking  before  pregnancy,  or 
received  inadequate  prenatal  care  were  more  likely  to  be 
screened for one or more substances.

Stigma  impacts  how  and  when  health-care  providers 
(HCP)  screen  pregnant  patients  for  substance  use.  Some 
lack  skills  or  a  process  for  screening  and  are  concerned 
that  asking  about  substance  use  may  interfere  with  the 
patient–provider  relationship.  In  addition,  HCP  may  have 
their own biases about substance use and/or race and lack 
trust  that  the  patient  will  provide  accurate  and  honest 
information about their substance use.44

From  a  pregnant  person’s  standpoint,  potential  adverse 
consequences  of  universal  screening  include  involvement 
with  CWS;  receiving  a  stigmatizing  label  while  navigating 
the healthcare system during pregnancy; risk of being charged 
with a crime; and the rational fear of having children removed 
or  losing  custody.  Fear  of  screening  for  substance  use  in 
pregnancy, or fear of consequences due to a positive screen, 
have  been  reported  anecdotally  as  reasons  pregnant  people 
may  delay  seeking  prenatal  care  or  avoid  prenatal  care 
altogether.

Such fear that positive substance use screening in preg-
nancy will have legal consequences is well-founded. In the 
US,  substance  use  during  pregnancy  is  considered  child 
abuse under civil child welfare statutes in 23 states and the 
District  of  Columbia.  Three  states  consider  substance  use 
during  pregnancy  as  grounds  for  civil  commitment.45  In  8 
states,  health-care  professionals  are  required  by  law  to  test 
for prenatal drug exposure if they suspect drug use, and 25 
states plus the District of Columbia require health-care pro-
fessionals  to  report  suspected  prenatal  drug  use.45  Some 
states do not limit reporting requirements to illicit substance 
use and include alcohol use during pregnancy as reportable. 
Testing results can be used as evidence in child welfare and 
legal proceedings, meaning that current state policies make 
the healthcare system a potential “entry point” for pregnant 
people  using  substances  into  the  carceral  and  CWS.46 
Policies  directing  institutions  to  manage  suspected  or  con-
firmed substance use in pregnancy as justification to report 
or  deliver  a  patient  to  law  enforcement  effectively  divorce 
treatment of SUD from health care.47 Ultimately, criminaliz-
ing  substance  use  in  pregnancy  is  counterproductive,  as 
rather  than  improving  outcomes  for  pregnancy  and  new-
borns,  criminalization  is  associated  with  less  prenatal  care 
and  increased  rates  of  neonatal  withdrawal  syndromes.48 
Furthermore, laws criminalizing substance use in pregnancy 
disproportionately impact people of color, people with less 

access  to  SUD  treatment,  and  people  with  less  access  to 
economic resources.47

Universal  screening  for  substance  use  in  pregnancy  is 
associated with increased disparities; it does not address asso-
ciated risks of stigma, criminalization, and discrimination and 
it does not address the broader social and economic contexts 
in which pregnant people use substances.47  Due to these and 
other  adverse  effects  described  above,  we  cannot  support 
universal screening of pregnant people for substance use.

Substance Use Impact on 
Pregnancy Outcomes
The  impact of substance  use  on  a  pregnant  person and  the 
fetus  varies  based  on  multiple  variables,  including  but  not 
limited to dose, timing of use, route of use, and the source of 
the  drug  supply.  For  example,  fetal  alcohol  spectrum  dis-
order (FASD) has been associated with intrauterine exposure 
to alcohol, likely associated with dosing exposure, but it is 
unclear  how  much  alcohol  exposure  ultimately  contributes 
to FASD. In terms of timing, substances can have variable 
impact on pregnancy outcomes based on when during gesta-
tion  they  are  utilized.  Medical  consequences  of  substance 
use, regardless of pregnancy status, can also vary by route of 
use.  Stigma  can  limit  someone’s  ability  to  transition  to  an 
alternative  route  safely,  as  they  may  be  unsure  where  to 
access information or be experiencing new isolation due to 
new  interpersonal  stigma  related  to  substance  use  in  preg-
nancy (see above). Table 4 is a summary of different medical 
sequela of substance use based on route.

Much of the unintentional medical harm that can come 
from substance use with or without pregnancy is secondary 
to  a  rapidly  changing,  contaminated,  and  unregulated  drug 
supply. Since 2013, deaths secondary to fentanyl and other 
synthetic  opioid  exposures  have  outnumbered  those  from 
prescription  opioids  and  heroin.49  Much  of  this  synthetic 
opioid exposure is not known to the substance-using popula-
tion,  who  may  rely  on  harm  reduction  organizations  and 
community  drug  testing  to  determine  its  presence.50  New 
contaminants,  such  as  xylazine  and  designer  benzodiaze-
pines, are also increasing the rate of substance-related deaths. 
Stigma  against  PWUD  limits  policy  changes  that  would 
greatly  ameliorate  these  harms,  such  as  decriminalization 
and  legalization  of  all  substances,  universal  drug  testing, 
and  availability  of  safe  consumption  sites.  Places,  such  as 
Portugal, that have decriminalized all personal use of drugs 
have  seen  significant  reductions  in  drug-related  deaths  and 
decreased transmission of HIV related to drug use.51

Potential  harm  to  the  fetus  includes  both  exposure  to 
a contaminated substance as well as subsequent withdrawal 
from  a  substance  at  birth.  The  number  of  infants  born  to 
parents  with  OUD  more  than  doubled  between  1998  and 
2011.52  Neonatal  withdrawal 
is 
a collection of physiological and neurobehavioral signs and 
symptoms  associated  with  the  removal  of  a  substance  that 
a  newborn  had  been  consistently  exposed  to  in  utero.22 
Approximately  50–80%  of  infants  exposed  to  persistent 
opioids  in  utero  will  develop  neonatal  opioid  withdrawal 
syndromes  (NOWS)  with  higher  rates  reported  in  rural 
regions.53 In utero exposure to amphetamines has been asso-
ciated with increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, 
and small for gestational age.54 NWS is still often referred to 
as neonatal abstinence syndrome, but the inclusion of absti-
nence perpetuates stigma and decreases the medical perspec-
tive  of  the  condition.  Based  on  the  Oxford  English 
Dictionary,  abstinence  is  defined  as  “sense  relating  to  self- 
restraint  or  forbearance”  or  “the  practice  or  discipline  of 
resisting self-indulgence; self-restraint.” Such a term cannot 
be applied to a newborn infant unable to attend to its basic 
needs and its use further perpetuates the morality our society 
associates with substance use.55  While the stigma of NWS 
may be unique to a certain type or category of substance, it is 
important to remember that consistent in utero exposure to 
many different medications can also result in a withdrawal 
syndrome at birth, such as anti-depressants and anxiolytics; 
yet,  these  withdrawal  syndromes  do  not  carry  the  same 
stigma or legal and social consequences.

Studies that seek to clarify any effect substance use and/ 
or medications  utilized  to  treat SUD  have  on  offspring  are 
often complicated by significant confounding variables, such 

as tobacco use and other environmental exposures.56,57  For 
example,  a  systematic  review  published  by  Lee  et  al  con-
cluded that children born to opioid-dependent mothers  had 
worse  neurodevelopmental outcomes  compared to  children 
born to non-opioid dependent mothers, but note that potential 
confounders  such  as  other  substance  use,  tobacco  use,  and 
prematurity were not accounted for and could also influence 
these  outcomes.58  Another  systematic  review  investigating 
the risk of congenital anomalies and other adverse effects in 
substance-exposed children concluded that although drug use 
during pregnancy may increase these risks, many confoun-
ders exist when evaluating substance-using populations and 
cannot be discounted.59 Research should continue to explore 
such impacts, but it is prudent for clinicians to communicate 
such  limitations  to  patients  and  other  health-care  profes-
sionals when discussing potential treatment options or harm 
reduction interventions.

Drug-related deaths remain a common cause of parental 
mortality. In a retrospective, population-based cohort study 
following over 1 million women in California between 2010 
and 2012, a total of 300 women died (rate 28.33 deaths per 
100,000-person  year)  and  drug-related  deaths  were 
the  second  lead  cause  of  death  (3.68  per  100,000  person 
years).  Drug-related  deaths  plus  deaths  by  suicide  in  this 
population accounted for 18% of the total maternal mortality 
in this study.60 In a 2017 report from nine maternal mortality 
review committees, mental health and SUD were linked to 
12.9% and 8.2% of pregnancy-related deaths, respectively.61 
Given the individual, interpersonal, and institutional stigma 
against  both  substance  use  and  mental  illness,  addressing 
such stigma may reduce barriers and the subsequent morbid-
ity and mortality related to such conditions.

The impacts of stigma regarding substance use and the 
peripartum time can extend past the initial patient or child 
into  how  we  socially  support  different  conditions.  For 
example,  mothers  of  children  born  with  FASD  have  been 
rated  as  more  different,  more  prone  to  disdain,  and  more 
responsible  for  the  condition  compared  to  mothers  with 
serious  mental  illness,  SUD,  or  jail  experience.  Using 
a fictional budget allocation task as a proxy of discrimina-
tion,  this  resulted  in  significantly  lower  budget  allocation 
towards FASD service programs compared to other service 
programs.62 This stigma is encapsulated heavily into many 
policies under the War on Drugs in the US, which promote 
criminalization of substance use rather than addressing the 
medical and public health needs for this population.

In  the  US,  the  federal  Child  Abuse  Prevention  and 
Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires state policies mandating 
when  CWS  should  be  notified  and  includes  infants  born 
“substance-affected,”  but  does  not  further  define  how  or 
when  this  should  be  applied.63  State  laws  subsequently 
vary  on  how  CWS  monitors  or  requires  people  to  report 
on people with peripartum substance use. Even within the 
same state, health-care institutions may also have variable 
policies on screening  for and reporting any substance use 
in  the  peripartum  period.  As  such,  many  health-care  pro-
fessionals  and  hospital-based  social  workers  are  poorly 
informed about their role. The process in which substance 
use  may  be  suspected  or  identified  in  pregnancy  may 
include  pregnant  people  obtaining  medications  for  addic-
tion treatment (such as buprenorphine), from substance use 
history included in the medical record, from a non-medical 
record of substance use (such as a state-based prescription 
monitoring  program),  or  positive  and  sometimes  coer-
cively  obtained  drug  testing.  The  lack  of  clarification  in 
the  term  “substance-affected”  may  mean  that  pregnant 
populations  in  recovery  using  opioid  agonist  treatment 
are  at  risk  of  being  reported  to  CWS,  disincentivizing 
people  from  actively  seeking  evidence-based  treatment 
for  OUD.  Many  of  the  decisions  made  by  participants  in 
the  reporting  process  are  largely  up  to  the  individual, 
which  tends  to  protect  those  with  the  most  privilege. 
People of color, poor people, unhoused, or those with non- 
traditional  family  structures  are  most  likely  to  be  scruti-
nized with interviews, drug testing, reports filed, and ulti-
loss  of  custody.57  Confusion  about 
mately 
legal 
obligations and stigma against historically excluded popu-
lations  lead  many  health-care  professionals  to  default  to 
a  role  of  policing,  which  undermines  the  confidentiality 
and trust that remains at the core of an effective and ethical 

patient–provider relationship. Such a conflict is addressed 
in a 2020 policy statement by ACOG entitled “Opposition 
to  Criminalization  or  Individuals  During  Pregnancy  and 
the  Postpartum  Period,”  which  advocates  for  improving 
access to treatment for SUD rather than focusing on puni-
tive  measures  carried  out  by  the  criminal  legal  system, 
including  CWS.64  This  statement  advocates  against  laws, 
policies, or practices that test individuals and newborns for 
substances without consent. In this policy, ACOG opposes 
mandated  or  required  drug  testing,  especially  without 
informed  consent,  and  advocates  for  practitioners  to  rely 
on  self-reported  screening  and  history  only.  This  policy 
notes  that  lack  of  uniform  (and  we  would  add  clear) 
policies  about  screening,  testing,  and  reporting  substance 
use  encourages  reliance  on  biases  and  racism  as  an  entry 
way into the CWS. Harms to the parent–child dyad caused 
by  involvement  in  the  CWS,  such  as  an  increase  in  par-
ental  substance  use,  trauma,  and  worse  health  outcomes 
for children, are often not weighed against potential harm 
of  parental  substance  use.65  The  CWS  often  defaults  to 
separation  rather  than  focusing  financial,  medical,  and 
societal resources into supporting the family.

Almost  half  of  US  states  have  laws  that  criminalize 
substance use during pregnancy as a form of child abuse or 
as  grounds  for  civil  commitment.45  According  to  an  ana-
lysis  of  cases  by  Angelotta,  these  laws  are  closely  linked 
to  legislative  and  judicial  attempts  to  treat  fetuses  as  leg-
ally separate  persons,  often  at the  expense  of  recognizing 
the individual rights of the pregnant person.66  At the same 
time, many pregnant people who have a SUD lack access 
to  SUD  treatment  due  to  multiple  factors  including 
absence  of  a  treatment  program  in  their  community,  their 
insurance  does not cover  SUD  treatment, stigma  and  fear 
of  reprisal  if  they  disclose  substance  use,  and  lack  of 
awareness of treatment availability or treatment effective-
ness.  Several  studies  have  found  that  laws  criminalizing 
substance  use  in  pregnancy  do  not  achieve  intended  out-
comes  (reduced  substance  use  in  pregnancy  and  reduced 
neonatal withdrawal syndromes) but rather people delay or 
avoid  seeking  prenatal  care  and  substance  use  treatment 
altogether, due to fear of punishment such as involvement 
with  CWS,  loss  or  parental  rights,  or  incarceration.  The 
American  Civil  Liberties  Union  calls  these  laws  “bad 
medicine and bad policy”.67,68

Because  there  is  no  unified  dataset  that  collects  infor-
mation  on  the  number  of  pregnant  people  who  use  sub-
stances  and  are  incarcerated  in  federal  or  state  prisons  in 
the  US,  it  is  unknown  how  many  pregnant  people  are

incarcerated annually due to substance  use.69  A report by 
Amnesty  International  estimated  between  500  and  1000 
pregnant people were incarcerated in prison  in the US on 
charges  of  child  abuse  or  endangerment  related  to  sub-
stance use since 2014.70  Likely many more pregnant peo-
ple are under surveillance through probation, parole, drug 
courts,  and  other  community-based  corrections  programs. 
Furthermore,  while  the  Eighth  Amendment  guarantees 
incarcerated individuals access to health care such as pre-
natal  care,  incarceration  does  not  necessarily  guarantee 
access  to  SUD  treatment.67  Even  after  they  are  released 
from 
incarceration,  simply  having  been  incarcerated 
inflicts  its  own  stigma  and  loss  of  liberties,  rendering 
them,  according  to  Michelle  Alexander  (The  New  Jim 
Crow,  2010),  a  second-class  citizen,  where  they  cannot 
vote and it is legal to discriminate against them in housing, 
employment,  food  assistance,  and  other  fundamental  ser-
vices. These injustices adversely impact the parent, child, 
and family  thus  continuing a  cycle of  stigma, discrimina-
tion, and disparities that passes from one generation to the 
next.47,65,71

Treatment of SUD in Pregnancy
It has been estimated that between 1992 and 2012, only 4% 
of pregnant people were admitted to substance use treatment 
programs.  These  people  were  more  likely  to  identify  as 
white,  be  older  reproductive  age,  be  college-educated,  and 
have  health  insurance.72  In  a  recent  qualitative  study  by 
Phillippi et al, trained female callers contacting providers of 
medications for OUD (MOUD) over a 10-state area were less 
likely to secure an appointment if they were pregnant and had 
state-funded insurance.73  In many cases, callers stating they 
were pregnant were informed that the program only treated 
non-pregnant  populations.  In  a  similar  qualitative  study, 
trained callers who were pregnant were less likely to secure 
an appointment with a buprenorphine provider compared to 
non-pregnant  callers  and  over  25%  of  buprenorphine  and 
methadone  providers  only  scheduling  callers  for  intake 
after the caller agreed to pay by cash, rather than accepting 
insurance.74

Accessibility  to  different  treatment  programs  that  can 
accommodate  an  active  pregnancy  and  other  childcare  is 
variable.  For  example,  per  JACHO  and  SAMHSA  guide-
lines, the status as a pregnant person allows those seeking 
methadone  to  bypass  days  to  week-long  waits  to  initiate 
treatment. In one qualitative study published by Stone, this 
policy  was  met  positively  and  contributed  to  participants 
enthusiastically  with  methadone 
engaging  more 

programming.12  Yet, postpartum, many of these same par-
ticipants  interested  in  methadone  treatment  will  again 
navigate  long  opioid  treatment  program  (OTP)  wait 
times.  Outside  of  opioid  treatment  programming,  active 
pregnancy  or  the  need  to  provide  childcare  services 
while  in treatment drastically  decreases  access  to  care.  In 
the  same  qualitative  study  by  Stone,  pregnant  people 
described  only  1  treatment  facility  within  a  100-mile 
radius of the study site that admitted pregnant participants 
or participants that would require childcare on site. Access 
to pregnancy and child-friendly residential programming is 
limited  by  many  factors,  including  but  not  limited  to: 
qualified support staff, legal responsibilities, medical sup-
port  and/or available  relationships with provides  who can 
provide  obstetric  care,  and  cost.  Yet,  providing  essential 
services  to  pregnant  or  parenting  participants  in  a  secure 
environment  cannot  be  overstated.  Residential  program-
ming for actively pregnant or parenting adults with child-
care  onsite  is  an  opportunity  to  support  recovery  from 
SUD  while  building  communication  and  parenting  skills 
in  real-time,  with  the  support  and  supervision  of  trained 
staff.  Such  community  supports  can  help  lessen  interge-
nerational  trauma,  create  resiliency  for  participants  enter-
ing  a  new  phase  of  recovery  with  children  (possibly 
infants),  and  support  the  health  of  active  pregnancies, 
improving  outcomes  for  both  parent  and  child.  Prenatal 
care in people using drugs can reduce the risk for prema-
turity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age out-
comes and should be initiated as early as possible.75

Efforts should be made to increase access to substance 
use  treatment  programs  that  include  on-site  pregnancy, 
parenting,  and  child-related  services,  as  these  have  been

A  systematic  review  of  substance  use  treatment  and  HIV 
prevention programs focused on pregnant populations has 
shown that not only are such programs cost-effective, but 
even cost-saving. Area of cost-savings included decreased 
cost on neonatal intensive care service, shorter hospitaliza-
tion  for  the  parent-infant  dyad,  and  decreased  costs  that 
may be related to involvement in the carceral system.77

approved  for  alcohol,  opioid,  and  tobacco/nicotine  use

buprenorphine  compared  to  methadone  in  pregnancy  was 
associated with a lower risk of preterm birth, greater birth 
weight,  and  larger  head  circumference  with  no  greater 
harm  of  buprenorphine  to  parent  or  baby.81  A  2020 
Cochrane  Review  concluded  that  methadone  and  bupre-
norphine  are  likely  similar  in  efficacy  and  safety  in  the 
treatment  of  OUD  for  pregnant  patients  and  babies  but 
noted  that  adequately  powered  randomized  controlled 
trials  to  compare  different  treatments  limits  the  strength 
of this conclusion.82  Many studies evaluating child neuro-
development  outcomes  in  methadone  or  buprenorphine- 
exposed pregnancies are limited by poor control selection, 
as often the unexposed control group comparison does not 
include parents with the underlying disease for  which the 
medication  is  being  utilized  (eg,  OUD).83  Naltrexone 
remains  poorly  studied  when  utilized  for  OUD.  In 
a  retrospective  cohort  study  from  Australia,  which  com-
pared  obstetric  outcomes  in  pregnant  people  treated  with 
naltrexone  implant  versus  oral  methadone  versus  sublin-
gual  buprenorphine,  naltrexone  had  a  significant  increase 
in  birth  rate  compared  to  opioid  agonist  treatment  and 
control  with  a  similar  rate  of  complication  as  compared 
to methadone and buprenorphine treatment groups.84

Research  on  the  treatment  of  alcohol  use  disorders 
(AUD) with withdrawal and maintenance medications dur-
ing  pregnancy  is  limited.  Medications  for  alcohol  with-
drawal  typically  consist  of  a  benzodiazepine  to  prevent 
seizures and decrease discomfort associated with withdra-
wal symptoms. Current medications for AUD maintenance 
therapy,  such  as  naltrexone,  acamprosate,  and  disulfiram 

have  been  used  to  help  prevent  alcohol  consumption. 
Babies  exposed  to  alcohol  in  utero  are  at  an  increased 
risk  of  fetal  alcohol  spectrum  disorder  (FASD).  While 
not  all  infants  exposed  to  alcohol  during  pregnancy  will 
develop  FASD,  no  safe  consumption  amount  of  alcohol 
has  been  identified.84  The  2019  World  Federation  of 
Societies  of  Biological  Psychiatry 
(WFSBP)  and 
International  Association  for  Women’s  Mental  Health 
guidelines do not currently recommend any pharmacologic 
therapy  for  AUD  maintenance  therapy.85  However,  these 
guidelines  and  the  WHO  recommend  benzodiazepines  in 
cases  of  alcohol  withdrawal  to  prevent  possible  negative 
effects  on the parent  and  fetus,  potentially in an  inpatient 
facility to monitor the parent and fetus.21

Evidence  on  the  benefits  and  risks  of  FDA-approved 
medications  for  tobacco  and  nicotine  use  disorders  (nico-
tine  replacement  therapy  (NRT),  bupropion,  and  vareni-
cline) are limited. Although pharmacotherapy such as NRT 
is  associated  with  improved  quit  rates  at  6  months  or 
longer  compared  to  minimal  support  or  no  intervention, 
there  is  limited  evidence  on  effects  of  NRT  in  pregnant 
populations  compared  to  placebo.86  Behavioral  interven-
tions  have  been  shown  to  improve  cessation  rates  in  late 
pregnancy  with  minimal  adverse  effects.87  Five  large 
cohort  studies  compared  stillbirth,  birth  outcomes,  and 
congenital  anomalies  in  infants  exposed  to  NRT,  bupro-
pion, varenicline, or ongoing tobacco/nicotine and did not 
find significant differences.86

The WHO currently does not recommend any pharma-
cological  treatment  for  stimulant  use  disorders  in  those 
who  are  pregnant.21  In  conjunction,  there  are  currently 
no  FDA-approved  medications  for  stimulant  use  disorder 
overall.  The  WHO  does  recommend  cognitive  behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and contingency management for stimulant 
use disorders in pregnant patients.

Stigma  contributes  to  low  rates  of  prescribing  evi-

a  study  of  veterans  with  OUD,  identifying  as  Black  and/ 
or  living  in  a  rural  community  were  associated  with 
decreased  odds  of  receiving  medications  for  OUD.88 
Between  1996  and  2014,  admissions  for  pregnant  people 
with  OUD  increased  from  16.9%  to  41.6%  based  on  the 
Treatment  Episode  Data  Set-Admissions  (TEDS-A)  data-
base, but the proportion receiving MOUD remained stable 
at  50%.  In  this  cohort,  being  white,  older,  self-referred, 
outpatient, and without psychiatric comorbidity was asso-
ciated  with  an  increased  rate  of  MOUD.89  Pregnancy

otherwise  knowledgeable  may  be  less  comfortable  and/or 
willing  to  utilize  such  pharmacotherapy  in  pregnancy, 
given  the  weak  evidence  base.  In  addition,  seeking  treat-
ment in an office setting for SUD in pregnancy is reduced 
by  the  morality  placed  on  substance  use  in  pregnancy  as 
well as legal/societal consequences.

Trauma-Informed Care for 
Substance Use in Pregnancy
Given the high prevalence of trauma and neglect in popu-
lations  with  SUD,  including  pregnant  populations,  incor-
porating 
into  health-care 
to  seeking  care.  In 
systems  may  decrease  barriers 
a  review  of  23  qualitative  studies  describing  health-care 
encounters of pregnant and postpartum women with SUD, 
the  majority  were  labeled  as  “conflictual,”  further  differ-
entiated  as  either  judgmental,  disparaging,  scrutinizing, 
disempowering,  or  deficient  in  care.  In  contrast,  encoun-
ters  that  were  supportive  were  described  as  recovery- 
in  care.90  Although 
based,  accepting,  and  effective 
a  broad  review  of  creating  and  implementing  a  trauma- 
informed  practice  is  outside  the  scope  of  this  review, 
general principles  can  start small. For  example,  recogniz-
ing  that  many  behaviors  observed  in  people  with  SUD 
have been cultivated as ways to deal with past and current 
negative  experiences.  For  many,  these  behaviors  have 
allowed  them  to  survive.  Yet,  many  of  these  observed 
behaviors  serve  as  drivers  and  facilitators  of  stigma,  per-
petuating the  image  of  PWUD  as  difficult,  selfish,  or  bad 
patients. In  recognizing the foundation of these behaviors 
in  others,  health-care  providers  must  also  recognize  what 
they  bring  to  an  encounter  and  how  these  conscious  and 
unconscious  feelings  may  manifest 
their  verbal 
responses, nonverbal responses, and treatment recommen-
dations.  Providing  trauma-informed  care  should  never 
require  disclosure  of  details  from  participants,  especially 
if  such  systems  do  not  have  the  personnel  or  expertise  to 
manage  such  disclosures.  Providing  choices  through  each 
step  of  care  provides  more  control  to  participants  and 
increases engagement.

Reducing Substance-Related Harms 
in Pregnant Populations
History of substance use, mental health struggles, and the 
experience  of  interpersonal  violence  is  associated  with 
lower  quality  of  life  for  pregnant  populations  and  the 
presence of such factors should prompt aggressive support 

from institutions that interact with pregnant populations.91 
Instead of acting on institutional and medical policies that 
increase  stigma  and  harms  towards  pregnant  people  who 
use substances, we recommend incorporating management 
and  treatment practices  centered in  collaboration,  respect, 
acceptance,  empowerment,  and  compassion  that  can 
reduce  harms  while  increasing  patient  efficacy.  Just  as 
with  other  populations  who  use  drugs,  harm  reduction  in 
the  peripartum  population  has  been  shown  to  improve 
health outcomes. Patient engagement and retention in pre-
natal  services  increases.  Health  outcomes  for  infants 
improve,  specifically  resulting  in  fewer  preterm  and  low- 
weight  births  which  also  increases  the  likelihood  that 
infants are discharged home with mother. Harm reduction 
principles have also been shown to increase breastfeeding 
rates and facilitate early attachment and healthy childhood 
development.57

In addition to medical care, many behavioral strategies 
can  be  utilized  to  promote  wellness  and  reduce  harm  in 
pregnant  populations  using  substances.  For  example, 
action planning, utilization of written materials, supported 
problem-solving,  and  other  motivational  interviewing 
techniques  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  at  reducing 
alcohol  and  substance  use  during  pregnancy.92  Low  to 
moderate  quality  evidence  has  not  consistently  shown 
a  difference  in  outcomes  comparing  different  types  of 
psychosocial treatment modalities, assuming that all these 
modalities were provided in the presence of other compre-
hensive  care  options,  such  as  pharmacological  treatment 
(such as methadone), mental health counseling, transporta-
tion,  and  childcare.93  This  emphasizes  the  overall  point 
that  any  method  of  identifying  substance  use  in  the  peri 
and postpartum period requires protocols and resources to 
exist  for  the  support  and  treatment  of  those  with  SUD.  It 
has been this lack of widely available resources which has 
resulted  in  recommendations  against  universal  screening 
of  non-alcohol,  non-nicotine  related  substance  use  when 
further referral services are not identified.26

Peripartum
Regardless of substance use history, an estimated 17.3% of 
pregnant persons report experiencing mistreatment, includ-
ing  but  not  limited  to  verbal  and  physical  abuse,  loss  of 
autonomy, discrimination, and failure of providers to meet 
standards of care. This risk of maltreatment is even greater 
for  people  of  color  and  low  socioeconomic  status.94 
Staying  mindful of  unconscious  bias and  how  health-care 
institutions  propagate  this  stigma  can  help  reduce  further

harm  to  our  pregnant  population  with  SUD.  Providing 
education  and  advocacy  for  pregnant  populations  to 
receive  evidence-based  treatments  for  SUD  is  crucial  to 
promoting  the  health  and  wellness  of  the  parent-baby 
dyad.  For  example,  ensuring  pregnant  patients  with  alco-
hol,  opioid,  and  nicotine  use  disorders  have  access  to 
FDA-approved  evidence-based  medications.  In  addition 
to  active  medical  treatment,  educating  pregnant  popula-
tions  on  harm  reduction  based  on  the  substance  utilized 
can  also  have  significant  health  impacts.  For  example,  in 
a  systematic  review  of  63  studies,  authors  concluded  that 
alcohol  reduction  (but  not  necessarily  abstinence)  was 
associated with major benefits to parent and child, includ-
ing reduced alcohol-related injury, improved cardiovascu-
lar 
recovery, 
decreased  psychiatric  symptoms  or  need  for  psychiatric 
hospitalization, and lower psychosocial stress levels.95

Labor/Delivery
People  who  use  substances  are  often  labeled  as  “drug- 
seeking”  and  can  be  denied  standard-of-care  pain  relief 
based  on  their  substance  use  history.  Even  historical  sub-
stance use or use disorders that have been documented, but 
not  updated,  in  a  pregnant  person’s  medical  chart  can 
introduce  stigma  and  limit  access  to  quality  pain  control 
in  the  peripartum  period.  Uncontrolled  pain,  traumatiza-
tion,  and  other  forms  of  institutional  stigma  can  decrease 
the  quality  of  care  provided,  decrease  the  likelihood  that 
birthing  people  will  remain  in  the  hospital  for  recom-
mended aftercare, and reduce the likelihood that the parent 
and  child  will  return  for  recommended  well-baby  exams 
and  postpartum  appointments.  Establishing  relationships 
of  trust  and  support enables  care  in the  moment,  but also 
invests in the future care of both parent and child. Patients 
on opioid agonist treatment for OUD should be continued 
on their agonist therapy; this dose should not be expected 
to provide additional analgesia and additional pain should 
be managed with additional therapies or treatments.96

Postpartum
The rooming-in of parent and baby, family integration, and 
increased  practitioner  training  in  neonatal  withdrawal  have 
been  associated  with  improved  outcomes  for  babies  with 
NWS,  including  reduced  need  for  pharmacotherapy  and 
shorter  hospital  stays.  Implementation  of  these  strategies 
can be limited by poor institutional assessment tools, limited 
breastfeeding promotion, and practitioner stigma.97  Patients 
previously  maintained  on  medications  for  SUD  or  other 

mental and physical health conditions should be  offered to 
resume such treatments, pending plans for breastfeeding and 
risk/benefit analysis.22 The postpartum period can be a high- 
risk  period  for  return  to  substance  use  as  well  as  death  by 
overdose. Although active pregnancy can be highly motivat-
ing for many people with SUD to seek recovery and focus on 
health, some may return to substance use soon after delivery 
and this  use  may be  more chaotic  and  high-risk. Overdose 
rates are highest 7–12 months after having baby, likely due to 
many  factors  such  as  changes  in  physiologic  response  to 
substance,  loss  of  tolerance,  loss  of  support  systems,  and 
hormonal  changes  common  in  the  postpartum  period.  In 
addition, the probability that medications for OUD, such as 
methadone, will be discontinued in the first 6 months post-
partum  can  be  as  high  as  56%,  which  can  also  increase 
overdose  risk  and  worsen  health  outcomes.98  Although 
routes  exist  for  medical  insurance  and  social  services  for 
pregnant  populations,  some  of  these  supports  may  be 
removed  postpartum,  decreasing  access  to  care.  Non- 
coercive  contraception  counseling  should  be  completed 
with  the  option  to  receive  a  long-acting  reversible  contra-
ceptive prior to leaving the hospital.57

Lactation
Breast  or  chest  feeding  has  significant  benefits  for  both 
the lactating parent and baby.99  The ACOG recommends 
that people stable on MOUD, not using illicit drugs, and 
have  no  other  contraindications  to  breastfeeding  should 
be  actively  supported  in  breastfeeding.100  For  those par-
ents  with  OUD  on  methadone  treatment,  chest  feeding 
has  been  shown  to  reduce  harm  in  NWS,  such  as 
decreasing  the  need  for  pharmacologic  treatment  in 
babies, shortening the length of neonatal hospitalization, 
and  decreasing  the  overall  severity  of  NWS.  As  such, 
breast and chest feeding should be supported for parents 
interested,  regardless  of  utilization  of  MOUD,  and  may 
require  additional  people  and  resources  to  overcome 
barriers.101  The  benefit  associated  with  chest  feeding  in 
buprenorphine  maintenance  patients  is  unclear,  possibly 
complicated  by  its  poor  oral  bioavailability.  Due  to 
insufficient data, ACOG discourages cannabis use during 
lactation. Yet, providing education that cannabis peaks in 
concentration  approximately  1  hour  after  consumption 
may  help  reduce  harm  by  encouraging  planning  around 
use  and  lactation.102  Alcohol  use  during  breastfeeding 
can  limit milk  production  and  impair  child  motor devel-
opment.  ACOG  recommends  lactating  people  consume 
no more than 0.5 mg alcohol per kg body weight and to

Conclusions and Future Directions
In this narrative review, we present a summary of the litera-
ture  showing  that  substance  use  during  pregnancy  is  asso-
ciated with various levels of stigma and that stigma worsens 
outcomes for birthing populations while propagating harm to 
the next generation. The first limitation of this work is that we 
conducted a narrative review of the literature, acknowledging 
that  a  systematic  review  would  yield  stronger  conclusions. 
Second,  given  that  we  restricted  our  search  to  articles  in 
English  and  also  because  of  our  clinical  background,  most 
of  the  review  focuses  on  stigma  against  substance  use  in 
pregnancy  from  a  US-centric  perspective  that  does  not 
directly generalize internationally.

SUD  and  deaths  by  overdose  remain  one  of  the  most 
crucial public health crises of our time, worsened by puni-
tive  policies  that  are  seeded  in  stigma.  Although  more 
research is needed  to clarify  the most effective  methods to 
combat  stigma  towards  SUD  and  SUD  in  pregnancy,  the 
following strategies should be implemented now:

1.  Use  person-first  language  when  referring  to  people 

using substances.

2.  Focus  on  systems-level  causes  of  addiction,  rather 

than focusing on individuals.

3.  Emphasize  and  advocate  for  solutions  to  the  nega-
tive effects of substance use, such as overdose prevention 
through harm reduction programming.

4.  Implement  policies  and  protocols  that  support 
families,  facilitate  parent–child  attachment,  and  enhance 
the capacity of parents to care for their children.

All  institutions  that  interact  with  pregnant  and  parenting 
populations should critically evaluate how they communicate 
and interact with populations who use drugs from their signage 
and online presence to the first direct person contact down to 
each person that works within the area. Health-care institutions 
can make great strides by focusing less on policing the preg-
nant populations who use drugs and focusing more on robust 
inclusivity,  support,  harm  reduction,  and  multidisciplinary 
integration  of  all  methods  shown  to  improve  outcomes  for 
parent–child dyads exposed to substances.
