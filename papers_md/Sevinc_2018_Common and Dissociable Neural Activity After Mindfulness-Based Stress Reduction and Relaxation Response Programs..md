ABSTRACT
Objective: We investigated common and dissociable neural and psychological correlates of two widely used meditation-based stress
reduction programs.
Methods: Participants were randomized to the Relaxation Response (RR; n = 18; 56% female) or the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR; n = 16; 56% female) programs. Both programs use a “bodyscan” meditation; however, the RR program explicitly emphasizes
physical relaxation during this practice, whereas the MBSR program emphasizes mindful awareness with no explicit relaxation instruc-
tions. After the programs, neural activity during the respective meditation was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Results: Both programs were associated with reduced stress (for RR, from 14.1 ± 6.6 to 11.3 ± 5.5 [Cohen's d = 0.50; for MBSR, from
17.7 ± 5.7 to 11.9 ± 5.0 [Cohen's d = 1.02]). Conjunction analyses revealed functional coupling between ventromedial prefrontal regions
and supplementary motor areas (p < .001). The disjunction analysis indicated that the RR bodyscan was associated with stronger functional
connectivity of the right inferior frontal gyrus—an important hub of intentional inhibition and control—with supplementary motor areas
(p < .001, family-wise error [FWE] rate corrected). The MBSR program was uniquely associated with improvements in self-compassion
and rumination, and the within-group analysis of MBSR bodyscan revealed significant functional connectivity of the right anterior
insula—an important hub of sensory awareness and salience—with pregenual anterior cingulate during bodyscan meditation compared
with rest (p = .03, FWE corrected).
Conclusions: The bodyscan exercises in each program were associated with both overlapping and differential functional coupling patterns,
which were consistent with each program's theoretical foundation. These results may have implications for the differential effects of these
programs for the treatment of diverse conditions.
Key words: meditation, mindfulness, mindfulness-based stress reduction program, relaxation response, bodyscan.

INTRODUCTION

The use of mind-body techniques as complementary medical

interventions has been increasing dramatically (1). Most
meditation-based clinical programs are modeled on one of two
well-known stress reduction courses—the relaxation response
(RR) program developed by Herbert Benson (2–4) or the
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program developed

by Jon Kabat-Zinn (5–7). Both programs have been operating for
more than 40 years, and their effectiveness has been validated with
samples of patients with a wide variety of illnesses (8–13).
Although both interventions are based on meditation, the scientific
philosophies and meditative traditions upon which each is
founded are distinct: the RR program emphasizes the induction of a
relaxed physiological state hypothesized to be the opposite of the
stress response, whereas the MBSR program is hypothesized
to work by cultivating a particular nonjudgmental attitude termed
“mindfulness.” Consequently, MBSR does not necessarily encourage
relaxation but posits that a form of “meta-relaxation” may arise from
the nonjudgmental acceptance of any given body state. Given these
similarities and implied theoretical differences, the goal of this study
is to compare psychological changes and investigate putative
common and dissociable neural activation patterns associated with
each program. A finding of both common and divergent neural
activation patterns could potentially have implications for how
these programs are prescribed.

The different theoretical orientations are reflected in how each
meditation technique is practiced. The difference is most apparent
in the “bodyscan” meditation practice, during which attention is
moved sequentially through the body. The general instructions in
both programs are the same, but the RR program explicitly in-
structs participants to intentionally reduce arousal and muscle ten-
sion in each body area with the goal of decreasing sympathetic
activation (14). Conversely, the MBSR program emphasizes pay-
ing attention to present moment sensory experience in each body
area without trying to change anything and explicitly teaches
participants that physical relaxation is not an aim of meditation
practice (6). This differential emphasis on relaxation versus
mindfulness applies to all the techniques taught in both pro-
grams. Indeed, the founders of each program argue that the spe-
cific meditation techniques used are less important than how
these techniques are practiced. As such, although the RR pro-
gram includes some instruction in mindfulness, it is a relatively
minor component of the program and typically consists of in-
structions to be mindful of becoming more relaxed.

Despite their long history, these programs have never been di-
rectly compared in a single study, and so it has been impossible to
compare and contrast their neural correlates and behavioral out-
comes. Numerous studies of many different types of meditation
have been performed and have found both overlapping and divergent
results in terms of peripheral and autonomic physiology (4,15–17),
neural activation (18,19), and psychological/cognitive (20–23)
effects. However, some studies have used highly experienced
practitioners, whereas others have used novices or clinical
populations. Furthermore, a comparison of studies is confounded
by issues related to selection bias (24), as well as differences in
data collection and analysis techniques. Indeed, even studies
that have specifically studied the neural effects of mindfulness
meditation, which has been the most thoroughly investigated
form to date, have found both overlapping and divergent results
(25), which underscores the need for a direct comparison of
meditation techniques using the same neuroimaging acquisition
and analysis protocols to identify similarities and differences as
to how these meditation techniques are actually performed.

The purpose of this study was specifically to address common
and dissociable functional coupling patterns during meditation prac-
tice, rather than the longitudinal change in brain activity due to

the scanning was only performed at

training. Therefore,
the
posttraining time point because meditating in the scanner is challeng-
ing, and individuals often need extensive instruction and practice be-
fore they are able to achieve a meditative state. Thus, by scanning
only after the programs, meditation-naïve participants had received
sufficient training and experience to meditate in the scanner.

The current study investigates shared and divergent neural ac-
tivation patterns modulated by each bodyscan meditation tech-
nique because it is the most similar practice between the two
programs. As mentioned earlier, both RR and MBSR bodyscan
meditations involve an awareness of bodily sensations. One of
the main brain regions associated with such focused attention med-
itation and a present-centered awareness of the self (26,27) is the
ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). Because present-
centered awareness of the self is shared across both types of med-
itation, we hypothesized that functional coupling pattern of the
vMPFC would be common feature of both programs.

In terms of brain regions that might be unique to each medita-
tion style, because we are specifically interested in dissociable
neural activation patterns that would reflect differences in the the-
oretical orientation of each program, we selected seeds that might
potentially reflect the differential intentions of “to relax” or “to be
mindful.” Although there have been no neuroimaging studies of
the RR program, a study by Tang et al. (28) compared relaxation
training, which was somewhat similar to the RR program, with in-
tegrative mind-body training. The researchers demonstrated that
relaxation training produced differential activation in the lateral
prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control, re-
sponse inhibition, and the selection of information (29–31). They
concluded that this region might be involved in effortful control,
which is critical to create and maintain a relaxed state. Therefore,
we hypothesized that the functional coupling pattern of this region
might be different during the two styles of body scan.

Conversely, although there have been many neuroimaging
studies of mindfulness meditation, most of these have used long-
term practitioners of various traditions (18,25). There have been
no studies of the mindful bodyscan; however, two studies have
identified the insula as a primary region activated by recent MBSR
graduates (26,32). The insula has been repeatedly associated with
mindfulness meditation in both structural (33,34) and functional
studies (35–37). Although sensory feedback is integral to both
types of bodyscan, only the MBSR program emphasizes deliberate
awareness of these sensations, whereas the RR program focuses
more on elicitation of relaxation regardless of the current bodily
sensations. Relying on anterior insula's (aINS) role in somatosensory
conscious awareness (38) and receiving moment-to-moment inputs
from a variety of somatic and sensory centers (39), as well as on the
MBSR program's differential theoretical orientation, which strongly
emphasizes sensory awareness, we hypothesized that the functional
coupling of aINS would also differentiate MBSR from RR.

In line with their theoretical premises, each program has pre-
dominantly used different psychological outcome measures to as-
sess therapeutic success. A direct comparison of the two programs
using a single set of measures may provide important insights into
the differences and similarities between them. In the current study,
we address this need by additionally exploring similarities and dif-
ferences in psychological outcomes. Both programs aim to de-
crease stress, and mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination
are often cited as key mechanisms through which the MBSR

program works (22,23,40). Any group differences in these metrics,
together with the investigation of common and divergent neural
coupling patterns during meditation practice, could help identify
behavioral outcomes and neural correlates, which may be uniquely
associated with each program, and contribute to our understanding
how specific meditation programs may differentially influence
outcomes. Such an understanding has potential implications for
clinical practice because the various psychological outcomes asso-
ciated with each type of program might be differentially beneficial
for certain conditions.

METHODS

Participants
Seventy-four participants were assessed for eligibility, and 60 who met the
inclusion criteria were enrolled in cohorts of 15 (see Appendix A for CON-
SORT flow diagram, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/
PSYMED/A474). Sample size was determined based on our unpublished
pilot study of long-term Vipassana meditation and RR practitioners. Partic-
ipants were recruited in six clusters/cohorts and randomized sequentially
based on time of enrollment. All recruiting occurred during the periods
from January to March and from August to October, and classes took place
either between March 2010 and May 2010 or October 2010 and December
2010. The order of classes was randomized (three cohorts per arm) by coin
flip. Two MBSR classes occurred in the spring and one in the fall. One RR
class took place in the spring and two were in the fall. There were no differ-
ences between the cohorts in terms of the perceived stress levels either at
pre (p = .16) or at post (p = .27) time points. Ten individuals dropped out
before baseline testing, and 50 individuals began the program (RR:
n = 22, MBSR: n = 28); 40 completed at least one behavioral measure at
the posttesting time point (RR: n = 20, MBSR: n = 20). Useable brain data
were available from 34 participants (RR: n = 16, 9 female, mean age =
39.87 ± 10.29 years; MBSR: n = 18, 10 female, mean age =
37.47 ± 9.14 years). No adverse events were reported during the study.
Six of the missing cases for brain analysis were due to corruption of the
raw data during storage and/or data transfer, and thus were not related to
any aspect of the programs. The other 10 dropped out of the study due to
other time commitments. The groups did not differ demographically (see
Table 1). Left-handed individuals, those taking medications that alter cere-
bral blood flow or metabolism, or those who had major illnesses that would
interfere with participation in the study were excluded and individuals who
met standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exclusion criteria (e.g.,
having metallic implants) were excluded, as were those with a history of
head trauma. Participants were required to have had no more than 4 hours

of meditation or yoga practice of any tradition in their lifetime. The age in-
clusion range was 22 to 55 years to minimize the effect of advanced age on
brain function (41). Study staff was not blind to allocation, yet participants
were blind to study objectives and to the composition of the courses. They
were told only that there were two stress reduction courses (Program “A”
and ”B”); no other information on either program was given. Both program
providers were blind to study hypotheses. Questionnaires were collected
via a secure website. Data remained de-identified with regard to group as-
signment until statistical analyses were conducted. The Massachusetts Gen-
eral Hospital's institutional review board approved all study procedures,
and all participants signed a written consent form. Participants were com-
pensated for their time and also were reimbursed for parking when needed.
The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier number of
NCT00625807.

Experimental Protocol

Stress Reduction Programs
The two programs differ slightly in how they are typically taught in health-
care settings. Therefore, we modified both programs to match them in terms
of contact hours with the teacher and amount of home meditation practice
assigned (see hereinafter). Other than these changes, the content of each
program was the same as typically taught in the clinic. Both groups re-
ceived eight weekly, 2-hour group-training sessions and were instructed
to practice for 20 min/d at home with guided recordings. Both programs in-
cluded group exercises and interactions about the challenges and achieve-
ments experienced in the process of integrating mindfulness/relaxation
into their lives and into stressful situations encountered throughout the day.

RR course
Typically, this is a 10-week program that meets weekly for 2 hours. Classes
8 and 9 were removed to fit the 8-week format of the study. Over the
8-week program, four different techniques for eliciting the RR were taught
to participants: guided relaxing bodyscan, focus word (mental repetition of
a word, sound, or phrase), breath counting, and breath awareness. One sin-
gle 20-minute guided meditation session that included all four techniques
was used throughout the entire duration of the program. Janet Fronk who
has more than 20 years of experience teaching the RR program at the
Benson/Henry Mind-Body Medical Institute taught the RR course.

MBSR course
Typically, this is an 8-week program that meets weekly for 2.5 hours and
also includes an “all-day” retreat after the sixth class. To fit the constraints
of the study, classes were shortened to 2 hours and the all-day retreat was
not included. Typically, the course enrolls 25 to 30 participants and the

2.5 hours provides time for class participation from everyone. Because the
study enrolled just 15 people per cohort, all content could be covered within
the allotted 2-hour classes. Over the course of the 8-week program, three
meditation techniques were taught to participants, with just one technique
practiced during each 20-minute home practice session (typically, MBSR
prescribes 40 min/d of practice; however, this was reduced to 20 minutes
to match the home practice prescribed by the RR program). During the first
2 weeks, participants practiced mindful bodyscan; during weeks 3 and 4,
they practiced mindful yoga (simple yoga postures done with a mindful at-
titude); and then during weeks 5 to 6, they practiced sitting meditation
(which comprises watching the flow of breath and mental phenomena with-
out trying to control these). During the final 2 weeks, participants were free
to choose which practice to do. The MBSR course was taught by Carol
Legro, who completed the MBSR teacher training program and has more
than 12 years experience teaching MBSR. See Appendix C, Supplemental
Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A474, for further details
about the courses.

Experimental Design

Behavioral Measures
The following questionnaires were administered at baseline and postprograms.

The Perceived Stress Scale
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (42) assesses the degree to which situa-
tions are appraised as stressful (i.e., unpredictable, uncontrollable, and
overloading) and was our main clinical outcome measure. The scale in-
cludes 10 items, that is, “How often have you felt confident about your abil-
ity to handle your personal problems?” which participants respond to on a
five-point Likert scale from 0 being never to 4 being very often. Total
scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater overall dis-
tress and α reliability coefficient ranges from .75 to .86.

The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) (43) is a commonly
used, 39-item measure consisting of five subscales (observing, describing,
acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner experience, and nonreactivity
to inner experience). Observing includes noticing or attending to internal
and external experiences such as sensations, thoughts, or emotions. De-
scribing denotes labeling internal experiences with words. Acting with
awareness refers to focusing on one's activities in the moment as opposed
to behaving mechanically. Nonjudgment of inner experience refers to tak-
ing a nonevaluative stance toward thoughts and feelings. Nonreactivity to
inner experience is allowing thoughts and feelings to come and go, without
getting caught up in them. The scale includes 39 sentences such as “I per-
ceive my feelings and emotions without having to react to them,” and the
participants are asked to rate on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never
or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The FFMQ contains
both positively and negatively worded items (20 and 19, respectively), with
higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness. α Reliability coeffi-
cient ranges from .67 to .93.

The Self-Compassion Scale
The Self-Compassion Scale (44) includes items that measure how often
people respond to feelings of inadequacy or suffering with self-kindness
(e.g., “I try to be loving toward myself when I'm feeling emotional pain”),
self-judgment (e.g., “I'm disapproving and judgmental about my own flaws
and inadequacies”), common humanity (e.g., “I try to see my failings as
part of the human condition”), isolation (e.g., “When I think about my in-
adequacies it tends to make me feel more separate and cut off from the rest
of the world”), mindfulness (e.g., “When something painful happens I try to
take a balanced view of the situation”), and overidentification (e.g., “When
I'm feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that's wrong”).
The scale includes 26 items, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (almost
never) to 5 (almost always). α Reliability coefficients range from .75 to .81.

The Rumination Response Questionnaire
The Rumination Response Questionnaire (45) assesses depressive rumina-
tion styles and measures the tendencies to a) reflect on problems, defined as
contemplative, intentional pondering of one's mood with a focus on prob-
lem solving and b) brood, referring to passive and judgmental pondering
of one's mood. The scale includes 22 items, such as “I think ‘why do I have
problems other people don't have’?” and the items rated on a scale from
ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). α Reliability coeffi-
cients range from .72 to .77.

Common Life Stressors
The Holmes-Rahe Scale (46) was administered to ensure that changes in
stress were not due to a recent or upcoming life event. This scale, also called
the social readjustment rating scale, includes 43 life events such as “death
of a close family member” or “personal injury or illness.” Each event is
assigned a “Life Change Unit” score, and an overall score is obtained by
adding them to predict illness.

Home Practice
Participants were given paper logs on which to record their daily meditation
practice. Compliance is listed in Table 1 along with attendance.

MRI Acquisition Parameters
All participants were scanned at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imag-
ing in Boston, MA. High-resolution MRI data were acquired using a Sie-
mens Magnetom Avanto 1.5-T scanner with standard head coil. Data sets
of the whole brain were collected using a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence,
consisting of 128 sagittal slices (1.0 (cid:1) 1.0 (cid:1) 1.3 mm; TI = 1000 milliseconds;
echo time = 3.39 milliseconds; repetition time (TR) = 2730 milliseconds).
Functional data were acquired using an ascending sequence order (TR =
2000 milliseconds; flip angle = 90°; matrix size = 64 (cid:1) 64; field of
view = 200 mm; 25 axial slices; slice thickness = 3.0 mm) Head motion
was restricted using two padded clamps.

MRI-Guided Meditation Sessions
All participants underwent a 24-minute scan during which they listened to a
guided recording containing excerpts from their daily home meditation
practice instructions. The scan comprised four 6-minute segments, each
containing verbal prompts. The prompts at each segment were matched
for duration and on-set time to minimize confounds due to listening (see
Fig. 1 for a graph depicting scanning sessions for each group and for exact
timings of the verbal prompts and Appendix B in Supplemental Digital
Content, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A474). For both groups, the first
two segments comprised a guided resting state and a guided silent random
number generation task. The third segment was the guided relaxing or
mindful bodyscan, and the fourth segment contained other meditation in-
structions unique to each program (not included in the current analyses).
The instructions were communicated through headphones, which also muf-
fled the sound of the scanner.

The bodyscan meditation recordings were matched in terms of the body
area toward which participant's attention was directed and timing onsets.
The RR group received specific instructions to relax that body area,
whereas the MBSR group received instructions to notice and be aware of
the same body area. For instance, RR participants heard: “Now bringing
awareness to your jaw, and as you exhale release any tension or clenching.”
“Now feeling a wave of relaxation spreading down over your face, letting
your cheeks release and soften so your whole face feels comfortable and re-
laxed.” The MBSR group heard: “Be aware of the jaw, the hinge joint on
either side of the face, and the muscles of the jaw.” “Bringing attention to
the cheeks, the muscles of the cheeks and face that give expression to our
many emotions, the sinuses, the ears, the outer ear, the ability to hear at this
moment.” In the present study, we specifically analyzed the bodyscan
versus resting state contrasts within and between groups because the dif-
ferences in ideology were likely to be most evident during bodyscan

meditations and because they were matched for the focus of attention on
the body.

Data Analyses
Preprocessing included correction for head motion, temporal and spatial
normalization in Montreal Neurological Institute space, and smoothing
using a Gaussian kernel with an isotropic kernel with a full width at half
maximum of 6 mm using the standard pipeline for volume-based analyses
provided in the Connectivity Toolbox (CONN) (47) and Statistical Para-
metric Mapping (SPM8; Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology).
To ensure that participants were following the bodyscan instructions,
we first performed an event-related partial least squares analysis (48,49)
time locked to the period when participants were attending to their face
as a manipulation check. We chose this body area because this part of the
recording was the longest in duration and enabled highest power to detect
neural activation. Within this time course, we arbitrarily created five blocks
of four TRs and averaged across these blocks. A similar procedure was ap-
plied to the resting state scan.

To test our neural hypotheses, seed-based functional connectivity anal-
ysis was performed using the CONN toolbox and the full-resting and
meditation-state blocks. For time and frequency decomposition, a band-
pass filter (0.01–0.15) was applied. To address artifacts such as spiking
and motion, which might contribute to spurious correlations, artifact detec-
tion was used, as implemented in the CONN toolbox. CONN implements
the CompCor method (50) to identify principal components associated with
segmented white matter and cerebrospinal fluid for each participant. White
matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and realignment parameters are entered as con-
founds in a first-level analysis, and the data are band-pass filtered to 0.008
to 0.09 Hz. This method addresses the confounding effects of participant
movement, without regressing the global signal and without affecting intrin-
sic functional connectivity (51). In addition to accounting for head motion
and other nuisance factors at the single-subject level in all connectivity anal-
yses, we also extracted maximum voxel displacement values for each partic-
ipant and conducted a statistical analysis for between-group differences. The
results demonstrated that there were no differences between groups in terms
of average realignment values, t(32) = 0.83 (two-sided p = .41).

For the investigation of shared functional coupling, an a priori seed in
ventral medial frontal cortex (vMPFC; MNI coordinates: −4, 50, −20)

and an SPM “conjunction null” analysis were used. As an exploratory in-
vestigation, the same seed was used to investigate the relationship between
differences in perceived stress levels and functional connectivity of the seed
to whole brain during the bodyscan > rest for both groups. For the investi-
gation of differential functional coupling patterns, a priori seeds of right in-
ferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) pars opercularis (MNI coordinates: 54, 14, 16)
and the dorsal aINS (MNI coordinates: 32, 20, 0) were used. Further anal-
yses were conducted to investigate differences in perceived stress level and
functional connectivity of these seeds to whole brain during the bodyscan > rest
for each group. All imaging analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons
using a combination of voxel-level thresholds (p < .001) and cluster extent
threshold with a family-wise error (FWE) rate at p < .05. Given the conser-
vative nature of conjunction analysis (52), for the conjunction analysis,
only data with a p value less than .001 (uncorrected) are reported. For all
seeds,
the parcellation scheme of Hashmi et al. (53), based on the
Harvard Oxford Atlas, was used. Statistical analyses compared functional
connectivity differences between RR and MBSR bodyscan meditations
using bodyscan > rest contrasts. The results reflect connectivity of region
of interests to whole brain and all coordinates reported refer to peak activa-
tions in anatomical MNI space.

RESULTS

Demographics
There were no significant differences between the RR and MBSR
groups on baseline demographic characteristics or on recent life
stressors (Table 1). There were significant differences in baseline
perceived stress levels between the participants who attended RR
(14.10 ± 6.5) and MBSR (18.59 ± 6.75) programs. However,
there was no significant difference in baseline perceived stress
levels between the RR (14.69 ± 7.0) and MBSR (18.33 ± 6.26)
programs among participants included in the brain analyses
(t(32) = 1.60, p = .12).

Perceived Stress
A mixed two-way analysis of variance was conducted on PSS
scores including group (RR versus MBSR) as the between-subject

and time (pre versus post program) as the within-subject indepen-
dent variable. A main effect was found for time (F(1,37) = 23.12,
p < .001), indicating that both programs were successful in reduc-
ing perceived stress. As expected, the group by time interaction
was not significant (F(1,37) = 2.80, p = .10), indicating that groups
did not differ in the reduction of perceived stress. Because neuro-
imaging data were only available from a subset of participants, we
repeated the same analyses including only those participants with
neuroimaging data. Similar results were obtained, indicating a
main effect for time (F(1,30) = 19.00, p < .001) and a nonsignifi-
cant group by time interaction (F(1,30) = 1.51, p = .21).

Other Behavioral Measures
The effects of each program on psychological measures are listed
in Table 2. The RR program was associated with increases in the
“describing,” “acting with awareness,” “observing,” and “non-
reactivity” facets of the FFMQ. The MBSR program was associ-
ated with increases in the observing and nonreactivity facets of
the FFMQ, as well as increases in self-compassion and decreases
in rumination levels. A series of analyses of variance comparing
pre-post differences in these measures between groups did not
yield significant results (maximal F(1,37) = 2.801, p = .10), indi-
cating that change in these measures did not significantly differ be-
tween groups. There was a correlation between change in PSS
scores and change in the self-kindness subscale in MBSR
(r = −0.568, p < .05) and between change in PSS and the common
humanity subscale of the Self-Compassion Scale in RR (r = −0.493,
p < .05). There were no correlations between change in PSS scores
and changes on other measures for either group.

Analysis of Bodyscan Instructions
To confirm that the two stress reduction programs differed in terms
of their emphasis on relaxation and awareness, we assessed the fre-
quency of instructions that included awareness or relaxation com-
ponents in the home practice guided meditation instructions. On
average, for the RR bodyscan recording, 78% of the instructions
alluded to relaxation or feeling relaxed and 68.3% alluded to
awareness. For the MBSR recording, 37.5% alluded to relaxation
or feeling relaxed and 84.4% alluded to awareness. The differ-
ences in instructions that included awareness and relaxation com-
ponents were statistically significant—instructions with relaxation
components were more frequent in RR (p < .001, Fisher's exact
test), and the instructions with awareness components were more
frequent in MBSR (p < .01, Fisher's exact test).

Neuroimaging Results
Before testing our hypotheses, we first performed a manipula-
tion check to ensure that participants were complying with the
guided meditation instructions. An event-related analysis of
bodyscan > rest was performed time locked to the period when
participants were focused on their face. As detailed in Methods,
this particular location was chosen because it was the body area
with the longest duration, enabling averaging across several
TRs. This revealed a significant cluster in primary somatosen-
sory cortex (+66, −12, +28; 12 voxels, cluster p < .001) in an
area frequently associated with the face (Neurosynth, retrieved
on June 29, http://neurosynth.org/locations/66_-12_28_6/),

Mindfulness Versus Relaxation Response

suggesting that participants were complying with the medita-
tion instructions.

To investigate patterns of functional coupling shared across the
two bodyscan meditations, “conjunction null” analyses were
performed using individual RR bodyscan > rest and MBSR
bodyscan > rest contrasts in SPM8. Analysis of RR bodyscan > rest
contrast using a vMPFC seed yielded a significant cluster with the
peak coordinates (+50, −78, −02; 74 voxels, cluster p-FWE =
.018) in extrastriate area, whereas analysis of MBSR bodyscan > rest
contrast using vMPFC seed yielded two significant clusters with
peak coordinates (+2, +30, +48; 82 voxels, cluster p-FWE < .001)
and (+16, −88, −10; 61 voxels, cluster p-FWE = .045) in prefrontal
and occipital cortices, respectively. Conjunction analysis using
these contrasts revealed a significant cluster within supplementary
motor areas with the peak coordinates (+2, +34, +38; 43 voxels,
p < .001, false discovery rate cluster corrected at p < .05; Fig. 2).
Additional analyses examined the relationship between functional
connectivity during bodyscan (bodyscan meditation > rest contrast)
and differences in perceived levels of stress from printervention to
postintervention with all participants. Whole-brain correlation
between vMPFC connectivity and improvement in stress revealed
a significant cluster in frontopolar cortex with peak coordinates
(+34, +58, +02; 74 voxels, cluster p-FWE < .05).

To test our hypothesis regarding the differential engagement of
rIFG in RR versus MBSR, whole-brain functional connectivity
disjunction analyses were performed using the rIFG seed for the
bodyscan versus rest contrast. The RR group demonstrated differ-
ential coupling of rIFG regions with anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), and aINS (Fig. 3A,
Table 3A). No significant regions were identified in the MBSR
group. A between-group analysis of the [bodyscan > rest] contrasts
yielded a significant cluster in supplementary and presupplementary
motor areas for the RR group in both hemispheres with the peak
coordinates (−04, +04, +50; 194 voxels, cluster p-FWE < .001;
Fig. 3B).

Next, whole-brain functional connectivity analyses were per-
formed using the aINS seed. The disjunction analyses for the
MBSR versus RR comparison using [bodyscan > rest] contrasts
did not reach significance (all p > .05, FWE corrected). The anal-
ysis for the RR group alone did not yield significant results. The
analysis for only the MBSR group demonstrated coupling of aINS
with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) and precentral
gyrus (Fig. 4, Table 3B). The analysis investigating differences
in perceived stress levels and functional connectivity of these
seeds to whole brain during the bodyscan > rest for each group
did not yield significant results.

DISCUSSION
As expected, both the RR and MBSR programs were associated
with comparable decreases in perceived stress levels but differed
in psychological measures of mindfulness, rumination, and self-
compassion. In addition, the two programs exhibited common
and dissociable functional coupling patterns during their respective
bodyscan meditations. Functional coupling of vMPFC to supple-
mentary motor area was shared across the two types of bodyscan
meditations, potentially reflecting the present moment awareness
and focused attention to the body that is integral to both bodyscan
meditations. The functional coupling of this seed to a cluster in

Mindfulness Versus Relaxation Response

FIGURE 3. A, Functional coupling of rIFGpo (circled in gray) for the RR group (bodyscan > rest contrast). The results demonstrated
coupling of rIFG regions with ACC, SMAs, and aINS during RR bodyscan. B, Differences between the functional coupling of rIFG
seed to whole brain between the RR and the MBSR groups (bodyscan > rest; Table 3A). A between-group analysis of the
[bodyscan > rest] contrasts yielded a significant cluster in supplementary and presupplementary motor areas for the RR group in both
hemispheres with the peak coordinates (−04, +04, + 0; 194 voxels, cluster p-FWE = .000067). rIFGpo = inferior frontal gyrus pars

frontopolar cortex correlated with reductions in perceived stress levels.
The RR bodyscan was differentially associated with specific neural
activity in regions associated with control of physical/autonomic
relaxation (rIFG and SMA). Moreover, although regions commonly
associated with interoceptive awareness (aINS and pACC) were
functionally coupled during the MBSR bodyscan, this pattern did
not differentiate the mindful from the relaxing bodyscan. These data
highlight that specific theoretical orientations that are incorporated
into guided meditation practices can influence neural activity, which
in turn could potentially mediate differential clinical outcomes.

Both stress reduction courses were associated with decreases
in perceived stress and increases in levels of mindfulness as

measured by the FFMQ. Interestingly, although both programs
were associated with significant increases in the “observing”
and “nonreactivity” subscales of the FFMQ, the RR program fur-
ther resulted in significant increases in the “describing” and “act-
ing with awareness” subscales. The RR program introduces the
concept of mindfulness and includes 2 minutes of mindful
breathing during the daily-guided home meditation practice. Al-
though we anticipated that there might be some increase in mind-
fulness in the RR group, we had hypothesized that
the

known to have several psychometric issues with respect to it's
factor structure (54), which might also explain this discrepancy.
Further research using other methods to assess mindfulness will
be necessary to reach a conclusion with respect to the relative
role of mindfulness in the two programs.

Only MBSR was associated with changes in self-compassion
and rumination. Previous studies have found mediating relation-
ships between mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination and
clinical outcome measures in the MBSR programs (13,40,55,56).
To our knowledge, changes in compassion and rumination have
not been previously assessed in relation to the RR program. The
differences in these psychological metrics suggest that each pro-
gram may reduce perceived stress through differential psycholog-
ical processes. Although correlations were not found between
most of these metrics and levels of stress reduction and/or brain
connectivity, the lack of significant results could be due to our
small sample size, which limits the determination of dissociable
functional coupling patterns associated with each stress reduction
program. It is also important to note that each program uses multi-
ple meditation techniques and both programs include didactic con-
tent that was not matched between the programs. These other
program elements likely provide additional components, although
the founders of both programs have explicitly stated that all as-
pects of their program are designed to foster increased relaxation
or mindfulness, respectively. For the present study, we wished to
study the existing RR and MBSR programs because each is well
validated, widely used, and well studied. Future larger studies ex-
amining programs that have identical didactic content and specifi-
cally focus on one meditation technique per program are needed to
more precisely investigate the differential effects.

Both styles of bodyscan meditation shared functional coupling
patterns between vMPFC and supplementary motor areas, which
is consistent with focused attention on bodily sensations and
present-centered awareness of the self (26). Mindfulness training
has been previously associated with vMPFC, especially in relation
to modulation of value signals (57). Functional coupling between
these two regions has also previously been associated with cogni-
tive control (58). Moreover, the correlation between functional
connectivity of the vMPFC and differences in perceived levels of
stress yielded a significant cluster in frontopolar cortex. Gray mat-
ter in this region was found to be thicker in advanced mindfulness
meditation practitioners compared with nonmeditators (33). The
functional coupling between these regions has also been previ-
ously associated with individual differences in behavioral flexibil-
ity (59). Flexibility is critical for coping and adjustment to stressful
conditions, and has been shown to improve after mindfulness
meditation (60–62). Frontopolar cortex has also been implicated
in cognitive control of emotion through strategies such as
reappraisal and suppression (63,64), as well as in goal formation
and maintenance (65). The observed correlation between reductions
in perceived stress and the functional coupling between these
regions is consistent with these findings. However, more research
is required to draw conclusions on the relationship between stress
reduction and the present functional coupling patterns.

The RR program specifically emphasizes decreasing sympa-
thetic activation through a deliberate reduction of arousal and mus-
cle tension (66). After training, participants exhibited differential
functional coupling of rIFG—an important hub of intentional inhi-
bition and control (30,31)—to the ACC and SMA during a relaxing
bodyscan compared with rest. Critically, functional coupling of

rIFG pars opercularis to SMA differentiated the relaxing bodyscan
from the mindful bodyscan, implicating inhibitory neural networks
in the relaxing bodyscan meditation. The rIFG and SMA are among
the areas identified in previous studies of biofeedback-mediated
physical relaxation (67,68), supporting the hypothesis that RR-based
stress reduction may be mediated by physical relaxation during
the bodyscan.

Preparation and execution of voluntary muscle relaxation has
previously been associated with motor inhibition and with neural
activity in primary and supplementary motor areas (69). The rIFG
functions as a domain general “brake” mechanism over response
tendencies (30,31). This brake can be turned on both externally
by salient stop signals and internally by goals. Both the rIFG and
SMA have previously been implicated in motor response inhibi-
tion using stop-signal paradigms, and an rIFG-based network is
thought to play a causal role in inhibitory motor control (70,71).
However, because these experimental paradigms usually involve
multiple cognitive processes of attentional capture and response
inhibition, no consensus has been achieved regarding the exact
contribution of inferior frontal gyrus to attention and inhibition
(72–74). Given that the two bodyscan protocols were largely
identical with regard to attentional capture and differed only in
terms of additional “relaxation” component, the primary contribution
of the rIFG may be motor inhibition rather than attention. In line
with this interpretation, prior research associated this region with
motor intentions and higher-level representations that exist before
and independently of action execution (75,76).

During the MBSR bodyscan, which emphasizes nonjudgmen-
tal awareness to sensory experience, the right aINS—an important
hub of sensory awareness and salience—was strongly coupled with
pregenual ACC. The aINS is associated with awareness of the sen-
sory aspects of experience and subjective feeling states (77) and has
been identified in multiple neuroimaging studies of mindfulness
meditation (26,32,37,78). The aINS is part of the circuitry impli-
cated in anxiety (79) and has projections to cingulate regions (80).
The ACC is involved in emotional regulation, and the pregenual
subdivision specifically regulates limbic activity during the genera-
tion of emotional responses (81). Our finding of increased func-
tional coupling of aINS and pACC during the MBSR bodyscan
may thus indicate enhanced awareness of the sensory aspects of
affective experience and modulation of emotional responses to this
affective experience through the neural functions of the ACC.
However, it is important to note that this functional coupling pat-
tern did not differentiate the MBSR from the RR bodyscan, possi-
bly suggesting the presence of these processes during the RR
bodyscan to a certain degree.

As mentioned previously, the RR program introduces the con-
cept of mindfulness to participants and instructs individuals to be-
come more aware of present moment sensory experience, which is
one component of mindfulness. However, during the RR bodyscan,
every instruction to become aware of a body region is followed by
an instruction to relax that area, whereas the MBSR bodyscan in-
structions are to just be aware, without trying to change anything. In-
terestingly, although the aINS-pACC functional coupling pattern
was significant in the MBSR group, the disjunction analyses using
aINS seed did not yield significant results. This is consistent with
the idea that the RR program develops the skill of mindfulness.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of a
variety of meditation practices. It has been unclear to what extent

Mindfulness Versus Relaxation Response

these practices share neural correlates. Interestingly, a recent study
compared electroencephalogram activity during a focused-attention
and open monitoring meditation practice from practitioners of two
Buddhist traditions (17). The researchers found that the differences
between the two meditation traditions were more pronounced than
the differences between the two types of meditation. These data
are consistent with our findings that theoretical orientation of how
a practice is taught strongly influences neural activity during these
practices. However, the study used long-term practitioners from dif-
ferent cultures, which may have confounded the results. By directly
comparing these programs in a homogeneous meditation-naive co-
hort and using the same data collection and analysis methods, we
were able to confirm that the RR and MBSR programs are associ-
ated with differential psychological and neural processes. These
results are in line with theoretical models that attempt to describe
potential mechanisms of change associated with meditation (82–84)
and suggest that different meditation practices may be associated
with overlapping as well as differential neural correlates and
behavioral outcomes, which may potentially have significant
effects on disease. One limitation of the present study is the lack
of a passive control group, which limits our ability to interpret
findings. It is possible that all observed changes were due to
passage of time or generic group effects. Nevertheless, prior
studies with control groups have demonstrated that both programs
are successful in reducing stress levels (40) and that MBSR
program is effective for increasing mindfulness and compassion
while decreasing rumination.

Our results suggest that these programs likely promote well-
ness through shared and different processes, and each intervention
may therefore potentially have differential effects on treatment of
illnesses. Future studies with larger sample sizes would be benefi-
cial to assess the relationship between pre-post neural changes as-
sociated with each intervention and the behavioral outcome
measures. Another limitation of the study was the cluster random-
ization method, which can be sensitive to intragroup correlations,
seasonal effects, and intermittent environmental stressors. Finally,
future studies specifically designed to compare differential effects
of these programs on particular diseases will be necessary to deter-
mine if these differences need to be taken into consideration when
prescribing meditation-based programs.
