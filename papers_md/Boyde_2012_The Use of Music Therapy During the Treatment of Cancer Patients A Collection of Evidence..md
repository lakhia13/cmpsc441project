background: Music therapy is one of 
the oldest forms of creative art thera-
py and has been shown to have effects 
in  different  clinical  and  therapeutic 
settings, such as schizophrenia, pain, 
cardiovascular  parameters,  and 
dementia.  This  article  provides  an 
overview of some of the recent find-
ings in this field and also reports two 
single case vignettes that offer insight 
into  day-to-day  applications  of  clini-
cal music therapy.
material and methods: For the col-
lection  of  clinical  studies  of  music 
therapy  in  oncology,  the  databases 
AMED, CAIRSS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
PsychINFO,  and  PSYNDEX  were 
searched  with  the  terms  “Study  OR 
Trial”  AND  “Music  Therapy”  AND 
“Cancer OR Oncolog$.” Studies were 
analyzed with respect to their design, 
setting  and  interventions,  indica-
tions, patients, and outcomes. In addi-
tion,  two  case  vignettes  present  the 
application  of  music  therapy  for  a 
child  with  leukemia  and  an  adult 
patient with breast cancer.
results: We found a total of 12 clini-
cal  studies  conducted  between  2001 
and 2011 comprised of a total of 922 
patients. Eight studies had a random-
ized controlled design, and four stud-
ies  were  conducted  in  the  field  of 
pediatric  oncology.  Studies  reported 
heterogeneous  results  on  short-term 
improvements in patients’ mood and 
relaxation  and  reduced  exhaustion 
and anxiety as well as in coping with 
the  disease  and  cancer-related  pain. 
Case  descriptions  showed  similar 
effects in expressing emotions, open-
ing  up  new  goals,  and  turning  the 
mind  toward  a  healthy  process  and 
away form a disease-centered focus. 

Conclusion:  The use of music thera-
py  in  the  integrative  treatment  of 
cancer  patients  is  a  therapeutic 
option  whose  salutogenetic  poten-
tial  is  shown  in  many  case  studies 
such  as  those  presented  here.  Study 
results, however, did not draw a con-
clusive picture of the overall effect of 
music therapy. In addition to further 
clinical  trials,  the  evidence  mosaic 
should be complemented with quali-
tative  studies,  single  case  descrip-
tions, and basic research.

background 

Music therapy is one of the oldest forms of cre-
ative  art  therapy  and  has  been  used  in  healing  cere-
monies  in  ancient  practices  as  a  specific  medium  of 
communication and expression. In fact, some of the 
earliest  notable  references  in  Western  history  are 
found  in  the  writings  of  the  ancient  Greek  philoso-
phers Aristotle and Plato.1 In contemporary Western 
history,  one  of  the  first  connections  of  music  to 
medicine  was  described  in  the  1749  book  Reflections 
on  the  Power  of  Music  by  Richard  Bocklesby,2  who 
picked  up  the  Greek  tradition  of  music  therapy  and 
compared  it  to  popular  music  of  that  time,  namely 
the compositions of Handel. While concentrating on 
mental illnesses, he also noted the positive effects of 
music  for  the  elderly  by  describing  how  it  revived 
“their spirits every day with a good piece of music.”3 
Although this episode nowadays seems more or 
less  aphoristic,  music  therapy  in  the  clinical  setting 
quite  early  managed  its  way  into  one  of  the  leading 
journals,  The  Lancet.  In  1891,  a  series  of  letters 
described  and  discussed  the  approach  of  a  group  of 
musicians providing live music to patients in London 
hospitals  who  together  with  the  physicians  were 
asked to describe “the outcomes of experiments with 
‘soothing’  and  ‘exhilarating’  music.”4  From  that 
point,  music  therapy  established  itself  as  a  recog-
nized  health  profession  in  the  clinical  context.  One 
century  later,  music  therapy  was  introduced  in  the 
field of palliative care in 1978 by Munro and Mount, 
who  used  “receptive  and  recreative  methods  to  pro-
mote relaxation and encourage the expression of dif-
ficult  feelings.”5,6  Today,  several  systematic  reviews 
and  meta-analyses  have  shown  the  effects  of  music 
therapy in different clinical and therapeutic settings, 
such  as  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia,7  pain,8 
cardiovascular parameters,9 and dementia.10 In addi-
tion  to  these  therapeutic  fields,  music  therapy  has 
seen  a  variety  of  applications  in  the  treatment  of 
cancer patients.11 

This article provides an overview of some of the 
recent  findings  in  this  field  and  includes  two  single 
case  vignettes,  which  offer  more  insight  into  the 
application of day-to-day clinical music therapy. 

materials and methods 

For the collection of clinical studies of music ther-
apy in oncology, the following databases were searched: 
AMED,  CAIRSS,  EMBASE,  MEDLINE,  PsychINFO,  and 
PSYNDEX.  The  search  terms  were  “Study  OR  Trial” 
AND  “Music  Therapy”  AND  “Cancer  OR  Oncolog$.” 
Studies were then analyzed with respect to study design, 
setting  and  interventions,  date  of  publication,  indica-
tions, patients, and main outcomes.

results

We found a total of 12 clinical studies conducted 
between 2001 and 2011, involving a total of 922 patients 
(Table). Eight studies were randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs), and four were observational studies. Four stud-
ies were conducted in the field of pediatric oncology, of 
which two were RCTs. Both type and grading of cancer 
were  heterogeneous  throughout  all  studies.  Active 
music  making  (n = 7)  as  well  as  listening  programs 
(n = 5)  were  applied  as  additional  treatment  after  sur-
gery  or  chemotherapy  to  improve  the  patient’s  situa-
tion.  Studies  reported  on  short-term  improvements  in 
patients’ mood and relaxation and reduced exhaustion 
and  anxiety  as  well  as  in  coping  with  the  disease  and 
cancer-related pain.

tHe treatment of CanCer patIents

For the case vignettes, we decided to report on two 
contrasting sides of clinical practice with epidemiologi-
cal  importance:  leukemia  in  pediatric  oncology  and 
breast  cancer  in  adult  oncology.  Both  patients  were 
treated  in  the  Community  Hospital  in  Herdecke, 
Germany. Examples of the types of instruments used in 
the  music  therapy  program  are  pictured  in  Figures  1 
through  5.  Patients  or  their  legal  representatives  con-
sented to have their de-identified data published in a case 
report.  The  reporting  of  single  cases  adhered  to  the 
description for cognition-based medicine applied in the 
single case.12

school. She was admitted to the Community Hospital 
Herdecke  in  Germany,  where  her  parents  took  turns 
staying with her.

Music  therapy  was  prescribed  concomitant  with 
to  her  in-patient  chemotherapy  treatments,  which 
lasted  6  months.  The  30-minute  sessions  took  place 
three times a week. 

Chemotherapy had taken its toll on her body: a hat 
covered  her  bald  head.  The  child  appeared  weak  and 
expressed sadly that she had never been to school. She 
was excited about the music therapy, especially as she 
had little contact with any of the other children on the 

ward due to the high risk of infection. Her doctors gave 
permission for her to visit the music therapy room with 
a  surgical  mask  and  while  still  receiving  her  intrave-
nous medication.

treatment. Once in the therapy room, the patient tried 
all kinds of instruments without hesitation. She finally 
selected  a  lyre  with  pentatonic  tuning,  chime  bars  in 
tune  with  the  lyre,  and  wind  chimes.  The  therapist 
accompanied her on the piano.

The  patient  also  enjoyed  improvising  on  the 
drums. She played a large jungle drum, a Darbuka, and

a  Korean  drum;  the  therapist—again  playing  the 
piano—responded to her rhythmic motifs using tunes 
based  on  Asian  and  Latin-American  modalities. 
Drumming  together  with  the  therapist,  the  patient 
invented her own lyrics and melodies in creative dia-
logues with the therapist. 

After  a  few  sessions,  the  patient  began  bringing 
songs from her daily life into the sessions. The lyrics and 
melodies of these songs reminded her of home and past 
experiences. Soon, a small repertoire of fairytale and folk 
songs emerged, which the patient enthusiastically pre-
sented to her parents and took back with her to the ward.
Another  meaningful  experience  involved  playing 
the crwth, a bowed string instrument also known as the 
Irish harp (Figure 1). The patient conscientiously prac-
ticed  bowing  the  open  strings  and  then  described  the 
sensation  of  the  resulting  vibrations  as  they  passed 
through the instrument into her body.

outcome. At times, the patient sank into a world of her 
own sounds, a world not dictated by illness but one in 
which  she  was  allowed  to  be  “healthy.”  The  rhythmic 
and  sweeping  music  styles  seemed  to  invigorate  her; 
she laughed and danced through the room. 

On one occasion, the patient appeared weak and joy-
less at the beginning of a session. She walked over to a 
table with a set of chromatic chime bars and began play-
ing immediately. Her music sounded off-key and atonal, 
which did not seem to bother her. On the contrary, she 
improvised  a  piece  reflective  of  her  mood.  Soon  she 
switched  to  other  instruments  and  played  these  in  a 
similar  fashion,  seemingly  “unloading”  herself.  Once 
again,  the  therapist  accompanied  her  on  the  piano,  fol-
lowing  the  patient’s  conflicted  emotions  as  expressed 
through frictional sounds and pulsating rhythms. 

Despite her lively and outgoing demeanor during 
the majority of the music therapy sessions, the patient 
frequently felt quite poorly. She struggled not only with 
the side effects of the chemotherapy but also with the 
emotional burden of being ill: the nurses reported that 
she cried in secret so as not to cause additional distress 
to her family. In attempting to shield her parents, she 
put herself under enormous pressure. 

During  her  session  of  off-key  playing,  the  patient 
appeared  to  let  her  imagination  and  with  it  her  emo-
tions, pain, anger, and fear run wild as reflected by her 
music.  Afterward,  she  seemed  relaxed.  Her  tension 
seemed to have dissipated.

Conclusion.  In  addition  to  their  somatic  problems,  in-
patient pediatric cancer patients suffer due to the loss of 
their regular settings and structures. Their clinical day-to-
day experiences are dictated by medical care and proce-
dures. They are also acutely aware of the extreme tensions 
to  which  their  families  are  subjected.  They  frequently 
attempt to lighten their relatives’ emotional load. 

Music  therapy  accompanied  this  patient  along  her 
journey as she navigated her disease; it provided her with 
a bit of normalcy while also offering an arena for interac-

tried to hide.

Germany,  where  she  was  assigned  to  music  therapy. 
She had a history of cancer with a mamma carcinoma 
in one breast and a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
at age 19 and again at age 24. The patient had received 
outpatient  psychotherapy  for  a  number  of  years.  
During  her  3-week  in-patient  treatment,  the  patient 
had eight individual therapy sessions with an average 
length of 40 minutes. 

treatment.  Initially,  the  patient  did  not  want  to  play 
the  instruments.  During  the  course  of  treatment,  she 
did  manage  to  try  out  a  percussion  instrument  (bon-
gos).  A  positive  turnaround  followed  the  decision  to 
focus  on  the  patient’s  singing  voice.  Surprisingly,  the 
patient  did  not  dismiss  the  suggestion  but  agreed  to 
vocal improvisations. 

In  the  first  session,  the  patient  cried  when  she 
saw the instruments. She said, “This is too emotional 
for me” and explained that she did not want to play at 
all due to the unattainable standards set by her own 
perfectionism. 

The  human  voice  is  the  body’s  own  instrument 
and can express both the mood and mental state of the 
singer,  thus  directly  revealing  something  personal 
about oneself. This is one reason why many patients—
unconsciously—are reluctant to sing. 

After her first vocal improvisation, the patient relat-
ed that she had experienced herself as a “whole” or “com-
plete”  person  throughout  the  chanting.  This  perception 
utterly surprised, overwhelmed, and gratified her. 

Over  the  course  of  the  therapy,  the  patient  and 
therapist  worked  extensively  on  the  patient’s  vocal 
expressiveness and on songs to which she improvised 
her own part. Toward the end of her stay, she remarked 
that she wished to continue singing and that she was 
deeply  moved  by  the  novel  feeling  of  inner  connec-
tion  to  herself.  While  still  at  the  clinic,  the  patient 
made  inquires  about  choirs  and  a  singing  teacher  in 
her hometown.

outcome.  The  patient  played  the  bongos  in  a  rigid 
manner, making it impossible for the therapist to join 
in  on  her  playing  and  thus  prohibiting  the  develop-
ment of a musical relationship. The patient cried, “This 
is  my  problem,  trying  to  hold  on  to  the  past.”  She 
believed  that  psychotherapy  had  helped  her  to  recog-
nise her problems but said that this was “not enough.” 
She  explained  that  in  her  daily  experience,  her  mind 
and  her  emotions  were  two  separate  entities,  and  she 
seemed unable to synchronize the two.

A  solo,  monosyllabic  melody  based  on  very  few 
tones grew out of the vocal improvisation. The therapist 
supported  and  accompanied  the  singing  on  the  piano. 
Sitting in a corner of the room, the patient initially cried 
bitterly but carried on singing. During the course of the 
20-minute improvisation, her chanting became lighter, 
the key changed from minor to major, and the range was 
extended.  Melodic  motives  and  repeatable  phrases

emerged. The patient’s singing matured into a musical 
form, becoming a creative, purposeful activity. 

In music therapy, the patient was able to

reconnect  with  her  emotions,  from  which  she  previ-
ously had felt painfully cut off. Central to this experi-
ence were the vocal improvisations. 

Often  it  is  the  chronically  ill  patients  in  music 
therapy  who  experience  the  strengthening  and  ener-
gizing  results  of  their  own  creativity.  Patients  who 
regularly feel helpless in the face of their disease can, 
through the process of active music making, be assured 
of their own self-efficacy. Such experiences, the likes of 
which the patient described above enjoyed, can create 
positive perspectives that in turn can change the per-
ceived significance of, and relation to, the illness.

Creative therapies like painting, speech therapy, 
healing eurythmy dance therapy, and music therapy 
frequently  are  used  in  the  treatment  of  cancer 
patients.25-27  Particularly  in  the  last  decade,  several 
studies  have  concentrated  on  the  investigation  of 
effects of music therapy in cancer patients. The use of 
music therapy in the integrative treatment of cancer 
patients is a therapeutic option whose salutogenetic

potential is demonstrated in many case studies such 
as those presented here. Study results, however, did 
not draw a conclusive picture of the overall effect of 
music therapy. This might be due to methodological 
boundaries  and  pitfalls  closely  connected  with  the 
music therapy process. First of all, due to the special 
connection  between  music  therapist  and  patient, 
blinding 
an  unsolvable  problem. 
Additionally, crossover studies, which are often per-
formed in such situations, have high barriers mainly 
with  respect  to  organizing  and  patient  compliance. 
In  particular,  patients  often  decisively  choose  inte-
grative inpatient treatment and thus might refuse to 
be  randomized  into  a  waiting  control  group. 
Therefore,  more  than  in  other  disciplines,  method-
ological  considerations  before  planning  a  study  are 
of high importance in music therapy.25 

In addition to clinical trials, the evidence mosaic 
should  be  complemented  by  qualitative  studies  and 
single  case  descriptions,  which  consider  the  patient-
centered  approach  of  music  therapy.26  In  addition  to 
the  clinical  setting,  other  types  of  health  services  for 
cancer  patients  such  as  home-based  music  therapy27 
also  should  be  considered.  Finally,  the  underlying 
mechanisms  should  be  investigated  to  derive  a  more 
conclusive hypothesis.28
