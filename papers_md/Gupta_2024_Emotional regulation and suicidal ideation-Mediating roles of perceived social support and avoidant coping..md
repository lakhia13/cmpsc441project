Introduction: Recent research has uncovered a wide prevalence variation of
suicidal ideation in university students ranging from 9.7% to 58.3%. India has
witnessed a 4.5% increase in suicide rates in the year 2021. The interplay between
cognitive reappraisal of a stressful situation, suppression of emotional expression,
and coping strategies for suicidal ideation of Indian University students is yet to
be explored. We aim to determine whether suicidal ideation would differ across
different types of family units, and to predict the extent to which perceived
social support and avoidant coping could mediate the relation between emotion
regulation processes and suicidal ideation.
Methods: Two hundred randomly selected University students (Mean age = 19.9,
SD = 1.43) participated. Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson’s product-moment correlation,
and GLM mediation model were computed.

Results and discussion: Lifetime suicidal ideation signiﬁcantly differed between
those who stay alone and those who live in a nuclear family (p < 0.01), and
also those who stay in a joint family (p < 0.05). Cognitive reappraisal predicted a
reduction in suicidal ideation mediated by perceived social support (B = −0.06,
p < 0.05) and avoidant coping (B = −0.07, p < 0.05). Whereas, expressive
suppression predicted induced levels of suicidal
ideation through perceived
social support (B = 0.05, p < 0.05), and avoidant coping (B = 0.06, p < 0.05)
as mediators.

Conclusion: Though our sample size restricts the generalization, our ﬁndings
implied the importance of regular psychological consultation regarding the
efficacy of the said coping processes in dealing with suicidal ideation.

Introduction

In recent years, the alarming increase in suicide rates has become a pressing public
health concern, casting a dark shadow over the wellbeing of societies worldwide (World
Health Organization, 2020). Particularly, within the educational landscape, suicide has
emerged as a poignant issue, with its prevalence soaring among young individuals, making
it the leading cause of death among youths in India (Vijayakumar et al., 2019). A recently
published meta-analysis showed a wide range (9.7% to 58.3%) of suicidal ideation rates
among university students (Crispim et al., 2021). The latest data from the National Crime
Records Bureau underscores this grim reality, revealing a 4.5% increase in suicide rates in
the year 2021 (Verma, 2022) and has revealed that the second highest number of suicides

(32.8%) in India is between 18 to 30 years of age. Suicide is
an intentional eﬀort causing one’s own death with an awareness
of the probable consequence (Lee et al., 2008; Song and Bae,
2020). Suicidal ideation is a broad term often involving a sense of
contemplation and preoccupation with death and especially with
suicide (Harmer et al., 2024). Suicidal ideation ranges from abstract
thoughts about death (passive ideation) to having a speciﬁc (active
ideation) suicidal plan (Song and Bae, 2020).

The transition to college and university demands signiﬁcant
change in the sense of independence, social demands and academic
challenges amidst reduced levels of parental support (Holdaway
et al., 2018), resulting in the exacerbation of psychological
complexities (Akram et al., 2020; Karyotaki et al., 2020). The classic
interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010;
Carpenter et al., 2015) poses much relevance in this context. It
is the simultaneous presence of the two interpersonal constructs,
namely, thwarted belongingness (sense of loneliness, having fewer
friends) and perceived burdensomeness (a sense of liability to
the parents) at this transitional phase that contributes to suicidal
desires. The presence of either the thwarted sense of belongingness
or burdensomeness can induce passive suicidal ideation; whereas,
in the case of the presence of both factors, active suicidal ideation
can be reinforced and may even lead to suicidal behavior (Song
and Bae, 2020). The need for acceptance and recognition by their
peers, perceived turmoil in interpersonal relationships, and fear
of negative evaluations are often found to be valid predictors
ideation (Preston et al., 2022). Due to such fears
of suicidal
and concerns, students often start to neglect social interaction,
resulting in restricted social and psychological functioning, and
even suicidal thoughts (Preston et al., 2022). Previous studies put
much emphasis on the suicidal ideation of university students
(Bernanke et al., 2017; Akram et al., 2020; Tasnim et al., 2020;
Pillay, 2021) uncovering psychological problems (Cvetkovski et al.,
2017) and especially explored possible factors associated with the
risk of suicide, including depression (contributing 47% to 74% of
risk), substance abuse, eating disorders, and schizophrenia (Yin
et al., 2020; Correll et al., 2022; Favril et al., 2022). Baldini et al.
(2023) in their recent meta-analysis found that the exposure to
adverse childhood experiences strongly increases the probability of
a suicidal attempt in individuals having schizophrenia spectrum
disorders. Miola et al. (2023) further highlighted how psychiatric
hospitalization, self harm, and nicotine use can independently
contribute to suicidal thoughts and attempts in individuals having
ﬁrst episode mania or psychosis. Nonetheless, there remains a
need to uncover the potential roles of adaptive and maladaptive
coping processes to deal with suicidal ideation and its connection
to emotional regulation.

Coping is a cognitive and behavioral tactic to reduce stress
by ﬁnding ways to endure and minimize the impact of a stress-
inducing situation and any associated negative emotions (Al-
Dajani et al., 2022). Research has explored how coping strategies
adapt in response to changes in stressors and life events (Cepuch
et al., 2023). Less use of coping and problem solving initiatives
often heighten the chance of suicidal ideation (Tang and Qin,
2015). Maladaptive coping strategies like disengaging behavior,
passive coping, denial, substance use, self-blame, avoidant coping,
and passive coping have been found to positively associate with
suicidality (Chou et al., 2018; Nicoar˘a et al., 2023). Denial is often

used as an avoidant coping strategy, and studies demonstrate a
positive relationship between such maladaptive coping and suicidal
ideation (Horwitz et al., 2018; Werbart Törnblom et al., 2021). The
perception of avoidant coping as a maladaptive one its contribution
in suicidal ideation is still inconclusive. Ample studies suggest that
avoidant coping is often perceived as a refuge from the problem
situation, hence those individuals are liable to quit or withdraw
eﬀorts to reduce stressors (Blankstein et al., 2007; Woodhead et al.,
2014); whereas others suggest avoidant coping as a temporary
shift of focus to other important facets which may reduce the
occurrence of suicidal thoughts (Wang et al., 2007; Miotto and
Preti, 2008). On the other hand, perceived social support, which has
been classically considered an adaptive and healthy coping process,
has been found to negatively associate with avoidant coping and
positively associate with adaptive coping strategies among college
students (Calvete and Connor-Smith, 2007). In a study of Chinese
college students, Cheng et al. (2020) found perceived social support
from family members to be a stronger predictor of lower levels
of suicidal ideation than perceived social support from friends.
College students displaying higher levels of perceived social support
showed better emotion regulation abilities along with reduced
anxiety and depressive symptoms (Shi, 2021). Further, Perceived
parental support was found to associate with lower levels of suicidal
ideation among adolescents from nuclear families (Takizawa et al.,
2017).

The ability to modify an individual’s appraisal of a situation,
emotional state, or the emotional signiﬁcance of a situation
establishes cognitive reappraisal as an eﬀective emotion regulation
strategy (Gross, 2014). Emotion regulation is often conceptualized
as experiencing the control over emotional experience and
expression (Gratz and Roemer, 2004). An adaptive emotion
regulation involves modulating the intensity and magnitude of
an emotional experience rather than inhibiting inappropriate
ones (Thompson and Calkins, 1996; Gratz and Roemer, 2004).
Diﬃculties in regulation of emotion were associated with a range
of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and
borderline personality disorder (Berking et al., 2019). Cognitive
reappraisal, having the ability to modify an individual’s appraisal of
a situation, has been found to moderate the relationship between
perceived social support and suicidal ideation. A recent meta-
analysis on the role of emotion regulation on suicidal ideation
found mindfulness and cognitive appraisal to be adaptive strategies
to regulate emotion and suppression of emotional expression;
avoidance and broadening were considered to be maladaptive
emotional regulation processes (Rogier et al., 2024).

Family structure is often found to be associated with
ideation (Jadav, 2020).
the propensity to experience suicidal
Ahookhosh et al. (2017) found that individuals from nuclear
families had a lower risk of suicidal ideation compared to those
from joint families. Another study found that individuals living
alone had a higher risk of suicidal ideation compared to those
living in nuclear or joint families (Olfson et al., 2022). In a
study of Chinese university students, Chu et al. (2021) found
that higher levels of perceived social support were associated
with lower levels of suicidal ideation with stress as the mediator.
Modernity-driven changes in family structure, perception of being
neglected or ignored by parents, excessive use of social media, a
history of childhood trauma were often identiﬁed as suicide related

and publication of anonymized data. Respondents exclusively
comprised students enrolled in either undergraduate or post-
graduate programs at universities in Kolkata (Mean age = 19.9
and SD = 1.43). Participants were randomly sampled to ensure
a representative and unbiased sample from the target population.
Individuals with a documented history of neurotic and psychotic
spectrum disorder diagnosed by a certiﬁed clinical psychologist or
a psychiatrist were intentionally excluded from the administration
of the questionnaires. Explicit informed consent was obtained
from all participants before the direct administration of the
aforementioned scales. Data acquisition transpired in an oﬄine
mode, facilitated by the distribution of hard-copy questionnaires.
All procedures performed in studies involving human participants
were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional
research committee [DRC-AIPSK/ETHICS/A91316621022] and
with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or
comparable ethical standards.

Measures

Brief-COPE

The Brief-COPE, a concise 28-item scale, measures coping
strategies via a 4-point Likert scale. It is a condensed version of
the initial 60-item COPE scale that was theoretically constructed
based on diﬀerent coping mechanisms (Carver, 1997). It assesses
problem-focused coping (“I take action”), emotion-focused coping
(“I focus on something else”), and avoidant coping (“I avoid
reminders”). Higher scores denote increased usage of respective
strategies. In this study, subscale Cronbach’s alpha values are
0.73 for problem-focused, 0.61 for emotion-focused, and 0.68
for avoidant coping. The total coping score yields a Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.75. These values signify moderate to acceptable internal
consistency. The instrument eﬃciently captures diverse coping
mechanisms in stressful situations.

Emotion regulation questionnaire

The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) devised by
Gross and John (2003), gauges cognitive reappraisal and expressive
suppression strategies through 10 items on a 7-point Likert scale.
Cognitive reappraisal items (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10) focus on altering
thoughts for positive emotions (for example, “When I want to feel
less negative emotion . . . . I change what I’m thinking about”), while
expressive suppression items (2, 4, 6, 9) assess emotion concealment
(for example, “I keep my emotions to myself ”). Higher scores
indicate greater strategy use. Among Indian college students, the
ERQ exhibited high internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
In the present study, cognitive reappraisal scored 0.79, expressive
suppression 0.71, and ERQ total 0.74, showcasing robust reliability.

Multidimensional scale of perceived social
support

The MSPSS, developed by Zimet et al.

(1988), gauges
perceptions of social support (for example, “There is a special
person who is around when I am in need”) with 12 items on a
7-point Likert scale ranging from “very strongly disagree” (1) to
“very strongly agree” (7). Subscales include family, friends, and

risk factors (Kar, 2010; Bhosle et al., 2015; Senapati et al., 2024)
in India.

Previous work has explored the interplay between emotional
ideation (Jose and
regulation, coping processes, and suicidal
Angelina, 2020; Wastler and Núñez, 2022). A recently published
article reviews and explains how the inability to cope with daily
life stressors, the absence of peer group or family support, and
not having kin around often have a debilitating eﬀect on suicidal
ideation (Senapati et al., 2024). At this standpoint our study aims
to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the extent
to which cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression predict
suicidal ideation while considering perceived social support and
avoidant coping as potential mediating factors. Our results explore
the extent to which these studied coping processes can be found
responsible in inducing or reducing suicidal ideation. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on university students in the
Indian subcontinent exploring the associations of coping strategies
with the aforementioned variables.
Our study’s objectives are:

i) To assess the extent to which suicidal ideation diﬀers across

diﬀerent types of family units;

ii) To quantify and describe any associations among coping
style, emotional regulation, perceived social support, and
suicidal ideation; and

iii) To explore the extent to which perceived social support and
avoidant coping act as mediators of the associations between
cognitive reappraisal and suicidal ideation as well as between
expressive suppression of emotion and suicidal ideation.

Suicide behaviors questionnaire revised

SBQ-R by Osman et al. (2001) comprises four items, addressing
various aspects of suicidality. The Likert scale diﬀers for all the four
items. Item 1 explores past suicidal thoughts/attempts. The scale
ranges from “Never” (1) to “Have attempted . . . hoped to die” (4b).
Item 2 assesses the frequency of suicidal thoughts in the past 12
months where the scale ranges from “Never” (1) to “Very often”
(5), and item 3 evaluates the threat of a suicide attempt ranging
from “No” (1) to “Yes, more than once. . . .” (3). Item 4 gauges
self-reported propensity for future suicidal behavior, with a scale
ranging from “Never” (0) to “Very likely” (6). The total score is the
aggregate of the scores of all the four items. In this study, the SBQ-R
demonstrated a reliability score of 0.8.

Procedure

Participants were randomly chosen. All the above-mentioned
scales were administered directly to the participants only after
receiving informed consent. Data was collected oﬄine through
hard-copies of questionnaires with distractions minimized.
Adequate rest periods were given between the administration
of diﬀerent tests to avoid fatigue. Doubt(s), if any, regarding
the questionnaires were cleared. For the grouping, analysis, and
interpretation of data, Microsoft Excel, Jamovi (version 2.3.26.0),

Analysis

The mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for
quantitative variables as descriptive statistics. To ensure robustness
against observed departures from the assumptions of parametric
one-way ANOVA, a non-parametric alternative, the Kruskal-Wallis
test, was employed to test for an association between diﬀerent
family unit types and the variables deﬁned in Table 2. To investigate
the relationships among variables, Pearson’s product moment
correlation was computed. Given the nature of these variables,
Spearman’s rank correlation was also computed and yielded nearly
identical results. Finally, a mediation model was used to determine
if social support and avoidant coping could mediate the association
of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression with suicidal
ideation, and further, if mediated, whether the mediation was
complete or partial. The mediation model results were robust to
various choices of variable transformation or response distribution
for possibly right-skewed data; the article presents results using the
standard linear model formulation.

For the veriﬁcation of our ﬁrst objective, non-parametric one-
way ANOVA was conducted (Table 2). The results demonstrate
that the type of family unit a student belongs to has a signiﬁcant
association with lifetime suicidal ideation and/or attempt (χ 2

signiﬁcant associations with family unit type. Despite varying levels
of statistical signiﬁcance, for all four considered response variables
we provide the mean diﬀerence in score across each pairwise
comparison of family unit type. These are accompanied by 95%
conﬁdence intervals obtained via bootstrapping in order to allow
a more holistic assessment of the strength and precision of our
observed associations.

Relationships between the stated variables

To quantify and test the signiﬁcance of measured relationships
between variables, the Pearson Product-Moment correlation was

computed for each variable pair. Signiﬁcant positive correlations
were identiﬁed between problem-focused coping and number
including cognitive reappraisal (r = 0.264, p <
of variables,
0.001), total social support score (r = 0.23, p < 0.001), and
emotion-focused coping (r = 0.37, p < 0.001). Emotion-focused
coping further demonstrated noteworthy positive relationships
with avoidant coping (r = 0.363, p < 0.001), lifetime suicidal
ideation (r = 0.224, p < 0.001), and total suicidal
ideation
score (r = 0.243, p < 0.001). Lastly, avoidant coping displays
signiﬁcant negative associations with cognitive reappraisal (r =
−0.185, p < 0.01) and social support total score (r = −0.283,
p < 0.001), but signiﬁcant positive associations with expressive
suppression (r = 0.147, p < 0.05), lifetime suicidal ideation (r =
0.314, p < 0.001), and suicidal ideation total score (r = 0.405, p
< 0.001). Figure 4 displays a correlation plot for variable pairs,
and the full set of correlation values and p-value are shown

Application of the mediation model

To deconstruct the observed set of correlations with total
suicidal
ideation and explore the possibility of mediation by
avoidant coping and total social support, both mediation and path
estimates (Table 5) were calculated according to the model depicted
in Figure 5.

FIGURE 4
Correlation plot of the Pearson correlation for each variable pair. For
each pair, the circle size and color match the Pearson correlation
value as indicated by the color bar on the right side of the ﬁgure.

Speciﬁcally, we applied mediation analysis to assess the role
of Perceived Social Support (SS Total) in the connection between
Cognitive Reappraisal (CR) and Suicidal Ideation (SIT), as well
as between Expressive Suppression (ES) and SIT. Results (refer to
Table 4) indicated signiﬁcant total eﬀects of ES (Estimate = 0.12, ß
= 0.14, t = 2.05, p < 0.05) and CR (Estimate = −0.13, ß = −0.23, t
= −3.24, p = 0.001) on SIT. However, upon introducing SS Total as
a mediating variable, the direct eﬀects of ES and CR on SIT became
non-signiﬁcant. Notably, the indirect associations through SS Total
were signiﬁcant for both ES (Estimate = 0.037, ß = 0.049, t = 2.29,
p < 0.05) and CR (Estimate = −0.032, ß = −0.058, t = −2.2, p <
0.05), indicating full mediation of the relationship between ES and
CR on SIT by SS Total.

With the inclusion of AC as a mediating variable, the direct
associations between ES and SIT and between CR and SIT were
not statistically signiﬁcant. The indirect association between ES and
SIT through the mediating variable AC was found to be signiﬁcant
(estimate = 0.045, ß = 0.06, t = 2.282, p < 0.05). Similarly, the
indirect association between CR and SIT through the mediating
variable AC was also found to be signiﬁcant (Estimate = −0.039,
ß = −0.071, t = −2.520, p < 0.05). These results support the
notion that AC fully mediates the relationships between ES and
SIT as well as between CR and SIT. Table 4 shows the full set of
mediation estimates between cognitive reappraisal (CR), expressive
suppression (ES), perceived social support (SS Total), avoidant
coping (AC), and suicidal ideation (SIT).

Discussion

Our study throws lights on the probable association between

explored the contributions of adaptive and maladaptive coping
styles mediating the relationship between emotion regulation
strategies and suicidal ideation. Our study revealed a signiﬁcant
thoughts among students in diﬀerent
diﬀerence in suicidal
household types, aligning with previous ﬁndings (Freudenstein
et al., 2011; Paashaus et al., 2019) associating family dynamics with
suicidal ideation. Parental rejection, parental low care levels, and
living away from parents have been identiﬁed as risk factors for
having self-destructive thoughts (Cruz et al., 2013; Donath et al.,
2014; Yang et al., 2022). The positive association between living
alone and incidence of suicidal thoughts was echoed in our results,
as post-hoc testing indicated that this living status displayed higher
scores in this metric than did the other two household types. A
study done by Shaw et al. (2021) yielded similar results, showing
that, living alone was one of the risk factors associated with suicidal
ideation among students. According to Andriessen et al. (2019),
social isolation, including living alone, is a risk factor for suicidal
ideation among students. Our result showed some similarity with
these ﬁndings showing a risk for college students who live outside
their own family even if it had been a nuclear one.

Signiﬁcant correlations were observed between avoidance
coping and increased suicide risk and between cognitive reappraisal
and reduced suicidal risk, consistent with existing literature (Ong
and Thompson, 2019). Avoidance of a diﬃcult situation only delays
the inevitable, and even aggravates the situation. It does not address
the problem and acts as a temporary respite. Increased emotional
suppression is signiﬁcantly related to lower levels of social support
and social wellbeing, which is also consistent with recent ﬁndings
(Chervonsky and Hunt, 2017). Decreased parental support was
found to be signiﬁcantly related to suicidal ideation and attempts.
A study by Miller et al. (2015) reported that likelihood of suicidal
attempts was higher to those who felt that friends provided very

little assistance and backing. Our study supported this ﬁnding as
well. Research suggests that individuals who are better able to use
cognitive reappraisal are less likely to experience suicidal ideation,
as they are better able to cope with stress and negative emotions by
using their brain power to see things from a diﬀerent perspective
and deal with them in newer and innovative ways (Franz et al.,
2021). This is also aligned with our study.

indicated increased suicidal ideation via a reduction in perceived
social support.

On the other hand, by modifying or altering an individual’s
appraisal of a situation or emotional state, cognitive appraisal has
often been found to associate with lowered suicidal risk, and studies
have demonstrated the role of cognitive reappraisal in moderating
the eﬀect of depressive symptoms on perceiving social support
(Ong and Thompson, 2019; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2021). Owen
et al. (2021) showed a signiﬁcant meditational pathway between
perceived social support and changes in suicidal ideation over
time through making changes in the sense of defeat, entrapment,
and hopelessness.

Individuals employing avoidant coping show a tendency
to refrain from confronting problem situations and addressing
stressors, often correlate with a higher risk of suicidality (Liang
et al., 2020). Strategies like substance use, denial, and behavioral
as well as mental disengagements are avoidant coping strategies
of a maladaptive type (Ong and Thompson, 2019), whereas
active coping processes like perceived social support
involve
attempts to resolve stressors. Our study revealed that suppression
of emotional and behavioral expression positively correlate with
avoidant coping, which is in turn associated with higher levels of
suicidal ideation. Conversely, cognitive reappraisal, recognizing the
probable harm that the stressor could inﬂict, negatively correlates
with avoidant coping, thus associating with reduced levels of
suicidal
ideation. The signiﬁcant associations and mediating
roles for perceived social support and avoidant coping found
in our analyses emphasize the importance of adaptive coping
strategies and their potential to amplify or diminish the eﬀect
of stressors.

Conclusion

Data availability statement

The analyses of our three deﬁned objectives yielded statistically
signiﬁcant ﬁndings, oﬀering valuable insights into the complex
dynamics of suicidal ideation among students. Firstly, the study
revealed a compelling association between the type of family
unit and suicidal
ideation, emphasizing a higher prevalence
among students living alone. This highlights the need for
targeted interventions and support systems for individuals in such
family structures.

Secondly, the intricate interplay among coping styles, emotion
regulation, perceived social
ideation
underscores the multifaceted nature of mental health challenges
faced by students. Identifying these nuanced connections provides
a basis for developing comprehensive mental health programs
tailored to the diverse needs of the student population.

support, and suicidal

Moreover, the observation of complete mediation between
cognitive reappraisal and suicidal
ideation by social support
signals the potential eﬃcacy of targeted interventions focusing on
enhancing social support networks. Strengthening these networks
could be a crucial component of mental health strategies in
academic institutions.

Despite the robust methodology employed with our randomly
selected sample of 200 participants, acknowledging certain
limitations
is crucial. While the sample was meticulously
chosen, a larger and more diverse participant pool would
contribute to the robustness and generalizability of our ﬁndings.
