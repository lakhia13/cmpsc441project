Abstract
Agoraphobia is frequently accompanied by panic disorder and causes considerable suffering. The aim of this study was to compare
clinical features and treatment courses between patients with and without agoraphobia in panic disorder.

In this retrospective study, 87 patients with panic disorder were divided into two groups depending on the presence of
agoraphobia: patients with agoraphobia (PDA, n = 41) and patients without agoraphobia (PD, n = 46). Agoraphobia subscale score of
the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire was used to identify correlations between agoraphobia and panic and affective
symptoms.

The PDA group showed more severe panic and affective symptoms than the PD group. Patients with PDA were more likely to be
younger at the age of onset, take benzodiazepines for longer durations, and be treated with antipsychotics augmentation.
Agoraphobia subscale was associated with panic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and the duration of benzodiazepines use.

The ﬁndings suggest that patients with PDA experienced more severe panic symptoms, more profound psychiatric comorbidity,

and worse illness progression than those with PD.

1. Introduction

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder exhibited by repeated and
sudden panic attacks which include palpitations, sweating,
shortness of breath, chest discomfort, abdominal distress,
dizziness, and fear of dying.[1] Patients with panic disorder
suffer
such as depression,
substance abuse, and suicide ideation.[2–4] Also, individuals in
bereavement often show long-lasting psychological symptoms
including panic attacks.[5,6] Panic disorder frequently occurs with
agoraphobia,[7] which presents with fear and anxiety that caused

by being in a place where it is difﬁcult to get help or escape if a
panic attack or similar symptom occurs.[1]

The relationship between agoraphobia and panic disorder
remains not been clearly established. Regarding this issue, 2
hypotheses have been proposed. It has been suggested that
agoraphobia is a subtype of panic disorder. Grant et al reported
that panic disorder accompanied by agoraphobia could be a severe
complication of panic disorder,[8] and agoraphobia was considered
to result from recurrent panic attacks.[1] On the other hand,
agoraphobia could be a distinct disease independent of panic
disorder.[9,10] Recently, in the DSM-5, agoraphobia has been
separated from panic disorder as an independent condition, based
on the following ﬁndings. Agoraphobia could occur without panic
symptoms,[11] is not always secondary to panic symptoms,[1,12] and
there are differences in prevalence, sex speciﬁc incidence rate, and
treatment outcome between agoraphobia and panic disorder.[11,13]
There are evidences that presence of agoraphobia in panic
disorder patients carries signiﬁcant clinical implications,[14–16]
however, few comprehensive assessment has been reported how
comorbid agoraphobic symptoms affects the patient with panic
disorder in terms of symptoms severity, psychological comorbid-
ity and clinical course. In this study, we aimed to compare the
symptom severity of panic disorder, comorbid psychiatric
symptoms and clinical course including medication between
patients who have panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) and
those with panic disorder alone (PD).

2. Methods

2.1. Study design and participants

The present study is a retrospective study, and the setting was a
university-afﬁliated tertiary hospital. In total, 87 patients who

Shin et al. Medicine (2020) 99:30

Medicine

had recently been diagnosed with panic disorder according to the
DSM-IV-TR, between June 2014 and September 2018 were
included in the study. They were divided into two groups based
on the comorbidity of agoraphobia: PDA (n = 41) and PD (n =
46). Diagnosis of PDA was made for patients who responded
“yes” to Item 4 of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) which
reﬂects agoraphobic fear, and had agoraphobia subscale score
(referred to as “agoraphobia score” in the present study) above
65 in the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ). This
study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of
Konkuk University Hospital, and written informed consent was
waived by the IRB (approval number: KUH 1050107).

2.2. Measurements

Demographic data, the result of psychological tests, and the
information on the treatment course were collected. Psychologi-
cal tests included PDSS, APPQ, anxiety sensitivity index–revised
(ASI-R), beck depression inventory (BDI), state-trait anxiety
inventory (STAI), and Minnesota multiphasic personality
inventory (MMPI).

The PDSS is a standard measurement

scale for panic
disorder.[12,17] The instrument includes 7 items associated with
symptoms accompanied by panic disorder.[17,18] The Korean
version of the PDSS, which proved out good test–retest reliability
(r = 0.96) and inter-rater reliability (r = 0.88),[19] was used in the
study. The APPQ is a scale designed to assess three types of fear
related to panic disorder. The scale consisted of 27 items is
categorized into 3 subscales:

1) agoraphobia,
2) social phobia,
3) and interoceptive fear (i.e., fear of activities that cause painful

bodily sensation).[20]

We used the Korean version of

the APPQ, which was
standardized by Kim et al and has demonstrated high levels of
psychometric qualities.[19,21] The ASI-R is a self-reported question-
naire used to measure the degree of fear arising from believing that
body sensations will produce dangerous consequences. The Korean
version of the ASI-R has been validated and evidenced good test–
retest reliability (r = 0.82) and internal consistency (a = 0.92).[19,22]
The BDI is a self-report checklist for assessing the severity of
depressive symptoms.[23] The 21 items
include emotional,
physiological, and cognitive symptoms of depression.[21] We used
a Korean version of the BDI which has been considered valid and
reliable tool.[19] The STAI is a 40-item self-report instrument to
evaluate anxiety symptoms. The State Anxiety Scale measures the
individual’s current state of anxiety, and the Trait Anxiety Scale
evaluates the individual’s stable tendency toward anxiety.[24] We
adopted the Korean version of the scale, which was translated by
Kim et al and has demonstrated ﬁne psychometric properties.[19,22]
The MMPI is widely used in personality and psychopathology
assessments of patients in clinical settings[25] and was revised
and re-standardized in 1989.[26] The Korean version of the
MMPI-2 was reported to be reliable in assessing personality and
psychological symptoms in Korean adults.[26]

The treatment-related items included benzodiazepines (BZD)
dose, duration of BZD use, total treatment duration, as-needed
BZD use, number of antidepressants used, augmentation
treatment with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics, and hospitali-
zation. Doses of different classes of BZD were compared by the
deﬁned daily dose (DDD), which is the average maintenance dose

per day for a drug used for its main indication and is an
international standard quantitative unit.[27]

2.3. Statistical analysis

Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare continuous
variables such as age, age of onset, years of education, scores for
psychological scales, BZD dose, duration of BZD use, and total
treatment duration. A chi-square test was used to compare
categorical variables such as sex, employment status, as-needed
BZD use, concomitant use of antipsychotics, and hospitalization
between two groups. Augmentation with mood stabilizers was
analyzed by Fisher exact test, and linear by linear association was
used to identify the number of antidepressants prescribed
concomitantly. The relationships between agoraphobia score
and other psychological variables were exhibited using Spear-
man’s rank correlation analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance level was
deﬁned at P < .05.

3. Results
The mean age of PDA onset was 28.8 ± 11.7 years, whereas that
of PD was 34.9 ± 13.0 years (P = .016). In addition, there was a
signiﬁcant difference in age at hospital visit (31.4 ± 11.4 years vs
37.2 ± 13.2 years, P = .018) between two groups. However,
patients with PDA did not differ signiﬁcantly from those with PD
in sex, employment status, and years of education.

The PDA group’s total PDSS score was signiﬁcantly higher
than those of the PD group (17.1 ± 5.3 vs 12.8 ± 5.5, P < .001). In
addition, the agoraphobia score of the APPQ was higher in the
PDA compared to that of PD patients (78.1 ± 8.1 vs 49.6 ± 8.6).
Furthermore, the ASI-R score was signiﬁcantly higher in PDA
(82.6 ± 9.7 vs 65.7 ± 14.4, P < .001). Moreover, the PDA group
showed higher levels of depressive symptoms measured by the

patients (34.1% vs 19.6%, P = .030). Moreover, 4.9% of
participants in the PDA had been prescribed more than three
antidepressants, whereas it had not occurred to any of those in
the PD group. The proportion of patients who had antipsychotics
augmentation therapy was also signiﬁcantly higher in PDA
(41.5% vs 19.6%, P = .026). However, total treatment duration
and BZD doses did not differ signiﬁcantly between the two
groups. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the
proportions of patients who were hospitalized, doses of as-
needed BZD, and the percentage of patients who had received
mood stabilizer augmentation therapy between the two groups
also (Table 2).

The results of correlation analysis between agoraphobia score
and psychological scale scores and treatment course-related items
were shown in Table 3. BDI (rs = 0.527, P < .001), STAI-state
(rs = 0.499, P < .001), PDSS (rs = 0.456, P < .001) scores and the
duration of BZD use (rs = 0.256, P = .017) indicated signiﬁcantly
positive correlation with agoraphobia score.

4. Discussion

The object of this study was to compare demographic character-
istics, severity of symptoms, comorbid symptoms and treatment
courses between patients with and without agoraphobia in panic
disorder. Patients with PDA showed younger age of onset, more
severe panic symptoms, and higher level of affective symptoms
including depression than those with PD. In addition, the PDA
group were more likely to receive combination and augmentation

compared to the PD group. Moreover, the PDA’s agoraphobia
and total PDSS scores were higher than those of the PD group,
which indicates that the PDA patients experienced more severe
panic symptoms than the PD patients.

In this study, PDSS score was positively associated with
agoraphobic score in APPQ. Previous studies also showed that
agoraphobia was related to the severity of panic attacks, distress

and poor functional outcome, and the ﬁndings suggested that
agoraphobia could be a marker of severely aggravated panic
disorder.[13,28] To our best knowledge, we ﬁrstly report that the
severity of agoraphobic symptom is statistically correlated with
the severity of panic symptom, which indicates that panic and
agoraphobic symptoms are strongly associated. However, the
causal relationship between the two symptoms remains not
clearly known. There have been contradictory results about the
temporal relationship between panic symptoms and agorapho-
bia. According to Garvey, agoraphobic avoidance usually started
within a few months after ﬁrst panic attack.[12,29] Clum et al also
suggested that panic attacks was followed by agoraphobia.[30]
On the contrary, some studies have shown that panic disorder
was aggravated by agoraphobia.[28,31] In the present study, we
could not examine the temporal relationship between panic
attack and agoraphobic symptoms, therefore it is difﬁcult to draw
a conclusion on this issue.

In the current study, the PDA patients were more depressed and
it was proved by higher BDI score, depression and social
introversion MMPI scale scores compared to those of the PD
patients. There have been several previous studies have examined
the links between panic disorder, agoraphobia, and depression.
Panic disorder patients with agoraphobia are likely to experience
greater limitations in their work or social lives compared to those
with PD alone, and this could cause depression.[1,15] Clum et al
also suggested that patients with PDA in the state of loss of
control showed “learned helplessness”, because they believed
that there were no useful coping strategies.[30] Choi et al reported
that PDA patients displayed greater self-criticism and fatalism
than those with PD alone.[32] In addition, we found that patients
with PDA had more severe anxiety, even when they were not
experiencing a panic attack, and exhibited higher STAI score,
ASI-R score and psychasthenia MMPI scale than patients with
PD. According to Ken et al, panic disorder patients with high
anxiety sensitivity and trait anxiety were more likely to detect
agoraphobic fear rapidly.[28] Regarding anxiety sensitivity,
Chambless found that the severity of fear of bodily sensation
increases when panic disorder was accompanied by agorapho-
bia.[33] Anxiety sensitivity may contribute to trigger panic attacks
and could directly amplify agoraphobia and enhance avoidance
in patients with PD.[10,34] Few studies have compared MMPI in
panic disorder patients with and without agoraphobia. One study
revealed that PDA patients’ psychasthenia score was higher than
those with PD,[35] which is consistent with the current ﬁndings.
Overall, patients with PDA are prone to more affective symptoms
compared to patients with PD.

The onset of disease was earlier in patients with PDA than PD
in our study, and this ﬁnding is consistent with previous
studies.[12,15,30] Panic disorder patients with more earlier onset
have a higher genetic tendency and are more likely to experience

4

agoraphobia and other comorbidities compared to those with
late disease onset.[36] Moreover, greater familial loading has been
related with earlier onset age of PDA.[12,37,38] Although the
DSM-5 classiﬁes panic disorder and agoraphobia as independent
disorders, the genetic association between panic disorder and
agoraphobia implies that there could be a close pathophysiologi-
cal relationship between the 2 diseases.[7,8]

The PDA group was more likely to be prescribed combined
antidepressant treatment and antipsychotic augmentation than
PD group. In addition, they were prone to be prescribed BZD for
longer duration than PD group. This suggests that patients with
PDA show poorer prognosis than patients with PD. Evidence also
shows that PDA patients are more difﬁcult to be treated and
exhibit higher recurrence rate than the PD.[14,39] Brook et al
reported that 35% of patients with PDA took BZD whereas only
8% of patient with PD were prescribed BZD.[40] Tiller also
reported that doses of BZD and antidepressants to alleviate
symptoms in patients with PDA were higher than those for
patients with PD only.[41] Antipsychotic augmentation for the
treatment of panic disorder in relation with agoraphobia has not
been reported previously. Evidence support that antidepressants
augmented with atypical antipsychotics could result in a superior
therapeutic effect than antidepressant monotherapy for treat-
ment-resistant panic disorder.[42,43] Altogether,
these results
shows that PDA is more difﬁcult condition to treat than PD as
previous studies have suggested.[16,44]

The limitations of this study come as follows. First, the small
sample size limits the generalizability of our results. Second, the
retrospective nature of the study may introduce selection bias,
although we included all consecutive patients to prevent it. In
addition, we could not obtain the information on the treatment
effect; instead we speculated the clinical course based on the
prescribed medication. Finally, the self-report questionnaire was
used to assess the severity of symptoms. It has been proposed that
psychological symptoms are associated with dysregulation of
biological factors such as neuro-endocrine system.[45] However,
we measured the symptoms of subjects by using standardized
tools which were validated in various populations.

this

Despite these limitations,

study had the following
strengths. We could obtain various psychological symptoms of
the subjects from the questionnaires that the patients completed
before the treatment. Based on this, we could observe that
agoraphobic score was signiﬁcantly correlated with several
psychological symptoms including panic disorder severity which
has not been reported before. Also, we evaluate various
parameters regarding treatment course such as BZD dose, the
duration of BZD use, as-needed BZD prescription, total duration
of treatment, and hospitalization. This makes our study different
from previous ones and gives clinicians comprehensive perspec-
tives view from psychopathology to pharmacological treatment.

Longitudinal studies are needed to identify the causal relationship
between agoraphobia and panic disorder.

In conclusion, patients with PDA may show worse prognosis
coming from more severe symptoms and poorer treatment
responses than patients with PD. This suggests that it is still
crucial to identify the presence of agoraphobia in panic disorder,
even though it is no more a speciﬁer of panic disorder in the
diagnostic system and more careful clinical attentions are
required for those with agoraphobia. More intensive pharmaco-
logical and psychological treatment should be introduced for
patients with PDA. Combining CBT with pharmacological
treatment can be a helpful strategy in treating PDA, since it has
been known that CBT effectively alleviate symptoms of panic
disorder with psychological comorbidities.
