Cognitive screening has been proposed for older adults diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore,
we examined the change over time in cognitive function and the risk of incident dementia in older adults after COPD diagnosis. A
sample of 3,982 participants from the population-based cohort study Good Aging in Skåne was followed for 19 years, and 317
incident COPD cases were identiﬁed. The cognitive domains of episodic memory, executive function, and language were assessed
using neuropsychological tests. Mixed models for repeated measures and a Cox model were implemented. Participants performed,
on average, worse over time on all neuropsychological tests after COPD diagnosis in comparison to those without COPD, although
statistical signiﬁcance differences were only observed for episodic memory and language. The groups had a comparable risk of
developing dementia. In conclusion, our results indicate that cognitive screening in the early stages of COPD may be of limited
clinical relevance.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized
by limitations of airﬂow and progressive inﬂammation of the
airways. COPD is common among adults aged ≥65 years (global
prevalence: 14.2%; 95% CI [11.8–18.0]1). Reduced respiratory
function can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia, known to
affect brain function negatively, increasing the risk of cognitive
dysfunction2. A recent study suggested that also depression
may play a role in cognitive decline in older adults diagnosed
with COPD3. The association between cognitive impairment and
COPD is dependent on the severity of COPD2,4,5 and coexisting
comorbidities5–7. COPD patients
typically also have other
comorbidities,
such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes
mellitus, or a combination thereof, which may contribute to
cognitive decline to a varying extent5. The prevalence of
cognitive deﬁcits in older adults diagnosed with COPD varies
between 3% and 61%4,5. In comparison, the prevalence of mild
cognitive impairment is reported to be between 6% and 25% for
individuals between 60 and 84 years of age8. Cognitive domains,
such as learning and memory, attention, and, to some extent,
executive function and language, have been found to be
impaired in COPD patients2,6,9–11. The impact of COPD on social
cognition has been less studied12.
It has been argued that
respiratory
cognitive status should be part of
assessment for all COPD patients13 or for older COPD patients
with hypoxemia, increased inﬂammation, and coexisting comor-
bidities5. As impaired cognition could be a sign of dementia, it is
important to assess to which degree COPD increases the risk of
dementia. Prior research presents inconsistent ﬁndings on the
association between COPD and dementia4,11,14. The aim of this
study was to investigate how cognition and the risk of incident
dementia are affected in older adults after COPD diagnosis in
order to provide evidence regarding the relevancy of cognitive
screening in this population.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. During follow-up, 317
incident COPD cases were observed. The mean age at COPD
diagnosis was 74 years (SD: 8 years). The average time to COPD
diagnosis was 6 years from the baseline visit (SD: 4 years).

Test scores over time
As seen in Table 2, the decrease in test scores per year is more
pronounced for COPD participants compared to non-COPD peers.
The differences between the groups were statistically signiﬁcant
for episodic memory and language (see Table 2). Since the
difference observed for the executive function was not statistically
signiﬁcant, differences in global cognition were not formally
tested. For completeness, all p-values are reported, although the
p-value for MMSE is only nominal. The estimated average decline
per year for each neuropsychological test is shown in Table 3.

Dementia over time
Overall, 266 participants developed dementia during follow-up. Of
those, 24 participants were diagnosed with COPD. The mean age
of the participant when diagnosed with dementia was 84 years
(SD: 7 years). The estimated incidence of dementia was 7.6 per
1000 person/years (95% CI [6.7; 8.5] p-value < 0.001). The hazard
ratio of developing dementia between COPD and non-COPD
[0.8; 1.9], p-value = 0.319). The
participants was 1.2 (95% CI
performed sensitivity analysis using spirometry measurements to
deﬁne COPD yielded similar results (HR = 1.1, 95% CI [0.6; 2.0],
p-value = 0.659).

DISCUSSION
Previous studies indicate that older adults diagnosed with COPD
are at higher risk of cognitive decline compared to peers without
this diagnosis13–15. COPD patients with cognitive impairment have
poor compliance with medication and oxygen therapy, which

increases the risk of acute exacerbations9. Since cognitive screen-
ing has been proposed for this population, further understanding
of cognitive decline in COPD is necessary. This study examined
how different cognitive domains were affected over time in older
adults after being diagnosed with COPD. The COPD participants
received their diagnosis on average 6 years into the study, and
most of the patients were still at an early stage of the disease. On
average, participants performed worse over time after COPD
diagnosis in all
is, episodic
tested cognitive domains,
memory, executive function, and language. The differences
between COPD and non-COPD participants were statistically
signiﬁcant only for episodic memory and language. However, all
outcomes of this study point in the same direction, suggesting
that early-stage COPD could affect cognition in a negative way,
which is concordant with what has been reported pre-
viously14,16–20. One previous study provides evidence that COPD
is not associated with cognition but that depression may instead
contribute to the observed cognitive decline in older adults3. In
our study, we observed a worsening of COPD despite statistical
adjustments for depressive symptoms. The impact of early COPD
on cognition seems however limited since the differences in test
scores between the groups were minor and, therefore, sugges-
tively irrelevant clinically.

To contextualize the estimated statistically signiﬁcant annual
change in scores for the recalled word test and the animal ﬂuency
test, we compared our results to those previously observed in
older adults with cognitive deﬁcits. A recent clinical study21
implemented the HVLT-R test, which is a similar test to our word

recall test. The authors considered a decrease of 6 or more words
at 24 months to be an indication of cognitive decline21. We
estimated that, on average, participants without COPD would
recall 0.07 words less per year (Table 3), yielding a decrease of 0.14
words after 24 months. For the group of participants with COPD,
the change after 24 months was estimated to be 0.22 fewer words.
For both groups, the average change is less than 1 word per
24 months. The annual change in the result of the animal ﬂuency
test in cognitively healthy older adults has been estimated to be
approximately −0.24 animals, compared to −0.69 animals in
patients with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease22. We estimated an
annual result change of −0.25 and −0.34 animals in non-COPD
and COPD participants, respectively. The annual change in both
groups is much smaller than that observed for older adults
diagnosed with preclinical dementia. The estimated annual
change in both the recalled word test and the animal ﬂuency
test is much smaller than those reported for older adults with
cognitive deﬁcits. Thus, we suggest that these changes are not
clinically relevant.
In addition, participants recently diagnosed
with COPD have stable MMSE scores, indicating that the impact of
early COPD on global cognition is minimal. This is concordant with
our previous ﬁnding that accelerated decline in lung function is
limited at early-stage COPD23.

The mechanism behind a potential accelerated cognitive
decline in COPD remains unclear15. This work provides support
for the hypothesis that arterial hypoxia and hypercapnia could be
two of the main drivers of cognitive decline in COPD since
cognitive deterioration, besides the normal decline observed in

aging, seems to be limited in early-stage COPD patients. Of note,
more than 80% of older patients with COPD are also diagnosed
with other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and
diabetes24, also affecting cognition. Therefore,
the potential
contribution of early-stage COPD on cognitive decline is
entangled with that of other comorbidities and unhealthy lifestyle
factors, such as smoking.

Patients with COPD could be at increased risk of cognitive
impairment and subsequent dementia4. We estimated a statisti-
cally non-signiﬁcant, slightly higher risk of developing dementia
for COPD participants. A recent study found the prevalence and
incidence of dementia in COPD patients to be similar to that of
age-matched controls4. The interpretation of these ﬁndings is not
straightforward. Firstly, COPD patients are at higher risk of death
due to COPD itself and common COPD comorbidities such as
cardiovascular disease. Secondly, mild COPD and mild dementia
can be difﬁcult to diagnose in older adults since cognition and
lung function normally declines with aging. Thirdly, it has been
suggested that the pattern of cognitive impairment in COPD
patients may differ from that observed in Alzheimer’s disease10.
This may imply that COPD increases the risk for non-AD types of
dementia, rendering it problematic to ﬁnd an association between
dementia and COPD, at least when examining all-cause dementia.
Thus, we believe that an association between COPD and dementia
may be plausible, but it is probably blurred by higher mortality in
COPD patients as well as difﬁculties in establishing the diagnosis
of dementia and COPD in older adults.

the initial

Current empirical evidence suggests that screening for cogni-
tive impairment does not necessarily improve decision-making or
important patient, caregiver, or societal outcomes in community-
dwelling older adults25. For COPD patients, it has been argued that
cognitive screening should be part of
respiratory
assessment for all patients13 or for older COPD patients with
increased inﬂammation, and coexisting comorbid-
hypoxemia,
ities5, as cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in this group.
However, a recent review15 could not establish enough empirical
evidence that COPD causes cognitive impairment. Our study
shows that recently diagnosed COPD older adults, on average,
perform only slightly worse on cognitive tests compared to adults
without COPD. Therefore, we argue that cognitive screening of
recently diagnosed older adults could be redundant. Nevertheless,
in case patients show an indication of cognitive decline, their
cognitive status should be assessed regardless of the COPD stage.
Cognitive decline in older adults diagnosed with COPD followed
up to 19 years was investigated. Despite including 12 neuropsy-
chological tests,
instruments measuring social cognition were
lacking. In addition, episodic memory was assessed by immediate
word list recall but not delayed recall. A delayed recall measure
was available from a separate ﬁve-item test but was not included
in this study because of ceiling effects in the healthy older
population. It is worth noticing that performance on an immediate
recall test alone, although clinically informative, probably cannot
be equated with episodic memory26. The impact of COPD on
social cognition is poorly understood12, and future investigation is
warranted. We acknowledge that the interpretation of our results
is limited by the lower numbers of dementia and COPD cases.
Participants in the GÅS study should be both willing and capable
of completing an approximately 4-h-long cognitive and physical

are not represented in our study sample. Therefore,
literate,
healthy, and overall cognitively intact participants are over-
represented in the study sample, and our conclusions may not
be generalizable to other groups. Participants with advanced
COPD may not be capable of attending the study visits due to
their deteriorated health and are, therefore,
likely underrepre-
sented in the study. The mentioned effects would reduce the
difference in test scores between COPD and non-COPD groups.

The median follow-up time during the study was 7 years, and
therefore long-time effects in cognitive deterioration could not be
observed. Further work is required to understand whether
cognitive screening would be helpful for advanced COPD patients.
Although COPD was clinically diagnosed and dementia was
deﬁned using standardized procedures complemented with
health-care records, there is a risk of misclassiﬁcation. For example,
some COPD participants may have received their diagnosis in a
delayed manner since the COPD symptoms may have been
attributed to other diseases,
in particular in non-smokers. We
performed a sensitivity analysis using study spirometry measure-
ments to identify COPD participants. The results of the sensitivity
analyses were largely concordant with those presented in the
primary analysis. Therefore, we believe that the potential impact
of COPD misclassiﬁcation on the results is minor. We also
investigated potential cohort effects and the impact of attrition
in sensitivity analyses. Similar results as in the primary analysis
were rendered, which alleviates our concern. Despite collecting
extensive information about health status and lifestyle, unmea-
sured confounding remains.

In conclusion, this study presents indications that additional
cognitive decline due to COPD is seemingly minor at an early
stage of
the disease. Therefore, we conclude that cognitive
screening of patients at an early stage of COPD is most likely
unnecessary. The cognitive status of patients with indications of
cognitive decline should be investigated regardless of
the
COPD stage.

METHODS
Study design and participants
longitudinal
The Good Aging in Skåne (GÅS) is a prospective,
population-based study aiming to investigate different aspects of
aging27. Brieﬂy, 60- to 93-year-old subjects living in the south of
Sweden, Skåne, are randomly selected from the Swedish
population register. Participants are offered a thorough physical,
medical, and psychological examination and are invited to follow-
up examinations at regular intervals every three (≥78 years of age)
to six (<78 years of age) years until death. To encourage the
participation of frail adults, the study team performs home visits
following the same study protocol. However, patients living at
nursing homes or with limited mobility may receive a shorter
examination if they are not able or willing to perform a full
examination. Currently, three waves have been fully recruited,
with an initial participation rate of approximately 60%. As shown
in Fig. 1, data from 5804 participants examined between 13th Feb
2001 and 21st Jun 2021 were retrieved. In order to study early-
onset progression and to minimize bias, participants diagnosed
with COPD and/or dementia at the ﬁrst study visit were excluded
from this analysis. The GÅS study is conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The
study is approved by the Lund University Ethics Review Board (LU
744-00). All participants provided written informed consent.

Cognitive assessment
Cognition in the GÅS study was assessed using a neuropsycho-
logical test battery including 12 instruments administrated by
experienced test administrators following a standardized protocol.
In this work, we focused only on cognitive functions that were
most frequently found to be affected in COPD patients in previous
studies (global cognition, memory, executive function, and word
ﬂuency2,10,14,16,18,20,28). Global cognitive status was assessed using
the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Episodic memory was
assessed using a 16-word free recall test. Executive function was
assessed using a modiﬁed version of the WAIS-III digit span
backward test. The language domain was assessed using a

Morbidities were identiﬁed by several methods: self-reports,
medical examination, reviewing medical records, and linking to
the Skåne Healthcare Registry (SHR).
In the SHR, diseases are
classiﬁed according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases
System version 10 (ICD-10). Cerebrovascular disease included
cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, occlusion and stenosis of
precerebral or cerebral arteries, and/or transient cerebral ischemia.

Heart disease included acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart
disease, presence of cardiac and vascular implants, heart failure,
and atrial ﬁbrillation or other arrhythmias. COPD also includes
emphysema and chronic bronchitis. During the study visit,
symptoms of depression were assessed using the Montgomer-
y–Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS). Dementia diagnosis
was primarily extracted from medical
records and included
Alzheimer’s disease, mixed dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy
body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Complementary
diagnosis of all-cause dementia was classiﬁed by the study
physician during thorough examination according to the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition
(DSM-IV). The date of death was obtained by linkage to the
Swedish people and address register.

COPD diagnosis
Participants with COPD were diagnosed in standard clinical
practice. Clinically, diagnosis of COPD in Skåne county is based
on three criteria: spirometry veriﬁed obstructive after bronchodila-
tion, current airway symptoms, and a history of risk factors for
COPD.

Spirometry assessments
During the study visits, a spirometry assessment was performed
using a Vitalograph 2120 spirometer (Vitalograph Ltd., Bucking-
ham, UK) according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines30.
Bronchodilators were not administrated during the ﬁrst wave
baseline visit. Subjects received 1.0 mg of β2-receptor agonist
terbutaline 10 min prior to the spirometry in the majority of visits.
The spirometry results were used in a sensitivity analysis as an
alternative way to identify COPD cases.

Statistical analyses
Mixed models for
repeated measures were implemented to
estimate the mean neuropsychological test scores over time. The
models had a random intercept for each participant. The rate of
change of neuropsychological test score was calculated as the
difference between the score at the follow-up visits and the
baseline score, divided by the time between the visits. Using a
directed acyclic graph, we identiﬁed which factors were required
in the model to estimate the direct effect of COPD on cognitive
performance. Age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, depression score, and diabetes at
baseline were then included to control for confounding. Since our
is optimized for the interpretation of the coefﬁcients
model
related to COPD, no conclusion is drawn regarding the effect of
the other covariates on cognition31. In order to improve precision,
we also included the test score at baseline in the models.
Conﬁdence intervals were calculated using robust standard errors.
The goodness of the ﬁt was assessed visually using residual plots.
In this study, there were several statistical hypotheses of interest
(one for each cognitive domain). To reduce the burden of
multiplicity, we implemented a ﬁxed sequence testing proce-
dure32. Brieﬂy, we ordered the cognitive domain hypotheses
according to our a priori expectations of observing a difference
between COPD and non-COPD participants. In this procedure, the
ﬁrst hypothesis is tested, and if rejected, the second is tested. The
testing procedure continues until a hypothesis cannot be rejected.
This hierarchical testing approach controls the type I error at 5% in
the strong sense. The implemented testing order was (1)
immediate recall test, (2) ﬂuency test, (3) digit span test, and (4)
MMSE. An extended Cox model using baseline characteristics (age,
sex, education, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and
diabetes) was implemented to estimate the risk of dementia for
participants with and without COPD. The presence of COPD
diagnosis was modeled as a time-dependent covariate. Violations

of the proportional hazard assumption were assessed visually
using log-log plots, as well as with a formal test,
in order to
investigate whether the log hazard-ratio function was constant
over time. The overall prevalence of dementia and COPD in the
GÅS study are 6.5%33 and 5.5%23, respectively. Therefore, the
number of incident dementia cases in COPD participants in this
study was expected to be low. Dementia is thus presented as a
secondary outcome and excluded from the testing hierarchy.

Sensitivity analyses
Potential sources of bias were COPD misclassiﬁcation, cohort
effects, and attrition. Assigning a correct COPD diagnosis in older
adults with comorbidities is difﬁcult, mainly due to overlapping
symptoms and difﬁculties performing a correct spirometry34. To
overcome the uncertainty in COPD diagnosis in clinical practice,
sensitivity analyses were performed using spirometry measure-
ments collected during the study visits to identify COPD cases.
Participants whose ratio of forced expiratory volume in the ﬁrst
second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was <0.7 were
classiﬁed as having COPD. The data were collected over the course
of 20 years, and therefore cohort effects are expected. The primary
models were stratiﬁed by study wave to investigate this issue.
Attrition is inevitable in cohort studies involving older adults. Thus,
we conducted sensitivity analyses considering only the ﬁrst
follow-up visit. The statistical analyses were performed using
Stata IC 17.0 software (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA) and Python 3.8.5
(Python Software Foundation).
