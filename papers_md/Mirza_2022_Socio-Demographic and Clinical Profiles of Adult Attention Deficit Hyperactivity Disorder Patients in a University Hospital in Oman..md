abstract: Objectives: Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically considered a condition 
affecting children, there is evidence that children diagnosed with ADHD continue to suffer from this condition after 
the age of 18. This study aimed to describe the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of adult ADHD patients 
in  Oman  and  evaluate  their  association  with  the  disorder’s  different  subtypes.  Methods:  This  retrospective  study 
included adult patients with ADHD from the outpatient clinic at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. 
Data  from  medical  records  from  January  2018  to  April  2020  were  collected.  Socio-demographic  characteristics, 
clinical profiles and psychiatric comorbidities were examined. Results: This study included 100 adults who fulfilled 
the standard diagnosis of ADHD, with 54.0% (n = 54) and 46.0% (n = 46) from the inattentive and combined subtypes, 
respectively.  It  was  found  that  ADHD  was  more  prevalent  among  males  (64.0%)  than  females  (36.0%),  with  the 
inattentive subtype being more predominant among females. The ADHD patients with the inattentive subtype were 
associated with comorbid substance use disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 11.29; P = 0.049), personality disorders (OR 
= 7.96; P = 0.017) and major depressive disorder (OR = 15.94; P = 0.002) compared to patients predominantly with 
the  combined  subtype.  Conclusion: This  study  echoes  the  findings  from  the  current  literature  that  adult  patients 
with ADHD commonly have comorbid psychiatric disorders, leading to significant functional impairment. Psychiatric 
comorbidities must be identified and urgently treated for better clinical and functional outcomes in adult patients with 
ADHD.

Advances in Knowledge
-  This is the first report from Oman and the Gulf Cooperation Council region focusing on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 

among adults.

-  This study compares the clinical characteristics of patients from the Middle East to those from the West.

-  Furthermore, this study explores a new area of research and encourages further studies among similar cohorts.

Application to Patient Care
-  As Sultan Qaboos University Hospital is a new and adult-only ADHD service in Oman, this study raises awareness of this condition 

among patients and clinicians. 

-  Further expansion of services, as a result of this study, have clearly indicated the complexity of the comorbidities presenting in those with 

adult ADHD.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 

(ADHD)  is  a  common  childhood  neuro- 
development  disorder,  which  manifests  as 
inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity and persists 
for  at  least  six  months  in  at  least  two  settings  (e.g. 
school,  home  or  social  situations).1  These  clinical 
symptoms  must  have  an  impact  on  social,  academic 
or  occupational  functioning  to  warrant  a  clinical 
diagnosis  of  ADHD.  According  to  the  Diagnostic 
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth 
Edition  (DSM-5),1  the  symptoms  of  inattention  are 
evident  in  children  in  their  schoolwork,  as  the  child 
fails to pay close attention to details, makes repetitive 
careless  mistakes,  gets  easily  distracted  and  has 

difficulty sustaining attention. Whereas the symptoms 
of  hyperactivity  and  impulsivity  include  difficulty 
remaining seated in the classroom, fidgeting, blurting 
out  answers  before  questions  have  been  completed 
and difficulty waiting their turn in activities or games. 
However, the presentation of ADHD symptoms among 
adults  differs  from  that  in  children  as  the  cluster  of 
symptoms  related  to  hyperactivity  reduces  over  time 
and  manifests  as  restlessness.  Moreover,  inattention 
as  a  symptom  in  adults  with  ADHD  may  manifest 
as  difficulty  meeting  deadlines  at  college  or  work  or 
forgetting appointments.2,3 The DSM-5 outlines three 
subtypes  of  ADHD:  (1)  primarily  hyperactive  and 
impulsive, (2) primarily inattentive and (3) combined.

Each  of  these  subtypes  is  distinguished  by  a  set  of 
clinical symptoms in the diagnostic criteria.

Research  has  shown  that  30–50%  of  those 
diagnosed  with  ADHD  in  childhood  continue  to 
experience  the  core  symptoms  of  the  condition  after 
the  age  of  18.4  In  the  USA,  the  prevalence  of  adult 
ADHD  is  estimated  to  be  more  than  4%.5  Moreover, 
males are generally more likely to be diagnosed with 
ADHD  than  females,  with  a  male-to-female  ratio 
of  approximately  3:1  in  clinical  samples  and  females 
predominantly  presenting  with 
inattentive 
subtype.6 As with children with ADHD, many adults 
with ADHD are diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric 
disorders  such  as  mood  and  anxiety  disorders, 
personality  disorders  and  substance  use  disorders 
(SUD).7  Many  undiagnosed  ADHD  cases  in  adults 
present  when  they  come  into  contact  with  mental 
health services due to other psychiatric disorders and 
treating  the  comorbid  condition  requires  treatment 
independent from that of ADHD.8

The  adult  ADHD  clinic  at  the  Sultan  Qaboos 
University  Hospital  (SQUH)  began  as  a  pilot  project 
to  cater  to  the  needs  of  the  adults  with  symptoms 
of  ADHD  and  help  those  using  the  service  aimed  at 
younger  individuals’  transition  to  the  adult  ADHD 
services.9  This  study  sought  to  address  the  current 
gap in the literature as no studies from Oman, or its 
neighbouring  countries,  have  compared  the  clinical 
characteristics  of  patients  from  the  Middle  East  to 
those  from  the  West  or  examined  the  psychiatric 
adult  ADHD  patients.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients 
diagnosed with ADHD in an outpatient clinic at Sultan 
Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH), Muscat, Oman. 
This  adult  ADHD  clinic  is  the  only  ADHD  clinical 
service in the country.  All patients between the ages 
of  18  and  60,  who  attended  the  clinic  over  a  period 
of  two  years  from  January  2018  to  April  2020,  had  a 
full psychiatric evaluation and fulfilled the diagnostic 
criteria  of  adult  ADHD  based  on  the  DSM-5  were 
included.10  This  diagnosis  requires  the  presence  of  a 
set  of  clinical  symptoms  for a specific  period and an 
impact on social, academic or occupational function. 
The cohort of patients in this study was a mixture of 
those  who  were  either  diagnosed  for  the  first  time 
before  the  age  of  18  but  continued  to  experience 
symptoms into adulthood, or accessed the service for 
the first  time  after  turning  18. Similarly,  some adults 

with  ADHD  were  parents  or  first-degree  relatives  of 
children with ADHD who were never diagnosed due 
to a lack of awareness. Patients who had comorbidities 
of intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism spectrum 
disorders were excluded from the study.

The following variables were obtained from each 
patient:  age,  gender,  marital  status  (single,  married 
and  divorced),  educational  level,  occupation,  history 
of substance misuse, family history of ADHD, history 
of  self-harm/suicidal  attempt  and  forensic  history. 
The  psychiatric  comorbidities  were  classified  as 
bipolar  affective  disorder,  schizophrenia,  obsessive-
compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety 
disorder  and  personality  disorder.  The  presenting 
symptoms  were  explored  to  determine  the  subtype 
of  ADHD:  predominantly  inattentive  presentation, 
predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation or 
a combined presentation.

Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  explore  the 
profiles of the patients with ADHD, according to their 
demographic and clinical variables. First, a univariate 
comparison  was  carried  out  between  the  ADHD 
subtypes 
impulsive 
(inattentive/hyperactive  and 
versus  combined),  evaluated  using  a  Chi-squared 
test,  Fisher’s  exact  test  and  Mann–Whitey  U  test  to 
reveal  the  association  and  differences  between  the 
demographic  and  clinical  variables.  Following  this, 
the bivariate (unadjusted) and multivariate (adjusted) 
regression  analyses  were  used.  In  the  regression 
model, the following significant variables were used in 
an attempt to identify the risk factors associated with 
ADHD subtypes while adjusted by each other: gender, 
age of diagnosis, comorbid SUD, personality disorders, 
major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep-wake 
disorders  and  history  of  self-harm/suicidal  attempt. 
Data  were  analysed  using  the  Statistical  Package  for 
the  Social  Sciences  (SPSS),  Version  23.0  (IBM  SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The level of significance was 
set at P <0.05.

Ethics  approval  was  granted  by  the  College  of 
Medicine  and  Health  Sciences  at  Sultan  Qaboos 
University,  Muscat,  Oman  (MREC  2260).  The  study 
was conducted as per the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the American Psychological Association with regards 
to  ethical  human  research,  including  confidentiality, 
privacy and data management.

Results

A  total  of  100  adult  patients  who  had  ADHD  were 
included  in  this  study,  of  which  54  (54.0%)  were 
classified as the inattentive subtype and 46 (46.0%) the 
combined subtype. Of this sample, ADHD was noted to 
be more prevalent among males (64.0%) than females

(36.0%) and the average age of patients was 22.6 ± 6.4 
years. Almost 80% (n = 79) of the adult patients with 
ADHD had a school education; 21% had dropped out 
of  school.  The  average  age  of  ADHD  diagnosis  was 
13.8  ±  3.0  years.  Major  depressive  disorder  was  the 
most  commonly  associated  comorbidity  among  the 
ADHD patients (28.0%), followed by anxiety disorder 
(23.0%),  personality  disorders  (18.0%),  sleep-wake 
disorders  (15.0%)  and  SUD  (10.0%).  More  than  50% 
(n = 52) of the study participants had family members 
with an ADHD diagnosis. A small percentage of them 
had a history of self-harm/suicidal attempt (9.0%) and 
forensic  records  (6.0%).  Over  half  of  the  participants 
(62.0%)  had  been  prescribed  methylphenidate 
stimulant  therapy  and  the  remainder  (38.0%)  had 
received non-stimulant therapy [Table 1].

The  multivariate  analysis  indicated  that  some 
demographic and clinical characteristics demonstrated 
significant  association  with  adult  ADHD,  specifically 
for the inattentive subtype. The model had a good-fit 
according to the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (R2 = 1.934; 
P = 0.963), Nagelkerke’s R2 was 0.676 and the overall 
predicting  power  (sensitivity  =  0.852,  specificity  = 
0.848) was 0.850. For adult patients with ADHD, female 
participants were 14 times (OR = 14.47; P <0.001) more 
likely to be diagnosed with the inattentive subtype than 
male  patients.  Patients  with  the  inattentive  subtype 
were significantly associated with comorbid SUD (OR 
=11.29; P = 0.049), personality disorders (OR = 7.96; P 
= 0.017) and major depressive disorder (OR = 15.94; P 
= 0.002) compared to patients predominantly with the 
combined subtype [Table 2].

Discussion

The  current  study  evaluated  the  clinical  subtypes  of 
adult patients with ADHD and their association with 
psychiatric  comorbidities  in  Oman,  making  it  the 
first  report  from  this  region  to  highlight  the  clinical 
characteristics  of  adult  patients  with  ADHD.  In  this 
study, the majority of patients were male, with a male-
to-female  ratio  of  approximately  1.8:1;  this  is  in  line 
with  the  consensus  that  males  are  more  likely  to  be 
diagnosed  with  ADHD,  with  higher  male-to-female 
ratios  found  among  clinical  than  population-based 
samples.11  This  ratio  discrepancy  tends  to  decrease 
with  an  increase  in  age.12,13  A  study  among  children 
with  ADHD  in  Oman  reported  a  male-to-female 
ratio of 3.6:1, further supporting the aforementioned 
trend.14

Evidence has shown that there is a gender variation 
regarding the subtypes of ADHD, with females being 
diagnosed  more  often  with  the  inattentive  subtype,

whereas  male  patients  are  usually  diagnosed  with 
the  hyperactive/impulsive  or  combined  subtype.15 
Findings  from  the  current  study  were  consistent 
with  the  existing  literature;  of  the  36  female  patients 
diagnosed  with  adult  ADHD,  83.3%  (n  =  30)  were 
diagnosed  with  the  inattentive  subtype  (OR  =  14.47; 
P  <0.001)  and  16.7%  (n  =  6)  the  combined  subtype. 
Although  male  patients  are  commonly  diagnosed 
with  the  combined  or  hyperactive/impulsive  subtype 
of  ADHD  during  childhood,  data  derived  from  a 
longitudinal study indicated that the natural trajectory 
of  the  condition  leads  to  a  decline  in  hyperactivity 
symptoms over time, with inattention and impulsivity 
remaining  significantly  present.16  Interestingly,  in  the 
current  study,  none  of  the  patients  were  diagnosed 
with the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive subtype 
of  ADHD,  in  agreement  with  currently  emerging 
evidence that this particular subtype of ADHD is very 
rare among adults, raising doubts as to its validity.17

It is known that ADHD impacts the educational 
and  socioeconomic  outcomes  of  those  affected.18  In 
the  current  clinical  sample,  21.0%  did  not  complete 
their  high  school  diploma,  which  supports  existing 
literature from Oman that dropping out of school is one 
of  the  negative  ramifications  of  ADHD.14  Moreover, 
the  presence  of  psychiatric  comorbidity  is  the  rule 
rather  than  the  exception  in  patients  with  ADHD, 
leading to greater clinical and functional impairment.19 
During  childhood,  ADHD  is  highly  comorbid  with 
oppositional  defiant  and  conduct  disorder,  anxiety 
and  mood  disorders  and  specific  learning  disorder.20 
It is estimated that 80% of adults with ADHD have at 
least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. Despite this, 
ADHD  remains  underdiagnosed  and  undertreated 
in  the  adult  population.21  Comparably,  the  current 
study’s  findings  strongly  suggest  that  ADHD  in 
adults  is  highly  comorbid  with  other  mental  health 
disorders.  In  this  study,  10.0%  of  the  adult  patients 
with  ADHD  had  SUD;  although  its  association  was 
significant (OR=11.29; P = 0.049), its prevalence was 
lower  compared  to  the  current  literature,  which  can 
be explained by the modest sample size.22 Personality 
disorders  were  reported  in  18.0%  of  the  participants 
in  the  current  study  (OR  =  7.96;  P  =  0.017)  which 
is  consistent  with  another  study  from  this  field.23 
Furthermore,  depression  is  highly  prevalent  among 
adult  ADHD  patients,  with  a  prevalence  of  16–31%, 
resulting  in  increased  illness  severity  and  functional 
impairment.24 The current study’s results confirm this 
as 28.0% of the patients were diagnosed with comorbid 
major depressive disorder (OR = 15.94; P = 0.002). 

The study’s strength is that it examined all adult 
patients attending the only ADHD clinical service in the 
country, the first study of its kind in the Arabian Gulf 

210 | SQU Medical Journal, May 2022, Volume 22, Issue 2

to explore the clinical profile of adult ADHD and its 
associated  psychiatric  comorbidities.  The  limitations 
include the relatively small sample size and the chance 
that adults with milder symptoms of ADHD who may 
not  have  accessed  the  tertiary  hospital  service  might 
have been missed. In addition, due to the small sample 
size,  the  associated  factors  identified  in  the  logistic 
analysis were not used to assess determinants. 

Conclusion

The  main  findings  of  this  study  showed  that  female 
patients  were  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  the 
inattentive  subtype  of  ADHD  compared  to  male 
patients.  Patients  with  the  inattentive  subtype  of 
ADHD were significantly found to have other comorbid 
mental  health  conditions,  such  as  SUD,  personality 
disorders and major depressive disorder, compared to 
patients  with  predominantly  the  combined  subtype. 
Therefore, psychiatric comorbidities must be identified 
and treated vigilantly for better clinical and functional 
outcomes in adult patients with ADHD.
