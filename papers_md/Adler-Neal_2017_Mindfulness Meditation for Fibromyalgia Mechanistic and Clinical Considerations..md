Abstract

Purpose of Review—Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread pain and a 
spectrum of psychological comorbidities, rendering treatment difficult and often a financial 
burden. Fibromyalgia is a complicated chronic pain condition that requires a multimodal 
therapeutic approach to optimize treatment efficacy. Thus, it has been postulated that mind-body 
techniques may prove fruitful in treating fibromyalgia. Mindfulness meditation, a behavioral 
technique premised on non-reactive sensory awareness, attenuates pain and improves mental 
health outcomes. However, the impact of mindfulness meditation on fibromyalgia-related 
outcomes has not been comprehensively characterized. The present review delineates the existing 
evidence supporting the effectiveness and hypothesized mechanisms of mindfulness meditation in 
treating fibromyalgia-related outcomes.

Recent Findings—Mindfulness-based interventions premised on cultivating acceptance, non-
attachment, and social engagement may be most effective in decreasing fibromyalgia-related pain 
and psychological symptoms. Mindfulness-based therapies may alleviate fibromyalgia-related 
outcomes through multiple neural, psychological, and physiological processes.

Summary—Mindfulness meditation may provide an effective complementary treatment 
approach for fibromyalgia patients, especially when combined with other reliable techniques 
(exercise; cognitive behavioral therapy). However, characterizing the specific analgesic 
mechanisms supporting mindfulness meditation is a critical step to fostering the clinical validity of 
this technique. Identification of the specific analgesic mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based 
pain relief could be utilized to better design behavioral interventions to specifically target 
fibromyalgia-related outcomes.

Introduction

Page 2

Musculoskeletal chronic pain affects over seven million Americans and is characterized by 
pain and loss of function in the joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and/or muscles lasting for 
greater than or equal to 3 months [1]. To date, over 100 rheumatic disorders have been 
identified, with causes ranging from biochemical and biomechanical changes 
(osteoarthritis), inflammation (gout), infection (septic arthritis), and immune dysregulation 
(rheumatoid arthritis) to more complex origins (fibromyalgia).

Fibromyalgia is chronic pain condition characterized by widespread “aching” pain and is 
often accompanied by tenderness in 18 pre-specified bodily locations [2]. It is often 
accompanied by sleep disturbances and fatigue [3, 4]. Thus, effective treatment protocols 
should employ a multimodal approach to better improve pain, psychological comorbidities, 
and sleep [4]. Although there is growing evidence for the clinical utility of mindfulness 
meditation to treat fibromyalgia-related pain [5], the analgesic mechanisms supporting the 
use of this ancient technique remain poorly characterized. The present review will focus on 
identifying the efficacy and mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based therapies for 
fibromyalgia-related pain.

Recommended treatment guidelines for fibromyalgia include a combination of 
pharmacological and behavioral treatment approaches [6]. The two most commonly 
employed fibromyalgia drug treatments are antidepressants (tricyclics; serotonin/norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors) and GABAergic nerve pain medications (pregabalin) [6]. 
Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown the most pronounced 
improvements in treating fibromyalgia-related pain in comparison to other behavioral 
interventions [6–8]. To date, CBT is the most effective psychological treatment for 
fibromyalgia [6, 8]. CBT helps patients identify and reduce maladaptive cognitions/
behaviors and includes psycho-educational didactics relevant to fibromyalgia, “journaling,” 
relaxation techniques, and real-world desensitization applications [9]. CBT may reduce 
fibromyalgia-related outcomes by attenuating psychological factors involved in facilitating 
pain, including anxiety [10], depression [10, 11], and pain catastrophizing [12]. Pain 
catastrophizing is a cognitive and emotional state where patients magnify the threat value of 
a pain stimulus, report helplessness in the context of pain, and are unable to inhibit intrusive 
pain-related thoughts [13]. Exercise therapy is a supplementary treatment found to 
effectively decrease fibromyalgia-related disease burden by increasing physical strength, 
mobility, positive mood, and functional status [14, 15]. Unfortunately, the long-term 
effectiveness of these treatments is limited [16]. In fact, on average, only 10% of 
fibromyalgia patients report clinically significant improvements in disease symptomology 
over 10 years of treatment following current recommended treatment guidelines [16]. In 
contrast to pharmacologic therapies, we postulate that mindfulness-based treatments produce 
more stabilized improvements in pain and quality of life measures as a function of 
meditation training frequency and experience [17, 18]. Mindfulness-based therapies may 
uniquely reduce symptomology by engaging mechanisms involved in altering the evaluation 
of self-referential thought processes in a less reactive and present-centered fashion.

Physiological Mechanisms of Fibromyalgia

Fibromyalgia patients exhibit a number of pain-related alterations in neural processing that 
support the role of central sensitization and cognitive/emotional processes in facilitating pain 
[12, 19•, 20–22]. Specifically, during noxious pressure stimulation, fibromyalgia patients 
reported greater pain and heightened activation in pain-related brain regions including the 
insula, anterior/posterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and primary (SI) and secondary (SII) 
somatosensory cortices when compared to healthy, age- and gender-matched controls [19•]. 
Furthermore, fibromyalgia patients, in comparison to healthy controls, exhibited heightened 
activation during noxious pressure stimuli in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [19•], a 
region associated with higher-order evaluation of nociceptive information [23]. Decreased 
activation during pain-inducing pressure in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), a region 
associated with the cognitive/affective regulation of pain [24, 25], was also detected [19•]. 
Furthermore, Napadow and colleagues [22] revealed that fibromyalgia patients, while at rest 
(eyes closed), demonstrated greater connectivity between the default mode network (DMN), 
a neural network supporting self-referential [26, 27] and mind-wandering [28] processes, 
and the SII and insula when compared to healthy controls [22]. Heightened clinical pain was 
also associated with heightened connectivity between the right anterior and mid-insula and 
the DMN [22]. The anterior insula is involved in modulating the evaluation of noxious 
stimuli [29–31] and is associated with interoceptive awareness of bodily sensations [32]. 
Consequently, heightened connectivity between the DMN and the insula could reflect a 
mental state where patients are primed to observe and evaluate noxious stimuli due to pain 
“chronification.”

Other studies have shown that pain catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients is positively 
associated with increased activation, during noxious stimulation, in brain regions associated 
with the anticipation (medial frontal cortex) [33], emotional evaluation (rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (rACC)) [34–36], and sensory discrimination (SII) [37] of pain [21]. 
Fibromyalgia patients exhibiting high rates of pain catastrophizing demonstrated increased 
connectivity between SI and the anterior insula, suggesting greater sensitivity during the 
evaluation of nociceptive processes in patients classified as high pain catastrophizers [12]. 
Interestingly, subsequent CBT participation reduced pain catastrophizing, clinical pain, and 
SI/anterior insula connectivity [12]. Reduced pain catastrophizing was also associated with 
lower clinical pain and SI/anterior insula connectivity [12]. Psychological factors, such as 
pain catastrophizing, may be associated with fibromyalgia-related changes in neural network 
connectivity that subsequently heighten the experience of clinical pain. Thus, therapies 
focused on enhancing cognitive control and affective regulation may provide long-term 
relief for fibromyalgia patients.

Psychological stress also contributes to the enhancement of fibromyalgia-related symptoms 
by engaging processes that increase pain sensitivity. Fibromyalgia patients report high rates 
of stress [38] which is associated with increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines [39–41]. 
Specifically, fibromyalgia patients exhibit higher levels of the pro-inflammatory mole-cules 
interleukin-1 (IL-1) [42], IL-6 (IL-6) [43, 44], and IL-8 [45, 46]. Heightened inflammation 
exacerbates pain through activating and sensitizing peripheral nociceptors [47] and by 
increasing substance P [48], a nociceptive neuropeptide [49]. Interestingly, heightened ACC

and insula activation during social stress is associated with stress-induced increases in pro-
inflammatory cytokines [50]. Increased ACC and insula activation is also associated with 
degree of inflammation in asthma patients showing asthma relevant emotional stimuli [51], 
suggesting that top-down processes may mediate the effects of stress on inflammation. 
Therefore, interventions aimed at attenuating stress-induced alterations in neural processing 
may impact fibromyalgia-related outcomes through decreasing inflammatory processes.

Mindfulness Meditation-Based Pain Relief

There has been a significant surge in scientific evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of 
mindfulness meditation to attenuate pain [5, 52–58]. Although mindfulness interventions 
vary in didactic approaches, they are generally premised on (a) developing sustained 
attention to arising sensory, affective, and cognitive events, (b) recognizing such experiences 
as momentary and fleeting, and (c) attenuating reactions/judgments to said experiences [17]. 
Mindfulness training reliably improves catastrophizing [59], anxiety [60–63], depression 
[52, 64–66], mood [67], and stress [68, 69]. Thus, improvements in mood and cognitive 
flexibility could lead to greater pain relief by altering the way patients interpret/
contextualize pain-related ruminations [70, 71]. Yet, it is not known if mindfulness 
attenuates clinical pain by targeting psychological comorbidities that exacerbate pain or vice 
versa.

Mindfulness Meditation and Fibromyalgia

The “standard” 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program is the most 
widely studied mindfulness treatment approach for fibromyalgia-related outcomes [5]. 
MBSR has been shown to be equally effective compared to other behavioral interventions 
(CBT; health education) in treating a wide spectrum of chronic pain-related outcomes [5, 56, 
72]. MBSR educates individuals to respond more effectively to stress, pain, and illness 
through the use of multiple techniques, including meditation practice (focusing on the 
breath; walking meditation, eating meditation), yoga, daily homework, and a 1-day retreat 
[73].

There have been a number of studies that have shed light on the efficacy of MBSR in 
treating fibromyalgia. MBSR was found to be more effective than usual care in improving 
depression [54] and fibromyalgia-associated symptoms, such as fatigue, stress, sleep, pain, 
and global well-being [74, 75]. However, conflicting evidence exists as to whether MBSR is 
more effective than active control regimens in treating fibromyalgia-associated symptoms 
[76–78]. A recent review detected low quality of evidence for MBSR-induced quality of life 
and pain improvements in fibromyalgia patients when compared to usual care, health 
education training, and social support [5, 54, 55, 74, 76–78]. In one large and well-
controlled study, 120 patients were randomized to 8 weeks of MBSR, a health education 
class, or a wait-listed control group [55]. Participants assigned to the MBSR intervention 
reported no significant pain reductions but rather improvements in quality of life when 
compared to the other groups. Yet, these benefits were not maintained at the 2-month follow-
up, suggesting that MBSR does not produce stabilized improvements in quality of life for 
fibromyalgia patients. Other studies have shown more inconsistent findings across

fibromyalgia-based clinical trials [76–78]. These varying results are perplexing and highlight 
the perceived barriers associated with participating in an MBSR program, such as the non-
trivial temporal and financial commitments. It may prove fruitful to implement shorter, more 
accessible and translatable interventions that are tailored to specifically target mechanisms 
found to improve fibromyalgia-associated outcomes.

For instance, a recent 6-week, online mindfulness intervention compared the effects of a 
mindful socioemotional regulation regimen (MSER) to a “healthy lifestyle tips” (HLT) 
intervention [79]. Both regimens consisted of 12 online, 15-min presentations followed by 
weekly meditation homework for those assigned to the MSER group. MSER training 
promotes acceptance of affective experiences to improve quality of life and strengthen social 
networks [79]. The HLT intervention provided didactics on how to eat healthy, exercise, and 
sleep well. Neither intervention produced significant improvements in daily pain levels [79]. 
However, the MSER group reported significant improvements in stress and pain coping 
efficacy, positive affect, family stress, and loneliness when compared to the HLT group [79]. 
Further, depressed patients in the MSER group reported improvements in loneliness, family 
stress, and positive affect. This effect was not detected in the HLT group [79], suggesting 
that mindfulness techniques may uniquely exert increased effectiveness in patients 
diagnosed with concurrent depression. Interestingly, a separate study examined the efficacy 
of 7 weeks of mindfulness training in comparison to a wait-list control on depression, anger, 
and anxiety in fibromyalgia patients [80]. Mindfulness training incorporated aspects of 
MBSR but was similar to MSER in that it was modified to focus on acceptance of emotions, 
thoughts, and sensations. Mindfulness training effectively reduced state anxiety and 
depression and increased participant’s ability to control their anger [80]. These results were 
maintained at a 3-month follow-up. Thus, acceptance-based mindfulness practices may 
improve psychological comorbidities and physical symptomology associated with 
fibromyalgia.

A recent trial provides further support for the efficacy of tailoring mindfulness-based 
interventions to better target fibromyalgia [81•]. An 8-week meditation awareness training 
program was compared with cognitive behavioral therapy for groups, an intervention 
seemingly similar to CBT but performed in a group setting. This group-based CBT approach 
controlled for all the nonspecific aspects associated with meditation awareness training, 
including overall course length, facilitator, individual session duration and format, and 
inclusion of at-home practice [81•]. Meditation awareness training incorporated eight 
weekly, 2-h workshops, guided meditation “homework,” facilitated group discussions, and 
two one-on-one hour-long support sessions with the program instructor. The intervention 
differed from MBSR in that it educated practitioners on the principle of non-attachment, a 
concept based on the view that discomfort can arise from an individual’s attachment to 
experiences, ideas, and/or objects [81•]. Meditation awareness training was also modified to 
specifically address fibromyalgia-related symptomology, with mindfulness practices altered 
to incorporate (1) objectifying somatic pain, (2) compassion-empathy training, and (3) 
altruism promoting techniques.

The meditation awareness training group reported significant improvements over the control 
group in fibromyalgia-related symptomology, pain, sleep, psychological distress, and civic

engagement [81•]. Civic engagement partially mediated all treatment effects, whereas non-
attachment almost fully mediated the effects of meditation awareness training on 
fibromyalgia-related symptomology and pain perception [81•]. Non-attachment-based 
coping strategies may decrease pain symptomology through didactics premised on 
detachments from the concept of “self” and one’s relationship to pain, consequently 
decreasing the affective salience of noxious sensations. Taken together, these studies suggest 
that mindfulness-based techniques principled on developing (a) acceptance of pain, (b) 
nonjudgmental awareness of sensory experiences, and (c) non-attachment to concepts related 
to self, symptoms, or environment may be the most effective in improving fibromyalgia-
related pain and psychological co-morbidities. Furthermore, interventions that help patients 
engage in social activities and relationships may further alleviate fibromyalgia-related 
symptomology, potentially through reducing stress [82] and depression [83].

Mindfulness-Based Analgesia Engages Unique Neural Mechanisms

Mindfulness meditation engages multiple mechanisms to reduce pain [84, 85•, 86–90]. 
However, the analgesic mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based analgesia are distinct 
across meditative training expertise and frequency [84, 85•, 86–90]. We have repeatedly 
demonstrated that mindfulness meditation, after brief mental training (four sessions; 20 min/
session), significantly improves anxiety [61, 91, 92] and pain [84, 85•, 92, 93]. Mindfulness 
meditation-induced pain relief, after brief mental training, is associated with heightened 
activation in regions involved in the cognitive and emotional evaluation of pain such as the 
pregenual ACC (pgACC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the right anterior insula [84, 
85•]. Mindfulness meditation-induced analgesia after brief mental training is also associated 
with decreased activation in low-level sensory processing regions (i.e., thalamus) [84, 85•]. 
We proposed that the cognitive reappraisal mechanisms engaged by mindfulness meditation 
may alleviate pain through a cortico-thalamo-cortical gating mechanism [84, 85•, 93, 94].

The cognitive state of mindfulness meditation reduces acute pain by maintaining/sustaining 
attention on a meditative object (i.e., breath) and nonjudgmentally acknowledging innocuous 
and noxious sensory events as they arise. Thus, shifts in executive attention (engaging breath 
> disengaging breath > engaging distraction non-judgmentally > reengaging breath) are 
likely mediated by rostral aspects of the ACC and OFC [84, 85•, 95]. Thalamic deactivation 
is then driven by prefrontal cortices to reduce the elaboration of nociceptive information 
throughout the cortex (i.e., primary somatosensory cortex) [84, 85•, 93–95], thereby 
decreasing the subjective experience of pain. Furthermore, brief, yet intensive meditation 
training increases resting state functional connectivity between the DMN and the dlPFC, a 
region involved in top-down executive control [96]. Increased connectivity between these 
regions was associated with decreased IL-6 in highly stressed, unemployed individuals [96], 
suggesting that reappraisal mechanisms engaged by short term mindfulness meditation may 
also alleviate inflammatory processes associated with fibromyalgia-related outcomes [43, 
44]. However, greater frequency of meditative training may render long-term, stabilized 
reductions in the subjective experience of pain and likely employs distinct mechanisms from 
those exhibited by novice practitioners.

Davidson and colleagues examined the effects of 8 weeks of MBSR training in healthy 
participants on brain electrical activity [electroencephalography (EEG)] and immune 
function [97]. MBSR training produced stabilized increases in left-lateralized, alpha-band 
activity corresponding to the anterior temporal region immediately following positive mood 
induction. Furthermore, MBSR training was associated with increases in antibody titers in 
response to an influenza vaccine, and MBSR-associated increases in alpha-band activity in 
the central electrodes corresponding to the sensory/motor cortices were associated with 
increased immune responses [97]. Additional trials have found that MBSR training reduces 
pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) gene expression, associated with stress 
responses, in older adults [98] and increases the rate of resolution of psoriatic lesions [99], 
further suggesting that 8 weeks of mindfulness training directly impacts inflammatory-
associated conditions.

Multiple studies reveal that adept meditators (>1000 h of meditation practice) report lower 
levels of pain sensitivity [86–90] and higher pain tolerance [88]. Neuroimaging findings 
show that experienced meditators exhibit heightened activation in sensory processing 
regions (thalamus; SI; SII) [89, 90] but deactivation of prefrontal cortices [89, 90], reflecting 
a unique ability to fully attend to salient sensory processes without engaging higher-order 
appraisals and judgments of said sensory events. These mechanisms are remarkably 
consistent with the principles of mindfulness (i.e., non-judgmental awareness of arising 
sensations, feelings, and emotions).

Additional studies focused on adept meditators report reduced anticipation and/or 
expectations of impending sensory events [86, 87]. During mindfulness meditation, expert 
meditators demonstrated decreased pre-stimulus activity in the anterior insula when 
compared to novices, indicating that long-term practitioners may maintain focus on present 
moment experiences and reduce expectations of impending pain [87]. Brown and Jones used 
EEG and noxious laser stimulation to examine the impact of long-term mindfulness on pain 
and pain anticipation while practitioners were instructed not to practice meditation [86]. 
Greater meditation experience was associated with smaller anticipatory-related evoked 
potentials in regions associated with the expectation of a stimulus, such as the right inferior 
parietal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex. Reduced mid-cingulate cortex activation during the 
anticipation of pain predicted lower pain unpleasantness ratings in the meditation but not the 
control group [86], suggesting that changes in expectations regarding a noxious stimulus 
may particularly facilitate lower pain ratings in experienced meditators. Additionally, 
heightened activation in the ACC and ventromedial PFC during the anticipation of pain was 
positively correlated with pain ratings in control subjects but negatively correlated with pain 
for meditators [86]. Thus, cognitive reappraisal mechanisms engaged immediately prior to 
the experience of a noxious stimulus may play an important role in mediating the pain-
relieving effects of long-term meditation training. Taken together, greater bouts of 
meditation training may target the emotional augmentation of chronic pain through 
decreasing the anticipation and negative appraisal of clinical symptoms while increasing 
cognitive and emotional control immediately prior to a known noxious stimulus.

Conclusion

Page 8

Mindfulness meditation attenuates pain by enhancing cognitive flexibility and the ability to 
regulate emotional reactions with a nonjudgmental and nonreactive focus. MBSR may 
effectively improve outcomes such as stress, quality of life, pain, and symptom severity in 
fibromyalgia patients when compared to a wait-list control [74, 75]. However, mindfulness 
interventions that specifically focus on the principles of acceptance, non-attachment, and 
social engagement in addition to nonjudgmental awareness appear to be most effective in 
improving fibromyalgia-related outcomes [79, 80, 81•]. This subset of mindfulness-based 
interventions produces improvements in depression, anxiety, anger, pain, fibromyalgia-
related symptomology, stress, coping efficacy, and positive affect in comparison to wait-list 
and active control regimens [79, 80, 81•]. Future studies should examine the impact of 
mindfulness-based interventions on fibromyalgia-associated inflammatory and neural 
processes in order to better identify biological mechanisms associated with meditation-based 
pain relief.

Preliminary evidence suggests that the concept of non-attachment to self, experiences, and 
environment may be a key mediator of the effects of mindfulness on fibromyalgia-related 
pain [81•]. Consequently, an individual’s ability to detach from the personal salience and 
affective value of a stimulus may be an important factor in facilitating fibromyalgia-related 
symptom improvement. Interestingly, expert meditators have been shown to demonstrate 
greater reductions in pain unpleasantness, but not pain intensity, when compared to novice 
meditators [87], further suggesting that meditation practices may improve outcomes through 
modifying an individual’s evaluation of painful experiences without impacting the strength 
of the stimulus.

Yet, mindfulness meditation is a cognitively demanding task that may not be appropriate for 
all fibromyalgia patients. Up to 65% of rheumatic patients report severe fatigue [100], and 
mindfulness meditation requires constant and sustained attention on a meditative object 
while also recognizing and reappraising discursive sensory events as they arise. This can be 
very demanding on fibromyalgia patients. Thus, non-pharmacologic approaches that are less 
cognitively engaging may prove more useful for some subsets of patients (CBT; relaxation; 
acupuncture; yoga). Interestingly, preliminary evidence suggests that acceptance and 
commitment therapy (ACT), a type of CBT, may effectively improve pain-related and 
psychological outcomes in fibromyalgia patients [101]. ACT educates patients on principles 
of acceptance and mindfulness through helping participants notice interfering thoughts and 
sensations while refraining from acting on them. ACT is aimed at increasing cognitive 
flexibility, enabling patients to engage in goal-oriented behaviors even in the presence of 
negative experiences. Consequently, mindfulness-based therapies may exert increased 
effectiveness when combined with ACT.

Other prominent mind-body interventions such as yoga [102], massage therapy [103], and 
heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback [104] are effective at reducing fibromyal-gia pain. 
Relaxation-based regimens may improve such outcomes by decreasing stress and/or anxiety 
[105–107]. Yoga may impact fibromyalgia-associated outcomes through a number of 
mechanisms due to the combination of exercise, mindfulness techniques, and social support.

Similar to exercise, yoga may improve balance [108], strength [109], and mobility [110] and 
thus improve functional status. Additionally, instructors teach practitioners to observe 
thoughts and sensations associated with the practice of yoga without reaction or judgment. 
The ability to nonjudgmentally observe uncomfortable mental and physical experiences 
during yoga may enable patients to engage mindfulness-related skills more effectively 
during the experience of clinically relevant stimuli. Yoga is often taught within group 
settings and may provide social support that could alleviate stress and depression-induced 
augmentation of pain [105]. Taken together, yoga may alleviate current clinical pain and 
buffer against future symptoms through combining multiple techniques that may reduce the 
physical and psychological symptoms of fibromyalgia. It may also prove fruitful to 
incorporate mindfulness-based physical exercises (yoga; walking meditation) in a group 
setting to better attenuate pain and comorbid symptomology. Nevertheless, a more 
comprehensive understanding of the specific mechanisms of action supporting mind-body 
approaches will significantly inform our understanding of fibromyalgia epidemiology. 
Although behavioral treatments may not fully alleviate fibromyalgia-related pain, 
mindfulness techniques could be optimized to help patients detach from the reflexive 
personalization and negative evaluation of such an experience.
