with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder:  
a systematic review and meta-analysis

Background:  Repetitive  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (rTMS)  or  transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  (tDCS)  could  provide 
treatment alternatives to stimulant medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), given some evidence for improve-
ments  in  cognition  and  clinical  symptoms.  However,  despite  a  lack  of  solid  evidence  for  their  use,  rTMS  and  tDCS  are  already 
offer ed clinically and commercially in ADHD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to critically appraise rTMS and tDCS 
studies  in  ADHD  to  inform  good  research  and  clinical  practice.  Methods:  A  systematic  search  (up  to  February  2019)  identified 
18 studies (rTMS 4, tDCS 14; 311 children and adults with ADHD) stimulating mainly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We 
included 12 anodal tDCS studies (232 children and adults with ADHD) in 3 random-effects meta-analyses of cognitive measures of 
attention, inhibition and processing speed. Results: The review of rTMS and tDCS showed positive effects in some functions but not 
others, and little evidence for clinical improvement. The meta-analyses of 1 to 5 sessions of anodal tDCS over mainly the left or bi-
lateral dlPFC showed trend-level improvements in inhibition and processing speed, but not in attention. Limitations: Heterogeneity 
in  stimulation  parameters,  patient  age  and  outcome  measures  limited  the  interpretation  of  findings.  Conclusion:  The  review  and 
meta-analysis showed limited evidence that 1 to 5 sessions of rTMS and tDCS, mostly of the dlPFC, improved clinical or cognitive 
measures of ADHD. These findings did not support using rTMS or tDCS of the dlPFC as an alternative neurotherapy for ADHD as 
yet. Larger, multi-session stimulation studies identifying more optimal sites and stimulation parameters in combination with cognitive 
training could achieve larger effects.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  defined 
by  age-inappropriate  and  impairing  symptoms  of  inatten-
tion,  hyperactivity  and  impulsivity.1  It  is  one  of  the  most 
common childhood disorders, with a prevalence of approxi-
mately  7%;  problems  persist  into  adulthood  in  the  majority 
of  cases,  and  ADHD  is  associated  with  poor  academic  and 
social outcomes.2

Patients  with  ADHD  have  cognitive  deficits,  most  promi-
nently in executive functions, such as motor and interference 
inhibition,  selective  and  sustained  attention,  working  mem-
ory and switching, as well as in timing processes and reward-
based decision-making.3,4

Furthermore, meta-analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) stud-
ies  in  ADHD  show  underactivation  in  different  cognitive-
domain-dependent  frontostriatal  and  frontocerebellar  sys-
tems,  such  as  the  right  inferior  and  medial  prefrontal  and 
striatal  regions  during  cognitive  control;5,6  the  right  dorso-

lateral  prefrontal  cortex  (dlPFC)  and  striatal  and  pari-
etal  regions  during  attention;6  the  bilateral  superior  pre-
frontal  regions  during  working  memory;7  the  inferior 
frontal, parietal and cerebellar regions during timing pro-
cesses;8 and the  ventromedial frontostriatal areas during 
reward-related functions.9

The  most  effective  short-term  treatment  for  ADHD  is 
with  psychostimulant  medications,10  but  they  have  side 
 effects and limited longer-term efficacy.11 Alternative treat-
ments, including behavioural therapies, cognitive training, 
neurofeedback  or  dietary  interventions,  have  shown  lim-
ited efficacy.12–14

Noninvasive brain stimulation treatments, such as repeti-
tive  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  (rTMS)  and  transcra-
nial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are promising because 
they  can  stimulate  key  brain  dysfunctions  that  have  been 
 established  in  ADHD  over  the  last  2  decades  of  fMRI  re-
search.9  They  are  also  relatively  safe,  with  minimal  side 
 effects; they are cheaper than long-term drug treatments or

they can induce neuroplasticity,15 providing hope for longer-
term effects, which drugs do not offer.9

In  rTMS,  rapid  magnetic  pulses  are  delivered  to  the  scalp 
with a wire coil to generate an electric current in the brain via 
electromagnetic  induction.  The  induced  electrical  current  can 
trigger action potentials in a focal cortical region under the coil, 
and  when  pulses  are  administered  at  a  particular  frequency, 
rTMS can modulate neural activity with longer-lasting after-
effects. In general, high-frequency rTMS (5 to 20 Hz) promotes 
cortical excitability, and low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) inhib-
its  cortical  excitability.15  Longer-term  clinical  improvements 
with rTMS have been demonstrated in several psychiatric dis-
orders:  up  to  3  months  in  obsessive–compulsive  disorder 
when stimulating prefrontal, orbitofrontal and supplementary 
motor regions;16 4 months in schizophrenia when stimulating 
temporoparietal regions;17 and 12 months in major depressive 
disorder  when  stimulating  the  dlPFC,18–20  supporting  its 
neuro plastic  potential.  Relative  to  tDCS,  rTMS  has  greater 
specificity  in  targeting  neural  regions,21  but  it  is  more  expen-
sive  because  of  device  costs  and  extensive  user-training  re-
quirements.22–24 The most common adverse effects are transient 
scalp discomfort underneath the coil as a result of stimulation 
of the pericranial muscles and peripheral nerves.25,26

In  tDCS,  a  weak  direct  electric  current  is  passed  between 
2 electrodes (a positive anode and a negative cathode) placed 
on  the  scalp.  The  current  modulates  spontaneous  discharge 
rates and therefore neuronal network activity by causing sub-
threshold polarity-dependent shifts in resting membrane po-
tentials, with net increases (anodal stimulation) or decreases 
(cathodal stimulation) in the excitability of underlying neur-
ons,  leading  to  respective  increases  or  decreases  in  cortical 
function  and  synaptic  strength.27  Although  tDCS  is  a  rela-
tively  new  form  of  noninvasive  brain  stimulation,  there  is 
 evidence  that  it  can  enhance  cognitive  functions  in  healthy 
controls,28 with longer-term effects of up to 9 or 12 months.29,30 
In  psychiatric  disorders,  positive  clinical  effects  have  been 
observed  typically  up  to  1  month  after  stimulation  (for  re-
views,  see  Moffa  and  colleagues,31  Tortella  and  colleagues32 
and  Kekic  and  colleagues),33  although  it  is  possible  that 
 effects  are  longer-term.  However,  overall,  tDCS  effects  are 
 often  small,  especially  when  administered  in  single  sessions 
in  healthy  controls.34,35  Relative  to  rTMS,  tDCS  is  cheaper, 
easier  to  use  and  produces  relatively  less  discomfort;  the 
most  common  adverse  effects  are  mild  transient  tingling, 
itching and reddening of the skin underneath the electrodes.36
Both  rTMS  and  tDCS  potentiate  cellular  and  molecular 
mechanisms involved in use-dependent local and distant syn-
aptic plasticity (e.g., γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA] and glutamate-
mediated  long-term  potentiation),  which  may  lead  to  longer-
term  effects.20  This  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis 
focuses  on  the  clinical  and  cognitive  benefits  of  rTMS  and 
tDCS,  because  they  are  the  most  investigated  noninvasive 
brain stimulation methods in ADHD. To our knowledge, other 
methods have not been as well investigated or applied in clin-
ical  settings  in  ADHD  (e.g.,  intermittent  or  continuous  theta 
burst  stimulation,  transcranial  alternating  current  stimulation 
or transcranial random noise stimulation).

There has been an increase over the last decade of 18 rTMS 
and tDCS studies in ADHD. Studies have used relatively het-
erogenous stimulation protocols, as well as clinical and cogni-
tive outcome measures, and have reported mixed positive and 
negative  effects  on  cognition  and  ADHD  symptoms.9,37  Fur-
thermore, knowledge is lacking with respect to optimal stimu-
lation protocols for children with ADHD (such as stimulation 
frequency,  intensity  or  stimulation  site),  and  there  are  neuro-
ethical  concerns  about  potential  costs  to  nontargeted  func-
tions.38  Despite  these  shortcomings,  however,  noninvasive 
brain stimulation is already offered in private clinics in several 
countries and is available commercially and online.39,40

A  recent  meta-analysis  of  10  tDCS  studies  in  ADHD  (n  = 
201) found that predominantly anodal tDCS of the dlPFC led 
to a significant but small improvement in measures of inhibi-
tory  control  (Hedges’  g  =  0.12,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI] 
0.01–0.24), and to a significant but moderate improvement in 
reaction  times  in  n-back  tasks  in  a  smaller  meta-analysis  of 
7 effect sizes derived from 3 studies (Hedges’ g = 0.66, 95% CI 
0.17–1.25).41 However, effect size estimates may have been in-
flated,  because  2  studies  reporting  mostly  null  effects  were 
not included;42,43 multiple dependent effects were clustered in 
the meta-analyses,  unduly  reducing  variation  between  effect 
sizes  and  overestimating  statistical  significance;44,45  and  the 
analysis  of  inhibitory  control  measures  included  noninhibi-
tory measures, such as inattention (e.g., omission errors), pro-
cessing  speed  (e.g.,  reaction  times  to  go  trials)  and  reaction 
time  variability,  calling  into  question  the  specificity  of  the 
positive tDCS effects to the domain of inhibitory control.

We  therefore  considered  it  paramount  and  timely  to  con-
duct  a  systematic  review  of  rTMS  and  tDCS  studies  and  a 
meta-analysis  of  tDCS  studies  in  ADHD  that  included  all 
available  empirical  studies  and  controlled  for  multiple  de-
pendent  effects  and  potential  bias;  that  clustered  cognitive 
 effects into clearly separated cognitive domains of inhibitory 
control, attention and processing speed to elucidate effects of 
tDCS on specific cognitive domains; that tested the replicabil-
ity  of  meta-analysis  results  with  jackknife  sensitivity  analy-
ses;  and  that  included  further  sensitivity  analyses  to  reduce 
heterogeneity  caused  by  studies  with  designs  that  deviated 
from the majority.

This  review  and  meta-analysis  aimed  to  provide  a  critical 
appraisal of the most consistent clinical and cognitive effects 
of rTMS and tDCS in ADHD, scrutinizing the quality of the 
studies,  outlining  limitations  in  the  field  and  discussing 
neuro ethical  concerns  and  future  directions,  with  the  ulti-
mate aim of guiding clinical practice.

or by meeting cut-off criteria for ADHD on validated ADHD 
rating  scales  or  research  diagnosis  questionnaires  (e.g., 
 Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale t score > 6547 or the Kid-

Westwood et al. “inattention,”  “hyperactivity”  or  “impulsivity.”  We  also 
hand-searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and re-
views.  One  author  (S.J.W.)  and  an  additional  reviewer 
(S.W.H.)  carried  out  the  search  separately;  another  author 
(K.R.) crosschecked the results.

Study selection

After removing all duplicates, 1 author (S.J.W.) and an addi-
tional  reviewer  (S.W.H.)  independently  screened  titles  and 
abstracts.  The  full  text  of  the  remaining  studies  determined 
final  inclusion  in  accordance  with  our  eligibility  criteria.  Of 
the 16 778 studies identified, 14 177 duplicates and 2572 irrele-
vant  papers  were  excluded  after  screening  titles  and  ab-
stracts. A full-text review of the remaining 29 studies resulted 
in  the  exclusion  of  a  further  11  studies,  including  1  rTMS 
study  written  in  Arabic,  because  the  paper  could  not  be  ac-
cessed  and  a  translation  could  not  be  obtained  from  the 
  authors49  (Appendix  1,  Table  S1).  This  resulted  in  18  peer- 
reviewed,  published  studies  (4  rTMS  and  14  tDCS;  total 
ADHD sample = 312), of which 12 anodal tDCS studies (total 
n  =  232)  were  eligible  for  meta-analysis  (for  the  list  of  ex-
cluded studies, see Appendix 1, Table S1). The final list of in-
cluded studies was agreed upon by consensus; any disagree-
ments were resolved by another author (K.R.).

Risk of bias assessment

We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s 
risk of bias tool,50 which rates risk of bias across 5 domains: 
selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias 
and other biases. Using this tool, S.J.W. and K.R. assessed risk 
of bias for all sham-controlled studies and resolved any dis-
agreements  by  consensus.  Because  the  tool  is  designed  for 
randomized  controlled  trials,  we  excluded  open-label 
 trials51,52 to avoid undue inflation of bias across domains. We 
included open-label trials in the systematic review for a com-
plete overview of available empirical studies.

Meta-analysis

Because of the small number of included studies, neither the 
clinical effects of rTMS and tDCS (n = 2 for each) nor the cog-
nitive effects of rTMS studies (n = 2) and cathodal tDCS (n = 
3)  could  be  subjected  to  meta-analysis.  Therefore,  we  con-
ducted a meta-analysis only on the cognitive effects of anodal 
tDCS (12 studies) in ADHD. We calculated effect sizes from 
reported  means  and  standard  deviations  or  t  and  f  values 
where  possible.  All  data  were  extracted  by  S.J.W.  We  used 
Plot Digitizer to convert plotted data to numerical values (for 
an example, see Westwood and Romani35), and we obtained 
any  unreported  data  by  personal  communication.  All  ex-
tracted data were cross-checked by K.R.

To  reduce  large  heterogeneity,  we  clustered  cognitive  out-
come measures into 3 domains and analyzed them in 3 separate 
meta-analyses. Such clustering of outcome measures into cogni-
tive  domains  was  informed  by  factor  analyses  of  executive-
function  measures  of  ADHD,  which  typically  cluster  into 

factors  that  comprise  measures  of  attention,  inhibition  and 
processing  speed.53–56  Accordingly,  for  attention  measures, 
we  included  the  numbers  or  percentages  of  errors  or  omis-
sion  errors  (or  the  inversely  reported  number  or  percentage 
of  correct  trials)  and  intrasubject  reaction  time  variability  or 
intrasubject coefficient of variation (intrasubject reaction time 
variability divided by mean reaction time) to go/congruent/
target  trials  in  go/no-go  tasks,  flanker  tasks,  Stroop  colour 
and  word  tasks  (Stroop),  working  memory  tasks  and  the 
Wisconsin  Card  Sorting  Task  (WCST).  For  inhibition  meas-
ures, we included the numbers or percentages of commission 
errors  (or  the  inversely  reported  number  or  percentage  of 
correct trials) to no-go trials in the go/no-go task; the number 
of percentage errors or reaction time to incongruent trials in 
flanker or Stroop tasks; the number of commission errors in 
continuous  performance  tasks  (CPTs)  or  MOXO  tasks;  stop 
signal reaction times in the stop task; perseverative errors in 
the  WCST;  and  multi-button  responses  in  the  MOXO  task. 
For  processing  speed,  we  included  mean  reaction  times  to 
go/congruent/target  trials  in  alertness,  CPT,  go/no-go  and 
MOXO tasks, and completion time in the WCST.

We  estimated  effect  sizes  using  small-sample-corrected 
standardized  mean  differences  (i.e.,  Hedges’  g),57  which  cal-
culated  the  difference  in  performance  under  sham  versus 
 anodal  tDCS  divided  by  pooled  standard  deviation  to  stan-
dardize the effect. We reported effects as positive if a cogni-
tive  outcome  measure  showed  improvement  with  anodal 
tDCS  relative  to  sham  stimulation,  and  as  negative  if  it 
showed deterioration. We conducted all meta-analyses using 
random-effects  models  to  account  for  heterogeneity  (i.e.,  ef-
fect size variation between studies beyond that expected for 
sampling error alone).58 To provide a measure of heterogen-
eity, we report the I2 value; I2 values of 75%, 50% and 25% re-
flect high, moderate and low heterogeneity, respectively.59

When  estimating  Hedges’  g  in  crossover  designs,  we  ac-
counted  for  the  correlation  between  pre  and  post  measures 
(otherwise, there would have been an underestimation of the 
effect sizes).57 Where multiple effects were reported from the 
same sample, we created composite effect sizes by averaging 
effect  sizes  and  decreasing  variances,  assuming  correlation 
across the different effects. Because tDCS studies did not re-
port  these  correlations,  we  estimated  the  crossover  correla-
tion from reported t values (25 of 60 reported outcomes) de-
rived  from  analyses  comparing  anodal  tDCS  with  sham 
stimulation, and we estimated the correlation across multiple 
dependent  outcomes  from  an  ongoing  neurotherapy  inter-
vention study in our laboratory with a sample of 74 adoles-
cents with ADHD tested before and after intervention in the 
Maudsley Attention and Response Suppression task battery, 
including  go/no-go  tasks,  CPTs,  Simon  tasks,  time  estima-
tion  tasks54  and  the  WCST.  Specifically,  we  assumed  a  cor-
relation of 0.629 between outcome measures for studies with 
crossover designs, and a correlation of 0.3 between the differ-
ent  effects  for  composite  effects.  In  addition,  we  conducted 
sensitivity  analyses  assuming  crossover  correlation  of  0.407 
and 0.780 (the upper and low 95% CIs of the estimated cor-
relation)  and  composite  correlation  of  0.1  and  0.5  to  test 
whether findings depended on our estimates.

Finally,  we  used  jackknife  sensitivity  analyses  (i.e.,  re-
peating  the  same  analysis  and  excluding  a  different  study 
each  time)  to  establish  the  replicability  of  findings.  To  im-
prove  homogeneity,  we  carried  out  additional  sensitivity 
analyses  that  excluded  studies  with  overlapping  sam-
ples,60–63  or  studies  with  methods  that  deviated  from  the 
majority of studies, such as those including community par-
ticipants with high ADHD symptoms on validated ADHD 
ratings  scales  but  without  a  clinical  ADHD  diagnosis;43,64 
those including adult samples with ADHD;42,65,66 those tar-
geting the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC);43,67 those report-
ing  change  scores  (i.e.,  post  minus  pre  differences)  rather 
than  post  scores  only;66  those  using  multi-stimulation  ses-
sions;60–62,65 those with effect sizes based on working mem-
ory  or  WCST  tasks;61,68  or  those  using  parallel  rather  than 
crossover  designs.62,66,67  Lastly,  given  that  effect-size  esti-
mates might be inflated in studies with a high risk of bias, 
we  conducted  meta-regression  analyses  to  compare  the 
 effect sizes of studies with high versus low or unclear risk of 
bias  for  each  risk  of  bias  domain  (i.e.,  selection  bias,  per-
formance  bias,  detection  bias,  attrition  bias  and  other 
 biases). All analyses were conducted by J.R.; meta-analysis 
calculations  were  conducted  using  the  function  “rma”  of 
the “metafor” package version 2.1 in R version 3.6.69,70

Literature review

rTMS studies
Two  double-blind,  crossover  studies  targeted  the  right 
dlPFC. In 13 adults with ADHD, 1 session of 20 Hz rTMS 
relative  to  sham  significantly  improved  overall  self-rated 
inattention  but  not  hyperactivity  symptoms.71  In  9  adults 
with  ADHD,  10  daily  sessions  of  10  Hz  rTMS  relative  to 
sham showed no effect on self-rated clinical symptoms, nor 
on  electroencephalography  or  executive-function  meas-
ures.72  In  a  single-blind  study  in  21  adolescents  with 
ADHD, 20 daily sessions of 18 Hz deep rTMS over the bi-
lateral dlPFC (n = 13) compared with sham (n = 9) showed 
no effect on self-rated clinical or cognitive measures of sus-
tained  attention.73  An  open-label  trial  in  10  children  with 
ADHD showed fewer teacher-rated inattention and parent-
rated  hyperactivity/impulsivity  symptoms  1  week  after 
5 daily sessions of 1 Hz rTMS of the left dlPFC compared 
with baseline.52 However, without sham control conditions, 
placebo effects could not be ruled out (Table 1).

tDCS studies
Fourteen  studies  tested  tDCS  in  ADHD;  9  studies  were 
double-blind, 4 studies were single-blind and 1 study was 
open-label.  Ten  studies  tested  children,  and  4  studies 
tested adults. Only 2 studies combined tDCS with cogni-
tive training (Table 2 and Table 3).

for ADHD on validated ADHD question-
naires  applied  a  single  session  of  anodal 
tDCS  over  the  left  dlPFC64  or  the  right 
IFC.43 Anodal relative to cathodal tDCS of 
the left dlPFC improved go accuracy, and 
cathodal  tDCS  improved  no-go  accuracy 
compared  with  anodal  tDCS  and  sham 
treatment,  but  none  improved  perform-
ance on the Stroop task.64 Right IFC anodal 
tDCS relative to sham treatment improved 
go accuracy, but there were no equivalent 
improvements  on  any  other  go/no-go  or 
Stroop task measures.43

Two  double-blind,  sham-controlled, 
crossover  studies  applied  single-session 
stimulation over the dlPFC. In 15 adoles-
cents  with  ADHD,  tDCS  over  the  bilat-
eral dlPFC (anode left/cathode right) im-
proved  WCST  completion  time  and 
n-back  and  Stroop  reaction  times  and 
errors  to  incongruent  trials,  but  had  no 
effects  on  n-back  accuracy  or  go/no-go 
measures.  Furthermore,  errors  and  reac-
tion  times  to  incongruent  trials  in  the 
Stroop  task  were  used  as  main  outcome 
measures, rather than the Stroop interfer-
ence or error effect (reaction time/errors 
on Stroop − reaction time/errors on con-
gruent trials) — the established key out-
come  measure  of  the  Stroop  task.  In 
10 adolescents with ADHD, anodal tDCS 
of the left dlPFC improved n-back work-
ing memory accuracy and reaction times 
compared  to  both  sham  treatment  and 
cathodal tDCS. Both anodal and cathodal 
tDCS  over  the  left  dlPFC  improved 
WCST  performance;  anodal  tDCS  had 
stronger effects. Cathodal tDCS of the left 
dlPFC  also  improved  no-go  accuracy, 
presumably  via  interhemispheric  inhibi-
tion increasing right prefrontal regions,68 
which  have  been  associated  with  motor 
response  inhibition  in  children  and 
adults.54,75 This explanation is partly sup-
ported by a single-blind crossover study 
in  21  adolescents  with  ADHD,  which 
found  that  1  session  of  anodal  (but  not 
cathodal) tDCS over the right IFC versus 
sham  treatment  reduced  errors  (trend 
level)  and  reaction  time  variability  in  a 
flanker  task.67  However,  as  in  the  previ-
ous  paper,68  findings  were  based  on 
flanker  incongruent  trials  rather  than  on 
flanker interference reaction time or error 
effect, and the analysis included only the 
first  session  to  remove  a  practice  effect, 
reducing the sample size to 7 participants 
per condition.

One double-blind, crossover study applied 5 daily sessions 
of anodal versus sham tDCS over the left dlPFC in 15 adoles-
cents with ADHD. The results showed improvements relative 
to sham treatment in parent-rated clinical measures of inatten-
tion and on cognitive measures of attention (as assessed using 
the  QbTest,  a  combined  working  memory  and  go/no-go 
task) 7 days after anodal tDCS but not immediately after, and 
improvements in QbTest measures of hyperactivity both im-
mediately  after  anodal  tDCS  and  7  days  later.  Clinical  and 
QbTest impulsiveness measures showed no effects. However, 
findings were based on the first 5 sessions to remove a carry-
over effect, reducing the sample to 7 or 8 participants per con-
dition.62  In  the  same  study,  13  of  the  15  adolescents  with 
ADHD  showed  reduced  reaction  time  variability  but  in-
creased  errors  on  the  QbTest  after  a  single  session  of  anodal 
tDCS. However, this analysis included a carryover effect.63

A  double-blind,  sham-controlled  crossover  study  found 
that relative to sham treatment, overnight slow-wave oscilla-
tory anodal tDCS over the left and right dlPFC improved de-
clarative  memory  in  12  children  with  ADHD61  and  go  reac-
tion  time  and  its  intrasubject  variability  in  14  children  with 
ADHD,60 but had no effects on no-go accuracy, or on meas-
ures of alertness, digit span or motor memory.

The only open-label trial in 9 children with ADHD found 
that  5  daily  sessions  of  anodal  tDCS  to  the  left  dlPFC  com-
bined  with  a  picture  association  cognitive  training  task  re-
duced errors on attention (omission) and switch tasks but did 
not  improve  working  memory.  Parents  reported  improve-
ments  in  some  of  their  children’s  behaviour  except  for  one, 
who reported their child was “much worse.” However, with-

out a sham control condition, findings could have been con-
founded by placebo, test–retest or cognitive training effects.51

tDCS studies in adults with ADHD
A  double-blind,  parallel  study  found  no  effects  of  a  single 
session  of  anodal  tDCS  over  the  left  dlPFC  relative  to  sham 
treatment  on  go/no-go  performance  in  60  adults  with 
ADHD.66  A  single-blind,  crossover  study  in  20  undergradu-
ates  with  ADHD  found  that  1  session  of  bifrontal  anodal 
tDCS over the left and right dlPFC relative to sham treatment 
improved  hyperactivity  measures  in  a  sustained  attention 
task  (i.e.,  multiple/random  responses),  but  not  omission  er-
rors  or  reaction  times.42  A  double-blind,  crossover  study  in 
37  adults  with  ADHD  found  that  3  sessions  over  alternate 
days  of  visual  working  memory  training  combined  with 
 anodal tDCS relative to sham tDCS of the left dlPFC reduced 
commission errors in a sustained attention task immediately 
after anodal tDCS, but not at the 3-day follow-up; there were 
no effects on omission errors, reaction times or stop task per-
formance  immediately  after  anodal  tDCS  or  3  days  later.65 
 Finally,  a  double-blind,  parallel  study  in  17  adults  with 
ADHD  reported  that  5  daily  sessions  of  anodal  right  tDCS 
(n = 9) relative to sham treatment (n = 8) improved inatten-
tion but not hyperactivity/impulsive symptoms immediately 
after  stimulation  and  2  weeks  later,  at  which  point  the  total 
ADHD score was also improved.

Safety in tDCS studies
Brain  stimulation  was  well  tolerated  overall;  the  most  com-
monly  reported  side  effects  were  mild  tingling  and  itching. 

E22 

J Psychiatry Neurosci 2021;46(1)

Westwood et al. One  study  reported  dropouts  because  of  tingling  sensations 
and  headache43  (Table  4).  There  was  1  case  of  an  adverse 
 effect, where 1 patient reported hypobulia after a single ses-
sion of anodal tDCS over the right dlPFC, which persisted in 
a milder form the following day.74

Summary of findings of tDCS studies
Findings were mixed. With respect to the clinical effects of 
tDCS, only 2 sham-controlled studies tested and found im-
provement in behavioural symptoms of inattention but not 
in  impulsiveness/hyperactivity  symptoms,  and  an  open-
label  trial  found  improvements  in  parent-rated  impression 
of  improvement  in  global  functioning.  Of  14  studies  that 
tested cognitive effects, 13 observed positive effects on some 
cognitive  functions  but  not  others,  and  1  reported  worse 
performance  in  a  sustained  attention  task.63  Moreover, 
7 sham-controlled studies did not correct for multiple com-
parisons,43,62–64,67,68  and  the  majority  of  their  findings  would 
not have survived correction.

Risk of bias
A minority of studies indicated unclear bias for selection (n = 
6), detection (n = 1) and attrition (n = 2), but on balance bias 
was  low  in  these  domains.  Performance  bias  (i.e.,  blinding 
participants  and  personnel)  was  unclear  in  11  studies  and 
high  in  2  studies;  selective  reporting  bias  and  other  biases 
(e.g., nonstandard outcome measures, no correction for mul-
tiple  testing,  lenient  significance  threshold)  were  high  in 
4 studies (Fig. 2; Appendix 1, Table S2).

Meta-analysis of anodal tDCS studies

The majority of the studies included in the meta-analysis (10 
of  12)  used  anodal  stimulation  of  mostly  left  dlPFC  regions 
(unilateral left, n = 5; bifrontal anode left and right, n = 3; bi-
lateral  anode  left/cathode  right,  n  =  2);  only  2  studies  in-
volved  unilateral  stimulation  of  the  right  IFC  (Table  2).  The 
meta-analyses showed no significant effect in measures of at-
tention (Hedges’ g = 0.18, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.45, p = 0.20) with 
high  heterogeneity  (I2  =  75%,  p  <  0.001)  and  trend-level  im-
provements in measures of inhibition (Hedge’s g = 0.21, 95% 
CI −0.01 to 0.43,  p = 0.06) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 
60%, p = 0.01) and of processing speed (Hedges’ g = 0.14, 95% 
CI −0.01 to 0.29, p = 0.07) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 3%, p = 
0.50;  Fig.  3).  Sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  that  these  find-
ings did not systematically rely on our estimated correlations 
for  effects  from  crossover  studies  or  for  composite  effect-
size estimates (Appendix 1, Table S3). Further, we replicated 
these  findings  in  the  jackknife  sensitivity  analyses  (i.e.,  re-
peating  the  main  analyses  but  excluding  a  different  study 
with each repetition), with only minor exceptions: excluding 
a  minority  of  individual  studies  led  to  a  significant  but  still 
small effect in measures of inhibition (excluding Cosmo and 
colleagues,66 Munz and colleagues60 and Soltaninejad and col-
leagues43)  and  in  processing  speed  (excluding  Allenby  and 
colleagues65 and Soltaninejad and colleagues;43 Table 5).

To improve homogeneity, we carried out additional sensi-
tivity analyses to exclude studies with overlapping samples, 
methods that departed from the majority of studies or studies

Brain stimulation in ADHD 
effects  when  the  analysis  was  limited  to  studies  that  used 
 single-session tDCS (Hedges’ g = 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41, p = 
0.02),  used  child  samples  (Hedges’  g  =  0.20,  95%  CI  0.01  to 
0.39,  p  =  0.04)  or  stimulated  mainly  the  left  dlPFC  (Hedges’ 
g = 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33, p = 0.04), all of which were asso-
ciated with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0, p = 0.51; I2 = 9, p = 0.41; 
I2 = 5, p = 0.50, respectively).

Finally, meta-regression analyses compared the effect sizes 
from  studies  with  a  high  risk  of  reporting  bias  versus  the 
 effect sizes from studies with low or unclear risk of such bias. 
At a descriptive level, the effect sizes from studies with high 
risk of reporting bias or “other” biases (e.g., no correction to 
multiple  testing,  lenient  α  level)  were  larger  than  the  effect 
sizes from studies with low or unclear risk. These differences 
were not statistically significant in any of the outcomes for re-
porting  bias  (lowest  p  =  0.14),  but  “other”  biases  yielded  a 
significant effect in measures of inhibition (p = 0.03) and pro-
cessing speed (p = 0.03). Because none of the studies showed 
high  risk  of  selection,  detection  or  attrition  bias,  and  only 

1  study  showed  high  risk  of  performance  bias,  we  did  not 
carry out meta-regression analyses for these biases.

Discussion

There  has  been  a  recent  proliferation  of  noninvasive  brain 
stimulation  studies  in  ADHD,  with  large  heterogeneity  in 
methodology  and  outcome  measures.  We  therefore  con-
ducted  a  systematic  review  of  rTMS  and  tDCS  studies.  Fur-
thermore,  we  conducted  a  rigorous  meta-analysis  of  tDCS 
studies in ADHD that clustered cognitive effects into clearly 
separated  cognitive  domains  to  increase  homogeneity,  con-
trolled  for  multiple  dependent  effects  and  potential  bias  of 
studies,  and  tested  the  replicability  of  meta-analysis  results 
with jackknife and other sensitivity analyses. The meta-analysis 
of tDCS studies of mostly the dlPFC showed only trend-level 
effects  on  improvement  of  inhibition  and  processing  speed, 
but  not  on  attention,  suggesting  limited  effects  of  tDCS  on 
cognition in children and adults with ADHD.

‡Only WCST and working memory data excluded.
§To remove overlapping samples, we excluded 1 study at a time.
¶These studies applied tDCS over multiple sessions; all others used one session.

The  findings  of  the  systematic  review  revealed  that  for 
rTMS, of the 4 included studies, only 2 measured and found 
clinical  effects,  while  the  other  2  measured  and  found  no 
effects  on  cognitive  functions.  For  tDCS,  12  of  the 
14 studies included in the systematic review stimulated the 
dlPFC with anodal tDCS, mostly over the left hemisphere 
(unilateral  left,  n  =  6;  bilateral  anode  left/cathode  right, 
n  =  2;  bifrontal  left  and  right,  n  =  3),  and  1  study  applied 
bilateral  cathodal  tDCS  over  the  left  dlPFC  (anode  right/
cathode  left),  and  2  studies  used  unilateral  anodal  tDCS 
over  the  right  IFC.  Only  2  sham-controlled  tDCS  studies 

measured  clinical  outcomes  and  found  that  anodal  tDCS 
over  the  left  or  right  dlPFC  improved  ADHD  inattention, 
but  not  impulsiveness/hyperactivity  symptoms,  immedi-
ately  after  tDCS  and  1  week62,74  or  2  weeks  later.74  This 
could  suggest  that  dlPFC  stimulation  can  improve  clinical 
inattention in ADHD, but this finding will need to be con-
firmed by future, larger studies.

Importantly, the rigorous meta-analysis of 12 tDCS studies 
applying  1  to  5  sessions  of  anodal  tDCS  of  mostly  left  or 
bilateral/bifrontal dlPFC (with the exception of Soltaninejad 
and colleagues43 and Breitling and colleagues67) showed only

Brain stimulation in ADHD 
trend-level  improvements  with  small  effect  sizes  in  inhibi-
tion and processing speed, but no effects on attention.

This systematic review of tDCS and rTMS studies showed 
that  there  is  very  limited  evidence  that  rTMS  and  tDCS  can 
have an effect on clinical symptoms based on a small sample 
of  3  sham-controlled  studies.  The  meta-analyses  showed  — 
albeit with small effect sizes — that 1 to 5 sessions of anodal 
tDCS  over  mostly  the  left  (but  also  bilateral  and  bifrontal) 
dlPFC  improved  performance  on  cognitive  measures  of 
inhib ition  and  processing  speed,  but  there  was  no  evidence 
for improvement in attention measures.

Given that 11 of 12 sham-controlled studies in the system-
atic review tested and found tDCS-induced improvement in 
1  or  more  executive-function  measures,42,43,60–65,67,68  the  find-
ings of the meta-analysis may seem disappointing. However, 
the lack of positive overall findings, despite positive findings 
in individual studies, was likely due to underpowered small 
study  effects  that  were  uncorrected  for  multiple  test-
ing43,62–64,67,68 and did not survive the scrutiny of meta-analysis. 
The decision to cluster cognitive outcome measures into do-
mains  for  the  meta-analysis  introduced  additional  hetero-
geneity, particularly in the attention and inhibition domains; 
the processing speed domain was more homogeneous.

The  relatively  small  trend-level  effect  on  inhibition  may 
have  been  related  to  the  fact  that  predominantly  the  right 
hemispheric  IFC  mediates  inhibitory  functions  in  children 
and  adults,74,76–84  and  that  meta-analyses  of  fMRI  studies  in 
ADHD show underactivation of the right IFC during inhibi-
tion tasks.5,6 Stimulation of the right IFC may be more effec-
tive  for  improving  inhibitory  functions  in  ADHD.  This  hy-
pothesis  is  supported  by  studies  in  healthy  adults  showing 
that  right  IFC  stimulation  improves  inhibitory  perform-
ance.85–88  The  meta-analysis  of  Salehinejad  and  colleagues41 
reported a similarly small, albeit significant, benefit (Hedges’ 
g = 0.12) with anodal tDCS of mostly the dlPFC on inhibitory 
measures, which survived when the analysis focused on ac-
curacy  measures  or  only  on  studies  stimulating  the  dlPFC. 
However, Salehinejad and colleagues41 included multiple de-
pendent effects in their meta-analyses, which could have re-
duced  variation  between  effect  sizes  and  therefore  overesti-
mated  significance.44,45  Further,  their  meta-analysis  included 
noninhibitory  measures  of  attention  (e.g.,  CPT  omission  er-
rors),  processing  speed  (e.g.,  reaction  times  to  go  trials)  and 
reaction  time  variability,41  and  therefore  was  not  specific  to 
inhibitory  control,  which  could  explain  the  differences  in 
findings compared to our meta-analysis.

Although  right  IFC  has  been  more  clearly  implicated  in 
motor  response  inhibition,  the  small,  trend-level  improve-
ment in inhibition in our meta-analyses, in line with the small 
significant  effect  of  Salehinejad  and  colleagues,41  may  have 
been  due  to  the  fact  that  a  majority  of  inhibitory  measures 
were  derived  from  interference  inhibition  tasks,  which  have 
been shown to be co-mediated by the left dlPFC and IFC89 — 
in  particular  the  Stroop  task.90–93  Further,  tDCS  studies  in 
healthy  adults  have  reported  improved  performance  on  in-
terference  inhibition  tasks  following  anodal  tDCS  of  the  left 
dlPFC.94–97 Given that only 2 studies stimulated the right IFC, 
future  studies  will  have  to  test  whether  inhibition  functions 

can be enhanced with anodal tDCS over the right IFC, which 
would be in line with neuroimaging evidence of a role of the 
right IFC in inhibitory control76,78,79,81,82,98–101 and evidence of its 
underactivation in ADHD,5,6,9 as well as with tDCS studies in 
healthy  adults  showing  that  right  IFC  stimulation  improves 
motor inhibitory performance.85–88

The  trend-level  positive  effect  of  tDCS  of  mostly  the  left 
dlPFC on processing speed is in line with fMRI evidence in-
dicating that the left dlPFC is a key mediating region of pro-
cessing speed.102–104 Interestingly, when the processing speed 
analysis  excluded  the  only  study  stimulating  the  right  IFC43 
—  and  therefore  included  only  studies  stimulating  mainly 
the left dlPFC (unilateral left, n = 5; bilateral, n = 1; bifrontal 
anodal left and right, n = 2)—the improvement in processing 
speed  became  significant,  in  line  with  neuroimaging  evi-
dence that the left dlPFC mediates processing speed and sug-
gesting  that  the  left  dlPFC  is  an  optimal  site  for  enhancing 
processing speed in ADHD. These findings are partly in line 
with  those  of  the  meta-analysis  by  Salehinejad  and  col-
leagues,41 which  showed  that  predominantly  anodal  tDCS 
over  the  left  dlPFC  improved  reaction  times  and  its  intra-
subject variability in n-back tasks.

The  lack  of  systematic  positive  effects  on  attention  meas-
ures may have been because predominantly the right dlPFC 
and IFC mediate attention, as evidenced by individual stud-
ies  and  meta-analyses  of  fMRI  studies  in  children  and 
adults,77–79,84,105–107  and  in  meta-analyses  of  fMRI  studies  in 
ADHD,  which  show  functional  underactivation  of  the  right 
dlPFC/IFC  during  attention  tasks.6  It  is  therefore  possible 
that stimulation of the right dlPFC and/or right IFC may be 
more effective for improving attention functions in ADHD.

This meta-analysis of tDCS studies shows that anodal tDCS 
of mostly left dlPFC has only very limited, trend-level effects on 
improving  inhibition  and  processing  speed,  with  no  evidence 
for  attention  improvement.  However,  we  cannot  rule  out  the 
possibility that stimulation of other prefrontal regions (such as 
the right hemispheric IFC or dlPFC or parietal regions), multi-
ple session tDCS or tDCS in combination with cognitive train-
ing could improve clinical or cognitive functions in ADHD.

With respect to safety, stimulation was well tolerated over-
all,  but  1  tDCS  study  reported  higher  errors  on  a  sustained 
attention task63 and another study reported a hypobulia epi-
sode in 1 patient,74 raising neuroethical concerns of potential 
costs  to  nontargeted  functions.38,108  It  has  been  shown  that 
stimulation  of  a  particular  region  could  impair  functions 
 mediated by other regions such as the homologue contralat-
eral  region  via  interhemispheric  inhibition  or  other  regions 
that are top-down controlled by the stimulated region.109,110

Future studies need to address the lack of knowledge about 
optimal stimulation protocols for children with ADHD. Cur-
rent  knowledge  about  stimulation  effects  on  the  brain  and 
standard  protocols  are  largely  derived  from  adult  samples 
and are therefore not appropriate for children.108,111 In healthy 
adults,  multi-session  stimulation  combined  with  cognitive 
training  may  lead  to  longer-term  effects,30,112  but  we  do  not 
know whether this protocol can lead to maladaptive plasticity 
in the developing brain, especially during “sensitivity periods,” 
where  use-dependent  plasticity  changes  are  strongest113  and 

E28

Westwood et al. the  possibility  of  longer-term  side  effects  when  using  nonin-
vasive brain stimulation in pediatric samples needs more em-
pirical  investigation.  Future  studies  should  heed  recommen-
dations  to  comprehensively  assess  effects  in  children  to 
capture possible unintended outcomes.110,114

It should also be noted that the current findings refer only 
to studies using 1 to 20 Hz rTMS and conventional tDCS of 
dlPFC in ADHD. Other noninvasive brain stimulation proto-
cols may be effective in ADHD, such as theta burst stimula-
tion,115 transcranial alternating current stimulation,116,117 trans-
cranial  random  noise  stimulation118,119  or  trigeminal  nerve 
stimulation (TNS).120.121

Limitations

Conclusive  evidence  of  this  systematic  review  of  rTMS  and 
tDCS and meta-analysis of anodal tDCS in ADHD is limited 
by  the  large  heterogeneity  between  studies  with  respect  to 
stimulation  protocols  (coil/electrode  placement,  number  of 
sessions,  stimulation  intensity,  crossover/parallel  design), 
sample age and cognitive outcome measures.

Furthermore,  limitations  in  individual  studies  were  also 
present, such as tDCS electrode placement, low power, small 
effect sizes, biased reporting or insufficient blinding. Specif-
ically, although all but 2 of 12 tDCS studies included in the 
meta-analysis stimulated the left dlPFC, electrode placement 
was  bilateral  (anode  left/cathode  right)  in  2  studies66,68  and 
bifrontal (anode left and right) in 3 studies.42,60,61 Bilateral or 
bifrontal tDCS could have had a neutral effect, given that the 
short  inter-electrode  distance  causes  greater  current  shunt-
ing  across  the  scalp  and  cerebral  spinal  fluid,  resulting  in 
only  an  estimated  35%  of  current  reaching  the  brain.122  In 
fact, it has been shown that bilateral electrode montage over 
the  primary  motor  cortex  can  have  neurologically  neutral 
 effects.123 With regards to  low power, only 2 studies65,66 had 
more  than  30  participants;  the  sample  size  across  all  other 
studies  was  relatively  small,  with  an  average  of  14  partici-
pants (with an n range of 7 to 20). Key outcome measures in 
interference  inhibition  tasks  such  as  the  Stroop  and  flanker 
reaction  time  or  error  interference  effects  (incongruent  − 
congruent reaction times/errors) were not reported; instead, 
reaction  times  to  incongruent  trials  were  used  to  measure 
cognitive effects, meaning that effects on interference inhibi-
tion  measures  were  confounded  by  processing  speed.64,67,68 
Blinding integrity was not reported in 2 studies,43,64 failed in 
3 studies65,67,71 and was potentially compromised in 3 studies, 
where  at  least  60%  of  participants  correctly  identified  the 
stimulation  type;62,63,74  thus,  placebo  effects  cannot  be  ex-
cluded. The meta-analysis of tDCS studies was hampered by 
the  fact  that  only  a  minority  of  included  studies  controlled 
for  baseline  differences  by  analyzing  change  scores  (i.e., 
post-treatment minus baseline;62,65,66), while other studies an-
alyzed  only  post-measurement  scores  to  establish  effects. 
 Finally,  the  meta-regression  analysis  showed  that  studies 
with a high risk of “other” biases (e.g., no correction for mul-
tiple  testing,  selective  reporting  of  outcome  measures  or 
 using  a  lenient  significance  threshold43,62–64,67,68)  reported 
larger  effect  sizes  than  studies  with  low  or  unclear  risk  of 

this bias, meaning that summary effect size estimates might 
have  been  overestimated.  In  early  rTMS  studies,  the  same 
research  practices  unduly  inflated  positive  effects  and 
slowed  its  uptake  as  an   effective  treatment  of  depres-
sion;124,125 the field risks doing the same with rTMS and tDCS 
in  ADHD.  Moreover,  with  tDCS  there  is  an  added  danger 
that  children  and  parents  —  faced  with  apparent  positive 
findings  —  will  self-administer  given  the  widely  available 
“do-it-yourself  tDCS”  material  online  or  commercial  de-
vices,  one  of  which  has  been  shown  to  impair  working 
memory.40 Given the neuroethical concerns of brain stimula-
tion with respect to potential negative effects on nontargeted 
functions,38,108,114 future researchers are duty-bound to report 
results to the highest possible standard.114

A  final  limitation  of  this  meta-analysis  is  that  it  was  not 

preregistered.

Conclusion

Based  on  current  evidence,  neither  rTMS  nor  tDCS  of  the 
dlPFC can be recommended as an alternative neurotherapy 
for ADHD as yet. More studies are needed to assess clinical 
efficacy,  and  the  demonstrated  cognitive  effects  have  been 
small and nonsignificant. However, we cannot rule out the 
possibility  that  rTMS  or  tDCS  or  other  stimulation  modal-
ities  of  other  regions  —  or  even  of  the  same  region  but 
 using  a  larger  number  of  sessions,  different  amplitude  or 
other  par ameters,  or  combined  with  cognitive  training  — 
may  be  more  effective.  Furthermore,  conclusive  evidence 
from this systematic review of rTMS and tDCS studies and 
meta-analysis of tDCS studies in ADHD was hampered by 
heterogeneity in stimulation protocols, sample age and cog-
nitive outcome measures. Larger, double-blind, randomized 
controlled  trials  with  homogeneous  protocols  testing  sys-
tematically  for  more  optimal  designs  (e.g.,  multi-session 
stimulation  combined  with  cognitive  training,  targeting 
right  dorsal  and  ventral  frontal  or  inferior  parietal  re-
gions),9,126 and testing both clinical and cognitive outcomes, 
are needed to provide better insights into clinical and cogni-
tive effects, and to provide clear guidance on optimal stimu-
lation protocols. Future studies should also be wary of over-
stating  positive  effects  and  account  for  possible  cognitive 
costs of tDCS and rTMS in children.
