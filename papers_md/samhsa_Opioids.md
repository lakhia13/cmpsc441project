Prescription drug misuseis when someone takes a medication the wrong way.

- Taking too much, or too often, or too long.

- Using it for something it wasn’t prescribed for ― the feeling it gives you, to relieve tension, sleep, or be alert or study.

- Taking a medication that wasn’t prescribed to you ― getting it from a family member or friend.

- Taking it in a way other than directed (such as crushing pills).

- Taking it with alcohol or other drugs.

Common prescriptions ― which can be misused and/or lead to addiction ― include:

- Pain relievers ― such as opioids

- Stimulants ― such as ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) medication

- Sedatives and Tranquilizers ― for anxiety or sleep

For pain,know your options. Ask your doctor:

- Are you recommending a medication?If so, is it an opioid?What other options do I have (non-opioid medications, physical therapy, alternative therapies, self-care, or high-tech treatments)?

- If so, is it an opioid?

- What other options do I have (non-opioid medications, physical therapy, alternative therapies, self-care, or high-tech treatments)?

- How do I safely stop taking my medication?

- What should I expect of the medication (will it decrease pain, rather than eliminate pain)?

- What should I do if my pain treatment isn’t working?

Opioid overdose is life-threatening. Overdose can happen, even with a prescription opioid. Naloxone can reverse an opioid overdose.

Criminal drug networks are mass-producingfake prescription pills (PDF | 5.6 MB)― and marketing them as the real thing. They’re often sold on mainstream social media sites and websites. So they’re available to anyone ― including kids.

Manyfake pillslook just like real medications, such as:

- Oxycodone (Oxycontin®, Percocet®)

- Hydrocodone (Vicodin®)

- Alprazolam (Xanax®)

- Stimulants like amphetamines (Adderall®)

Fake pills often contain fentanyl ― and can be deadly:

- DEA lab tests found that 6 out of every 10 pills with fentanyl contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. A lethal dose of fentanyl (2 milligrams) – is equal in size to about 10-15 grains of table salt.

- Animal tranquilizers (even more potent than fentanyl) have also been found in fake prescription pills and illicit drugs.

Your medications should:

- Come from a licensed, accredited medical professional.

- Be prescribed to you ― not to someone else.

- Be dispensed by a licensed pharmacist at a pharmacy.
