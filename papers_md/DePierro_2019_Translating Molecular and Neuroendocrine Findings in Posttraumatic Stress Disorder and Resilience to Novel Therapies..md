Abstract

Many biological systems are altered in association with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and 
resilience. However, there are only few approved pharmacological treatments for PTSD, and no 
approved medications to enhance resilience. This paper provides a critical review of select 
neurobiological findings in PTSD and resilience, and also of pharmacologic approaches that have 
emerged from this work. The medications summarized involve engagement with targets in the 
adrenergic, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems. 
Other highlighted approaches involve the use of ketamine and 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy, which recently surfaced as 
promising strategies for PTSD though the neurobiological mechanisms underlying their actions, 
including for promoting resilience, are not yet fully understood. The former approaches fall within 
the broad concept of “rational pharmacotherapy” in that they attempt to directly target 
dysregulated systems known to be associated with post-traumatic symptoms. To the extent that use 
of ketamine and MDMA promote symptom improvement and resilience in PTSD, this provides an 
opportunity for reverse-translation and identification of relevant targets and mechanism of action 
through careful study of biological changes resulting from these interventions. Promoting 
resilience in trauma-exposed individuals may involve more than pharmacologically manipulating 
dysregulated molecules and pathways associated with developing and sustaining PTSD symptom 
severity, but also producing a substantial change in mental state that increases the ability to engage 
with traumatic material in psychotherapy. Neurobiological examination in the context of treatment 
studies may yield novel targets and promote a greater understanding of mechanisms of recovery 
from trauma.

Introduction

Page 2

Shortly after the appearance of PTSD in the psychiatric nosology (1), and again more 
recently (2), Friedman suggested that optimal pharmacotherapy for PTSD would result from 
targeting unique features of its pathophysiology. Friedman’s original statement was made 
when little was known about the biology of PTSD, but many believed its distinct clinical 
presentation and relationship to environmental exposure would necessitate novel treatments. 
As early neurochemical and neuroendocrine findings in PTSD emerged, it seemed 
reasonable to develop pharmacotherapeutic strategies based on reversing the observed 
dysregulation.

Despite evidence implicating numerous biological systems in PTSD (3-6), there are few 
medications with demonstrated efficacy. The lack of pharmacologic strategies following 
great investment in translational and biological studies is thought by some to constitute a 
crisis (7). Fortunately, advances in understanding the neurobiology of resilience offered 
potentially new targets associated with trauma recovery or promotion of post-traumatic 
growth. These findings include mechanisms involved in brain plasticity and cognition that 
could be targeted to lessen the severity of PTSD symptoms and facilitate a change in 
perspective or meaning (3, 4). For the purpose of this review, resilience is defined broadly as 
the ability to adapt to adversity and trauma (4), ranging from resistance to bouncing back 
from trauma exposure to recovery from PTSD, the latter often involving restorative/re-
integrative processes of healing accomplished via successful treatment (8, 9).

Currently approved medications for PTSD are limited to selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), initially tested because of their effectiveness in depression, and therefore 
not a reflection of the vision of a rational pharmacotherapy based on a translational model of 
discovery. Table 1 provides a summary of compounds that have been examined and the 
targets hypothesized to explain their actions (see Supplement for an elaborated version of the 
table).

That advances in the neurobiology of PTSD have not led to novel treatment approaches 
raises questions concerning the extent to which a translational approach that identifies, and 
then seeks to reverse, perturbed biological systems associated with PTSD symptoms will 
yield treatments that produce sufficient recovery from the effects of trauma for the majority 
of patients. Traumatic exposures result not only in behavioral symptoms, but in a disruption 
of the survivor’s world views, priorities, and interests. Developing this change in outlook 
might require activating resilience-related pathways that are distinct from those that 
contribute to behavioral symptoms.

In considering how neuroscience has, and will continue, to catalyze treatment development 
in PTSD it should be noted that current treatment guidelines (10, 11) have uniformly 
designated psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as a first line

treatment. CBT is thought to be supported by translational models involving fear extinction, 
and may therefore reflect a target-driven treatment for PTSD (12, 13). Recent research has 
demonstrated effects in normalizing disrupted patterns in brain connectivity (14). While 
questions remain about whether a single course of CBT is sufficient to achieve recovery for 
survivors with extreme or repeated trauma (15, 16), that psychotherapy alters dysregulated 
biological circuits provides an object lesson for translational neuroscience inviting inquiry 
into a broader set of targets that might work in synergy with pharmacotherapy. Currently, 
pharmacotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to psychotherapy, or an approach when 
psychotherapy is not available (10, 17), with the caveat that medications constitute “low 
effect” treatments (11).

In clinical practice many patients with PTSD are prescribed psychotropic medications 
without psychotherapy either because the patient does not want, failed to respond, dropped 
out, or had adverse reactions, to psychotherapy. Physicians often use medications off label 
and/or prescribe several medications concurrently. Yet many patients remain chronically 
symptomatic. The failure to successfully treat PTSD with pharmacotherapy alone may 
reflect that the ultimate biological targets for PTSD symptom reversal have not been 
identified, or that clinically-relevant subtyping has yet to inform personalized therapeutic 
options. Target activation with the medication may be enhanced through engagement with 
the traumatic material. Bringing the traumatic memory into consciousness may even activate 
similar biological circuits to those targeted by medications. However it is not currently 
known whether pharmacological activation of these same circuits would yield similar effects 
as psychotherapy (18). Alternatively, medications may activate biological targets that might 
maximize response to trauma-focused psychotherapy.

This review examines selected molecular and neuroendocrine findings in PTSD and 
resilience from the perspective of rational pharmacotherapy. It also examines how 
identification of biological targets may come about using neurobiological analysis of 
treatments that have not been born from traditional rational pharmacotherapy approaches.

Candidate Therapeutic Targets

Adrenergic System

Initial studies in PTSD showed increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal and 
elevated basal levels of catecholamines such as norepinephrine (19-22). Furthermore, 
administration of the alpha2-receptor antagonist yohimbine precipitated flashbacks (23). 
Subsequent studies confirmed central and peripheral noradrenergic system involvement in 
trauma-related processes, including fear and extinction learning, depression, anxiety and 
resilience (22, 24).

Medications targeting central and peripheral adrenergic hyperactivity, such as alpha2 
agonists clonidine and guanfacine, have met with limited success (25, 26). An exception is 
the alpha1 adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, which showed a signal for treatment of 
nightmares (27). The promising results of initial prazosin trials (28) led to fairly broad use of 
the drug in Veteran Affairs and private settings (e.g. (29)), though a recent large scale study 
did not show efficacy for prazosin above placebo in moderating nightmare severity (30). The

β-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol has been of interest in the context of blocking the 
consolidation or reconsolidation of traumatic memories (31). Propranolol decreased fear 
learning in animals (32), though data regarding its effect on emotional memory in people are 
less straightforward.

Given the importance of the adrenergic systems in mediating hyperarousal and re-
experiencing symptoms in PTSD, as well as fear learning, extinction, and reconsolidation 
the lack of a translatable pharmacologic treatment for PTSD based on noradrenergic 
manipulation has been disappointing. The findings imply that reducing both central and 
peripheral SNS arousal directly might not be sufficient for promoting recovery; however, it 
remains plausible that individuals with clear adrenergic dysregulation (33) may benefit from 
these therapies

Although medications such as propranolol have not produced a robust treatment signal for 
treatment or prevention of PTSD (31), they might augment psychotherapy if used prior to 
reactivation of trauma memories (34). The question that arises is whether exposure therapies 
are enhanced or disrupted by manipulating arousal or distress at reminders during early 
phases of treatment. Reducing distress may help patients better access traumatic memories 
in therapy. However, initial distress might facilitate more powerful extinction or 
desensitization with subsequent exposures. Indeed, a single-dose of yohimbine prior to 
exposure therapy increased in-session subjective distress and physiological arousal, but 
produced lower heart rate reactivity to trauma reminders at one-week follow up, without 
influencing PTSD scores (35).

Glucocorticoid System

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the major constituent of the 
neuroendocrine response to acute and chronic stress and has been well characterized. 
Cortisol is involved in the regulation and containment of the SNS and parasympathetic 
responses to stress, both adaptive responses that help the body adapt to a stressor. The 
autoregulation of the normal stress response initiated by cortisol (through negative feedback 
inhibition) helps restore stress-related reactions to baseline after the termination of the acute 
stressor (36). An efficient negative feedback inhibition (secondary to enhanced 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsiveness) results in attenuated cortisol elevations in 
response to stress, thereby increasing the body’s exposure to its own catecholamines (37) .

When HPA axis dysregulation has been noted in chronic PTSD, it is generally altered in a 
paradoxical direction with elevated corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels despite 
decreased levels of cortisol. The cortisol response to dexamethasone is greater, reflecting 
enhanced responsiveness of GR in the pituitary (37-40). This profile differs from that 
observed in depression in which both elevated CRH and cortisol levels are present with 
diminished GR responsiveness (37). Differences in cortisol signaling in PTSD also 
contribute to abnormally reduced exposure of some afferent pathways to cortisol thereby 
contributing to increased sympathetic activation (41-43). Since catecholamines facilitate the 
consolidation of memories (44), and cortisol facilitates extinction and interferes with fear 
memory reconsolidation (45), suboptimal levels of cortisol in the face of greater SNS

activation might facilitate the formation of the durable traumatic memories that characterize 
PTSD (46).

Attempts to utilize HPA axis interventions in chronic PTSD are challenging because chronic 
administration of steroids in non-endocrine conditions can have unintended consequences, 
and is ill-advised when hormone levels are in the endocrinologically normal range. Ideal 
HPA interventions would be short term, and designed to recalibrate a dysregulated feedback 
loop. However, such strategies have not yielded powerful results to date. A multi-site phase 
II randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the GR antagonist, mifepristone, comprised of 600 mg 
daily dose for one week, indicated no overall advantage over placebo for PTSD symptoms 
(47). Subgroup analysis indicated that combat veterans without a history of mild TBI 
experienced significant symptom improvements with mifepristone. Dunlop et al. (48) 
showed no improvement in PTSD in a placebo-controlled trial of a CRH type-1 receptor 
antagonist. While targeting the HPA axis would appear to constitute a rational 
pharmacotherapy approach based on the unique alterations in PTSD, glucocorticoid-based 
treatments have not yielded significant treatment gains in chronic PTSD.

The HPA axis may, however, be a target for secondary PTSD prevention. A serendipitous 
observation that hydrocortisone as part of standard treatment following septic shock 
improved mental health outcomes (49) led to a controlled trial demonstrating that 
corticosteroids administered following major surgery resulted in higher quality of life 6 
months later (50). Based on the idea that lower cortisol levels at the time of trauma exposure 
might facilitate SNS hyperactivity and lead to intrusive, traumatic memories, this strategy of 
glucocorticoid administration during the “golden hours” following trauma was used to 
identify its role in PTSD prevention (51, 52). A Cochrane review (53) concluded that 
hydrocortisone treatment in the acute aftermath of trauma is the only preventive 
pharmacological agent with a convincing evidence base now. If replicated, this treatment 
would constitute rational psychopharmacology for PTSD prophylaxis.

Augmentation of psychotherapy with hydrocortisone has also been examined to enhance 
reconsolidation of emotional memories working synergistically with prolonged exposure 
(PE), a cognitive behavioral therapy. An initial case report found greater improvement in 
PTSD symptoms post-exposure treatment relative to placebo (54), and a follow-up placebo-
controlled study observed that responders to hydrocortisone augmentation had greater GR 
sensitivity at treatment initiation (55). Hydrocortisone administered immediately following 
an exposure therapy session resulted in lower avoidance and numbing symptoms one week 
later, when participants were experimentally presented with their trauma narratives (56). 
Interestingly, the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, was found to have no added 
benefit in virtual-reality-based PTSD treatment in veterans, and was associated with greater 
drop-out relative to placebo (57). Unlike hydrocortisone, dexamethasone does not cross the 
blood-brain barrier, thus while dexamethasone reduces endogenous cortisol via negative 
inhibition at the pituitary, it may amplify low cortisol effects in the brain in a 
pathophysiologic direction.

Neuropeptide Y

Page 6

Laboratory work since the 1990s has implicated neuropeptide Y (NPY) in modulating stress 
responses (for review, see (58)). NPY, a neuropeptide implicated in anxiety-related behavior, 
regulates HPA-axis activity by stimulating release of ACTH and corticosterone, and 
decreases SNS activity through inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic 
noradrenergic neurons. An initial study conducted in soldiers during survival school training 
demonstrated increases in plasma NPY levels following uncontrollable stress in Special 
Forces soldiers, considered more resilient, than in non-Special Forces soldiers. Higher NPY 
levels during stress were associated with better behavioral performance scores, lower self-
reported dissociation, and higher cortisol responses, suggesting that NPY might be 
associated with resilience during uncontrollable stress (59). Other studies demonstrated 
lower plasma NPY levels and blunted NPY response to yohimbine in men with combat-
related PTSD (60), and higher plasma NPY levels in combat-exposed veterans who 
recovered from, compared to those who never had, PTSD (61). Veterans with chronic PTSD 
were also found to have lower concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NPY relative to healthy 
controls (62). Moreover, individuals with the low NPY expression diplotype evidenced 
greater amygdala reactivity to fearful faces (63).

A recent small-scale study tested ascending-doses of intranasal NPY administration in a 
cross-over placebo-controlled study, and found that higher doses (e.g. 9.6 mg) were 
associated with greater reductions in self-reported anxiety following a trauma script 
symptom provocation (64). Additional studies are needed to evaluate the full potential of 
NPY for the treatment or prevention of PTSD. If effective, this treatment would also 
constitute a rational psychopharmacological approach.

Promising pharmacologic strategies offering an opportunity for reverse translation

Ketamine: Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was 
in use in 1970 as an anesthetic but became a drug of abuse due to its dissociative effects 
(65). It was subsequently observed to relieve depressive symptoms and later demonstrated to 
be effective for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (66-68). Recently, its S(+) enantiomer 
esketamine administered intranasally received FDA approval for TRD in conjunction with 
an oral antidepressant (69). Ketamine has very rapid effects, acting through glutamatergic 
signaling as well as secondary brain-derived neurotrophic factor, mammalian targeting of 
rapamycin (mTOR), and other signaling pathways (70). At the time its antidepressant effects 
were noted, the potential involvement of the glutamate system in depression was a nascent 
idea. However, because the drug was already an FDA-approved compound, research could 
begin prior to a more complete understanding of the drug’s neurobiological mechanism(s) of 
action. Ketamine’s actions have led to a greater understanding of the role of glutamatergic 
function in psychiatric disorders (71).

The initial success of ketamine in TRD trials prompted an interest in ketamine’s potential 
rapid acting effects in PTSD (72-74). A controlled trial using single-dose intravenous 
ketamine (vs. midazolam) demonstrated rapid reduction in PTSD and depressive symptom 
severity 24-hours post-infusion (74). Coupled with findings from structural and functional 
imaging studies, these data have contributed to the hypothesis that PTSD is a “synaptic

disconnection syndrome” (75). Ketamine has been found to increase prefrontal connectivity 
in depressed patients (76, 77)—a circuit thought to be disrupted in PTSD (78, 79). The 
initial promising findings for PTSD require replication, and ongoing trials are in progress 
(73) to determine the duration of potential symptom improvement and maintenance with 
repeated infusions. If successful, this represents an exciting, contrasting paradigm for drug 
development, where medications with promise might lead to a greater understanding of 
disease pathophysiology.

Treatment with rapid-acting medications such as ketamine has prompted the investigation of 
the role of plasticity in the pathophysiology and treatment of PTSD (75). PTSD-associated 
synaptic loss, linked to diminished plasticity, has been identified in human post-mortem 
tissue (80) and suggested by imaging results (reviewed in (75)). Previously discussed 
mechanisms in PTSD such as changes in GR signaling, inflammatory changes, and 
alterations in cortisol level also affect synaptic loss, suggesting downstream effects of these 
disparate systems to a potential final common pathway (75). Therapeutic effects may occur 
via restoring synaptic connectivity by increasing dendritic spines as evidenced by the 
observation that ketamine rapidly reversed the synaptic spine deficits caused by chronic 
stress in the prefrontal cortex in animal studies (81).

A state of induced plasticity, known as “iPlasticity” (82) may allow for environmental 
stimuli such as rehabilitation to reorganize pathological networks and may be a key factor in 
resilience. Early data postulates that serotonergic psychedelics, which have been referred to 
as “psychoplastogens,” increase neuritogenesis, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis to a 
comparable or greater degree than ketamine (83). The effect is believed to be mediated by 
engagement of serotonergic-2A receptors (84), and there are many examples to suggest that 
increasing serotonin levels affects one’s sensitivity to the environment (85). An important 
future direction of treatment may involve catalyzing elements of psychotherapy by creating 
optimal neural conditions—in this case, perhaps re-opening a critical period of plasticity 
during which relevant circuits can be engaged and manipulated via targeted psychological 
rehabilitation (86).

MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy: MDMA is an amphetamine-derivative belonging to a 
class of agents known as psychedelics, which promote feelings of euphoria, empathy and 
trust (87-89). MDMA was first synthesized in 1912, and its ability to catalyze psychotherapy 
by rapid promotion of introspection and insight in a therapeutic setting was observed 
anecdotally by the late 1970s (90, 91). MDMA increases release of pre-synaptic serotonin 
and increases activity at serotonin-2A receptors; is also increases peripheral dopamine (92), 
cortisol and prolactin (88), and oxytocin (88, 93). Like ketamine, MDMA became popular as 
a recreational substance (“ecstasy”). Unlike ketamine, MDMA was classified as a Schedule I 
drug in 1986 and remained that way, effectively blocking investigation into its clinical safety 
and efficacy for psychiatric conditions until recently (94, 95). MDMA was granted 
Investigational New Drug status for PTSD in 2004 in the United States after extensive 
advocacy efforts (95), and was FDA-designated as a “breakthrough therapy” for PTSD in 
2017.

Phase-II trials for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy have yielded promising results for PTSD. 
An initial trial in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD with a mean duration of 20 years 
demonstrated an effect size of 1.24 and 83% remission rate (96). Long-term follow-up 
indicated that these responses were durable several years after original dosing (97). The 
positive and long-term effects were replicated in several other phase II RCTs with remission 
in treatment-refractory patients varying somewhat by dose, but at its most conservative, 54% 
(vs. 23% placebo) of patients achieved full remission. Though initial trials with multiple 
groups in several countries have been promising, the efficacy of MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy will depend on the outcome of phase III trials currently underway (98). 
Similarly to ketamine, effect sizes may also not be comparable to other treatments given that 
a truly blinded placebo-control condition is difficult given the strong, generally euphoric 
effects of MDMA; therefore, comparison to a current approved treatment will ultimately 
prove informative.

Importantly, and unlike ketamine, treatment with MDMA occurs in the context of a 
psychotherapy protocol where patients receive several preparation sessions prior to two or 
three full sessions with MDMA, and several integration sessions following each session. The 
sessions with MDMA last about 8 hours, and are facilitated by two co-therapists who 
provide psychotherapy as traumatic material is brought forward by the patient. The patient is 
generally not distressed, but relaxed and introspective. In all, patients receive about 40 hours 
of psychotherapy with two providers simultaneously, which is twice the length of a course of 
CBT (98).

Initial concerns were raised about the potential for abuse of a recreational drug and the 
possibility of use-related cognitive impairment (99-101). However, the study finding 
dopaminergic neurotoxicity in non-human primates presumed to have been given MDMA 
was retracted when it was discovered the animals were mistakenly given methamphetamine 
(102). While safety data are important, there are significant limitations in comparing adverse 
events in those reporting recreational use vs. those enrolled in a controlled clinical trial. For 
example, adverse cognitive effects noted in recreational users report lifetime dosages 
20-400x that of the cumulative dose used in treatment (103). In contrast, no cognitive 
impairments were noted in the phase-II trials that featured neuropsychological assessments 
(98). Safety monitoring and restricted access to medications will need to continue in the 
early stages of clinical use. The careful psychotherapy protocol in association with MDMA 
are essential to the actions of this treatment and is absent in recreational use. Nonetheless, it 
is important to consider the potential for misuse of any medication that has rapid acting 
effects in improving mood states.

Like ketamine, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was not designed to engage a target in a 
mechanistic neural pathway, but its positive effect on patients suffering from PTSD has 
warranted scientific inquiry into its neural and molecular actions. MDMA may work by 
creating the optimal neuronal conditions to establish a corrective event as significant as the 
trauma. A recent pre-clinical study (104) elucidated a potential pathway involving re-
opening of the critical period of social learning via oxytocin-dependent induction of long-
term depression in the nucleus accumbens, but this needs follow-up study in humans. It has 
recently been suggested that MDMA assists the psychotherapeutic process by reducing

activation in brain regions implicated in the expression of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors 
(amygdala and insula), and increasing connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus. 
In this manner, MDMA may allow for reprocessing of traumatic memories and emotional 
engagement with therapeutic processes in an optimized physical and mental state (105). 
Phenomenologically, MDMA seems to optimize important components of psychotherapy: it 
reportedly facilitates an optimal level of arousal while processing traumatic memories, 
increases empathy towards self, catalyzes therapeutic alliance and trust between the patient 
and the provider and promotes feelings of and desire for connectedness. These factors may 
allow the patient to engage and process trauma with self-compassion and without feeling 
overwhelmed (106).

Discussion and Future Considerations

A major purpose of researching the pathophysiology of PTSD is to identify biological 
dysregulations that might be the proximal cause of symptoms. However, targeting pathways 
or systems that are altered in PTSD has not led to drastic reductions in PTSD symptoms 
(e.g. (30, 31, 107)). Rather, among the most promising strategies for PTSD are ketamine and 
MDMA, compounds that have not emerged from basic research. If they are consistently 
effective in clinical trials, these strategies will prompt laboratory studies of their mechanism 
of action that may contribute to a more complete picture of risk and resilience pathways.

The limited success of approaches thus far may reflect that biological findings consistently 
observed in association with PTSD may not represent key drivers of symptoms, or 
limitations in methods of observation, including that many biological studies have been 
performed on blood samples alone, due to the unavailability of brain tissue. A limited 
number of studies have simultaneously evaluated multiple putative biological pathways (e.g. 
(108-110)), yet PTSD appears to represent a multi-system, multi-level condition affecting 
metabolic, neurocognitive, cardiac, immune and brain function. This observation 
complicates the process of target identification and drug development.

One of the challenges in evaluating the literature on pharmacological strategies is that no 
single drug has emerged as efficacious for PTSD, though many provide symptom relief in 
certain patients. It may be that pharmacogenomic strategies may identify PTSD biological 
subtypes that preferentially respond to specific pharmacologic targets (111, 112). 
Alternatively biological mechanisms associated with recovery or resilience might be 
engaged by psychotherapy, and/or facilitated by pharmacological strategies that leverage the 
strengths of both modalities when used in an integrated manner. Evaluating biological 
changes before and after such approaches may help understand their mechanisms of action.

Conclusion

The search for druggable targets based on putative pathophysiology, or biological 
differences between PTSD and resilient persons, has not yet yielded broadly-applicable 
pharmacological strategies for this disorder. This review has focused on targets drawn from 
candidate-driven approaches to understanding biological alterations in PTSD, thus, there are 
still potential targets to be identified using genome-wide systems biology and computational

neuroscience approaches (5). Successful pharmacotherapeutic strategies may depend on 
identifying biological or clinical subgroups of PTSD, and/or symptom configurations 
characteristics of specific stages of illness or PTSD phenotypes (113, 114), factors that may 
not have been fully considered in existing RCTs. Alternatively, approaches to drug 
development that are borne from understanding the biological correlates of recovery 
following psychotherapy or pharmacological augmentation of psychotherapy may be needed 
to identify mechanism associated with successful processing and integration of traumatic 
material.

The lack of success of strategies based on a one-size-fits-all rational pharmacotherapy 
justifies a re-evaluation of this approach with the aim of identifying better methods of target 
detection and more viable compounds or treatments. It is appropriate to learn from 
promising strategies discovered serendipitously; this can be accomplished using biological 
psychiatry approaches in reverse translational models to understand the neurobiological 
mechanisms involved in recovery. Indeed, despite having a clear etiological agent – exposure 
to an event – PTSD has proven to be an exceedingly heterogeneous and complex condition, 
and one that is not easily addressed by a single strategy, though often facilitated by 
combining modalities, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. It is therefore worth 
considering biological mechanisms that might temporarily alter one’s mental state to permit 
more effective trauma processing. The opportunity to examine the meaning of traumatic life 
events under the influence of such medications while being guided by skilled 
psychotherapists may constitute a true personalized medicine strategy for PTSD.
