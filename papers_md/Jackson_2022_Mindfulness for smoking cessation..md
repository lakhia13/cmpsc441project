Background

A B S T R A C T

Mindfulness-based  smoking  cessation  interventions  may  aid  smoking  cessation  by  teaching  individuals  to  pay  attention  to,  and  work
mindfully with, negative affective states, cravings, and other symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Types of mindfulness-based interventions
include mindfulness training, which involves training in meditation; acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT); distress tolerance training;
and yoga.

Objectives

To  assess  the  efficacy  of  mindfulness-based  interventions  for  smoking  cessation  among  people  who  smoke,  and  whether  these
interventions have an effect on mental health outcomes.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and trial registries to
15 April 2021. We also employed an automated search strategy, developed as part of the Human Behaviour Change Project, using Microsoft
Academic.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs that compared a mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation
with another smoking cessation programme or no treatment, and assessed smoking cessation at six months or longer. We excluded studies
that solely recruited pregnant women.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking cessation at the longest time point, using the most rigorous definition
available, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking cessation for each
study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of intervention and type of comparator. We carried out meta-
analyses where appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models. We summarised mental health outcomes narratively.

Main results

We included 21 studies, with 8186 participants. Most recruited adults from the community, and the majority (15 studies) were conducted in
the USA. We judged four of the studies to be at low risk of bias, nine at unclear risk, and eight at high risk. Mindfulness-based interventions
varied considerably in design and content, as did comparators, therefore, we pooled small groups of relatively comparable studies.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of mindfulness training interventions on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking
cessation treatment (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence), less intensive smoking
cessation treatment (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.19; I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 813 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or no treatment (RR
0.81, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.53; 1 study, 325 participants; low-certainty evidence). In each comparison, the 95% CI encompassed benefit (i.e.
higher quit rates), harm (i.e. lower quit rates) and no difference. In one study of mindfulness-based relapse prevention, we did not detect
a clear benefit or harm of the intervention over no treatment (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.67; 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of ACT on quit rates compared with less intensive behavioural treatments, including nicotine
replacement therapy alone (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.02; 1 study, 102 participants; low-certainty evidence), brief advice (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.59
to 2.75; 1 study, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or less intensive ACT (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants;
low-certainty evidence). There was a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 82%) across studies comparing ACT with intensity-matched smoking
cessation treatments, meaning it was not appropriate to report a pooled result.

We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of distress tolerance training on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation
treatment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.98; 1 study, 69 participants; low-certainty evidence) or less intensive smoking cessation treatment (RR
1.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.08; 1 study, 49 participants; low-certainty evidence).

We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of yoga on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatment (RR 1.44,
95% CI 0.40 to 5.16; 1 study, 55 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Excluding studies at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the results, nor did using complete case data as opposed to using data from
all participants randomised.

Nine  studies  reported  on  changes  in  mental  health  and  well-being,  including  depression,  anxiety,  perceived  stress,  and  negative  and
positive affect. Variation in measures and methodological differences between studies meant we could not meta-analyse these data. One
study found a greater reduction in perceived stress in participants who received a face-to-face mindfulness training programme versus an
intensity-matched programme. However, the remaining eight studies found no clinically meaningful differences in mental health and well-
being between participants who received mindfulness-based treatments and participants who received another treatment or no treatment
(very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

We did not detect a clear benefit of mindfulness-based smoking cessation interventions for increasing smoking quit rates or changing
mental  health  and  well-being.  This  was  the  case  when  compared  with  intensity-matched  smoking  cessation  treatment,  less  intensive
smoking cessation treatment, or no treatment. However, the evidence was of low and very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency,
and imprecision, meaning future evidence may very likely change our interpretation of the results. Further RCTs of mindfulness-based
interventions for smoking cessation compared with active comparators are needed. There is also a need for more consistent reporting of
mental health and well-being outcomes in studies of mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.

Can mindfulness help people to stop smoking?

Key messages

- There is currently no clear evidence that mindfulness-based treatments help people to stop smoking or improve their mental health and
well-being.

- However, our confidence in the evidence is low or very low, and further evidence is likely to change our conclusions.

What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness involves focusing attention on your thoughts and feelings and observing them without judgment as they arise and pass away.
Mindfulness is believed to help people better control their thoughts and feelings, rather than be controlled by them. Stopping smoking
gives rise to distressing urges to smoke and low mood, so mindfulness-based treatments could improve people's ability to cope with these.

Types of mindfulness-based therapies include:

- mindfulness training (which involves training in mindfulness-based meditation);

-  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT);  which  doesn't  teach  meditation  but  encourages  people  to  embrace  their  thoughts  and
feelings rather than fighting them, while making committed behaviour change);

- distress tolerance training (which provides parts of the ACT therapy, as well as presenting people who smoke with situations that make
them want to smoke. This allows them to practise the skills that they have learnt through ACT);

- yoga (which increases awareness of breathing and encourages a connection between mind and body).

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out whether mindfulness-based stop-smoking programmes work better than other stop-smoking programmes or no
treatment to help people stop smoking.

We wanted to know:

- how many people stopped smoking for at least six months;

- whether there were changes in people's mental health and well-being.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that looked at the use of mindfulness to help people stop smoking.

We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods
and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 21 studies in 8186 young people and adults who smoked.

The studies tested a range of mindfulness-based treatments, including mindfulness training (8 studies), ACT (8 studies), yoga (3 studies),
and distress tolerance training (2 studies). Studies compared these treatments with:

- other stop-smoking treatments that were equally time-intensive (such as counselling);

- other stop-smoking treatments that were less intensive (such as brief advice);

- no treatment.

Most studies took place in the USA (15 studies). Others took place in Hong Kong (2 studies), Brazil (1 study), Ireland (1 study), and Cyprus
(1 study). One study did not report the country it took place in.

Main results

We did not find clear evidence that mindfulness helped people to stop smoking. When we grouped studies by the type of mindfulness-
based intervention people received, we found no evidence that people who received mindfulness training, ACT, distress tolerance training,
or yoga were more likely to stop than people who received any other stop-smoking treatments or no support.

Nine studies looked at whether mindfulness-based stop-smoking treatments resulted in positive changes in mental health and well-being,
such as reductions in stress or anxiety or improvements in mood. One of these studies found that people who received a mindfulness
training programme reported being less stressed than those who received an alternative stop-smoking treatment. However, the other 8
did not find evidence of a difference in mental health and well-being between groups.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

Our confidence in the evidence is low to very low as there were problems with the design of studies, findings of studies were very different
from one another, and not enough people took part, making it difficult to tell whether mindfulness helps people to stop smoking or was
linked to better mental health and well-being. We need more studies to draw firmer conclusions.

How up to date is this evidence?

We included evidence published to 15 April 2021.

Studies investigated a range of outcomes: anxiety, depression, negative
affect, positive affect, stress. Although 1 study found a statistically signifi-
cantly greater reduction in perceived stress in people who received mind-
fulness training compared with those who received a matched-intensity
smoking cessation treatment at 6-month follow-up, the other 2 studies
found no clinically meaningful between-group differences in change in
mental health and well-being measures.

*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and
its 95% CI).

CI: confidence interval; RCT: randomised controlled trial; RR: risk ratio

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

aNot downgraded for risk of bias: we judged one of the three studies to be at high risk of bias, but excluding this study did not change the conclusion.
bDowngraded by two levels due to imprecision: the overall number of events was very low (n = 87) and the confidence interval of the effect estimate incorporates clinically relevant
potential benefit and harm of the intervention.
cDowngraded by one level due to risk of bias: we judged two of the five studies to be at high risk of bias and removing these studies changed the direction of the effect estimate.
dDowngraded by one level due to inconsistency: substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I2 = 60%).
eDowngraded by two levels due to imprecision: the overall number of events was low (n = 101) and the confidence interval of the effect estimate incorporates clinically relevant
potential benefit and harm of the intervention.
fDowngraded by two levels due to imprecision: the overall number of events was very low (n = 36) and the confidence interval of the effect estimate incorporates clinically relevant
potential benefit and harm of the intervention.
gDowngraded by two levels due to risk of bias: we judged the sole study to be at high risk of bias.
hDowngraded by two levels due to imprecision: the overall number of events was very low (n = 15) and the confidence interval of the effect estimate incorporates clinically relevant
potential benefit and harm of the intervention.
iDowngraded by one level due to risk of bias: we judged two of the three studies to be at high risk of bias and one of these was the only study to report a meaningful difference
in mental health between conditions.
jDowngraded by two levels due to inconsistency: mental health and well-being are measured using a range of different constructs, the interventions include both a standard
cessation intervention and an intervention targeted at relapse prevention and the interpretation of results varies across studies.

ACT vs matched-intensity

6-month follow-up)

It was not appropriate to pool data across these studies because there was a high
level of heterogeneity (I2 = 82%) and the result may be misleading.

this outcome

summarised
narratively.

*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and
its 95% CI).

ACT: Acceptance and commitment therapy; CI: confidence interval; NRT: nicotine replacement therapy; RCT: randomised controlled trial; RR: risk ratio

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

aDowngraded by two levels due to inconsistency: substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 82%). A subgroup analysis grouping by mode of delivery used explained a small
amount of this, but substantial heterogeneity remained unexplained.
bNot downgraded for indirectness. One study included only smokers without health insurance, but contributed just 17.3% of the weighted effect.

Description of the condition

Smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death and disease
worldwide (WHO 2019). Stopping smoking can result in substantial
health gains, even later in life. The sooner a smoker quits, the more
they reduce their risk of developing smoking-related diseases (Doll
2004). The majority of smokers want to quit and many try to quit
each year, but quit rates remain low (WHO 2019).

Description of the intervention

In recent decades, mindfulness has increasingly been recognised
as  an  influence  on  mood  and  behaviour  (Baer  2003;  Keng  2011).
It  has  been  adopted  as  an  approach  for  increasing  awareness
and  responding  skilfully  to  mental  processes  that  contribute  to
emotional  distress  and  maladaptive  behaviour  (Baer  2003).  In
current research contexts, mindfulness is typically defined as the
psychological  process  of  bringing  non-judgmental  attention  to
experiences  occurring  in  the  present  moment  (Kabat-Zinn  2013).
There are various definitions of mindfulness used in psychological
literature.  While  no  consensus  has  been  reached  on  how  to
define mindfulness, a two-component model proposed by Bishop
2004  is  often  used  in  research.  This  operationalises  mindfulness
as:  (i)  maintaining  attention  on  the  immediate  experience,  and
(ii) maintaining an attitude of openness, curiosity, and acceptance
toward this experience, regardless of its valence or desirability.

Mindfulness approaches are not relaxation or mood management
techniques,  but  rather  a  form  of  cognitive  training  to  reduce
susceptibility to reactive states of mind that might otherwise induce
stress  or  perpetuate  psychopathology  (Baer  2003).  The  practice
of  mindfulness  involves  focusing  attention  on  the  immediate
experience  of  cognitions,  emotions,  perceptions,  and  physical
sensations  and  observing  them  as  they  arise  and  pass  away.
Mindfulness is nondeliberative: it simply involves paying sustained
attention  to  thoughts  and  feelings  without  thinking  about  or
evaluating  them.  A  key  tenet  of  mindfulness  is  that,  by  noticing
thoughts and feelings in a curious and accepting manner, people
develop  greater  tolerance  of  these  phenomena  and  are  able  to
recognise that they are transient, so they are less likely to respond
impulsively to them (Heppner 2015).

There are a range of different treatments based on the principles
of mindfulness. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-
Zinn 2013) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal
2002)  use  meditation  as  the  primary  method  of  teaching
mindfulness.  MBSR  was  developed  to  treat  chronic  stress  and
pain-related  disorders.  It  uses  three  techniques:  firstly,  sitting
meditation,  which  involves  mindful  attention  on  the  breath
and  a  state  of  noncritical  awareness  of  cognitions,  feelings,
and  sensations;  secondly,  Hatha  yoga  practice,  which  involves
breathing  exercises,  simple  stretches,  and  postures;  and  thirdly,
body scan, which involves a gradual sweeping of attention through
the entire body from feet to head, while employing nonjudgmental
awareness of feelings and sensation in each targeted body region
(Kabat-Zinn  2013).  MBCT  was  developed  to  prevent  relapse  in
depressive disorders. It integrates aspects of cognitive behavioral
therapy  (CBT)  for  depression  into  the  MBSR  programme  (Segal
2002).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Other treatments that incorporate mindfulness include acceptance
and  commitment  therapy  (ACT;  Hayes  2016),  distress  tolerance
training,  dialectical  behaviour  therapy  (DBT;  Linehan  2018),  and
certain  types  of  yoga  (Salmon  2009).  ACT  focuses  on  increasing
people's  willingness  to  experience  physical  cravings,  emotions,
and  thoughts,  and  allowing  these  to  come  and  go  while  making
committed  behaviour  changes  that  are  guided  by  their  own
values (Hayes 2016). Distress tolerance training combines elements
drawn  from  ACT  with  exposure-based  treatment,  allowing  ACT
skills  to  be  practised  within  treatment  sessions  in  response  to
internal  triggers  (Brown  2008).  DBT  also  has  a  strong  emphasis
on acceptance, incorporating strategies to help the patient accept
themselves, their current capabilities, and behavioural functioning
(Linehan  2018).  Yoga  is  a  key  component  of  MBSR  (Kabat-
Zinn  2013),  and  provides  an  opportunity  to  practise  mindfulness
through  movement.  Forms  of  yoga  that  incorporate  breathing
exercises and directed meditative focus work to still the mind and
focus attention (Bock 2012).

How the intervention might work

Mindfulness-based  interventions  may  aid  smoking  cessation  by
teaching individuals to pay attention to, and work mindfully with,
negative affective states, cravings, and other symptoms of nicotine
withdrawal as they arise, rather than habitually reacting to these
unpleasant  states  by  smoking.  Proposed  mechanisms  of  action
include attention regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation,
and change in self-perspective (Hölzel 2011).

Withdrawal  following  smoking  cessation  is  acutely  associated
with  heightened  levels  of  stress  and  negative  affect  (Shiffman
2004;  West  2017).  Once  withdrawal  symptoms  have  abated,
cessation  is  generally  associated  with  improved  mental  health
(Taylor  2014;  Taylor  2021),  but  early  stage  acute  stress,  negative
affect, and depression are predictive of relapse (Correa-Fernández
2012;  Glassman  1990;  Shiffman  2004;  Shiffman  2005).  Therefore,
interventions  that  work  to  reduce  these  adverse  emotional
consequences  of  stopping  smoking  may  enhance  quit  rates  and
ultimately prevent relapse. Mindfulness-based interventions have
shown  some  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  psychiatric  disorders
relating to or involving these negative affective states (Goyal 2014;
Marchand 2013).

Further,  by  teaching  smokers  to  focus  their  attention  on  what
is  happening  in  the  moment,  mindfulness-based  interventions
bring habitual behaviours into consciousness. This enables people
to  understand  the  associative  learning  process,  and  focus  on
affect and craving as central components of positive and negative
reinforcement loops (Brewer 2010). By emphasising the transience
of affective states and teaching smokers to ‘sit with’ negative affect
and craving, mindfulness interventions target and modify learned
responses  to  smoking  cues.  This  may  help  smokers  to  quit  and
may reduce cigarette consumption among those who do not stop
smoking completely.

Thus,  it  has  been  suggested  that  mindfulness-based  treatments
“may  have  the  relative  advantage  of  teaching  a  single  technique
that may lead to the dampening and eventual dismantling of the
complex interrelated associative processes of smoking rather than
just removing stimuli that might propagate them” (Brewer 2011).

Why it is important to do this review

If  found  to  be  effective,  mindfulness-based  interventions  could
add an innovative intervention option to the range of treatments
for smoking cessation. A systematic review, including literature to
2016, did not find evidence of a significant impact of mindfulness
meditation  interventions  on  abstinence  relative  to  comparator
groups  (Maglione  2017).  However,  the  evidence  identified  was
of  low  certainty  due  to  the  high  levels  of  heterogeneity  and
imprecision  detected  through  meta-analysis.  Therefore,  there  is
a  need  to  update  this  review  to  include  new  evidence,  in  an
effort  to  increase  the  certainty  of  the  resulting  conclusions.  In
addition, expanding the search to include other interventions that
incorporate mindfulness approaches but do not specifically include
an element of meditation (e.g. ACT) can add to our understanding
of the potential effectiveness of mindfulness for smoking cessation.

The  purpose  of  the  present  review  is  to  assess  the  effect
of  interventions  that  incorporate  mindfulness  approaches  for
smoking cessation, using the robust methodology of Cochrane and
the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group. This review also represents
part of a separate project to evaluate similarities and differences
between the standard methodological processes of the Cochrane
Tobacco Addiction Group and a novel, machine-learning approach
developed by the Human Behaviour Change Project (Michie 2013).

or yoga) in addition to those specifically focused on mindfulness
meditation (e.g. MBSR or MBCT) to capture the broadest evidence.

Eligible  studies  had  to  include  at  least  one  of  the  following
comparison (control) interventions:

• no smoking cessation treatment;
• another  smoking  cessation  intervention,  of  any  length  or

intensity (including usual care);

• another type of mindfulness intervention (e.g. mindfulness of a

lower intensity).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Smoking abstinence at longest follow-up

To be eligible for inclusion, studies must have measured abstinence
at  least  six  months  from  the  start  of  the  intervention.  Following
the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group's  standard  methods,  we
excluded  studies  that  only  measured  abstinence  at  less  than  six-
months' follow-up.

In studies with more than one measure of abstinence, we preferred
the  measure  with  the  strictest  criteria,  in  line  with  the  Russell
Standard (West 2005). We used prolonged or continuous abstinence
in  preference  to  point  prevalence  abstinence,  and  preferred
biochemically  validated  abstinence  (e.g.  using  exhaled  carbon
monoxide  or  cotinine  measures)  over  self-report.  We  favoured
biochemically  validated  point  prevalence  abstinence  over  self-
reported continuous or prolonged abstinence.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and  cluster-RCTs  that
measured  smoking  cessation  at  least  six  months  from  baseline
were eligible for this review. We included studies reported as full
text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data, where
available. There were no language or date restrictions.

Types of participants

We included current tobacco smokers of any age who were willing
to  enrol  in  a  smoking  cessation  study.  We  excluded  studies  that
only  recruited  pregnant  women,  as  their  particular  needs  and
circumstances  warrant  their  treatment  as  a  separate  population,
and these are covered in a separate Cochrane Review (Chamberlain
2017).

Types of interventions

We included interventions targeted at tobacco smoking cessation
that were either labelled as mindfulness, or involved a mindfulness-
based approach that could be isolated to investigate effectiveness.
There  were  no  restrictions  on  the  minimum  duration  of  the
intervention.  Where  a  potentially  relevant  study  intervention
was  not  specifically  described  as  being  mindfulness-based,  we
discussed  as  a  team  (of  EN,  JLB,  NL,  SJ)  whether  it  was  eligible
for  inclusion.  We  intentionally  adopted  an  inclusive  approach,
including  interventions  that  incorporated  mindfulness  (e.g.  ACT

This  could  provide  us  with  information  on  potential  benefits  or
harms of the mindfulness-based interventions. Even if comparisons
of mindfulness-based interventions with other smoking cessation
interventions  do  not  find  a  benefit  of  mindfulness  for  smoking
cessation,  improved  mental  well-being  could  be  a  reason  for
choosing  this  treatment  over  another.  We  assessed  validated
measures of the following relevant constructs:

• depression;
• anxiety;
• quality of life;
• positive affect;
• negative affect;
• stress.

We  extracted  data  on  these  mental  health  and  well-being
outcomes, measured at the longest follow-up at which abstinence
was reported, or as close to this as possible.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We  searched  the  following  databases  for  studies  that  referred  to
mindfulness techniques in the title or abstract, or as keywords:

• Embase Ovid (1974 to 15 April 2021)
• PsycINFO Ovid (1806 to 15 April 2021)

We searched all databases from inception through to 15 April 2021.
At  the  time  of  the  search,  the  Register  included  the  results  of
searches of MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20210407; Embase (via

See  the  Tobacco  Addiction  Group  website  for  details  of  the
search strategies for these databases. Search strategies are shown
in Appendix 1.

By  searching  CENTRAL  and  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction
Group’s  register,  we  were  able  to  identify  any  ongoing  studies
registered in the World Health Organization's portal (www.who.int/
trialsearch) or ClinicalTrials.gov in the USA, and studies reported in
Annual Meeting abstracts for the Society for Research on Nicotine
and  Tobacco  (SRNT).  We  listed  in  the  Characteristics  of  ongoing
studies table any studies that may be candidates for inclusion (i.e.
RCTs of smoking cessation interventions using mindfulness-based
approaches with a minimum follow-up of six months), but for which
results are not yet available.

Searching other resources

We checked reference lists of eligible published papers to identify
any other relevant papers that may not have been identified by our
search, and consulted experts in the field to identify any relevant
forthcoming or unpublished research. We contacted the authors of
ongoing studies where necessary.

Alongside  these  manual  search  strategies,  we  employed  an
automated  search  strategy  developed  as  part  of  the  Human
Behaviour Change Project (Michie 2017), using Microsoft Academic.
The  Human  Behaviour  Change  Project  aims  to  improve  upon
the  human  ability  to  synthesise,  interpret  and  deliver  evidence
on  behaviour  change  interventions,  using  Natural  Language
Processing  and  Machine  Learning  technologies  to  automate  the
extraction, synthesis, and interpretation of findings from behaviour
change intervention evaluation reports. We added any additional
studies  identified  through  this  method  to  those  found  via  the
manual  search,  so  that  we  included  all  relevant  evidence.  An
evaluation  comparing  these  manual  and  automated  methods  of
study identification will be reported in a separate paper.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two review authors (of EN, JLB, NL, SJ), independently checked the
titles and abstracts of retrieved studies for relevance, and acquired
full  study  reports  of  those  that  may  be  candidates  for  inclusion.
The review authors resolved any disagreements by mutual consent,
or  by  recourse  to  a  third  review  author.  Two  review  authors  (of
EN,  JLB,  NL,  SJ)  then  independently  assessed  the  full  texts  for
eligibility,  resolving  any  disagreements  through  discussion  and
with  involvement  of  a  third  review  author  when  necessary.  We
classified  as  'exclude'  any  studies  for  which  we  obtained  full
reports, but that did not meet the inclusion criteria.

Data extraction and management

Two  review  authors  (of  EH,  EN,  JLB,  NL,  SJ)  independently
extracted study data and compared their findings. We resolved any

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

disagreements through discussion, involving a third review author
where  necessary.  Where  available,  we  recorded  the  following
information in the Characteristics of included studies table.

• Methods:  study  design,  study  name  (if  applicable),  study
dates,  country,  number  of  study  centres,  study  setting,  study
recruitment procedure
• Participants:  number 

(intervention/control),  definition  of
smoker  used,  specific  demographic  characteristics  (e.g.  mean
age, age range, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES)),
mean  cigarettes  per  day,  mean  Fagerstrom  Test  for  Nicotine
Dependence (FTND), relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria

• Interventions:  description  of

behavioural  support  and  any  pharmacological  treatment
provided),  description  of  control  (details  of  behavioural
support  and  any  pharmacological  treatment  provided),  what

• Outcomes: 

relevant  primary  and  secondary  outcomes
measured,  time  points  reported,  biochemical  validation,
definitions  of  abstinence,  mental  health  measures  used,
proportion of participants with follow-up data

• Details of any within-study analyses of moderators of interest:
population  type;  baseline  motivation  to  quit;  baseline  mental
health

• Notes: funding for study, and conflicts of interest statements of

study authors (extracted verbatim)

Alongside this data extraction of entities that are typically captured
in smoking cessation Cochrane Reviews, we also performed data
extraction  using  entities  of  the  Behaviour  Change  Intervention
Ontology,  which  is  being  developed  as  part  of  the  Human
Behaviour  Change  Project  (Michie  2017).  The  ontology  consists
of  granular  entities  to  specify  all  aspects  of  behaviour  change
interventions, such as:

• an  intervention’s  context  (including  'setting'  (Norris  2020)  and

'population');

• content  (including  'behaviour  change  techniques';  (Michie

2013)); and

• delivery  (including  'mode  of  delivery':  how  an  intervention  is
provided to participants (Marques 2021); 'source': who delivers
interventions  (Norris  2021);  and  'schedule':  how  often  an
intervention is delivered (Michie 2017)).

An evaluation to compare these methods of data extraction will be
reported in a separate paper.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two  review  authors  (of  JLB,  NL,  SJ)  independently  assessed  the
risk  of  bias  for  each  included  study.  We  used  RoB  1,  following
the guidance as set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

We assessed the following domains (Higgins 2011):

• sequence generation;
• allocation concealment,
• blinding of outcome assessment;
• incomplete outcome data;
• selective reporting; and

• other sources of bias.

As we were investigating a primarily behavioural intervention, we
did  not  assess  the  blinding  of  participants  and  providers,  as  it  is
impossible  to  blind  people  to  behavioural  interventions.  This  is
in accordance with specific guidance from the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group.

Each review author recorded information in study reports relevant
to  each  domain  and  then  assessed  each  domain  as  either  at
low,  high,  or  unclear  risk  of  bias.  We  resolved  disagreements  by
discussion with a third review author. We considered studies to be
at high overall risk of bias where we judged at least one domain to
be at high risk; at low overall risk of bias where all domains were
judged to be at low risk; and at unclear overall risk of bias in all other
cases.

Measures of treatment effect

We  compared  quit  rates  between  intervention  and  comparator
groups  for  each  study.  We  calculated  quit  rates  on  an  intention-
to-treat  basis,  including  all  participants  originally  randomised  to
a  study  arm,  treating  participants  lost  to  follow-up  as  relapsed.
We  calculated  a  risk  ratio  (RR)  and  95%  confidence  interval
(CI)  for  each  study.  We  calculated  the  RR  for  each  study  as:
(number  of  participants  who  reported  smoking  abstinence  in
the  intervention  group/number  of  participants  randomised  to
the  intervention  group)/(number  of  participants  who  reported
smoking abstinence in the control (comparator) group/number of
participants randomised to the control (comparator) group).

Due  to  high  levels  of  variance  between  studies  in  interventions
and  comparators,  and  in  the  measurement  of  mental  health  and
well-being outcomes, we narratively reported relevant measures of
mental health and well-being.

Unit of analysis issues

The one included cluster-RCT did not present an analysis adjusting
for  the  clustering  effect  or  report  an  intracluster  correlation
coefficient  (ICC).  Therefore,  we  used  unadjusted  data  for  the
primary  analysis  and  performed  a  sensitivity  analysis  where  we
estimated  the  ICC  (0.03),  based  on  the  ICC  reported  in  other
smoking  cessation  studies  (Fanshawe  2017),  and  adjusted  the
analysis on this basis.

In the case of studies with multiple intervention arms, we analysed
individual arms separately.

Dealing with missing data

For smoking abstinence, we assumed participants lost to follow-up
to be smoking, as is standard in the field (West 2005). However, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis, excluding numbers lost to follow-
up from the denominator.

Assessment of heterogeneity

In order to assess whether it was appropriate to pool studies and
conduct meta-analyses, we assessed the characteristics of included
studies to identify any clinical or methodological variance between
studies. If we deemed the studies to be homogeneous enough to
be combined meaningfully and we could conduct meta-analyses,
we assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (Higgins
2003). We considered an I2 statistic over 50% to indicate moderate

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

to substantial heterogeneity (Deeks 2021). Where the I2 statistic was
80% or more, the direction of individual study effects differed, and
heterogeneity was not fully explained by subgroup and sensitivity
analyses, we do not report a pooled estimate because it could be
misleading.  We  conducted  the  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses
described  below  to  investigate  any  potential  causes  of  observed
heterogeneity.

Assessment of reporting biases

It was not appropriate to assess reporting bias using funnel plots as
none of our analyses pooled 10 or more studies.

Data synthesis

We  provided  a  narrative  summary  of  the  included  studies  and,
where appropriate, conducted meta-analyses.

The  primary  outcome  of  abstinence  provides  dichotomous  data,
therefore, as per the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's standard
methods, we combined RRs from individual studies using random-
effects, Mantel-Haenszel methods, to calculate pooled overall RRs
with 95% CIs.

Meaures  of  our  mental  health  and  well-being  outcome  typically
provided continuous data. Data were too heterogeneous to carry
out  meta-analyses,  so  we  tabulated  the  existing  information  and
summarised narratively.

We  also  narratively  reported  the  results  of  any  within-study
analyses  that  have  investigated  the  following  moderators  of
effectiveness at at least six months' follow-up:

• population type;
• baseline motivation to quit;
• baseline mental health.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We carried out subgroup analyses, categorising studies by the type/
intensity of control treatment received and mode of intervention
delivery.  We  compared  pooled  summary  statistics  across  groups
and ran statistical tests for subgroup differences.

Sensitivity analysis

For  smoking  abstinence,  we  tested  the  impact  of  excluding
studies  deemed  to  be  at  overall  high  risk  of  bias  and  compared
abstinence  rates  calculated  assuming  'missing  equals  smoking'
with abstinence rates calculated through complete-case analysis.
We also carried out the sensitivity analysis reported above, using
an assumed ICC to adjust for potential clustering effects in a cluster-
RCT.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

Following  standard  Cochrane  methodology  (Schünemann  2021),
we  created  summary  of  findings  tables  for  smoking  abstinence,
and  mental  health  and  well-being  outcomes,  detailing  different
intervention  types 
in  separate  tables  (mindfulness  training;
ACT;  distress  tolerance  training;  yoga).  Also  following  standard
Cochrane  methodology  (Schünemann  2021),  we  used  the  five
GRADE  considerations  (risk  of  bias,  inconsistency,  imprecision,
indirectness,  and  publication  bias)  to  assess  the  certainty  of  the
body of evidence for each outcome, within each comparison, and

Included studies

 In total, we included 21 completed studies (Bloom 2020; Bock 2012;
Bock 2019; Bricker 2014a; Bricker 2018; Bricker 2020; Brown 2013;
Davis 2014a; Davis 2014b; de Souza 2020; Garrison 2020; Gaskins
2015; Gifford 2003; Mak 2020; McClure 2020; O'Connor 2020; Pbert
2020;  Savvides  2014;  Singh  2014;  Vidrine  2016;  Weng  2021).  Key
features of the included studies are summarised below.

Context and participants

Studies  were  conducted  in  the  USA  (15  studies),  Hong  Kong  (2
studies),  Brazil  (1  study),  Ireland  (1  study),  and  Cyprus  (1  study).
One  study  (Singh  2014)  did  not  report  its  location.  Participants
were recruited from the community (12 studies), online (3 studies),
from healthcare centres (2 studies), high schools and universities
(2 studies), tobacco treatment services (1 study), and workplaces
(1  study).  One  study  was  a  cluster-RCT  (Pbert  2020),  which
randomised high schools to different conditions. All other studies
were randomised at the individual level.

The  total  number  of  participants  across  studies  was  8186.  The
median  sample  size  was  146  but  ranged  from  38  to  2637
participants. Two studies deliberately targeted young adults (Pbert
2020; Savvides 2014), two studies low SES smokers (Davis 2014a;
Davis  2014b),  one  study  uninsured  smokers  (Bricker  2014a),  one
study smokers with a history of early lapse (never able to remain
abstinent  for  more  than  72  hours;  Brown  2013),  and  one  study
adults  with  mild  intellectual  disability  (Singh  2014).  Most  studies
had similar proportions of men and women or slightly more women
than men. The exceptions were Bloom 2020, Bock 2012 and Weng
2021,  which  targeted  only  women;  Gaskins  2015,  which  targeted
only  men;  Singh  2014,  which  recruited  82%  men  with  mild
intellectual  disability;  and  Mak  2020,  which  was  conducted  in
Hong Kong where smoking prevalence among women is low and
recruited 71% men.

Studies  typically  recruited  people  who  smoked  at  least  five
cigarettes a day. Although some studies included lighter smokers
as  well,  the  average  number  smoked  was  over  15  a  day  in  most
studies,  ranging  from  five  a  day  in  Pbert  2020's  sample  of  high
school students to 22 a day in Brown 2013's community sample.

Intervention programmes

Mindfulness training

Eight  studies  used  mindfulness  training  (which,  for  the  purpose
of  this  review,  we  define  as  specific  training  in  mindfulness  and
mindfulness-based meditation techniques).

Five  studies  tested  the  effectiveness  of  mindfulness  training
delivered  face-to-face.  Davis  2014b  compared  seven  weeks  of

group  mindfulness  training  and  meditation  practice  with  an
alternative,  intensity-matched,  behavioural  support  programme.
Similarly,  Vidrine  2016  compared  mindfulness-based  addiction
treatment  (8  x  2-hour  sessions)  with  an  intensity-matched  CBT
programme.  In  the  latter  study,  there  was  also  a  second,  less
intensive  comparator  arm,  in  which  participants  received  briefer
support  intended  to  represent  the  intervention  a  smoker  might
typically  receive  if  they  asked  a  healthcare  provider  for  help
(4  x  5-  to  10-minute  sessions).  All  participants  received  self-
help  materials.  The  other  three  studies  compared  mindfulness
training  with  less  intensive  comparators.  Davis  2014a  compared
an  eight-week  mindfulness  and  meditation  training  programme
with  quitline  support.  Singh  2014  compared  mindfulness  and
meditation  training  for  adults  with  mild  intellectual  disability
with  treatment  as  usual,  which  varied  between  participants  and
encompassed a range of treatments such as behaviour therapies,
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and other medications. Weng
2021  provided  women  in  workplaces  with  self-help  materials
and  compared  the  effectiveness  of  additional  mindfulness  and
meditation training (2 x 2-hour sessions), with brief advice to follow
the advice of the self-help materials. Provision of pharmacotherapy
varied  between  studies:  three  studies  (Davis  2014a;  Davis  2014b;
Vidrine 2016), provided participants in both arms with a course of
nicotine patches, one study provided no pharmacotherapy (Weng
2021),  and  one  study  (Singh  2014),  did  not  specifically  provide
pharmacotherapy to participants in either arm, although for some
comparator arm participants it was part of their usual treatment.

Two  studies  tested  the  effectiveness  of  mindfulness  training
delivered  via  smartphone  apps.  Garrison  2020  was  conducted
online.  It  compared  a  mobile  mindfulness  training  app  plus
experience sampling (which asked participants to check in 6 times
a day for 22 days) with experience sampling only. Pbert 2020 was
a cluster-RCT conducted in high schools. It tested the effectiveness
of  a  mindfulness  smartphone  app  designed  for  teens  against
two comparators: firstly, an alternative (non-mindfulness) smoking
cessation app designed for teens and secondly, self-help materials.
Participants in each of the three arms met with the school nurse
weekly for four weeks. No pharmacotherapy was provided in either
study.

de  Souza  2020  was  the  only  study  to  focus  on  mindfulness  for
relapse prevention. All participants received CBT over two phases:
a  smoking  cessation  phase  (weekly  sessions  over  4  weeks)  and
a  maintenance  phase  (6  sessions  between  weeks  6  and  48).  The
intervention  arm  also  received  eight  mindfulness-based  relapse
prevention  sessions  during  the  maintenance  phase.  Participants
were offered the choice of NRT or bupropion.

Behaviour-change  techniques  (BCTs)  varied  across  studies.  The
most  commonly  used  techniques  included  body  changes  (7
studies), problem solving (4 studies), self-monitoring of behaviour
(4 studies), pharmacological support (4 studies), and goal setting
(3 studies), with no clear patterning in the number or type of BCTs
used across mode of delivery.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)

Eight studies used ACT.

Three studies tested the effectiveness of ACT delivered exclusively
face-to-face.  McClure  2020  compared  a  five-week,  group  ACT
programme  with  a  five-week,  group  CBT  programme.  The  two
arms  were  matched  for  the  number  and  duration  of  sessions.
Participants  in  both  arms  were  provided  with  eight  weeks  of
nicotine patches. Gifford 2003 compared a seven-week programme
of individual and group ACT sessions (with no pharmacotherapy)
with  a  lower-intensity  comparator  group  that  received  a  seven-
week  course  of  nicotine  patches.  O'Connor  2020  compared  six
weeks of face-to-face, group ACT sessions with six weeks of face-
to-face,  group  behavioural  support,  matched  in  intensity  to  the
six-week, face-to-face ACT programme. No pharmacotherapy was
provided.

One  study  tested  the  effectiveness  of  ACT  delivered  through
a  combination  of  face-to-face  sessions  and  a  smartphone  app.
In  addition  to  the  face-to-face-only  intervention  arm,  O'Connor
2020  included  a  second  intervention  arm  in  which  ACT  was
delivered  via  two  modalities:  the  six-week,  face-to-face  ACT
programme  and  an  ACT-based  smartphone  app.  This  combined
ACT intervention was compared with a less intensive ACT arm (i.e.
6 weeks of face-to-face ACT without the app).

One study tested the effectiveness of ACT delivered exclusively via
smartphone app. Bricker 2020 compared an ACT smartphone app
with a smoking cessation app based on national clinical practice
guidelines. No pharmacotherapy was provided.

One  study  tested  the  effectiveness  of  ACT  delivered  through  a
combination  of  face-to-face  sessions  and  telephone  calls.  Mak
2020 compared ACT delivered in one face-to-face session and two
follow-up telephone calls with brief advice (5 minutes). Participants
in  both  arms  were  also  provided  with  self-help  materials.  No
pharmacotherapy was provided.

One study tested the effectiveness of ACT delivered exclusively via
telephone. Bricker 2014a compared an ACT programme delivered
over  five  telephone  calls  with  standard  quitline  CBT.  The  arms
were  matched  for  the  number  and  duration  of  telephone  calls.
Participants were provided with two weeks of nicotine patches or
gum.

Two  studies  tested  the  effectiveness  of  ACT  delivered  via
websites. Bricker 2018 compared an online ACT programme with
a  national  standard  online  quit  programme,  with  both  arms
receiving  daily  messages  prompting  them  to  log  in.  Savvides
2014  compared  an  avatar-led,  internet-based  ACT  programme
with  a  waitlist  control.  Neither  study  provided  participants  with
pharmacotherapy.

BCTs varied across studies. The most commonly used techniques
included problem solving (6 studies), body changes (5 studies), goal
setting  (4  studies),  and  action  planning  (4  studies),  with  no  clear

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

patterning  in  the  number  or  type  of  BCTs  used  across  mode  of
delivery.

Distress tolerance training

Two  studies  used  distress  tolerance  training.  Distress  tolerance
training 
interventions  combined  elements  drawn  from  ACT
with  exposure-based  treatment.  Exposure  included  periods  of
scheduled abstinence prior to sessions and exposure to cues within
sessions, allowing ACT skills to be practised within the sessions in
response to internal triggers.

Bloom  2020  targeted  women  who  were  concerned  about  post-
cessation  weight  gain.  The  intervention  was  nine  weeks  of  CBT
plus  distress  tolerance  training  -  a  face-to-face  and  telephone
programme  that  targeted  the  fear  of  anticipated  post-cessation
weight  gain  and  facilitated  initiation  of  abstinence,  and  appetite
awareness  and  mindful  eating  skills  to  reduce  post-cessation
emotional  eating.  The  comparator  was  nine  weeks  of  CBT  plus
smoking health education, which mentioned diet and exercise as
strategies for health promotion but did not specifically recommend
changing  diet  or  increasing  physical  activity  to  prevent  post-
cessation weight gain.

Brown  2013  targeted  smokers  who  had  previously  tried  to  quit
but  had  never  been  able  to  remain  abstinent  for  more  than  72
hours.  The  intervention  was  eight  weeks  of  face-to-face  distress
tolerance treatment and the comparator was six weeks of standard
treatment.

Both studies also provided NRT (8 weeks of nicotine patches) to all
participants in the intervention and comparator arms.

BCTs  varied  across  studies:  while  both  used  pharmacological
support,  Brown  2013  used  reduce  prompts/cues  and  Bloom
2020  used  problem  solving,  self-monitoring  of  behaviour,  social
support, information about health consequences, and anticipated
regret.

Yoga

Three studies used yoga involving a mindfulness-based approach.

Two  studies  used  Vinyasa  yoga  (Bock  2012;  Gaskins  2015),  and
one  used  Iyengar  yoga  (Bock  2019).  In  each  study,  participants
in  the  intervention  arm  were  provided  with  eight  CBT  classes
and  16  yoga  classes  over  eight  weeks.  Participants  in  the
comparator  arm  received  CBT  and  wellness  classes  over  eight
weeks. In Bock 2012 and Bock 2019, the comparator was matched
to  the  intervention  in  terms  of  the  number  and  duration  of
wellness  classes  (16  x  1-hour  classes).  However,  in  Gaskins
2015 the comparator was less intensive than the intervention: the
intervention  arm  received  16  yoga  classes  over  the  eight  weeks,
each lasting 60 to 90 minutes, while the comparator arm received
eight brief wellness discussions following the CBT sessions.

None of the studies provided participants with pharmacotherapy,
but  two  studies  (Bock  2012;  Bock  2019),  noted  that  participants
were  permitted  to  use  NRT  or  other  medications  alongside  the
programme if they wanted to.

BCTs were similar across studies: all three studies used goal setting,
problem  solving,  and  social  support.  Bock  2012  and  Gaskins
2015  also  used  self-monitoring  of  behaviour  and  body  changes,
and Gaskins 2015 also used reduce negative emotions.

Outcomes

Smoking abstinence

The  included  studies  provided  a  range  of  smoking  abstinence
outcome  measures.  Two  studies  reported  the  strictest  outcome
as biochemically verified continuous abstinence (Bock 2019; Davis
2014a),  12  studies  defined  abstinence  as  biochemically  verified,
seven-day point prevalence (Bloom 2020; Bock 2012; Brown 2013;
Davis 2014b; Garrison 2020; Gaskins 2015; Gifford 2003; Mak 2020;
O'Connor  2020;  Pbert  2020;  Vidrine  2016;  Weng  2021),  one  study
as biochemically verified, 30-day point prevalence (McClure 2020),
and one study as carbon monoxide less than 10 parts per million
(de Souza 2020).

Most studies had a maximum follow-up duration of six months, but
six studies collected their final follow-up data at 12 months (Bricker
2018;  Bricker  2020;  Gifford  2003;  Mak  2020;  McClure  2020;  Singh
2014). Savvides 2014 reported collecting data on seven-day and 30-
day point prevalence abstinence at six and 12 months but at the
time this report was published data collection was ongoing and the
only smoking abstinence outcomes reported are from immediately
post-treatment; we have not been able to find long-term outcome
data reported elsewhere.

Mental health

Ten  of  the  included  studies  reported  collecting  data  on  mental
health and well-being (Bloom 2020; Bock 2012; Brown 2013; Davis

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2014a;  Davis  2014b;  de  Souza  2020;  Gaskins  2015;  Gifford  2003;
O'Connor 2020; Vidrine 2016), of which nine analysed and reported
on changes in these outcomes. Mental health outcomes included
depression,  anxiety,  perceived  stress,  and  negative  and  positive
affect.  The  constructs  assessed,  measures  used,  and  follow-up
durations varied across studies.

Excluded studies

Figure 1 shows the most common reasons for exclusion of studies
during full-text screening, which included: a follow-up period of less
than six months; ineligible study design (not an RCT); conference
proceedings with no relevant studies; and an intervention where it
was not possible to isolate the effects of the mindfulness element.

In  the  Characteristics  of  excluded  studies  table,  we  list  exclusion
reasons  for  47  studies.  This  list  is  not  comprehensive,  only
containing  studies  that  a  reader  might  plausibly  expect  to  be
included.

Risk of bias in included studies

Overall, we judged four of the 21 completed studies to be at low risk
of bias, nine studies to be at unclear risk, and the remaining eight
studies at high risk of bias.

Details  of  risk  of  bias  judgments  for  each  domain  of  each
included  study  can  be  found  in  the  Characteristics  of  included
studies  table.  Figure  2  illustrates  judgments  for  each  included
study.

Allocation

Random sequence generation

We judged one study (Singh 2014), to be at high risk of selection bias
for sequence generation, because randomisation was via alternate
placement in the experimental and control groups. We judged eight
studies at low risk of bias (Bock 2019; Bricker 2014a; Bricker 2018;
Bricker  2020;  Gifford  2003;  Mak  2020;  O'Connor  2020;  Savvides
2014). The risk of bias for the remaining studies was unclear.

Allocation concealment

We  judged  six  studies  (Bricker  2014a;  Bricker  2018;  Bricker  2020;
Mak 2020; O'Connor 2020; Weng 2021), to be at low risk of selection
bias for allocation concealment, and the remainder to be at unclear
risk as there was insufficient information with which to judge.

Blinding

Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)

As we were investigating a primarily behavioural intervention, we
did  not  assess  the  blinding  of  participants  and  providers,  as  it  is
impossible  to  blind  people  to  behavioural  interventions.  This  is
in accordance with specific guidance from the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group.

Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)

We rated three studies (Mak 2020; Savvides 2014; Singh 2014), at
high  risk  for  detection  bias.  These  studies  did  not  use  blinding,
they provided different levels of support, and outcomes were self-
reported. This meant we thought there was a high risk of bias being
introduced. We judged the remaining studies to be at low risk for
detection bias.

Incomplete outcome data

We judged most studies (13 out of 21) to be at low risk of attrition
bias. We rated four studies with substantial (> 50%) loss to follow-
up  and  one  study  with  more  than  a  20%  difference  in  follow-up
rates between arms at high risk of attrition bias (Davis 2014a; Davis
2014b;  de  Souza  2020;  Gaskins  2015;  Mak  2020).  The  remaining
three  studies  (Bock  2012;  Savvides  2014;  Singh  2014),  did  not
provide  sufficient  data  on  which  to  judge,  and  hence  we  judged
them to be at unclear risk.

Selective reporting

Of the 21 studies, we considered 13 to be at low risk of reporting
bias, as they reported all prespecified or expected outcomes. We
rated two studies (Bock 2012; de Souza 2020), at high risk, as they
did  not  present  data  as  specified  in  the  original  protocols.  We
judged the rest (Bloom 2020; Brown 2013; Gifford 2003; Mak 2020;
Savvides 2014; Singh 2014), to be at unclear risk, as we were unable
to identify a protocol.

Other potential sources of bias

We  judged  one  study  (Savvides  2014),  to  be  at  high  risk  of  other
bias because it used a waitlist control. This design risks participants
in the control arm delaying quitting, knowing that they would be
receiving an intervention at a later date. This has the potential to
inflate the reported effect of the intervention. We did not find any
other studies to be at risk of other bias.

Mindfulness training 

Smoking abstinence

Three  studies  compared  an  intervention  involving  mindfulness
training with an alternative smoking cessation treatment that was
matched  for  intensity  (Davis  2014b;  Pbert  2020;  Vidrine  2016).
Pooled  data  showed  no  evidence  of  a  benefit  of  mindfulness
training,  with  a  point  estimate  very  close  to  the  null  (RR  0.99,
95%  CI  0.67  to  1.46;  I2  =  0%;  542  participants;  low-certainty
evidence;  Analysis  1.1).  We  judged  Davis  2014b  at  high  risk  of
bias,  while  the  other  two  studies  were  at  unclear  risk.  Removing
the  study  at  high  risk  of  bias  did  not  substantially  change  the
interpretation of the results (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.33; I2 = 0%;
2 studies, 407 participants; Analysis 5.1), nor did using complete-
case  analysis  (RR  1.05,  95%  CI  0.69  to  1.59;  I2  =  25%;  3  studies,
356 participants; Analysis 6.1). In each of these sensitivity analyses,
there  was  only  a  minimal  impact  on  the  point  estimate,  with
CIs  still  spanning  both  benefit  (i.e.  higher  quit  rates)  and  harm
(i.e.  lower  quit  rates).  A  subgroup  analysis  separating  studies  by
mode of delivery showed no evidence of moderating the effect of
mindfulness training interventions in comparison with alternative,
matched-intensity  smoking  cessation  treatment  (I2  =  0%).  Pbert
2020  was  a  cluster-RCT,  so  we  conducted  another  sensitivity
analysis adjusting for any potential clustering effect (assuming an
ICC  of  0.03);  this  did  not  substantially  change  the  overall  pooled
result (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.50; I2 = 0%; Analysis 7.1).

Five  studies  compared  an  intervention  involving  mindfulness
training with a less intensive smoking cessation treatment (Davis
2014a; Pbert 2020; Singh 2014; Vidrine 2016; Weng 2021). Pooled
data showed no evidence of a benefit of mindfulness training, with
the  CI  spanning  both  benefit  and  harm  of  mindfulness  training
interventions in comparison with less intensive smoking cessation
treatments (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.19; I2 = 60%; 813 participants;
very  low-certainty  evidence;  Analysis  1.2).  We  judged  Davis
2014a  and  Singh  2014  at  high  risk  of  bias,  while  the  other  three
studies were at unclear risk. Removing the studies at high risk of
bias changed the direction of the effect estimate (from favouring
mindfulness training to favouring the comparator) but the CI still
spanned both benefit and harm so this did not substantially change
the interpretation of the results (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.33; I2 =
5%; 3 studies, 566 participants; Analysis 5.2). Using complete-case
analysis produced similar results to the main analysis (RR 1.08, 95%
CI 0.53 to 2.16; I2 = 62%; 4 studies, 479 participants; Analysis 6.2).
Subgroup analyses showed some evidence of moderation by type
of comparator (I2 = 68%). While there was no evidence of a benefit
of mindfulness training versus less intensive behavioural support
(RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.30; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 453 participants),
brief advice (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.23; 1 study, 213 participants),
or  self-help  materials  (RR  0.75,  95%  CI  0.28  to  2.00;  1  study,
96  participants),  there  was  evidence  of  a  benefit  of  mindfulness
training versus mixed treatment (treatment as usual, which varied
between participants and encompassed a range of treatments such

as behaviour therapies, NRT, and other medications; RR 2.77, 95%
CI 1.30 to 5.94; 1 study, 51 participants). However, we judged the
latter study at high risk of bias and it had substantial imprecision.
Adjusting for clustering in Pbert 2020 (assuming an ICC of 0.03) did
not  substantially  change  the  overall  pooled  result  (RR  1.22,  95%
CI  0.66  to  2.26;  I2  =  58%;  Analysis  7.2)  or  the  subgroup  result  for
mindfulness  training  versus  self-help  materials  (RR  0.80,  95%  CI
0.24 to 2.67).

One  study  compared  an  intervention  involving  mindfulness
training with no treatment. Garrison 2020 showed no evidence of a
benefit of mindfulness training, with the point estimate favouring
no  treatment  over  mindfulness  training  and  the  CI  spanning
both benefit and harm of mindfulness training compared with no
treatment  (RR  0.81,  95%  CI  0.43  to  1.53;  325  participants;  low-
certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3). We judged this study at unclear
risk  of  bias.  Using  complete-case  analysis  did  not  substantially
change the interpretation of the results (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.43;
247 participants; Analysis 6.3).

One study compared an intervention involving mindfulness-based
relapse  prevention  with  no  treatment.  de  Souza  2020's  point
estimate favoured mindfulness-based relapse prevention over no
treatment  but  there  was  substantial  imprecision,  meaning  the
result could indicate potential harm as well as considerable benefit
(RR  1.43,  95%  CI  0.56  to  3.67;  86  participants;  very  low-certainty
evidence;  Analysis  1.4).  We  judged  this  study  at  high  risk  of  bias.
Using  complete-case  analysis  did  not  substantially  change  the
interpretation  of  the  results  (RR  1.23,  95%  CI  0.72  to  2.10;  20
participants; Analysis 6.4).

Mental health

Three  studies  that  tested  an  intervention  involving  mindfulness
training  reported  on  mental  health  outcomes  (Analysis  1.5;  very
low-certainty  evidence).  One  study  showed  evidence  of  a  benefit
of  mindfulness  training  on  mental  health.  Davis  2014b  (135
participants)  analysed  perceived  stress  at  six  months  post-
quit.  They  observed  a  statistically  significantly  greater  reduction
in  perceived  stress  between  baseline  and  six  months  in  the
intervention  arm  than  the  intensity-matched  control  arm,  but
this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  when  analysed  as
intention-to-treat.

Two studies showed no clear evidence of a benefit of mindfulness
training on mental health. de Souza 2020 (86 participants) analysed
depression, anxiety, negative affect, and positive affect at 4 and 12
weeks. No statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference
between  conditions  was  observed  for  any  outcome  at  either
time  point.  Vidrine  2016  (412  participants)  assessed  depression,
perceived  stress,  negative  affect,  and  positive  affect  at  six  time
points between quit date and six months post-quit. They analysed
changes  between  quit  date  and  six  months  and  observed  no
statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference between
conditions for any outcome.

In  addition,  Davis  2014a  (196  participants)  assessed  negative
affect at one month post-baseline, but only reported data for the
intervention arm.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)

Smoking abstinence

Five  studies  compared  an  intervention  involving  ACT  with  an
alternative  smoking  cessation  treatment  that  was  matched  for
intensity (Bricker 2014a; Bricker 2018; Bricker 2020; McClure 2020;
O'Connor  2020).  We  judged  McClure  2020  to  be  at  unclear  risk
of  bias,  while  the  other  four  studies  were  at  low  risk.  It  was  not
appropriate  to  pool  data  across  these  five  studies  because  there
was  a  high  level  of  heterogeneity  (I2  =  82%;  Analysis  2.1),  with
variation in the direction of effect between studies, and the result
may be misleading. Subgroup analyses showed some evidence of
moderation  by  mode  of  delivery  (I2  =  82%),  although  this  didn't
account  for  all  variation  within  subgroups.  While  there  was  no
evidence of a benefit of ACT delivered face-to-face (RR 0.76, 95% CI
0.32 to 1.78; I2 = 68%; 2 studies, 550 participants), by telephone (RR
1.35, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.46; 1 study, 121 participants), or via a website
(RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; 1 study, 2637 participants), there was
evidence of a benefit of ACT delivered via smartphone app (RR 1.77,
95%  CI  1.32  to  2.37;  1  study,  2415  participants).  Using  complete-
case  analysis  did  not  substantially  change  the  interpretation  of
results.

intervention 

involving  ACT  with
One  study  compared  an 
NRT. Gifford 2003's point estimate favoured ACT over NRT but there
was  substantial  imprecision,  meaning  the  result  could  indicate
potential  harm  as  well  as  considerable  benefit  (RR  1.27,  95%  CI
0.53 to 3.02; 102 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.2).
We judged this study to be at unclear risk of bias. Using complete-
case analysis increased the point estimate but did not substantially
change the interpretation of the results (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.72;
71 participants; Analysis 6.6).

One  study  compared  an  intervention  involving  ACT  with  brief
advice. Mak 2020's point estimate favoured ACT over brief advice
but  there  was  substantial  imprecision,  meaning  the  result  could
indicate  potential  harm  as  well  as  considerable  benefit  (RR
1.27,  95%  CI  0.59  to  2.75;  144  participants;  very  low-certainty
evidence; Analysis 2.3). We judged this study to be at high risk of
bias. Using complete-case analysis reduced the point estimate but
did  not  substantially  change  the  interpretation  of  the  result  (RR
1.06, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.11; 66 participants; Analysis 6.7).

One  study  compared  an  intervention  involving  ACT  with  less
intensive ACT. O'Connor 2020 showed no evidence of a benefit of
more intensive ACT, with the point estimate indicating no difference
between  more  and  less  intensive  ACT  (RR  1.00,  95%  CI  0.50  to
2.01;  100  participants;  low-certainty  evidence;  Analysis  2.4).  We
judged  this  study  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias.  Using  complete-case
analysis did not substantially change the interpretation of the result
(RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.86; 91 participants; Analysis 6.8).

Within-study analyses of moderators of interest

Bricker 2018 tested for moderation of the effectiveness of ACT by
baseline mental health (depression or anxiety) and commitment to
quitting. Quit rates were not found to differ significantly according
to these variables.

Gifford  2003  tested  the  effectiveness  of  ACT  in  a  subsample
of  smokers  who  were  highly  dependent.  While  there  was  no
significant difference between the ACT arm and comparator arm in

the full sample, ACT was reported to be associated with better long-
term quitting outcomes among nicotine-dependent participants.

Mental health

Two studies that tested an intervention involving ACT reported on
mental health outcomes (Analysis 2.5; very low-certainty evidence).
Both  studies  showed  no  evidence  of  a  benefit  of  ACT  on  mental
health.  Gifford  2003  (102  participants)  analysed  negative  affect
between conditions at post-treatment, six months and 12 months
and  O'Connor  2020  (150  participants)  analysed  positive  mental
health at post-treatment and six months. Neither study observed a
statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference between
conditions at any time point.

Distress tolerance training interventions

Smoking abstinence

One  study  compared  an  intervention  involving  distress  tolerance
training with an alternative smoking cessation treatment that was
matched for intensity. Bloom 2020 showed no evidence of a benefit
of distress tolerance training, with the 95% CI spanning both benefit
and  harm  (RR  0.87,  95%  CI  0.26  to  2.98;  69  participants;  low-
certainty  evidence;  Analysis  3.1).  We  judged  this  study  to  be
at  unclear  risk  of  bias.  Using  complete-case  analysis  did  not
substantially change interpretation of the result (RR 0.86, 95% CI
0.26 to 2.86; 54 participants; Analysis 6.9).

One study compared a distress tolerance training intervention with
a less intensive smoking cessation treatment (Brown 2013). There
was  substantial  imprecision,  meaning  the  result  could  indicate
potential harm as well as considerable benefit (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.33
to  8.08;  49  participants;  low-certainty  evidence;  Analysis  3.2).  We
judged this study to be at unclear risk of bias. Using complete-case
analysis did not substantially change the interpretation of the result
(RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.34 to 8.28; 46 participants; Analysis 6.10).

Mental health

One study that tested an intervention involving distress tolerance
training  reported  on  a  mental  health  outcome  (Analysis  3.3;
low-certainty  evidence).  Brown  2013  (49  participants)  analysed
negative affect at four weeks post-quit and observed no statistically
significant or clinically meaningful difference between conditions.

In  addition,  Bloom  2020  (69  participants)  planned  to  assess
depression  and  negative  affect  at  each  follow-up  (1  month,  3
months, and 6 months post-treatment), but to our knowledge have
not reported these data.

Yoga

Smoking abstinence

One  study  compared  an  intervention  involving  yoga  with  an
alternative  smoking  cessation  treatment  that  was  matched
for  intensity.  Bock  2012's  point  estimate  favoured  yoga  over
alternative smoking cessation treatment but there was substantial
imprecision, meaning the result could indicate potential harm as
well  as  considerable  benefit  (RR  1.44,  95%  CI  0.40  to  5.16;  55
participants; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 4.1). We judged
this  study  to  be  at  high  risk  of  bias.  The  number  of  participants
followed  up  in  each  arm  was  unclear  so  we  could  not  conduct  a
complete-case analysis.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Raw data on the number of quits at six months were not available
for  two  other  studies  that  tested  an  intervention  involving  yoga
so  we  could  not  calculate  unadjusted  RRs.  Bock  2019  reported
no  significant  difference  in  the  odds  of  smoking  abstinence
between  the  intervention  arm  and  matched  comparator  arm  at
six-month  follow-up  (P  >  0.05).  Gaskins  2015  also  reported  no
significant difference in the odds of smoking abstinence between
the  intervention  arm  and  less  intensive  comparator  arm  at  six-
month  follow-up  (OR  2.38,  95%  CI  0.52  to  10.8,  P  =  0.265).  There
was  substantial  imprecision,  meaning  the  result  could  indicate
potential harm as well as considerable benefit.

Two  studies  that  tested  a  yoga

evidence  of  a  benefit  of  yoga  on  mental  health.  Bock  2012  (55
participants)  analysed  depression,  anxiety,  and  general  well-
being  at  eight  weeks  (post-treatment)  and  six  months,  but  only
reported  data  collected  at  8  weeks.  No  statistically  significant
or  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  conditions  were
observed.  Gaskins  2015  (38  participants)  analysed  depression,
anxiety,  and  a  composite  measure  of  physical  self-worth,
attractiveness,  physical  strength,  and  condition,  at  eight  weeks
(post-treatment),  three  months  and  six  months.  No  statistically
significant or clinically meaningful differences between conditions,
nor any significant group by time interactions, were observed.

Summary of main results

The  21  studies  in  this  review  did  not  detect  a  clear,  long-term
benefit  of  mindfulness-based  smoking  cessation  interventions
(based  on  mindfulness  training,  ACT,  distress  tolerance  training,
or  yoga)  when  compared  with  other  interventions,  or  with
no  intervention,  for  smoking  cessation.  This  was  true  when
mindfulness-based  interventions  were  compared  with  intensity-
matched smoking cessation interventions, less intensive smoking
cessation  interventions  (including  less  intensive  mindfulness),  or
no  treatment.  However,  one  subgroup  analysis  found  a  positive
effect  of  an  ACT  intervention  when  this  was  delivered  via
smartphone  application,  as  opposed  to  face-to-face,  through  a
website, or over the telephone.

Ten  studies  collected  data  on  mental  health  and  well-being,  of
which nine analysed and reported on changes in these outcomes.
There  was  no  clear  evidence  of  a  positive  or  negative  effect  of
mindfulness-based treatments on mental health and well-being.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The searches conducted for this review were broad, in our attempt
to  find  any  study  that  made  any  mention  of  mindfulness-based
approaches. As well as medical databases, we also searched studies
registers  to  identify  any  ongoing  or  completed  but  unpublished
registered  studies,  and  supplemented  our  traditional  search
strategy  with  an  automated  search  strategy  developed  as  part
of  the  Human  Behaviour  Change  Project  (Michie  2017),  using
Microsoft  Academic.  We  therefore  feel  confident  in  our  search
approach.

A particular challenge of this review compared with other reviews
of smoking cessation treatments was bringing together a diverse

evidence base. The studies identified by this review varied widely
in their design (e.g. digital versus in person), intervention type (e.g.
ACT  versus  yoga),  nature  of  the  comparator,  and  mental  health
outcomes  assessed,  meaning  we  could  not  meaningfully  pool
results  in  a  single  meta-analysis.  While  we  intentionally  adopted
an  inclusive  approach  to  cover  a  broad  range  of  mindfulness-
based  interventions,  some  of  the  studies  included  may  have
had  a  looser  mindfulness  focus  (e.g.  yoga  interventions)  than
others (e.g. mindfulness training interventions), but our approach
to  pooling  meant  that  we  did  not  'dilute'  the  effects  of  pure
mindfulness  interventions.  The  studies  identified  in  this  review
were  mainly  conducted  in  the  USA  and  all  took  place  in  high-
income  or  higher  middle-income  countries.  Most  studies  were
carried out in the general population and so may not be applicable
to  populations  with  specific  requirements  or  particularly  high
cigarette dependence.

To  be  included  studies  had  to  assess  long-term  abstinence,  so
most studies were able to contribute cessation data to the relevant
comparisons.  However,  the  number  of  studies  and  participants
contributing to each analysis were low, and further research could
strengthen or change findings. In addition, data on mental health
outcomes  were  sparse  and  varied,  meaning  we  were  unable  to
conduct meta-analyses for this outcome. We did not assess safety
outcomes  beyond  any  adverse  effect  on  mental  health  and  well-
being  because  the  intervention  was  behavioural  and  was  not
considered high risk for adverse events.

Quality of the evidence

Of the 21 studies included in this review, we judged four to be at
low risk of bias for all domains, and eight to be at high risk in one
or more domains. In many cases, we rated studies at unclear risk of
bias because they did not report key information. In these cases, it
is impossible to know whether these studies were at any risk of bias
or whether the information was simply not reported. To investigate
the potential impact on results of studies that we judged to be at
high risk of bias, we removed these studies in sensitivity analyses.
This did not affect our interpretation of results.

We  considered  the  certainty  of  the  evidence  for  effectiveness  of
mindfulness  training,  ACT,  distress  tolerance  training,  and  yoga
interventions for smoking cessation relative to matched-intensity
smoking  cessation  treatment,  less  intensive  smoking  cessation
treatment, or no treatment. We created summary of findings tables
and carried out GRADE ratings for each comparison (Summary of
findings 1; Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3; Summary
of findings 4).

We  judged  all  comparisons  and  outcomes  to  be  of  low  or  very
low  certainty,  meaning  that  the  interpretation  of  effects  is  likely
to  change  as  more  studies  and  information  become  available.
Reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence included: risk
of bias, when all studies pooled were judged at high risk of bias;
inconsistency,  when  there  was  variance  in  the  characteristics  of
studies or statistical heterogeneity was high and unexplained; and
imprecision,  when  the  absolute  number  of  events  was  low  or
confidence intervals were wide and included no difference, or both.

Potential biases in the review process

We  took  several  steps  to  ensure  the  review  process  was  robust.
We  followed  standard  methods  used  by  the  Cochrane  Tobacco

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Addiction  Group.  Our  search  strategy  included  a  broad  range
of  databases,  including  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group's
Specialised  Register.  We  followed  standard  Cochrane  practice  of
requiring  two  review  authors  to  independently  screen  studies,
extract  data,  and  assess  risk  of  bias.  None  of  the  authors  of  this
review were also authors of included studies.

Despite  this  rigorous  approach,  it  is  possible  that  relevant
literature,  particularly  unpublished  or  grey  literature,  may  have
been missed. We did not evaluate publication bias as there were
fewer than 10 studies available for each primary outcome. It is also
possible that non-reporting of information in the published articles
may have influenced the risk of bias assessments.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

Carim-Todd 2013 conducted a systematic review of yoga and other
mind-body  interventions  for  smoking  cessation.  It  included  14
studies,  of  which  eight  studies  were  RCTs,  one  study  was  a  non-
RCT,  two  studies  applied  within-participant  controlled  designs,
and three studies used pre-post designs. We included just one of
these  RCTs  in  our  review  (Bock  2012);  the  others  did  not  meet
our inclusion criterion of six months' follow-up. Carim-Todd 2013
did  not  meta-analyse  data  due  to  differences  in  study  designs,
participants,  and  outcome  measures.  The  authors  reported  that
all  14  included  studies,  "observed  changes  in  smoking  behavior
or  in  predictors  of  smoking  behavior  that  could  be  beneficial  for
smoking  cessation"  but  more  clinical  studies  with  larger  sample
sizes and carefully monitored interventions were required to draw
firm conclusions.

Maglione  2017  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  mindfulness
meditation  interventions  for  smoking  cessation.  It  included  10
RCTs:  four  mindfulness  training  studies  that  we  included  in  the
current review (Davis 2014a; Davis 2014b; Singh 2014; Vidrine 2016),
and  six  studies  that  did  not  meet  our  inclusion  criterion  of  six
months' follow-up. Pooled data from six of the 10 studies included
by  Maglione  2017  showed  no  significant  effect  of  mindfulness
meditation versus comparator interventions (odds ratio 2.52, 95%
CI 0.76 to 8.29; I2 = 58%; 936 participants). This is consistent with
our results.

Oikonomou  2017  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  mindfulness
training  interventions  for  smoking  cessation  compared  with
current  behavioural  treatments  (the  Freedom  From  Smoking
programme  and  smoking  quit  line).  It  included  four  RCTs:  two
mindfulness  training  studies  we  included  in  the  current  review
(Davis  2014a;  Davis  2014b)  and  two  studies  that  did  not  meet
our inclusion criterion of six months' follow-up. Pooled data from
three  of  their  four  included  studies  showed  significantly  greater
smoking  abstinence  rates  in  smokers  who  received  mindfulness
treatment  compared  to  control  at  17-  to  24-week  follow-up  (RR
1.88,  95%  CI  1.04  to  3.40;  I2  =  44%;  419  participants).  This  differs
from our results. The two studies in this analysis that we included
in  our  review  showed  no  benefit  of  mindfulness  training  (Davis
2014a;  Davis  2014b).  We  excluded  the  third  from  our  review
because  its  longest  follow-up  was  just  17  weeks  (Brewer  2011).
Brewer 2011 accounts for the difference between the conclusions
of Oikonomou 2017's review and our review. Brewer 2011's results
indicated a strong benefit of mindfulness training, albeit with high
levels of imprecision (RR 4.97, 95% CI 1.52 to 16.22; 88 participants).

Goldberg  2018  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  mindfulness-based
interventions  for  psychiatric  disorders,  including  smoking  as  a
form  of  substance  use.  It  included  seven  RCTs  that  focused  on
smoking cessation, of which four compared a mindfulness-based
intervention with evidence-based treatment. Three of these studies
were  included  in  the  current  review  (Davis  2014a;  Davis  2014b;
Vidrine  2016),  but  one  did  not  meet  our  inclusion  criterion  of  six
months'  follow-up.  Pooled  data  from  four  of  the  seven  included
studies  showed  significantly  greater  smoking  abstinence  rates
in  smokers  who  received  mindfulness  treatment  compared  to
control  (d  0.42,  95%  CI  0.20  to  0.64;  I2  =  11%;  587  participants).
Similar to Oikonomou 2017, this differs from our results because
it  included  Brewer  2011,  which  showed  a  strong  benefit  of
mindfulness on abstinence rates.

Implications for practice

• We  did  not  detect  a  clear  benefit  of  mindfulness-based
interventions  for  increasing  long-term  smoking  quit  rates
compared with no treatment or alternative smoking cessation
treatments  that  are  equally  or  less  intensive.  However  this
evidence is of low or very low certainty, and further evidence is
likely to change our conclusions.

• We  also  did  not  detect  a  clear  benefit  of  mindfulness-based
interventions  for  improving  mental  health  and  well-being
compared with no treatment or alternative smoking cessation
treatments  that  are  equally  or  less  intensive.  Again,  this
evidence is of low or very low certainty, and our conclusions are
likely to change with further evidence.

Implications for research

• Further  RCTs  of  mindfulness-based  interventions  for  smoking
cessation  are  needed,  following  up  participants  at  six  months
or  longer.  Studies  with  active  comparators  (i.e.  comparing

mindfulness-based  interventions  to  currently  used  smoking
cessation  interventions)  are  likely  to  be  of  particular  use  to
decision makers.

• Further  studies  need  to  be  adequately  powered  to  detect
potentially  small  but  clinically  important  differences  between
mindfulness-based  interventions  and  active  comparators.  In
order to ensure low risk of bias, they should involve biochemical
verification  of  abstinence  along  with  improved  methods  of
retaining participants to follow-up points.

• There  is  also  a  need  for  more  consistent  reporting  of  mental
health  and  well-being  outcomes  in  studies  of  mindfulness-
based interventions for smoking cessation. Even if mindfulness
is only as successful as other behavioural support in enhancing
long-term  quit  rates,  it  may  be  preferable  to  some  smokers  if
it  improves  mental  health.  Most  studies  we  identified  did  not
report on mental health or well-being. Those that did assessed
a number of different constructs, at different time points, using
a variety of measures, meaning we could not meaningfully pool
the results. Therefore, it would be useful to develop a consensus
on the best ways to measure these outcomes in relevant studies.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Interventions

Specialist population?: women motivated to quit smoking and concerned about post-cessation
weight gain

Definition of smoker used: ≥ 5 combustible cpd for at least the past year

Participant characteristics: 100% female; average age: 50 years; 74% white; 42% SES; average cpd:
16; nicotine dependence: average FTND 4.8

All participants received CBT, including preparation for quit date, reinforcement, and support for quit-
ting, discussion of past and ongoing quit experiences, initiation of self-monitoring, identification of
triggers and high-risk situations, development of coping strategies for triggers, obtaining social sup-
port, instruction in how to use nicotine patches, and relapse prevention. Recommendations for how to
minimise weight gain were brief, de-emphasised, and consistent with standard CBT (e.g. take a walk to
cope with craving instead of smoking, eat low-calorie snacks)

Comparator

CBT + smoking health education. Diet and exercise were mentioned as strategies for health promotion
and prevention of disease but no specific recommendations for how to change diet or increase physical
activity

Mode of delivery: face-to-face (individual and group), telephone

Intensity: 9 sessions (1 x 60 min, 8 x 90 min) and 1 phone call (20 min) over 9 weeks

Pharmacotherapy: 8 weeks of nicotine patches from quit date, adjusted to individual cpd

Type of therapist/provider: each session was co-led by 2 trained group leaders, including a physician,
doctoral-level psychologists, and clinical psychology doctoral students

BCTs: 1.2 Problem solving; 2.3 Self-monitoring of behaviour; 3.1 Social support; 5.1 Information about
health consequences; 11.1 Pharmacological support

Intervention

CBT + distress tolerance for weight concern. Based on ACT and included: psychoeducation about the
relationship between smoking and weight; distress tolerance skills; discussion of weight concern as
a barrier to successful initiation of abstinence; and values-oriented living skills targeting reduction of
emotional eating after quitting

Mode of delivery: face-to-face (individual and group), telephone

Intensity: 9 sessions (1 x 60 min, 8 x 90 min) and 1 phone call (20 min) over 9 weeks

Pharmacotherapy: 8 weeks of nicotine patches from quit date, adjusted to individual cpd

Type of therapist/provider: each session was co-led by 2 trained group leaders, including a physician,
doctoral-level psychologists, and clinical psychology doctoral students

BCTs: 1.2 Problem solving; 2.3 Self-monitoring of behaviour; 3.1 Social support; 5.1 Information about
health consequences; 5.5 Anticipated regret; 11.1 Pharmacological support

• We specified in our protocol that we would include measures of depression, anxiety, quality of life, and stress as indicators of mental
health and well-being. We also included data on positive and negative affect as several of our included studies had reported on these
outcomes.

• We originally proposed that in the case of cluster-RCTs, we would extract a direct estimate of the required effect from an analysis that
properly accounted for the cluster design, and where such data were unavailable, we would perform an approximately correct analysis
if we could extract the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). However, the one cluster-RCT we identified as suitable for inclusion did
not present an analysis adjusting for the clustering effect or report an ICC. Therefore, we used unadjusted data for the primary analysis
and performed a sensitivity analysis where we estimated the ICC (0.03), based on the ICC reported in other smoking cessation studies
(Fanshawe 2017), and adjusted the analysis on this basis.

• We originally planned to conduct subgroup analyses categorising studies by (broad) intervention type, the type/intensity of control
treatment received, population type, baseline motivation to quit, baseline mental health, number of intervention behaviour change
techniques, mode of intervention delivery, and type of therapist. Given the studies covered a diverse set of interventions, we did not
consider it appropriate to pool all studies in a single meta-analysis, so we stratified our pooled analyses by intervention type. It was
then possible to conduct subgroup analyses by the type and intensity of control treatment received and mode of intervention delivery.
