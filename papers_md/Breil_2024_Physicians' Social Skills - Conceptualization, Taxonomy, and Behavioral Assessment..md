ABSTRACT

Social skills (e.g., assertiveness, empathy, ability to accept criticism) are essential for the 
medical  profession  and  therefore  also  for  the  selection  and  development  of  medical 
students. However, the term “social skills” is understood differently in different contexts. 
There is no agreed upon taxonomy for classifying physicians’ social skills, and skills with the 
same meaning often have different names. This conceptual ambiguity presents a hurdle to 
cross-context communication and to the development of methods to assess social skills. 
Drawing from behavioral psychology, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of 
social skills in the medical context. To this end, we introduce a theoretically and empirically 
informed  taxonomy  that  can  be  used  to  integrate  the  large  number  of  different  social 
skills. We consider how skills manifest at the behavioral level to ensure that we focus only 
on skills that are actually observable, distinguishable, and measurable. Here, behavioral 
research has shown that three overarching skill dimensions can be seen in interpersonal 
situations  and  are  clearly  distinguishable  from  each  other:  agency  skill  (i.e.,  getting 
ahead in social situations), communion skill (i.e., getting along in social situations), and 
interpersonal  resilience  (i.e.,  staying  calm  in  social  situations).  We  show  that  almost  all 
social skills relevant for physicians fit into this structure. The approach presented allows 
redundant descriptions to be combined under three clearly distinguishable and behavior-
based dimensions of social skills. This approach has implications for the assessment of 
social skills in both the selection and development of students.

Physicians  vary  in  how  successfully  they  handle  complex 
interpersonal  situations,  such  as  dealing  with  distressed 
patients,  resistance  from  colleagues,  or  criticism  from 
relatives. These individual differences in social skills relate 
to various positive outcomes [1, 2] and are therefore part 
of  all  global  competency  frameworks  for  physicians  (e.g., 
communicator  and  leader  in  CanMEDS,  [3];  interpersonal 
and  communication  skills  and  professionalism 
in  the 
Accreditation  Council  for  Graduate  Medical  Education’s 
Outcome Project, [4]). Furthermore, years of research have 
highlighted the importance of social skills in selection (i.e., 
aiming to select applicants with high levels of specific social 
skills  [5–9])  and  development  (i.e.,  facilitating  students 
to  develop  specific  social  skills  as  part  of  the  medical 
curriculum [10–13]).

specific  social  skills  with  the  same  implied  meaning

refers  to  some  measured  skill  as  empathy,  location  B  as

similar  observed  behavioral  differences).  Conversely,  the 
same terms are often used to describe skills with different 
implied meanings (by communication, location A refers to 
comprehensibility of language, whereas location B refers to 
aspects of active listening; see also [15]). Taken together, 
these  factors  represent  important  challenges  for  cross-
context communication and for the selection of methods 
that reliably assess and develop physicians’ social skills.

CONCEPTUALIZATION AND DEFINITION 
OF PHYSICIANS’ SOCIAL SKILLS

Historically,  different  approaches  have  been  applied 
to  conceptualize  skills  (or  competencies)1  in  different 
disciplines  [23,  25,  26,  28,  29].  For  example,  skills  have 
sometimes  been  characterized  as  abilities  to  solve 
specific  situational  requirements  (i.e.,  according  to  this 
understanding,  a  person’s  level  of  skill  would  depend 
solely on the specific situation in which they are observed). 
Recent  research  has  moved  towards  a  more  cross-
situational understanding of skills: A clear and empirically 
validated classification and assessment of different social 
skills  is  achieved  only  through  an  understanding  of  skills 
that  does  not  depend  on  specific  situations.  Otherwise, 
it  would  be  necessary  to  determine  specific  (socially) 
competent  or  (socially)  incompetent  behavioral  patterns 
for  every  conceivable  situation.  Such  an  approach  would 
be  particularly  impractical  for  the  assessment  of  skills  in 
the context of selection and development, where the aim 
is  to  select  individuals  who  will  be  able  to  meet  future 
requirements (selection) or to prepare individuals for future 
requirements  (development).  For  this  objective,  a  cross-
situational understanding of skills is more suitable.

However,  a  cross-situational  understanding  of  skills 
does  not  imply  that  individuals  will  always  behave  in  the 
same way across all situations and contexts. Rather, skills 
can  be  seen  as  potentials  to  show  certain  behaviors,  and 
thus  refer  to  behavioral  capacities  that  promote  effective 
functioning  in  relevant  situations  (see  [23,  25,  26]  for 
similar  definitions).  This  follows  a  modern,  transactional 
perspective in which behavioral expression is the result of 
a  complex  interplay  between  person  characteristics  (for 
example  the  capacities  to  show  specific  behaviors)  and 
environmental  variables  [30–33]).  In  the  case  of  social 
skills,  these  capacities  revolve  around  behaviors  that  are 
beneficial in interpersonal situations. Thus:

While there are reviews and commentaries on physicians’ 
general skills and desired competencies and their assessment 
[14,  16–20],  the  role  of  social  skills  and  their  behavioral 
manifestation  in  medicine  have  not  been  discussed  in 
depth.  However,  the  assessment  and  conceptualization  of 
social  skills  has  been  a  focus  of  behavioral  psychology  for 
many years [2, 15, 21–26]. In this article, we seek to draw 
on key insights from behavioral psychology and apply these 
ideas and concepts to the study of physicians’ social skills. To 
this end, we (a) define the term “social skills,” (b) combine 
the  relevant  social  skills  of  physicians  into  an  integrated, 
empirically  validated,  and  practically  useful  behavioral-
based  taxonomy,  and  (c)  discuss  how  this  taxonomy  has 
implications for the assessment of social skills.

Social skills refer to the entire range of skills 
(behavioral capacities) that promote effective 
functioning in interpersonal situations.

In  the  context  of  medical  practice,  these  situations 
include  not  only  interactions  with  patients,  but  also 
with  relatives,  superiors,  inferiors,  and  interdisciplinary 
and  interprofessional  teams.  Social  skills  –  often  used 
synonymously with the terms interpersonal, soft, or people 
skills  [25,  27]  –  can  be  distinguished  from  more  cognitive 
skills  (e.g.,  reasoning)  and  more  intrapersonal  skills  (e.g., 
time management, goal regulation).

Differences  between  individuals  in  specific  social  skills 
become visible in relevant interpersonal situations in which 

Breil et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.1171demonstrating  these  skills  is  essential  (e.g.,  when  only 
assertive  behavior  can  effectively  persuade  someone). 
Individuals  with  high  levels  of  specific  social  skills  can 
recognize  that  specific  behaviors  are  beneficial  in  certain 
situations  and  are  able  to  act  accordingly  (e.g.,  assertive 
physicians  recognize  the  situations  in  which  assertive 
behavior  is  required  and  can  implement  it).  By  observing 
specific  behaviors  across  multiple  relevant  situations, 
conclusions can be drawn about a person’s level of social 
skills [15, 23].

This understanding of social skills should not be equated 
with  personality  traits  (e.g.,  extraversion,  agreeableness). 
Rather, social skills refer to what someone is capable of doing 
(i.e., when it matters; “maximum performance”), whereas 
personality traits (in a narrow sense) refer to what someone 
tends to do in general (i.e., general behavioral tendencies; 
“typical  performance”  [2,  15,  26,  34].  A  physician  who  is 
rather reserved and shy in everyday life but acts assertively 
when patients are uncooperative should still be considered 
assertive (in the sense of a skill). Using the example of the 
broad social skill of agency (i.e., capacity to show assertive, 
confident,  decisive,  and  energetic  behavior),  to  show 
the  interplay  between  skills,  situations,  and  behaviors, 
it  becomes  clear  that,  while  skills  should  be  considered 
as  cross-situational  person  characteristics,  their  specific 
behavioral expression depends on the situation (Figure 1).

TAXONOMY OF PHYSICIANS’ SOCIAL 
SKILLS

COMPETENCY FRAMEWORKS AND ANALYSES OF 
REQUIREMENTS
For  a  targeted  way  to  measure  physicians’  social  skills 
and  to  establish  a  shared  language  between  medical 

637

school  departments,  it  is  necessary  to  use  a  taxonomy 
that  allocates  the  various  social  skills  to  overarching  and 
clearly  distinguishable  skill  dimensions.  According  to  the 
principle  of  parsimony,  as  few  different  dimensions  as 
possible  but  as  many  as  necessary  should  be  used  [35]. 
Only  then  will  it  be  possible  to  identify  a  clear  profile  of 
social skills for medical student selection or development. 
Competency  frameworks,  such  as  the  Outcomes  for 
Graduates  [36],  the  Accreditation  Council  for  Graduate 
Medical Education’s Outcome Project [4], or the CanMEDS 
framework [3], are only partially suitable for this purpose 
because the roles or domains described in the frameworks 
are organized around key content areas, which inevitably 
overlap significantly. For example, many roles include both 
specific  clinical  knowledge  elements  and  social  aspects 
(e.g.,  in  the  CanMEDS  role  of  leader).  At  the  same  time, 
underlying  social  skills  are  relevant  to  several  roles  (e.g., 
relationship  building  or  emotional  understanding  for 
communicator and collaborator roles). This is not a general 
critique  of  competency  frameworks  as  the  complexity  of 
physicians’  activities  makes  the  overlap  inevitable.  Also, 
the  frameworks  have  proven  very  useful  in  many  areas. 
Yet,  when  it  comes  to  a  differentiated  consideration  of 
physicians’  social  skills  for  assessment  and  training,  it 
is  neither  sufficient  nor  practical  to  consider  only  the 
competency roles.

For  a  more  meaningful  assessment  of  social  skills,  it 
is  therefore  necessary  to  elaborate  on  the  specific  skills 
that underlie the competency roles. There is already some 
preliminary work on this. For example, Wijnen-Meier and 
colleagues  [37]  extracted  25  (cross-situational)  skills 
(facets  of  competence)  from  various  frameworks  and 
studies, most of which can be categorized as social skills 
(e.g.,  teamwork  and  collegiality,  coping  with  mistakes, 
responsibility,  verbal  communication,  empathy  and

Note. The hypothetical behavior of two individuals is shown. Person 1 has a higher level of agency skill than person 2. Yet, both individuals 
behave differently depending on the situation. For example, there are situations in which both show more agentic (i.e., assertive, confident, 
decisive, and energetic) behavior, situations in which both show less agentic behavior and situations in which person 2 behaves more 
agentic than person 1.

with uncertainty; see also [38, 39]). Beyond this research, 
there  are  many  similar  lists  of  (social)  skills  that  have 
been  based  on  analyses  of  requirements  or  surveys 
that  show  the  wide  range  of  desirable  social  skills  for 
physicians  (e.g.,  Hertel-Waszak  and  colleagues  [40]: 
communication,  teamwork,  respect,  proactivity,  ability  to 
handle  stress,  ability  to  handle  criticism,  moral  integrity; 
Lambe  and  colleagues  [41]:  compassion,  pro-social 
attitude,  communication  and  listening  skills,  initiative, 
probity, ability to cope with ambiguity, ability to be a team 
player;  Hurwitz  and  colleagues  [42]:  empathy,  honesty, 
ability to work in a team, emotionally stable, decisiveness, 
leadership abilities; see also [43–45]).
However,  such  an  approach 

leads  to  a  steadily 
increasing  and  hardly  manageable  number  of  detached 
social skills with at times highly overlapping content (e.g., 
empathy  and  active  listening).  As  a  result,  classic  jingle-
jangle  fallacies  can  be  found.  The  jingle  fallacy  describes 
the false assumption that social skills with the same label 
also  have  the  same  content.  An  example  of  this  is  the 
skill  “communication,”  which  is  understood  differently 
depending on the context or the specific individuals using 
the term. The jangle fallacy describes the false assumption 
that  social  skills  with  different  labels  actually  represent 
something  different.  Examples  of  this  fallacy  include  the 
skills  empathy,  relationship  building,  and  social  sensitivity. 
Whereas  these  skills  have  slightly  different  nuances,  at 
their core, they refer to very similar behavioral expressions 
between individuals. These issues lead to the problem that 
when  different  medical  schools  or  individuals  talk  about 
certain  social  skills,  it  is  often  not  clear  what  they  really 
mean.  These  issues  are  especially  troublesome  when  it 
comes  to  selecting  people  with  specific  social  skills  or  for 
developing certain skills during their studies. Consequently, 
for  a  reliable  and  valid  assessment  of  social  skills,  it  is 
necessary to first determine in which distinguishable social 
skill dimensions people differ.

A BEHAVIORAL-BASED TAXONOMY
There  have  already  been  attempts  to  combine  different 
social  skills  into  overarching  taxonomies,  but  the  number 
of  relevant  dimensions  and  the  level  of  abstraction  vary 
considerably [2, 25, 27, 40, 46, 47]. One of the reasons for 
this variability is that, in many cases, a top-down approach 
has  been  followed,  which  means  that  skills  are  extracted 
and  defined  on  the  basis  of  analyses  of  requirements  or 
surveys  and  grouped  (i.e.,  assigned  to  higher-order  skills) 
according to perceived conceptual proximity. In this article, 
we  want  to  complement  this  approach  with  a  behavioral 
bottom-up  approach  (i.e.,  focusing  on  how  individual 
differences  manifest  at  the  behavioral  level)  which  has 

638

been  used  mainly  in  behavioral  personality  psychology. 
As  shown  earlier,  differences  in  social  skills  manifest  in 
interpersonal  behavior  in  social  situations.  Therefore,  we 
want  to  focus  on  how  these  behaviors  can  be  grouped 
empirically.  This  approach  is  an  essential  complement  to 
the  top-down  approach  because,  if  theoretically  defined 
skills  do  not  manifest  in  distinguishable  behavior,  they 
cannot  be  distinctively  captured  (see  [14]  for  similar 
lists  of  desirable 
reasoning).  Complementing  existing 
social  skills  for  physicians  with  a  bottom-up  approach  of 
distinguishable  overarching  behavioral  dimensions  should 
reduce  jingle-jangle  fallacies  and  lead  to  a  manageable 
number of skill dimensions for selection and training.

While  the  structure  of  interpersonal  behavior  has  not 
been  the  focus  of  previous  research  on  physicians’  skills 
and competencies, it is a core research topic in behavioral 
personality  psychology  [48–52].  Here,  a  large  body  of 
research  suggests  that  the  broad  spectrum  of  different 
interpersonal behaviors is best represented by three distinct 
behavioral  dimensions:  agency  (i.e.,  individual  differences 
in  getting  ahead  in  social  situations),  communion  (i.e., 
individual differences in getting along in social situations), 
and  interpersonal  resilience  (i.e.,  individual  differences  in 
staying calm in social situations).
While  the  term  agency 

is  sometimes  understood 
differently depending on the research tradition, we refer to 
agency  as  a  core  dimension  of  interpersonal  behavior,  as 
described, for example, by Leising and Bleidorn [51] “Agency 
highlights a person’s motive and capacity to ‘‘get ahead’’ 
(sometimes  ahead  of  others)”  (p.  986).  That  is,  agency 
includes  assertive,  confident,  determined,  and  energetic 
behaviors. These behaviors, in turn, can be attributed to a 
variety of social skills. For example, individuals who behave 
dominantly  and  energetically  across  a  variety  of  relevant 
situations  demonstrate 
decisiveness, 
responsibility, persuasiveness, or pragmatism. Communion 
includes  friendly,  helpful,  and  compassionate  behaviors 
and thus combines frequently mentioned social skills such 
as  cooperativeness,  empathy,  relationship  building,  social 
interpersonal  resilience 
sensitivity,  or  warmth.  Finally, 
involves  dealing  with  challenging  interpersonal  situations 
in a calm, relaxed, and emotionally balanced manner and 
includes  social  skills  such  as  the  ability  to  take  criticism, 
ambiguity  tolerance,  coping  under  pressure,  emotional 
control, or resistance to stress.2

assertiveness, 

The  division  into  agency  and  communion  is  already 
part  of  many  definitions  of  socially  skilled  individuals 
(e.g., 
linking  conflict  readiness  and  cooperativeness;  
[53–55]) and is mainly described in the context of research 
on 
theory; 
[52,  56–60]).  The  third  dimension  –  resilient  behavior  – 
can  be  derived  from  a  slightly  different  line  of  research

(interpersonal  differences 
uncertainty), is particularly visible in stressful situations and 
cannot be directly assigned to agency or communion [51, 
61–64]. Several empirical studies suggest that these three 
behavioral  dimensions  can  be  measured  distinctively  and 
reliably. For example, in an exploratory bottom-up analysis, 
Leising and Bleidorn [51] were able to show that 35 different 
(interpersonal)  adjectives  could  be  clearly  assigned  to 
these  three  factors  and  therefore  referred  to  them  as 
“basic  meaning  dimensions  of  observable  interpersonal 
behavior”.  Stable  and  distinctively  measurable  behavioral 
differences in the three dimensions have also been found 
in  situations  relevant  to  physicians  in  the  context  of 
selecting  and  training  of  medical  students  [10,  15,  48]. 
Thus, these behavioral dimensions are not only empirically 
distinguishable  and  observable  but  also  relevant  in  the 
medical context. Although there are other aspects that are 
crucial  for  physicians  (e.g.,  clinical  knowledge,  analytical 
thinking, experience), the three dimensions cover almost all 
important aspects of the interpersonal and social context.

Building  on  these  findings,  we  recommend  defining 
the  three  behavioral  dimensions  (agency,  communion, 
interpersonal  resilience)  as  overarching  dimensions  of 
physicians’  social  skills.  The  current  approach  has  several 
advantages  over  an 
intuitive  approach  to  taxonomy 
building. The three overarching skill dimensions are relevant 
to  the  medical  context  but  are  also  independent  of  each 
other because they are based on empirically distinguishable 
interpersonal dimensions. This independence allows often 
redundant terms for physicians’ social skills to be combined 
under three clear labels. For instance, the aforementioned 
social skills identified by Wijnen-Meier and colleagues [37] 
can  be  assigned  to  the  three  dimensions  (e.g.,  agency: 
responsibility,  structure  work  planning,  and  priorities; 
communion:  teamwork  and  collegiality,  empathy  and 
openness;  interpersonal  resilience:  knowing  of  personal 
bounds,  coping  with  uncertainty).  The  same  applies,  for 
example,  to  the  social  aspects  of  the  reference  list  of 
general  physician  competencies  by  the  Association  of 
American Medical Colleges (e.g., agency: demonstrate self-
confidence;  communion:  demonstrate  sensitivity,  honesty, 
and  compassion;  interpersonal  resilience:  demonstrate 
healthy coping mechanisms to respond to stress [18]).

Mapping such specific social skills onto overarching skill 
dimensions  in  this  way  not  only  facilitates  cross-context 
communication  but  also  reduces  measurement  error 
based  on  conceptual  ambiguity  (for  example,  it  makes 
it  clearer  to  people  who  are  assessing  these  skills  which 
behaviors are relevant and which are not). Thus, the three 
behavior-based dimensions of social skills offer a practically 
manageable compromise between the more requirement-
defined  and  difficult  to  distinguish  competency  roles  on 
the  one  hand  and  a  multitude  of  specific  skill  lists  with 

639

conceptual ambiguity on the other. Many measurements in 
the area of social skills can be assigned to this overarching 
structure,  regardless  of  which  measurement  level  or 
method  of  procedure  is  used  (Table  1).  Thus,  the  pooling 
of  data  and  results  not  only  across  sites  but  also  across 
different  measurement  points  within  individual  sites  can 
be facilitated (e.g., when tracking student learning progress 
over time with a wide variety of assessment formats).

ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICIANS’ SOCIAL 
SKILLS

In medical education, it has long been discussed whether 
and  how  individual  differences  that  go  beyond  specific 
clinical  knowledge  can  be  measured  and  quantified. 
Some  authors  have  argued  that  many  desirable  skills  are 
not  objectifiable  phenomena  and  therefore  may  not  be 
measurable  at  all  [14,  19,  20].  The  approach  presented 
here  addresses  this  issue  by  focusing  on  reliable  and 
clearly measurable skill dimensions. Considering the three 
overarching social skill dimensions clarifies why it has often 
not been possible to measure specific social skills reliably: 
many social skills manifest themselves in very similar and 
co-occurring  behaviors  (e.g.,  cooperativeness,  empathy, 
relationship building, social sensitivity, warmth, all of which 
revolve around very similar behaviors).

The  empirical  and  theoretical  foundation  of  the  three 
skill dimensions also make it possible to identify the types 
of situations in which they become visible and measurable. 
We determined these situation characteristics on the basis 
of previous research [50, 61–63, 65]. Individual differences 
in the agency  skill dimension become visible  in situations 
involving reactance, decision-making, or conflict. Situations 
that  involve  sadness  or  the  need  for  help  primarily  evoke 
individual  differences  in  communion.  Finally,  stressful 
situations  (e.g.,  social  stressors,  performance  stressors, 
time  pressure)  or  ambiguity  evoke  individual  differences 
in  interpersonal  resilience  (see  Table  1  for  more  specific 
examples). It can be seen that the measurability of social 
skills  can  be  ensured  through  a  targeted  adaptation  of 
situations, which has implications for the measurement of 
social skills before and during a student’s studies.

“knows  how”  level)  is  assessed  but  also  the  concrete 
implementation  (“How  do  I  actually  behave?”;  “shows

level  in  all  three  skills,  meaning  they  will  be  able  to  get 
ahead in social situations, get along in social situations, and 
stay  calm  in  social  situations).  Through  the  targeted  use 
of  the  situation  characteristics,  the  selection  simulations 
can be designed in such a way that relevant differences in 
the  respective  skills  can  be  observed.  One  way  to  ensure 
that  only  differences  in  the  selected  skills  are  assessed 
is  to  develop  simulation  stations  that  focus  primarily  on 
only one skill dimension at a time (see [15] for a selection 
procedure that was developed in this way).

When  assessing  social  skills  during  a  student’s  course 
of  study,  it  first  is  necessary  to  differentiate  between 
simulated and real situations. Measurements in simulated 
situations primarily involve simulation patients (e.g., in the 
form of objective structured clinical examinations [70–72]). 
Again, it is possible to create situations that allow for visible 
differences in the skill dimensions. As the student’s course 
of study progresses, clinical content (i.e., taking a patient’s 
history  or  taking  someone’s  blood  pressure)  can  then  be 
added in addition to social requirements. Depending on how 
the clinical situation is framed, different social skills can be 

assessed. For example, if the patient whose blood pressure 
needs  to  be  measured  is  resistant,  differences  in  agency 
skill will be visible, and if the patient is sad, differences in 
communion skill will be visible. This simple adjustment of 
situations allows targeted training of social skills in a range 
of relevant clinical contexts. Also, when training social skills, 
a  distinction  can  be  made  between  the  knowledge  and 
implementation  levels  (e.g.,  social  knowledge:  discussing 
the  situations  in  which  it  is  helpful  to  behave  assertively 
and confidently; implementation: teaching and practicing 
assertive rhetoric and body language).

An assessment of social skills in real-life situations takes 
place,  for  example,  with  students  in  their  internship  year 
or in postgraduate training with real patients. In this case, 
the  supervisors  usually  assess  the  students  with  the  help 
of rating instruments. In contrast to simulated situations, 
a targeted manipulation of the situation characteristics is 
not  possible  here.  Yet,  the  division  into  three  overarching 
social skill dimensions can be well integrated here as well, 
for example, within the concept of Entrustable Professional 
Activities  (EPA  [73–77]).  For  example,  within  specific  EPAs 
(e.g., informing and advising patients), recurring situational 
characteristics that map onto the dimensions of physicians’ 

Breil et al. Perspectives on Medical Education DOI: 10.5334/pme.1171social  skills  can  be  defined  (e.g.,  communion  domain: 
the  student  demonstrated  compassionate  and  kind 
behavior  when  they  had  to  deliver  bad  news  to  patients; 
interpersonal resilience domain: the student demonstrated 
calm and relaxed behavior when faced with time pressure 
when  dealing  with  patients).  Such  a  combination  of 
activities, relevant situation characteristics, and behaviors 
is much more meaningful than a purely global assessment 
of  specific  skills  (e.g.,  the  student  was  empathetic)  or 
activities (e.g., the student was able to advise and inform 
patients).

Of course, the proposed categorization covers only some 
of the skills relevant to (future) physicians. For example, the 
focus  on  observable  social  behavior  makes  it  difficult  to 
capture  intrapersonal  processes  (e.g.  motivations,  ethical 
values)  that  may  also  have  an  influence  on  effective 
functioning  in  interpersonal  situations.  Yet,  overall,  the 
approach  presented  could  form  a  common  framework 
for  the  assessment  of  observable  social  skills  from  the 
selection process to clinical practice, allowing for flexibility 
in the measurement of social skills as its use is independent 
of  measurement  methods  and  clinical  contexts.  Many 
existing procedures can be classified into this structure by 
analyzing which behaviors are actually exhibited and which 
are evaluated in the respective situations.

CONCLUSION

A shared understanding of the term “social skills” is needed 
for  effective  cross-context  communication  and  for  the 
joint  development  of  procedures  to  assess  physicians’ 
social  skills.  In  this  article,  we  have  moved  closer  to  this 
goal  by  proposing  a  behaviorally  and  empirically  based 
conceptualization and taxonomy. We see this article as an 
impetus for a more in-depth discussion of social skills in the 
medical community and recommend that in the future, the 
conceptualization,  measurement,  and  communication  of 
physicians’ social skills should be guided by the taxonomy 
presented.

NOTES

1  In this research, we use the terms “skills” and “competencies” 

interchangeably. There are studies in which distinctions are made 
(i.e., competencies as a broader term that incorporates many 
skills), but differences in which term is used mostly depend on 
the research tradition (see 25, 27). When it comes to the social 
domains, the term “social skills” is considerably more widespread 
than the term “social competencies.”

2  Please note that the “interpersonal resilience” dimension is 
often also called “emotional stability”. We suggest the label 
“interpersonal resilience” since it focuses on how one deals with 
stressors specifically in the interpersonal domain (i.e., staying calm 
in social situations).
