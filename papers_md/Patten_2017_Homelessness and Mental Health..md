The At Home/Chez Soi study was a multisite randomised
controlled trial demonstrating the effectiveness of a
“housing first” intervention in Canada. The “housing first”
model is related to the Pathways to Housing model that
originated in New York City. The concept is to immediately
provide permanent housing at a location largely chosen by
the participant and also to provide wrap-around supports.1
Positive results from the At Home/Chez Soi trial were pre-
viously summarised in The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry
(CJP) by Aubry et al.2 People receiving the housing first
intervention had superior housing outcomes and showed
benefits in functioning and quality of life compared to a
treatment-as-usual comparator. Such interventions, of
course, are not a panacea. Earlier this year, Adair et al.3
reported the occurrence of both positive and negative hous-
ing trajectories in the housing first and treatment-as-usual
arms of At Home/Chez Soi. In the current issue of the CJP,
Aquin et al.4 examine 2 additional outcomes, suicidal idea-
tion and attempts, in the At Home/Chez Soi cohort. Suicidal
ideation was found to diminish over time, but no differences
between the intervention and control groups were observed.
No differences were found in suicide attempts either. The
improvement in suicidal ideation may be due to regression to
the mean. At Home/Chez Soi recruited its participants from
shelters, hospitals, and agencies. At the time of recruitment,
the participants may have had higher levels of suicidal idea-
tion than is usual for them, something that could cause
regression to the mean as those participants returned closer
to their long-term baseline over time. Resources available to
the respondents in both study groups (the treatment-as-usual
group was not denied services) may also have led to
improvement over time. Another possible explanation is the
“Hawthorne effect”: the tendency for better outcomes to
occur when one is aware that one is being observed, as in
the context of a study.

Another study published in this issue looked at suicides
among homeless and precariously housed residents of Tor-
onto.5 Coroner records were reviewed for all suicide deaths
in Toronto from 1998 to 2012. The study found that 1.8% of
people dying by suicide were homeless, a large number
given that only about 0.2% of the Toronto population is

homeless at a point in time. Homeless people dying by sui-
cide were younger and more likely to be male than nonho-
meless people dying by suicide. They were also more likely
to have been seen by an emergency department or outpatient
psychiatrist in the week prior to their death and to have died
by falling or jumping. These results provide a descriptive
comparison of suicides by homeless and nonhomeless per-
sons, which is valuable information for formulating preven-
tive strategies. However, since inclusion in the study was
restricted to those people who died by suicide, the study
could not estimate or compare suicide rates in different pop-
ulation sub-groups. Because there are many causal pathways
to suicide (it is a common outcome upon which many causal
pathways “collide”), associations between various predictors
are subject to distortion, and therefore are not reported.6,7

People who are marginally housed, something that is
often associated with severe poverty, share many of the
challenges of homeless persons. Marginal housing often
coexists with extreme poverty, with both having major
implications for health care delivery. These problems led
to the initiation of the Hotel Study, findings from which are
also reported in this issue.8 The study looked at data from a
variety of sources, including hospital records, police records,
and a prospective cohort study following 375 residents of
Vancouver’s downtown east side between 2008 and 2015.
The authors used a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) to
quantify mortality in the cohort. This involves counting the
observed and expected number of deaths in a cohort. The
expected number of deaths is estimated using available age-
and sex-specific mortality rates for the Canadian general
population. The SMR is then calculated by dividing the
observed number of deaths by the expected number of
deaths. In this case, the SMR was 8.4, highlighting the vastly
elevated risk of death in this population. Management of

human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found to be
effective, whereas management of hepatitis C and psychosis
was less so. A key finding was that disease-specific manage-
ment did not seem to convey benefits across different dis-
eases for participants having multimorbidity. The authors
call for the development of innovative services that can bet-
ter deal with multimorbidity as opposed to relying on
disease-specific management strategies.

It is important to have the kinds of data reported in these
studies in order to develop more effective services and pol-
icies. However, it is also important to be able to measure
health status in homeless, marginalised, and precariously
housed people. Without an ability to monitor the health sta-
tus of this population, how could the impact of interventions
and other changes over time be assessed? Unfortunately,
descriptive data have been scarce. Historically, available
evidence has mostly come from small, local studies. This
issue contains a report of the 2015 National Canadian Home-
lessness Youth Survey, the largest effort of its kind to
describe the health status of homeless youth in Canada.9
Accomplishing such a study is a very difficult challenge.
Most health surveys start with a list, or sampling frame,
representing all members of a target population. They then
select, usually through a random selection process, a sample
from this sampling frame for participation in the survey.
Typical sampling frames for population-based studies are
based on lists of telephone numbers, addresses, or adminis-
trative databases, but no such frame exists for homeless
people. The survey sought to address this challenge by work-
ing with 57 agencies serving homeless youth in 42 commu-
nities across Canada. They were successful in collecting data
from 1103 youth, representing Nunavut and all Canadian
provinces except Prince Edward Island. Unfortunately, a
need for brevity required the collection of data on mental
health status to be limited to a questionnaire-style interview.
Nevertheless, a disturbing picture is presented: 42% of their
participants reported 1 or more suicide attempts, and 85%
had high levels of psychological distress.

As all of these studies demonstrate, issues of homeless-
ness are deeply intertwined with those of mental health.
These are important concerns for Canadian psychiatrists.
The CJP is proud to present this series of studies and to

participate in the advancement of knowledge, policy, and
practice related to these very difficult problems.
