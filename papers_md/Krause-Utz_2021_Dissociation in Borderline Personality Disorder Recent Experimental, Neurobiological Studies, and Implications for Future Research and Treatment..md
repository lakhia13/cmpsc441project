Abstract
Purpose of Review The aim of this review article is to give an overview over recent experimental neurobiological research on
dissociation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), in order to inform clinicians and to stimulate further research. First, we
introduce basic definitions and models that conceptualize dissociation from a transdiagnostic perspective. Then, we discuss
recent findings in BPD.
Recent Findings Stress-related dissociation is a key symptom of BPD, closely linked to other core domains of the disorder
(emotion dysregulation, identity disturbances, and interpersonal disturbances). The understanding of neurobiological correlates
of dissociation across different psychiatric disorders (e.g., dissociative disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder) is steadily
increasing. At the same time, studies explicitly focusing on dissociation in BPD are still scarce.
Summary There is evidence for adverse effects of dissociation on affective-cognitive functioning (e.g., interference inhibition),
body perception, and psychotherapeutic treatment response in BPD. On the neural level, increased activity in frontal regions (e.g.,
inferior frontal gyrus) and temporal areas (e.g., inferior and superior temporal gyrus) during symptom provocation tasks and
during resting state was observed, although findings are still diverse and need to be replicated. Conceptual differences and
methodological differences in study designs and sample characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, trauma history) hinder a straightfor-
ward interpretation and comparison of studies. Given the potentially detrimental impact of dissociation in BPD, more research on
the topic is strongly needed to deepen the understanding of this complex clinical condition.

understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of dissocia-
tion, even though many ambiguities remain. Compared to the
relatively large body of literature on dissociative disorders
(e.g., DID) and the dissociative subtype of PTSD, research
explicitly focusing on dissociation in BPD remains scarce
[3, 4(cid:129)(cid:129), 5(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Given the high comorbidity of BPD with disso-
ciative disorders and PTSD, disentangling disorder-specific
effects of dissociation is complicated. Nonetheless, dissocia-
tion may affect psychopathological symptom presentation and
treatment of psychiatric disorders in different ways [3, 4(cid:129)(cid:129),
5(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Therefore, a more detailed review of the current literature
on dissociation in BPD can help to improve the understanding
of this severe, complex disorder by stimulating more research.
In this article, we present an overview of recent experimen-
tal studies on dissociation in BPD. Building on our previous
review [3], we focus on neuroimaging studies, published in
2017 or later. In our present article, we further expand our
scope by including experimental research using psychophys-
iological approaches or investigating the effect of dissociation
on body perception and pain processing. All these studies
were identified by our search terms in relevant databases
(PubMed, PsychInfo, Science Direct, and Web of Science),
using combinations of the following keyword groups: border-
line personality disorder, dissociation, (e.g., dissociative
symptoms, dissociative disorders, trait dissociation); brain
(e.g., brain alterations, brain activity), experimental, magnetic
resonance imaging, neurobiological, neuroimaging, neuro-
physiological, neuropsychological, and psychophysiological.
The search was limited to articles published in English, in
peer-reviewed journals, described studies in human partici-
pants and used validated standardized self-report measures
of dissociation.

To provide a framework for the interpretation of these find-
ings, we first introduce basic definitions and current concep-
tualizations of dissociation.

Definitions, Etiological Models, and Clinical
Presentation of Dissociation

Dissociation is a complex and transdiagnostic phenomenon,
which has been defined as a “disruption of and/or discontinu-
ity in the normal, subjective integration of one or more aspects
of psychological functioning, including – but not limited to –
memory, identity, consciousness, perception, and motor
control” (Spiegel et al., 2011; p. 826) [6]. Disruptions involve
a wide range of psychological and somatoform functions and
can influence daily functioning in various ways. Psychologi-
cal aspects of dissociation comprise states of subjective de-
tachment, such as depersonalization and derealization, mem-
ory fragmentations including amnesia, and identity distur-
bances. Somatoform dissociation interferes with bodily func-
tioning, e.g., motor control, body representation, and pain

perception [6]. The severity of dissociative symptoms lies on
a broad continuum [7]. Milder symptoms, such as absorption,
depersonalization, or derealization also occur in non-clinical
populations, e.g., due to sleep deprivation, exhaustion, stress,
or substance misuse. Severe pathological forms of dissocia-
tion may involve the inability to access normally amenable
information (e.g., dissociative amnesia) and to control motor
processes (e.g., tonic immobilization), as well as involuntary
and unwanted intrusions of sensory, affective, and cognitive
information into conscious awareness or behavior (dissocia-
tive flashbacks) [8]. Individuals differ in their general tenden-
cy to experience dissociation (trait dissociation), which
should be differentiated from acute transient states (state
dissociation). Acute dissociation typically last for minutes or
hours, but may also last for days. Multiple validated measures
have been developed to assess state and trait dissociation,
including (among others) the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) [9] and stan-
dardized questionnaires, such as the Dissociative Experience
Scale (DES, trait dissociation) [10] and the Dissociative Stress
Scale (DSS, state dissociation) [11].

Etiological Models of Dissociation

Controversies about the etiology of dissociation reach back to
the beginning of modern psychiatry and psychology (for a
more detailed discussion, see e.g., [12–14]). The development
of dissociation seems to involve a complex interplay of mul-
tiple factors, including genetic factors and neurobiological,
temperamental disposition, and environmental factors. With
regard to environmental factors, “trauma models” highlight
the importance of traumatic life experiences (e.g., [15–20],
whereas socio-cognitive models underline the role of social-
cultural factors, fantasy proneness, heightened susceptibility,
and sleep disturbances [21, 22].

Trauma models propose that dissociation is a (potentially
evolutionary-based) defensive mechanism to cope with intol-
erable overwhelming experiences [8, 23, 24]. Dissociation
may serve as a survival strategy to deal with extremely stress-
ful emotions, thoughts, and sensations, especially in response
to pervasive threat with low or no chance to escape. Traumatic
events may be perceived as a film-like scenario that happens
to another person (depersonalization/derealization). Out-of-
body experiences, analgesia, and emotional numbing may be
a response to intolerable physical and emotional pain, as they
may create an inner distance from extremely disturbing expe-
riences that cannot be integrated into existing views of the
world, self, and others [16]. During dissociation, salient char-
acteristics of the event might be encoded and stored as sepa-
rate elements [8], leading to a compartmentalization
(fragmentation) of memories, which may later re-occur as un-
wanted implicit flashbacks memories, e.g., in the context of
PTSD [25]. Multiple lines of research have provided empirical

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

evidence for the relationship between trauma and dissociation.
In a recent meta-analysis [26(cid:129)(cid:129)], higher dissociation was
linked to adverse childhood experiences, especially severe
sexual and physical abuse by caregivers. Earlier age of onset,
longer duration of abuse, and parental abuse significantly pre-
dicted higher levels of dissociation [26(cid:129)(cid:129)].

However, the trauma model has been frequently debated
and different views exist on the mechanisms that underlie the
development of dissociative disorders, especially DID [12].
The socio-cognitive model questions the direct causal rela-
tionship between trauma and DID and highlights the role of
sociocultural expectations or sleeping problems. Questioning
techniques and media influence are assumed to contribute to
the way individuals with DID express their experiences, such
as emotional instability, identity problems, and impulsive be-
havior [22]. Up to now, there is no agreement on the etiology
of dissociation [21, 22] and the etiology may differ from per-
son to person. The neurobiological models, described in more
detail below, offer hypotheses as to how potential etiological
factors, such as trauma, may have altered brain networks in-
volved in dissociation [17]. Before we turn to these models,
we describe how dissociation can have diverse clinical presen-
tations, as different symptoms may be associated with differ-
ent neurobiological alterations.

Clinical Presentations

Pathological dissociation is a feature of several psychiatric
disorders. A recent meta-analysis found that dissociative ex-
periences are most prevalent in dissociative disorders (DID,
dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disor-
der, dissociative fugue, and dissociative disorder not other-
wise specified), followed by PTSD, BPD, and conversion
disorder [2(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Dissociation can also occur as a symptom of
schizophrenia [27], major depressive disorder [28], bipolar
disorder [29], and obsessive-compulsive disorder [30]. The
differentiation between psychotic and dissociative symptoms
can be challenging [31, 32]. Many patients with severe disso-
ciative symptoms have a long history of hospitalizations, mis-
diagnoses, and inefficient pharmacological treatment [33],
and it often takes years for patients to find adequate treatment
[34]. Understanding the psychopathological context in which
dissociation occurs (e.g., degree of emotion dysregulation and
suicidality) may improve its treatment [35, 36].

In BPD, stress-related dissociation is one of the core diag-
nostic features [1]. Up to 80% of patients experience transient
dissociative symptoms. Research suggests that dissociative
symptoms are most severe in a subgroup of patients with
higher overall symptom severity [1, 37] and more severe trau-
matic experiences [26(cid:129)(cid:129), 38].

Dissociation has been linked to other BPD core features,
especially to emotion dysregulation and identity disturbances
[39]. Emotion dysregulation includes a predisposition towards

intense, emotional reactions, and maladaptive emotion regu-
lation strategies, e.g., suicidal behavior, non-suicidal self-in-
jury (NSSI), substance abuse, spending sprees, and risky sex-
ual encounters [40, 41]. The strength, frequency, and intensity
of dissociation correlate with emotional distress [42] and im-
pulsive decision-making [43]. Dissociation may also exagger-
ate difficulties identifying emotions and being aware of them
[44]. Reducing emotional distress and terminating dissocia-
tion are main motives for NSSI in adults with BPD [45, 46],
possibly related to reduced pain processing and analgesia dur-
ing dissociative states [47]. Dissociation has also been associ-
ated with more intense suicidal ideation in adolescents with
BPD features, although it did not necessarily contribute to
self-injury in this adolescent population [48].

Disturbances in identity are another core domain of BPD
[49–51]. Individuals with the disorder experience rapid chang-
es in identity, which is often experienced as incoherent, incon-
sistent, vague, or fragmented, accompanied by objective
incoherencies in thought, feeling, and behavior [49]. These
identity disturbances show considerable overlap with features
of identity disorders and dissociative disorders [52]. It has
been proposed that identity disturbance in BPD is less stable
and more subtle than in DID [53]. However, a lack of subjec-
tive coherence along with an objective incoherence in
thoughts, feelings, and behavior was also found to distinguish
BPD from other mental disorders [49]. In BPD, identity/sense
of self is closely related to low self-esteem, which is highly
unstable under daily life conditions [50, 54]. Along with a
negative self-esteem, individuals with BPD often report a neg-
ative body perception [51, 55], which has been linked to child
sexual abuse [56].

Interpersonal disturbances (e.g., rejection sensitivity,
marked mistrust, and a strong ambitendency between an in-
tense need for closeness and a need for autonomy) are the third
core domain of BPD [57–60]. Individuals with BPD are not
only more sensitive to negative social clues, such as angry
faces [61] but also have problems in detecting and memoriz-
ing positive social signals and events [57, 62, 63]. A negativity
bias, e.g., when evaluating facial expressions may contribute
to these difficulties [61, 64, 65] and may make individuals
with BPD more susceptible to emotional interference [64].
Distractibility by social cues (e.g., faces, interpersonal scenes)
has been linked to acute dissociation in BPD [66]. However, it
remains unclear whether dissociation influences the percep-
tion of social stimuli (e.g., contributes to a negativity bias) in
BPD. A recent study in individuals who experienced child-
hood maltreatment did not reveal evidence for a significant
correlation between dissociation and deficits in the interpreta-
tion of neutral facial expressions [67]; respective studies in
BPD are still needed. In general, dissociation may also con-
tribute to increased risk of re-victimization in individuals who
experienced child sexual abuse. Along with maladaptive cog-
nitive coping styles (e.g., self-blame) dissociation was found

37    Page 4 of 17

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

to mediate this link [68, 69], which needs to be replicated in
prospective studies.

Importantly, acute dissociation predicted poor treatment
outcome in BPD patients (with and without PTSD) [70, 71],
which may not be the case for trait dissociation and PTSD
patients without BPD (see meta-analysis by Hoeboer et al.,
2020 [72(cid:129)(cid:129)]). In two different treatment studies, patients with
BPD and higher levels of dissociation had relatively poor
treatment response to dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
[70, 71]. A possible reason for this link may be that acute
dissociation interferes with emotional learning (e.g., during
exposure treatment) in BPD [66, 73–75]. Patients with the
disorder who reported acute dissociation, showed impaired
acquisition during a differential aversive delay-conditioning
paradigm [74] and during an operant conditioning task [76].
In the latter study, patients were exposed to aversive and neu-
tral stimuli while performing a task combining learning acqui-
sition and reversal. Higher dissociation, along with increased
emotional arousal, was related to worse acquisition, but not
reversal learning in BPD. Dissociation may particularly inter-
fere with the acquisition of new information in a stressful
context. A recent systematic review suggests that impaired
attention, executive functioning, memory, and social cogni-
tion can be found across different psychiatric disorders with
high trait dissociation [77]. However, acute dissociation may
affect executive functions in these disorders in different ways.
In BPD, dissociation was associated with impaired working
memory [66] and other executive functions implicated in
goal-directed behavior [66, 73, 75, 78], whereas it might be
linked to improved working memory in DID (e.g., [79]). This
raises the question whether the observed effects may be spe-
cific to certain disorders or subsamples. More research is
needed to disentangle the effects of dissociation on treatment
in the context of BPD, PTSD, and DID.

Adding to this debate, it remains unclear if certain alter-
ations in affective-cognitive processing during dissociation
are due to a history of complex trauma (e.g., severe abuse
and neglect), which is frequent in BPD and other disorders
associated with dissociation. In 2018, the 11th edition of the
World Health Organization’s International Classification of
Diseases (ICD-11) [80] introduced the diagnosis of complex
PTSD (CPTSD). As a “sibling disorder” of PTSD, CPTSD
involves “classical” PTSD symptoms (intrusive re-
experiencing, avoidance of traumatic reminders,
hyperarousal) and two symptoms from each of three domains
of Disturbances of Self-Organization (DSO): [1] emotional
numbing and dysregulation [2(cid:129)(cid:129)], self-perceptions as guilty
or worthless [3], and emotional detachment in relationships.
There is potential symptom overlap between CPTSD, DSM-
based PTSD, BPD, and DID [81]. While there is still a lack of
consensus regarding the validity of the CPTSD diagnosis,
research suggests that it detects a group of individuals with
significant impairment who would not receive a diagnosis

under the DSM-5 [82]. Compared to PTSD, individuals with
CPTSD more often report multiple forms of trauma that are
predominantly interpersonal in nature [83]. With respect to
dissociation, those with CPTSD report significantly higher
levels of dissociative experiences compared to those with
PTSD (Cohen’s d = 1.04) and compared to those with no di-
agnosis (d = 1.44) in a highly traumatized clinical sample [84].
Both CPTSD and BPD encompass difficulties in emotion
regulation, self-concept, and interpersonal relationships.
While BPD diagnosis does not require an index trauma, symp-
toms of both disorders may likely co-occur [85]. Therefore, a
growing number of studies have aimed to investigate how
CPTSD and BPD can be empirically distinguished among
trauma-exposed populations [81]. In this context, further re-
search needs to determine if dissociation is a risk factor for the
development and outcome of CPTSD [84] and how this may
be differentiated from dissociation in other disorders, such as
PTSD [1], as well as BPD [81].

Neurobiological Models and Transdiagnostic
Research on Dissociation

Several models have proposed that pathological dissociation
coincides with a distinct pattern of neurobiological alterations,
such as an increased recruitment of brain regions implicated in
the control of emotions and somatosensory input, as well as
dampened autonomic arousal.

In 1998, Sierra and Berrios proposed a corticolimbic-
disconnection model [86], which suggests that a “disconnec-
tion” of corticolimbic brain regions contributes to symptoms
of depersonalization, such as numbing, analgesia, hypervigi-
lance, and emptiness of thoughts.

It is assumed that depersonalization involves an increased
activation of medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (areas
implicated in cognitive control and arousal modulation). Both
directly and indirectly, via the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), these regions are assumed to dampen activity in the
amygdala. In other words, an increased interplay of these re-
gions is assumed to lead to a dampening of autonomic arousal.
Decreased activity of the amygdala, which is crucial to the
initiation of stress and fear responses, may be associated with
a shutting down of the affective system [87]. Evidence for this
model stems from research in depersonalization disorder
[87–89]. In addition to the abovementioned regions, the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior insula [90], and pos-
terior cingulate [91] have been implicated in altered inward-
directed processing (e.g., self-referential processing), which
may contribute to the proposed shutdown of the affective sys-
tem during depersonalization.

An autonomic “shutdown” during dissociation, associated
with increased parasympathetic activity, has also been pro-
posed by another model, the defense cascade model by

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

Page 5 of 17     37

Schauer and Elbert (2010) [23]. We refer to this model in more
detail below, in the context of psychophysiological research
on dissociation in BPD.

Based on the idea that dissociative symptoms, such as dis-
tortions in time, thought, body, and emotions, are distinct
“trauma-related states of consciousness” [31], it has been pro-
posed that they are associated with a distinct psychophysio-
logical and neural profile [17, 18]. With respect to PTSD and
its dissociative subtype (D-PTSD) [1], Lanius and colleagues
[17] proposed that D-PTSD can be differentiated from PTSD
by a distinct pattern of neural activity [31], involving in-
creased frontal activation (in dorsal/rostral ACC, mPFC) and
dampened limbic activity (in the amygdala and insula). In
addition, alterations in the thalamus (filtering sensory input
from both subcortical limbic regions and frontal areas) [18]
and regions implicated in defensive coping responses, such as
the periaqueductal gray (PAG) [92] and the superior colliculus
[93] have been implicated in the dissociative subtype.
Reduced sensory processing may underlie reduced attention
and arousal, which may lead to progressive cognitive dysfunc-
tion [77]. A study using stochastic dynamic causal modeling
of resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) in D-PTSD
[94] found greater amygdala FC with prefrontal regions in-
volved in emotion regulation (middle frontal gyrus, medial
frontal gyrus). These findings are in line with the idea that
dissociation may be a self-regulatory response to cope with
overwhelming emotions. In another study by this group [95],
patients with D-PTSD showed a predominant pattern of top-
down emotion regulation from the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex to the amygdala and PAG and from the amygdala to
the PAG. Additionally, a stronger coupling of the (bilateral
anterior, left mid, and left posterior) insula to the left
basolateral amygdala complex was found in D-PTSD [96],
which correlated with depersonalization/derealization symp-
toms and PTSD symptom severity. A functional magnetic
resonance imaging study by Felmingham and colleagues
[97] found enhanced ventral prefrontal cortex activation (sug-
gesting enhanced prefrontal control) for threatening informa-
tion that was presented on a supraliminal (conscious) level.
When threatening stimuli were presented on a non-conscious
level, PTSD patients with high dissociation showed increased
activity in the bilateral amygdala, insula and left thalamus
compared to patients without dissociation. These findings
are mostly in line with previous findings in D-PTSD [17]
and suggest that enhanced prefrontal control may be a con-
scious coping strategy, which may not function during non-
conscious threat processing. A more recent study by this
group [98] revealed a positive correlation between activity in
the right insula during supraliminal (conscious) threat process-
ing and dissociative symptoms in patients with CPTSD.

Resembling findings in PTSD, two studies in DID ob-
served lower activity in cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, and
para-hippocampus when patients reported voluntary access to

traumatic memories, whereas the opposite response pattern
was found during dissociative amnesia [99, 100]. These find-
ings suggest that the abovementioned processes are likely
transdiagnostic in nature.

Indeed, a recent systematic review by Lotfinia, Soorgi,
Mertens, and Daniels (2020) [4(cid:129)(cid:129)] that included 33 functional
and structural neuroimaging studies across different disorders
found evidence for transdiagnostic brain alterations in frontal
and temporal regions, with the closest overlap for PTSD and
DID. However, studies included in the systematic review [4(cid:129)(cid:129)]
were quite diverse, covering widespread clusters of neural
alterations, and findings should be considered preliminary,
as replication studies are strongly needed.

Another (more extensive) systematic review by Roydeva
and Reinders (2020) [5(cid:129)(cid:129)], which included 205 unique studies,
suggests that functional alterations in the dorsomedial and
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral superior frontal re-
gions, (anterior) cingulate, posterior association areas, and
basal ganglia may be seen as neurofunctional biomarkers of
pathological dissociation across different psychiatric disor-
ders. One of the most consistent neurofunctional findings
was enhanced activity of the inferior frontal gyrus and medial
prefrontal cortex during symptom provocation tasks. With
respect to brain structure, a relatively consistent pattern of
decreased volumes in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and
thalamus emerged.

Nonetheless, it is not entirely clear whether the afore-
mentioned models and empirical findings are representa-
tive of the variety of dissociative symptoms in different
mental disorders [4(cid:129)(cid:129), 5(cid:129)(cid:129)]. As previously mentioned, dis-
sociation in BPD seems to be particularly related to acute
states of high arousal and disturbed emotional memory and
learning [42, 66, 73–75], whereas in DID the opposite pat-
tern was observed [79]. Therefore, functional alterations in
BPD may be more closely related to temporary changes
and more clearly detected during acute dissociation, as fur-
ther discussed below.

Neuroimaging Studies on Dissociation in BPD

In general, neuroimaging research in BPD is rapidly growing.
The constant development of neuroimaging methods and an-
alytical techniques has increased knowledge about possible
neurobiological underpinnings. Disturbances in corticolimbic
circuitry involving the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, ante-
rior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cor-
tex have been associated with problems in emotion regulation,
interpersonal disturbances, and disturbed identity [101, 102].
Amygdala hyper-reactivity to threat-related stimuli has
been trans-diagnostically linked to increased emotional re-
sponsiveness. A recent meta-analysis concluded that amygda-
la hyper-reactivity is more pronounced in BPD patients than in

37    Page 6 of 17

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

both healthy and depressed samples [103]. Reduced amygdala
habituation to repeated negative stimuli in BPD is a consistent
finding ([104], see also [102]), and seems to be related to
adverse childhood experiences [105]. Importantly, increased
amygdala response to negative versus neutral images predict-
ed poor individual treatment response in BPD [106]. In this
recent proof-of-principle study, multimodal MRI (functional
MRI during three different emotion regulation tasks and struc-
tural MRI), demographic, and clinical data was used to predict
individual therapy response for DBT, using random forest
classification analysis. Increased amygdala and para-
hippocampal activation during a cognitive reappraisal task
(emotional challenge and regulation), along with BPD sever-
ity and amygdala gray matter volume, predicted individual
treatment response. Moreover, there is evidence that the
amygdala may be a promising target for neurofeedback train-
ing in BPD [107, 108]. After real-time fMRI neurofeedback
training of amygdala hemodynamic activity, participants im-
proved downregulation of their amygdala blood oxygen-
level-dependent (BOLD) response, showed a decrease in
emotion-modulated startle to negative pictures, and reported
less affective instability in their daily life [107].

While it has been proposed that diminished prefrontal con-
trol of the amygdala underlies clinically observed problems in
emotion regulation and impulse control, this model has been
challenged due to methodological problems, e.g., a lack of
spatial and disease specificity [109, 110]. Reduced activity
in dorsolateral and orbitofrontal regions has been observed
in subgroups of patients who show anger-related aggression
[111], but its role in deficient emotion dysregulation in BPD
remains elusive [109].

To our knowledge, only few neuroimaging studies in BPD
focused explicitly on brain alterations linked to dissociation.
Table 1 provides an overview of studies, identified by our
literature search and published between January 2017 and
December 2020. This table illustrates that studies are not only
rare bur also very diverse, in terms of sample characteristics
(e.g., comorbidities, trauma histories, medication status),
methods (e.g., functional or structural magnetic resonance im-
aging, electroencephalography), designs (e.g., symptom prov-
ocation tasks, resting state), and analyses (e.g., seed-based
region of interest analysis, functional connectivity analysis),
which hinders a straightforward comparison and interpretation
of findings.

Previous studies used functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing (fMRI) during symptom provocation tasks or during rest-
ing state to investigate brain activity in BPD patients with high
dissociation. Findings of these studies most consistently point-
ed to increased activity in frontal areas (inferior and middle
frontal gyrus, superior frontal regions) and reduced activation
in temporal areas (inferior and superior temporal gyrus) dur-
ing symptom provocation and rest. Some studies also found
lower activity in the amygdala during presentation of aversive

pictures in patients who reported higher dissociation.
However, findings are diverse and some studies did not find
significant links between altered task-related or resting-state
brain activity and dissociation (for a more detailed description
see [3] and Table 1).

To our knowledge, so far, only three neuroimaging studies
in BPD investigated the effect of experimentally induced
acute dissociation on neural processing, using a script-driven
imagery paradigm [66, 75, 112]. In this paradigm, patients
create a narrative of a personal situation in which dissociative
experiences occurred. During the experiment, patients listen to
this script to recall the autobiographical situation, while be-
havioral, neuropsychological, psychophysiological, and/or
neural reactivity are measured and compared to patients who
listen to an emotionally neutral script. Across three different
studies, this experimental paradigm led to a significant in-
crease in self-reported dissociation [66, 75, 112]. Patients
who listened to a dissociation script also reported lower pain
sensitivity [112], confirming earlier findings [47]. Two of
these studies combined script-driven imagery with neuropsy-
chological tasks measuring emotional interference inhibition,
i.e., the Emotional Stroop Task (EST) and the Emotional
Working Memory Task (EWMT). During the EST, patients
who had been exposed to a dissociation script showed im-
paired task performance (overall slower and less accurate re-
sponses), impaired interference inhibition for negative versus
neutral words, and altered activity in regions implicated in
interference inhibition (fusiform gyrus, left inferior frontal gy-
rus, parietal cortices) [75]. More recently, Krause-Utz et al.
(2018) [66] combined script-driven imagery with an EWMT.
Patients who listened to a dissociation script later showed
impairments in working memory after distraction by social
information (pictures of interpersonal violence versus neutral
interpersonal scenes) and in distractor-free trials [66]. On the
neural level, patients with acute dissociation showed increased
activity in the inferior frontal gyrus, which is consistent with
the other two script-driven imagery studies [75, 112]. In addi-
tion, patients who performed the EWMT after listening to the
dissociation script showed reduced amygdala activity and re-
duced left cuneus, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate ac-
tivity [66].

The complexity of dissociative symptoms and the broad
range of functions that they affect render it unlikely that
effects can be traced down to a few localized brain regions.
Several studies used functional connectivity analysis to
investigate dynamic interactions between brain regions
within large-scale brain networks. During rest, trait disso-
ciation (DES) predicted stronger resting-state functional
connectivity (RSFC) of the amygdala with the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, and reduced RSFC with occipital fusi-
form areas in BPD [113]. In another study [114], acute
dissociation was linked to a stronger coupling of the amyg-
dala with the insula, ACC, and thalamus during the

presentation of aversive distractors. In another study, dis-
sociation increased after scanning, but these changes did
not predict changes in amygdala RSFC after an emotion
regulation task [115]. Differences in sample characteristics
(e.g., medicated [115] versus un-medicated [113]) may
partly contribute to these discrepancies.

A recent study by Popkirov and colleagues (2019) [116(cid:129)(cid:129)]
used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate frontal
electroencephalographic asymmetry (an indicator of emotion
regulation) and its link to somatoform dissociation (conver-
sion symptoms, as assessed by the German version of the
DES). Patients with BPD and healthy controls were exposed
to highly aversive pictures mixed with neutral pictures. Both
groups showed a significant shift from left- to right-sided
asymmetry during the experiment, which suggests effortful
emotion regulation. Interestingly, frontal electroencephalo-
graphic asymmetry at baseline was significantly correlated
to childhood trauma severity and dissociative tendencies
(DES) in the BPD group. In the context of earlier neuroimag-
ing findings, these results provide preliminary evidence for a
link between dissociation (conversion symptoms) and emo-
tion regulation. However, more studies are needed to replicate
these findings before firm conclusions can be drawn.

In a similar vein, only a few BPD studies investigated as-
sociations between dissociation and altered brain structure.
Two studies found preliminary evidence for larger volumes
of the right precuneus and left postcentral gyrus [117] and
larger gray matter volumes in the middle and superior tempo-
ral gyrus [118]. More research is needed to understand if dis-
sociation is associated with altered brain structure in BPD.

So far, the most consistent findings seem to be an increase
in frontal activity (e.g., in inferior frontal gyrus, superior
frontal regions) and reduced activation in temporal areas (in-
ferior and superior temporal gyrus). Altered activity in the
inferior and middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal regions
was also observed in D-PTSD [97], DID [99, 119], conver-
sion disorder [120], and depersonalization [86]. The
abovementioned recent systematic review by Lotfinia and
colleagues [4(cid:129)(cid:129)] suggests that alterations in these frontal
and temporal may be a transdiagnostic neurobiological
marker of dissociation. The systematic review by Roydeva
and Reinders [5(cid:129)(cid:129)] also found evidence for functional alter-
ations in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
bilateral superior frontal regions, (anterior) cingulate, poste-
rior association areas, and basal ganglia across different psy-
chiatric groups. Whether certain alterations (e.g., reduced
amygdala activity) may be specific to acute stress-related
dissociation in BPD is an open research question that needs
to be investigated in future studies, comparing patients with
BPD to other clinical groups with dissociation. A more spe-
cific assessment of dissociation and a careful assessment of
potentially confounding variables (e.g., trauma history) may
be a helpful step in this direction.

Other Recent Research on Dissociation in BPD

Since research on dissociation in BPD is scarce, we broadened
the scope of our current review, including studies that used
other experimental approaches (psychophysiological mea-
sures, pain processing, body perception) to study dissociation.
While these studies deviate from the main focus of our previ-
ous review (neuroimaging studies) [3], they might offer im-
portant input for future neuroimaging research on dissociation
in BPD. Studies that met the abovementioned search terms in
relevant databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Science Direct, Web
of Science) are summarized in Table 1.

Psychophysiological Studies

Several neurobiological models propose that altered neural
activity during dissociation is accompanied by psychophysi-
ological changes in heart rate (variability), skin conductance
response (SCR)/electrodermal activity, blood pressure, and
fear-potentiated startle response. The aforementioned
corticolimbic-disconnection model [86] proposes that in-
creased prefrontal modulation of amygdala activity is associ-
ated with dampened autonomic arousal, which may show in
reduced startle response [73, 121]. The defense cascade model
by Schauer and Elbert (2010) [23] proposes a sequence of fear
responses that escalate as a function of proximity of threat.
More specifically, after an initial increase in sympathetic ac-
tivation, the organism is assumed to respond with a
parasympathetically dominated “shutdown” once the threat
becomes too close and unpreventable (i.e., possibilities of de-
fense or escape are not available or fruitless). Increased para-
sympathetic activity during dissociation has also been linked
to a drop in heart rate [17, 121]. Across psychiatric groups
with dissociative features, findings of psychophysiological
studies were mixed and too diverse to identify potential
neurofunctional biomarkers of pathological dissociation [5(cid:129)(cid:129)].
In BPD specifically, previous studies found reduced startle
response while listening to startling tones [73] and stressful
scripts [122]. It has been proposed that low autonomic arousal
may reflect an interfering effect of dissociation on emotional
processing in BPD [123]. Patients with BPD who reported
high acute dissociation also showed diminished SCR during
a fear conditioning paradigm [74] and stressful scripts [122].
More recently, Bichescu-Burian and colleagues (2017)
[124(cid:129)(cid:129)] used the abovementioned script-driven imagery para-
digm to investigate psychophysiological responses to recall of
traumatic events. Heart rate and skin conductance responses
(SCR) in BPD patients who had experienced high levels of
peritraumatic dissociation were compared to BPD patients
with low PD and healthy controls. Patients with high PD
showed a significant heart rate decline during the imagery of
personal traumatic events compared to the two other groups,
while no differences in SCR were found. Increases in trauma-

evoked heart rate were predicted by peritraumatic dissociation
but not by measures of state or trait dissociation. However,
sample sizes were quite small, patients had a history of child-
hood trauma, and some patients met criteria for PTSD or dis-
sociative disorder (see Table 1).

In another study by Krause-Utz and colleagues [125(cid:129)(cid:129)], high-
frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV, i.e., a marker of stress
regulation) was investigated during an emotion regulation task in
female BPD patients with versus without comorbid PTSD and
healthy women. Participants were instructed to either attend or
downregulate emotional responses to neutral, positive, and neg-
ative images. Compared with the other groups, BPD patients
with comorbid PTSD showed significantly lower HF-HRV over-
all. Acute dissociation before the task positively predicted HF-
HRV during downregulating versus attending negative pictures
in this group. In this study, patients also reported a history of
childhood trauma, and some patients met criteria for PTSD. The
link between baseline dissociation and HF-HRV during down-
regulating emotions was limited to the group with comorbid
PTSD, which questions the specificity of findings for BPD.

Interestingly, a study by Koenig and colleagues [126(cid:129)(cid:129)]
suggests that dissociation is associated with altered physiolog-
ical orienting responses to startling sounds in female adoles-
cents (13–19 years) with BPD. Relative habituation of heart
rate to acoustic startle probes (sinus tones) was significantly
positively correlated with dissociation as well as BPD symp-
tom severity. These findings suggest that dissociative experi-
ences may influence automatic defensive responses early on
in the course of BPD [126(cid:129)(cid:129)].

More research with control groups (clinical groups with dis-
sociative features as well as traumatized individuals who did not
develop a disorder) is needed to understand whether certain psy-
chophysiological alterations may be specific to acute dissociation
and to BPD. At this point, the number of studies comparing
distinct disorders is way too low to draw firm conclusions. The
use of specific dissociation measurements (e.g., peritraumatic
reactions and acute dissociation as opposed to trait dissociation)
may help to improve this understanding.

Dissociation and Pain Processing

Individuals with BPD show reduced pain perception (higher
pain thresholds) compared to healthy control groups, which
correlates with emotional distress [127] and dissociation [47,
112]. Reducing acute states of emotional distress and dissoci-
ation is one of the most prevalent motives for NSSI in patients
with BPD [45, 46].

To investigate if the link between dissociation and reduced
pain processing is related to acute presentations of BPD,
Chung and colleagues [128(cid:129)(cid:129)] assessed heat pain thresholds
and dissociation ratings in participants with acute BPD, those
in remission, and healthy controls. During the abovemen-
tioned script-driven imagery paradigm, participants were

37    Page 12 of 17

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

exposed to either a personalized stressful script or a neutral
script (autobiographical narrative). When exposed to the
stressful script, patients with acute BPD and those in remis-
sion showed enhanced dissociation along with pain
hyposensitivity (higher heat pain thresholds). However, a sig-
nificant association between dissociation and hyposensitivity
to pain (analgesia) was only observed in patients with acute
BPD, not in those in remission.

In another study by Defrin and colleagues [129], no signif-
icant correlation between elevated heat pain thresholds and a
measure of trait dissociation (DES) was found in patients with
acute BPD. On the other hand, higher trait dissociation (scores
on the DES) predicted changes in the default mode network in
response to painful heat stimulation in BPD patients with cur-
rent self-injurious behavior [130]. This suggests that frequent
dissociative experiences may be associated with changes in
brain regions that underlie processing of pain, e.g., as being
less self-relevant or aversive. Future studies may investigate
whether alterations in pain processing (e.g., analgesia) are
specific to acute dissociative states, as compared to trait dis-
sociation in acute BPD [47, 112, 130].

Dissociation and Body Ownership

A new avenue of research concerns experiences of body owner-
ship, i.e., the certainty that certain body parts belong to oneself.
Alterations in body ownership may contribute to symptoms of
depersonalization and somatoform dissociation. Providing first
evidence for this idea, a study by Löffler and colleagues
[131(cid:129)(cid:129)] found a significant link between reduced body ownership
and higher dissociation when controlling for other BPD core
symptoms. In this study, patients with acute BPD experienced
lower body ownership than healthy controls, while not differing
from those with remitted BPD. Future neurobiological studies
may elucidate if reduced body ownership is linked to neurobio-
logical alterations during acute dissociation in BPD and if this is
especially the case for those who experienced child sexual abuse
[51, 55, 56]. This interesting new research avenue may open up
new targets for future research and treatment.

Conclusion

The aim of this article was to provide an overview of current
experimental neurobiological research on dissociation in
BPD. Building on our previous review [3], we focused on
neuroimaging studies published in 2017 or later. Since exper-
imental research on dissociation in BPD is scarce, we also
included psychophysiological and pain processing studies,
as well as a study investigating the link between dissociation
and body ownership, which were revealed by our literature
search in relevant databases.

So far, only a few studies have used experimental para-
digms to investigate the impact of dissociation on information
processing in BPD [3]. Even fewer studies have directly in-
vestigated the impact of acute (i.e., experimentally induced)
dissociative states on neural processing. Findings are quite
diverse and need to be replicated and should therefore be
considered as preliminary. Methodological differences in the
measurement of dissociation (e.g., state versus trait dissocia-
tion) and analytical techniques complicate the interpretation
and comparison of findings. Up to now, it is not entirely un-
derstood whether neurobiological changes are relatively stable
and linked to general dissociative tendencies, or temporary
(i.e., only occurring during acute dissociation).

Moreover, future studies should address the question
whether neurobiological changes during dissociation depend
on the underlying psychiatric diagnosis, or whether they are
transdiagnostic in nature. Functional magnetic resonance im-
aging studies in BPD found links between dissociative states/
traits and altered brain activity in frontal and temporal (limbic-
related) regions during symptom provocation tasks and during
rest. While altered activity in frontal regions (e.g.,
dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior fron-
tal regions, anterior cingulate) may be trans-diagnostically
linked to dissociation (see previous reviews [4(cid:129)(cid:129), 5(cid:129)(cid:129)]), re-
duced amygdala activity may be specific to BPD, which needs
to be elucidated in future research.

To investigate the disorder-specificity of findings, which is
still an open research question, studies need to include distinct
psychiatric (control) groups, as the presence of certain comorbid
diagnoses may hinder a straightforward interpretation of find-
ings. At the same time, rigor inclusion-/exclusion criteria hamper
recruitment, and studies with larger sample sizes as well as meta-
analyses of larger data sets are strongly needed to extend and
replicate previous findings with sufficient statistical power.
Shared etiologies (e.g., trauma history) should be taken into ac-
count [132], e.g., by including control groups of participants that
experienced trauma without developing psychiatric disorders.
Careful screening for childhood trauma, symptom severity, and
comorbidities may help to improve the understanding of trauma-
and non-trauma-related pathways to dissociation.

With respect to BPD, most studies used aversive stimuli to
investigate the impact of dissociation on emotional processing,
while dissociation may also interfere with the processing and
memory of positive stimuli [66]. Previous studies observed dif-
ficulties detecting and memorizing positive social signals and
events [57, 62, 63], and discriminating between social inclusion
and exclusion [57, 59], which may contribute to difficulties in
establishing trust. If dissociation has detrimental effects on pro-
cessing and memory for both for positive and negative emotions,
this may partly explain why acute dissociative symptoms can
contribute to poor therapy outcome in patients with BPD [70].
Future neuroimaging studies may investigate dissociation in the
context of core symptoms other than emotion dysregulation, such

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2021) 23: 37

Page 13 of 17     37

as impulsive and risky decision-making [43] and interpersonal
functioning. Shifting the focus to the investigation of interperson-
al processes (e.g., trust and face processing) may help to gain
more insight into how dissociation may affect interpersonal func-
tioning in BPD.

Increasing knowledge on possible neurobiological markers of
dissociation can be an important step in the development and
improvement of existing therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic
approaches [4(cid:129)(cid:129), 133]. Individual differences may exist regarding
the (psychobiological) markers that predicts treatment outcome
[106], and the inclusion of dissociation measures may help to
improve this understanding. A combination of multiple measures
(e.g., neuroimaging, psychophysiological, self-report), different
analytical techniques across different experimental settings, and
the inclusion of clinical control groups may be helpful steps in
this direction. Thereby, future studies may also investigate if
clinical interventions aimed at reducing dissociation are associat-
ed with a normalization of functional brain alterations.
