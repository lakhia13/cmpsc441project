Abstract

Objective: The objective of this article is a description of the longitudinal
communication curriculum in the Model Medicine Curriculum (MSM)
at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The authors describe the plan-
ning and integration of the curriculum into the study program, outline
how communicative competence is taught and evaluated in the MSM,
and identify which challenges need to be mastered in the process.
Project description: Starting with the introduction of the MSM in 2010,
students have been spending 102 class hours, spread out over seven
semesters, practicing social and communicative competences in the
interactive small group format “Communication, Interaction & Teamwork
(KIT)”. The course contents are closely linked to the topics covered each
semester and increase in complexity over the course of their studies.
The contents are selected by the KIT planning group whose members
continually check the curriculum’s timeliness and determine any
changes. Students as well as instructors have opportunities for evalu-
ating KIT throughout, and their evaluations are taken into consideration
as KIT continues to be updated. Instructors from different disciplines
teach KIT courses. They participate in mandatory didactic trainings that
prepare them to teach KIT. During their 4th and 9th semesters, respect-
ively, students take summative exams that test their communicative
competence.
Results: According to the semester evaluations by students and instruct-
ors, students participating in KIT improved their conversation manage-
ment skills (students: M=2.2, SD=1.1, instructors: M=1.9, SD=0.7, on
a scale of 1-5). In addition, students and graduates rate KIT to be (very)
relevant, consider the degree to which it is taught in the MSM to be
(very) high, and consider KIT to be a meaningful part of the curriculum.
Students taking the summative exams in their 4th and 9th semesters
achieve a mean score of 75.9%, respectively 76.9%, in the purely
communicative stations and 82.6%, respectively 83.3%, in the global
evaluation of communicative competence in clinical-practical stations.
Discussion: Survey and exam results alike indicate that the communic-
ation training is well accepted by students and instructors and that the
training led to an improvement in general and specific communicative
skills.
Due to a lack of control groups or a pre-post design, it has thus far not
been possible to unequivocally demonstrate a causal relationship
between communicative competence trainings and good test results.
Quality control measures, such as trainings for instructors and regular
course evaluations, have been designed to address any challenges in
the implementation of the communication curriculum at the faculty
level.
Conclusion: Building on the experience with the Charité’s Reformed
Medical Curriculum, a longitudinal, competence-based communication
curriculum was integrated into the MSM’s overall curriculum. This
measure remedied a gap in the medical training that many graduates
of regular study programs had previously bemoaned (Jansen 2010 [1]).

1. Introduction

For medical staff, communicative and social competen-
cies represent a basic qualification that should already
be developed during their study course [2].
At the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, a longterm
communication curriculum was integrated as part of the
Reformed Medical Curriculum (RSM) of 1999. Building
on the work of the Reformed Medical Curriculum Working
Group and using the so-called model clause (§ 41) of the
German licensing regulations for physicians as a founda-
tion, the RSM was implemented in 1999 [3] and existed
alongside the Traditional Curriculum until 2010. In the
RSM, students’ communicative and social competence
were being cultivated through the frequent hands-on use
of the small group format “interaction”, which includes
conversations with simulated patients, respectively sim-
ulated participants (SPs) [4]. Students acquired and
strengthened general and specific communicative and
social skills by participating in progressive learning exer-
cises as part of the longitudinal curriculum [5]. The re-
spective course content was closely interwoven with
other classes and was covered on the summative exams.
Exam results revealed the effectiveness of the “interac-
tion” format as it led to a growth in communicative com-
petence even if that growth did not develop evenly across
all semesters [6].
When funding for the RSM was about to expire, a decision
was made to blend the RSM with the regular course of
study. Starting with the 2010/2011 winter semester,
Charité would offer the Model Medicine Curriculum (MSM)
as its only study program in medicine. The newly formed
study program showed a continuity of certain principles
and elements of the Reformed Medical Curriculum. They
included the curriculum structure in the form of interdis-
ciplinary modules, a strong focus on competence, prac-
tice-oriented exam formats (Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE)), and patient contact from an early
phase of the study program.
However, the differences between RSM and MSM, includ-
ing content changes in the modules, fewer class hours
dedicated to practicing communicative and social com-
petences, and a tenfold increase in students rendered
adjustments and a new design of the “interaction” format
unavoidable. The new class format was named “Commu-
nication, Interaction, Teamwork” (KIT).
This article focuses on the ways in which more than 600
newly enrolled students each year are taught communic-
ative and social skills as part of a longitudinal strategy,
how they acquire these skills, and how their skills are
being evaluated. The article outlines how students and
instructors evaluate the curriculum and how the students
perform on their communicative competence exams. The
article also focuses on the challenges in the implement-
ation and quality control of the curriculum and on the
measures that Charité has developed to meet those
challenges.

2. Project description

2.1. Framework and structure

The KIT course consists of 102 class hours distributed
over 32 class meetings. Classes are scheduled during
seven of the ten semesters of the medical study program,
and meet every two or four weeks, all in all four or six
times per semester.
This course schedule represents the kind of longitudinal
communication curriculum recommended by research
[7] while allowing close interdisciplinary connections to
the content of other courses (see attachment 1). The
study program consists of 40 interdisciplinary modules
that teach knowledge and clinical-practical skills in lec-
tures, seminars, and practical training sessions. Students
subsequently practice communicative competence relev-
ant to these contents in KIT. Students apply and build on
the clinical-practical and communication skills they have
developed in course settings like physical examination
courses, clinical electives, and internship blocks. Having
participated in those courses, students then reflect on
their experiences with KIT to foster the development of
their professional identities.

2.2. Didactics

Classes are held in small groups of nine students and
one instructor. Since the same instructor teaches all units
during any given semester, the instructor can guide group
processes and strengthen cohesion among the group
members. Instructors hold graduate degrees in medicine,
psychology, social sciences or the humanities, and work
in various Charité departments.
The small group size allows instructors to teach in an in-
teractive manner. At the same time, learning objectives
and course contents are highly standardized, and instruct-
ors follow manuals to teach. The manuals contain an
overview of learning objectives, a short description of the
respective communication model to be discussed, a
course schedule, comprehensive guidelines for group
discussions, role play and group activities, as well as
suggestions for relevant online materials and films.
The majority of class time is dedicated to practical exer-
cises [8]. Simulated consultations with SP and structured
feedback take place in 21 of 32 class meetings. The pool
of SPs contains approximately 140 persons between the
ages of 18 and 80. Prior to their performances, SPs are
taught how to present their characters and how to offer
feedback. The goal of this strong hands-on training is to
teach students how to recognize elements of good con-
versation management and how to practice these ele-
ments themselves. For example, students analyze videos
of doctor-patient interactions and practice these skills in
hands-on exercises (role plays with or without SPs) [2].

2.3. Human resources

A research associate in the Office of the Vice Dean of
Research for Teaching and Learning was tasked with
developing the KIT curriculum and class schedule. The
curriculum is not guided by the interests of individual
disciplines or subject areas. Rather, the research associ-
ate founded an interdisciplinary group (“KIT Planning
Group”) that serves as a kind of scientific advisory board
and includes representatives from medical psychology,
medical sociology, education, general medicine, the
simulated patient program, and the student body.

2.4. Learning objectives and contents

The process of developing and implementing the cur-
riculum occurs based on an approach by Kern [9]: The
learning objectives closely follow the Basel consensus
statement and were developed by the KIT planning group
[10]. The national competence-based catalogue of
learning objectives (NKLM) [http://www.nklm.de] did not
exist when KIT was first developed. However, a comparis-
on with chapter 14c (Managing Doctor Patient Conversa-
tions) of the NKLM shows that the competence skills
(level 1) agree 100%, and that the individual competence
skills (level 2) agree 72%. All learning objectives refer to
the theoretical models on which they are based (see at-
tachment 1). The contents and teaching methods are
organized in an increasingly complex and challenging
fashion regarding the patient’s personality, medical con-
dition, and the required communication skills.

2.5. Exam formats

Students’ communicative competence is evaluated via
OSCE after the 4th and the 9th semesters, respectively.
The OSCE stations test clinical-practical skills as well as
communicative competence. Communication skills make
up 30% of the overall evaluation and are measured using
the Berlin Global Rating Scale (BGR) [11]. Each of the
two OSCE contains one station that exclusively assesses
communication skills. Literature-based checklists [12]
are used to evaluate these stations. Exam results are is-
sued in the form of grades between 0 and 100%, with
60% as the threshold for a passing grade. The SPs do not
provide any feedback on the students’ exams.

2.6. Quality control

Several measures are taken to ensure quality control and
quality development. They are described below.

2.6.1. Instructor trainings

Two mandatory trainings for instructors represent an im-
the
portant parameter for ensuring quality control:
foundational training “Working with simulated parti-
cipants” and a semester-specific, in-depth training. The
foundational training [13] comprises ten course units

and contains information about the KIT curriculum, the
use of SPs, and group dynamics, as well as methods for
small group work. Several mock classroom sessions with
subsequent reflection form a core part of the training.
The specific trainings of five course units each correspond
to the respective topics covered during a specific
semester. Using the manuals, participants discuss course
units, SP cases and methods, and enact some of them.
Participants can only obtain the qualification of “qualified
instructor” and become KIT instructors once they have
successfully completed the two trainings. Instructors have
opportunities to participate in additional, optional train-
ings, such as, shadowing experienced instructors, receiv-
ing didactic feedback, or participating in topic-specific
trainings.
Training evaluations show that participants are consist-
ently very pleased with the trainings: From 2012 to 2017,
368 participants evaluated the foundational training and
subsequently agreed that they were able to facilitate KIT
sessions (M=1.7, SD=0.6) and to prepare and evaluate
SP conversations (M=1.4, SD=0.6; on a scale where
1=completely agree and 5=do not agree). Multiple reports
based on the shadowing of 60 instructors indicate that
at least 75% of the instructors met two thirds of the
quality standards for KIT instruction [14].

2.6.2. Contents and SP cases

The KIT Planning Group decides on any necessary cur-
riculum changes owed to societal developments and
medical progress. For example, the topics “Interprofes-
sional Collaboration” and “Digitalization in Medicine”
were added to the curriculum.

2.6.3. Possibilities for evaluating learning

Different kinds of feedback by instructors and students
serve to continually optimize the curriculum, SP cases,
and course materials:
At the end of each semester, students and instructors
evaluate the KIT teaching format. Starting with the winter
semester 2015/2016, a global item was added that asks
to what extent the students’ conversation management
skills had improved thanks to KIT. Additionally, during the
winter semester 2017/2018, all students were asked to
participate in a survey that measured their satisfaction
with the study program. A survey for graduates was
offered during the summer 2018 semester. In both sur-
veys, participants were asked to rate the relevance of
communication skills and the extent to which these skills
were taught as part of the study program in medicine at
Charité. Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2020 the
group representing the student body (FSI) conducted a
survey of all medical students at Charité. The survey
contained an item that asked students to state to what
extent KIT, alongside other learning formats, represents
a meaningful part of the MSM curriculum.

In addition to verbal feedback or feedback via e-mail,
students can share anonymous feedback on courses via
Charité’s Teaching Incident Reporting System (TIRS).
Members of Charité’s FSI and the student representatives
of the modules serve as contact persons for student
matters and share those in KIT. For example, based on
students’ requests, additional training materials for Mo-
tivational Interviewing (MI) were created [15] and were
made available to the students.

3. Results

The results of the evaluations show how students and
instructors evaluate the contents of KIT as part of their
studies and whether the extent to which they are taught
corresponds to the meaning that the students assign to
them. Students’ actual performances can be measured
via their objectively graded exams.

3.1. Evaluation and survey results

The results of the student and instructor surveys outline
in 2.6.3 are described below.

3.1.1. Semester evaluations

Student and instructor evaluations conducted between
the winter semester 2015/16 and the summer semester
2019 were evaluated for this study. Return rates ranged
from 4.7% to 47.1% among the students (with a mean
value of 34.7%) and from 14.7% to 85.7% among the
instructors (with a mean value of 54.9%). For an item
asking participants whether KIT led to improved conver-
sation management skills (using a five-point-scale where
1=completely agree and 5=completely disagree), student
responses showed a mean value of 2.2 (SD=1.1) and
instructor responses showed a mean value of 1.9
(SD=0.7).

3.1.2. Survey of graduates and study program
satisfaction survey

33% of the graduates (n=139) participated in the survey
conducted in 2018, 35% of the students (n=1047) parti-
cipated in the study satisfaction survey administered
during the 2017/18 winter semester. Students from all
semesters participated equally in the survey (from 6% to
13% per respective semester), with the exception of stu-
dents in semesters 12 and 13 (0.8% and 0.1%, respect-
ively). The survey results are depicted in figure 1 and fig-
ure 2, below. They indicate that students consider the
contents to be very important, and that they perceive
communicative competence to play a large role in their
study program.

3.1.3. FSI survey

The survey was administered to students in semesters
2-10 and in their clinical internship year (PJ). 824 individu-

als participated (return rate: 19.2%). The majority of sur-
vey takers stated that KIT is a meaningful part of their
study program (see figure 3).

3.2. Exam results

During the summer 2013 semester, motivational inter-
viewing was introduced as a KIT exam station in the 4th
semester OSCE. Ever since then, students have achieved
a mean score of 75.7% (SD=16.7, n=3578, see figure
4). This tendency corresponds to the achievements in
other stations that foreground clinical skills (78.4%,
SD=6.7). Ever since the 2019 summer semester, deliver-
ing bad news using the SPIKES model has been examined
as a KIT exam station in the 9th semester OSCE. Students
achieved a mean score of 76.9% in that station (SD=14.5,
n=542, see figure 5). The mean score of all other exam
stations employed in the 9th semester OSCE is 79.7%
(SD=7.7).
The BGR is used to determine the overall communicative
competence. Since 2013, the mean percentage achieved
for the 4th semester OSCE has been 82.6% (SD=7.6).
Since the winter semester 2014/15, when it was first
implemented in the 9th semester OSCE, the mean per-
centage achieved has been 83.3% (SD=6.3).

4. Discussion

4.1. Evaluation

that

The overwhelming majority of graduates who completed
the study program satisfaction survey considers commu-
nicative competence an important if not very important
aspect of medical practice. Other studies in German-
speaking countries [16] also reveal a rather positive atti-
tude among students toward communication skills and
suggest
trainings can
communication skills
strengthen students’ positive attitudes as well as reduce
negative attitudes toward acquiring communicative
competence [17].
While graduates of regular study programs have judged
the degree to which communication skills are taught as
too low [1], MSM students judged the degree to be very
high, respectively, high. These findings suggest that in
comparison to the regular study program, the MSM meets
the students’ needs for comprehensive training in com-
munication skills.
In surveys that are conducted each semester, students
and instructors report that the students’ conversation
management skills have improved due to KIT. Hence, the
training results in actually perceived learning effects.
On a cautionary note, one needs to acknowledge that the
items in all the surveys are phrased in a rather general
manner, and that one cannot use them to infer any in-
formation about specific aspects of KIT. Furthermore,
since some of the return rates are rather low one cannot
exclude the possibility that respondents tended to have
a more positive bias toward the program whereas those

survey.

4.4. Quality control

4.2. Exams

The students’ exam results indicate that the students
possess good general as well as specific communication
skills. An evaluation of the BGR, however, shows that
rather than using the full spectrum of the grading scale,
examiners tend to only use the upper spectrum of the
scale. This can suggest a tendency to grade rather leni-
ently. The exam results that test specific communication
skills shows that most students are well able to conduct
a conversation applying MI or SPIKES principles. In order
to document that test results are a clear indication of
KIT’s success one would have to test students before
and after their participation in KIT or offer tests to a con-
trol group of students. Neither measure has been imple-
mented thus far.

4.3. Integrating the communication curriculum

Partly due to the fact that KIT is offered in seven out of
ten semesters of study, it was possible to comprehens-
ively integrate KIT’s contents into the overall curriculum.
This is rare compared to other medical school curricula
in German-speaking countries that usually focus on in-
struction during the second or third year of study [18].
KIT’s integration into the overall curriculum comes with
a cost: For example, in order to create connections to
other courses, 4th semester students are already taught
MI although MI is a rather challenging concept to compre-
hend at this early stage of one’s studies. Similarly, there
are some limitations in always keeping the curriculum up
to date. While the topic “Digitalization in Medicine” could
be integrated into the curriculum, only a small portion of
the medical students have opportunities to study the
topic “Interprofessional Collaboration” along with students
of different professional study programs. Due to legal and
organizational reasons, this topic is mostly taught in
mono-professional groups.

Program managers strive for a high degree in standardiz-
ation regarding course content and course quality. How-
ever, instructors work in different departments at Charité
and, depending on their respective field, differ in their
previous experience with small group work and commu-
nication skills trainings. Moreover, there exists a high
level of fluctuation among instructors. Instructor manuals
have been produced to address these issues, and 100%
of instructors self-reported in their evaluations that they
used the manuals when preparing for class. In addition,
all instructors are obliged to participate in mandatory
trainings. However, the following question remains un-
answered: Why do student evaluations of instructors’
teaching skills differ so widely? It is possible that while
trainings provide the didactic skills needed for teaching,
but that the trainings alone do not compensate for differ-
ences in prior knowledge or teaching skills.
Thanks to surveys as well as anonymous feedback sys-
tems one can identify the needs of students and instruct-
ors as the so-called “end consumers”. These measures
allow one to quickly respond to problems and to continu-
ally improve the curriculum.

4.5. Faculty development

To date, no systematic studies exist that reveal to what
extent the students’ participation in the communication
training at Charité has led to better communication in
healthcare. However, student evaluations and individual
case reports suggest that it has done so.
Developing a longitudinal communication curriculum
consisting of 102 learning units has de facto increased
the significance of developing this competence. However,
we do not have any results yet that show to what extent
faculty recognize the relevance of this training. Individual
case reports of instructors who have completed the MSM
suggest that they consider the communication training
to be an indispensable part of the study program.

5. Conclusions

As part of introducing the MSM at Charité, the longitudinal
and competence-based communications curriculum, KIT,
was integrated into the overall curriculum. To this end,
having central office for coordination and further devel-
opment, as well as a panel of experts without any monet-
ary or discipline-specific dependencies proved to be es-
sential. Compulsory trainings for instructors as well as
standardized course manuals and course materials signi-
ficantly contribute to quality control. Students’ and in-
structors’ evaluations of KIT are positive, and exams
testing communicative competences document positive
results throughout.
The development of the communication curriculum at
Charité and the implemented quality measures aim to
show students and instructors that acquiring communic-
ative and social competence is not merely an optional
additional qualification, but rather, a necessary basic
qualification for working in the medical profession [19].

Zusammenfassung

Zielsetzung: Ziel dieses Beitrags ist die Darstellung des longitudinalen
Kommunikationscurriculums im Modellstudiengang Medizin (MSM) der
Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Dabei werden die Planung und Inte-
gration dieses Curriculums in den Studiengang beschrieben, die Lehre
und Prüfung der kommunikativen Kompetenzen im MSM und welche
Herausforderungen dabei zu meistern sind.
Projektbeschreibung: Seit der Einführung des MSM im Jahr 2010 trai-
nieren die Studierenden in 102 Unterrichtsstunden, verteilt über sieben
Semester, soziale und kommunikative Kompetenzen in dem interaktiven
Interaktion & Teamarbeit
Kleingruppenunterricht „Kommunikation,
(KIT)“. Die Inhalte dieses Unterrichts sind eng verknüpft mit den Themen
des jeweiligen Semesters und nehmen in ihrer Komplexität im Verlauf
des Studiums zu. Ausgewählt wurden die Inhalte von der Planungsgrup-
pe KIT, die auch fortwährend die Aktualität des Curriculums prüft und
Änderungen beschließt. Für Studierende als auch Lehrende stehen
mehrere Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung, KIT zu evaluieren, die ebenfalls
in die Überarbeitung miteinfließen. Dozierende aus verschiedenen
Fachrichtungen leiten die KIT-Kurse und werden in verpflichtenden di-
daktischen Schulungen auf diese Aufgabe vorbereitet. Im 4., sowie im
9. Semester erfolgt eine summative Prüfung der kommunikativen
Kompetenzen.
Ergebnisse: Laut der Semesterevaluationen geben Studierende und
Lehrende an, dass die Studierenden in KIT ihre Gesprächsführungskom-
petenzen verbessern konnten (Studierende: M=2.2, SD=1.1, Lehrende:
M=1.9, SD=0.7, Skala 1-5). Außerdem bewerten Studierende bzw. Ab-
solvent*innen KIT als (sehr) relevant, sehen das Ausmaß seiner Vermitt-
lung im MSM als (sehr) hoch an und KIT als sinnvollen Bestandteil des
Curriculums.
In den Prüfungen des 4. und 9. Semesters erreichten die Studierenden
im Mittel 75.9% bzw. 76.9% in den rein kommunikativen Stationen und
82.6% bzw. 83.3% im Mittel in der globalen Bewertung der kommuni-
kativen Kompetenzen in klinisch-praktischen Stationen.
Diskussion: Die Evaluations- und Prüfungsergebnisse weisen darauf
hin, dass das Kommunikationstraining von Studierenden und Dozieren-
den gut angenommen wird und eine Verbesserung allgemeiner und
spezifischer kommunikativer Kompetenzen erreicht wurde.
Ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Training kommunikativer
Kompetenzen und den guten Prüfungsergebnissen konnte durch feh-
lende Prä-Post-Untersuchungen oder nicht umsetzbare Vergleiche mit
Kontrollgruppen bisher nicht eindeutig nachgewiesen werden. Fakul-
tätsinternen Herausforderungen bei der Durchführung des Kommuni-
kationscurriculums, wie z.B. einem sehr großen und heterogenen Pool
an Dozierenden, wird mit Qualitätssicherungsmaßnahmen wie Dozie-
rendenschulungen und regelmäßigen Unterrichtsevaluationen begegnet.
Schlussfolgerung: Aufbauend auf den Erfahrungen im Reformstudien-
gang der Charité wurde mit Einführung des Modellstudiengangs ein
längsschnittliches, kompetenzbasiertes Kommunikationscurriculum in
das Gesamtcurriculum integriert. Dadurch konnte ein Ausbildungsdefizit,
das von vielen Absolvent*innen von Regelstudiengängen beklagt wurde
(Jansen 2010 [1]), behoben werden.

1. Einleitung

Für medizinisch Tätige stellen kommunikative und soziale
Kompetenzen eine Basisqualifikation dar, mit deren
Ausbildung bereits im Studium begonnen werden sollte
[2].
An der Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin wurde ein
longitudinales Kommunikationscurriculum im Zuge des
1999 eingeführten Reformstudienganges (RSM) integriert.
Auf Basis der Arbeiten der Arbeitsgruppe Reformstudien-
gang konnte 1999 auf Grundlage der sogenannten Mo-
dellklausel (§ 41) der ärztlichen Approbationsordnung
der RSM gestartet [3] und bis 2010 parallel zum Regel-
studiengang durchgeführt werden. Im RSM wurden die
kommunikativen und sozialen Kompetenzen der Studie-
renden in dem Kleingruppenformat „Interaktion“ durch
viel praktisches Üben – einschließlich Gesprächen mit
Simulationspatient*innen bzw. Simulationspersonen (SP)
– trainiert [4]. Allgemeine und spezifische kommunikative
und soziale Kompetenzen wurden in Form von Lernspira-
len in dem longitudinalen Curriculum erworben und ge-
festigt [5]. Die einzelnen Unterrichtsinhalte waren eng
mit anderen Lehrveranstaltungen verknüpft und Bestand-
teil summativer Prüfungen. Die Prüfungsergebnisse
zeigten die Effektivität des Formats “Interaktion“ im Sinne
eines Zuwachses der kommunikativen Kompetenzen,
wenn auch nicht über alle Semester hinweg gleich stark
[6].
Mit dem Auslaufen der Fördergelder für den RSM wurde
entschieden, diesen mit dem Regelstudiengang zusam-
menzuführen und ab dem WS 2010/11 den Modellstu-
diengang Medizin (MSM) als einzigen Studiengang Hu-
manmedizin an der Charité anzubieten. Bei dieser Zusam-
menführung wurden bestimmte Prinzipien und Elemente
des Reformstudiengangs fortgeführt: Die Curriculumss-
truktur in Form von fächerübergreifenden Modulen, eine
ausgeprägte Kompetenzorientierung, praxisorientierte
Prüfungsformate (Objective Structured Clinical Examina-
tion (OSCE)) und früher Patient*innenkontakt.
Die Unterschiede zwischen RSM und MSM, wie z.B. ver-
änderte Modulinhalte, weniger Unterrichtsstunden für
das Training kommunikativer und sozialer Kompetenzen
sowie eine 10fach höhere Studierendenzahl, machten
jedoch Anpassungen und eine Neukonzeptionierung des
Formats „Interaktion“ unumgänglich. Die Veranstaltung
wurde in „Kommunikation, Interaktion, Teamarbeit“ (KIT)
umbenannt.
Der Fokus dieses Beitrags liegt darauf, wie im modular
strukturierten und integrierten MSM mit mehr als 600
neu immatrikulierten Studierenden pro Jahr kommunika-
tive und soziale Kompetenzen längsschnittlich gelehrt,
gelernt und geprüft werden. Dabei wird gezeigt, wie dieses

Curriculum von Studierenden und Dozierenden bewertet
wird und welche Ergebnisse die Studierenden in den
Prüfungen ihrer kommunikativen Kompetenzen erreichen.
Die Herausforderungen bei der Durchführung und Quali-
tätssicherung des Curriculums sowie die Maßnahmen,
mit denen diesen an der Charité begegnet wird, bilden
einen weiteren Schwerpunkt.

2. Projektbeschreibung

2.1. Rahmenbedingungen und Struktur

Die Lehrveranstaltung KIT besteht aus 102 Unterrichts-
stunden verteilt auf 32 Unterrichtstermine. In sieben von
insgesamt zehn Semestern findet der Unterricht statt,
mit jeweils vier oder sechs Unterrichtsterminen pro Se-
mester. Die Abstände zwischen den Terminen betragen
zwei oder vier Wochen.
Diese Anordnung der Unterrichtstermine ermöglicht zum
einen ein längsschnittliches Kommunikationscurriculum,
wie es in Studien empfohlen wird [7] zum anderen einen
engen querschnittlichen Bezug zu den Inhalten anderer
Lehrveranstaltungen (siehe Anhang 1). Das Studium be-
steht aus 40 fächerübergreifenden Modulen. In diesen
werden zunächst Wissensinhalte und klinisch-praktische
Fertigkeiten in Vorlesungen, Seminaren und praktischen
Übungen vermittelt. Kommunikative Kompetenzen, die
in Zusammenhang mit diesen Inhalten stehen, werden
anschließend in KIT trainiert. In Lehrveranstaltungen wie
Untersuchungskursen, Famulaturen und Blockpraktika
wenden die Studierenden die erworbenen klinisch-prak-
tischen und kommunikativen Kompetenzen an und ver-
tiefen diese. Die Studierenden reflektieren die gemachten
Erfahrungen anschließend wiederum in KIT, um die Aus-
bildung der professionellen Identität zu fördern.

2.2. Didaktik

Der Unterricht wird in Kleingruppen à 9 Studierenden
und einem/einer Dozierenden durchgeführt. Da eine
Person alle Termine des jeweiligen Semesters unterrich-
tet, kann sie auf gruppendynamische Prozesse einwirken
und die Gruppenkohäsion stärken. Die Dozierenden ver-
fügen über ein abgeschlossenes Studium der Humanme-
dizin, Psychologie, einer Geistes- oder Sozialwissenschaft
und kommen aus unterschiedlichen Einrichtungen der
Charité.
Die Gruppengröße ermöglicht eine interaktive Gestaltung
des Unterrichts. Zugleich ist der Unterricht durch die
Vorgabe von Lernzielen und Unterrichtsinhalten hoch
standardisiert und die Dozierenden unterrichten anhand
von Manualen. Diese enthalten für jeden Unterrichtster-
min eine Lernzielübersicht, eine knappe Darstellung des

GMS Journal for Medical Education 2021, Vol. 38(3), ISSN 2366-5017

zu besprechenden Kommunikationsmodells, einen Ab-
laufplan, umfangreiche Anleitungen für Gruppendiskus-
sionen, Rollenspiele und Gruppenübungen sowie Hinwei-
se zu Online-Materialien und Filmen.
Mehr als die Hälfte der Unterrichtszeit wird für praktische
Übungen genutzt [8]. In 21 der 32 Unterrichtstermine
werden SP-Gespräche mit strukturiertem Feedback ein-
gesetzt. Etwa 140 Personen von 18 bis über 80 Jahren
befinden sich im Pool des SP-Programms. Die SP werden
entsprechend vor ihrem Einsatz in Rollendarstellung und
Feedbackgeben trainiert. Zielsetzung dieses sehr prakti-
schen Unterrichts ist es, dass die Studierenden lernen,
gute ärztliche Gesprächsführung (z.B. durch Analyse von
Arzt-Patienten-Gesprächen auf Video) zu erkennen und
durch praktisches Handeln (Rollenspiele mit/ohne SP)
zu erlernen [2].

2.3. Personelle Ressourcen

Die Entwicklung des Kommunikationscurriculums und
die Konzeption der Unterrichtstermine wurden einem
wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter aus dem Prodekanat für
Studium und Lehre übertragen, wodurch das Curriculum
nicht durch das Interesse einzelner Fachdisziplinen be-
stimmt wird. Dieser Mitarbeiter gründete, als eine Art
wissenschaftlichen Beirat, eine interdisziplinäre Gruppe
(„Planungsgruppe KIT“) mit Vertreter*innen der Medizini-
schen Psychologie, Medizinischen Soziologie, Pädagogik,
Allgemeinmedizin, des SP-Programms und der Studieren-
den.

2.4. Lernziele und Inhalte

Der Prozess der Entwicklung und Implementierung des
Curriculums erfolgte nach dem Ansatz von Kern [9]: Die
Lernziele wurden in enger Anlehnung an das Basler
Consensus-Statement von der Planungsgruppe KIT for-
muliert [10]. Der Nationale Kompetenzbasierte Lernziel-
katalog (NKLM) [http://www.nklm.de] lag bei der Planung
noch nicht vor. Ein Abgleich mit Kapitel 14c (Ärztliche
Gesprächsführung) des NKLM ergab allerdings, dass die
Kompetenzen (Ebene 1) zu 100% und die Teilkompeten-
zen (Ebene 2) zu 72% übereinstimmen. Alle Lernziele
beziehen sich auf zugrundeliegende theoretische Modelle
(vgl. Anhang 1). Die Inhalte und Lehrmethoden sind so
angeordnet, dass sie zunehmend komplexer und heraus-
fordernder werden hinsichtlich der Patientenpersönlich-
keit, der Erkrankung und der zu übenden Kommunikati-
onsfertigkeiten.

2.5. Prüfformate

Die kommunikativen Kompetenzen der Studierenden
werden im Rahmen von summativen OSCEs nach dem
4. und 9. Semester geprüft. In den OSCE-Stationen wer-
den sowohl klinisch-praktische Fertigkeiten als auch
kommunikative Kompetenzen geprüft. Die kommunikati-
ven Kompetenzen gehen dabei zu 30% in die Wertung
ein und werden mit der Berlin Global Rating Scale (BGR)

[11] erfasst. In beiden OSCE ist ebenfalls eine Station
integriert, die ausschließlich kommunikative Kompeten-
zen prüft. Die Bewertung dieser Stationen erfolgt durch
literaturbasierte Checklisten [12]. Das Prüfungsergebnis
wird – bei einer Bestehensgrenze von 60% – als Score
von 0-100% ausgegeben. Die SP geben kein Feedback
zur Prüfungsleistung der Studierenden.

2.6. Qualitätssicherung

Zur Qualitätssicherung und -entwicklung werden Maßnah-
men in verschiedenen Bereichen ergriffen. Diese sind im
Folgenden dargestellt.

2.6.1. Dozierendenschulungen

Eine wichtige Stellschraube zur Qualitätssicherung sind
zwei verpflichtende Schulungen für die Dozierenden: Das
Basistraining „Arbeiten mit SP“ und eine semesterspezi-
fische Vertiefungsschulung. Das Basistraining [13] um-
fasst 10 Unterrichtseinheiten (UE) und beinhaltet Infor-
mationen zum KIT-Curriculum, zum Einsatz von SP, zu
gruppendynamischen Prozessen und Methoden für
Kleingruppen. Zentraler Bestandteil sind außerdem
mehrere Unterrichtssimulationen mit anschließender
Reflexion. Die semesterspezifischen Schulungen à 5 UE
sind auf die Inhalte eines Semesters abgestimmt: Auf
Basis der Manuale werden die Unterrichtseinheiten, SP-
Fälle und Methoden besprochen und zum Teil ausprobiert.
Erst nach Durchlaufen beider Schulungen erhalten die
Dozierenden den Status „qualifizierte*r Dozierende*r“
und können als Lehrende für KIT-Kurse tätig werden.
Neben diesen verpflichtenden Schulungen gibt es fakul-
tative Angebote, wie z.B. Hospitationen bei erfahrenen
Dozierenden, didaktische Beratungen oder themenspezi-
fische Schulungen.
In den Evaluationen dieser Schulungen zeigen sich die
Teilnehmenden durchgehend sehr zufrieden: Im Zeitraum
von 2012 bis 2017 evaluierten 368 Personen das Basi-
strainingstraining und stimmten danach den Aussagen
zu, KIT-Sitzungen moderieren (M=1.7, SD=0.6) und SP-
Gespräche vor- und nachbereiten zu können (M=1.4,
SD=0.6; Skala 1=stimme voll zu bis 5=stimme nicht zu).
Im Rahmen mehrerer Qualifizierungsarbeiten auf Basis
von Hospitationen bei 60 Lehrenden wurde festgestellt,
dass zwei Drittel der vermittelten Qualitätsstandards für
den KIT-Unterricht von mind. 75% der Dozierenden einge-
halten wurden [14].

2.6.2. Inhalte und SP-Fälle

Notwendige Curriculumsänderungen aufgrund gesell-
schaftspolitischer Entwicklungen und medizinischen
Fortschritts werden in der KIT-Planungsgruppe diskutiert
und beschlossen. So wurden die Themen „Interprofessio-
nelle Zusammenarbeit“ und „Digitalisierung in der Medi-
zin“ in den Unterricht aufgenommen.

Mittel) und 14.7% und 85.7% bei den Lehrenden (54.9%
im Mittel). Auf einer Skala von 1 (stimme voll zu) bis 5
(stimmt überhaupt nicht zu) ergab sich bei der Frage nach
der Verbesserung der Gesprächsführungskompetenzen
durch KIT ein Mittelwert von 2.2 (SD=1.1) unter den
Studierenden und von 1.9 (SD=0.7) unter den Lehrenden.

3.1.2. Absolvent*innen- &
Studienzufriedenheitsbefragung

An der 2018 durchgeführten Absolvent*innenbefragung
beteiligten sich 33% der Absolvent*innen (N=139), an
der Studienzufriedenheitsbefragung des Wintersemester
2017/18 35% der Studierenden (N=1047). Die Gesamt-
zahl der Teilnehmenden setzt sich zu etwa gleich großen
Anteilen aus allen Semestern zusammen (je 6-13% pro
Semester) mit Ausnahme der Semester 12 und 13 (0.8%
und 0,1%). Die Ergebnisse der Befragungen werden in
den Abbildung 1 und Abbildung 2 dargestellt und zeigen
aus Studierendensicht eine große Relevanz der Inhalte
und ein als hoch eingeschätztes Ausmaß der Vermittlung.

3.1.3. Umfrage der FSI

Befragt wurden Studierende der Semester 2-10 und des
Praktischen Jahrs, teilgenommen haben 824 Studierende
(Rücklaufquote: 19.2%). Die Mehrheit gab an, dass KIT
ein sinnvoller Bestandteil des Studiengangs ist (siehe
Abbildung 3).

3.2. Prüfungsergebnisse

Im Sommersemester 2013 wurde MI als KIT-Prüfungssta-
tion im OSCE des 4. Semesters eingeführt. Die Studieren-
den erreichten über alle seither vergangenen Semester
einen mittleren Score von 75.7% (SD=16.7, N=3578,
siehe Abbildung 4). Dies entspricht tendenziell den Leis-
tungen in den anderen Stationen, in denen klinische
Fertigkeiten im Vordergrund stehen (78.4%, SD=6.7).
Seit dem Sommersemester 2019 wird als KIT-Prüfungs-
station im OSCE des 9. Semesters das Überbringen
schlechter Nachrichten unter Anwendung des SPIKES-
Modells geprüft. Die Studierenden haben seit Einführung
der Station im Mittel mit 76.9% abgeschnitten (SD=14.5,
N=542, siehe Abbildung 5). Der Mittelwert über alle an-
deren im OSCE des 9. Semesters eingesetzten Stationen
liegt bei 79.7% (SD=7.7).
Zur Erfassung der allgemeinen kommunikativen Kompe-
tenzen wird die BGR eingesetzt. Die mittlere erreichte
Leistung im OSCE des 4. Semesters liegt hier ab 2013
bei 82.6% (SD=7.6) und im 9. Semester seit Einführung
im Wintersemester 2014/15 bei 83.3% (SD=6.3).

2.6.3. Möglichkeiten zur Evaluation

Unterschiedliche Rückmeldungen von Dozierenden und
Studierenden dienen der stetigen Optimierung des Curri-
culums, der SP-Rollen und Unterrichtsmaterialien:
Das Lehrformat KIT wird jeweils am Semesterende von
Studierenden und Lehrenden evaluiert. Diese Evaluation
beinhaltet seit dem Wintersemester 2015/16 ein globales
Item dazu, inwieweit sich die Gesprächsführungskompe-
tenz der Studierenden durch KIT verbessert hat. Außer-
dem wurde im Wintersemester 2017/18 eine Studienzu-
friedenheitsbefragung bei allen Studierenden und im
Sommersemester 2018 eine Absolvent*innenbefragung
durchgeführt. In diesen beiden Befragungen schätzten
die Befragten die Relevanz kommunikativer Kompetenzen
und das Ausmaß ihrer Vermittlung im Medizinstudium an
der Charité ein. Darüber hinaus wurde von der Fach-
schaftsinitiative (FSI) im ersten Quartal 2020 eine Umfra-
ge bei allen Medizinstudierenden der Charité durchge-
führt. Sie beinhaltet ein Item, welches erfragt, inwieweit
KIT neben anderen Lehrformaten ein sinnvoller Bestand-
teil des MSM-Curriculums ist.
Neben der mündlichen Rückmeldung oder Kontaktauf-
nahme per E-Mail können zusätzlich Meldungen über ein
an der Charité implementiertes Fehlermeldesystem für
Unterrichtsveranstaltungen (Teaching Incident Reporting
System (TIRS)) anonym verfasst werden.
Ebenso fungieren die Mitglieder der FSI der Charité und
die studentischen Modulverantwortlichen als Ansprech-
partner*innen für die Anliegen der Studierenden und
bringen diese im KIT-Bereich vor. So wurden beispielswei-
se auf Wunsch von Studierenden mehr Übungsmaterialien
zur Motivierenden Gesprächsführung (MI) [15] erstellt
und als Material zur Verfügung gestellt.

3. Ergebnisse

Anhand der Evaluationsergebnissen kann gezeigt werden,
welche Bedeutung Studierende und Dozierende den In-
halten von KIT im Studium beimessen und, ob das Aus-
maß, in dem diese vermittelt werden, der eingeschätzten
Bedeutung entspricht. Durch die dargestellten Prüfungs-
ergebnisse kann die objektiv bewertete Performanz der
Studierenden aufgezeigt werden.

3.1. Ergebnisse von Evaluationen und
Befragungen

Die Ergebnisse der unter 2.6.3 genannten Befragungen
von Studierenden und Dozierenden werden im Folgenden
dargestellt.

3.1.1. Semesterevaluation

Ausgewertet wurden die Evaluationen der Studierenden
und Lehrenden vom Wintersemester 2015/16 bis zum
Sommersemester 2019. Die Rücklaufquoten lagen zwi-
schen 4.7% und 47.1% bei den Studierenden (34.7% im

4. Diskussion

4.1. Evaluation

In der Absolvent*innen- und der Studienzufriedenheits-
befragung bewertete die überwiegende Mehrheit kommu-
nikative Kompetenzen als wichtigen bis sehr wichtigen
Inhalt ärztlicher Tätigkeit. Eine eher positive Einstellung
gegenüber kommunikativen Kompetenzen zeigt sich auch
in anderen Studien im deutschsprachigen Raum [16],
ebenso wie der Hinweis darauf, dass Kommunikations-
kurse positive Einstellungen der Studierenden bzgl. des
Erlernens kommunikativer Kompetenzen verstärken und
negative abmildern können [17].
Während das Ausmaß der Vermittlung dieser Kompeten-
zen von Absolvent*innen von Regelstudiengängen noch
als zu gering eingeschätzt wurde [1], bewerteten MSM-
Studierende das Ausmaß als sehr hoch bzw. hoch. Dies
weist daraufhin, dass der MSM im Gegensatz zum Regel-
studiengang den Bedürfnissen der Studierenden nach
einer umfassenden kommunikativen Ausbildung gerecht
wird.
In der semesterweise durchgeführten Befragung wird von
Studierenden und Dozierenden angegeben, dass sich
durch KIT die Gesprächsführungskompetenz der Studie-
renden verbessert hat. Damit zeigt das Training tatsäch-
lich wahrgenommene Lerneffekte.
Limitierend bleibt zu erwähnen, dass die Items in allen
Befragungen allgemein formuliert sind und Rückschlüsse
auf konkrete Aspekte von KIT nicht möglich sind. Des
Weiteren sind die Rücklaufquoten in der Semesterevalua-
tion teilweise sehr niedrig und beinhalten die Möglichkeit
eines Bias, bei dem kritische Bewertungen nicht geäußert
wurden.

4.2. Prüfungen

Die Prüfungsergebnisse belegen gute allgemeine und
spezifische kommunikative Kompetenzen der Studieren-
den. Bei der Auswertung der BGR fällt jedoch auf, dass
die Prüfer*innen nicht die volle Breite der Bewertungs-

skala nutzten und fast nur den oberen Bereich nutzten,
was auf eine Tendenz zur Milde hindeuten kann. Die
Prüfungsergebnisse zu den spezifischen kommunikativen
Kompetenzen zeigen, dass für die meisten Studierenden
ein Gespräch nach den Prinzipien von MI oder SPIKES
gut zu bewerkstelligen ist. Um die Prüfungsergebnisse
als einen eindeutigen Beleg für den Erfolg von KIT heran-
zuziehen, wären eine Testung vor und nach der Teilnahme
an KIT oder der Vergleich mit einer Kontrollgruppe nötig.
Beides ist bisher nicht erfolgt.

4.3. Integration des
Kommunikationscurriculums

Es konnte eine umfassende inhaltliche Integration in das
Gesamtcurriculum erreicht werden, nicht zuletzt da KIT
in sieben von zehn Semestern durchgeführt wird. Dies
ist eine Seltenheit im Vergleich zu anderen Medizinstu-
diengängen im deutschsprachigen Raum, in denen der
Schwerpunkt des Unterrichts meist im zweiten oder drit-
ten Studienjahr liegt [18]. Diese erfolgte teilweise jedoch
auf Kosten des Prinzips, dass der Schwierigkeitsgrad des
Kommunikationscurriculums mit den Semestern ansteigt.
So wird z.B. die anspruchsvolle MI bereits im vierten Se-
mester unterrichtet, um eine gute Verknüpfung mit ande-
ren Lehrveranstaltungen zu ermöglichen, obwohl MI zu
diesem frühen Zeitpunkt im Studium sehr herausfordernd
ist. Auch das Beachten der Aktualität des Curriculums ist
nur im Rahmen vorgegebener Grenzen möglich. Während
das Thema „Digitalisierung in der Medizin“ integriert
werden konnte, gelingt es beim Thema „Interprofessionel-
le Zusammenarbeit“ aus rechtlichen und organisatori-
schen Gründen nur für einen kleinen Teil der Medizinstu-
dierenden, tatsächlich auch in interprofessionell zusam-
mengesetzten Gruppen unterrichtet zu werden. Der grö-
ßere Teil wird nach wie vor monoprofessionell unterrich-
tet.

4.4. Qualitätssicherung

Es wird ein hohes Maß an Standardisierung bezüglich
der Unterrichtsinhalte und -qualität angestrebt. Die Dozie-
renden stammen jedoch aus unterschiedlichen Einrich-
tungen der Charité und haben aufgrund ihrer jeweiligen
Fachdisziplin unterschiedliche Vorerfahrung mit Kommu-
nikationstrainings im Kleingruppenformat. Darüber hinaus
besteht eine hohe Fluktuation an Dozierenden. Diesen
Herausforderungen wird zum einen mit der Bereitstellung
von Dozierendenmanualen begegnet, welche laut
Selbstauskunft in der Evaluation von 100% der Dozieren-
den für die Vorbereitung auf den Unterricht genutzt wer-
den. Zum anderen werden verpflichtende Schulungen für
alle Dozierenden durchgeführt. Offen bleibt die Frage,
warum Studierende die Qualität des Unterrichts bei ver-
schiedenen Dozierenden sehr unterschiedlich bewerteten.
Es ist denkbar, dass durch die Schulungen zwar das di-
daktische Rüstzeug für die Unterrichtstätigkeit vermittelt
wird, jedoch die unterschiedlichen Vorkenntnisse und
inhaltlichen Kompetenzen der Dozierenden nicht ausrei-
chend kompensiert werden können.
Die verschiedenen Evaluationsmöglichkeiten, von stan-
dardisierten Befragungen bis hin zu anonymen Rückmel-
desystemen, ermöglichen es, die Bedürfnisse der Studie-
renden und Dozierenden als „Endabnehmer“ zu identifi-
zieren. So kann auf Probleme zeitnah reagiert und das
Curriculum stetig verbessert werden.

und Dozierende evaluieren KIT positiv, auch die Prüfung
der kommunikativen Kompetenzen zeigt durchweg gute
Ergebnisse.
Der Aufbau des Kommunikationscurriculums an der
Charité und die angewandten Qualitätsmaßnahmen zielen
darauf ab, dass Studierende und Dozierende das Training
der kommunikativen und sozialen Kompetenzen nicht
als zusätzliches Unterrichtsangebot auffassen, sondern
als Ausbildung einer notwendigen Basisqualifikation für
ärztliches Handeln [19].

Danksagungen

Wir danken den Kollegin*innen aus dem Team Qualitäts-
sicherung, dem Dieter Scheffner Fachzentrum, sowie den
Studierenden der FSI Berlin für die Bereitstellung von
Daten aus den Befragungen. Außerdem danken wir allen
Studierenden und Lehrenden, die an den Befragungen
teilgenommen und somit einen wichtigen Beitrag zur
Qualitätssicherung geleistet haben.

4.5. Fakultätsentwicklung

Steckbrief

Inwieweit die Kommunikation in der Gesundheitsversor-
gung durch das Kommunikationstraining, das die Studie-
renden durchlaufen haben, verbessert wurde, konnte
bislang noch nicht systematisch erhoben werden. Die
Evaluationen der Studierenden und Lehrenden sowie
Einzelfallberichte weisen jedoch darauf hin.
Durch die Implementierung eines längsschnittlichen
Kommunikationscurriculums mit einem Stundenumfang
von 102 Unterrichtseinheiten wurde der Stellenwert der
Ausbildung dieser Kompetenz de facto erhöht. Es liegen
jedoch keine Befunde dazu vor, inwieweit die Relevanz
dieses Trainings in der Fakultät anerkannt wird. Einzelfall-
berichte von Dozierenden, die den MSM durchlaufen
haben, weisen darauf hin, dass diese das Training als
unverzichtbaren Bestandteil des Studiums erachten.

5. Schlussfolgerungen

Im Zuge der Einführung des MSM an der Charité wurde
das longitudinale und kompetenzbasierte Kommunikati-
onscurriculum KIT in das Gesamtcurriculum integriert.
Dafür erwies sich eine zentrale Stelle zur Koordination
und Weiterentwicklung und ein monetär und von Fachin-
teressen unabhängiges Expert*innengremium als uner-
lässlich. Verpflichtende Schulungen für Dozierende sowie
standardisierte Unterrichtsmanuale und -materialen tra-
gen wesentlich zur Qualitätssicherung bei. Studierende
