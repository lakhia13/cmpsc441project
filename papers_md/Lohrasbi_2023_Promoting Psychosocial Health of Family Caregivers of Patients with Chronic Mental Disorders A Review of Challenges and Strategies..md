The present study aimed to investigate the mental and social health challenges of fam-
ily caregivers of the patients with chronic mental disorders (CMD) and strategies which 
can be helpful in this regard. This study is a narrative review conducted in PubMed, 
Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier, Google Scholar, Proquest, Magiran, and Sid data-
bases where keywords such as Family caregiver, Chronic Mental disorder, Health 
Promotion, Program, Psychosocial, Support, Challenge, and Problem were searched 
in both Persian and English. A total of 5,745 published documents were found and were 
screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 64 studies were found which 
had examined the related challenges, needs and strategies. According to the results, 
information deficits, needs for support, community participation deficits, and psycho-
logical suffering were recognized as challenges of family caregivers of these patients. 
Moreover, empowerments programs for the enhancement of the knowledge and skills 
of caregivers and peer-centered support programs were used to improve the level of 
mental and social health of family caregivers of these patients. Psychosocial problems 
and challenges that family caregivers of the patients with CMD face affect their health, 
satisfaction and quality of life. Using a collaborative approach, mental health service 
providers  and  government  systems  can  help  improve  the  psychosocial  health  of 
caregivers. The related managers and policymakers can reduce the emotional and psy-
chological burden of families and promote their psychosocial health through developing 
a comprehensive program including practical objectives and strategies and taking into 
account the challenges that exist for caregivers in caring for patients with CMD.

INTRODUCTION

Mental health is one of the main components of public 
health in societies. Mental health problems are critically 
increasing in many parts of the world.1 As estimated, about 
19% of the world’s population suffers from at least one of 
the various types of mental disorder as one of the main caus-
es of disability.2

Nowadays, along with advances in psychiatric services, 
the treatment of patients with chronic mental disorders 

(CMD) has changed and the care places have been relocated 
from medical centers and hospitals to homes. The assump-
tion is that if patients with CMD are treated and cared for 
in society and family, their disease will be less likely to re-
cur and they might be given the opportunity to return to 
work  and  personal  activities.  Following  this  policy,  the 
number of patients with CMD who are cared at home has 
increased significantly,3 making families the main support 
system in the ongoing care of such patients.1 As a hidden 
healthcare  system,  family  care  is  located  alongside  the 
health system and has become an institution where pa-

Promoting Psychosocial Health of Family Caregivers of Patients with Chronic Ment

tients with mental disorder live.4 Therefore, family care is 
known as the most important source of support in the care, 
symptom  management  and  treatment  process  of  these 
patients.5,6 Accordingly, CMD in any members of a family 
will lead to psychological, social and responsibility burdens 
not only for the patient, but also for all family members,7 
which will start from the very onset of the disease and con-
tinue throughout life.4 This requires a tireless effort that 
irrefutably impacts the lives of these caregivers.8

After the onset and diagnosis of the disease, family care-
givers come to know that they alone are not able to deal with 
the disease and the various related duties considered for 
them, and hardly can confront the prevailing attitudes in 
society about mental diseases. However, it should be noted 
that family care efforts are rarely defined nor recognized.9 
These caregivers experience a great deal of care-related 
burdens, negative emotions, and difficulty in coping with 
such issues. Thus, their ability to cope with and adapt to 
these conditions is impaired, which is a significant threat 
to their own mental and social health, affecting their life 
in general.1,3 Because of these reasons, families need help 
at different stages of the disease.10

Moreover, it is often observed that the main focus of the 
healthcare team is on the needs and treatment of patients 
not the needs and health of family caregivers. Accordingly, 
family members of patients with CMD are referred to as 
“second-order patients.” Despite carrying numerous psy-
chological and social burdens, these caregivers lack ad-
equate support resources and readiness to care for their 
patients.3 Given the significance of family members as key 
caregivers of patients with CMD, lack of attention to their 
mental and social health can lower their quality of life,5 
leading to the recurrence of the patient’s mental illness and 
the formation of a vicious cycle in this regard.11 When care-
givers feel that they are receiving adequate support from 
professional caregivers in the process of caring for their pa-
tients, they accept their role more hopefully and optimisti-
cally  which  in  turn  will  reduce  the  risks  of  caring  the 
burden.12 As such, families of patients with CMD, as the 
hidden healthcare system and a significant part of the men-
tal health system, need to be supported properly.13 Thus, 
the present review aimed to investigate the social and men-
tal health challenges of family caregivers of patients with 
chronic mental disorders and strategies which can be help-
ful in this regard.

METHODOLOGY 

This narrative review was conducted in 2021 with the 
aim of recognizing the challenges and strategies for the pro-
motion of the mental and social health of the family care-
givers of patients with CMD. Studies were reviewed using 
keywords such as Family caregiver, Chronic Mental dis-
order (schizophrenia OR Bipolar mood disorder OR BMD 
OR Depression OR Manic), Health Promotion, Program, 
Psychosocial,  Support,  Challenge,  and  Problem.  These 
keywords were searched in the databases of PubMed, Web 

32

of  Science,  Scopus,  Elsevier,  Google  Scholar,  ProQuest, 
Magiran, and Sid in both Persian and English languages 
and using “AND” and “OR” operators. A total number of 
5,745 published documents were found and were screened 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria 
were studies examining the problems and needs of family 
caregivers of patients with CMD, studies published from 
2000 to 2021, published in English or Persian only, avail-
able  in  full  text,  and  quantitative  and  qualitative, 
cross-sectional, descriptive, and review studies. Studies 
such as letters to editor, protocol studies and studies whose 
primary focus was on patients, not their caregivers, were 
excluded from the study. After reviewing the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, the titles of the studies were reviewed 
and the unrelated ones were removed. Then, the abstract 
of the articles was studied and if an article was consistent 
with the aim of the study, its full text was retrieved and used 
in this study. Finally, we found 64 articles that examined 
the  challenges  and  needs  or  provided  solutions  in  this 
regard.

Using  the  previously  mentioned  keywords,  5,745  ar-
ticles were found. Out of these articles, 319 articles were 
duplicate,  291  were  published  before  2000,  35  were  in 
non-English languages, 21 other articles were excluded be-
cause of lack of access to their full texts, and 5,015 articles 
dealt with other issues. 

Of the 64 articles included in the study, 45 studies exam-
ined the psychosocial problems and needs of the family 
caregivers with CMD (Table 1) and 19 studies dealt with 
interventions for the promotion of the psychosocial health 
of these caregivers (Table 2). After completing the review 
process, the data were obtained as codes of the topics re-
lated to the aim of the study and were qualitatively catego-
rized by the members of the research team to find the main 
categories (Table 3). 

PSYCHOSOCIAL CHALLENGES OF CAREGIVERS

1. Information Deficit 

One of the most important challenges the family care-
givers of the patients with CMD encounter is the lack of in-
formation about the nature of the disease. The eed to be in-
formed about mental disorders,1,14-20 need to be familiar 
with the behavior of patients,15,21,22 getting adequate in-
formation  about  the  symptoms  and  course  of  the  dis-
ease15,17,20,21 and treatment methods,18,21 conditions of the 
diseases, conditions of severity and recurrence of the dis-
ease and methods of preventing this recurrence,20 recog-
nition of early warning signs of the disease,9,22,23 the need 
to obtain information about the limitations caused by the 
disease in the individual, social and professional life of pa-
tients, being aware of the patient’s physical health,23 the 
ways of managing the symptoms of the disease16,18,21,23-25 
and communicating with the patient in a way that can pre-
vent  conflict  between  the  patient  and  caregiver16,17,26,27 
were among the issues mentioned by the family caregivers.
Medication used by these patients is another concern of

ment process.

The  experience  of  asking  for  help  causes  feelings  of  fear  and  shame. 

Decreased quality of life and high psychosocial burden

Mental shock and emotional burden; lack of disease knowledge and care
skills; poor treatment compliance of the patient; difficulty in coping with
the patient; conflict in the family or at work; financial burden; And they 
need adequate social support

Caregivers reported unmet educational needs. The most important educa-
tional needs of caregivers: stress management methods, knowledge of
psychiatric drugs, early warning signs of the disease, side effects of drugs,
improvement of social relationships,concentration problems

The most important needs of caregivers are the need for training on how
to manage the disease, managing the patient’s social and professional
problems, training on rehabilitation, recognizing the disease, and man-
aging the patient’s marital problems.

Qualitative

Themes of needs and problems:

1. Burden of care:

• Financial burdens and daily household chores
• Limited social connections
• Psychological stress (prejudice and discrimination of others/self-stig-
ma/feeling insecure/parents worried about the patient’s future after
their own death)

2. Support

• Financial support: health insurance and free medicines
• Medical support: medical resources available at the community level
• Informational and educational support

3. Future needs:

• More financial support: free medicines and health insurance coverage
• Respect: Families are subject to discrimination
• Rehabilitation  institutions:  Establishment  of  rehabilitation  insti-

tutions with reasonable prices for patients
Suggestions for policy and service development:

• Further expansion of health insurance coverage for mental illnesses.
• Entrepreneurship and financial support for these patients
• Free drugs, hospitalization, and rehabilitation at a low cost
• The government should provide more resources to specialized psychi-

atric institutions

• Support, care, and training of caregivers
• Caregivers are considered active members of the healthcare team and

should be intervened in the treatment decision-making process.

Review

Counseling needs of families include how to manage the patient’s anger,
drug management, drug side effects, communication with the patient,
information about the disease and symptoms, where to turn to when they
need help, and when to seek help.

Many  activities  of  caregivers  include  helping  the  patient  to  perform 
self-care activities, anger management, substance abuse, risky sexual 
behaviors. Awareness about the disease, how to manage the patient’s ag-
gression, how to convince the patient to accept the treatment. Failure to
provide training by the medical team. Lack of follow-up after discharge,
lack of medicine, insufficient insurance coverage, lack of hospital beds.

Effects of intervention in the family:
Positive impact on the treatment of patients, reduction of relapse and 
re-hospitalization, positive experiences for caregivers, improvement of 
self-efficacy and social support in caregivers.

Implementation barriers of interventions: expenditure of money, time 
and energy for caregivers, lack of preparation of therapists, structural

Experience of sadness, guilt, anxiety in caregivers. In danger of physical
and mental health of caregivers, low self-esteem, use of avoidant coping
strategies, critical and controlling families.

Appropriate  interventions  include  psychoeducation,  problem-solving 

strategies, and peer support.

The basis of effective intervention is education.

Feeling of shame, guilt, humiliation,and stigma for caregivers, and care-
givers who experience this issue bear more burden of care and the treat-
ment prognosis for the patient decreases.

Social support for families is an important source of coping and a factor 

to reduce the burden of care.

Information needs (information about mental illness, medications, avail-
able services, and disease management). Emotional support (talking to
relatives).

The match between family needs and receiving support from the health
system was poor: feelings of blame from health professionals, receiving

the mentally ill at home exposes the patients and their families to emo-

• Disruption in family relationships.
• Life skills of patients.

Recommendations to reduce care burden: Creating entertainment, in-
surance support, creating employment for the patient, counseling serv-
ices and treatment facilities for the family.

Qualitative

Concealment (unsupportive social network, blame for the cause of the ill-

ness, shame of the patient)

Restrictions (decrease in family members’ visits with friends and rela-

tives, academic and job problems in family members)

The genetic nature of the disease (labeling patients’ families as carriers

of psychiatric disease)

The traditional attitude of society (beliefs based on the weakness and in-

capacity of psychiatric patients)

Burden (burden caused by hiding the disease and keeping the patient re-

sponsible)

Gender difference (intensification of the effects of stigma caused by being 
a girl, reducing the chance of marriage for women who have a sick relative)
Loss of personal life (disruption of the normal order of life, cannot have

a normal retirement)

Mixed feelings (stigma, sadness, and confusion, worry about the patient’s
future, fear of patients’ tendency to violent behavior towards themselves
and others, self-blame and guilt, emotional strength and tenacity, feeling
of value and success when the patient recovers, job satisfaction when 
which other family members thank)

Changes in family relationships (caregivers regarding the distribution of
duties, treatment, expenses, economic crises that can lead to the deterio-
ration of marital relations and divorce)

Need professional support, guidance, and help
Adaptation strategies (spiritual beliefs, strengthening communication, 

reducing expectations, seeking help, positive attitude).

the families. A need to get informed about correct medi-
cation,14,17  side  effects  of  drugs  and  how  to  deal  with 
them,17,18,20 emergency drugs and sedatives14 and the need 
to  adhere  to  medication  regimens  and  follow-up  treat-
ments23 are among the challenges which should be man-
aged by the families of these patients. 

Based on the results of some of these studies, when dis-
charging mental health patients from medical centers to 
the families of these patients, there is a need to have some 
information about post-discharge care and how to prevent 
re-hospitalization,23 complications and risks of not adher-
ing  to  the  treatment  process,  rehabilitation  of  the  pa-
tients,15 management of emergency situations such as sui-
cide, aggression and anger of the patient and how to encour-
age their patients to cooperate in the treatment process.23

be supported to promote the psychological and social health 
of caregivers. 

3. Community participation deficit

Having a patient can greatly impact the social relation-
ships of family caregivers. Distance from family members, 
friends and acquaintances,15,27,32,33 educational and occu-
pational problems among family members,20,34 disruption 
of leisure and recreation,21 imbalance between one’s job 
and patient care, social stigma,16,17,31,35 negative attitudes, 
discrimination and prejudice,15 isolation of both caregivers 
and patients23,24,36 and conflict over disease disclosure37 are 
among the social challenges for these caregivers. As such, 
there is a need to improve communication with relatives, 
community members and the treatment team.22-24 

2. Need to support 

4. Psychological suffering

The lack of government support and healthcare support 
are among other problems the family caregivers of the pa-
tients with CMD encounter. Given the chronicity of the dis-
ease and the lifelong use of drugs, the families of these pa-
tients expected to be financially supported by the govern-
ment to buy their drugs or the drugs should be provided to 
them  for  free.1,15,20,25,28  Further  expansion  of  health  in-
surance coverage,21,26 establishment and increase of re-
habilitation centers and institutional care institutions,28,29 
low-cost hospitalization and rehabilitation,14,30 provision 
of more resources to specialized psychiatric institutions 
and providing these patients with good jobs and financial 
support24 are among the problems that these families ex-
pect to be solved by the government. 

Moreover, support of the mental healthcare team to pay 
more attention to the educational needs of caregivers,15,21,31 
improvement  of  communication  skills  in  mental  health 
professionals,24 and increased participation of caregivers 
in care-related decision-makings15,18,24 are other needs of 
family caregivers that should be considered. 

Additionally,  the  increased  workload  imposed  by  nu-
merous care roles, as well as the lack of understanding that 
the care duty are heavy burdens on the shoulders of the 
family while they may be receiving no assistance or support 
from relatives and acquaintances,16,21,31 being left alone in 
medical expenses or financial crises imposed on the family 
because of the unemployment of the caregiver or the pa-
tient,15,31 and the lack of coordination and agreement of the 
family on care-related issues7 suggest that families should

STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE PSYCHOSOCIAL 
HEALTH OF CAREGIVERS

1. Empowerment program

Psychosocial  empowerment  programs  are  known  as 
health promotion methods for family caregivers of patients 
with CMD. These programs can improve caregivers’ knowl-
edge of the disease nature, illness management and treat-
ment methods, and develop the skills, known as “life skills”, 
in family caregivers.

42

Conducting  a  psychosocial  program  based  on  infor-
mation and emotional support, Hajisadeghian et al. argued 
that the implementation of this kind of program could re-
duce perceived stress in family caregivers of patients with 
CMD.41 In the study of Abedi et al., the implementation of 
planned behavior problem-solving improved the adapta-
tion  style  in  family  caregivers  of  these  patients.42,79 
Gerkensmeyer et al. also indicated that problem-solving 
intervention improved depression, burden, and personal 
control in the family caregivers of patients with CMD.43,80 
The program based on the education of communication 
skills and reduction of violence in the families of patients 
with schizophrenia has been able to significantly decrease 
the expressed emotions and improve family empowerment 
and hope in families.44 Implementation of programs based 
on the provision of information to caregivers can improve 
the relationship between the caregiver and the patient and 
help reduce the expressed emotions.45 

In review of the studies, psycho-educational programs 
were used as the most important methods for improving the 
level of the caregivers’ knowledge and skills. Researchers 
have asserted that these programs can be effective in re-
ducing individual dimensions of stigma, burden of care,46 
and also in promoting family tolerance, caregivers quality 
of life,47 caregivers’ emotional regulation and improvement 
of psychological symptoms.48 

 One of the methods that can increase the knowledge and 
life  skills  of  caregivers  is  virtual  psycho-educational 
programs. These programs can be implemented through 
web-based applications and sites and can be as effective as 
routine care (face-to-face).49 Today, with the availability of 
smart phones and the spread of Covid-19, virtual programs 
have become more popular as they can save more time and 
money for both families and therapists.50

2. Peer support programs

Peer support programs also improve psychosocial health 
in family caregivers of patients with CMD. Peer support 
services  are  new  interventions  that  have  recently  been 
adopted in mental health systems worldwide. A peer is de-
fined as an equal, someone with whom they share demo-
graphic or social similarities and are able receive support, 
empathy,  encouragement,  and  help  from  each  other. 
People with shared experiences can offer support and help 
to each other in a mutual relationship. Peer support in men-
tal health can be defined as “help and support that people 
with experience of caring for a mental illness or disability 
have learned and can pass on these experiences to others”. 
These people are transformed from receiving services to 
providing support.51 Membership in such groups should be 
used as one of the main strategies for caregivers to adapt 
to the burden of caring for a patient with CMD.29 

DISCUSSION 

This narrative review was conducted to identify the psy-
chosocial challenges of the caregivers of patients with CMD 

Fateme Lohrasbi, et al

and  examine  the  evidence  found  in  addressing  these 
challenges. Lack of information about the nature of the dis-
ease,  treatment,  and  methods  of  management  and  re-
habilitation of the patients is one of the most important 
challenges for the families of these patients.52 In fact, be-
cause of inadequate information about CMD, family mem-
bers feel powerless. They, accordingly, fail to provide the 
patient with appropriate support1 and, as they are unsure 
about future events, they are confused and overwhelmed 
by negative emotions.18,24 According to Sharif et al. [2020], 
inadequate  training  of  the  caregivers  in  managing  the 
signs and symptoms of the disease and their lack of knowl-
edge of care have been mentioned as major challenges of 
caregivers.37,54 

Based on another finding of this research, families of 
these patients need to be supported by healthcare centers 
and government. According to some caregivers, specialists 
lack empathy, do not listen to them properly, blame and 
criticize them, and neglect them. Caregivers tended to have 
a closer relationship with physicians and the treatment 
team, and these relationships were mentioned as the most 
stressful factors of their care experience.24 As Sharif et al. 
[2020]  suggested,  the  mental  healthcare  system  is  pro-
fessionally responsible to provide comprehensive care to 
family  caregivers  in  the  form  of  counseling,  supportive 
care, promotion of self-care activities, education of effective 
coping strategies, and health education as well. Support 
services provided by the care team can prevent physical, 
mental and social burnout of caregivers, thereby increas-
ing society’s mental health awareness.37,54 Accordingly, 
having an optimal relationship with mental health pro-
fessionals is one of the biggest challenges for caregivers. In 
Ebrahimi’s  study  [2018],  there  was  no  sufficiently  ad-
equate relationship between mental health professionals 
and families, causing loneliness in caregivers.45,52 The con-
tinued communication of mental health professionals with 
family caregivers provides caregivers with more feelings 
of security and improves their psychosocial health.23

Additionally, society-based interventions, government 
support and rehabilitation for patients with CMD can, as 
an investment, improve the mental health of caregivers.9 
In their study, Chen et al. (2019) offered suggestions re-
garding government policy support for the caregivers of pa-
tients with CMD, including further expansion of health in-
surance coverage for mental illnesses, entrepreneurship 
and financial support for these patients, free medication, 
hospitalization  and  low-cost  rehabilitation  means,  and 
provision of more government resources to specialized psy-
chiatric institutions.15,21

The presence of disruption of the social participation of 
caregivers was another finding of this study. The most im-
portant reason for this challenge is the social stigma to-
ward mental illnesses. Fernandes et al. (2021) believe that 
social stigma is a barrier to the resilience of the family of 
these patients, and it seems that the occurrence and impact 
of these stereotypes cannot be prevented.16,22 In order to 
deal with stigma in society, families often choose isolation 

43

and withdraw themselves from society. They believe that 
they can prevent the disease from being revealed by hiding 
the disease of the family member and delaying the patient’s 
treatment. The inappropriate reaction of society has neg-
atively affected the social interactions of these people and 
has excluded and isolated the family from society, causing 
ultimately an adverse effect on the mental health of the 
family. All families are worried that relatives and acquain-
tances will find out about this disease. The labeling of these 
diseases and the fear of social scandal make them act more 
cautious in their communication and thus suffer a lot of 
mental pressure and stress.37

Among  the  other  problems  of  caregivers  revealed  in 
many studies was the experience of psychological problems 
by  caregivers.  Family  caregivers  experience  different 
types of care-related burdens which can disrupt their psy-
chosocial integration. Psychological burden is the most se-
vere challenge experienced by the family caregivers of the 
patients with CMD. They experience shock, sadness, de-
pression,  fatigue,  helplessness,  and  inability  to  under-
stand the situation.37 

However, support is being provided to address these psy-
chosocial problems experienced by these caregivers. Psy-
chosocial  empowerment  programs  can  significantly  im-
prove or enhance the caregivers’ knowledge and skills so 
that they can manage the care situation and provide appro-
priate care to patients. These intervention programs usu-
ally include emotional release, participation in group work 
programs, cognitive therapies, training, and counseling. 
These  programs  can  also  improve  caregivers’  problem- 
solving skills and quality of life, causing positive results 
such as relieving care-related stress and increasing the re-
laxation of the caregivers of the patients with CMD.41 In 
several studies, the caregivers are empowered through the 
implementation of psycho-educational interventions. Family 
psycho-education assumes that the family members of a 
patient with CMD need information, help and support in 
order to take care of the patient in the best way and cope 
with or adapt to the related challenges. This model com-
bines elements of cognitive therapy, information, behav-
ior,  problem  solving,  communication,  and  counseling, 
thereby reducing anger, confusion, and emotional distress 
for the patient’s family.53 Kumar et al. referred to two cate-
gories of treatment-related information and the nature of 
the  disease,  and  believed  that  psycho-educational  pro-
grams can maintain adherence to treatment and lead to 
better results.20,30 According to Sin and Norman [2013], al-
though psycho-education is consistently effective in im-
proving knowledge and methods of coping, it has a lesser 
effect on changing psychological illnesses, care burdens, 
and expressed excitement. Common components of a psy-
cho-educational program should include adaptation and 
problem-solving  strategies  to  enhance  communication 
skills and improve adaptation. As an evidence-based treat-
ment method, psycho-education provides information about 
illness  and  situation  management.  The  benefits  of  this 
method for family members include increased knowledge, 

44

which usually promotes adaptation, self-efficacy, and so-
cial support in caregivers.54,82 Al-Sawafi [2020] concluded 
that  although  psycho-educational  interventions  lead  to 
positive results for the families of the mental patients, it 
should  be  consistent  with  the  cultural  models  of  each 
country.55,83

Peer support programs include support or services pro-
vided to people with mental health problems by other peo-
ple who have experienced mental health problems them-
selves. Peer support, as a method of promoting recovery for 
family caregivers of patients with CMD, improves self-effi-
cacy and hope through sharing experiential knowledge and 
coping strategies used.56 Additionally, as evidence-based 
intervention, it has been recommended by national and in-
ternational clinical guidelines.55

The implementation of Family-to-Family Support Pro-
grams by Bademli and Duman had a positive effect on cop-
ing strategies and mental health status of the caregivers 
of patients with schizophrenia.57 Studies have revealed the 
benefits of mutual support groups in maintaining the psy-
chological and social well-being of the family caregivers of 
patients with CMD. According to studies, the implemen-
tation of this program can effectively reduce the burden of 
care and increase family performance,58,59 making the fam-
ily provide effective care for the patients with CMD.60 The 
use of this program in 12-month, 24-month61 and 4-year fol-
low-ups increased family performance and led to more so-
cial support for families. As such, using this program is con-
sidered to be an effective psychosocial intervention for re-
ducing the psychosocial problems of these caregivers.62

In the quantitative review of the literature, a good num-
ber of studies have been conducted in the field of family 
caregivers of the patients with chronic mental illnesses. 
There was an sufficient number of articles investigating 
the problems and needs of caregivers of the patients with 
CMD. There was also an attempt in interventional studies 
to empower families by teaching some skills often in the 
form of group psychological training to them. Although the 
programs implemented for the caregivers of the patients 
with  CMD  were  able  to  improve  some  aspects  of  their 
health, the authors of this study did not come across a com-
prehensive program with appropriate strategies and re-
sponses to all problems and psychosocial needs of these 
caregivers.

The results of this study can be utilized in clinical, educa-
tional and management departments. Gaining a deeper in-
sight into the needs and psychosocial problems and using 
methods to improve the psychosocial health of family care-
givers of patients with chronic mental illnesses, mental 
health professionals can try to establish empathetic com-
munication with these caregivers, solve their problems and 
address their questions and uncertainties. Holding pro-
grams such as workshops and training classes for students 
and  members  of  the  mental  health  care  team  can  be 
beneficial. Moreover, given the lack of an appropriate infra-
structure for the implementation of family-oriented serv-
ices for this group of caregivers, the results of this study tes-

tify to the need for transforming the patient-oriented serv-
ices to comprehensive patient- and family-oriented ones. 
Therefore, the managers and  policymakers of  this field 
should take into consideration the required manpower and 
employ  experts  to  implement  these  kinds  of  evidence- 
based programs. 

This study has several limitations. First, as this study 
was a narrative review, it could not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria of articles like a systematic review of 
studies or meta-analysis. As such, it was impossible to re-
view all the articles in this study. Second, this study re-
viewed the articles published only in English or Farsi and, 
thus, we lost the opportunity of reviewing other related 
studies  published  in  other  languages.  Third,  because 
Isfahan University of Medical Sciences does not support ac-
cess to some publications, we did not have access to the full 
text of all articles.

Generally, based on the results of this review, it was 
found that psychosocial problems of the family caregivers 
of patients with chronic mental disorders, including in-
adequate information, need for support, social problems 
and mental health, can affect their health, satisfaction, and 
quality of life. Empowerment of caregivers and peer sup-
port can be good strategies for improving the health of these 
caregivers. Moreover, despite emphasis on the significance 
of psychosocial health, there are still many challenges in 
this regard. For instance, as there are no standard and com-
prehensive guidelines and programs for psychosocial care, 
this  care  is  not  implemented  as  part  of  the  treatment 
process. Therefore, in order to remove barriers and psycho-
social challenges, a need is felt for developing a compre-
hensive program including practical objectives and strat-
egies by taking into account the challenges that exist for 
caregivers in the process of caring for patients with CMD. 
There should be collaboration between health service pro-
viders and government systems in order to resolve the psy-
chosocial challenges of these caregivers.
