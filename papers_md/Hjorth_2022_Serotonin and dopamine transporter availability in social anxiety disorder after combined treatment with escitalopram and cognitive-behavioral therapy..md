Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) are recommended treatments
of social anxiety disorder (SAD), and often combined, but their effects on monoaminergic signaling are not well understood. In this
multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) study, 24 patients with SAD were randomized to treatment with escitalopram
+ICBT or placebo+ICBT under double-blind conditions. Before and after 9 weeks of treatment, patients were examined with
positron emission tomography and the radioligands [11C]DASB and [11C]PE2I, probing the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT)
transporter proteins respectively. Both treatment combinations resulted in signiﬁcant improvement as measured by the Liebowitz
Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). At baseline, SERT-DAT co-expression was high and, in the putamen and thalamus, co-expression
showed positive associations with symptom severity. SERT-DAT co-expression was also predictive of treatment success, but
predictor-outcome associations differed in direction between the treatments. After treatment, average SERT occupancy in the
SSRI + ICBT group was >80%, with positive associations between symptom improvement and occupancy in the nucleus
accumbens, putamen and anterior cingulate cortex. Following placebo+ICBT, SERT binding increased in the raphe nuclei. DAT
binding increased in both groups in limbic and striatal areas, but relations with symptom improvement differed, being negative for
SSRI + ICBT and positive for placebo + ICBT. Thus, serotonin-dopamine transporter co-expression exerts inﬂuence on symptom
severity and remission rate in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. However, the monoamine transporters are modulated in
dissimilar ways when cognitive-behavioral treatment is given concomitantly with either SSRI-medication or pill placebo.

INTRODUCTION
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating and chronic psychiatric
disorder associated with severe suffering for the individual, negative
impact on working-life and relationships [1] and high barriers to seek
treatment [2]. Existing treatments, predominantly cognitive beha-
vioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), are often successful [3] and combining the two may further
enhance clinical efﬁcacy [4]. Neuroimaging studies support that CBT,
SSRIs, as well as combined treatment attenuate amygdala activity
and connectivity during emotional conditions in SAD [4–10]. Despite
these advances, response rates for ﬁrst line treatments are only
50–65%, indicating that many patients do not achieve remission [11].
A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying
treatment efﬁcacy in SAD is therefore needed.

Serotonin has been implicated as a key neurotransmitter in the
neurobiology of anxiety [12]. Positron emission tomography (PET)
studies of serotonin synthesis capacity, serotonin 1A-receptor and
transporter availability have suggested increased pre-synaptic
serotonin activity in SAD patients [13–15] and the beneﬁcial
effects of SSRIs [3] further point to serotonergic involvement. The
primary action of SSRIs is to block the serotonin transporter (SERT)
protein that facilitates transmembrane reuptake of serotonin into
[16] and 76–85% occupancy has been
the pre-synaptic cell
suggested to exert efﬁcient symptom relief [17, 18]. Adequate SSRI
occupancy of the SERT has been veriﬁed in SAD [19, 20]. However,
it is not clear if occupancy rate is linearly related to clinical SSRI
responses. In a previous PET study, we failed to demonstrate such
a relationship in SAD [20], consistent with several studies of major

depression [18, 21–23], although it has been observed for certain
subpopulations of depression [24, 25]. Despite the well-
characterized blockade of SERT by SSRIs, the anxiolytic mechanism
of action is still debated [26–28]. A number of downstream effects
have been proposed to mediate the clinical effect, for example
interactions with dopamine signaling [29–31].

An emerging body of evidence points to the importance of
dopamine in SAD [32–37]. While single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) studies of the dopamine trans-
porter (DAT) have yielded mixed ﬁndings [35, 38–40], we recently
demonstrated, by use of PET, that SAD symptom severity was
associated with increased striatal DAT binding and that DAT-SERT
co-expression was higher in SAD patients relative to healthy
controls [15]. There is considerable interaction between the
serotonin and dopamine systems [41–43],
for example, DATs
may contribute to serotonin reuptake [44–47]. Molecular imaging
studies have demonstrated changes in DAT availability with SSRI
treatment [48–52] suggesting that SSRIs could exert secondary
effects on the DAT. We recently showed that striatal DAT binding
was associated with SSRI anti-anxiety effects and can be shaped
by psychological expectancies[20]. CBT may affect dopamine D2
receptors [53] but, to our knowledge, no earlier PET-study has
investigated concurrent changes in serotonin and dopamine

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in serotonin and
dopamine transporter availability in SAD patients after 9 weeks of
treatment with Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) [54, 55] combined
with an SSRI (escitalopram) or pill-placebo under double-blind
conditions, and if such changes are associated with symptom
improvement. In a PET subsample of a previously reported RCT [4],
we measured SERT and DAT binding with the two highly selective
radioligands [11C]DASB and [11C]PE2I. We expected marked SERT
occupancy (lowered binding potential) speciﬁcally with SSRI-
treatment whereas we did not have directed hypotheses
regarding DAT changes. We also examined the relationships
between transporter co-expression at baseline and symptom
severity as well as symptom remission with treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Participants and design
The study was a double-blind clinical trial with a treatment duration of
9 weeks (trial registration: ISRCTN24929928), conducted between Septem-
ber 2011 and September 2013, and details have been described previously
[4]. Brieﬂy, participants were recruited through media advertisements and
screened for SAD using online versions of the Social Phobia Screening
Questionnaire (SPSQ) [56] and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
Scale–self rated version (MADRS-S) [57]. The Mini International Neuropsy-
chiatric Interview (MINI) [58], and the SAD section of the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)
[59] were thereafter administered via
telephone and subjects deemed to fulﬁll the criteria for SAD went through
a medical examination.

Exclusion criteria were previous PET-scan, treatment of any psychiatric
condition during the last three months, ongoing serious somatic or
psychiatric disorder, drug or substance abuse or dependency, menopause,
pregnancy and MRI contraindications. All subjects provided written
informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethics
committee, the Radiation Safety Committee and the Medical Products
Agency in Sweden.

After screening, 48 subjects were enrolled and randomized to treatment
with SSRI + ICBT or placebo+ICBT [4]. SAD was the primary diagnosis for all
participants. Randomization, matched for age and sex was performed by
Apoteket Production and Laboratories (APL), Stockholm, Sweden. All
subjects underwent
these
participants were again matched on age and sex and underwent
additional PET assessments. The PET pairs were drawn from the whole
sample, although no random sampling was applied. The Uppsala
University Hospital Pharmacy kept all randomization codes secret until
unblinding was due. One participant opted out of the post-treatment PET

functional and structural MRI and 26 of

assessment, and one participant dropped out of the study before scanning
procedures, leaving 24 participants (12 women) with complete PET data.
There were 6 women and 6 men in each group and mean age±SD was
37.2 ± 11.32 and 31.25 ± 8.11 years for the SSRI + ICBT and the placebo +
ICBT groups respectively. Sex and age distributions were not signiﬁcantly
different between the groups (Ps > 0.156).

Treatment
During the 9-week treatment period, the SSRI group was prescribed with a
20 mg daily dose of escitalopram, (H.Lundbeck AB, Helsingborg, Sweden)
starting with 10 mg daily dose during the ﬁrst week. SSRI and placebo oral
suspension capsules were identical, and prepared by APL, Stockholm,
Sweden. Compliance to escitalopram treatment was assessed by analyzing
blood metabolites of escitalopram at the time for the last PET-scan. SSRI

In tandem with the ﬁrst SSRI or placebo therapy, ICBT was started as
well. The ICBT program has been found to be effective in several RCTs
[55, 60, 61], and found to be as effective as face-to-face CBT [54, 62]. The
program is partly based on the Clark and Wells model of SAD [63] and
includes 9 weekly modules:
Introductory reading about SAD and CBT
(module 1), the cognitive model for SAD and cognitive restructuring
(modules 2–4), exercises for exposure (modules 5–7), social skills and
relapse prevention (modules 8–9). The treatment was guided by trained
therapists who gave the participants weekly homework, feedback on
assignments, and introduced the next week’s module. All homework and
completion of modules were registered to assess participants’ compliance
to the treatment [4].

Behavioral measures
Severity of social anxiety symptoms was measured using the clinician-
administered Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale [64] before and after
treatment. Treatment response was assessed using the Clinical Global
Impression Improvement (CGI-I), scores of 1 or 2 denoting responders and
≥3 non-responders. Both instruments were administered by the same
experienced psychiatrist.

Imaging procedure
PET-assessments. Participants were instructed to fast for 3 h before the
scanning session and to abstain from nicotine, alcohol and caffeine 12 h
before. Image acquisition was performed using a Siemens ECAT EXACT
HR + 32-ring high-resolution scanner with 63 contiguous 2.46 mm slices.
Participants were placed in the PET scanner with their heads lightly ﬁxated
and a transmission scan was performed using 3 retractable Germanium 68
rotating line sources for 10 min before the tracer was delivered with a
rapid bolus injection through a venous catheter inserted in the arm.
Dynamic PET image acquisition was initiated at the time of bolus injection.
For both [11C]DASB and [11C]PE2I, the same procedure was used during
pre- and posttreatment.

[11C]PE2I image acquisition: Twenty-two [11C]PE2I images, probing DAT
availability, were collected during 80 min (4 × 60s, 2 × 120s, 4 × 180s,
12 × 300s). Mean ± SD injected activity was 332.38 ± 16.93 MBq at
pretreatment and 319.33 ± 29.01 MBq at posttreatment.

[11C]DASB image acquisition: After a waiting period of 45–60 min to allow
sufﬁcient radioligand decay (less than 1% [11C]PE2I activity left at [11C]
DASB injection), 22 [11C]DASB images, probing SERT availability, were
collected during 60 min (1 × 60s, 4 × 30s, 3 × 60s, 4 × 120s, 2 × 180s,
8 × 300s). Mean±SD injected activity at pre-treatment was 329.50 ± 26.90
and at post- treatment, 318.75 ± 37.62 MBq.

MRI-assessments. Anatomical MRI was performed to allow co-registration
of PET images to anatomical T1-weighted images. The T1 images (echo
time (TE) = 15 ms; repetition time (TR) = 5700 ms; inversion time = 400 ms;
ﬁeld of view = 230 × 230 mm2; voxel size = 0.8 × 1.0 × 2.0 mm3; 60 con-
tiguous axial slices) were acquired with a Philips Achieva 3.0 T whole body
MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using an
8-channel head coil.

Preprocessing. Parametric [11C]PE2I binding potential (BPND) images were
generated using receptor parametric mapping [65] which is based on a
simpliﬁed reference region compartmental model and [11C]DASB BPND
images were calculated using the reference Logan [66] method. When
using reference Logan, BPND is derived by subtracting 1 from the

distribution volume ratio. Cerebellum gray matter was used as a reference
region for both [11C]DASB and [11C]PE2I due to its negligible levels of SERT
and DAT. The cerebellum was deﬁned in a user-independent fashion using
the PVElab [67] software on each participant’s T1-weighted image, which
was co-registered to the PET images.

Further preprocessing steps were performed in Statistical Parametric
Mapping 8 (SPM8;
(Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology,
University College London, www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk) implemented in MATLAB
2018a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Each participant’s BPND images
were co-registered to the anatomical T1-weighted image, which was then
segmented and normalized to MNI standard space. Transformation
parameters from segmentation were then applied to the BPND images
yielding parametric images with 2 mm isotropic voxels in MNI space. Lastly,
images were smoothed with a 12 mm Gaussian kernel.

Statistical analysis
To examine treatment effects on SERTs and DATs, pre to post treatment
diff-images were prepared. SSRI occupancy images (100 × ([PRE − POST] /
PRE)) of [11C]DASB BPND and percent change images (100 × ([POST − PRE]/
PRE)) of [11C]PE2I BPND were calculated for the SSRI + ICBT treatment arm.
Occupancy is a measure of the proportion of the transporters available pre-
treatment that are occupied by SSRI at post-treatment. Hence, occu-
pancy > 0% is reﬂected by a decrease in binding potential after treatment,
whereas percent change > 0% signiﬁes an increase in binding potential.
Since there is no SERT occupancy of SSRIs in the placebo+ICBT treatment
arm, percent change images were calculated for both [11C]DASB BPND and
[11C]PE2I BPND. The LSAS post-scores were subtracted from the pre
measurement scores with higher positive scores reﬂecting a larger
symptom improvement.
A priori regions of

interest (ROIs) were selected based on earlier
neuroimaging research in SAD and tracer binding [13, 68, 69]. [11C]PE2I
binding is speciﬁc to regions rich in dopamine transporters, such as the
dorsal
striatum (nucleus
accumbens (NAcc), but adequate levels can also be found in the amygdala,
hippocampus, thalamus and pallidum. BPND distributions were tested for
heterogeneity and normality and were deemed adequate for parametric
analyses. [11C]DASB BPND analyses were performed in the same ROIs but
also extended to the insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the
raphe nuclei. Anatomical regions were deﬁned by masks available in the
Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) library found in the Wake Forest
University Pickatlas [70]. The raphe nuclei were deﬁned using PVElab, and
NAcc with the Hammersmith atlas [71].

evaluated with one-sample t-tests using the occupancy and percent
change diff-images for the two tracers separately. Associations between
changes in transporter binding and symptom reduction were evaluated in
SPM 8 using multiple regressions with age and sex as covariates. Family
wise error (FWE) correction was used within each ROI and the statistical
threshold was set at PFWE < 0.05. Co-expression of SERT and DAT was
analyzed in Matlab 2018a, (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) using voxel-
wise partial Pearson’s correlations (age and sex as controlling variables)
with the statistical threshold set at P < 0.05. To examine if changes (Δ) in
SERT and DAT availability were associated with altered symptom severity,
multiple regressions were performed with ΔSERT, ΔDAT, their interaction
term, age and sex, as regressors. A similar regression using initial values of
SERT and DAT BPND and their interaction term as predictors, and the
initial SERT-DAT balance
change in LSAS as outcome, examined if
predicted treatment outcome.

Between group effects.
To examine treatment group differences in
changes in DAT binding, a two-sample t-test was performed in SPM8 with
age and sex as covariates and the statistical threshold set to PFWE < 0.05.
Additionally, a multiple regression was used to compare the relation
between the percentage change in DAT BPND and symptom reduction
between groups. Note that the high afﬁnity of escitalopram to the SERT
precluded the possibility of group comparisons of changes in SERT and
SERT × DAT interactions.

in the placebo+ICBT group
(Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.089), congruent with the generally
better outcome for SSRI + ICBT reported in the full treatment
sample [4].

Serotonin transporter binding
Groups did not differ in initial SERT binding (see Fig. 1 for
whole sample SERT and DAT BPND). Symptom severity,
measured with LSAS, showed negative associations with whole
sample SERT BPND in the left dorsal ACC as previously reported
[13].
Injected activity for both tracers can be found in
Supplementary Table 1.

Regarding SSRI + ICBT treatment effects, the mean occupancy of
the SERT across the a priori selected ROIs was >80% (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 2) and there were signiﬁcant positive relations
between SERT occupancy and symptom improvement in the right
NAcc, left putamen and left ACC in this group (Table 3, Fig. 2). The
mean (±SD) concentrations (nMol/l) of blood serum escitalopram and

In the placebo+ICBT arm, there was a signiﬁcant increase in SERT
binding potential from pre- to posttreatment in the raphe nuclei
(Table 2) and, when applying a more lenient statistical threshold
(PFWE < 0.10), also in the right amygdala (PFWE = 0.068, MNI: 20 4 –16,
Z = 2.63), right putamen (PFWE = 0.056, MNI: 20 18 –10, Z = 3.16) and
right NAcc (PFWE = 0.061, MNI: 12 12 –12, Z = 2.18). No signiﬁcant

conditions. Both SSRI + ICBT and placebo + ICBT resulted in
signiﬁcant improvement on the main social anxiety outcome (LSAS),
with a trend towards higher number of responders in the SSRI arm.
Since the clinical measures of the full cohort has already been
evaluated [4], the aim of the current study was not to verify
differential treatment efﬁcacy, but to evaluate if monoaminergic
transporter mechanisms underlying symptom improvement differ
between the two treatment modalities. Both treatment combinations
yielded similar pre-to-post increases in DAT availability in limbic and
striatal regions but associations with symptom reduction differed in
direction across treatment groups. Baseline SERT-DAT co-expression
was high, and showed positive relations with initial symptom
severity. Co-expression also predicted treatment outcome, albeit
again in different directions in the two groups.

As expected, only the SSRI + ICBT combination yielded a SERT

signiﬁcantly associated with symptom improvement which has

depression [25]. With the current design, it cannot be excluded
that ICBT moderated this effect.

Studies of depression have suggested that SERT binding increases
after CBT [72, 73]. Consistently, in the placebo+ICBT arm, we observed
increased (pre-post) SERT binding in the raphe nuclei, although this
effect was not related to clinical improvement. The raphe is regarded
as an important target for SSRIs due to its high concentration of
serotonergic neurons, and PET studies of SAD have demonstrated
lower serotonin 1 A binding [14] and increased serotonin synthesis
[13] in this region before treatment. The current results indicate that
raphe serotonergic activity could also be modulated by ICBT, in line
with ﬁndings of reduced serotonin 1B receptor binding in raphe after
ICBT for major depressive disorder [74].
Increased SERT binding,
suggesting faster serotonin clearance, is interesting in the context of
reduced serotonin synthesis reported after anxiolytic treatment [68].
However, ICBT effects on raphe SERTs did not occur concomitantly
with altered serotonin transport in other regions.

Regarding dopamine transport, both groups exhibited a general
increase in DAT binding with treatment. In SAD, similar effects of
escitalopram have previously been reported in a SPECT study, where
DAT increases were limited to the left dorsal striatum and did not
correlate with symptom improvement [48]. Additionally, in a recent
PET study from our group on SSRI response expectancies [20], DAT
BPND increases were found in the hippocampus and pallidum, but
only in the treatment group with lowered expectancies of improve-
ment induced by verbal instructions. Since similar DAT increases were
observed in both groups in the current study, it is possible that these
changes were mainly driven by ICBT,
i.e., dopaminergic changes
might be more pronounced with ICBT than SSRI-treatment.

Despite common DAT increases,

the two treatment groups
showed inverse associations between DAT BPND change and
treatment outcome. With SSRI + ICBT, symptom improvement was

negatively associated with DAT change in the amygdala. Further, in
the ventral striatum and thalamus, symptom improvement was
associated with smaller DAT increases in the SSRI + ICBT arm relative
to placebo+ICBT where positive associations were noted. Similarly,
we previously observed that pre-post reductions in DAT improved
symptoms in SAD patients treated openly with escitalopram [20].
The current data, however, suggests a different role of dopamine in
ICBT. Stronger association between increased DAT BPND in NAcc and
symptom reduction with placebo+ICBT could possibly reﬂect that

The noted association between ICBT outcome and the overall DAT
increases
study of appetitive/approach
elements of CBT and their associations with dopamine function is
warranted. Speculatively, SSRIs may act more by modulating
signaling. For example, SSRI + ICBT yielded
amygdala threat
stronger attenuation of amygdala BOLD reactivity to emotional
faces than placebo+ICBT in the larger cohort [4]. Very few studies
have examined dopaminergic changes in SAD, non-confounded by
pharmacological treatment, but Cervenka and coworkers [53] found
increased D2 receptor binding potential in limbic and pre-frontal
areas with ICBT. Since changes both in D2 and DAT parameters can
be linked to treatment outcome in SAD, and since D2 autoreceptors
regulate dopamine synthesis and DAT expression [78],
further
research on both dopamine sub-systems is warranted. As we
mentioned previously in a study of a different cohort [20], our PET
data may indicate dopaminergic dysfunction in SAD similar to at
least some subgroups of treatment resistant depression for which
dopamine agonists could be effective [79]. However, dopaminergic
medications have not stood out as particularly effective on their
own, although this topic is understudied [80, 81].

improvement were detected, i.e., the left anterior cingulate, right nucleus accumbens and left putamen.

Fig. 3 Scatterplots of signiﬁcant group differences in associations between symptom improvement, as measured with the Liebowitz

In all evaluated brain regions, there was signiﬁcant positive co-
expression of SERT and DATs at baseline which exhibited a
positive relation with symptom severity. We have reported a
similar relationship in a different cohort, i.e., a signiﬁcantly higher
correlation coefﬁcient between SERT and DAT BPND in SAD
patients relative to healthy controls [15]. Thus, upregulated

pathophysiology of SAD. Differences were also noted regarding
prediction of treatment outcome. In the SSRI + ICBT group, high
initial SERT-DAT co-expression in striatal-thalamic areas predicted
better treatment outcome, which was also found for the thalamus
in the placebo+ICBT group, whereas for other brain regions, high
initial SERT-DAT co-expression was generally disadvantageous for
treatment success with placebo+ICBT. Similarly,
in the larger

cohort, we previously demonstrated that initial neural activations
of the dACC in response to emotional faces, predicted outcome in
different directions in the two treatment modalities [82].

The multi-tracer PET methodology enabling analysis of trans-
porter co-expression, the double-blind RCT design, and inclusion
of a non-pharmacologic treatment group are major strengths of
our study, but there are also limitations to consider. First, an
additional control group to the ICBT condition, e.g., a waiting-list,
no-treatment, or placebo-only control, would have been helpful to
capture the complete contribution of ICBT. Second, voxel-based
analyses are likely more spatially sensitive than regional mean
approaches but might also be more susceptible to noise due to
the smaller number of activity counts detected within the limited
volume and due to smoothing of parametric images especially in
smaller ROIs. Also, the complex dynamics between serotonin and
dopamine signaling cannot be uncovered by PET data on
transporters only and the longevity of the transporter changes
needs further evaluation. Another limitation is that analyses were
not adjusted for menstrual cycle phase. Moreover, although PET is
a more sensitive and precise imaging technique than SPECT, the
restricted sample size warrants some caution, especially regarding
the SERT×DAT interactions linked to symptom reduction (see
supplementary material), because the number of regressors were
large in relation to sample size.

In conclusion, the current study replicates and extends several of
our previous PET ﬁndings in SAD [15, 20], mainly that SAD patients
before treatment exhibit strong positive SERT-DAT associations
related to symptom severity, that clinical doses of escitalopram
result in high (>80%) SERT occupancy, here associated with clinical
improvement, and that
increases of DAT
reductions or
availability are associated with better outcome in SSRI-treated
patients. Results further suggest that monoamine transporter co-
expression has an impact on symptom remission with treatment and
that pharmacologic and psychosocial
treatments modulate the
transporter proteins in disparate ways.
