Psychosis is a state of impaired reality, which may include hallucinations and delusions. It may occur due to an underlying medical condition, substance use, or as a symptom of a psychotic disorder. Treatment and therapy can support recovery.

Experiencing psychosis can impair your daily functioning. It can have a negative effect on various aspects of your life, such as work, school, or your ability to maintain relationships.

Each person may experience psychosis differently. Some people may have experiences that put themselves and others at risk of harm. It’s important to get medical help right away if you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of psychosis.

## What causes psychosis?


Psychosis can develop as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or a medical condition that affects the brain.

- bipolar disorder

- delusional disorder

- psychotic depression

Other possible causes or triggers of psychosisinclude:

- genetic mutations

- dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease

- Parkinson’s disease

- endocrine disorders

In addition, other triggers or risk factors include sleep deprivation andsubstance misuseas well as environmental factors like trauma andstress.


## How is psychosis diagnosed?


Doctors diagnose psychosis with apsychiatric evaluation. A doctor observes the person’s behavior and asks questions about what they’re experiencing.

The doctor may order medical and imaging tests to determine whether there is an underlying illness causing the symptoms.

Many of the symptoms of psychosis in adults aren’t symptoms of psychosis in young people. For example, small children often have imaginary friends with whom they talk. This represents imaginative play, which is typical for children but may indicate psychosis in adults.

If you’re worried about psychosis in a child or adolescent, reach out to a doctor for support.


## How is psychosis treated?


Treating psychosis depends on the underlying cause. For instance, if the cause is an underlying medical condition, then the treatment will be targeted to that condition.

If the cause is psychiatric, treatment may involve a combination of medications and therapy. Most people experience an improvement in their symptoms with treatment.


### Rapid tranquilization


Sometimes people experiencing psychosis can become agitated and be at risk of hurting themselves or others. In these cases, it may be necessary to calm them down quickly.

This method is calledrapid tranquilization. A doctor or emergency response personnel will administer a fast-acting injection or liquid medication to quickly relax the person.

Antipsychoticscan help manage symptoms of psychosis. These medications reduce hallucinations and delusions and help people think more clearly. The type of antipsychotic a doctor prescribes will depend on the symptoms.

In many cases, people only need to take antipsychotics for a short time until their symptoms are more manageable. Others may need to take them more long term.


### Cognitive behavioral therapy


Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)is a type of mental health therapy that aims to change thinking and behaviors. It involves regular meetings with a mental health therapist.

CBTcan be effectivein helping people better manage their mental health conditions.

It’s often most helpful for symptoms of psychosis that medications don’t fully address.


## Do people recover from psychosis?


Depending on the cause, most people typically recover from psychosis after a few weeks or months. With treatment, the severity of the symptoms will gradually decrease.

That said, a2022 studylooked into how people experiencing psychosis for the first time recovered over a 10-year period.

Researchers compared 142 people with psychosis to 117 people without the condition. They found that about one-third of the group with psychosis showed clinical recovery. But when researchers reduced the criteria for recovery, they found that more people met the standard for recovery.

These results suggest that the recovery phase might not involve a total disappearance of symptoms for everyone, but that you’re likely on the right path as long as there’s improvement.


## How to support someone living with psychosis?


Experiencing psychosiscan be extremely frightening, but many people who experience it don’t always talk about it initially.

If you believe someone you know may be experiencing psychosis or may soon experience symptoms, contact their healthcare team right away if they have one. If they don’t, reach out to a local hospital for advice.

If you believe the person may be a danger to themselves or others, you can call 911 or take them to the emergency room.

If you feel unsure or nervous about their behavior or what they might do, get a professional involved as soon as you can.
