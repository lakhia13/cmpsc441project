Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of stress, depression, and anxiety among
Polish secondary school teachers and their association with selected psychosocial, sociodemographic,
and lifestyle factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 116 Polish teachers in 2019,
using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the Depression and
Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and author questionnaire including psychosocial factors speciﬁc to
the respondents’ work environment. The prevalence of moderately to extremely severe levels of
depression, anxiety, and symptoms of stress in teachers was 18.1%, 22.4%, and 51.7%, respectively.
Among respondents with moderate or high physical activity level (PAL), normal or mild levels of
depression (OR = 3.62; CI [1.31–10.03]), anxiety (OR = 2.61; CI [1.01–6.73]), and stress (OR = 2.79; CI
[1.16–6.69]) were more common. The level of individual symptoms of mental disorders was higher
than indicated by previous Polish reports. Given that teachers’ low PAL is signiﬁcantly related to
their moderately to extremely severe levels of stress, depression, and anxiety, we suggest running
leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) enhancement programs and supporting the leadership of school
management and the higher-education system in this regard.

1. Introduction

Teachers—both in Poland [1] and internationally [2]—represent one of the largest
professional groups. At the same time, they have the highest dropout rate among those
working in the public sector [3,4]. Their working environment is full of stressful factors [4,5].
These are physical (e.g., high noise levels, artiﬁcial lighting) and psychosocial (e.g., inappro-
priate student behavior, overcrowding in schools, low status of the profession) [3]. Whereas
the former factors have a direct impact on health and can be accurately measured, the latter
do not translate directly into health risks. However, depending on the importance of a
given factor for the individual and his/her emotional response, they may lead to changes
in the body that will result in loss of health [3,6]. The most commonly conﬁrmed health
consequences of occupational stress include coronary heart disease [7–10], alcoholism, and
psychiatric disorders [11]. Stress may correlate with the risk of metabolic syndrome [12],
acute myocardial infarction [13], type 2 diabetes [14,15], and renal dysfunction [16].

The teaching profession has been described as one of the most stressful and depressing [17,18].
In Germany, symptoms of signiﬁcant mental health problems have been reported in almost
30% of teachers [4], and in Malaysia in more than 20% of those working in secondary
schools [2]. This problem is also reﬂected in the Polish reality. As many as 86% of teachers
believe that their workload is higher than in other professions [19], 20% have full symptoms
of burnout syndrome [20], 16–17% a high level of organizational burden resulting from

conﬂict situations at work, and 25% a low sense of meaning in their work [21]. It is evident
that psychosocial burdens are very strongly related to the psychophysical condition of
teachers (e.g., anxiety, depression, or professional burnout) [22–24]. Single factors, such as
stress [25–27], depression [28], and anxiety [29], affect health and teacher effectiveness [30].
Interest in the diagnosis of teachers’ psychosocial burdens and effects on their health
(including mental health problems) has an important empirical basis. However, relatively
little is known about the relationship of single factors, such as stress, depression, and
anxiety, and the risk factors of teachers’ lifestyle (e.g., prolonged sitting, lack of or too little
physical activity). Moreover, these types of behaviors can, in the long run, be a direct cause
of mental health problems or increase the risk of developing such conditions.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the levels of stress, depression, and
anxiety among Polish secondary school teachers. This research also focused on determining
the association of moderate, severe, or extremely severe symptoms of these disorders with
selected factors: psychosocial (work experience, total lessons per week, steady income),
sociodemographic (gender), and lifestyle characteristics of the respondents (level of physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and biometric characteristics). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study of its kind in Poland. However, as far as lifestyle variables are
concerned, only the physical activity results are presented in this study. Sedentary behaviors
and biometric traits will be presented in further studies.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants

The study was conducted in June 2019. The sampling frame was a list of all general
secondary schools in Katowice, from which eight institutions were selected by simple
random sampling. We assumed that the sampling frame was all teachers of high schools
in Katowice (n = 789) as of 30 September 2018. We estimated the number of teachers
based on Wayne’s formula [31]. Interviews with randomly appointed teachers at schools
were conducted in the teachers’ workplace in June 2019, with the prior consent of the
head teacher. The interview lasted 30 min and was conducted by a trained interviewer. A
total of 116 teachers took part in the survey: 28 male and 88 female (humanities—55.2%,
mathematics and natural sciences—31.9%, physical education—12.9%). The mean age of
the respondents was 45.0 ± 8.8 years. Most teachers (74.1%) were employed full-time. The
Bioethics Committee of the Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education in Katowice
approved the study.

2.2. Measurements (Study Instruments and Data Analysis)

The Polish version of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) [32], the
Polish short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) [33], and
author questionnaire containing questions on gender and psychosocial factors characteristic
of the respondents’ work environment (work experience, total lessons per week, steady
income) were used (Table 1).

2.3. Dependent Variables

The culturally adapted and validated short-version DASS-21 was used to assess the
frequency and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress. The internal consistency of
the Polish version of the DASS-21 has Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.86, 0.84, and 0.85 for
depression, anxiety, and stress subscales, respectively [32]. Respondents were asked to
indicate the presence of the symptoms over the past week on a four-point Likert scale,
ranging from 0 (did not apply at all) to 3 (applied very much or most of the time). The
total score for each subscale was calculated and the severity rating was classiﬁed as normal,
mild, moderate, or severe to extremely severe [34] (Table 2).

Notes: * Scores on the DASS-21 need to be multiplied by 2 in each subscale to calculate the total score.

2.4. Independent Variables

The IPAQ-SF was used to provide information about the frequency, duration, and
intensity of physical activity during the last 7 days. Physical activity refers to every physical
effort lasting for at least 10 min at a time [35]. A weekly energy expenditure of total physical
activity (EETPA) was calculated by multiplying a MET number attributed to it (vigorous
(VPA)—8.0 METs, moderate (MPA)—4.0 METs, walking—3.3 METs) by the number of
days of practicing it per week and duration in minutes per day. Subjects were ranked in
two score categories concerning physical activity level (PAL): low and moderate/high [36]
(Table 1).

2.5. Confounding Variables

Gender (female, male), work experience (≤20 years, >20 years), total lessons per week
(≤18 h/week, >18 h/week), and steady income (≤2700 PLN, >2700 PLN) were used as
confounding variables.

All variables included in the analysis and their respective descriptive statistics are

presented in Table 1.

2.6. Statistical Analysis

The data collected in the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 26 (IBM
Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted using
means (M), standard deviations (SD), median (Me), ﬁrst and third quartiles (Q1, Q3),
frequency (f), and relative frequency (rf) in percentages. The assessment of relationships
between depression, anxiety, and stress level (dependent variables) and the level of physical
activity (independent variable), as well as gender and psychosocial factors (confounding
variables) was based on odds ratios (ORs) and conﬁdence intervals for ORs.

The study used regression modeling based on the technique of sequentially entering
the independent and confounding variables of the model, commonly used in physical ac-
tivity studies [37,38]. The area under the curve (AUC) calculated for the receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the predictive value of the models consid-
ered (classiﬁer validity assessment) [39]. AUC values were judged based on published
standards: AUC ≥ 0.90 outstanding prediction, 0.80 ≤ AUC < 0.90 excellent prediction,
0.70 ≤ AUC < 0.80 acceptable prediction, 0.50 < AUC < 0.70 poor prediction, AUC = 0.50
no prediction [40]. The level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at α = 0.05.

3. Results

The prevalence of moderately to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and
symptoms of stress of teachers was 18.1%, 22.4%, and 51.7%, respectively (Table 1). The
subjects’ averages for depression and anxiety were at a normal level (M = 7.7 ± 6.8 pts.;
M = 6.5 ± 6.2 pts.) and the average for stress was at a moderate level (M = 19.3 ± 7.4 pts.).
Descriptive statistics for the DASS-21 subscales are presented in Table 3.

the study, a third of the respondents (32.8%) had a low level of physical activity, 61.2%
moderate, and 6.0% high.

(AUC = 0.70), we discuss in detail the model5 based on the predictors PAL, gender, work
experience, total lessons per week, and steady income. Depression was found to be
statistically signiﬁcantly associated with PAL. Teachers who declared moderate or high
PAL were 3.6 times more likely to report normal or mild levels of depression than those
with low PAL (OR = 3.62; CI [1.31–10.03]). The odds ratio (OR) of reporting a normal or
mild level of depression was 43% higher for females than for males, 66% higher for those
with ≤20 years of work experience than those with more experience, 46% higher for those
working ≤18 h/week than >18 h/week, and 23% lower for those with lower steady income
(≤2700 PLN) than the others (Table 4). No statistically signiﬁcant differences were found in
this regard.

As far as modeling the probability of normal or mild vs moderate to severe anxiety is
concerned, a model (model5) based on the predictors PAL, gender, work experience, total
lessons per week, and steady income achieved a classiﬁcation efﬁciency of AUC = 0.68
(Table 5). Again, the only statistically signiﬁcant factor was PAL. Teachers who declared
moderate or high PAL were 2.6 times more likely to report normal or mild level of anxiety
than those with low PAL (OR = 2.61; CI [1.01–6.73]). The odds ratio (OR) of reporting
normal or mild level of anxiety was 44% lower for females than for males and 34% lower
for teachers with ≤20 years of work experience than those with more experience. Teachers
working ≤18 h of lessons/week and earning ≤2700 PLN were, respectively, 2.7 times and
1.8 times more likely to have normal or mild symptoms of anxiety than those working and
earning more.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to analyze the levels of stress, depression, and anxiety among
secondary school teachers in Katowice and to determine the association of moderate,
severe, or extremely severe symptoms of these disorders with selected factors: psychosocial
work environment, sociodemographic, and lifestyle of the subjects. We can distinguish the
following psychological factors: work experience (≤20 years–>20 years), total lessons per
week (≤18 h/week–>18 h/week), steady income (≤2700 PLN–>2700 PLN), lifestyle factors
(level of physical activity: high or moderate–low), and sociodemographic factors (gender).
Previous research shows that the former may have an impact on teacher frustration [26,41].
Negative emotions are accompanied by pathological biochemical and physiological changes
(acceleration of heart rate, secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormones, increase in blood
pressure), which consequently lead to loss of health [3,6,42]. Sociodemographic factors
(e.g., gender) may condition teachers’ mental state [43,44], and unhealthy lifestyle behav-
iors may mediate the correlation of occupational stress and chronic disease risk [2,45,46].
The strongest relationships are those in which factors cluster together, reinforcing the
interaction [2,47,48]. Therefore, in this study, sociodemographic, psychosocial, and lifestyle
variables of teachers were analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study of
its kind in Poland and one of two in the world [49].

The results of our study ﬁrstly show that the prevalence of moderately to extremely
severe levels of depression, anxiety, and symptoms of stress of teachers is 18.1%, 22.4%, and
51.7%, respectively. This is far more than reported by Polish population data and previous
studies of teachers. According to the Central Statistical Ofﬁce [50], depressive symptoms of
varying severity affect 16.1% of adult Poles (mild—11.9%, moderate—2.7%, severe—1.5%).
On average, every sixth person suffers from anxiety disorders [51] (for anxiety attacks ever
in life—17.3%, for generalized anxiety—23.9%, for social anxiety—14.9%) [52]. Stress is a
problem for 45% of Poles (in 26% of cases due to work) [53]. However, among 14 groups
of employees representing social service professions, the highest perceived level of stress
is reported in teachers [54]. Every second Polish junior high school teacher experiences
it at work often or even always [55], and 43.3% of the teaching staff describe their stress
level as high [55]. In the group of high school teachers, the greatest stressor is mental strain,
lack of rewards, organizational uncertainty, a sense of threat, and physical nuisance [56].
Our analysis shows that the problem of mental ill health in this professional group is
becoming worse. Researchers from other countries also draw attention to the problem of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8868

the poor psychophysical condition of teachers. Australians recommend a paradigm shift
from burnout to occupational depression, due to the fact that depression coincides with
burnout [57]. The Spanish found that many individual, school, and workplace factors can
play a large role in altering the state of depression [58]. Among Egyptian teachers, work
stress, anxiety, and depression are signiﬁcantly higher in those over the age of 40 years,
female teachers, elementary school teachers, and those with insufﬁcient salaries, higher
teaching experience, higher qualiﬁcations, and higher workload [59]. However, they did
not investigate the level of physical activity of teachers.

The present study demonstrates that among the factors analyzed (gender, work expe-
rience, total lessons per week, steady income, PAL), only PAL had a statistically signiﬁcant
(OR = 2.79, [1.16–6.69]) relationship with moderately to extremely severe levels of teacher
stress, depression, and anxiety. Teachers who reported moderate to high PAL were 3.6 times
more likely (than those with low levels) to report normal to mild levels of depression
(OR = 3.62; CI [1.31–10.03]), 2.6 times more likely to report normal to mild levels of anxiety
(OR = 2.61; CI [1.01–6.73]), and 2.8 times more likely to report normal to mild levels of stress
(OR = 2.79; CI [1.16–6.69]). There were no statistically signiﬁcant correlations between
psychological status and gender, length of service, or gross weekly work hours among
the teachers surveyed. This indicates the importance of PA interventions for maintaining
mental health in this occupational group, which supports an earlier review analysis by
Bogaert et al. [49]. According to that, undertaking PA has a positive impact on perceived
job satisfaction and job stress (across various other jobs) [49]. It is well known that PA is a
signiﬁcant source of personal and social capital development, with particular reference to
the effects seen in the labor market and the associated economic effects (i.e., employability
in later stages of working life or health-care costs) [60]. Regular PA is known to be an
enabler for building social resources—support and social inclusion [61,62]. Creating a
better social network, social activation, and improved self-esteem can prevent stress or
lead to greater stress tolerance [61,63,64]. PA can also mitigate the effects of stress by
inﬂuencing an individual’s eating habits, stabilizing hormone production, and lowering
blood pressure [63,65]. It can affect mental health by moderating mood and emotions,
improving self-esteem and cognitive functioning, and counteracting anxiety, stress, de-
pression, aging, and mental dysfunction [66]. A signiﬁcant association between low PA
levels and depression (OR = 2.16, [1.12–4.16]), stress (OR = 0.45, [0.23–0.88]), and personal
income (OR = 0.63, [0.44–0.91]) was conﬁrmed in Iranian women [45]. PA of Iranian female
high school students was also shown to be inversely related to anxiety [67]. Similarly,
Cheung et al. demonstrated that lack of exercise among Hong Kong nursing students was
a signiﬁcant correlate of depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, OR = 0.4–1.6) [68]. A
Korean study [69] found that the risk of unhealthy lifestyle factors (including low PA) was
more common among those with mild to moderate stress than among those with lower
stress levels. Of course, some studies show weak or inconsistent correlations between work
stress and unhealthy behaviors [46,70], indicating the need for further inquiry. Finally,
there are studies noting that the strength of impact on mental health may depend on the
type of PA (active commuting or physical activity at work, at home, in leisure) [71,72].
In the case of Flemish secondary school teachers [49], as well as several other studies
involving adults [71,73–75], higher participation in leisure-time PA (LTPA) was associated
with more positive perceived health. Holtermann et al. speculated that LTPA may be more
beneﬁcial due to its dynamic use of large muscle groups and sufﬁcient time to recover from
exercise [76]. It may also induce a greater sense of autonomy and mastery [70], which may
support intrinsic motivation [77], result in higher self-esteem, and indirectly enhance social
cohesion and active coping [64].

All of this conﬁrms the need for a rapid response in the teaching environment and the
introduction of strategies to increase PA, which, as previous research has shown, has the
potential to combat mental disorders [78]. Mere mental health promotion limited to public
education [79], or even providing teachers with methods to cope with stress and tension
at work, is not enough, especially since, unlike physical or metabolic diseases, symptoms

of depression, anxiety, and stress are often ignored and treated as a normal psychological
reaction that does not require treatment [80]. It is obvious and natural that stressors are
immanent to the teaching profession [81]. Meanwhile, untreated early disorders can lead
to unexplained somatic symptoms [82].

Undoubtedly, further research (of broader scope) is needed to conﬁrm our ﬁndings, as
well as more detailed analyses (e.g., correlation matrix or multivariate regression analysis)
to understand the causal relationships of PA and moderately to extremely severe levels
of stress, depression, and anxiety. The data from these studies will be a useful guide for
making decisions about improving the mental health and well-being of teachers (as well as
related professional groups). Knowing that mental and physical health are signiﬁcantly
interrelated, we can assume that improving one element of teacher health may indirectly
improve other elements.

5. Conclusions

Teachers of secondary schools in Katowice perceive their mental health to be worse
than the general health level of the Polish population. Moreover, the level of individual
symptoms of mental disorders is higher than indicated by previous Polish reports on this
professional group. This can be a major problem for this environment, as well as for society
as a whole, resulting not only in chronic disease [4,17] and reducing quality of work but also
prematurely leaving the profession [30,83,84]. Given that teachers’ low PAL is signiﬁcantly
related to their moderately to extremely severe levels of stress, depression, and anxiety, we
suggest conducting activities to increase LTPA. Promotion is needed based on awareness
of the beneﬁts of PA for health (including mental health) and the introduction of speciﬁc
LTPA programs (e.g., classes taught by school PE teachers). A supportive leadership style
and higher-education management using effective communication, formulating achievable
goals, and creating a positive working environment is of great importance in this regard. It
is essential to synchronize PA activities with the structural and organizational activities of
the respective school and the situation and capabilities of the teacher [85].

6. Strengths and Limitations

This is the ﬁrst study in Poland to analyze simultaneous levels of depression, anxiety,
and stress among teachers and the relationship between these disorders and sociodemo-
graphic, psychosocial, work, and lifestyle factors of the respondents. The standardized
survey instruments DASS-21 and IPAQ-SF were used. Adequate strength of conclusions
was guaranteed by adopting an AUC ≥ 0.70, which does not overestimate the strength of
the association between variables.

Since this was a small-scale study, among high school teachers in a city within southern
Poland, there are several limitations. First, the results cannot be generalized to the entire
teaching community. To obtain more accurate data, a more extensive survey with a larger
sample is recommended. Second, the DASS-21 is not a diagnostic tool, but a screening tool
to detect the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. In a clinical setting, a
high DASS-21 score requires evaluation by a psychiatrist before deﬁnitive diagnosis and
treatment. Therefore, future studies using validated diagnostic tools are recommended
to determine the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress in this community.
Finally, the IPAQ was used to estimate the level of PA, which, on the one hand, has some
limitations (subjectivity, the effect of the burden of social expectations, or the varying
ability of respondents to report past events), but on the other hand, offers the possibility of
undertaking a population-based study.
