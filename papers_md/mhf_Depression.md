Mild depression can make you feel low and as though everything is harder to do. Severe depression can lead to feeling hopeless and, in some cases, suicidal.

If you’re depressed, you’re not alone. In England, 3 in every 100 people will experience depression in any given week. Even more – 8 in every 100 – will experience mixed depression andanxiety. (Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014).

Remember that help and support are available, and recovery is possible even if you’ve felt depressed for a long time. Different treatments work for different people, sotalk to your GPabout alternatives if something isn’t working for you.


### What are the symptoms of depression?


Depression affects people in different ways. It can affect your mind, body and behaviour.

You might feel:

- sad, upset or tearful

- guilty or worthless

- restless or irritable

- lacking in self-confidence and self-esteem

- unable to enjoy things that usually bring you pleasure

- helpless or hopeless

- anxiousor worried

- suicidalor want tohurt yourself

Physical symptoms can include:

- tiredness and lack of energy

- moving or speaking more slowly

- sleep problems: finding it hard to get to sleep or waking up very early

- changes in your weight or appetite

- no sex drive and/or sexual problems

- unexplained aches and pains

You might behave differently. You may:

- avoid other people, even your close friends

- find it hard to function at work, college or school

- find it difficult to make decisions or think clearly

- be unable to concentrate or remember things

Some people experiencepsychosisduring a severe episode of depression. This means you may see or hear things that aren’t there or believe things that aren’t true.


### Different types of depression


Your doctor may diagnose you with depression and say that it’s mild, moderate or severe, depending on your symptoms and how severe they are. Or you may be diagnosed with a specific type of depression, such as:

- dysthymia – mild depression that lasts for several years

- seasonal affective disorder (SAD)– a depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern

- postnatal depression– a depression that many parents experience after having a baby. Some people experience antenatal depression during pregnancy


### What causes depression?


Depression is a complex condition. Different factors can lead to it, including genetics, physical health problems, difficult childhood experiences and stressful life events such as unemployment, the end of a relationship, or being bullied or assaulted.

You may find that a combination of factors led to your depression, or there might not be an obvious cause.


### Getting support


The first step to getting support is to speak to your GP. Many people wait a long time before seeing their GP, but the sooner you go, the sooner you can start to recover. If you’ve felt depressed for a long time, you may feel like it’ll always be part of your life - but try to stay open to the possibility of change. There are many different types of help available now.

A common treatment for depression involves a combination of self-help, talking therapies and medication. The right treatment for you will depend on the type of depression you have and how severe it is.


### Self-help resources


Your GP may offer you self-help resources. These are often available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options. They include self-help books, onlinecognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)or group exercise classes – there is evidence that exercise can help depression.

The NHS website hasmore information about self-help, including links to books, apps and online forums.


### Talking therapies


Talking therapiesinvolve speaking confidently to a trained professional about your feelings and worries. Many different talking therapies are recommended for depression, includingcognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy, psychotherapy and counselling. Your GP can advise you about which one you may find most helpful.

You canrefer yourselffor therapy if you live in England.

NHS waiting lists for talking therapy can be long, so ask your GP what you can do to help yourself while you wait. You can also find a private therapist if you can afford it – see our page ontalking therapiesfor more information.

Another option is to take antidepressants. You can take them on their own or while having talking therapy.

There are several different types of antidepressants, so talk to your GP about which one might suit you best. If one doesn’t work, you may be prescribed another. You usually need to take them for one or two weeks before you start to feel the benefit.
