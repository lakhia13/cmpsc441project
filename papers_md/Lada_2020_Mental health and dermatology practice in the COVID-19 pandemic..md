The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the inex-
tricable link between mental health and chronic skin
disease. Furthermore,
it is crucial that patients are
aware of the potential mental health impact of the
pandemic, and have clear guidance about how to
maintain their wellbeing and seek help in case of dis-
tress.

Chronic skin disease is linked to psychological dis-
tress and psychiatric comorbidities, which signiﬁcantly
increase disability in these patients. Atopic dermatitis
and chronic urticaria are strongly associated with
anxiety and depressive symptoms. In psoriasis, up to
one in ﬁve patients have clinically signiﬁcant depres-
sion, and social isolation is high. Up to 17% of people
with psoriasis and 9.3% of people with eczema report
suicidal thoughts, and evidence suggests that these
skin diseases pose higher suicide risks.1

Immediate stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic
such as statutory shielding and social distancing are
likely to have a direct effect on patients’ mental health.
There is evidence that the pandemic may also constitute
a traumatic or stigmatizing event, with long-lasting
consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). The further likely severe socio-economic impact
is likely to contribute to the psychological burden of the
population, including suicidality.2

Given that people with chronic skin disease are at
higher risk for mental health disease and many (espe-
cially those on immunosuppressant medications) have
been advised to shield and self-isolate, the psychologi-
cal impact of the pandemic on these patients is partic-
ularly
to
experience higher rates of health anxiety and social

isolation and probably low mood during the shielding
and social distancing period, as well as reduced physi-
cal attendance at medical services. Some patients may
experience changes in their immunosuppression ther-
leading to acute ﬂares
apy subject to infection risk,
and creating a vicious cycle with further worsening of
their mental health. The psychosocial stress of the
pandemic may itself present a trigger for inﬂammatory
individuals who develop
skin conditions. Notably,
stress-related disorders such as PTSD after traumatic
or other stressful events are at increased risk of subse-
quently developing autoimmune diseases,
including
psoriasis.3

It is therefore crucial that sufﬁcient prevention and
management measures are in place for people with
dermatological disease. Patients need to be educated
about the importance of taking active steps to promote
their wellbeing. Basic wellbeing and self-care advice
with emphasis on social connectedness should be
available to all. Maintaining a balance between work
and personal time is important, along with a daily
structure and good sleep hygiene practices. People
with existing physical and mental comorbidities should
be strongly encouraged to look after their physical
health and should be given information,
including
online resources, with exercise and diet advice. Rein-
forcement and activation of positive social and per-
sonal life resources increases resilience and is highly
relevant in populations with psoriasis and eczema, for
which the rates of alcohol abuse and other maladap-
tive coping strategies are increased.4

For this reason, we and others have made available

These resources are particularly relevant to COVID-19

what steps to take and who to contact if they need

wellbeing. Feelings of guilt and worthlessness are com-
mon in depression and may inhibit help-seeking beha-
viour. Patients with affective disorders or acute
distress often experience avolition, psychomotor retar-
dation and cognitive disorders,
including impaired
concentration, memory or decision-making. It is there-
fore important that comorbid or at-risk populations
have direct access to readily available information
about key clinical contacts without having to utilize
signiﬁcant cognitive resources. Written contact infor-
mation in times of crisis, including 24-hour accessible
contacts,
is an essential component of safety plans
used in mental health care. While it may not be possi-
ble to create personalized documents, key information
and advice (e.g. signposting to General Practitioner
emergency appointments, 24-hour helpline numbers
such as the Samaritans’ charity, accident and emer-
gency services information, local mental health crisis
team numbers, and weblinks to specialist societies’
and government wellbeing guidance) could be dissemi-
nated to patients or integrated into either face-to-face
or telephone consultations. Our resources have there-
fore signposted patients and healthcare professionals
(HCPs) to already established mental health support
networks, which have, themselves, developed COVID-
19 pandemic orientated advice.

It is equally important that there are well-deﬁned
clinical management protocols for people who present
with distress and psychiatric comorbidity either in the
dermatology clinic or during virtual consultations.
Among concerns over the potential
increase of sui-
cides, clinicians should be aware of patients at high
suicidality risk and should alert primary care and
mental health services, where appropriate. Previous
mental disorders or
substance
abuse and other addictions, chronic painful comorbidi-
ties, loneliness and socio-economic factors (unemploy-
ment, ﬁnancial difﬁculties, recent bereavement) are
recognized risk factors for suicidality. Efforts should be
made to arrange follow-ups for those patients, particu-
larly if they are socially withdrawn or repeatedly miss
appointments. Proactively asking at-risk patients about
suicidality (thoughts, plans, attempts) could help them
share feelings that would otherwise remain unex-
pressed and access appropriate care.

The pandemic has changed dermatology practice,
altering the way care is delivered and inﬂuencing treat-
ment decisions. During this challenging time, patients’
mental health, which is integral to their quality of life,
should be a clinical priority. High-risk populations, par-
ticularly patients with chronic inﬂammatory skin dis-

maintaining wellbeing and the central role of social
networks. Establishing prevention and management
pathways for mental health can help signiﬁcantly
improve outcomes of dermatology patients not only
during the crisis, but also in its wake.

Finally, we are very much aware of the impact of
COVID-19-related mental health consequences
for
HCPs in both general dermatology and psychoderma-
tology. We have established a link for HCPs to access
and be signposted to advice and support, which is tai-
lored for them rather than for patients.6 We are in the
process of establishing a virtual network for HCPs
working in general dermatology and psychodermatol-
ogy to further support our colleagues in these chal-
lenging times.
