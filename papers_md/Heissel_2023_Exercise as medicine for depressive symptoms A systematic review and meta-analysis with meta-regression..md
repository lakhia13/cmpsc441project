ABSTRACT
Objective  To estimate the efficacy of exercise on 
depressive symptoms compared with non- active control 
groups and to determine the moderating effects of 
exercise on depression and the presence of publication 
bias.
Design  Systematic review and meta- analysis with 
meta- regression.
Data sources  The Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, 
SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were 
searched without language restrictions from inception 
to 13 September2022 (PROSPERO registration no 
CRD42020210651).
Eligibility criteria for selecting 
studies  Randomised controlled trials including 
participants aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis 
of major depressive disorder or those with depressive 
symptoms determined by validated screening measures 
scoring above the threshold value, investigating the 
effects of an exercise intervention (aerobic and/or 
resistance exercise) compared with a non- exercising 
control group.
Results  Forty- one studies, comprising 2264 participants 
post intervention were included in the meta- analysis 
demonstrating large effects (standardised mean 
difference (SMD)=−0.946, 95% CI −1.18 to −0.71) 
favouring exercise interventions which corresponds to the 
number needed to treat (NNT)=2 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.59). 
Large effects were found in studies with individuals 
with major depressive disorder (SMD=−0.998, 95% CI 
−1.39 to −0.61, k=20), supervised exercise interventions 
(SMD=−1.026, 95% CI −1.28 to −0.77, k=40) and 
moderate effects when analyses were restricted to low 
risk of bias studies (SMD=−0.666, 95% CI −0.99 to 
−0.34, k=12, NNT=2.8 (95% CI 1.94 to 5.22)).
Conclusion  Exercise is efficacious in treating 
depression and depressive symptoms and should be 
offered as an evidence- based treatment option focusing 
on supervised and group exercise with moderate 
intensity and aerobic exercise regimes. The small sample 
sizes of many trials and high heterogeneity in methods 
should be considered when interpreting the results.

INTRODUCTION
Depression  is  a  prevalent  and  disabling  disorder 
associated  with  reduced  quality  of  life,  medical 
comorbidity  and  mortality.1  2  Over  300  million 

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN?
 ⇒ Depression is the leading cause of disability 
worldwide with potentially increasing 
prevalence since the COVID- 19 pandemic, yet 
more than two thirds of adults diagnosed with 
depression remain untreated.

 ⇒ Exercise is an efficacious treatment option for 
reducing depressive symptoms for individuals 
with depression.

 ⇒ However, evidence reported by meta- analyses 
reveals heterogeneous effects and is not up to 
date.

WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS?
 ⇒ This methodologically sound systematic review 
and meta- analysis with meta- regression is 
the largest synthesis of the effect of exercise 
on major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
depressive symptoms covering 41 included 
studies, accounting for 2.264 adult participants 
postintervention.

 ⇒ Results show moderate to large effects of 

exercise on depressive symptoms even when 
limiting the analysis to low risk of bias studies 
or only MDD, although high heterogeneity 
among the studies was addressed with 
meta- regression.

 ⇒ Non- inferiority trials indicate that exercise is 

non- inferior to current first line treatments, and 
evidence that exercise is effective at long- term 
follow- ups are needed to clarify the identified 
evidence gaps.

people  live  with  depressive  disorder,  equating 
to  approximately  4.4%  of  the  world’s  popula-
tion.3  The  prevalence  of  depression  has  increased 
during the COVID- 19 pandemic4–7 by an estimated 
27.6%,7  highlighting  the  need  for  appropriate, 
accessible and cost- effective treatment options.8

treatments 

Currently,  recommended 

include 
psychotherapy  and  antidepressant  medication  (or 
a combination of both).9 However, psychotherapy 
achieves  remission  rates  of  only  50%  while  typi-
cally being cost- intensive.10 Side effects and relapses 
from antidepressant medication commonly occur11 
as can withdrawal symptoms.12 Importantly, about 
two thirds of adults with depression do not receive 
adequate  treatment.13  Untreated  depression  often

leads to intensification of the illness including the development 
of comorbidities resulting in even higher costs for society.14 This 
attests  to  the  need  for  rapid  and  readily  available  alternative 
treatment options.

Exercise has been recommended as an adjunct treatment for 
depression by both the WHO15 and National Institute for Health 
and  Care  Excellence  (NICE)  guidelines.16  Evidence  for  these 
recommendations included results from multiple meta- analyses 
investigating the antidepressant effect of exercise in people with 
depression.17–20 However, some of these meta- analyses18 21 found 
moderate, weak or no effects of exercise while others reported 
large  effects.17  19  20  These  mixed  results  stem  from  method-
ological and conceptual differences regarding inclusion criteria 
and  analytical  approaches.  For  example,  some  studies  focused 
on  individuals  with  a  diagnosis  of  major  depressive  disorder 
(MDD)  while  excluding  studies  that  evaluated  the  presence  of 
depression  based  on  validated  screening  measures.18  Others17 
investigated the effect of exercise alone or as a complementary 
treatment for depression to pharmacological therapy for studies 
published from 2003 to 2019. Further, some reviews included 
studies  where  patients  also  received  exercise  interventions21  in 
the control groups. This creates the potential for bias22 as even 
light intensity exercise can exert antidepressant effects. Impor-
tantly, a cause for concern has been raised in several reviews that 
exercise does not have a significant effect when restricted to ‘low 
risk  of  bias’  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  .18  21  There-
fore,  extant  meta- analyses  have  failed  to  provide  convincing 
evidence to enable clinicians globally to implement exercise as an 
evidence- based  effective  treatment  option  for  depression.  One 
meta- analysis20 addressed these methodological shortcomings by 
focusing on studies that included samples with depression using 
cut- offs  on  validated  screening  instruments  and  samples  with 
MDD  diagnosis  assessed  with  diagnostic  tools  and  including 
only studies that compared exercise versus non- active controls. 
The  authors  excluded  trials  comparing  different  exercise  regi-
mens.  However,  a  large  volume  of  studies  has  been  published 
within  the  last  5  years,  requiring  an  updated  meta- analysis  on 
the antidepressant effects of exercise, while addressing the short-
comings of previous reviews.

The objective of this meta‐analysis was to update the current 
evidence on the effects of exercise in reducing depressive symp-
toms  in  adults  with  clinically  elevated  levels  of  depression 
including  MDD  and  dysthymia,  comparing  exercise  with  non- 
exercising control groups. Additionally, we aimed to investigate 
the  potential  moderators  of  the  antidepressant  effects  of  exer-
cise, and the presence of publication bias.

METHODS
Search strategy and selection criteria
This  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  was  registered  in 
the  International  Prospective  Register  of  Systematic  Reviews 
(PROSPERO)  with  the  protocol  number  CRD42020210651. 
The PRISMA Statement was followed23 in its updated version24 
additionally  considering  the  PERSiST  guidance  (implementing 
PRISMA in Exercise, Rehabilitation, Sport medicine and SporTs 
science).25

To structure the eligibility criteria, the PICOS (Patient/Popu-
lation;  Intervention;  Comparison,  Outcome;  Study  design) 
approach  was  used.26  Eligible  for  this  meta- analysis  included 
studies  that:  (1)  Investigated  participants  aged  18  years  or 
older  with  a  primary  diagnosis  of  MDD  or  dysthymia  defined 
by  the  Research  Diagnostic  Criteria,24  Diagnostic  and  Statis-
tical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM- IV  or  DSM- 5)27  or 

2 of 10

International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD- 10)28  or  adults 
with  depressive  symptoms  determined  by  validated  screening 
measures  scoring  above  the  threshold  value  (eg,  Beck  Depres-
sion Inventory (BDI) or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
(HAM- D)).29 30 If scales did not have validated cut- offs, the cut- 
off used by the author was accepted. (2) Investigated an exercise 
intervention in the treatment of depression, where exercise was 
defined  as  planned,  structured,  repetitive  and  purposive  phys-
ical  activity  with  the  purpose  to  improve  or  maintain  physical 
fitness.31 Studies using yoga, tai chi or other mind- body activities 
were excluded, because the focus of such mind- body interven-
tions  are  behavioural  techniques  that  include,  but  not  limited 
to, deep breathing, meditation/mindfulness and self- awareness.32 
(3)  Included  a  non- exercising  control  group,  such  as  usual- 
care,  wait- list  control  conditions  or  placebo  pills.  Studies  with 
any other exercise intervention (such as stretching or low- dose 
exercise) as a comparator were excluded as well as control and 
intervention groups commencing standardised interventions (eg, 
psychotherapy, medication) at the beginning of the intervention 
even if this was applied to both intervention and control groups 
(eg, starting medication treatment at the beginning of the inter-
vention  in  both  groups).  However,  ongoing  treatments  started 
at  least  3  months  before  intervention  initiation  were  included. 
(4)  Examined  the  pre- post  effects  of  exercise  interventions  on 
depressive symptoms using a validated depression scale. (5) Were 
RCTs and were published in peer- reviewed journals or as part of 
a dissertation. Conference proceedings were not included.

An electronic search of the following databases was conducted: 
Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL), 
PubMed,  MEDLINE,  Embase,  SPORTDiscus  and  PsycINFO 
without any (eg, language or date) restrictions from inception to 
13 September 2022. The search used a range of relevant terms 
to  capture  all  potentially  eligible  results  relating  to  exercise 
interventions for depressive symptoms (for the full list of search 
terms,  see  online  supplemental  text  1).  Duplicate  references 
were  removed  electronically  and  manually.  To  identify  unpub-
lished or ongoing studies, clinical  trials. gov (www.clinicaltrials. 
gov) was searched. Additionally, reference lists of all eligible arti-
cles of recent reviews investigating the effectiveness of exercise 
versus control were screened to identify potentially eligible arti-
cles. All manuscripts were reviewed by at least two independent 
reviewers. Three reviewers (NS/LLB, DH) independently deter-
mined potentially eligible articles meeting the inclusion criteria 
using the titles and abstracts. Three independent reviewers (NS/
LLB, DH) then applied the eligibility criteria after obtaining the 
full texts and generated a final list of included articles through 
consensus.  If  full- texts  were  not  available,  study  authors  were 
contacted to provide them. Five investigators (NS/ LLB, DH, FS, 
AH)  judged  article  eligibility  with  any  disagreements  resolved 
through discussion.

Data extraction
Data  extraction  was  done  by  three  reviewers  (NS/  LLB,  DH) 
independently. A systematic extraction form was used for each 
article to collect the following data: (1) sample description (eg, 
sample size, mean age of participants); (2) intervention features 
(eg, type of exercise, length of trial); (3) methodological factors 
(eg,  risk  of  bias,  instruments  used  for  diagnosis  and  symptom 
assessment); (4) effects on depressive symptoms (eg, changes in 
total depressive symptoms scored before and after intervention). 
For  further  information  of  extracted  data  see  online  supple-
mental tables 1, 4 and 5.

Heissel A, et al. Br J Sports Med 2023;57:1049–1057. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2022-106282Primary outcome
The primary outcome was the mean change in depressive symp-
toms in the exercise compared with the control group from base-
line to postintervention. The primary outcome proposed by the 
authors was selected if two or more instruments were used.

Study quality assessment
Selected studies were assessed by three independent authors (NS/ 
LLB, DH) given an overall estimation of risk of bias (ie, low risk, 
some concerns or high risk) according to the revised Cochrane 
risk- of- bias  tool  for  randomised  trials  (RoB2).33  According  to 
RoB2,  the  following  domains  were  considered  for  the  assess-
ment  of  risk  of  bias:  randomisation  process,  deviations  from 
intended  interventions,  missing  outcome  data,  measurement 
of the outcome and selection of the reported result (see online 
supplemental table 3).

Data-analysis
A random effects meta- analysis was calculated due to expected 
heterogeneity.  The  standardised  mean  difference  (SMD)  and 
95% CIs were used as the effect size (ES) measure. The SMD was 
calculated  using  the  difference  from  pre  to  post  intervention34 
with  correlations  of  0.7  between  the  exercise  and  the  control 
group. All results were calculated on an intention- to- treat basis. 
Heterogeneity  was  calculated  using  the  I2.35  Sensitivity  anal-
yses  with  pre- post- correlations  of  0.6  and  0.8  were  calculated 
to  investigate  changes  in  effect  with  less  or  more  conservative 
values.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  further  calculated  excluding 
one study due to unequal distribution of psychotherapy among 
the intervention  and  control  group and excluding studies  with 
high risk for bias. Potential moderators (see table 1) of the anti-
depressant  effects  of  exercise  were  investigated  using  linear 
meta- regression  analyses  for  all  studies  and,  separately,  for 
studies  including  only  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  MDD  and/
or dysthymia. Meta- regression assumptions were tested in JASP. 
Subgroup analyses were calculated to estimate the effect across 
depression  classification,  risk  of  bias,  differing  control  condi-
tions, intensity of exercise, exercise type, exercising in a group 
or individually, sample sizes and supervision (by different super-
visors). We also calculated the mean difference (MD) on studies 
that assessed depressive symptoms using the Hamilton scale for 
depression  or  the  BDI  separately.  Significance  level  was  set  at 
0.05.36  Publication  bias  was  assessed  with  visual  inspection  of 
funnel  plots  and  with  the  Begg- Mazumdar  Kendall’s  tau37  and 
Egger bias test.38 Whenever significant, the Duval and Tweedie 
Trim and Fill was applied.39 Fail safe number of negative studies 
that would be required to nullify (ie, make p>0.05) the ES were 
calculated.40 All analyses were performed using Comprehensive 
Meta- Analysis software,38 and number needed to treat (NNT)41 
analyses were calculated using Lenhard and Lenhard42 with the 
formula of converting Cohens’ d to NNT from Furukawa and 
Leucht.43 Additionally, studies reporting (severe) adverse events 
and side effects were listed.

RESULTS
Search results
Searching of databases yielded 15 734 studies and an additional 
84  studies  were  identified  through  other  sources.  Following 
removal of duplicates, 7100 potentially eligible studies remained 
for which abstracts were screened. At full text stage, 207 studies 
were  reviewed  and  166  removed  because  they  failed  to  meet 
inclusion criteria (see online supplemental table 2 for references 

Review

and exclusion reasons). The remaining 41 studies were included 
in the review and quantitative synthesis (see figure 1).

Study characteristics
In  total,  2544  participants  are  included  in  the  review  and  2264 
completed treatments (post- treatment n) and were included in the 
meta- analytical calculations, 1227 in intervention groups and 1037 
in  control  groups.  Twenty- one  studies  assessed  depressive  symp-
toms,44–64 while MDD was diagnosed in 20 studies.65–84 Percentage 
of females ranged from 26% to 100%, mean age from 18.8 to 87.9 
years.  Of  the  41  included  RCTs,  studies  originated  from  North 
and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. See online supple-
mental table 1 for characteristics of selected studies (further char-
acteristics are summarised in online supplemental tables 4 and 5).

Risk of bias
Risk  of  bias  assessment  revealed  12  studies  to  be  rated  of  low 
risk of bias,49 58 60 65 66 68–70 74 79 80 82 while 7 were rated with some 
concerns.44 45 48 51 55 73 76 For 22 studies, RoB2 indicated high risk 
for bias.46 47 50 52–54 56 57 59 61–64 67 71 72 75 77 78 81 83 84 For full details, 
see online supplemental table 3.

Main analysis
The  main  analysis  of  pooled  data  from  41  studies  showed 
a  large  effect  favouring  exercise  for  a  pre- post- correlation 
of  0.7  (SMD=−0.946,  95%  CI  −1.18  to  −0.71,  p<0.001, 
I2=82.49,  p<0.001;  see  figure  2).  Publication  bias  was 
indicated  by  Begg- Mazumdar  Kendall’s  Tau37  (=−0.379, 
p<0.001 and the Egger38 tests (intercept=−2.706, p<0.001). 
However,  Duval  and  Tweedies’  trim  and  fill  method  did  not 
affect  the  effect.  Fail- safe  number  of  additional  negative 
studies  was  2789.  The  visual  inspection  of  the  funnel  plot 
(see  online  supplemental  figure  1)  did  not  indicate  risk  of 
bias. Sensitivity analyses revealed a trivial change in the effect 
from −0.930 (95% CI −1.16 to −0.70, p<0.001, I2=82.032, 
p<0.001)  for  a  0.8  pre- post- correlation  to  −0.957  (95%  CI 
−1.19  to  −0.72,  p<0.001,  I2=82.820,  p<0.001)  for  a  0.6 
pre- post- correlation.  Excluding  one  study74  due  to  unequal 
distribution of psychotherapy treatments among the interven-
tion and control group (20% vs 0%, respectively) revealed an 
effect of SMD=−0.938 (95% CI −1.17 to −0.70, p<0.001, 
I2=82.703,  p<0.001).  Excluding  studies  with  high  risk  of 
bias  (see  online  supplemental  table  3)  rendered  a  moderate 
effect favouring exercise intervention (SMD=−0.717, 95% CI 
−1.01 to −0.43, p<0.001, I2=82.372, p<0.001). Excluding 
studies  with  less  than  6  weeks  of  intervention  (see  online 
supplemental  table  1)  showed  a  large  effect  favouring  exer-
cise  intervention  (SMD=−0.959,  95%  CI  −1.21  to  −0.71, 
p<0.001,  I2=84.132,  p<0.001).  I2  is  suggesting  substantial 
heterogeneity for the analyses.

Subgroup analyses
Subgroup  analyses  (summarised  in  table  1)  showed  that  the 
beneficial  effect  of  exercise  on  depression  remained  for  all 
subgroups  regarding  depression  classification,  risk  of  bias, 
group  exercise,  the  sample  size  of  the  trial  and  supervision 
by exercise professionals. Aerobic (SMD=−1.156) and resis-
tance training (−1.042) as exercise types showed large effects 
whereas  mixed  aerobic  and  resistance  training  showed  small 
effects  (−0.455).  Large  effects  were  also  found  for  studies 
including sample sizes in the intervention arm of less than 25 
participants (SMD=−0.868 to −1.281) whereas larger samples 
of  participants  revealed  moderate  effects  (SMD=−0.532).

Meta-regression
Meta- regression (see table 2) was calculated for the main analysis 
and MDD only. In the main analysis, duration of trial in weeks 
moderated  the  effect  of  exercise  on  depression,  with  shorter 
trials  associated  with  larger  effects  (β=0.032,  95%  CI  0.01  to 
0.09,  p=0.032,  R²=0.06).  For  MDD  only,  higher  antidepres-
sant use by the control group was associated with smaller effects 
(β=−0.013, 95% CI −0.02 to −0.01, p=0.012, R²=0.28). A 
meta- regression with studies with low and moderate risk of bias 
(see online supplemental table 8) rendered a moderating effect 
of duration of trials overall (β=0.064, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.126, 
p=0.04, R²=0.12) as well as for MDD only (β=0.070, 95% CI 
0.01 to 0.14, p=0.034, R²=0.26).

Mean change and numbers needed to treat (NNT)
We  found  a  mean  change  of  −4.70  points  (95%  CI  −6.25  to 
−3.15,  p<0.001,  n=685)  on  the  HAM- D  and  for  the  BDI  of 
−6.49  points  (95%  CI  −8.55  to  −4.42,  p<0.001,  n=275)  as 
an additional improvement effect of exercise over control condi-
tions. The calculated NNT was 2.0 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.59) for 
the main- analysis, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.94 to 5.22) for the low risk 
of bias studies. For MDD, only the NNT was 1.9 (95% CI 1.49 
to 2.99) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.58 to 2.41) in supervision by other 
professionals/students.

DISCUSSION
This is the largest meta- analysis investigating the effects of exer-
cise for depressive symptoms within samples with diagnosed or 
indicated depression. Among 41 RCTs, we found that exercise 
interventions had a large effect favouring exercise over control 
conditions.  Publication  bias  tests  indicate  an  underestimation 
of this effect. Subgroup analyses resolved several key questions 
that  lacked  clarity  from  previous  reviews;17–20  specifically,  the 

positive effect of exercise remained significant regardless of risk 
of  bias,  depression  classification,  exercise  type,  group  setting, 
type  of  supervision  or  sample  size.  Subgroup  analyses  with 
health education (k=3), with light exercise interventions (k=2) 
or with unsupervised training (k=6) showed comparable SMDs 
but  no  statistical  significance,  which  can  be  attributable  to  the 
lack of power due to the small numbers of studies included in 
the  subgroup  analyses.  Surprisingly,  the  combination  of  mixed 
aerobic  and  resistance  training  showed  smaller  effects  than 
aerobic  or  resistance  training  as  single  interventions.  We  also 
found a decline in ES  from large  to moderate  for  studies  with 
sample sizes in the intervention arm of 25 or more participants. 
Focusing on solely diagnosed MDD, significant effects of exer-
cise  were  found  for  all  subgroup  analyses  except  for  light  and 
mixed exercise, unsupervised training and for studies with some 
concern for risk of bias which can again be attributable to a lack 
of  power  due  to  the  small  number  of  included  studies  in  the 
analyses (k=2 to 3). Limiting analyses to studies with low risk of 
bias and some concerns according to ROB 2 reveal similar results 
but with ESs declining from high to moderate for most analyses 
(see online supplemental table 6). Meta- regressions indicated a 
moderating  effect  of  trial  duration  favouring  shorter  interven-
tions  and  remained  robust  in  meta- regressions  without  studies 
of  high  risk  of  bias.  Regarding  the  type  of  exercise,  most  trial 
arms (k=30) investigated aerobic exercise detecting large effects 
followed  by  resistance  training  with  comparable  outcomes.  In 
terms of the exercise intensity, only two arms investigated light 
intensity exercise while 26 and 10 trials applied moderate and 
vigorous  intensity  respectively,  with  all  trials  evidencing  large 
effects.  Supervised  exercise  revealed  large  ESs  compared  with 
unsupervised  exercise  with  small  effects.  Minimal  differences 
were detected between group and non- group exercise interven-
tions favouring group exercise, with both showing large effects.

Intervention  arms  with  samples  sizes  ≥25  revealed  moderate 
effects (see table 1 for details).

A recent meta- analysis of Cuijpers et al85 found a moderate ES 
for psychotherapy treatment for depression across all age groups 
(g=0.75), and also when solely including studies with low risk of 
bias (g=0.51); while in terms of antidepressant efficacy, Cipriani 
et  al86  found  medication  to  be  more  effective  in  comparison 
to  placebo  with  Odds  ratio  of  2.13  indicating  a  small  ES  of 
d=0.417. This is notable as the presented results suggest exer-
cise to qualify as an efficacious treatment option for depressive 
symptoms among individuals with depression.

These  results  extend  the  findings  from  an  earlier  meta- 
analysis  of  Schuch  et  al20  (based  on  25  studies  including  1487 
participants,  revealing  high  heterogeneity  of  I2  82.10%). 
Notably,  the  present  findings  are  based  on  an  additional  17 
studies44  45  48  52  53  55  59  62  67–69  71  74  78  79  84  since  Schuch  et  al’s20 
review  and  445  55  68  74  studies  following  the  most  recent  meta- 
analysis by Carneiro et al,17 comprising only 15 studies focusing 
on different inclusion criteria including medication in treatment 
and control arm conditions.

In contrast to Krogh et al,18 the analyses including only low 
risk of bias studies resulted in moderate effects with wide 95% 
CIs ranging from −0.99 to −0.34. Of note, we used the current 
risk of bias tool (RoB2) and included a greater number of low 
risk  of  bias  trials  compared  with  Krogh  et  al’s18  meta- analysis 
(11  vs  4).  To  reduce  risk  of  bias,  we  compared  exercise  treat-
ment groups with non- exercising control groups only. From the 
included 35 trials in the Cochrane Meta- Analysis by Cooney et 
al21 consisting of 1356 participants, they reported 63% hetero-
geneity for the main analyses, the current review excluded 13 of 
these studies as groups were labelled as either ‘controls’ (ie, they 
received psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy) or groups labelled 
as ‘exercise’ groups (ie, they received a combination of exercise 
and  another  form  of  therapy  or  no  therapy  at  all)  or  partici-
pants did not meet criteria for depression (see Ref. 22 for a crit-
ical appraisal). Krogh et al18 also included 35 trials comprising 
2498  participants  with  high  heterogeneity  (I2=81%)  of  which 
the current review excluded 17 studies with control groups that 
received stretching, relaxation or compared exercise to psycho-
therapy,  medication  or  combined  exercise  with  psychotherapy. 
Morres et al19 included 11 trials involving 455 patients revealing 
low and non- statistically significant heterogeneity (I²=21%) but 
focused on aerobic exercise only; however, five of these studies 
were  excluded  from  the  current  review  because  they  included 
medication, active control conditions or cognitive or counselling 
therapy as comparator conditions. Carneiro et al17 included 15 
studies  in  their  meta- analysis  with  a  total  sample  size  of  1532 
individuals  focusing  on  pharmacological  treatment,  exercise 
treatment and combined exercise with psychotherapy, of which 
the  current  review  excluded  7  studies  due  to  the  inclusion  of 
pharmacological therapy as a comparator condition either alone 
or in combination with psychotherapy. A further study was also 
excluded because participants were offered internet guided text 
modules on how to become more physically active but no actual 
exercise intervention was administered. Carneiro et al.17 overall 
reported moderate heterogeneity (I²= 33%).

This  summary  reveals  that  a  notable  methodological  limita-
tion based on the former published meta- analyses in this field, 
included  a  proportion  of  trials  with  questionable  intervention 
or  control  group  conditions,  which  resulted  in  the  inability  to 
detect the effect of exercise per se (while excluding other forms 
of interventions). Hence, this notable shortcoming was addressed 
in  this  current  meta- analytic  review.  Although  we  explored 
heterogeneity  with  sub- analyses  and  meta  regression,  we  also 

Review

found similar large heterogeneity comparable to previous larger 
meta- analyses18  20  21  which  guarantees  comparability,  yet  needs 
to be considered when interpreting the results.

Our meta- regressions indicated that shorter trials are associ-
ated with larger effects than longer trials. A possible explanation 
is that larger trials had more dropouts, and higher dropout rates 
can  reduce  the  effect  in  intention  to  treat  analyses.87  Alterna-
tively, it is possible that the effect wanes with the time. However, 
all but three studies had interventions lasting 16  weeks or  less 
and further studies with longer follow- ups should confirm this 
effect.88 Also, we have found that studies in which control groups 
had  a  higher  percentage  of  participants  taking  antidepressants 
identified  smaller  effects  of  exercise.  This  is  expected  as  the 
difference on the magnitude of the improvement on depressive 
symptoms  is  smaller  when  exercise  is  compared  with  effective 
treatments, such as the use of pharmacological antidepressants, 
or when compared with controls without any treatment.87

Clinical implications included that if 100 people were each in 
the control and the exercise group, 20 participants in the control 
and 54 in the exercise group for the main analysis and 43 in the 
exercise group for the low risk of bias studies, analyses can be 
expected to have favourable outcomes.89 The NNT for the main- 
analysis was 2, while it was 2.8 in the low risk of bias studies, 
1.9 in MDD only and 1.6 in supervision by other professionals/
students. This effect is comparable to recent meta- analyses with 
psychotherapy revealing a NNT of 2.5 for the main analyses and 
3.5 in the low risk of bias studies and for medication of 4.3.85 86 
Based on a NNT of 2 for the main analyses this means that for 
every  two  people  treated  with  exercise,  it  is  expected  at  least 
one  to  have  a  large  magnitude  reduction  in  depressive  symp-
toms.43  Furthermore,  exercise  showed  an  additional  declining 
effect  over  control  conditions  of  −4.70  points  in  the  HAM- D 
as a diagnostic clinician measure in 16 studies and −6.49 in the 
BDI in eight studies indicating a clinically meaningful reduction 
of  depressive  symptoms  from  moderate  to  mild  depression. 
According to the NICE guidelines, a three- point change is indi-
cated as clinically meaningful for both measures.16

Limitations
We  acknowledge  that  limitations  lie  in  the  high  heteroge-
neity  of  the  included  studies  that  can  stem  from  different 
control  group  conditions,  cultural  backgrounds,  gender 
distribution,  variable  forms  of  assessments  and  diagnosis 
of  depression  severity  or  MDD.  Notwithstanding,  we  have 
performed  several  subgroup  analyses  and  meta- regressions 
to  explore  the  sources  of  this  heterogeneity.  Additionally, 
most of the included studies comprised small sample sizes for 
example,  13  studies  with  intervention  arms  of  ≤10  partic-
ipants  in  each  group  postintervention  which  we  addressed 
with subanalyses. However, studies with larger samples sizes 
showed smaller but still moderate effects. Some subanalyses 
showed  non- significant  results  as  they  lacked  power  due 
to  the  small  number  of  studies  included.  In  principle,  the 
overreliance  of  significance  testing  should  be  avoided  and 
interpretation  of  results  based  on  SMD  and  95%  CI  along 
with  p  values.  Mostly  seen  wider  ranges  in  CIs  within  the 
analyses can stem to a large extent from smaller studies (eg, 
10  studies  with  n<10)  and  small  number  of  studies  in  the 
subanalyses  (especially  less  than  k=10)  which  brings  some 
uncertainty  pertaining  to  the  true  effect.  However,  for  the 
main analyses, 95% CIs were documented for exercise condi-
tions comprising moderate intensity, aerobic exercise, group 
exercise and supervised exercise (ranging between 26 and 41

included  studies),  thus  indicating  moderate  to  large  effects 
even for the lower limits. These outcomes provide adequate 
evidence  to  support  the  recommendation  that  exercise  has 
utility  in  treating  depression  based  on  the  aforementioned 
conditions. Long- term effects could not be investigated due 
to missing follow- up data for most studies. Moreover, it was 
not possible to control for placebo effects due to the nature 
of the interventions. Furthermore, 6 out of the 41 included 
studies  were  published  prior  to  2001  and  can  therefore  be 
assigned  to  the  pre- CONSORT  era.  This  means  that  these 
earlier  trials  might  not  reflect  the  current  standards  and/or 
feature incomplete reporting of methodological details that 
was  introduced  with  the  CONSORT  guidelines  and  check-
list, therefore increasing scope in biased risk assessments and 
heterogeneity.22 90

Further steps need to be undertaken to consider exercise as 
a first- line treatment for depression alongside psychotherapy 
and  medication,  including  conducting  non- inferiority  trials 
to  demonstrate  that  exercise  is  non- inferior  to  current  first 
line  treatments,  and  evidence  that  exercise  is  effective  at 
long- term  follow- ups.  Future  large- scale  research  studies 
should  also  investigate  which  patients  benefit  most  from 
which exercise condition and identify any groups for whom 
exercise might not be the optimal treatment choice. It is note-
worthy  that  the  studies  included  in  the  current  and  former 
reviews  consisted  of  samples  which  met  the  trial  inclusion 
criteria comprising individuals that were willing, motivated 
and physically able to take part in the exercise regimen (eg, 
assessed by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire91) 
and  excluded  individuals  with  diagnoses  that  exercise  may 
pose  a  risk  (for  example,  individuals  with  cardiovascular 
diseases  that  require  physician  guidance  to  undertake  exer-
cise).  Further,  adverse  events  and  outcomes  due  to  exer-
cise  may  occur  in  rare  instances  (nevertheless,  they  should 
be reported which was not documented for the majority of 
studies  in  this  review),  and  not  everyone  has  access  to  any 
form of exercise or exercise with the needed quality (eg, with 
a  former  sport  medical  examination).  It  is  also  noteworthy 
that  the  included  studies  were  mainly  conducted  in  high- 
income  and  upper- middle  income  countries,  for  example, 
no  study  was  identified  from  the  African  continent.  Future 
study designs should consider these relevant points including 
motivational aspects of attendance and samples from devel-
oping countries or rural areas to increase the generalisability 
of the results for healthcare.

Further  strengthening  the  evidence  base  for  exercise  also 
has  utility  as  it  may  be  a  less  stigmatising  treatment  option 
for depressed individuals who may be reluctant to seek and 
adhere to psychotherapy and/or medication.

CONCLUSION
The findings from this review represent the most up to date 
and  comprehensive  meta- analysis  of  the  available  evidence 
and further supports the use of exercise focusing specifically 
on  supervised  and  group  exercise  with  moderate  intensity 
and aerobic exercise regimes. This offers a further evidence- 
based  treatment  option  for  the  large  amount  of  untreated 
individuals  with  depression,  including  individuals  who 
refuse  or  cannot  tolerate  medication  and/or  psychotherapy. 
However, given the high heterogeneity and mainly small and 
selected  samples  of  the  included  studies,  this  requires  indi-
vidual  decisions  involving  the  treating  physician  to  deter-
mine  if  and  which  conditions  of  exercise  are  the  optimal 

8 of 10

treatment  of  choice  while  also  recognising  the  potential 
synergistic effects of exercise in managing both physical and 
mental  well- being.  Updated  guidelines  as  well  as  routine 
clinical decisions regarding interventions for treating depres-
sion should consider the current findings. This is particularly 
timely,  following  the  post  COVID- 19  pandemic,  given  that 
rates of depression have continued to increase worldwide.
