This guide explains what mental health crisis services are available, how they can help and when to access them. It also explains how you can plan for a crisis. If you're feeling in crisis right now, see ouremergency advice.


## What's a mental health crisis?


A mental health crisis is when you feel at breaking point, and you need urgent help. You might be:

- feeling extremelyanxiousand havingpanic attacksorflashbacks

- feelingsuicidal, orself-harming

- having an episode ofhypomania or mania,(feeling very high) orpsychosis(maybehearing voices,or feeling veryparanoid).

You might be dealing withbereavement, addiction,abuse,money problems, relationship breakdown,workplace stress,exam stress, orhousing problems. You might be managing amental health diagnosis. Or you might not know why you're feeling this way now.


## Planning for a mental health crisis


Nobody plans to be in crisis.You might not like the idea of planning for something you hope won't happen. But it could help to think about what you could do if you start to feel in crisis in the future, and what kind of support might help.

Learn about crisis planning


## What crisis services are there?


Exploring different types of support might be something you feel able to do at less difficult times. There’s no wrong order to try things in – different things work for different people at different times. But some types of support might be more suitable for you, or more easily available.

Most of the guys at my local crisis team are brilliant. Even when they've already seen me in A&E three times that week it still feels as important.


### Going to hospital or A&E for mental health treatment


During a crisis, staying in hospital might be the best way to keep you safe and get you with the level of treatment you need.

Learn about hospital or A&E


### Emergency GP appointments


Your local GP surgery should offer you an appointment quickly if you need urgent support. You don't need to be registered as a patient already.

How to get help from your GP


### Mental health helplines


Helplines provide trained listeners and often have other options for getting in touch, like email, text messaging or web chat.

Learn about helplines

Crisis houses offer intensive, short-term support in a residential setting.

Learn about crisis houses


### Crisis teams (CRHTs)


Crisis teams support people who might otherwise need to go to hospital. They can support you during a crisis if you're already under their care.

Learn about crisis teams

Day services can be helpful if you're managing a mental health crisis at home.
