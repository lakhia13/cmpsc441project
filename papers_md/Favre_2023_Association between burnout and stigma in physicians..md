Online questionnaires were sent to medical doctors working in five different departments of
the Geneva University Hospital. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess
burnout. The Stigma of Occupational Stress Scale in Doctors (SOSS-D) was used to mea-
sure the three stigma dimensions. Three hundred and eight physicians participated in the
survey (response rate: 34%). Physicians with burnout (47%) were more likely to hold stig-
matized views. Emotional exhaustion was moderately correlated with perceived structural
stigma (r = 0.37, P < .001) and weakly correlated with perceived stigma (r = 0.25, P =
0.011). Depersonalization was weakly correlated with personal stigma (r = 0.23, P = 0.04)
and perceived other stigma (r = 0.25, P = 0.018).

Conclusion

These results suggest the need to adjust for existing burnout and stigma management. Fur-
ther research needs to be conducted on how high burnout and stigmatization impact collec-
tive burnout, stigmatization, and treatment delay.

PLOS ONEAssociation between burnout and stigma in physicians

1. Introduction

Physician burnout is widely defined as emotional exhaustion, a decreased sense of meaning at
work, feelings of ineffectiveness, and the dehumanization of others [1,2]. Burnout is an impor-
tant issue among medical doctors, with a prevalence of 25–65% [3–5]. The Physicians Founda-
tion (USA) (2020 survey) reported that 58% of physicians often have feelings of burnout,
compared to 40% in 2018. Burnout among physicians may lead to decreased empathy and
attention toward patients [6,7], the decline in mental health among doctors, depression, sub-
stance abuse, suicide [8,9], and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease [10]. “The burned-out
physician” is described as “angry, irritable, impatient” and “having increased absenteeism,
decreased productivity, and providing decreased quality of care” [11]. Burnout can impact
quality of care by poor medical knowledge [12], less thorough therapeutic discussions, less ade-
quate or even erroneous prescriptions, particularly among internal medicine residents [13–
15]. Burnout in medical doctors can represent a high cost, as it is also related to early depar-
tures [4,12] and an increased desire to change professions [16]. Medical turnover about job
dissatisfaction increases the costs of recruiting and retaining doctors [12,17] and decreases
cohesion in the institution [18].

Burnout is associated with environmental factors, such as a high prevalence of occupational

stress among physicians [19–21]. Heavy schedules, working time, stress, and regular on-call
duties are different factors that can promote burnout [22,23]. On a more general level, the
healthcare system is often experienced as inequitable, focused on financial profitability, and
dehumanized [24]. Pressure to lower costs and increase productivity can induce burnout
among medical doctors, who are caught between profitability requirements and their contact
with people suffering [25]. Publication pressure for doctors engaged in academic careers or
poorly supervised technical acts have also been mentioned as risk factors [26]. On the personal
level, the imbalance between work and private life can produce potential conflicts between
professional and personal choices, usually solved in favor of professional life [27]. These diffi-
culties can occur in fragile social realities, such as marital or financial difficulties, or in the iso-
lation of doctors from abroad [10].

Stigma refers to negative social attitudes that are attached to a disapproved mark in an

individual.

Link & Phelan [28] conceptualized the mechanisms of stigmatization. The first mechanism
(“direct discrimination”) involved attitudes and beliefs producing direct discriminatory behav-
iors. The second mechanism (“structural discrimination”) involved structural inequalities pro-
ducing covert discrimination. The third mechanism (“social psychological processes”)
involved self-stigmatization producing self-devalued behaviors. These interrelated mecha-
nisms can reciprocally increase, leading to detrimental consequences for the stigmatized
individuals

Stigma is a barrier to help-seeking, and many physicians experiencing burnout will not be
treated or experience delay in treatment [29–31]. In medical culture, burnout is highly stigma-
tized because physicians tend to consider their state of health, especially mental health, as an
indicator of their medical competence. A doctor suffering from burnout may be perceived by
their peers and by their selves as weak and incompetent [10,32]. Stigma has been defined as
including different components: personal, perceived other, and perceived structural stigma
[33]. Personal stigma refers to personal stigmatizing attitudes held toward other people
experiencing occupational stress and burnout, perceived other stigma is defined as a person’s
beliefs about the stigmatizing attitudes held by other people. Perceived structural stigma repre-
sents policies and practices that restrict the opportunities or well-being of the stigmatized per-
son [33].

Nearchou et al. [34] reported the importance of separately investigating the different types
of stigmas when predicting help-seeking interventions. They showed that public stigma was a
stronger predictor of help-seeking intentions for depression in adolescents than personal
stigma. Bracke et al. [35] also stressed the need to distinguish between the different types of
stigmas. They reported that dominant beliefs about stigma within a culture decreased the like-
lihood of seeking help from mental health professionals compared to individuals’ personal
beliefs regarding stigma. To improve help-seeking among physicians, the effects and interrela-
tionships between these types of stigmas and burnout must be investigated. More profound
knowledge of stigmatizing thoughts and erroneous beliefs is essential to reduce the barriers to
treatment, improve the prevention and management of burnout in medical doctors, as well as
increasing the quality of care. Addressing and challenging stigma may result in better out-
comes for physicians and patients alike [36]. However, very little data are available concerning
the stigma of burnout among medical doctors.

This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between stigma and burnout
symptomatology among medical doctors working in a university hospital and, more specifi-
cally, between the dimensions of stigma and burnout. We hypothesized that:1) personal stigma
could be associated with emotional exhaustion as a defense or denial of one’s own emotional
difficulties; 2) perceived other stigma could be related to depersonalization and development
of negative interpersonal attitudes toward patients and/or colleagues, as beliefs about others’
stigmatizing attitudes and negative attitudes toward others can enhance each other in a loop;
and 3) perceived structural stigma could be correlated with personal accomplishment, as per-
ceived restriction and loss of confidence can interact in a vicious circle.

These hypotheses are issued from Link & Phelans’ discrimination model integrated with

the Maslach model of burnout.

2. Methods
2.1 Participants and setting

This study was conducted in five academic departments at Geneva University Hospital
(HUG). Psychiatry, internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology.
Nine hundred and sixty-one residents, fellows, and attending physicians were invited to com-
plete an electronic survey via email. They received two reminders over three months. Partici-
pation in the study was voluntary and there was no compensation for completing the
questionnaire. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Geneva
University Hospital. Written informed consent for the study was obtained from all partici-
pants. All survey responses were anonymous. After completion of the survey, mental health
resources were provided to the participants if needed.

2.2 Measurement of burnout and stigma

Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) [37]. The French version of
this 22-item self-report scale is answered on a 6-point Likert scale (from “never” to “every
day”) [38]. The scale measures three dimensions: emotional exhaustion (feeling of emotional
annihilation of resources and loss of motivation), depersonalization (development of negative
interpersonal attitudes toward patients and/or colleagues with loss of empathy, irritability, and
cynicism), and personal accomplishment (loss of confidence in one’s competence with the
idea of being unable to achieve one’s work successfully. Higher scores on emotional exhaustion
(� 27) and depersonalization (� 1) and low scores on personal accomplishment (�33) are
indicative of greater burnout [39].

PLOS ONEAssociation between burnout and stigma in physicians

Stigma was assessed using the Stigma of Occupational Stress Scale for Doctors (SOSS-D)
[33]. It is an 11-item self-report scale that measures three dimensions of stigmatization: per-
ceived structural stigma (addresses stigma of stress and burnout within the context of struc-
tural influences operating in the workplace, policies, and practices that restrict the
opportunities or well-being of the stigmatized physician), personal stigma (personal stigmatiz-
ing attitudes held toward other people experiencing occupational stress and burnout), and per-
ceived other stigma (addresses a physician’s beliefs about the stigmatizing attitudes held by
other physicians). The scale was developed based on stigma-related barriers to help-seeking in
the medical profession. It was meant to improve the understanding of stigma in this popula-
tion and assist in designing strategies to enhance help-seeking among physicians. Responses
are recorded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” In
the French version of the scale, five items compose the “perceived structural stigma subscale”
(3*, 5, 6, 8, 9*), and two of them (*) are intended to be reverse-scored. Three items compose
the “personal stigma” subscale (1, 7, and 11), and three the “perceived other stigma” subscale
(2, 4, and 10). The SOSS-D was translated into French (and back-translated) and piloted with
12 physicians. After the initial adjustments to the translation, the scale was administered to
323 physicians. The internal consistency coefficient for the French SOSS-D was 0.72 and ran-
ged from 0.55 to 0.75 for the three subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated an accept-
able but imperfect fit of the hypothesized measurement model (root mean square error of
approximation 0.89, comparative fit index 0.867). The results provide evidence of the validity
and reliability of the French version of the SOSS-D.

2.3 Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to show the respective means of the different burnout and
stigma subscales. The stigma scale was stratified by burnout status and mean comparison of
both groups. Associations between the subscales were made using univariate associations that
included all three MBI subscales as interdependent covariates, with all variables standardized
to mean 0 and variance 1. Adjusted associations were obtained from multiple linear regression
models that included all three MBI subscales as covariates, with all variables normalized to
mean 0 and variance 1 (equivalent to partial correlation coefficients). Attenuation correction
was performed by dividing each partial correlation coefficient by the square root of the prod-
uct of the internal consistency coefficients of the corresponding scales. All analyses were con-
ducted using Stata SE 16 for Macintosh [40].

3. Results
3.1 Participants

Three hundred and eight physicians participated in the survey (response rate: 34%). Sixty-two
percent (62%) of the 308 physicians who completed the demographic portion of the survey
were women. Most participants (77%) were in a personal relationship. The mean age was 38.6
years (SD = 9.2). Forty percent of the participants were residents, 36.8% were fellows, and 23%
were attending physicians. They had practiced for an average of 12.5 (SD = 9.4) years. Internal
medicine physicians represented 29% of the participants, followed by psychiatrists (23%),
pediatricians (22%), family medicine physicians (21%), and obstetricians & gynecologists
(5%).

3.3 Perceived stigma in physicians stratified by the presence of burnout

Of the 308 physicians who participated in the study, 163 (53%) did not meet the criteria for
burnout. Participants were considered burnt out if both their emotional exhaustion and deper-
sonalization scores were high, while their personal accomplishment scores were low. A com-
parison of the mean scores of burnout by stigma is presented in Fig 1.

Physicians with burnout were more likely to hold stigmatized views than those without
burnout syndrome. Physicians without burnout were more likely to score high on item 9.
There was no statistically significant difference in item 3 between the groups. Items 3 and 9 are
part of the perceived structural stigma subscale and are both intended to be reverse-scored.

4. Association between burnout and stigma in physicians

Table 2 shows Pearson’s correlation between each of the stigma dimensions and burnout
dimensions. Emotional exhaustion was moderately correlated with perceived structural stigma
and weakly associated with perceived other stigma. Depersonalization was weakly related to
personal stigma and perceived other stigma. Personal accomplishment was not correlated with
any dimension of stigma.

Thus, perceived other stigma and depersonalization were associated as hypothesized. How-
ever, the results do not confirm our other hypotheses. Personal stigma was not associated with
emotional exhaustion, but with depersonalization. Perceived structural stigma was not associ-
ated with personal accomplishment, but with emotional exhaustion.

5. Discussion

This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between burnout dimensions and
stigma among physicians working in a university hospital. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to address these issues in this context. Overall, our results show a link between
stigma and burnout among burnt out physicians. Still, our results do not confirm our assump-
tions of dimension-by-dimension association: emotional exhaustion was moderately corre-
lated with perceived structural stigma and weakly correlated with perceived other stigma but
not with personal stigma. Depersonalization was associated with personal and other perceived
stigmas. Personal accomplishment was not associated with any stigma dimensions.

In their review describing the prevalence of burnout among physicians, Rotenstein et al. [2]
showed that studies variably reported prevalence estimates of overall burnout or burnout sub-
components: 67.0% for general burnout, 72.0% for emotional exhaustion, 68.1% for deperson-
alization, and 63.2% for low personal accomplishment. A recent review described the

prevalence of burnout among general practitioners [41] and noticed that in that population,
mean burnout estimates were: 16.43 for emotional exhaustion, which represents a low degree
of emotional exhaustion, 6.74 for depersonalization, which represents a moderate degree of
this dimension, and a low degree of personal accomplishment (29.28). This heterogeneity in
prevalence highlights the importance of considering the work context when considering
burnout.

In this study, mean sub-scores for stigma were higher for perceived structural stigma, like
in other studies [33], and personal stigma was rated the lowest. These findings show that the
perception of the stigma of stress and burnout is mainly situated within the context of the
structural influences operating in the workplace. These concerns about the policies and prac-
tices that restrict the opportunities of stigmatized persons may prevent physicians from dis-
closing psychological distress and seeking help.

There was a significant difference in how physicians with burnout syndrome experienced
stigma compared with physicians without burnout syndrome. Most items on the stigma scale
were higher in those with burnout. Physicians with burnout were likelier to hold stigmatized
views as most items had a statistical difference. These results go in the same direction. Namely,
high burnout correlates with high stigma and low burnout with lower perceived stigma. Dyr-
bye et al. [32] assessed the perceptions of stigma among medical students with burnout. They
used the MBI to measure burnout and selected items from existing literature on stigma in the
field of mental illness. Students with burnout had significantly higher perceived stigma scores
and greater fear of discrimination and confidentiality breaches than those without burnout.
Similarly, Weiss et al. [42] examined the relationship between burnout and fellows’ percep-
tions of stigma surrounding help-seeking for mental illness. They concluded that fellows with
burnout were more likely than their peers to perceive significant stigma around help-seeking
for psychological distress.

Our results show a more complex pattern than the one-to-one association between the dif-

ferent dimensions of burnout and stigma we hypothesized. The primary association was
between perceived structural stigma and emotional exhaustion. At the same time, we hypothe-
sized that personal stigma would be associated with emotional exhaustion and that perceived
structural stigma would be related to (lack of) personal accomplishment. This dimension of

burnout was not associated with any stigma. Our results show that physicians who perceive
discrimination and fear of their career and may choose not to disclose their distress (perceived
structural stigma) are also more likely to feel tired and unable to face the demands of their job
or engage with people (emotional exhaustion). Emotional exhaustion is a core dimension of
burnout [32]. In our results, emotional exhaustion was also associated with perceived other
stigma and was weakly associated with personal stigma. Perceived other stigma and personal
stigma were also associated with another dimension of burnout (depersonalization). We
hypothesized that perceived other stigma would only be correlated with depersonalization
because of a negative loop. In addition, in the results, the perceived stigma of being less capable
and bringing disrepute to the profession (personal stigma) was also linked with a feeling of
incapacity to face job demands (emotional exhaustion) and disengagement
(depersonalization).

In a recent study [43], nonprofessional occupational mental health staff’s perceived mental

illness-related stigma was assessed using Link’s Devaluation-Discrimination Scale [44], and
burnout was evaluated using the MBI. These results suggest that higher perceived mental ill-
ness-related stigma is associated with more severe burnout. Mental-illness-related stigma sig-
nificantly affected the MBI depersonalization subscale sore, but not other burnout dimensions.
Our study showed that emotional exhaustion is associated with the three factors of perceived
stigma and that depersonalization is associated with the SOSS-D subscales related to interper-
sonal attitudes (personal stigma and perceived other stigma). Perceived stigma at work may
also have progressive dimensions. Stigma is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon,
and various measures exist. Perceived burnout stigma can also be assessed as a unidimensional
construct [45]; they developed an eight-item instrument (BSI-8) that predicts burnout and
other mental health indicators, such as depression, anxiety, and stress in adults. They concep-
tualized burnout stigma as the perceived stigma of individuals experiencing burnout. The dif-
ferences between the scales measuring stigma might have led to different results. Nevertheless,
the results of different studies have shown the same trend. In the future, various approaches,
such as qualitative research, could enhance comprehensive results related to the phenomeno-
logical experiences of burnout and stigmatization of individuals and their relationship with
help-seeking.

The psychological mechanisms underlying the association between stigma and burnout
remain unclear. Different models have been previously described. The first model considers
stigmatizing attitudes as related to adverse outcomes, which emphasizes the role of the stigma-
tizer’s psychological distress in the cyclical process of stigma [46]. Burnout stigmatization can
also be understood through the lens of social-cognitive stigma theory: people approve of the
stereotype that individuals who are burnt out are somehow at fault for their condition and
should work harder to meet societal demands [45]. The psychological flexibility model has also
been applied to stigma-related problems. Among people suffering from depression, the combi-
nation of the increased potential for aversive experiences, a tendency for experiential avoid-
ance, and rigid patterns of behavior under the control of cognitions that are insensitive to the
current context are grouped under the term “psychological inflexibility” processes [47]. Burn-
out has been shown to overlap with depression in terms of etiology, symptoms, course, and
cognitive bias [48,49]. Psychological flexibility is negatively correlated with stigma [46] and
has a critical indirect role in stigma via emotional exhaustion [50]. Our results fit this flexibility
model, as the emotional exhaustion subscale was associated with three factors of perceived
stigma. Moreover, in our study, physicians suffering from burnout also had a higher perceived
stigma. These characteristics will, in turn, render them unable to empathize with other medical
doctors presenting with burnout symptoms. This process can contribute to burnout contagion,
given that personal burnout may increase collective burnout, both directly and indirectly [45].

Emotional contagion has been defined as a tendency to converge emotionally by automatically
synchronizing facial expressions and postures with those of another person [51]. Several stud-
ies have demonstrated that the experience of burnout is contagious and can be transferred
directly from one employee to another [52,53] and that the contagion of emotion instigates
incivility in the workplace, which in turn is related to two dimensions of burnout (emotional
exhaustion and cynicism) [54]. Victims and perpetrators of incivility both suffer from height-
ened burnout. Indirect burnout can be transferred through the influence of burned-out indi-
viduals on the working conditions of others. For example, burnt-out individuals, who have
been found to make more mistakes, misuse work breaks, and be more absent from work, can
make their co-workers’ jobs more difficult and increase their workload [45]. Our results intro-
duce a new explanation for burnout contagion, as they theoretically show that high burnout
and high perceived stigma work together in interpersonal relationships. Physicians with high
perceived stigma would not only stigmatize their peers but would also be less empathic, sup-
portive, and understanding. Burnout and stigma increased among colleagues. Burnout and
stigma can produce a lack of conversations about burnout, encouragement of support groups,
increased vigilance for signs of burnout, and action for suffering colleagues, especially in hier-
archical relationships. Further research is required to confirm these results.

The results suggest the need for anti-stigma or anti-burnout interventions for physicians
working in hospitals. The reported barriers to treatment and active help-seeking include lack
of time, cost, concerns regarding confidentiality, potential career implications, exposure to
unwanted interventions, and stigmatization [55–58]. Dyrbye et al. [32] highlighted that per-
ceived stigma could contribute to not seeking help, together with negative personal experi-
ences and the hidden curriculum. Shah et al. [59] advocated for politically significant steps to
minimize COVID-19-specific contributing factors for burnout. In Mexico, a program was
launched to prevent burnout among physicians and health care professionals. The author
explained the lack of attendance in the programs to the “normalization of stress and/or stigma
among healthcare professionals” [60]. Bianchi et al. [48] explored senior doctors’ views on
mental illness within the medical profession through semi-structured interviews. These find-
ings suggest that more significant efforts are needed to destigmatize mental illness in work and
improve support for doctors. Similarly, Martin et al. [61] showed that medical students could
benefit from exposure to physicians with self-disclosed histories of coming mental illnesses.
Winstanley (2018) [62] developed a web-based intervention to support doctors and medical
students in their decision to disclose their mental illness. Walsh et al. [63] explored interven-
tions for the prevention and reduction of work stress and burnout in hospital doctors using a
qualitative design a. They concluded that the culture of medicine needs to change from stigma-
tization and competitiveness to compassion and collaboration. Additionally, promoting psy-
chological flexibility could be a powerful tool for reducing stigmatizing attitudes and burnout
[50]. Several interventions have been evaluated for managing physician burnout. Clough et al.
[64] conducted a systematic review of psychosocial interventions targeting occupational stress
and burnout among doctors. Cognitive behavioral interventions demonstrated the most sub-
stantial evidence, particularly for reducing stress. Patel et al. [9] reviewed strategies to manage
physician burnout. These include professional coaching and stress reduction programs, team-
building activities, paid leave, and time off. Walsh et al. [63] qualitatively explored interven-
tions for the prevention and reduction of work stress and burnout in hospital doctors. They
concluded that the culture of medicine needs to change from stigmatization and competitive-
ness to compassion and collaboration.

This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study allows for

the interpretation of correlations rather than causality. Burnout and perceived stigma are
interrelated in physicians, and it remains unclear whether burnout generates perceived stigma

or conversely. Second, nonresponse bias must be considered, as non-responders may be more
exposed to burnout and perceived stigma. Or, on the contrary, it is possible that those more
affected by burnout have been more interested in participating. Third, social desirability bias
was not controlled. Participants may have answered these sensitive questions with socially
desirable rather than truthful responses. Intensive care unit physicians and surgeons were not
assessed. Surgical residents have high overall burnout scores [65], and Fu et al. [66] com-
mented on the efforts needed to dismantle the institutionalized stigmatization of mental illness
about suicide among surgical trainees. Fourth, the alpha of the three factors of the stigma scale
was low. While the sample size was large enough to conduct the analyses, future studies with
larger sample sizes should be conducted to provide stronger evidence.». Finally, these results
were representative of a single institution. These factors limit the generalizability of the results
because there are undoubtedly specialty-related cultures that influenced our results. Future
studies should include a more extensive range of specialties to confirm our findings.

To conclude, the results of this study provide a broader understanding of the experience of
burnout among medical doctors, which suggests the need for adjustment of existing burnout
management at the institutional level. Further research is needed to explore how increased
burnout and stigmatization impact collective burnout and stigmatization, as well as treatment
delay.
