Abstract
Background  The skill of communicating with the patient is one of the basic clinical skills and part of the necessary 
competencies for medical doctors. The present study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and performance 
(KAP) of medical students, assistants, and professors of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences regarding clinical 
communication skills with patients.

Method  This cross-sectional study was conducted at the hospitals of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences in 
Iran. The study included a total of 289 participants, consisting of 51 professors, 72 assistants, 90 external staff, and 
76 interns who work at these hospitals. The participants were selected through a convenience sampling method. 
The data-gathering tools used included a questionnaire to collect demographic characteristics, a researcher-made 
questionnaire to assess knowledge, a communication skills attitude questionnaire, and a communication skills survey 
questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency, as 
well as statistical tests that included one-way ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation test. The significance level for the study 
was considered to be 0.05.

Results  The mean scores of knowledge of professors were higher compared to other groups (P = 0.002). All 
participating groups had a positive attitude toward learning communication skills. There were statistically significant 
differences between the mean scores of the communication performance of the study groups (P < 0.001). There 
was a positive relationship between positive attitude and communication performance, and a significant negative 
relationship was observed between negative attitude and communication performance.

Conclusion  The results indicate the relatively favorable attitude and performance of the groups and their low 
knowledge. It is suggested that the doctor-patient communication skills courses be included as one of the necessary 
courses in the medical education curriculum.

Keywords  Clinical communication skills, Knowledge, Attitude, Performance, Medical students, Assistants.

Introduction
Effective communication is an essential and multidimen-
sional  aspect  of  purposeful  exchange,  which  cannot  be 
avoided [1]. Communication skills are considered crucial 
competencies  for  medical  doctors,  as  per  expert  opin-
ions. Despite their complexity, these skills can be learned 
and  taught  [2,  3].  One  of  the  fundamental  principles  of 
professionalism in medicine is the commitment to proper 
communication  with  patients,  based  on  an  understand-
ing of moral and legal issues [4].

Effective communication between doctors and patients 
is  crucial  for  quality  medical  care.  Poor  communication 
can  negatively  impact  various  aspects  of  medical  care, 
including  history  taking,  disease  diagnosis,  and  the  use 
of effective treatments. Studies have shown that patients’ 
stresses  and  worries  can  have  adverse  effects  on  their 
health.  Therefore,  physicians  should  establish  proper 
communication and consider patients’  feelings  and con-
cerns  to  provide  more  useful  and  effective  medical  care 
[5].  Evidence  indicates  that  physicians  often  lack  ade-
quate knowledge of communication principles, resulting 
in significant issues in doctor-patient interactions [6]. In 
many cases, doctors’ poor communication causes patient 
complaints, not their scientific abilities [7, 8]. According 
to  Shiraly  et  al.‘s  study,  despite  having  good  knowledge 
about  communication  skills  with  their  patients,  most 
doctors  reported  inadequate  performance.  It  seems  that 
doctors’ knowledge is not effectively applied, leaving the 
problem  unresolved  [9].  The  researchers  evaluated  the 
communication skills of 53 internal  assistants  in a clini-
cal  examination  station  and  found  that  most  of  them 
displayed  poor  communication  skills  [10].  Therefore, 
it  is  necessary  to  provide  medical  doctors  with  proper 
and  systematic  training  in  patient  communication  skills 
[7]. However, Understanding medical students’ attitudes 
towards  communication  skills  training  is  important  as 
it  can  influence  their  communication  behaviors  in  clini-
cal settings [11]. By gaining insights into their beliefs and 
attitudes  towards  doctor-patient  communication,  we 
can  improve  the  effectiveness  of  communication  skills 
training  programs  [12]. Therefore,  communication  skills 
teaching  has  become  a  vital  topic  in  medical  education 
curriculums  across  many  countries,  where  medical  stu-
dents are required to pass communication skills training 
courses before starting clinical education. These courses 
typically cover methods of taking history and conducting 
medical  interviews  [13].  However,  despite  the  growing 
importance  of  communication  skills  in  medical  educa-
tion, these skills are not included in the official program 
of  medical  education  in  Iran.  Instead,  students’  learning 
is  mostly  based  on  indirect  and  experimental  model-
ing from their senior students and professors, with only 
scattered movements made at the level of some universi-
ties  of  medical  sciences  [14,  15].  As  a  result  of  in-depth 

interviews  with  medical  students  in  Iran,  it  was  found 
that they did not believe in their ability to create effective 
relationships  with  patients,  indicating  that  educational 
programs  have  not  been  efficient  in  creating  effective 
relationships with patients. Therefore, there is still a need 
to teach communication skills and evaluate the effective-
ness of training programs [10]. It was also reported that 
patient  satisfaction  with  the  communication  skills  of 
patients and medical assistants was average. Therefore, it 
is recommended that the training and evaluation of com-
munication  skills  be  a  central  part  of  the  assistants’  for-
mal curriculum [16].

Most  of  the  previous  studies  on  the  communication 
skills  of  clinical  care  providers  have  focused  on  nurses 
and medical students [17–21]. Fewer studies have exam-
ined  the  communication  skills  of  university  professors 
and their assistants [9, 22], and none have compared the 
communication skills of medical students, assistants, and 
professors. Additionally, most studies have mainly evalu-
ated  participants’  performance,  with  less  attention  paid 
to  their  knowledge  and  attitude  [23].  Research  reveals 
that  interventions  addressing  the  cognitive,  emotional, 
and  psychomotor  domains  of  behaviors  are  more  effec-
tive  in  improving  communication  skills.  Knowledge, 
Attitude,  and  Performance  (KAP)  studies  are  crucial  in 
designing  such  interventions  [24].  Therefore,  this  study 
aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and performance 
of medical students, assistants, and professors in terms of 
clinical communication skills with patients.

Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on medical stu-
dents (externs and interns), assistants, and professors of 
the teaching hospitals of Shahrekord University of Medi-
cal Sciences, Iran in 2019. The participants in this study 
were chosen using the convenience sampling method. To 
achieve this, all 120 clinical professors and their 87 assis-
tants  were  considered,  and  finally,  51  professors  and  72 
assistants completed the questionnaires. The sample size 
of 185 medical students was determined based on Krejcie 
& Morgan’s (1970) table for determining the sample size 
from  a  given  population  (which  was  340  for  this  study) 
[25]. To accomplish this, 100 externs and 85 interns were 
randomly  selected  from  a  total  of  180  externs  and  160 
interns. The inclusion criteria for this study were medical 
students who had completed the entire training course at 
Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences and were not 
transfers,  medical  assistants  in  clinical  fields  studying  at 
Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences who were not 
guests or transferees, all clinical professors of Shahrekord 
University of Medical Sciences, and participants who had 
provided their consent to participate in the study. Exclu-
sion criteria included dissatisfaction with participating in 
the study and failure to respond to the questionnaire.

Data  were  collected  through  a  demographic  informa-
tion  form  (including  sex,  age,  marital  status,  and  edu-
cation  level),  a  questionnaire  for  measuring  knowledge 
about communication skills, a questionnaire for measur-
ing  attitude  towards  communication  skills,  and  a  ques-
tionnaire for measuring communication performance.

Knowledge  was  assessed  by  a  researcher-made  ques-
tionnaire  consisted  of  10  multiple-choice  questions,  the 
correct  answer  to  each  question  was  given  a  score  of 
one,  and  the  incorrect  answer  (or  I  don’t  know)  to  each 
question was given a score of zero, so, the possible score 
range was between zero and 10. The knowledge score was 
categorized  into  two  levels  based  on  the  50%  of  highest 
possible  score,  indicated  by  low  (0–5),  and  high  [6–10]. 
The  face  and  content  validity  of  the  questionnaire  was 
confirmed  by  a  panel  of  10  PhDs  in  health  promotion 
and  medical  education.  To  evaluate  the  content  valid-
ity of the questionnaire, opinions of a panel of 10 health 
education and promotion professionals were considered, 
and  subsequently,  the  content  validity  ratio  (CVR)  and 
the  content  validity  index  (CVI)  were  calculated.  The 
CVR  for  all  items  in  the  questionnaire  was  higher  than 
0.78, which met the acceptable criteria based on Lawshe’s 
criteria [26]. Additionally, the CVI for all items was over 
0.79, which was also acceptable based on the criteria set 
by  Waltz  and  Bussel  [27].  Test-retest  method  on  a  pilot 
sample of 30 subjects with two weeks’ intervals was used 
for assessing external reliability of the questionnaire, and 
the  correlation  coefficient  of  0.75  (P  =  0.003)  confirmed 
its reliability.

The participants’ attitudes toward doctor-patient com-
munication skills was assessed using a standard Commu-
nication Skills Attitude Questionnaire (CSAS) which was 
designed  and  validated  by  Rees  et  al.  (2002)  in  England 
[28].  This  questionnaire  has  26  items  with  a  five-point 
Likert  scale  (completely  agree-completely  disagree)  and 
includes  two  parts:  a  positive  attitude  (13  items)  and  a 
negative attitude (13 items) towards doctor-patient com-
munication  skills.  A  higher  score  in  each  section  indi-
cates  a  more  positive  and  negative  attitude  toward  the 
importance  of doctor-patient communication  skills. The 
Persian  version  of  this  questionnaire  was  validated  in 
2017  by  Yakhforoshha  et  al.  [29].  In  the  current  study, 
the  internal  reliability  of  the  questionnaire  was  mea-
sured  by  calculating  the  Cronbach’s  alpha  coefficient, 
and  Cronbach’s  alpha  coefficients  of  0.90  and  0.70  for 
the positive and negative attitude questionnaires, respec-
tively,  indicating  the  excellent  and  acceptable  reliability 
of  this  questionnaire.  In  examining  the  external  reliabil-
ity  of  the  questionnaire  with  the  test-retest  method  on 
a  pilot  sample  of  30  subjects  with  two  weeks’  intervals, 
the correlation coefficient of 0.85 (P = 0.001) indicates the 
appropriate reliability of the questionnaire.

The  participant’s  performance  was  measured  using 
communication  skills  survey  questionnaire  which  was 
designed and validated by Javaher et al. (2014) in the Per-
sian  language  [30]. This  questionnaire  includes  28  items 
with a five-point Likert scale (always-never) with a pos-
sible score range of 28 to 140. The higher score indicated 
a better performance in the relationship with the patient. 
The  performance  score  was  categorized  into  two  levels 
based  on  the  50%  of  highest  possible  score,  indicated 
by  low  (<  70),  and  high  (≥  70).  Cronbach’s  alpha  coeffi-
cient  of  0.75  indicated  the  acceptable  internal  reliability 
of  the  questionnaire.  In  examining  the  external  reliabil-
ity of the questionnaire with the test-retest method on a 
pilot sample of 30 subjects with two weeks’ intervals, the 
correlation  coefficient  of  0.81  (P  =  0.001)  indicated  the 
appropriate reliability of the questionnaire.

After explaining the aims of the study to four groups of 
participants  and  signing  the  informed  consent  form  by 
them, they were included in the study and questionnaires 
were  administered  to  them.  It  took,  on  average,30  min 
to  complete  the  questionnaires  and  the  researcher  tried 
to  administer  the  questionnaires  in  the  times  when  the 
work load of participants was low, so they could respond 
easily  and  without  worrying  about  work.  It  should  be 
noted  that  due  to  the  busy  schedule  of  the  professors, 
the questionnaire was provided to all professors in some 
other online ways such as email and social networks, too.
The data were analyzed using SPSS24 software. Demo-
information  was  reported  using  frequency 
graphic 
distribution,  mean  and  standard  deviation.  The  Kol-
mogorov-Smirnov test with the Bonferroni post hoc test 
was  used  to  examine  the  normality  of  data  distribution. 
Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  was  used  to  compare 
mean  scores  of  knowledge,  attitude,  and  performance. 
One-way ANOVA was used to compare means on more 
than two groups. The significance level was set at < 0.05.

Results
Based  on  the  sample  size  which  was  considered  for  this 
study,  392  questionnaires  were  administered  to  the  par-
ticipants  and  289  people  completed  the  questionnaires 
(total  response  rate  =  73.7%).  The  lowest  response  rate 
was  related  to  professors  (42.5%)  and  assistants  (82.7%), 
interns  (89.4%)  and  interns  (90.0%)  were  in  the  next 
ranks.  Among  the  study  participants,  125  (43.3%)  were 
male  and  164  (56.7%)  were  female.  Most  of  the  partici-
pants were single (51.6%) and about 39.7% of them were 
married,  while  8.7%  of  the  participants  did  not  answer 
the marital status question. Table 1 shows the mean age 
of  study  participants  in  four  education  level  groups  by 
sex. (Table 1)

As  shown  in  Table  2,,  the  knowledge  mean  scores  of 
all  groups  participating  in  the  study  were  in  the  low 
category.  The  highest  knowledge  score  was  related  to

professors,  significantly  different  from  other  studied 
groups (P = 0.002). There were no significant differences 
in the positive and negative attitudes of the participants 
in  the  study  towards  communication  skills  among  the 
different study groups. The findings of the study showed 
that, in general, the mean scores of communication per-
formance in all the participating groups were in the high 
category,  and  the  communication  performance  of  the 
professors was significantly better than the other studied 
groups  (P  <  0.001),  besides,  the  performance  of  externs 
was significantly better than assistants (Table 2).

In  examining  the  correlation  between  the  studied 
variables,  it  was  found  that  there  were  no  significant 
correlations  between  the  knowledge  mean  scores  with 
positive  attitude,  negative  attitude,  and  communication 
performance  in  any  of  the  studied  groups.  In  the  group 
of  professors,  no  significant  correlation  was  observed 
between  any  of  the  studied  variables,  but  in  the  other 
three  groups  significant  positive  relationships  were 
observed  between  positive  attitude  and  communica-
tion performance, that is, the more positive  the attitude 
toward  doctor-patient  communication  skills,  the  bet-
ter  the  performance.  Negative  significant  correlations 
were  observed  between  positive  attitude  and  negative 
attitude  in  all  three  groups,  that  is,  the  higher  the  posi-
tive  attitude,  the  lower  the  negative  attitude  towards

the  importance  of  patient  communication  skills.  In  the 
groups of assistants and externs, significant negative cor-
relations  were  seen  between  negative  attitude  and  com-
munication  performance,  which  means  that  the  more 
negative  attitude  about  the  importance  of  communica-
tion  skills,  the  weaker  communication  performance  was 
reported. In almost all cases, the correlation coefficients 
were less than 0.05, which means that the observed cor-
relations were weak (Table 3).

Discussion
The results of this study showed that the knowledge sta-
tus of all participated groups (externs, interns, assistants, 
and professors) were in the low level (based on the 50% 
of  possible  achievable  score),  and  the  knowledge  score 
of professors was significantly higher compared to assis-
tants,  interns,  and  externs,  but  the  knowledge  score  of 
assistants,  interns,  and  externs  were  not  significantly 
different.  Since  communication  skills  are  not  officially 
taught in the educational curriculum of medical students 
in  Iran,  this  difference  may  be  due  to  more  experiences 
of  professors  than  assistants  and  students. These  results 
were  consistent  with  the  results  conducted  by  Wang  et 
al.  (2022)  and  Güner  et  al.  (2019)  [31,  32],  it  seems  that 
since,  based  on  the  available  evidence,  communication 
skills are mainly acquired and can be learned [33], medi-
cal  students,  assistants,  and  professors  need  to  partici-
pate in doctor-patient communication skills courses.

In  our  study,  medical  students,  assistants,  and  profes-
sors  have  a  positive  attitude  toward  learning  communi-
cation  skills,  while,  there  were  no  significant  differences 
between  the  different  study  groups,  however,  the  posi-
tive  attitude  of  the  assistants,  interns,  and  externs  was 
slightly  more  than  that  of  the  professors.  Since  formal

communication skills training is not given to medical stu-
dents in Iran, this difference may be due to the fact that 
students  and  assistants  spend  more  time  with  patients 
than professors and feel a greater need to learn commu-
nication  skills. The  results  of  Timilsina  et  al.  (2019)  and 
Ratnaprabha  et  al.  (2021)  were  in  line  with  the  findings 
of the present study [34, 35]. Although, in the groups of 
assistants, interns, and externs, a significant inverse rela-
tionship  was  observed  between  negative  attitude  and 
communication  performance.  However,  the  results  of 
a longitudinal study showed that there is a possibility of 
increasing  negative  attitudes  in  the  long  term,  and  it  is 
suggested  that  in  order  to  prevent  attitudes  from  wors-
ening over time, communication skills training should be 
continuous or at least at intervals of less than 6 months 
[36].

The results of the current study indicate that the com-
munication  performance  of  all  four  groups  were  in  the 
high level (based on the 50% of possible achievable score). 
There were significant differences between the communi-
cation  performance  scores  of  the  different  groups,  with 
the  professors  having  a  higher  mean  score  compared 
to  the  assistants,  interns,  and  externs.  Which  may  be 
because  of  their  more  experiences.  However,  no  similar 
study comparing the communication performance of dif-
ferent  groups  was  found.  Different  studies  that  utilized 
the same tool to measure doctors’ communication skills 
produced varying results. For example, a cross-sectional 

Page 5 of 7

study  by  Rezaiyan  et  al.  (2015)  found  the  mean  score  of 
the communication skills of the academic staff at Rafsan-
jan University of Medical Sciences to be 92.56 ± 7.25 (out 
of  the  range  of  34–179),  which  was  at  an  average  level 
[22]. In another study by Peyman et al., the overall aver-
age  of  the  communication  skills  of  the  faculty  members 
at Ilam University of Medical Sciences was 106.53 ± 8.59. 
In a similar study by Attarha et al. in Arak University of 
Medical Sciences, this value was reported as 121.8 ± 8.8 
[37]. The discrepancies in the results of these studies may 
be  attributed  to  differences  in  the  study  populations  in 
terms of various variables such as age, sex, work experi-
ence,  education  level,  and  receiving  training  regarding 
clinical communication skills.

Research  suggests  that  trained  physicians  possess  bet-
ter  targeted  communication  skills  [38],  which  in  turn 
leads  to  more  accurate  diagnosis  and  treatment,  as  well 
as higher patient satisfaction rates. Therefore, it is imper-
ative to educate both students and professors to improve 
communication  performance.  However,  studies  con-
ducted by Beaird et al. (2017) and Dong et al. (2015) show 
that  there  is  no  significant  correlation  between  knowl-
edge  scores  and  attitude,  negative  or  positive,  or  com-
munication  performance  in  any  of  the  studied  groups 
[39,  40]. This  indicates  a  need  for  educational  programs 
that go beyond merely enhancing knowledge and are pre-
sented in innovative and interactive ways.

In  this  study,  we  compared  four  groups  (externs, 
interns,  assistants,  and  professors),  which  is  a  unique 
approach. However, we faced some limitations, including 
a low response rate from the professors despite multiple 
methods being used to encourage them to complete the 
questionnaire.  Another  limitation  is  that  the  question-
naire was self-administered, and we couldn’t observe the 
participants’  communication  skills  when  dealing  with 
patients. Therefore, the responses may be biased by social 
desirability.

Conclusion
According  to  the  results  of  the  present  study,  profes-
sors, medical students and assistants had average knowl-
edge  about  clinical  communication  skills,  but  their 
performance  and  attitude  were  above  average  and  rela-
tively  favorable.  Also,  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  pro-
fessors  were  more  compared  to  assistants  and  general 
medical  students,  which  shows  that  one  of  the  ways  to 
improve  communication  skills  is  to  create  and  feel  the 
need  to  establish  proper  communication  with  patients 
after  increasing  experience  and  length  of  service.  How-
ever,  the  lack  of  knowledge  of  professors  and  assistants 
regarding  communication  skills,  despite  their  profes-
sional experience in the community, indicates that being 
in  the  community  and  professional  activity  alone  is  not

for training is felt.
