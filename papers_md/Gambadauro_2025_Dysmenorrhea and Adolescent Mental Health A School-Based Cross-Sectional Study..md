ABSTRACT
Objective: While active monitoring of adolescent menstrual and mental health is advocated, research on their possible bidi-
rectional  relationship  is  limited.  This  study  examines  the  association  between  adolescent  dysmenorrhea  and  psychological 
symptoms.
Design: Cross- sectional study.
Setting: 116 schools in Stockholm, Sweden.
Sample: 1054 postmenarchal school girls (mean age 14.1 ± 0.7) randomly sampled from a population of 10 299 lower- secondary 
pupils in a school- based project.
Methods:  A  self- report  health  survey  assessed  psychological  symptoms  using  validated  instruments.  A  multiple- choice  item 
identified dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain affecting everyday life) and severe dysmenorrhea (dysmenorrhea that is hard to cope 
with).
Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of dysmenorrhea and severe dysmenorrhea in girls with and without symptoms of de-
pression (Beck's Depression Inventory- II score ≥ 20), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Scale score ≥ 10), self- injury 
(≥ 3 instances on a modified Deliberate Self- harm Inventory), and suicide ideation (recent serious thoughts/plans on the Paykel 
Suicide Scale).
Results:  Overall, 55.1% reported dysmenorrhea while 11.7% reported severe  dysmenorrhea. Prevalence was 29%–34% higher 
among girls with psychological symptoms compared to those without. Severe dysmenorrhea was significantly more frequent 
among girls with any symptom (prevalence ratio [PR] 2.25; 95% CI 1.61, 3.13), depression (PR 2.60; 95% CI 1.86, 3.63), anxiety 
(PR 2.89; 95% CI 2.09, 4.00), self- injury (PR 1.87; 95% CI 1.29, 2.71), and suicide ideation (PR 1.75; 95% CI 1.18, 2.58) compared 
to girls without the same manifestations. These findings were consistent after adjustments for age, age of menarche, country of 
birth, and hormonal contraception.
Conclusions: These findings emphasise the need for integrated approaches to adolescent menstrual and mental health care.

1   |   Introduction

Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is the most common 
menstrual symptom and is particularly frequent among ado-
lescents [1, 2]. Prevalence above 70% is often reported during 
late  adolescence  both  internationally  and  in  Sweden  [2–5]. 
The  origin  of  adolescent  menstrual  pain  is  commonly  at-
tributed to a local inflammatory response that occurs during 
menstruation (primary dysmenorrhea) but can sometimes be 
related to specific disorders such as endometriosis (secondary 
dysmenorrhea)  [6,  7].  Regardless  of  etiological  background, 
unmanaged  dysmenorrhea  can  have  profound  consequences 
on health and quality of life. In addition to direct physical suf-
fering,  young  women  with  dysmenorrhea  have  reduced  psy-
chological  well- being  and  often  miss  school,  sports,  or  other 
social activities [2, 4].

Adolescent  mental  ill  health  is  also  a  significant  public  health 
challenge globally [8]. Manifestations such as depression, anx-
iety,  non- suicidal  self- injury,  and  suicidal  ideation  are  com-
mon among adolescents, with girls typically experiencing more 
symptoms  than  boys  [9–11].  In  Sweden  and  other  Western 
countries,  the  incidence  of  psychiatric  diagnoses  and  referrals 
to  mental  health  services  is  increasing,  particularly  among 
younger  women  [12,  13].  Interestingly,  differences  in  mental 
health between girls and boys emerge during adolescence [14]. 
Prepubertal  girls  and  boys,  for  instance,  have  similar  rates  of 
depression,  whereas  female  predominance  emerges  in  mid- 
puberty and seems to correlate with pubertal status, rather than 
age or pubertal timing [15, 16].

Recently,  separate  calls  have  been  made  for  active  monitoring 
of adolescent menstrual and mental health [6, 8], but very few 
studies on possible interrelationships are available [17]. Chronic 
pain is indeed a common physical complaint among people with 
psychological disorders [18, 19]. However, adolescent dysmenor-
rhea is overlooked in pain research as it is often normalised in 
social contexts [20]. More efforts are therefore needed to identify 
high- risk groups and inform successful management strategies.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of dysmen-
orrhea with mental ill health in a large school- based sample of 
Swedish postmenarchal adolescents. We hypothesised that dys-
menorrhea  and  severe  dysmenorrhea  would  be  more  frequent 
among girls with significant levels of depression, anxiety, non- 
suicidal self- injury, or suicidal ideation, compared to peers with-
out the same psychopathological manifestations.

2   |   Methods

2.1   |   Design and Study Population

Between  2016  and  2019,  a  mental  health  promotion  initiative 
called  YAM  (Youth  Aware  of  Mental  health)  [21]  was  imple-
mented  by  Stockholm  Region  and  Karolinska  Institutet  in  116 
schools  located  in  24  out  of  26  municipalities  in  Stockholm, 
Sweden.  Within  the  project,  10 299  volunteering  pupils  from 
lower secondary classes (median age 14; IQR 13–14; 5024 girls) 
completed a baseline self- report health survey, including men-
tal  health  questionnaires,  on  digital  mobile  devices  during  a 

single classroom session. An additional questionnaire including 
items on menarche and menstrual health was randomly deliv-
ered to one- third of the initial female population (n = 1644) [5]. 
Postmenarchal girls who completed the mental health question-
naires  were  eligible  for  the  present  study,  whereas  those  with 
missing data on dysmenorrhea were excluded.

2.2   |   Mental Health

Psychopathological  symptoms  were  evaluated  with  the  Beck's 
Depression  Inventory  II  (BDI- II)  [22,  23],  the  Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Scale (GAD- 7) [24], a modified 6- item 
version  of  the  Deliberate  Self- harm  Inventory  (DSHI)  [10], 
and  the  Paykel  Suicide  Scale  (PSS)  [25].  Depression  and  anxi-
ety  were respectively defined by BDI- II  score ≥ 20 and GAD- 7 
score ≥ 10, which are the cut- offs recommended to define mod-
erate symptoms. Self- injury was defined as repeating any of the 
self- injurious  acts  included  in  the  DSHI  for  at  least  3–4  times 
that is an answer ≥ 3 to any of the DSHI items. Suicide ideation 
was defined by having seriously considered or planned suicide 
during  the  previous  2 weeks,  that  is,  an  answer  different  than 
“never” to the 4th item of the PSS [26]. A composite “mental ill 
health” variable was defined by the presence of any of the above 
manifestations.

2.3   |   Dysmenorrhea

An ad- hoc multiple- choice item assessed menstrual pain's func-
tional impact and severity. Respondents were asked if they were 
affected  in  their  everyday  life  by  menstrual  pain  (“are  you  af-
fected  in  your  everyday  life?”)  with  four  response  levels:  1- no; 
2- seldom; 3- yes, but I can cope with it; and 4- yes, and I'm having 
a hard time coping with it. The item was derived from a previous 
multidimensional scoring system for dysmenorrhea which had 
good correlation with a linear analogue scale in earlier Swedish 
studies [3, 27]. For the purpose of this study, levels 3 and 4 de-
fined  dysmenorrhea  (i.e.,  menstrual  pain  affecting  everyday 
life),  whereas  level  4  was  conceptualised  as  severe  dysmenor-
rhea (i.e., dysmenorrhea that is hard to cope with).

2.4   |   Statistical Analysis

Differences in the frequencies of dysmenorrhea and severe dys-
menorrhea  between  groups  with  or  without  mental  ill  health 
manifestations  were  assessed  with  Pearson's  Chi- squared  test. 
Associations  between  mental  health  and  dysmenorrhea  were 
further studied with logistic regression derived odds ratios (OR). 
Log- link  binomial  regression  analyses  were  performed  to  es-
timate  prevalence  ratios  (PR)  for  each  mental  ill  health  mani-
festation. Separate sets of analyses were conducted considering 
either  dysmenorrhea  or  severe  dysmenorrhea  as  the  response 
variable. Multivariable analyses were carried out to account for 
the effect of potential confounders including age (years, contin-
uous), country of birth (Sweden/other), age of menarche (years, 
continuous),  and  hormonal  contraception  (yes/no).  Missing 
values, which were minimal in the analysed dataset (Table 1), 
were handled using listwise deletion. Sensitivity analyses using 
Firth's  penalised  logistic  regression  were  conducted  to  assess

crude and adjusted odds ratios and prevalence ratios with 95% 
confidence  intervals  (CI).  Differences  were  considered  statisti-
cally significant at a p- value < 0.05. The analyses were carried 
out in R with RStudio v.2023.6.0.421 for macOS [28, 29].

2.5   |   Patient and Public Involvement

The  YAM  school- based  project  was  run  in  collaboration  be-
tween  researchers  at  Karolinska  Institutet  and  Stockholm 
Region, which is the people- elected local authority responsible 
for  healthcare  services.  Throughout  the  project,  coordination 
between  researchers  and  responsible  persons  in  participating 
schools  (e.g.,  headmasters)  was  in  place.  Furthermore,  on- site 
meetings  between  researchers  and  school  staff  and/or  parents 
were organised to share information and feedback on the project.

3   |   Results

Of 1644 schoolgirls who were randomly sampled for the ques-
tionnaire,  1193  were  eligible  and  1054  of  them  (88.3%)  were 
eventually included in the study (Figure 1). The mean age and 
age  of  menarche  were  14.1  (SD  0.7)  and  12.2  (SD  1.0),  respec-
tively  (Table  1).  Most  girls  (90.9%)  were  born  in  Sweden,  and 
3.9% reported hormonal contraception (Table 1).

Based on the criteria defined in the methods, 34.7% of the sample 
had at least one of the considered mental ill health manifesta-
tions (Table 1). The proportions of girls with depression, anxi-
ety, self- injury, and suicidal ideation were 17.6%, 19.2%, 15.3%, 
and 13.9%, respectively. Girls with mental ill health had a sig-
nificantly lower age of menarche (mean difference −0.174 years; 
95% CI −0.296, −0.0514) and reported hormonal contraception

more  frequently  (6.8%  vs.  2.3%,  p < 0.001)  compared  to  those 
without.

Overall, 581 girls (55.1%) reported dysmenorrhea, while 123 of 
them (11.7%) reported severe dysmenorrhea (Table 1). Both dys-
menorrhea and severe dysmenorrhea were significantly associ-
ated with all the considered psychological symptoms (Table 2, 
Figure 2). The odds and prevalence of dysmenorrhea increased 
respectively  by  90%–110%  and  29%–34%  for  girls  with  mental 
ill  health  compared  to  those  without  (Figure  2).  Similarly,  se-
vere dysmenorrhea was significantly more frequent among girls 
with any mental ill health manifestation (PR 2.25; 95% CI 1.61, 
3.13)  and  more  specifically  with  depression  (PR  2.60;  95%  CI 
1.86, 3.63), anxiety (PR 2.89; 95% CI 2.09, 4.00), self- injury (PR 
1.87;  95%  CI  1.29,  2.71),  and  suicide  ideation  (PR  1.75;  95%  CI 
1.18,  2.58)  compared  to  girls  without  the  same  manifestations 
(Table 2, Figure 2). The above findings were stable after adjust-
ments for age, age of menarche, country of birth, and use of hor-
monal contraception (Figure 2) as well as in sensitivity analyses 
using Firth's penalised logistic regression (Table S1).

4.1   |   Main Findings

In  a  large,  random,  school- based  sample  of  Swedish  postmen-
archal  girls,  dysmenorrhea  was  significantly  associated  with 
mental  ill  health  manifestations  such  as  depression,  anxiety, 
self- injury,  and  suicide  ideation.  The  associations  were  partic-
ularly  strong  for  severe  dysmenorrhea,  whose  prevalence  was 
significantly higher among girls with depression (PR 2.60), anx-
iety (PR 2.89), self- injury (PR 1.87) and suicide ideation (PR 1.75) 
compared to peers without the same manifestations. The study 
findings were consistent when accounting for the effect of age,

4.2   |   Strengths and Limitations

This is one of the few studies addressing dysmenorrhea in a par-
ticularly  vulnerable  group  such  as  postmenarchal  adolescents 
with  mental  ill  health  [17].  A  high  response  rate  from  a  large 
population- based  sample  mitigates  selection  bias  compared  to 
clinical samples or selected sub- populations [4]. A broad range 
of psychological symptoms was measured with internationally 
validated  instruments.  Dysmenorrhea  was  categorised  accord-
ing to the person- reported impact of menstrual pain on everyday 
life, and separate analyses were conducted for overall and severe 
dysmenorrhea. The potential effect of covariates such as age, age 
of menarche, and hormonal contraception was accounted for in 
multivariable analyses.

There  are  however  important  limitations  to  consider.  The  di-
rectionality of the associations cannot be verified because of the 
cross- sectional design. The variables of interest were self- reported 
and not defined by clinical diagnoses. Elevated levels of psycho-
logical symptoms,  as detected by self- report  questionnaires, are 
indeed  suggestive  of  mental  health  conditions,  but  precise  di-
agnoses  would  require  semi- structured  interviews  [18],  which 
were unfeasible in the context of this study. For similar reasons, 
no  distinction  could  be  made  between  primary  and  secondary 
dysmenorrhea. Although most cases among adolescents are pri-
mary, some stem from underlying conditions (e.g., endometriosis) 
which can specifically affect the association with mental health, 
for  example  because  of  more  severe  or  complex  symptoms  or 
through  psychosocial  mechanisms  [7,  30–32].  It  should  be  con-
sidered that not all covariates may be investigated through self- 
reporting. Therefore, despite the mentioned adjustments, residual 
confounding from unmeasured factors is possible. Additionally, 
there were relatively few severe dysmenorrhea cases in some sub-
groups  (e.g.,  those  reporting  self- injury  or  suicidal  ideation).  In 
such cases, adjusting for multiple confounders may require larger 
samples to reduce bias and improve precision.

4.3   |   Interpretation

Adolescence  is  a  period  of  intense  biological,  psychological,  and 
social  development,  during  which  young  women  are  exposed  to 
peculiar  vulnerabilities.  Postpubertal  girls  develop  psychological 
symptoms to a greater extent than their male peers, and many of 
them  start  suffering  from  menstrual  pain  soon  after  menarche. 
The findings of a recent systematic review [17] highlight that only 
a  few  studies  have  so  far  investigated  the  relationship  between 
mental health and dysmenorrhea, particularly among adolescents. 
Associations have been observed in previous samples proceeding 
from diverse populations and regions, but most of the studies have 
so far focused on depression and anxiety symptoms in adult sam-
ples [17]. Even fewer studies have investigated the association of 
self- injury or suicidality with adolescent dysmenorrhea and, more 
generally, chronic pain during early postmenarchal years [17, 33]. 
In  a  Chinese  sample  (mean  age  15.0;  range  12–18),  non- suicidal 
self- injury was significantly more frequent among girls with mild 
(OR 1.31), moderate (OR 1.65), or severe (OR 2.17) dysmenorrhea

compared to girls without these [34]. In a Swiss study, significantly 
more adolescents (age 16–20) with severe dysmenorrhea reported 
past suicide attempts compared to peers with no, mild, or moder-
ate dysmenorrhea (5.6% vs. 3.1%) [35].

Our  present  findings  add  evidence  of  a  strong  association  be-
tween  mental  health  and  dysmenorrhea  among  postmenar-
chal adolescents. Such associations are likely to be the result of 
complex  bidirectional  mechanisms.  Underlying  mental  health 
conditions,  such  as  depression  and  anxiety,  may  amplify  pain 
perception, leading to worsened menstrual pain.

Mental  ill  health  can  indeed  precede  a  variety  of  physical 
symptoms,  among  which  pain  is  the  most  common  [36,  37]. 
Longitudinal  studies  have  identified  psychological  symptoms 
and  disorders  among  adolescents  as  risk  factors  for  both  pain 
and  menstrual  symptoms  [38,  39].  Co- occurrence  can  also  be 
explained by interrelated vulnerabilities of genetic, neurobiolog-
ical, and psychosocial nature [18, 36, 37, 40].

Chronic pain can, in turn, exacerbate psychological distress and 
contribute to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation. The 
impact of dysmenorrhea on physical and psychosocial wellbeing 
can  be  particularly  intense  due  to  the  normalisation,  stigma, 
and  inadequate  healthcare  responses  that  affect  adolescent 
menstrual  health  [41,  42].  Pain- related  social  withdrawal  can, 
for  instance,  induce  or  worsen  psychological  distress  linking 
dysmenorrhea with more serious psychopathological outcomes 
[43]. At the same time, it has been observed that the excess of 
pain- related  psychological  distress  only  partially  explains  out-
comes  such  as  self- injury  and  suicidal  ideation  in  association 
with chronic pain conditions [33, 43].

dysmenorrhea) and psychological (e.g., depression or anxiety) 
symptoms during adolescence, the ultimate impact on health 
and well- being likely depends on complex interactions between 
biological, psychological, and social factors [14, 16, 41, 44, 45]. 
This  is  arguably  consistent  with  biopsychosocial  frameworks 
according to which different domains (i.e., biological, psycho-
logical, and social) are relevant to conditions such as chronic 
pain  or  dysmenorrhea,  although  their  relative  contribution 
may  have  large  individual  variations  [31,  45,  46].  The  fear- 
avoidance model identifies catastrophising and fear of pain as 
key  drivers  of  vicious  circles  linking  pain  and  mental  health 
through effects on both pain severity and decline in psycholog-
ical  functioning  [18,  47].  Our  finding  of  a  particularly  strong 
association  in  the  case  of  severe  dysmenorrhea,  for  example, 
could suggest that psychological difficulties interfere with the 
adaptation process required to cope with menstrual pain and 
that the resulting maladjustment worsens pain perception and 
related well- being [48, 49].

While further studies and longitudinal data are clearly needed, 
the  conceptualisation  of  complex  pathways,  including  individ-
ual  or  socio- contextual  aggravating/mitigating  factors,  seems 
important to understand dysmenorrhea and to inform person-
alised  interventions  [36,  37,  46].  At  the  same  time,  we  believe 
that  cross- domain  outcomes  in  adolescent  mental  and  men-
strual health research (e.g., physical pain or psychological well-
being, respectively) should be considered for inclusion in future 
core outcome sets for interventional studies [50, 51].

5   |   Conclusions

Therefore, although unpreventable physiologic processes, such 
as  changes  in  sex  hormones,  may  explain  both  physical  (e.g., 

This  study  provides  evidence  of  a  strong  association  between 
dysmenorrhea  and  several  manifestations  of  mental  ill  health, 
such  as  depression,  anxiety,  self- injury,  and  suicidal  ideation,

among  postmenarchal  adolescents.  These  associations  are 
likely  to  be  the  result  of  complex  bidirectional  mechanisms. 
Dysmenorrhea  is  often  overlooked  in  adolescents,  and  its  re-
porting and management can be even more challenging among 
those with psychological difficulties.

These  findings  highlight  the  need  for  increased  vigilance  in 
school-   and  community- based  healthcare  settings,  where  op-
portunistic  screening  may  be  beneficial.  Healthcare  providers 
should consider the possibility of concurrent menstrual and psy-
chological symptoms during adolescent health visits to facilitate 
early identification. Additionally, multidisciplinary collaboration 
is crucial in addressing the needs of adolescents with both dys-
menorrhea and mental health challenges. Future research should 
focus on improving our understanding of the biopsychosocial fac-
tors involved and exploring novel integrated interventions.
