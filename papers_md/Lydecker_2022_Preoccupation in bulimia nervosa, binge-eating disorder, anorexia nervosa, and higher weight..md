Abstract

Objective:  Preoccupation (excessive and constant thoughts) about shape/weight and food/eating 
are thought to be prominent in individuals with eating disorders but have received much less 
research than overt behavioral features. This study examined the significance and distinctiveness 
of different foci of preoccupation in individuals categorized with different forms of eating 
disorders and in individuals with higher weight.

Method:  Participants (N=1363) completed a web-based survey with established measures of 
eating-disorder psychopathology and depression. The current study compared preoccupation 
among individuals with core features of bulimia nervosa (BN; n=144), binge-eating disorder 
(BED; n=576), anorexia nervosa (AN; n=48), and higher body weight (BMI≥25) without eating-
disorder features (HW; n=595). Associations of each type of preoccupation with other eating-
disorder psychopathology and depression were examined both between and within study groups.

Results:  Preoccupation with shape/weight and with food/eating showed a graded pattern of 
statistically significant differences: AN and BN had higher preoccupation than BED, which was 
higher than HW. Within BN, BED, and AN study groups, correlation magnitudes of shape/weight 
and food/eating preoccupation with eating-disorder psychopathology and depression did not differ 
significantly. Within the HW group, shape/weight preoccupation was significantly more strongly 
correlated than food/eating preoccupation with overvaluation, body dissatisfaction, and depression.

Discussion:  The preoccupation cognitive style, as well as focus, appears associated with 
other facets of eating-disorder psychopathology and depression. If results are confirmed among 
individuals with formal diagnoses, clinicians addressing maladaptive cognitions in CBT should 
consider the role of preoccupation. Future research should investigate whether preoccupation 
predicts or moderates eating disorder treatment outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Preoccupation is a form of cognition that involves constant and excessive thoughts and can 
cause impairment in daily functioning, such as being unable to focus on a conversation. 
Other forms of cognition, such as overvaluation (excessive self-evaluation based on 
weight or shape) are considered core features of eating disorders, but preoccupation has 
received much less attention in the literature. Among individuals with eating-disorder 
psychopathology, the content of preoccupied thoughts often focuses on body image (shape 
and weight) and food/eating. The limited work on preoccupation with shape/weight has 
shown that among individuals with AN, preoccupation with shape/weight is associated 
with impaired work and social functioning, poorer general psychopathology, and slower 
improvement in cognitive-behavioral therapy (Calugi, El Ghoch, Conti, & Dalle Grave, 
2018). In a clinical sample of patients with BED, preoccupation with shape/weight was more 
strongly associated with eating concerns than body dissatisfaction, overvaluation, or fear 
of weight gain (Lydecker, White, & Grilo, 2017). Among those with BN, preoccupation 
with shape/weight was central to eating-disorder psychopathology and highly associated 
with depressive and anxious symptomatology (Levinson et al., 2017). Among adolescent 
girls, preoccupation with shape/weight was more strongly associated with dietary restraint 
and binge eating than other body-image constructs (Mitchison et al., 2017). Longitudinally, 
among individuals with heterogenous eating-disorder diagnoses, preoccupation with shape/
weight was associated with global eating-disorder psychopathology and fasting (Askew et 
al., 2020).

These findings suggest that preoccupation with shape/weight is associated consistently 
with eating concerns and disordered eating behaviors as well as broader eating-disorder 
psychopathology. An additional focus of preoccupation is food and eating. Much less is 
known about preoccupation with food/eating than preoccupation with shape/weight, and 
the two preoccupation constructs have not been examined in the context of the other nor 
compared, despite being administered in parallel on eating disorder measures such as 
the Eating Disorder Examination interview and questionnaire (Fairburn & Beglin, 1994; 
Fairburn & Cooper, 1993). Most of the existing literature on preoccupation with food/eating 
examines its relationship to food restriction and dieting (Jones & Rogers, 2003; King, 
Herman, & Polivy, 1987; Polivy, 1996). A study comparing women engaged in dieting 
with women engaged in binge eating found that in both groups, women with higher levels 
of preoccupation with food/eating also had higher levels of dietary restraint (Timmerman 
& Gregg, 2003). These findings suggest the need to examine preoccupation with shape/
weight and preoccupation with food/eating together in their relationship with eating-disorder 
psychopathology.

The current study compared preoccupation with shape/weight and preoccupation with food/
eating among individuals with core features of BN, BED, AN, and those without eating-
disordered features with higher weight (HW) in terms of associations with eating-disorder 
psychopathology and depression, both within and between study groups. We selected these 
groups because shape/weight preoccupation has been examined in eating disorder samples, 
and food/eating preoccupation has been examined in samples of individuals engaging in 
restriction or weight loss.

METHOD

Participants

Measures

Participants were 1363 individuals from a larger group of 3283 individuals who completed 
an internet-based survey advertised as a study on weight, eating, dieting, and health-related 
behaviors. Data from this study have been used previously, including in a study that 
compared different body image constructs, including preoccupation, with select clinical 
variables (Grilo, Ivezaj, Lydecker, & White, 2019). Respondents who met criteria for one 
of the study groups (BN, BED, AN, or HW) were included in the current study. All 
participants provided electronic informed consent prior to surveys. Data are available from 
the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Participants included 159 (11.7%) men and 1199 (88.3%) women (5 participants did 
not report gender). Participants self-reported race/ethnicity: 80.5% White (n=1091), 6.3% 
Black (n=85), 6.1% Latinx/Hispanic (n=83), 3.6% Asian (n=49), 3.5% “other” (n=48; 7 
participants did not report race/ethnicity). Mean age was 36.20 (SD=12.52) years. Mean 
BMI was 32.85 (SD=9.14) kg/m2.

Body Mass Index (BMI).—Participants reported their height and weight, which were used 
to calculate BMI.

Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns—Revised (QEWP-R).—The 
QEWP-R measures eating disorder psychopathology that aligns with DSM-IV eating-
disorder diagnostic criteria over the past 6 months (Yanovski, 1993). The presence of each 
eating-disorder behavior is first assessed as “yes” or “no” and then frequency is assessed. 
Frequency items are scored on a five-point scale from “Less than once a week” through 
“More than five times a week”.

Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q).—The EDE-Q measures 
eating-disorder psychopathology over the past 28 days using a seven-point scale for items 
(Fairburn & Beglin, 1994). The EDE-Q assesses the frequency of binge eating and various 
purging behaviors (vomiting, laxative misuse, diuretic misuse frequency); these were used in 
the algorithms to create the four study groups. The EDE-Q also assesses associated eating-
disorder psychopathology, including the preoccupation with food/eating and preoccupation 
with shape/weight constructs. Rather than relying on the original EDE-Q subscales, we 
employed the brief alternative version of the EDE-Q, which consists of seven items

comprising three subscales (Restraint [3 items], Overvaluation [2 items], and Dissatisfaction 
[2 items]), for two reasons. First, this version shows superior psychometric properties than 
the original full EDE-Q structure in both clinical and non-clinical studies (Grilo et al., 2010; 
Grilo, Reas, Hopwood, & Crosby, 2015; Machado, Grilo, & Crosby, 2018). Second, the brief 
factor structure does not include the preoccupation items in subscales, thereby eliminating 
any problem with item overlap in the analyses. In the current study, the three subscales from 
the brief version were internally consistent, α=.87–.96.

For descriptive purposes, given the paucity of research on preoccupation, we also examined 
the proportion of individuals meeting a clinical threshold for preoccupation of food and 
eating, and a clinical threshold for preoccupation of shape and weight. The clinical threshold 
used the convention of a score of 4 (“moderate”) on the EDE-Q item.

Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI).—The BDI measures depressive features and 
symptoms on a 4-point scale (0 through 3) (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1987). Items cover a 
wide range of negative affect associated with depression, and the total score is strongly 
correlated with both self-reported depression and anxiety (Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988; 
Watson & Clark, 1984). In the current study, the items yielded an internally consistent total 
score, α=.91.

Creation of Study Groups

Study groups were created using items from the QEWP-R and EDE-Q. Participants with 
core features of BN reported at least weekly binge eating (eating an unusually large amount 
of food and experiencing a loss of control while eating) over the past 6 months (“1 episode 
per week” through “14 or more episodes per week” endorsed on QEWP-R), at least weekly 
purging (vomiting, laxative misuse, and diuretic misuse total minimum frequency of at least 
4 in the past 28 days on the EDE-Q), at least moderate overvaluation of shape or weight 
(“moderate” score of 4 or greater on either overvaluation of weight or overvaluation of shape 
on EDE-Q), and a BMI at least 18.5 kg/m2. Note that the BN group required the presence 
of overvaluation of shape/weight, thereby creating a restricted range of scores above the 
clinical threshold for this one specific body-image variable. We used the overvaluation 
continuous composite score (mean of overvaluation of weight and overvaluation of shape) 
in correlations, but the clinical threshold in the creation of study groups. The BED study 
group had at least weekly binge eating, at least moderate distress about loss of control 
(“moderate” score of 3 or greater on the EDE-Q), less than weekly purging (vomiting, 
laxative misuse, and diuretic misuse total minimum frequency fewer than 4 in the past 28 
days on the EDE-Q), and a BMI at least 18.5 kg/m2. Participants with core features of 
AN had a BMI below 18.5 kg/m2 and endorsed a clinical level (“moderate” score of 4 or 
greater) on restraint over eating, food avoidance, or dietary rules. The HW study group had a 
minimum BMI of 25 kg/m2, less than weekly binge eating, and less than weekly purging.

Statistical Analyses

Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and chi-square tests compared the four study groups 
(BN, BED, AN, HW) on demographic variables, preoccupation with food/eating, and 
preoccupation with shape/weight. Post-hoc tests using a Tukey correction for multiple

comparisons examined pairwise differences. Pearson correlation coefficients examined 
associations between clinical characteristics and preoccupation (food/eating and shape/
weight) within each study group. Fisher’s r-to-z test compared the magnitude of correlations 
within and between study groups when correlations were significant. Regression models 
compared the individual contributions of preoccupation with food/eating and preoccupation 
with shape/weight for each clinical characteristic with each study group.

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes demographic characteristics of BN, BED, AN, and HW study groups. 
The HW group had a significantly higher mean age than the BED and BN groups (who 
did not differ significantly from each other) and compared with the AN group (who was 
also significantly younger than BED and BN groups). There were some group differences 
in race/ethnicity, as shown in Table 1. The BN and AN groups had significantly higher 
proportions of women compared to the BED and HW groups (but the BN and AN groups 
did not differ significantly from each other). Table 2 describes the clinical characteristics of 
each study group. The mean BMI of the BN group was significantly lower than the HW and 
BED groups (who did not differ significantly from each other). The mean BMI of the AN 
group was significantly lower than all other groups.

There was a significant, graded relationship in both shape/weight preoccupation (F(3,

on both forms of preoccupation than BED, which was in turn higher on both forms of 
preoccupation than HW. Similarly, proportions of individuals with BN, BED, AN, and HW 
who endorsed clinical levels of preoccupation with shape/weight (χ2(3, N=1353)=148.30, 
p<.001, φ=.331) and preoccupation with food/eating (χ2(3, N=1347)=163.24, p<.001, 
φ=.348) followed a similar graded pattern (see Table 2). A significantly greater proportion of 
individuals with AN had clinical levels of shape/weight preoccupation (53.2%) than all other 
groups. A significantly greater proportion of individuals with AN had clinical levels of food/
eating preoccupation (57.4%) than BED and HW but did not differ significantly from BN. 
A significantly greater proportion of individuals with BN had clinical levels of both forms 
of preoccupation (shape/weight preoccupation: 69.4%, food/eating preoccupation: 57.3%) 
than individuals with BED (shape/weight preoccupation: 38.3%, food/eating preoccupation: 
28.6%), who had in turn a significantly greater proportion than individuals categorized with 
HW (shape/weight preoccupation: 19.6%, food/eating preoccupation: 11.8%).

Across study groups, the correlation of shape/weight preoccupation with food/eating 
preoccupation was higher for AN (r=.85; p<.01 for all correlation comparisons) but 
other groups had similar magnitudes (BN r=.64, BED r=.68, HW r=.63, p>.05 for 
all correlation comparisons). Correlations of each form of preoccupation with eating-
disorder psychopathology and depression, as well as significant differences in correlation 
magnitudes, are summarized in Table 3. Within the BN study group, there were no 
significant differences in the magnitude of associations of shape/weight preoccupation 
and food/eating preoccupation and dietary restraint, dissatisfaction with shape/weight, or 
depression. Likewise, there were no significant differences in correlation magnitudes within

the BED and AN study groups. However, within the HW study group, overvaluation 
had a significantly stronger association with shape/weight preoccupation than food/eating 
preoccupation (Z=−2.02, p=.04). In the HW group, dissatisfaction was significantly 
more strongly associated with shape/weight preoccupation than food/eating preoccupation 
(Z=−2.35, p=.02), and depression also had a significantly stronger association with shape/
weight preoccupation than food/eating preoccupation (Z=−2.34, p=.02). Other correlation 
magnitudes did not differ significantly.

Significant differences in correlation magnitudes between study groups are also summarized 
in Table 3. Between study groups, the correlation of shape/weight preoccupation and 
overvaluation did not differ significantly between BED, AN, and HW. The association of 
shape/weight preoccupation and dietary restraint was significantly stronger in the AN study 
group than all other study groups (BN: Z=3.95, p<.001, BED: Z=3.99, p<.001, HW: Z=3.99, 
p<.001). The association of food/eating preoccupation and dietary restraint was significantly 
stronger in the AN study group than BED (Z=2.24, p=.025) and HW (Z=2.27, p=.023) 
but did not differ significantly from BN. The association of shape/weight preoccupation 
and dissatisfaction was significantly stronger in the AN study group than all other study 
groups (BN: Z=3.43, p<.001, BED: Z=4.10, p<.001, HW: Z=3.31, p<.001). In addition, the 
association of shape/weight preoccupation and dissatisfaction was significantly stronger in 
the HW study group than the BED study group (Z=−2.13, p=.03). The association of food/
eating preoccupation and dissatisfaction was significantly stronger in the AN study group 
than BED (Z= 3.29, p<.001) and HW (Z= 3.09, p=.002). The association of shape/weight 
preoccupation and depression was significantly stronger in the AN study group than BN 
(Z= 2.14, p=.033) but did not differ significantly from BED or HW. The association of food/
eating preoccupation and depression was significantly stronger in the AN study group than 
all other study groups (BN: Z=2.52, p=.012, BED: Z= 2.31, p=.021, HW: Z= 2.95, p=.003). 
The correlation magnitudes for shape/weight preoccupation and other variables did not differ 
significantly between groups. The correlation magnitudes for food/eating preoccupation and 
other variables did not differ significantly between groups.

Regression models showed similar patterns as correlations, with some notable differences 
(see Table 4 for all regression models). All regression models were significant for dietary 
restraint, body dissatisfaction, and depression, for each study group. The regression model 
of overvaluation was significant in AN, BED, and HW study groups but not BN. No 
regression models were significant for BMI, in any study group. Food/eating preoccupation 
accounted for a significant proportion of variance in BN, BED, and HW study groups but 
not AN; shape/weight preoccupation was only significant in the AN study group. For body 
dissatisfaction, shape/weight preoccupation accounted for a significant amount of variance 
in dissatisfaction in all study groups, but food/eating preoccupation was not significant.

DISCUSSION

Our findings add to our understanding of the relatively understudied construct of 
preoccupation among individuals with core features of eating disorders. To our knowledge, 
this is the first study to examine how preoccupation with two targets—shape/weight and 
food/eating—compare among individuals categorized with BN, BED, AN, and non-eating-

disordered HW. One important finding is that the two forms of preoccupation are more 
strongly associated in the AN study group compared with other study groups. We also 
found that for the AN group, both forms of preoccupation were, overall, more strongly 
associated with psychopathology than for the BN, BED and HW groups. While there 
were no significant within-group differences in these two preoccupation targets and clinical 
characteristics among individuals categorized with BN, BED, and AN, there were some 
significant within-group differences among individuals in the HW study group. Additionally, 
the pattern of whether each form of preoccupation accounted for a significant amount of 
variance in each clinical characteristic showed overall similarities across groups.

Preoccupation with both content areas was highest in AN and greater in the BN study 
group than in BED, and both preoccupations in BED were in turn greater than in HW. Prior 
studies have identified shape/weight preoccupation as a distinct body-image construct that 
is strongly correlated with eating concerns in BED and is a central feature to the severity 
and maintenance of symptoms in BN (Askew et al., 2020; Grilo et al., 2019; Levinson et 
al., 2017; Lydecker et al., 2017). Preoccupation with food/eating has been associated with 
higher levels of dietary restraint in women engaging in dieting or binge eating (Timmerman 
& Gregg, 2003). Our findings extend this work by showing evidence that both types of 
preoccupation are part of the psychopathology of BN, BED, and AN, not just shape/weight 
preoccupation.

Notably, correlations and regressions with BMI did not have significant associations with 
either form of preoccupation in any of the study groups. In contrast, overvaluation, 
dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint had significant correlations with both forms of 
preoccupation in BED, AN, and HW study groups. In the BN study group, overvaluation 
and dissatisfaction were not associated significantly with food/eating preoccupation and 
overvaluation was not associated significantly associated with shape/weight preoccupation. 
However, this pattern may have been partly due to the requirement of clinical overvaluation 
of shape or weight in the categorization of the BN study group. The non-significance of 
BMI with shape/weight preoccupation and food/eating preoccupation highlights that eating-
disorder psychopathology, including maladaptive body-image and eating cognitions, occurs 
across the weight spectrum. In addition to eating-disorder psychopathology, depression 
was significantly associated with both types of preoccupation in all study groups. The 
strong relationship between depression and both types of preoccupation indicates that 
preoccupation is associated with negative affect not only in individuals with core features of 
eating disorders, but in individuals without eating disorders as well.

Correlations between preoccupation items and other eating-disorder psychopathology did 
not differ in magnitude within BN, BED, or AN study groups, although there were some 
differences within the non-eating-disordered HW group. These findings suggest there may 
be a greater distinction between shape/weight preoccupation and food/eating preoccupation 
in their relation to aspects of eating-disorder psychopathology in individuals without 
core features of eating disorders. Differences within the HW group suggested that shape/
weight preoccupation was more strongly associated with psychopathology than food/eating 
preoccupation, which highlights the particular importance of body image in non-eating-
disordered groups. Our findings contribute to the existing literature by providing evidence

that within BN, BED, and AN groups, preoccupation with shape/weight and preoccupation 
with food/eating are not differentially associated with other clinical characteristics, as they 
occur with comparably high associations.

As a complement to these findings regarding the magnitude of correlations within groups, 
we also compared the magnitude of correlations between groups and whether each form of 
preoccupation accounted for a significant amount of variance. Both forms of preoccupation 
had stronger associations with most clinical variables in the AN group compared with other 
study groups. This suggests that preoccupation (with both content forms) has particular 
relevance for individuals with core features of AN. In contrast, we observed a pattern in 
the regression models suggesting that the content of the preoccupation had a greater role 
than the study group, per se. That is, food/eating preoccupation accounted for a significant 
amount of variance in dietary restraint in BN, BED, and HW but not AN. The reverse 
was true for dissatisfaction, where shape/weight preoccupation accounted for a significant 
amount of variance in dissatisfaction but food/eating preoccupation was not significant. 
Findings for the HW group for the other variables showed the same pattern as correlation 
magnitudes: shape/weight preoccupation was more strongly associated with overvaluation 
and depression than food/eating preoccupation.

Taken together, these findings suggest the potential utility of future work considering how 
the content of preoccupation, when present, relates to psychopathology. If replicated and 
extended in future studies, such findings would suggest greater focus on the cognitive 
style of preoccupation might potentially enhance interventions for eating disorders. For 
example, the recommended treatment for eating disorders, cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) (Agras, 2019; Grilo, 2017; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2017), 
focuses on overvaluation of shape/weight as the central maladaptive cognitive process 
conceptualized to maintain behavioral, emotional, and other cognitive features of eating 
disorders (Fairburn, Cooper, & Shafran, 2003). Prior work has additionally emphasized the 
importance of considering preoccupation with shape/weight as part of treatment planning 
and delivery, particularly in relation to eating concerns and dietary restraint (Askew et al., 
2020; Lydecker et al., 2017; Mitchison et al., 2017). Our findings suggest that preoccupation 
as a cognitive style (i.e., both food/eating and shape/weight preoccupation) could be helpful 
to address for those patients who experience these types of thoughts. However, this should 
be interpreted within the context of the study’s limitations, detailed below, and should be 
tested prior to applying in clinical treatment.

Our findings should be considered in the context of the study’s strengths and limitations. 
The study design was cross-sectional and examined associations, so no conclusions about 
causality of differences in forms of preoccupation can be determined. An important 
extension of our work in light of these findings would be to examine shape/weight 
preoccupation and food/eating preoccupation prospectively and in treatment-seeking 
samples to understand whether the content of the preoccupation is associated with clinical 
characteristics or treatment outcomes, as well as whether specific interventions targeting 
preoccupation improve treatment outcomes. Notably, participants were categorized into 
study groups based on self-report measures, rather than clinical interviews or observational 
data, and are therefore subject to reporting biases. However, it is possible that self-report

might facilitate more honest reporting, particularly when anonymous and when subject 
matter is sensitive, as was the case with these data. Our findings should be confirmed 
in samples that have clinical diagnoses of BN, BED, and AN before applying findings 
to clinical treatment. Lastly, our sample was primarily White and female. Future research 
examining whether these findings are more broadly generalizable to the important groups 
not well-represented in our sample is essential.

The current study contributes to the existing literature by examining preoccupation with 
shape and weight alongside preoccupation with food and eating in individuals with core 
features of BN, BED, AN, and non-eating-disordered HW. The results indicate that both 
types of preoccupation are significantly higher in AN and BN than BED and in turn HW, 
but that some individuals in all study groups reported clinically significant levels of both 
preoccupation with shape/weight and preoccupation with food/eating. These findings hold 
important implications for treatment research, including developing and testing interventions 
for preoccupation. It is also recommended that CBT clinicians and clinical-researchers think 
more broadly about the importance of preoccupied cognitions across eating disorders, in 
thought logs, cognitive restructuring interventions, and treatment formulation.
