ABSTRACT
Although no psychotropic medication is specifically effective for dissociative symptoms, certain abusive substances can mark-
edly alter these symptoms. Regarding psychotropic medications, a positive response was observed in certain patients with dis-
sociative symptoms who also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for which methylphenidate extended release 
(MER) was administered. A is a female in her twenties and has dissociative identity disorder (DID) and ADHD. Primary person-
ality A1 is usually on duty but always on guard, as her other personality, A2, often attempts to disturb A1. A1's job is also ham-
pered by careless mistakes due to her ADHD. After A was put on MER, A1 felt that A2's presence suddenly faded away while on 
duty and she could focus better on her job as a result. B is a middle- aged male with DID and ADHD whose life is disturbed by the 
occasional appearance of a violent and disruptive personality. When MER was administered for his ADHD symptoms, it helped 
him stay alert, and his violent episodes decreased significantly. C is a young male university student with occasional dissociative 
“foggy” episodes that leave him with amnesia. He is diagnosed with depersonalization- derealization disorder (DDD) and ADHD. 
After MER was administered for his ADHD symptoms, his dissociative episodes diminished markedly, and his job performance 
improved significantly as a result. When MER is administered for patients with dissociative conditions and comorbid ADHD, it 
appears to have positive effects on their dissociative symptoms, including increasing the threshold separating different personal-
ities or diminishing depersonalization symptoms.

1   |   Background

Dissociative disorder is a complex, protean, and intriguing con-
dition, the understanding and treatment of which remains con-
troversial  among  clinicians.  Dissociative  symptoms  are  often 
unpredictable and arise suddenly, disturbing the social and daily 
function of individuals with this condition. However, there is a 
general  understanding  among  clinicians  that  there  is  no  psy-
chotropic medication that improves dissociative symptoms  [1]. 

Clinical observations sometimes provide a glimpse of how cer-
tain  chemical  agents  may  affect  the  degree  and  nature  of  dis-
sociative  conditions.  Notably,  some  psychedelic  or  anesthetic 
agents are known to be “dissociative,” causing dissociation- like 
experiences  among  individuals  with  no  known  dissociative 
disorder.

Among the many substances of abuse, alcohol appears to have 
a potent effect on dissociative conditions. One of my patients,

a  middle- aged  corporate  employee  with  dissociative  iden-
tity disorder (DID) was well adapted to his daily office work. 
During  one  of  his  regular  clinical  visits,  he  appeared  com-
posed  as  usual  and  reported  occasional  switching  between 
different  personalities.  After  the  visit,  he  had  a  can  of  beer 
on  his  way  home,  became  inebriated,  and  decided  to  return 
for another “small chat” with me. When I saw him again, he 
demonstrated  rapid  and  uncontrollable  shifts  in  personality. 
At one moment, he was in a very challenging and emotional 
male  personality  state,  making  some  derogatory  remarks, 
then shifted back to his usual composed main personality and 
apologized for the rude behavior (usually, this patient is often 
co- conscious  of  other  personalities'  remarks  and  behaviors), 
only to return to his challenging and wild state. In my obser-
vations, consuming even small amounts of alcohol or benzo-
diazepine  can  significantly  reduce  the  threshold  separating 
different personalities in patients with DID.

In contrast, stimulant drugs appear to increase this threshold. 
One of my patients with DID, a female in her twenties with a his-
tory of amphetamine abuse, had occasional dissociative fugues 
that often disrupted her social and personal life. Her own obser-
vation was that her fugue never occurs when she is under the 
influence of amphetamine, and this was one of the reasons she 
continued to use the drug.

During my practice with dissociative patients, I became aware 
that  certain  psychotropic  medications  may  also  improve  pa-
tients' dissociative conditions. A proportion of my patients with 
dissociative  disorders  also  have  attention  deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) symptoms, for which I administered methyl-
phenidate  extended  release  (MER,  Concerta)  to  alleviate  their 
ADHD symptoms. Unexpectedly, I discovered that in many of 
these patients, not only were their ADHD symptoms alleviated, 
but their dissociative symptoms also improved significantly.

Curiously,  there  are  only  a  few  psychiatric  literatures  which 
discuss  methylphenidate  or  MER's  effectiveness  on  disso-
ciative  symptoms.  One  case  report  states  that  a  middle- aged 
woman with DID and ADHD showed marked improvement in 
Dissociative Experiences Scale when methylphenidate was ad-
ministered [2]. Two case reports discuss MER's effectiveness on 
depersonalization, but not on dissociative symptoms in general 
[3, 4].

In  this  report,  I  describe  clinical  examples  that  I  encountered 
and  discuss  the  potential  effectiveness  of  MER  on  dissociative 
symptoms.

2   |   Case Presentation

A is a female in her late twenties with a diagnosis of DID. She was 
also diagnosed with ADHD during childhood. She has worked 
at a law firm for the past several years after graduating from law 
school. Her main personality, A1, performs her job fairly well, 
but because of her attentional problems, A1 often makes careless 
mistakes. A1's job is hampered by another personality, A2, who 
often attempts to take over A1 when the latter is off guard. A2, 
a  self- reported  adolescent  female  personality,  usually  appears 
when A comes off duty and feels relaxed at home by herself or 

with  her  close  friends  who  know  of  A's  dissociative  problems. 
A1 reports that during her work hours, she is on constant guard 
so as not to be taken over by A2, as A1 is aware that A2 is some-
where in her mind, impatient to wait until A1 comes off duty.

When A began psychotherapy with Dr. D (a female psychiatrist 
under my supervision), A1 was the primary person to talk to her 
therapist.  However,  as  the  therapeutic  relationship  developed, 
A1 became more relaxed and emotionally dependent on Dr. D, 
and A1 was sometimes taken over by A2 in the middle of the ses-
sion. This switch started to occur earlier and earlier in the ses-
sion until A1 could hardly talk to Dr. D. Around this time, MER 
(18 mg) was initiated for her ADHD symptoms to help improve 
her work focus. On the day of the first dose of MER, A1 reported 
that A2's presence was “suddenly gone” from her mind. After A 
started using MER, she could remain as A1 during her sessions 
with Dr. D. However, A1 was concerned that her internal world 
had drastically changed, and decided to temporarily suspend the 
use of MER. As a result, A2 soon returned, and A began to take 
MER “as needed” instead of taking it regularly.

B  is  a  middle- aged  male  with  DID  who  experienced  a  severe 
trauma  in  his  childhood.  Apparently,  his  father  also  had  DID 
and  repeatedly  abused  him  sexually  and  physically  in  the  dis-
sociative context, of which his father remained largely unaware 
of.  This  may  have  been  due  to  B's  inattention  and  hyperactiv-
ity (B was diagnosed with ADHD in childhood) which irritated 
his  father.  B  developed  several  personality  states  very  early  in 
childhood.  Nonetheless,  B  achieved  reasonable  social  adapta-
tion  and  worked  in  a  local  grocery  store  while  living  with  his 
male partner. B states that sometimes two or three personalities 
are mixed or rapidly switching inside him, resulting in frequent 
memory lapses which considerably impair his job performance. 
Occasionally, B enters a trans- like state during his medical vis-
its to me, where he is no longer aware of who and where he is. 
In that trans- like state, B states that he might easily switch to a 
very aggressive personality if he is verbally abused by his male 
partner. After initiating MER for B's untreated ADHD in order 
to  improve  his  job  performance  (initially  18 mg  per  day,  then 
gradually increased to 56 mg), B reported that it helped him stay 
alert and much less confused about who he is and the tasks he is 
engaged in. His violent episodes quickly decreased as chances to 
switch to the aggressive personality were reduced.

C is a young male university student in his early twenties with 
occasional  dissociative  episodes.  He  was  also  diagnosed  with 
ADHD during childhood, with inattentiveness and hyperactiv-
ity. At the age of 17, when he was taking a written examination 
for  a  university,  he  suddenly  felt  “foggy”  and  unable  to  think 
or write. He then “came to” just before the end of his examina-
tion, and he failed it as was expected. C was examined neuro-
logically at a local hospital, and no organic etiology was found. 
Finally, C was diagnosed with depersonalization- derealization 
disorder  (DDD,  DSM- 5)  [5],  in  addition  to  ADHD,  by  a  local 
psychiatrist who referred C to me. C continued to demonstrate 
similar  trans- like  episodes  lasting  for  several  minutes,  partic-
ularly  when  he  was  stressed.  After  graduation,  C  managed  to 
get a temporary job as floor staff in a restaurant in the evening 
but continued to have trans- like dissociative episodes as well as 
inattentiveness and forgetfulness, which were considered to be 
due to his ADHD. When MER (18 mg/day) was administered to

help him cope with his work, the frequency of his trans- like ep-
isodes markedly diminished and his job performance improved 
significantly.

3   |   Discussion

This  report  is  based  on  observations  of  patients  with  DID 
and  other  dissociative  disorders  as  well  as  comorbid  ADHD. 
Patients' DID diagnosis is based on the DSM- 5 criteria and adult 
ADHD  diagnosis  is  made  independently  to  that  of  DID,  based 
on  the  DSM- 5  criteria  and  the  ASRS- v1.1  checklist,  and  MER 
was  administered  at  various  stages  of  their  treatment  course. 
Comorbidity  of  DID  and  ADHD  is  not  generally  discussed  in 
DSM- 5 or ICD- 11, nor in the literature with some exception [5].

The  administration  of  MER  strictly  followed  the  Japanese 
Concerta Circulation Management Committee guidelines.

Many of these patients showed a fair to good response, with im-
proved  ADHD  symptoms  as  well  as  some  side  effects  such  as 
irritation, nausea, and headache. However, unexpectedly, some 
patients  responded  remarkably  with  improved/altered  disso-
ciative symptoms. Administration of MER (18 ~ 54 mg) appears 
to be especially effective for those who tend to be in a state in 
which a couple or more personalities are in conflict and vying 
for  conscious  control.  MER  appears  to  increase  the  threshold 
separating different personalities and reduce the level of trans- 
like or depersonalization symptoms.

These  findings  may  be  generalizable  besides  the  three  cases 
described in the case presentation. Approximately 15% ~ 20% of 
my DID cases have a concurrent diagnosis of ADHD and I have 
observed favorable to good responses with MER in a significant 
minority of them.

This favorable effect on dissociative symptoms might not be lim-
ited to MER; psychostimulants in general and atomoxetine may 
share  similar  results,  based  on  my  anecdotal  experience.  One 
of my patients, a male corporate employee with DID who is on 
modafinil  for  his  sleep  disturbances,  reported  a  similar  effect 
on his “capacity to stay as himself” while he is on duty. Another 
patient with DDD demonstrated improved symptoms with ato-
moxetine (50 mg/day) administered for adult ADHD symptoms.

The opposite may apply to medications classified as “downers” 
such  as  benzodiazepine  and  other  GABAergic  medications,  as 
well  as  alcohol.  These  can  induce  a  dissociative  or  trance- like 
state and may promote personality shifts in patients with DID 
who  appear  to  suffer  a  reduction  in  the  threshold  separating 
personalities.  In  psychiatric  literature,  certain  authors  caution 
against the use of benzodiazepines for dissociative disorders as 
they may worsen symptoms [1].

Even  individuals  without  dissociative  disorders  can  exhibit  a 
trans- like  state  with  disinhibited  eating  behaviors  after  intake 
of  sleep  inducers  such  as  triazolam  and  zolpidem.  Needless  to 
say,  the  so- called  “black  out”  dissociative  state  is  so  common 
among those who consume excessive alcohol and become am-
nestic about their aberrant and uncharacteristic behaviors, and 
this can be understood in this context of this paper.

The neurobiological mechanisms of dissociative symptoms are 
far  from  being  clarified  and  more  research  is  needed  to  deter-
mine  the  best  psychopharmacological  treatment.  The  rela-
tionship  between  dissociative  symptoms  and  psychostimulant 
medications discussed in this report can aid future clinical re-
search in this area.
