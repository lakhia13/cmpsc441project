Abstract

A modular, transdiagnostic approach to treatment design and implementation may increase the 
public health impact of evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Such an approach relies on 
algorithms for selecting and implementing treatment components intended to have a specific 
therapeutic effect, yet there is little evidence for how components function independent of their 
treatment packages when employed in clinical service settings. This study aimed to demonstrate 
the specificity of treatment effects for two components of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(ACT), a promising candidate for modularization. A randomized, nonconcurrent, multiple-
baseline across participants design was used to examine component effects on treatment processes 
and outcomes in 15 adults seeking mental health treatment. The ACT OPEN module targeted 
acceptance and cognitive defusion; the ACT ENGAGED module targeted values-based activation 
and persistence. According to Tau- U analyses, both modules produced significant improvements 
in psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and targeted therapeutic processes. ACT ENGAGED 
demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life and values-based activation. ACT OPEN 
showed greater improvements in symptom severity, acceptance, and defusion. Both modules

improved awareness and non-reactivity, which were mutually targeted, though using distinct 
intervention procedures. Both interventions demonstrated high treatment acceptability, 
completion, and patient satisfaction. Treatment effects were maintained at 3-month follow up. 
ACT components should be considered for inclusion in a modular approach to implementing 
evidence-based psychosocial interventions for adults.

The public health impact of evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPI) remains 
relatively low despite a proliferation of efficacious treatments for a wide range of behavioral 
and mental health problems (McHugh & Barlow, 2012; Wang et al., 2005). This science-
practice gap may reflect a failure of the dominant intervention research paradigm to 
adequately address factors that influence the implementation of EBPI in usual care (Fairburn 
& Wilson, 2013; Kazdin & Blase, 2011; Rotheram-Borus, Swendeman, & Chorpita, 2012). 
Therapists report that they value the science behind EBPI, but are concerned that 
standardized manuals do not meet the needs of real-world clients and practice settings 
(Addis & Krasnow, 2000; Borntrager, Chorpita, Higa-McMillan, & Weisz, 2009; Nelson & 
Steele, 2007).

One promising approach to streamlining the translation of behavioral science to service is 
modularized treatment, which preserves the benefits of standardization inherent in 
manualized protocols, while allowing personalization through the use of algorithms for 
selecting treatment components. A recent randomized effectiveness trial for depression, 
anxiety, and conduct disorders in youth provides a compelling case example (Weisz et al., 
2012). Modular treatment outperformed both standardized manual-based treatments and 
usual care in rate of clinical improvement and number of diagnoses at post-treatment 
(Chorpita et al., 2013), as well as number of service settings utilized one-year after treatment 
was initiated (Park et al., 2015). Modularization may further increase EBPI impact through 
improved therapist-mediated implementation outcomes. For example, therapists trained in a 
modular approach, versus a standard sequential manual, showed more favorable attitudes 
toward EBPI, a predictor of EBPI adoption (Borntrager et al., 2009). Additionally, therapists 
perceived modular treatments as more effective than usual care and more responsive than 
standard EBPI, contributing to significantly greater therapist satisfaction with modular 
treatment – an effect that grew as therapists gained more experience with modular treatment 
cases (Chorpita et al., 2015).

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999, 2012) is a 
promising candidate for modularization because it is based on a transdiagnostic model that 
guides case formulation and selection of therapy tasks from a set of complementary 
treatment components, affording personalized treatment that is grounded in theory and 
evidence. ACT interventions are defined by their application of this psychological flexibility 
model, which specifies a set of modifiable processes involved in the development, 
maintenance, and amelioration of a broad range of problems in living (Hayes, Levin, Plumb-

Vilardaga, Villatte, & Pistorello, 2013; Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). As opposed to 
transdiagnostic approaches that allow for individualized targeting of multiple disorders 
within a unified treatment protocol, ACT specifies a set of clinical competencies that are 
applied based on a functional assessment of psychological flexibility, regardless of 
diagnoses (Luoma, Hayes, & Walser, 2007). ACT treatment effects are partially or fully 
mediated by changes in these psychological processes (Hayes, Villatte, Levin, & 
Hildebrandt, 2011) and a recent meta-analysis of ACT component interventions reported 
medium to large effects on targeted outcomes for treatment procedures suggested by the 
psychological flexibility model (Levin, Hildebrandt, Lillis, & Hayes, 2012). Similarly, a 
recent process analysis showed that each 1-unit increase in smoking counselors’ use of 
procedures targeting certain ACT processes resulted in a 42–52% lower odds of smoking at 
subsequent counseling sessions (Vilardaga, Heffner, Mercer, & Bricker, 2014). Finally, 
many elements of the psychological flexibility model are shared by modern contextual 
therapies (Hayes et al., 2011) and traditional cognitive and behavioral therapies (Arch & 
Craske, 2008; Hofmann & Asmundson, 2008), which could facilitate the adoption and 
integration of these components in a modular treatment approach.

The fact that a component is shared by multiple EBPIs, however, is not sufficient to guide 
clinical decisions; an effective modular treatment depends on algorithms for selecting which 
components to implement in which situation (Chorpita, Daleiden, & Weisz, 2005a). This 
requires evidence of how component procedures impact therapy processes and outcomes, 
and how components function when removed from the treatment protocols tested in efficacy 
trials (Hayes et al., 2013; Rosen & Davison, 2003). Dismantling studies provide one method 
of acquiring this knowledge, but their feasibility is limited by the very large samples 
required to compare multiple components. Single case experimental designs (SCED) 
provide a pragmatic alternative that, when well-designed and executed, rival the scientific 
rigor of randomized controlled trials while requiring far fewer participants (Barlow, Nock, 
& Hersen, 2008; Smith, 2012; Vilardaga, 2014). Further, SCED have been used effectively 
in modular treatment development and evaluation (Chorpita, Taylor, Francis, Moffitt, & 
Austin, 2004), in part because many of these designs are analogous to clinical decision-
making in a modular treatment approach.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the functional relationships between ACT 
intervention components, processes, and outcomes to inform the development of a modular, 
transdiagnostic treatment for adults. A randomized, nonconcurrent, multiple-baseline across 
participants design (N = 15) was used to examine the specificity of treatment effects for two 
ACT component modules; one targeting openness to thoughts, feelings, and sensations and 
the other emphasizing engagement in meaningful actions. These modules were examined in 
a sample of adults seeking treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Visual and 
statistical analyses were employed to compare module effects on process and outcome 
measures across baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases. It was hypothesized that both 
interventions would produce improvements in psychiatric symptoms and quality of life, as 
well as in mutually targeted psychological processes. Group differences were expected in 
processes that were uniquely targeted by only one intervention module. Results of this

proof-of-concept study will inform the development and evaluation of actuarial guidelines 
for selecting and implementing ACT components in a modular treatment design.

Method

Participants

Since ACT interventions target core processes that cross-cut psychiatric diagnoses, study 
inclusion was based on clinically significant psychological distress rather than diagnostic 
criteria. Participants were required to meet clinical case status (general severity index T 
score ≥ 63) on the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993) and be 18 years or older. 
Individuals with active psychotic symptoms and those who could not read assessment 
measures written in English were excluded from study participation.

Participants were recruited through announcements in a community newspaper in northern-
Nevada and 63 people were assessed by phone for study eligibility. Eighteen people met 
inclusion criteria and were invited to meet with an assessor for a two-hour clinical interview. 
The assessor confirmed eligibility, administered the Structured Clinical Interview Disorder 
for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002) for sample 
description purposes, and obtained demographic information and consent for participation. 
Three participants dropped out after index assessment, but before random assignment, due to 
scheduling constraints. No participants refused participation after random assignment and all 
randomized participants (N = 15) were included in the main analyses.

Table 1 details participant demographics and diagnostic profiles at baseline. At time of 
enrollment, 67% were currently taking psychiatric medications. Of those 10 participants, 
100% took one SSRI antidepressant, 13.3% took one benzodiazepine, and 6.7% took a 
stimulant. All participants denied medication changes during the study period. There were 
no statistically significant differences between treatment conditions on any demographic or 
diagnostic variables.

Design and Treatment Assignment

The study was designed to evaluate the specificity of ACT component effects on therapy 
processes and outcomes. A randomized, nonconcurrent, multiple-baseline across participants 
design was employed to ensure timely treatment delivery while minimizing threats to 
internal validity.

A randomized block design was used to ensure roughly equivalent numbers of participants 
per baseline length, therapist, and treatment module. Following enrollment, participants 
were randomly allocated to an assessment-only baseline of 3, 4, or 5 weeks in fixed blocks 
of 3 using a computer random number generator. During baseline, participants received 
email reminders to complete weekly assessment packets and mail them to the assessor. 
Upon completion of baseline assessment, participants were allocated to therapist and 
intervention module in randomly varied blocks of 3–5 generated by a computer random 
number generator. Weekly assessments continued during the 8-week intervention phase 
following each treatment session. To increase study retention and reduce missing data, 
follow-up assessments were scheduled every four weeks for a total of three months.

Participants received email reminders to complete monthly assessment packets and mail 
them to the assessor. In total, participants completed outcome and process measures at 14–
16 time points, spanning baseline-, intervention-, and follow-up phases.

Interventions

ACT OPEN module—The ACT OPEN module consisted primarily of procedures 
targeting the acceptance and cognitive defusion processes of the psychological flexibility 
model, with the aim of reducing harmful responses to thoughts, feelings, and sensations. 
Early sessions explored clients’ conceptualizations of the presenting problem and therapists 
used metaphors and experiential exercises to orient clients to the short and long-term 
consequences of strategies they had employed to solve these problems. Throughout the 
module, therapists used language that fostered an open and curious stance toward 
psychological experiences and practiced non-evaluative awareness of thoughts, feelings, and 
sensations. Therapists introduced defusion strategies intended to evoke new responses to 
troublesome cognitions (e.g., thoughts are observed as if they are leaves floating on a 
stream). Defusion strategies were also employed to reduce the influence of self-concepts and 
beliefs that limit response flexibility.

ACT ENGAGED module—The ACT ENGAGED module consisted of procedures 
targeting the values and committed action processes of the psychological flexibility model, 
with the aim of increasing motivation and reinforcement for meaningful behaviors. Initial 
sessions explored personal values in order to instill a sense of purpose and direction. 
Therapists helped participants formulate their values as sources of satisfaction intrinsic to 
their own behavior, rather than as outcomes (e.g., achievement, praise) or in terms of 
negative reinforcement (e.g., escape from pain). Metaphors tailored to the client’s 
experience, such as that of a journey where purpose and meaning are found in each step and 
not only upon reaching one’s final destination, were used throughout the module to facilitate 
broadening and building behavioral repertoires and tracking contingencies that support 
valued action. Therapists used experiential exercises and language that oriented clients to 
their experience as a guide to effective action. For example, the metaphor of being guided by 
a compass versus a route on a roadmap oriented participants to the flexibility required to 
overcome obstacles and maintain a sense of direction when plans don’t proceed as expected. 
Therapists also employed behavioral commitment strategies to promote generalization and 
maintenance of valued action.

Module Overlap—ACT’s psychological flexibility model specifies two additional change 
processes (i.e., contact with the present moment and a sense of self as the context or 
container of one’s experiences). These processes manifest themselves as a flexible self-
awareness that allows one to experience distress without threat of psychological harm or 
annihilation, and to act intentionally, rather than reactively. Acting with awareness and 
intention are core targets in all ACT interventions and are considered essential to the 
treatment’s experiential approach to shaping in-session behavior in order to promote 
maintenance and generalization of treatment gains (Hayes et al., 2011). That is, a treatment 
that does not include procedures to facilitate fluid self-awareness would not be ACT-
adherent. Accordingly, these two processes were engaged, though not emphasized, in both

modules. However, each module targeted these processes using separate procedures that 
were completely distinct from the alternate treatment condition. For example, the ACT 
OPEN module employed meditation exercises designed to observe ongoing thoughts, 
feelings, and sensations without reacting to urges to change them. The ACT ENGAGED 
module did not include formal mindfulness exercises, but did train participants to be aware 
of their actions and the contexts in which they occur, so they could choose effective 
responses based on their personal values rather than react habitually. In summary, both 
modules targeted self-awareness processes, but there was zero overlap in therapy tasks or 
techniques.

Therapists, Assessors, and Setting

Assessments and treatment sessions occurred in video-equipped therapy rooms in a mental 
health clinic at the University of Nevada, Reno. The clinical assessor and therapists were 
doctoral students in clinical psychology with at least 3 years of training in ACT and directly 
supervised by a developer of the treatment (SCH). Each of the 4 therapists conducted each 
module with at least one participant and treated a minimum of 3 participants in the study.

Measures

Intervention Fidelity—Fidelity was assessed using the 16-item ACT Integrity Coding 
System (Plumb & Vilardaga, 2010). Adherence to the module protocol, therapist 
competence, frequency and depth of coverage of ACT processes, and use of ACT-
inconsistent strategies (e.g., cognitive or emotional suppression) were rated on a 
behaviorally anchored 5-point Likert-type scale. Twenty percent of each therapist’s sessions 
in each condition were rated for fidelity by two bachelors-level coders who completed 40 
hours of training with a peer-reviewed ACT trainer. Coders achieved a minimum of 85% 
reliability with the expert trainer and each other. Calibration meetings were conducted 
weekly during the rating process to minimize rater drift. Interrater reliability was calculated 
using the intraclass correlation coefficient (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979) and interpreted using 
Cicchetti (1994) standards. ICCs indicated excellent agreement between the two raters in the 
ACT OPEN (ICC = .94, 95% CI = .90, .96) and ACT ENGAGED (ICC = .96, 95% CI = .
95, .98) modules.

Treatment Acceptance—Treatment acceptance was assessed using the short form of the 
Treatment Evaluation Inventory (Kelley, Heffer, Gresham, & Elliott, 1989), with two 
questions omitted that applied only to family interventions. An independent assessor 
administered the measure at the end of each treatment session. Participants were informed 
that their responses would be kept confidential from therapists. In the current trial α = .96.

Treatment Outcome

Psychological symptom severity—The Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993) is 
a 53-item self-report inventory of psychological symptoms across nine domains and three 
global indices of distress. The global severity index of the BSI was used to measure 
psychological symptom severity, intensity, and number. In the current study, α = .85.

Quality of life—The 26-item version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life 
(Skevington, Lotfy, & O’Connell, 2004) was used to assess quality of life related to physical 
and psychological health, social relationships, and living environment. Given the slower 
nature of changes in these domains, the WHOQOL was administered on only six occasions: 
at index assessment, immediately prior to intervention phase, immediately following 
intervention phase, and at one-, two-, and three-month follow-up. In the current study, α = .
89.

Specific Change Processes

Cognitive Defusion—The Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Believability Scale (Zettle, 
Rains, & Hayes, 2011) measures the strength of one’s belief in negative automatic thoughts 
and has been shown to mediate ACT outcomes. This process is explicitly targeted in the 
ACT OPEN module, but not in ACT ENGAGED. In the current study α = .89.

Experiential Acceptance—The Nonjudging of Inner Experience subscale of the Five 
Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006) was 
used to assess acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. This process is explicitly 
targeted in the ACT OPEN module, but not in ACT ENGAGED. In the current study α = .
87.

Values-Based Action—The Values Bullseye (Lundgren, Luoma, Dahl, Strosahl, & 
Melin, 2012) is a visual analogue scale that measures congruence between behaviors and 
personally chosen values. This scale has demonstrated good test-retest reliability and 
criterion validity and has been a mediator of ACT outcomes. This process is explicitly 
targeted in the ACT ENGAGED module, but not in ACT OPEN. In the current study, α = .
95.

Common Change Processes

Awareness—The Acting with Awareness subscale of the FFMQ (Baer et al., 2006) was 
used to assess attention to one’s behaviors in the moment versus acting on “automatic pilot”. 
Both modules targeted this process, but using entirely different procedures with no 
overlapping therapy tasks between conditions. For example, the ACT OPEN module 
included guided exercises to practice fluid awareness of thoughts, feelings, sensations, and 
behaviors, while the ACT ENGAGED module practiced behaving intentionally and tracking 
the context and consequences of one’s actions. In the current study, α = .82.

Nonreactivity—The Nonreactivity to Inner Experiences subscale of the FFMQ (Baer et 
al., 2006) measures the tendency to allow thoughts, feelings, sensations, and urges to come 
and go without attachment or impulsive response. Both modules targeted nonreactivity, but 
using entirely different procedures with no overlapping therapy tasks between conditions. 
For example, the ACT OPEN module included the practice of observing thoughts and 
feelings without acting to change or escape them, while the ACT ENGAGED module 
practiced using one’s values, as opposed to positive or negative psychological experiences, 
as a guide for selecting meaningful responses and engaging in purposeful activities. In the

current study, α = .79, which is consistent with published reports of internal consistency in 
the FFMQ.

Analytic Strategy

A bottom-up analytic approach (Onghena & Edgington, 2005; Parker & Vannest, 2012) was 
employed beginning with visual analysis to identify patterns within and across study phases, 
then proceeding to statistical analysis of individual phase contrasts within participants and 
across treatment conditions. Nonparametric Tau-U analyses were conducted to evaluate 
individual and aggregated effect sizes. This approach is free from assumptions of 
distribution and linearity, robust to serial dependence inherent in time-series designs, 
superior in power and precision over other SCED effect size indices, and allows for 
examination of changes in both mean levels and trend (Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Sauber, 
2011).

For each participant, the percent of nonoverlap between all pairs of data was calculated to 
determine baseline trend, intervention trend, mean contrasts between baseline and 
intervention phases, and combined trend and mean contrasts. Individual phase and 
participant contrasts were combined and weighted to provide an omnibus index of effect size 
per condition and p values were calculated using effect sizes and standard errors. Tau is 
analogous to the Pearson R2 effect size, so it can be interpreted as the percent of the data 
variance accounted for by intervention effects.

Results

Treatment Fidelity

Treatment fidelity was highly rated for both the ACT OPEN (M = 4.53, SD = .05) and ACT 
ENGAGED (M = 4.72, SD = .04) modules. No sessions were coded as employing 
procedures inconsistent with ACT or targeting a process purposefully omitted from the 
treatment module (i.e., no contamination). There were no statistically significant differences 
in fidelity between therapists, conditions, or sessions.

Treatment Acceptance and Completion

Participants were presented with a description and rationale for each treatment module prior 
to randomization. No participant refused treatment after being informed about the 
intervention to which they were randomly assigned. Both ACT modules demonstrated 
excellent retention, with all participants completing all 8 treatment sessions. Both modules 
were viewed as acceptable, with no session rated below 3 and an average score of 4.17 on 
the 5-point scale of the TEI. All 7 participants assigned to the ACT OPEN module rated the 
treatment with an average score of 4 or better, with 50% of sessions rated with the highest 
possible score. Seventy-five percent of the 8 participants assigned to the ACT ENGAGED 
module rated the treatment with an average score of 4 or better, with 40% of sessions given 
the maximum rating. These differences were not statistically significant, t(13) = 1.73, p = .

Treatment Outcomes and Processes

Visual Analysis to Inform Statistical Approach—The initial correlation matrix of 
study variables is reported in Table 2. Figure 1 displays means and 95% confidence intervals 
for each of the outcome and process measures at each assessment point, by treatment 
condition. Visual inspection of the data detected no significant concerns about baseline 
trends, but baseline control was employed in Tau-U in order to be conservative in 
interpreting aggregated SCED results.

Visual analyses were consistent with previous studies suggesting ACT intervention trends 
carry-over into follow-up assessment phases (Luoma, Kohlenberg, Hayes, & Fletcher, 
2012). This pattern is ideal from a clinical perspective, demonstrating that the intervention 
leads to ongoing improvement even after treatment ends. Tau analyses confirmed no 
statistically significant differences in omnibus (i.e., combined level and trend) effects 
between intervention and follow-up phases. Hence, data from these phases were collapsed 
for Tau-U analysis; within-subject tests compared data prior to intervention (phase A) with 
data during and following intervention (phase B).

Visual analysis identified consistent data patterns (both within and between phases) with 
two exceptions that have implications for statistical analysis. First, improvements on the 
Values Bullseye, though large, did not occur until the fourth week in the intervention phase 
for all participants in the ACT ENGAGED module, which targeted this process explicitly. It 
has been suggested that inclusion of such a lag in statistical analysis would not fairly 
represent the amount of change due to the intervention (Parker & Vannest, 2012), so the first 
three weekly data points in the intervention phase were excluded from Tau-U analysis of the 
Values Bullseye.

The second aberrant pattern detected during visual inspection is that two participants 
receiving the ACT ENGAGED module displayed trends in opposite directions of their 
condition cohort (i.e., deterioration) on several measures. Exploratory analyses indicated 
that omission of the two outlying cases would not have affected the significance of any 
results; thus, they were retained in all final analyses. However, exploratory analyses of the 
nonresponders were conducted with the aim of identifying potential moderators to be 
explored in future studies. These results are reported in a separate section below.

Interpretation of Statistical Significance and Effect Sizes—Results of Tau-U 
analyses of within-subject treatment effects by treatment condition are reported in Table 3, 
while comparative effectiveness between the two intervention modules is reported in the 
text. Treatment effects are reported in terms of both level (i.e., percent of intervention and 
follow-up data showing improvement over baseline scores) and trend (i.e., percent of data 
showing improvement over previous intervention session). These effect sizes are 
transformed to a zero chance level and can be interpreted as small (0 – 31%), medium to 
large (32% – 84%), and very large (85% – 100%) effects (Parker & Vannest, 2009). An 
omnibus effect size combining level and trend improvements is also reported and can be 
interpreted as small (≈ .30), medium (≈ .50), and large (≈ .80) effects (Parker et al., 2011). 
Probability values less than p = .005 were rounded to p = .00.

Psychiatric symptom severity: Both ACT modules showed clinically (i.e., no longer met 
threshold for clinical caseness) and statistically (p < .001) significant improvement on the 
BSI, though their effect sizes differed. The ACT OPEN module had a large effect on 
symptom severity, while the ACT ENGAGED module showed only moderate 
improvements. When examining omnibus treatment effects between conditions, participants 
who received the ACT OPEN module showed moderately greater reductions in symptom 
severity over those who received the ACT ENGAGED (Tau-U = .30, SE = .09, p = .00).

Quality of life: All participants reported large WHOQoL improvements over baseline and 
these gains were maintained across the three months of follow-up assessment. However, 
participants in the ACT ENGAGED condition showed moderately greater improvements 
over those in the ACT ENGAGED condition (Tau-U = .38, SE = .17, p = .02).

Cognitive defusion: All participants in the ACT OPEN condition, which exclusively 
targeted this process, made immediate and substantial session-by session improvements in 
cognitive defusion. Participants in the ACT ENGAGED condition showed no changes in 
cognitive defusion. As predicted, the effects of the ACT OPEN module on this therapy 
process were significantly greater than the ACT ENGAGED module (Tau–U = .89, SE = .
11, p = .00).

Experiential Acceptance: All participants who received the ACT OPEN module showed 
substantial improvement in acceptance, with moderately large session-by-session gains and 
almost no deterioration during the 3-month follow-up period. The ACT ENGAGED module, 
which did not target this treatment process, showed no changes in acceptance over time. As 
predicted, the ACT OPEN condition showed much greater improvements over the ACT 
ENGAGED condition (Tau-U = .89, SE = .11, p = .00).

Values-based action: This process was explicitly targeted only by the ACT ENGAGED 
module, which produced large improvements over baseline scores and reliable session-by-
session growth in values-based action. Participants who received the ACT OPEN module 
demonstrated small improvements at follow-up relative to baseline scores on the Values 
Bullseye, though these improvements were not reliably linked to treatment trends and the 
omnibus treatment effect was not significant. The difference between modules was 
significant, with ACT ENGAGED demonstrating superior treatment effects (Tau-U = .54, 
SE = .10, p = .00).

Awareness and Nonreactivity: Both modules targeted the core ACT treatment processes of 
acting with awareness and intention, though they used different procedures to do so. 
Participants in both conditions showed large and steady treatment gains on the FFMQ-Act 
Aware and FFMQ-Nonreact scales. Between-group analyses detected no significant 
differences by condition for awareness (Tau-U = .02, SE = .20, p = .83) or nonreactivity 
(Tau-U = .01, SE = .09, p = .93).

Exploratory Nonresponder Analyses—One male and one female within the ACT 
ENGAGED condition were identified as outliers compared to participants within and across 
treatment conditions. These two cases displayed no clinically significant improvements on

any process or outcome measure. Compared to scores of other participants in the ACT 
ENGAGED condition, the two cases displayed 69% less improvement in quality of life (p 
= .04) and 68% less improvement in symptom severity (p = .00). These were the only cases 
in either condition to become more cognitively fused (Tau = .64, p = .00) and less accepting 
of thoughts and feelings (Tau = .56, p = .00), and to fail to show improvement in reactivity 
(Tau = .07, p = .71).

An analysis of participant characteristics at baseline revealed that the two nonresponsive 
cases were the only participants in the ACT ENGAGED condition to meet criteria for a 
current diagnosis of PTSD. These cases did not differ from participants in either condition at 
baseline on any demographic variable, number of past or current diagnoses, symptom 
severity, or any process measure. It is notable that the two participants in the ACT OPEN 
condition meeting criteria for a current PTSD diagnosis displayed patterns of improvement 
consistent with other participants within that treatment condition and showed no 
deterioration on process or outcome measures.

Discussion

The current study provides preliminary evidence supporting the inclusion of components of 
ACT’s psychological flexibility model in a modular transdiagnostic treatment that affords 
flexible use of techniques to target common core processes of therapeutic change. Both of 
the ACT component modules produced significant improvements in symptom severity and 
quality of life, but at different rates and magnitudes and using different techniques. The 
ACT OPEN module, which targeted acceptance and cognitive defusion processes, produced 
greater session-by-session improvement and larger overall reductions in symptom severity. 
In spite of its smaller effect on symptoms, the ACT ENGAGED module, which targeted 
values-based activation and behavioral commitment processes, produced greater quality of 
life improvements. This result is consistent with ACT’s psychological flexibility model, 
which makes a distinction between symptom reduction and well-being (Hayes et al., 2013).

Each ACT module produced sustained changes in the psychological processes that were 
uniquely and explicitly targeted by that component. Large improvements in acceptance and 
defusion were observed in the ACT OPEN condition, while these processes remained 
unchanged in the ACT ENGAGED condition. It is interesting to note that moderate 
symptom reduction and large quality of life improvements occurred even though judgment 
and believability of negative thoughts remained high in this condition. Conversely, the ACT 
ENGAGED module produced a 73% improvement in values-based behavior, which was the 
emphasis of this component intervention. Though the ACT OPEN component did not 
directly target values and commitment processes, it appears that some participants in this 
condition independently brought their behaviors into greater alignment with their personal 
values after learning to relate differently to their thoughts and feelings. Component 
interventions that produce these types of rapid, simultaneous improvements across multiple 
areas of functioning should be prioritized when considering common elements for inclusion 
in modular treatments.

Nonreactive awareness of one’s self and environment is a central feature of the 
psychological flexibility model and a common core element in all ACT interventions. Both 
ACT modules produced improvements in the awareness and nonreactivity facets of 
mindfulness, though by different means. The ACT ENGAGED module included procedures 
to help participants discover sources of inspiration and satisfaction in their own behavior and 
to intentionally choose responses with a purpose. Procedures in the ACT OPEN module 
helped participants maintain open awareness of their thoughts and feelings without 
attempting to alter their experience. Thus, different treatment techniques can be used to 
impact the same processes of change, allowing therapists the flexibility to adapt 
interventions for specific clients while maintaining fidelity to an evidence-based treatment 
model.

An effective personalized treatment relies on an understanding of patient characteristics that 
influence intervention processes and outcomes. Exploratory analyses of outlying cases 
revealed that participants in the ACT ENGAGED condition with a current diagnosis of 
PTSD showed no improvement or deterioration on several outcome and process measures. 
This pattern was inconsistent with all other study participants, including those in the ACT 
OPEN condition with a current PTSD diagnosis. This is insufficient evidence to draw 
conclusions about implementing these modules with PTSD patients, but the independent, 
additive, and order effects of acceptance and values interventions warrant further 
examination in this population.

It is possible that modules targeting acceptance and defusion may be necessary precursors to 
modules aimed at values-based behavioral activation for individuals with a current PTSD 
diagnosis. In a case study of ACT for treatment-resistant PTSD, Twohig (2009) found that 
values interventions were not tolerated until 6 sessions of acceptance, cognitive defusion, 
and self-as-context interventions (roughly equivalent to the current ACT OPEN module) 
were completed. Similarly, improvements in the FFMQ facets of nonjudgment and 
nonreactivity to inner experiences explained 19–24% of the variance in depression and 
PTSD outcomes in a residential CBT treatment for PTSD (Boden et al., 2012). In the current 
study, clients with PTSD in the ACT ENGAGED condition were the only study participants 
who did not show improvements on these measures. Future experimental studies should 
examine the impact of acceptance and values components and processes, in isolation and 
combination, in adults with PTSD.

Implications for modular treatment development, dissemination, and implementation

Therapists cannot be expected to learn each new treatment package supported by a 
randomized controlled trial, particularly when many EBPIs share core components and 
target similar psychological processes, making distinct training in complete treatment 
packages potentially redundant and unnecessary (Chorpita et al., 2011). A modular approach 
that provides training and guidelines for implementing evidence-based components, rather 
than session-by-session protocols organized by diagnosis, is a promising solution to known 
implementation barriers. The modular approach capitalizes on therapists’ tendency to be 
integrative when adapting efficacious treatments to real-world practice demands. Modular 
treatments are efficient to train, inherently flexible, and easy to update as new intervention

data emerges. Modularity is also an ideal fit with current trends toward disruptive 
innovations in EBPIs, as it is patient-centered, responsive to idiographic variables that 
influence treatment engagement and response, and maintains a tight link to the evidence 
base while allowing therapists to select components that match their expertise and are 
feasible within their practice settings (Rotheram-Borus et al., 2012).

The contextual behavioral scientific approach that gave rise to ACT (Hayes et al., 2013) is 
well-suited to modular treatment design and evaluation because both rest on a pragmatic 
philosophy that lends itself to inductive and iterative methodologies for knowledge 
development and dissemination. Single case experimental designs are ideal for this kind of 
treatment distillation and matching because they allow for rapid knowledge generation based 
on critical comparisons at the level of clinical decision-making. Meta-analyses of between-
group treatment effects, including additive and dismantling studies, are unlikely to yield 
actionable insights for EBPI implementers (e.g., Ahn & Wampold, 2001; Bell et al., 2013) 
due to mismatched levels of analysis that obscure potentially important treatment by context 
interactions (for an illustrative exception, see Weisz, Weiss, Alicke, & Klotz, 1987). The 
current study employed aggregated single case experiments to test functional relationships 
among procedures, processes, and outcomes in two transdiagnostic content modules 
(Chorpita, Daleiden, & Weisz, 2005b), which serve as the building blocks in modular 
treatment design. This methodology could also be employed in the development and 
evaluation of coordination modules, which outline the algorithms for deciding when to use 
which content modules and would constitute the next step in modular treatment 
development.

The current study does not test a modular treatment protocol, but it does test key properties 
of proposed treatment modules, defined as “self-contained functional units that connect with 
other units, but do not rely on those other units for their own stable operations” (Chorpita et 
al., 2005b, p. 142). The principle of proper functioning signifies that modules are defined by 
their function, not by categorical labels (e.g., ACT) or techniques (e.g., meditation), and 
must demonstrate reliable production of intended results in terms of therapeutic processes 
(e.g., emotional acceptance) and outcomes (e.g., symptom severity, quality of life). This 
study demonstrated the proper functioning of ACT OPEN and ACT ENGAGED modules in 
both specific and common treatment processes and outcomes. The principle of 
encapsulation refers to keeping all knowledge and competencies necessary for successful 
implementation of each module self-contained, allowing maximal flexibility in selecting and 
sequencing modules. Fidelity monitoring within the current study demonstrated that ACT 
modules can be functionally independent and distinct, adequately addressing a wide range of 
clinical content across 8 sessions with no contamination of therapy procedures across 
modules or use of procedures not specified by the module (e.g., non-adherence).

The current study suggests that treatment modules targeting components of ACT’s 
psychological flexibility model are feasible and effective in treating adults with mixed 
anxiety and depression. Both the ACT OPEN and ACT ENGAGED modules were 
acceptable to adults seeking mental health treatment, demonstrating 100% treatment 
completion rates and very high levels of patient satisfaction post-treatment and at 3-month 
follow-up. Both modules demonstrated broad symptom improvements and sustained

increases in quality of life, though they were comprised of wholly different interventions 
and produced distinct changes in psychological processes. Components such as these afford 
therapists flexibility in developing a treatment that is both personalized and pragmatic, while 
maintaining its link to the evidence base.

Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research

Though the present study design provided a good balance between external validity and 
experimental control (e.g., randomization, replication across participants), critical 
comparisons should be replicated to see if current results hold across experimenters, 
treatment settings, therapists, and participants. While formal mediation analyses were 
beyond the scope of the current study, examination of time-lagged associations between 
process and outcome variables are possible within single case experiments (Hilliard, 1993; 
Tschacher & Ramseyer, 2009) and are recommended for developing modular treatment 
protocols that optimize exposure to key treatment mechanisms.

It will also be important to further assess how participant, therapist, and setting variables 
interact with modular treatment components. Future studies should examine module 
dependencies, including order and additive effects, and specific person X module X context 
interactions in order to develop testable clinical decision algorithms and coordination 
modules. Though group designs would require massive samples to power so many 
interaction effects, results from SCED, including the current study, can be aggregated to 
provide guidelines for personalized selection and evaluation of treatment components (Van 
den Noortgate & Onghena, 2007). While the majority of published meta-analyses compare 
group means and yield only a single estimate of an intervention effect (Alemayehu, 2011), 
meta-analyses of the rich individual-level data from single case experiments can provide 
detailed knowledge of individual patient, therapist, and context variables that influence 
treatment effectiveness (Cooper & Patall, 2009; Iwakabe & Gazzola, 2009; Thompson & 
Higgins, 2005). Such a progressive accumulation of “big data” may finally allow us to 
answer Gordon Paul’s (Paul, 1969) ultimate clinical question of “what treatment, by whom, 
is most effective for this individual with that specific problem, under which set of 
circumstances, and how does it come about?”

ACT component modules were examined for specificity of treatment effects in 
adults

Both modules improved symptom severity and life quality, but effect sizes 
differed

The OPEN module had larger effects on symptoms, cognitive defusion, and 
acceptance

The ENGAGED module had larger effects on life quality and values-based 
activation

Both modules improved awareness and nonreactivity to thoughts, feelings, 
sensations
